Okay, so I have this NMR question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that a solution contains a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio and three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

The options given are four different mixtures of tetramethylbenzenes and one with diethyl groups. I need to figure out which two compounds are present.

First, I'll think about the molecular formula. Each compound is C10H14. So each is a disubstituted benzene with two substituents each, perhaps? Wait, noâ€”wait, the formula for benzene is C6H6. If a benzene ring has substituents, each substituent (like a methyl) would add a certain number of carbons and hydrogens. Let me check: each compound is C10H14. So C10H14 minus C6H6 is C4H8. So four carbons and eight hydrogens from substituents. Hmm. That suggests that each benzene ring has four substituents, each a methyl group, because 4 methyl groups would be 4 carbons and 4*(3H)=12 H, but wait, the benzene is C6H6, so when substituents are added, the H count goes down. Wait, perhaps each substituent is a methyl (CH3). So four methyl groups would add 4*3=12 H, but the benzene ring would have fewer H as substituents are added.

Wait, but let me think about the molecular formula. For each compound, it's C10H14. Benzene is C6; so substituents are C4 and H14. Benzene has 6 H. Each substituent (like CH3) would replace a H on benzene. So, for four substituents, each is a CH3, the benzene would have 6 -4 =2 H. Then, each CH3 has 3 H, so 4 CH3's have 12 H. So total H would be 2 (from benzene) +12 =14. That matches C10H14 (since 6+4=10 C, 6 +12=18 H? Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm confusing. Let's calculate:

Each compound is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. So substituents would be C4H8. Because 10-6=4 C, and 14-6=8 H.

Each substituent is a methyl group, which is CH3. So, four substituents would be 4*(CH3) = C4H12. But wait, that's 4 C and 12 H. But the substituents need to contribute C4H8. So that doesn't add up. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, maybe each substituent is a CH2CH3 group? No, because then each substituent would be C2H5, so four substituents would be 8 C, which is more than the available 4 C (since 10-6=4). So that's not possible. So perhaps it's not that.

Wait, other possibility: perhaps the substituents are ethyl groups? No, same problem. Alternatively, maybe there are two substituents, each of which is a -OCH3 or something else, but the question says the options are tetramethylbenzenes and diethylbenzene. Wait, looking at the options:

The options are:

1) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (so four methyl groups)
2) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
3) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
4) 1,4-diethylbenzene (so two ethyl groups)

So, let me check the molecular formula for each.

For tetramethylbenzenes:

Each has four methyl groups. Benzene (C6H6) plus four CH3 groups: C6+4= C10. Each CH3 has 3 H, so 4*3=12. The benzene ring, after substitution, has 6 -4 =2 H. So total H: 12 +2 =14. So molecular formula is C10H14. That's correct.

For 1,4-diethylbenzene: each ethyl is CH2CH3. So two ethyl groups would contribute 2*(2 C) =4 C. Benzene is C6, so total C is 6+4=10, correct. Hydrogens: benzene has 6 H. Each ethyl group has 2*(2+3) =2*(5) =10 H. So benzene has 6-2=4 H (since two substituents). So total H: 4 +10 =14. So molecular formula is C10H14, correct.

So all options are C10H14.

Now, the NMR data: two singlets around 6.7 ppm (aromatic protons) in a 1:1 ratio. Three singlets at 2.2 ppm in 2:1:1 ratio.

First, let's analyze the aromatic region. Two singlets, each a singlet, and in a 1:1 ratio. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each singlet corresponds to a different compound. So each compound contributes one singlet, and each singlet integrates to one proton (since in a 1:1 ratio, each would be one peak at 6.7 ppm).

Wait, but each compound contributes a number of aromatic protons. If each compound's NMR spectrum has a singlet in the aromatic region, that suggests that each has equivalent aromatic protons, perhaps as a singlet.

Alternatively, perhaps each compound has only one set of equivalent aromatic protons, which is a singlet. For example, if a compound has all equivalent aromatic protons, that would be a singlet. But more likely, each compound has a single set of aromatic protons.

Wait, but for a benzene ring with four substituents, the number of equivalent aromatic protons depends on the substitution pattern.

Let me think about the substitution patterns of the options.

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1,2,3,4. Wait, that's four adjacent positions, so it's a 1,2,3,4-tetra substitution. That would leave positions 5 and 6. But wait, wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1,2,3,4 are four in a row, and the other two positions are 5 and 6, which are adjacent? Let me draw it mentally.

Wait, no, in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 4 are opposite each other. So 1,2,3,4 would be positions 1, 2, 3,4 in a row, but each adjacent. Wait, that's impossible because in a benzene ring there are only six positions. So 1,2,3,4 would be four consecutive positions, leaving 5 and 6. Wait, but that would mean that positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to position 4 and 1, respectively.

Wait, perhaps it's a 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, which is also called 1,2,3,4-tetra-methylbenzene. Another way to think about it is that it's a 1,2,3,4 substitution, which would make the ring have four substituents in a row, with the other two positions (5 and 6) being empty. But wait, wait, in that case, the ring would have two H's: at positions 5 and 6. Wait, but in that case, are those two H equivalent? Let me think about symmetry.

In 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the structure would be four methyl groups in a row. The structure is such that the two remaining positions are 5 and 6. Are those H's equivalent? Let me imagine the molecule: positions 1,2,3,4 are all methyl. So position 5 is next to 4 and 6, and position 6 is next to 5 and 1. So, are H5 and H6 equivalent? Let me think about the molecule's symmetry. If you have four methyl groups in a row, the molecule has a certain symmetry. Let's see: if you rotate 180 degrees, would the structure look the same? Hmm, perhaps. Because if you have substituents at positions 1,2,3,4, then positions 5 and 6 are opposite each other, maybe. Wait, no, position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6, and position 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1. Wait, no, in a benzene ring, position 1 is next to 2 and 6. Position 2 next to 1 and 3, and so on up to position 6 next to 5 and 1.

So 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have substituents at 1,2,3,4. So the two H's are at 5 and 6. Are these two H's equivalent? Let me imagine the molecule. If you have substituents in 1,2,3,4, then positions 5 and 6 are each next to a methyl group (position 4 and 1, respectively). So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between positions 3 and 6 perhaps? Or maybe some other symmetry. Wait, perhaps the two H's are equivalent. Let me think, when you have four substituents in a row, the two H's would be in equivalent positions due to the symmetry of the molecule. So each of these H's would be equivalent, giving a singlet for each.

Wait, but if the substituents are in 1,2,3,4, then looking from the top, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry passing through the center between positions 3 and 6 and positions 1 and 6? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a C2 axis or some other symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the two H's at 5 and 6 are not equivalent and thus would split into two different signals. Hmm, but in the NMR, the two aromatic signals are singlets, each in a 1:1 ratio. So each compound contributes one singlet in the aromatic region.

Wait, but if each compound has only one type of aromatic proton, that would be a singlet. So let's think about each structure's aromatic protons.

First, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's see: substituents at 1,2,4,5. So positions 3 and 6 are free. Are H3 and H6 equivalent? Let me visualize. The substituents at 1,2,4,5. Positions 3 and 6 are opposite each other. Are they equivalent? Let me think: the substituents are at 1,2,4,5. So in this case, the molecule has a certain symmetry. Let me imagine the benzene ring with substituents at positions 1,2,4,5. The positions 3 and 6 are each next to substituents.

Wait, maybe in this case, the substituents are arranged such that positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. So their H's would be equivalent, giving a singlet. So 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene would have two equivalent aromatic protons, so a singlet.

Another example: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Substituents at 1,2,3,4. The H's are at 5 and 6. Are these equivalent? Let me think, the substituents are four in a row. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the center, perhaps. So 5 and 6 would be mirror images, hence equivalent. So their H's would be equivalent, giving a singlet.

Wait, but wait another way. If substituents are at 1,2,3,4, then 5 and 6 are adjacent to substituents at 4 and 1, respectively. Are these environments the same? If the substituents are all methyl groups, then perhaps they are equivalent, giving a singlet. So each of these tetramethyl compounds would have a singlet in the aromatic region.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps each of these tetramethyl compounds has more than one set of aromatic protons. For example, in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (option 2), substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So the free positions are 4 and 6. Are H4 and H6 equivalent? Let me imagine the structure. Substituents at 1,2,3,5. So position 4 is next to substituents 3 and 5. Position 6 is next to substituents 5 and 1. Are these environments the same? Hmm, perhaps not. Because substituent 5 is adjacent to substituents at 4 and 6. Wait, perhaps this molecule doesn't have any equivalent aromatic protons, meaning it would show multiple peaks. Wait, but that might not fit with the NMR data.

Wait, the NMR shows two singlets in the aromatic region. So each compound must have only one type of aromatic proton, which is a singlet. So each of the two compounds must have their aromatic protons as a singlet.

So let's look at each option's aromatic protons.

Option 1: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. Substituents at 1,2,4,5. So positions 3 and 6 are free.

Wait, wait, position 3 and 6 are across from each other, maybe. Let's think: substituents are 1,2,4,5. So position 3 is adjacent to substituents at 2 and 4. Position 6 is adjacent to substituents at 5 and 1. Are these H's in the same environment? Let me think about the symmetry. If I rotate the molecule 180 degrees, would substituents 1 and 4 swap with 5 and 2, respectively? Or perhaps there's a mirror plane. Hmm, maybe the H at position 3 and H at position 6 are not equivalent. Because substituents at 1 and 5 are adjacent to position 6 and 3, respectively. But wait, substituent 1 is at a position that's opposite to 4, perhaps, so when you rotate 180 degrees, 1 swaps with 4. So substituent 2 would swap with 5, and substituent 3 swaps with 6. So position 3 and 6's environments would be the same, making their H's equivalent. Therefore, they would be a singlet. So 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene would have a singlet for its aromatic protons.

Option 2: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Substituents at 1,2,3,5. So the free positions are 4 and 6. Are H4 and H6 equivalent? Let's see. Position 4 is next to substituents at 3 and 5, while position 6 is next to substituents at 5 and 1. Are these environments the same? Let's think about the symmetry. Let me imagine if there's any symmetry that makes H4 and H6 equivalent. If I rotate the ring 120 degrees, would substituents move in a way that H4 and H6 environments become the same? Probably not, because substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So the substituents around H4 and H6 are different. So H4 and H6 are not equivalent, meaning they would split into two peaks. So this compound would have two aromatic signals, which would not fit the NMR data since the NMR shows two signals (each from a different compound). So this option (1,2,3,5) would not fit, as it would have two aromatic peaks, leading to the NMR having more than two signals.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals, each a singlet, at around 6.7 ppm. So perhaps each of the two compounds contributes a singlet, so each has only one type of aromatic H. So let's see which of the options have this characteristic.

Option 3: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Substituents at 1,2,3,4. Free positions 5 and 6. Are H5 and H6 equivalent? Let me imagine. The substituents are in positions 1,2,3,4. So H5 is next to substituents 4 and 6, and H6 is next to substituents 5 and 1. Wait, no, substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So H5 is next to substituents at 4 and 6 (but 6 is H, not a substituent). Wait, no, substituents are only at 1,2,3,4. So H5 is next to substituents at position 4 and position 6 (if any). Wait, no: substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So H5 is at position 5, so adjacent to substituents at 4 and 6? Wait, substituent at 4 is at position 4, so H5 is next to substituent 4 and substituent 5? Wait, substituent 5 is a free position, so H5 is next to substituent 4 and substituent 6? Wait, no, substituent is at 4 (CH3), and position 5 is H. So H5 is adjacent to CH3 at 4 and CH3 at 6? Wait, no, position 6's substituent is in the case of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, position 6 is H, right? No, wait, substituents are at 1,2,3,4, so positions 5 and 6 are H. So H5 is next to substituent 4 (CH3) and H6. Similarly, H6 is next to substituent 1 (CH3) and H5. Are their environments the same? Let me think about the symmetry. If I look at the molecule, rotating 180 degrees would swap substituent 1 with 4, and 2 with 3, and H5 would swap with H6. So H5 and H6 would be in the same environment, making their H's equivalent. Hence, this compound would have a singlet in the aromatic region. So 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would contribute a singlet.

Option 4: 1,4-diethylbenzene. Substituents at 1 and 4 (ethyl groups). So the free positions are 2,3,5,6. Wait, wait, in benzene, substituents at 1 and 4 are para positions. So the substituents are at 1 and 4, each with an ethyl group. So the aromatic H's would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Are any of these H's equivalent?

Wait, in 1,4-diethylbenzene, the molecule has a high symmetry, perhaps. The substituents at 1 and 4 are para, so the molecule is symmetric across the axis through positions 1 and 4. So, positions 2 and 6 are mirror images. Similarly, positions 3 and 5 are mirror images. So H2 and H6 are equivalent, and H3 and H5 are equivalent. So that would give two sets of equivalent H's, each as a doublet or something else. Wait, but what's the actual splitting?

Wait, in 1,4-diethylbenzene, the aromatic H's at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent. So their environments are the same, leading to two sets of equivalent H's. How would that appear in the NMR?

Each set (H2 and H6, H3 and H5) would be a doublet due to coupling with adjacent H's. Or perhaps they are each a singlet if the coupling is not observed. Wait, but that depends on the coupling.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR. The question says two signals in the aromatic region. So each compound must have only one set of equivalent H's, each contributing a singlet. So 1,4-diethylbenzene would have two sets of H's: H2/H6 and H3/H5, each as a doublet (if coupled), but that would split into two signals, each a doublet. But the NMR shows two singlets. So this would not fit, because option 4 (the diethyl compound) would have two signals in the aromatic region, but the NMR shows only two signals, one per compound. So if both compounds have only one aromatic singlet each, then the mixture would have two singlets. So if one of the compounds is diethylbenzene, it would contribute two signals, which would cause the NMR to have more than two signals, so that's not possible. Therefore, the mixture cannot include diethylbenzene.

Wait, but the question says that the mixture has two signals in the aromatic region, each a singlet, and the other signals are in the aliphatic region. So the diethyl compound can't be part of the mixture because it would have two signals in the aromatic region, leading to more than two signals in total. So the correct mixture must consist of two tetramethyl compounds, each contributing a singlet in the aromatic region.

So looking at the options, the possible options are those that are tetramethylbenzenes.

Now, looking at the options A, B, D involve tetramethyl compounds. Option C includes diethylbenzene, which we've determined can't be part of the correct answer.

So options A, B, D are possible.

Now, the aliphatic region: three signals at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. All singlets.

So each compound in the mixture contributes some aliphatic protons, and their NMR signals add up. The ratio is 2:1:1, meaning that across the two compounds, the aliphatic signals are in that ratio.

Each tetramethyl compound would have four CH3 groups, but perhaps in some symmetric arrangement leading to fewer signals.

Wait, let's think about each compound's aliphatic protons.

For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,4,5.

Let me sketch this: substituents are at positions 1,2,4,5. So, the four methyl groups are attached at those positions. Are any of these methyl groups equivalent due to symmetry?

Looking at the structure, substituents at 1 and 4 are para to each other, and substituents at 2 and 5 are also para. Because in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 4 are opposite (para), as are positions 2 and 5.

So, the methyl groups at 1 and 4 would be in equivalent environments, and similarly, methyl groups at 2 and 5 would be in equivalent environments. So each pair would be a singlet. So for this compound, the CH3 groups would split into two signals: one from the methyl at 1 and 4 (equivalent), another from the methyl at 2 and 5 (equivalent). Thus, the aliphatic region would have two singlets: one integrating to 2 H (since two methyl groups, each with 3 H, but wait, wait no.

Wait, no. Each methyl group has three H. So for 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and each has three H. So their signal would integrate to 6 H. Similarly, the methyl groups at 2 and 5 are equivalent, each with 3 H, so their signal would be 6 H. So in the NMR, this compound would show two singlets in the aliphatic region, integrating as 6 H each.

Wait, but in the question's data, the aliphatic signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio. That suggests three signals, all singlets, with ratios 2:1:1. So if each of the two compounds contributes certain signals, the combined signals would sum to 2:1:1.

Wait, but if the first compound contributes two singlets (each 6 H), and the second contributes something else, perhaps a single singlet of 3 H, then the total aliphatic signals would be 6 (from first), 6 (from first), and 3 (from second) â€” but that's three signals, but the ratios would be 6:6:3 â†’ simplifying, 2:2:1. But the question says the ratio is 2:1:1.

Hmm, that's a problem. Let me think again.

Alternate approach: each aliphatic signal comes from the same type of CH3 group across both compounds. So let's see how each option's aliphatic signals would look.

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl.

So for each compound:

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,4.

Are the methyl groups equivalent? Let's see. The substituents are in a row. So positions 1,2,3,4. Are any of the methyl groups equivalent?

Well, the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are para to each other, but in this substitution pattern. Wait, in 1,2,3,4-tetra, the substituents are in a row of four. So the methyl at 1 and 4 are adjacent to different substituents. Hmm, perhaps this isn't symmetric enough to have equivalent CH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has some symmetry. Let me think: substituents at 1,2,3,4. So, positions 1,2,3,4 are all methyl. The molecule would have a certain symmetry. Maybe the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. Similarly, methyl groups at 2 and 3 might be equivalent.

So in this case, the aliphatic region would have two singlets: one from the methyl groups at 1 and 4 (equivalent, each 3 H, so total 6 H), and another from methyl groups at 2 and 3 (each 3 H, total 6 H). So this would give two aliphatic signals, each integrating to 6 H.

Similarly, the other compound in option A is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's see the symmetry here. Substituents at 1,2,3,5. Are any CH3 groups equivalent?

Wait, substituents at 1,2,3,5. So, position 4 is free. Let me think about whether any methyl groups are equivalent. For example, methyl at 1 and 2: position 1 is adjacent to substituents at 2 and 6 (no, 6 is H). Wait, perhaps the methyl groups at 1,2,3,5 are arranged such that some are equivalent. Alternatively, perhaps this structure has no equivalent CH3 groups, leading to four singlets in the aliphatic region.

Wait, that would complicate the NMR. So perhaps option A is not correct.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Each of these compounds would have their own aliphatic signals.

First, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: as discussed earlier, two sets of equivalent CH3 groups: 1 and 4 (each 3 H, 6 H total), and 2 and 5 (each 3 H, 6 H total). So aliphatic signals would be two singlets, each 6 H.

The other compound in option D is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Substituents at 1,2,3,5. So the positions 4 and 6 are free.

Looking for symmetry, perhaps some CH3 groups are equivalent.

Let me imagine the structure. Substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So CH3 at 1 is adjacent to substituents at 2 and 6 (but 6 is H). CH3 at 2 is adjacent to substituents at 1 and 3. CH3 at 3 is adjacent to substituents at 2 and 4 (which is H). CH3 at 5 is adjacent to substituents at 4 and 6 (but 4 is H). Are any of these methyl groups equivalent? It's not obvious. It's possible that none are equivalent, leading to four singlets in the aliphatic region. But that would mean four aliphatic signals, which can't fit the 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps this is not the correct option.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

So let's see their aliphatic signals.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: two aliphatic signals, each 6 H (as discussed).

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: as discussed, two aliphatic signals, each 6 H.

If these two are mixed in a 1:1 ratio, the aliphatic signals would be the sum of their individual signals. So for 1,2,4,5, the two signals would be 6 H each. For 1,2,3,4, the two signals would be 6 H each.

So when mixed, the NMR would have four aliphatic signals, each 6 H, which doesn't match the given data of three signals in 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the two compounds have some overlapping aliphatic signals, leading to fewer peaks. For example, if one of the aliphatic signals from each compound is the same.

Wait, let's think again about the aliphatic region. The NMR shows three signals: two: 2:1:1. So perhaps one of the compounds has a singlet integrating to 6 H (two CH3 groups), and another compound has a singlet integrating to 3 H, and another singlet integrating to 3 H. Wait, but that would require the two compounds to have a combination of CH3 groups that sum to 6+3+3=12 H, but each compound has 4 CH3 groups (each 3 H) â†’ 12 H per compound. So in a 1:1 mixture, total aliphatic H would be 24, which is correct.

But how does that fit the 2:1:1 ratio?

Wait, the aliphatic signals in the NMR are in a 2:1:1 ratio. So combining the two compounds, the sum of the signals would be 2:1:1.

Suppose one compound contributes a singlet of 6 H and another singlet of 6 H. The other compound contributes a singlet of 3 H and another of 3 H. But that would give four signals, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps one compound has two sets of CH3 groups: two singlets, each 6 H. The other compound has three sets: but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the other compound has three CH3 groups, but that's not possible because all options have four CH3 groups.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about each compound's aliphatic signals.

If a compound's aliphatic protons are split into two or more signals, each as singlets, then when mixed, the total would be the sum. So perhaps the two compounds have their aliphatic signals in such a way that when combined, they form three signals with the ratio 2:1:1.

Let me think about each possible option.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene's aliphatic signals: two singlets, each 6 H.

1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene's aliphatic signals: perhaps four singlets, each 3 H. But that would lead to 2 +4=6 signals, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has some equivalent CH3 groups. Let me re-examine.

In 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,5.

Are any of the CH3 groups equivalent?

Let me think about symmetry. If I rotate the molecule 120 degrees, would any CH3 groups overlap? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps there's a plane of symmetry that makes some CH3 groups equivalent.

Wait, substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So, positions 4 and 6 are free. Let me see: substituent at 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Substituent at 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. Substituent at 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4. Substituent at 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6.

Is there any symmetry here that makes any CH3 groups equivalent? Maybe CH3 at 1 and 5 are equivalent? Or CH3 at 2 and 3 are equivalent?

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes CH3 at 1 and 5 equivalent, and CH3 at 2 and 3 equivalent. Let me imagine: the plane might be through the center of the ring, passing between positions 4 and 6. So, CH3 at 1 and 5 would be mirror images, hence equivalent. Similarly, CH3 at 2 and 3 would also be mirror images if the mirror plane is such. In that case, the aliphatic signals would be two singlets: one for CH3 at 1 and 5 (each 3 H, 6 H total), and another for CH3 at 2 and 3 (each 3 H, 6 H total). So same as the first compound in option D.

Wait, then in option D, each of the two compounds would have two aliphatic signals, each 6 H. So the mixture would have four aliphatic signals, each integrating to 6 H, which doesn't fit the given 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think differently.

Wait, the NMR shows three aliphatic signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps one signal is 6 H (two CH3 groups), another is 3 H (one CH3), and another is 3 H (another CH3). So how can the two compounds contribute to this?

Suppose one compound contributes a 6 H singlet (two CH3 groups) and a 6 H singlet (another two CH3 groups). The other compound contributes a 3 H singlet and a 3 H singlet. Then the combined signals would be 6 (from first), 6 (from first), 3 (from second), 3 (from second). But when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, the integration would be 6, 6, 3,3. Summing, the ratios would be 6:6:3:3 â†’ 2:2:1:1. But the question states only three signals, so perhaps some signals overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the compounds has two aliphatic signals (each 6 H), and the other has three aliphatic signals (each 3 H), but that's not possible since each compound has four methyl groups. Wait, four CH3 groups would contribute either two signals (each two CH3) or four signals (each CH3 unique).

Wait, perhaps one of the compounds has two CH3 groups that are equivalent (two singlets, each 6 H) and the other compound has three CH3 groups that are equivalent in a way that one is 6 H and the others sum to 3 H. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the integration ratios. The aliphatic signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio, meaning the three signals have H counts proportional to 2,1,1.

So, for a 1:1 mixture:

- The first signal would be 2 parts, so 2 units (each unit being 3 H from a CH3 group).
- The second and third signals would be 1 unit each.

Wait, but each unit corresponds to what? Let me think: the integration is in the ratio 2:1:1. So, the total aliphatic H from both compounds would be 2+1+1 =4 units. Each unit corresponds to X H.

But each compound has four CH3 groups, which is 4*(3 H) =12 H. So two compounds would have 24 H in total. So 4 units =24 H â†’ each unit is 6 H. So the signals would be 2*6=12 H, 6 H, and 6 H. So the aliphatic signals would have integrations of 12, 6, and 6.

So, the mixture must have three aliphatic signals: one integrating to 12 H (2 units), and two integrating to 6 H each (1 unit each).

So, how can the two compounds' aliphatic signals sum to 12, 6, and 6?

Let me look at the options again.

Option D: two compounds, each with two aliphatic signals of 6 H each.

So their mixture would contribute 12 H (from each 6+6 in each compound, but in a 1:1 ratio). Wait, no. Each compound contributes two singlets of 6 H each. So in the mixture, each of these would appear as two signals at 6 H each for each compound. Since the mixture is 1:1, the signals would be 6 (from first) and 6 (from second) for each aliphatic group. But that would give two signals, each 6 H, from each compound. So the total would be four signals, each 6 H, which doesn't fit the 12,6,6 scenario.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's think about which options' aliphatic signals could combine to give 12,6,6.

For example, one compound has two aliphatic signals: 6 H and 6 H. The other compound has three aliphatic signals: but wait, four CH3 groups can't split into three signals. So perhaps the other compound has one aliphatic signal of 6 H and another of 6 H, but that would again require four signals.

Alternatively, perhaps one compound has two signals (each 6 H), and the other has a single signal of 6 H plus another two signals of 3 H each, but that's not possible because four CH3 groups can only make up to four signals.

Wait, perhaps the other compound has a singlet of 6 H and another singlet of 6 H, same as the first. But that would give four signals, each 6 H, which doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I'm missing the possibility that one of the aliphatic signals is split by coupling, but the question states they are all singlets.

Wait, perhaps one of the compounds has three equivalent methyl groups, contributing a 9 H singlet, but that's not possible because four CH3 groups can't sum to 9 H. Alternatively, perhaps one of the compounds has two pairs of equivalent CH3 groups, each pair contributing a 6 H singlet.

Let me think about option D again. Each compound in D has two aliphatic signals, each 6 H. So when mixed, the two 6 H signals from each compound would add up.

Wait, but in a 1:1 mixture, each signal would be present as 6 H from each compound. But if the two CH3 types are the same in both compounds, their signals would overlap, leading to a single 12 H peak for each.

But that's not the case. So perhaps the aliphatic signals from each compound are different, leading to four peaks. But the NMR only shows three.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Perhaps I should consider which options have aliphatic signals that, when combined, give three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, another approach: the three aliphatic signals are at 2.2 ppm, all singlets.

If the aliphatic region has three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio, then perhaps one of the compounds has two singlets, and the other has one singlet. Or perhaps each compound contributes to two of the signals, and one is from both.

Wait, but each compound has four CH3 groups. Let me think about the possible aliphatic signals each could contribute.

Let me consider option D again: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:

- The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, contributing a singlet of 6 H.
- The methyl groups at positions 2 and 5 are equivalent, contributing a singlet of 6 H.

So in option D, the first compound contributes two aliphatic singlets (6 H each).

The second compound in option D is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Let me reevaluate this structure's symmetry. Substituents are at 1,2,3,5.

Looking for symmetry, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at 2 and 3 are equivalent.

If that's the case, then the aliphatic region would have two singlets: one from 1 and 5 (6 H), and another from 2 and 3 (6 H).

So the NMR would have four aliphatic signals: two from each compound, each 6 H. But the question shows three signals, so perhaps this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the second compound in option D doesn't have any equivalent methyl groups, leading to four aliphatic signals. That would complicate the NMR even more.

Wait, perhaps the second compound (1,2,3,5) has two pairs of equivalent methyl groups, but I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, perhaps it has methyl groups at 1 and 3 that are equivalent, and those at 2 and 5 are equivalent.

Wait, in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes methyl at 1 and 3 equivalent, and methyl at 2 and 5 equivalent.

If that's the case, then the aliphatic signals would be two singlets: 6 H (from 1 and 3) and 6 H (from 2 and 5).

So in option D, each compound contributes two aliphatic signals, each 6 H. So the mixture would have four signals, each 6 H, which doesn't match the 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm. Perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the aliphatic region's integration.

The aliphatic signals sum to 2:1:1, so 12, 6, 6.

So, perhaps one compound contributes a singlet of 12 H, and the other contributes two singlets of 6 H each. But each CH3 group is 3 H, so 12 H would imply four equivalent CH3 groups. But that's only possible if all four CH3 groups are equivalent, which would require a very symmetric structure.

Which of the options have all four CH3 groups equivalent?

Looking at the options:

- 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: The substituents are at 1,2,4,5. If the molecule is symmetric enough, all four CH3 groups could be equivalent. Wait, is that possible?

In such a structure, perhaps the four CH3 groups are all in the same environment. Let me imagine: substituents at 1,2,4,5. So, the molecule would have a center of symmetry, making all four CH3 groups equivalent. If that's the case, the aliphatic region would have a single singlet of 12 H.

If that's true, then the first compound would contribute a 12 H singlet, and the second compound would contribute two singlets, each 6 H. So the mixture would have three signals: 12,6,6, in a 2:1:1 ratio when considering the integration.

So, which option has one compound with all four CH3 groups equivalent and another with two sets of two equivalent CH3 groups.

Looking at the options, perhaps option D is the case.

Wait, let me check the structures again.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,4,5.

If the molecule has a center of symmetry, then substituents are arranged such that each CH3 group is equivalent. For example, substituents at 1 and 5 are across from each other, and substituents at 2 and 4 are across from each other. So, all four CH3 groups would be in the same environment, leading to a single aliphatic singlet of 12 H.

If that's the case, then the first compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl) would contribute a 12 H singlet. The second compound in option D is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would have two sets of equivalent CH3 groups, each as 6 H. So the mixture would have:

- 12 H (from first compound)
- 6 H (from second compound's first set)
- 6 H (from second compound's second set)

So the aliphatic signals would be 12,6,6 â†’ which is a 2:1:1 ratio. That matches the given data.

So in this case, the two compounds would be 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (contributing a 12 H singlet) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (contributing two 6 H singlets).

Wait, but how does the aromatic region fit? Each of these two compounds must contribute a singlet in the aromatic region.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: as discussed, has two equivalent aromatic H's, so a singlet.

1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,5. Are the aromatic H's equivalent?

Wait, substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So, the free positions are 4 and 6. Are H4 and H6 equivalent?

Let me think about the structure. Substituents at 1,2,3,5. H4 is next to substituents at 3 and 5. H6 is next to substituents at 1 and 5.

Wait, are these environments the same? If the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes H4 and H6 equivalent, then they would be a singlet. Let me imagine: perhaps the molecule has a mirror plane that reflects positions 4 and 6. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a rotational symmetry that makes H4 and H6 equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the two H's are not equivalent, leading to two aromatic signals. But the NMR shows only one aromatic signal per compound, so this can't be the case.

Hmm, perhaps the aromatic H's are in the same environment. Let me think again. If substituents are at 1,2,3,5, then the two H's are at 4 and 6. Are their environments the same?

Each H at 4 is adjacent to substituents at 3 and 5. H at 6 is adjacent to substituents at 1 and 5.

Wait, substituent at 5 is adjacent to H4 and H6. So substituent at 5 is a CH3, adjacent to both H4 and H6. Substituent at 1 is adjacent to H6 and H2. Substituent at 2 is adjacent to H1 and H3. Substituent at 3 is adjacent to H2 and H4.

Hmm, perhaps the H's at 4 and 6 are in the same environment due to the symmetry. Let me imagine the molecule: substituents are at 1,2,3,5. If I rotate the molecule 180 degrees, would substituent 1 and 5 swap, and substituent 2 and 3 swap? Perhaps that would make H4 and H6 equivalent.

If that's the case, then the aromatic H's would be a singlet. So this option would fit.

So putting it all together, option D would have:

- 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: aromatic singlet (integrate to 2 H), aliphatic singlet (12 H).
- 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: aromatic singlet (integrate to 2 H), aliphatic two signals (6 H each).

So in the mixture, the aromatic region would have two singlets (each 2 H), matching the 1:1 ratio.

The aliphatic region would have three signals: 12 H (from first compound), 6 H (from second compound's first set), and 6 H (from second compound's second set), giving a 2:1:1 ratio.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying two aromatic compounds in a 1:1 mixture based on their 1H NMR data. The molecular formula of each compound is C10H14, and the NMR data shows two aromatic singlets at ~6.7 ppm (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets at ~2.2 ppm (2:1:1 ratio). The options provided are various tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Molecular Formula and Substitution Patterns**:
   - Each compound is C10H14, which corresponds to a benzene ring (C6H6) with four methyl groups (C4H8). This matches the tetramethylbenzenes and the diethylbenzene in the options.
   - The diethylbenzene (C10H14) has two ethyl groups, but its aromatic region would show two signals (not singlets), which does not match the NMR data. Thus, the diethylbenzene is ruled out.

2. **Aromatic Region**:
   - The NMR shows two aromatic singlets at ~6.7 ppm, each integrating to 2 H. This indicates that each compound has only one type of aromatic proton, which must be equivalent due to symmetry.
   - **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene**: Substituents at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 leave positions 3 and 6 free. These two aromatic protons are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry, resulting in a single aromatic singlet.
   - **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene**: Substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 leave positions 4 and 6 free. These two aromatic protons are also equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry, resulting in a single aromatic singlet.
   - **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene**: Substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 leave positions 5 and 6 free. These two aromatic protons are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry, resulting in a single aromatic singlet.

3. **Aliphatic Region**:
   - The NMR shows three aliphatic singlets at ~2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio, corresponding to 12 H, 6 H, and 6 H. This suggests that one compound has all four methyl groups equivalent (contributing 12 H as a single singlet), and the other compound has two sets of equivalent methyl groups (contributing 6 H each).

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene)**:
     - Both compounds have two aliphatic signals each (6 H each), leading to four aliphatic signals in total. This does not match the 2:1:1 ratio.
   - **Option B (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene)**:
     - Both compounds have two aliphatic signals each (6 H each), leading to four aliphatic signals in total. This does not match the 2:1:1 ratio.
   - **Option C (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene)**:
     - The diethylbenzene would produce two aromatic signals, which contradicts the NMR data. This option is ruled out.
   - **Option D (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene)**:
     - **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene**: All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry, producing a single aliphatic singlet of 12 H.
     - **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene**: Two sets of equivalent methyl groups (positions 1/5 and 2/3), producing two aliphatic singlets of 6 H each.
     - The aliphatic signals combine to give a 2:1:1 ratio (12 H, 6 H, 6 H), matching the NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The two compounds in the mixture are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. These compounds satisfy both the aromatic and aliphatic NMR data.

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this NMR question to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question says that a solution contains a 1:1 mixture of two aromatic compounds with the molecular formula C10H14. The 1H NMR spectrum shows two singlets around 6.7 ppm in a 1:1 ratio and three singlets at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio.

The options given are four different mixtures of tetramethylbenzenes and one with diethyl groups. I need to figure out which two compounds are present.

First, I'll think about the molecular formula. Each compound is C10H14. So each is a disubstituted benzene with two substituents each, perhaps? Wait, noâ€”wait, the formula for benzene is C6H6. If a benzene ring has substituents, each substituent (like a methyl) would add a certain number of carbons and hydrogens. Let me check: each compound is C10H14. So C10H14 minus C6H6 is C4H8. So four carbons and eight hydrogens from substituents. Hmm. That suggests that each benzene ring has four substituents, each a methyl group, because 4 methyl groups would be 4 carbons and 4*(3H)=12 H, but wait, the benzene is C6H6, so when substituents are added, the H count goes down. Wait, perhaps each substituent is a methyl (CH3). So four methyl groups would add 4*3=12 H, but the benzene ring would have fewer H as substituents are added.

Wait, but let me think about the molecular formula. For each compound, it's C10H14. Benzene is C6; so substituents are C4 and H14. Benzene has 6 H. Each substituent (like CH3) would replace a H on benzene. So, for four substituents, each is a CH3, the benzene would have 6 -4 =2 H. Then, each CH3 has 3 H, so 4 CH3's have 12 H. So total H would be 2 (from benzene) +12 =14. That matches C10H14 (since 6+4=10 C, 6 +12=18 H? Wait, no, wait. Wait, I'm confusing. Let's calculate:

Each compound is C10H14. Benzene is C6H6. So substituents would be C4H8. Because 10-6=4 C, and 14-6=8 H.

Each substituent is a methyl group, which is CH3. So, four substituents would be 4*(CH3) = C4H12. But wait, that's 4 C and 12 H. But the substituents need to contribute C4H8. So that doesn't add up. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, maybe each substituent is a CH2CH3 group? No, because then each substituent would be C2H5, so four substituents would be 8 C, which is more than the available 4 C (since 10-6=4). So that's not possible. So perhaps it's not that.

Wait, other possibility: perhaps the substituents are ethyl groups? No, same problem. Alternatively, maybe there are two substituents, each of which is a -OCH3 or something else, but the question says the options are tetramethylbenzenes and diethylbenzene. Wait, looking at the options:

The options are:

1) 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (so four methyl groups)
2) 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene
3) 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene
4) 1,4-diethylbenzene (so two ethyl groups)

So, let me check the molecular formula for each.

For tetramethylbenzenes:

Each has four methyl groups. Benzene (C6H6) plus four CH3 groups: C6+4= C10. Each CH3 has 3 H, so 4*3=12. The benzene ring, after substitution, has 6 -4 =2 H. So total H: 12 +2 =14. So molecular formula is C10H14. That's correct.

For 1,4-diethylbenzene: each ethyl is CH2CH3. So two ethyl groups would contribute 2*(2 C) =4 C. Benzene is C6, so total C is 6+4=10, correct. Hydrogens: benzene has 6 H. Each ethyl group has 2*(2+3) =2*(5) =10 H. So benzene has 6-2=4 H (since two substituents). So total H: 4 +10 =14. So molecular formula is C10H14, correct.

So all options are C10H14.

Now, the NMR data: two singlets around 6.7 ppm (aromatic protons) in a 1:1 ratio. Three singlets at 2.2 ppm in 2:1:1 ratio.

First, let's analyze the aromatic region. Two singlets, each a singlet, and in a 1:1 ratio. Since it's a 1:1 mixture, each singlet corresponds to a different compound. So each compound contributes one singlet, and each singlet integrates to one proton (since in a 1:1 ratio, each would be one peak at 6.7 ppm).

Wait, but each compound contributes a number of aromatic protons. If each compound's NMR spectrum has a singlet in the aromatic region, that suggests that each has equivalent aromatic protons, perhaps as a singlet.

Alternatively, perhaps each compound has only one set of equivalent aromatic protons, which is a singlet. For example, if a compound has all equivalent aromatic protons, that would be a singlet. But more likely, each compound has a single set of aromatic protons.

Wait, but for a benzene ring with four substituents, the number of equivalent aromatic protons depends on the substitution pattern.

Let me think about the substitution patterns of the options.

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. So the substituents are at positions 1,2,3,4. Wait, that's four adjacent positions, so it's a 1,2,3,4-tetra substitution. That would leave positions 5 and 6. But wait, wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1,2,3,4 are four in a row, and the other two positions are 5 and 6, which are adjacent? Let me draw it mentally.

Wait, no, in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 4 are opposite each other. So 1,2,3,4 would be positions 1, 2, 3,4 in a row, but each adjacent. Wait, that's impossible because in a benzene ring there are only six positions. So 1,2,3,4 would be four consecutive positions, leaving 5 and 6. Wait, but that would mean that positions 5 and 6 are adjacent to position 4 and 1, respectively.

Wait, perhaps it's a 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, which is also called 1,2,3,4-tetra-methylbenzene. Another way to think about it is that it's a 1,2,3,4 substitution, which would make the ring have four substituents in a row, with the other two positions (5 and 6) being empty. But wait, wait, in that case, the ring would have two H's: at positions 5 and 6. Wait, but in that case, are those two H equivalent? Let me think about symmetry.

In 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene, the structure would be four methyl groups in a row. The structure is such that the two remaining positions are 5 and 6. Are those H's equivalent? Let me imagine the molecule: positions 1,2,3,4 are all methyl. So position 5 is next to 4 and 6, and position 6 is next to 5 and 1. So, are H5 and H6 equivalent? Let me think about the molecule's symmetry. If you have four methyl groups in a row, the molecule has a certain symmetry. Let's see: if you rotate 180 degrees, would the structure look the same? Hmm, perhaps. Because if you have substituents at positions 1,2,3,4, then positions 5 and 6 are opposite each other, maybe. Wait, no, position 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6, and position 6 is adjacent to 5 and 1. Wait, no, in a benzene ring, position 1 is next to 2 and 6. Position 2 next to 1 and 3, and so on up to position 6 next to 5 and 1.

So 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would have substituents at 1,2,3,4. So the two H's are at 5 and 6. Are these two H's equivalent? Let me imagine the molecule. If you have substituents in 1,2,3,4, then positions 5 and 6 are each next to a methyl group (position 4 and 1, respectively). So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between positions 3 and 6 perhaps? Or maybe some other symmetry. Wait, perhaps the two H's are equivalent. Let me think, when you have four substituents in a row, the two H's would be in equivalent positions due to the symmetry of the molecule. So each of these H's would be equivalent, giving a singlet for each.

Wait, but if the substituents are in 1,2,3,4, then looking from the top, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry passing through the center between positions 3 and 6 and positions 1 and 6? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a C2 axis or some other symmetry. Alternatively, maybe the two H's at 5 and 6 are not equivalent and thus would split into two different signals. Hmm, but in the NMR, the two aromatic signals are singlets, each in a 1:1 ratio. So each compound contributes one singlet in the aromatic region.

Wait, but if each compound has only one type of aromatic proton, that would be a singlet. So let's think about each structure's aromatic protons.

First, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's see: substituents at 1,2,4,5. So positions 3 and 6 are free. Are H3 and H6 equivalent? Let me visualize. The substituents at 1,2,4,5. Positions 3 and 6 are opposite each other. Are they equivalent? Let me think: the substituents are at 1,2,4,5. So in this case, the molecule has a certain symmetry. Let me imagine the benzene ring with substituents at positions 1,2,4,5. The positions 3 and 6 are each next to substituents.

Wait, maybe in this case, the substituents are arranged such that positions 3 and 6 are equivalent. So their H's would be equivalent, giving a singlet. So 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene would have two equivalent aromatic protons, so a singlet.

Another example: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Substituents at 1,2,3,4. The H's are at 5 and 6. Are these equivalent? Let me think, the substituents are four in a row. So the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the center, perhaps. So 5 and 6 would be mirror images, hence equivalent. So their H's would be equivalent, giving a singlet.

Wait, but wait another way. If substituents are at 1,2,3,4, then 5 and 6 are adjacent to substituents at 4 and 1, respectively. Are these environments the same? If the substituents are all methyl groups, then perhaps they are equivalent, giving a singlet. So each of these tetramethyl compounds would have a singlet in the aromatic region.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps each of these tetramethyl compounds has more than one set of aromatic protons. For example, in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (option 2), substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So the free positions are 4 and 6. Are H4 and H6 equivalent? Let me imagine the structure. Substituents at 1,2,3,5. So position 4 is next to substituents 3 and 5. Position 6 is next to substituents 5 and 1. Are these environments the same? Hmm, perhaps not. Because substituent 5 is adjacent to substituents at 4 and 6. Wait, perhaps this molecule doesn't have any equivalent aromatic protons, meaning it would show multiple peaks. Wait, but that might not fit with the NMR data.

Wait, the NMR shows two singlets in the aromatic region. So each compound must have only one type of aromatic proton, which is a singlet. So each of the two compounds must have their aromatic protons as a singlet.

So let's look at each option's aromatic protons.

Option 1: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene. Substituents at 1,2,4,5. So positions 3 and 6 are free.

Wait, wait, position 3 and 6 are across from each other, maybe. Let's think: substituents are 1,2,4,5. So position 3 is adjacent to substituents at 2 and 4. Position 6 is adjacent to substituents at 5 and 1. Are these H's in the same environment? Let me think about the symmetry. If I rotate the molecule 180 degrees, would substituents 1 and 4 swap with 5 and 2, respectively? Or perhaps there's a mirror plane. Hmm, maybe the H at position 3 and H at position 6 are not equivalent. Because substituents at 1 and 5 are adjacent to position 6 and 3, respectively. But wait, substituent 1 is at a position that's opposite to 4, perhaps, so when you rotate 180 degrees, 1 swaps with 4. So substituent 2 would swap with 5, and substituent 3 swaps with 6. So position 3 and 6's environments would be the same, making their H's equivalent. Therefore, they would be a singlet. So 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene would have a singlet for its aromatic protons.

Option 2: 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Substituents at 1,2,3,5. So the free positions are 4 and 6. Are H4 and H6 equivalent? Let's see. Position 4 is next to substituents at 3 and 5, while position 6 is next to substituents at 5 and 1. Are these environments the same? Let's think about the symmetry. Let me imagine if there's any symmetry that makes H4 and H6 equivalent. If I rotate the ring 120 degrees, would substituents move in a way that H4 and H6 environments become the same? Probably not, because substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So the substituents around H4 and H6 are different. So H4 and H6 are not equivalent, meaning they would split into two peaks. So this compound would have two aromatic signals, which would not fit the NMR data since the NMR shows two signals (each from a different compound). So this option (1,2,3,5) would not fit, as it would have two aromatic peaks, leading to the NMR having more than two signals.

Wait, but the NMR shows two signals, each a singlet, at around 6.7 ppm. So perhaps each of the two compounds contributes a singlet, so each has only one type of aromatic H. So let's see which of the options have this characteristic.

Option 3: 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene. Substituents at 1,2,3,4. Free positions 5 and 6. Are H5 and H6 equivalent? Let me imagine. The substituents are in positions 1,2,3,4. So H5 is next to substituents 4 and 6, and H6 is next to substituents 5 and 1. Wait, no, substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So H5 is next to substituents at 4 and 6 (but 6 is H, not a substituent). Wait, no, substituents are only at 1,2,3,4. So H5 is next to substituents at position 4 and position 6 (if any). Wait, no: substituents are at 1,2,3,4. So H5 is at position 5, so adjacent to substituents at 4 and 6? Wait, substituent at 4 is at position 4, so H5 is next to substituent 4 and substituent 5? Wait, substituent 5 is a free position, so H5 is next to substituent 4 and substituent 6? Wait, no, substituent is at 4 (CH3), and position 5 is H. So H5 is adjacent to CH3 at 4 and CH3 at 6? Wait, no, position 6's substituent is in the case of 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl, position 6 is H, right? No, wait, substituents are at 1,2,3,4, so positions 5 and 6 are H. So H5 is next to substituent 4 (CH3) and H6. Similarly, H6 is next to substituent 1 (CH3) and H5. Are their environments the same? Let me think about the symmetry. If I look at the molecule, rotating 180 degrees would swap substituent 1 with 4, and 2 with 3, and H5 would swap with H6. So H5 and H6 would be in the same environment, making their H's equivalent. Hence, this compound would have a singlet in the aromatic region. So 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene would contribute a singlet.

Option 4: 1,4-diethylbenzene. Substituents at 1 and 4 (ethyl groups). So the free positions are 2,3,5,6. Wait, wait, in benzene, substituents at 1 and 4 are para positions. So the substituents are at 1 and 4, each with an ethyl group. So the aromatic H's would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Are any of these H's equivalent?

Wait, in 1,4-diethylbenzene, the molecule has a high symmetry, perhaps. The substituents at 1 and 4 are para, so the molecule is symmetric across the axis through positions 1 and 4. So, positions 2 and 6 are mirror images. Similarly, positions 3 and 5 are mirror images. So H2 and H6 are equivalent, and H3 and H5 are equivalent. So that would give two sets of equivalent H's, each as a doublet or something else. Wait, but what's the actual splitting?

Wait, in 1,4-diethylbenzene, the aromatic H's at positions 2 and 6 are equivalent, and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent. So their environments are the same, leading to two sets of equivalent H's. How would that appear in the NMR?

Each set (H2 and H6, H3 and H5) would be a doublet due to coupling with adjacent H's. Or perhaps they are each a singlet if the coupling is not observed. Wait, but that depends on the coupling.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR. The question says two signals in the aromatic region. So each compound must have only one set of equivalent H's, each contributing a singlet. So 1,4-diethylbenzene would have two sets of H's: H2/H6 and H3/H5, each as a doublet (if coupled), but that would split into two signals, each a doublet. But the NMR shows two singlets. So this would not fit, because option 4 (the diethyl compound) would have two signals in the aromatic region, but the NMR shows only two signals, one per compound. So if both compounds have only one aromatic singlet each, then the mixture would have two singlets. So if one of the compounds is diethylbenzene, it would contribute two signals, which would cause the NMR to have more than two signals, so that's not possible. Therefore, the mixture cannot include diethylbenzene.

Wait, but the question says that the mixture has two signals in the aromatic region, each a singlet, and the other signals are in the aliphatic region. So the diethyl compound can't be part of the mixture because it would have two signals in the aromatic region, leading to more than two signals in total. So the correct mixture must consist of two tetramethyl compounds, each contributing a singlet in the aromatic region.

So looking at the options, the possible options are those that are tetramethylbenzenes.

Now, looking at the options A, B, D involve tetramethyl compounds. Option C includes diethylbenzene, which we've determined can't be part of the correct answer.

So options A, B, D are possible.

Now, the aliphatic region: three signals at around 2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio. All singlets.

So each compound in the mixture contributes some aliphatic protons, and their NMR signals add up. The ratio is 2:1:1, meaning that across the two compounds, the aliphatic signals are in that ratio.

Each tetramethyl compound would have four CH3 groups, but perhaps in some symmetric arrangement leading to fewer signals.

Wait, let's think about each compound's aliphatic protons.

For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,4,5.

Let me sketch this: substituents are at positions 1,2,4,5. So, the four methyl groups are attached at those positions. Are any of these methyl groups equivalent due to symmetry?

Looking at the structure, substituents at 1 and 4 are para to each other, and substituents at 2 and 5 are also para. Because in a benzene ring, positions 1 and 4 are opposite (para), as are positions 2 and 5.

So, the methyl groups at 1 and 4 would be in equivalent environments, and similarly, methyl groups at 2 and 5 would be in equivalent environments. So each pair would be a singlet. So for this compound, the CH3 groups would split into two signals: one from the methyl at 1 and 4 (equivalent), another from the methyl at 2 and 5 (equivalent). Thus, the aliphatic region would have two singlets: one integrating to 2 H (since two methyl groups, each with 3 H, but wait, wait no.

Wait, no. Each methyl group has three H. So for 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent, and each has three H. So their signal would integrate to 6 H. Similarly, the methyl groups at 2 and 5 are equivalent, each with 3 H, so their signal would be 6 H. So in the NMR, this compound would show two singlets in the aliphatic region, integrating as 6 H each.

Wait, but in the question's data, the aliphatic signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio. That suggests three signals, all singlets, with ratios 2:1:1. So if each of the two compounds contributes certain signals, the combined signals would sum to 2:1:1.

Wait, but if the first compound contributes two singlets (each 6 H), and the second contributes something else, perhaps a single singlet of 3 H, then the total aliphatic signals would be 6 (from first), 6 (from first), and 3 (from second) â€” but that's three signals, but the ratios would be 6:6:3 â†’ simplifying, 2:2:1. But the question says the ratio is 2:1:1.

Hmm, that's a problem. Let me think again.

Alternate approach: each aliphatic signal comes from the same type of CH3 group across both compounds. So let's see how each option's aliphatic signals would look.

Option A: 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl and 1,2,3,5-tetramethyl.

So for each compound:

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,4.

Are the methyl groups equivalent? Let's see. The substituents are in a row. So positions 1,2,3,4. Are any of the methyl groups equivalent?

Well, the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are para to each other, but in this substitution pattern. Wait, in 1,2,3,4-tetra, the substituents are in a row of four. So the methyl at 1 and 4 are adjacent to different substituents. Hmm, perhaps this isn't symmetric enough to have equivalent CH3 groups.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has some symmetry. Let me think: substituents at 1,2,3,4. So, positions 1,2,3,4 are all methyl. The molecule would have a certain symmetry. Maybe the methyl groups at 1 and 4 are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry. Similarly, methyl groups at 2 and 3 might be equivalent.

So in this case, the aliphatic region would have two singlets: one from the methyl groups at 1 and 4 (equivalent, each 3 H, so total 6 H), and another from methyl groups at 2 and 3 (each 3 H, total 6 H). So this would give two aliphatic signals, each integrating to 6 H.

Similarly, the other compound in option A is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene. Let's see the symmetry here. Substituents at 1,2,3,5. Are any CH3 groups equivalent?

Wait, substituents at 1,2,3,5. So, position 4 is free. Let me think about whether any methyl groups are equivalent. For example, methyl at 1 and 2: position 1 is adjacent to substituents at 2 and 6 (no, 6 is H). Wait, perhaps the methyl groups at 1,2,3,5 are arranged such that some are equivalent. Alternatively, perhaps this structure has no equivalent CH3 groups, leading to four singlets in the aliphatic region.

Wait, that would complicate the NMR. So perhaps option A is not correct.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Each of these compounds would have their own aliphatic signals.

First, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: as discussed earlier, two sets of equivalent CH3 groups: 1 and 4 (each 3 H, 6 H total), and 2 and 5 (each 3 H, 6 H total). So aliphatic signals would be two singlets, each 6 H.

The other compound in option D is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Substituents at 1,2,3,5. So the positions 4 and 6 are free.

Looking for symmetry, perhaps some CH3 groups are equivalent.

Let me imagine the structure. Substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So CH3 at 1 is adjacent to substituents at 2 and 6 (but 6 is H). CH3 at 2 is adjacent to substituents at 1 and 3. CH3 at 3 is adjacent to substituents at 2 and 4 (which is H). CH3 at 5 is adjacent to substituents at 4 and 6 (but 4 is H). Are any of these methyl groups equivalent? It's not obvious. It's possible that none are equivalent, leading to four singlets in the aliphatic region. But that would mean four aliphatic signals, which can't fit the 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps this is not the correct option.

Option B: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene.

So let's see their aliphatic signals.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: two aliphatic signals, each 6 H (as discussed).

1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene: as discussed, two aliphatic signals, each 6 H.

If these two are mixed in a 1:1 ratio, the aliphatic signals would be the sum of their individual signals. So for 1,2,4,5, the two signals would be 6 H each. For 1,2,3,4, the two signals would be 6 H each.

So when mixed, the NMR would have four aliphatic signals, each 6 H, which doesn't match the given data of three signals in 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the two compounds have some overlapping aliphatic signals, leading to fewer peaks. For example, if one of the aliphatic signals from each compound is the same.

Wait, let's think again about the aliphatic region. The NMR shows three signals: two: 2:1:1. So perhaps one of the compounds has a singlet integrating to 6 H (two CH3 groups), and another compound has a singlet integrating to 3 H, and another singlet integrating to 3 H. Wait, but that would require the two compounds to have a combination of CH3 groups that sum to 6+3+3=12 H, but each compound has 4 CH3 groups (each 3 H) â†’ 12 H per compound. So in a 1:1 mixture, total aliphatic H would be 24, which is correct.

But how does that fit the 2:1:1 ratio?

Wait, the aliphatic signals in the NMR are in a 2:1:1 ratio. So combining the two compounds, the sum of the signals would be 2:1:1.

Suppose one compound contributes a singlet of 6 H and another singlet of 6 H. The other compound contributes a singlet of 3 H and another of 3 H. But that would give four signals, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps one compound has two sets of CH3 groups: two singlets, each 6 H. The other compound has three sets: but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the other compound has three CH3 groups, but that's not possible because all options have four CH3 groups.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about each compound's aliphatic signals.

If a compound's aliphatic protons are split into two or more signals, each as singlets, then when mixed, the total would be the sum. So perhaps the two compounds have their aliphatic signals in such a way that when combined, they form three signals with the ratio 2:1:1.

Let me think about each possible option.

Option D: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene's aliphatic signals: two singlets, each 6 H.

1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene's aliphatic signals: perhaps four singlets, each 3 H. But that would lead to 2 +4=6 signals, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene has some equivalent CH3 groups. Let me re-examine.

In 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,5.

Are any of the CH3 groups equivalent?

Let me think about symmetry. If I rotate the molecule 120 degrees, would any CH3 groups overlap? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps there's a plane of symmetry that makes some CH3 groups equivalent.

Wait, substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So, positions 4 and 6 are free. Let me see: substituent at 1 is adjacent to 2 and 6. Substituent at 2 is adjacent to 1 and 3. Substituent at 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4. Substituent at 5 is adjacent to 4 and 6.

Is there any symmetry here that makes any CH3 groups equivalent? Maybe CH3 at 1 and 5 are equivalent? Or CH3 at 2 and 3 are equivalent?

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes CH3 at 1 and 5 equivalent, and CH3 at 2 and 3 equivalent. Let me imagine: the plane might be through the center of the ring, passing between positions 4 and 6. So, CH3 at 1 and 5 would be mirror images, hence equivalent. Similarly, CH3 at 2 and 3 would also be mirror images if the mirror plane is such. In that case, the aliphatic signals would be two singlets: one for CH3 at 1 and 5 (each 3 H, 6 H total), and another for CH3 at 2 and 3 (each 3 H, 6 H total). So same as the first compound in option D.

Wait, then in option D, each of the two compounds would have two aliphatic signals, each 6 H. So the mixture would have four aliphatic signals, each integrating to 6 H, which doesn't fit the given 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think differently.

Wait, the NMR shows three aliphatic signals in a 2:1:1 ratio. So perhaps one signal is 6 H (two CH3 groups), another is 3 H (one CH3), and another is 3 H (another CH3). So how can the two compounds contribute to this?

Suppose one compound contributes a 6 H singlet (two CH3 groups) and a 6 H singlet (another two CH3 groups). The other compound contributes a 3 H singlet and a 3 H singlet. Then the combined signals would be 6 (from first), 6 (from first), 3 (from second), 3 (from second). But when mixed in a 1:1 ratio, the integration would be 6, 6, 3,3. Summing, the ratios would be 6:6:3:3 â†’ 2:2:1:1. But the question states only three signals, so perhaps some signals overlap.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the compounds has two aliphatic signals (each 6 H), and the other has three aliphatic signals (each 3 H), but that's not possible since each compound has four methyl groups. Wait, four CH3 groups would contribute either two signals (each two CH3) or four signals (each CH3 unique).

Wait, perhaps one of the compounds has two CH3 groups that are equivalent (two singlets, each 6 H) and the other compound has three CH3 groups that are equivalent in a way that one is 6 H and the others sum to 3 H. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the integration ratios. The aliphatic signals are in a 2:1:1 ratio, meaning the three signals have H counts proportional to 2,1,1.

So, for a 1:1 mixture:

- The first signal would be 2 parts, so 2 units (each unit being 3 H from a CH3 group).
- The second and third signals would be 1 unit each.

Wait, but each unit corresponds to what? Let me think: the integration is in the ratio 2:1:1. So, the total aliphatic H from both compounds would be 2+1+1 =4 units. Each unit corresponds to X H.

But each compound has four CH3 groups, which is 4*(3 H) =12 H. So two compounds would have 24 H in total. So 4 units =24 H â†’ each unit is 6 H. So the signals would be 2*6=12 H, 6 H, and 6 H. So the aliphatic signals would have integrations of 12, 6, and 6.

So, the mixture must have three aliphatic signals: one integrating to 12 H (2 units), and two integrating to 6 H each (1 unit each).

So, how can the two compounds' aliphatic signals sum to 12, 6, and 6?

Let me look at the options again.

Option D: two compounds, each with two aliphatic signals of 6 H each.

So their mixture would contribute 12 H (from each 6+6 in each compound, but in a 1:1 ratio). Wait, no. Each compound contributes two singlets of 6 H each. So in the mixture, each of these would appear as two signals at 6 H each for each compound. Since the mixture is 1:1, the signals would be 6 (from first) and 6 (from second) for each aliphatic group. But that would give two signals, each 6 H, from each compound. So the total would be four signals, each 6 H, which doesn't fit the 12,6,6 scenario.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Let's think about which options' aliphatic signals could combine to give 12,6,6.

For example, one compound has two aliphatic signals: 6 H and 6 H. The other compound has three aliphatic signals: but wait, four CH3 groups can't split into three signals. So perhaps the other compound has one aliphatic signal of 6 H and another of 6 H, but that would again require four signals.

Alternatively, perhaps one compound has two signals (each 6 H), and the other has a single signal of 6 H plus another two signals of 3 H each, but that's not possible because four CH3 groups can only make up to four signals.

Wait, perhaps the other compound has a singlet of 6 H and another singlet of 6 H, same as the first. But that would give four signals, each 6 H, which doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I'm missing the possibility that one of the aliphatic signals is split by coupling, but the question states they are all singlets.

Wait, perhaps one of the compounds has three equivalent methyl groups, contributing a 9 H singlet, but that's not possible because four CH3 groups can't sum to 9 H. Alternatively, perhaps one of the compounds has two pairs of equivalent CH3 groups, each pair contributing a 6 H singlet.

Let me think about option D again. Each compound in D has two aliphatic signals, each 6 H. So when mixed, the two 6 H signals from each compound would add up.

Wait, but in a 1:1 mixture, each signal would be present as 6 H from each compound. But if the two CH3 types are the same in both compounds, their signals would overlap, leading to a single 12 H peak for each.

But that's not the case. So perhaps the aliphatic signals from each compound are different, leading to four peaks. But the NMR only shows three.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Perhaps I should consider which options have aliphatic signals that, when combined, give three signals in a 2:1:1 ratio.

Wait, another approach: the three aliphatic signals are at 2.2 ppm, all singlets.

If the aliphatic region has three singlets in a 2:1:1 ratio, then perhaps one of the compounds has two singlets, and the other has one singlet. Or perhaps each compound contributes to two of the signals, and one is from both.

Wait, but each compound has four CH3 groups. Let me think about the possible aliphatic signals each could contribute.

Let me consider option D again: 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

For 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene:

- The methyl groups at positions 1 and 4 are equivalent, contributing a singlet of 6 H.
- The methyl groups at positions 2 and 5 are equivalent, contributing a singlet of 6 H.

So in option D, the first compound contributes two aliphatic singlets (6 H each).

The second compound in option D is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Let me reevaluate this structure's symmetry. Substituents are at 1,2,3,5.

Looking for symmetry, perhaps the methyl groups at 1 and 5 are equivalent, and the methyl groups at 2 and 3 are equivalent.

If that's the case, then the aliphatic region would have two singlets: one from 1 and 5 (6 H), and another from 2 and 3 (6 H).

So the NMR would have four aliphatic signals: two from each compound, each 6 H. But the question shows three signals, so perhaps this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the second compound in option D doesn't have any equivalent methyl groups, leading to four aliphatic signals. That would complicate the NMR even more.

Wait, perhaps the second compound (1,2,3,5) has two pairs of equivalent methyl groups, but I'm not seeing it. Alternatively, perhaps it has methyl groups at 1 and 3 that are equivalent, and those at 2 and 5 are equivalent.

Wait, in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes methyl at 1 and 3 equivalent, and methyl at 2 and 5 equivalent.

If that's the case, then the aliphatic signals would be two singlets: 6 H (from 1 and 3) and 6 H (from 2 and 5).

So in option D, each compound contributes two aliphatic signals, each 6 H. So the mixture would have four signals, each 6 H, which doesn't match the 2:1:1 ratio.

Hmm. Perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the aliphatic region's integration.

The aliphatic signals sum to 2:1:1, so 12, 6, 6.

So, perhaps one compound contributes a singlet of 12 H, and the other contributes two singlets of 6 H each. But each CH3 group is 3 H, so 12 H would imply four equivalent CH3 groups. But that's only possible if all four CH3 groups are equivalent, which would require a very symmetric structure.

Which of the options have all four CH3 groups equivalent?

Looking at the options:

- 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: The substituents are at 1,2,4,5. If the molecule is symmetric enough, all four CH3 groups could be equivalent. Wait, is that possible?

In such a structure, perhaps the four CH3 groups are all in the same environment. Let me imagine: substituents at 1,2,4,5. So, the molecule would have a center of symmetry, making all four CH3 groups equivalent. If that's the case, the aliphatic region would have a single singlet of 12 H.

If that's true, then the first compound would contribute a 12 H singlet, and the second compound would contribute two singlets, each 6 H. So the mixture would have three signals: 12,6,6, in a 2:1:1 ratio when considering the integration.

So, which option has one compound with all four CH3 groups equivalent and another with two sets of two equivalent CH3 groups.

Looking at the options, perhaps option D is the case.

Wait, let me check the structures again.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,4,5.

If the molecule has a center of symmetry, then substituents are arranged such that each CH3 group is equivalent. For example, substituents at 1 and 5 are across from each other, and substituents at 2 and 4 are across from each other. So, all four CH3 groups would be in the same environment, leading to a single aliphatic singlet of 12 H.

If that's the case, then the first compound (1,2,4,5-tetramethyl) would contribute a 12 H singlet. The second compound in option D is 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene.

Wait, but earlier I thought that 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene would have two sets of equivalent CH3 groups, each as 6 H. So the mixture would have:

- 12 H (from first compound)
- 6 H (from second compound's first set)
- 6 H (from second compound's second set)

So the aliphatic signals would be 12,6,6 â†’ which is a 2:1:1 ratio. That matches the given data.

So in this case, the two compounds would be 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene (contributing a 12 H singlet) and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene (contributing two 6 H singlets).

Wait, but how does the aromatic region fit? Each of these two compounds must contribute a singlet in the aromatic region.

1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: as discussed, has two equivalent aromatic H's, so a singlet.

1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: substituents at 1,2,3,5. Are the aromatic H's equivalent?

Wait, substituents are at 1,2,3,5. So, the free positions are 4 and 6. Are H4 and H6 equivalent?

Let me think about the structure. Substituents at 1,2,3,5. H4 is next to substituents at 3 and 5. H6 is next to substituents at 1 and 5.

Wait, are these environments the same? If the molecule has a plane of symmetry that makes H4 and H6 equivalent, then they would be a singlet. Let me imagine: perhaps the molecule has a mirror plane that reflects positions 4 and 6. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a rotational symmetry that makes H4 and H6 equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps in 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene, the two H's are not equivalent, leading to two aromatic signals. But the NMR shows only one aromatic signal per compound, so this can't be the case.

Hmm, perhaps the aromatic H's are in the same environment. Let me think again. If substituents are at 1,2,3,5, then the two H's are at 4 and 6. Are their environments the same?

Each H at 4 is adjacent to substituents at 3 and 5. H at 6 is adjacent to substituents at 1 and 5.

Wait, substituent at 5 is adjacent to H4 and H6. So substituent at 5 is a CH3, adjacent to both H4 and H6. Substituent at 1 is adjacent to H6 and H2. Substituent at 2 is adjacent to H1 and H3. Substituent at 3 is adjacent to H2 and H4.

Hmm, perhaps the H's at 4 and 6 are in the same environment due to the symmetry. Let me imagine the molecule: substituents are at 1,2,3,5. If I rotate the molecule 180 degrees, would substituent 1 and 5 swap, and substituent 2 and 3 swap? Perhaps that would make H4 and H6 equivalent.

If that's the case, then the aromatic H's would be a singlet. So this option would fit.

So putting it all together, option D would have:

- 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene: aromatic singlet (integrate to 2 H), aliphatic singlet (12 H).
- 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene: aromatic singlet (integrate to 2 H), aliphatic two signals (6 H each).

So in the mixture, the aromatic region would have two singlets (each 2 H), matching the 1:1 ratio.

The aliphatic region would have three signals: 12 H (from first compound), 6 H (from second compound's first set), and 6 H (from second compound's second set), giving a 2:1:1 ratio.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D.


The question involves identifying two aromatic compounds in a 1:1 mixture based on their 1H NMR data. The molecular formula of each compound is C10H14, and the NMR data shows two aromatic singlets at ~6.7 ppm (1:1 ratio) and three aliphatic singlets at ~2.2 ppm (2:1:1 ratio). The options provided are various tetramethylbenzenes and a diethylbenzene.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Molecular Formula and Substitution Patterns**:
   - Each compound is C10H14, which corresponds to a benzene ring (C6H6) with four methyl groups (C4H8). This matches the tetramethylbenzenes and the diethylbenzene in the options.
   - The diethylbenzene (C10H14) has two ethyl groups, but its aromatic region would show two signals (not singlets), which does not match the NMR data. Thus, the diethylbenzene is ruled out.

2. **Aromatic Region**:
   - The NMR shows two aromatic singlets at ~6.7 ppm, each integrating to 2 H. This indicates that each compound has only one type of aromatic proton, which must be equivalent due to symmetry.
   - **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene**: Substituents at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 leave positions 3 and 6 free. These two aromatic protons are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry, resulting in a single aromatic singlet.
   - **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene**: Substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, and 5 leave positions 4 and 6 free. These two aromatic protons are also equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry, resulting in a single aromatic singlet.
   - **1,2,3,4-Tetramethylbenzene**: Substituents at positions 1, 2, 3, and 4 leave positions 5 and 6 free. These two aromatic protons are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry, resulting in a single aromatic singlet.

3. **Aliphatic Region**:
   - The NMR shows three aliphatic singlets at ~2.2 ppm in a 2:1:1 ratio, corresponding to 12 H, 6 H, and 6 H. This suggests that one compound has all four methyl groups equivalent (contributing 12 H as a single singlet), and the other compound has two sets of equivalent methyl groups (contributing 6 H each).

4. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A (1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene)**:
     - Both compounds have two aliphatic signals each (6 H each), leading to four aliphatic signals in total. This does not match the 2:1:1 ratio.
   - **Option B (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,4-tetramethylbenzene)**:
     - Both compounds have two aliphatic signals each (6 H each), leading to four aliphatic signals in total. This does not match the 2:1:1 ratio.
   - **Option C (1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,4-diethylbenzene)**:
     - The diethylbenzene would produce two aromatic signals, which contradicts the NMR data. This option is ruled out.
   - **Option D (1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene and 1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene)**:
     - **1,2,4,5-Tetramethylbenzene**: All four methyl groups are equivalent due to symmetry, producing a single aliphatic singlet of 12 H.
     - **1,2,3,5-Tetramethylbenzene**: Two sets of equivalent methyl groups (positions 1/5 and 2/3), producing two aliphatic singlets of 6 H each.
     - The aliphatic signals combine to give a 2:1:1 ratio (12 H, 6 H, 6 H), matching the NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The two compounds in the mixture are **1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene** and **1,2,3,5-tetramethylbenzene**. These compounds satisfy both the aromatic and aliphatic NMR data.
