Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember stability constants are involved in determining the predominant form of a complex in solution. Let me try to think this through.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. They're asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's the structure here? Co with SCN- forms complexes. The blue ones are probably the ones with more SCN- attached. I think the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ complexes, like Co(SCN)_4]^2- maybe? Or wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN- attached. So like [Co(SCN)_2]^something.

Stability constants, β, tell us how stable a complex is. Higher β means more stable. So each β corresponds to a complex. Let's see: β1 is 9, β2 is 40, β3 is 63, β4 is 16. So the complexes are Co(SCN)^n with n=1,2,3,4? Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, the order of β is for each step. So β1 is for the first association, β2 is for the second, etc.

Wait, maybe the complexes are CoSCN^+, then Co(SCN)_2, then Co(SCN)_3, then Co(SCN)_4^2-. So the stability constants are cumulative. So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ is the product of the first n β values.

Wait, no, each β is for adding one SCN- to the previous complex. So β1 is K1 = [Co(SCN)]+ / ([Co^2+][SCN-]). Then β2 is [Co(SCN)_2] / ([Co(SCN)]+ [SCN-]). So the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2] would be β1*β2.

Wait that's correct. Because each β represents the stepwise addition of a ligand. So the overall K for the complex with n ligands is the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, but what about the charge? Let me think. Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So [Co(SCN)]+ would be Co+ with one SCN- attached? No, wait. Co^2+ + SCN- → CoSCN^+ (since 2+ + -1 = +1 charge). That's the first complex. The second would be Co(SCN)_2, which would be neutral since 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. The third would be [Co(SCN)_3]^-1, and the fourth [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But I'm not entirely sure if the charge matters for the stability constants, but I think it does in terms of the overall formation.

So the problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the Co(SCN)_2 complex, neutral. So the complex with two SCN- attached.

So the approach is to consider all possible species of cobalt in solution, which are:

Co^2+ (the free ion),
CoSCN^+,
Co(SCN)_2,
Co(SCN)_3^-,
Co(SCN)_4^2-.

Wait, but the problem states that the total cobalt concentration c(Co) is 1e-2 M. That would be the sum of all these species. So the sum [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-] = 1e-2 M.

But the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato species, which is [Co(SCN)_2]. So we need to compute the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2] over the total cobalt concentration.

Alternatively, since the total cobalt is given, perhaps we can compute the concentrations of each species in terms of the formation constants and the ligand concentration.

The ligand concentration [SCN-] is 0.1 M, which is quite high. High ligand concentration would favor the formation of complexes with more ligands attached. So higher complexes (like Co(SCN)_4^2-) would be more prevalent. But the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is the second one.

Wait, but the stability constants vary. Let's look at the β values:

β1 =9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, so each step's β is as follows. The first complex (CoSCN^+) has β1=9. The second (Co(SCN)_2) has β2=40. The third has β3=63, and the fourth β4=16.

Wait, so the third complex (Co(SCN)_3^-) has a higher β than the second, but the fourth (Co(SCN)_4^2-) has lower β than the third.

So the trend is β increases up to the third and then decreases. That might mean that the most stable complex is the third one, but the fourth is less stable.

But the ligand is in excess (0.1 M). So perhaps the higher complexes are more favored.

Let me think about how to model the concentrations.

The general approach for such problems is to use the stability constants and the ligand concentration to compute the fraction of each complex.

The formula for the concentration of the n-th complex is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β_n * [Co^{2+}] * [SCN-]^n / (1 + β1 [SCN-] + β1 β2 [SCN-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN-]^3 + ... )

Wait, no. Wait, the fraction of each species can be found by considering the cumulative formation constants.

Alternatively, for each species, the concentration is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = (β1 β2 ... βn) [Co^2+] [SCN-]^n / (1 + β1 [SCN-] + β1 β2 [SCN-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN-]^3 + ... )

Wait, I think that's the case. Because each subsequent species is built upon the previous one.

So the denominator is the sum of all possible species, each weighted by their respective formation constants multiplied by the ligand concentrations to the appropriate power.

So the fraction of each species is (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN-]^n) divided by the sum from m=0 to 4 of (β1 β2 ... βm [SCN-]^m).

Wait, wait. Let me clarify.

Let me define K_m as the overall stability constant for the complex with m ligands. So K_1 = β1, K_2=β1 β2, K_3 = β1 β2 β3, K_4=β1 β2 β3 β4.

Wait no. Wait, each β is the stepwise formation constant. So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ is K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

But in this case, the βs are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So:

K1 = β1 =9

K2= β1 β2 = 9*40=360

K3=9*40*63=9*40=360; 360*63=22680

K4=9*40*63*16= 22680*16= 362880.

Wait, wait a minute. That can't be right. Because if β4 is 16, which is smaller than β3, that would mean that the fourth complex is less stable than the third.

So the overall K for each complex is K1=9, K2=360, K3=22680, K4=362880.

Wait no, wait, if K4 is 9*40*63*16, that's correct.

But wait, the ligand concentration is 0.1 M, which is relatively high. So the higher complexes (like K4) may have higher concentrations.

But the problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is K2.

So the fraction f_n of each complex is given by:

f_n = (K_n [SCN-]^n) / (sum_{m=0}^4 (K_m [SCN-]^m) )

Wait, but wait! For m=0, that's the free Co^2+ ion. So what's its K? Since K0 is 1 (because it's the free ion), so K0=1.

So the denominator becomes 1 + [SCN-]^1 * K1 + [SCN-]^2 * K2 + [SCN-]^3 * K3 + [SCN-]^4 * K4.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Each complex [Co(SCN)_n] is formed from the previous by adding an SCN-.

The concentration of each complex is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = (K_n [Co^2+][SCN-]^n) / (1 + K1 [SCN-] + K2 [SCN-]^2 + K3 [SCN-]^3 + K4 [SCN-]^4 )

Wait, no, more accurately, the general formula for the fraction of each species is:

fraction_n = (K_n [SCN-]^n) / (sum_{m=0}^4 (K_m [SCN-]^m) ) )

Where K_0 =1 for the free ion.

So for n=0: fraction_0 = 1 / denominator.

n=1: K1 [SCN]^1 / denominator.

n=2: K2 [SCN]^2 / denominator.

Etc.

So let's compute each term.

Given that [SCN-] = 0.1 M.

Compute denominator D = sum from m=0 to 4 of ( K_m * [SCN]^m )

Compute each term:

m=0: K0 * [SCN]^0 = 1 * 1 =1.

m=1: K1 * [SCN]^1 =9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

m=2: K2 * (0.1)^2 =360 *0.01=3.6.

m=3: K3*(0.1)^3=22680 * 0.001=22.68.

m=4: K4*(0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

So summing all these terms:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So denominator D=64.468.

Wait, but wait a minute. Wait, 1 + 0.9 = 1.9; 1.9 +3.6=5.5; 5.5 +22.68=28.18; 28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

Now, the fraction for n=2 (the dithiocyanato complex) is (K2 [SCN]^2 ) / D.

Which is 3.6 /64.468.

Compute 3.6 /64.468: let's see.

3.6 ÷64.468 ≈ 0.05557, which is about 5.557%.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options are much higher. The highest option is 42.3% (A), but this calculation suggests less than 6% for the dithiocyanato complex.

Hmm. That doesn't make sense because the options are much higher. Did I make a mistake in the approach?

Wait, maybe I messed up the way the stability constants are defined. Could the β be for the formation of [Co(SCN)_n] from the previous complex?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the β values are given as the overall stability constants for each complex, not the stepwise ones. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2], etc. That would change things.

But the question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16."

Wait, so each β represents the overall stability constant for that complex. So, for [CoSCN]^+, β1=9.

[Co(SCN)_2], β2=40.

Wait, but that doesn't fit with the standard definition, where each β is the stepwise addition. Hmm.

But if that's the case, then the overall formation constants would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the β's are the log values? No, the numbers given don't seem to fit log values. For example, β1=9 would correspond to a K of 10^9? That's a very high K, which would imply a very stable complex.

Wait, wait, maybe the β values are the log of the stability constants. But the numbers given (like β1=9) would imply K=1e9, which is extremely high. But in reality, I think stability constants for such complexes are in the range of 1e3 to 1e5. So perhaps β is the log of the formation constant, so β= log K.

Wait, but the given β are 9,40, etc. Oh, wait, that can't be right because log K for such complexes is typically around 2-4 or so, not 9 or higher. So perhaps the β values are the actual formation constants, not the logs.

Alternatively, perhaps the question defines β as the overall formation constants for each complex. So, [CoSCN]^+ has K1=9, [Co(SCN)_2] has K2=40, [Co(SCN)_3] has K3=63, [Co(SCN)_4] has K4=16.

But that would mean the complexes form with K increasing up to the third, then decreasing. So the third complex (n=3) is the most stable.

But how would that affect the distribution?

Wait, I think the confusion arises from the definition of β. Some sources define β as the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands, others as the stepwise.

Given the problem statement, it's unclear. But given the problem's phrasing, perhaps each β is the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2], etc.

If that's the case, then the approach would be different.

Let me try that approach.

In that case, the formation constants are:

K1=9 (for [CoSCN]^+),
K2=40 (for [Co(SCN)_2]),
K3=63 (for [Co(SCN)_3]),
K4=16 (for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-).

Wait, but K4=16 is less than K3=63. So the third complex is more stable than the fourth.

So in this scenario, the denominator would be the sum of each [Co(SCN)_n] multiplied by their K and [SCN]^n, plus the free Co^2+.

Wait, no, the fraction would be:

f_n = (K_n [SCN]^n) / (1 + K1 [SCN]^1 + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, no, because each K is the overall formation constant for that complex, so the concentration of each species is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = (K_n [Co^2+][SCN]^n ) / (1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but that would imply that each K_n is the formation constant for that specific complex, independent of the previous. But that's not correct because the formation is stepwise.

Hmm, maybe I should think of each K_n as the cumulative formation constant, so K1 is for the first complex, K2 is for the second, etc. So the way I first approached it is correct, with K2= K1*K2_step.

But given the confusion, perhaps the problem is using β as the stepwise formation constants. So, the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2] is K1*K2, etc.

Wait, but the initial approach gave me a very low fraction for [Co(SCN)_2], which doesn't match any option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking about the blue dithiocyanate complex, which is the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, the neutral one. But in my initial approach, with K2=360, and [SCN]=0.1, the fraction for n=2 is about 5.5%.

But the options are much higher. So perhaps I need to re-examine my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing K3 and K4.

Wait, let me re-calculate the denominator.

[SCN] =0.1 M.

Compute each term:

m=0: 1 *1 =1.

m=1: β1 *0.1 =9 *0.1=0.9.

m=2: β1 β2 * (0.1)^2 =9 *40 *0.01=3.6.

m=3: β1 β2 β3 * (0.1)^3=9*40*63 *0.001.

Compute 9*40=360, 360*63=22680. 22680 *0.001=22.68.

m=4: β1 β2 β3 β4 *0.1^4 =9*40*63*16 *0.0001.

Compute 9*40=360, 360 *63=22680, 22680 *16=362880. 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So denominator D=1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = 1 +0.9=1.9, +3.6=5.5, +22.68=28.18, +36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

So the fraction for n=2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05557 or ~5.56%.

But the options don't have this; the closest is D) 16.9%, but that's higher.

Hmm. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong. What else could be wrong?

Wait, maybe the problem is considering only the first four complexes, but perhaps the actual maximum is higher. Alternatively, perhaps the ligand concentration is so high that higher complexes are predominant, but the dithiocyanate is just one of them.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the possibility that the β values are not stepwise but overall.

Wait, if β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2], etc., then each K_n = β_n.

So K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

In that case, the denominator would be 1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4.

But wait, this would be a different denominator.

Compute each term:

[SCN]=0.1.

m=0:1.

m=1: K1*0.1=9*0.1=0.9.

m=2: K2*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

m=3: K3*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

m=4: K4*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Sum D=1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016= approximately 2.3646.

So the denominator is 2.3646.

The fraction for n=2 is K2*(0.1)^2 / D = (40 *0.01)/2.3646 =0.4 /2.3646≈0.169, or ~16.9%.

Which matches option D, 16.9%.

Ah, so in this case, the approach is correct. So the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but why did the first approach give me 5.5%? Because in the first approach, the K2 was 360, but here, with K2=40, the fraction is higher.

So the confusion arises from whether the β values are stepwise or overall. In the problem statement, it's stated that the βs are the stability constants of the complexes. So if the βs are the overall constants for each complex, then the approach where each K_n=β_n is correct, and the fraction is about 16.9%, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the βs are the stepwise formation constants, but perhaps I should consider that the complexes can only form up to [Co(SCN)_3]^- because β4 is lower.

Wait, but in the initial approach, the fraction was 5.5%, which doesn't fit any option.

So I think the correct approach is to treat each β as the overall formation constant for that complex. Thus, the fraction for n=2 is (40 *0.1^2) / (1 +9*0.1 +40 *0.01 +63 *0.001 + 16 *0.0001 )= (0.4) / (1+0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016)= 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, or 16.9%. Which is option D.

So the answer should be D) 16.9%.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2], among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the problem using the given stability constants and ligand concentration. The stability constants provided are β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, and β4 = 16, which are interpreted as the overall formation constants for the complexes [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, respectively. The ligand concentration is [SCN-] = 0.1 M.

The fraction of each cobalt species in solution is determined by the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{K_n [SCN-]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 K_m [SCN-]^m}
\]

where \( K_n = \beta_n \) is the stability constant for the complex with \( n \) ligands, and the denominator is the sum of all species, including the free cobalt ion (\( m = 0 \)).

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
The denominator is the sum of contributions from all species:
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + \beta_1 [SCN-] + \beta_2 [SCN-]^2 + \beta_3 [SCN-]^3 + \beta_4 [SCN-]^4
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( \beta_1 [SCN-] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( \beta_2 [SCN-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \)
- \( \beta_3 [SCN-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \)
- \( \beta_4 [SCN-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

Summing these terms:
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Compute the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]
The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)_2], is given by:
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [SCN-]^2}{\text{Denominator}}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
f_2 = \frac{40 \cdot (0.1)^2}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage
The percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] is:
\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2], among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about cobalt complexes and stability constants. Hmm, I remember stability constants are involved in determining the predominant form of a complex in solution. Let me try to think this through.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The total cobalt concentration is 1e-2 M, and the SCN- concentration is 0.1 M. The stability constants given are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. They're asking for the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes among all cobalt species.

Wait, what's the structure here? Co with SCN- forms complexes. The blue ones are probably the ones with more SCN- attached. I think the blue color is associated with the [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ complexes, like Co(SCN)_4]^2- maybe? Or wait, dithiocyanato would be two SCN- attached. So like [Co(SCN)_2]^something.

Stability constants, β, tell us how stable a complex is. Higher β means more stable. So each β corresponds to a complex. Let's see: β1 is 9, β2 is 40, β3 is 63, β4 is 16. So the complexes are Co(SCN)^n with n=1,2,3,4? Or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, the order of β is for each step. So β1 is for the first association, β2 is for the second, etc.

Wait, maybe the complexes are CoSCN^+, then Co(SCN)_2, then Co(SCN)_3, then Co(SCN)_4^2-. So the stability constants are cumulative. So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ is the product of the first n β values.

Wait, no, each β is for adding one SCN- to the previous complex. So β1 is K1 = [Co(SCN)]+ / ([Co^2+][SCN-]). Then β2 is [Co(SCN)_2] / ([Co(SCN)]+ [SCN-]). So the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2] would be β1*β2.

Wait that's correct. Because each β represents the stepwise addition of a ligand. So the overall K for the complex with n ligands is the product of β1 to βn.

Wait, but what about the charge? Let me think. Co^2+ has a +2 charge. Each SCN- is -1. So [Co(SCN)]+ would be Co+ with one SCN- attached? No, wait. Co^2+ + SCN- → CoSCN^+ (since 2+ + -1 = +1 charge). That's the first complex. The second would be Co(SCN)_2, which would be neutral since 2+ + 2*(-1) = 0. The third would be [Co(SCN)_3]^-1, and the fourth [Co(SCN)_4]^2-.

But I'm not entirely sure if the charge matters for the stability constants, but I think it does in terms of the overall formation.

So the problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is the Co(SCN)_2 complex, neutral. So the complex with two SCN- attached.

So the approach is to consider all possible species of cobalt in solution, which are:

Co^2+ (the free ion),
CoSCN^+,
Co(SCN)_2,
Co(SCN)_3^-,
Co(SCN)_4^2-.

Wait, but the problem states that the total cobalt concentration c(Co) is 1e-2 M. That would be the sum of all these species. So the sum [Co^2+] + [CoSCN^+] + [Co(SCN)_2] + [Co(SCN)_3^-] + [Co(SCN)_4^2-] = 1e-2 M.

But the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato species, which is [Co(SCN)_2]. So we need to compute the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2] over the total cobalt concentration.

Alternatively, since the total cobalt is given, perhaps we can compute the concentrations of each species in terms of the formation constants and the ligand concentration.

The ligand concentration [SCN-] is 0.1 M, which is quite high. High ligand concentration would favor the formation of complexes with more ligands attached. So higher complexes (like Co(SCN)_4^2-) would be more prevalent. But the question is about the dithiocyanato complex, which is the second one.

Wait, but the stability constants vary. Let's look at the β values:

β1 =9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16.

Wait, so each step's β is as follows. The first complex (CoSCN^+) has β1=9. The second (Co(SCN)_2) has β2=40. The third has β3=63, and the fourth β4=16.

Wait, so the third complex (Co(SCN)_3^-) has a higher β than the second, but the fourth (Co(SCN)_4^2-) has lower β than the third.

So the trend is β increases up to the third and then decreases. That might mean that the most stable complex is the third one, but the fourth is less stable.

But the ligand is in excess (0.1 M). So perhaps the higher complexes are more favored.

Let me think about how to model the concentrations.

The general approach for such problems is to use the stability constants and the ligand concentration to compute the fraction of each complex.

The formula for the concentration of the n-th complex is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = β_n * [Co^{2+}] * [SCN-]^n / (1 + β1 [SCN-] + β1 β2 [SCN-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN-]^3 + ... )

Wait, no. Wait, the fraction of each species can be found by considering the cumulative formation constants.

Alternatively, for each species, the concentration is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = (β1 β2 ... βn) [Co^2+] [SCN-]^n / (1 + β1 [SCN-] + β1 β2 [SCN-]^2 + β1 β2 β3 [SCN-]^3 + ... )

Wait, I think that's the case. Because each subsequent species is built upon the previous one.

So the denominator is the sum of all possible species, each weighted by their respective formation constants multiplied by the ligand concentrations to the appropriate power.

So the fraction of each species is (β1 β2 ... βn [SCN-]^n) divided by the sum from m=0 to 4 of (β1 β2 ... βm [SCN-]^m).

Wait, wait. Let me clarify.

Let me define K_m as the overall stability constant for the complex with m ligands. So K_1 = β1, K_2=β1 β2, K_3 = β1 β2 β3, K_4=β1 β2 β3 β4.

Wait no. Wait, each β is the stepwise formation constant. So the overall formation constant for [Co(SCN)_n]^m+ is K_n = β1 * β2 * ... * βn.

But in this case, the βs are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. So:

K1 = β1 =9

K2= β1 β2 = 9*40=360

K3=9*40*63=9*40=360; 360*63=22680

K4=9*40*63*16= 22680*16= 362880.

Wait, wait a minute. That can't be right. Because if β4 is 16, which is smaller than β3, that would mean that the fourth complex is less stable than the third.

So the overall K for each complex is K1=9, K2=360, K3=22680, K4=362880.

Wait no, wait, if K4 is 9*40*63*16, that's correct.

But wait, the ligand concentration is 0.1 M, which is relatively high. So the higher complexes (like K4) may have higher concentrations.

But the problem is to find the percentage of the dithiocyanato complex, which is K2.

So the fraction f_n of each complex is given by:

f_n = (K_n [SCN-]^n) / (sum_{m=0}^4 (K_m [SCN-]^m) )

Wait, but wait! For m=0, that's the free Co^2+ ion. So what's its K? Since K0 is 1 (because it's the free ion), so K0=1.

So the denominator becomes 1 + [SCN-]^1 * K1 + [SCN-]^2 * K2 + [SCN-]^3 * K3 + [SCN-]^4 * K4.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Each complex [Co(SCN)_n] is formed from the previous by adding an SCN-.

The concentration of each complex is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = (K_n [Co^2+][SCN-]^n) / (1 + K1 [SCN-] + K2 [SCN-]^2 + K3 [SCN-]^3 + K4 [SCN-]^4 )

Wait, no, more accurately, the general formula for the fraction of each species is:

fraction_n = (K_n [SCN-]^n) / (sum_{m=0}^4 (K_m [SCN-]^m) ) )

Where K_0 =1 for the free ion.

So for n=0: fraction_0 = 1 / denominator.

n=1: K1 [SCN]^1 / denominator.

n=2: K2 [SCN]^2 / denominator.

Etc.

So let's compute each term.

Given that [SCN-] = 0.1 M.

Compute denominator D = sum from m=0 to 4 of ( K_m * [SCN]^m )

Compute each term:

m=0: K0 * [SCN]^0 = 1 * 1 =1.

m=1: K1 * [SCN]^1 =9 * 0.1 = 0.9.

m=2: K2 * (0.1)^2 =360 *0.01=3.6.

m=3: K3*(0.1)^3=22680 * 0.001=22.68.

m=4: K4*(0.1)^4=362880 * 0.0001=36.288.

So summing all these terms:

1 + 0.9 =1.9

1.9 +3.6=5.5

5.5 +22.68=28.18

28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So denominator D=64.468.

Wait, but wait a minute. Wait, 1 + 0.9 = 1.9; 1.9 +3.6=5.5; 5.5 +22.68=28.18; 28.18 +36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

Now, the fraction for n=2 (the dithiocyanato complex) is (K2 [SCN]^2 ) / D.

Which is 3.6 /64.468.

Compute 3.6 /64.468: let's see.

3.6 ÷64.468 ≈ 0.05557, which is about 5.557%.

Wait, but that can't be right because the options are much higher. The highest option is 42.3% (A), but this calculation suggests less than 6% for the dithiocyanato complex.

Hmm. That doesn't make sense because the options are much higher. Did I make a mistake in the approach?

Wait, maybe I messed up the way the stability constants are defined. Could the β be for the formation of [Co(SCN)_n] from the previous complex?

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the β values are given as the overall stability constants for each complex, not the stepwise ones. So β1 is for [Co(SCN)]^+, β2 is for [Co(SCN)_2], etc. That would change things.

But the question says "stability constants of the cobalt(II) thiocyanato complexes are β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16."

Wait, so each β represents the overall stability constant for that complex. So, for [CoSCN]^+, β1=9.

[Co(SCN)_2], β2=40.

Wait, but that doesn't fit with the standard definition, where each β is the stepwise addition. Hmm.

But if that's the case, then the overall formation constants would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the β's are the log values? No, the numbers given don't seem to fit log values. For example, β1=9 would correspond to a K of 10^9? That's a very high K, which would imply a very stable complex.

Wait, wait, maybe the β values are the log of the stability constants. But the numbers given (like β1=9) would imply K=1e9, which is extremely high. But in reality, I think stability constants for such complexes are in the range of 1e3 to 1e5. So perhaps β is the log of the formation constant, so β= log K.

Wait, but the given β are 9,40, etc. Oh, wait, that can't be right because log K for such complexes is typically around 2-4 or so, not 9 or higher. So perhaps the β values are the actual formation constants, not the logs.

Alternatively, perhaps the question defines β as the overall formation constants for each complex. So, [CoSCN]^+ has K1=9, [Co(SCN)_2] has K2=40, [Co(SCN)_3] has K3=63, [Co(SCN)_4] has K4=16.

But that would mean the complexes form with K increasing up to the third, then decreasing. So the third complex (n=3) is the most stable.

But how would that affect the distribution?

Wait, I think the confusion arises from the definition of β. Some sources define β as the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands, others as the stepwise.

Given the problem statement, it's unclear. But given the problem's phrasing, perhaps each β is the overall formation constant for the complex with n ligands. So β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2], etc.

If that's the case, then the approach would be different.

Let me try that approach.

In that case, the formation constants are:

K1=9 (for [CoSCN]^+),
K2=40 (for [Co(SCN)_2]),
K3=63 (for [Co(SCN)_3]),
K4=16 (for [Co(SCN)_4]^2-).

Wait, but K4=16 is less than K3=63. So the third complex is more stable than the fourth.

So in this scenario, the denominator would be the sum of each [Co(SCN)_n] multiplied by their K and [SCN]^n, plus the free Co^2+.

Wait, no, the fraction would be:

f_n = (K_n [SCN]^n) / (1 + K1 [SCN]^1 + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, no, because each K is the overall formation constant for that complex, so the concentration of each species is given by:

[Co(SCN)_n] = (K_n [Co^2+][SCN]^n ) / (1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4 )

Wait, but that would imply that each K_n is the formation constant for that specific complex, independent of the previous. But that's not correct because the formation is stepwise.

Hmm, maybe I should think of each K_n as the cumulative formation constant, so K1 is for the first complex, K2 is for the second, etc. So the way I first approached it is correct, with K2= K1*K2_step.

But given the confusion, perhaps the problem is using β as the stepwise formation constants. So, the overall K for [Co(SCN)_2] is K1*K2, etc.

Wait, but the initial approach gave me a very low fraction for [Co(SCN)_2], which doesn't match any option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking about the blue dithiocyanate complex, which is the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex, the neutral one. But in my initial approach, with K2=360, and [SCN]=0.1, the fraction for n=2 is about 5.5%.

But the options are much higher. So perhaps I need to re-examine my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing K3 and K4.

Wait, let me re-calculate the denominator.

[SCN] =0.1 M.

Compute each term:

m=0: 1 *1 =1.

m=1: β1 *0.1 =9 *0.1=0.9.

m=2: β1 β2 * (0.1)^2 =9 *40 *0.01=3.6.

m=3: β1 β2 β3 * (0.1)^3=9*40*63 *0.001.

Compute 9*40=360, 360*63=22680. 22680 *0.001=22.68.

m=4: β1 β2 β3 β4 *0.1^4 =9*40*63*16 *0.0001.

Compute 9*40=360, 360 *63=22680, 22680 *16=362880. 362880 *0.0001=36.288.

So denominator D=1 +0.9 +3.6 +22.68 +36.288 = 1 +0.9=1.9, +3.6=5.5, +22.68=28.18, +36.288=64.468.

So D=64.468.

So the fraction for n=2 is 3.6 /64.468 ≈0.05557 or ~5.56%.

But the options don't have this; the closest is D) 16.9%, but that's higher.

Hmm. So perhaps my initial approach is wrong. What else could be wrong?

Wait, maybe the problem is considering only the first four complexes, but perhaps the actual maximum is higher. Alternatively, perhaps the ligand concentration is so high that higher complexes are predominant, but the dithiocyanate is just one of them.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think about the possibility that the β values are not stepwise but overall.

Wait, if β1 is the formation constant for [CoSCN]^+, β2 for [Co(SCN)_2], etc., then each K_n = β_n.

So K1=9, K2=40, K3=63, K4=16.

In that case, the denominator would be 1 + K1 [SCN] + K2 [SCN]^2 + K3 [SCN]^3 + K4 [SCN]^4.

But wait, this would be a different denominator.

Compute each term:

[SCN]=0.1.

m=0:1.

m=1: K1*0.1=9*0.1=0.9.

m=2: K2*(0.1)^2=40 *0.01=0.4.

m=3: K3*(0.1)^3=63 *0.001=0.063.

m=4: K4*(0.1)^4=16 *0.0001=0.0016.

Sum D=1 +0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016= approximately 2.3646.

So the denominator is 2.3646.

The fraction for n=2 is K2*(0.1)^2 / D = (40 *0.01)/2.3646 =0.4 /2.3646≈0.169, or ~16.9%.

Which matches option D, 16.9%.

Ah, so in this case, the approach is correct. So the percentage is 16.9%, which is option D.

Wait, but why did the first approach give me 5.5%? Because in the first approach, the K2 was 360, but here, with K2=40, the fraction is higher.

So the confusion arises from whether the β values are stepwise or overall. In the problem statement, it's stated that the βs are the stability constants of the complexes. So if the βs are the overall constants for each complex, then the approach where each K_n=β_n is correct, and the fraction is about 16.9%, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the βs are the stepwise formation constants, but perhaps I should consider that the complexes can only form up to [Co(SCN)_3]^- because β4 is lower.

Wait, but in the initial approach, the fraction was 5.5%, which doesn't fit any option.

So I think the correct approach is to treat each β as the overall formation constant for that complex. Thus, the fraction for n=2 is (40 *0.1^2) / (1 +9*0.1 +40 *0.01 +63 *0.001 + 16 *0.0001 )= (0.4) / (1+0.9 +0.4 +0.063 +0.0016)= 0.4 / 2.3646 ≈ 0.169, or 16.9%. Which is option D.

So the answer should be D) 16.9%.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2], among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we analyze the problem using the given stability constants and ligand concentration. The stability constants provided are β1 = 9, β2 = 40, β3 = 63, and β4 = 16, which are interpreted as the overall formation constants for the complexes [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3]^-, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2-, respectively. The ligand concentration is [SCN-] = 0.1 M.

The fraction of each cobalt species in solution is determined by the formula:

\[
f_n = \frac{K_n [SCN-]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 K_m [SCN-]^m}
\]

where \( K_n = \beta_n \) is the stability constant for the complex with \( n \) ligands, and the denominator is the sum of all species, including the free cobalt ion (\( m = 0 \)).

### Step 1: Compute the denominator
The denominator is the sum of contributions from all species:
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + \beta_1 [SCN-] + \beta_2 [SCN-]^2 + \beta_3 [SCN-]^3 + \beta_4 [SCN-]^4
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( \beta_1 [SCN-] = 9 \cdot 0.1 = 0.9 \)
- \( \beta_2 [SCN-]^2 = 40 \cdot (0.1)^2 = 40 \cdot 0.01 = 0.4 \)
- \( \beta_3 [SCN-]^3 = 63 \cdot (0.1)^3 = 63 \cdot 0.001 = 0.063 \)
- \( \beta_4 [SCN-]^4 = 16 \cdot (0.1)^4 = 16 \cdot 0.0001 = 0.0016 \)

Summing these terms:
\[
\text{Denominator} = 1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
\]

### Step 2: Compute the fraction of [Co(SCN)_2]
The fraction of the dithiocyanato complex, [Co(SCN)_2], is given by:
\[
f_2 = \frac{\beta_2 [SCN-]^2}{\text{Denominator}}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
f_2 = \frac{40 \cdot (0.1)^2}{2.3646} = \frac{0.4}{2.3646} \approx 0.169
\]

### Step 3: Convert to percentage
The percentage of [Co(SCN)_2] is:
\[
f_2 \times 100 = 0.169 \times 100 = 16.9\%
\]

### Final Answer
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2], among all cobalt-containing species is **16.9%**.
