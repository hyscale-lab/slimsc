Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a series of reactions, and from that, we need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, or C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups are part of molecular symmetry and point group theory, right?

First, I'll try to follow each reaction and see what each compound could be. Let's break down the reactions one by one.

Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C. What compounds react in an 8:1 ratio? Maybe something like sulfur reacting with something else. Wait, wait—bright red product. I remember that when metals react with certain gases, they form colored products. For example, sulfur trioxide is a solid, but when it reacts with water, it forms H2SO4. Oh, wait, but wait—maybe reaction C is something like an oxide. Let me think.

Wait, another thought: 8 equivalents. Maybe it's something like O2 reacting with a metal? Let's see. Suppose A is a metal, say iron, and B is oxygen. Iron oxide—could it be Fe3O4? Because Fe3O4 would have Fe in both +2 and +3 oxidation states. Let me check the stoichiometry. Fe3O4 has 3 Fe atoms and 4 O atoms. So, per Fe, it's 4/3 O per Fe. Hmm, but the reaction is 8 equivalents of B. So maybe each A takes 8 B's. So, A is Fe, B is O2? Then Fe + O2 → FeO? No, because FeO is not red. Wait, Fe3O4 is black, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the bright red product. I remember that when sodium reacts with something, it can form a red product. Or maybe it's a sulfide. Wait, another thought—sulfur. Sulfur (solid) reacting with something. But sulfur is bright yellow, not red. Oh, wait, maybe it's a different compound. Or perhaps it's a nitrate?

Wait, perhaps the bright red product is a transition metal sulfide or oxide. Alternatively, maybe it's an oxide of vanadium or chromium, which can have colored compounds. Let me think—vanadium(V) oxide is a red solid, but I'm not sure about the reaction.

Wait, another approach: the third reaction. C reacts with water to form A, plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C (the product from A and B) reacts with water, it gives back A along with two acids. One strong, one weak. Let's think about what that could be.

Strong acids are like HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak acids are like acetic acid, H3PO4, maybe. So, if C is something like a sulfate or nitrate, which when hydrolyzed gives a strong acid.

Wait, another thought: if C is a nitride, like Mg3N2. When Mg3N2 reacts with water, it produces Mg(OH)2 (which is a base, or maybe it's MgO and NH3?), but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, if C is a metal oxide, like Na2O. Na2O + H2O → 2NaOH, which is a strong base, not acid. Hmm, but the products are acids.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide. Suppose A is a metal, B is sulfur. So, solid A (say, Fe) reacts with 8 equivalents of S (but S is a solid, so maybe not). Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2, but I don't see how that would form a bright red product.

Wait, another angle: the second reaction. Product C reacts with gas D (2 equivalents) to form product E, which is extremely hazardous. Gas D—could be something like chlorine or another diatomic gas. Also, when C reacts with D, it produces E. Then, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So D + B → H, a solvent. Solvents could be something like H2O, ethanol, etc. Wait, but D is a gas. So D and B are gases reacting, forming a solvent.

Wait, D plus B in 1:1 ratio. So if B is O2, then D could be something like Cl2. O2 + Cl2 → ? But that forms ClO2 or something else? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is H2. H2 and O2 form H2O, which is a solvent. Oh, that makes sense. So D is H2. But wait, in reaction D + B → H (solvent), which would be H2O. So D is H2, B is O2. Then product H is H2O.

So, let's retrace. B is O2. So reaction 1 is A (solid) reacting with 8 equivalents O2 to form C (bright red). What solid reacts with O2 in a 8:1 ratio to form a red product? Hmm. Maybe it's a transition metal.

Wait, iron reacts with oxygen to form FeO, Fe3O4, or Fe2O3. Fe3O4 is black, FeO is black too. Fe2O3 is reddish. Oh! Fe2O3 is a reddish solid. So if A is Fe, and B is O2, then 8 moles of B per mole of A: Fe + O2 → Fe2O3.

Wait, the stoichiometry. Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3? Or what's the reaction? Let me write the balanced equation.

Fe reacts with O2 to form Fe2O3.

The balanced reaction is: 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3.

So the mole ratio is Fe to O2 is 4:3. But in the problem statement, it's 8 equivalents of B (O2) per 1 equivalent of A (Fe). So 8 moles of O2 per mole of Fe. But in the balanced equation, it's 3 moles of O2 per 4 moles Fe. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe the example isn't Fe and O2. Maybe another metal.

Wait, another metal. Let's think of something else. Maybe vanadium? Vanadium(V) oxide is bright yellow, but maybe another oxide. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide.

Wait, perhaps it's not a metal oxide. Let me think of another approach. The second reaction is C reacting with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E. D is a gas, and when it reacts with B (O2) in 1:1 ratio, it forms H, which is a solvent. So H is H2O, as above, meaning D is H2.

So, reaction 2: C + 2 H2 → E.

Wait, but H is a solvent, so H is H2O. So D is H2. So reaction 2 is C reacting with 2 H2 → E.

Hmm, what reacts with H2 to form something? Maybe a metal oxide reacting with H2 to form a metal and water. But E is extremely hazardous. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride, and reacting with H2 would form NH3 or something. Wait, but C reacting with water gives back A and two acids.

Let me think about reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So, if C is a nitride, like Ca3N2, then upon hydrolysis, it would produce NH3 (a weak base) and a hydroxide, which is a base. That doesn't fit because the products are acids.

Alternatively, if C is a sulfide, say PbS, but PbS is a crystalline solid, and I'm not sure about the reaction with water. Maybe not.

Wait, another idea: perhaps C is a metal hydride. For example, NaH reacts with water to form NaOH (strong base) and H2 gas. But in this case, the products are acids, so maybe not.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's try to approach it differently.

Let me think of the possible structures of E. The question is about the molecular symmetry of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, or C2v.

Symmetry groups are determined by the arrangement of atoms. For example, O2 has D∞h symmetry, water has C2v, and so on.

Wait, what if E is a diatomic molecule? Let's say E is O2, but that seems unlikely because O2 is a gas and not extremely hazardous. Alternatively, E could be a toxic gas like Cl2, but then D would be H2, and H would be H2O. But then, what is C in that case?

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's see what E is. The second reaction is C + 2 D → E. D is H2, so C + 2 H2 → E. So E could be a compound formed by combining C and H2. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide, and E is a metal.

But E is extremely hazardous. So, for example, if C is Fe3O4, and it reacts with H2, then Fe3O4 + 4 H2 → 3 Fe + 4 H2O. But Fe is a solid, maybe E is Fe, but that's not a gas, and not extremely hazardous in gaseous form.

Wait, another possibility: C is a metal oxide, and E is a metal, which is a solid, but the question says E is a product, perhaps a gas? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. Let's say C is Ca3N2. Reacting with H2 could produce CaH2 and NH3? Wait, but the reaction would be: Ca3N2 + H2 → 3 CaH2 + NH3. Then E would be CaH2 and NH3? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. Let's say C is FeS. Reacting with H2? Not sure about that reaction. FeS + H2 → ?

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbide. For example, CaC2. Reacting with H2 would produce CaH2 and C. But again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule with a certain symmetry. Let's think of diatomic molecules and their symmetry. For example:

- O2 has D∞h symmetry.
- Cl2 also has D∞h.
- O3 is C2v.
- H2 is D∞h.
- N2 is D∞h.
- CO is D∞h.

Wait, but E is extremely hazardous. So maybe E is something like Cl2 (chlorine gas), which is yellow-green and highly toxic. But if E is Cl2, then how did it form?

Let me backtrack. If E is Cl2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 H2 → Cl2. But that doesn't make sense because Cl2 is a diatomic element, and the reaction would need to produce it from H2 and C. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloride. Wait, but earlier steps...

Wait, let's think about reaction 3 again. C reacts with water to produce A plus two acids. One strong, one weak. So maybe C is a metal carbonyl? Or perhaps a nitrate.

Wait, another approach. If C is a nitride (like Na3N), when it reacts with water, it produces NH3 (weak base, not acid) and NaOH (strong base). But the problem says two acids, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. For example, if C is Al2S3. Reacting with water would give Al(OH)3 (which is amphoteric) and H2S, which is a weak acid. But Al(OH)3 isn't an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate. Wait, if C is Fe2(SO4)3. Then, when it reacts with water, maybe it doesn't decompose. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide that when hydrolyzed gives two different acids. Wait, that's tricky. How about if C is a mixed oxide. Let me think. For example, Pb3O4 is a dark red solid, and upon hydrolysis, it can form PbO2 (which is a strong oxidizing agent) and Pb(OH)2. Wait, but that's a base, not an acid.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride of a metal that when hydrolyzed gives a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, perhaps Ca3N2 reacting with H2O gives Ca(OH)2 and NH3. But again, those are a base and a weak base.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite. For instance, CaSO3. When it reacts with water, perhaps it hydrolyzes to Ca(OH)2 and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). But Ca(OH)2 is a base. So, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, Na2O2. When it reacts with water, it produces NaOH (strong base) and O2. But again, not acids.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should think of C as a metal oxide that, when reacting with H2, produces a metal and water, but E is the metal. But E is extremely hazardous. So maybe E is a metal like mercury or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is a compound with a high symmetry. Let's think about the possible symmetry groups.

The options are:

A) C2: This is a two-fold rotation axis. For example, H2O2 has C2 symmetry.

B) D4h: This is a dihedral group with a four-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirrors. For example, SO2 has D4h symmetry.

C) D∞h: This is a dihedral group with an infinite-fold rotation axis, like O2, Cl2, N2, etc.

D) C2v: A two-fold rotation axis with vertical mirror planes. For example, CO2 has D∞h, but H2O has C2v.

Wait, no—H2O actually has C2v symmetry. Because it's a bent molecule with a C2 axis and two mirror planes.

Wait, so if E is H2O, then its symmetry group is C2v. But the problem says E is extremely hazardous. H2O isn't hazardous, unless in large quantities. Hmm, so perhaps E isn't H2O.

Wait, other possibilities: If E is O3, which is a triatomic molecule with C2v symmetry. Ozone is a toxic gas, but I'm not sure if it's extremely hazardous. Also, O3 is a bent molecule with a C2v point group.

Alternatively, maybe E is Cl2, which has D∞h symmetry. Cl2 is a diatomic molecule, so it has D∞h symmetry. Cl2 is a yellow-green gas and extremely hazardous, so that fits.

But how does E form from C and H2?

Wait, earlier in reaction 2: C + 2 D → E. D is H2, so C + 2 H2 → E. If E is Cl2, then what is C?

C would need to be something that, when reacted with H2, produces Cl2. But that doesn't make sense because Cl2 is an element. Wait, perhaps C is ClO2 or something, but not sure.

Wait, maybe reaction 2 is a decomposition reaction. Let me think differently. Maybe C is a chlorinated compound. Hmm, perhaps C is CCl4, which is a solvent. But reacting CCl4 with H2 would require some catalyst, but I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chloride. For example, if C is FeCl3, then reacting with H2 might produce Fe and HCl. But FeCl3 is a solid, not a gas. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide. Like H2O2. If C is H2O2, then reaction 2 would be H2O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O + O2. But that doesn't produce Cl2 or other diatomic E.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach.

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So, the hydrolysis of C produces a metal (A) and two acids. One strong, one weak.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed salt. For example, suppose C is a sulfite and a sulfate. Or maybe it's a nitrate and another component.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. For example, Na2CO3. Reacting with water doesn't produce strong or weak acids, though. It would produce NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (weak acid? Or non-acid gas).

Wait, going back to the beginning. Let's think about the first reaction again. Solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red C.

If A is sulfur, but in what form? Sulfur is yellow, not red. Wait, perhaps it's a different compound. Oh, wait! I remember that when sodium reacts with something, it can form a red product. Wait, no, sodium oxide is white.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a sulfide of a transition metal. For example, Cu2S is a red solid. So if C is Cu2S, then what is A and B?

Cu2S is copper(II) sulfide. Let's think about how it's formed. Copper metal (A) reacts with sulfur (B) in a 1:1 ratio to form Cu2S. Wait, but in reality, the reaction is 2 Cu + S → Cu2S. So 2 moles of Cu react with 1 mole of S. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B per A. So if A is 1 mole, B is 8 moles. That doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe, and B is S. The reaction would be Fe + S → FeS. FeS is a black solid, though. Not red.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps C is a chromate or dichromate. For example, K2Cr2O7 is orange-red, but not bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a molybdate.

Wait, maybe C is a nitro compound. For example, nitro groups are colored, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonic acid. No, that's more of an organic compound.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the third reaction again. The hydrolysis of C gives two acids. One strong (like H2SO4) and one weak (like CH3COOH). So C could be a sulfonate ester or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if C is a metal sulfate, like Al2(SO4)3. When it reacts with water, it dissociates into Al^3+ and SO4^2- ions, but that doesn't produce acids. Unless the solution becomes acidic due to hydrolysis, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, another idea: perhaps C is a metal nitrate. For example, Al(NO3)3. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze to form HNO3 (a strong acid) and another product, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that, when reacted with water, produces a strong acid. For example, if C is Na2O, then hydrolysis would produce NaOH, which is a strong base, not acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a superoxide. NaO2 reacts with water to produce O2 and NaOH. Again, not acids.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Maybe I should think of E as a diatomic molecule and try to match its symmetry group. Let's think about the options again.

Option C is D∞h. That's the symmetry group of diatomic molecules like O2, Cl2, N2. So if E is Cl2, then its symmetry group is D∞h. But how does Cl2 form from C and H2?

Wait, perhaps C is a chlorinated compound that, when reacted with H2, liberates Cl2. But I'm not sure about such a reaction.

Alternatively, considering that D is H2, and B is O2, perhaps in reaction 2, C reacts with H2 to form E and H2O. Wait, but earlier we thought H is H2O. So reaction 2 is C + 2 H2 → E. So E could be something that's formed from C and H2.

Wait, maybe E is H2O? No, because H2O is in reaction 3. No, reaction 3's product is H2O perhaps?

No, reaction 3 is C + H2O → A + F + G. So E is another product.

Wait, maybe E is H2O. But that doesn't make sense because H2O is a solvent, and E is extremely hazardous. Alternatively, E is something else.

Wait, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. So, let's say E is O2. O2 has D∞h symmetry. But how would that form from C and H2?

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2, which has D∞h symmetry. So, if E is Cl2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 H2 → Cl2. But that doesn't make sense because Cl2 is an element, and the reaction would require breaking C and H2 bonds to form Cl2, which doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach. Maybe C is a chloro compound, like CCl4. Then reaction 2 would be CCl4 + H2 → something. But I don't know the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorate or hypochlorite. Hmm, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the third reaction again. C + H2O → A + F + G. One strong acid (F) and one weak acid (G). So, for example, if F is H2SO4 and G is H3PO4.

Wait, but how? Let me think about a compound that upon hydrolysis forms two different acids. Maybe a mixed salt. For example, perhaps C is a sulfite and a phosphate? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester that upon hydrolysis gives a strong acid and a weak acid. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Wait, another idea: What if C is a nitride of a metal that when hydrolyzed gives a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, a metal nitride reacting with water could produce NH3 (weak base) and the metal hydroxide (strong base), but that's not acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbide. For example, SiC. Reacting with water would produce SiO2 (acidic, but as a solid) and CH4 (a neutral gas). Not matching.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible structures.

If E is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, like O2 or Cl2, then option C is D∞h. Alternatively, if E is O3, which has C2v symmetry, then option D is correct.

Wait, but O3 is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. But O3 is not a diatomic; it's triatomic.

Wait, another thought: Maybe E is a linear molecule with a center of inversion. For example, CO has a linear structure with D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but CO isn't extremely hazardous in the same way as Cl2 or O2, but it is toxic. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCN, which is highly toxic. HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. So, in that case, E's symmetry group would be D∞h, option C.

But how would HCN form from C and H2?

Hmm. Reaction 2: C + 2 H2 → HCN + something. Not sure about that.

Wait, maybe C is a cyanide. Let's say C is NaCN. Then, reaction 2 would be NaCN + H2 → HCN + NaH. But I'm not sure if that reaction occurs, and E would be HCN, which has D∞h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a cyanide salt. But I'm not sure how that would react with H2 to form HCN.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, or C2v.

If E is a triatomic molecule, it might have C2v symmetry. For example, H2O has C2v. But H2O is a solvent, not extremely hazardous. O3 is another triatomic, but it's not as hazardous as, say, Cl2.

Wait, Cl2 has D∞h symmetry, option C. So if E is Cl2, then the answer is C.

But how would Cl2 form from C and H2? Let me think. Maybe C is CCl2. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorinated compound that, when heated with H2, releases Cl2. But I can't think of a specific reaction like that.

Wait, another angle. Let's go back to reaction 3. C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, let's say F is H2SO4 and G is HNO3. How would C be a compound that when hydrolyzed gives these two acids?

That would suggest C is something like a sulfonate ester or a mixed anhydride, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfate and something else. But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, maybe A is sulfur. Let me think: If A is S (solid), and B is O2. Then, reaction 1: S + O2 → SO3? But SO3 is a liquid or gas, not a solid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen. For example, A is Na, B is Cl2. Reaction 1: Na + Cl2 → NaCl. But that's a 2:1 ratio, not 8:1. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal, and B is something else. Let me think about the 8:1 ratio. 8 equivalents of B per A. So, if A is 1 mole, B is 8 moles.

Wait, maybe it's the formation of Fe3O4. The formula is Fe3O4, so the ratio of Fe to O is 3:4. But that's 4 O per Fe on average. So 8 O per 2 Fe. If A is Fe, then 2 Fe would require 8 O. So 2 Fe + 8/3 O2 → Fe3O4. That would be 8/3 moles of O2 per 2 Fe. So per mole of Fe, it's (8/3)/2 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 moles O2. But the problem says 8 equivalents of O2 per mole of A (Fe). So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is something else. Maybe A is a diatomic molecule, and B is another diatomic. Let me think about the possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, and B is a triatomic gas. But I can't think of any.

Wait, maybe A is a metal like lead, and B is oxygen. Lead oxide can be PbO or PbO2. PbO is yellow, PbO2 is dark brown. Not bright red.

Wait, another idea: Maybe C is a sulfide of a transition metal, like Cu2S, which is bright red. So C is Cu2S. How would that form?

Cu2S is formed by reacting copper metal with sulfur. The reaction is 2 Cu + S → Cu2S. So for each mole of Cu, 0.5 moles of S are used. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B (S) per A (Cu). That's a 8:1 ratio, whereas the actual reaction uses 1:1 ratio (but 2 Cu per S). So 8 equivalents would be too much sulfur. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think of the possible E and its symmetry.

If E is O2, symmetry D∞h. But how does C + 2 H2 → O2? That would require some decomposition reaction, which I'm not aware of.

Alternatively, if E is O3, which has C2v symmetry, then option D is correct.

But how does C + 2 H2 → O3? I'm not sure about that reaction.

Wait, perhaps E is Ozone. But Ozone is formed by the reaction of O2 with H2O under certain conditions, but I don't see the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a linear molecule with a center of inversion. For example, CO has D∞h symmetry. But how would that form from C and H2?

I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should think of the possible answers and see which makes the most sense.

The options are:

A) C2
B) D4h
C) D∞h
D) C2v

If E is a diatomic molecule, it's either O2, Cl2, N2, etc., which have D∞h symmetry. So option C. Alternatively, if E is O3, which has C2v symmetry, then D.

But the problem says E is extremely hazardous. Ozone is toxic, but I'm not sure if it's as extremely hazardous as chlorine gas.

Wait, another possibility: E is HCl gas. But HCl is a monatomic molecule? No, it's diatomic. HCl has a bond dipole, but its symmetry group is D∞h. So if E is HCl, then symmetry group is D∞h.

But how would HCl form from C and H2?

Hmm. Alternatively, E could be NH3, which is a triatomic molecule with C3v symmetry, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the possible E molecules and their symmetry groups.

- O2: D∞h
- Cl2: D∞h
- O3: C2v
- H2O: C2v
- CO: D∞h
- CO2: D∞h (Wait, no, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. Wait, no, CO2 is nonpolar and has D∞h symmetry. So if E is CO2, then symmetry group is D∞h.

But CO2 is a gas, but it's not extremely hazardous. Unless in high concentrations.

Wait, but the problem says E is extremely hazardous. So maybe E is a highly toxic gas like HCN or Cl2.

HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. So if E is HCN, then symmetry group is D∞h.

So putting it all together: If E is HCN, then the symmetry group is D∞h.

But how does that fit into the reactions?

Reaction 2: C + 2 H2 → HCN + something.

Hmm. I'm not sure about the exact reaction, but perhaps C is a cyanide salt. Let's say C is NaCN. Then, NaCN + H2 → HCN + NaH. But I'm not sure if that reaction occurs. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrile (RCN), which upon reaction with H2 in presence of a catalyst might form RCH2CN, but that's not HCN.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal cyanide, and the reaction produces HCN and the metal. For example, 2 KCN + H2 → 2 HCN + 2 K. But I'm not sure if that's a known reaction.

But if E is HCN, then its symmetry group is D∞h.

So, the answer would be option C: D∞h.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of compound E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests C could be a transition metal compound, such as Cu2S (copper(II) sulfide), which is bright red. However, the exact identity of A and B remains unclear, but B is likely a gas like sulfur (S) or oxygen (O2).

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Gas D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If B is O2, D could be H2, as H2 + O2 → H2O, a common solvent. This suggests E might be a diatomic or triatomic molecule formed from C and H2.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to produce A, a strong acid F, and a weak acid G. This indicates C could be a compound that hydrolyzes to yield acids, such as a sulfide or nitride.

4. **Symmetry Group of E**: The options provided are:
   - **A) C2**: A two-fold rotation axis, seen in molecules like H2O2.
   - **B) D4h**: A dihedral group with a four-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirrors, seen in molecules like SO2.
   - **C) D∞h**: A dihedral group with an infinite-fold rotation axis, seen in diatomic molecules like O2, Cl2, and HCN.
   - **D) C2v**: A two-fold rotation axis with vertical mirror planes, seen in molecules like H2O and O3.

   Given that E is described as extremely hazardous, candidates include diatomic molecules like Cl2 (D∞h symmetry) or HCN (D∞h symmetry). Triatomic molecules like O3 (C2v symmetry) are also possible but less likely due to their lower toxicity compared to diatomic options.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the reactions and the symmetry groups, E is most likely a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. This aligns with the extreme hazard and symmetry of molecules like Cl2 or HCN.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a series of reactions, and from that, we need to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, or C2v. Hmm, symmetry groups are part of molecular symmetry and point group theory, right?

First, I'll try to follow each reaction and see what each compound could be. Let's break down the reactions one by one.

Reaction 1: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. So, A + 8B → C. What compounds react in an 8:1 ratio? Maybe something like sulfur reacting with something else. Wait, wait—bright red product. I remember that when metals react with certain gases, they form colored products. For example, sulfur trioxide is a solid, but when it reacts with water, it forms H2SO4. Oh, wait, but wait—maybe reaction C is something like an oxide. Let me think.

Wait, another thought: 8 equivalents. Maybe it's something like O2 reacting with a metal? Let's see. Suppose A is a metal, say iron, and B is oxygen. Iron oxide—could it be Fe3O4? Because Fe3O4 would have Fe in both +2 and +3 oxidation states. Let me check the stoichiometry. Fe3O4 has 3 Fe atoms and 4 O atoms. So, per Fe, it's 4/3 O per Fe. Hmm, but the reaction is 8 equivalents of B. So maybe each A takes 8 B's. So, A is Fe, B is O2? Then Fe + O2 → FeO? No, because FeO is not red. Wait, Fe3O4 is black, not red. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the bright red product. I remember that when sodium reacts with something, it can form a red product. Or maybe it's a sulfide. Wait, another thought—sulfur. Sulfur (solid) reacting with something. But sulfur is bright yellow, not red. Oh, wait, maybe it's a different compound. Or perhaps it's a nitrate?

Wait, perhaps the bright red product is a transition metal sulfide or oxide. Alternatively, maybe it's an oxide of vanadium or chromium, which can have colored compounds. Let me think—vanadium(V) oxide is a red solid, but I'm not sure about the reaction.

Wait, another approach: the third reaction. C reacts with water to form A, plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. So, when C (the product from A and B) reacts with water, it gives back A along with two acids. One strong, one weak. Let's think about what that could be.

Strong acids are like HCl, H2SO4, HNO3. Weak acids are like acetic acid, H3PO4, maybe. So, if C is something like a sulfate or nitrate, which when hydrolyzed gives a strong acid.

Wait, another thought: if C is a nitride, like Mg3N2. When Mg3N2 reacts with water, it produces Mg(OH)2 (which is a base, or maybe it's MgO and NH3?), but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, if C is a metal oxide, like Na2O. Na2O + H2O → 2NaOH, which is a strong base, not acid. Hmm, but the products are acids.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfide. Suppose A is a metal, B is sulfur. So, solid A (say, Fe) reacts with 8 equivalents of S (but S is a solid, so maybe not). Alternatively, perhaps B is Cl2, but I don't see how that would form a bright red product.

Wait, another angle: the second reaction. Product C reacts with gas D (2 equivalents) to form product E, which is extremely hazardous. Gas D—could be something like chlorine or another diatomic gas. Also, when C reacts with D, it produces E. Then, D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So D + B → H, a solvent. Solvents could be something like H2O, ethanol, etc. Wait, but D is a gas. So D and B are gases reacting, forming a solvent.

Wait, D plus B in 1:1 ratio. So if B is O2, then D could be something like Cl2. O2 + Cl2 → ? But that forms ClO2 or something else? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is O2 and D is H2. H2 and O2 form H2O, which is a solvent. Oh, that makes sense. So D is H2. But wait, in reaction D + B → H (solvent), which would be H2O. So D is H2, B is O2. Then product H is H2O.

So, let's retrace. B is O2. So reaction 1 is A (solid) reacting with 8 equivalents O2 to form C (bright red). What solid reacts with O2 in a 8:1 ratio to form a red product? Hmm. Maybe it's a transition metal.

Wait, iron reacts with oxygen to form FeO, Fe3O4, or Fe2O3. Fe3O4 is black, FeO is black too. Fe2O3 is reddish. Oh! Fe2O3 is a reddish solid. So if A is Fe, and B is O2, then 8 moles of B per mole of A: Fe + O2 → Fe2O3.

Wait, the stoichiometry. Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3? Or what's the reaction? Let me write the balanced equation.

Fe reacts with O2 to form Fe2O3.

The balanced reaction is: 4 Fe + 3 O2 → 2 Fe2O3.

So the mole ratio is Fe to O2 is 4:3. But in the problem statement, it's 8 equivalents of B (O2) per 1 equivalent of A (Fe). So 8 moles of O2 per mole of Fe. But in the balanced equation, it's 3 moles of O2 per 4 moles Fe. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe the example isn't Fe and O2. Maybe another metal.

Wait, another metal. Let's think of something else. Maybe vanadium? Vanadium(V) oxide is bright yellow, but maybe another oxide. Alternatively, maybe it's a sulfide.

Wait, perhaps it's not a metal oxide. Let me think of another approach. The second reaction is C reacting with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E. D is a gas, and when it reacts with B (O2) in 1:1 ratio, it forms H, which is a solvent. So H is H2O, as above, meaning D is H2.

So, reaction 2: C + 2 H2 → E.

Wait, but H is a solvent, so H is H2O. So D is H2. So reaction 2 is C reacting with 2 H2 → E.

Hmm, what reacts with H2 to form something? Maybe a metal oxide reacting with H2 to form a metal and water. But E is extremely hazardous. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride, and reacting with H2 would form NH3 or something. Wait, but C reacting with water gives back A and two acids.

Let me think about reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So, if C is a nitride, like Ca3N2, then upon hydrolysis, it would produce NH3 (a weak base) and a hydroxide, which is a base. That doesn't fit because the products are acids.

Alternatively, if C is a sulfide, say PbS, but PbS is a crystalline solid, and I'm not sure about the reaction with water. Maybe not.

Wait, another idea: perhaps C is a metal hydride. For example, NaH reacts with water to form NaOH (strong base) and H2 gas. But in this case, the products are acids, so maybe not.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let's try to approach it differently.

Let me think of the possible structures of E. The question is about the molecular symmetry of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, or C2v.

Symmetry groups are determined by the arrangement of atoms. For example, O2 has D∞h symmetry, water has C2v, and so on.

Wait, what if E is a diatomic molecule? Let's say E is O2, but that seems unlikely because O2 is a gas and not extremely hazardous. Alternatively, E could be a toxic gas like Cl2, but then D would be H2, and H would be H2O. But then, what is C in that case?

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's see what E is. The second reaction is C + 2 D → E. D is H2, so C + 2 H2 → E. So E could be a compound formed by combining C and H2. Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide, and E is a metal.

But E is extremely hazardous. So, for example, if C is Fe3O4, and it reacts with H2, then Fe3O4 + 4 H2 → 3 Fe + 4 H2O. But Fe is a solid, maybe E is Fe, but that's not a gas, and not extremely hazardous in gaseous form.

Wait, another possibility: C is a metal oxide, and E is a metal, which is a solid, but the question says E is a product, perhaps a gas? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitride. Let's say C is Ca3N2. Reacting with H2 could produce CaH2 and NH3? Wait, but the reaction would be: Ca3N2 + H2 → 3 CaH2 + NH3. Then E would be CaH2 and NH3? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfide. Let's say C is FeS. Reacting with H2? Not sure about that reaction. FeS + H2 → ?

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbide. For example, CaC2. Reacting with H2 would produce CaH2 and C. But again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule with a certain symmetry. Let's think of diatomic molecules and their symmetry. For example:

- O2 has D∞h symmetry.
- Cl2 also has D∞h.
- O3 is C2v.
- H2 is D∞h.
- N2 is D∞h.
- CO is D∞h.

Wait, but E is extremely hazardous. So maybe E is something like Cl2 (chlorine gas), which is yellow-green and highly toxic. But if E is Cl2, then how did it form?

Let me backtrack. If E is Cl2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 H2 → Cl2. But that doesn't make sense because Cl2 is a diatomic element, and the reaction would need to produce it from H2 and C. Alternatively, perhaps C is a chloride. Wait, but earlier steps...

Wait, let's think about reaction 3 again. C reacts with water to produce A plus two acids. One strong, one weak. So maybe C is a metal carbonyl? Or perhaps a nitrate.

Wait, another approach. If C is a nitride (like Na3N), when it reacts with water, it produces NH3 (weak base, not acid) and NaOH (strong base). But the problem says two acids, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps C is a sulfide. For example, if C is Al2S3. Reacting with water would give Al(OH)3 (which is amphoteric) and H2S, which is a weak acid. But Al(OH)3 isn't an acid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfate. Wait, if C is Fe2(SO4)3. Then, when it reacts with water, maybe it doesn't decompose. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, perhaps C is a metal oxide that when hydrolyzed gives two different acids. Wait, that's tricky. How about if C is a mixed oxide. Let me think. For example, Pb3O4 is a dark red solid, and upon hydrolysis, it can form PbO2 (which is a strong oxidizing agent) and Pb(OH)2. Wait, but that's a base, not an acid.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride of a metal that when hydrolyzed gives a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, perhaps Ca3N2 reacting with H2O gives Ca(OH)2 and NH3. But again, those are a base and a weak base.

Wait, maybe C is a sulfite. For instance, CaSO3. When it reacts with water, perhaps it hydrolyzes to Ca(OH)2 and H2SO3 (which is a weak acid). But Ca(OH)2 is a base. So, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a peroxide. For example, Na2O2. When it reacts with water, it produces NaOH (strong base) and O2. But again, not acids.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should think of C as a metal oxide that, when reacting with H2, produces a metal and water, but E is the metal. But E is extremely hazardous. So maybe E is a metal like mercury or something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is a compound with a high symmetry. Let's think about the possible symmetry groups.

The options are:

A) C2: This is a two-fold rotation axis. For example, H2O2 has C2 symmetry.

B) D4h: This is a dihedral group with a four-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirrors. For example, SO2 has D4h symmetry.

C) D∞h: This is a dihedral group with an infinite-fold rotation axis, like O2, Cl2, N2, etc.

D) C2v: A two-fold rotation axis with vertical mirror planes. For example, CO2 has D∞h, but H2O has C2v.

Wait, no—H2O actually has C2v symmetry. Because it's a bent molecule with a C2 axis and two mirror planes.

Wait, so if E is H2O, then its symmetry group is C2v. But the problem says E is extremely hazardous. H2O isn't hazardous, unless in large quantities. Hmm, so perhaps E isn't H2O.

Wait, other possibilities: If E is O3, which is a triatomic molecule with C2v symmetry. Ozone is a toxic gas, but I'm not sure if it's extremely hazardous. Also, O3 is a bent molecule with a C2v point group.

Alternatively, maybe E is Cl2, which has D∞h symmetry. Cl2 is a diatomic molecule, so it has D∞h symmetry. Cl2 is a yellow-green gas and extremely hazardous, so that fits.

But how does E form from C and H2?

Wait, earlier in reaction 2: C + 2 D → E. D is H2, so C + 2 H2 → E. If E is Cl2, then what is C?

C would need to be something that, when reacted with H2, produces Cl2. But that doesn't make sense because Cl2 is an element. Wait, perhaps C is ClO2 or something, but not sure.

Wait, maybe reaction 2 is a decomposition reaction. Let me think differently. Maybe C is a chlorinated compound. Hmm, perhaps C is CCl4, which is a solvent. But reacting CCl4 with H2 would require some catalyst, but I'm not sure if that's relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal chloride. For example, if C is FeCl3, then reacting with H2 might produce Fe and HCl. But FeCl3 is a solid, not a gas. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a peroxide. Like H2O2. If C is H2O2, then reaction 2 would be H2O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O + O2. But that doesn't produce Cl2 or other diatomic E.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another approach.

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid). So, the hydrolysis of C produces a metal (A) and two acids. One strong, one weak.

Wait, perhaps C is a mixed salt. For example, suppose C is a sulfite and a sulfate. Or maybe it's a nitrate and another component.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbonate. For example, Na2CO3. Reacting with water doesn't produce strong or weak acids, though. It would produce NaOH (strong base) and CO2 (weak acid? Or non-acid gas).

Wait, going back to the beginning. Let's think about the first reaction again. Solid A reacting with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red C.

If A is sulfur, but in what form? Sulfur is yellow, not red. Wait, perhaps it's a different compound. Oh, wait! I remember that when sodium reacts with something, it can form a red product. Wait, no, sodium oxide is white.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a sulfide of a transition metal. For example, Cu2S is a red solid. So if C is Cu2S, then what is A and B?

Cu2S is copper(II) sulfide. Let's think about how it's formed. Copper metal (A) reacts with sulfur (B) in a 1:1 ratio to form Cu2S. Wait, but in reality, the reaction is 2 Cu + S → Cu2S. So 2 moles of Cu react with 1 mole of S. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B per A. So if A is 1 mole, B is 8 moles. That doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps A is Fe, and B is S. The reaction would be Fe + S → FeS. FeS is a black solid, though. Not red.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps C is a chromate or dichromate. For example, K2Cr2O7 is orange-red, but not bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a molybdate.

Wait, maybe C is a nitro compound. For example, nitro groups are colored, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonic acid. No, that's more of an organic compound.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the third reaction again. The hydrolysis of C gives two acids. One strong (like H2SO4) and one weak (like CH3COOH). So C could be a sulfonate ester or something, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if C is a metal sulfate, like Al2(SO4)3. When it reacts with water, it dissociates into Al^3+ and SO4^2- ions, but that doesn't produce acids. Unless the solution becomes acidic due to hydrolysis, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, another idea: perhaps C is a metal nitrate. For example, Al(NO3)3. When it reacts with water, it can hydrolyze to form HNO3 (a strong acid) and another product, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a metal oxide that, when reacted with water, produces a strong acid. For example, if C is Na2O, then hydrolysis would produce NaOH, which is a strong base, not acid.

Wait, perhaps C is a superoxide. NaO2 reacts with water to produce O2 and NaOH. Again, not acids.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Maybe I should think of E as a diatomic molecule and try to match its symmetry group. Let's think about the options again.

Option C is D∞h. That's the symmetry group of diatomic molecules like O2, Cl2, N2. So if E is Cl2, then its symmetry group is D∞h. But how does Cl2 form from C and H2?

Wait, perhaps C is a chlorinated compound that, when reacted with H2, liberates Cl2. But I'm not sure about such a reaction.

Alternatively, considering that D is H2, and B is O2, perhaps in reaction 2, C reacts with H2 to form E and H2O. Wait, but earlier we thought H is H2O. So reaction 2 is C + 2 H2 → E. So E could be something that's formed from C and H2.

Wait, maybe E is H2O? No, because H2O is in reaction 3. No, reaction 3's product is H2O perhaps?

No, reaction 3 is C + H2O → A + F + G. So E is another product.

Wait, maybe E is H2O. But that doesn't make sense because H2O is a solvent, and E is extremely hazardous. Alternatively, E is something else.

Wait, perhaps E is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. So, let's say E is O2. O2 has D∞h symmetry. But how would that form from C and H2?

Alternatively, perhaps E is Cl2, which has D∞h symmetry. So, if E is Cl2, then reaction 2 is C + 2 H2 → Cl2. But that doesn't make sense because Cl2 is an element, and the reaction would require breaking C and H2 bonds to form Cl2, which doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach. Maybe C is a chloro compound, like CCl4. Then reaction 2 would be CCl4 + H2 → something. But I don't know the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorate or hypochlorite. Hmm, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the third reaction again. C + H2O → A + F + G. One strong acid (F) and one weak acid (G). So, for example, if F is H2SO4 and G is H3PO4.

Wait, but how? Let me think about a compound that upon hydrolysis forms two different acids. Maybe a mixed salt. For example, perhaps C is a sulfite and a phosphate? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester that upon hydrolysis gives a strong acid and a weak acid. But I'm not familiar with such a reaction.

Wait, another idea: What if C is a nitride of a metal that when hydrolyzed gives a strong acid and a weak acid. For example, a metal nitride reacting with water could produce NH3 (weak base) and the metal hydroxide (strong base), but that's not acids.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a carbide. For example, SiC. Reacting with water would produce SiO2 (acidic, but as a solid) and CH4 (a neutral gas). Not matching.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible structures.

If E is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, like O2 or Cl2, then option C is D∞h. Alternatively, if E is O3, which has C2v symmetry, then option D is correct.

Wait, but O3 is a bent molecule with C2v symmetry. But O3 is not a diatomic; it's triatomic.

Wait, another thought: Maybe E is a linear molecule with a center of inversion. For example, CO has a linear structure with D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but CO isn't extremely hazardous in the same way as Cl2 or O2, but it is toxic. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps E is HCN, which is highly toxic. HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. So, in that case, E's symmetry group would be D∞h, option C.

But how would HCN form from C and H2?

Hmm. Reaction 2: C + 2 H2 → HCN + something. Not sure about that.

Wait, maybe C is a cyanide. Let's say C is NaCN. Then, reaction 2 would be NaCN + H2 → HCN + NaH. But I'm not sure if that reaction occurs, and E would be HCN, which has D∞h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a cyanide salt. But I'm not sure how that would react with H2 to form HCN.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, or C2v.

If E is a triatomic molecule, it might have C2v symmetry. For example, H2O has C2v. But H2O is a solvent, not extremely hazardous. O3 is another triatomic, but it's not as hazardous as, say, Cl2.

Wait, Cl2 has D∞h symmetry, option C. So if E is Cl2, then the answer is C.

But how would Cl2 form from C and H2? Let me think. Maybe C is CCl2. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorinated compound that, when heated with H2, releases Cl2. But I can't think of a specific reaction like that.

Wait, another angle. Let's go back to reaction 3. C reacts with water to produce A, F (strong acid), and G (weak acid). So, let's say F is H2SO4 and G is HNO3. How would C be a compound that when hydrolyzed gives these two acids?

That would suggest C is something like a sulfonate ester or a mixed anhydride, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal sulfate and something else. But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, maybe A is sulfur. Let me think: If A is S (solid), and B is O2. Then, reaction 1: S + O2 → SO3? But SO3 is a liquid or gas, not a solid. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe A is a metal, and B is a halogen. For example, A is Na, B is Cl2. Reaction 1: Na + Cl2 → NaCl. But that's a 2:1 ratio, not 8:1. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps A is a transition metal, and B is something else. Let me think about the 8:1 ratio. 8 equivalents of B per A. So, if A is 1 mole, B is 8 moles.

Wait, maybe it's the formation of Fe3O4. The formula is Fe3O4, so the ratio of Fe to O is 3:4. But that's 4 O per Fe on average. So 8 O per 2 Fe. If A is Fe, then 2 Fe would require 8 O. So 2 Fe + 8/3 O2 → Fe3O4. That would be 8/3 moles of O2 per 2 Fe. So per mole of Fe, it's (8/3)/2 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333 moles O2. But the problem says 8 equivalents of O2 per mole of A (Fe). So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is something else. Maybe A is a diatomic molecule, and B is another diatomic. Let me think about the possibilities.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal, and B is a triatomic gas. But I can't think of any.

Wait, maybe A is a metal like lead, and B is oxygen. Lead oxide can be PbO or PbO2. PbO is yellow, PbO2 is dark brown. Not bright red.

Wait, another idea: Maybe C is a sulfide of a transition metal, like Cu2S, which is bright red. So C is Cu2S. How would that form?

Cu2S is formed by reacting copper metal with sulfur. The reaction is 2 Cu + S → Cu2S. So for each mole of Cu, 0.5 moles of S are used. But the problem says 8 equivalents of B (S) per A (Cu). That's a 8:1 ratio, whereas the actual reaction uses 1:1 ratio (but 2 Cu per S). So 8 equivalents would be too much sulfur. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think of the possible E and its symmetry.

If E is O2, symmetry D∞h. But how does C + 2 H2 → O2? That would require some decomposition reaction, which I'm not aware of.

Alternatively, if E is O3, which has C2v symmetry, then option D is correct.

But how does C + 2 H2 → O3? I'm not sure about that reaction.

Wait, perhaps E is Ozone. But Ozone is formed by the reaction of O2 with H2O under certain conditions, but I don't see the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a linear molecule with a center of inversion. For example, CO has D∞h symmetry. But how would that form from C and H2?

I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should think of the possible answers and see which makes the most sense.

The options are:

A) C2
B) D4h
C) D∞h
D) C2v

If E is a diatomic molecule, it's either O2, Cl2, N2, etc., which have D∞h symmetry. So option C. Alternatively, if E is O3, which has C2v symmetry, then D.

But the problem says E is extremely hazardous. Ozone is toxic, but I'm not sure if it's as extremely hazardous as chlorine gas.

Wait, another possibility: E is HCl gas. But HCl is a monatomic molecule? No, it's diatomic. HCl has a bond dipole, but its symmetry group is D∞h. So if E is HCl, then symmetry group is D∞h.

But how would HCl form from C and H2?

Hmm. Alternatively, E could be NH3, which is a triatomic molecule with C3v symmetry, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the possible E molecules and their symmetry groups.

- O2: D∞h
- Cl2: D∞h
- O3: C2v
- H2O: C2v
- CO: D∞h
- CO2: D∞h (Wait, no, CO2 is linear and has D∞h symmetry. Wait, no, CO2 is nonpolar and has D∞h symmetry. So if E is CO2, then symmetry group is D∞h.

But CO2 is a gas, but it's not extremely hazardous. Unless in high concentrations.

Wait, but the problem says E is extremely hazardous. So maybe E is a highly toxic gas like HCN or Cl2.

HCN is a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. So if E is HCN, then symmetry group is D∞h.

So putting it all together: If E is HCN, then the symmetry group is D∞h.

But how does that fit into the reactions?

Reaction 2: C + 2 H2 → HCN + something.

Hmm. I'm not sure about the exact reaction, but perhaps C is a cyanide salt. Let's say C is NaCN. Then, NaCN + H2 → HCN + NaH. But I'm not sure if that reaction occurs. Alternatively, perhaps C is a nitrile (RCN), which upon reaction with H2 in presence of a catalyst might form RCH2CN, but that's not HCN.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal cyanide, and the reaction produces HCN and the metal. For example, 2 KCN + H2 → 2 HCN + 2 K. But I'm not sure if that's a known reaction.

But if E is HCN, then its symmetry group is D∞h.

So, the answer would be option C: D∞h.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of compound E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The bright red color suggests C could be a transition metal compound, such as Cu2S (copper(II) sulfide), which is bright red. However, the exact identity of A and B remains unclear, but B is likely a gas like sulfur (S) or oxygen (O2).

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Gas D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. If B is O2, D could be H2, as H2 + O2 → H2O, a common solvent. This suggests E might be a diatomic or triatomic molecule formed from C and H2.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to produce A, a strong acid F, and a weak acid G. This indicates C could be a compound that hydrolyzes to yield acids, such as a sulfide or nitride.

4. **Symmetry Group of E**: The options provided are:
   - **A) C2**: A two-fold rotation axis, seen in molecules like H2O2.
   - **B) D4h**: A dihedral group with a four-fold rotation axis and horizontal mirrors, seen in molecules like SO2.
   - **C) D∞h**: A dihedral group with an infinite-fold rotation axis, seen in diatomic molecules like O2, Cl2, and HCN.
   - **D) C2v**: A two-fold rotation axis with vertical mirror planes, seen in molecules like H2O and O3.

   Given that E is described as extremely hazardous, candidates include diatomic molecules like Cl2 (D∞h symmetry) or HCN (D∞h symmetry). Triatomic molecules like O3 (C2v symmetry) are also possible but less likely due to their lower toxicity compared to diatomic options.

5. **Conclusion**: Based on the reactions and the symmetry groups, E is most likely a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry. This aligns with the extreme hazard and symmetry of molecules like Cl2 or HCN.

Answer: C
