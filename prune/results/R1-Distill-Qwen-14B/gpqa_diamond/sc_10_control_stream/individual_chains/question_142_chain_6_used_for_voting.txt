Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used in quantum mechanics to describe the state of a system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think this through.

The question gives the density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I think this is a diagonal matrix because the terms are |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|. Wait, what's the structure of a density matrix for a single qubit?

I remember that a general single-qubit density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector r has components (x, y, z), right? And the density matrix is given by (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

So, let's break it down. The given ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me compute this out. |0⟩ is [1, 0]^T, so |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. Then, ρ is (1/2)I.

Wait, the identity matrix is a 2x2 matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. So ρ = I/2.

Now, the general form is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. Comparing that to ρ, which is I/2, that implies that the terms with σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z must be zero. So r_x, r_y, r_z are all zero. That would mean the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). So the point is at the origin.

Wait a second, what's the significance of the Bloch vector being at the origin? I think that represents the completely mixed state. Because if the state is a maximally mixed state, like ρ = I/2, then it can't be written as a pure state. So in the Bloch sphere, pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The completely mixed state would be at the center, which is r=(0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me just recap: the given density matrix is a completely mixed state, so the Bloch vector is zero, which corresponds to the origin. So the correct option is C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|\right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2}I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. The general form of a single-qubit density matrix in the Bloch sphere representation is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(I + \vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}\right),
\]

where \(\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector, and \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this to the given \(\rho\), it is evident that the terms involving the Pauli matrices must vanish, meaning \(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), and \(r_z = 0\). Therefore, the Bloch vector is \(\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

This state represents a completely mixed state, which is located at the center of the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**A) \(r = (1,1,0)\)**: Incorrect, as the Bloch vector is not at this point.  
**B) \(r = (0,0,1)\)**: Incorrect, as the Bloch vector is not along the \(z\)-axis.  
**C) \(r = (0,0,0)\)**: Correct, as the Bloch vector is at the origin.  
**D) \(r = (1,1,1)\)**: Incorrect, as the Bloch vector is not at this point.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this question about density matrices and their geometrical positions in qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used in quantum mechanics to describe the state of a system, especially when it's in a mixed state. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I need to think this through.

The question gives the density matrix ρ as (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). I think this is a diagonal matrix because the terms are |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|. Wait, what's the structure of a density matrix for a single qubit?

I remember that a general single-qubit density matrix can be written in terms of the Bloch sphere representation. The Bloch vector r has components (x, y, z), right? And the density matrix is given by (I + r·σ)/2, where σ are the Pauli matrices.

So, let's break it down. The given ρ is (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me compute this out. |0⟩ is [1, 0]^T, so |0⟩⟨0| is [[1,0],[0,0]]. Similarly, |1⟩⟨1| is [[0,0],[0,1]]. Adding them together gives [[1,0],[0,1]], which is the identity matrix I. Then, ρ is (1/2)I.

Wait, the identity matrix is a 2x2 matrix with ones on the diagonal and zeros elsewhere. So ρ = I/2.

Now, the general form is (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2. Comparing that to ρ, which is I/2, that implies that the terms with σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z must be zero. So r_x, r_y, r_z are all zero. That would mean the Bloch vector r is (0,0,0). So the point is at the origin.

Wait a second, what's the significance of the Bloch vector being at the origin? I think that represents the completely mixed state. Because if the state is a maximally mixed state, like ρ = I/2, then it can't be written as a pure state. So in the Bloch sphere, pure states are on the surface, and mixed states are inside. The completely mixed state would be at the center, which is r=(0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is r=(0,0,0). So the answer should be C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(|0\rangle \langle 0| + |1\rangle \langle 1|\right).
\]

This can be rewritten as 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{2}I,
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix. The general form of a single-qubit density matrix in the Bloch sphere representation is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(I + \vec{r} \cdot \vec{\sigma}\right),
\]

where \(\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is the Bloch vector, and \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli matrices. Comparing this to the given \(\rho\), it is evident that the terms involving the Pauli matrices must vanish, meaning \(r_x = 0\), \(r_y = 0\), and \(r_z = 0\). Therefore, the Bloch vector is \(\vec{r} = (0, 0, 0)\), which corresponds to the origin in the Bloch sphere.

This state represents a completely mixed state, which is located at the center of the Bloch sphere. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**A) \(r = (1,1,0)\)**: Incorrect, as the Bloch vector is not at this point.  
**B) \(r = (0,0,1)\)**: Incorrect, as the Bloch vector is not along the \(z\)-axis.  
**C) \(r = (0,0,0)\)**: Correct, as the Bloch vector is at the origin.  
**D) \(r = (1,1,1)\)**: Incorrect, as the Bloch vector is not at this point.

Thus, the correct answer is:

Answer: C
