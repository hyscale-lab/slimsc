Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix A_y, which is equal to c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant, right?

The matrix S is given as:
First row: 0   -i
Second row: i   0

So, first, I think I need to write out what the matrix A_y looks like. Since A_y = c * S, substituting c gives A_y = (h/(4π)) * S. So each element of S is multiplied by h/(4π).

Wait, but S itself looks familiar. Oh, right! S is probably the Pauli Y matrix, which is one of the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are used in spin-1/2 systems, like electrons or muons. Each Pauli matrix corresponds to the spin operator in the x, y, or z direction.

The eigenvalue equation given is A_y φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y.

But wait, before jumping into that, what are the properties of the Pauli matrices? I remember that each Pauli matrix (like S here) has eigenvalues ±1/2. Because for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators have eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but when you're dealing with the Pauli matrices, they typically represent spin in units where ħ is 1, so the eigenvalues are ±1/2.

Wait, but in this problem, the operator A_y is c multiplied by S. So let me compute c first. c is h/(4π). Since Planck's constant h is 2πħ, substituting that in, c = (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/(2). So c is ħ/2.

So A_y is (ħ/2) * S. And S has eigenvalues ±1/2. So when I multiply S by (ħ/2), the eigenvalues become (ħ/2)*(±1/2) )= ± ħ/4.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The eigenvalues of S are ±1/2, so the eigenvalues of A_y would be c times that. Since c is ħ/(2), then A_y's eigenvalues are (ħ/(2)) * (1/2) ) and (ħ/(2))*(-1/2) ), which simplifies to ± ħ/(4). So that's ± h/(4π * 2) because h=2πħ, so substituting, h/(4π) *1/2 is h/(8π) ? Wait, maybe I should just leave it as ħ/4, since ħ is h/(2π).

Wait, maybe I should compute it numerically. Let's see: c is h/(4π), and S has eigenvalues ±1/2. So A_y has eigenvalues (h/(4π)) * (1/2) and (h/(4π))*(-1/2). So that's ± h/(8π). Hmm, wait, that doesn't match the options given.

Looking at the options, option B says the imaginary part of the eigenvalues are ±1/2, real parts ±1. But wait, what are we looking at here? The eigenvalues of A_y are real or complex? Let's think again.

Wait, no. Wait a second. S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when we compute the eigenvalues of S, perhaps I was wrong. Let me compute the eigenvalues of S. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So wait, no, the Pauli Y matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Because for any Pauli matrix sigma, the eigenvalues are ±1. Oh wait, but wait, S is the spin operator? Or is it scaled?

Wait, let's correct this. The spin operator S for spin-1/2 particles is (ħ/2) sigma, where sigma is the Pauli matrix. So the eigenvalues of S would be ± ħ/2. But in this case, the matrix S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So that's sigma_y, the Pauli Y matrix. So if S is sigma_y, then the eigenvalues of S are ±1. So when we multiply by c = h/(4π), which is (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/(2), then the eigenvalues of A_y are (ħ/2) * (±1), which is ± ħ/2.

Wait, h is Planck's constant, which is 2π ħ. So let me compute c again. c = h/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/(2). So A_y = c * S = (ħ/2) * sigma_y. So the eigenvalues are (ħ/2) * (±1), which is ± ħ/2.

But let me check, what's ħ in terms of h? Since ħ = h/(2π), substituting, the eigenvalues of A_y would be ± (h/(2π) ) * (1/2) )= ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Looking at the options, let's see. Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ± h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues of A_y are real, right? Wait, wait, no, the eigenvalues of A_y are real?

Wait, wait, wait. Are the eigenvalues of A_y real? Because S is Hermitian. Yes, S is Hermitian because Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So A_y is c times Hermitian, which makes it Hermitian. Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues a in the equation A_y φ = a φ must be real. So any option suggesting imaginary parts is incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary part is ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). So eigenvalues are complex. But that's impossible because A_y is Hermitian, so eigenvalues must be real. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Again, eigenvalues would be complex. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Wait, what's A^2? The square of the angular momentum operator. Since A is a component (A_y), A^2 would be (A_x)^2 + (A_y)^2 + (A_z)^2? No, wait, wait. No, actually, A^2 is the square of the vector operator A, which would involve A_x, A_y, A_z. But wait, in this case, the operator is just A_y, so A^2 is (A_x)^2 + (A_y)^2 + (A_z)^2. But each component is an operator, so A squared is the sum of squares. So if a state is an eigenstate of A_y, then it's also an eigenstate of A^2? Let's think.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, for angular momentum, the states are eigenstates of the total angular momentum squared (J^2) and one component (like J_z). But in this case, A is the intrinsic angular momentum, so similar situation. So if a state is an eigenstate of A_y, would it be an eigenstate of A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2?

Hmm. Let me think about this. For any state |ψ> that is an eigenstate of A_y, will it be an eigenstate of A^2? Let's compute A^2 |ψ> = (A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2) |ψ>. Since [A_x, A_y] = iħ A_z, and similar commutators. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since A^2 is a Casimir operator, it commutes with each component A_i. So if |ψ> is an eigenstate of A_y, then it's also an eigenstate of A^2. Because A^2 commutes with A_y, so they share eigenstates. So yes, the eigenfunctions of A_y are also eigenfunctions of A^2. So option C says that, but also says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Is that correct?

Wait, for angular momentum, the eigenstates of A_y are not eigenstates of A_z. Because A_y and A_z don't commute. So for instance, in the eigenbasis of A_y, A_z has a matrix representation that's off-diagonal, so its eigenstates are different. So the eigenfunctions of A_y are not eigenfunctions of A_z. So the statement in option C is correct. But wait, does A^2 commute with A_y? Yes, because A^2 is the sum of A_i squared, and each A_i commutes with A^2. So any state that is an eigenstate of A_y is also an eigenstate of A^2, as their operators commute. Therefore, the eigenfunction φ can be an eigenfunction of A^2. So option C's first part is correct. The second part says it's not an eigenfunction of Az, which is correct. So option C is a correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator A_y. Hmm. The eigenfunctions of a matrix operator form a basis for the vector space on which the operator acts. Since A_y is a 2x2 matrix, it's acting on a two-dimensional space. Any complete set of eigenvectors would form a basis. So the eigenfunctions φ form a basis for the operator's space. So option D is correct as well.

Wait, but let me think again. The statement says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's space. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors (if they are two and linearly independent) form a basis. So option D is correct.

Wait, but wait, in reality, for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors may form a basis, but if the matrix is defective (not diagonalizable), then it may not have two eigenvectors. But in this case, S is a Pauli matrix, which is diagonalizable because it's Hermitian. So A_y is Hermitian, so it must be diagonalizable, so it has two eigenvectors which form a basis. So option D is correct.

So which options are correct statements? The question asks which statement is correct during the calculation.

So looking back at the options:

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. We established that the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², since they commute, and not eigenfunctions of Az because they don't commute. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. Since the operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

But wait, looking at the options, which is correct?

Wait, let me go back to the eigenvalues. Earlier, I thought the eigenvalues of A_y are ± ħ/2, but wait, let's recompute.

Wait, S is the Pauli matrix sigma_y, which is:

0   -i
i    0

The eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1, right? Because for any Pauli matrix, the eigenvalues are ±1.

So, A_y = c * S, where c = h/(4π) = (2pi ħ)/(4pi) )= ħ/(2).

So the eigenvalues are c * (±1) )= ± ħ/(2).

But wait, h = 2 pi ħ, so h/(4 pi) = (2 pi ħ)/(4 pi) )= ħ/2. So yes, c = ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which is ± h/(4 pi) * 2? Wait, no. Wait, (h/(4 pi)) * (±1) )= ± h/(4 pi).

Wait, no. Let me think again. S has eigenvalues ±1, so A_y = (h/(4 pi)) * S has eigenvalues (h/(4 pi)) * (+1) = h/(4 pi) and (h/(4 pi))*(-1) = -h/(4 pi).

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because I thought S is sigma_y, which has eigenvalues ±1, so A_y's eigenvalues are ± (h/(4 pi)).

So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 pi), which are real numbers.

Looking at the options, option A: imaginary parts are ±2 pi h, real parts ± h/(4 pi). That can't be, because the eigenvalues are real.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. Also incorrect.

So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 pi).

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly state this. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let me compute h/(4 pi) in terms of ħ. Since h = 2 pi ħ, h/(4 pi) = (2 pi ħ) / (4 pi) )= ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which is ± h/(4 pi) as I thought.

Wait, but maybe the options are presented in terms of h. So, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 pi) (or ± ħ/2). So looking at the options:

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2 pi h, which is impossible because eigenvalues are real.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. Again, eigenvalues are real, so B is wrong.

Options C and D are about statements, not the eigenvalues.

So, of the statements, which is correct?

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

As we discussed, since A² commutes with Ay, the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A². But they are not eigenfunctions of Az because Ay and Az don't commute.

So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions form a basis for Ay. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, and it's diagonalizable (since it's Hermitian), its two eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But wait, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation.

So, looking at all options, both C and D could be correct. But which one is in the options?

Wait, looking back:

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not Az. That is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Which is also correct.

Wait, but the question says, which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options are mutually exclusive because each is a separate option.

Wait, but let me re-read the options:

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So both are correct statements.

But the given options are A, B, C, D. The question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps more than one is correct, but the options are presented as if only one is correct.

Wait, but looking back to the problem statement, the correct answer is one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the options again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier reasoning. Let's think again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ can be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not Az. Is that correct?

Yes, because A² and Ay commute, so any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A². But Az and Ay do not commute, so eigenstates of Ay are not eigenstates of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D space that Ay acts on. So yes, they form a basis. So option D is correct.

But wait, the question says "the statement below will you consider to be correct?" So which options are correct.

But looking back, let me make sure about the eigenvectors.

The matrix S is:

0   -i
i    0

The eigenvalues of S are ±1. So for eigenvalue +1:

We solve (S - I)|v> = 0, where I is identity matrix.

So S - I = [ [-1, -i], [i, -1] ]

The equations are:

- v1 -i v2 = 0

i v1 - v2 = 0

From first equation: v1 = -i v2.

From second equation: i v1 = v2.

Substituting v1 from first into second: i (-i v2) = v2 → (i * -i) v2 = v2 → ( (-i^2) ) v2 = v2 → ( - (-1) ) v2 = v2 → (1) v2 = v2. So it holds.

So eigenvector can be chosen as v2 = 1, v1 = -i → [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Similarly for eigenvalue -1: S + I = [[1, -i], [i, 1]]

(1)v1 -i v2 =0

i v1 +v2 =0

From first equation: v1 = i v2.

Second equation: i (i v2) + v2 = (-1) v2 + v2 =0 → 0=0.

So eigenvector is v1 = i v2, v2 =1 → [i, 1]^T.

So the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ]^T and [i, 1 ]^T.

These are the eigenfunctions φ.

So these form a basis for the 2D space, so option D is correct.

So both options C and D are correct statements. But wait, looking back at the options, I must have made a mistake because the options can't have multiple correct answers. Let me recheck the question.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps I should look for which of the options is a true statement.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. That's correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Which is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

But the options are presented as four possible answers, and the question is a multiple-choice where only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong in thinking that both are correct. Let me re-examine.

The question is about the operator Ay. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors form a basis for a two-dimensional space. So any vector can be expressed in terms of these eigenvectors. So option D is correct.

But the first part of option C is correct as well. So why are both options C and D correct? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that A² commutes with Ay. Let me think about that.

A² is the sum of squares of A_x, A_y, and A_z. So does A² commute with Ay? Let's compute [A², Ay] = A² Ay - Ay A². Since A² = A_x² + A_y² + A_z².

So [A², Ay] = [A_x² + A_y² + A_z², Ay] = [A_x², Ay] + [A_y², Ay] + [A_z², Ay].

Since [A_i, A_j] = iħ ε_ijk A_k, for i≠j, and [A_i, A_i] =0.

So, let's compute [A_x², Ay] = A_x A_x Ay - Ay A_x A_x.

But A_x and Ay don't commute. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to note that [A², Ay] = 0 because A² is the Casimir operator and commutes with all components.

Wait, yes, because the Casimir operator commutes with each component. So [A², Ay] =0. So A² and Ay share eigenstates. So any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A². So option C is correct.

So both options C and D are correct statements. But looking back, which is correct according to the problem's options.

Wait, but in the given options, perhaps only one is correct. Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) Imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). No, because eigenvalues are real.

B) Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No, eigenvalues are real.

C) Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Correct.

D) The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Also correct.

So, if both C and D are correct, but the options are presented as four options with only one correct, perhaps the question has a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which statement is correct, and both C and D are correct, but the options are such that only C is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about option D.

Wait, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So, the eigenvectors form a basis for the space on which Ay acts. Since Ay is 2x2, it's acting on a two-dimensional space, and two eigenvectors (if they are distinct) form a basis. So D is correct.

So the question now is: which of the options is correct. So both C and D are correct statements. But that can't be, as the question gives four options, each a single letter.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about option C. Let me think again.

Suppose a state is an eigenstate of Ay. Then, because A² commutes with Ay, the state must be an eigenstate of A². So, yes, C's first part is correct.

But does A² include all components? Well, A² is A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2. So yes, any state that is an eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A².

But, what about the other components, like A_x and A_z? No, they don't commute with Ay, so the eigenstates of Ay are not eigenstates of A_x or A_z. So C's second part is correct.

So both C and D are correct. But in the given options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the initial setup again. The problem states that the operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix; hence, it's a spin-1/2 system. So, the possible eigenvalues for Ay are ± ħ/2. So, in terms of h, since ħ = h/(2π), the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Looking at the options, none directly state this. So the correct eigenvalues would be ± h/(4π), which is real.

So, the correct statements are C and D. But in the given options, perhaps both are correct, but only one of them is an option.

But the options are A, B, C, D, so perhaps the correct answer is C and D.

Wait, but this is a multiple-choice question, so only one option can be correct. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only about the statements and not about the eigenvalues.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option again.

Option A: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real ±h/(4π). No, eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Imaginary ±1/2, real ±1. No, same issue.

Option C: Correct statement.

Option D: Correct statement.

So in reality, both C and D are correct. But the question says which statement is correct. So I must choose between C and D.

Wait, the question says during the calculation, which statement is correct.

Wait, perhaps the key is to look at the operator's matrix. The matrix S is the Pauli Y matrix. So, the eigenfunctions are the eigenstates of S. S is a Hermitian matrix, so its eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis.

So, the eigenfunctions φ are indeed the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay (since Ay is c*S, and the eigenvectors of S are the same as those of Ay). So, D is correct.

But C is also correct because the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A².

Wait, but if the question is a multiple-choice, perhaps the correct option is C and D. But since it's presented as four options, perhaps the intended correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is incorrect, and only D is correct. Let me think.

Wait, the square of the angular momentum operator, A², is (A_x)^2 + (A_y)^2 + (A_z)^2. So, for a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of A² are ( (ħ/2)^2 ) (s(s+1) ), where s=1/2. So, A² has eigenvalue (ħ/2)(3/2) ħ/2 *3/2 )= 3ħ²/4.

So, for any eigenstate of Ay, which has eigenvalue ± ħ/2, applying A² would give 3ħ²/4. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So option C is correct.

Therefore, both options C and D are correct, but the problem likely expects only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the options are incorrect in presentation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the problem.

Wait, perhaps the matrix S is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis, making D correct. But perhaps the given options are incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of another approach. Perhaps I should compute the actual eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Compute eigenvectors for S, then for A_y.

As earlier, the eigenvalues of S are ±1.

For eigenvalue +1, the eigenvector is [ -i, 1 ]^T.

For eigenvalue -1, it's [i, 1 ]^T.

Then, the matrix A_y is c * S, where c= h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues of A_y are c*(+1) and c*(-1), so ± h/(4π).

Thus, the eigenvalues are real, so any option suggesting complex eigenvalues is wrong. So options A and B are incorrect.

So, the correct statements must be C or D.

Now, the question is whether the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A² (which they are) and not of Az.

So, option C is correct.

Additionally, the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

But in the given options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question is which statement during the calculation is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is C, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, the statement in D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So, the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D space. So, D is correct.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: the problem is a multiple-choice question, and only one option is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

So, the correct answer is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon. The operator is represented as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix given as:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The task is to determine which statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( A_y \) is correct.

---

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \) and \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - These eigenvalues are real because \( S \) (and thus \( A_y \)) is Hermitian.

   **Analysis of Options A and B:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are entirely real.
   - **Option B:** Claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \).

2. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvectors of \( S \) (and hence \( A_y \)) are orthogonal and form a basis for the 2D space. For \( S \), the eigenvectors are:
     - For eigenvalue \( +1 \): \( \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \),
     - For eigenvalue \( -1 \): \( \begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).
   - These eigenvectors are also the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \).

   **Analysis of Option D:**
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is correct because the eigenvectors form a complete basis for the 2D space on which \( A_y \) acts.

3. **Relation to \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \):**
   - \( A^2 \) is the Casimir operator of the angular momentum, defined as \( A^2 = A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2 \). Since \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), any eigenstate of \( A_y \) is also an eigenstate of \( A^2 \).
   - However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

   **Analysis of Option C:**
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), while \( A_z \) does not.

---

### Conclusion:
Both options **C** and **D** are correct statements. However, since the question asks for a single correct answer, **C** is the most appropriate choice because it highlights the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), which is more directly relevant to the eigenvalue problem.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. The operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix A_y, which is equal to c multiplied by the matrix S. The constant c is h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant, right?

The matrix S is given as:
First row: 0   -i
Second row: i   0

So, first, I think I need to write out what the matrix A_y looks like. Since A_y = c * S, substituting c gives A_y = (h/(4π)) * S. So each element of S is multiplied by h/(4π).

Wait, but S itself looks familiar. Oh, right! S is probably the Pauli Y matrix, which is one of the Pauli matrices. The Pauli matrices are used in spin-1/2 systems, like electrons or muons. Each Pauli matrix corresponds to the spin operator in the x, y, or z direction.

The eigenvalue equation given is A_y φ = a φ, where a is the eigenvalue and φ is the eigenfunction. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y.

But wait, before jumping into that, what are the properties of the Pauli matrices? I remember that each Pauli matrix (like S here) has eigenvalues ±1/2. Because for spin-1/2 particles, the spin operators have eigenvalues ± ħ/2, but when you're dealing with the Pauli matrices, they typically represent spin in units where ħ is 1, so the eigenvalues are ±1/2.

Wait, but in this problem, the operator A_y is c multiplied by S. So let me compute c first. c is h/(4π). Since Planck's constant h is 2πħ, substituting that in, c = (2πħ)/(4π) )= ħ/(2). So c is ħ/2.

So A_y is (ħ/2) * S. And S has eigenvalues ±1/2. So when I multiply S by (ħ/2), the eigenvalues become (ħ/2)*(±1/2) )= ± ħ/4.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The eigenvalues of S are ±1/2, so the eigenvalues of A_y would be c times that. Since c is ħ/(2), then A_y's eigenvalues are (ħ/(2)) * (1/2) ) and (ħ/(2))*(-1/2) ), which simplifies to ± ħ/(4). So that's ± h/(4π * 2) because h=2πħ, so substituting, h/(4π) *1/2 is h/(8π) ? Wait, maybe I should just leave it as ħ/4, since ħ is h/(2π).

Wait, maybe I should compute it numerically. Let's see: c is h/(4π), and S has eigenvalues ±1/2. So A_y has eigenvalues (h/(4π)) * (1/2) and (h/(4π))*(-1/2). So that's ± h/(8π). Hmm, wait, that doesn't match the options given.

Looking at the options, option B says the imaginary part of the eigenvalues are ±1/2, real parts ±1. But wait, what are we looking at here? The eigenvalues of A_y are real or complex? Let's think again.

Wait, no. Wait a second. S is the Pauli Y matrix, which is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So when we compute the eigenvalues of S, perhaps I was wrong. Let me compute the eigenvalues of S. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1. So wait, no, the Pauli Y matrix has eigenvalues +1 and -1. Because for any Pauli matrix sigma, the eigenvalues are ±1. Oh wait, but wait, S is the spin operator? Or is it scaled?

Wait, let's correct this. The spin operator S for spin-1/2 particles is (ħ/2) sigma, where sigma is the Pauli matrix. So the eigenvalues of S would be ± ħ/2. But in this case, the matrix S is given as [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So that's sigma_y, the Pauli Y matrix. So if S is sigma_y, then the eigenvalues of S are ±1. So when we multiply by c = h/(4π), which is (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/(2), then the eigenvalues of A_y are (ħ/2) * (±1), which is ± ħ/2.

Wait, h is Planck's constant, which is 2π ħ. So let me compute c again. c = h/(4π) = (2π ħ)/(4π) )= ħ/(2). So A_y = c * S = (ħ/2) * sigma_y. So the eigenvalues are (ħ/2) * (±1), which is ± ħ/2.

But let me check, what's ħ in terms of h? Since ħ = h/(2π), substituting, the eigenvalues of A_y would be ± (h/(2π) ) * (1/2) )= ± h/(4π). So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Looking at the options, let's see. Option A says the imaginary parts are ±2πh and real parts ± h/(4π). That doesn't make sense because the eigenvalues of A_y are real, right? Wait, wait, no, the eigenvalues of A_y are real?

Wait, wait, wait. Are the eigenvalues of A_y real? Because S is Hermitian. Yes, S is Hermitian because Pauli matrices are Hermitian. So A_y is c times Hermitian, which makes it Hermitian. Hermitian operators have real eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues a in the equation A_y φ = a φ must be real. So any option suggesting imaginary parts is incorrect.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Imaginary part is ±2πh, real part ±h/(4π). So eigenvalues are complex. But that's impossible because A_y is Hermitian, so eigenvalues must be real. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. Again, eigenvalues would be complex. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Eigenfunctions of A_y can also be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not of Az. Wait, what's A^2? The square of the angular momentum operator. Since A is a component (A_y), A^2 would be (A_x)^2 + (A_y)^2 + (A_z)^2? No, wait, wait. No, actually, A^2 is the square of the vector operator A, which would involve A_x, A_y, A_z. But wait, in this case, the operator is just A_y, so A^2 is (A_x)^2 + (A_y)^2 + (A_z)^2. But each component is an operator, so A squared is the sum of squares. So if a state is an eigenstate of A_y, then it's also an eigenstate of A^2? Let's think.

Wait, in quantum mechanics, for angular momentum, the states are eigenstates of the total angular momentum squared (J^2) and one component (like J_z). But in this case, A is the intrinsic angular momentum, so similar situation. So if a state is an eigenstate of A_y, would it be an eigenstate of A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2?

Hmm. Let me think about this. For any state |ψ> that is an eigenstate of A_y, will it be an eigenstate of A^2? Let's compute A^2 |ψ> = (A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2) |ψ>. Since [A_x, A_y] = iħ A_z, and similar commutators. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since A^2 is a Casimir operator, it commutes with each component A_i. So if |ψ> is an eigenstate of A_y, then it's also an eigenstate of A^2. Because A^2 commutes with A_y, so they share eigenstates. So yes, the eigenfunctions of A_y are also eigenfunctions of A^2. So option C says that, but also says they are not eigenfunctions of Az. Is that correct?

Wait, for angular momentum, the eigenstates of A_y are not eigenstates of A_z. Because A_y and A_z don't commute. So for instance, in the eigenbasis of A_y, A_z has a matrix representation that's off-diagonal, so its eigenstates are different. So the eigenfunctions of A_y are not eigenfunctions of A_z. So the statement in option C is correct. But wait, does A^2 commute with A_y? Yes, because A^2 is the sum of A_i squared, and each A_i commutes with A^2. So any state that is an eigenstate of A_y is also an eigenstate of A^2, as their operators commute. Therefore, the eigenfunction φ can be an eigenfunction of A^2. So option C's first part is correct. The second part says it's not an eigenfunction of Az, which is correct. So option C is a correct statement.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of the matrix operator A_y. Hmm. The eigenfunctions of a matrix operator form a basis for the vector space on which the operator acts. Since A_y is a 2x2 matrix, it's acting on a two-dimensional space. Any complete set of eigenvectors would form a basis. So the eigenfunctions φ form a basis for the operator's space. So option D is correct as well.

Wait, but let me think again. The statement says "the eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above." So the eigenvectors form a basis for the operator's space. Since the operator is 2x2, the eigenvectors (if they are two and linearly independent) form a basis. So option D is correct.

Wait, but wait, in reality, for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvectors may form a basis, but if the matrix is defective (not diagonalizable), then it may not have two eigenvectors. But in this case, S is a Pauli matrix, which is diagonalizable because it's Hermitian. So A_y is Hermitian, so it must be diagonalizable, so it has two eigenvectors which form a basis. So option D is correct.

So which options are correct statements? The question asks which statement is correct during the calculation.

So looking back at the options:

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az. We established that the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², since they commute, and not eigenfunctions of Az because they don't commute. So C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions of Ay. Since the operator is 2x2, and the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

But wait, looking at the options, which is correct?

Wait, let me go back to the eigenvalues. Earlier, I thought the eigenvalues of A_y are ± ħ/2, but wait, let's recompute.

Wait, S is the Pauli matrix sigma_y, which is:

0   -i
i    0

The eigenvalues of sigma_y are ±1, right? Because for any Pauli matrix, the eigenvalues are ±1.

So, A_y = c * S, where c = h/(4π) = (2pi ħ)/(4pi) )= ħ/(2).

So the eigenvalues are c * (±1) )= ± ħ/(2).

But wait, h = 2 pi ħ, so h/(4 pi) = (2 pi ħ)/(4 pi) )= ħ/2. So yes, c = ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which is ± h/(4 pi) * 2? Wait, no. Wait, (h/(4 pi)) * (±1) )= ± h/(4 pi).

Wait, no. Let me think again. S has eigenvalues ±1, so A_y = (h/(4 pi)) * S has eigenvalues (h/(4 pi)) * (+1) = h/(4 pi) and (h/(4 pi))*(-1) = -h/(4 pi).

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because I thought S is sigma_y, which has eigenvalues ±1, so A_y's eigenvalues are ± (h/(4 pi)).

So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 pi), which are real numbers.

Looking at the options, option A: imaginary parts are ±2 pi h, real parts ± h/(4 pi). That can't be, because the eigenvalues are real.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. Also incorrect.

So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 pi).

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them directly state this. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let me compute h/(4 pi) in terms of ħ. Since h = 2 pi ħ, h/(4 pi) = (2 pi ħ) / (4 pi) )= ħ/2.

So the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, which is ± h/(4 pi) as I thought.

Wait, but maybe the options are presented in terms of h. So, the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 pi) (or ± ħ/2). So looking at the options:

Option A: eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2 pi h, which is impossible because eigenvalues are real.

Option B: imaginary parts ±1/2, real ±1. Again, eigenvalues are real, so B is wrong.

Options C and D are about statements, not the eigenvalues.

So, of the statements, which is correct?

Option C: The eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az.

As we discussed, since A² commutes with Ay, the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A². But they are not eigenfunctions of Az because Ay and Az don't commute.

So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions form a basis for Ay. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, and it's diagonalizable (since it's Hermitian), its two eigenvectors form a basis. So D is correct.

But wait, the question asks which statement is correct during the calculation.

So, looking at all options, both C and D could be correct. But which one is in the options?

Wait, looking back:

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not Az. That is correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Which is also correct.

Wait, but the question says, which statement is correct. So perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options are mutually exclusive because each is a separate option.

Wait, but let me re-read the options:

Option C: The eigenfunction of the operator Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

So both are correct statements.

But the given options are A, B, C, D. The question asks which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps more than one is correct, but the options are presented as if only one is correct.

Wait, but looking back to the problem statement, the correct answer is one of the options.

Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the options again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier reasoning. Let's think again.

Option C: The eigenfunctions φ can be eigenfunctions of A^2, but not Az. Is that correct?

Yes, because A² and Ay commute, so any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A². But Az and Ay do not commute, so eigenstates of Ay are not eigenstates of Az. So option C is correct.

Option D: The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D space that Ay acts on. So yes, they form a basis. So option D is correct.

But wait, the question says "the statement below will you consider to be correct?" So which options are correct.

But looking back, let me make sure about the eigenvectors.

The matrix S is:

0   -i
i    0

The eigenvalues of S are ±1. So for eigenvalue +1:

We solve (S - I)|v> = 0, where I is identity matrix.

So S - I = [ [-1, -i], [i, -1] ]

The equations are:

- v1 -i v2 = 0

i v1 - v2 = 0

From first equation: v1 = -i v2.

From second equation: i v1 = v2.

Substituting v1 from first into second: i (-i v2) = v2 → (i * -i) v2 = v2 → ( (-i^2) ) v2 = v2 → ( - (-1) ) v2 = v2 → (1) v2 = v2. So it holds.

So eigenvector can be chosen as v2 = 1, v1 = -i → [ -i, 1 ]^T.

Similarly for eigenvalue -1: S + I = [[1, -i], [i, 1]]

(1)v1 -i v2 =0

i v1 +v2 =0

From first equation: v1 = i v2.

Second equation: i (i v2) + v2 = (-1) v2 + v2 =0 → 0=0.

So eigenvector is v1 = i v2, v2 =1 → [i, 1]^T.

So the eigenvectors are [ -i, 1 ]^T and [i, 1 ]^T.

These are the eigenfunctions φ.

So these form a basis for the 2D space, so option D is correct.

So both options C and D are correct statements. But wait, looking back at the options, I must have made a mistake because the options can't have multiple correct answers. Let me recheck the question.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct during the calculation. So perhaps I should look for which of the options is a true statement.

Option C says the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. That's correct.

Option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. Which is correct because the eigenvectors form a basis.

But the options are presented as four possible answers, and the question is a multiple-choice where only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong in thinking that both are correct. Let me re-examine.

The question is about the operator Ay. The eigenfunctions are the basis functions for the operator. Since Ay is a 2x2 matrix, its eigenvectors form a basis for a two-dimensional space. So any vector can be expressed in terms of these eigenvectors. So option D is correct.

But the first part of option C is correct as well. So why are both options C and D correct? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that A² commutes with Ay. Let me think about that.

A² is the sum of squares of A_x, A_y, and A_z. So does A² commute with Ay? Let's compute [A², Ay] = A² Ay - Ay A². Since A² = A_x² + A_y² + A_z².

So [A², Ay] = [A_x² + A_y² + A_z², Ay] = [A_x², Ay] + [A_y², Ay] + [A_z², Ay].

Since [A_i, A_j] = iħ ε_ijk A_k, for i≠j, and [A_i, A_i] =0.

So, let's compute [A_x², Ay] = A_x A_x Ay - Ay A_x A_x.

But A_x and Ay don't commute. Hmm, perhaps it's easier to note that [A², Ay] = 0 because A² is the Casimir operator and commutes with all components.

Wait, yes, because the Casimir operator commutes with each component. So [A², Ay] =0. So A² and Ay share eigenstates. So any eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A². So option C is correct.

So both options C and D are correct statements. But looking back, which is correct according to the problem's options.

Wait, but in the given options, perhaps only one is correct. Wait, let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) Imaginary parts ±2πh, real parts ±h/(4π). No, because eigenvalues are real.

B) Imaginary parts ±1/2, real parts ±1. No, eigenvalues are real.

C) Eigenfunctions of Ay can also be eigenfunctions of A², but not Az. Correct.

D) The eigenfunctions are the basis functions of Ay. Also correct.

So, if both C and D are correct, but the options are presented as four options with only one correct, perhaps the question has a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question is about which statement is correct, and both C and D are correct, but the options are such that only C is correct. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about option D.

Wait, option D says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So, the eigenvectors form a basis for the space on which Ay acts. Since Ay is 2x2, it's acting on a two-dimensional space, and two eigenvectors (if they are distinct) form a basis. So D is correct.

So the question now is: which of the options is correct. So both C and D are correct statements. But that can't be, as the question gives four options, each a single letter.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about option C. Let me think again.

Suppose a state is an eigenstate of Ay. Then, because A² commutes with Ay, the state must be an eigenstate of A². So, yes, C's first part is correct.

But does A² include all components? Well, A² is A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2. So yes, any state that is an eigenstate of Ay is an eigenstate of A².

But, what about the other components, like A_x and A_z? No, they don't commute with Ay, so the eigenstates of Ay are not eigenstates of A_x or A_z. So C's second part is correct.

So both C and D are correct. But in the given options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the initial setup again. The problem states that the operator Ay is a 2x2 matrix; hence, it's a spin-1/2 system. So, the possible eigenvalues for Ay are ± ħ/2. So, in terms of h, since ħ = h/(2π), the eigenvalues are ± h/(4π).

Looking at the options, none directly state this. So the correct eigenvalues would be ± h/(4π), which is real.

So, the correct statements are C and D. But in the given options, perhaps both are correct, but only one of them is an option.

But the options are A, B, C, D, so perhaps the correct answer is C and D.

Wait, but this is a multiple-choice question, so only one option can be correct. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only about the statements and not about the eigenvalues.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option again.

Option A: The eigenvalues have imaginary parts ±2πh and real ±h/(4π). No, eigenvalues are real.

Option B: Imaginary ±1/2, real ±1. No, same issue.

Option C: Correct statement.

Option D: Correct statement.

So in reality, both C and D are correct. But the question says which statement is correct. So I must choose between C and D.

Wait, the question says during the calculation, which statement is correct.

Wait, perhaps the key is to look at the operator's matrix. The matrix S is the Pauli Y matrix. So, the eigenfunctions are the eigenstates of S. S is a Hermitian matrix, so its eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis.

So, the eigenfunctions φ are indeed the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay (since Ay is c*S, and the eigenvectors of S are the same as those of Ay). So, D is correct.

But C is also correct because the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A².

Wait, but if the question is a multiple-choice, perhaps the correct option is C and D. But since it's presented as four options, perhaps the intended correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is incorrect, and only D is correct. Let me think.

Wait, the square of the angular momentum operator, A², is (A_x)^2 + (A_y)^2 + (A_z)^2. So, for a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenvalues of A² are ( (ħ/2)^2 ) (s(s+1) ), where s=1/2. So, A² has eigenvalue (ħ/2)(3/2) ħ/2 *3/2 )= 3ħ²/4.

So, for any eigenstate of Ay, which has eigenvalue ± ħ/2, applying A² would give 3ħ²/4. So yes, the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A². So option C is correct.

Therefore, both options C and D are correct, but the problem likely expects only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the options are incorrect in presentation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the problem.

Wait, perhaps the matrix S is 2x2, so the eigenvectors form a basis, making D correct. But perhaps the given options are incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of another approach. Perhaps I should compute the actual eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Compute eigenvectors for S, then for A_y.

As earlier, the eigenvalues of S are ±1.

For eigenvalue +1, the eigenvector is [ -i, 1 ]^T.

For eigenvalue -1, it's [i, 1 ]^T.

Then, the matrix A_y is c * S, where c= h/(4π).

So the eigenvalues of A_y are c*(+1) and c*(-1), so ± h/(4π).

Thus, the eigenvalues are real, so any option suggesting complex eigenvalues is wrong. So options A and B are incorrect.

So, the correct statements must be C or D.

Now, the question is whether the eigenfunctions are also eigenfunctions of A² (which they are) and not of Az.

So, option C is correct.

Additionally, the eigenvectors form a basis, so D is correct.

But in the given options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the question is which statement during the calculation is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is C, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, the statement in D: the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay. So, the eigenvectors form a basis for the 2D space. So, D is correct.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think: the problem is a multiple-choice question, and only one option is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct because the eigenfunctions are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

So, the correct answer is C.


The problem involves the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator, \( A_y \), for a muon. The operator is represented as \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is a 2×2 matrix given as:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & -i \\ 
i & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The task is to determine which statement about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( A_y \) is correct.

---

### Key Analysis:

1. **Eigenvalues of \( A_y \):**
   - The matrix \( S \) is the Pauli Y matrix, which has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \).
   - Since \( A_y = c \cdot S \) and \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \), the eigenvalues of \( A_y \) are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \).
   - These eigenvalues are real because \( S \) (and thus \( A_y \)) is Hermitian.

   **Analysis of Options A and B:**
   - **Option A:** Claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm 2\pi h \) and real parts \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are entirely real.
   - **Option B:** Claims the eigenvalues have imaginary parts \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \) and real parts \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \).

2. **Eigenvectors of \( A_y \):**
   - The eigenvectors of \( S \) (and hence \( A_y \)) are orthogonal and form a basis for the 2D space. For \( S \), the eigenvectors are:
     - For eigenvalue \( +1 \): \( \begin{bmatrix} -i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \),
     - For eigenvalue \( -1 \): \( \begin{bmatrix} i \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).
   - These eigenvectors are also the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \).

   **Analysis of Option D:**
   - **Option D:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is correct because the eigenvectors form a complete basis for the 2D space on which \( A_y \) acts.

3. **Relation to \( A^2 \) and \( A_z \):**
   - \( A^2 \) is the Casimir operator of the angular momentum, defined as \( A^2 = A_x^2 + A_y^2 + A_z^2 \). Since \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), any eigenstate of \( A_y \) is also an eigenstate of \( A^2 \).
   - However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are not eigenfunctions of \( A_z \).

   **Analysis of Option C:**
   - **Option C:** States that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), while \( A_z \) does not.

---

### Conclusion:
Both options **C** and **D** are correct statements. However, since the question asks for a single correct answer, **C** is the most appropriate choice because it highlights the relationship between \( A_y \), \( A^2 \), and \( A_z \), which is more directly relevant to the eigenvalue problem.

**Answer: C**
