Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as A_y = c · S, where c is h/(4π). Oh wait, S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices used to represent spin-1/2 particles. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Oh wait, but S here looks a lot like σy, right? Because σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. So S is actually the Pauli Y matrix. That makes sense.

So the operator A_y is c times σy. Since c is h/(4π), then A_y = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Now, the question is asking about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix Ay.

Let me write down the matrix Ay. Since σy is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], multiplying by c = h/(4π) gives:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Which is:
[[0, -i*(h/(4π))],
 [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

So the matrix is:
[ [0, -i h/(4π) ],
  [i h/(4π), 0 ] ]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the characteristic equation. The eigenvalues a satisfy det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix Ay - a I is:
[[-a, -i h/(4π) ],
 [i h/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]= a² - [ (-i)(i) (h²/(16 π²)) ) ]

Wait, let's compute that. The product of (-i h/(4π)) and (i h/(4π)) = (-i)(i) * (h²/(16 π²)).

What's (-i)(i)? i times i is -1, and since it's (-i)(i) = - (i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the product is 1*(h²/(16 π²)).

So the determinant equation becomes a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4 π )

Wait, but wait, because I might have made a mistake in the signs. Let me double-check.

The determinant is (Ay - a I) = [[-a, -i h/(4π)], [i h/(4π), -a]]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]

Which is a² - [ (-i)(i) * (h²/(16 π²)) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) * 1.

So a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4 π )

So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4 π ) and a = -h/(4 π )

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2π h or ±h/(2 π ). Wait, no, let me look again.

Option A says:

A) The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, and the real part of that are +h/4π or –h/4π.

Wait, but the eigenvalues I got are real numbers, right? Because Pauli matrices have real eigenvalues when multiplied by a real constant. So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 π ), which are real. Therefore, their imaginary parts are zero, and the real parts are ± h/(4 π )

Looking at the options, option A states that the imaginary parts are ± 2πh, which can't be right because our eigenvalues are real. So option A's statement is incorrect because the eigenvalues are real, which would have zero imaginary parts.

Option B: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are +1/2 or –1/2, and the real parts are +1 or –1. Hmm, but our eigenvalues are ±h/(4π ), which are real. So, unless h/(4π ) is equal to 1, which it's not unless we're in some weird units. So option B is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are real and not complex.

Option C: The eigenfunction φ of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Hmm, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the square of the angular momentum (like L²) commutes with each component (Lx, Ly, Lz). So if a function is an eigenfunction of Lx, it is also an eigenfunction of L², but not necessarily of another component like Lz.

In this case, Ay is a component of the angular momentum. A² would be (Ay)^2 + (Az)^2 + (Ax)^2, but wait, wait. Wait, the operator A is the intrinsic angular momentum, which for a muon (spin 1/2) would have components Ax, Ay, Az. So A² = Ax² + Ay² + Az². But since Ay is a component of A, any eigenstate of Ay will be an eigenstate of A² because [Ay, A²] = 0. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A².

But what about Az? The components of angular momentum don't commute with each other. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it won't be an eigenfunction of Az (unless in the case where Az shares an eigenfunction, which is only possible when the states are simultaneous eigenstates, which they aren't in general).

So option C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. That would be correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, the matrix is 2x2, which suggests that it's acting in a two-dimensional space, which is typical for spin-1/2 particles. The eigenfunctions of Ay would form a basis for the space. So any vector in the space can be expressed as a combination of these eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions are a basis for the operator's space. But the statement in D says "the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Wait, perhaps the question is more about the basis in which the matrix is diagonal. The matrix Ay is given in a certain basis (probably the standard basis, maybe the eigenbasis of Az or something else). If the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions, then in that basis, the matrix would be diagonal. But the question is whether the eigenvectors are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me think: the matrix is given in the standard basis, perhaps. The eigenvectors are orthogonal and form a basis. So the eigenvectors can serve as a basis for the space, but the matrix is given in another basis (like the computational basis). So the statement in D is probably incorrect because the basis functions of the matrix (the standard basis) are not the same as the eigenvectors unless the matrix is diagonal in that basis.

Wait, but the statement says the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator. So, perhaps the matrix is written in the basis of its own eigenvectors. Because any matrix can be diagonalized in its own eigenbasis. So if we're considering the eigenbasis, then the eigenfunctions are the basis functions. But the problem statement says that the matrix is given as Ay, which is given with S as [[0,-i],[i,0]]. So the matrix is in the standard basis, not necessarily the eigenbasis.

Alternatively, the statement D says that the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the operator. So the operator is represented in the eigenbasis. But the matrix given is not diagonal; it's in the standard basis. So the statement D is incorrect because the eigenfunctions are not the basis of the matrix as presented.

So, to recap:

Eigenvalues: ± h/(4π ), real numbers.

Option C is correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

So, looking back at the options:

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Yes, that's correct. Because A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions. But Az doesn't commute with Ay, so their eigenfunctions are different.

So the correct answer is option C.

The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix \( A_y \) is therefore:

\[
A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
To find the eigenvalues \( a \), solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). The matrix \( A_y - aI \) is:

\[
A_y - aI = \begin{bmatrix} -a & -i\frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i\frac{h}{4\pi} & -a \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y - aI) = (-a)(-a) - \left(-i\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)\left(i\frac{h}{4\pi}\right).
\]

Simplify the second term:

\[
\left(-i\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)\left(i\frac{h}{4\pi}\right) = -i^2 \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} = \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2}.
\]

Thus, the characteristic equation becomes:

\[
a^2 - \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} = 0 \implies a^2 = \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} \implies a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

The eigenvalues are therefore \( a = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( a = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \), both real numbers.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Options
#### **Option A**:
This option claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are entirely real, with no imaginary parts.

#### **Option B**:
This option claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

#### **Option C**:
This option states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of the \( Z \)-component \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), meaning they share eigenfunctions. However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so their eigenfunctions are different.

#### **Option D**:
This option claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is incorrect because the matrix \( A_y \) is given in the standard basis, not necessarily the eigenbasis of \( A_y \). The eigenfunctions form a basis for the space but are not the basis of the matrix as presented.

### Conclusion
The correct statement is **Option C**, as the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \).

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about the Y-component of the intrinsic angular momentum operator for a muon. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll think it through.

The question says that the operator A_y is represented by a 2x2 matrix, which is given as A_y = c · S, where c is h/(4π). Oh wait, S is another 2x2 matrix. The first row of S is (0, -i), and the second row is (i, 0). So S looks like this:

S = [[0, -i],
     [i, 0]]

I remember that in quantum mechanics, the Pauli matrices are 2x2 matrices used to represent spin-1/2 particles. The Pauli matrices are σx, σy, σz. Oh wait, but S here looks a lot like σy, right? Because σy is [[0,-i],[i,0]]. So S is actually the Pauli Y matrix. That makes sense.

So the operator A_y is c times σy. Since c is h/(4π), then A_y = (h/(4π)) * σy.

Now, the question is asking about the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A_y. So I need to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix Ay.

Let me write down the matrix Ay. Since σy is [[0, -i],[i, 0]], multiplying by c = h/(4π) gives:

Ay = (h/(4π)) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
Which is:
[[0, -i*(h/(4π))],
 [i*(h/(4π)), 0]]

So the matrix is:
[ [0, -i h/(4π) ],
  [i h/(4π), 0 ] ]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the characteristic equation. The eigenvalues a satisfy det(Ay - a I) = 0.

So the matrix Ay - a I is:
[[-a, -i h/(4π) ],
 [i h/(4π), -a ] ]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ) ]= a² - [ (-i)(i) (h²/(16 π²)) ) ]

Wait, let's compute that. The product of (-i h/(4π)) and (i h/(4π)) = (-i)(i) * (h²/(16 π²)).

What's (-i)(i)? i times i is -1, and since it's (-i)(i) = - (i^2) = -(-1) = 1. So the product is 1*(h²/(16 π²)).

So the determinant equation becomes a² - (h²/(16 π²)) = 0.

So a² = h²/(16 π²)

Taking square roots, a = ± h/(4 π )

Wait, but wait, because I might have made a mistake in the signs. Let me double-check.

The determinant is (Ay - a I) = [[-a, -i h/(4π)], [i h/(4π), -a]]

The determinant is (-a)(-a) - [ (-i h/(4π)) * (i h/(4π)) ]

Which is a² - [ (-i)(i) * (h²/(16 π²)) ]

Wait, (-i)(i) is -i² = -(-1) = 1. So the determinant is a² - (h²/(16 π²)) * 1.

So a² = h²/(16 π²) → a = ± h/(4 π )

So the eigenvalues are a = h/(4 π ) and a = -h/(4 π )

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the imaginary part of the eigenvalue are ±2π h or ±h/(2 π ). Wait, no, let me look again.

Option A says:

A) The imaginary part of the eigenvalue of Ay are +2πh or –2πh, and the real part of that are +h/4π or –h/4π.

Wait, but the eigenvalues I got are real numbers, right? Because Pauli matrices have real eigenvalues when multiplied by a real constant. So the eigenvalues are ± h/(4 π ), which are real. Therefore, their imaginary parts are zero, and the real parts are ± h/(4 π )

Looking at the options, option A states that the imaginary parts are ± 2πh, which can't be right because our eigenvalues are real. So option A's statement is incorrect because the eigenvalues are real, which would have zero imaginary parts.

Option B: The imaginary part of the eigenvalue are +1/2 or –1/2, and the real parts are +1 or –1. Hmm, but our eigenvalues are ±h/(4π ), which are real. So, unless h/(4π ) is equal to 1, which it's not unless we're in some weird units. So option B is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are real and not complex.

Option C: The eigenfunction φ of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A², but not of the Z-component, Az.

Hmm, I remember that for angular momentum operators, the square of the angular momentum (like L²) commutes with each component (Lx, Ly, Lz). So if a function is an eigenfunction of Lx, it is also an eigenfunction of L², but not necessarily of another component like Lz.

In this case, Ay is a component of the angular momentum. A² would be (Ay)^2 + (Az)^2 + (Ax)^2, but wait, wait. Wait, the operator A is the intrinsic angular momentum, which for a muon (spin 1/2) would have components Ax, Ay, Az. So A² = Ax² + Ay² + Az². But since Ay is a component of A, any eigenstate of Ay will be an eigenstate of A² because [Ay, A²] = 0. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it's also an eigenfunction of A².

But what about Az? The components of angular momentum don't commute with each other. So if φ is an eigenfunction of Ay, it won't be an eigenfunction of Az (unless in the case where Az shares an eigenfunction, which is only possible when the states are simultaneous eigenstates, which they aren't in general).

So option C says that the eigenfunctions can be eigenfunctions of A² but not Az. That would be correct because the eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A² but not of Az.

Option D: The eigenfunctions φ of the operator Ay are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above.

Wait, the matrix is 2x2, which suggests that it's acting in a two-dimensional space, which is typical for spin-1/2 particles. The eigenfunctions of Ay would form a basis for the space. So any vector in the space can be expressed as a combination of these eigenfunctions. So the eigenfunctions are a basis for the operator's space. But the statement in D says "the eigenfunctions are the basis functions of the matrix operator Ay given above."

Wait, perhaps the question is more about the basis in which the matrix is diagonal. The matrix Ay is given in a certain basis (probably the standard basis, maybe the eigenbasis of Az or something else). If the eigenfunctions φ are the basis functions, then in that basis, the matrix would be diagonal. But the question is whether the eigenvectors are the basis functions of the matrix operator.

Option C is correct because eigenfunctions of Ay are eigenfunctions of A², but not of Az.

Option C: The eigenfunction of Ay can also be an eigenfunction of A^2, but not of the Z-component, Az.

Yes, that's correct. Because A² commutes with Ay, so they share eigenfunctions. But Az doesn't commute with Ay, so their eigenfunctions are different.

So the correct answer is option C.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the operator \( A_y = c \cdot S \), where \( c = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( S \) is the Pauli \( Y \)-matrix:

\[
S = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The matrix \( A_y \) is therefore:

\[
A_y = \frac{h}{4\pi} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( A_y \)
To find the eigenvalues \( a \), solve the characteristic equation \( \det(A_y - aI) = 0 \). The matrix \( A_y - aI \) is:

\[
A_y - aI = \begin{bmatrix} -a & -i\frac{h}{4\pi} \\ i\frac{h}{4\pi} & -a \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The determinant is:

\[
\det(A_y - aI) = (-a)(-a) - \left(-i\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)\left(i\frac{h}{4\pi}\right).
\]

Simplify the second term:

\[
\left(-i\frac{h}{4\pi}\right)\left(i\frac{h}{4\pi}\right) = -i^2 \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} = \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2}.
\]

Thus, the characteristic equation becomes:

\[
a^2 - \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} = 0 \implies a^2 = \frac{h^2}{16\pi^2} \implies a = \pm \frac{h}{4\pi}.
\]

The eigenvalues are therefore \( a = \frac{h}{4\pi} \) and \( a = -\frac{h}{4\pi} \), both real numbers.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Options
#### **Option A**:
This option claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm 2\pi h \), and the real parts are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \). This is incorrect because the eigenvalues are entirely real, with no imaginary parts.

#### **Option B**:
This option claims that the imaginary parts of the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \), and the real parts are \( \pm 1 \). This is also incorrect because the eigenvalues are \( \pm \frac{h}{4\pi} \), not \( \pm 1 \) or \( \pm \frac{1}{2} \).

#### **Option C**:
This option states that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) can also be eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \), but not of the \( Z \)-component \( A_z \). This is correct because \( A^2 \) commutes with \( A_y \), meaning they share eigenfunctions. However, \( A_y \) and \( A_z \) do not commute, so their eigenfunctions are different.

#### **Option D**:
This option claims that the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are the basis functions of the matrix operator \( A_y \). This is incorrect because the matrix \( A_y \) is given in the standard basis, not necessarily the eigenbasis of \( A_y \). The eigenfunctions form a basis for the space but are not the basis of the matrix as presented.

### Conclusion
The correct statement is **Option C**, as the eigenfunctions of \( A_y \) are eigenfunctions of \( A^2 \) but not of \( A_z \).
