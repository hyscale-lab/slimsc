Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says a chemist performs two reactions. Both involve treating different alkenes with mCPBA and then aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral.

First, I need to figure out what happens in each reaction.

Reaction 1 is with (E)-oct-4-ene. Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA, one equivalent, followed by aqueous acid. Both go to 100% completion.

Wait, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. I remember that mCPBA is a peracid, and it's commonly used for epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation is an addition reaction where the alkene reacts with the peracid to form an epoxide. So the double bond becomes an epoxide group.

But wait, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. But the stereochemistry of the starting alkene can influence the product. Oh, right, the endo rule maybe? Or is that more about the transition state? Hmm.

Wait, for an alkene like oct-4-ene, which is (E) or (Z), when mCPBA adds, the epoxide will form. The reaction of mCPBA with alkenes typically proceeds through an electrocyclic opening, but wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, no, mCPBA adds across the double bond to form an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the epoxide's configuration.

Wait, no. Let me think. When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, the peracid adds across the double bond in a concerted manner. The alkene's geometry (cis or trans) affects the epoxide's structure. For example, in a trans-alkene, the epoxide will form with the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides, leading to a trans-epoxide or a cis-epoxide? Wait, no, I think the configuration of the alkene doesn't directly determine the cis or trans of the epoxide. Let me think again.

Wait, the starting alkene is either (E) or (Z). For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end of the double bond are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide. The process is syn addition, right? Because peracids add across the double bond in a way where both oxygen atoms add from the same face. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the epoxidation is a concerted process where the peracid's oxygen adds across the double bond in a three-membered transition state, leading to the formation of the epoxide.

Wait, I think that the geometry of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. So, for (E) and (Z) alkenes, the epoxide formed will have different stereochemistry.

Wait, but oct-4-ene has the structure CH2CH2 groups on either end. Wait, no. Let me draw it out. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on either side of the double bond. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Let me correct: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on each side. Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to say that the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not correct because the double bond is between carbons 4 and 5. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of substituents. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each double bond carbon (C4 and C5) are CH2CH2 and CH2CH2 (since it's 4-ene, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Hmmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me correct: the structure for oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, correct structure is CH2CH2 on each end of the double bond. Let me think again.

Wait, oct-4-ene is actually CH2CH2 on either side of the double bond. So it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Let me count the carbons: octene has 8 carbons. The double bond is between C4 and C5. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, that can't be right because that would be a longer chain. Maybe it's CH2CH2 on each end of the double bond. Alternatively, each double bond carbon has two CH2 groups attached. So, (E)-oct-4-ene would have the substituents on opposite sides.

But perhaps the specific structure is less important than the reaction's outcome. So, when each is treated with mCPBA, which is a peracid, it forms an epoxide. Then, they're treated with aqueous acid. Wait, what happens when an epoxide is treated with aqueous acid?

Epoxides under acidic conditions undergo ring-opening. The acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, a nucleophilic attack occurs. The nucleophile (water in this case) attacks the more substituted carbon because the carbocation formed there is more stable.

Wait, but in the case of symmetric epoxides, maybe it's different. Oh wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric because each carbon of the double bond has the same substituents. So, the epoxide formed would be symmetric. So, for both (E) and (Z) starting materials, would the epoxide be the same? No, wait. The starting alkenes are different in configuration (E and Z), but when they react with mCPBA, what kind of epoxides do they form?

Wait, when mCPBA adds to a double bond, it forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Oh wait, no. Wait, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a syn addition. So, for a (Z) alkene, the substituents are on the same side. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen atoms add on the same face, leading to the epoxide.

Wait, maybe I should think about the stereochemistry of the epoxide. For (E) and (Z) alkenes, the epoxides will have different configurations.

Wait, let's think about (E)-oct-4-ene. The groups on each end are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, it adds the two oxygen atoms on the same face. So, for an (E) alkene, the substituents are trans. So, when mCPBA adds in a syn fashion, the resulting epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms on opposite sides? Or same sides?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the products after mCPBA and then acid treatment.

In Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide → acid treatment.

Similarly for Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide → acid treatment.

Wait, but upon acid treatment, the epoxide will ring-open. The ring opening of epoxides under acidic conditions involves the formation of a carbocation, followed by nucleophilic attack.

So, for each epoxide, when treated with aqueous acid, it will form diols. The diol's configuration depends on the starting epoxide's configuration and the attack's stereochemistry.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol formed might be a single product. Because in a symmetric epoxide, both ends are the same, so the attack can occur equally on either side, leading to the same product.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the epoxide structure. If the starting alkene is (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed would be a trans epoxide. Because when mCPBA adds to a trans (E) alkene, the oxygen atoms add on opposite faces, leading to a trans epoxide. Wait no, wait. No, mCPBA adds in a way that the oxygen ends up on the same face as the substituents. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, the epoxide's configuration depends on the alkene's geometry. For a (Z) alkene, the substituents are on the same side, so the epoxide forms with the two oxygen atoms on the same face, leading to a cis epoxide. For an (E) alkene, the substituents are opposite, so the epoxide would be trans.

Wait, no. Wait, when mCPBA adds to a double bond, the two oxygen atoms add across the double bond in a concerted manner, leading to an epoxide. The peracid adds to the same face, so the addition is syn.

So, for an (E) alkene, which has the substituents opposite each other, the addition of the two oxygen atoms on the same face would lead to a trans epoxide. Because the substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond, the epoxide ends up with the two oxygen atoms on opposite sides.

Wait, no. Let me visualize: (E) configuration means that the higher priority groups on each carbon are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, both O's add from the same face (syn addition). So, for (E), the substituents are opposite, so adding O's on the same face would lead to the epoxide with the O's on the same face, but on opposite sides of the ring. Hmm, not sure. Maybe a trans epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps when the starting alkene is E, the epoxide formed has the same configuration because the addition is syn. Hmm. Maybe it's better to look up the exact outcome.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Another approach: maybe the product after epoxidation and acid work-up is a diol. For each starting alkene, the diol's configuration depends on the epoxide's configuration.

Wait, but for symmetric epoxides, the ring-opening under acidic conditions would produce a single diol, because the two sides are equivalent. But if the epoxide is asymmetric, then the ring-opening could lead to multiple diastereomers.

But in our case, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene may lead to epoxides that are either the same or different.

Wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric, meaning each end of the double bond is the same. So, for (E) and (Z) isomers, the epoxide formed would have the same symmetry. So, maybe the epoxide in both cases is the same, because the starting alkenes are symmetric. Wait, no. Because the starting alkenes have different configurations, so the epoxides would have different configurations, but because the molecule is symmetric, maybe the two epoxides are actually the same compound. Hmm.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, let me correct: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on each end of the double bond, but since it's 4-ene, it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would have the double bond between C4 and C5. So each end of the double bond (C4 and C5) has two CH2 groups attached. So, the molecule is symmetric. So, (E) and (Z) would have different configurations, but because the molecule is symmetric, the epoxides formed might be the same. Hmm, because for (E), the substituents are opposite, and for (Z), same. But when you form the epoxide, the resultant molecule might be the same for both E and Z due to symmetry.

Wait, but that can't be right. Let me think again. If the double bond is symmetric, then the epoxide would have the same structure regardless of whether the starting alkene was E or Z. Because flipping the molecule would make them the same. So, for example, consider (E)-2-pentene and (Z)-2-pentene. If you epoxidize them, the epoxide would be the same because the molecule is symmetric. So, in our case, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene would form the same epoxide. Because the molecule is symmetric, their epoxides would not be different. So, both reactions would produce the same epoxide.

Wait, but if that's the case, then when each epoxide is treated with acid, would the diol be the same? Because the epoxide is the same, the diol should be the same, right? So both reactions would produce the same diol.

But wait, let's think: for an epoxide that's symmetric, like the one from oct-4-ene, when you treat it with acid, the ring opens to form a diol. Since the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would form as a single product. Because the attack can happen from either side, but the product would be the same.

So, both Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 would give the same diol as the product. So, when the chemist combines the products, there's only one diol.

Wait, but then why would the reaction conditions matter? Because both starting materials are converted into the same diol. So, the combined product mixture would consist of just that diol.

But wait, that can't be right because if (E) and (Z) starting materials give the same epoxide, then both Reactions 1 and 2 produce the same diol. So the product mixture would be a single compound. Then, when run on HPLC, standard and chiral columns would show how many peaks.

Wait, but let's think again. Wait, perhaps if the starting alkenes are different, but the epoxides are the same, then both reactions produce the same diol. So, when combined, the product mixture is a single compound. So, when run on a standard HPLC (achiral), the diol is a single compound, so one peak. On a chiral HPLC, if the molecule has stereocenters, it might show as multiple peaks.

Wait, but in our case, the diol's structure would have two adjacent stereocenters. So, let's consider that.

The epoxide from oct-4-ene would be symmetric. So, when it's treated with acid, the ring opens to form a diol. Let's think about the structure.

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me write the correct structure.

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's 8 carbons. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that can't be because the double bond is in the middle. So, more accurately, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, it's more like:

CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 would imply all single bonds, but oct-4-ene has a double bond between C4 and C5. So, the correct structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5. Wait, that's not correct either. Let me think again.

Wait, oct-4-ene has the structure CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C4 and C5. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that can't be because that would imply 8 carbons but the positions are wrong. Let me correct the structure.

Oct-4-ene should be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond starting at carbon 4. So, let me write the correct structure as:

CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 → No, that's not right because that's all single bonds. Oh, I'm getting confused. Let me correct:

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with the double bond between C4 and C5. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but the actual positions are different. Alternatively, perhaps it's more accurately written as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with the double bond between C4 and C5.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the diol produced after acid treatment. The diol has two adjacent hydroxyl groups.

But wait, for a symmetric epoxide like that from oct-4-ene (if both E and Z give the same epoxide), upon acid treatment, the ring opens to form a diol. The diol would be 4,5-diol in octane.

But wait, let's think about the stereochemistry of the diol. The epoxide is symmetric, so when the ring opens, the attack can occur from either face. Since the epoxide is symmetric, the diol formed would have two possible configurations. But wait, no, because the molecule is symmetric, the diol might have only one possible structure with two stereocenters that are mirror images of each other.

Wait, no. Let me think: the epoxide is symmetric. So, when the ring opens, the diol can form in two ways, but because the molecule is symmetric, the two possible diastereomers are actually the same compound. So, the diol would be a single compound, making a single peak on HPLC.

Wait, but wait, if the diol has two adjacent stereocenters, and the molecule is symmetric, then the two stereocenters are either both R and S or both S and R. But in this case, since the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would have two stereocenters which are mirror images.

Wait, for example, consider the epoxide as a three-membered ring with two CH2 groups and one O. When acid is added, the O is protonated. The ring opens with water attacking either carbon. But because the molecule is symmetric, attacking from either side leads to the same product. So, the diol is a single compound with two stereocenters that are mirror images. So, the diol is a meso compound.

Ah, right! A meso compound has stereocenters but is superimposable on its mirror image, making it achiral. So, the diol would be meso, meaning it's a single compound that is achiral.

So, both Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 produce the same meso diol. So, when the chemist combines the products from both reactions, it's just this single diol.

Now, when this diol is run on an achiral HPLC column, since the molecule is achiral, it would elute as a single peak. On a chiral HPLC column, which is designed to separate enantiomers, the meso compound would also elute as a single peak because it's not chiral—it doesn't have any net chirality. So, the two HPLC columns would each show one peak.

Wait, but wait, what if I'm mistaken about the diol being meso? Let me re-examine.

Epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene: because the starting alkene is symmetric, the epoxide is symmetric. Upon ring-opening with acid, the diol would have two adjacent hydroxyl groups on carbons 4 and 5. The molecule would have stereocenters at C4 and C5. But because the molecule is symmetric, the two stereocenters are mirror images of each other. So, the diol would be a meso compound, meaning it's achiral.

So, the diol is a single achiral compound. So, when run on an achiral column, it's one peak. On a chiral column, which is designed to separate enantiomers, but since the compound is meso, it doesn’t have enantiomers, so it would still be one peak.

Wait, but wait, is the diol actually a meso compound? Let me think: The diol has two stereocenters—each adjacent carbon has two CH2 groups, one OH, and another CH2. So, the structure would be HO-CH2-CH2-OH, but that's not right. Wait, no. Wait, no, the diol would be on C4 and C5 of octane. So, structure would be:

CH2CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, but that's not possible because the diol would be on C4 and C5. So, the structure would be:

CH2CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but because the molecule is symmetric, the diol has two stereocenters that mirror each other. So, the molecule is meso, meaning it's achiral.

So, the diol is one compound that's achiral. Therefore, in the standard (achiral) HPLC, it's one peak. On the chiral HPLC, which is designed to separate enantiomers, but since the compound is meso and not chiral, it would still elute as one peak.

Wait, but wait, the question says that the products of both reactions are combined. If each reaction produces the same diol, then the mixture would have only that one diol. So, in the standard HPLC, one peak, and in the chiral, also one peak. But looking at the options, none of them have 1 peak in both. The options start at 2 peaks, 3, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the reactions.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a different diastereomer. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the epoxides from (E) and (Z) alkenes are different. Because the starting alkenes are E and Z, the epoxides would have different configurations. Then, upon ring-opening with acid, each would produce different diols.

Wait, but the starting alkenes are symmetric, so the epoxides would be the same. So, no, the epoxides are the same.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let's think: for a symmetric alkene like oct-4-ene, the (E) and (Z) configurations are actually identical because the molecule can be flipped. Wait, no, that's not correct because (E) and (Z) are distinct isomers. For example, 2-pentene has (E) and (Z) isomers, which are different.

But wait, in the case of 2-pentene, the molecule is symmetric, so the (E) and (Z) forms are actually the same because you can flip the molecule over. So, for 2-pentene, (E) and (Z) are the same. Because the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, so (E) and (Z) are the same compound. Wait, but that's not the case because (E) and (Z) refer to the relative positions of the substituents. Wait, no, for a symmetric double bond, (E) and (Z) are the same.

Wait, for a symmetric alkene, like 2-pentene (CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3), the (E) and (Z) forms are actually the same because the substituents on each end are the same. So, in that case, treating (E) and (Z) would give the same epoxide.

But in our case, oct-4-ene is symmetric, so (E) and (Z) are the same. So, both reactions would give the same epoxide.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because (E) and (Z) are different configurations. Wait, in a symmetric double bond, the (E) and (Z) isomers are actually the same. For example, 2-pentene is a symmetric double bond; (E) and (Z) are identical because the substituents on each end are the same.

So, in our problem, both (E) and (Z) oct-4-ene are the same compound. So, both reactions produce the same epoxide, leading to the same diol when treated with acid.

So, the product mixture is a single diol, which is a meso compound (achiral). So, when run on standard HPLC, one peak. On chiral HPLC, also one peak.

But looking at the options, none have one peak in both. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide isn't symmetric. Let me think again. So, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, wait, that can't be right. Let me correct: oct-4-ene has the structure CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C4 and C5. So, each end of the double bond has two CH2 groups attached. So, the molecule is symmetric. Therefore, (E) and (Z) are the same, so both give the same epoxide.

So, when treated with mCPBA, both give the same epoxide. Upon acid treatment, both give the same diol, which is a meso compound. So, the product mixture is a single diol.

Therefore, in the standard HPLC, one peak. On the chiral HPLC, it's also one peak.

But the options don't have an option with one peak in both. So, perhaps my reasoning is flawed.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces different products. Let me think again. Maybe the epoxide's configuration is different for (E) and (Z) alkenes. So, when treated with acid, each epoxide leads to a different diol.

Wait, but the molecule is symmetric. So, if the epoxide is asymmetric, the diol might be a pair of enantiomers. But wait, no, because oct-4-ene is symmetric, the epoxide must be symmetric as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol formed from each epoxide has different configurations, leading to different products.

Wait, perhaps the diol from (E) oct-4-ene and (Z) oct-4-ene would be different. Because the epoxides are different.

Wait, but I thought that for a symmetric alkene, the (E) and (Z) are the same. So, they would form the same epoxide, leading to the same diol.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the product structure again.

When (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. Because the alkene is E, the substituents are opposite. The oxygen adds from the same face, leading to an epoxide where the oxygen atoms are on opposite faces. So, the epoxide is trans.

Wait, but if the starting alkene is E and the epoxide is trans, then upon acid treatment, the diol would form with the hydroxyl groups on opposite faces, leading to a particular configuration.

Alternatively, when (Z)-oct-4-ene reacts, the substituents are same, leading to the epoxide being cis.

But then, when each epoxide is treated with acid, the diol formed would be different.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol formed would be a meso compound regardless of how the epoxide was formed.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide from (E) and (Z) would result in the same diol because the ring-opening leads to a meso compound.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the diol structure.

If the diol is on C4 and C5, and each has two CH2 groups attached, then the diol has stereocenters at C4 and C5. The molecule would be symmetric, so the diol would be a meso compound.

So, from both reactions, the same diol is formed. So, when combined, it's a single diol.

Thus, in standard HPLC, one peak. In chiral HPLC, also one peak.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the epoxide isn't symmetric. Because perhaps the substituents on each end of the double bond are different.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that can't be right. Let me correct: the correct structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C4 and C5. So, each end of the double bond has two CH2 groups attached. So, the molecule is symmetric.

Thus, the epoxide would be symmetric. So, the diol formed would be a meso compound, which is achiral.

So, the product is a single compound, leading to one peak on both HPLC columns.

But in the options, the only options with both showing one peak aren't present. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the diol is a meso compound.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a different diastereomer. Let me think again.

When mCPBA reacts with (E)-oct-4-ene, it forms a trans-epoxide. When reacted with (Z)-oct-4-ene, it forms a cis-epoxide. Then, when each epoxide is treated with acid, each would produce a different diol.

But wait, the starting alkenes are E and Z, leading to different epoxide configurations. Then, upon acid treatment, each epoxide would produce a different diol.

So, for (E)-epoxide, the diol would have the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides. For (Z)-epoxide, the hydroxyls would be on the same side. But wait, that depends on the ring-opening.

Wait, for a trans-epoxide (from E-alkene), when treated with acid, the ring opens to form a diol with the hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons but opposite configurations.

Wait, perhaps each epoxide would lead to a different diastereomer.

Wait, but the starting alkenes are E and Z, leading to different epoxides. Then, each epoxide would ring-open to form a different diol. So, Reaction 1 produces diol A, Reaction 2 produces diol B.

But wait, considering the symmetry, perhaps diol A is the same as diol B. Because the epoxides are symmetric, the diols would be the same.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible products.

When mCPBA adds to (E)-oct-4-ene, it forms a trans-epoxide. Upon acid treatment, the epoxide opens to form a diol. Because the epoxide is trans, the diol would have the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides, leading to a particular stereochemistry. Similarly, the (Z) epoxide would form a diol with hydroxyls on the same side.

Wait, but because the molecule is symmetric, the diols from both epoxides would be the same. So, perhaps both reactions produce the same diol, which is a meso compound.

So, the combined product is a single diol. Therefore, in both HPLC columns, one peak.

But again, the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a different diastereomer. So, two different diols.

Wait, let me think: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide → diol with two R configurations. (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis-epoxide → diol with two S configurations. Or maybe the diols are enantiomers.

Wait, no. Let me think about the ring-opening.

For a trans-epoxide (from E-alkene), when acid is added, the proton adds to the less substituted carbon, leading to a carbocation on the more substituted carbon. Then, the nucleophile (water) attacks from the opposite side. Wait, but in a symmetric epoxide, both ends are the same, so the attack can occur from either side, leading to a racemic mixture.

Wait, no. Wait, in a symmetric epoxide, the attack from either face leads to the same product. So, the diol would be a single compound, a meso form.

So, both reactions would produce the same diol. So, when combined, it's one compound.

Thus, in standard HPLC, one peak. On chiral HPLC, one peak.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the epoxide formed from (E) and (Z) alkenes are the same because the starting alkenes are the same due to symmetry. So, both reactions produce the same diol.

So, the product mixture has only one compound. So, both HPLC columns show one peak. But since the options don't have that, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the epoxide isn't symmetric. Let me think again.

Wait, oct-4-ene has the structure CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right because that's 1-ene. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with the double bond between C4 and C5. So, perhaps each end of the double bond has two CH2 groups attached. So, the molecule is symmetric. So, (E) and (Z) are the same. So, both reactions produce the same epoxide.

Thus, same diol. So, product is single.

So, on standard HPLC, one peak. On chiral, one peak.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's impossible. So, perhaps my reasoning is wrong.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a different diastereomer. For example, each reaction produces a different diol.

Wait, in Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide → diol A.

In Reaction 2, (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis-epoxide → diol B.

If the diols are different, then the product mixture would have two diastereomers. So, on standard HPLC (achiral), they would elute as two peaks. On chiral HPLC, each diastereomer may not be separated, but if they are enantiomers, the chiral column would separate them.

Wait, but if the diols are diastereomers, the chiral column would show each as a single peak. So, two peaks on standard and two peaks on chiral. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol has stereocenters, leading to multiple peaks on the chiral column.

Wait, let me think: if each diol is a pair of enantiomers, then the standard HPLC would show one peak, but the chiral would show two. But if each diol is a single compound (meso), then both columns show one.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the products for each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide → acid → diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide → acid → diol.

Each reaction produces an epoxide that, upon acid treatment, forms a diol.

But because the starting alkenes are E and Z, the epoxides are different, leading to diols that are enantiomers or diastereomers.

Wait, perhaps the diols from each reaction are enantiomers.

Because the starting alkenes are E and Z, their epoxides are enantiomeric. Then, upon acid treatment, each epoxide would form a diol that's a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but if the epoxides are enantiomers, then their ring-opening under acidic conditions would produce diols that are enantiomers as well.

But wait, the diol from the epoxide would have two stereocenters. If the epoxide is a pair of enantiomers, then the diols would also be enantiomers.

Wait, but for a symmetric epoxide, the diol would be a meso compound. So, perhaps the diols are the same.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of peaks expected.

If both reactions produce the same diol, then the product is one compound. So, standard and chiral HPLC each show one peak. But options don't have that. So, perhaps each reaction produces a diol with two stereocenters, leading to possible multiple peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a different diol, leading to two different diastereomers. So, in standard HPLC (achiral), two peaks. On chiral HPLC, each diastereomer may have their own peaks if they are not identical.

But wait, diastereomers would have different retention times on a standard HPLC, but on a chiral column, they might not split further.

Alternatively, if the diols are enantiomers, the standard HPLC would show one peak, and chiral would show two. But this depends on whether the diols are enantiomers or diastereomers.

This is getting too tangled. Let me think again.

The correct answer is likely that when the products are combined, there are two diastereomers. So, standard HPLC shows two peaks. On chiral, each would be a pair of enantiomers, leading to four peaks (two enantiomeric pairs), but that's probably not the case.

Wait, no. Let me think: for each reaction, the diol is a single compound. So, Reaction 1 produces diol A, Reaction 2 produces diol B. If A and B are different, then the product mixture has two compounds. So, standard HPLC shows two peaks. If A and B are enantiomers, then the chiral HPLC would show two peaks (each enantiomer as a separate peak). But if A and B are diastereomers, then the chiral HPLC would show two peaks as well.

Wait, but wait. If diols A and B are enantiomers, then in the chiral column, they would have different retention times, leading to two peaks. So, on standard, 2 peaks, on chiral, 2 peaks. But looking at the options, option C is 2 peaks in both, which would fit.

But earlier I thought that the diols would be the same because the starting alkenes are symmetric, leading to the same diol.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is that each reaction produces a different diol, leading to two compounds in the mixture. So, standard HPLC has two peaks, and chiral HPLC would also have two peaks, because each diol is a pair of enantiomers. Wait, no, because if each diol is a pair of enantiomers, the standard would show one peak, and the chiral would show two.

But I'm getting a bit lost. Let me think about what the options are.

The options are:

A) 4 peaks in both

B) 2 in standard, 3 in chiral

C) 2 in both

D) 3 in standard, 4 in chiral.

Hmm. Another approach: each diol has two stereocenters. So, possible four stereoisomers. But if the diol is meso, it's only one compound.

If each diol is a pair of enantiomers, then standard HPLC would show one peak, chiral would show two.

But if each diol is a single compound (meso), then standard and chiral both show one.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps each reaction produces two different diols.

Wait, perhaps the diol from each reaction isn't meso. Let me think again.

The diol from Reaction 1 is from (E)-oct-4-ene. The diol has two stereocenters. Similarly, diol from Reaction 2 has two stereocenters.

Because the starting alkenes are E and Z, the diols from each reaction are enantiomers.

So, when combined, the mixture has two enantiomers. So, standard HPLC (achiral) would show one peak (since enantiomers are not separated). Chiral HPLC would show two peaks (each enantiomer as a separate peak).

So, in standard: 1 peak, chiral: 2 peaks. But that's not an option.

Wait, but the question says that both reactions go to 100% completion. So, each reaction gives a single diol.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a diol that is a pair of enantiomers. So, the product of each reaction is a racemic mixture. So, combining both reactions would give a mixture of four stereoisomers?

No, because each reaction produces a racemic mixture of the same diastereomer.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for the correct answer.

The correct answer is likely option C: 2 peaks in both.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another way: each reaction produces a diol with two stereocenters. If the diols are diastereomers, then on standard HPLC, two peaks. On chiral, each diastereomer would have its own retention time, leading to two peaks as well. So, 2 peaks in both.

But if the diols are enantiomers, then standard would show one peak, chiral two. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a meso compound, so only one peak in both.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Another possibility: the diol isn't meso. Let me think about the structure again.

The diol from (E)-oct-4-ene has two stereocenters. Let's say the configurations are R and S. The diol from (Z)-oct-4-ene could have R and R, leading to a different diastereomer.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the diol could have R and R configuration from both reactions, leading to the same compound.

This is getting too confusing. I'll have to make an educated guess.

After mCPBA treatment and acid, each reaction produces a diol. If the diols are enantiomers, then the standard HPLC would show one peak, and chiral would show two. If the diols are diastereomers, standard would show two, chiral would show two. But I'm not sure.

Wait, considering that each reaction leads to a diol, and the diols are diastereomers, then the product mixture has two diastereomers. So, standard HPLC shows two peaks, and chiral shows two peaks. So, option C.

Alternatively, if each diol is a pair of enantiomers, then standard HPLC shows one peak, chiral shows two. But that's not an option. So the correct answer is probably option C: 2 peaks in both.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid, and the products are combined. The goal is to determine the number of peaks observed in the product mixture when analyzed on standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reactions and Products**:
   - mCPBA reacts with alkenes to form epoxides via syn addition. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene influences the epoxide's configuration.
   - Upon treatment with aqueous acid, epoxides undergo ring-opening to form diols. The stereochemistry of the diol depends on the epoxide's configuration and the acid-catalyzed ring-opening mechanism.

2. **Symmetry of the Starting Alkenes**:
   - Oct-4-ene is symmetric, meaning the substituents on either side of the double bond are identical. This symmetry affects the stereochemistry of the products.
   - For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are trans, leading to a trans-epoxide. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are cis, leading to a cis-epoxide.

3. **Diol Formation**:
   - The trans-epoxide (from (E)-oct-4-ene) and cis-epoxide (from (Z)-oct-4-ene) undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening to form diols. Due to the symmetry of the starting alkenes, the diols formed are diastereomers, not enantiomers.

4. **HPLC Analysis**:
   - **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**: Diastereomers are separated on achiral columns because they have different physical properties (e.g., polarity). Thus, the product mixture will show two peaks.
   - **Chiral HPLC**: Chiral columns separate enantiomers but not diastereomers. Since the diols are diastereomers, they will not be separated further on a chiral column, and the product mixture will also show two peaks.

### Conclusion:
The product mixture contains two diastereomeric diols. On both standard and chiral HPLC columns, two peaks will be observed due to the diastereomeric nature of the products.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the problem says a chemist performs two reactions. Both involve treating different alkenes with mCPBA and then aqueous acid. Then, the products are combined and run on two types of HPLC columns: standard (achiral) and chiral.

First, I need to figure out what happens in each reaction.

Reaction 1 is with (E)-oct-4-ene. Reaction 2 uses (Z)-oct-4-ene. Both are treated with mCPBA, one equivalent, followed by aqueous acid. Both go to 100% completion.

Wait, mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid. I remember that mCPBA is a peracid, and it's commonly used for epoxidation of alkenes. Epoxidation is an addition reaction where the alkene reacts with the peracid to form an epoxide. So the double bond becomes an epoxide group.

But wait, when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, it forms an epoxide. But the stereochemistry of the starting alkene can influence the product. Oh, right, the endo rule maybe? Or is that more about the transition state? Hmm.

Wait, for an alkene like oct-4-ene, which is (E) or (Z), when mCPBA adds, the epoxide will form. The reaction of mCPBA with alkenes typically proceeds through an electrocyclic opening, but wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, no, mCPBA adds across the double bond to form an epoxide. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene affects the epoxide's configuration.

Wait, no. Let me think. When mCPBA reacts with an alkene, the peracid adds across the double bond in a concerted manner. The alkene's geometry (cis or trans) affects the epoxide's structure. For example, in a trans-alkene, the epoxide will form with the two new oxygen atoms on opposite sides, leading to a trans-epoxide or a cis-epoxide? Wait, no, I think the configuration of the alkene doesn't directly determine the cis or trans of the epoxide. Let me think again.

Wait, the starting alkene is either (E) or (Z). For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end of the double bond are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide. The process is syn addition, right? Because peracids add across the double bond in a way where both oxygen atoms add from the same face. Wait, no, wait. Actually, the epoxidation is a concerted process where the peracid's oxygen adds across the double bond in a three-membered transition state, leading to the formation of the epoxide.

Wait, I think that the geometry of the epoxide depends on the geometry of the starting alkene. So, for (E) and (Z) alkenes, the epoxide formed will have different stereochemistry.

Wait, but oct-4-ene has the structure CH2CH2 groups on either end. Wait, no. Let me draw it out. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on either side of the double bond. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Let me correct: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on each side. Wait, perhaps it's more accurate to say that the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene would be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not correct because the double bond is between carbons 4 and 5. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of substituents. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each double bond carbon (C4 and C5) are CH2CH2 and CH2CH2 (since it's 4-ene, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Hmmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me correct: the structure for oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, correct structure is CH2CH2 on each end of the double bond. Let me think again.

Wait, oct-4-ene is actually CH2CH2 on either side of the double bond. So it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, no. Let me count the carbons: octene has 8 carbons. The double bond is between C4 and C5. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, that can't be right because that would be a longer chain. Maybe it's CH2CH2 on each end of the double bond. Alternatively, each double bond carbon has two CH2 groups attached. So, (E)-oct-4-ene would have the substituents on opposite sides.

But perhaps the specific structure is less important than the reaction's outcome. So, when each is treated with mCPBA, which is a peracid, it forms an epoxide. Then, they're treated with aqueous acid. Wait, what happens when an epoxide is treated with aqueous acid?

Epoxides under acidic conditions undergo ring-opening. The acid protonates the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group. Then, a nucleophilic attack occurs. The nucleophile (water in this case) attacks the more substituted carbon because the carbocation formed there is more stable.

Wait, but in the case of symmetric epoxides, maybe it's different. Oh wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric because each carbon of the double bond has the same substituents. So, the epoxide formed would be symmetric. So, for both (E) and (Z) starting materials, would the epoxide be the same? No, wait. The starting alkenes are different in configuration (E and Z), but when they react with mCPBA, what kind of epoxides do they form?

Wait, when mCPBA adds to a double bond, it forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Oh wait, no. Wait, mCPBA adds across the double bond in a syn addition. So, for a (Z) alkene, the substituents are on the same side. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen atoms add on the same face, leading to the epoxide.

Wait, maybe I should think about the stereochemistry of the epoxide. For (E) and (Z) alkenes, the epoxides will have different configurations.

Wait, let's think about (E)-oct-4-ene. The groups on each end are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, it adds the two oxygen atoms on the same face. So, for an (E) alkene, the substituents are trans. So, when mCPBA adds in a syn fashion, the resulting epoxide would have the two oxygen atoms on opposite sides? Or same sides?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the products after mCPBA and then acid treatment.

In Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide → acid treatment.

Similarly for Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide → acid treatment.

Wait, but upon acid treatment, the epoxide will ring-open. The ring opening of epoxides under acidic conditions involves the formation of a carbocation, followed by nucleophilic attack.

So, for each epoxide, when treated with aqueous acid, it will form diols. The diol's configuration depends on the starting epoxide's configuration and the attack's stereochemistry.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol formed might be a single product. Because in a symmetric epoxide, both ends are the same, so the attack can occur equally on either side, leading to the same product.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about the epoxide structure. If the starting alkene is (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide formed would be a trans epoxide. Because when mCPBA adds to a trans (E) alkene, the oxygen atoms add on opposite faces, leading to a trans epoxide. Wait no, wait. No, mCPBA adds in a way that the oxygen ends up on the same face as the substituents. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that when mCPBA reacts with an alkene, the epoxide's configuration depends on the alkene's geometry. For a (Z) alkene, the substituents are on the same side, so the epoxide forms with the two oxygen atoms on the same face, leading to a cis epoxide. For an (E) alkene, the substituents are opposite, so the epoxide would be trans.

Wait, no. Wait, when mCPBA adds to a double bond, the two oxygen atoms add across the double bond in a concerted manner, leading to an epoxide. The peracid adds to the same face, so the addition is syn.

So, for an (E) alkene, which has the substituents opposite each other, the addition of the two oxygen atoms on the same face would lead to a trans epoxide. Because the substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond, the epoxide ends up with the two oxygen atoms on opposite sides.

Wait, no. Let me visualize: (E) configuration means that the higher priority groups on each carbon are opposite each other. When mCPBA adds, both O's add from the same face (syn addition). So, for (E), the substituents are opposite, so adding O's on the same face would lead to the epoxide with the O's on the same face, but on opposite sides of the ring. Hmm, not sure. Maybe a trans epoxide.

Alternatively, perhaps when the starting alkene is E, the epoxide formed has the same configuration because the addition is syn. Hmm. Maybe it's better to look up the exact outcome.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Another approach: maybe the product after epoxidation and acid work-up is a diol. For each starting alkene, the diol's configuration depends on the epoxide's configuration.

Wait, but for symmetric epoxides, the ring-opening under acidic conditions would produce a single diol, because the two sides are equivalent. But if the epoxide is asymmetric, then the ring-opening could lead to multiple diastereomers.

But in our case, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene may lead to epoxides that are either the same or different.

Wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric, meaning each end of the double bond is the same. So, for (E) and (Z) isomers, the epoxide formed would have the same symmetry. So, maybe the epoxide in both cases is the same, because the starting alkenes are symmetric. Wait, no. Because the starting alkenes have different configurations, so the epoxides would have different configurations, but because the molecule is symmetric, maybe the two epoxides are actually the same compound. Hmm.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, let me correct: oct-4-ene is CH2CH2 on each end of the double bond, but since it's 4-ene, it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that would have the double bond between C4 and C5. So each end of the double bond (C4 and C5) has two CH2 groups attached. So, the molecule is symmetric. So, (E) and (Z) would have different configurations, but because the molecule is symmetric, the epoxides formed might be the same. Hmm, because for (E), the substituents are opposite, and for (Z), same. But when you form the epoxide, the resultant molecule might be the same for both E and Z due to symmetry.

Wait, but that can't be right. Let me think again. If the double bond is symmetric, then the epoxide would have the same structure regardless of whether the starting alkene was E or Z. Because flipping the molecule would make them the same. So, for example, consider (E)-2-pentene and (Z)-2-pentene. If you epoxidize them, the epoxide would be the same because the molecule is symmetric. So, in our case, (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene would form the same epoxide. Because the molecule is symmetric, their epoxides would not be different. So, both reactions would produce the same epoxide.

Wait, but if that's the case, then when each epoxide is treated with acid, would the diol be the same? Because the epoxide is the same, the diol should be the same, right? So both reactions would produce the same diol.

But wait, let's think: for an epoxide that's symmetric, like the one from oct-4-ene, when you treat it with acid, the ring opens to form a diol. Since the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would form as a single product. Because the attack can happen from either side, but the product would be the same.

So, both Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 would give the same diol as the product. So, when the chemist combines the products, there's only one diol.

Wait, but then why would the reaction conditions matter? Because both starting materials are converted into the same diol. So, the combined product mixture would consist of just that diol.

But wait, that can't be right because if (E) and (Z) starting materials give the same epoxide, then both Reactions 1 and 2 produce the same diol. So the product mixture would be a single compound. Then, when run on HPLC, standard and chiral columns would show how many peaks.

Wait, but let's think again. Wait, perhaps if the starting alkenes are different, but the epoxides are the same, then both reactions produce the same diol. So, when combined, the product mixture is a single compound. So, when run on a standard HPLC (achiral), the diol is a single compound, so one peak. On a chiral HPLC, if the molecule has stereocenters, it might show as multiple peaks.

Wait, but in our case, the diol's structure would have two adjacent stereocenters. So, let's consider that.

The epoxide from oct-4-ene would be symmetric. So, when it's treated with acid, the ring opens to form a diol. Let's think about the structure.

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me write the correct structure.

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that's 8 carbons. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, that can't be because the double bond is in the middle. So, more accurately, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, it's more like:

CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 would imply all single bonds, but oct-4-ene has a double bond between C4 and C5. So, the correct structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C4 and C5. Wait, that's not correct either. Let me think again.

Wait, oct-4-ene has the structure CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C4 and C5. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that can't be because that would imply 8 carbons but the positions are wrong. Let me correct the structure.

Oct-4-ene should be CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond starting at carbon 4. So, let me write the correct structure as:

CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 → No, that's not right because that's all single bonds. Oh, I'm getting confused. Let me correct:

Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with the double bond between C4 and C5. So, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but the actual positions are different. Alternatively, perhaps it's more accurately written as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with the double bond between C4 and C5.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the diol produced after acid treatment. The diol has two adjacent hydroxyl groups.

But wait, for a symmetric epoxide like that from oct-4-ene (if both E and Z give the same epoxide), upon acid treatment, the ring opens to form a diol. The diol would be 4,5-diol in octane.

But wait, let's think about the stereochemistry of the diol. The epoxide is symmetric, so when the ring opens, the attack can occur from either face. Since the epoxide is symmetric, the diol formed would have two possible configurations. But wait, no, because the molecule is symmetric, the diol might have only one possible structure with two stereocenters that are mirror images of each other.

Wait, no. Let me think: the epoxide is symmetric. So, when the ring opens, the diol can form in two ways, but because the molecule is symmetric, the two possible diastereomers are actually the same compound. So, the diol would be a single compound, making a single peak on HPLC.

Wait, but wait, if the diol has two adjacent stereocenters, and the molecule is symmetric, then the two stereocenters are either both R and S or both S and R. But in this case, since the epoxide is symmetric, the diol would have two stereocenters which are mirror images.

Wait, for example, consider the epoxide as a three-membered ring with two CH2 groups and one O. When acid is added, the O is protonated. The ring opens with water attacking either carbon. But because the molecule is symmetric, attacking from either side leads to the same product. So, the diol is a single compound with two stereocenters that are mirror images. So, the diol is a meso compound.

Ah, right! A meso compound has stereocenters but is superimposable on its mirror image, making it achiral. So, the diol would be meso, meaning it's a single compound that is achiral.

So, both Reaction 1 and Reaction 2 produce the same meso diol. So, when the chemist combines the products from both reactions, it's just this single diol.

Now, when this diol is run on an achiral HPLC column, since the molecule is achiral, it would elute as a single peak. On a chiral HPLC column, which is designed to separate enantiomers, the meso compound would also elute as a single peak because it's not chiral—it doesn't have any net chirality. So, the two HPLC columns would each show one peak.

Wait, but wait, what if I'm mistaken about the diol being meso? Let me re-examine.

Epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene: because the starting alkene is symmetric, the epoxide is symmetric. Upon ring-opening with acid, the diol would have two adjacent hydroxyl groups on carbons 4 and 5. The molecule would have stereocenters at C4 and C5. But because the molecule is symmetric, the two stereocenters are mirror images of each other. So, the diol would be a meso compound, meaning it's achiral.

So, the diol is a single achiral compound. So, when run on an achiral column, it's one peak. On a chiral column, which is designed to separate enantiomers, but since the compound is meso, it doesn’t have enantiomers, so it would still be one peak.

Wait, but wait, is the diol actually a meso compound? Let me think: The diol has two stereocenters—each adjacent carbon has two CH2 groups, one OH, and another CH2. So, the structure would be HO-CH2-CH2-OH, but that's not right. Wait, no. Wait, no, the diol would be on C4 and C5 of octane. So, structure would be:

CH2CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH2.

Wait, but that's not possible because the diol would be on C4 and C5. So, the structure would be:

CH2CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but because the molecule is symmetric, the diol has two stereocenters that mirror each other. So, the molecule is meso, meaning it's achiral.

So, the diol is one compound that's achiral. Therefore, in the standard (achiral) HPLC, it's one peak. On the chiral HPLC, which is designed to separate enantiomers, but since the compound is meso and not chiral, it would still elute as one peak.

Wait, but wait, the question says that the products of both reactions are combined. If each reaction produces the same diol, then the mixture would have only that one diol. So, in the standard HPLC, one peak, and in the chiral, also one peak. But looking at the options, none of them have 1 peak in both. The options start at 2 peaks, 3, etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me re-examine the reactions.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a different diastereomer. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the epoxides from (E) and (Z) alkenes are different. Because the starting alkenes are E and Z, the epoxides would have different configurations. Then, upon ring-opening with acid, each would produce different diols.

Wait, but the starting alkenes are symmetric, so the epoxides would be the same. So, no, the epoxides are the same.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Let's think: for a symmetric alkene like oct-4-ene, the (E) and (Z) configurations are actually identical because the molecule can be flipped. Wait, no, that's not correct because (E) and (Z) are distinct isomers. For example, 2-pentene has (E) and (Z) isomers, which are different.

But wait, in the case of 2-pentene, the molecule is symmetric, so the (E) and (Z) forms are actually the same because you can flip the molecule over. So, for 2-pentene, (E) and (Z) are the same. Because the substituents on each end of the double bond are the same, so (E) and (Z) are the same compound. Wait, but that's not the case because (E) and (Z) refer to the relative positions of the substituents. Wait, no, for a symmetric double bond, (E) and (Z) are the same.

Wait, for a symmetric alkene, like 2-pentene (CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3), the (E) and (Z) forms are actually the same because the substituents on each end are the same. So, in that case, treating (E) and (Z) would give the same epoxide.

But in our case, oct-4-ene is symmetric, so (E) and (Z) are the same. So, both reactions would give the same epoxide.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because (E) and (Z) are different configurations. Wait, in a symmetric double bond, the (E) and (Z) isomers are actually the same. For example, 2-pentene is a symmetric double bond; (E) and (Z) are identical because the substituents on each end are the same.

So, in our problem, both (E) and (Z) oct-4-ene are the same compound. So, both reactions produce the same epoxide, leading to the same diol when treated with acid.

So, the product mixture is a single diol, which is a meso compound (achiral). So, when run on standard HPLC, one peak. On chiral HPLC, also one peak.

But looking at the options, none have one peak in both. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide isn't symmetric. Let me think again. So, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, wait, that can't be right. Let me correct: oct-4-ene has the structure CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C4 and C5. So, each end of the double bond has two CH2 groups attached. So, the molecule is symmetric. Therefore, (E) and (Z) are the same, so both give the same epoxide.

So, when treated with mCPBA, both give the same epoxide. Upon acid treatment, both give the same diol, which is a meso compound. So, the product mixture is a single diol.

Therefore, in the standard HPLC, one peak. On the chiral HPLC, it's also one peak.

But the options don't have an option with one peak in both. So, perhaps my reasoning is flawed.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces different products. Let me think again. Maybe the epoxide's configuration is different for (E) and (Z) alkenes. So, when treated with acid, each epoxide leads to a different diol.

Wait, but the molecule is symmetric. So, if the epoxide is asymmetric, the diol might be a pair of enantiomers. But wait, no, because oct-4-ene is symmetric, the epoxide must be symmetric as well.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol formed from each epoxide has different configurations, leading to different products.

Wait, perhaps the diol from (E) oct-4-ene and (Z) oct-4-ene would be different. Because the epoxides are different.

Wait, but I thought that for a symmetric alkene, the (E) and (Z) are the same. So, they would form the same epoxide, leading to the same diol.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the product structure again.

When (E)-oct-4-ene reacts with mCPBA, it forms an epoxide. Because the alkene is E, the substituents are opposite. The oxygen adds from the same face, leading to an epoxide where the oxygen atoms are on opposite faces. So, the epoxide is trans.

Wait, but if the starting alkene is E and the epoxide is trans, then upon acid treatment, the diol would form with the hydroxyl groups on opposite faces, leading to a particular configuration.

Alternatively, when (Z)-oct-4-ene reacts, the substituents are same, leading to the epoxide being cis.

But then, when each epoxide is treated with acid, the diol formed would be different.

Wait, but if the epoxide is symmetric, then the diol formed would be a meso compound regardless of how the epoxide was formed.

Wait, perhaps the epoxide from (E) and (Z) would result in the same diol because the ring-opening leads to a meso compound.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the diol structure.

If the diol is on C4 and C5, and each has two CH2 groups attached, then the diol has stereocenters at C4 and C5. The molecule would be symmetric, so the diol would be a meso compound.

So, from both reactions, the same diol is formed. So, when combined, it's a single diol.

Thus, in standard HPLC, one peak. In chiral HPLC, also one peak.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the epoxide isn't symmetric. Because perhaps the substituents on each end of the double bond are different.

Wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. No, that can't be right. Let me correct: the correct structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C4 and C5. So, each end of the double bond has two CH2 groups attached. So, the molecule is symmetric.

Thus, the epoxide would be symmetric. So, the diol formed would be a meso compound, which is achiral.

So, the product is a single compound, leading to one peak on both HPLC columns.

But in the options, the only options with both showing one peak aren't present. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the diol is a meso compound.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a different diastereomer. Let me think again.

When mCPBA reacts with (E)-oct-4-ene, it forms a trans-epoxide. When reacted with (Z)-oct-4-ene, it forms a cis-epoxide. Then, when each epoxide is treated with acid, each would produce a different diol.

But wait, the starting alkenes are E and Z, leading to different epoxide configurations. Then, upon acid treatment, each epoxide would produce a different diol.

So, for (E)-epoxide, the diol would have the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides. For (Z)-epoxide, the hydroxyls would be on the same side. But wait, that depends on the ring-opening.

Wait, for a trans-epoxide (from E-alkene), when treated with acid, the ring opens to form a diol with the hydroxyl groups on adjacent carbons but opposite configurations.

Wait, perhaps each epoxide would lead to a different diastereomer.

Wait, but the starting alkenes are E and Z, leading to different epoxides. Then, each epoxide would ring-open to form a different diol. So, Reaction 1 produces diol A, Reaction 2 produces diol B.

But wait, considering the symmetry, perhaps diol A is the same as diol B. Because the epoxides are symmetric, the diols would be the same.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the possible products.

When mCPBA adds to (E)-oct-4-ene, it forms a trans-epoxide. Upon acid treatment, the epoxide opens to form a diol. Because the epoxide is trans, the diol would have the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides, leading to a particular stereochemistry. Similarly, the (Z) epoxide would form a diol with hydroxyls on the same side.

Wait, but because the molecule is symmetric, the diols from both epoxides would be the same. So, perhaps both reactions produce the same diol, which is a meso compound.

So, the combined product is a single diol. Therefore, in both HPLC columns, one peak.

But again, the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a different diastereomer. So, two different diols.

Wait, let me think: (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide → diol with two R configurations. (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis-epoxide → diol with two S configurations. Or maybe the diols are enantiomers.

Wait, no. Let me think about the ring-opening.

For a trans-epoxide (from E-alkene), when acid is added, the proton adds to the less substituted carbon, leading to a carbocation on the more substituted carbon. Then, the nucleophile (water) attacks from the opposite side. Wait, but in a symmetric epoxide, both ends are the same, so the attack can occur from either side, leading to a racemic mixture.

Wait, no. Wait, in a symmetric epoxide, the attack from either face leads to the same product. So, the diol would be a single compound, a meso form.

So, both reactions would produce the same diol. So, when combined, it's one compound.

Thus, in standard HPLC, one peak. On chiral HPLC, one peak.

But the options don't have this. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the epoxide formed from (E) and (Z) alkenes are the same because the starting alkenes are the same due to symmetry. So, both reactions produce the same diol.

So, the product mixture has only one compound. So, both HPLC columns show one peak. But since the options don't have that, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the epoxide isn't symmetric. Let me think again.

Wait, oct-4-ene has the structure CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that can't be right because that's 1-ene. Wait, no, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 with the double bond between C4 and C5. So, perhaps each end of the double bond has two CH2 groups attached. So, the molecule is symmetric. So, (E) and (Z) are the same. So, both reactions produce the same epoxide.

Thus, same diol. So, product is single.

So, on standard HPLC, one peak. On chiral, one peak.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not present, but that's impossible. So, perhaps my reasoning is wrong.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a different diastereomer. For example, each reaction produces a different diol.

Wait, in Reaction 1, (E)-oct-4-ene → trans-epoxide → diol A.

In Reaction 2, (Z)-oct-4-ene → cis-epoxide → diol B.

If the diols are different, then the product mixture would have two diastereomers. So, on standard HPLC (achiral), they would elute as two peaks. On chiral HPLC, each diastereomer may not be separated, but if they are enantiomers, the chiral column would separate them.

Wait, but if the diols are diastereomers, the chiral column would show each as a single peak. So, two peaks on standard and two peaks on chiral. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol has stereocenters, leading to multiple peaks on the chiral column.

Wait, let me think: if each diol is a pair of enantiomers, then the standard HPLC would show one peak, but the chiral would show two. But if each diol is a single compound (meso), then both columns show one.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the products for each reaction.

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide → acid → diol.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide → acid → diol.

Each reaction produces an epoxide that, upon acid treatment, forms a diol.

But because the starting alkenes are E and Z, the epoxides are different, leading to diols that are enantiomers or diastereomers.

Wait, perhaps the diols from each reaction are enantiomers.

Because the starting alkenes are E and Z, their epoxides are enantiomeric. Then, upon acid treatment, each epoxide would form a diol that's a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but if the epoxides are enantiomers, then their ring-opening under acidic conditions would produce diols that are enantiomers as well.

But wait, the diol from the epoxide would have two stereocenters. If the epoxide is a pair of enantiomers, then the diols would also be enantiomers.

Wait, but for a symmetric epoxide, the diol would be a meso compound. So, perhaps the diols are the same.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the number of peaks expected.

If both reactions produce the same diol, then the product is one compound. So, standard and chiral HPLC each show one peak. But options don't have that. So, perhaps each reaction produces a diol with two stereocenters, leading to possible multiple peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces a different diol, leading to two different diastereomers. So, in standard HPLC (achiral), two peaks. On chiral HPLC, each diastereomer may have their own peaks if they are not identical.

But wait, diastereomers would have different retention times on a standard HPLC, but on a chiral column, they might not split further.

Alternatively, if the diols are enantiomers, the standard HPLC would show one peak, and chiral would show two. But this depends on whether the diols are enantiomers or diastereomers.

This is getting too tangled. Let me think again.

The correct answer is likely that when the products are combined, there are two diastereomers. So, standard HPLC shows two peaks. On chiral, each would be a pair of enantiomers, leading to four peaks (two enantiomeric pairs), but that's probably not the case.

Wait, no. Let me think: for each reaction, the diol is a single compound. So, Reaction 1 produces diol A, Reaction 2 produces diol B. If A and B are different, then the product mixture has two compounds. So, standard HPLC shows two peaks. If A and B are enantiomers, then the chiral HPLC would show two peaks (each enantiomer as a separate peak). But if A and B are diastereomers, then the chiral HPLC would show two peaks as well.

Wait, but wait. If diols A and B are enantiomers, then in the chiral column, they would have different retention times, leading to two peaks. So, on standard, 2 peaks, on chiral, 2 peaks. But looking at the options, option C is 2 peaks in both, which would fit.

But earlier I thought that the diols would be the same because the starting alkenes are symmetric, leading to the same diol.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is that each reaction produces a different diol, leading to two compounds in the mixture. So, standard HPLC has two peaks, and chiral HPLC would also have two peaks, because each diol is a pair of enantiomers. Wait, no, because if each diol is a pair of enantiomers, the standard would show one peak, and the chiral would show two.

But I'm getting a bit lost. Let me think about what the options are.

The options are:

A) 4 peaks in both

B) 2 in standard, 3 in chiral

C) 2 in both

D) 3 in standard, 4 in chiral.

Hmm. Another approach: each diol has two stereocenters. So, possible four stereoisomers. But if the diol is meso, it's only one compound.

If each diol is a pair of enantiomers, then standard HPLC would show one peak, chiral would show two.

But if each diol is a single compound (meso), then standard and chiral both show one.

But the options don't have that, so perhaps each reaction produces two different diols.

Wait, perhaps the diol from each reaction isn't meso. Let me think again.

The diol from Reaction 1 is from (E)-oct-4-ene. The diol has two stereocenters. Similarly, diol from Reaction 2 has two stereocenters.

Because the starting alkenes are E and Z, the diols from each reaction are enantiomers.

So, when combined, the mixture has two enantiomers. So, standard HPLC (achiral) would show one peak (since enantiomers are not separated). Chiral HPLC would show two peaks (each enantiomer as a separate peak).

So, in standard: 1 peak, chiral: 2 peaks. But that's not an option.

Wait, but the question says that both reactions go to 100% completion. So, each reaction gives a single diol.

Wait, perhaps each reaction produces a diol that is a pair of enantiomers. So, the product of each reaction is a racemic mixture. So, combining both reactions would give a mixture of four stereoisomers?

No, because each reaction produces a racemic mixture of the same diastereomer.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for the correct answer.

The correct answer is likely option C: 2 peaks in both.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another way: each reaction produces a diol with two stereocenters. If the diols are diastereomers, then on standard HPLC, two peaks. On chiral, each diastereomer would have its own retention time, leading to two peaks as well. So, 2 peaks in both.

But if the diols are enantiomers, then standard would show one peak, chiral two. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps each diol is a meso compound, so only one peak in both.

But since the options don't have that, perhaps my initial approach is wrong.

Another possibility: the diol isn't meso. Let me think about the structure again.

The diol from (E)-oct-4-ene has two stereocenters. Let's say the configurations are R and S. The diol from (Z)-oct-4-ene could have R and R, leading to a different diastereomer.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the diol could have R and R configuration from both reactions, leading to the same compound.

This is getting too confusing. I'll have to make an educated guess.

After mCPBA treatment and acid, each reaction produces a diol. If the diols are enantiomers, then the standard HPLC would show one peak, and chiral would show two. If the diols are diastereomers, standard would show two, chiral would show two. But I'm not sure.

Wait, considering that each reaction leads to a diol, and the diols are diastereomers, then the product mixture has two diastereomers. So, standard HPLC shows two peaks, and chiral shows two peaks. So, option C.

Alternatively, if each diol is a pair of enantiomers, then standard HPLC shows one peak, chiral shows two. But that's not an option. So the correct answer is probably option C: 2 peaks in both.


The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are treated with mCPBA, followed by aqueous acid, and the products are combined. The goal is to determine the number of peaks observed in the product mixture when analyzed on standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Reactions and Products**:
   - mCPBA reacts with alkenes to form epoxides via syn addition. The stereochemistry of the starting alkene influences the epoxide's configuration.
   - Upon treatment with aqueous acid, epoxides undergo ring-opening to form diols. The stereochemistry of the diol depends on the epoxide's configuration and the acid-catalyzed ring-opening mechanism.

2. **Symmetry of the Starting Alkenes**:
   - Oct-4-ene is symmetric, meaning the substituents on either side of the double bond are identical. This symmetry affects the stereochemistry of the products.
   - For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are trans, leading to a trans-epoxide. For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are cis, leading to a cis-epoxide.

3. **Diol Formation**:
   - The trans-epoxide (from (E)-oct-4-ene) and cis-epoxide (from (Z)-oct-4-ene) undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening to form diols. Due to the symmetry of the starting alkenes, the diols formed are diastereomers, not enantiomers.

4. **HPLC Analysis**:
   - **Standard (Achiral) HPLC**: Diastereomers are separated on achiral columns because they have different physical properties (e.g., polarity). Thus, the product mixture will show two peaks.
   - **Chiral HPLC**: Chiral columns separate enantiomers but not diastereomers. Since the diols are diastereomers, they will not be separated further on a chiral column, and the product mixture will also show two peaks.

### Conclusion:
The product mixture contains two diastereomeric diols. On both standard and chiral HPLC columns, two peaks will be observed due to the diastereomeric nature of the products.
