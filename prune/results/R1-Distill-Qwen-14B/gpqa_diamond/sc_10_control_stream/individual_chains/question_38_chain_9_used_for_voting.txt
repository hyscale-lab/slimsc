Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about enamine reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through it step by step.

The question is about a reaction sequence leading to product B. The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. I remember that enamine reactions usually involve the formation of an imine intermediate, which can then undergo various reactions.

Wait, so the starting compound is an enamine. Enamines are typically formed from a secondary amine and a carbonyl compound. The general structure is R2N-CHR'. In this case, the structure given seems to be an enamine because of the "ylidene" part, which indicates a double bond.

Looking at the starting material: (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. The "ylidene" group is a substituent on the nitrogen, so the structure is something like (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH=N with some substituents.

The reaction has three steps, each involving reagents A. The options give different sequences of reagents. Let me look at the options to get a better idea.

Option A: Steps are LDA, DME; then CH3CH2I; then H3O+. Product is pentan-2-one and dimethylethylamine.

Option B: Steps are LDA, then DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. Same product as A.

Option C: Steps are LDA, DME; then CH3CH2I; then H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Option D: Steps are LDA, then DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Wait, but the starting material is an enamine. So what do enamine reactions typically do? They can be used in the formation of rings or in the Michael addition, but another key use is as a nucleophile in substitution reactions. Enamines can also undergo hydrolysis to form ketones or aldehydes, depending on the structure.

So, the starting material is an enamine. Let's think about the reagents. LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) is a strong base, typically used to deprotonate compounds, especially in enolate formation. DME is 1,2-dimethoxyethane, a solvent. Then, CH3CH2I is ethyl iodide, an alkylating agent. H3O+ is probably for acid workup.

So, the reaction sequence would be: deprotonation with LDA, then alkylation, then acid workup.

Wait, but LDA is a base. How does it interact with the enamine? Maybe it deprotonates the enamine to form an enamine anion. Then, perhaps the ethyl iodide would act as an alkylating agent, providing an ethyl group.

But wait, in enamine reactions, the enamine can attack an electrophile. But after deprotonation, maybe the enamine becomes a stronger nucleophile.

So, step 1: LDA deprotonates the enamine. The enamine has a proton alpha to the nitrogen. Deprotonating would generate a strong nucleophile.

Step 2: Alkylation with ethyl iodide. The enamine anion would attack the ethyl iodide, perhaps leading to an alkylation at the alpha position.

Step 3: Acid workup. Once the alkylation is done, acid is added to hydrolyze the enamine back to a ketone and an amine.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. The starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3 connected to N which is also connected to a CH2CH3 (from ethanaminium) and a methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine structure is R2C=NH, but in this case, it's more like R2N=CH-... Hmm.

Wait, the starting material is an enamine, so it's formed from a secondary amine and a carbonyl. Let's say the secondary amine is N-methylpentan-2-amine (but not sure). The carbonyl would be ethanamine maybe? I'm getting a bit confused, perhaps I should draw it out.

Alternatively, maybe the enamine is acting as a nucleophile. So, when LDA is added, it deprotonates the alpha hydrogen (the hydrogen next to the N in the enamine), making a strong base.

Then, ethyl iodide would alkylate that position. So, the enamine's carbon adjacent to N would get an ethyl group.

Wait, but enamine alkylation typically occurs at the alpha position. So after alkylation, when we hydrolyze, the structure would change.

Let me think about the hydrolysis. Enamines, when treated with acid, hydrolyze to form a ketone (if the starting material was a ketone) or an aldehyde (if from an aldehyde) and the amine.

But in this case, the starting enamine is derived from a ketone and an amine. So hydrolysis would break the enamine and release the ketone and the amine.

Wait, but in this reaction, after alkylation, the structure would be modified. So if the enamine is R2N-CH2-R', and then alkylated at the alpha position, perhaps adding another R'' group, then after hydrolysis, the ketone would have an extra R'' group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation occurs on the alpha carbon, and upon hydrolysis, that would result in a larger ketone.

Wait, let me think about what the starting enamine looks like. The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium.

So, the structure is:

The enamine is formed from pentan-2-ol and an amine. Wait, no. Wait, enamine formation involves an amine and a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the enamine is formed from a secondary amine, like dimethylamine, and a carbonyl compound. Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is formed from pentan-2-one and N-methylethanamine (which is N,N-dimethylethanamine).

Wait, the enamine structure would be:

R2N-C=CH2, but perhaps more accurately, (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH=N-N(CH3)CH2CH3, but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an enamine derived from pentan-2-one (which is (CH2)2CO) and N,N-dimethylethanamine (which is (CH3)2NCH2CH3).

Wait, no, N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium is the starting material. So ethanaminium means that the amine is ethyl, with two methyl groups attached to the N. So, the structure is N,N-dimethyl-ethylamine, but connected via an imine linkage to a pentylidene group.

Wait, more accurately, the structure is:

The enamine is (E)-configuration. So, the structure is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH=N-N(CH2CH3)(CH3)?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Maybe I should focus on the reaction steps.

The reagents are in option C and D as LDA followed by DME, CH3CH2I, then H3O+.

Wait, no, let's look at the options again.

Option C: Steps are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Option D: Steps are (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about what each step does.

The starting material is an enamine (R2N-CH2-CH2-... but perhaps with a double bond). LDA is added, which is a strong base. It would deprotonate the alpha hydrogen, making the alpha carbon more nucleophilic.

Then, ethyl iodide would alkylate that position. So, the enamine would gain an ethyl group at the alpha position.

After that, acid is added (H3O+), which would protonate and hydrolyze the enamine. Hydrolysis of enamine typically gives a ketone and an amine.

So, if the enamine after alkylation has an additional ethyl group, the ketone formed after hydrolysis would have that ethyl group.

But wait, what's the original enamine's structure? Let me imagine it.

The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the enamine is (E)-CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3-C(=N-CH(CH3)CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, perhaps the enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. So, the general structure of an enamine is R2NC=CR2.

Wait, pentan-2-one is (CH2)2CO. The enamine would be formed by reacting a secondary amine with the carbonyl of pentan-2-one. So, the enamine would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH=N-R, where R is from the amine.

In this case, the amine is N,N-dimethylethanamine, which is (CH3)2NCH2CH3. So, the enamine would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH=N-CH(CH2CH3)(CH3).

Wait, that's probably incorrect. Let me try to imagine the structure better. The enamine is formed from a secondary amine and a ketone. The general structure is R2NC=CH-R', where R and R' come from the amine and the ketone.

Wait, no, more accurately, the enamine is R-C(=N-R'')-CH2R''', where R'' and R''' are from the amine. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Ok, perhaps let's not get too stuck on the exact structure. Instead, think about the reaction steps.

Step 1: LDA (a strong base) is added. LDA will deprotonate the alpha hydrogen (the H attached to the carbon adjacent to N in the enamine). This would generate an enamine anion, which is a strong nucleophile.

Step 2: CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide) is an alkylating agent. The enamine anion would attack the ethyl iodide, resulting in alkylation at the alpha position. So, the alpha carbon (next to N) would gain an ethyl group.

Step 3: H3O+ (acid workup) would protonate and hydrolyze the enamine. Hydrolysis of an enamine typically gives a ketone and the amine. So, the product would be a ketone where the alpha carbon has the new ethyl group.

Wait, but the starting enamine was from pentan-2-one and an amine. After alkylation, when it hydrolyzes, the ketone would have an additional ethyl group.

So, the original ketone was pentan-2-one (CH3CH2COCH2CH2CH3?), wait no. Wait, pentan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, that is, CH3CH2COCH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pentan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, so the structure is CH2CH2CO. Wait no, pentan-2-one is (CH2CH2)CO. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of carbon numbering.

Pentan-2-one is: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, five carbons in total, with the ketone in position 2.

When this reacts with a secondary amine, like N,N-dimethylethanamine, it forms an enamine. So the enamine would have the structure (CH3)2N-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait. The enamine is formed by replacing the O with NR2, and adding a CH2 group. Wait, perhaps it's (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH=N-(CH(CH2CH3)(CH3)).

Not sure, but perhaps the key is that after alkylation at the alpha position, hydrolysis will give a larger ketone.

Wait, the original starting ketone is pentan-2-one. After adding an ethyl group via alkylation, the ketone would have an extra ethyl group somewhere.

Wait, the starting enamine was formed from pentan-2-one and an amine. When you alkylate the alpha position, upon hydrolysis, you'll get a ketone with an additional ethyl group.

So, the original ketone is pentan-2-one (which is 3-pentanone?), no, wait pentan-2-one is (CH2)2CO. So, the product after alkylation and hydrolysis would have an additional ethyl group, making it a 5-carbon ketone? Or perhaps a 6-carbon?

Wait, perhaps the initial enamine has a 5-carbon chain (from pentanone), and after adding ethyl, the ketone becomes 6-carbon? Hmm.

Wait, the starting enamine is N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the pentan-2-ylidene is a substituent on the nitrogen. So, the enamine is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH=N-R, where R is from the ethanaminium part. So, R is (CH3)2NCH2CH3.

So, the structure is probably:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH=N-N(CH2CH3)(CH3)

Now, when LDA is added, it deprotonates the alpha hydrogen (the H on the CH2 next to N). Then, ethyl iodide would add an ethyl group to that carbon. So, after alkylation, that carbon would have an ethyl group attached.

Then, upon hydrolysis, the enamine would break down into a ketone and an amine. The ketone would have the ethyl group added, so the position of the carbonyl would shift accordingly.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH=N-R. After alkylation, it becomes (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH(CH2CH3)=N-R. Then, upon hydrolysis, the N-R part would break off, and the carbonyl would form at the adjacent carbon.

Wait, no, the enamine structure is R2C=CR'-N-R''. So, when alkylation occurs at the alpha position (the CR'), and upon hydrolysis, the carbonyl would form.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is:

R-C(=N-R')-CH2-R''

So, after alkylation, the CH2-R'' becomes CH2-R''-CH2CH3 (if ethyl is added). Then, hydrolysis would form R-CO-R''-CH2CH3, which would be a ketone.

But I'm getting a bit tangled up here. Maybe I should think about the product options.

Options are either pentan-2-one plus amine, or heptan-4-one.

Hmm, the product B is either pentan-2-one plus N,N-dimethylethanamine, or heptan-4-one.

So, if the starting enamine comes from pentan-2-one and the amine, then after alkylation and hydrolysis, perhaps the product is a larger ketone.

Wait, hydrolysis of an enamine generally gives back the ketone and the amine. So, if the enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and dimethylethylamine, then hydrolysis would yield pentan-2-one and the amine. But in this case, we've added an ethyl group via alkylation.

Ah, so perhaps the alkylation adds an ethyl group to the alpha position, making the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl have an ethyl branch. So, when the enamine hydrolyzes, the ketone would have that ethyl group.

Wait, so the starting ketone is pentan-2-one (three carbons, ketone in the middle). After adding an ethyl group to the alpha position (the carbon adjacent to the ketone), the ketone would shift its position.

Wait, perhaps the structure after alkylation and hydrolysis would be:

The original enamine came from pentan-2-one (which has the structure CH3CH2COCH2CH3?), but wait, no, pentan-2-one is CH2CH2CO, so five carbons: CH3-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me clarify. Pentan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, which is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's five carbons total. Wait, no. Wait, pentan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is 3-pentanone? No, wait, the correct structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the carbonyl is in position 2 of pentane.

So, structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH3, but more accurately:

CH3-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that would be 3-pentanone. Wait, no, wait. Pentan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, which would be CH2CH2-CO, but that's only three carbons. Wait, maybe I'm confusing butanone and pentanone.

Wait, butanone can be 2-butanone (which is (CH3)2CO), and pentan-2-one would be CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH3. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH3.

Wait, that's correct. So, pentan-2-one is CH2CH2COCH2CH3, which is (CH2)2COCH2CH3.

Wait, but when the enamine is formed from pentan-2-one and an amine, the structure becomes R2C=CR', where R comes from the ketone and R' from the amine.

Hmm, perhaps the enamine is (CH2CH2COCH2CH3)CH=N-R, where R is the amine substituent.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the product. After alkylation and hydrolysis, what ketone would form?

If the starting ketone is pentan-2-one, and we add an ethyl group to the alpha position (the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl), then upon hydrolysis, the carbonyl would form at the same position but with an ethyl branch.

Wait, but wait, when you add an ethyl group to the alpha position, the hydrolysis would result in a ketone where the adjacent carbon has an ethyl group.

So, the original is pentan-2-one: CH3CH2COCH2CH3. If we add an ethyl group to the alpha position (the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl), the structure becomes CH2CH2-CO-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3.

Wait, but that's not right because the starting enamine's structure would determine where the ethyl is added.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH=N-R. So, after alkylation, that CH becomes CH(CH2CH3). Then, upon hydrolysis, the carbonyl would be at that position, forming a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product would be heptan-4-one. Because the starting enamine has a 5-carbon chain (pentan), and adding two carbons (ethyl) would make seven carbons in total when you hydrolyze.

Wait, let me count. The starting enamine is pentan-2-ylidene, which is five carbons. Adding an ethyl group would make it seven carbons. But how?

Wait, perhaps the enamine is derived from pentan-2-one, so the ketone is at position 2. Then, adding an ethyl group at the alpha position (position 1 or 3?) would shift the ketone position.

Hmm, perhaps the product is heptan-4-one. Let's see:

Heptan-4-one is CH2CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3.

So, seven carbons with the ketone in the middle.

Wait, but if the starting enamine is pentan-2-one-derived, adding two carbons (ethyl) would make the ketone at position 4 of a seven-carbon chain.

Wait, the enamine has five carbons (from pentan-2-one). Adding an ethyl group would add two more carbons. So, the resulting ketone would have five plus two equals seven? Or perhaps the position shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is heptan-4-one because after hydrolysis, the ketone is formed at the position where the alkylation occurred.

So, looking back at the options, option C and D have B as heptan-4-one.

Option C's reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

Option D's reagents are (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+.

Wait, I think the correct order is LDA, then DME and ethyl iodide, then H3O+.

Wait, but LDA is a strong base, usually used in THF or DME as solvent. So, first step is LDA in DME, deprotonate the enamine.

Then, ethyl iodide is added as the electrophile; the enamine anion attacks it, adding an ethyl group.

Then, acid workup (H3O+) hydrolyzes the enamine to form the ketone and the amine.

So, in the reagent steps, it's:

(i) LDA in DME

(ii) CH3CH2I

(iii) H3O+

Which matches option C's reagents.

But wait, looking at the options, option C says the product is heptan-4-one, and the reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

So, the product would be heptan-4-one.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is pentan-2-one plus amine, but that's option A and B.

Wait, but the starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and an amine. If we alkylate the alpha position, hydrolysis would form a new ketone.

Wait, perhaps the initial enamine is from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. After alkylation and hydrolysis, the ketone would be pentan-2-one, but wait, no. Because the alkylation adds a group, which upon hydrolysis would become a substituent on the ketone.

Wait, the starting enamine is from a ketone and an amine. Let's say the enamine is R2C=CR'-N-R''. When you alkylate the alpha position (R'), it becomes R2C=CR''-CH2-R''' (where R''' is ethyl). Then, hydrolysis would form R2C(O)R''-CH2-R'''?

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the product is the same as the starting ketone but with an extra ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction adds an ethyl group to the alpha position, so the ketone after hydrolysis would have (original carbonyl) plus ethyl substituent.

In that case, the original ketone is pentan-2-one (CH3CH2COCH2CH3), and adding an ethyl group at the alpha position (the CH2 groups next to CO) would give (CH2CH2COCH2CH(CH2CH3)).

Wait, but that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is (CH2)3CH2CH2CH3? No, I think I'm mixing up.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial enamine is a five-carbon structure. When we add ethyl, it becomes seven carbons, making heptan-4-one.

So, putting it all together, the reagents are LDA (deprotonate), ethyl iodide (alkylation), H3O+ (hydrolysis), leading to heptan-4-one as product B.

Which matches option C or D.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C: Steps are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Option D: Steps are (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Wait, the correct order would be LDA (in DME) first, then ethyl iodide, then H3O+. So, Option C's steps are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

Yes, that makes sense because LDA is typically used with a solvent like DME or THF. So, step (i) is LDA in DME, then step (ii) adds ethyl iodide, then step (iii) adds H3O+.

So, the product would be heptan-4-one.

Looking back at the options, option C and D have B as heptan-4-one. But the reagent sequences differ.

Option C's reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

Option D's reagents are (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+.

So, which sequence is correct?

In an actual reaction, you would first add the base (LDA) in the solvent (DME), then the electrophile (ethyl iodide), followed by acid workup.

Hence, the correct sequence is (i) LDA in DME, (ii) ethyl iodide, (iii) H3O+.

So the correct option is C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves an enamine derived from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. The enamine structure is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. The reagents in sequence are designed to deprotonate the enamine, alkylate the alpha position, and hydrolyze the enamine to form a ketone.

1. **Step (i): LDA in DME**  
   LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) is a strong base that deprotonates the alpha hydrogen of the enamine, generating a nucleophilic enamine anion.

2. **Step (ii): CH3CH2I**  
   Ethyl iodide, an alkylating agent, reacts with the nucleophilic enamine anion, adding an ethyl group to the alpha position of the enamine.

3. **Step (iii): H3O+**  
   Acid workup hydrolyzes the enamine, breaking it into a ketone and the corresponding amine. The addition of the ethyl group during the alkylation step results in a new ketone, heptan-4-one, as the final product.

The correct sequence of reagents is:  
(i) LDA in DME, (ii) CH3CH2I, (iii) H3O+.  
This corresponds to **Option C**, which also specifies the product as heptan-4-one.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about enamine reactions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think through it step by step.

The question is about a reaction sequence leading to product B. The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. I remember that enamine reactions usually involve the formation of an imine intermediate, which can then undergo various reactions.

Wait, so the starting compound is an enamine. Enamines are typically formed from a secondary amine and a carbonyl compound. The general structure is R2N-CHR'. In this case, the structure given seems to be an enamine because of the "ylidene" part, which indicates a double bond.

Looking at the starting material: (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. The "ylidene" group is a substituent on the nitrogen, so the structure is something like (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH=N with some substituents.

The reaction has three steps, each involving reagents A. The options give different sequences of reagents. Let me look at the options to get a better idea.

Option A: Steps are LDA, DME; then CH3CH2I; then H3O+. Product is pentan-2-one and dimethylethylamine.

Option B: Steps are LDA, then DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. Same product as A.

Option C: Steps are LDA, DME; then CH3CH2I; then H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Option D: Steps are LDA, then DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Wait, but the starting material is an enamine. So what do enamine reactions typically do? They can be used in the formation of rings or in the Michael addition, but another key use is as a nucleophile in substitution reactions. Enamines can also undergo hydrolysis to form ketones or aldehydes, depending on the structure.

So, the starting material is an enamine. Let's think about the reagents. LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) is a strong base, typically used to deprotonate compounds, especially in enolate formation. DME is 1,2-dimethoxyethane, a solvent. Then, CH3CH2I is ethyl iodide, an alkylating agent. H3O+ is probably for acid workup.

So, the reaction sequence would be: deprotonation with LDA, then alkylation, then acid workup.

Wait, but LDA is a base. How does it interact with the enamine? Maybe it deprotonates the enamine to form an enamine anion. Then, perhaps the ethyl iodide would act as an alkylating agent, providing an ethyl group.

But wait, in enamine reactions, the enamine can attack an electrophile. But after deprotonation, maybe the enamine becomes a stronger nucleophile.

So, step 1: LDA deprotonates the enamine. The enamine has a proton alpha to the nitrogen. Deprotonating would generate a strong nucleophile.

Step 2: Alkylation with ethyl iodide. The enamine anion would attack the ethyl iodide, perhaps leading to an alkylation at the alpha position.

Step 3: Acid workup. Once the alkylation is done, acid is added to hydrolyze the enamine back to a ketone and an amine.

Wait, but let's think about the structure. The starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH3 connected to N which is also connected to a CH2CH3 (from ethanaminium) and a methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine structure is R2C=NH, but in this case, it's more like R2N=CH-... Hmm.

Wait, the starting material is an enamine, so it's formed from a secondary amine and a carbonyl. Let's say the secondary amine is N-methylpentan-2-amine (but not sure). The carbonyl would be ethanamine maybe? I'm getting a bit confused, perhaps I should draw it out.

Alternatively, maybe the enamine is acting as a nucleophile. So, when LDA is added, it deprotonates the alpha hydrogen (the hydrogen next to the N in the enamine), making a strong base.

Then, ethyl iodide would alkylate that position. So, the enamine's carbon adjacent to N would get an ethyl group.

Wait, but enamine alkylation typically occurs at the alpha position. So after alkylation, when we hydrolyze, the structure would change.

Let me think about the hydrolysis. Enamines, when treated with acid, hydrolyze to form a ketone (if the starting material was a ketone) or an aldehyde (if from an aldehyde) and the amine.

But in this case, the starting enamine is derived from a ketone and an amine. So hydrolysis would break the enamine and release the ketone and the amine.

Wait, but in this reaction, after alkylation, the structure would be modified. So if the enamine is R2N-CH2-R', and then alkylated at the alpha position, perhaps adding another R'' group, then after hydrolysis, the ketone would have an extra R'' group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation occurs on the alpha carbon, and upon hydrolysis, that would result in a larger ketone.

Wait, let me think about what the starting enamine looks like. The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium.

So, the structure is:

The enamine is formed from pentan-2-ol and an amine. Wait, no. Wait, enamine formation involves an amine and a carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the enamine is formed from a secondary amine, like dimethylamine, and a carbonyl compound. Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is formed from pentan-2-one and N-methylethanamine (which is N,N-dimethylethanamine).

Wait, the enamine structure would be:

R2N-C=CH2, but perhaps more accurately, (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH=N-N(CH3)CH2CH3, but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an enamine derived from pentan-2-one (which is (CH2)2CO) and N,N-dimethylethanamine (which is (CH3)2NCH2CH3).

Wait, no, N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium is the starting material. So ethanaminium means that the amine is ethyl, with two methyl groups attached to the N. So, the structure is N,N-dimethyl-ethylamine, but connected via an imine linkage to a pentylidene group.

Wait, more accurately, the structure is:

The enamine is (E)-configuration. So, the structure is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH=N-N(CH2CH3)(CH3)?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure. Maybe I should focus on the reaction steps.

The reagents are in option C and D as LDA followed by DME, CH3CH2I, then H3O+.

Wait, no, let's look at the options again.

Option C: Steps are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Option D: Steps are (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about what each step does.

The starting material is an enamine (R2N-CH2-CH2-... but perhaps with a double bond). LDA is added, which is a strong base. It would deprotonate the alpha hydrogen, making the alpha carbon more nucleophilic.

Then, ethyl iodide would alkylate that position. So, the enamine would gain an ethyl group at the alpha position.

After that, acid is added (H3O+), which would protonate and hydrolyze the enamine. Hydrolysis of enamine typically gives a ketone and an amine.

So, if the enamine after alkylation has an additional ethyl group, the ketone formed after hydrolysis would have that ethyl group.

But wait, what's the original enamine's structure? Let me imagine it.

The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the enamine is (E)-CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3-C(=N-CH(CH3)CH2CH3)-something.

Wait, perhaps the enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. So, the general structure of an enamine is R2NC=CR2.

Wait, pentan-2-one is (CH2)2CO. The enamine would be formed by reacting a secondary amine with the carbonyl of pentan-2-one. So, the enamine would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH=N-R, where R is from the amine.

In this case, the amine is N,N-dimethylethanamine, which is (CH3)2NCH2CH3. So, the enamine would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH=N-CH(CH2CH3)(CH3).

Wait, that's probably incorrect. Let me try to imagine the structure better. The enamine is formed from a secondary amine and a ketone. The general structure is R2NC=CH-R', where R and R' come from the amine and the ketone.

Wait, no, more accurately, the enamine is R-C(=N-R'')-CH2R''', where R'' and R''' are from the amine. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Ok, perhaps let's not get too stuck on the exact structure. Instead, think about the reaction steps.

Step 1: LDA (a strong base) is added. LDA will deprotonate the alpha hydrogen (the H attached to the carbon adjacent to N in the enamine). This would generate an enamine anion, which is a strong nucleophile.

Step 2: CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide) is an alkylating agent. The enamine anion would attack the ethyl iodide, resulting in alkylation at the alpha position. So, the alpha carbon (next to N) would gain an ethyl group.

Step 3: H3O+ (acid workup) would protonate and hydrolyze the enamine. Hydrolysis of an enamine typically gives a ketone and the amine. So, the product would be a ketone where the alpha carbon has the new ethyl group.

Wait, but the starting enamine was from pentan-2-one and an amine. After alkylation, when it hydrolyzes, the ketone would have an additional ethyl group.

So, the original ketone was pentan-2-one (CH3CH2COCH2CH2CH3?), wait no. Wait, pentan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, that is, CH3CH2COCH2CH3? Wait, no. Wait, pentan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, so the structure is CH2CH2CO. Wait no, pentan-2-one is (CH2CH2)CO. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of carbon numbering.

Pentan-2-one is: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, five carbons in total, with the ketone in position 2.

When this reacts with a secondary amine, like N,N-dimethylethanamine, it forms an enamine. So the enamine would have the structure (CH3)2N-CH2-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait. The enamine is formed by replacing the O with NR2, and adding a CH2 group. Wait, perhaps it's (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH=N-(CH(CH2CH3)(CH3)).

Not sure, but perhaps the key is that after alkylation at the alpha position, hydrolysis will give a larger ketone.

Wait, the original starting ketone is pentan-2-one. After adding an ethyl group via alkylation, the ketone would have an extra ethyl group somewhere.

Wait, the starting enamine was formed from pentan-2-one and an amine. When you alkylate the alpha position, upon hydrolysis, you'll get a ketone with an additional ethyl group.

So, the original ketone is pentan-2-one (which is 3-pentanone?), no, wait pentan-2-one is (CH2)2CO. So, the product after alkylation and hydrolysis would have an additional ethyl group, making it a 5-carbon ketone? Or perhaps a 6-carbon?

Wait, perhaps the initial enamine has a 5-carbon chain (from pentanone), and after adding ethyl, the ketone becomes 6-carbon? Hmm.

Wait, the starting enamine is N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the pentan-2-ylidene is a substituent on the nitrogen. So, the enamine is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH=N-R, where R is from the ethanaminium part. So, R is (CH3)2NCH2CH3.

So, the structure is probably:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH=N-N(CH2CH3)(CH3)

Now, when LDA is added, it deprotonates the alpha hydrogen (the H on the CH2 next to N). Then, ethyl iodide would add an ethyl group to that carbon. So, after alkylation, that carbon would have an ethyl group attached.

Then, upon hydrolysis, the enamine would break down into a ketone and an amine. The ketone would have the ethyl group added, so the position of the carbonyl would shift accordingly.

Wait, perhaps the initial structure is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH=N-R. After alkylation, it becomes (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH(CH2CH3)=N-R. Then, upon hydrolysis, the N-R part would break off, and the carbonyl would form at the adjacent carbon.

Wait, no, the enamine structure is R2C=CR'-N-R''. So, when alkylation occurs at the alpha position (the CR'), and upon hydrolysis, the carbonyl would form.

Wait, perhaps the starting enamine is:

R-C(=N-R')-CH2-R''

So, after alkylation, the CH2-R'' becomes CH2-R''-CH2CH3 (if ethyl is added). Then, hydrolysis would form R-CO-R''-CH2CH3, which would be a ketone.

But I'm getting a bit tangled up here. Maybe I should think about the product options.

Options are either pentan-2-one plus amine, or heptan-4-one.

Hmm, the product B is either pentan-2-one plus N,N-dimethylethanamine, or heptan-4-one.

So, if the starting enamine comes from pentan-2-one and the amine, then after alkylation and hydrolysis, perhaps the product is a larger ketone.

Wait, hydrolysis of an enamine generally gives back the ketone and the amine. So, if the enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and dimethylethylamine, then hydrolysis would yield pentan-2-one and the amine. But in this case, we've added an ethyl group via alkylation.

Ah, so perhaps the alkylation adds an ethyl group to the alpha position, making the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl have an ethyl branch. So, when the enamine hydrolyzes, the ketone would have that ethyl group.

Wait, so the starting ketone is pentan-2-one (three carbons, ketone in the middle). After adding an ethyl group to the alpha position (the carbon adjacent to the ketone), the ketone would shift its position.

Wait, perhaps the structure after alkylation and hydrolysis would be:

The original enamine came from pentan-2-one (which has the structure CH3CH2COCH2CH3?), but wait, no, pentan-2-one is CH2CH2CO, so five carbons: CH3-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Let me clarify. Pentan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, which is:

CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? Wait, that's five carbons total. Wait, no. Wait, pentan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, which is 3-pentanone? No, wait, the correct structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the carbonyl is in position 2 of pentane.

So, structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH3, but more accurately:

CH3-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, that would be 3-pentanone. Wait, no, wait. Pentan-2-one is (CH2)2CO, which would be CH2CH2-CO, but that's only three carbons. Wait, maybe I'm confusing butanone and pentanone.

Wait, butanone can be 2-butanone (which is (CH3)2CO), and pentan-2-one would be CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH3. So, the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH3.

Wait, that's correct. So, pentan-2-one is CH2CH2COCH2CH3, which is (CH2)2COCH2CH3.

Wait, but when the enamine is formed from pentan-2-one and an amine, the structure becomes R2C=CR', where R comes from the ketone and R' from the amine.

Hmm, perhaps the enamine is (CH2CH2COCH2CH3)CH=N-R, where R is the amine substituent.

But perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let's think about the product. After alkylation and hydrolysis, what ketone would form?

If the starting ketone is pentan-2-one, and we add an ethyl group to the alpha position (the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl), then upon hydrolysis, the carbonyl would form at the same position but with an ethyl branch.

Wait, but wait, when you add an ethyl group to the alpha position, the hydrolysis would result in a ketone where the adjacent carbon has an ethyl group.

So, the original is pentan-2-one: CH3CH2COCH2CH3. If we add an ethyl group to the alpha position (the CH2 groups next to the carbonyl), the structure becomes CH2CH2-CO-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3.

Wait, but that's not right because the starting enamine's structure would determine where the ethyl is added.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3)CH=N-R. So, after alkylation, that CH becomes CH(CH2CH3). Then, upon hydrolysis, the carbonyl would be at that position, forming a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the product would be heptan-4-one. Because the starting enamine has a 5-carbon chain (pentan), and adding two carbons (ethyl) would make seven carbons in total when you hydrolyze.

Wait, let me count. The starting enamine is pentan-2-ylidene, which is five carbons. Adding an ethyl group would make it seven carbons. But how?

Wait, perhaps the enamine is derived from pentan-2-one, so the ketone is at position 2. Then, adding an ethyl group at the alpha position (position 1 or 3?) would shift the ketone position.

Hmm, perhaps the product is heptan-4-one. Let's see:

Heptan-4-one is CH2CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3.

So, seven carbons with the ketone in the middle.

Wait, but if the starting enamine is pentan-2-one-derived, adding two carbons (ethyl) would make the ketone at position 4 of a seven-carbon chain.

Wait, the enamine has five carbons (from pentan-2-one). Adding an ethyl group would add two more carbons. So, the resulting ketone would have five plus two equals seven? Or perhaps the position shifts.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is heptan-4-one because after hydrolysis, the ketone is formed at the position where the alkylation occurred.

So, looking back at the options, option C and D have B as heptan-4-one.

Option C's reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

Option D's reagents are (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+.

Wait, I think the correct order is LDA, then DME and ethyl iodide, then H3O+.

Wait, but LDA is a strong base, usually used in THF or DME as solvent. So, first step is LDA in DME, deprotonate the enamine.

Then, ethyl iodide is added as the electrophile; the enamine anion attacks it, adding an ethyl group.

Then, acid workup (H3O+) hydrolyzes the enamine to form the ketone and the amine.

So, in the reagent steps, it's:

(i) LDA in DME

(ii) CH3CH2I

(iii) H3O+

Which matches option C's reagents.

But wait, looking at the options, option C says the product is heptan-4-one, and the reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

So, the product would be heptan-4-one.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is pentan-2-one plus amine, but that's option A and B.

Wait, but the starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and an amine. If we alkylate the alpha position, hydrolysis would form a new ketone.

Wait, perhaps the initial enamine is from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. After alkylation and hydrolysis, the ketone would be pentan-2-one, but wait, no. Because the alkylation adds a group, which upon hydrolysis would become a substituent on the ketone.

Wait, the starting enamine is from a ketone and an amine. Let's say the enamine is R2C=CR'-N-R''. When you alkylate the alpha position (R'), it becomes R2C=CR''-CH2-R''' (where R''' is ethyl). Then, hydrolysis would form R2C(O)R''-CH2-R'''?

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the product is the same as the starting ketone but with an extra ethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction adds an ethyl group to the alpha position, so the ketone after hydrolysis would have (original carbonyl) plus ethyl substituent.

In that case, the original ketone is pentan-2-one (CH3CH2COCH2CH3), and adding an ethyl group at the alpha position (the CH2 groups next to CO) would give (CH2CH2COCH2CH(CH2CH3)).

Wait, but that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the enamine is (CH2)3CH2CH2CH3? No, I think I'm mixing up.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial enamine is a five-carbon structure. When we add ethyl, it becomes seven carbons, making heptan-4-one.

So, putting it all together, the reagents are LDA (deprotonate), ethyl iodide (alkylation), H3O+ (hydrolysis), leading to heptan-4-one as product B.

Which matches option C or D.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C: Steps are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Option D: Steps are (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. Product is heptan-4-one.

Wait, the correct order would be LDA (in DME) first, then ethyl iodide, then H3O+. So, Option C's steps are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

Yes, that makes sense because LDA is typically used with a solvent like DME or THF. So, step (i) is LDA in DME, then step (ii) adds ethyl iodide, then step (iii) adds H3O+.

So, the product would be heptan-4-one.

Looking back at the options, option C and D have B as heptan-4-one. But the reagent sequences differ.

Option C's reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

Option D's reagents are (i) LDA; (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+.

So, which sequence is correct?

In an actual reaction, you would first add the base (LDA) in the solvent (DME), then the electrophile (ethyl iodide), followed by acid workup.

Hence, the correct sequence is (i) LDA in DME, (ii) ethyl iodide, (iii) H3O+.

So the correct option is C.


The reaction involves an enamine derived from pentan-2-one and N,N-dimethylethanamine. The enamine structure is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. The reagents in sequence are designed to deprotonate the enamine, alkylate the alpha position, and hydrolyze the enamine to form a ketone.

1. **Step (i): LDA in DME**  
   LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) is a strong base that deprotonates the alpha hydrogen of the enamine, generating a nucleophilic enamine anion.

2. **Step (ii): CH3CH2I**  
   Ethyl iodide, an alkylating agent, reacts with the nucleophilic enamine anion, adding an ethyl group to the alpha position of the enamine.

3. **Step (iii): H3O+**  
   Acid workup hydrolyzes the enamine, breaking it into a ketone and the corresponding amine. The addition of the ethyl group during the alkylation step results in a new ketone, heptan-4-one, as the final product.

The correct sequence of reagents is:  
(i) LDA in DME, (ii) CH3CH2I, (iii) H3O+.  
This corresponds to **Option C**, which also specifies the product as heptan-4-one.

Answer: C
