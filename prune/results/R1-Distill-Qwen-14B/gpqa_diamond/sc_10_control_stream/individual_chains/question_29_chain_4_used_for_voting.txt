Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about barley and some gene mutation. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says that there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and now are looking at the target gene sequences. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm. So, the anti-nutritional compound is probably due to the gene being active. If we mutate the gene so that it's not functional anymore, the compound won't be made. So we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, like a premature stop codon or a frameshift that messes up the protein structure.

Looking at the sequences provided. The intact gene starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then there's a series of bases. Each mutant has a change in the first exon area. Exons are the parts that stay after introns are spliced, so changes in exons are more likely to affect the protein.

Let me look at the options one by one.

Intact gene:
5’-ATG TTT CTG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATG TTT CT A GC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA-3’
Wait, looking closely. Let me write them out more clearly. I think I'll compare each mutant's sequence to the intact.

Intact gene: positions 1-20 (approx) are ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So compare:

Intact: ATG TTT CT C G C TGG TAC TTCT...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT A GC TGG TAC TTCT...

Wait, maybe I should look for changes in the codons. Let's break them down.

Intact: The first part is ATG (start), then TTT (Phe), CT C (Gln?), wait no. Wait, each codon is 3 bases. Let's break the initial part.

Intact starts as:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT

So exons are all the coding regions. So any change in the exons could affect the protein.

Mutant 1:
ATG TTT CT A GC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC
Wait, so the first part: TTT is same as intact. Then in intact it's CTC (Leu?), but mutant1 has CTA (Leu?), wait no, CTA is Leu, same as CTC. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm not looking right.

Wait, wait. The first part of the intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT... Let me parse each three letters.

ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
CTC (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATT (Ile)
TAT (Tyr)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)

Mutant1's sequence: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...
So ATG (same)
TTT (same)
CTA (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATT (Ile)
TAT (Tyr)
TGT (Cys)
CGC (Arg)

Wait, so the only change in mutant1 is at position where intact has CTC (Leu) and mutant1 has CTA (Leu). So same amino acid. Then in the next codon, GCT is same. So maybe this is a silent mutation. Because the amino acid doesn't change. So this probably won't cause any issue. So this might not disrupt the protein. So this might not be the one.

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So let's see. Intact is CT C G C, so CTC GCT. Mutant2: CTAA GCT.

Wait, maybe I should write the sequence:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC

Breaking down:

ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
CTA (Leu)
AGC (Ser)
TGG (Trp)
TAC ( Tyr )
TTCT (Ser?) Wait, no, each codon is three bases. So the next is ACT (Thr) in intact.

Wait, maybe the exact positions are a bit tricky. Let me think. Intact gene in the first exon area is:

ATG TTT CT C G C TGG TAC TTCT GTG...

Mutant2 has:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TTCT...

So in the intact, after TTT comes CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala). In mutant2, after TTT comes CTA (Leu), then AGC (Ser). So the second codon after TTT is different.

So the third codon in intact is CTC, which is Leu, mutant2 has CTA (Leu) same. Next codon: intact is GCT (Ala), mutant2 is AGC (Ser). So that would change the amino acid from Ala (Al) to Ser (Ser). So that's a change in amino acid. But not a stop codon. So this could potentially change the protein structure, but unless it's a critical part, the gene may still produce a functional protein, but altered. So not sure if this is the answer.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Let's parse:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT

Intact's sequence in same area:

ATG TTT CT C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

So comparing, the first part is ATG TTT, same as intact. Next in intact: TACGCTGGTACTTCT. Wait, I think I'm getting a bit confused. Let me break it into codons.

Mutant3's sequence after ATG TTT: TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

Intact: After ATG TTT: CT C G C TGG TAC TTCT...

Wait, maybe I should write each codon.

Intact:

ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
CTC (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATT (Ile)
TAT (Tyr)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)

Mutant3:

ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
GTC (Val)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATT (Ile)
TAT (Tyr)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)

So the changes are in the third codon. Intact has CTC (Leu), mutant3 has TAC (Tyr). So that changes from Leu to Tyr. Then next codon, intact is GCT (Ala), same as mutant3. Then GGT same, but the next codon in intact is ACT, which is same as mutant3's GTC (Val). Wait, no, wait. After GGT in mutant3, next codon is GTC. Intact has ACT. So mutant3 has GTC (Val) where intact has ACT (Thr). So that's a change in amino acid. So two changes here: Leu to Tyr in the third codon, and Thr to Val in the sixth codon.

But again, unless this disrupts a critical part of the protein, the gene might still function. So I'm not sure if that would eliminate the compound.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Breaking down:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT

Intact has: CTC GCT GGT ACT...

So in mutant4, after TAC (Tyr) comes GCT (Ala), then ACT (Thr). Intact has GCT (Ala) after CTC (Leu) and then GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr).

Wait, so perhaps the codon structure is:

Intact after ATG TTT:
CTC (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
...

Mutant4: after ATG TTT,
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
...

Wait, so the first codon after ATG TTT is CTC in intact (Leu), but in mutant4, it's TAC (Tyr). So that's a change. Then next codon, GCT same as intact. Then ACT same as intact (Thr), but wait, after that, intact has GGT, which is Gly, but in mutant4, after ACT comes TCT (Ser), whereas in intact, after GGT comes ACT (Thr).

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me write the initial part.

Intact:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

So comparing the third codon: CTC (Leu) in intact, TAC (Tyr) in mutant4. So that's a change in amino acid.

Then in intact, the next codon is GCT (Ala), same as mutant4. Then in intact, after GCT comes GGT (Gly), but in mutant4, after GCT comes ACT (Thr). So where the intact has GGT (Gly), mutant4 has ACT (Thr). Then in intact, after GGT comes ACT (Thr), but in mutant4, after ACT comes TCT (Ser). So the sequence is different.

Wait, maybe I'm considering frame shifts. Because the number of bases changes. But wait, the question says that all the mutants have changes at the beginning of the first exon. So the length of the sequences shown seems same.

Wait, looking again, the intact gene has ...CGT…TGA, and the mutants have similar lengths?

Wait, looking at the last part:

Intact ends with ...CGT…TGA
Mutant1: ...CGC…TGA
Mutant2: ...CGC…TGA
Mutant3: ...CGT…TGA
Mutant4: ...CGT…TGA

So each has the same number of bases as the intact. So no frameshifts, it's a point mutation.

Wait, but let me check how the sequences compare.

Wait, looking at the first 30 bases or so.

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA
Mutant2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA
Mutant3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Ah, wait, maybe I should look for any stop codons. The presence of a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) would terminate translation early, making a shorter, nonfunctional protein.

Looking at each mutant:

Intact ends with ...CGT... TGA.

Wait, TGA is a stop codon, but in the intact gene, does it come at the end? Because the sequence shown ends with TGA, which is a stop. So maybe the gene is correctly ending. But in the mutants, are they introducing a stop codon somewhere else?

Wait, let me look at the sequences again.

In the first part, the intact gene has ...TGT CGT … TGA.

Mutant1: ...TGT CGC … TGA. So the last codon before stop is CGC (Arg). Then stop.

Mutant2: ...TGT CGC … TGA. Same as mutant1.

Mutant3: ...TGT CGT … TGA. Same as intact.

Mutant4: ...TGT CGT … TGA. Same as intact.

So, in mutants 1 and 2, they have CGC (Arg) before the stop codon. Mutant3 and 4 have CGT (Arg) before stop.

Wait, but that's not introducing a new stop codon. So maybe looking elsewhere.

Another approach: look for a frameshift. If a mutation causes a frameshift, the reading frame changes, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence from the mutation point onward, often leading to a premature stop codon.

Wait, all the mutations are in the first exon. Let me see if any of them have an insertion or deletion of nucleotides, which would cause a frameshift.

Looking at the sequences, the length seems the same. For example, the intact is about same length as all mutants. So no frameshift. So it's likely a point mutation.

So the options are point mutations that either change an amino acid or create a stop codon.

So let's check each mutant for any new stop codons.

Intact gene has TGA at the end. So it's the normal stop.

Mutant 1: sequence ends with ...CGC…TGA. So the stop is at the same position as before.

Mutant2: same as 1.

Mutant3: same as intact.

Mutant4: same as intact.

So none of the mutants have a new stop codon introduced before the end. Hmm. So perhaps a different approach.

Wait, perhaps a mutation that changes a codon to a stop codon somewhere else.

Looking again.

Mutant1: Looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking at the sequence, after the mutation, the codons are:

ATG TTT CT A GC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC TGA.

Wait, the third codon is CTA (Leu), next is GCA (Ala)? Or wait, let me parse the exact bases.

Wait, in the question, the sequences are written as:

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant1:5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, the intact has at the beginning: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA GC TGG TAC TTCT GTG...

Wait, the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu). In mutant1, perhaps it's CTA (Leu) because the third codon is CTA.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the fourth codon.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a mutation that results in a premature stop codon.

But in the given sequences, I don't see any TAA, TAG, or TGA except the last one.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each mutant's sequence for any stop codons before the end.

Mutant1:

Looking at each triplet:

ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
CTA (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATT (Ile)
TAT (Tyr)
TGT (Cys)
CGC (Arg)
TGA (stop)

So no premature stops.

Mutant2:

ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
CTA (Leu)
AGC (Ser)
TGG (Trp)
TAC (Tyr)
TTCT (Ser?), but wait each triplet:

ATG
TTT
CTA
AGC
TGG
TAC
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATT (Ile)
TAT (Tyr)
TGT (Cys)
CGC (Arg)
TGA (stop)

So no premature stops.

Mutant3:

ATG
TTT
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
GTC (Val)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATT (Ile)
TAT (Tyr)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)
TGA (stop)

No premature stops.

Mutant4:

ATG
TTT
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATT (Ile)
TAT (Tyr)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)
TGA (stop)

No premature stops.

Hmm. So where's the problem then? Maybe I'm missing something else.

Another thought: perhaps the gene is responsible for the anti-nutritional compound, so disabling it would eliminate the compound. If the mutation creates a nonfunctional gene product, like a truncated protein, or a completely different one.

But in all the mutants, the stop is at the end. So perhaps the changes are in the coding region leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Wait, let's look again.

In the intact gene, the first few codons are ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

Mutant1: sequence is ATG, TTT, CTA (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc. So the third codon is CTA (Leu), same as CTC (Leu). So no change in amino acid.

So this is a silent mutation. So the protein would be the same. So this probably won't affect the compound.

Mutant2: the sequence is ATG, TTT, CTA (Leu), AGC (Ser), TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr), etc. So the third codon is same as mutant1, but the fourth codon changes from GCT (Ala) to AGC (Ser). So this is a change from Ala to Ser. So the protein would have a different amino acid here. But unless this is a critical part, the gene might still function.

Mutant3: the sequence is ATG, TTT, TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), GTC (Val) instead of ACT (Thr). So two amino acid changes here. Could this disrupt the function of the gene product?

Mutant4: the sequence is ATG, TTT, TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). So, in this case, the Gly at position 4 is changed to Thr. So that's a change in amino acid.

Wait, but how would that affect the protein? It depends on where the change is. If these changes are in the active site, it would disrupt function. But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the best approach is to see which mutation would lead to a nonfunctional gene.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation introduces a stop codon earlier. Wait, another thing: perhaps the change in the codon leads to a stop. Let me check.

For example, in mutant3, after TAC, the next codon is GCT (Ala). Then GGT (Gly), then GTC (Val). So that's all fine. No stop codon.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check all the sequences again.

Wait, another approach: the gene has five exons. So any changes in exons during splicing? But all mutations are in the first exon, so splicing machinery shouldn't be affected. So the issue is about altering the coding sequence.

So, to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the gene's product must be nonfunctional. So the mutation must cause a nonfunctional protein.

Which of the mutations leads to a nonfunctional protein?

Mutant1: no amino acid change in the first few codons. So gene product same as before. So compound remains.

Mutant2: changes an Ala to Ser. Maybe not critical. Depends on the protein.

Mutant3: changes from Leu to Tyr, and Thr to Val. Two changes. Could affect function.

Mutant4: changes Leu to Tyr, and Gly to Thr. So two amino acids changed.

But none of these necessarily create a stop codon. So why would one of these mutants eliminate the compound?

Wait, wait. Oh! Wait a second. Looking back at the sequences, perhaps I missed a stop codon.

Looking at Mutant4:

Mutant4’s sequence is: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking into codons:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Wait, the 4th codon is GCT (Ala), 5th is ACT (Thr), which is different from the intact, which after GCT has GGT (Gly).

Wait, so the important part is that the mutation is in the first exon. So any mutation leading to a nonfunctional protein would be acceptable.

Wait, but without knowing which codon change affects the function, perhaps the best option is to find a mutation that introduces a stop codon earlier, or changes a critical site.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a nonsense mutation, which introduces a stop codon. But in the given sequences, I don't see any new stops except the last TGA.

Wait, perhaps the change is in a way that the gene becomes a pseudogene, unable to be transcribed or translated.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts the reading frame by an insertion or deletion. But all sequences seem same length.

Wait, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 creates a stop codon in another frame.

Wait, let me consider the possibility of a frameshift. Only possible if there's an insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three.

Looking at the sequences, is the length same? Let's count the letters.

Intact: let's count the letters in the first part. Let's take from ATG to TGA.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA → each group is three letters, so 17 codons (including the start and stop). So total letters: 17*3=51.

Mutant1: same length, 51 letters.

Same for each mutant. So no frameshifts, since the length is same. So, no frameshift mutations.

So, all mutations are point mutations.

So the only way to disrupt the gene is to change an amino acid in a critical position or introduce a stop codon.

But in the given sequences, all stop at the same place, so no early stops.

Hmmm. Maybe I'm missing something else. Oh wait! Maybe in the mutant, the change is in the start codon. Because if the start codon is altered, the protein won't be made at all.

Look at the start codon in each mutant:

Intact starts with ATG.

Mutant1: starts with ATG.

Mutant2: starts with ATG.

Mutant3: starts with ATG.

Mutant4: starts with ATG.

So no, all have the same start codon. So the start is intact.

Hmm. What else can cause the gene to be nonfunctional? Maybe a mutation in the promoter region, but the question says the mutations are in the target gene, which I assume is the coding region.

Wait, another thought: maybe the mutation causes a splicing defect. But the changes are in the first exon, so probably not affecting splicing. Also, the first exon is commonly constitutively spliced, so a mutation there might not affect splicing.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation causes the gene to produce a truncated protein. But unless a stop codon is introduced earlier, this won't happen.

Wait, unless the mutation creates a new in-frame stop codon.

Looking again:

In Mutant4's sequence, let me see the codons:

ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATT (Ile)
TAT (Tyr)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)
TGA (stop)

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the mutation introduces a stop codon in the same reading frame but earlier. Let's see.

Looking at each codon:

Mutant4's codons after TAC: GCT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, GAA, CAT, ATT, TAT, TGT, CGT, TGA.

So, in this sequence, after TAC, the next codons are GCT, ACT, etc. No stop codons until the end.

Wait, but in the first part, any chance of a stop?

Mutant4's third codon is TAC, which is Tyr. No stop.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible answers.

The question asks which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That would require the gene to be nonfunctional. So the best bet is a mutation that introduces a stop codon early in the gene.

Wait, but none of the mutants have a stop codon except the last one. So perhaps the correct answer is the one that changes the start codon. But none of the mutants have that.

Alternative approach: the gene is five exons, and the mutations are in the first exon. Maybe the mutation disrupts a splice site? No, because the question says the changes are in the first exon area. Also, the first exon is typically at the beginning, so a splice donor site is at the end of the first exon. If the mutation is in the splice site, it could cause exon skipping, leading to a frameshift or a truncated protein.

But looking at the given sequences, they all start with ATG, so the exon is included. So perhaps the mutation is in a critical region.

Wait, perhaps the mutation creates a new start codon upstream, leading to a different reading frame. But that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts the promoter. But the question says the mutation is in the target gene, so probably in the coding region.

Wait, the problem says that the gene consists of five exons and four introns. So the mutant lines' target gene sequences are after splicing, meaning that they've already had introns removed. So the mutations are in the exons.

So, perhaps the mutation is in the first exon, leading to a change in the first few amino acids, which is critical for protein function.

But which mutation would do that?

Looking back:

Mutant1: changes CTC (Leu) to CTA (Leu) → no change.

Mutant2: changes CTC (Leu) → CTA (Leu) and GCT → AGC (Ser). So the third codon is same, but fourth changes from Ala to Ser.

Mutant3: changes CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr) and ACT → GTC (Val). So third codon change, and sixth codon change.

Mutant4: changes CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr) and GCT (Ala) → ACT (Thr). Third codon change, fourth codon change.

So, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4. Because in the first few codons, changing a Gly to Thr. Wait, but why would that be worse?

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation introduces a premature stop codon. Oh! Wait a minute. Let's check the codons again.

Wait, in mutant3, the fourth codon is GTC (Val) instead of ACT (Thr). So, does that lead to anything?

Wait, another angle: perhaps the anti-nutritional compound is caused by an enzyme, and the mutation disrupts the enzyme's active site.

But without knowing the structure, perhaps the best approach is to find the mutation that introduces a stop codon elsewhere. However, in the given sequences, I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing the sequences.

Looking at Mutant4:

The sequence given is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking into codons:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

So, the 6th codon is TCT (Ser), whereas in the intact gene, the 6th codon is ACT (Thr). So in the intact, after ACT (Thr) comes TCT (Ser). In mutant4, after ACT (Thr) comes TCT (Ser). Wait, but I'm not seeing a difference.

Wait, no. Let me re-express:

In the intact gene:

After TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val)...

In mutant4, after TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val)...

So the change is that in mutant4, the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu), and the fourth codon is GCT (Ala) in both, but in the intact, the fourth codon is GCT (Ala), fifth is GGT (Gly), sixth is ACT (Thr).

In mutant4, the fifth codon is ACT (Thr), whereas in intact, fifth is GGT (Gly). So, the fifth codon in intact is GGT (Gly), in mutant4 it's ACT (Thr). So, that's a change.

So, Gly to Thr. That's a big change. Gly is a small, non-polar amino acid. Thr is polar. Depending on the context, this could disrupt the structure.

But is this sufficient to eliminate the compound? I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the mutation is a nonsense mutation (introduces a stop codon) in the same frame.

Looking again.

Mutant4's sequence:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

So, the last codon is TGA, which is the stop.

Wait, in the middle, is there any TAA, TAG, or TGA?

No. So, no early stop.

Another possibility: the mutation creates a cryptic splice site, leading to an intron retention. But that would complicate the mRNA and possibly lead to a nonfunctional protein. But without knowing the exact mutation location, it's hard to say.

Wait, another approach: which mutation alters the reading frame? No, all sequences are same length.

Wait, perhaps one of the mutations creates a stop codon in a different frame. But that would require a frameshift, which isn't the case here.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps I should look for the option where the first few codons are altered, leading to a nonfunctional gene product.

Another angle: the anti-nutritional compound is likely a secondary metabolite, perhaps something like a phenolic compound or similar. The gene product could be an enzyme involved in its synthesis. If the enzyme is nonfunctional, the compound won't be made.

So, which mutation would most likely render the enzyme nonfunctional?

If the mutation changes a critical amino acid in the active site, the enzyme won't function. Without knowing the structure, perhaps the best way is to find a mutation that changes multiple amino acids in the beginning, which are crucial for the enzyme's structure.

Looking at the mutations:

Mutant3 changes two amino acids early on: Leu to Tyr and Thr to Val.

Mutant4 changes two as well: Leu to Tyr and Gly to Thr.

Mutant2 changes one: Ala to Ser.

Mutant1 doesn't change.

So, perhaps Mutant3 or 4 are candidates.

But given that, which would be more likely to disrupt the gene function?

Maybe Mutant3, because the third codon is changed from Leu to Tyr, and the sixth codon from Thr to Val. These changes are in the beginning of the protein, which could be important for structure.

Alternatively, in Mutant4, the fourth codon changes from Gly to Thr, which is a more significant structural change.

Wait, Glycine is the most flexible amino acid, as it's small. Replacing it with Thr, which is bulkier and has a hydroxyl group, could disrupt the structure.

So, perhaps Mutant4 would cause a more significant change.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, as it changes a Gly to Thr, which is a big structural change.

Wait a second—let me look again at the sequences.

In Mutant3, the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). So the third amino acid is Tyr instead of Leu. Then, the sixth codon is GTC (Val) instead of ACT (Thr). So, third and sixth positions are changed.

In Mutant4, the third codon is TAC (Tyr), and the fourth codon is ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). So, third and fourth positions are changed.

Hmm. Without knowing the gene's function, it's hard to say. But perhaps the mutation that causes the most significant changes in the early codons is the correct choice.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the mutations creates a stop codon if read in a different frame. But since it's a point mutation, that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: the gene has five exons. If a mutation occurs in a splice site, it could cause exon skipping. But the question says the mutations are in the first exon area, and all the sequences are from the first exon, so probably the splicing isn't affected.

Wait, looking at the sequences again, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 disrupts a critical site.

Wait, perhaps the first few codons are important for the function of the enzyme. So, changing them could disrupt the function.

In that case, Mutant3 and Mutant4 both have changes in the first few codons.

But which one is more likely to disrupt the function?

Hmm. Another approach: think about which mutation could lead to a nonfunctional gene product. The anti-nutritional compound is made by the gene product, so eliminating the gene product would eliminate the compound.

So, the question is which mutation would most probably disrupt the gene function.

In such cases, the best bet is a nonsense mutation leading to a truncated protein. But none of the mutants have that.

Alternatively, a missense mutation in a critical region. Without knowing the structure, it's hard to say, but perhaps the one with the most changes early on would be more likely.

Between Mutant3 and Mutant4, both have two early changes. But let's see:

Mutant3’s changes:

Position 3: Leu → Tyr

Position 6: Thr → Val

Mutant4’s changes:

Position3: Leu → Tyr

Position4: Gly → Thr

So, in Mutant4, the fourth codon is Gly → Thr. Gly is a very flexible residue, often found in tight turns. Replacing it with Thr could disrupt the structure.

In Mutant3, the sixth codon is changed. Depending on the protein's structure, this might be more or less critical.

Given that, perhaps Mutant4 is the most disruptive.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant2.

Wait, in Mutant2, the fourth codon changes from GCT (Ala) to AGC (Ser). So, it's an Ala to Ser change. Both are small, but Ser is hydroxylated. Depending on the context, this might disrupt hydrogen bonds or structures. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the correct answer is Mutant2 because it changes the codon from GCT (Ala) to AGC (Ser), which is a change from an aliphatic to a polar residue. This could disrupt a binding site.

But I'm not confident. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1, but I don't think so because it's a silent mutation.

Wait, I think I've spent enough time thinking. Based on the given options, the most likely correct answer is Mutant4. Because it changes two amino acids early in the protein, which could disrupt the function.

To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. This could occur if the mutation introduces a premature stop codon, alters critical amino acids, or significantly changes the protein structure. The analysis of each mutant is as follows:

### Intact Gene Sequence:
5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’  
- The gene starts with **ATG** (start codon) and ends with **TGA** (stop codon).  
- The sequence contains no premature stop codons in the middle.

### Mutant 1:
5’-ATG TTT CTA GC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA-3’  
- Changes:  
  - **CTC (Leu)** → **CTA (Leu)** (no change in amino acid).  
  - **GCT (Ala)** remains unchanged.  
- **No significant disruption** to the protein sequence or function.

### Mutant 2:
5’-ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA-3’  
- Changes:  
  - **CTC (Leu)** → **CTA (Leu)** (no change in amino acid).  
  - **GCT (Ala)** → **AGC (Ser)** (change from aliphatic to polar residue).  
- This introduces a polar amino acid, which could disrupt hydrogen bonding or binding sites, but the effect depends on the protein's specific structure.

### Mutant 3:
5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’  
- Changes:  
  - **CTC (Leu)** → **TAC (Tyr)** (change from non-polar to aromatic residue).  
  - **ACT (Thr)** → **GTC (Val)** (change from polar to non-polar residue).  
- These changes occur early in the protein sequence and could significantly disrupt the protein's structure or function.

### Mutant 4:
5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’  
- Changes:  
  - **CTC (Leu)** → **TAC (Tyr)** (change from non-polar to aromatic residue).  
  - **GGT (Gly)** → **ACT (Thr)** (change from small, flexible to polar residue).  
- These changes occur early in the protein sequence and could disrupt the protein's structure or function, particularly since **Gly** is often found in tight turns and is replaced by the bulkier **Thr**.

### Conclusion:
The anti-nutritional compound is likely produced by the gene's protein product. To eliminate the compound, the gene must be rendered nonfunctional. Among the mutants, **Mutant 4** introduces the most significant changes early in the protein sequence, particularly the replacement of **Gly** with **Thr**, which could disrupt the protein's structure and function. This makes **Mutant 4** the most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about barley and some gene mutation. Let me try to figure this out step by step. 

The question says that there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and now are looking at the target gene sequences. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Hmm. So, the anti-nutritional compound is probably due to the gene being active. If we mutate the gene so that it's not functional anymore, the compound won't be made. So we're looking for a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, like a premature stop codon or a frameshift that messes up the protein structure.

Looking at the sequences provided. The intact gene starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then there's a series of bases. Each mutant has a change in the first exon area. Exons are the parts that stay after introns are spliced, so changes in exons are more likely to affect the protein.

Let me look at the options one by one.

Intact gene:
5’-ATG TTT CTG GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’

Mutant 1:
5’-ATG TTT CT A GC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA-3’
Wait, looking closely. Let me write them out more clearly. I think I'll compare each mutant's sequence to the intact.

Intact gene: positions 1-20 (approx) are ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant 1: 5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So compare:

Intact: ATG TTT CT C G C TGG TAC TTCT...
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT A GC TGG TAC TTCT...

Wait, maybe I should look for changes in the codons. Let's break them down.

Intact: The first part is ATG (start), then TTT (Phe), CT C (Gln?), wait no. Wait, each codon is 3 bases. Let's break the initial part.

Intact starts as:
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT

So exons are all the coding regions. So any change in the exons could affect the protein.

Mutant 1:
ATG TTT CT A GC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC
Wait, so the first part: TTT is same as intact. Then in intact it's CTC (Leu?), but mutant1 has CTA (Leu?), wait no, CTA is Leu, same as CTC. Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm not looking right.

Wait, wait. The first part of the intact is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCT... Let me parse each three letters.

ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
CTC (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATT (Ile)
TAT (Tyr)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)

Mutant1's sequence: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCT...
So ATG (same)
TTT (same)
CTA (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATT (Ile)
TAT (Tyr)
TGT (Cys)
CGC (Arg)

Wait, so the only change in mutant1 is at position where intact has CTC (Leu) and mutant1 has CTA (Leu). So same amino acid. Then in the next codon, GCT is same. So maybe this is a silent mutation. Because the amino acid doesn't change. So this probably won't cause any issue. So this might not disrupt the protein. So this might not be the one.

Mutant2: 5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So let's see. Intact is CT C G C, so CTC GCT. Mutant2: CTAA GCT.

Wait, maybe I should write the sequence:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC

Breaking down:

ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
CTA (Leu)
AGC (Ser)
TGG (Trp)
TAC ( Tyr )
TTCT (Ser?) Wait, no, each codon is three bases. So the next is ACT (Thr) in intact.

Wait, maybe the exact positions are a bit tricky. Let me think. Intact gene in the first exon area is:

ATG TTT CT C G C TGG TAC TTCT GTG...

Mutant2 has:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TTCT...

So in the intact, after TTT comes CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala). In mutant2, after TTT comes CTA (Leu), then AGC (Ser). So the second codon after TTT is different.

So the third codon in intact is CTC, which is Leu, mutant2 has CTA (Leu) same. Next codon: intact is GCT (Ala), mutant2 is AGC (Ser). So that would change the amino acid from Ala (Al) to Ser (Ser). So that's a change in amino acid. But not a stop codon. So this could potentially change the protein structure, but unless it's a critical part, the gene may still produce a functional protein, but altered. So not sure if this is the answer.

Mutant3: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Let's parse:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT

Intact's sequence in same area:

ATG TTT CT C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

So comparing, the first part is ATG TTT, same as intact. Next in intact: TACGCTGGTACTTCT. Wait, I think I'm getting a bit confused. Let me break it into codons.

Mutant3's sequence after ATG TTT: TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG...

Intact: After ATG TTT: CT C G C TGG TAC TTCT...

Wait, maybe I should write each codon.

Intact:

ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
CTC (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATT (Ile)
TAT (Tyr)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)

Mutant3:

ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
GTC (Val)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATT (Ile)
TAT (Tyr)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)

So the changes are in the third codon. Intact has CTC (Leu), mutant3 has TAC (Tyr). So that changes from Leu to Tyr. Then next codon, intact is GCT (Ala), same as mutant3. Then GGT same, but the next codon in intact is ACT, which is same as mutant3's GTC (Val). Wait, no, wait. After GGT in mutant3, next codon is GTC. Intact has ACT. So mutant3 has GTC (Val) where intact has ACT (Thr). So that's a change in amino acid. So two changes here: Leu to Tyr in the third codon, and Thr to Val in the sixth codon.

But again, unless this disrupts a critical part of the protein, the gene might still function. So I'm not sure if that would eliminate the compound.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Breaking down:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT

Intact has: CTC GCT GGT ACT...

So in mutant4, after TAC (Tyr) comes GCT (Ala), then ACT (Thr). Intact has GCT (Ala) after CTC (Leu) and then GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr).

Wait, so perhaps the codon structure is:

Intact after ATG TTT:
CTC (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
...

Mutant4: after ATG TTT,
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
...

Wait, so the first codon after ATG TTT is CTC in intact (Leu), but in mutant4, it's TAC (Tyr). So that's a change. Then next codon, GCT same as intact. Then ACT same as intact (Thr), but wait, after that, intact has GGT, which is Gly, but in mutant4, after ACT comes TCT (Ser), whereas in intact, after GGT comes ACT (Thr).

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me write the initial part.

Intact:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant4:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG...

So comparing the third codon: CTC (Leu) in intact, TAC (Tyr) in mutant4. So that's a change in amino acid.

Then in intact, the next codon is GCT (Ala), same as mutant4. Then in intact, after GCT comes GGT (Gly), but in mutant4, after GCT comes ACT (Thr). So where the intact has GGT (Gly), mutant4 has ACT (Thr). Then in intact, after GGT comes ACT (Thr), but in mutant4, after ACT comes TCT (Ser). So the sequence is different.

Wait, maybe I'm considering frame shifts. Because the number of bases changes. But wait, the question says that all the mutants have changes at the beginning of the first exon. So the length of the sequences shown seems same.

Wait, looking again, the intact gene has ...CGT…TGA, and the mutants have similar lengths?

Wait, looking at the last part:

Intact ends with ...CGT…TGA
Mutant1: ...CGC…TGA
Mutant2: ...CGC…TGA
Mutant3: ...CGT…TGA
Mutant4: ...CGT…TGA

So each has the same number of bases as the intact. So no frameshifts, it's a point mutation.

Wait, but let me check how the sequences compare.

Wait, looking at the first 30 bases or so.

Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA
Mutant2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA
Mutant3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Ah, wait, maybe I should look for any stop codons. The presence of a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) would terminate translation early, making a shorter, nonfunctional protein.

Looking at each mutant:

Intact ends with ...CGT... TGA.

Wait, TGA is a stop codon, but in the intact gene, does it come at the end? Because the sequence shown ends with TGA, which is a stop. So maybe the gene is correctly ending. But in the mutants, are they introducing a stop codon somewhere else?

Wait, let me look at the sequences again.

In the first part, the intact gene has ...TGT CGT … TGA.

Mutant1: ...TGT CGC … TGA. So the last codon before stop is CGC (Arg). Then stop.

Mutant2: ...TGT CGC … TGA. Same as mutant1.

Mutant3: ...TGT CGT … TGA. Same as intact.

Mutant4: ...TGT CGT … TGA. Same as intact.

So, in mutants 1 and 2, they have CGC (Arg) before the stop codon. Mutant3 and 4 have CGT (Arg) before stop.

Wait, but that's not introducing a new stop codon. So maybe looking elsewhere.

Another approach: look for a frameshift. If a mutation causes a frameshift, the reading frame changes, leading to a completely different amino acid sequence from the mutation point onward, often leading to a premature stop codon.

Wait, all the mutations are in the first exon. Let me see if any of them have an insertion or deletion of nucleotides, which would cause a frameshift.

Looking at the sequences, the length seems the same. For example, the intact is about same length as all mutants. So no frameshift. So it's likely a point mutation.

So the options are point mutations that either change an amino acid or create a stop codon.

So let's check each mutant for any new stop codons.

Intact gene has TGA at the end. So it's the normal stop.

Mutant 1: sequence ends with ...CGC…TGA. So the stop is at the same position as before.

Mutant2: same as 1.

Mutant3: same as intact.

Mutant4: same as intact.

So none of the mutants have a new stop codon introduced before the end. Hmm. So perhaps a different approach.

Wait, perhaps a mutation that changes a codon to a stop codon somewhere else.

Looking again.

Mutant1: Looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking at the sequence, after the mutation, the codons are:

ATG TTT CT A GC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC TGA.

Wait, the third codon is CTA (Leu), next is GCA (Ala)? Or wait, let me parse the exact bases.

Wait, in the question, the sequences are written as:

Intact: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Mutant1:5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’

So, the intact has at the beginning: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG...

Mutant1: ATG TTT CTA GC TGG TAC TTCT GTG...

Wait, the third codon in intact is CTC (Leu). In mutant1, perhaps it's CTA (Leu) because the third codon is CTA.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the fourth codon.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a mutation that results in a premature stop codon.

But in the given sequences, I don't see any TAA, TAG, or TGA except the last one.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check each mutant's sequence for any stop codons before the end.

Mutant1:

Looking at each triplet:

ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
CTA (Leu)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATT (Ile)
TAT (Tyr)
TGT (Cys)
CGC (Arg)
TGA (stop)

So no premature stops.

Mutant2:

ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
CTA (Leu)
AGC (Ser)
TGG (Trp)
TAC (Tyr)
TTCT (Ser?), but wait each triplet:

ATG
TTT
CTA
AGC
TGG
TAC
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATT (Ile)
TAT (Tyr)
TGT (Cys)
CGC (Arg)
TGA (stop)

So no premature stops.

Mutant3:

ATG
TTT
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
GGT (Gly)
GTC (Val)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATT (Ile)
TAT (Tyr)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)
TGA (stop)

No premature stops.

Mutant4:

ATG
TTT
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATT (Ile)
TAT (Tyr)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)
TGA (stop)

No premature stops.

Hmm. So where's the problem then? Maybe I'm missing something else.

Another thought: perhaps the gene is responsible for the anti-nutritional compound, so disabling it would eliminate the compound. If the mutation creates a nonfunctional gene product, like a truncated protein, or a completely different one.

But in all the mutants, the stop is at the end. So perhaps the changes are in the coding region leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Wait, let's look again.

In the intact gene, the first few codons are ATG (start), TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc.

Mutant1: sequence is ATG, TTT, CTA (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc. So the third codon is CTA (Leu), same as CTC (Leu). So no change in amino acid.

So this is a silent mutation. So the protein would be the same. So this probably won't affect the compound.

Mutant2: the sequence is ATG, TTT, CTA (Leu), AGC (Ser), TGG (Trp), TAC (Tyr), etc. So the third codon is same as mutant1, but the fourth codon changes from GCT (Ala) to AGC (Ser). So this is a change from Ala to Ser. So the protein would have a different amino acid here. But unless this is a critical part, the gene might still function.

Mutant3: the sequence is ATG, TTT, TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), GTC (Val) instead of ACT (Thr). So two amino acid changes here. Could this disrupt the function of the gene product?

Mutant4: the sequence is ATG, TTT, TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu), then GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). So, in this case, the Gly at position 4 is changed to Thr. So that's a change in amino acid.

Wait, but how would that affect the protein? It depends on where the change is. If these changes are in the active site, it would disrupt function. But without knowing the exact structure, perhaps the best approach is to see which mutation would lead to a nonfunctional gene.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation introduces a stop codon earlier. Wait, another thing: perhaps the change in the codon leads to a stop. Let me check.

For example, in mutant3, after TAC, the next codon is GCT (Ala). Then GGT (Gly), then GTC (Val). So that's all fine. No stop codon.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking in the wrong place. Let me check all the sequences again.

Wait, another approach: the gene has five exons. So any changes in exons during splicing? But all mutations are in the first exon, so splicing machinery shouldn't be affected. So the issue is about altering the coding sequence.

So, to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound, the gene's product must be nonfunctional. So the mutation must cause a nonfunctional protein.

Which of the mutations leads to a nonfunctional protein?

Mutant1: no amino acid change in the first few codons. So gene product same as before. So compound remains.

Mutant2: changes an Ala to Ser. Maybe not critical. Depends on the protein.

Mutant3: changes from Leu to Tyr, and Thr to Val. Two changes. Could affect function.

Mutant4: changes Leu to Tyr, and Gly to Thr. So two amino acids changed.

But none of these necessarily create a stop codon. So why would one of these mutants eliminate the compound?

Wait, wait. Oh! Wait a second. Looking back at the sequences, perhaps I missed a stop codon.

Looking at Mutant4:

Mutant4’s sequence is: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking into codons:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

Wait, the 4th codon is GCT (Ala), 5th is ACT (Thr), which is different from the intact, which after GCT has GGT (Gly).

Wait, so the important part is that the mutation is in the first exon. So any mutation leading to a nonfunctional protein would be acceptable.

Wait, but without knowing which codon change affects the function, perhaps the best option is to find a mutation that introduces a stop codon earlier, or changes a critical site.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a nonsense mutation, which introduces a stop codon. But in the given sequences, I don't see any new stops except the last TGA.

Wait, perhaps the change is in a way that the gene becomes a pseudogene, unable to be transcribed or translated.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts the reading frame by an insertion or deletion. But all sequences seem same length.

Wait, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 creates a stop codon in another frame.

Wait, let me consider the possibility of a frameshift. Only possible if there's an insertion or deletion of a number of bases not divisible by three.

Looking at the sequences, is the length same? Let's count the letters.

Intact: let's count the letters in the first part. Let's take from ATG to TGA.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT TGA → each group is three letters, so 17 codons (including the start and stop). So total letters: 17*3=51.

Mutant1: same length, 51 letters.

Same for each mutant. So no frameshifts, since the length is same. So, no frameshift mutations.

So, all mutations are point mutations.

So the only way to disrupt the gene is to change an amino acid in a critical position or introduce a stop codon.

But in the given sequences, all stop at the same place, so no early stops.

Hmmm. Maybe I'm missing something else. Oh wait! Maybe in the mutant, the change is in the start codon. Because if the start codon is altered, the protein won't be made at all.

Look at the start codon in each mutant:

Intact starts with ATG.

Mutant1: starts with ATG.

Mutant2: starts with ATG.

Mutant3: starts with ATG.

Mutant4: starts with ATG.

So no, all have the same start codon. So the start is intact.

Hmm. What else can cause the gene to be nonfunctional? Maybe a mutation in the promoter region, but the question says the mutations are in the target gene, which I assume is the coding region.

Wait, another thought: maybe the mutation causes a splicing defect. But the changes are in the first exon, so probably not affecting splicing. Also, the first exon is commonly constitutively spliced, so a mutation there might not affect splicing.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation causes the gene to produce a truncated protein. But unless a stop codon is introduced earlier, this won't happen.

Wait, unless the mutation creates a new in-frame stop codon.

Looking again:

In Mutant4's sequence, let me see the codons:

ATG (start)
TTT (Phe)
TAC (Tyr)
GCT (Ala)
ACT (Thr)
TCT (Ser)
GTG (Val)
GAT (Asp)
GAA (Glu)
CAT (His)
ATT (Ile)
TAT (Tyr)
TGT (Cys)
CGT (Arg)
TGA (stop)

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the mutation introduces a stop codon in the same reading frame but earlier. Let's see.

Looking at each codon:

Mutant4's codons after TAC: GCT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, GAA, CAT, ATT, TAT, TGT, CGT, TGA.

So, in this sequence, after TAC, the next codons are GCT, ACT, etc. No stop codons until the end.

Wait, but in the first part, any chance of a stop?

Mutant4's third codon is TAC, which is Tyr. No stop.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible answers.

The question asks which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That would require the gene to be nonfunctional. So the best bet is a mutation that introduces a stop codon early in the gene.

Wait, but none of the mutants have a stop codon except the last one. So perhaps the correct answer is the one that changes the start codon. But none of the mutants have that.

Alternative approach: the gene is five exons, and the mutations are in the first exon. Maybe the mutation disrupts a splice site? No, because the question says the changes are in the first exon area. Also, the first exon is typically at the beginning, so a splice donor site is at the end of the first exon. If the mutation is in the splice site, it could cause exon skipping, leading to a frameshift or a truncated protein.

But looking at the given sequences, they all start with ATG, so the exon is included. So perhaps the mutation is in a critical region.

Wait, perhaps the mutation creates a new start codon upstream, leading to a different reading frame. But that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts the promoter. But the question says the mutation is in the target gene, so probably in the coding region.

Wait, the problem says that the gene consists of five exons and four introns. So the mutant lines' target gene sequences are after splicing, meaning that they've already had introns removed. So the mutations are in the exons.

So, perhaps the mutation is in the first exon, leading to a change in the first few amino acids, which is critical for protein function.

But which mutation would do that?

Looking back:

Mutant1: changes CTC (Leu) to CTA (Leu) → no change.

Mutant2: changes CTC (Leu) → CTA (Leu) and GCT → AGC (Ser). So the third codon is same, but fourth changes from Ala to Ser.

Mutant3: changes CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr) and ACT → GTC (Val). So third codon change, and sixth codon change.

Mutant4: changes CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr) and GCT (Ala) → ACT (Thr). Third codon change, fourth codon change.

So, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4. Because in the first few codons, changing a Gly to Thr. Wait, but why would that be worse?

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation introduces a premature stop codon. Oh! Wait a minute. Let's check the codons again.

Wait, in mutant3, the fourth codon is GTC (Val) instead of ACT (Thr). So, does that lead to anything?

Wait, another angle: perhaps the anti-nutritional compound is caused by an enzyme, and the mutation disrupts the enzyme's active site.

But without knowing the structure, perhaps the best approach is to find the mutation that introduces a stop codon elsewhere. However, in the given sequences, I don't see any.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing the sequences.

Looking at Mutant4:

The sequence given is:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking into codons:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

So, the 6th codon is TCT (Ser), whereas in the intact gene, the 6th codon is ACT (Thr). So in the intact, after ACT (Thr) comes TCT (Ser). In mutant4, after ACT (Thr) comes TCT (Ser). Wait, but I'm not seeing a difference.

Wait, no. Let me re-express:

In the intact gene:

After TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val)...

In mutant4, after TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val)...

So the change is that in mutant4, the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu), and the fourth codon is GCT (Ala) in both, but in the intact, the fourth codon is GCT (Ala), fifth is GGT (Gly), sixth is ACT (Thr).

In mutant4, the fifth codon is ACT (Thr), whereas in intact, fifth is GGT (Gly). So, the fifth codon in intact is GGT (Gly), in mutant4 it's ACT (Thr). So, that's a change.

So, Gly to Thr. That's a big change. Gly is a small, non-polar amino acid. Thr is polar. Depending on the context, this could disrupt the structure.

But is this sufficient to eliminate the compound? I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the mutation is a nonsense mutation (introduces a stop codon) in the same frame.

Looking again.

Mutant4's sequence:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA

So, the last codon is TGA, which is the stop.

Wait, in the middle, is there any TAA, TAG, or TGA?

No. So, no early stop.

Another possibility: the mutation creates a cryptic splice site, leading to an intron retention. But that would complicate the mRNA and possibly lead to a nonfunctional protein. But without knowing the exact mutation location, it's hard to say.

Wait, another approach: which mutation alters the reading frame? No, all sequences are same length.

Wait, perhaps one of the mutations creates a stop codon in a different frame. But that would require a frameshift, which isn't the case here.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but perhaps I should look for the option where the first few codons are altered, leading to a nonfunctional gene product.

Another angle: the anti-nutritional compound is likely a secondary metabolite, perhaps something like a phenolic compound or similar. The gene product could be an enzyme involved in its synthesis. If the enzyme is nonfunctional, the compound won't be made.

So, which mutation would most likely render the enzyme nonfunctional?

If the mutation changes a critical amino acid in the active site, the enzyme won't function. Without knowing the structure, perhaps the best way is to find a mutation that changes multiple amino acids in the beginning, which are crucial for the enzyme's structure.

Looking at the mutations:

Mutant3 changes two amino acids early on: Leu to Tyr and Thr to Val.

Mutant4 changes two as well: Leu to Tyr and Gly to Thr.

Mutant2 changes one: Ala to Ser.

Mutant1 doesn't change.

So, perhaps Mutant3 or 4 are candidates.

But given that, which would be more likely to disrupt the gene function?

Maybe Mutant3, because the third codon is changed from Leu to Tyr, and the sixth codon from Thr to Val. These changes are in the beginning of the protein, which could be important for structure.

Alternatively, in Mutant4, the fourth codon changes from Gly to Thr, which is a more significant structural change.

Wait, Glycine is the most flexible amino acid, as it's small. Replacing it with Thr, which is bulkier and has a hydroxyl group, could disrupt the structure.

So, perhaps Mutant4 would cause a more significant change.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, as it changes a Gly to Thr, which is a big structural change.

Wait a second—let me look again at the sequences.

In Mutant3, the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). So the third amino acid is Tyr instead of Leu. Then, the sixth codon is GTC (Val) instead of ACT (Thr). So, third and sixth positions are changed.

In Mutant4, the third codon is TAC (Tyr), and the fourth codon is ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). So, third and fourth positions are changed.

Hmm. Without knowing the gene's function, it's hard to say. But perhaps the mutation that causes the most significant changes in the early codons is the correct choice.

Alternatively, perhaps one of the mutations creates a stop codon if read in a different frame. But since it's a point mutation, that's unlikely.

Wait, another thought: the gene has five exons. If a mutation occurs in a splice site, it could cause exon skipping. But the question says the mutations are in the first exon area, and all the sequences are from the first exon, so probably the splicing isn't affected.

Wait, looking at the sequences again, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 disrupts a critical site.

Wait, perhaps the first few codons are important for the function of the enzyme. So, changing them could disrupt the function.

In that case, Mutant3 and Mutant4 both have changes in the first few codons.

But which one is more likely to disrupt the function?

Hmm. Another approach: think about which mutation could lead to a nonfunctional gene product. The anti-nutritional compound is made by the gene product, so eliminating the gene product would eliminate the compound.

So, the question is which mutation would most probably disrupt the gene function.

In such cases, the best bet is a nonsense mutation leading to a truncated protein. But none of the mutants have that.

Alternatively, a missense mutation in a critical region. Without knowing the structure, it's hard to say, but perhaps the one with the most changes early on would be more likely.

Between Mutant3 and Mutant4, both have two early changes. But let's see:

Mutant3’s changes:

Position 3: Leu → Tyr

Position 6: Thr → Val

Mutant4’s changes:

Position3: Leu → Tyr

Position4: Gly → Thr

So, in Mutant4, the fourth codon is Gly → Thr. Gly is a very flexible residue, often found in tight turns. Replacing it with Thr could disrupt the structure.

In Mutant3, the sixth codon is changed. Depending on the protein's structure, this might be more or less critical.

Given that, perhaps Mutant4 is the most disruptive.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant2.

Wait, in Mutant2, the fourth codon changes from GCT (Ala) to AGC (Ser). So, it's an Ala to Ser change. Both are small, but Ser is hydroxylated. Depending on the context, this might disrupt hydrogen bonds or structures. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the correct answer is Mutant2 because it changes the codon from GCT (Ala) to AGC (Ser), which is a change from an aliphatic to a polar residue. This could disrupt a binding site.

But I'm not confident. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1, but I don't think so because it's a silent mutation.

Wait, I think I've spent enough time thinking. Based on the given options, the most likely correct answer is Mutant4. Because it changes two amino acids early in the protein, which could disrupt the function.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we need to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. This could occur if the mutation introduces a premature stop codon, alters critical amino acids, or significantly changes the protein structure. The analysis of each mutant is as follows:

### Intact Gene Sequence:
5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’  
- The gene starts with **ATG** (start codon) and ends with **TGA** (stop codon).  
- The sequence contains no premature stop codons in the middle.

### Mutant 1:
5’-ATG TTT CTA GC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA-3’  
- Changes:  
  - **CTC (Leu)** → **CTA (Leu)** (no change in amino acid).  
  - **GCT (Ala)** remains unchanged.  
- **No significant disruption** to the protein sequence or function.

### Mutant 2:
5’-ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TTCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC … TGA-3’  
- Changes:  
  - **CTC (Leu)** → **CTA (Leu)** (no change in amino acid).  
  - **GCT (Ala)** → **AGC (Ser)** (change from aliphatic to polar residue).  
- This introduces a polar amino acid, which could disrupt hydrogen bonding or binding sites, but the effect depends on the protein's specific structure.

### Mutant 3:
5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’  
- Changes:  
  - **CTC (Leu)** → **TAC (Tyr)** (change from non-polar to aromatic residue).  
  - **ACT (Thr)** → **GTC (Val)** (change from polar to non-polar residue).  
- These changes occur early in the protein sequence and could significantly disrupt the protein's structure or function.

### Mutant 4:
5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT … TGA-3’  
- Changes:  
  - **CTC (Leu)** → **TAC (Tyr)** (change from non-polar to aromatic residue).  
  - **GGT (Gly)** → **ACT (Thr)** (change from small, flexible to polar residue).  
- These changes occur early in the protein sequence and could disrupt the protein's structure or function, particularly since **Gly** is often found in tight turns and is replaced by the bulkier **Thr**.

### Conclusion:
The anti-nutritional compound is likely produced by the gene's protein product. To eliminate the compound, the gene must be rendered nonfunctional. Among the mutants, **Mutant 4** introduces the most significant changes early in the protein sequence, particularly the replacement of **Gly** with **Thr**, which could disrupt the protein's structure and function. This makes **Mutant 4** the most likely to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.
