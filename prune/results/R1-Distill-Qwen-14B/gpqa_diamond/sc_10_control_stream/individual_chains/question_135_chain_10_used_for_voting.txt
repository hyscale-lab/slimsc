Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the decay of a boson. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question gives the Lagrangian interaction between a bosonic field X and some fermions. The mass of X is 6 GeV, and I need to find the kinematically allowed decays at the lowest order.

Alright, first, I remember that when a particle decays, the energy and momentum must be conserved. But in particle physics, there's also the concept of the center-of-mass energy. For a boson to decay into two particles, say a fermion-antifermion pair, the mass of the boson must be at least twice the mass of the fermion, right? Because each fermion would need to have some energy, but the minimum is when they are produced at rest, so each has mass m, so 2m needs to be less than or equal to the boson's mass.

Wait, wait, but wait. The boson's mass here is 6 GeV. So I need to figure out which fermions have a mass less than or equal to 3 GeV, because 6 GeV divided by 2 is 3 GeV. But wait, wait. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because each fermion would have mass m, and the total rest mass is 2m, so if the boson's mass is M, then M must be ≥ 2m. So for a fermion of mass m, M has to be ≥ 2m.

But wait, let me think again. Let's take an example. Like, the Z boson has a mass around 91 GeV. It can decay into any fermion pair as long as their combined rest mass is less than 91 GeV. But in reality, the Z can decay into b quarks, but their mass is about 5 GeV, so 2*5 is 10, which is less than 91. So yeah, that makes sense.

So for this X boson at 6 GeV, I need to find all fermions where 2m_fermion ≤ 6 GeV. So m_fermion ≤ 3 GeV.

Now, let's think about the masses of the known fermions. I'll list them:

- Electron (e-): mass ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ-): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ-): ~1.777 GeV
- Up quark (u): ~0.0035 GeV
- Down quark (d): ~0.0045 GeV
- Strange quark (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm quark (c): ~1.5 GeV
- Bottom quark (b): ~4.5 GeV
- Top quark (t): way too heavy, like 173 GeV.

Wait, but wait, the tau is about 1.777 GeV, so 2*tau is about 3.55 GeV. Oh, wait, 3.55 is more than 3, which would mean that 6 GeV is 3 GeV per fermion. So 2*tau is 3.55, which is more than 6 GeV? No, wait, wait. Wait, X is 6 GeV, so 2m_fermion has to be less than or equal to 6 GeV. So m_fermion <= 3 GeV.

So let's check each fermion:

- Electron: 0.0005 GeV → 2m=0.001 <6 → allowed
- Muon: 0.105 → 0.21 <6 → allowed
- Tau: 1.777 → 3.554. 3.554 is less than 6? No, wait 3.554 is less than 6 GeV. Wait, 3.554 is less than 6, so 2m is 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6. So tau can be produced. Wait, wait, no, wait. Let me recheck. For X to decay into τ+ τ-, each τ has a mass of about 1.777 GeV, so 2 *1.777 ≈ 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So yes, allowed.

Wait, wait, but what about the W boson? Wait, no, the W is a different case. But this is about X.

So which fermions can X decay into?

Looking at the quarks:

u quark: mass ~0.0035 GeV → 2u =0.007 <6 → allowed
d quark: ~0.0045 → 0.009 <6 → allowed
s quark: ~0.095 → 0.19 <6 → allowed
c quark: ~1.5 GeV → 3 GeV. So 2c=3 GeV ≤6 → allowed
b quark: ~4.5 GeV → 2b=9 GeV >6 → not allowed
t quark: way too heavy, so no.
Same for muon and tau leptons: allowed because 2m is ≤6.

Wait, for the tau, 2m is 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

So, the possible fermion pairs would be:

e+ e-
mu+ mu-
tau+ tau-
u u-bar
d d-bar
s s-bar
c c-bar

Because the charm quark's mass is about 1.5 GeV, so 2m=3 GeV, which is ≤6 GeV. So X can decay into c c-bar.

But wait, wait. I thought that the bottom quark's mass is around 4.5 GeV. So 2m_b would be 9 GeV, which is more than X's 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b-bar. So any option that includes b b-bar is not allowed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau, e+ e-
But since X's mass is 6 GeV, can it decay into b b-bar? 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So no. So option A would have an impossible decay channel.

Option B: includes c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau, mu, e. So that's allowed, as all the fermions have 2m ≤6 GeV.

Option C: includes c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, tau, mu, e. But t quark's mass is 173 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV, so impossible. So option C is wrong.

Option D: includes b b-bar, which is impossible as we discussed. So D is out.

So the correct option must be B, because it includes all the allowed fermions.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the fermion masses to make sure I'm not making a mistake.

Electron: 0.0005 GeV → 0.001 GeV for 2m → allowed.
Muon: ~0.105 GeV → 0.21 GeV → allowed.
Tau: ~1.777 GeV → 3.554 GeV → allowed.
u quark: ~0.0035 → 0.007 → allowed.
d quark: ~0.0045 → 0.009 → allowed.
s quark: ~0.095 → 0.19 → allowed.
c quark: ~1.5 → 3 GeV → allowed.
b quark: ~4.5 → 9 GeV → not allowed.
t: 173 GeV → not allowed.

So the allowed fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So the possible decay channels are X→ e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar.

Looking at the options:

Option B: X → c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau+ tau-, mu+ mu-, e+ e-.

Yes, that matches.

Option C includes t quarks, which is impossible. So the correct answer is B.

To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the interaction Lagrangian provided and apply the conservation of energy and mass constraints. For a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the total rest mass of the pair must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq M_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion and \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This implies \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Decay Channels
The masses of known fermions are as follows:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Muon (\( \mu \)): \( \sim 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Tau (\( \tau \)): \( \sim 1.777 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( \sim 0.0035 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( \sim 0.0045 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( \sim 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( \sim 1.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( \sim 4.5 \, \text{GeV} \)
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( \sim 173 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these, the fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are:
- \( e, \mu, \tau, u, d, s, c \).

Thus, the allowed decay channels are:
\[
X \rightarrow e^+ e^-, \, \mu^+ \mu^-, \, \tau^+ \tau^-, \, u \bar{u}, \, d \bar{d}, \, s \bar{s}, \, c \bar{c}.
\]

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed because \( 2m_b = 9 \, \text{GeV} > 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \) at the lowest order.

Same for muon and tau leptons: allowed because 2m is ≤6.

Wait, for the tau, 2m is 3.554 GeV, which is less than 6 GeV. So X can decay into tau+ tau-.

So, the possible fermion pairs would be:

e+ e-
mu+ mu-
tau+ tau-
u u-bar
d d-bar
s s-bar
c c-bar

Because the charm quark's mass is about 1.5 GeV, so 2m=3 GeV, which is ≤6 GeV. So X can decay into c c-bar.

But wait, wait. I thought that the bottom quark's mass is around 4.5 GeV. So 2m_b would be 9 GeV, which is more than X's 6 GeV. So X cannot decay into b b-bar. So any option that includes b b-bar is not allowed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: includes b b-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau, e+ e-
But since X's mass is 6 GeV, can it decay into b b-bar? 2m_b is 9 GeV, which is more than 6 GeV. So no. So option A would have an impossible decay channel.

Option B: includes c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, tau, mu, e. So that's allowed, as all the fermions have 2m ≤6 GeV.

Option C: includes c c-bar, s s-bar, u u-bar, d d-bar, t t-bar, tau, mu, e. But t quark's mass is 173 GeV, which is way more than 6 GeV, so impossible. So option C is wrong.

Option D: includes b b-bar, which is impossible as we discussed. So D is out.

So the correct option must be B, because it includes all the allowed fermions.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the fermion masses to make sure I'm not making a mistake.

Electron: 0.0005 GeV → 0.001 GeV for 2m → allowed.
Muon: ~0.105 GeV → 0.21 GeV → allowed.
Tau: ~1.777 GeV → 3.554 GeV → allowed.
u quark: ~0.0035 → 0.007 → allowed.

c quark: ~1.5 → 3 GeV → allowed.
b quark: ~4.5 → 9 GeV → not allowed.
t: 173 GeV → not allowed.

So the allowed fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

So the possible decay channels are X→ e+ e-, mu+ mu-, tau+ tau-, u u-bar, d d-bar, s s-bar, c c-bar.

Looking at the options:

To determine the kinematically allowed decays of the boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV, we analyze the interaction Lagrangian provided and apply the conservation of energy and mass constraints. For a boson to decay into a fermion-antifermion pair, the total rest mass of the pair must satisfy \( 2m_f \leq M_X \), where \( m_f \) is the mass of the fermion and \( M_X = 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This implies \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Fermion Masses and Decay Channels
The masses of known fermions are as follows:
- Electron (\( e \)): \( \sim 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \)

From these, the fermions with \( m_f \leq 3 \, \text{GeV} \) are:

- **Option B**: Includes \( c \bar{c}, s \bar{s}, u \bar{u}, d \bar{d}, \tau^+ \tau^-, \mu^+ \mu^-, e^+ e^- \), all of which are allowed. Correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t \bar{t} \), which is not allowed because \( m_t \gg 6 \, \text{GeV} \). Incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b \bar{b} \), which is not allowed. Incorrect.

### Conclusion
The correct answer is **Option B**, as it lists all kinematically allowed decay channels for the boson \( X \) at the lowest order.
