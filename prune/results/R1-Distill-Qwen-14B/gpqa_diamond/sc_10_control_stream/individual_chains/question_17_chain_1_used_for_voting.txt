Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution where there's a stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. The concentration of the complex is given as 0.02 M, and the temperature is 25°C. The formation constant, K for the Ca-EDTA complex, is 5x10^10. The options are A to D.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA is a chelating agent, meaning it binds to metal ions like calcium. The reaction forms a complex, and the formation constant (K) tells us how strong this complex is. A higher K means the complex is more stable, so less calcium ions would be free in solution.

Wait, the problem says it's a stoichiometric solution of the Ca-EDTA complex. That probably means that the concentration of each component before they form the complex is the same. So, when they form the complex, each mole of Ca²+ reacts with one mole of EDTA^4- to form the complex.

So, the reaction is: Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^(2-). The formation constant K is given by [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10.

Since the complex is 0.02 M, let's think about the initial concentrations. Initially, before any complex formation, the concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would each be 0.02 M? Or wait, no, because they form the complex. Oh wait, no. Wait, in the solution, the complex is present, so the total concentration of Ca in solution is all tied up in the complex? Or no, because the complex dissociates a bit.

Wait, no. The solution contains the complex, so the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and because it's a 1:1 ratio, the initial concentrations of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would each be zero before the complex forms? No, that can't be right. Maybe I should think in terms of the dissociation of the complex.

Wait, perhaps the complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. The formation constant is large, so the complex doesn't dissociate much. So the concentration of free Ca²+ and EDTA^4- would be very low.

So, let's model this. Let's let the concentration of the complex be C, which is 0.02 M. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ that comes from the dissociation of the complex. Since the reaction is 1:1, the concentration of EDTA^4- would also be x. So, [Ca²+] = x and [EDTA^4-] = x.

The formation constant K is [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]) = 5e10. Rearranging, [CaEDTA] = K * [Ca²+][EDTA^4-].

But wait, the total concentration is [CaEDTA] + [Ca²+] + [EDTA^4-]. Wait, no. Because the solution was initially just the complex. So the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, so [CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x. Because each x is the amount dissociated.

Hmm, but since K is very large (5e10 is a big number), the dissociation x would be very small. So 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So, [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02 M.

So now, K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-}) = (0.02)/(x^2) = 5e10.

So solving for x: 0.02 / (x^2) = 5e10 → x^2 = 0.02 / (5e10) → x^2 = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → x=2e-6.5? Wait, wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? Let me compute 4e-13's square root.

Wait, 4e-13 is 4×10^-13. The square root is sqrt(4)=2, sqrt(1e-13)=1e-6.5, since (1e-6.5)^2 = 1e-13. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5. Wait, 10^-6.5 is 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7 M.

Wait, so x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. Which is the concentration of Ca²+ ions.

Looking at the options, option C is 6.3e-7, which matches this calculation.

Let me double-check the steps. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA. Since K is large, the dissociation is minimal, so [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02. Then, setting up the equation K = (0.02)/(x^2) → x^2 = 0.02/(5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. Square root is 2e-6.5, which is 6.3e-7. Yes, that's correct.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing a 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we start by considering the dissociation of the complex:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is given as \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the total concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let \( x \) represent the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) ions that dissociate from the complex. Since the dissociation is small (due to the large \( K \)), the concentration of the complex remains approximately 0.02 M.

The formation constant expression is:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting \([CaEDTA^{2-}] \approx 0.02\) and \([\text{Ca}^{2+}] = [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x\), we get:

\[
K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}}} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which matches option C.
