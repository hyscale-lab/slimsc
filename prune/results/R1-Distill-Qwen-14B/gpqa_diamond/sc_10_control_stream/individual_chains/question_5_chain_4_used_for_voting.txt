Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of an operator. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

The problem states that the operator is P, and I'm supposed to find its eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The direction is arbitrary, lying in the x-z plane. Oh wait, wait. Actually, I think the operator is along a direction n in the x-z plane, so the operator is probably P = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

But wait, the question says the eigenvector is for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So P is a vector operator with components given, and the operator acting along n would be the sum P·n.

Wait, but the problem gives me the components P_x, P_y, P_z as 2x2 matrices. So I need to construct the operator P along n, which is in x-z plane. Let me think. The direction vector n is in x-z, so n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because in x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

So operator P would be P = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. Because the Y-component of n is zero, so P_y multiplied by zero is zero. So I don't have to worry about P_y.

Now, I need to find the eigenvector of this operator P. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Since the operator is a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvector will be a two-component vector.

Wait, but the given components P_x, P_y, P_z are each (ħ/2) times their respective matrices.

Let me write down each component:

P_x = ħ/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_z = ħ/2 * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Since P_y doesn't contribute, the operator P is (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Wait, let me compute that matrix. Let me factor out ħ/2. So P is (ħ/2) times:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Because:

First row: cosθ (from P_z) and sinθ (from P_x).

Second row: sinθ (from P_x) and -cosθ (from P_z).

So the matrix is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

And this is multiplied by ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is: P |v> = (ħ/2) λ |v>, where λ is the eigenvalue of the matrix part. Wait, no, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So:

P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

So,

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

We can divide both sides by ħ/2, so the matrix equation becomes:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] |v> = |v>

So the matrix M is:

M = [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
       [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

We need to find the eigenvectors of M with eigenvalue 1, since M|v> = 1 * |v>.

Wait, wait. No, because the eigenvalue equation is M |v> = (λ) |v>, and in this case, the eigenvalue is 1 (since the equation after division is M |v> = |v>). So λ = 1.

So, to find the eigenvectors of M for λ=1.

The general approach is to solve (M - λ I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So, M - I is:

[ [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ - 1 ] ]

This gives the system:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Where a and b are the components of the eigenvector.

We can write these two equations:

1) (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

2) sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Since it's a homogeneous system, we can find a non-trivial solution by setting one of the variables in terms of the other.

Let me take equation 1:

(sinθ) b = (1 - cosθ) a

So, b = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] a

Using the trigonometric identity 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so:

b = [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] a

Simplify: b = [ sin(θ/2) / cos(θ/2) ) ] a = tan(θ/2) a

So, the ratio of b to a is tan(θ/2). So the eigenvector can be written as (a, b) = a (1, tan(θ/2) )

Let me set a = 1, then b = tan(θ/2). So the eigenvector is (1, tan(θ/2) ).

But we need to normalize it. The norm is sqrt(1 + tan²(θ/2)) ) = sqrt( (cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2)) / cos²(θ/2) ) ) = 1 / cos(θ/2) )

So the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ) because:

(1, tan(θ/2)) divided by 1/cos(θ/2) would be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

Wait, let me see.

Wait, (1, tan(θ/2)) = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] multiplied by 1 / cos(θ/2). Because:

cos(θ/2) * cos(θ/2) = cos²(theta/2), but wait, let me think.

Actually, (1, tan(theta/2)) = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] because:

tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2). So, if I write (1, sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2)) = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] / cos(theta/2).

So when normalized, we have to divide by 1 / cos(theta/2), because the original vector (1, tan(theta/2)) has a magnitude of 1 / cos(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait: if the original vector is (1, tan(theta/2)), then the norm squared is 1 + tan^2(theta/2) = sec^2(theta/2), so the norm is 1 / cos(theta/2). So the normalized vector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but wait, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So that's the first possibility.

Wait, but wait, I should check whether this is correct. The matrix M is built from the components, and I have found its eigenvector for eigenvalue 1.

Wait, but the actual operator is P = (ħ/2) M, so the eigenvalue for P is (ħ/2) * 1 = ħ/2, which matches the given eigenvalue. So this seems correct.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which doesn't match.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), without any phase factor.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) hbar and sqrt(1/3) hbar factors, cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2) respectively.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the options have the elements of the normalized eigenvector. But the eigenvector I found is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). But wait, in quantum mechanics, the components are often expressed as spinors, which may include phase factors, but in this case, the eigenvector doesn't have any phase because the components are real.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the eigenvector is for an arbitrary direction n, which is in the x-z plane. So the angle is theta, measured from the z-axis.

Wait, but in the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which would make sense if the state is in the eigenstate of S_z or something similar, but in this case, our state is the eigenstate of P along n, which is a combination of P_x and P_z. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the operator P along n is S · n, where S is the spin operator. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstates of S · n are spin-up and spin-down along n. The eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvectors are |+n> = cos(theta/2) |+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) | -z> ?

Wait, no. Wait, the general expression for the spin-up state along n is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)), assuming n is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero because n is in the x-z plane (y=0). So phi would be zero, so the spinor becomes (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Which matches option C.

But wait, the operator P is given as the components P_x, P_y, P_z, each scaled by ħ/2. So P is analogous to the spin operator S, scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, S · n would have eigenvalues ± ħ/2, so the eigenvectors are the same as for spin-up and spin-down along n.

So the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)). But in our case, since n is in x-z plane, phi is zero. So the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

Wait, but wait, the given options don't have that. Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), and that's exactly what I've found.

So why are the other options present? Let's check.

Option A has sqrt(2/3) hbar and sqrt(1/3) hbar. That doesn't seem to relate to our theta.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is the spherical harmonics for l=1, m=0, but that's for angular momentum, not spin-1/2, I think.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) hbar times cos(theta/2), and sqrt(1/3) hbar times sin(theta/2). That would be the case if the eigenvector was a specific combination, perhaps for a particular theta.

Wait, but the problem asks for the eigenvector in terms of theta, which is part of the arbitrary direction n. So option C is the general expression, whereas options A and D are specific.

Wait, but the problem states that the direction is arbitrary. So the correct answer must be in terms of theta and phi, but since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero.

So the correct eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which is option C.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options again:

Option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Yes, that's our result.

So the answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $2 \times 2$ matrices scaled by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be represented as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is therefore:

\[
\vec{P} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta.
\]

Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, we find:

\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, the operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle,
\]

where $|v\rangle$ is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, we focus on solving:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This simplifies to the system of equations:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \quad \sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0.
\]

From the first equation, we find the ratio:

\[
b = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) a.
\]

Substituting this into the second equation confirms consistency. The eigenvector can therefore be written as:

\[
|v\rangle = a \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the magnitude:

\[
\| |v\rangle \| = \sqrt{1 + \tan^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} = \frac{1}{\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}.
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option C, which is written as:

\[
\left(\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right).
\]

The other options are inconsistent with the derived result. For example:

- **Option A** introduces $\sqrt{2/3}\hbar$ and $\sqrt{1/3}\hbar$, which are not related to the general expression for the eigenvector.
- **Option B** includes $\cos\theta$ and $\sin\theta$, which correspond to a different angular parameterization.
- **Option D** introduces additional scaling factors and does not match the normalized eigenvector derived here.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about finding the eigenvector of an operator. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

The problem states that the operator is P, and I'm supposed to find its eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. The direction is arbitrary, lying in the x-z plane. Oh wait, wait. Actually, I think the operator is along a direction n in the x-z plane, so the operator is probably P = P_x n_x + P_y n_y + P_z n_z.

But wait, the question says the eigenvector is for the operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. So P is a vector operator with components given, and the operator acting along n would be the sum P·n.

Wait, but the problem gives me the components P_x, P_y, P_z as 2x2 matrices. So I need to construct the operator P along n, which is in x-z plane. Let me think. The direction vector n is in x-z, so n can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because in x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

So operator P would be P = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ. Because the Y-component of n is zero, so P_y multiplied by zero is zero. So I don't have to worry about P_y.

Now, I need to find the eigenvector of this operator P. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. Since the operator is a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvector will be a two-component vector.

Wait, but the given components P_x, P_y, P_z are each (ħ/2) times their respective matrices.

Let me write down each component:

P_x = ħ/2 * [[0,1],[1,0]]
P_z = ħ/2 * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Since P_y doesn't contribute, the operator P is (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Wait, let me compute that matrix. Let me factor out ħ/2. So P is (ħ/2) times:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Because:

First row: cosθ (from P_z) and sinθ (from P_x).

Second row: sinθ (from P_x) and -cosθ (from P_z).

So the matrix is:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

And this is multiplied by ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is: P |v> = (ħ/2) λ |v>, where λ is the eigenvalue of the matrix part. Wait, no, the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So:

P |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>

So,

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

We can divide both sides by ħ/2, so the matrix equation becomes:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] |v> = |v>

So the matrix M is:

M = [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
       [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

We need to find the eigenvectors of M with eigenvalue 1, since M|v> = 1 * |v>.

Wait, wait. No, because the eigenvalue equation is M |v> = (λ) |v>, and in this case, the eigenvalue is 1 (since the equation after division is M |v> = |v>). So λ = 1.

So, to find the eigenvectors of M for λ=1.

The general approach is to solve (M - λ I) |v> = 0, where I is the identity matrix.

So, M - I is:

[ [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ - 1 ] ]

This gives the system:

(cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Where a and b are the components of the eigenvector.

We can write these two equations:

1) (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b = 0

2) sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b = 0

Since it's a homogeneous system, we can find a non-trivial solution by setting one of the variables in terms of the other.

Let me take equation 1:

(sinθ) b = (1 - cosθ) a

So, b = [ (1 - cosθ) / sinθ ] a

Using the trigonometric identity 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(θ/2), and sinθ = 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2), so:

b = [ 2 sin²(θ/2) ] / [ 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2) ) ] a

Simplify: b = [ sin(θ/2) / cos(θ/2) ) ] a = tan(θ/2) a

So, the ratio of b to a is tan(θ/2). So the eigenvector can be written as (a, b) = a (1, tan(θ/2) )

Let me set a = 1, then b = tan(θ/2). So the eigenvector is (1, tan(θ/2) ).

But we need to normalize it. The norm is sqrt(1 + tan²(θ/2)) ) = sqrt( (cos²(θ/2) + sin²(θ/2)) / cos²(θ/2) ) ) = 1 / cos(θ/2) )

So the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ) because:

(1, tan(θ/2)) divided by 1/cos(θ/2) would be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]

Wait, let me see.

Wait, (1, tan(θ/2)) = [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ] multiplied by 1 / cos(θ/2). Because:

cos(θ/2) * cos(θ/2) = cos²(theta/2), but wait, let me think.

Actually, (1, tan(theta/2)) = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] because:

tan(theta/2) = sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2). So, if I write (1, sin(theta/2)/cos(theta/2)) = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ] / cos(theta/2).

So when normalized, we have to divide by 1 / cos(theta/2), because the original vector (1, tan(theta/2)) has a magnitude of 1 / cos(theta/2).

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Wait, but wait: if the original vector is (1, tan(theta/2)), then the norm squared is 1 + tan^2(theta/2) = sec^2(theta/2), so the norm is 1 / cos(theta/2). So the normalized vector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), but wait, option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). So that's the first possibility.

Wait, but wait, I should check whether this is correct. The matrix M is built from the components, and I have found its eigenvector for eigenvalue 1.

Wait, but the actual operator is P = (ħ/2) M, so the eigenvalue for P is (ħ/2) * 1 = ħ/2, which matches the given eigenvalue. So this seems correct.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which doesn't match.

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), without any phase factor.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) hbar and sqrt(1/3) hbar factors, cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2) respectively.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the options have the elements of the normalized eigenvector. But the eigenvector I found is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)). But wait, in quantum mechanics, the components are often expressed as spinors, which may include phase factors, but in this case, the eigenvector doesn't have any phase because the components are real.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the eigenvector is for an arbitrary direction n, which is in the x-z plane. So the angle is theta, measured from the z-axis.

Wait, but in the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which would make sense if the state is in the eigenstate of S_z or something similar, but in this case, our state is the eigenstate of P along n, which is a combination of P_x and P_z. Hmm.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the operator P along n is S · n, where S is the spin operator. For a spin-1/2 particle, the eigenstates of S · n are spin-up and spin-down along n. The eigenvalues are ± ħ/2.

So the eigenvectors are |+n> = cos(theta/2) |+z> + e^{i phi} sin(theta/2) | -z> ?

Wait, no. Wait, the general expression for the spin-up state along n is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)), assuming n is in the x-z plane, so phi is zero because n is in the x-z plane (y=0). So phi would be zero, so the spinor becomes (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Which matches option C.

But wait, the operator P is given as the components P_x, P_y, P_z, each scaled by ħ/2. So P is analogous to the spin operator S, scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, S · n would have eigenvalues ± ħ/2, so the eigenvectors are the same as for spin-up and spin-down along n.

So the eigenvector for eigenvalue +ħ/2 is (cos(theta/2), e^{i phi} sin(theta/2)). But in our case, since n is in x-z plane, phi is zero. So the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which is option C.

Wait, but wait, the given options don't have that. Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), and that's exactly what I've found.

So why are the other options present? Let's check.

Option A has sqrt(2/3) hbar and sqrt(1/3) hbar. That doesn't seem to relate to our theta.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)), which is the spherical harmonics for l=1, m=0, but that's for angular momentum, not spin-1/2, I think.

Option D has sqrt(2/3) hbar times cos(theta/2), and sqrt(1/3) hbar times sin(theta/2). That would be the case if the eigenvector was a specific combination, perhaps for a particular theta.

Wait, but the problem asks for the eigenvector in terms of theta, which is part of the arbitrary direction n. So option C is the general expression, whereas options A and D are specific.

Wait, but the problem states that the direction is arbitrary. So the correct answer must be in terms of theta and phi, but since the direction is in the x-z plane, phi is zero.

So the correct eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), which is option C.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options again:

Option C is written as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Yes, that's our result.

So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ for a muon along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ lying in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as $2 \times 2$ matrices scaled by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be represented as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis. The operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ is therefore:

\[
\vec{P} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta.
\]

Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, we find:

\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, the operator $\vec{P}$ along $\vec{n}$ becomes:

\[
\vec{P} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle,
\]

where $|v\rangle$ is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. Dividing through by $\hbar/2$, we focus on solving:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This simplifies to the system of equations:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \quad \sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0.
\]

From the first equation, we find the ratio:

\[
b = \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) a.
\]

Substituting this into the second equation confirms consistency. The eigenvector can therefore be written as:

\[
|v\rangle = a \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ \tan\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we compute the magnitude:

\[
\| |v\rangle \| = \sqrt{1 + \tan^2\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} = \frac{1}{\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}.
\]

Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \\ \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option C, which is written as:

\[
\left(\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right), \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right).
\]

The other options are inconsistent with the derived result. For example:

- **Option A** introduces $\sqrt{2/3}\hbar$ and $\sqrt{1/3}\hbar$, which are not related to the general expression for the eigenvector.
- **Option B** includes $\cos\theta$ and $\sin\theta$, which correspond to a different angular parameterization.
- **Option D** introduces additional scaling factors and does not match the normalized eigenvector derived here.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
