Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, proportional means we might need to normalize it later, right? Because the state should have a magnitude squared of 1.

First, the electron is in this state, and we need to find the probabilities of measuring it in the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator's matrix is given by Aij. Oh, right, the matrix elements: Aij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so what kind of matrix is that?

Well, for a 2x2 matrix (since we have |up> and |down> as eigenstates), the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix looks like:
[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Wait, that looks familiar. That's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. The Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. The X matrix is [0 1; 1 0], so yes, this operator A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

So the operator A is proportional to sigma_x. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of the operator A as well. Because sigma_x has eigenstates that are superpositions of |up> and |down>, right?

The eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. So since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the eigenstates will be the same, and the eigenvalues will be (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1).

Wait, no, actually, since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the eigenvalues are (hbar/2)*1 and -(hbar/2). So when we measure the operator A, the possible outcomes are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

But wait, the question is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of A. So we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, because the probabilities are the square of the coefficients in that expansion.

So first, I need to write |alpha> as a linear combination of the eigenstates of A.

But wait, |alpha> is given in terms of |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of sigma_z, not sigma_x. So I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in the basis of the eigenstates of A (which are the sigma_x eigenstates).

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the eigenstates of A first.

Let me denote the eigenstates of A as |+> and |->, where:
|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, any state can be expressed in terms of |+> and |->. Let's do that for |alpha>.

Wait, the given |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me write it as:

|alpha> = c [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ]

But we need to find the normalization constant c. The state must satisfy <alpha|alpha> = 1.

So let's compute the inner product:

c^2 [ (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) ] = 1.

Calculating each term:

(1+i)(1-i) = 1 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

(2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5.

So sum is 2 +5=7. So c^2 *7=1 → c=1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Now, express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

Let me expand |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

We have:
|alpha> = a |+> + b |->.

Expressing |+> and |-> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So,

|alpha> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Grouping terms:

= [a + b]/sqrt(2) |up> + [a - b]/sqrt(2) |down>.

But from our |alpha> expression, the coefficients are (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2 -i)/sqrt(7) for |up> and |down> respectively.

So equate the coefficients:

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)
( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Let me write these as two equations:

Equation 1: (a + b) = [ (1+i) sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)
Equation 2: (a - b) = [ (2 - i) sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)

Let me solve for a and b.

Add equation 1 and equation 2:

2a = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ (3 ) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So a = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Wait, let me compute the numerator:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 3.

So 2a = (3) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ a = (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ ( -1 + 2i ) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So b = ( (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ) / (2 sqrt(7) )

Hmm, so a and b are complex numbers. But when computing probabilities, the squared magnitudes will matter.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the coefficients a and b.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate of A, because the probability is the square of the absolute value of that inner product.

That might be a better approach. Let me try that.

The eigenstates of A are |+> and |-> as defined before.

Compute < + | alpha > and < - | alpha >.

So, let's compute:

< + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)) multiplied by the vector (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) )

Wait, no. Wait, |+> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so the bra vector < + | is ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2).

So,

< + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1-i) (1+i) + (2+i)(2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

< + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 - i) (1 + i) + (2 + i) (2 - i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, no, let's think about it. The inner product:

< + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ ( <up| + <down| ) ( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) ] / sqrt(7)

The |alpha> is multiplied by 1/sqrt(7), so:

= (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(7)) [ <up| (1+i)|up> + <up| (2-i)|down> + <down| (1+i)|up> + <down| (2-i)|down> ]

But <up| up> is 1, <up| down> is 0, same for other cross terms. Wait, no, actually, when you take <up| down>, it's zero.

So:

= [ (1/sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) ) ] * [ (1+i)*1 + (2 -i)*0 + 0 + (2 -i)*1 ] ?

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me compute it more correctly.

The inner product is:

< + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 - i) * (1 + i) + (2 + i) * (2 - i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, because:

< + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ ( <up| + <down| ) * ( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) ] * (1/sqrt(7))

So expanding this, the terms are:

<up| (1+i)|up> → (1+i) * 1
<up| (2-i)|down> → 0
<down| (1+i)|up> → 0
<down| (2-i)|down> → (2 -i)*1

So sum is (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3.

So < + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) * (3) / sqrt(7) ) = 3 / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, compute < - | alpha >.

|-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), so the inner product is:

< - | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| (1+i)|up> - <up| (2 -i)|down> - <down| (1+i)|up> + <down| (2 -i)|down> ] * (1/sqrt(7))

Again, cross terms are zero.

So it becomes (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 +i) *1 + (2 -i) *1 ] * (1/sqrt(7)) ?

Wait, no, let's compute it properly.

< - | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ ( <up| - <down| ) ( (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) ] * (1/sqrt(7))

Expanding:

<up| (1+i)|up> → (1+i) *1
<up| (2 -i)|down> → 0
- <down| (1+i)|up> → 0
<down| (2 -i)|down> → (2 -i)*1

Wait, no, I think I messed that up. Let me do it step by step.

The product is:

[ (1/sqrt(2)) (1/sqrt(7)) ] * [ <up| (1+i)|up> + <up| (2 -i)|down> - <down| (1+i)|up> - <down| (2 -i)|down> ]

Which simplifies to:

[1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7)))] [ (1+i) + 0 - 0 + (2 -i) * (-1) ]

Wait, wait. Let's compute each term:

Term 1: <up| (1+i)|up> = (1+i) *1 = 1+i
Term 2: <up| (2-i)|down> = 0
Term 3: - <down| (1+i)|up> = 0
Term 4: - <down| (2-i)|down> = -(2 -i) *1

So sum is (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1 + i -2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)

So < - | alpha > = [ (-1 + 2i) ] / ( sqrt(2) sqrt(7) )

So the inner products are:

c_+ = 3 / (sqrt(14))
c_- = (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(14))

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2:

= (3)^2 / (14) ) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64. Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which adds to 1. So that's a possibility.

Compute |c_-|^2:

| (-1 + 2i) |^2 = (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So 5 /14 ≈ 0.3571428.

Wait, but 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

So that would match option A.

But wait, let's make sure. Let me compute each part again.

Wait, for < + | alpha >, I had 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) → 3/sqrt(14). The square is 9/14 ≈0.6428, which is 0.64 when rounded. Similarly, the other probability is 5/14≈0.357, which rounds to 0.36. So options A says 0.64 and 0.36.

But wait, looking at the operator A's average value.

The average value is given by <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, and |alpha> is a state, perhaps we can compute this expectation value.

Alternatively, since A has eigenvalues ± hbar/2, the average is |c_+|^2 * (hbar/2) + |c_-|^2 * (-hbar/2) )

Wait, no. Because |+> and |-> are the eigenstates of A. So:

If |+> has eigenvalue hbar/(2), and |-> has -hbar/(2), then the expectation value is c_+^2*(hbar/2) + c_-^2*(-hbar/2).

Wait, but wait, no. Because |c_+|^2 is the probability of measuring +hbar/2, and |c_-|^2 is the probability of measuring -hbar/2.

So <A> = (|c_+|^2)(hbar/2) + (|c_-|^2)(-hbar/2) )

We have |c_+|^2 =9/14, |c_-|^2=5/14.

So:

= (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2)
= [ (9 -5) /14 ] * (hbar/2)
= (4/14) (hbar/2)
= (2/7) (hbar/2)
= hbar/7.

Wait, that's option A's average value, which says hbar/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.36, and the average is hbar/7, which matches option A.

But wait, let me double-check the average value. Another approach is to compute <A> using the given state |alpha>.

Since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, and sigma_x has matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], the expectation value is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x.

So <sigma_x> = [alpha | sigma_x | alpha ]

Let's compute <alpha | sigma_x | alpha >.

Sigma_x in the |up>, |down> basis is [[0,1],[1,0]]

So compute the inner product:

<alpha | sigma_x | alpha> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

First, multiply the matrix with the vector:

sigma_x |alpha> = [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, the inner product is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (2-i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

Which is:

(1-i)(2 -i) / 7 + (2+i)(1+i) /7

Compute each term:

(1-i)(2 -i) = 2(1) + (1)(-i) -i(2) + i^2
= 2 -i - 2i -1
= (2 -1) + (-3i)
=1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) =2*1 +2i +i*1 +i^2
=2 +3i -1
=1 +3i.

Now sum: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) =2.

So the inner product is 2/7.

Therefore, <sigma_x> =2/7.

So <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

Which matches what we found earlier.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says probabilities 0.64, 0.36 and average hbar/7.

Wait, but the options don't say 9/14 and 5/14, but the question says "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator..."

Wait, perhaps the eigenstates are |+> and |->, so the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Rounded, they are 0.64 and 0.36, which is option A.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 0.61, 0.29. No, 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, so 0.64 is correct. So the correct answer must be option A.

Wait, but looking at the problem statement again: the state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + ... Oh, right, we normalized it and found c=1/sqrt(7). So all our calculations should be correct.

So the answer should be option A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average hbar/7.

The problem involves an electron in the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The goal is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be determined.

### Key Steps:
1. **Normalization of \( |\alpha\rangle \):**
   The given state is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the inner product:
   \[
   \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{7} \left[ (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) \right] = \frac{1}{7} \left[ 2 + 5 \right] = 1.
   \]
   Thus, the normalized state is:
   \[
   |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right].
   \]

2. **Eigenstates of \( A \):**
   The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
   \[
   A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix},
   \]
   which corresponds to \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are:
   \[
   |+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right),
   \]
   with eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

3. **Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \):**
   Expand \( |\alpha\rangle \) as:
   \[
   |\alpha\rangle = c_+ |+\rangle + c_- |-\rangle.
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), equate coefficients to match the terms in \( |\alpha\rangle \). After solving, the coefficients are:
   \[
   c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
   \]

4. **Probabilities of measuring \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \):**
   The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \):
   \[
   P(+\rangle) = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-\rangle) = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
   \]

5. **Average value of \( A \):**
   The average value of \( A \) is:
   \[
   \langle A \rangle = P(+\rangle) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-\rangle) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
   \]
   Substituting the probabilities:
   \[
   \langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} - \frac{5}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of \( A \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These results match **Option A**.

ANSWER: A

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but let's see.

The problem says that the state |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. Wait, proportional means we might need to normalize it later, right? Because the state should have a magnitude squared of 1.

First, the electron is in this state, and we need to find the probabilities of measuring it in the eigenstates of a certain operator. The operator's matrix is given by Aij. Oh, right, the matrix elements: Aij is hbar/2 if i ≠ j, and 0 otherwise. Hmm, so what kind of matrix is that?

Well, for a 2x2 matrix (since we have |up> and |down> as eigenstates), the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal elements are hbar/2. So the matrix looks like:
[ 0, hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2, 0 ]

Wait, that looks familiar. That's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by hbar/2. The Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. The X matrix is [0 1; 1 0], so yes, this operator A is (hbar/2) * sigma_x.

So the operator A is proportional to sigma_x. The eigenstates of sigma_x are the eigenstates of the operator A as well. Because sigma_x has eigenstates that are superpositions of |up> and |down>, right?

The eigenstates of sigma_x are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), with eigenvalues +1 and -1 respectively. So since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the eigenstates will be the same, and the eigenvalues will be (hbar/2)(+1) and (hbar/2)(-1).

Wait, no, actually, since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, the eigenvalues are (hbar/2)*1 and -(hbar/2). So when we measure the operator A, the possible outcomes are hbar/2 and -hbar/2.

But wait, the question is asking for the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of A. So we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, because the probabilities are the square of the coefficients in that expansion.

So first, I need to write |alpha> as a linear combination of the eigenstates of A.

But wait, |alpha> is given in terms of |up> and |down>, which are eigenstates of sigma_z, not sigma_x. So I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in the basis of the eigenstates of A (which are the sigma_x eigenstates).

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the eigenstates of A first.

Let me denote the eigenstates of A as |+> and |->, where:
|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So, any state can be expressed in terms of |+> and |->. Let's do that for |alpha>.

Wait, the given |alpha> is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>. Let me write it as:

|alpha> = c [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ]

But we need to find the normalization constant c. The state must satisfy <alpha|alpha> = 1.

So let's compute the inner product:

c^2 [ (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) ] = 1.

Calculating each term:

(1+i)(1-i) = 1 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.

(2 - i)(2 + i) = 4 - (i)^2 = 4 - (-1) = 5.

So sum is 2 +5=7. So c^2 *7=1 → c=1/sqrt(7).

So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ].

Now, express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

Let me expand |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

We have:
|alpha> = a |+> + b |->.

Expressing |+> and |-> in terms of |up> and |down>:

|+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2)
|-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

So,

|alpha> = a (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) + b (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)

Grouping terms:

= [a + b]/sqrt(2) |up> + [a - b]/sqrt(2) |down>.

But from our |alpha> expression, the coefficients are (1+i)/sqrt(7) and (2 -i)/sqrt(7) for |up> and |down> respectively.

So equate the coefficients:

( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i)/sqrt(7)
( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i)/sqrt(7)

Let me write these as two equations:

Equation 1: (a + b) = [ (1+i) sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)
Equation 2: (a - b) = [ (2 - i) sqrt(2) ] / sqrt(7)

Let me solve for a and b.

Add equation 1 and equation 2:

2a = [ (1+i) + (2 - i) ) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ (3 ) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So a = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Wait, let me compute the numerator:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 3.

So 2a = (3) * sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ a = (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, subtract equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = [ (1+i) - (2 - i) ) ] sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
→ ( -1 + 2i ) sqrt(2)/sqrt(7)
So b = ( (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ) / (2 sqrt(7) )

Hmm, so a and b are complex numbers. But when computing probabilities, the squared magnitudes will matter.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute the coefficients a and b.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the inner product of |alpha> with each eigenstate of A, because the probability is the square of the absolute value of that inner product.

That might be a better approach. Let me try that.

The eigenstates of A are |+> and |-> as defined before.

Compute < + | alpha > and < - | alpha >.

So, let's compute:

< + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2), 1/sqrt(2)) multiplied by the vector (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2-i)/sqrt(7) )

Wait, no. Wait, |+> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), so the bra vector < + | is ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2).

So,

< + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1-i) (1+i) + (2+i)(2 -i) ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

< + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 - i) (1 + i) + (2 + i) (2 - i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, no, let's think about it. The inner product:

< + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ ( <up| + <down| ) ( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) ] / sqrt(7)

The |alpha> is multiplied by 1/sqrt(7), so:

= (1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(7)) [ <up| (1+i)|up> + <up| (2-i)|down> + <down| (1+i)|up> + <down| (2-i)|down> ]

But <up| up> is 1, <up| down> is 0, same for other cross terms. Wait, no, actually, when you take <up| down>, it's zero.

So:

= [ (1/sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) ) ] * [ (1+i)*1 + (2 -i)*0 + 0 + (2 -i)*1 ] ?

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me compute it more correctly.

The inner product is:

< + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 - i) * (1 + i) + (2 + i) * (2 - i) ) ] / sqrt(7)

Wait, because:

< + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ ( <up| + <down| ) * ( (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ) ] * (1/sqrt(7))

So expanding this, the terms are:

<up| (1+i)|up> → (1+i) * 1
<up| (2-i)|down> → 0
<down| (1+i)|up> → 0
<down| (2-i)|down> → (2 -i)*1

So sum is (1+i) + (2 -i) = 3.

So < + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) * (3) / sqrt(7) ) = 3 / (sqrt(2) sqrt(7)) )

Similarly, compute < - | alpha >.

|-> is (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), so the inner product is:

< - | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ <up| (1+i)|up> - <up| (2 -i)|down> - <down| (1+i)|up> + <down| (2 -i)|down> ] * (1/sqrt(7))

Again, cross terms are zero.

So it becomes (1/sqrt(2)) [ (1 +i) *1 + (2 -i) *1 ] * (1/sqrt(7)) ?

Wait, no, let's compute it properly.

< - | alpha > = (1/sqrt(2)) [ ( <up| - <down| ) ( (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ) ] * (1/sqrt(7))

Expanding:

<up| (1+i)|up> → (1+i) *1
<up| (2 -i)|down> → 0
- <down| (1+i)|up> → 0
<down| (2 -i)|down> → (2 -i)*1

Wait, no, I think I messed that up. Let me do it step by step.

The product is:

[ (1/sqrt(2)) (1/sqrt(7)) ] * [ <up| (1+i)|up> + <up| (2 -i)|down> - <down| (1+i)|up> - <down| (2 -i)|down> ]

Which simplifies to:

[1/(sqrt(2) sqrt(7)))] [ (1+i) + 0 - 0 + (2 -i) * (-1) ]

Wait, wait. Let's compute each term:

Term 1: <up| (1+i)|up> = (1+i) *1 = 1+i
Term 2: <up| (2-i)|down> = 0
Term 3: - <down| (1+i)|up> = 0
Term 4: - <down| (2-i)|down> = -(2 -i) *1

So sum is (1+i) - (2 -i) = (1 + i -2 + i) = (-1 + 2i)

So < - | alpha > = [ (-1 + 2i) ] / ( sqrt(2) sqrt(7) )

So the inner products are:

c_+ = 3 / (sqrt(14))
c_- = (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(14))

Now, the probabilities are |c_+|^2 and |c_-|^2.

Compute |c_+|^2:

= (3)^2 / (14) ) = 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which is about 0.64. Looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which adds to 1. So that's a possibility.

Compute |c_-|^2:

| (-1 + 2i) |^2 = (-1)^2 + (2)^2 = 1 +4=5. So 5 /14 ≈ 0.3571428.

Wait, but 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is about 0.36. So the probabilities are approximately 0.64 and 0.36.

So that would match option A.

But wait, let's make sure. Let me compute each part again.

Wait, for < + | alpha >, I had 3/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(7)) ) → 3/sqrt(14). The square is 9/14 ≈0.6428, which is 0.64 when rounded. Similarly, the other probability is 5/14≈0.357, which rounds to 0.36. So options A says 0.64 and 0.36.

But wait, looking at the operator A's average value.

The average value is given by <A> = <alpha| A |alpha>.

Since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, and |alpha> is a state, perhaps we can compute this expectation value.

Alternatively, since A has eigenvalues ± hbar/2, the average is |c_+|^2 * (hbar/2) + |c_-|^2 * (-hbar/2) )

Wait, no. Because |+> and |-> are the eigenstates of A. So:

If |+> has eigenvalue hbar/(2), and |-> has -hbar/(2), then the expectation value is c_+^2*(hbar/2) + c_-^2*(-hbar/2).

Wait, but wait, no. Because |c_+|^2 is the probability of measuring +hbar/2, and |c_-|^2 is the probability of measuring -hbar/2.

So <A> = (|c_+|^2)(hbar/2) + (|c_-|^2)(-hbar/2) )

We have |c_+|^2 =9/14, |c_-|^2=5/14.

So:

= (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2)
= [ (9 -5) /14 ] * (hbar/2)
= (4/14) (hbar/2)
= (2/7) (hbar/2)
= hbar/7.

Wait, that's option A's average value, which says hbar/7.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.64 and 5/14≈0.36, and the average is hbar/7, which matches option A.

But wait, let me double-check the average value. Another approach is to compute <A> using the given state |alpha>.

Since A is (hbar/2) sigma_x, and sigma_x has matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], the expectation value is (hbar/2) times the expectation value of sigma_x.

So <sigma_x> = [alpha | sigma_x | alpha ]

Let's compute <alpha | sigma_x | alpha >.

Sigma_x in the |up>, |down> basis is [[0,1],[1,0]]

So compute the inner product:

<alpha | sigma_x | alpha> = [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

First, multiply the matrix with the vector:

sigma_x |alpha> = [ (2 -i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

Then, the inner product is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] * [ (2-i)/sqrt(7), (1+i)/sqrt(7) ]^T

Which is:

(1-i)(2 -i) / 7 + (2+i)(1+i) /7

Compute each term:

(1-i)(2 -i) = 2(1) + (1)(-i) -i(2) + i^2
= 2 -i - 2i -1
= (2 -1) + (-3i)
=1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) =2*1 +2i +i*1 +i^2
=2 +3i -1
=1 +3i.

Now sum: (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) =2.

So the inner product is 2/7.

Therefore, <sigma_x> =2/7.

So <A> = (hbar/2) * (2/7) )= hbar/7.

Which matches what we found earlier.

So the average value is hbar/7.

Looking back at the options, option A says probabilities 0.64, 0.36 and average hbar/7.

Wait, but the options don't say 9/14 and 5/14, but the question says "the probability of measuring the particle in each of the eigenstates of the operator..."

Wait, perhaps the eigenstates are |+> and |->, so the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14. Rounded, they are 0.64 and 0.36, which is option A.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 0.61, 0.29. No, 9/14 is approximately 0.6428, so 0.64 is correct. So the correct answer must be option A.

Wait, but looking at the problem statement again: the state is proportional to (1+i)|up> + ... Oh, right, we normalized it and found c=1/sqrt(7). So all our calculations should be correct.

So the answer should be option A: probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average hbar/7.


The problem involves an electron in the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The goal is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( A \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( A_{ij} = 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( A \) must be determined.

### Key Steps:
1. **Normalization of \( |\alpha\rangle \):**
   The given state is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \). To normalize it, compute the inner product:
   \[
   \langle \alpha | \alpha \rangle = \frac{1}{7} \left[ (1+i)(1-i) + (2-i)(2+i) \right] = \frac{1}{7} \left[ 2 + 5 \right] = 1.
   \]
   Thus, the normalized state is:
   \[
   |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right].
   \]

2. **Eigenstates of \( A \):**
   The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:
   \[
   A = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix},
   \]
   which corresponds to \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_x \), where \( \sigma_x \) is the Pauli \( x \)-matrix. The eigenstates of \( A \) are:
   \[
   |+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right),
   \]
   with eigenvalues \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \) and \( -\frac{\hbar}{2} \), respectively.

3. **Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \):**
   Expand \( |\alpha\rangle \) as:
   \[
   |\alpha\rangle = c_+ |+\rangle + c_- |-\rangle.
   \]
   Substituting the expressions for \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), equate coefficients to match the terms in \( |\alpha\rangle \). After solving, the coefficients are:
   \[
   c_+ = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad c_- = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
   \]

4. **Probabilities of measuring \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \):**
   The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of \( c_+ \) and \( c_- \):
   \[
   P(+\rangle) = |c_+|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.64, \quad P(-\rangle) = |c_-|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.36.
   \]

5. **Average value of \( A \):**
   The average value of \( A \) is:
   \[
   \langle A \rangle = P(+\rangle) \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + P(-\rangle) \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
   \]
   Substituting the probabilities:
   \[
   \langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} - \frac{5}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of \( A \) are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). These results match **Option A**.
