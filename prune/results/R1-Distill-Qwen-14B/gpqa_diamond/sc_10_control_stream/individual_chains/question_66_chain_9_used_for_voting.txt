Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about symmetries in the SMEFT framework. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, what is SMEFT? I remember SMEFT stands for Standard Model Effective Field Theory. It's a framework used to describe physics beyond the Standard Model in a systematic way. It includes higher-dimensional operators that parameterize the effects of new physics.

The question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. The options are about Lorentz, Poincare, CP, and CPT symmetries.

Let me break down each symmetry:

1. Lorentz Symmetry: This symmetry is about the invariance of physical laws under Lorentz transformations, which include rotations and boosts. In the Standard Model, all interactions respect Lorentz symmetry. Since SMEFT is an effective theory built from the SM, I think all its operators must also respect Lorentz symmetry. Otherwise, they wouldn't make sense in the relativistic framework of the SM.

2. Poincare Symmetry: Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations (like shifting position in space and time). So, it's a bigger symmetry group. All the SM operators respect Poincare symmetry. But wait, are Poincare symmetry requirements automatically satisfied if Lorentz symmetry is already respected? Because Poincare includes translations, which relate to momentum conservation. SMEFT operators are local, so they should respect translation symmetry. Therefore, if an operator respects Lorentz symmetry, it probably respects Poincare as well. But wait, do all operators in SMEFT automatically respect this? Or is it something that must be explicitly maintained?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, so all operators must be Lorentz scalars. Poincare symmetry includes translations, which are part of the symmetries of spacetime. If the operators are local and the theory is Lorentz-invariant, then they should respect Poincare symmetry. So, operators in SMEFT must respect both Lorentz and Poincare symmetries. So both 1 and 2 are correct.

3. CP Symmetry: CP stands for Charge conjugation and Parity. The Standard Model doesn't fully respect CP symmetry. For example, the CKM matrix in QCD has CP violation. So, the SM doesn't have a CP symmetry. That means SMEFT operators don't have to respect CP symmetry. In fact, operators can have explicit CP violation. So, 3 is not a symmetry that must be respected.

4. CPT Symmetry: CPT is Charge, Parity, and Time reversal. The CPT theorem states that in any quantum field theory that is Lorentz-invariant, CPT symmetry must be respected. So, even if the theory doesn't respect C, P, or T individually, the combination must hold. So all operators in SMEFT must respect CPT symmetry because they respect Lorentz symmetry. If an operator doesn't respect CPT, that could violate Lorentz symmetry. So yes, 4 must be respected.

Wait, but how about the SM? The SM doesn't have CPT symmetry violations. Wait, no, the CPT theorem holds in theories that are Lorentz-invariant. So, SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, so it must respect CPT. So 4 is a must.

Now, putting it together. The question is which of the options are symmetries that must be respected by all SMEFT operators.

Option 1: Lorentz Symmetry (Yes)
Option 2: Poincare Symmetry (Yes)
Option 3: CP Symmetry (No)
Option 4: CPT Symmetry (Yes)

So, which of the options in the question include 1,2,4?

Looking at the options:

A) 1,2 → includes Lorentz and Poincare. But what about CPT? So A is missing CPT.

B)3,4 → No, because SMEFT doesn't have to respect CP.

C)1,2,4 → Yes, includes all three.

D)1,3,4 → Includes Lorentz, CP, CPT. But no Poincare.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Poincare symmetry should be respected. So the correct symmetries that must be respected are 1,2,4. So option C.

Wait, could I have made a mistake about Poincare? Because some sources say that Poincare includes the group of Lorentz transformations and translations. Since the SMEFT is a Lorentz-invariant theory, and all operators are local (so translation-invariant), then yes, they must respect Poincare.

So the correct symmetries that must be respected are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So the answer should be option C.

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is a framework that systematically incorporates physics beyond the Standard Model through higher-dimensional operators. These operators must respect certain symmetries to remain consistent with the relativistic and quantum framework of the Standard Model. Let us analyze the symmetries in question:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This symmetry ensures invariance under Lorentz transformations (rotations and boosts). Since SMEFT is built on the Standard Model, which respects Lorentz symmetry, all operators in SMEFT must also respect Lorentz symmetry. Therefore, this symmetry is required.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT operators are local and respect Lorentz symmetry, they must also respect Poincaré symmetry. Thus, this symmetry is required.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry involves charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). The Standard Model does not fully respect CP symmetry (e.g., CP violation in the CKM matrix). Consequently, SMEFT operators do not need to respect CP symmetry, and explicit CP violation is allowed. Therefore, this symmetry is not required.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory must respect the combined symmetry of charge conjugation, parity, and time reversal. Since SMEFT is Lorentz-invariant, it must respect CPT symmetry. Thus, this symmetry is required.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is:

**Answer: C**
