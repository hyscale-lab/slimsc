Okay, so I've got this question about the area of a pseudosphere given a specific metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

The metric given is ds² = [32 / (4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit strange. I remember that in general relativity, the metric tensor describes the geometry of spacetime. But here, it's given in terms of x and y, which makes me think it's in a 2D space (maybe a 2-dimensional manifold?), but pseudospheres are higher-dimensional objects, typically 3D or 4D. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, pseudospheres are surfaces with constant negative curvature, right? Like the hyperbolic space. So maybe this metric represents a 2-dimensional hyperbolic space, and the question is about finding the area of such a pseudosphere with radius r=2.

Wait, but the options don't involve r, except for the answer options. Oh wait, the question says "pseudosphere of radius r=2." Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure how that ties into the metric given. Maybe the metric is for a specific model of the pseudosphere?

I remember that in 2D, the metric for hyperbolic space can be written in different forms, like the Poincaré disk model. The Poincaré disk model has a metric where the line element is ds² = [2/(1 + x² + y²)]² (dx² + dy²), but that doesn't exactly match what's given here. Let me compare:

Given metric denominator is (4 - x² - y²), and the coefficient is 32/(denominator). Wait, 32 is 2^5, but maybe that's a clue.

Wait, 4 is 2 squared. So the denominator is 4 - x² - y² = (2)^2 - (x² + y²). So perhaps this is a scaled version of the Poincaré disk model. Let me think: in the Poincaré disk model, the metric is usually ds² = [2/(1 + r²)]² (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in polar coordinates. But wait, in the given metric, it's [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me try to express this differently.

Wait, maybe if I factor out the 4, the denominator becomes 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4). So 4 - x² - y² = 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4) = 4(1 - (r²)/4), where r² = x² + y². So the denominator is 4(1 - (r²/4)).

So the metric becomes (32) / [4(1 - (r²/4))] times (dx² + dy²). Simplify 32/4: that's 8. So 8 / [1 - (r²/4)] times (dx² + dy²).

Hmm, but the usual Poincaré disk model (for hyperbolic space) has a metric like (4/(1 - r^2)^2)(dr^2 + r^2 dθ^2). Wait, let's see:

In the Poincaré model, the metric is ds² = [2/(1 + r²)]^2 (dr^2 + r² dθ²). Alternatively, written in terms of x and y, it's [4/( (1 - x² - y²)^2 ) ] (dx² + dy²). Wait, but that's different from the given metric.

Wait, the given metric is 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me factor out the 4:

32/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4)) ) (dx² + dy²) = (8) [1/(1 - (r²/4))] (dx² + dy²), where r² = x² + y².

So ds² = (8) * (1/(1 - (r²/4))) (dx² + dy^2). Comparing to the standard Poincaré disk metric, which is [4/(1 - r^2)]^2 (dx² + dy²) in some scaling? Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a different model of hyperbolic space, like the Beltrami-Klein model? I'm not sure. But regardless, the key point is to compute the area of the pseudosphere. Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and in 2D, the area of a pseudosphere (which is a hyperbolic plane) isn't finite. But if it's a sphere in higher dimensions... Wait, no, pseudospheres are surfaces with negative curvature, meaning that their area is infinite.

Wait, the question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, what's the area of a pseudosphere with radius r? I think the area of a (n-dimensional) pseudosphere (like a hyperbolic space) is infinite. But for a 2-dimensional pseudosphere, which is a hyperbolic plane, the area is indeed infinite. But wait, maybe the question is about a 2D pseudosphere as a surface embedded in 3D space. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is for a sphere with a specific radius, but the terms are confusing me. Let me think about the area in the given metric.

In general, the area in a 2D metric is computed by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dxdy. Wait, but for a diagonal metric with ds² = g_xx dx² + g_yy dy², the determinant is g_xx * g_yy. So in this case, g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_yy is the same. So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2.

So the area element would be sqrt(det) dx dy = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy. Wait, because sqrt( (32/(...))^2 ) is 32/(...). So the area is the integral of 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy over the region where the metric is defined.

But what is the region of definition? The denominator 4 - x² - y² must not be zero, so x² + y² <4. So the region is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

So the area would be the integral over x² + y² < 4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, that seems a bit tricky, but perhaps we can switch to polar coordinates. Let me do that. Let r² = x² + y², so x² + y² = r². Then, the integral becomes:

∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

The area element in polar coordinates is r dr dθ, so the integrand becomes [32/(4 - r²)] * r. So the entire integral is 32 * 2π ∫ [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute that integral. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then, du/dr = -2r → (-du/2) = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=4 -4=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ (r dr) / u ] = ∫ (from 4 to 0) [ (-du/2) / u ].

Wait, let's set it up:

∫ [ r dr/(4 - r²) ] from 0 to 2.

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So when r=0, u=4. r=2, u=0.

So ∫ [ r dr/(4 - r^2) ] dr becomes ∫ [ (-du/2)/u ] from u=4 to u=0.

Which is (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from 4 to 0.

Which is (-1/2) [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0 → (-1/2)[ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this integral diverges to positive infinity because of the negative sign. Wait, let's see:

The integral becomes (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] → (-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln4 ] → (-1/2)(-infty) = positive infinity.

Hmm, so the integral is divergent. So the area would be infinite.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, but the metric given is for a 2-dimensional space, so perhaps the pseudosphere here refers to a 2-dimensional hyperbolic space. But in that case, the area (volume) is infinite because hyperbolic space is unbounded. So the area would be infinite, which would correspond to option D, which is +infinite.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make a mistake in the substitution?

Wait, let me compute the integral again.

So, the integral is ∫ [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute it without substitution.

Let me write it as ∫ [ r dr ] / (4 - r² )

Let me consider the denominator 4 - r². Let me let u = 4 - r², then du = -2r dr. So r dr = -du/2.

So Integral becomes ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] = (-1/2) ∫ du/u.

Which is (-1/2) ln |u| + C. So, evaluating from r=0 to r=2, which is u=4 to u=0.

So, [ (-1/2) ln(u) ] from u=4 to u=0 → [ (-1/2)(ln 0) ) - (-1/2 ln4) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so (-1/2)(-infty) is positive infinity. So the integral is [ infinity + (1/2 ln4) ] → infinity. So the area is 32 * 2π * infinity → infinity.

So the area is infinite, which would be option D.

Wait, but another thought: the given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). If I take the square root of the determinant, which is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². Then, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

So the area would be the integral of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ over r from 0 to 2.

But this integral diverges because as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, making the integrand go to infinity. So the area is infinite.

Therefore, the correct answer is D) +infty.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional hyperbolic space. To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we calculate the area element in this metric. For a diagonal metric \( ds^2 = g_{xx} dx^2 + g_{yy} dy^2 \), the area element is \( \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy \), where \( \det g = g_{xx} g_{yy} \). Here, \( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \), so the area element becomes:

\[
\sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The region of integration is where \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane. Switching to polar coordinates (\( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \)), the area element becomes:

\[
\frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The \( \theta \)-integration contributes a factor of \( 2\pi \), so the integral reduces to:

\[
\text{Area} = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \), we use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which gives \( r \, dr = -\frac{du}{2} \). The limits of integration change as follows: when \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \); when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{-\frac{du}{2}}{u} = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \ln|u| \Big|_0^4 = \frac{1}{2} \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right].
\]

Since \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

The correct answer is:

Okay, so I've got this question about the area of a pseudosphere given a specific metric. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity and differential geometry, but let's try to think this through.

Wait, 4 is 2 squared. So the denominator is 4 - x² - y² = (2)^2 - (x² + y²). So perhaps this is a scaled version of the Poincaré disk model. Let me think: in the Poincaré disk model, the metric is usually ds² = [2/(1 + r²)]² (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in polar coordinates.

So the metric becomes (32) / [4(1 - (r²/4))] times (dx² + dy²). Simplify 32/4: that's 8. So 8 / [1 - (r²/4)] times (dx² + dy²).

Hmm, but the usual Poincaré disk model (for hyperbolic space) has a metric like (4/(1 - r^2)^2)(dr^2 + r^2 dθ^2). Wait, let's see:

In the Poincaré model, the metric is ds² = [2/(1 + r²)]^2 (dr^2 + r² dθ²). Alternatively, written in terms of x and y, it's [4/( (1 - x² - y²)^2 ) ] (dx² + dy²). Wait, but that's different from the given metric.

Wait, the given metric is 32/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Let me factor out the 4:

32/(4(1 - (x² + y²)/4)) ) (dx² + dy²) = (8) [1/(1 - (r²/4))] (dx² + dy²), where r² = x² + y².

So ds² = (8) * (1/(1 - (r²/4))) (dx² + dy^2). Comparing to the standard Poincaré disk metric, which is [4/(1 - r^2)]^2 (dx² + dy²) in some scaling? Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a different model of hyperbolic space, like the Beltrami-Klein model? I'm not sure. But regardless, the key point is to compute the area of the pseudosphere. Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and in 2D, the area of a pseudosphere (which is a hyperbolic plane) isn't finite. But if it's a sphere in higher dimensions... Wait, no, pseudospheres are surfaces with negative curvature, meaning that their area is infinite.

I think the area of a (n-dimensional) pseudosphere (like a hyperbolic space) is infinite. But for a 2-dimensional pseudosphere, which is a hyperbolic plane, the area is indeed infinite. But wait, maybe the question is about a 2D pseudosphere as a surface embedded in 3D space. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is for a sphere with a specific radius, but the terms are confusing me. Let me think about the area in the given metric.

In general, the area in a 2D metric is computed by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor times dxdy. Wait, but for a diagonal metric with ds² = g_xx dx² + g_yy dy², the determinant is g_xx * g_yy. So in this case, g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and g_yy is the same. So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2.

So the area element would be sqrt(det) dx dy = (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy. Wait, because sqrt( (32/(...))^2 ) is 32/(...). So the area is the integral of 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy over the region where the metric is defined.

But what is the region of definition? The denominator 4 - x² - y² must not be zero, so x² + y² <4. So the region is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane.

So the area would be the integral over x² + y² < 4 of [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

Wait, that seems a bit tricky, but perhaps we can switch to polar coordinates. Let me do that. Let r² = x² + y², so x² + y² = r². Then, the integral becomes:

∫ (from r=0 to 2) ∫ (θ=0 to 2π) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

The area element in polar coordinates is r dr dθ, so the integrand becomes [32/(4 - r²)] * r. So the entire integral is 32 * 2π ∫ [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute that integral. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then, du/dr = -2r → (-du/2) = r dr.

So when r=0, u=4. When r=2, u=4 -4=0.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ (r dr) / u ] = ∫ (from 4 to 0) [ (-du/2) / u ].

Wait, let's set it up:

∫ [ r dr/(4 - r²) ] from 0 to 2.

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2r dr → r dr = -du/2.

So when r=0, u=4. r=2, u=0.

So ∫ [ r dr/(4 - r^2) ] dr becomes ∫ [ (-du/2)/u ] from u=4 to u=0.

Which is (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du from 4 to 0.

Which is (-1/2) [ ln(u) ] from 4 to 0 → (-1/2)[ ln(0) - ln(4) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so this integral diverges to positive infinity because of the negative sign. Wait, let's see:

The integral becomes (-1/2) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ] → (-1/2) [ (-infty) - ln4 ] → (-1/2)(-infty) = positive infinity.

Hmm, so the integral is divergent. So the area would be infinite.

Wait, but the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, but the metric given is for a 2-dimensional space, so perhaps the pseudosphere here refers to a 2-dimensional hyperbolic space. But in that case, the area (volume) is infinite because hyperbolic space is unbounded. So the area would be infinite, which would correspond to option D, which is +infinite.

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I make a mistake in the substitution?

Wait, let me compute the integral again.

So, the integral is ∫ [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr from 0 to 2.

Let me compute it without substitution.

Let me write it as ∫ [ r dr ] / (4 - r² )

Let me consider the denominator 4 - r². Let me let u = 4 - r², then du = -2r dr. So r dr = -du/2.

So Integral becomes ∫ [ (-du/2) / u ] = (-1/2) ∫ du/u.

Which is (-1/2) ln |u| + C. So, evaluating from r=0 to r=2, which is u=4 to u=0.

So, [ (-1/2) ln(u) ] from u=4 to u=0 → [ (-1/2)(ln 0) ) - (-1/2 ln4) ].

But ln(0) is negative infinity, so (-1/2)(-infty) is positive infinity. So the integral is [ infinity + (1/2 ln4) ] → infinity. So the area is 32 * 2π * infinity → infinity.

So the area is infinite, which would be option D.

Wait, but another thought: the given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). If I take the square root of the determinant, which is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². Then, the area element is sqrt(g) dx dy = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] dx dy.

So the area would be the integral of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ over r from 0 to 2.

But this integral diverges because as r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, making the integrand go to infinity. So the area is infinite.

Therefore, the correct answer is D) +infty.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional hyperbolic space. To compute the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \), we calculate the area element in this metric. For a diagonal metric \( ds^2 = g_{xx} dx^2 + g_{yy} dy^2 \), the area element is \( \sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy \), where \( \det g = g_{xx} g_{yy} \). Here, \( g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \), so the area element becomes:

\[
\sqrt{\det g} \, dx \, dy = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

The region of integration is where \( 4 - x^2 - y^2 > 0 \), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane. Switching to polar coordinates (\( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \)), the area element becomes:

\[
\frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The total area is then:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The \( \theta \)-integration contributes a factor of \( 2\pi \), so the integral reduces to:

\[
\text{Area} = 32 \cdot 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \), we use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \), which gives \( r \, dr = -\frac{du}{2} \). The limits of integration change as follows: when \( r = 0 \), \( u = 4 \); when \( r = 2 \), \( u = 0 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_4^0 \frac{-\frac{du}{2}}{u} = \frac{1}{2} \int_0^4 \frac{du}{u}.
\]

This evaluates to:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \ln|u| \Big|_0^4 = \frac{1}{2} \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right].
\]

Since \( \ln(0) \to -\infty \), the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

The correct answer is:
