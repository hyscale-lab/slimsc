Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Then, Pauli statistics impose some condition on the final state's isospin, angular momentum, and spin. The condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh wait, I need to remember what each of these stands for.

From what I recall, T is the isospin, S is the total spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. So the equation is about the parity in terms of these quantum numbers. And the final state has T=0. So substituting that in, we get 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. Let me rearrange that: S + L ≡ -1 mod 2, which is the same as S + L ≡ 1 mod 2 because -1 mod 2 is 1. So S and L must have opposite parities. That is, if S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.

Now, the problem asks which partial wave isn't permitted. The options are different transitions where the emitted particle has certain quantum numbers. Each option gives a transition from 1S0 to something else, and the emitted particle is either p, f, s, or something else? Wait, the letters after the numbers denote the orbital angular momentum, I think. Like S, P, D, F, etc., which correspond to l=0,1,2,3... So S is l=0, P is l=1, D is l=2, F is l=3, etc.

Wait, but the problem statement says the particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Parity is a multiplicative quantum number, so the overall parity of the system must be conserved. The initial state is 1S0, so let me figure out its parity.

The 1S0 state has S=0 because the notation is (2S+1)LJ, so 1S0 means 2*0+1=1, so S=0. The L is the orbital angular momentum part; the S here is the notation, so for the 1S0 state, L must be 0 (since S denotes l=0). So the state's parity is (-1)^L * (intrinsic parity of the nucleons). Wait, but in the case of two nucleons, their intrinsic parity is each +1, I think. Because protons and neutrons are fermions, but their intrinsic parity is positive. Wait no, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the intrinsic parity for fermions is usually taken as +1, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps the parity of the NN system is (-1)^L, since the spin doesn't contribute to parity (as spin is part of the state's description but parity is about spatial inversion). So for 1S0, the parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

Wait, no. The parity of the state is given by (-1)^L multiplied by the intrinsic parity of the particles. But for identical particles like nucleons, which are fermions, their combined intrinsic parity is (-1)^{L+S} when considering their exchange. Hmm, I might be mixing things up here.

Alternatively, for a two-body system, the parity is (-1)^L multiplied by the intrinsic parity of each particle. Since both nucleons are fermions with intrinsic parity +1 each, the combined intrinsic parity is (+1)*(+1) * (-1)^L? Wait, no, because the parity for each particle is their own. So the parity of the system would be (-1)^L * (intrinsic parity of each)^something. Wait, maybe it's (-1)^L multiplied by the product of their intrinsic parities. So for two nucleons, each with parity +1, the product is +1. So the parity of the NN state is (-1)^L.

Wait, but in this problem, the initial state is 1S0. So L is 0, so the parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

Now, when they emit a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state multiplied by the parity of X. Because parity is conserved in strong interactions (assuming this is a strong decay), so parity before equals parity after.

Wait, the initial state is NN in 1S0 with parity +1. After emitting X, the final state is the NN in some state and X in some state. So the parity of the initial state (NN) is +1. The parity of the final state will be the parity of the NN state after emission multiplied by the parity of X. So:

Initial parity (NN) = Final parity (NN) * parity(X)

Because the X is emitted, so the parity of the system (NN) plus X is the product. Wait, no. Let me think. The parity of the entire system before emission is +1. After emission, the NN system plus X must have parity +1. But wait, the problem is about the final NN state, and the particle X. So the parity of the NN system after emission must be (parity of initial NN) * (parity of X) * (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum associated with the emission (the partial wave). Or wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the parity of the process is conserved, so the parity of the initial state (NN) must equal the product of the parity of the final NN state and the parity of X, multiplied by (-1)^L', where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. Because when a particle is emitted, the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle contributes a factor of (-1)^L'.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to write it down properly.

The initial parity (P_initial) is +1 (from 1S0).

The final parity (P_final) is P_NN * P_X * (-1)^L_emission, where L_emission is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X.

So P_initial = P_NN * P_X * (-1)^L_emission.

We know P_initial is +1, P_X is -1. So:

1 = P_NN * (-1) * (-1)^L_emission.

So 1 = P_NN * (-1)^{L_emission +1}.

Wait, because (-1)^{L_emission} multiplied by (-1) is (-1)^{L_emission +1}.

So rearranging, P_NN = (-1)^{L_emission +1}.

But wait, the parity of the final NN state, P_NN, is determined by its (L, S) quantum numbers. Because for a two-nucleon system, the parity is (-1)^L, since each nucleon has intrinsic parity +1, so product is (+1), multiplied by (-1)^L. So P_NN = (-1)^L.

So substituting that into the above equation:

(-1)^L = (-1)^{L_emission +1}.

Which can be rewritten as (-1)^L = (-1)^{L_emission} * (-1)^1.

So (-1)^L = (-1)^{L_emission + 1}.

Taking log base (-1), the exponents must be equal mod 2:

L ≡ L_emission + 1 mod 2.

So L_emission ≡ L -1 mod 2.

Alternatively, L_emission = (L -1) mod 2.

Now, the final NN state after emission has certain quantum numbers. Let's think about each option.

Each option gives a transition from 1S0 to some state, and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum. So for each option, the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum is given by the letter, like p is l=1 (P state), f is l=3 (F state), etc.

Wait, the option format is something like 1S0 → something + letter. The letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. So the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l equal to the letter's value: S is 0, P is 1, D is 2, F is 3, etc.

So for each option, the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum (l) is given by the letter.

So let's go through each option.

Option A: 1S0 →7D1 + p.

Wait, the 7D1 probably refers to the final NN state. Let me parse this correctly. The initial state is 1S0. The final state is 7D1, and the emitted particle is p (l=1).

Wait, wait, wait, I think I'm misunderstanding the notation. The problem states: "the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X."

So in each option, the emitted particle X has a certain angular momentum state. For example, in option A, the emitted particle is p, which is l=1. So X has l=1.

So for each option:

Option A: 1S0 →7D1 + p. So X is p (l=1). The final NN state is 7D1. Let's parse 7D1: the notation is (2S+1)LJ. So 7D1 would be (2S+1) =7, so S=3. L is D, which is l=2. J is 1.

So S=3, L=2, J=1.

But wait, for the final NN state, the parity is (-1)^L. So L=2, so parity is (-1)^2 = +1.

Now, let's compute P_NN: (+1).

Earlier, we had P_NN = (-1)^L, so yes, that's correct.

Now, from earlier, we have:

L_emission ≡ L_NN -1 mod 2.

In this option, L_emission is l=1 (p), so L_emission=1.

L_NN is 2.

So 1 ≡ 2 -1 mod 2 → 1 ≡ 1 mod 2. Correct. So that's allowed.

Next, we have the Pauli statistics condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.

Wait, in the problem statement, Pauli requires that T = S + L +1 mod 2.

But the final state has T=0. So 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L =1 mod 2.

In this option, S=3 (since 7D1 has S=3), and L=2.

3 + 2 =5 → 5 mod 2 is 1. So 0 =1 mod 2? Wait, no. Wait, the condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. The final T is 0. So 0 ≡ S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L +1 ≡0 mod 2 → S + L ≡1 mod 2. So 3+2=5 → 5 mod 2 is 1. So yes, 1 ≡1 mod 2. So condition holds. So this state is allowed. So option A is allowed.

Option B: 1S0 →3S1 + p.

So X is p (l=1). The final NN state is 3S1. Let's parse that: 3S1 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is S, which is l=0. J=1.

So parity of NN is (-1)^0=+1.

L_emission is 1. So L_emission=1.

Earlier equation: L_emission ≡ L_NN -1 mod 2.

L_NN is 0.

So 1 ≡0 -1 mod 2 → 1 ≡ -1 mod 2 → 1 ≡1 mod 2. Correct.

Now, check Pauli condition.

Final state: S=1, L=0.

So S + L =1+0=1 → 1 mod 2 is 1.

So 0 =1 +1 mod 2? Wait, no. Wait, condition is T= S + L +1 mod 2.

Wait, T is 0. So 0 ≡ (1) + (0) +1 mod 2 → 0 ≡ 2 mod 2 → 0 ≡0. Yes, that's correct.

So this option is allowed. So option B is allowed.

Option C: 1S0 →3D3 + f.

X is f, so l=3.

The final NN state is 3D3.

Parsing: 3D3 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is D, which is 2. J=3.

Parity of NN is (-1)^2 = +1.

L_emission is 3 (f).

Earlier equation: L_emission ≡ L_NN -1 mod 2.

L_NN is 2.

So 3 ≡2-1 mod 2 → 3 mod2 is 1. 2-1=1 mod2 → 1≡1. Correct.

Pauli condition:

S=1, L=2. So 1+2=3 →3 mod2 is 1.

So 0 ≡1+1 mod2 →0 ≡0. Correct.

So this option is allowed. So option C is allowed.

Option D: 1S0 →3P0 + s.

X is s, so l=0.

Final NN state is 3P0.

Parsing: 3P0 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is P → l=1. J=0.

Wait, J is the total angular momentum, which is L + S. Wait, but J can be |L-S| to L+S in steps of 1. So for L=1 and S=1, possible J are 0,1,2.

So 3P0 has J=0, which is possible.

Parity of NN: (-1)^1 = -1.

Wait, but earlier we have parity considerations.

Wait, initial parity is +1. Final parity is P_NN * P_X * (-1)^{l_emission}.

P_NN is (-1)^1 = -1.

P_X is -1 (given).

l_emission is s → l=0. So (-1)^0=1.

So initial parity =1.

Final parity: (-1) * (-1) *1 = 1. So that's okay. Parity is conserved.

Wait, but according to our earlier equation, P_NN must equal (-1)^{L_emission +1}.

Wait, let's use the equation:

P_NN = (-1)^{L_emission +1}.

In this option, P_NN is -1 (since L=1).

L_emission is 0 (s state).

So (-1)^{0 +1} = (-1)^1 = -1. Which matches P_NN of -1.

So parity is conserved.

Now, let's check the Pauli condition.

S=1, L=1.

So S + L =2 → mod2 is 0.

So T= S + L +1 mod2 → 0 +1 =1 mod2. But the T is given as 0. So 0 ≡1 mod2? No, that's not correct.

Wait, the condition is T = S + L +1 mod2.

If T=0, then 0 ≡ (S + L +1) mod2.

In this case, S=1, L=1.

So 1 +1 +1 =3 →3 mod2=1.

So 0 ≡1 → which is false.

So this state doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition.

Wait, but wait, the Pauli condition is given as T = S + L +1 mod2. But in this case, the T is 0. So we have 0 ≡ (1 +1 +1) mod2 → 0 ≡1 → no. So this condition is not met. Therefore, this transition is not allowed.

So the partial wave that's not permitted is option D.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, in option D, the emitted particle has l=0 (s state). So L_emission=0.

From earlier condition, L_emission ≡ L_NN -1 mod2.

L_NN is 1 (P state).

So 0 ≡1 -1 → 0 ≡0 mod2. Correct.

But the Pauli condition is the issue here.

So the final state's S is 1, L is1.

So S + L +1 =1+1+1=3 → mod2=1.

But T is 0. So 0 ≡1 mod2 is false. So this condition is not satisfied, meaning this state is not allowed. Thus, option D is not permitted.

So the answer is option D.

To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:

1. **Initial State and Parity Conservation**:  
   The initial state is **1S0**, where the orbital angular momentum \( L = 0 \) and the parity is \( (-1)^L = +1 \). When the two nucleons (NN) emit a particle \( X \) with intrinsic parity \( -1 \), the parity of the system must be conserved. The parity of the final state is given by:  
   \[
   P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{final NN}} \cdot P_X \cdot (-1)^{L_{\text{emission}}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( P_{\text{initial}} = +1 \), \( P_X = -1 \), and \( (-1)^{L_{\text{emission}}} \), we find:  
   \[
   1 = P_{\text{final NN}} \cdot (-1) \cdot (-1)^{L_{\text{emission}}}
   \]  
   Simplifying, \( P_{\text{final NN}} = (-1)^{L_{\text{emission}} + 1} \). For the final NN state, the parity is also \( (-1)^L \), where \( L \) is the orbital angular momentum of the final state. Equating these, we get:  
   \[
   L_{\text{emission}} \equiv L_{\text{final NN}} - 1 \pmod{2}.
   \]

2. **Pauli Statistics Condition**:  
   Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers satisfy:  
   \[
   T_{\text{NN}} = S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} + 1 \pmod{2}.
   \]  
   For the final state, \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \), so:  
   \[
   S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.
   \]

3. **Analysis of Each Option**:  
   We analyze each option to check if the conditions are satisfied.

   - **Option A: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)**

     - Parity condition: \( L_{\text{emission}} = 1 \), \( L_{\text{final NN}} = 2 \).  
       \[
       1 \equiv 2 - 1 \pmod{2} \implies 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.
       \]  
     - Pauli condition: \( S + L = 3 + 2 = 5 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \).  
       \[
       0 \equiv 1 + 1 \pmod{2} \implies 0 \equiv 0 \pmod{2}.
       \]  
     - **Allowed**.

   - **Option B: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)**

     - Emitted particle \( X \): \( p \) (orbital angular momentum \( l = 1 \)).  
     - Parity condition: \( L_{\text{emission}} = 1 \), \( L_{\text{final NN}} = 0 \).  
       \[
       1 \equiv 0 - 1 \pmod{2} \implies 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.
       \]  
     - Pauli condition: \( S + L = 1 + 0 = 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{2} \).  
       \[
       0 \equiv 1 + 1 \pmod{2} \implies 0 \equiv 0 \pmod{2}.
       \]  
     - **Allowed**.

   - **Option C: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)**  
     - Final NN state: \( 3D3 \), with \( S = 1 \), \( L = 2 \), and \( J = 3 \).  
     - Emitted particle \( X \): \( f \) (orbital angular momentum \( l = 3 \)).  
     - Parity condition: \( L_{\text{emission}} = 3 \), \( L_{\text{final NN}} = 2 \).

Answer: D

Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says we have a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Then, Pauli statistics impose some condition on the final state's isospin, angular momentum, and spin. The condition is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh wait, I need to remember what each of these stands for.

From what I recall, T is the isospin, S is the total spin, and L is the orbital angular momentum. So the equation is about the parity in terms of these quantum numbers. And the final state has T=0. So substituting that in, we get 0 = S + L + 1 mod 2. Let me rearrange that: S + L ≡ -1 mod 2, which is the same as S + L ≡ 1 mod 2 because -1 mod 2 is 1. So S and L must have opposite parities. That is, if S is even, L is odd, and vice versa.

Now, the problem asks which partial wave isn't permitted. The options are different transitions where the emitted particle has certain quantum numbers. Each option gives a transition from 1S0 to something else, and the emitted particle is either p, f, s, or something else? Wait, the letters after the numbers denote the orbital angular momentum, I think. Like S, P, D, F, etc., which correspond to l=0,1,2,3... So S is l=0, P is l=1, D is l=2, F is l=3, etc.

Wait, but the problem statement says the particle X has an intrinsic parity of -1. Parity is a multiplicative quantum number, so the overall parity of the system must be conserved. The initial state is 1S0, so let me figure out its parity.

The 1S0 state has S=0 because the notation is (2S+1)LJ, so 1S0 means 2*0+1=1, so S=0. The L is the orbital angular momentum part; the S here is the notation, so for the 1S0 state, L must be 0 (since S denotes l=0). So the state's parity is (-1)^L * (intrinsic parity of the nucleons). Wait, but in the case of two nucleons, their intrinsic parity is each +1, I think. Because protons and neutrons are fermions, but their intrinsic parity is positive. Wait no, I'm a bit confused. Wait, the intrinsic parity for fermions is usually taken as +1, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps the parity of the NN system is (-1)^L, since the spin doesn't contribute to parity (as spin is part of the state's description but parity is about spatial inversion). So for 1S0, the parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

Wait, no. The parity of the state is given by (-1)^L multiplied by the intrinsic parity of the particles. But for identical particles like nucleons, which are fermions, their combined intrinsic parity is (-1)^{L+S} when considering their exchange. Hmm, I might be mixing things up here.

Alternatively, for a two-body system, the parity is (-1)^L multiplied by the intrinsic parity of each particle. Since both nucleons are fermions with intrinsic parity +1 each, the combined intrinsic parity is (+1)*(+1) * (-1)^L? Wait, no, because the parity for each particle is their own. So the parity of the system would be (-1)^L * (intrinsic parity of each)^something. Wait, maybe it's (-1)^L multiplied by the product of their intrinsic parities. So for two nucleons, each with parity +1, the product is +1. So the parity of the NN state is (-1)^L.

Wait, but in this problem, the initial state is 1S0. So L is 0, so the parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

Now, when they emit a particle X, which has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of the initial state must equal the parity of the final state multiplied by the parity of X. Because parity is conserved in strong interactions (assuming this is a strong decay), so parity before equals parity after.

Wait, the initial state is NN in 1S0 with parity +1. After emitting X, the final state is the NN in some state and X in some state. So the parity of the initial state (NN) is +1. The parity of the final state will be the parity of the NN state after emission multiplied by the parity of X. So:

Initial parity (NN) = Final parity (NN) * parity(X)

Because the X is emitted, so the parity of the system (NN) plus X is the product. Wait, no. Let me think. The parity of the entire system before emission is +1. After emission, the NN system plus X must have parity +1. But wait, the problem is about the final NN state, and the particle X. So the parity of the NN system after emission must be (parity of initial NN) * (parity of X) * (-1)^l, where l is the orbital angular momentum associated with the emission (the partial wave). Or wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, the parity of the process is conserved, so the parity of the initial state (NN) must equal the product of the parity of the final NN state and the parity of X, multiplied by (-1)^L', where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle. Because when a particle is emitted, the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle contributes a factor of (-1)^L'.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to write it down properly.

The initial parity (P_initial) is +1 (from 1S0).

The final parity (P_final) is P_NN * P_X * (-1)^L_emission, where L_emission is the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle X.

So P_initial = P_NN * P_X * (-1)^L_emission.

We know P_initial is +1, P_X is -1. So:

1 = P_NN * (-1) * (-1)^L_emission.

So 1 = P_NN * (-1)^{L_emission +1}.

Wait, because (-1)^{L_emission} multiplied by (-1) is (-1)^{L_emission +1}.

So rearranging, P_NN = (-1)^{L_emission +1}.

But wait, the parity of the final NN state, P_NN, is determined by its (L, S) quantum numbers. Because for a two-nucleon system, the parity is (-1)^L, since each nucleon has intrinsic parity +1, so product is (+1), multiplied by (-1)^L. So P_NN = (-1)^L.

So substituting that into the above equation:

(-1)^L = (-1)^{L_emission +1}.

Which can be rewritten as (-1)^L = (-1)^{L_emission} * (-1)^1.

So (-1)^L = (-1)^{L_emission + 1}.

Taking log base (-1), the exponents must be equal mod 2:

L ≡ L_emission + 1 mod 2.

So L_emission ≡ L -1 mod 2.

Alternatively, L_emission = (L -1) mod 2.

Now, the final NN state after emission has certain quantum numbers. Let's think about each option.

Each option gives a transition from 1S0 to some state, and the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum. So for each option, the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum is given by the letter, like p is l=1 (P state), f is l=3 (F state), etc.

Wait, the option format is something like 1S0 → something + letter. The letter denotes the angular momentum state of X. So the emitted particle X has orbital angular momentum l equal to the letter's value: S is 0, P is 1, D is 2, F is 3, etc.

So for each option, the emitted particle's orbital angular momentum (l) is given by the letter.

So let's go through each option.

Option A: 1S0 →7D1 + p.

Wait, the 7D1 probably refers to the final NN state. Let me parse this correctly. The initial state is 1S0. The final state is 7D1, and the emitted particle is p (l=1).

Wait, wait, wait, I think I'm misunderstanding the notation. The problem states: "the lowercase letter denotes the angular momentum state of X."

So in each option, the emitted particle X has a certain angular momentum state. For example, in option A, the emitted particle is p, which is l=1. So X has l=1.

So for each option:

Option A: 1S0 →7D1 + p. So X is p (l=1). The final NN state is 7D1. Let's parse 7D1: the notation is (2S+1)LJ. So 7D1 would be (2S+1) =7, so S=3. L is D, which is l=2. J is 1.

So S=3, L=2, J=1.

But wait, for the final NN state, the parity is (-1)^L. So L=2, so parity is (-1)^2 = +1.

Now, let's compute P_NN: (+1).

Earlier, we had P_NN = (-1)^L, so yes, that's correct.

Now, from earlier, we have:

L_emission ≡ L_NN -1 mod 2.

In this option, L_emission is l=1 (p), so L_emission=1.

L_NN is 2.

So 1 ≡ 2 -1 mod 2 → 1 ≡ 1 mod 2. Correct. So that's allowed.

Next, we have the Pauli statistics condition: T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2.

Wait, in the problem statement, Pauli requires that T = S + L +1 mod 2.

But the final state has T=0. So 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L =1 mod 2.

In this option, S=3 (since 7D1 has S=3), and L=2.

3 + 2 =5 → 5 mod 2 is 1. So 0 =1 mod 2? Wait, no. Wait, the condition is T = S + L +1 mod 2. The final T is 0. So 0 ≡ S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L +1 ≡0 mod 2 → S + L ≡1 mod 2. So 3+2=5 → 5 mod 2 is 1. So yes, 1 ≡1 mod 2. So condition holds. So this state is allowed. So option A is allowed.

Option B: 1S0 →3S1 + p.

So X is p (l=1). The final NN state is 3S1. Let's parse that: 3S1 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is S, which is l=0. J=1.

So parity of NN is (-1)^0=+1.

L_emission is 1. So L_emission=1.

Earlier equation: L_emission ≡ L_NN -1 mod 2.

L_NN is 0.

So 1 ≡0 -1 mod 2 → 1 ≡ -1 mod 2 → 1 ≡1 mod 2. Correct.

Now, check Pauli condition.

Final state: S=1, L=0.

So S + L =1+0=1 → 1 mod 2 is 1.

So 0 =1 +1 mod 2? Wait, no. Wait, condition is T= S + L +1 mod 2.

Wait, T is 0. So 0 ≡ (1) + (0) +1 mod 2 → 0 ≡ 2 mod 2 → 0 ≡0. Yes, that's correct.

So this option is allowed. So option B is allowed.

Option C: 1S0 →3D3 + f.

X is f, so l=3.

The final NN state is 3D3.

Parsing: 3D3 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is D, which is 2. J=3.

Parity of NN is (-1)^2 = +1.

L_emission is 3 (f).

Earlier equation: L_emission ≡ L_NN -1 mod 2.

L_NN is 2.

So 3 ≡2-1 mod 2 → 3 mod2 is 1. 2-1=1 mod2 → 1≡1. Correct.

Pauli condition:

S=1, L=2. So 1+2=3 →3 mod2 is 1.

So 0 ≡1+1 mod2 →0 ≡0. Correct.

So this option is allowed. So option C is allowed.

Option D: 1S0 →3P0 + s.

X is s, so l=0.

Final NN state is 3P0.

Parsing: 3P0 → (2S+1)=3 → S=1. L is P → l=1. J=0.

Wait, J is the total angular momentum, which is L + S. Wait, but J can be |L-S| to L+S in steps of 1. So for L=1 and S=1, possible J are 0,1,2.

So 3P0 has J=0, which is possible.

Parity of NN: (-1)^1 = -1.

Wait, but earlier we have parity considerations.

Wait, initial parity is +1. Final parity is P_NN * P_X * (-1)^{l_emission}.

P_NN is (-1)^1 = -1.

P_X is -1 (given).

l_emission is s → l=0. So (-1)^0=1.

So initial parity =1.

Final parity: (-1) * (-1) *1 = 1. So that's okay. Parity is conserved.

Wait, but according to our earlier equation, P_NN must equal (-1)^{L_emission +1}.

Wait, let's use the equation:

P_NN = (-1)^{L_emission +1}.

In this option, P_NN is -1 (since L=1).

L_emission is 0 (s state).

So (-1)^{0 +1} = (-1)^1 = -1. Which matches P_NN of -1.

So parity is conserved.

Now, let's check the Pauli condition.

S=1, L=1.

So S + L =2 → mod2 is 0.

So T= S + L +1 mod2 → 0 +1 =1 mod2. But the T is given as 0. So 0 ≡1 mod2? No, that's not correct.

Wait, the condition is T = S + L +1 mod2.

If T=0, then 0 ≡ (S + L +1) mod2.

In this case, S=1, L=1.

So 1 +1 +1 =3 →3 mod2=1.

So 0 ≡1 → which is false.

So this state doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition.

Wait, but wait, the Pauli condition is given as T = S + L +1 mod2. But in this case, the T is 0. So we have 0 ≡ (1 +1 +1) mod2 → 0 ≡1 → no. So this condition is not met. Therefore, this transition is not allowed.

So the partial wave that's not permitted is option D.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, in option D, the emitted particle has l=0 (s state). So L_emission=0.

From earlier condition, L_emission ≡ L_NN -1 mod2.

L_NN is 1 (P state).

So 0 ≡1 -1 → 0 ≡0 mod2. Correct.

But the Pauli condition is the issue here.

So the final state's S is 1, L is1.

So S + L +1 =1+1+1=3 → mod2=1.

But T is 0. So 0 ≡1 mod2 is false. So this condition is not satisfied, meaning this state is not allowed. Thus, option D is not permitted.

So the answer is option D.


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:

1. **Initial State and Parity Conservation**:  
   The initial state is **1S0**, where the orbital angular momentum \( L = 0 \) and the parity is \( (-1)^L = +1 \). When the two nucleons (NN) emit a particle \( X \) with intrinsic parity \( -1 \), the parity of the system must be conserved. The parity of the final state is given by:  
   \[
   P_{\text{initial}} = P_{\text{final NN}} \cdot P_X \cdot (-1)^{L_{\text{emission}}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( P_{\text{initial}} = +1 \), \( P_X = -1 \), and \( (-1)^{L_{\text{emission}}} \), we find:  
   \[
   1 = P_{\text{final NN}} \cdot (-1) \cdot (-1)^{L_{\text{emission}}}
   \]  
   Simplifying, \( P_{\text{final NN}} = (-1)^{L_{\text{emission}} + 1} \). For the final NN state, the parity is also \( (-1)^L \), where \( L \) is the orbital angular momentum of the final state. Equating these, we get:  
   \[
   L_{\text{emission}} \equiv L_{\text{final NN}} - 1 \pmod{2}.
   \]

2. **Pauli Statistics Condition**:  
   Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers satisfy:  
   \[
   T_{\text{NN}} = S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} + 1 \pmod{2}.
   \]  
   For the final state, \( T_{\text{NN}} = 0 \), so:  
   \[
   S_{\text{NN}} + L_{\text{NN}} \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.
   \]

3. **Analysis of Each Option**:  
   We analyze each option to check if the conditions are satisfied.

       \[
       0 \equiv 1 - 1 \pmod{2} \implies 0 \equiv 0 \pmod{2}.
       \]
