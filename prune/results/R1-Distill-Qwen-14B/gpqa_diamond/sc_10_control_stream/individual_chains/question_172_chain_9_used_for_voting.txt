Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about stars and their effective temperatures. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question says that iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level compared to star_2. And the energy difference between the levels is given as 1.38e-23 J. Oh wait, and the photospheres are in LTE, which I think stands for Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium. So, that probably means I can use the Boltzmann distribution here.

Right, Boltzmann distribution describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The formula is something like the ratio of populations in two energy levels. The formula is n_i / n_j = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -(E_i - E_j)/(k*T) ), where g is the statistical weight, E is the energy, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

In this problem, the energy difference ΔE is given as E_i - E_j = 1.38e-23 J. Wait, but I think the problem says that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited. So, the population in the higher energy level (n_i) for star_1 compared to star_2 is twice as much. Wait, let me get that right. The problem states that the iron atoms in star 1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level. So, does that mean the population in that energy level is higher by a factor of two? Or maybe the excitation (like the energy level being higher) is twice as much? Hmm, probably the population is twice as much.

Wait, no, actually, the question says "iron atoms... are twice as excited". Oh wait, perhaps it's the excitation energy. Or maybe the number of excited atoms is twice as much. Hmm, I think I might have to clarify. Oh, I think it's the number of atoms in that energy level. So, for star 1, n_i is twice that of star 2. So n_i1 / n_j1 = 2 * (n_i2 / n_j2) maybe? Or wait, no, each star's own distribution is considered. So for star 1, the ratio would be (n_i1)/(n_j1), and for star 2, (n_i2)/(n_j2). But the problem states that in star_1, the ratio is twice as much as in star_2. So n_i1/n_j1 = 2*(n_i2/n_j2). Hmm, but wait, maybe the problem says that the population in the excited state for star_1 is twice that of star_2. So that would mean n_i1 = 2 n_i2, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio of n_i to n_j is twice as large in star_1 compared to star_2.

Wait, the question says, "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to the iron atoms in star_2." So, it's about the excitation in that specific level. Maybe the number of excited atoms in that level (n_i) is twice as much for star_1. Or perhaps the excitation is twice as high, which would relate to the energy, but I don't think that's the case because the energy difference is given. So I think it's about the population ratio.

But wait, maybe the relative population ratio. Let me think: if star_1's population ratio (n_i/n_j) is twice that of star_2's. So (n_i1/n_j1) = 2*(n_i2/n_j2). Or is it that n_i1 = 2 * n_i2? I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem says that the ratio of n_i to n_j in star_1 is twice that in star_2. So (n_i1/n_j1) = 2*(n_i2/n_j2). That seems more plausible.

But let's think again. The question says "iron atoms in the photosphere of star_1 are twice as excited in a specific energy level when compared to star_2." So, perhaps the number of atoms in that specific excited energy level in star_1 is twice as many as in star_2. So for each star, the ratio would be (n_i)/(n_j) = something, where n_i is the excited state population.

Wait, but each star's own ratio depends on their own temperature. So for star_1, the ratio is (n_i1)/(n_j1) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) ). Similarly for star_2, it's (n_i2)/(n_j2) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) ). Given that the problem states that star_1's atoms are twice as excited, perhaps n_i1 = 2 * n_i2. Or wait, maybe (n_i1)/(n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2)/(n_j2). Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "twice as excited in a specific energy level". Assuming that this refers to the ratio of the number of atoms in that level compared to, perhaps, the lower level. So, in star_1, the ratio (n_i1/n_j1) is twice that of star_2's (n_i2/n_j2). So,

(n_i1/n_j1) = 2 * (n_i2/n_j2).

But the problem gives the energy difference as 1.38e-23 J. So, using the Boltzmann factor, which is exp( -ΔE/(k*T) ).

So, for star_1, (n_i1/n_j1) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T1) )

Similarly, for star_2, (n_i2/n_j2) = (g_i/g_j) * exp( -ΔE/(k*T2) )

Wait, but g_i and g_j are the statistical weights of the respective energy levels. Are they the same for both stars? Probably yes, because the same element (iron) is considered. So g_i/g_j is a constant factor, same for both stars.

So, taking the ratio of the two equations:

(n_i1/n_j1) / (n_i2/n_j2) ) = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

And according to the problem, this ratio is 2, because (n_i1/n_j1) is twice (n_i2/n_j2).

So,

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Taking natural log on both sides,

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but wait: 1/T2 -1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Hmm, not sure. Let me compute 1/T2 -1/T1:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 )

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) = ln(2)

So rearranging,

ln(2) = [ ΔE/(k) ) ] * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Wait, but the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. And Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, wait, that's interesting. Let me compute ΔE/(k):

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J = k * (1 K) because k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * T, where T is 1 K.

So,

ΔE/(k) = (k * 1 K ) / k = 1.

So, ΔE/(k) = 1.

Substituting back into the equation,

ln(2) = [ 1 ] * (T1 - T2) / ( T1 T2 )

Which simplifies to,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Hmm, looking at the options, let's see.

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Which would match our equation.

So the correct equation is option D.

To solve the problem, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the two energy levels, \(g_i\) and \(g_j\) are their statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the population ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in the specific energy level compared to star_2. This implies:

\[
\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}}.
\]

Taking the ratio of the two population ratios:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}}}{\frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} \cdot \frac{n_{j2}}{n_{i2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since the ratio is given as 2:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rewriting \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) as \(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), and Boltzmann's constant \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Thus, \(\Delta E / k = 1\). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. Therefore, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

(n_i1/n_j1) / (n_i2/n_j2) ) = [ exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( ΔE/(k) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

And according to the problem, this ratio is 2, because (n_i1/n_j1) is twice (n_i2/n_j2).

So,

exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = 2

Taking natural log on both sides,

ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) ) = ln(2)

Wait, but wait: 1/T2 -1/T1 is (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Hmm, not sure. Let me compute 1/T2 -1/T1:

1/T2 - 1/T1 = (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 )

So,

ΔE/(k) * (T1 - T2)/( T1 T2 ) = ln(2)

So rearranging,

ln(2) = [ ΔE/(k) ) ] * (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Wait, but the problem gives ΔE as 1.38e-23 J. And Boltzmann's constant k is about 1.38e-23 J/K. Oh, wait, that's interesting. Let me compute ΔE/(k):

ΔE = 1.38e-23 J = k * (1 K) because k is 1.38e-23 J/K. So ΔE = k * T, where T is 1 K.

So,

ΔE/(k) = (k * 1 K ) / k = 1.

So, ΔE/(k) = 1.

Substituting back into the equation,

ln(2) = [ 1 ] * (T1 - T2) / ( T1 T2 )

Which simplifies to,

ln(2) = (T1 - T2) / (T1 T2 )

Option D says ln(2) = (T1 - T2)/(T1 T2). Which would match our equation.

To solve the problem, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the population ratio of atoms in two energy levels under Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations in two energy levels is given by:

\[
\frac{n_i}{n_j} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \(n_i\) and \(n_j\) are the populations of the two energy levels, \(g_i\) and \(g_j\) are their statistical weights, \(\Delta E\) is the energy difference between the levels, \(k\) is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T\) is the temperature.

For star_1 and star_2, the population ratios are:

\[
\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right),
\]
\[
\frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}} = \frac{g_i}{g_j} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right).
\]

The problem states that the atoms in star_1 are twice as excited in the specific energy level compared to star_2. This implies:

\[
\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} = 2 \cdot \frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}}.
\]

Taking the ratio of the two population ratios:

\[
\frac{\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}}}{\frac{n_{i2}}{n_{j2}}} = \frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_1}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T_2}\right)}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{n_{i1}}{n_{j1}} \cdot \frac{n_{j2}}{n_{i2}} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Since the ratio is given as 2:

\[
2 = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right).
\]

Rewriting \(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\) as \(\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}\):

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{\Delta E}{k} \cdot \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

The energy difference \(\Delta E\) is given as \(1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}\), and Boltzmann's constant \(k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\). Thus, \(\Delta E / k = 1\). Substituting this into the equation:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

This matches the form of option D. Therefore, the correct equation is:

\[
\ln(2) = \frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}.
\]

Answer: D
