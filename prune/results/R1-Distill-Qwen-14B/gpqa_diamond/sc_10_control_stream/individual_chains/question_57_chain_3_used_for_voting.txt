Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that involves the scattering of particles where the kinetic energy is conserved, so no energy is lost. But wait, the question is about phase shifts and the scattering amplitude. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts.

The given phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°, and the rest are ignored. So I think for s-wave scattering (l=0), the phase shift is δ₀, and for higher angular momentum states l=1,2,3,4, etc., the phase shifts are δ₁, δ₂, etc. But the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f(k,θ) in partial wave expansion is a sum over all angular momentum states. The formula I remember is f(k,θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l / (1 + e^{2iδ_l}) ) * ... Wait, no, maybe that's not exactly right. Or is it f(k,θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum over l [ (2l+1) (e^{iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) ) ].

Wait, when I think about it, the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(k,θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (2l + 1) (e^{iδ_l} - 1) P_l (cosθ) ]

But the question is asking about the imaginary part along the incident direction. The incident beam direction, I think, is when θ=0°, because that's the direction of the incoming particle. So cosθ would be 1. So the associated Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is... Oh right, P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because P_l(1) = 1 for all l. So f(k,θ=0) would then be (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (2l +1)(e^{iδ_l} - 1) ].

But wait, the expression (e^{iδ_l} -1) can be expanded as e^{iδ_l} = cosδ_l + i sinδ_l. So e^{iδ_l} -1 = (cosδ_l -1) + i sinδ_l.

So the imaginary part of f(k,θ=0) would come from the imaginary parts of each term in the sum. So each term contributes (2l+1) * sinδ_l multiplied by i, and then divided by 2ik.

Wait, let's break it down. The entire expression f is (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l+1) (e^{iδ_l} -1) ]

The imaginary part of f, Im(f), is the imaginary part of [ (1/(2ik)) * sum ... ]

Let me think about this. Let's write 1/(2ik) as -i/(2k), because 1/i = -i. So 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k).

So f = [sum (2l+1)(e^{iδ_l} -1 ) ] * (-i/(2k)).

So the sum is over l=0,1,2,3,4 (since the phase shifts are given up to δ4). 

Expanding each term in the sum:

sum = sum [ (2l+1) ( (cosδ_l -1) + i sinδ_l ) ]

Which can be split into real and imaginary parts. But since we're interested in Im(f), we can focus on the imaginary parts of the sum.

The sum's imaginary part is sum [ (2l+1) * sinδ_l ] for each l. Let's compute that.

So for each l, the coefficient is (2l+1) sinδ_l.

Let me compute each term:

For l=0:
(2*0 +1) * sin(90°) = 1 * 1 = 1.

l=1:
(3)* sin(67°). Let's calculate that. Sin(67) is approx 0.9205. So 3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:
5 * sin(55°). Sin(55) is about 0.8192. 5 * 0.8192 ≈4.096.

l=3:
7 * sin(30°). Sin(30)=0.5. 7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:
9 * sin(13°). Sin(13)= approx 0.22495. 9 *0.22495 ≈2.02455.

Now summing these up: 1 + 2.7615 = 3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455≈13.38205.

So the imaginary part of the sum is approximately 13.382.

Now, going back to f, the imaginary part is the imaginary part of [ (-i/(2k)) * sum ], which is [ (-i/(2k)) * (sum_real + i sum_imag) ) ]

Wait, let me think again. The sum has a real part and an imaginary part. But in our case, the sum we calculated is just the imaginary part. Let me double-check. The sum is sum ( (cosδ_l -1) + i sinδ_l ) multiplied by (2l+1). So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sinδ_l. So the sum's imaginary part is the sum of those.

So the sum is [ sum_real + i sum_imag ].

But when we multiply by (-i/(2k)), which is a purely imaginary factor, the imaginary part of f comes from the real part of the sum multiplied by (-i^2)/(2k) ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute Im(f) directly.

f = [ (sum_real + i sum_imag) ] * [ -i/(2k) ]

Multiply this out:

f = sum_real * (-i/(2k)) ) + sum_imag * ( (-i^2)/(2k) )

Because (i * -i) = -i^2 = 1.

So:

sum_real * (-i/(2k)) contributes to the imaginary part of f.

sum_imag * ( (-i^2)/(2k) ) = sum_imag * (1/(2k)) which contributes to the real part of f.

Therefore, the imaginary part of f is sum_real * (-1/(2k)).

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, f = (sum_real + i sum_imag) * (-i/(2k)).

Multiplying out:

sum_real * (-i/(2k)) + i sum_imag * (-i/(2k)).

First term: sum_real * (-i/(2k)) → this is imaginary.

Second term: i * (-i) = -i² = 1. So second term is sum_imag/(2k) → this is real.

So the imaginary part of f is [ (- sum_real ) / (2k) ].

Because the first term is (sum_real * (-i) ) / (2k), so the coefficient is -sum_real/(2k) multiplied by i. So the imaginary part is -sum_real/(2k).

Wait, but sum_real is the real part of the sum, which is sum [ (2l+1)(cosδ_l -1) ].

So let's compute sum_real:

For each l:

l=0: (1)(cos90 -1) = 1*(0 -1) = -1.

l=1: 3*(cos67 -1) ≈3*(0.3907 -1) =3*(-0.6093)= -1.8279.

l=2:5*(cos55 -1)≈5*(0.5736 -1)=5*(-0.4264)= -2.132.

l=3:7*(cos30 -1 )≈7*(0.8660 -1)=7*(-0.1340)= -0.938.

l=4:9*(cos13 -1)≈9*(0.9744 -1)=9*(-0.0256)= -0.2304.

Now sum all these up:

-1 + (-1.8279) = -2.8279.

-2.8279 + (-2.132) = -4.9599.

-4.9599 + (-0.938) = -5.8979.

-5.8979 + (-0.2304) = -6.1283.

So sum_real ≈ -6.1283.

So the imaginary part of f, Im(f) = (- sum_real )/(2k) = (6.1283)/(2k).

Wait but k is the wave number. The question says electrons of 50 MeV. How do I find k?

I remember that the wave number k is given by the formula k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but wait, more accurately, the formula for the kinetic energy is E = (ħ²k²)/(2m). So k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

But since the units are in MeV, perhaps I should use natural units where ħ= c=1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can compute k in appropriate units.

Wait, actually, the problem asks for the imaginary part in fm (femtometers), so I need to make sure the units are correct.

Electron mass m is about 0.511 MeV/c².

Wait, that's the rest mass. So E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than m, so relativistic effects might be significant, but perhaps the problem expects a non-relativistic approach.

Alternatively, since electrons are light, but 50 MeV is 93.8 times the rest mass of an electron (since 0.511 MeV is the rest energy). So perhaps relativistic considerations are needed.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the non-relativistic expression for k.

In non-relativistic mechanics, E ≈ (ħ²k²)/(2m). So k = sqrt(2m E) / ħ.

But when E is much larger than m, non-relativistic might not hold. Hmm. But perhaps the problem expects the non-relativistic approach regardless.

Alternatively, using the relativistic energy relation, but I'm not sure.

Let me proceed with the non-relativistic approach.

So E = 50 MeV. m is the electron mass, 0.511 MeV/c².

But using natural units where ħ=1, c=1, E (in MeV) is equal to (k²/(2m)) * ħ² c². Wait, perhaps I should convert to SI units.

Alternatively, perhaps use the formula for k in terms of energy.

Wait, the expression for k is sqrt(2mE)/(ħ). But in terms of units, E should be in Joules, m in kg, ħ in J·s.

But that's a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps use the following approach.

The electron's rest energy is m c² = 0.511 MeV. E = 50 MeV. So the kinetic energy is K = E - m c² = 50 - 0.511 ≈49.489 MeV.

But if we're using the non-relativistic formula, E ≈ K + m c². Hmm, perhaps it's better to proceed with E = (ħ² k²)/(2m), so solving for k:

k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ.

But I need to compute this with E in Joules.

Let me compute E in Joules.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 1 MeV = 1e6 eV = 1.602e-13 J.

So E =50 MeV = 50 *1.602e-13 J ≈8.01e-12 J.

m is the electron mass, which is 9.109e-31 kg.

ħ is Planck's constant divided by 2π, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So plug into k:

k = sqrt(2 * m * E) / ħ.

Compute numerator first: 2 * m * E = 2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-12 J.

Wait, 2 *9.109e-31 =1.8218e-30.

Multiply by 8.01e-12: 1.8218e-30 *8.01e-12 = approx 1.46e-41.

Take sqrt: sqrt(1.46e-41) ≈ 3.82e-21 m^-1.

Denominator is ħ ≈1.0546e-34 J·s.

So k = 3.82e-21 / 1.0546e-34 ≈ 3.62e13 m^-1.

Wait, that's a very large k. But considering the energy is 50 MeV, which is high, perhaps that's correct.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, 2mE = 2 * m * E.

m =9.109e-31 kg.

E=50 MeV =50 * 1e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV =50 *1.602e-13 J=8.01e-12 J.

So 2mE = 2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-12.

Compute 9.109e-31 *8.01e-12 = approx 7.298e-42.

Multiply by 2: 1.4596e-41.

Take square root: sqrt(1.4596e-41) = approx 3.82e-21 m^-1 (since sqrt(1e-42)=1e-21). So yes, that's correct.

Then k = 3.82e-21 / 1.0546e-34 ≈3.62e13 m^-1.

Wait, but this seems very large. Hmm. But perhaps that's correct for high energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects relativistic considerations, but I'm not sure.

Now, back to Im(f) = (6.1283) / (2k) * (1 fm) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for Im(f) is Im(f)= (- sum_real )/(2k) → (6.1283)/(2k). But wait, because sum_real is negative, so -sum_real is positive.

Wait, no, let me go back. The sum_real is the sum of (2l+1)(cosδ_l -1), which we calculated as approximately -6.1283. So Im(f) is (-sum_real)/(2k). So that would be 6.1283/(2k).

But wait, no. Let me get the exact expression.

Earlier, I found that the imaginary part of f is [(- sum_real) ] / (2k).

Wait, no, earlier conclusion was that Im(f) = (sum_real) * (-1/(2k)).

Wait, no, Im(f) comes from the first term of the multiplication, which was sum_real * (-i/(2k)).

So the imaginary part of that term is (sum_real) * (-1/(2k)).

Because the term is (sum_real) * (-i/(2k)) = (-i sum_real )/(2k), so the imaginary part is (- sum_real )/(2k) multiplied by i.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the signs. Let me write it more carefully.

The first term is sum_real * (-i/(2k)).

sum_real is real, so the term is a purely imaginary number: (sum_real) * (-i) / (2k) = [ -i sum_real ]/(2k).

So the imaginary part of this term is [ - sum_real ]/(2k).

But the second term, sum_imag/(2k), is real, so it doesn't contribute to the imaginary part.

Therefore, Im(f) = [ - sum_real ]/(2k).

Wait, but sum_real is negative, so [ - sum_real ] is positive.

So Im(f) = [ positive number ]/(2k).

So plugging in sum_real ≈-6.1283, so -sum_real ≈6.1283.

So Im(f) = 6.1283/(2k).

But k is 3.62e13 m^-1.

So 2k ≈7.24e13 m^-1.

So 6.1283 / (7.24e13) ≈8.46e-14 m.

Wait, but the options are in femtometers. 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

So 8.46e-14 m = 84.6 fm. Wait, but none of the options are 84.6.

Wait, but wait. Did I make a mistake? Because 3.62e13 m^-1 is 3.62e13 per meter. 1/(3.62e13) m is about 2.76e-14 m, which is 27.6 fm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, let's recompute k.

Wait, E =50 MeV. But when E is much larger than m c², the non-relativistic formula isn't accurate. Instead, perhaps I should use the relativistic formula.

Wait, the relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). For electrons, when the kinetic energy is much higher than m c^2, the momentum p is approximately E/c. So p ≈ E/(c).

But then, the wave number k is related to momentum by p = ħ k.

So k = p/ħ ≈ E/(c ħ).

Wait, let's compute k that way.

E =50 MeV =50e6 eV.

Convert E to Joules: 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J =8.01e-13 J.

c is 3e8 m/s.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So k = E/(c ħ) =8.01e-13 J / (3e8 m/s * 1.0545718e-34 J·s) )

Compute denominator:3e8 * 1.05457e-34 =3.1637e-26.

So k =8.01e-13 / 3.1637e-26 ≈2.532e13 m^-1.

Wait, same order of magnitude as before.

Hmm, but perhaps using the relativistic approach, the k is about 2.5e13 m^-1.

So going back: Im(f) =6.1283/(2k) =6.1283/(2 *2.532e13) =6.1283/(5.064e13) ≈1.209e-13 m.

Convert to fm: 1e-15 m is 1 fm. So 1.209e-13 m =120.9 fm.

Wait, but none of the options are near 120.9. The options given are 87163.4 fm (A), 355.351 (B), 177.675 (C), 251.271 (D).

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, f(k,θ=0), but in a specific unit system where k is expressed differently. Or perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the expression for f(k,θ) is not (1/(2ik)) sum... but something else.

Wait, another formula I found is that the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(k,θ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) (e^{iδ_l} -1 ) (P_l (cosθ)) ]

But in some conventions, it's (1/(2ik)) sum [(2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l / (1 + e^{2iδ_l}) ) ] ?

No, perhaps I'm mixing different derivations.

Alternatively, another approach: the scattering amplitude for each partial wave is f_l = (2l +1)/(k) [ e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ].

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the total scattering amplitude is the sum over l of f_l * (2l+1) P_l (cosθ), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

Wait, the optical theorem states that the total cross-section is proportional to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. The formula is σ_total = 4π |f(0)|^2, but that's for the differential cross-section. No, wait, the optical theorem says σ_total = 4π (k Im f(0) ), where f(0) is the forward scattering amplitude.

Wait, so Im f(0) = (σ_total)/(4π k).

But I don't know the total cross-section here. So that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I should use is Im(f) = (k/(2π)) Σ [ (2l+1) sinδ_l ].

Wait, that rings a bell. Because in partial wave analysis, the imaginary part of the amplitude at θ=0 is given by Im f(0) = (k/(2π)) Σ (2l+1) sinδ_l.

Ah, maybe that's the correct formula. So I might have been using the wrong approach earlier.

So let's try this again. If Im f(0) = (k/(2π)) * sum [ (2l+1) sinδ_l ].

So compute that sum.

Compute (2l+1) sinδ_l for each l:

l=0:1 * sin90 =1*1=1.

l=1:3 * sin67 ≈3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin55≈5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin30=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin13≈9*0.22495=2.02455.

Sum these: 1 +2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455≈13.382.

So sum =13.382.

Now, Im f(0) = (k/(2π)) * 13.382.

But what's k? Earlier, using E=50 MeV, I found k≈2.53e13 m^-1.

So Im f(0)= (2.53e13 m^-1 / (2π)) ) *13.382.

Compute that: 2.53e13/(2π) ≈(2.53e13)/(6.2832) ≈4.026e12.

Multiply by 13.382: 4.026e12 *13.382 ≈5.387e13.

But the units would be (m^-1) * (dimensionless) → m^-1.

Wait, but the options are in fm. 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so 1e15 fm^{-1}.

Wait, no. Wait, the scattering amplitude f is dimensionless in what unit? Or perhaps in units where ħ=1, c=1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f has units of (length)^{-1}. Because the cross-section is σ = |f|^2 * (4π/k^2), perhaps? Or wait, the cross-section is dσ/dΩ = |f|^2.

Wait, no, in natural units where ħ=1, c=1, the cross-section has units of barns, which are (1e-28 m²). Scattering amplitude f is in units of (length), because cross-section is |f|^2 multiplied by (something).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of units.

The scattering amplitude f has units of (length). Because when you calculate the differential cross-section, it's dσ/dΩ = |f|^2 * (something), and cross-section has units of area (m²), so f must be in m.

Wait, but our calculation gave Im(f) in m^-1. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the formula.

Wait, the formula I found online is:

Im(f) = (k/(2π)) * sum [ (2l+1) sinδ_l ]

So, with k in units of m^-1, Im(f) would have units of (m^-1) * (dimensionless) = m^-1.

But the options are in fm, which is 1e-15 m. So perhaps I should convert the result from m^-1 to fm.

Wait, if Im(f) is in m^{-1}, then 1/(m^-1) is m. So to get Im(f) in fm, perhaps we need to invert.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula gives Im(f) in units of (m^{-1} ), because k is in m^{-1}.

But the options are in fm, which is a length. So perhaps the formula gives the imaginary part in (1/m), but the question is expecting a value in fm.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if f is in units of 1/m, then 1/(1/m) is m, which is a length.

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but I have to compute Im(f) and then convert it into fm.

Wait, let me compute Im(f):

Im(f) = (k/(2π)) * sum [ (2l+1) sinδ_l ]

k =2.53e13 m^-1.

sum =13.382.

So Im(f)= (2.53e13)/(2π) *13.382 → compute 2.53e13/(6.2832) ≈4.025e12.

Multiply by13.382: 4.025e12 *13.382 ≈5.386e13.

So Im(f)=5.386e13 m^-1.

Wait, but that's 5.386e13 per meter.

Wait, but I'm supposed to get the imaginary part in fm. Hmm. That doesn't seem to align.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another source says that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at forward direction is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) * sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ) ].

Wait, no, that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = (1/k) * sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ].

Wait, if I use that formula, Im(f)= (1/k) * sum [ (2l+1) sinδ_l ].

Which would be (1/k) *13.382.

k is 2.53e13 m^-1 → 1/k =3.95e-14 m.

So Im(f)=13.382 *3.95e-14 ≈5.28e-13 m.

Which is 528 fm.

But that's not matching any of the options either.

Wait, the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, none of these are near 528 fm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The scattering amplitude f is given by:

f = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l +1) (e^{iδ_l} -1 ) P_l (cosθ) ]

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l+1)(e^{iδ_l} -1) ]

So the imaginary part is Im(f(0)) = [1/(2k)] * sum [ (2l+1) Re( e^{iδ_l} -1 ) ]

Wait, no, because e^{iδ} -1 = cosδ +i sinδ -1 = (cosδ-1) +i sinδ.

So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum [ (2l+1) ( (cosδ -1) + i sinδ ) ]

Which can be written as (1/(2ik)) [ sum_r (2l+1)(cosδ-1) + i sum_i (2l+1) sinδ ]

So the real part of f(0) is Re(f) = [ sum_r (2l+1)(cosδ-1) ] / (2k )

The imaginary part of f(0) is Im(f) = [ sum_i (2l+1) sinδ ] / (2k )

Ah, okay, so Im(f)= [ sum (2l+1) sinδ ]/(2k )

So now, the sum is 13.382 as before.

So Im(f) =13.382/(2k )

k is 2.53e13 m^-1.

So 2k=5.06e13 m^-1.

So Im(f)=13.382/(5.06e13 m^-1) → 2.644e-13 m.

Convert to fm: 2.644e-13 m =264.4 fm.

But that's not one of the options either. The closest option is D)251.271 fm.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k correctly using the relativistic energy.

E =50 MeV. The total energy is E = K + m c², but for high energies, E ≈ K.

But for the relativistic relation, p = gamma m v.

Wait, but in terms of wave number, k = p / ħ.

So p = gamma m v. But for high energies, gamma is large.

Alternatively, using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So E² = p² c^4 + m² c^4.

So p = sqrt( E² - m² c^4 ) / c^2.

But for E >> m c², p ≈ E/c.

So p ≈ E/(c).

So k = p/ħ ≈ E/(c ħ).

E is 50 MeV.

Wait, but E should be in units compatible with c and ħ.

Let me compute E in Joules again:50 MeV =50e6 * 1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.

c=3e8 m/s.

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So k= (8.01e-13 J) / (3e8 m/s * 1.0545718e-34 J·s )

k=8.01e-13 / (3.1637e-26) ≈2.532e13 m^-1.

Same as before.

So Im(f)=13.382/(2 *2.532e13) =13.382/(5.064e13) ≈2.644e-13 m =264.4 fm.

But the options don't have 264.4; the closest is D)251.271 fm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum more accurately.

Let me re-calculate sum (2l+1) sinδ_l:

l=0:1 * sin90=1.

l=1:3 * sin67. Let me compute sin(67) accurately.

Sin(67 degrees) = sin(1.16937 radians) ≈0.920504.

3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin55. Sin(55)≈0.819152. 5 *0.819152≈4.09576.

l=3:7 * sin30=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin13. Sin(13)=0.224951. 9 *0.224951≈2.02456.

Summing:

1 +2.7615=3.7615.

+4.09576=7.85726.

+3.5=11.35726.

+2.02456=13.38182.

So sum=13.38182.

So Im(f)=13.38182/(2*2.532e13) =13.38182/(5.064e13) =2.643e-13 m=264.3 fm.

Hmm. But the options don't have 264.3. The closest is D)251.271 fm.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is multiplied by k/(2π), not divided.

Wait, alternative approach: I found a source that says the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by Im(f(0)) = (k/(2π)) * sum [ (2l+1) sinδ_l ].

So Im(f(0)) = (k/(2π)) * sum.

Sum is 13.38182.

k=2.532e13 m^-1.

So Im(f)= (2.532e13)/(2π) *13.38182.

Compute 2.532e13/(2π)= approx 2.532e13/(6.2832)=4.025e12.

Multiply by 13.38182:4.025e12 *13.38182≈5.386e13.

But that's 5.386e13 m^-1. That's 5.386e13 per meter.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are in fm, which is a length.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Another source says that the total cross-section is given by σ_total = 4π (k Im f(0) ), so Im f(0) = σ_total/(4π k).

But without knowing σ_total, I can't use that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) * sum [ (2l+1) sinδ_l ].

Which would give Im(f)=13.38182/(2*2.532e13)=13.38182/(5.064e13)=2.643e-13 m=264.3 fm.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let's compute the sum again:

l=0:1*1=1.

l=1:3*sin67=3*0.920504=2.761512.

l=2:5 *0.819152=4.09576.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9*0.224951=2.024559.

Sum is 1+2.761512=3.761512 +4.09576=7.857272 +3.5=11.357272 +2.024559=13.381831.

So sum=13.381831.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses only even l, or perhaps the question counts l starting from 0 and gives up to l=4.

Wait, another possibility is that I should compute the sum as [ (2l+1) sinδ_l ] for each l=0 to 4.

Yes, which I did. So sum=13.381831.

But perhaps the question expects to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond l=4, which I think I accounted for.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k differently. Let me try using the relativistic formula for k.

In relativistic terms, the energy E is given by E = sqrt( p² c^4 + m² c^4 ).

So p = sqrt( E² - m² c^4 ) / c^2.

Wait, but E is 50 MeV. m c^2 is 0.511 MeV.

So E >> m c², so p ≈ E/(c²) * c = E/(c).

Wait, that's the same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recompute:

k = p / ħ.

p = E/(c).

So k= E/(c ħ).

E=50 MeV =50e6 * 1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.

c=3e8 m/s.

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So k=8.01e-13 / (3e8 *1.0545718e-34 )=8.01e-13/(3.1637e-26)= approx 2.532e13 m^-1.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the question is using a different unit for E, like E in eV, and I messed up the conversion. Wait, no, I used 50 MeV correctly.

Wait, perhaps the formula for k is different when using MeV. Let me think: The wave number k can be expressed in terms of E in MeV as:

k (fm^{-1}) = (E (MeV) ) / (ħ c) ).

Wait, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

So k = E / (ħ c) ) =50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that's a very different k.

Wait, perhaps that's the right way to compute k.

Because 1 fm^{-1} is 1e15 m^{-1}.

So 0.253 fm^{-1}=2.53e14 m^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps that's correct.

So let me compute k using this formula.

k = E/(ħ c) ) =50 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f)= (sum)/(2k) )=13.381831/(2 *0.253) )=13.381831/(0.506 )≈26.44 fm^{-1}.

Wait, but that's 26.44 fm^{-1} which is 26.44 *1e15 m^{-1}=2.644e14 m^{-1}.

But that doesn't make sense because earlier calculation gave k=2.53e13 m^{-1}, which is 0.253e14 m^{-1} = 25.3 fm^{-1}.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So k = p / ħ = (E c)/(ħ c^2) ) / ħ = E c/(ħ^2 c^2 )= E/(ħ c).

Hmm, perhaps not. Let's compute k in fm^{-1}.

k = E (MeV) / ( ħ c (MeV fm) ) → units: MeV / (MeV fm) )= 1/fm.

So k=50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm )=50/197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Thus, k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f)= sum/(2k )=13.381831/(2*0.253 )=13.381831/(0.506 )≈26.44 fm^{-1}.

But that's 26.44 per fm.

Wait, but the options are in fm, so perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (sum) * ( ħ c )/(2 E ).

Because then, the units would be MeV fm / (MeV ) → fm.

So let me try that.

sum is 13.381831.

Im(f)=13.381831 * (197.33 MeV fm )/(2 *50 MeV ) )=13.381831 *197.33/(100 )=13.381831 *1.9733≈26.43 fm.

But again, not matching any options.

Wait, but if I use the earlier approach where k=2.53e13 m^-1, then Im(f)= sum/(2k) =13.381831/(2 *2.53e13 )=2.643e-13 m=264.3 fm.

Which is 264.3 fm.

But none of the options match that. The closest option is D)251.271 fm.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Wait, let me recompute the sum with more precise delta values.

Compute each (2l+1) sinδ_l:

l=0: 1 * sin90 =1.

l=1:3 * sin67 =3 * sin(1.16937 rad)=3 *0.920504≈2.761512.

l=2:5 * sin55=5 * sin(0.95993 rad)=5 *0.819152≈4.09576.

l=3:7 * sin30=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin13=9 * sin(0.22689 rad)=9 *0.224951≈2.024559.

Sum:

1 +2.761512 =3.761512.

+4.09576=7.857272.

+3.5=11.357272.

+2.024559=13.381831.

So sum=13.381831.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum with more precise sine values.

For l=1, δ=67 degrees:

Sin(67)=sin(1.16937)≈0.920504.

3 *0.920504=2.761512.

For l=2, δ=55 degrees:

Sin(55)=sin(0.95993)=0.819152044.

5 *0.819152044=4.09576022.

l=4, δ=13 degrees:

Sin(13)=sin(0.22689)=0.224951054.

9 *0.224951054=2.02455949.

So sum remains 13.38183.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the formula Im(f) = 8π /k * sum [ (2l+1) sinδ_l ].

Wait, why would that be? Because sometimes factors can vary based on conventions.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = (sum) * (ħ c )/(2 E ).

So:

Im(f)=13.381831 * (197.33 MeV fm )/(2 *50 MeV )=13.381831 *1.9733≈26.44 fm.

But option C is 177.675 fm, which is about 6.68 times larger.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing a factor of π somewhere.

Wait, if I use the formula Im(f) = (k/(2π)) * sum.

With k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f)=0.253/(2π) *13.381831≈0.253/(6.2832) *13.381831≈0.04017 *13.381831≈0.538 fm.

No, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (sum) * (1/(2k)).

So sum=13.381831.

k=2.53e13 m^-1.

So Im(f)=13.381831/(2*2.53e13 m^-1 )=13.381831/(5.06e13 m^-1 )=2.643e-13 m=264.3 fm.

But again, not in the options.

Wait, the options are A)87163.4 fm, which is 8.7e4 fm, B)355.35, C)177.7, D)251.27.

Hmm. Perhaps the calculation requires including the sum for all l, but the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond l=4.

Wait, perhaps the formula has a factor of 2. Let me check.

If I use Im(f)= sum * (1/(k)).

So Im(f)=13.381831/(2.53e13 m^-1 )=5.29e-13 m=529 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: the scattering amplitude f has units of length. So if Im(f) is 264 fm, but that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute k using E in MeV and the formula k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

Wait, let me try that.

E=50 MeV.

m= electron mass=0.511 MeV/c².

So E=50 MeV.

k= sqrt(2m E)/ħ.

But with E in MeV, m in MeV/c², and ħ in MeV s / (c), perhaps the units will work out.

Wait, in natural units, c=1, ħ=1. So k = sqrt(2 m E).

But m is in MeV/c² → since c=1, m =0.511 MeV.

So k= sqrt(2 * 0.511 MeV *50 MeV )=sqrt(51.1 ) MeV ≈7.15 MeV.

But that's in terms of MeV, but I need k in units of 1/fm.

Using ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

So k (in 1/fm) = [ sqrt(2 m E) ] / ħ c.

Wait, no, let me think in terms of units.

k (in 1/fm) = (sqrt(2 m E )) / ( ħ c )

Because sqrt(2mE) has units of MeV, and ħ c is MeV fm.

So  MeV / (MeV fm )=1/fm.

So compute sqrt(2 *0.511 *50 )=sqrt(51.1 )≈7.15 MeV.

So k=7.15 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm )=7.15/197.33 ≈0.0362 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f)= sum/(2k )=13.381831/(2 *0.0362 )=13.381831/0.0724≈185 fm.

Wait, 13.381831/0.0724≈185.

But option C is 177.675 fm, which is close.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Compute sqrt(2 *0.511 *50 )=sqrt(51.1)=7.15 MeV.

k=7.15 /197.33 = approximately 0.0362 fm^{-1}.

Im(f)=13.381831/(2 *0.0362 )=13.381831/0.0724.

Compute 13.381831 ÷0.0724.

0.0724 * 184= approx 13.3136.

Which is close to 13.381831.

So 184 is roughly the value.

But 13.381831/0.0724= approximately 184.8 fm.

Which is close to option C (177.675) and D (251.271).

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum/(k).

Which would be 13.381831/0.0362≈369.6 fm.

Which is not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me re-examine the formula.

Earlier, I thought that Im(f)= sum/(2k).

But perhaps the correct formula is Im(f)= sum/(k).

So Im(f)=13.381831 /0.0362≈369.6 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula Im(f)= sum * (ħ c )/(2 E ).

Because sum is dimensionless, ħ c is in MeV fm, E in MeV.

So Im(f)=13.381831 * (197.33 MeV fm )/(2*50 MeV )=13.381831 * (197.33)/(100 )=13.381831 *1.9733≈26.44 fm.

But again, that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= (2 sum )/(k).

Which would be 2*13.381831/(0.0362 )=26.763662/0.0362≈739.3 fm.

Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f)= (2 sum )/(k) )=26.763662/0.0362≈739 fm.

No match.

Hmm. I must be missing something here. Looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option D, which is approximately 251.27 fm.

Wait, if I compute sum/(k) where k=0.0362 fm^{-1}.

sum=13.381831.

13.381831/0.0362≈369.6 fm.

Not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, when I compute k using non-relativistic formula, I get k=2.53e13 m^-1=25.3 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f)=13.381831/(2*25.3 )=13.381831/50.6≈0.2643 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is not among the options, but given the choices, the closest is option D:251.271 fm.

But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the sum is 13.381831.

If Im(f)= sum * (ħ c )/(2 E ), then:

Im(f) =13.381831 * (197.33)/(2*50 )=13.381831 *1.9733≈26.44 fm.

But not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= (sum) * (2π)/(k).

Which would be:

sum=13.381831.

k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

Im(f)=13.381831 * (2π)/(0.253 )=13.381831 *25.2≈337.6 fm.

No match.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f)= (sum) * (1/(2k)).

Which gives 264.3 fm, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the options are off by a factor of 2.

If the correct answer is 264.3 fm, but the closest option is D)251.27, which is about 251. It's possible that the sum should have been 13.381831, but perhaps I missed a phase shift, but the question says to ignore the rest beyond l=4.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial phase shift sum.

Wait, the given phase shifts are:

δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°.

But wait, phase shifts are usually given in radians, but they're given in degrees here. Did I use degrees correctly? Because in the calculations, I used sin(67 degrees), etc.

Yes, I converted them to radians when calculating the sines.

Wait, no, I used degrees in the sin function. Which is wrong because in programming, sin functions take radians. But I'm doing this manually, so I had to compute sin(67 degrees) as approximately 0.9205.

But if I use exact values, perhaps the sum would change slightly.

But it's unlikely to change the sum from ~13.38.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part in units of 1e-15 m (fm), but perhaps my calculation was in m^-1, so to get fm, I need to invert the k.

Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C)177.675 fm, which is approximately half of 355.35 fm.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 1/2 somewhere.

Wait, in the formula Im(f)= sum/(2k ), if k was m^-1, and I have 2.5e13 m^-1, then Im(f)=13.381831/(5e13 )=2.676e-13 m=267.6 fm.

Which is close to 264.3.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the scattering amplitude is f = (1/(2ik)) sum ... So when taking the imaginary part, perhaps it's (sum_real ) * (1/(2k )).

Wait, earlier calculation showed that sum_real is -6.1283, so Im(f)= (sum_real )/(2k )= (-6.1283 )/(2*2.53e13 )= (-6.1283 )/(5.06e13 )= -1.209e-13 m= -120.9 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the correct approach is to compute the total cross-section and then find Im(f).

But without knowing the cross-section, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the correct approach gives 264 fm, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended formula is different.

Wait, looking back, in the initial approach, when I thought the formula was Im(f)= (k/(2π)) * sum, which gave 5.386e13 m^-1=5.386e13 fm^{-1}.

But that's 5.386e13 fm^{-1}=5.386e13 *1e15 m^{-1}=5.386e28 m^{-1}, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

Perhaps I should give up and choose the closest option, which is D)251.271 fm.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1) \sin\delta_l
\]

### Step 1: Compute the sum of \((2l+1) \sin\delta_l\)
The given phase shifts are \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). The contributions for each \(l\) are:

- \(l=0\): \((2(0)+1) \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\)
- \(l=1\): \((2(1)+1) \sin(67^\circ) = 3 \cdot 0.9205 = 2.7615\)
- \(l=2\): \((2(2)+1) \sin(55^\circ) = 5 \cdot 0.8192 = 4.096\)
- \(l=3\): \((2(3)+1) \sin(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot 0.5 = 3.5\)
- \(l=4\): \((2(4)+1) \sin(13^\circ) = 9 \cdot 0.22495 = 2.02455\)

Summing these contributions:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin\delta_l = 1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.02455 = 13.382
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(k\)
The wave number \(k\) is related to the energy \(E\) of the electrons. Using the relativistic relation \(E = pc\), where \(p = \hbar k\), we find:

\[
k = \frac{E}{\hbar c}
\]

Given \(E = 50 \, \text{MeV}\), \(\hbar c = 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}\), and converting \(E\) into compatible units:

\[
k = \frac{50}{197.33} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(\text{Im}(f(0))\)
Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin\delta_l}{2k} = \frac{13.382}{2 \cdot 0.253} = \frac{13.382}{0.506} \approx 26.44 \, \text{fm}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated value of \(\text{Im}(f(0)) \approx 26.44 \, \text{fm}\) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **D) 251.271 fm**, which is approximately 9.5 times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy suggests either a missing factor in the formula or an error in the interpretation of the units.

### Conclusion
Given the mismatch between the calculated value and the options, and assuming the problem expects the closest match, the best choice is:

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that involves the scattering of particles where the kinetic energy is conserved, so no energy is lost. But wait, the question is about phase shifts and the scattering amplitude. Oh right, in quantum mechanics, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts.

The given phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°, and the rest are ignored. So I think for s-wave scattering (l=0), the phase shift is δ₀, and for higher angular momentum states l=1,2,3,4, etc., the phase shifts are δ₁, δ₂, etc. But the question asks for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f(k,θ) in partial wave expansion is a sum over all angular momentum states. The formula I remember is f(k,θ) = (1/k) * Σ ( (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l / (1 + e^{2iδ_l}) ) * ... Wait, no, maybe that's not exactly right. Or is it f(k,θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum over l [ (2l+1) (e^{iδ_l} - 1) P_l(cosθ) ) ].

Wait, when I think about it, the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is given by:

f(k,θ) = (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (2l + 1) (e^{iδ_l} - 1) P_l (cosθ) ]

But the question is asking about the imaginary part along the incident direction. The incident beam direction, I think, is when θ=0°, because that's the direction of the incoming particle. So cosθ would be 1. So the associated Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is... Oh right, P_l(1) is 1 for all l. Because P_l(1) = 1 for all l. So f(k,θ=0) would then be (1/(2ik)) * Σ [ (2l +1)(e^{iδ_l} - 1) ].

But wait, the expression (e^{iδ_l} -1) can be expanded as e^{iδ_l} = cosδ_l + i sinδ_l. So e^{iδ_l} -1 = (cosδ_l -1) + i sinδ_l.

So the imaginary part of f(k,θ=0) would come from the imaginary parts of each term in the sum. So each term contributes (2l+1) * sinδ_l multiplied by i, and then divided by 2ik.

Wait, let's break it down. The entire expression f is (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l+1) (e^{iδ_l} -1) ]

The imaginary part of f, Im(f), is the imaginary part of [ (1/(2ik)) * sum ... ]

Let me think about this. Let's write 1/(2ik) as -i/(2k), because 1/i = -i. So 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k).

So f = [sum (2l+1)(e^{iδ_l} -1 ) ] * (-i/(2k)).

So the sum is over l=0,1,2,3,4 (since the phase shifts are given up to δ4). 

Expanding each term in the sum:

sum = sum [ (2l+1) ( (cosδ_l -1) + i sinδ_l ) ]

Which can be split into real and imaginary parts. But since we're interested in Im(f), we can focus on the imaginary parts of the sum.

The sum's imaginary part is sum [ (2l+1) * sinδ_l ] for each l. Let's compute that.

So for each l, the coefficient is (2l+1) sinδ_l.

Let me compute each term:

For l=0:
(2*0 +1) * sin(90°) = 1 * 1 = 1.

l=1:
(3)* sin(67°). Let's calculate that. Sin(67) is approx 0.9205. So 3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:
5 * sin(55°). Sin(55) is about 0.8192. 5 * 0.8192 ≈4.096.

l=3:
7 * sin(30°). Sin(30)=0.5. 7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:
9 * sin(13°). Sin(13)= approx 0.22495. 9 *0.22495 ≈2.02455.

Now summing these up: 1 + 2.7615 = 3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455≈13.38205.

So the imaginary part of the sum is approximately 13.382.

Now, going back to f, the imaginary part is the imaginary part of [ (-i/(2k)) * sum ], which is [ (-i/(2k)) * (sum_real + i sum_imag) ) ]

Wait, let me think again. The sum has a real part and an imaginary part. But in our case, the sum we calculated is just the imaginary part. Let me double-check. The sum is sum ( (cosδ_l -1) + i sinδ_l ) multiplied by (2l+1). So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sinδ_l. So the sum's imaginary part is the sum of those.

So the sum is [ sum_real + i sum_imag ].

But when we multiply by (-i/(2k)), which is a purely imaginary factor, the imaginary part of f comes from the real part of the sum multiplied by (-i^2)/(2k) ?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute Im(f) directly.

f = [ (sum_real + i sum_imag) ] * [ -i/(2k) ]

Multiply this out:

f = sum_real * (-i/(2k)) ) + sum_imag * ( (-i^2)/(2k) )

Because (i * -i) = -i^2 = 1.

So:

sum_real * (-i/(2k)) contributes to the imaginary part of f.

sum_imag * ( (-i^2)/(2k) ) = sum_imag * (1/(2k)) which contributes to the real part of f.

Therefore, the imaginary part of f is sum_real * (-1/(2k)).

Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, f = (sum_real + i sum_imag) * (-i/(2k)).

Multiplying out:

sum_real * (-i/(2k)) + i sum_imag * (-i/(2k)).

First term: sum_real * (-i/(2k)) → this is imaginary.

Second term: i * (-i) = -i² = 1. So second term is sum_imag/(2k) → this is real.

So the imaginary part of f is [ (- sum_real ) / (2k) ].

Because the first term is (sum_real * (-i) ) / (2k), so the coefficient is -sum_real/(2k) multiplied by i. So the imaginary part is -sum_real/(2k).

Wait, but sum_real is the real part of the sum, which is sum [ (2l+1)(cosδ_l -1) ].

So let's compute sum_real:

For each l:

l=0: (1)(cos90 -1) = 1*(0 -1) = -1.

l=1: 3*(cos67 -1) ≈3*(0.3907 -1) =3*(-0.6093)= -1.8279.

l=2:5*(cos55 -1)≈5*(0.5736 -1)=5*(-0.4264)= -2.132.

l=3:7*(cos30 -1 )≈7*(0.8660 -1)=7*(-0.1340)= -0.938.

l=4:9*(cos13 -1)≈9*(0.9744 -1)=9*(-0.0256)= -0.2304.

Now sum all these up:

-1 + (-1.8279) = -2.8279.

-2.8279 + (-2.132) = -4.9599.

-4.9599 + (-0.938) = -5.8979.

-5.8979 + (-0.2304) = -6.1283.

So sum_real ≈ -6.1283.

So the imaginary part of f, Im(f) = (- sum_real )/(2k) = (6.1283)/(2k).

Wait but k is the wave number. The question says electrons of 50 MeV. How do I find k?

I remember that the wave number k is given by the formula k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ, but wait, more accurately, the formula for the kinetic energy is E = (ħ²k²)/(2m). So k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

But since the units are in MeV, perhaps I should use natural units where ħ= c=1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can compute k in appropriate units.

Wait, actually, the problem asks for the imaginary part in fm (femtometers), so I need to make sure the units are correct.

Electron mass m is about 0.511 MeV/c².

Wait, that's the rest mass. So E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than m, so relativistic effects might be significant, but perhaps the problem expects a non-relativistic approach.

Alternatively, since electrons are light, but 50 MeV is 93.8 times the rest mass of an electron (since 0.511 MeV is the rest energy). So perhaps relativistic considerations are needed.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the non-relativistic expression for k.

In non-relativistic mechanics, E ≈ (ħ²k²)/(2m). So k = sqrt(2m E) / ħ.

But when E is much larger than m, non-relativistic might not hold. Hmm. But perhaps the problem expects the non-relativistic approach regardless.

Alternatively, using the relativistic energy relation, but I'm not sure.

Let me proceed with the non-relativistic approach.

So E = 50 MeV. m is the electron mass, 0.511 MeV/c².

But using natural units where ħ=1, c=1, E (in MeV) is equal to (k²/(2m)) * ħ² c². Wait, perhaps I should convert to SI units.

Alternatively, perhaps use the formula for k in terms of energy.

Wait, the expression for k is sqrt(2mE)/(ħ). But in terms of units, E should be in Joules, m in kg, ħ in J·s.

But that's a bit involved. Alternatively, perhaps use the following approach.

The electron's rest energy is m c² = 0.511 MeV. E = 50 MeV. So the kinetic energy is K = E - m c² = 50 - 0.511 ≈49.489 MeV.

But if we're using the non-relativistic formula, E ≈ K + m c². Hmm, perhaps it's better to proceed with E = (ħ² k²)/(2m), so solving for k:

k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ.

But I need to compute this with E in Joules.

Let me compute E in Joules.

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So 1 MeV = 1e6 eV = 1.602e-13 J.

So E =50 MeV = 50 *1.602e-13 J ≈8.01e-12 J.

m is the electron mass, which is 9.109e-31 kg.

ħ is Planck's constant divided by 2π, which is approximately 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So plug into k:

k = sqrt(2 * m * E) / ħ.

Compute numerator first: 2 * m * E = 2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-12 J.

Wait, 2 *9.109e-31 =1.8218e-30.

Multiply by 8.01e-12: 1.8218e-30 *8.01e-12 = approx 1.46e-41.

Take sqrt: sqrt(1.46e-41) ≈ 3.82e-21 m^-1.

Denominator is ħ ≈1.0546e-34 J·s.

So k = 3.82e-21 / 1.0546e-34 ≈ 3.62e13 m^-1.

Wait, that's a very large k. But considering the energy is 50 MeV, which is high, perhaps that's correct.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, 2mE = 2 * m * E.

m =9.109e-31 kg.

E=50 MeV =50 * 1e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV =50 *1.602e-13 J=8.01e-12 J.

So 2mE = 2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-12.

Compute 9.109e-31 *8.01e-12 = approx 7.298e-42.

Multiply by 2: 1.4596e-41.

Take square root: sqrt(1.4596e-41) = approx 3.82e-21 m^-1 (since sqrt(1e-42)=1e-21). So yes, that's correct.

Then k = 3.82e-21 / 1.0546e-34 ≈3.62e13 m^-1.

Wait, but this seems very large. Hmm. But perhaps that's correct for high energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects relativistic considerations, but I'm not sure.

Now, back to Im(f) = (6.1283) / (2k) * (1 fm) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the formula for Im(f) is Im(f)= (- sum_real )/(2k) → (6.1283)/(2k). But wait, because sum_real is negative, so -sum_real is positive.

Wait, no, let me go back. The sum_real is the sum of (2l+1)(cosδ_l -1), which we calculated as approximately -6.1283. So Im(f) is (-sum_real)/(2k). So that would be 6.1283/(2k).

But wait, no. Let me get the exact expression.

Earlier, I found that the imaginary part of f is [(- sum_real) ] / (2k).

Wait, no, earlier conclusion was that Im(f) = (sum_real) * (-1/(2k)).

Wait, no, Im(f) comes from the first term of the multiplication, which was sum_real * (-i/(2k)).

So the imaginary part of that term is (sum_real) * (-1/(2k)).

Because the term is (sum_real) * (-i/(2k)) = (-i sum_real )/(2k), so the imaginary part is (- sum_real )/(2k) multiplied by i.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the signs. Let me write it more carefully.

The first term is sum_real * (-i/(2k)).

sum_real is real, so the term is a purely imaginary number: (sum_real) * (-i) / (2k) = [ -i sum_real ]/(2k).

So the imaginary part of this term is [ - sum_real ]/(2k).

But the second term, sum_imag/(2k), is real, so it doesn't contribute to the imaginary part.

Therefore, Im(f) = [ - sum_real ]/(2k).

Wait, but sum_real is negative, so [ - sum_real ] is positive.

So Im(f) = [ positive number ]/(2k).

So plugging in sum_real ≈-6.1283, so -sum_real ≈6.1283.

So Im(f) = 6.1283/(2k).

But k is 3.62e13 m^-1.

So 2k ≈7.24e13 m^-1.

So 6.1283 / (7.24e13) ≈8.46e-14 m.

Wait, but the options are in femtometers. 1 fm = 1e-15 m.

So 8.46e-14 m = 84.6 fm. Wait, but none of the options are 84.6.

Wait, but wait. Did I make a mistake? Because 3.62e13 m^-1 is 3.62e13 per meter. 1/(3.62e13) m is about 2.76e-14 m, which is 27.6 fm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation.

Wait, let's recompute k.

Wait, E =50 MeV. But when E is much larger than m c², the non-relativistic formula isn't accurate. Instead, perhaps I should use the relativistic formula.

Wait, the relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). For electrons, when the kinetic energy is much higher than m c^2, the momentum p is approximately E/c. So p ≈ E/(c).

But then, the wave number k is related to momentum by p = ħ k.

So k = p/ħ ≈ E/(c ħ).

Wait, let's compute k that way.

E =50 MeV =50e6 eV.

Convert E to Joules: 50e6 * 1.602e-19 J =8.01e-13 J.

c is 3e8 m/s.

ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So k = E/(c ħ) =8.01e-13 J / (3e8 m/s * 1.0545718e-34 J·s) )

Compute denominator:3e8 * 1.05457e-34 =3.1637e-26.

So k =8.01e-13 / 3.1637e-26 ≈2.532e13 m^-1.

Wait, same order of magnitude as before.

Hmm, but perhaps using the relativistic approach, the k is about 2.5e13 m^-1.

So going back: Im(f) =6.1283/(2k) =6.1283/(2 *2.532e13) =6.1283/(5.064e13) ≈1.209e-13 m.

Convert to fm: 1e-15 m is 1 fm. So 1.209e-13 m =120.9 fm.

Wait, but none of the options are near 120.9. The options given are 87163.4 fm (A), 355.351 (B), 177.675 (C), 251.271 (D).

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, f(k,θ=0), but in a specific unit system where k is expressed differently. Or perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the expression for f(k,θ) is not (1/(2ik)) sum... but something else.

Wait, another formula I found is that the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(k,θ) = (1/k) Σ [ (2l+1) (e^{iδ_l} -1 ) (P_l (cosθ)) ]

But in some conventions, it's (1/(2ik)) sum [(2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l / (1 + e^{2iδ_l}) ) ] ?

No, perhaps I'm mixing different derivations.

Alternatively, another approach: the scattering amplitude for each partial wave is f_l = (2l +1)/(k) [ e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l ].

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the total scattering amplitude is the sum over l of f_l * (2l+1) P_l (cosθ), but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude.

Wait, the optical theorem states that the total cross-section is proportional to the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude. The formula is σ_total = 4π |f(0)|^2, but that's for the differential cross-section. No, wait, the optical theorem says σ_total = 4π (k Im f(0) ), where f(0) is the forward scattering amplitude.

Wait, so Im f(0) = (σ_total)/(4π k).

But I don't know the total cross-section here. So that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula I should use is Im(f) = (k/(2π)) Σ [ (2l+1) sinδ_l ].

Wait, that rings a bell. Because in partial wave analysis, the imaginary part of the amplitude at θ=0 is given by Im f(0) = (k/(2π)) Σ (2l+1) sinδ_l.

Ah, maybe that's the correct formula. So I might have been using the wrong approach earlier.

So let's try this again. If Im f(0) = (k/(2π)) * sum [ (2l+1) sinδ_l ].

So compute that sum.

Compute (2l+1) sinδ_l for each l:

l=0:1 * sin90 =1*1=1.

l=1:3 * sin67 ≈3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin55≈5*0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin30=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin13≈9*0.22495=2.02455.

Sum these: 1 +2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455≈13.382.

So sum =13.382.

Now, Im f(0) = (k/(2π)) * 13.382.

But what's k? Earlier, using E=50 MeV, I found k≈2.53e13 m^-1.

So Im f(0)= (2.53e13 m^-1 / (2π)) ) *13.382.

Compute that: 2.53e13/(2π) ≈(2.53e13)/(6.2832) ≈4.026e12.

Multiply by 13.382: 4.026e12 *13.382 ≈5.387e13.

But the units would be (m^-1) * (dimensionless) → m^-1.

Wait, but the options are in fm. 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so 1e15 fm^{-1}.

Wait, no. Wait, the scattering amplitude f is dimensionless in what unit? Or perhaps in units where ħ=1, c=1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the scattering amplitude f has units of (length)^{-1}. Because the cross-section is σ = |f|^2 * (4π/k^2), perhaps? Or wait, the cross-section is dσ/dΩ = |f|^2.

Wait, no, in natural units where ħ=1, c=1, the cross-section has units of barns, which are (1e-28 m²). Scattering amplitude f is in units of (length), because cross-section is |f|^2 multiplied by (something).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of units.

The scattering amplitude f has units of (length). Because when you calculate the differential cross-section, it's dσ/dΩ = |f|^2 * (something), and cross-section has units of area (m²), so f must be in m.

Wait, but our calculation gave Im(f) in m^-1. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the formula.

Wait, the formula I found online is:

Im(f) = (k/(2π)) * sum [ (2l+1) sinδ_l ]

So, with k in units of m^-1, Im(f) would have units of (m^-1) * (dimensionless) = m^-1.

But the options are in fm, which is 1e-15 m. So perhaps I should convert the result from m^-1 to fm.

Wait, if Im(f) is in m^{-1}, then 1/(m^-1) is m. So to get Im(f) in fm, perhaps we need to invert.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula gives Im(f) in units of (m^{-1} ), because k is in m^{-1}.

But the options are in fm, which is a length. So perhaps the formula gives the imaginary part in (1/m), but the question is expecting a value in fm.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if f is in units of 1/m, then 1/(1/m) is m, which is a length.

Wait, perhaps the formula is correct, but I have to compute Im(f) and then convert it into fm.

Wait, let me compute Im(f):

Im(f) = (k/(2π)) * sum [ (2l+1) sinδ_l ]

k =2.53e13 m^-1.

sum =13.382.

So Im(f)= (2.53e13)/(2π) *13.382 → compute 2.53e13/(6.2832) ≈4.025e12.

Multiply by13.382: 4.025e12 *13.382 ≈5.386e13.

So Im(f)=5.386e13 m^-1.

Wait, but that's 5.386e13 per meter.

Wait, but I'm supposed to get the imaginary part in fm. Hmm. That doesn't seem to align.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another source says that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at forward direction is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) * sum [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ) ].

Wait, no, that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = (1/k) * sum [ (2l+1) sin(δ_l) ].

Wait, if I use that formula, Im(f)= (1/k) * sum [ (2l+1) sinδ_l ].

Which would be (1/k) *13.382.

k is 2.53e13 m^-1 → 1/k =3.95e-14 m.

So Im(f)=13.382 *3.95e-14 ≈5.28e-13 m.

Which is 528 fm.

But that's not matching any of the options either.

Wait, the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, none of these are near 528 fm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The scattering amplitude f is given by:

f = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l +1) (e^{iδ_l} -1 ) P_l (cosθ) ]

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l+1)(e^{iδ_l} -1) ]

So the imaginary part is Im(f(0)) = [1/(2k)] * sum [ (2l+1) Re( e^{iδ_l} -1 ) ]

Wait, no, because e^{iδ} -1 = cosδ +i sinδ -1 = (cosδ-1) +i sinδ.

So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum [ (2l+1) ( (cosδ -1) + i sinδ ) ]

Which can be written as (1/(2ik)) [ sum_r (2l+1)(cosδ-1) + i sum_i (2l+1) sinδ ]

So the real part of f(0) is Re(f) = [ sum_r (2l+1)(cosδ-1) ] / (2k )

The imaginary part of f(0) is Im(f) = [ sum_i (2l+1) sinδ ] / (2k )

Ah, okay, so Im(f)= [ sum (2l+1) sinδ ]/(2k )

So now, the sum is 13.382 as before.

So Im(f) =13.382/(2k )

k is 2.53e13 m^-1.

So 2k=5.06e13 m^-1.

So Im(f)=13.382/(5.06e13 m^-1) → 2.644e-13 m.

Convert to fm: 2.644e-13 m =264.4 fm.

But that's not one of the options either. The closest option is D)251.271 fm.

Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k correctly using the relativistic energy.

E =50 MeV. The total energy is E = K + m c², but for high energies, E ≈ K.

But for the relativistic relation, p = gamma m v.

Wait, but in terms of wave number, k = p / ħ.

So p = gamma m v. But for high energies, gamma is large.

Alternatively, using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

E² = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So E² = p² c^4 + m² c^4.

So p = sqrt( E² - m² c^4 ) / c^2.

But for E >> m c², p ≈ E/c.

So p ≈ E/(c).

So k = p/ħ ≈ E/(c ħ).

E is 50 MeV.

Wait, but E should be in units compatible with c and ħ.

Let me compute E in Joules again:50 MeV =50e6 * 1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.

c=3e8 m/s.

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So k= (8.01e-13 J) / (3e8 m/s * 1.0545718e-34 J·s )

k=8.01e-13 / (3.1637e-26) ≈2.532e13 m^-1.

Same as before.

So Im(f)=13.382/(2 *2.532e13) =13.382/(5.064e13) ≈2.644e-13 m =264.4 fm.

But the options don't have 264.4; the closest is D)251.271 fm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum more accurately.

Let me re-calculate sum (2l+1) sinδ_l:

l=0:1 * sin90=1.

l=1:3 * sin67. Let me compute sin(67) accurately.

Sin(67 degrees) = sin(1.16937 radians) ≈0.920504.

3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin55. Sin(55)≈0.819152. 5 *0.819152≈4.09576.

l=3:7 * sin30=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin13. Sin(13)=0.224951. 9 *0.224951≈2.02456.

Summing:

1 +2.7615=3.7615.

+4.09576=7.85726.

+3.5=11.35726.

+2.02456=13.38182.

So sum=13.38182.

So Im(f)=13.38182/(2*2.532e13) =13.38182/(5.064e13) =2.643e-13 m=264.3 fm.

Hmm. But the options don't have 264.3. The closest is D)251.271 fm.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is multiplied by k/(2π), not divided.

Wait, alternative approach: I found a source that says the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by Im(f(0)) = (k/(2π)) * sum [ (2l+1) sinδ_l ].

So Im(f(0)) = (k/(2π)) * sum.

Sum is 13.38182.

k=2.532e13 m^-1.

So Im(f)= (2.532e13)/(2π) *13.38182.

Compute 2.532e13/(2π)= approx 2.532e13/(6.2832)=4.025e12.

Multiply by 13.38182:4.025e12 *13.38182≈5.386e13.

But that's 5.386e13 m^-1. That's 5.386e13 per meter.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are in fm, which is a length.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Another source says that the total cross-section is given by σ_total = 4π (k Im f(0) ), so Im f(0) = σ_total/(4π k).

But without knowing σ_total, I can't use that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = (1/(2k)) * sum [ (2l+1) sinδ_l ].

Which would give Im(f)=13.38182/(2*2.532e13)=13.38182/(5.064e13)=2.643e-13 m=264.3 fm.

But that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let's compute the sum again:

l=0:1*1=1.

l=1:3*sin67=3*0.920504=2.761512.

l=2:5 *0.819152=4.09576.

l=3:7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9*0.224951=2.024559.

Sum is 1+2.761512=3.761512 +4.09576=7.857272 +3.5=11.357272 +2.024559=13.381831.

So sum=13.381831.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses only even l, or perhaps the question counts l starting from 0 and gives up to l=4.

Wait, another possibility is that I should compute the sum as [ (2l+1) sinδ_l ] for each l=0 to 4.

Yes, which I did. So sum=13.381831.

But perhaps the question expects to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond l=4, which I think I accounted for.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k differently. Let me try using the relativistic formula for k.

In relativistic terms, the energy E is given by E = sqrt( p² c^4 + m² c^4 ).

So p = sqrt( E² - m² c^4 ) / c^2.

Wait, but E is 50 MeV. m c^2 is 0.511 MeV.

So E >> m c², so p ≈ E/(c²) * c = E/(c).

Wait, that's the same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recompute:

k = p / ħ.

p = E/(c).

So k= E/(c ħ).

E=50 MeV =50e6 * 1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.

c=3e8 m/s.

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So k=8.01e-13 / (3e8 *1.0545718e-34 )=8.01e-13/(3.1637e-26)= approx 2.532e13 m^-1.

Same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the question is using a different unit for E, like E in eV, and I messed up the conversion. Wait, no, I used 50 MeV correctly.

Wait, perhaps the formula for k is different when using MeV. Let me think: The wave number k can be expressed in terms of E in MeV as:

k (fm^{-1}) = (E (MeV) ) / (ħ c) ).

Wait, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

So k = E / (ħ c) ) =50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that's a very different k.

Wait, perhaps that's the right way to compute k.

Because 1 fm^{-1} is 1e15 m^{-1}.

So 0.253 fm^{-1}=2.53e14 m^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps that's correct.

So let me compute k using this formula.

k = E/(ħ c) ) =50 /197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f)= (sum)/(2k) )=13.381831/(2 *0.253) )=13.381831/(0.506 )≈26.44 fm^{-1}.

Wait, but that's 26.44 fm^{-1} which is 26.44 *1e15 m^{-1}=2.644e14 m^{-1}.

But that doesn't make sense because earlier calculation gave k=2.53e13 m^{-1}, which is 0.253e14 m^{-1} = 25.3 fm^{-1}.

Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So k = p / ħ = (E c)/(ħ c^2) ) / ħ = E c/(ħ^2 c^2 )= E/(ħ c).

Hmm, perhaps not. Let's compute k in fm^{-1}.

k = E (MeV) / ( ħ c (MeV fm) ) → units: MeV / (MeV fm) )= 1/fm.

So k=50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm )=50/197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

Thus, k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f)= sum/(2k )=13.381831/(2*0.253 )=13.381831/(0.506 )≈26.44 fm^{-1}.

But that's 26.44 per fm.

Wait, but the options are in fm, so perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (sum) * ( ħ c )/(2 E ).

Because then, the units would be MeV fm / (MeV ) → fm.

So let me try that.

sum is 13.381831.

Im(f)=13.381831 * (197.33 MeV fm )/(2 *50 MeV ) )=13.381831 *197.33/(100 )=13.381831 *1.9733≈26.43 fm.

But again, not matching any options.

Wait, but if I use the earlier approach where k=2.53e13 m^-1, then Im(f)= sum/(2k) =13.381831/(2 *2.53e13 )=2.643e-13 m=264.3 fm.

Which is 264.3 fm.

But none of the options match that. The closest option is D)251.271 fm.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum. Wait, let me recompute the sum with more precise delta values.

Compute each (2l+1) sinδ_l:

l=0: 1 * sin90 =1.

l=1:3 * sin67 =3 * sin(1.16937 rad)=3 *0.920504≈2.761512.

l=2:5 * sin55=5 * sin(0.95993 rad)=5 *0.819152≈4.09576.

l=3:7 * sin30=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin13=9 * sin(0.22689 rad)=9 *0.224951≈2.024559.

Sum:

1 +2.761512 =3.761512.

+4.09576=7.857272.

+3.5=11.357272.

+2.024559=13.381831.

So sum=13.381831.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum with more precise sine values.

For l=1, δ=67 degrees:

Sin(67)=sin(1.16937)≈0.920504.

3 *0.920504=2.761512.

For l=2, δ=55 degrees:

Sin(55)=sin(0.95993)=0.819152044.

5 *0.819152044=4.09576022.

l=4, δ=13 degrees:

Sin(13)=sin(0.22689)=0.224951054.

9 *0.224951054=2.02455949.

So sum remains 13.38183.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the formula Im(f) = 8π /k * sum [ (2l+1) sinδ_l ].

Wait, why would that be? Because sometimes factors can vary based on conventions.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = (sum) * (ħ c )/(2 E ).

So:

Im(f)=13.381831 * (197.33 MeV fm )/(2 *50 MeV )=13.381831 *1.9733≈26.44 fm.

But option C is 177.675 fm, which is about 6.68 times larger.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing a factor of π somewhere.

Wait, if I use the formula Im(f) = (k/(2π)) * sum.

With k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f)=0.253/(2π) *13.381831≈0.253/(6.2832) *13.381831≈0.04017 *13.381831≈0.538 fm.

No, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f) = (sum) * (1/(2k)).

So sum=13.381831.

k=2.53e13 m^-1.

So Im(f)=13.381831/(2*2.53e13 m^-1 )=13.381831/(5.06e13 m^-1 )=2.643e-13 m=264.3 fm.

But again, not in the options.

Wait, the options are A)87163.4 fm, which is 8.7e4 fm, B)355.35, C)177.7, D)251.27.

Hmm. Perhaps the calculation requires including the sum for all l, but the question says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond l=4.

Wait, perhaps the formula has a factor of 2. Let me check.

If I use Im(f)= sum * (1/(k)).

So Im(f)=13.381831/(2.53e13 m^-1 )=5.29e-13 m=529 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, another thought: the scattering amplitude f has units of length. So if Im(f) is 264 fm, but that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute k using E in MeV and the formula k = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

Wait, let me try that.

E=50 MeV.

m= electron mass=0.511 MeV/c².

So E=50 MeV.

k= sqrt(2m E)/ħ.

But with E in MeV, m in MeV/c², and ħ in MeV s / (c), perhaps the units will work out.

Wait, in natural units, c=1, ħ=1. So k = sqrt(2 m E).

But m is in MeV/c² → since c=1, m =0.511 MeV.

So k= sqrt(2 * 0.511 MeV *50 MeV )=sqrt(51.1 ) MeV ≈7.15 MeV.

But that's in terms of MeV, but I need k in units of 1/fm.

Using ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

So k (in 1/fm) = [ sqrt(2 m E) ] / ħ c.

Wait, no, let me think in terms of units.

k (in 1/fm) = (sqrt(2 m E )) / ( ħ c )

Because sqrt(2mE) has units of MeV, and ħ c is MeV fm.

So  MeV / (MeV fm )=1/fm.

So compute sqrt(2 *0.511 *50 )=sqrt(51.1 )≈7.15 MeV.

So k=7.15 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm )=7.15/197.33 ≈0.0362 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f)= sum/(2k )=13.381831/(2 *0.0362 )=13.381831/0.0724≈185 fm.

Wait, 13.381831/0.0724≈185.

But option C is 177.675 fm, which is close.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Compute sqrt(2 *0.511 *50 )=sqrt(51.1)=7.15 MeV.

k=7.15 /197.33 = approximately 0.0362 fm^{-1}.

Im(f)=13.381831/(2 *0.0362 )=13.381831/0.0724.

Compute 13.381831 ÷0.0724.

0.0724 * 184= approx 13.3136.

Which is close to 13.381831.

So 184 is roughly the value.

But 13.381831/0.0724= approximately 184.8 fm.

Which is close to option C (177.675) and D (251.271).

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum/(k).

Which would be 13.381831/0.0362≈369.6 fm.

Which is not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me re-examine the formula.

Earlier, I thought that Im(f)= sum/(2k).

But perhaps the correct formula is Im(f)= sum/(k).

So Im(f)=13.381831 /0.0362≈369.6 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula Im(f)= sum * (ħ c )/(2 E ).

Because sum is dimensionless, ħ c is in MeV fm, E in MeV.

So Im(f)=13.381831 * (197.33 MeV fm )/(2*50 MeV )=13.381831 * (197.33)/(100 )=13.381831 *1.9733≈26.44 fm.

But again, that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= (2 sum )/(k).

Which would be 2*13.381831/(0.0362 )=26.763662/0.0362≈739.3 fm.

Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f)= (2 sum )/(k) )=26.763662/0.0362≈739 fm.

No match.

Hmm. I must be missing something here. Looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option D, which is approximately 251.27 fm.

Wait, if I compute sum/(k) where k=0.0362 fm^{-1}.

sum=13.381831.

13.381831/0.0362≈369.6 fm.

Not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, when I compute k using non-relativistic formula, I get k=2.53e13 m^-1=25.3 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f)=13.381831/(2*25.3 )=13.381831/50.6≈0.2643 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is not among the options, but given the choices, the closest is option D:251.271 fm.

But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the sum is 13.381831.

If Im(f)= sum * (ħ c )/(2 E ), then:

Im(f) =13.381831 * (197.33)/(2*50 )=13.381831 *1.9733≈26.44 fm.

But not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= (sum) * (2π)/(k).

Which would be:

sum=13.381831.

k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

Im(f)=13.381831 * (2π)/(0.253 )=13.381831 *25.2≈337.6 fm.

No match.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f)= (sum) * (1/(2k)).

Which gives 264.3 fm, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the options are off by a factor of 2.

If the correct answer is 264.3 fm, but the closest option is D)251.27, which is about 251. It's possible that the sum should have been 13.381831, but perhaps I missed a phase shift, but the question says to ignore the rest beyond l=4.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial phase shift sum.

Wait, the given phase shifts are:

δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, δ₄=13°.

But wait, phase shifts are usually given in radians, but they're given in degrees here. Did I use degrees correctly? Because in the calculations, I used sin(67 degrees), etc.

Yes, I converted them to radians when calculating the sines.

Wait, no, I used degrees in the sin function. Which is wrong because in programming, sin functions take radians. But I'm doing this manually, so I had to compute sin(67 degrees) as approximately 0.9205.

But if I use exact values, perhaps the sum would change slightly.

But it's unlikely to change the sum from ~13.38.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part in units of 1e-15 m (fm), but perhaps my calculation was in m^-1, so to get fm, I need to invert the k.

Wait, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C)177.675 fm, which is approximately half of 355.35 fm.

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor of 1/2 somewhere.

Wait, in the formula Im(f)= sum/(2k ), if k was m^-1, and I have 2.5e13 m^-1, then Im(f)=13.381831/(5e13 )=2.676e-13 m=267.6 fm.

Which is close to 264.3.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the scattering amplitude is f = (1/(2ik)) sum ... So when taking the imaginary part, perhaps it's (sum_real ) * (1/(2k )).

Wait, earlier calculation showed that sum_real is -6.1283, so Im(f)= (sum_real )/(2k )= (-6.1283 )/(2*2.53e13 )= (-6.1283 )/(5.06e13 )= -1.209e-13 m= -120.9 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the correct approach is to compute the total cross-section and then find Im(f).

But without knowing the cross-section, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the correct approach gives 264 fm, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended formula is different.

Wait, looking back, in the initial approach, when I thought the formula was Im(f)= (k/(2π)) * sum, which gave 5.386e13 m^-1=5.386e13 fm^{-1}.

But that's 5.386e13 fm^{-1}=5.386e13 *1e15 m^{-1}=5.386e28 m^{-1}, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm.

Perhaps I should give up and choose the closest option, which is D)251.271 fm.


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l+1) \sin\delta_l
\]

### Step 1: Compute the sum of \((2l+1) \sin\delta_l\)
The given phase shifts are \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). The contributions for each \(l\) are:

- \(l=0\): \((2(0)+1) \sin(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\)
- \(l=1\): \((2(1)+1) \sin(67^\circ) = 3 \cdot 0.9205 = 2.7615\)
- \(l=2\): \((2(2)+1) \sin(55^\circ) = 5 \cdot 0.8192 = 4.096\)
- \(l=3\): \((2(3)+1) \sin(30^\circ) = 7 \cdot 0.5 = 3.5\)
- \(l=4\): \((2(4)+1) \sin(13^\circ) = 9 \cdot 0.22495 = 2.02455\)

Summing these contributions:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin\delta_l = 1 + 2.7615 + 4.096 + 3.5 + 2.02455 = 13.382
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(k\)
The wave number \(k\) is related to the energy \(E\) of the electrons. Using the relativistic relation \(E = pc\), where \(p = \hbar k\), we find:

\[
k = \frac{E}{\hbar c}
\]

Given \(E = 50 \, \text{MeV}\), \(\hbar c = 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}\), and converting \(E\) into compatible units:

\[
k = \frac{50}{197.33} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(\text{Im}(f(0))\)
Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin\delta_l}{2k} = \frac{13.382}{2 \cdot 0.253} = \frac{13.382}{0.506} \approx 26.44 \, \text{fm}
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated value of \(\text{Im}(f(0)) \approx 26.44 \, \text{fm}\) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **D) 251.271 fm**, which is approximately 9.5 times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy suggests either a missing factor in the formula or an error in the interpretation of the units.

### Conclusion
Given the mismatch between the calculated value and the options, and assuming the problem expects the closest match, the best choice is:

**Answer: D**
