Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is about finding the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable. The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, where σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. So I need to figure out the dimensions here.

First, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian must be 4 because the action is dimensionless in natural units (ℏ = c = 1). So each term in the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4.

Let's break down the components: 

The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}. So I need to find the mass dimensions of each part.

I think ψ, the fermion field, has a mass dimension of 3/2. Because in the Dirac Lagrangian, L = i ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ - m ψ̄ ψ. Each term must be dimension 4. The derivative ∂_μ has dimension 1. So ψ̄ γ ∂ ψ would have dimensions [ψ]^2 * [∂] = [ψ]^2 * 1. Since each term is dimension 4, [ψ]^2 * 1 =4 → [ψ]^2=4 → [ψ]=2, but wait, that can't be right because ψ is a spinor. Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think: ψ is a spinor field, which is a Grassmann variable, so its dimension is 3/2. Because in 4D spacetime, the Dirac field has dimension 3/2. So [ψ] = 3/2, and [ψ̄] is the same as ψ, since it's the adjoint.

Next, σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. The gamma matrices γ are dimensionless because they are just matrices. So the structure σ_{μν} is a product of two γ matrices, but in terms of dimensions, it's like having a dimensionless object because it's built from γ matrices and the commutator. So [σ_{μν}] = 0.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. F^{μν} is ∂^μ A^ν - ∂^ν A^μ, so each derivative is dimension 1, and A is a gauge field. The gauge field A has dimension 1, because in Maxwell's theory, the kinetic term is like F^2, so [F]^2 has to be [mass]^4 for the term to have dimension 4. But wait, [F_{μν}] is [∂ A], so each F term has [∂][A] → [F] = [1][1] = 2? Wait, no. Because F_{μν} has dimensions of [mass]^2, because each derivative is [mass]^1, and A is [mass]^1. So F is [mass]^2.

Wait, let me get this straight. The Maxwell term is (F_{μν})^2, which has dimension 4. So each F has dimension 2, because 2*(F's dimension) =4 → F dimension is 2. So F^{μν} has [F] = 2.

So putting it all together, the term is κ * ψ̄ * σ_{μν} * ψ * F^{μν}.

So the dimensions would be:

[κ] * [ψ̄] * [σ] * [ψ] * [F]

= [κ] * (3/2) * 0 * (3/2) * 2.

Wait, because [σ] is 0, because it's made of gamma matrices which are dimensionless. So [σ] is 0. So the whole product becomes [κ] * (3/2)^2 * (2) * 0? Wait, no, that can't be right. Because [σ] is dimensionless, so [σ] = 1 in terms of mass dimension? Or wait, no, because σ is made from [γ, γ], which are dimensionless. So [σ_{μν}] = [γ][γ] = 1? Or is it zero? Wait, no, σ_{μν} is a tensor of gamma matrices, so it's dimensionless. So [σ] is 0. So the term becomes [κ] * (3/2) * (3/2) * (2) multiplied by [σ], which is 0? Because [σ] is 0.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because all the terms are multiplied together, and each factor's dimension is additive? Wait, no, the total dimension is [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F].

Wait, let me rephrase. The term is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. The dimension of each field is as I've said: [ψ̄] = 3/2, [σ] is 0, [ψ] =3/2, [F] = 2. So adding their dimensions:

3/2 (ψ̄) + 0 (σ) +3/2 (ψ) + 2 (F) = 3/2 + 3/2 +2 = (3+2) +2? Wait, 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5? So [L_int] = [κ] +5 =4, because the Lagrangian must have dimension 4. So [κ] =4 -5= -1. So [κ]=-1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1, so the first part of the answer must be option A or C.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable? Well, for a theory to be renormalizable, all the coupling constants must have positive or zero mass dimension. Wait, no. Wait, the dimension of the coupling determines its relevance in the renormalization group sense. The dimension of the coupling (in terms of mass) is [κ]_M. So if the coupling is dimensionless ([κ] =0), the theory is renormalizable. If the coupling has positive mass dimension, it's super-renormalizable. If negative, not renormalizable.

Wait, in our case, [κ]=-1, which is negative. So the interaction term has a coupling with negative mass dimension. So the theory is not renormalizable. Because, in four dimensions, renormalizability requires that the coupling constants have dimension ≥0. So if [κ]=-1, it's non-renormalizable.

So putting it together: [κ]=-1, and not renormalizable. So the options are A, B, C, D. Let's look at the options:

Option A: [κ]=-1, renormalizable → no, because [κ] is -1, so theory not renormalizable.

Option C: [κ]=-1, not renormalizable → yes, that fits.

Wait, but wait, think again. The interaction term is L ∼ ψ̄ σ F ψ. Let me think about the superficial degree of divergence.

Wait, another approach: The interaction term is of the form ψ^2 F. Because σ is a product of two gamma matrices, but since it's contracted with F_{μν}, which is antisymmetric, maybe it's similar to a gauge interaction.

Wait, but I think the key is the dimension of the coupling. Since [κ]=-1, which is negative, the coupling is dimensionful. In four dimensions, a coupling with negative mass dimension implies it's non-renormalizable. Because you can't have a dimensionless coupling in a non-renormalizable theory, but wait, no: the coupling here is in a term that would require higher-dimensional operators.

Wait, another approach: the interaction term is of the form ψ̄ (σ^{μν}) ψ F_{μν}. So the term is ψ^2 F. Since F is a field strength tensor, which is dimension 2. So the term is (ψ^4) * F²? No, wait, the term is ψ̄ σ ψ F. So the term is (ψ^2) (F), but each ψ is 3/2, so ψ^2 is 3, F is 2, so (3) + (2) =5. So the term is dimension 5, and to make the Lagrangian dimension 4, κ must have dimension -1.

So the coupling is dimension -1. Since the coupling has negative mass dimension, the theory is non-renormalizable because each interaction term brings in higher powers of momentum in loops, leading to non-convergent Feynman diagrams unless some symmetry protects it.

So the answer is that [kappa]=-1, and the theory is not renormalizable.

So looking at the options: option C says [kappa]=-1 and not renormalizable. So the correct answer is C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \( \kappa \) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu] \).

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The fermion field \( \psi \) has a mass dimension of \( \frac{3}{2} \), and its adjoint \( \bar{\psi} \) also has the same dimension.
- The field strength tensor \( F^{\mu\nu} \) has a mass dimension of \( 2 \), as it is derived from derivatives of the gauge field \( A_\mu \), which has a mass dimension of \( 1 \).
- The object \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) is constructed from the gamma matrices \( \gamma_\mu \), which are dimensionless. Therefore, \( \sigma_{\mu\nu} \) has a mass dimension of \( 0 \).

### Step 2: Mass dimension of \( \kappa \)
The Lagrangian density must have a total mass dimension of \( 4 \). Breaking down the term \( \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu} \):
- \( [\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2} \),
- \( [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] = 0 \),
- \( [\psi] = \frac{3}{2} \),
- \( [F^{\mu\nu}] = 2 \).

Adding these dimensions:
\[
[\bar{\psi}] + [\sigma_{\mu\nu}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = \frac{3}{2} + 0 + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]

Since the total dimension of the Lagrangian must be \( 4 \), the dimension of \( \kappa \) must satisfy:
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
For a theory to be renormalizable in \( 4 \)-dimensional spacetime, the coupling constants must have non-negative mass dimensions (\( [\kappa] \geq 0 \)). In this case, \( [\kappa] = -1 \), which is negative. This implies that the theory is **not renormalizable** because the interaction term introduces higher-dimensional operators that lead to non-convergent loop diagrams.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of \( \kappa \) is \( -1 \), and the theory is not renormalizable. Comparing with the options:

- **Option A**: \( [\kappa] = -1 \), theory is renormalizable → Incorrect.
- **Option B**: \( [\kappa] = 1 \), theory is renormalizable → Incorrect.
- **Option C**: \( [\kappa] = -1 \), theory is not renormalizable → Correct.
- **Option D**: \( [\kappa] = 1 \), theory is not renormalizable → Incorrect.
