Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a particle of mass m moving in an isotropic three-dimensional potential V(r) = (1/2) m ω² r². Oh right, that's the harmonic oscillator potential because it follows Hooke's law. The question asks for the energy of the third excited state and the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue.

Hmm, I remember that in three dimensions, the isotropic harmonic oscillator can be treated as three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators in each spatial dimension (x, y, z). So the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, each direction contributes a quantum number n_x, n_y, n_z, which are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). The total energy is given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. The 3/2 comes from each direction contributing 1/2 ħω, and there are three directions.

So the energy levels are quantized and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers. For example, the ground state is when all n's are zero, so n_x + n_y + n_z = 0, giving E = (0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω.

But the question is about the third excited state. Wait, excited states are counted starting after the ground state. The ground state is the first (n=0), then first excited is n=1, second excited is n=2, third is n=3. Or wait, maybe the counting is different. Let me think. Since energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers, the energy states are determined by the principal quantum number n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

So the energy levels are E_n = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers. So the ground state is n=0, E=(3/2)ħω. First excited (n=1): E=(5/2)ħω. Second excited (n=2): E=(7/2)ħω. Third excited (n=3): E=(9/2) ħω. So that's the first part of the answer.

Now, the second part is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy. That is, how many distinct states have the same energy E_n where n=3.

Wait, so for n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 3, how many different ways can we have non-negative integers n_x, n_y, n_z summing to 3? Plus, each permutation is a different eigenfunction, so we need to count the number of distinct triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) that sum to 3.

Let me think about that. So the number of solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3, where each n is a non-negative integer. This is a combinatorial problem. It's equivalent to placing 3 identical balls into 3 boxes, which is a stars and bars problem.

The formula is (n + k -1 choose k -1), where n is the number to sum to and k is the number of variables. So here, n=3, k=3. So (3 +3 -1 choose 3-1) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So there are 10 different eigenfunctions.

So the energy is (9/2)ħω, and the number of eigenfunctions is 10. Looking at the options:

Option A says (9/2)ħω, 10. That matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the counting. For n=3, the possible (n_x, n_y, n_z) could be:

- All permutations where two are 0 and one is 3: There are C(3,1) =3 ways.

- Permutations where one is 1, one is 2, and the rest 0: The number is 3!/(1!1!1!) )=6 ways? Wait, no. Wait, for three numbers, the count when the numbers are 3,0,0 is 3. For 2,1,0, the number of distinct permutations is 3!/(1!1!1!) )= 6. Wait, but when all three are different, like 3,0,0: no, wait, that's two zeros. So the formula was correct.

Wait, let me list all possibilities:

n=3: sum is 3.

Possible triplets:

(3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3): 3 possibilities.

(2,1,0), but in all permutations. The number of permutations is 3! / (1!1!1! )= 6, but wait, because (2,1,0) are all distinct, each permutation counts as a different state. So that gives 6 possibilities.

Wait, but that's 3 +6 =9. Hmm, but wait, is there another case? Like (1,1,1): that sums to 3 as well. Oh right! I forgot that case. So (1,1,1) is another possibility.

So adding that: (3,0,0) gives 3, (2,1,0) gives 6, and (1,1,1) gives 1. So total 3+6+1=10. Yes, that makes sense.

So the number of eigenfunctions is 10.

Looking back at the options, option A is (9/2) ħω, 10. That's correct.

So the correct answer is option A.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ in an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are determined by the quantum numbers $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ in the three spatial dimensions, which satisfy the condition $n_x + n_y + n_z = n$. The total energy is given by:

\[
E_n = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega,
\]

where $n$ is the total quantum number. The ground state corresponds to $n = 0$ ($E = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega$), the first excited state to $n = 1$ ($E = \frac{5}{2} \hbar \omega$), the second excited state to $n = 2$ ($E = \frac{7}{2} \hbar \omega$), and the third excited state to $n = 3$ ($E = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$). Thus, the energy of the third excited state is:

\[
E = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

Next, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue is determined by the number of distinct ways to distribute the quantum number $n = 3$ among $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$. This is a combinatorial problem of finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$. Using the stars-and-bars method, the number of solutions is given by:

\[
\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} = \binom{3 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

These solutions correspond to the distinct eigenfunctions. Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10$.**

Answer: A

Hmm, I remember that in three dimensions, the isotropic harmonic oscillator can be treated as three independent one-dimensional harmonic oscillators in each spatial dimension (x, y, z). So the energy levels are determined by the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction.

Wait, each direction contributes a quantum number n_x, n_y, n_z, which are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). The total energy is given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω. The 3/2 comes from each direction contributing 1/2 ħω, and there are three directions.

So the energy levels are quantized and depend on the sum of the quantum numbers. For example, the ground state is when all n's are zero, so n_x + n_y + n_z = 0, giving E = (0 + 3/2) ħω = (3/2) ħω.

But the question is about the third excited state. Wait, excited states are counted starting after the ground state. The ground state is the first (n=0), then first excited is n=1, second excited is n=2, third is n=3. Or wait, maybe the counting is different. Let me think. Since energy levels depend on the sum of the quantum numbers, the energy states are determined by the principal quantum number n = n_x + n_y + n_z.

So the energy levels are E_n = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the three quantum numbers. So the ground state is n=0, E=(3/2)ħω. First excited (n=1): E=(5/2)ħω. Second excited (n=2): E=(7/2)ħω. Third excited (n=3): E=(9/2) ħω. So that's the first part of the answer.

Now, the second part is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions with the same energy. That is, how many distinct states have the same energy E_n where n=3.

Wait, so for n = n_x + n_y + n_z = 3, how many different ways can we have non-negative integers n_x, n_y, n_z summing to 3? Plus, each permutation is a different eigenfunction, so we need to count the number of distinct triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) that sum to 3.

Let me think about that. So the number of solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = 3, where each n is a non-negative integer. This is a combinatorial problem. It's equivalent to placing 3 identical balls into 3 boxes, which is a stars and bars problem.

The formula is (n + k -1 choose k -1), where n is the number to sum to and k is the number of variables. So here, n=3, k=3. So (3 +3 -1 choose 3-1) = (5 choose 2) = 10. So there are 10 different eigenfunctions.

So the energy is (9/2)ħω, and the number of eigenfunctions is 10. Looking at the options:

Option A says (9/2)ħω, 10. That matches.

Wait, but let me double-check the counting. For n=3, the possible (n_x, n_y, n_z) could be:

- All permutations where two are 0 and one is 3: There are C(3,1) =3 ways.

- Permutations where one is 1, one is 2, and the rest 0: The number is 3!/(1!1!1!) )=6 ways? Wait, no. Wait, for three numbers, the count when the numbers are 3,0,0 is 3. For 2,1,0, the number of distinct permutations is 3!/(1!1!1!) )= 6. Wait, but when all three are different, like 3,0,0: no, wait, that's two zeros. So the formula was correct.

Wait, let me list all possibilities:

n=3: sum is 3.

Possible triplets:

(3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3): 3 possibilities.

(2,1,0), but in all permutations. The number of permutations is 3! / (1!1!1! )= 6, but wait, because (2,1,0) are all distinct, each permutation counts as a different state. So that gives 6 possibilities.

Wait, but that's 3 +6 =9. Hmm, but wait, is there another case? Like (1,1,1): that sums to 3 as well. Oh right! I forgot that case. So (1,1,1) is another possibility.

So adding that: (3,0,0) gives 3, (2,1,0) gives 6, and (1,1,1) gives 1. So total 3+6+1=10. Yes, that makes sense.

So the number of eigenfunctions is 10.

Looking back at the options, option A is (9/2) ħω, 10. That's correct.

So the correct answer is option A.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle of mass $m$ in an isotropic three-dimensional harmonic oscillator potential $V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2$. The energy eigenvalues for such a system are determined by the quantum numbers $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$ in the three spatial dimensions, which satisfy the condition $n_x + n_y + n_z = n$. The total energy is given by:

\[
E_n = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega,
\]

where $n$ is the total quantum number. The ground state corresponds to $n = 0$ ($E = \frac{3}{2} \hbar \omega$), the first excited state to $n = 1$ ($E = \frac{5}{2} \hbar \omega$), the second excited state to $n = 2$ ($E = \frac{7}{2} \hbar \omega$), and the third excited state to $n = 3$ ($E = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega$). Thus, the energy of the third excited state is:

\[
E = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

Next, the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue is determined by the number of distinct ways to distribute the quantum number $n = 3$ among $n_x$, $n_y$, and $n_z$. This is a combinatorial problem of finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to $n_x + n_y + n_z = 3$. Using the stars-and-bars method, the number of solutions is given by:

\[
\binom{n + k - 1}{k - 1} = \binom{3 + 3 - 1}{3 - 1} = \binom{5}{2} = 10.
\]

These solutions correspond to the distinct eigenfunctions. Therefore, there are 10 linearly independent eigenfunctions for the third excited state.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A) $\frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10$.**
