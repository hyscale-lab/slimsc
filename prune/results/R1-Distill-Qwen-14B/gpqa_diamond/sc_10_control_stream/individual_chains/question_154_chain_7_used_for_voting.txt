Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a chemist found an unnamed white solid and gathered some spectral data to identify it. We need to use the given information to figure out which option is correct among A, B, C, D.

The data provided includes mass, IR, and 1H NMR spectra. Let's break down each piece of information.

First, the Mass spectrometry (MS). The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 (100%), and there's another peak at m/z 158 (32%). Hmm, molecular ion is the main peak, so the molecular weight is 156. The 158 peak might be a fragment or an isotope. Wait, but 158 is two units higher than 156. So, what could cause that? Maybe the presence of a chlorine isotope? Chlorine has a natural abundance of about 75% for the 35Cl isotope and about 25% for 37Cl. So if the molecular ion is at 156 (probably the 35Cl isotope), the 158 peak would be when a 37Cl is present. So the molecule should have a chlorine atom. That makes sense.

Next, the IR spectrum. It shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretch. O-H can be from an alcohol, phenol, carboxylic acid, or maybe an aldehyde. But wait, the other strong sharp peak is at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) peak. So what carbonyl groups have a peak around 1720? Carboxylic acids typically have a carbonyl around 1700, maybe a bit higher. Esters usually around 1730-1750. Aldehydes are around 2800 (stretch) and 1720-1710. Wait, but the IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700, which is probably O-H. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid because the O-H in carboxylic acids is usually broad, due to hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, an alcohol would have a broad O-H, but if it's a phenol, the O-H is also broad. But let's think about the NMR next.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.72 (d, 2H). So 11 ppm is a strong singlet. What kind of proton resonates at 11? That's a very high chemical shift. For aromatic protons, they're usually around 7-8.5 ppm. An aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10, but 11 is a bit high. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton is around 10-12, which fits. So that 11 ppm peak is likely the -COOH proton. The broad IR peak would fit with that as well.

The other NMR signals: 8.02 and 7.72, both doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests two sets of two equivalent aromatic protons. So in a benzene ring, perhaps a para-substituted group, but depending on substituents.

Wait, let's think about the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's see. Structure would be benzaldehyde with a hydroxyl and chloro groups. The aldehyde proton would be around 9-10, but the NMR shows 11.0. Hmm, maybe it's close. Also, the IR has a carbonyl peak at 1720. Benzaldehyde's carbonyl is about 1700, but maybe the ionization or conjugation shifts it. But wait, the IR also has a broad O-H, which would need to come from something else. Option A has a hydroxyl group (-OH) on the benzene ring, which would give a broad peak in IR. But the NMR shows a singlet at 11.0—if it's an aldehyde, that would be a triplet perhaps? Or maybe an -OH as a broad peak, but in the options, maybe not. Wait, the NMR doesn't mention a broad peak, only three signals. So maybe the aldehyde is a singlet. Wait, but aldehydes typically show a triplet or a singlet, but in some cases a triplet if coupled with adjacent protons. But in this case, the 11.0 is a singlet. Wait, but the -COOH proton is a broad peak, but in the NMR, the 11.0 is a singlet, which is sharp, not broad. Hmm, that might not fit.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is a chlorobenzene with a carboxylic acid group. So the benzene ring is substituted with Cl and COOH. The NMR would have the COOH proton at ~11 ppm as a singlet. Then, the aromatic protons would be in a pattern. Since the substituents are in para positions, the H adjacent to Cl and COOH would be deshielded. Let's see: the 1H NMR shows two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72. That suggests two sets of two equivalent protons each. For benzoic acid, if it's 4-chloro, the ring would have two sets of two Hs. Let me imagine the structure: Cl is at position 4, COOH at position 1. Then the Hs at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and at 3 and 5 equivalent. So the Hs ortho to Cl (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded than meta. Wait, COOH is at position 1, Cl at 4. So the Hs at positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH (position 1) and Cl is opposite. Alternatively, maybe the Hs are in the meta positions. Hmm, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in such a way that the two doublets are from the aromatic protons.

In the NMR, the 8.02 (d) and 7.72 (d) each have 2H. So each is a doublet—so each of these groups of H is coupled with one neighboring group. For a para-substituted benzene, like Cl and COOH in para positions, the Hs would be in pairs. So for example, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring has COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4. Then the Hs at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, each adjacent to COOH. Those Hs would be ortho to COOH. They'd be deshielded and appear downfield. The Hs at positions 3 and 5 would be meta to Cl and meta to COOH, perhaps appearing upfield. Wait, but in the NMR, the two doublets are at 8.02 and 7.72. Both are downfield but in different regions. So maybe the 8.02 is ortho to Cl and the 7.72 is meta? Or perhaps the substituents are in positions that cause this.

Wait, the NMR of benzoic acid derivatives: for benzoic acid, the COOH proton is around 11 ppm. The aromatic protons ortho to the COOH group are typically around 8 ppm. So for 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). The Hs at 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. Those Hs are usually more deshielded, so higher ppm. The Hs at 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. Which would be less deshielded, lower ppm.

So, for 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the 2H at 8.02 ppm (d) would be the Hs ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6), and the 2H at 7.72 would be the Hs at 3 and 5, which are ortho to Cl. Wait, but Cl is a de-shielding group, but in which position?

Alternatively, perhaps the two doublets in the NMR are due to being para to each other. Wait, no—each is a doublet with J coupling, so each set of Hs is adjacent to one other set.

Wait, let me think about the splitting. For a para-disubstituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions (like Cl and COOH), the ring might have two sets of equivalent protons. So, the Hs adjacent to the substituents would have certain chemical shifts.

But perhaps I should draw the structure. Let's imagine 4-chlorobenzoic acid: COOH is at position 1, Cl at 4.

The Hs at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. These would be more deshielded because of the electron-withdrawing COOH group. So their chemical shift would be higher, around 8.0 ppm.

The Hs at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. Cl is an electron-withdrawing group as well. So their shifts would be lower than the ortho Hs but perhaps around 7.7 ppm.

So in the NMR, the two doublets would correspond to these sets. Each H is adjacent to two substituents? Or perhaps each H is next to another H that's part of the same substituent.

Wait, the splitting in the NMR: each doublet has a coupling constant J. For aromatic protons, the coupling is typically between adjacent protons. So in a benzene ring, each proton is coupled with its immediate neighbors. But in the case of a para-substituted ring with two substituents, the coupling between the Hs might be more complex.

Wait, but in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4. So the H at position 2 is next to H at 3. Similarly, H at 6 is next to H at 5.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The positions are 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4 (Cl), 5, 6.

H at 2 is adjacent to H at 3. H at 3 is adjacent to H at 4 (Cl), but that's a substituent, not H. H at 5 is adjacent to H at 6, and H at 6 is adjacent to H at 1 (COOH, which is a substituent). So for H at 2, it's adjacent to H at 3 and H at 1 (unlikely, since H at 1 is a substituent, not an H). Wait, no, the substituents are at 1 and 4. So H at 2 is between substituent 1 and H3. H at 6 is between substituent 1 and H5.

Wait, perhaps this is getting complicated. Alternatively, the splitting in the NMR could be due to the substituents causing each set of Hs to have two neighbors, leading to doublets.

Alternatively, maybe the two substituents (Cl and COOH) are in such a way that each H on the ring has only one neighboring H, causing a doublet.

But perhaps I should think about the options.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. That would be OClCOPh. Wait, no, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the structure is Cl-CO-O attached to benzene. The NMR would have the Cl as a carbonyl group. But wait, in chloroformate, the carbonyl is part of the ester group. The substituents would be OCl and OPh attached to the carbonyl.

But the molecular ion is 156. Let me calculate the molecular weight of each option.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Chlorine is Cl (35.5). So molecular weight would be (7*12) + (6*1) + (2*16) + 35.5 = 84 +6 +32 +35.5= 157.5. Wait, but the molecular ion is 156. Hmm, that suggests 4-chlorobenzoic acid would have a molecular weight of about 157.5, but the molecular ion is at m/z 156. So that might not fit. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, molecular formula of 4-chlorobenzoic acid is C7H5ClO2. Because benzoic acid is C7H6O2, but replacing one H with Cl would be C7H5ClO2.

Calculating the molecular weight: C=12*7=84, H=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. So total is 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. So the molecular ion would be at 156.5, which rounds to 157? Or perhaps the mass is given as 156. So maybe that's a problem. Because the molecular ion is at 156, but 4-chlorobenzoic acid would be about 156.5, so maybe that's not matching.

Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156. So perhaps the molecular weight is 156. Let me check the options.

Option C: phenyl chloroformate.

Phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The formula is C8H7ClO2. Molecular weight: C=12*8=96, H=7, Cl=35.5, O=32. Total: 96 +7=103, 103 +35.5=138.5, 138.5+32=170.5. So molecular weight about 170.5. But the molecular ion is 156, so that can't be option C.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake on the formula. Phenyl chloroformate is O=C(OCl)Ph? No, wait. Chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-R. So R is phenyl. So the formula for phenyl chloroformate is C6H5-O-CO-Cl. So the formula is C7H5ClO2. Wait, wait: C6H5 is 6 carbons, O is one, COCl is another, so total carbons: 6 + (COCl is 2 carbons? No, wait, COCl is one carbon with double bond O and Cl. So the structure is Cl-C(O)-O-C6H5. So the formula is C7H5ClO2. So molecular weight is (7*12) +5 +35.5 + (2*16) = 84 +5=89, 89+35.5=124.5, 124.5+32=156.5. So about 156.5. The molecular ion is at 156, so that fits. Because the exact mass for 4-chlorobenzoic acid would be 156.5, but the molecular ion is at 156. Maybe it's a rounding thing. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C6H5ClO2, but that can’t be—benzoic acid is C7H6O2, so adding Cl would make it C7H5ClO2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me calculate each option's molecular weight.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

Structure: benzaldehyde with Cl at position 3 and OH at position 2.

The formula would be C7H5ClO2. Because benzaldehyde is C7H6O, but substituting two Hs: one with Cl and another with OH. Wait, no: benzaldehyde is C7H6O (Ph-CHO), molecular formula C7H6O. If we add a Cl and an OH, replacing two Hs, the formula would be C7H5ClO2.

Molecular weight: 7*12=84, H=5, Cl=35.5, O=32. Total 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So molecular weight 156.5. So the molecular ion would be at m/z 157? But the given is 156, so maybe that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated.

Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as option A. So molecular weight is 156.5 as well.

Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156. So both options A and B would have a molecular weight near 157, but the molecular ion is at 156. Hmmm. But wait, maybe the molecular ion is at the exact mass. Let me think: the exact mass of C7H5ClO2.

Carbon is 12.01, H is 1.008, Cl is 34.97, O is 16.00.

So exact mass: 7*12.01 = 84.07, 5*1.008=5.04, Cl=34.97, 2*16=32. So 84.07 +5.04=89.11 +34.97=124.08 +32=156.08. So the molecular ion is at 156.08, which would be observed around m/z 156. So options A and B have the same molecular weight.

Now, let's look at the IR and NMR of each.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The IR would show a strong O-H stretch (carboxylic acid) as a broad peak around 2500-3500, which matches the given IR. The strong peak at 1720 cm^-1 is the carbonyl, which would be about right for a carboxylic acid (usually around 1700, but maybe a bit higher). 

The NMR of 4-chlorobenzoic acid: The COOH proton is a broad peak around 11 ppm, but in the given data, the peak at 11 is a singlet, so maybe it's split into a singlet because it's exchanging and not coupled to any other protons. The aromatic protons: as I thought earlier, the two sets of doublets would correspond to the ortho and meta positions. The Hs ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded and appear around 8 ppm as a doublet. The Hs at 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH and ortho to Cl, which is also electron-withdrawing. So their chemical shift would be lower, perhaps around 7.7 ppm. The splitting into doublets would be because each H is coupled with one neighboring H. So each set of two Hs (in positions 2&6 and 3&5) would each be a doublet, each integrating for 2H. That matches the NMR data given.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure would be Cl at position 2 and COOH at position 1. So the substituents are adjacent. The NMR would be different in this case because of the proximity of substituents. The aromatic protons would be in a different pattern. For 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the aromatic ring would have the COOH at position 1 and Cl at 2. The Hs at positions 3 and 6 would be adjacent to substituents, so their shifts would be more downfield. The Hs at 4 and 5 would be more shielded. The splitting would be more complex, perhaps leading to triplets or other multiplets. But the NMR given is two doublets, which may not fit.

Looking back at the options, the NMR data has two doublets for the aromatic protons, each integrating 2H. That fits better with para-substituted rings, such as option B.

Now, the mass data: the molecular ion is at 156, and the isotopic peak is at 158 (32%). Since the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2, which has one Cl atom, the isotopic pattern should have about 37Cl. So the molecular ion peak at 156 is mainly due to 35Cl (which is 75% abundant), and the 158 peak is 37Cl (25% abundant), but since it's 32%, which is about 37Cl (25%), perhaps the peak is 158 and has 25% abundance, but the given is 32%. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me think: The molecular ion consists of two isotopic peaks. The major peak is M (156) which is 35Cl-based. The next peak would be M+2 (158) from 37Cl. The ratio of their intensities is about 75:25. But the problem states that the M is 100%, and the M+2 is 32%. That would be a ratio of 100/32 = about 3.125. But 75/25 =3. So that matches. So the presence of two peaks, 156 and 158, with a 3:1 ratio, supports the presence of a Cl atom. So the molecular formula includes Cl, as we thought earlier.

Now, looking at the options, both options B and D are benzoic acids with Cl, but option B is para, D is ortho.

In the NMR, the two doublets suggest a para-substituted ring. So for option B, the two substituents (Cl and COOH) are para. That would create two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, each as a doublet. So the NMR would match.

Option A is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's see what the NMR would look like. The structure has a benzene ring with Cl at 3, OH at 2, and aldehyde (CHO) at position 1. Wait, no, if it's 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, the substituents are Cl at 3, OH at 2, and CHO at 1. So the ring would be 1-CHO, 2-OH, 3-Cl.

The aromatic protons would be at positions 4, 5, and 6. Wait, no, because the substituents are at 1, 2, 3. So the Hs would be at 4,5,6 positions. But wait, how many Hs are there? In benzaldehyde, the substituents would take up three positions, leaving three Hs on the ring. But in this case, it's three substituents: CHO, OH, Cl. So the ring would have only three Hs, but how?

Wait, no. Wait, let's number the ring: position 1 is CHO, position 2 is OH, position 3 is Cl. Then positions 4,5,6 would have Hs. But in that case, the Hs at 4 and 6 would be adjacent to substituents, and H at 5 would be meta.

Wait, but this would result in three sets of Hs, perhaps. So the NMR would have more signals than what is given. The given NMR has three signals: one at 11ppm (singlet), and two doublets. So if the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative, maybe the NMR would have more than three signals. So perhaps option A is not the right fit.

Furthermore, the 11 ppm peak in the NMR is more likely a COOH proton than an aldehyde. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10, but sometimes higher. However, the singlet at 11 ppm is more indicative of a carboxylic acid proton.

So, putting it all together, the IR shows O-H (broad) and a carbonyl (sharp), which fits a carboxylic acid. The NMR shows a singlet at 11 (COOH), and two doublets for the aromatic Hs, which fits a para-substituted benzoic acid. The molecular weight is 156, which fits option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid).

Wait, but I thought option B's molecular formula would have a molecular weight of 156.5. But the molecular ion is at 156, which is exact. Maybe in the problem, it's rounded. So the correct option is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown white solid using spectral data. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** and the presence of a secondary peak at **m/z = 158** suggest the molecule has a chlorine atom, as the isotopic abundance ratio of **35Cl (75%)** to **37Cl (25%)** matches the observed **3:1** ratio. The molecular weight of the compound is therefore **156**.

The IR spectrum shows a **broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹**, indicative of an O-H stretch, and a **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**, characteristic of a carbonyl group. This strongly suggests the compound is a **carboxylic acid**, as carboxylic acids exhibit both broad O-H stretches and carbonyl peaks in this range.

The **¹H NMR** data provides further clues:
- A **singlet at 11.0 ppm** corresponds to the deshielded proton of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).
- Two **doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H)** and **7.72 ppm (2H)** suggest the presence of two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, consistent with a **para-substituted benzene ring**.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   This compound contains an aldehyde group (-CHO), which would typically resonate around **9-10 ppm** in the ¹H NMR. However, the observed singlet at **11.0 ppm** is more consistent with a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Additionally, the aromatic proton pattern does not match, as the substituents (Cl, OH, CHO) would result in more complex splitting.  
   **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a chlorine atom on a **para-substituted benzene ring**.  
   - The **singlet at 11.0 ppm** matches the -COOH proton.  
   - The two **doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H)** and **7.72 ppm (2H)** correspond to the aromatic protons ortho and meta to the substituents, respectively.  
   - The molecular formula **C₇H₅ClO₂** has a molecular weight of **156.5**, which aligns with the molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156**.  
   **Matches all data.**

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   This compound contains a chloroformate group (Cl-CO-O-Ph), which would not produce a broad O-H stretch in the IR spectrum. Additionally, the molecular weight of phenyl chloroformate is **170.5**, which does not match the molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156**.  
   **Eliminated.**

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom on an **ortho-substituted benzene ring**. The aromatic proton pattern for such a structure would not produce two distinct doublets, as the substituents would result in more complex splitting.  
   **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular ion peak, IR absorption, and ¹H NMR signals, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.  

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem says that a chemist found an unnamed white solid and gathered some spectral data to identify it. We need to use the given information to figure out which option is correct among A, B, C, D.

The data provided includes mass, IR, and 1H NMR spectra. Let's break down each piece of information.

First, the Mass spectrometry (MS). The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 (100%), and there's another peak at m/z 158 (32%). Hmm, molecular ion is the main peak, so the molecular weight is 156. The 158 peak might be a fragment or an isotope. Wait, but 158 is two units higher than 156. So, what could cause that? Maybe the presence of a chlorine isotope? Chlorine has a natural abundance of about 75% for the 35Cl isotope and about 25% for 37Cl. So if the molecular ion is at 156 (probably the 35Cl isotope), the 158 peak would be when a 37Cl is present. So the molecule should have a chlorine atom. That makes sense.

Next, the IR spectrum. It shows a broad peak between 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in that region usually indicate O-H stretch. O-H can be from an alcohol, phenol, carboxylic acid, or maybe an aldehyde. But wait, the other strong sharp peak is at 1720 cm^-1. That's a strong carbonyl (C=O) peak. So what carbonyl groups have a peak around 1720? Carboxylic acids typically have a carbonyl around 1700, maybe a bit higher. Esters usually around 1730-1750. Aldehydes are around 2800 (stretch) and 1720-1710. Wait, but the IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700, which is probably O-H. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid because the O-H in carboxylic acids is usually broad, due to hydrogen bonding. Alternatively, an alcohol would have a broad O-H, but if it's a phenol, the O-H is also broad. But let's think about the NMR next.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), and 7.72 (d, 2H). So 11 ppm is a strong singlet. What kind of proton resonates at 11? That's a very high chemical shift. For aromatic protons, they're usually around 7-8.5 ppm. An aldehyde proton is usually around 9-10, but 11 is a bit high. Alternatively, a carboxylic acid proton is around 10-12, which fits. So that 11 ppm peak is likely the -COOH proton. The broad IR peak would fit with that as well.

The other NMR signals: 8.02 and 7.72, both doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests two sets of two equivalent aromatic protons. So in a benzene ring, perhaps a para-substituted group, but depending on substituents.

Wait, let's think about the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's see. Structure would be benzaldehyde with a hydroxyl and chloro groups. The aldehyde proton would be around 9-10, but the NMR shows 11.0. Hmm, maybe it's close. Also, the IR has a carbonyl peak at 1720. Benzaldehyde's carbonyl is about 1700, but maybe the ionization or conjugation shifts it. But wait, the IR also has a broad O-H, which would need to come from something else. Option A has a hydroxyl group (-OH) on the benzene ring, which would give a broad peak in IR. But the NMR shows a singlet at 11.0—if it's an aldehyde, that would be a triplet perhaps? Or maybe an -OH as a broad peak, but in the options, maybe not. Wait, the NMR doesn't mention a broad peak, only three signals. So maybe the aldehyde is a singlet. Wait, but aldehydes typically show a triplet or a singlet, but in some cases a triplet if coupled with adjacent protons. But in this case, the 11.0 is a singlet. Wait, but the -COOH proton is a broad peak, but in the NMR, the 11.0 is a singlet, which is sharp, not broad. Hmm, that might not fit.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is a chlorobenzene with a carboxylic acid group. So the benzene ring is substituted with Cl and COOH. The NMR would have the COOH proton at ~11 ppm as a singlet. Then, the aromatic protons would be in a pattern. Since the substituents are in para positions, the H adjacent to Cl and COOH would be deshielded. Let's see: the 1H NMR shows two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72. That suggests two sets of two equivalent protons each. For benzoic acid, if it's 4-chloro, the ring would have two sets of two Hs. Let me imagine the structure: Cl is at position 4, COOH at position 1. Then the Hs at 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and at 3 and 5 equivalent. So the Hs ortho to Cl (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded than meta. Wait, COOH is at position 1, Cl at 4. So the Hs at positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH (position 1) and Cl is opposite. Alternatively, maybe the Hs are in the meta positions. Hmm, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in such a way that the two doublets are from the aromatic protons.

In the NMR, the 8.02 (d) and 7.72 (d) each have 2H. So each is a doublet—so each of these groups of H is coupled with one neighboring group. For a para-substituted benzene, like Cl and COOH in para positions, the Hs would be in pairs. So for example, in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring has COOH at position 1 and Cl at position 4. Then the Hs at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, each adjacent to COOH. Those Hs would be ortho to COOH. They'd be deshielded and appear downfield. The Hs at positions 3 and 5 would be meta to Cl and meta to COOH, perhaps appearing upfield. Wait, but in the NMR, the two doublets are at 8.02 and 7.72. Both are downfield but in different regions. So maybe the 8.02 is ortho to Cl and the 7.72 is meta? Or perhaps the substituents are in positions that cause this.

Wait, the NMR of benzoic acid derivatives: for benzoic acid, the COOH proton is around 11 ppm. The aromatic protons ortho to the COOH group are typically around 8 ppm. So for 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). The Hs at 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. Those Hs are usually more deshielded, so higher ppm. The Hs at 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. Which would be less deshielded, lower ppm.

So, for 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the 2H at 8.02 ppm (d) would be the Hs ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6), and the 2H at 7.72 would be the Hs at 3 and 5, which are ortho to Cl. Wait, but Cl is a de-shielding group, but in which position?

Alternatively, perhaps the two doublets in the NMR are due to being para to each other. Wait, no—each is a doublet with J coupling, so each set of Hs is adjacent to one other set.

Wait, let me think about the splitting. For a para-disubstituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions (like Cl and COOH), the ring might have two sets of equivalent protons. So, the Hs adjacent to the substituents would have certain chemical shifts.

But perhaps I should draw the structure. Let's imagine 4-chlorobenzoic acid: COOH is at position 1, Cl at 4.

The Hs at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. These would be more deshielded because of the electron-withdrawing COOH group. So their chemical shift would be higher, around 8.0 ppm.

The Hs at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. Cl is an electron-withdrawing group as well. So their shifts would be lower than the ortho Hs but perhaps around 7.7 ppm.

So in the NMR, the two doublets would correspond to these sets. Each H is adjacent to two substituents? Or perhaps each H is next to another H that's part of the same substituent.

Wait, the splitting in the NMR: each doublet has a coupling constant J. For aromatic protons, the coupling is typically between adjacent protons. So in a benzene ring, each proton is coupled with its immediate neighbors. But in the case of a para-substituted ring with two substituents, the coupling between the Hs might be more complex.

Wait, but in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring has substituents at positions 1 and 4. So the H at position 2 is next to H at 3. Similarly, H at 6 is next to H at 5.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The positions are 1 (COOH), 2, 3, 4 (Cl), 5, 6.

H at 2 is adjacent to H at 3. H at 3 is adjacent to H at 4 (Cl), but that's a substituent, not H. H at 5 is adjacent to H at 6, and H at 6 is adjacent to H at 1 (COOH, which is a substituent). So for H at 2, it's adjacent to H at 3 and H at 1 (unlikely, since H at 1 is a substituent, not an H). Wait, no, the substituents are at 1 and 4. So H at 2 is between substituent 1 and H3. H at 6 is between substituent 1 and H5.

Wait, perhaps this is getting complicated. Alternatively, the splitting in the NMR could be due to the substituents causing each set of Hs to have two neighbors, leading to doublets.

Alternatively, maybe the two substituents (Cl and COOH) are in such a way that each H on the ring has only one neighboring H, causing a doublet.

But perhaps I should think about the options.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. That would be OClCOPh. Wait, no, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the structure is Cl-CO-O attached to benzene. The NMR would have the Cl as a carbonyl group. But wait, in chloroformate, the carbonyl is part of the ester group. The substituents would be OCl and OPh attached to the carbonyl.

But the molecular ion is 156. Let me calculate the molecular weight of each option.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Chlorine is Cl (35.5). So molecular weight would be (7*12) + (6*1) + (2*16) + 35.5 = 84 +6 +32 +35.5= 157.5. Wait, but the molecular ion is 156. Hmm, that suggests 4-chlorobenzoic acid would have a molecular weight of about 157.5, but the molecular ion is at m/z 156. So that might not fit. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, molecular formula of 4-chlorobenzoic acid is C7H5ClO2. Because benzoic acid is C7H6O2, but replacing one H with Cl would be C7H5ClO2.

Calculating the molecular weight: C=12*7=84, H=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. So total is 84 +5 +35.5 +32 = 156.5. So the molecular ion would be at 156.5, which rounds to 157? Or perhaps the mass is given as 156. So maybe that's a problem. Because the molecular ion is at 156, but 4-chlorobenzoic acid would be about 156.5, so maybe that's not matching.

Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156. So perhaps the molecular weight is 156. Let me check the options.

Option C: phenyl chloroformate.

Phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The formula is C8H7ClO2. Molecular weight: C=12*8=96, H=7, Cl=35.5, O=32. Total: 96 +7=103, 103 +35.5=138.5, 138.5+32=170.5. So molecular weight about 170.5. But the molecular ion is 156, so that can't be option C.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake on the formula. Phenyl chloroformate is O=C(OCl)Ph? No, wait. Chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-R. So R is phenyl. So the formula for phenyl chloroformate is C6H5-O-CO-Cl. So the formula is C7H5ClO2. Wait, wait: C6H5 is 6 carbons, O is one, COCl is another, so total carbons: 6 + (COCl is 2 carbons? No, wait, COCl is one carbon with double bond O and Cl. So the structure is Cl-C(O)-O-C6H5. So the formula is C7H5ClO2. So molecular weight is (7*12) +5 +35.5 + (2*16) = 84 +5=89, 89+35.5=124.5, 124.5+32=156.5. So about 156.5. The molecular ion is at 156, so that fits. Because the exact mass for 4-chlorobenzoic acid would be 156.5, but the molecular ion is at 156. Maybe it's a rounding thing. Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula is C6H5ClO2, but that can’t be—benzoic acid is C7H6O2, so adding Cl would make it C7H5ClO2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me calculate each option's molecular weight.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

Structure: benzaldehyde with Cl at position 3 and OH at position 2.

The formula would be C7H5ClO2. Because benzaldehyde is C7H6O, but substituting two Hs: one with Cl and another with OH. Wait, no: benzaldehyde is C7H6O (Ph-CHO), molecular formula C7H6O. If we add a Cl and an OH, replacing two Hs, the formula would be C7H5ClO2.

Molecular weight: 7*12=84, H=5, Cl=35.5, O=32. Total 84+5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So molecular weight 156.5. So the molecular ion would be at m/z 157? But the given is 156, so maybe that's a problem. Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated.

Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as option A. So molecular weight is 156.5 as well.

Wait, but the molecular ion is at 156. So both options A and B would have a molecular weight near 157, but the molecular ion is at 156. Hmmm. But wait, maybe the molecular ion is at the exact mass. Let me think: the exact mass of C7H5ClO2.

Carbon is 12.01, H is 1.008, Cl is 34.97, O is 16.00.

So exact mass: 7*12.01 = 84.07, 5*1.008=5.04, Cl=34.97, 2*16=32. So 84.07 +5.04=89.11 +34.97=124.08 +32=156.08. So the molecular ion is at 156.08, which would be observed around m/z 156. So options A and B have the same molecular weight.

Now, let's look at the IR and NMR of each.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The IR would show a strong O-H stretch (carboxylic acid) as a broad peak around 2500-3500, which matches the given IR. The strong peak at 1720 cm^-1 is the carbonyl, which would be about right for a carboxylic acid (usually around 1700, but maybe a bit higher). 

The NMR of 4-chlorobenzoic acid: The COOH proton is a broad peak around 11 ppm, but in the given data, the peak at 11 is a singlet, so maybe it's split into a singlet because it's exchanging and not coupled to any other protons. The aromatic protons: as I thought earlier, the two sets of doublets would correspond to the ortho and meta positions. The Hs ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded and appear around 8 ppm as a doublet. The Hs at 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH and ortho to Cl, which is also electron-withdrawing. So their chemical shift would be lower, perhaps around 7.7 ppm. The splitting into doublets would be because each H is coupled with one neighboring H. So each set of two Hs (in positions 2&6 and 3&5) would each be a doublet, each integrating for 2H. That matches the NMR data given.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure would be Cl at position 2 and COOH at position 1. So the substituents are adjacent. The NMR would be different in this case because of the proximity of substituents. The aromatic protons would be in a different pattern. For 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the aromatic ring would have the COOH at position 1 and Cl at 2. The Hs at positions 3 and 6 would be adjacent to substituents, so their shifts would be more downfield. The Hs at 4 and 5 would be more shielded. The splitting would be more complex, perhaps leading to triplets or other multiplets. But the NMR given is two doublets, which may not fit.

Looking back at the options, the NMR data has two doublets for the aromatic protons, each integrating 2H. That fits better with para-substituted rings, such as option B.

Now, the mass data: the molecular ion is at 156, and the isotopic peak is at 158 (32%). Since the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2, which has one Cl atom, the isotopic pattern should have about 37Cl. So the molecular ion peak at 156 is mainly due to 35Cl (which is 75% abundant), and the 158 peak is 37Cl (25% abundant), but since it's 32%, which is about 37Cl (25%), perhaps the peak is 158 and has 25% abundance, but the given is 32%. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me think: The molecular ion consists of two isotopic peaks. The major peak is M (156) which is 35Cl-based. The next peak would be M+2 (158) from 37Cl. The ratio of their intensities is about 75:25. But the problem states that the M is 100%, and the M+2 is 32%. That would be a ratio of 100/32 = about 3.125. But 75/25 =3. So that matches. So the presence of two peaks, 156 and 158, with a 3:1 ratio, supports the presence of a Cl atom. So the molecular formula includes Cl, as we thought earlier.

Now, looking at the options, both options B and D are benzoic acids with Cl, but option B is para, D is ortho.

In the NMR, the two doublets suggest a para-substituted ring. So for option B, the two substituents (Cl and COOH) are para. That would create two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, each as a doublet. So the NMR would match.

Option A is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let's see what the NMR would look like. The structure has a benzene ring with Cl at 3, OH at 2, and aldehyde (CHO) at position 1. Wait, no, if it's 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde, the substituents are Cl at 3, OH at 2, and CHO at 1. So the ring would be 1-CHO, 2-OH, 3-Cl.

The aromatic protons would be at positions 4, 5, and 6. Wait, no, because the substituents are at 1, 2, 3. So the Hs would be at 4,5,6 positions. But wait, how many Hs are there? In benzaldehyde, the substituents would take up three positions, leaving three Hs on the ring. But in this case, it's three substituents: CHO, OH, Cl. So the ring would have only three Hs, but how?

Wait, no. Wait, let's number the ring: position 1 is CHO, position 2 is OH, position 3 is Cl. Then positions 4,5,6 would have Hs. But in that case, the Hs at 4 and 6 would be adjacent to substituents, and H at 5 would be meta.

Wait, but this would result in three sets of Hs, perhaps. So the NMR would have more signals than what is given. The given NMR has three signals: one at 11ppm (singlet), and two doublets. So if the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative, maybe the NMR would have more than three signals. So perhaps option A is not the right fit.

Furthermore, the 11 ppm peak in the NMR is more likely a COOH proton than an aldehyde. Aldehydes are usually around 9-10, but sometimes higher. However, the singlet at 11 ppm is more indicative of a carboxylic acid proton.

So, putting it all together, the IR shows O-H (broad) and a carbonyl (sharp), which fits a carboxylic acid. The NMR shows a singlet at 11 (COOH), and two doublets for the aromatic Hs, which fits a para-substituted benzoic acid. The molecular weight is 156, which fits option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid).

Wait, but I thought option B's molecular formula would have a molecular weight of 156.5. But the molecular ion is at 156, which is exact. Maybe in the problem, it's rounded. So the correct option is B.


The problem involves identifying an unknown white solid using spectral data. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** and the presence of a secondary peak at **m/z = 158** suggest the molecule has a chlorine atom, as the isotopic abundance ratio of **35Cl (75%)** to **37Cl (25%)** matches the observed **3:1** ratio. The molecular weight of the compound is therefore **156**.

The IR spectrum shows a **broad peak between 3500-2700 cm⁻¹**, indicative of an O-H stretch, and a **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**, characteristic of a carbonyl group. This strongly suggests the compound is a **carboxylic acid**, as carboxylic acids exhibit both broad O-H stretches and carbonyl peaks in this range.

The **¹H NMR** data provides further clues:
- A **singlet at 11.0 ppm** corresponds to the deshielded proton of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).
- Two **doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H)** and **7.72 ppm (2H)** suggest the presence of two sets of equivalent aromatic protons, consistent with a **para-substituted benzene ring**.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   This compound contains an aldehyde group (-CHO), which would typically resonate around **9-10 ppm** in the ¹H NMR. However, the observed singlet at **11.0 ppm** is more consistent with a carboxylic acid proton (-COOH). Additionally, the aromatic proton pattern does not match, as the substituents (Cl, OH, CHO) would result in more complex splitting.  
   **Eliminated.**

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and a chlorine atom on a **para-substituted benzene ring**.  
   - The **singlet at 11.0 ppm** matches the -COOH proton.  
   - The two **doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H)** and **7.72 ppm (2H)** correspond to the aromatic protons ortho and meta to the substituents, respectively.  
   - The molecular formula **C₇H₅ClO₂** has a molecular weight of **156.5**, which aligns with the molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156**.  
   **Matches all data.**

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   This compound contains a chloroformate group (Cl-CO-O-Ph), which would not produce a broad O-H stretch in the IR spectrum. Additionally, the molecular weight of phenyl chloroformate is **170.5**, which does not match the molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156**.  
   **Eliminated.**

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound has a carboxylic acid group and a chlorine atom on an **ortho-substituted benzene ring**. The aromatic proton pattern for such a structure would not produce two distinct doublets, as the substituents would result in more complex splitting.  
   **Eliminated.**

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, including the molecular ion peak, IR absorption, and ¹H NMR signals, are most consistent with **4-chlorobenzoic acid**.  

**Answer: B**
