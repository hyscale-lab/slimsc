Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an -OH group, maybe from a carboxylic acid because that's a broad peak. Then there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That's common in carboxylic acids, esters, or maybe ketones. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions might be aromatic C=C stretches. So putting that together, the compound might have a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group, like a benzoic acid or an ester.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 1H). That's a high chemical shift, which often corresponds to an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Then 8.0 ppm as a doublet (d, 2H). That's in the aromatic region, probably para-substituted. The 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) is another doublet, which would fit with a para-substituted benzene. So maybe we have a para-substituted benzene with another group attached, perhaps a carbonyl.

Then 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's break that down. The triplet at 0.9 ppm with 3H is likely a methyl group connected to a CH2, maybe a CH2CH3. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H) could be CH2 groups, and the 2.9 ppm (1H) might be a CH connected to something else, perhaps an oxygen or another carbon.

Putting the NMR together, the aromatic protons suggest a para-substituted benzene, maybe with a substituent like a carbonyl group. The other peaks suggest a chain of carbons attached. Let's think about the structure: if there's a benzene ring with a substituent like a CH2CH(CH3)2 or something similar. Wait, the substituent might be a butyl group, maybe a sec-butyl.

Wait, let me draw this out mentally. The downfield shift at 10.5 ppm is the -COOH proton. So the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. Then the rest of the NMR:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): para to the substituent, so if the substituent is at position 4, then the two protons ortho to it are at 8.0, and the two meta are at 7.2, but wait, no, that's for a substituent that's deactivating. Alternatively, if the substituent is at position 4, then the neighboring protons (ortho and para) would be split differently.

Wait, benzoic acid has substituent at position 1, so perhaps the substituent is at position 4 relative to the COOH. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. If the substituent is at position 4 of the benzene ring, then the two protons adjacent to it (ortho) would be at 8.0 ppm, and the other two (para to substituent) would be at 7.2. Hmm, that makes sense.

So the substituent is at position 4, and the group attached is a chain that gives the NMR signals we have. The substituent is probably a CH2CH(CH3)2 or something similar. Wait, looking at the NMR shifts:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is perhaps a CH that's attached to the benzene. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be two CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH (so it's like CH(CH3)), and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH2CH3. So putting that together: the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, because the 1.4 is a doublet (d), which would correspond to a CH3 attached to a CH. So the structure could be like CH2CH(CH3)2, but wait:

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group but with branching. Let me think: the substituent is connected to the ring, then a CH, then a CH2, then a CH3. Wait, maybe it's a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group? Or perhaps a -CH2CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3? No, that seems off.

Wait, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. Because a sec-butyl group would have a structure like -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, wait, the substituent would be attached to the benzene as a substituent. Let me think about the substituent.

The NMR suggests the substituent is a chain with a branching. Let's count the protons:

- The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H): likely a CH2CH3 group.
- The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H): a CH3 attached to a CH (so -CH(CH3)).
- The multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H): perhaps the two CH2 groups, like -CH2-CH2-.

But wait, maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3? No, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but how does that fit.

Wait, let's think about the substituent as a butyl group. The substituent attached to the benzene is a propyl group with a branch. Let's think: the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's a pentyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no. A sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of the structure again. The substituent is attached to the ring as R. The substituent R is a chain that has the following in its NMR:

- A triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H): a CH2CH3 group (so, like a methyl at the end of a CH2).
- A doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H): a CH3 attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH2.
- A multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H): perhaps two CH2 groups.
- A multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H): a CH attached to something else.

Wait, here's another approach. Let's imagine the substituent is a propyl group, but with a branch. For example, a substituent like CH2CH(CH3)2. Hmm, but how would that split the NMR signals?

Alternatively, the substituent could be a butyl group, perhaps a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. But that might not add up.

Wait, what if the substituent is a propyl group where the middle CH is attached to a methyl group. So, substituent is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, that can't be right because the branching would require a more complex structure.

Wait, maybe it's a tertiary butyl group. Let's think: the substituent is -C(CH2CH3)(CH3)2. No, that would be a neopentyl group. But in that case, the NMR would have different peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)CH2-? No, no. Wait, a butyl group is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but the sec-butyl is when the substituent is on the second carbon. So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, but that's a isobutyl group. So substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2, right? So the substituent would be isobutyl.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again. The 2.9 ppm (1H, m) suggests a CH group that's connected perhaps to another CH2. The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) would be two CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (3H, d) is a CH3 attached to a CH. And the 0.9 ppm (3H, t) is a CH2CH3 group.

So, putting that together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 group. Wait, but that would be pentyl. Hmm, perhaps it's a propyl group with branching.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that's a pentyl group. Alternatively, a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Wait, maybe it's a butyl group with a branch. So, substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, but then the NMR would have different shifts.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-2 group. Wait, no, that's not possible. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group with another CH2 attached. So, substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that's a pentyl group, but the NMR doesn't seem to match.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me think about the structure. A sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. Wait, no, a sec-butyl group is -CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should draw this mentally.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene, where the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So, substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's four carbons.

Wait, another approach: the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl, which in a benzoic acid would be around 1700 cm-1. So, that fits. So the compound is a benzoic acid with a substituent on the ring.

So the structure is something like para-substituted benzoic acid, where the substituent is an alkyl group.

Looking at the NMR, the substituent's protons are:

At 2.9 ppm (1H, m): perhaps a CH adjacent to an oxygen, but in this case, it's connected to the benzene ring. So maybe the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, the substituent's protons:

The substituent is a chain attached to the benzene. The NMR shows:

- 1H at 2.9 ppm (m): perhaps a CH connected to two CH2 groups.

- 2H at 1.7 ppm (m): two CH2 groups.

- 3H at 1.4 ppm (d): a CH3 attached to a CH.

- 3H at 0.9 ppm (t): a CH2CH3 group.

So perhaps the substituent is a propyl group where the middle CH is connected to a CH3. So substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would be a pentyl group, but the substituent is only three carbons away from the ring? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So, substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-CH3? No, that's four carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. So, substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2, which would make it a -CH2C(CH3)2 group. But that's a tertiary structure. In that case, the NMR might show a singlet for the CH3 groups, but in the data, we have a doublet at 1.4 ppm. So that's not matching.

Wait, another thought: the substituent might be a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. So, the substituent is a butyl group with a branch.

But let's think about the structure. For the substituent, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a CH2CH3. Then, a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) would be a CH3 attached to a CH, which is adjacent to the CH2 group. The multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H) would be two CH2 groups. Then, the 2.9 ppm (1H) could be the CH connected to all these groups.

So perhaps the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-CH3? No, that's a pentyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group? Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. So, that would be an isobutyl group. Wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no. Let me recall: isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, wait, no. The isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So, substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2.

But in that case, the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2CH3, which is at 0.9 ppm. Then, the adjacent CH would have a triplet or something, but in our data, there's a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H), which could be the CH connected to the two CH3 groups. Hmm, but in that structure, the CH would have two CH3 groups attached, which would make it a -CH(CH3)2 group, but that's a tert-butyl group.

Wait, the NMR for a tert-butyl group would show a singlet for the nine equivalent H's, but in our case, the substituent's NMR is split into multiple peaks, so perhaps it's not a tert-butyl.

Wait, another approach: let's see how the substituent might look. The substituent is attached to the benzene ring. The substituent is a chain that has the following structure: R = CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That would be a pentyl group with a branch. But our substituent is on the benzene, which is a four-carbon chain? Hmm, but the NMR shows four different types of protons for the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, that's a neopentyl group. The NMR would have a singlet for the CH3 groups, but we have a doublet for the CH3. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, substituent would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Then, the NMR would have:

The CH2CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

The CH2 would be adjacent to the CH, which is attached to the benzene. The CH would have neighboring protons from the CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. So, substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-CH3. Hmm, that's a five-carbon substituent.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the substituent. Let me think about the options given in the multiple-choice.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, the compound X is reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Hiyama reaction, but more commonly, red phosphorus is used in the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction. Wait, no, red phosphorus with HI is used for the deoxygenation of ketones to alkanes, but I think it's more commonly used for the deoxygenation of epoxides. Wait, more accurately, red phosphorus and HI are used to cleave epoxides. Alternatively, I think that when a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it converts the carboxylic acid group to an iodide.

Wait, no, wait. Upon further thought, I think when a carboxylic acid is treated with phosphorus and HI, it converts the -COOH group into a -CH2- group. Because in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, the carboxylic acid is converted into an alkane. The reaction is known as the Clemmensen reduction, but wait, Clemmensen is for reducing ketones to alkanes using Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat. Wait, another reaction: the reduction of carboxylic acids to alkanes can be done using LiAlH4, but that gives alkanes. Alternatively, using phosphorus and HI, perhaps.

Wait, I think the reaction is: RCOOH + P + HI → RCH2I + other products.

Wait, perhaps when a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it converts the COOH group into CH2I. Let me confirm this. Yes, I think that's correct. The carboxylic acid is converted into an alkyl iodide by this treatment.

So, if the original compound X is a benzoic acid derivative (because of the IR and NMR data), then the reaction would replace the COOH group with CH2I.

So, for example, if X is 4-(something)benzoic acid, then after reaction, it becomes 4-(something) benzyl iodide.

Wait, but looking at the reaction, perhaps more accurately, the COOH is replaced by CH2I. So, the benzoic acid group becomes a CH2I group attached to the benzene.

But wait, let's look at the options again. The options are products after the reaction. Let's see:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That's a benzoic acid, so if X is this, then after reaction, the COOH would be converted to CH2I. But none of the options show an iodide.

Wait, but the options are the products of the reaction. So, if X is a benzoic acid, the product after reaction would have a CH2I group. But none of the options have iodide. Therefore, perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Benzoin condensation, but that's when using cyanide. Hmm, no.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -OH (from the carboxylic acid) is replaced by iodide. But that would give a carboxylic acid iodide, which is not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on an ester, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, maybe the IR data suggests an ester instead of a carboxylic acid. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is typical for an ester. A carboxylic acid would have a peak around 1700 cm-1 but broader. Also, the 3400–2500 cm-1 peak could correspond to an -OH from an ester (like an alcohol), but esters don't have OH groups. So perhaps the compound is an ester.

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is characteristic of an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. So that's conflicting. Esters don't have that. So it's more likely a carboxylic acid.

So, assuming X is a benzoic acid with a substituent, the reaction replaces the COOH with CH2I. So, the product would be a benzyl iodide derivative.

But looking at the options, none of them have iodide. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a substitution where the -OH is replaced by an iodide. So, -COOH becomes -CH2I.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then the product after reaction would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl iodide, which would be 4-(sec-butyl)phenylmethane iodide. However, none of the options show that. So perhaps the options are the structures of X, and the reaction's product is one of these.

Wait, no, the question says "Identify the final product." The options are possible products, I think. So, perhaps the reaction is a substitution to remove the COOH group.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the structure of X. Let's try to figure out X's structure.

From NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): -COOH proton.

- 8.0 and 7.2 ppm (each d, 2H): para substitution on benzene.

The substituent is at position 4. So, the structure is:

Benzoic acid with a substituent at position 4.

The substituent's NMR:

At 2.9 ppm (1H, m), 1.7 ppm (2H, m), 1.4 ppm (3H, d), 0.9 ppm (3H, t).

So, substituent is a chain attached to benzene. That substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group? Or perhaps a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, the substituent is likely a propyl group with a branch, such as a isopropyl group. Wait, but isopropyl would have a singlet for the CH3 groups.

Alternatively, the substituent is a butyl group, perhaps a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let's think about a sec-butyl group. The structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. So, substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene.

Wait, but how would that fit the NMR?

The substituent would have:

- The terminal CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, t, 3H).

- The CH2 adjacent to that (1.7 ppm, m, 2H).

- The CH attached to the benzene (2.9 ppm, m, 1H).

- And the CH3 attached to the CH (1.4 ppm, d, 3H).

Wait, that seems to fit.

So, substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. But wait, that's a pentyl group? No, because the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-CH3, that would be a pentyl group. Wait, no, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group attached to the benzene. So, the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, making it a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene. So, the structure of X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Which matches option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

As per my earlier thoughts, the reaction would replace the COOH group with CH2I. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl iodide, which would be 4-(sec-butyl)phenylmethane iodide. But looking at the options, none of them have iodide. So perhaps the reaction isn't that.

Wait, perhaps I'm misremembering the reaction. Another possibility is that when a carboxylic acid reacts with phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a substitution to form an alkyl iodide, but perhaps the COOH is converted to CH2I.

So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl iodide. But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl chloride, but that's done with PCl5, not HI.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the -OH of the carboxylic acid is replaced by I, but that would give a carboxylic iodide, which is not listed in the options.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is deprotonation and substitution, but without more info, it's tricky.

Wait, the options given are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, the product after reaction must be one of these. So, the product must not be a carboxylic acid unless the reaction doesn't affect the COOH group. But since the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which are strong reagents, I think the COOH group is modified.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not on the COOH group, but on another functional group. Let me reevaluate the IR data.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester. So, perhaps compound X is an ester with a benzene ring and an ester group.

But then, the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more in line with a carboxylic acid. Esters have a carbonyl, but their O-H (if any) is not present, so the 10.5 ppm peak must be something else. Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde proton, but that's unlikely given the other data.

Wait, another functional group with a peak around 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde (RCHO), but the IR doesn't show a peak around 2800 cm-1, which would be for aldehyde C-H. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol, but the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 would be a carbonyl, so that's unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assessment. Let's think again about the IR data.

IR peaks:

3400–2500 cm-1: broad, could be an -OH (like in a carboxylic acid) or maybe an alcohol, but in this case, more likely a carboxylic acid because of the 1720 cm-1.

1720 cm-1: strong peak, probably a carbonyl, so either an ester, ketone, or carboxylic acid. But the 3400-2500 suggests an -OH, which points to a carboxylic acid.

So, back to the NMR.

The substituent on the benzene is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. So, substituent is a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, so the substituent is a propyl group, making it a butyl group. So, the substituent is a butyl group attached to the benzene. But wait, how does that fit?

Another possibility: the substituent is a propyl group, so the chain is CH2CH2CH3. But that wouldn't fit the NMR data.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Its structure is:

benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4. The substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group.

So, the NMR for option C's substituent would give:

- The CH3 group on the CH would be a triplet? Or a doublet? Let's see.

In a sec-butyl group, the structure is:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-

Wait, no, the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to benzene.

So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, that's a pentyl group, but perhaps it's a butyl group. Let me re-examine.

So, the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group:

Structure: benzene ring with a -COOH group at position 1 (assuming), and a substituent at position 4 which is a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the substituent's protons:

The CH2 group attached to the ring would be split into a triplet or something, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, and the NMR data fits that.

So, substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

In that case, the substituent's protons would be:

- The terminal CH3: triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H).

- The adjacent CH2: quartet at 1.7 ppm (2H).

- The CH attached to the benzene and to the CH2 and CH(CH3): multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H).

- The CH3 attached to the CH: doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H).

Yes, that matches the NMR data given: 0.9 ppm (t,3H); 1.7 ppm (m,2H); 1.4 ppm (d,3H); 2.9 ppm (m,1H).

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, and the compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

Now, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. As I thought earlier, this reaction typically converts carboxylic acids to alkanes. So, the COOH group would be replaced by CH3, but wait, that's the Clemmensen reduction, which requires stronger conditions. Alternatively, another reaction: perhaps the carboxylic acid is converted into an iodide.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction replaces the -OH of the carboxylic acid with an iodide. So, the -COOH becomes -CH2I. Thus, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl iodide.

But looking at the options, none of them are iodides. So perhaps the reaction is not on the COOH group but on another part.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the substituent. For example, if the substituent has a good leaving group, perhaps HI would substitute it. But the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which doesn't have a leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on an ester, but the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, maybe I was wrong about the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Hunsdiecker reaction, which converts alkyl halides to alkynes, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, another reaction: the Mitsunobu reaction uses DEAD and phosphine, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a deprotonation and substitution. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an iodide. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)phenylmethane iodide.

But none of the options are iodides. So perhaps the reaction doesn't change the structure, but the question is incorrectly set, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -OH is replaced by another group. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but more likely, I think the reaction removes the COOH group and replaces it with a CH2I.

But if the product is not in the options, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying X.

Alternatively, perhaps X is not a carboxylic acid but an ester. Let's reevaluate.

If X is an ester, the IR would show a peak around 1720 cm-1. The NMR would not have a peak at 10.5 ppm. So, that's conflicting.

So, perhaps X is a carboxylic acid, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI converts the COOH into CH2I.

But the options don't have an iodide. Therefore, perhaps the reaction isn't affecting the COOH group. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a di-iodination or something else.

Wait, another thought: when a carboxylic acid reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it can undergo a substitution where the -OH is replaced by -I. But that would give a carboxylic iodide, which isn't an option here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on an ester, but without more context, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the reaction as a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by -I. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl iodide.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the reaction isn't that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard-like reaction, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by a methyl group. That would give 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. But looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a xylene derivative with a sec-butyl group.

But in that case, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which would be option D.

Wait, but how would the reaction achieve that. Red phosphorus and HI are typically not used for such substitutions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution, but with a carboxylic acid, that's unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the reaction doesn't involve the COOH group. Maybe it's a substitution on the substituent.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. If the reaction is a substitution on the substituent, perhaps it replaces a hydrogen with iodine. That would give a substituted iodobenzene, but that's not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration of an alcohol to an alkene, but I don't see any OH groups in the substituent.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the reaction differently. Red phosphorus and HI can be used to cleave double bonds, but the starting material doesn't have a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where HI acts as a nucleophile. So, if the substituent has a good leaving group, like a tosylate, but the substituent in X is a sec-butyl group, so no.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an imidazole or something, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of the hydroxyl group in the carboxylic acid with iodide, but that gives a carboxylic acid iodide, which isn't an option.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's look at the options and see which one could be the product.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That's the same as X. So, if the reaction doesn't change X, perhaps it's not the case.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with an isobutyl group at position 1 and methyl at 4. No, but the substituents' positions are unclear.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and methyl at 4? No, it's actually a toluene with a sec-butyl group at position 1, and a methyl at position 4. Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so perhaps it's a xylene with a sec-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting the benzoic acid into toluene. For that, the COOH would be reduced to a methyl group. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which would be option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the COOH is reduced to a CH3 group, giving 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (option D).

But wait, how does the reaction achieve that? Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for deoxygenation of ketones to alkanes, but in this case, perhaps they're used to reduce the carboxylic acid to a methyl group.

So, the reaction would be:

RCOOH → RCH3.

Which would change the benzoic acid group into a methyl group.

So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D.

So, the correct answer would be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction between compound X and red phosphorus with HI. The analysis begins with interpreting the IR and NMR data to determine the structure of X.

### IR Data:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.

### NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: Characteristic of an -OH proton in a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Aromatic protons, suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: Likely a CH group adjacent to the benzene.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: Likely CH₂ groups in the substituent.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A CH₃ group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A CH₃ group at the end of a CH₂ chain.

### Structure of X:
The IR and NMR data suggest that X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group (-CH₂CH(CH₃)CH₂-) at position 4. The NMR data matches this structure:
- The **sec-butyl group** explains the signals at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are known to reduce carboxylic acids to alkanes. In this case, the -COOH group in X is converted into a -CH₃ group, resulting in **4-(sec-butyl)toluene**. This product corresponds to **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**, as the methyl group from the reduction is at position 1, and the sec-butyl group remains at position 4.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Incorrect, as the structure does not match the NMR data or the reaction conditions.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as the substituents do not match the structure of X or the reaction product.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: This is the structure of X, not the product after the reaction.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Correct, as it matches the product formed after the reduction of the carboxylic acid group.

### Conclusion:
The final product of the reaction is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data, and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

First, let's look at the IR data. The peaks are at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates an -OH group, maybe from a carboxylic acid because that's a broad peak. Then there's a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch. That's common in carboxylic acids, esters, or maybe ketones. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 regions might be aromatic C=C stretches. So putting that together, the compound might have a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group, like a benzoic acid or an ester.

Now looking at the 1H NMR data. The peaks are at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet (bs, 1H). That's a high chemical shift, which often corresponds to an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. Then 8.0 ppm as a doublet (d, 2H). That's in the aromatic region, probably para-substituted. The 7.2 ppm (d, 2H) is another doublet, which would fit with a para-substituted benzene. So maybe we have a para-substituted benzene with another group attached, perhaps a carbonyl.

Then 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Let's break that down. The triplet at 0.9 ppm with 3H is likely a methyl group connected to a CH2, maybe a CH2CH3. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH. The multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H) could be CH2 groups, and the 2.9 ppm (1H) might be a CH connected to something else, perhaps an oxygen or another carbon.

Putting the NMR together, the aromatic protons suggest a para-substituted benzene, maybe with a substituent like a carbonyl group. The other peaks suggest a chain of carbons attached. Let's think about the structure: if there's a benzene ring with a substituent like a CH2CH(CH3)2 or something similar. Wait, the substituent might be a butyl group, maybe a sec-butyl.

Wait, let me draw this out mentally. The downfield shift at 10.5 ppm is the -COOH proton. So the compound is a benzoic acid derivative. Then the rest of the NMR:

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): para to the substituent, so if the substituent is at position 4, then the two protons ortho to it are at 8.0, and the two meta are at 7.2, but wait, no, that's for a substituent that's deactivating. Alternatively, if the substituent is at position 4, then the neighboring protons (ortho and para) would be split differently.

Wait, benzoic acid has substituent at position 1, so perhaps the substituent is at position 4 relative to the COOH. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. If the substituent is at position 4 of the benzene ring, then the two protons adjacent to it (ortho) would be at 8.0 ppm, and the other two (para to substituent) would be at 7.2. Hmm, that makes sense.

So the substituent is at position 4, and the group attached is a chain that gives the NMR signals we have. The substituent is probably a CH2CH(CH3)2 or something similar. Wait, looking at the NMR shifts:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) is perhaps a CH that's attached to the benzene. Then 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) might be two CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH (so it's like CH(CH3)), and the 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH2CH3. So putting that together: the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, wait, because the 1.4 is a doublet (d), which would correspond to a CH3 attached to a CH. So the structure could be like CH2CH(CH3)2, but wait:

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group but with branching. Let me think: the substituent is connected to the ring, then a CH, then a CH2, then a CH3. Wait, maybe it's a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group? Or perhaps a -CH2CH2CH(CH3)2? No, that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)CH3? No, that seems off.

Wait, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group. Because a sec-butyl group would have a structure like -CH2CH(CH2CH3). Wait, no, wait, the substituent would be attached to the benzene as a substituent. Let me think about the substituent.

The NMR suggests the substituent is a chain with a branching. Let's count the protons:

- The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H): likely a CH2CH3 group.
- The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H): a CH3 attached to a CH (so -CH(CH3)).
- The multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H): perhaps the two CH2 groups, like -CH2-CH2-.

But wait, maybe it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH3? No, perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, but how does that fit.

Wait, let's think about the substituent as a butyl group. The substituent attached to the benzene is a propyl group with a branch. Let's think: the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's a pentyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no. A sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of the structure again. The substituent is attached to the ring as R. The substituent R is a chain that has the following in its NMR:

- A triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H): a CH2CH3 group (so, like a methyl at the end of a CH2).
- A doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H): a CH3 attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another CH2.
- A multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H): perhaps two CH2 groups.
- A multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H): a CH attached to something else.

Wait, here's another approach. Let's imagine the substituent is a propyl group, but with a branch. For example, a substituent like CH2CH(CH3)2. Hmm, but how would that split the NMR signals?

Alternatively, the substituent could be a butyl group, perhaps a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. But that might not add up.

Wait, what if the substituent is a propyl group where the middle CH is attached to a methyl group. So, substituent is CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, that can't be right because the branching would require a more complex structure.

Wait, maybe it's a tertiary butyl group. Let's think: the substituent is -C(CH2CH3)(CH3)2. No, that would be a neopentyl group. But in that case, the NMR would have different peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)CH2-? No, no. Wait, a butyl group is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but the sec-butyl is when the substituent is on the second carbon. So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, substituent is -CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, but that's a isobutyl group. So substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2? No, isobutyl is CH2CH(CH3)2, right? So the substituent would be isobutyl.

Wait, let me think about the NMR again. The 2.9 ppm (1H, m) suggests a CH group that's connected perhaps to another CH2. The 1.7 ppm (2H, m) would be two CH2 groups. The 1.4 ppm (3H, d) is a CH3 attached to a CH. And the 0.9 ppm (3H, t) is a CH2CH3 group.

So, putting that together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3 group. Wait, but that would be pentyl. Hmm, perhaps it's a propyl group with branching.

Wait, another approach: the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that's a pentyl group. Alternatively, a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. Wait, maybe it's a butyl group with a branch. So, substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, but then the NMR would have different shifts.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-2 group. Wait, no, that's not possible. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group with another CH2 attached. So, substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, that's a pentyl group, but the NMR doesn't seem to match.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group. Let me think about the structure. A sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-. Wait, no, a sec-butyl group is -CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should draw this mentally.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene, where the substituent is a CH2-CH(CH3)- group. So, substituent is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's four carbons.

Wait, another approach: the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1. That's a strong carbonyl, which in a benzoic acid would be around 1700 cm-1. So, that fits. So the compound is a benzoic acid with a substituent on the ring.

So the structure is something like para-substituted benzoic acid, where the substituent is an alkyl group.

Looking at the NMR, the substituent's protons are:

At 2.9 ppm (1H, m): perhaps a CH adjacent to an oxygen, but in this case, it's connected to the benzene ring. So maybe the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? Or perhaps it's a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, the substituent's protons:

The substituent is a chain attached to the benzene. The NMR shows:

- 1H at 2.9 ppm (m): perhaps a CH connected to two CH2 groups.

- 2H at 1.7 ppm (m): two CH2 groups.

- 3H at 1.4 ppm (d): a CH3 attached to a CH.

- 3H at 0.9 ppm (t): a CH2CH3 group.

So perhaps the substituent is a propyl group where the middle CH is connected to a CH3. So substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that would be a pentyl group, but the substituent is only three carbons away from the ring? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group? No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. So, substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-CH3? No, that's four carbons.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. So, substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2, which would make it a -CH2C(CH3)2 group. But that's a tertiary structure. In that case, the NMR might show a singlet for the CH3 groups, but in the data, we have a doublet at 1.4 ppm. So that's not matching.

Wait, another thought: the substituent might be a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. So, the substituent is a butyl group with a branch.

But let's think about the structure. For the substituent, the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), which is likely a CH2CH3. Then, a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) would be a CH3 attached to a CH, which is adjacent to the CH2 group. The multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H) would be two CH2 groups. Then, the 2.9 ppm (1H) could be the CH connected to all these groups.

So perhaps the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-CH3? No, that's a pentyl group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a -CH(CH2CH2CH3) group? Hmm.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a -CH(CH3)CH2CH3 group. So, that would be an isobutyl group. Wait, isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no. Let me recall: isobutyl is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-? No, wait, no. The isobutyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)2. So, substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)2.

But in that case, the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2CH3, which is at 0.9 ppm. Then, the adjacent CH would have a triplet or something, but in our data, there's a multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H), which could be the CH connected to the two CH3 groups. Hmm, but in that structure, the CH would have two CH3 groups attached, which would make it a -CH(CH3)2 group, but that's a tert-butyl group.

Wait, the NMR for a tert-butyl group would show a singlet for the nine equivalent H's, but in our case, the substituent's NMR is split into multiple peaks, so perhaps it's not a tert-butyl.

Wait, another approach: let's see how the substituent might look. The substituent is attached to the benzene ring. The substituent is a chain that has the following structure: R = CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. That would be a pentyl group with a branch. But our substituent is on the benzene, which is a four-carbon chain? Hmm, but the NMR shows four different types of protons for the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)2 group. Wait, that's a neopentyl group. The NMR would have a singlet for the CH3 groups, but we have a doublet for the CH3. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, substituent would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Then, the NMR would have:

The CH2CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

The CH2 would be adjacent to the CH, which is attached to the benzene. The CH would have neighboring protons from the CH2 groups.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. So, substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-CH3. Hmm, that's a five-carbon substituent.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the substituent. Let me think about the options given in the multiple-choice.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

Wait, the compound X is reacting with red phosphorus and HI. Red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the Hiyama reaction, but more commonly, red phosphorus is used in the Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction. Wait, no, red phosphorus with HI is used for the deoxygenation of ketones to alkanes, but I think it's more commonly used for the deoxygenation of epoxides. Wait, more accurately, red phosphorus and HI are used to cleave epoxides. Alternatively, I think that when a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it converts the carboxylic acid group to an iodide.

Wait, no, wait. Upon further thought, I think when a carboxylic acid is treated with phosphorus and HI, it converts the -COOH group into a -CH2- group. Because in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, the carboxylic acid is converted into an alkane. The reaction is known as the Clemmensen reduction, but wait, Clemmensen is for reducing ketones to alkanes using Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat. Wait, another reaction: the reduction of carboxylic acids to alkanes can be done using LiAlH4, but that gives alkanes. Alternatively, using phosphorus and HI, perhaps.

Wait, I think the reaction is: RCOOH + P + HI → RCH2I + other products.

Wait, perhaps when a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it converts the COOH group into CH2I. Let me confirm this. Yes, I think that's correct. The carboxylic acid is converted into an alkyl iodide by this treatment.

So, if the original compound X is a benzoic acid derivative (because of the IR and NMR data), then the reaction would replace the COOH group with CH2I.

So, for example, if X is 4-(something)benzoic acid, then after reaction, it becomes 4-(something) benzyl iodide.

Wait, but looking at the reaction, perhaps more accurately, the COOH is replaced by CH2I. So, the benzoic acid group becomes a CH2I group attached to the benzene.

But wait, let's look at the options again. The options are products after the reaction. Let's see:

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That's a benzoic acid, so if X is this, then after reaction, the COOH would be converted to CH2I. But none of the options show an iodide.

Wait, but the options are the products of the reaction. So, if X is a benzoic acid, the product after reaction would have a CH2I group. But none of the options have iodide. Therefore, perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Benzoin condensation, but that's when using cyanide. Hmm, no.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -OH (from the carboxylic acid) is replaced by iodide. But that would give a carboxylic acid iodide, which is not among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on an ester, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, maybe the IR data suggests an ester instead of a carboxylic acid. The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is typical for an ester. A carboxylic acid would have a peak around 1700 cm-1 but broader. Also, the 3400–2500 cm-1 peak could correspond to an -OH from an ester (like an alcohol), but esters don't have OH groups. So perhaps the compound is an ester.

Wait, but the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is characteristic of an -OH proton, like in a carboxylic acid. So that's conflicting. Esters don't have that. So it's more likely a carboxylic acid.

So, assuming X is a benzoic acid with a substituent, the reaction replaces the COOH with CH2I. So, the product would be a benzyl iodide derivative.

But looking at the options, none of them have iodide. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is a substitution where the -OH is replaced by an iodide. So, -COOH becomes -CH2I.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then the product after reaction would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl iodide, which would be 4-(sec-butyl)phenylmethane iodide. However, none of the options show that. So perhaps the options are the structures of X, and the reaction's product is one of these.

Wait, no, the question says "Identify the final product." The options are possible products, I think. So, perhaps the reaction is a substitution to remove the COOH group.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate the structure of X. Let's try to figure out X's structure.

From NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): -COOH proton.

- 8.0 and 7.2 ppm (each d, 2H): para substitution on benzene.

The substituent is at position 4. So, the structure is:

Benzoic acid with a substituent at position 4.

The substituent's NMR:

At 2.9 ppm (1H, m), 1.7 ppm (2H, m), 1.4 ppm (3H, d), 0.9 ppm (3H, t).

So, substituent is a chain attached to benzene. That substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group? Or perhaps a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group.

Wait, the substituent is likely a propyl group with a branch, such as a isopropyl group. Wait, but isopropyl would have a singlet for the CH3 groups.

Alternatively, the substituent is a butyl group, perhaps a sec-butyl group.

Wait, let's think about a sec-butyl group. The structure is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. So, substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene.

Wait, but how would that fit the NMR?

The substituent would have:

- The terminal CH2CH3 (0.9 ppm, t, 3H).

- The CH2 adjacent to that (1.7 ppm, m, 2H).

- The CH attached to the benzene (2.9 ppm, m, 1H).

- And the CH3 attached to the CH (1.4 ppm, d, 3H).

Wait, that seems to fit.

So, substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to the benzene. But wait, that's a pentyl group? No, because the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2-CH3, that would be a pentyl group. Wait, no, the substituent would be -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group attached to the benzene. So, the substituent is a propyl group with a branch, making it a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene. So, the structure of X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Which matches option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

As per my earlier thoughts, the reaction would replace the COOH group with CH2I. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl iodide, which would be 4-(sec-butyl)phenylmethane iodide. But looking at the options, none of them have iodide. So perhaps the reaction isn't that.

Wait, perhaps I'm misremembering the reaction. Another possibility is that when a carboxylic acid reacts with phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a substitution to form an alkyl iodide, but perhaps the COOH is converted to CH2I.

So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl iodide. But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl chloride, but that's done with PCl5, not HI.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the -OH of the carboxylic acid is replaced by I, but that would give a carboxylic iodide, which is not listed in the options.

Hmm, perhaps the reaction is deprotonation and substitution, but without more info, it's tricky.

Wait, the options given are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

So, the product after reaction must be one of these. So, the product must not be a carboxylic acid unless the reaction doesn't affect the COOH group. But since the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, which are strong reagents, I think the COOH group is modified.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is not on the COOH group, but on another functional group. Let me reevaluate the IR data.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be an ester. So, perhaps compound X is an ester with a benzene ring and an ester group.

But then, the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more in line with a carboxylic acid. Esters have a carbonyl, but their O-H (if any) is not present, so the 10.5 ppm peak must be something else. Alternatively, maybe the 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde proton, but that's unlikely given the other data.

Wait, another functional group with a peak around 10.5 ppm is an aldehyde (RCHO), but the IR doesn't show a peak around 2800 cm-1, which would be for aldehyde C-H. Alternatively, maybe it's an alcohol, but the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 would be a carbonyl, so that's unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assessment. Let's think again about the IR data.

IR peaks:

3400–2500 cm-1: broad, could be an -OH (like in a carboxylic acid) or maybe an alcohol, but in this case, more likely a carboxylic acid because of the 1720 cm-1.

1720 cm-1: strong peak, probably a carbonyl, so either an ester, ketone, or carboxylic acid. But the 3400-2500 suggests an -OH, which points to a carboxylic acid.

So, back to the NMR.

The substituent on the benzene is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group. So, substituent is a propyl group with a branch.

Wait, so the substituent is a propyl group, making it a butyl group. So, the substituent is a butyl group attached to the benzene. But wait, how does that fit?

Another possibility: the substituent is a propyl group, so the chain is CH2CH2CH3. But that wouldn't fit the NMR data.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Its structure is:

benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at position 4. The substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)- group.

So, the NMR for option C's substituent would give:

- The CH3 group on the CH would be a triplet? Or a doublet? Let's see.

In a sec-butyl group, the structure is:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-

Wait, no, the substituent is -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- attached to benzene.

So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, that's a pentyl group, but perhaps it's a butyl group. Let me re-examine.

So, the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group:

Structure: benzene ring with a -COOH group at position 1 (assuming), and a substituent at position 4 which is a sec-butyl group.

Wait, the substituent's protons:

The CH2 group attached to the ring would be split into a triplet or something, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, and the NMR data fits that.

So, substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

In that case, the substituent's protons would be:

- The terminal CH3: triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H).

- The adjacent CH2: quartet at 1.7 ppm (2H).

- The CH attached to the benzene and to the CH2 and CH(CH3): multiplet at 2.9 ppm (1H).

- The CH3 attached to the CH: doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H).

Yes, that matches the NMR data given: 0.9 ppm (t,3H); 1.7 ppm (m,2H); 1.4 ppm (d,3H); 2.9 ppm (m,1H).

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, and the compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

Now, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. As I thought earlier, this reaction typically converts carboxylic acids to alkanes. So, the COOH group would be replaced by CH3, but wait, that's the Clemmensen reduction, which requires stronger conditions. Alternatively, another reaction: perhaps the carboxylic acid is converted into an iodide.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction replaces the -OH of the carboxylic acid with an iodide. So, the -COOH becomes -CH2I. Thus, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl iodide.

But looking at the options, none of them are iodides. So perhaps the reaction is not on the COOH group but on another part.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the substituent. For example, if the substituent has a good leaving group, perhaps HI would substitute it. But the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which doesn't have a leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on an ester, but the compound is a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, maybe I was wrong about the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the Hunsdiecker reaction, which converts alkyl halides to alkynes, but that's not applicable here.

Wait, another reaction: the Mitsunobu reaction uses DEAD and phosphine, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a deprotonation and substitution. But without more info, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by an iodide. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)phenylmethane iodide.

But none of the options are iodides. So perhaps the reaction doesn't change the structure, but the question is incorrectly set, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -OH is replaced by another group. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a coupling reaction, but more likely, I think the reaction removes the COOH group and replaces it with a CH2I.

But if the product is not in the options, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying X.

Alternatively, perhaps X is not a carboxylic acid but an ester. Let's reevaluate.

If X is an ester, the IR would show a peak around 1720 cm-1. The NMR would not have a peak at 10.5 ppm. So, that's conflicting.

So, perhaps X is a carboxylic acid, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI converts the COOH into CH2I.

But the options don't have an iodide. Therefore, perhaps the reaction isn't affecting the COOH group. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a di-iodination or something else.

Wait, another thought: when a carboxylic acid reacts with HI and red phosphorus, it can undergo a substitution where the -OH is replaced by -I. But that would give a carboxylic iodide, which isn't an option here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution on an ester, but without more context, it's hard to say.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the reaction as a substitution where the -COOH is replaced by -I. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzyl iodide.

But since that's not an option, perhaps the reaction isn't that. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Grignard-like reaction, but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the -COOH group is replaced by a methyl group. That would give 4-(sec-butyl)toluene. But looking at the options, option D is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene, which is a xylene derivative with a sec-butyl group.

But in that case, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which would be option D.

Wait, but how would the reaction achieve that. Red phosphorus and HI are typically not used for such substitutions.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic acyl substitution, but with a carboxylic acid, that's unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the reaction doesn't involve the COOH group. Maybe it's a substitution on the substituent.

Wait, the substituent is a sec-butyl group. If the reaction is a substitution on the substituent, perhaps it replaces a hydrogen with iodine. That would give a substituted iodobenzene, but that's not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration of an alcohol to an alkene, but I don't see any OH groups in the substituent.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the reaction differently. Red phosphorus and HI can be used to cleave double bonds, but the starting material doesn't have a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where HI acts as a nucleophile. So, if the substituent has a good leaving group, like a tosylate, but the substituent in X is a sec-butyl group, so no.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an imidazole or something, but that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of the hydroxyl group in the carboxylic acid with iodide, but that gives a carboxylic acid iodide, which isn't an option.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to approach it differently. Let's look at the options and see which one could be the product.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That's the same as X. So, if the reaction doesn't change X, perhaps it's not the case.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene derivative with an isobutyl group at position 1 and methyl at 4. No, but the substituents' positions are unclear.

Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene. That's a toluene with a sec-butyl group at position 1 and methyl at 4? No, it's actually a toluene with a sec-butyl group at position 1, and a methyl at position 4. Wait, but benzene is symmetric, so perhaps it's a xylene with a sec-butyl group.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is converting the benzoic acid into toluene. For that, the COOH would be reduced to a methyl group. So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which would be option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then upon reaction with red phosphorus and HI, the COOH is reduced to a CH3 group, giving 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene (option D).

But wait, how does the reaction achieve that? Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for deoxygenation of ketones to alkanes, but in this case, perhaps they're used to reduce the carboxylic acid to a methyl group.

So, the reaction would be:

RCOOH → RCH3.

Which would change the benzoic acid group into a methyl group.

So, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)toluene, which is option D.

So, the correct answer would be option D.


The problem involves identifying the final product of a reaction between compound X and red phosphorus with HI. The analysis begins with interpreting the IR and NMR data to determine the structure of X.

### IR Data:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, consistent with a carboxylic acid.

### NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: Characteristic of an -OH proton in a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Aromatic protons, suggesting a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**: Likely a CH group adjacent to the benzene.
- **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**: Likely CH₂ groups in the substituent.
- **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**: A CH₃ group attached to a CH.
- **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: A CH₃ group at the end of a CH₂ chain.

### Structure of X:
The IR and NMR data suggest that X is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. The benzene ring has a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group (-CH₂CH(CH₃)CH₂-) at position 4. The NMR data matches this structure:
- The **sec-butyl group** explains the signals at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H).

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are known to reduce carboxylic acids to alkanes. In this case, the -COOH group in X is converted into a -CH₃ group, resulting in **4-(sec-butyl)toluene**. This product corresponds to **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**, as the methyl group from the reduction is at position 1, and the sec-butyl group remains at position 4.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Incorrect, as the structure does not match the NMR data or the reaction conditions.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Incorrect, as the substituents do not match the structure of X or the reaction product.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: This is the structure of X, not the product after the reaction.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Correct, as it matches the product formed after the reduction of the carboxylic acid group.

### Conclusion:
The final product of the reaction is **1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**.
