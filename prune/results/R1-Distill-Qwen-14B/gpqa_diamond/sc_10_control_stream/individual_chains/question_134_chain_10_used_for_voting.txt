Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. And we need to find the enthalpy change, right?

Wait, wait. I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually about the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The typical reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and the enthalpy change is around -57 kJ/mol or so. Oh wait, but that's for a strong acid and strong base. So maybe I need to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- here and see which is the limiting reactant.

First, let's figure out the moles of each acid and base. Starting with HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. So moles HCl = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

Next, H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+. The solution is 0.3 M, volume 0.3 L. Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, Ba(OH)2 is a base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. Because Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH-. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, wait. So total H+ from acids is 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 moles H+. OH- is 0.2 moles.

So when they react, H+ + OH- → H2O. The limiting reactant here would be OH- because there's less of it. What's the stoichiometry? 1:1, so H+ and OH- react in 1:1 ratio.

So moles of H+ reacting = 0.2 moles. Remaining H+ = 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles. But wait, wait, because H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions. So if the first H+ from H2SO4 is neutralized, would the second be available?

Wait, no. Because H2SO4 is a strong acid; both H+ ions dissociate. So both are available for reaction. So when we mix H+ and OH-, the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4.

So, total H+ available is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28. And OH- is 0.2.

So OH- is the limiting reagent. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, using up 0.2 moles of H+.

After reaction:

H+ remaining: 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

But wait, the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization. So the reaction is the acid-base neutralization, which is exothermic. The amount of heat released depends on the moles of H+ and OH- that react.

Wait, but wait a second. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so if only one of the H+ is reacting, but the other is still available. Hmm, but in a neutralization reaction, would the second H+ from H2SO4 also react if there's excess H+?

Wait, no, because the OH- is the limiting reactant. So all the OH- will react with H+ from the acids. So the heat released is based on the moles of H+ and OH- that actually react.

So the reaction is: H+ (from all acids) + OH- → H2O.

The moles of H+ available are 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and 0.2 moles of H+ will be consumed.

So the amount of H+ and OH- reacting is 0.2 each. So the moles of water formed is 0.2.

But wait, the enthalpy per mole of H+ reacting is usually about -57 kJ, right? So 0.2 moles would release 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. But wait, wait, the question gives options in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options.

Looking back, options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, wait, 57 kJ per mole is approximately 13.64 kcal (since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ). Wait, no, wait 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal. So 57 kJ is about 57 * 0.239 ≈ 13.64 kcal per mole.

So if 0.2 moles react, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. Or in kcal, it's 0.2 *13.64= 2.728 kcal. But wait, because the neutralization is exothermic, the enthalpy change is negative. So it's -11.4 kJ or -2.728 kcal.

Wait, but look at the options. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, that's a lot higher than 2.7. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the total H+ and OH- and see which is the limiting reagent.

Wait, another thought: maybe Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will provide 2 OH- per formula unit. So in 200 mL (0.2 L) of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2, moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles. So that's correct.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2.

So the H+ and OH- will react in 1:1. So 0.2 moles of OH- will react, consuming 0.2 moles of H+, leaving 0.08 moles of H+.

So the neutralization reaction is between 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-.

So the amount of heat released is 0.2 moles * (ΔH per mole). The ΔH for neutralization is typically about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH- since it's 1:1).

So 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. So that's 11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 kJ. But wait, looking at the options: option D is -16.0 kJ, which isn't close. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kJ. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (since 1 kcal ≈4.184 kJ, so 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). So 11.4 kJ is 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change would be -2.72 kcal, right? Because 0.2 moles times 57 kJ/mol is 11.4 kJ, which is about 2.72 kcal.

Wait, but the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, that's a bit confusing. So if the correct answer is -2.72 kcal, that's option A. But wait, option D is -16 kJ, which is way off.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the actual neutralization involves the reaction beyond just H+ and OH-? Let me think. Another approach: perhaps the neutralization is considering the reaction of H2SO4 with Ba(OH)2.

Wait, because maybe when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, the reaction may produce more than just H2O. Let me write the reaction equation.

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, because each H2SO4 provides 2 H+, and Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- per formula. So the reaction would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 (s) + 2 H2O.

In this reaction, two moles of H+ from H2SO4 react with two moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2. So each mole of H2SO4 neutralizes two moles of Ba(OH)2.

But wait, in the problem, we have excess HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So perhaps the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would take priority because they're in a 1:1 molar ratio for the acid and base, considering the H+ and OH-.

Wait, let's calculate the moles again.

HCl: 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 moles, which gives 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles, which gives 0.2 moles OH-.

Now, let's see the possible reactions.

First, the H+ from HCl, H2SO4, and OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But if H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, perhaps that's a separate reaction. Let me think about the total ions.

Wait, another approach: the total H+ from all acids is 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

The total OH- is 0.2 moles.

So when you mix them, the H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio to form water.

So 0.2 moles of H+ will react with 0.2 moles OH- to form 0.2 moles H2O, releasing heat.

So the heat released is 0.2 * 57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ. But wait, the options have B as -11.42 kcal, which is about the same as 11.4 kJ converted to kcal.

Wait, how do I convert kJ to kcal? 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So 11.4 kJ / 4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the heat released would be 2.72 kcal, so the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. So that's the answer.

Wait, but why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be if the reaction used 0.28 moles of H+ (the total H+ available), but that's not possible because OH- is only 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent, so only 0.2 moles of H+ react.

So the heat is 0.2 *57 kJ = 11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal. So the answer is A) -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but another thought: wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So, when it reacts with a base, the neutralization could involve both H+ ions. So perhaps the calculation should consider that the moles of H+ from H2SO4 are 0.18, but when Ba(OH)2 is added, each mole of base can take two moles of H+. So perhaps the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is separate.

Let me think: the moles of H2SO4 is 0.09, which can provide 0.18 H+.

Moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.1, which provides 0.2 OH-.

So the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2, producing two moles of water.

So, in this reaction, 0.09 moles H2SO4 and 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2.

The limiting reagent here is H2SO4, as only 0.09 moles are present, while Ba(OH)2 is 0.1. So all H2SO4 will react, consuming 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2. What's left? Ba(OH)2: 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles. Which gives 0.02 moles OH-.

HCl, on the other hand, is 0.1 moles H+.

So, after the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reaction:

H+ from HCl: 0.1.

OH- from remaining Ba(OH)2: 0.02.

So now, these will neutralize each other. H+ + OH- → H2O.

0.02 moles OH- will react with 0.02 moles H+ from HCl, leaving 0.08 moles H+.

So the total neutralization reactions are:

1. H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O. This uses 0.09 moles H2SO4 and 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, producing 2 *0.09 =0.18 moles H2O. But wait, the enthalpy for this reaction is not the same as the simple H+ + OH- reaction. Because each mole of H2SO4 reacting with Ba(OH)2 releases more heat.

Wait, this complicates things. Because the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 with a base may not be the same as for a strong acid and base. So perhaps I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, maybe all the H+ and OH- ions, regardless of the source, will neutralize each other. So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. Limiting reagent is OH-, so 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH- react, releasing 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal.

But wait, the initial approach thought that H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2 first, but perhaps that's not the case. Because when you mix all three solutions, the ions will all be in the same solution and will react regardless of their original source.

So, the correct approach is to calculate the total H+ and OH- and see the limiting reagent. So, the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, releasing 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal. So the answer is A) -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but why is option B there? Oh, maybe because some people might think the enthalpy is per mole of H2O, which is per mole of H+ and OH- reacting. So 0.2 moles H2O, each giving off 57 kJ. So 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ, which would be 2.72 kcal. So the answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the enthalpy per mole of reaction, so the total is -11.4 kJ, which is option D. Wait, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the moles. Let me double-check.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 moles. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles. Correct.

Total H+ = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- = 0.2 moles. So OH- is limiting.

So 0.2 moles H+ and OH- react, releasing 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ. But none of the options directly match that. Wait, the options: option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately 11.4 kJ converted to kcal. Let me see: 11.4 kJ = 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So that's option A.

Wait, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is given per mole of H2SO4 reacting, but I think that complicates things more.

Another angle: perhaps the problem is considering that each mole of H2SO4 releases 2 equivalents of H+, so the neutralization would be 2 * (-57 kJ) per mole of H2SO4. But that's not the case here because the limiting reagent is OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the total moles of H+ is 0.28 and OH- is 0.2. So when the OH- is used up, the excess H+ remains. So the reaction is 0.2 moles H+ and OH- reacting. So the enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ. That's -11,400 J, which is -11.4 kJ.

Looking back at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 11.4 kJ (since 11.4 * 4.184 ≈ 47.7 kJ, which is not correct). Wait no, wait, I think I messed up the conversion.

Wait, 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ. So 11.4 kJ is 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal. So that's correct.

Wait, but the initial approach was that the neutralization releases 0.2 *57 =11.4 kJ. So why is option D -16.0 kJ an option? That's way off.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should consider that the H2SO4 is diprotic, so when it reacts with the base, more H+ is neutralized. But let me think again.

Wait, another approach: calculate the molarity of H+ and OH- after mixing.

Wait, when you mix the solutions, the total volume is 500 + 300 + 200 = 1000 mL = 1 L.

Total H+ = 0.28 moles in 1 L → 0.28 M.

Total OH- = 0.2 moles in 1 L → 0.2 M.

So the reaction H+ + OH- → H2O will proceed until one is exhausted. OH- is the limiting reagent.

So moles of H+ consumed: 0.2.

Enthalpy change: 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So the answer in kJ is -11.4 kJ, which would be option D if it were -11.4 kJ, but option D is -16.0 kJ, so that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the enthalpy per mole of H+ is different. Or perhaps the question is considering the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, which could have a different enthalpy.

Wait, another thought. Let me write the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4(s) + 2 H2O.

Each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce two moles of H2O. The enthalpy change for this reaction is more than just 2 * (-57) kJ because it's a specific reaction.

But wait, I don't remember the exact enthalpy for this reaction. Maybe it's more exothermic. For example, if the enthalpy is -200 kJ per mole of H2SO4, but I'm not sure. Without knowing the exact value, it's hard to proceed. But in the absence of specific data, perhaps the problem expects us to use the standard enthalpy of neutralization.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider that each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+ and each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-.

So, for the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2:

The stoichiometry is 1 H2SO4 : 1 Ba(OH)2 → 1 BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Each mole of H2SO4 would release 2 *57 = 114 kJ (since two H+ are neutralized). But wait, that would be the case if each H+ from H2SO4 reacts with OH-.

But in reality, the reaction involves both H+ from H2SO4 reacting with OH- from Ba(OH)2 in a 2:2 ratio, which is 1:1.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy for this specific reaction is known. For example, the enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid (H2SO4) with a strong base (Ba(OH)2) is about -200 kJ/mol of reaction (per mole of H2SO4), because each mole produces two moles of water. So per mole of H2SO4, it's 2 ×57 =114 kJ, but wait, no, because it's per mole of reaction, which produces two moles of water, so that's 2 ×57 =114 kJ per mole of H2SO4.

Wait, but in the problem, we have 0.09 moles of H2SO4 reacting with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. So the enthalpy change would be 0.09 ×114 kJ =10.26 kJ.

Then, the remaining H+ from HCl and Ba(OH)2 would be 0.1 (HCl) and 0.01 ×2=0.02 (since 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 total, 0.09 reacted, leaving 0.01, which gives 0.02 OH-).

So the remaining OH- is 0.02, which reacts with 0.02 moles of H+ from HCl, releasing 0.02 ×57 =1.14 kJ.

So total enthalpy change would be 10.26 + 1.14 =11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal. So the answer is A) -2.72 kcal.

Wait, that's the same result as before. So regardless of the approach, the answer is A.

But why is option B there? Oh, because if someone thought that all 0.28 moles of H+ react, they'd calculate 0.28 ×57=15.96 kJ, which is about 16 kJ, matching option D. But that's incorrect because OH- is the limiting reagent.

So the correct approach is to find the limiting reagent, which is OH-, so only 0.2 moles react, leading to 11.4 kJ or 2.72 kcal.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂, the following steps are taken:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since HCl dissociates completely, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - **H₂SO₄ (strong acid, diprotic):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ dissociates into 2 moles of H⁺, so it contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 moles of OH⁻, so it contributes \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

2. **Identify the limiting reactant:**
   - Total \( \text{H⁺} \) available = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - Total \( \text{OH⁻} \) available = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - The reaction \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \) proceeds in a 1:1 molar ratio.  
   - Since \( \text{OH⁻} \) is present in fewer moles (\( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \)), it is the limiting reactant.

3. **Calculate the heat released:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \) is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   - Moles of \( \text{H⁺} \) and \( \text{OH⁻} \) that react = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - Heat released = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).  
   - Convert \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \) to kcal:  
     \( 1 \, \text{kJ} \approx 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \), so \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

4. **Evaluate the options:**
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value.  
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value in kcal.  
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.  
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value in kJ.

Thus, the correct answer is **A) -2.72 kcal**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says we're mixing three solutions: 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2. And we need to find the enthalpy change, right?

Wait, wait. I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually about the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The typical reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, and the enthalpy change is around -57 kJ/mol or so. Oh wait, but that's for a strong acid and strong base. So maybe I need to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- here and see which is the limiting reactant.

First, let's figure out the moles of each acid and base. Starting with HCl. HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Each mole of HCl gives one mole of H+. So moles HCl = Molarity * Volume (in liters). So 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. So 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 moles H+.

Next, H2SO4. Sulfuric acid is a strong acid too, but it's diprotic. So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+. The solution is 0.3 M, volume 0.3 L. Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, Ba(OH)2 is a base. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH-. Because Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH-. So moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, wait. So total H+ from acids is 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 moles H+. OH- is 0.2 moles.

So when they react, H+ + OH- → H2O. The limiting reactant here would be OH- because there's less of it. What's the stoichiometry? 1:1, so H+ and OH- react in 1:1 ratio.

So moles of H+ reacting = 0.2 moles. Remaining H+ = 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles. But wait, wait, because H2SO4 can donate two H+ ions. So if the first H+ from H2SO4 is neutralized, would the second be available?

Wait, no. Because H2SO4 is a strong acid; both H+ ions dissociate. So both are available for reaction. So when we mix H+ and OH-, the H+ comes from both HCl and H2SO4.

So, total H+ available is 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28. And OH- is 0.2.

So OH- is the limiting reagent. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, using up 0.2 moles of H+.

After reaction:

H+ remaining: 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 moles.

But wait, the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization. So the reaction is the acid-base neutralization, which is exothermic. The amount of heat released depends on the moles of H+ and OH- that react.

Wait, but wait a second. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so if only one of the H+ is reacting, but the other is still available. Hmm, but in a neutralization reaction, would the second H+ from H2SO4 also react if there's excess H+?

Wait, no, because the OH- is the limiting reactant. So all the OH- will react with H+ from the acids. So the heat released is based on the moles of H+ and OH- that actually react.

So the reaction is: H+ (from all acids) + OH- → H2O.

The moles of H+ available are 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, and 0.2 moles of H+ will be consumed.

So the amount of H+ and OH- reacting is 0.2 each. So the moles of water formed is 0.2.

But wait, the enthalpy per mole of H+ reacting is usually about -57 kJ, right? So 0.2 moles would release 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. But wait, wait, the question gives options in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options.

Looking back, options are A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

Wait, wait, 57 kJ per mole is approximately 13.64 kcal (since 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ). Wait, no, wait 1 kJ is about 0.239 kcal. So 57 kJ is about 57 * 0.239 ≈ 13.64 kcal per mole.

So if 0.2 moles react, the enthalpy change would be 0.2 * 57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. Or in kcal, it's 0.2 *13.64= 2.728 kcal. But wait, because the neutralization is exothermic, the enthalpy change is negative. So it's -11.4 kJ or -2.728 kcal.

Wait, but look at the options. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, that's a lot higher than 2.7. Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I need to calculate the total H+ and OH- and see which is the limiting reagent.

Wait, another thought: maybe Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, so it will provide 2 OH- per formula unit. So in 200 mL (0.2 L) of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2, moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles. So that's correct.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles HCl → 0.1 H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles H2SO4. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 moles H+.

Total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2.

So the H+ and OH- will react in 1:1. So 0.2 moles of OH- will react, consuming 0.2 moles of H+, leaving 0.08 moles of H+.

So the neutralization reaction is between 0.2 moles of H+ and 0.2 moles of OH-.

So the amount of heat released is 0.2 moles * (ΔH per mole). The ΔH for neutralization is typically about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or per mole of OH- since it's 1:1).

So 0.2 * 57 = 11.4 kJ. So that's 11.4 kJ, which is -11.4 kJ. But wait, looking at the options: option D is -16.0 kJ, which isn't close. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 11.4 * 0.239 ≈ 2.72 kJ. Wait, no, wait, no. Wait, 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (since 1 kcal ≈4.184 kJ, so 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). So 11.4 kJ is 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change would be -2.72 kcal, right? Because 0.2 moles times 57 kJ/mol is 11.4 kJ, which is about 2.72 kcal.

Wait, but the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, that's a bit confusing. So if the correct answer is -2.72 kcal, that's option A. But wait, option D is -16 kJ, which is way off.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the actual neutralization involves the reaction beyond just H+ and OH-? Let me think. Another approach: perhaps the neutralization is considering the reaction of H2SO4 with Ba(OH)2.

Wait, because maybe when H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, the reaction may produce more than just H2O. Let me write the reaction equation.

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, because each H2SO4 provides 2 H+, and Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH- per formula. So the reaction would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 (s) + 2 H2O.

In this reaction, two moles of H+ from H2SO4 react with two moles of OH- from Ba(OH)2. So each mole of H2SO4 neutralizes two moles of Ba(OH)2.

But wait, in the problem, we have excess HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So perhaps the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would take priority because they're in a 1:1 molar ratio for the acid and base, considering the H+ and OH-.

Wait, let's calculate the moles again.

HCl: 0.1 moles H+.

H2SO4: 0.09 moles, which gives 0.18 moles H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 moles, which gives 0.2 moles OH-.

Now, let's see the possible reactions.

First, the H+ from HCl, H2SO4, and OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But if H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2, perhaps that's a separate reaction. Let me think about the total ions.

Wait, another approach: the total H+ from all acids is 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 moles.

The total OH- is 0.2 moles.

So when you mix them, the H+ and OH- will react in a 1:1 ratio to form water.

So 0.2 moles of H+ will react with 0.2 moles OH- to form 0.2 moles H2O, releasing heat.

So the heat released is 0.2 * 57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ. But wait, the options have B as -11.42 kcal, which is about the same as 11.4 kJ converted to kcal.

Wait, how do I convert kJ to kcal? 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So 11.4 kJ / 4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the heat released would be 2.72 kcal, so the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. So that's the answer.

Wait, but why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be if the reaction used 0.28 moles of H+ (the total H+ available), but that's not possible because OH- is only 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent, so only 0.2 moles of H+ react.

So the heat is 0.2 *57 kJ = 11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal. So the answer is A) -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but another thought: wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. So, when it reacts with a base, the neutralization could involve both H+ ions. So perhaps the calculation should consider that the moles of H+ from H2SO4 are 0.18, but when Ba(OH)2 is added, each mole of base can take two moles of H+. So perhaps the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is separate.

Let me think: the moles of H2SO4 is 0.09, which can provide 0.18 H+.

Moles of Ba(OH)2 is 0.1, which provides 0.2 OH-.

So the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 would be:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2, producing two moles of water.

So, in this reaction, 0.09 moles H2SO4 and 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2.

The limiting reagent here is H2SO4, as only 0.09 moles are present, while Ba(OH)2 is 0.1. So all H2SO4 will react, consuming 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2. What's left? Ba(OH)2: 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 moles. Which gives 0.02 moles OH-.

HCl, on the other hand, is 0.1 moles H+.

So, after the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reaction:

H+ from HCl: 0.1.

OH- from remaining Ba(OH)2: 0.02.

So now, these will neutralize each other. H+ + OH- → H2O.

0.02 moles OH- will react with 0.02 moles H+ from HCl, leaving 0.08 moles H+.

So the total neutralization reactions are:

1. H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O. This uses 0.09 moles H2SO4 and 0.09 moles Ba(OH)2, producing 2 *0.09 =0.18 moles H2O. But wait, the enthalpy for this reaction is not the same as the simple H+ + OH- reaction. Because each mole of H2SO4 reacting with Ba(OH)2 releases more heat.

Wait, this complicates things. Because the enthalpy of neutralization for H2SO4 with a base may not be the same as for a strong acid and base. So perhaps I should approach this differently.

Alternatively, maybe all the H+ and OH- ions, regardless of the source, will neutralize each other. So the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. Limiting reagent is OH-, so 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH- react, releasing 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal.

But wait, the initial approach thought that H2SO4 reacts with Ba(OH)2 first, but perhaps that's not the case. Because when you mix all three solutions, the ions will all be in the same solution and will react regardless of their original source.

So, the correct approach is to calculate the total H+ and OH- and see the limiting reagent. So, the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, releasing 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal. So the answer is A) -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but why is option B there? Oh, maybe because some people might think the enthalpy is per mole of H2O, which is per mole of H+ and OH- reacting. So 0.2 moles H2O, each giving off 57 kJ. So 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ, which would be 2.72 kcal. So the answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the enthalpy per mole of reaction, so the total is -11.4 kJ, which is option D. Wait, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the moles. Let me double-check.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each gives 2 H+, so 0.18 moles. Correct.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 moles. Correct.

Total H+ = 0.28 moles.

Total OH- = 0.2 moles. So OH- is limiting.

So 0.2 moles H+ and OH- react, releasing 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ.

So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ. But none of the options directly match that. Wait, the options: option B is -11.42 kcal, which is approximately 11.4 kJ converted to kcal. Let me see: 11.4 kJ = 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So that's option A.

Wait, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is given per mole of H2SO4 reacting, but I think that complicates things more.

Another angle: perhaps the problem is considering that each mole of H2SO4 releases 2 equivalents of H+, so the neutralization would be 2 * (-57 kJ) per mole of H2SO4. But that's not the case here because the limiting reagent is OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps the total moles of H+ is 0.28 and OH- is 0.2. So when the OH- is used up, the excess H+ remains. So the reaction is 0.2 moles H+ and OH- reacting. So the enthalpy is 0.2 * (-57) kJ = -11.4 kJ. That's -11,400 J, which is -11.4 kJ.

Looking back at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 11.4 kJ (since 11.4 * 4.184 ≈ 47.7 kJ, which is not correct). Wait no, wait, I think I messed up the conversion.

Wait, 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ. So 11.4 kJ is 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So option A is -2.72 kcal. So that's correct.

Wait, but the initial approach was that the neutralization releases 0.2 *57 =11.4 kJ. So why is option D -16.0 kJ an option? That's way off.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should consider that the H2SO4 is diprotic, so when it reacts with the base, more H+ is neutralized. But let me think again.

Wait, another approach: calculate the molarity of H+ and OH- after mixing.

Wait, when you mix the solutions, the total volume is 500 + 300 + 200 = 1000 mL = 1 L.

Total H+ = 0.28 moles in 1 L → 0.28 M.

Total OH- = 0.2 moles in 1 L → 0.2 M.

So the reaction H+ + OH- → H2O will proceed until one is exhausted. OH- is the limiting reagent.

So moles of H+ consumed: 0.2.

Enthalpy change: 0.2 * (-57) = -11.4 kJ.

So the answer in kJ is -11.4 kJ, which would be option D if it were -11.4 kJ, but option D is -16.0 kJ, so that doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the enthalpy per mole of H+ is different. Or perhaps the question is considering the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, which could have a different enthalpy.

Wait, another thought. Let me write the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2.

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4(s) + 2 H2O.

Each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce two moles of H2O. The enthalpy change for this reaction is more than just 2 * (-57) kJ because it's a specific reaction.

But wait, I don't remember the exact enthalpy for this reaction. Maybe it's more exothermic. For example, if the enthalpy is -200 kJ per mole of H2SO4, but I'm not sure. Without knowing the exact value, it's hard to proceed. But in the absence of specific data, perhaps the problem expects us to use the standard enthalpy of neutralization.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to consider that each mole of H2SO4 provides 2 H+ and each mole of Ba(OH)2 provides 2 OH-.

So, for the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2:

The stoichiometry is 1 H2SO4 : 1 Ba(OH)2 → 1 BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Each mole of H2SO4 would release 2 *57 = 114 kJ (since two H+ are neutralized). But wait, that would be the case if each H+ from H2SO4 reacts with OH-.

But in reality, the reaction involves both H+ from H2SO4 reacting with OH- from Ba(OH)2 in a 2:2 ratio, which is 1:1.

Wait, perhaps the enthalpy for this specific reaction is known. For example, the enthalpy of neutralization for a strong acid (H2SO4) with a strong base (Ba(OH)2) is about -200 kJ/mol of reaction (per mole of H2SO4), because each mole produces two moles of water. So per mole of H2SO4, it's 2 ×57 =114 kJ, but wait, no, because it's per mole of reaction, which produces two moles of water, so that's 2 ×57 =114 kJ per mole of H2SO4.

Wait, but in the problem, we have 0.09 moles of H2SO4 reacting with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2. So the enthalpy change would be 0.09 ×114 kJ =10.26 kJ.

Then, the remaining H+ from HCl and Ba(OH)2 would be 0.1 (HCl) and 0.01 ×2=0.02 (since 0.1 moles Ba(OH)2 total, 0.09 reacted, leaving 0.01, which gives 0.02 OH-).

So the remaining OH- is 0.02, which reacts with 0.02 moles of H+ from HCl, releasing 0.02 ×57 =1.14 kJ.

So total enthalpy change would be 10.26 + 1.14 =11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal. So the answer is A) -2.72 kcal.

Wait, that's the same result as before. So regardless of the approach, the answer is A.

But why is option B there? Oh, because if someone thought that all 0.28 moles of H+ react, they'd calculate 0.28 ×57=15.96 kJ, which is about 16 kJ, matching option D. But that's incorrect because OH- is the limiting reagent.

So the correct approach is to find the limiting reagent, which is OH-, so only 0.2 moles react, leading to 11.4 kJ or 2.72 kcal.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when mixing 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂, the following steps are taken:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions:**
   - **HCl (strong acid):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since HCl dissociates completely, it contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - **H₂SO₄ (strong acid, diprotic):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of H₂SO₄ dissociates into 2 moles of H⁺, so it contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 moles of OH⁻, so it contributes \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles of OH⁻} \).

2. **Identify the limiting reactant:**
   - Total \( \text{H⁺} \) available = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - Total \( \text{OH⁻} \) available = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - The reaction \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \) proceeds in a 1:1 molar ratio.  
   - Since \( \text{OH⁻} \) is present in fewer moles (\( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \)), it is the limiting reactant.

3. **Calculate the heat released:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization for \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \) is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \).  
   - Moles of \( \text{H⁺} \) and \( \text{OH⁻} \) that react = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - Heat released = \( 0.2 \, \text{moles} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \).  
   - Convert \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \) to kcal:  
     \( 1 \, \text{kJ} \approx 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \), so \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \).

4. **Evaluate the options:**
   - **Option A (-2.72 kcal):** Matches the calculated value.  
   - **Option B (-11.42 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value in kcal.  
   - **Option C (-3.80 kcal):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value.  
   - **Option D (-16.0 kJ):** Incorrect, as it does not match the calculated value in kJ.

Thus, the correct answer is **A) -2.72 kcal**.

Answer: A
