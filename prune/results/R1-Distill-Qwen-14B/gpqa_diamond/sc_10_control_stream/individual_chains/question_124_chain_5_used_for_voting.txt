Okay, I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's take it slow because I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I think I can work through this.

So, the problem is about particles being collided in a detector. The setup is that when particles are collided, new particles are produced which travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls?

Hmm. I remember that the Lorentz factor, gamma, is given by gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)). But more importantly, in this context, the particles are moving at a certain speed, and their lifetime is affected by time dilation. Oh wait, right! Because these particles are moving at relativistic speeds, their lifetime as seen from the lab frame (the detector's frame) is longer than their proper lifetime (the lifetime in their rest frame). This affects how far they can travel before decaying.

So, the key concept here is time dilation and how it affects the particles' ability to reach the detector walls. The idea is that particles moving faster (higher gamma) will have a longer lifetime, allowing them to travel further. The distance they can travel is limited by both their speed and their lifetime before decay.

Wait, the problem says that one third reach the detector when gamma is 20. Now, we need to find a higher gamma so that two-thirds reach. Wait, wait, that doesn't sound right. Because if gamma increases, the lifetime increases, so the particles can travel farther. So if at gamma 20, 1/3 reach, then at a higher gamma, more should reach. Wait, but the problem wants to reach two-thirds, so that's more than 1/3. So, we need a higher gamma than 20. Because when gamma is higher, the particles live longer and can reach further.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The problem says that when gamma is 20, on average, one third reach the inner walls. Now, they want to find a gamma where two-thirds reach. So, higher gamma, more particles reach the walls.

Wait, so the radius of the detector is 30 meters. So, the distance the particles can travel is 30 meters. The time they have to reach is the proper lifetime multiplied by gamma. Hmm.

Let me outline the formula. The distance a particle can travel is given by:

distance = v * t_lab,

where t_lab is the lifetime measured in the lab frame. The proper lifetime is t_0, so t_lab = gamma * t_0.

But v is the velocity of the particle, which is approximately c for ultra-relativistic particles. So, v ≈ c. So, distance ≈ c * gamma * t_0.

But wait, another approach: the maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying is when the product of its velocity and lifetime allows it just to reach the detector's radius. So, the fraction reaching the walls depends on whether their lifetime (as seen in the lab) multiplied by their velocity is at least the radius of the detector.

Wait, but how does the fraction relate to gamma?

Ah, perhaps the fraction of particles that reach the detector depends on the ratio of the observed lifetime to the time it takes for them to reach the wall. But wait, no, I think it's more about the decay process being a Poisson process. The probability that a particle decays after traveling a certain distance is related to the mean lifetime.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall compared to its lifetime. If the particle's lifetime is longer than the time it takes to reach the wall, then a higher fraction should reach. If the lifetime is too short, they decay before reaching.

So, for the particle to reach the detector wall, the time it takes to travel 30 meters should be less than or equal to the particle's lifetime in the lab frame (t_lab = gamma * t_0).

Wait, the time to reach the wall is t = distance / velocity. Since the velocity is v ≈ c, t ≈ 30 m / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds, approximately.

Wait, but gamma is about 20, so t_lab = gamma * t_0. Wait, but I don't know t_0. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, another way. The number of particles reaching the detector is proportional to the probability that they decay after traveling a certain distance. But for a given gamma, the probability that a particle lives long enough to reach the wall is based on their lifetime.

Wait, but the problem states that at gamma ~20, one third reach. So, for this, the probability that a particle doesn't decay before traveling 30 meters is 1/3.

Wait, assuming that the decay follows an exponential decay process, the probability that a particle survives (doesn't decay) for a time t is P = exp(-t/(tau)), where tau is the mean lifetime. So, tau is gamma * t_0, where t_0 is the proper lifetime.

But the time t is the time it takes the particle to reach the wall, which is t = 30 m / c ≈ 1e-7 seconds.

Wait, so the probability of the particle surviving is exp(-t/(gamma * t_0)).

Wait, but for the given gamma (20), this probability is 1/3. So, for gamma=20:

P = exp( - (1e-7 s) / (20 * t_0) ) = 1/3.

Taking natural log on both sides:

- (1e-7) / (20 t_0) ) = ln(1/3) ≈ -1.0986

So,

1e-7 / (20 t_0 ) = 1.0986

=> 20 t_0 = 1e-7 / 1.0986 ≈ 9.1e-8 seconds.

So,

t_0 = (9.1e-8) / 20 ≈ 4.55e-9 seconds.

Okay, so now, when the Lorentz factor is gamma', we want the probability to be 2/3.

So,

P = exp( - t / (gamma' t_0) ) = 2/3.

Taking ln:

- t/(gamma' t_0) ) = ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055

So,

t/(gamma' t_0) ) = 0.4055.

We know t is 1e-7 s, and t_0 is 4.55e-9 s.

So,

gamma' = t / (t_0 * 0.4055 ) = (1e-7) / (4.55e-9 * 0.4055 )

Let me compute that.

First, compute denominator: 4.55e-9 * 0.4055 ≈ 4.55e-9 * 0.4 ≈ 1.82e-9.

So,

gamma' = 1e-7 / 1.82e-9 ≈ (1e-7) / (1.82e-9) ) = (1 / 1.82) * 1e2 ≈ 0.549 * 100 ≈ 54.9.

Hmm, so approximately 55. Looking at the options, option A is 54, option B is 68, C is 40, D is 28.

So, the closest is A)54.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, more accurately:

t_0 = 4.55e-9 s.

So, denominator: 4.55e-9 * 0.4055 = 4.55 * 0.4055 = let's compute 4.55 * 0.4=1.82, 4.55*0.0055=0.025025. So total 1.845025e-9.

So,

gamma' = 1e-7 / (1.845025e-9) = (1e-7)/(1.845025e-9) = (1e2) / 1.845025 ≈ 100 / 1.845 ≈ 54.17.

So, about 54.17. So, the closest option is A)54.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the ratio of the probabilities.

At gamma1=20, P1=1/3.

At gamma2=?, P2=2/3.

We can relate gamma2 to gamma1 by considering the probability.

The probability P is exp( - t/(gamma t0) ), so:

ln(P) = -t/(gamma t0).

So,

ln(P1) = -t/(gamma1 t0).

ln(P2) = -t/(gamma2 t0).

Dividing the two equations:

ln(P1)/ln(P2) = gamma2 / gamma1.

So,

gamma2 = gamma1 * ln(P1)/ln(P2)

Wait, wait, let's compute ln(P1)=ln(1/3)= -1.0986

ln(P2)=ln(2/3)= -0.4055.

So,

gamma2 = 20 * ( -1.0986 / -0.4055 )

Compute 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.708.

So,

gamma2 = 20 * 2.708 ≈ 54.16.

Same as before. So, 54.16, so option A)54 is the answer.

So, the correct option is A)54.

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor, the particles' lifetimes, and their ability to travel the detector's radius of 30 meters.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Lorentz Factor and Time Dilation**: The Lorentz factor, \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), determines the time dilation effect. The lifetime of a particle in the lab frame is \( t_{\text{lab}} = \gamma \cdot t_0 \), where \( t_0 \) is the proper lifetime.
2. **Distance and Decay Probability**: The probability of a particle reaching the detector walls depends on whether its lifetime (dilated by \( \gamma \)) is sufficient to travel the 30 meters. The survival probability is given by:
   \[
   P = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma t_0}\right),
   \]
   where \( t = \frac{\text{distance}}{v} \approx \frac{30}{c} \approx 1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s} \) for ultra-relativistic particles.

### Analysis:
- At \( \gamma = 20 \), one-third of the particles reach the walls, so \( P = \frac{1}{3} \). Using the survival probability formula:
  \[
  \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma t_0}.
  \]
  Substituting \( \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \approx -1.0986 \), we solve for \( t_0 \):
  \[
  t_0 = \frac{t}{\gamma \cdot 1.0986} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{20 \cdot 1.0986} \approx 4.55 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}.
  \]

- For two-thirds of the particles to reach the walls (\( P = \frac{2}{3} \)), we use the same formula:
  \[
  \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma' t_0}.
  \]
  Substituting \( \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \approx -0.4055 \), we solve for \( \gamma' \):
  \[
  \gamma' = \frac{t}{t_0 \cdot 0.4055}.
  \]
  Substituting \( t = 1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s} \) and \( t_0 = 4.55 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \gamma' = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{4.55 \times 10^{-9} \cdot 0.4055} \approx 54.17.
  \]

### Conclusion:
The Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls is approximately \( \gamma' = 54 \). Among the given options, the closest value is **A) 54**.

Because if gamma increases, the lifetime increases, so the particles can travel farther. So if at gamma 20, 1/3 reach, then at a higher gamma, more should reach. Wait, but the problem wants to reach two-thirds, so that's more than 1/3. So, we need a higher gamma than 20. Because when gamma is higher, the particles live longer and can reach further.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The problem says that when gamma is 20, on average, one third reach the inner walls. Now, they want to find a gamma where two-thirds reach. So, higher gamma, more particles reach the walls.

Wait, so the radius of the detector is 30 meters. So, the distance the particles can travel is 30 meters. The time they have to reach is the proper lifetime multiplied by gamma. Hmm.

distance = v * t_lab,

where t_lab is the lifetime measured in the lab frame. The proper lifetime is t_0, so t_lab = gamma * t_0.

But v is the velocity of the particle, which is approximately c for ultra-relativistic particles. So, v ≈ c. So, distance ≈ c * gamma * t_0.

But wait, another approach: the maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying is when the product of its velocity and lifetime allows it just to reach the detector's radius. So, the fraction reaching the walls depends on whether their lifetime (as seen in the lab) multiplied by their velocity is at least the radius of the detector.

Wait, the time to reach the wall is t = distance / velocity. Since the velocity is v ≈ c, t ≈ 30 m / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds, approximately.

Wait, but gamma is about 20, so t_lab = gamma * t_0. Wait, but I don't know t_0. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, another way. The number of particles reaching the detector is proportional to the probability that they decay after traveling a certain distance. But for a given gamma, the probability that a particle lives long enough to reach the wall is based on their lifetime.

Wait, assuming that the decay follows an exponential decay process, the probability that a particle survives (doesn't decay) for a time t is P = exp(-t/(tau)), where tau is the mean lifetime. So, tau is gamma * t_0, where t_0 is the proper lifetime.

But the time t is the time it takes the particle to reach the wall, which is t = 30 m / c ≈ 1e-7 seconds.

Wait, so the probability of the particle surviving is exp(-t/(gamma * t_0)).

Wait, but for the given gamma (20), this probability is 1/3. So, for gamma=20:

P = exp( - (1e-7 s) / (20 * t_0) ) = 1/3.

Taking natural log on both sides:

- (1e-7) / (20 t_0) ) = ln(1/3) ≈ -1.0986

So,

1e-7 / (20 t_0 ) = 1.0986

=> 20 t_0 = 1e-7 / 1.0986 ≈ 9.1e-8 seconds.

So,

t_0 = (9.1e-8) / 20 ≈ 4.55e-9 seconds.

Okay, so now, when the Lorentz factor is gamma', we want the probability to be 2/3.

So,

P = exp( - t / (gamma' t_0) ) = 2/3.

Taking ln:

- t/(gamma' t_0) ) = ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055

So,

t/(gamma' t_0) ) = 0.4055.

We know t is 1e-7 s, and t_0 is 4.55e-9 s.

So,

gamma' = t / (t_0 * 0.4055 ) = (1e-7) / (4.55e-9 * 0.4055 )

Let me compute that.

First, compute denominator: 4.55e-9 * 0.4055 ≈ 4.55e-9 * 0.4 ≈ 1.82e-9.

So,

gamma' = 1e-7 / 1.82e-9 ≈ (1e-7) / (1.82e-9) ) = (1 / 1.82) * 1e2 ≈ 0.549 * 100 ≈ 54.9.

Hmm, so approximately 55. Looking at the options, option A is 54, option B is 68, C is 40, D is 28.

So, the closest is A)54.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, more accurately:

t_0 = 4.55e-9 s.

So, denominator: 4.55e-9 * 0.4055 = 4.55 * 0.4055 = let's compute 4.55 * 0.4=1.82, 4.55*0.0055=0.025025. So total 1.845025e-9.

So,

gamma' = 1e-7 / (1.845025e-9) = (1e-7)/(1.845025e-9) = (1e2) / 1.845025 ≈ 100 / 1.845 ≈ 54.17.

So, about 54.17. So, the closest option is A)54.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the ratio of the probabilities.

At gamma1=20, P1=1/3.

At gamma2=?, P2=2/3.

We can relate gamma2 to gamma1 by considering the probability.

The probability P is exp( - t/(gamma t0) ), so:

ln(P) = -t/(gamma t0).

So,

ln(P1) = -t/(gamma1 t0).

ln(P2) = -t/(gamma2 t0).

Dividing the two equations:

ln(P1)/ln(P2) = gamma2 / gamma1.

So,

gamma2 = gamma1 * ln(P1)/ln(P2)

Wait, wait, let's compute ln(P1)=ln(1/3)= -1.0986

ln(P2)=ln(2/3)= -0.4055.

So,

gamma2 = 20 * ( -1.0986 / -0.4055 )

Compute 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.708.

So,

gamma2 = 20 * 2.708 ≈ 54.16.

Same as before. So, 54.16, so option A)54 is the answer.

So, the correct option is A)54.


To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor, the particles' lifetimes, and their ability to travel the detector's radius of 30 meters.

   \]
   where \( t = \frac{\text{distance}}{v} \approx \frac{30}{c} \approx 1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s} \) for ultra-relativistic particles.

### Analysis:
- At \( \gamma = 20 \), one-third of the particles reach the walls, so \( P = \frac{1}{3} \). Using the survival probability formula:
  \[
  \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma t_0}.
  \]
  Substituting \( \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \approx -1.0986 \), we solve for \( t_0 \):
  \[
  t_0 = \frac{t}{\gamma \cdot 1.0986} = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{20 \cdot 1.0986} \approx 4.55 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s}.
  \]

- For two-thirds of the particles to reach the walls (\( P = \frac{2}{3} \)), we use the same formula:
  \[
  \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma' t_0}.
  \]
  Substituting \( \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \approx -0.4055 \), we solve for \( \gamma' \):
  \[
  \gamma' = \frac{t}{t_0 \cdot 0.4055}.
  \]
  Substituting \( t = 1 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{s} \) and \( t_0 = 4.55 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{s} \):
  \[
  \gamma' = \frac{1 \times 10^{-7}}{4.55 \times 10^{-9} \cdot 0.4055} \approx 54.17.
  \]

### Conclusion:
The Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls is approximately \( \gamma' = 54 \). Among the given options, the closest value is **A) 54**.
