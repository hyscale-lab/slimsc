Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these pH calculations. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about determining the pH of a solution made by mixing three different solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH3COOH, 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl, and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂. Hmm, that's a mix of a weak acid, a strong acid, and a strong base. I think I remember that when you mix acids and bases, you have to consider the neutralization reactions.

Wait, right. Acids donate H+ ions and bases donate OH- ions. When they mix, H+ and OH- combine to form water. But since there are multiple acids and a base, I need to calculate the total H+ and OH- concentrations and see which one is in excess. The excess will determine whether the solution is acidic or basic.

Let me break it down step by step. First, I'll find the moles of each component in each solution. Then, I'll see how they react with each other.

Starting with CH3COOH. It's a weak acid, so it doesn't dissociate completely. But for the purpose of neutralization, I can consider the moles of H+ it can provide. The formula is the concentration multiplied by the volume in liters.

Moles of CH3COOH = 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Since it's a monoprotic acid, each mole gives one mole of H+. So, 0.05 moles of H+.

Next, HCl is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. Moles of HCl = 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles. Each HCl gives one H+, so 0.08 moles of H+.

Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base. It dissociates into Ba²+ and OH- ions. Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ gives two OH- ions. So, moles of Ba(OH)₂ = 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles. Each mole gives 2 OH-, so that's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles of OH-.

Now, the total H+ comes from CH3COOH and HCl: 0.05 + 0.08 = 0.13 moles of H+.

The OH- comes only from Ba(OH)₂: 0.18 moles.

I remember that H+ and OH- neutralize each other in a 1:1 ratio. So, when you have more H+ than OH-, the excess H+ will determine the pH. Conversely, if OH- is in excess, the excess OH- determines the pH.

In this case, comparing H+ (0.13) and OH- (0.18). OH- is more. So the solution will be basic, and the excess OH- is 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 moles.

But wait, the total volume of the solution is the sum of all the individual volumes. Let me calculate that: 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL, which is 1.2 liters.

So the concentration of excess OH- is moles divided by total volume: 0.05 moles / 1.2 L ≈ 0.041666 M.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I made a mistake here. Because when you mix a strong acid and a strong base, the neutralization is straightforward. But what about the weak acid?

Wait, when the strong base is added, it will neutralize the strong acid first, because HCl is a stronger acid than CH3COOH. Or wait, no. Strong acids and bases are completely ionized, so their H+ and OH- will react first. Let me think.

Wait, no. When you have multiple acids and a base, it's better to treat all H+ from acids and OH- from the base. But actually, the H+ from the weak acid (CH3COOH) doesn't dissociate completely, so its H+ is less than 0.05 moles. Hmm, wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. When considering neutralization, whether an acid is weak or strong, for the purpose of H+ and OH- neutralization, we need to consider the total H+ available. For strong acids, all H+ is available. For weak acids, only a fraction is ionized, but perhaps in this case, when mixed with a strong base, the weak acid's H+ will be considered as it can contribute.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The HCl is a strong acid, so it will fully donate its H+. The CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it's not fully ionized, but when mixed with a base, which is a strong base, the base will deprotonate the weak acid. So any H+ from CH3COOH will react with OH- from the base.

Hmm, so perhaps the neutralization proceeds as follows: the OH- from Ba(OH)₂ will first react with the H+ from the strong acids (HCl) and then with any H+ from the weak acid (CH3COOH).

Wait, but perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the total moles of H+ from all sources, the total moles of OH-, and then see which is in excess.

So, total H+ is from HCl and CH3COOH. HCl is 0.08 moles, CH3COOH is 0.05. But wait, CH3COOH, being a weak acid, doesn't fully dissociate. So under normal circumstances, without any base, it would contribute less than 0.05 moles H+. But when you add a base, the OH- will react with any H+ present. So, the H+ from CH3COOH is available, but perhaps not in the same way as the strong acid.

Wait, no. Maybe I should treat all the H+ from the acids (both strong and weak) as available for neutralization. So total H+ is 0.08 (HCl) + 0.05 (CH3COOH) = 0.13. Then, OH- is 0.18. So, when OH- is added, it neutralizes H+:

H+ + OH- → H2O

So 0.13 moles H+ will react with 0.13 moles OH-, leaving 0.05 moles OH-.

But wait, but some of the H+ comes from CH3COOH, which is a weak acid. But when you have excess OH-, the OH- will deprotonate the CH3COOH as well. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the way to approach this is to calculate the total equivalents of H+ and OH-.

H+ equivalents: HCl contributes 0.08 eq (since it's 1:1), CH3COOH contributes 0.05 eq (since each mole gives one H+), so total H+ eq is 0.13.

OH- equivalents: Ba(OH)₂ gives 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 eq.

So, net OH- eq is 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 eq. So the solution is basic, with 0.05 eq of OH- in 1.2 L.

So concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 ≈ 0.041667 M.

Then, pOH is -log(0.041667). Let me calculate that. Log(0.041667) is about log(4.1667e-2) → log(4.1667) is about 0.619, so 0.619 - 2 = -1.381? Wait, no. Wait, 0.041667 is 4.1667 × 10^-2.

Wait, log(4.1667) ≈ 0.6198. So log(4.1667e-2) = 0.6198 - 2 = -1.3802.

So pOH is -log(0.041667) = approximately 1.3802.

Then, pH is 14 - pOH = 14 - 1.3802 ≈ 12.6198, which rounds to about 12.62.

Looking at the options, option A is 12.62.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I account for all sources correctly?

Wait, another approach: when you mix these solutions, the H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH, and OH- comes from Ba(OH)₂.

HCl is a strong acid, so it donates all its H+ (0.08 moles). CH3COOH is a weak acid, but when you add a strong base, the base will deprotonate some of it. Wait, no, the base is in excess, so all the H+ will be neutralized, and then the excess OH- will determine the pH.

Wait, no, the base is in excess by 0.05 moles. So when you mix, the H+ (0.13) and OH- (0.18) will react, leaving 0.05 moles of OH-.

So the concentration of OH- is 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M. pOH is about 1.38, pH is 14 -1.38 =12.62.

So the answer should be option A) 12.62.

But wait, why is option D) 8.68 one of the options? Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the moles.

Wait, Ba(OH)₂ is 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)₂. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.18 moles of OH-.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles HCl → 0.08 H+.

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it's not fully ionized, but when mixed with a strong base, the base can deprotonate it. So the total H+ from CH3COOH is 0.05.

So total H+ is 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.13.

Total OH- is 0.18.

So the net OH- is 0.05 moles.

Thus, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38 → pH = 12.62.

So the answer is A.

To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the contributions of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions from the given solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (a weak acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (a strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (a strong base). 

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
1. **H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates.  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).

2. **H⁺ from CH₃COOH**:  
   CH₃COOH is a weak acid, but for the purpose of neutralization with a strong base, we consider all 0.05 moles of CH₃COOH as contributing H⁺.  
   Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Each mole of CH₃COOH contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so \( 0.05 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).

3. **OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, so it fully dissociates. Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻.  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

### Step 2: Neutralization reaction
The H⁺ and OH⁻ ions react in a 1:1 ratio:  
\[
\text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \rightarrow \text{H₂O}.
\]  
Total H⁺ = \( 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.13 \, \text{moles} \).  
Total OH⁻ = \( 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).  

Since OH⁻ is in excess, the remaining OH⁻ after neutralization is:  
\[
\text{Excess OH⁻} = 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 \, \text{moles}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate OH⁻ concentration
The total volume of the solution is:  
\[
\text{Total volume} = 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]  
The concentration of OH⁻ is:  
\[
[\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{\text{Excess OH⁻}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.0416667 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate pH
The pOH is calculated as:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH⁻}] = -\log(0.0416667) \approx 1.38.
\]  
The pH is then:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH of the solution is **12.62**.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.4 L = 0.08 moles HCl → 0.08 H+.

CH3COOH: 0.1 M * 0.5 L = 0.05 moles. Since it's a weak acid, it's not fully ionized, but when mixed with a strong base, the base can deprotonate it. So the total H+ from CH3COOH is 0.05.

So total H+ is 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.13.

Total OH- is 0.18.

So the net OH- is 0.05 moles.

Thus, [OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.0416667 M.

pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38 → pH = 12.62.

So the answer is A.

### Step 1: Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻
1. **H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is a strong acid, so it fully dissociates.  
   Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Each mole of HCl contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so \( 0.08 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).

2. **H⁺ from CH₃COOH**:  
   CH₃COOH is a weak acid, but for the purpose of neutralization with a strong base, we consider all 0.05 moles of CH₃COOH as contributing H⁺.  
   Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Each mole of CH₃COOH contributes 1 mole of H⁺, so \( 0.05 \, \text{moles of H⁺} \).

3. **OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ is a strong base, so it fully dissociates. Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ contributes 2 moles of OH⁻.  
   Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
   Total moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).

### Step 2: Neutralization reaction

\]  
Total H⁺ = \( 0.08 + 0.05 = 0.13 \, \text{moles} \).

Since OH⁻ is in excess, the remaining OH⁻ after neutralization is:  
\[
\text{Excess OH⁻} = 0.18 - 0.13 = 0.05 \, \text{moles}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate OH⁻ concentration
The total volume of the solution is:  
\[
\text{Total volume} = 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L}.
\]  
The concentration of OH⁻ is:  
\[
[\text{OH⁻}] = \frac{\text{Excess OH⁻}}{\text{Total volume}} = \frac{0.05}{1.2} \approx 0.0416667 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate pH
The pOH is calculated as:  
\[
\text{pOH} = -\log[\text{OH⁻}] = -\log(0.0416667) \approx 1.38.
\]  
The pH is then:  
\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH of the solution is **12.62**.
