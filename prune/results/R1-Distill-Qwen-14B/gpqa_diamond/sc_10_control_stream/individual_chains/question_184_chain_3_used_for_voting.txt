Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to find the right reaction sequence to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I should probably sketch the target molecule. It's a benzene ring with three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, let me make sure about the numbering. Oh wait, benzene is a ring, so positions are relative. Let me imagine the substituents. So if position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So they are all meta to each other? Or perhaps adjacent. Wait, the numbering would be such that substituents are in the order: position 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So if benzene is a six-membered ring, numbering goes sequentially. So, ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, substituents would be in adjacent positions—1,2,3. So ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3, making them adjacent.

Wait, but let's think about the directing effects. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution. The substituents on the ring will direct incoming groups to certain positions.

Wait, the synthesis starts with benzene. So the plan is to introduce these substituents in an order that allows the directing effects to work in our favor.

So the target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro.

Let me think about the order of adding these groups. Nitration is a strong meta-directing group. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Tert-butyl is a bulky, activating, ortho/para-directing group as well. Wait, but the positions are adjacent, so perhaps the substituents are introduced in a way that allows for maximum directing. Alternatively, maybe some groups are added before others to control where the next substituent goes.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to approach this by considering the possibility of using Friedel-Crafts alkylation and acylation, nitrations, sulfonation, etc.

I remember that Friedel-Crafts alkylation typically uses AlCl3 as a catalyst, like with tert-butyl chloride. But Friedel-Crafts tends to introduce substituents in a certain order.

Wait, the ethoxy group is an ether. That might be introduced via an alkoxy group, perhaps through a nucleophilic substitution, but more likely via an SN2 or using something like Williamson ether synthesis. But since we're starting with benzene, maybe we use a substitution after activating the ring.

Wait, but benzene can't be directly attached to an ether. Oh wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using ethyl chloride and AlCl3? No, wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation usually introduces alkyl groups, but for ethers, maybe the ethoxy is introduced via another method, perhaps via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires a strongly activating group and a good leaving group.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced after nitration and alkylation. Wait, perhaps I should think about which substituent is added first to control the positions of the others.

Wait, the target molecule has all three substituents on the ring. Let's think about each substituent's effect on the ring's reactivity and directing.

Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Tert-butyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group but bulky.

Wait, if I add a nitro group first, it would deactivating the ring and direct any subsequent electrophiles to meta positions. But in the target, the nitro group is at position 3, and the ethoxy and tert-butyl are at positions 1 and 2, which are ortho to each other, perhaps.

But wait, if I add nitro first, then the ring becomes deactivating. Adding another group might be difficult because it's harder to substitute on a deactivating ring. So maybe nitro is added last.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced first, activating the ring. Then, adding the tert-butyl group in a position directed by the ethoxy. Then adding the nitro group in the correct position.

Wait, but I need to think about the order of addition. Let me outline possible steps.

Let me think about each substituent's order to get the correct positions.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

So, if I add ethoxy first, then when I add tert-butyl, it could go into the para or ortho positions relative to ethoxy. But if ethoxy is at position 1, then adding tert-butyl in position 2 would be ortho to ethoxy, which is possible. Then, adding nitro in position 3, which is ortho to the tert-butyl group but meta to the ethoxy?

Wait, but nitro is a meta director. Wait, after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the next substituent is nitro. Let's think about the directing effects.

Wait, when you have multiple substituents, the positions are determined by the most influential group—usually the strongest directors. Nitro is a strong meta director. Ethoxy is ortho/para. Tert-butyl is also ortho/para.

So, perhaps the order in which substituents are added matters a lot.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is introduced first. Let me see: if I nitrate benzene, the nitro group goes in position 1. Then, adding ethoxy would go into ortho or para relative to nitro, but nitro is meta-directing. Wait, if I have nitro group at position 3, then adding ethoxy would go into positions that are meta to nitro, which might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added first. Let's say I perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation with ethyl chloride and AlCl3 to get ethylbenzene. But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation tends to have issues with steric hindrance, and ethyl is a small group, so it could work. Alternatively, perhaps introducing the ethoxy group directly via a different method.

Wait, another way to introduce ethoxy group is via a nucleophilic substitution. But benzene isn't very nucleophilic. Oh, perhaps I should consider making a phenol first and then converting it to an ether. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's more straightforward to consider the reactions step by step, considering each possible option.

Looking at the options, each option lists a series of reactions. Let's check each option's steps.

Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; v) dilute H2SO4 ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) Fe/HCl ; ix) HNO3/H2SO4

Wait, so option A starts with Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. So the first substituent is tert-butyl. Then, nitration (ii), sulfonation (iii), diazotization (iv), acid (v), then H3O+ and heat (vi), which might be a hydrolysis step. Then NaOH and EtBr (vii), which is likely an SN2 displacement to introduce an ethoxy group. Then Fe/HCl (viii), which is a catalyst for some reaction, perhaps another substitution, and finally another nitration (ix). Hmm, but that seems a bit convoluted.

Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4.

So, same initial steps: alkylation with t-butyl, then nitration. Then Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction?), then another nitration, which might not make sense if nitration is done again. Wait, but nitration after alkylation and nitration would perhaps add another nitro group, but the target has only one nitro group. Hmm, not sure.

Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr.

So, first t-butyl via FC alkylation, then sulfonation, then nitration. Then Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction?), then diazotization, then another nitration, then H3O+ and heat, then dilute H2SO4, and finally NaOH and EtBr. I'm not sure about the sequence here.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ; vii) dilute H2SO4 ; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; ix) NaOH/EtBr.

So D starts with nitration. So first substituent is nitro. Then Fe/HCl, which is a catalyst for reductions, perhaps. Then FC alkylation with t-butyl. Then another nitration. Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the correct order of substituents. The target has three groups: ethoxy, t-butyl, and nitro. Let's think about how to introduce them.

Adding nitro as a meta director first would probably complicate adding the other groups because nitro deactivates the ring. Alternatively, adding activating groups first might be better.

Wait, the ethoxy group is an activating group, so perhaps adding it early would help. But wait, how to add the ethoxy group? Because benzene can't directly get an ethoxy group unless through something like a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by something else. Oh wait, wait—another approach: perhaps introducing ethoxy via a two-step process, like making a phenol and then converting it into an ether.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about each substituent.

Let me think about the target molecule again. Ethoxy is at position 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So, when adding substituents, perhaps the order is: add ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro.

But wait, adding nitro after the ethoxy and t-butyl groups would require the ring to be activated enough for nitration. Wait, but nitro is a deactivating group, so maybe it's introduced earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should add the nitro group last. Let me think. If I have ethoxy and t-butyl on the ring, they are activating, so the ring is still reactive. Then, nitrating would add the nitro group in a position influenced by both substituents.

Wait, but if the ring has ethoxy at position 1 and t-butyl at position 2, then adding nitro would go where? The ethoxy directs ortho/para, t-butyl directs ortho/para as well. But where is the available position? Nitro needs to be at position 3. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added first, but that's a deactivating group. Then adding ethoxy and t-butyl would require activating conditions, but the ring is deactivating. Hmm, that might not be feasible.

Alternatively, introducing ethoxy first. Let me imagine: benzene → ethoxybenzene via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Then, adding t-butyl in the ortho or para position relative to ethoxy. But wait, a Friedel-Crafts alkylation is difficult with ethyl chloride because it's a small alkyl group and can be problematic (like possible carbocation rearrangements, but ethyl is less likely to rearrange). So ethoxybenzene is formed.

Then, adding t-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation: but wait, the ring already has an activating group, so FC alkylation can proceed. So after ethoxy is attached, adding t-butyl would go into ortho or para relative to ethoxy. Let's say we get the t-butyl at position 2. Now, the ring has ethoxy (1) and t-butyl (2).

Now, adding nitro group. Nitration is a meta-directing, deactivating group. So where would it go? The existing substituents are ethoxy (1) and t-butyl (2). Both are ortho/para directors. But the ring is activated, so nitration can proceed.

But with two substituents, the position of the nitro group depends on the most influential substituent. Ethoxy is more activating than t-butyl? Or they are both activating. Hmm, not sure. But perhaps the nitro would be added in a position meta to one substituent and para to another. Let's see.

Wait, in the target, nitro is at 3. Let me imagine the benzene ring as a hexagon with positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So substituents at 1, 2, and 3.

If ethoxy is at 1, and t-butyl at 2, then nitro would be at 3, which is meta to ethoxy (1 → 4 would be para, 2 and 6 are ortho, 3 and 5 are meta). Wait, no. Ethoxy at 1: the meta positions would be 4 and 6. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the meta position from 1 is 4, and the ortho positions are 2 and 6.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me number the benzene ring with 1 at the top. Then, positions 2 is at upper right, 3 is lower right, 4 at bottom, 5 is lower left, 6 is upper left.

So, ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2 (ortho to ethoxy), and nitro at 3 (which is meta to ethoxy and adjacent to t-butyl). Hmm, that makes sense.

So, after adding ethoxy and t-butyl, where would the nitro group go? The ring has substituents at 1 and 2. The available positions are 3,4,5,6. But considering directing effects, ethoxy (1) is ortho/para, so para to ethoxy is 4; ortho is 2 and 6. But 2 is already occupied. So possible positions for nitration would be 4 and 6, but maybe the t-butyl group also directs.

Wait, the t-butyl group is at 2 and is ortho/para. So para to t-butyl is 6, and ortho is 1 and 3. But 1 is occupied. So possible positions for nitration directed by t-butyl would be 3 and 6.

So, where does the nitro group end up? It could be in a position directed by both substituents. If the ethoxy directs to 4 and 6 (ortho/para), and t-butyl directs to 3 and 6, then the only common position is 6. But in the target, nitro is at 3. So this suggests that perhaps the nitro group isn't added in this order.

Hmm, maybe I should think of a different order. What if I add the nitro group after adding both ethoxy and t-butyl groups? But then, the ring is activated, so nitration could still proceed, but where? Alternatively, perhaps I need to add the nitro group first, but that would deactivate the ring, making it harder to add the other groups.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy and t-butyl groups. Let me see: ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2. Now, the ring is activated, so nitration can proceed. Where would the nitro group go? The ethoxy directs to ortho/para (positions 2 and 6 for para), but 2 is already taken. So para would be 4, but that's not where we want nitro. Alternatively, the t-butyl group at 2 directs to ortho (1 and 3) and para (6). Position 3 is available. So the nitro could go into position 3, which is adjacent to the t-butyl and meta to the ethoxy.

Ah, that makes sense. So the order would be: first ethoxy, then t-butyl, then nitro.

But wait, how do I introduce the ethoxy group? Because benzene can't directly undergo Friedel-Crafts alkylation with ethyl chloride to get ethoxybenzene? Or can it? Wait, no. Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an alkyl group, not an ether. So ethoxy would have to be introduced in a different way.

Ah, right! To introduce an ethoxy group on benzene, you can't do Friedel-Crafts alkylation because that would add an ethyl group, not an ethoxy. So maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a different method, perhaps by converting a phenol to an ether.

Wait, but benzene can't be directly converted into phenol without some modification. Alternatively, perhaps we can perform a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a good leaving group and activating groups.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a Williamson-type synthesis, but that typically involves an alkoxide attacking an alkyl halide, but for aromatic rings, maybe it's different.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced after another substituent has been added, making the ring more reactive towards electrophilic substitution with an ethoxy group. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using diethyl sulfate or some other method. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation, not for adding ether groups.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction. But benzene isn't nucleophilic enough for that. So maybe we make a phenol first, then convert to an ether.

To make a phenol from benzene, we can nitrate, then reduce the nitro group to an amino group, then sulfonate, then perform a hydrolysis to get the phenol. Then, the phenol can be converted to an ether via a substitution reaction.

Wait, but that's a lot of steps. Let me outline: benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene → reduction (Fe/HCl) → aniline → sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) → sulfanilic acid → hydrolysis → phenol. Then, phenol can undergo alkylation to form ethoxybenzene.

But wait, that would take several steps, and I'm not sure if that's part of any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Grignard reagent, but that's typically for adding methyl groups, not ethoxy.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again and see which one makes the most sense.

Looking at option D: starts with nitration (HNO3/H2SO4), then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), then FC alkylation with t-butyl, then another nitration. Hmm, but the target has only one nitro group.

Option B: starts with t-butyl, then nitration, then Fe/HCl, then another nitration. Wait, that would result in two nitro groups, which isn't the case.

Option C: starts with t-butyl, then sulfonation, then nitration, then Fe/HCl, diazotization, then another nitration, then H3O+, then dilute H2SO4, then NaOH and EtBr. Hmm, that seems complicated.

Option A: starts with t-butyl, then nitration, then sulfonation, then diazotization, etc. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the ethoxy group first, then t-butyl, then nitro. But how to add ethoxy? Maybe via FC acylation followed by something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that would require a strong activating group, like a nitro group adjacent, but maybe that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a coupling reaction, but that's probably beyond the scope of this question.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after a sulfonic acid group is introduced. Like, making a tosyl group which can then be replaced by ethoxy.

Wait, let's think: benzene → sulfonation → benzene sulfonic acid. Then, perhaps perform a substitution with an ethyl group? But that's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a two-step process: first, introducing a leaving group, then substituting with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the steps in each option and see which one could lead to the target.

Option D: steps are nitration first. So, benzene → nitrobenzene. Then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction? Like converting nitro to amine). Then, FC alkylation with t-butyl chloride. Then, nitration again.

Wait, but after nitration, the ring is deactivating. So, after nitration, adding t-butyl via FC alkylation would be difficult because the ring is deactivating. So, perhaps that's not the right order.

Option A: starts with t-butyl via FC. Then nitrates. Then sulfonates. Let's see: benzene → t-butyl benzene via FC. Then, nitration would add nitro in a position directed by t-butyl (ortho/para). Then sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group. Then, diazotization, etc. Hmm, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after another group has been added. For example, making a bromo group which is then replaced by ethoxy.

Wait, but that would require a good leaving group. Maybe through a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by something else.

Another approach: the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 reaction, but that's not typical for benzene. Or perhaps via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, you need a strongly activating group, like a nitro group in the ortho or para position, making the ring more activated in that spot.

Wait, for nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring must be activated. So, if I have a nitro group in the meta position, perhaps the ring is activated in the para position relative to nitro. But not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a phenol intermediate. Let me think: benzene undergoes nitration to become nitrobenzene. Then, perhaps it's reduced to aniline. Then, aniline is sulfonated to make sulphanilic acid. Then, the sulfonic acid group is replaced with ethoxy via a substitution. But that seems complex and may not be part of any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy comes from a substitution after introducing another group that can be replaced.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation with an acetyl group, then something else. But that would give an acetyl group, not ethoxy.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the product steps again.

Looking at the target molecule, it has three substituents: ethoxy, t-butyl, nitro. The steps in the options include various reactions, such as nitration, sulfonation, diazotization, etc.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after a leaving group has been attached. For example, making a bromide which is then replaced by an ethoxy group.

But how to make that bromide? Maybe through a Friedel-Crafts alkylation with a bromide, but that would add an alkyl group, not a bromide directly attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution of a nitro group. But nitro groups are not good leaving groups unless under specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 reaction using a benzyl halide. But benzyl halides typically undergo elimination or other reactions, not substitution on the aromatic ring.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced after converting a nitro group into a leaving group. For example, nitro → amine → diazonium salt → substitution.

But in that case, the order would be: nitro group added first, then converted to a diazonium salt, then substituted with ethoxy. But that would require the ring to have a nitro group, which is deactivating, so adding other groups would be difficult.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is added in a position directed by the t-butyl group. Let me think about the steps in option C.

Option C: steps are t-butyl, sulfonate, nitrate, Fe/HCl, diazo, nitrate, H3O+, dilute H2SO4, NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, that's a lot. Let me break it down:

1. t-butyl via FC alkylation → t-butylbenzene.
2. SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation, adds a sulfonic acid group. Now, two substituents: t-butyl and sulfonic acid.
3. HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Where does nitro go? Sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. t-butyl is activating, ortho/para.
4. Fe/HCl → maybe reduction of nitro to amine?
5. NaNO2/HCl → diazotization (makes diazonium chloride).
6. HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration? Not sure.
7. H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis? Maybe of a diazo compound.
8. Dilute H2SO4 → acid workup.
9. NaOH/EtBr → SN2 substitution, perhaps introducing an ethoxy group.

Wait, but the target has only one nitro group. So step 3 and step 6 would add two nitro groups? That might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps step 6 is not a nitration but another reaction. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this sequence introduces the nitro group in the correct position.

Wait, perhaps I should number the substituents. Let's think about each step in option C.

Step 1: t-butyl attached. So, benzene becomes t-butylbenzene.

Step 2: sulfonate. Now, the ring has t-butyl and sulfonic acid. Sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating group, meta-directing. So, the next substituent (nitro) would be added in a position meta to the sulfonic acid and para to the t-butyl.

Wait, t-butyl is at position 1. Sulfonic acid is at position 4 (meta to t-butyl). Then, nitration would occur in positions directed by both substituents.

Wait, t-butyl is ortho/para director, and sulfonic acid is meta director. So, the possible positions for nitro would be influenced by both. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after sulfonation and nitration, the nitro is at a position that can be later manipulated.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about each option's steps and see which one leads to the correct substituents in the right positions.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule has nitro at position 3. So, how can that happen?

If I have the ethoxy group at 1 and t-butyl at 2, then nitro at 3.

So, let's think about the order of adding these groups.

Perhaps I should add ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy? Maybe through a different pathway.

Wait, perhaps I can add ethoxy via a substitution after making a nitro group. For example, if I have a nitro group at position 3, then I can perform a substitution to add ethoxy at position 1.

But nitro is a meta director, so adding ethoxy would go into positions 1 and 5 (if starting from nitro). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after the nitro group is in place.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for the option that has the nitro group added last, following the ethoxy and t-butyl.

Looking at the options, option B is: t-butyl, nitrate, Fe/HCl, nitrate again, which might add two nitro groups, which is not desired.

Option D starts with nitration, then FC alkylation with t-butyl, which is difficult because after nitration, the ring is deactivating, so FC alkylation may not proceed.

Option A: t-butyl, nitrate, sulfonate, diazo, H3O+, NaOH/EtBr, Fe/HCl, nitrate again.

Wait, perhaps after t-butyl and nitrate, the ring has t-butyl and nitro. Then sulfonate adds a sulfonic acid group. Then diazo and H3O+ may remove something. Then NaOH/EtBr adds ethoxy via SN2. Then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), then nitrate again.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are: t-butyl → nitro → sulfonate → something else → ethoxy → nitro again. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add nitro last. So the steps would be:

1. Ethoxy group added first.

But how? Let's think ethoxy is added via FC alkylation. Wait, no, FC alkylation adds alkyl groups, not ethoxy. So another method is needed.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction after a nitro group is present. So, if I have nitro at position 3, then I can substitute another group into position 1.

Wait, but substituting on the aromatic ring requires a good leaving group, which nitro is not. Unless it's converted into something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Grignard-like reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a benzene ring that has been made more reactive, such as through a sulfonic acid group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction. For example, benzene is first acylated to form acetophenone, then a nucleophilic substitution occurs to introduce the ethoxy group. But I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for an option that introduces ethoxy via an SN2 reaction, like NaOH and EtBr. Looking at the options, they all have a step with NaOH and EtBr (steps vii in option A, vii in B, ix in C, ix in D).

Wait, in the options, the NaOH and EtBr step is likely an SN2 reaction to substitute a leaving group with an ethoxy group.

So perhaps the correct sequence is to first introduce a leaving group (like Br) at the desired position, then substitute with ethoxy.

So, steps would be:

1. Introduce tert-butyl via FC alkylation.

2. Nitrate to introduce nitro group.

3. Introduce a leaving group (like Br) at the desired position for ethoxy.

4. Substitute Br with ethoxy using NaOH and EtBr.

5. Maybe another reaction to adjust substituents.

Wait, but how to introduce the Br?

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is introduced via a FC alkylation of a bromide, but that would add an alkyl bromide, not a bromine directly on the ring.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is added via a substitution after another group is in place.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

First, nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene (deactivating, meta director).

Then, perform some reaction to add a substituent that can be replaced with ethoxy.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me consider each option again.

Option D: i) nitrate first → nitrobenzene. ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine (aniline). iii) FC alkylation with t-butyl chloride → t-butyl attached. iv) nitrate again → another nitro group? But target has only one.

Hmm, not likely.

Option C: steps are t-butyl, sulfonate, nitrate, Fe/HCl, diazo, nitrate again, H3O+, dilute H2SO4, NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, perhaps after step iii) nitrate, we have a nitro group. Then Fe/HCl may reduce it to an amine. Then diazo reaction forms a diazonium salt. Then maybe a substitution occurs. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add t-butyl via FC alkylation.

2. Nitrate → nitro group in a specific position.

3. Sulfonate → another substituent.

4. Diazotization → forms diazonium salt.

5. H3O+ and heat → hydrolysis to phenol.

6. Dilute H2SO4 → acid workup.

7. NaOH and EtBr → substituting a leaving group with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after ethoxy and t-butyl, but how?

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D. Let me see. Option D's steps:

i) nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → likely reduction to make aniline.

iii) FC alkylation with t-butyl → t-butyl attached. But wait, after reduction, the ring has an amino group. FC alkylation with t-butyl would add t-butyl to the ring. But where?

Aniline is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So adding t-butyl would go into ortho or para to the amino group.

Then, iv) nitrate → nitro group added.

But after adding amino and t-butyl, nitration would be directed by the amino and t-butyl groups.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think about the product and the steps required.

The target has ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So, the positions are 1,2,3 in a row. So, perhaps the groups are added in the order of ethoxy, t-butyl, nitro.

But again, adding ethoxy first is tricky.

Wait, perhaps ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after a leaving group is in place. For example, the nitro group is added first, which is a meta director, then a leaving group is introduced in the desired position for ethoxy, then substituted.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: looking for the presence of a sulfonic acid group in the options.

Option C has sulfonate as step ii. So, after adding t-butyl, sulfonate is added. Then, nitrate, Fe/HCl (maybe reduction), then diazo, then nitrate again, then H3O+, then dilute H2SO4, then NaOH and EtBr.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not confident.

Wait, maybe I should think about the sequence of reactions to introduce each substituent.

I think the correct order is:

1. Add ethoxy group.

But since I can't directly FC alkylate to add ethoxy, perhaps I need to introduce it via a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after a nitro group is in place. So:

- Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

- Then, reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

- Then, introduce a leaving group in the desired position for ethoxy. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to use a Friedel-Crafts acylation to add an acetyl group, then reduce it to a CH2 group, but that's not directly giving ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strong activating group, such as a nitro group in the ortho or para position.

So, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Introduce a good leaving group (like Br) in the desired position for ethoxy (position 1), perhaps via a substitution.

But how to introduce Br? Maybe via a FC alkylation with Br, but that would add an alkyl bromide, not a bromine on the ring.

Wait, perhaps another approach: using a sulfonic acid group as a leaving group. For example:

- Benzene → sulfonate → benzene sulfonic acid.

- Then, substitute the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires the ring to be activated, which it isn't unless another group is present.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for the option that introduces the ethoxy group via NaOH and EtBr, which would be an SN2 reaction.

Looking at the options, each has a step with NaOH and EtBr. So, perhaps the correct sequence is:

After introducing a bromine in the desired position for ethoxy, perform NaOH and EtBr to substitute Br with ethoxy.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add t-butyl via FC alkylation.

2. Add nitro group in the correct position.

3. Add bromine in the position where ethoxy will go.

4. Substitute Br with ethoxy via NaOH and EtBr.

But how to add bromine?

Wait, perhaps through a FC alkylation using a bromide, but that would add an alkyl bromide, not an aryl bromide.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is added via a substitution after nitration.

Alternatively, maybe the correct option is option A, which has steps that include substituting Br with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the positions of the substituents. If the nitro group is added after the ethoxy and t-butyl, then the nitro would be directed by both groups. Since ethoxy and t-butyl are activating and ortho/para directors, nitro would be added in a position that's ortho to both, which would be position 3.

So, the order would be: ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy? Maybe via a substitution after a nitro group is added.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after a leaving group is introduced.

Wait, maybe the correct option is option D, which starts with nitration, then reduces nitro to amine, then FC alkylates with t-butyl, then nitrates again. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the positions again. If I have ethoxy at 1 and t-butyl at 2, nitration would add nitro at 3, which is ortho to t-butyl and meta to ethoxy. That makes sense.

So, the order would be: ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy? Maybe through a substitution after a nitro group is present.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a coupling reaction or another method.

But I'm not seeing it. Since time is limited, perhaps I should pick the option that introduces ethoxy via NaOH and EtBr, and the nitro group in the correct position.

Looking at the options, which option has the nitro group added after both ethoxy and t-butyl groups?

Option C: steps are t-butyl, sulfonate, nitrate, Fe/HCl, diazo, nitrate, H3O+, dilute H2SO4, NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, perhaps after t-butyl and sulfonate, nitrate adds nitro. Then, Fe/HCl reduces it to amine. Then, diazo forms a diazonium salt, which upon treatment with H3O+ and heat would undergo hydrolysis to phenol. Then, NaOH and EtBr would substitute a leaving group with ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after ethoxy and t-butyl.

Looking at option D, after nitration, reduction, then FC alkylation with t-butyl, then nitration again. So, the nitro would be added after the t-butyl, which might be the correct position.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D. Let me read option D's steps again:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine (aniline).

iii) t-butyl via FC → t-butyl attached. Since the ring has an amino group (activating, ortho/para), the t-butyl would go into ortho or para.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again, adding another nitro group. But target has only one, so this seems wrong.

Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

After nitration, reduction, FC alkylation, and then another nitration, but that would result in two nitro groups. So option D is not correct.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, but I think option D is not the right one. Let me look at option B.

Option B: steps are t-butyl, nitrate, Fe/HCl, nitrate again, which again results in two nitro groups. So probably not.

Option C: steps after t-butyl and sulfonate would involve nitration, which could add nitro in a position influenced by both groups.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A, which has steps that could involve substituting ethoxy after introducing t-butyl and nitro.

Wait, let me outline the steps in option A:

i) t-butyl via FC → t-butylbenzene.

ii) nitrate → nitro group added.

iii) sulfonate → adds sulfonic acid.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazo reaction.

v) dilute H2SO4 → workup.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitute Br with ethoxy.

viii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction.

ix) nitrate again → another nitro group.

But the target has only one nitro, so option A might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D because it introduces nitro first, then others.

Hmm, I'm not confident, but given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess. I think the correct order is to add the ethoxy group first, then t-butyl, then nitro. But since I don't see an option that does this, perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, no, option D starts with nitration, which would deactivate the ring, making FC alkylation difficult. So perhaps option D is not correct.

After struggling through all these possibilities, I think the correct option is option D, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, another thought: the nitro group is meta to ethoxy and ortho to t-butyl. So, if ethoxy is at 1 and t-butyl at 2, nitro is at 3. To achieve this, perhaps the nitro group is added last, directed by both ethoxy and t-butyl.

So, the correct sequence would be ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy? Maybe via substitution after a nitro group is present.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C, which has steps that end with NaOH/EtBr (adding ethoxy), followed by other steps. Let me consider option C's steps:

i) t-butyl → t-butylbenzene.

ii) sulfonate → adds sulfonic acid group.

iii) nitrate → nitro added.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration? Hmm.

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitute Br with ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps after steps i-iii, the ring has t-butyl, sulfonic acid, and nitro. Then, Fe/HCl reduces nitro to amine. Then, diazo forms a diazonium salt. Then, H3O+ and heat hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a phenol. Then, dilute H2SO4 perhaps protonates something. Finally, NaOH and EtBr substitute Br with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after the first nitration, the ring has t-butyl and nitro. Then, sulfonate adds a sulfonic acid group. Then, diazo and hydrolysis convert a substituent into a phenol, which is then substituted with ethoxy.

Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but given the options, I think option D is the correct one. But I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the key challenge is to determine the correct sequence of reactions that introduces the substituents (ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro) in the correct positions (1, 2, and 3, respectively) while accounting for the directing effects of the substituents. The analysis of each option is as follows:

### Key Considerations:
1. **Substituent Effects**:
   - **Ethoxy**: Activating, ortho/para-directing.
   - **tert-Butyl**: Activating, ortho/para-directing (bulkier than ethoxy).
   - **Nitro**: Deactivating, meta-directing.

2. **Order of Addition**:
   - Adding the nitro group first would deactivate the ring, making subsequent substitutions difficult.
   - Adding the ethoxy group first would activate the ring, but ethoxy is challenging to introduce directly via Friedel-Crafts alkylation as it is not an alkyl group.

3. **Substitution Methods**:
   - The ethoxy group can be introduced via nucleophilic aromatic substitution after a suitable leaving group is present, but this requires activation of the ring.
   - The tert-butyl group can be introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, which is feasible with tert-butyl chloride.

### Analysis of Options:
#### **Option A**:
- Sequence: t-butyl → nitration → sulfonation → diazotization → H3O+/heat → NaOH/EtBr → Fe/HCl → nitration.
- This sequence introduces the tert-butyl group first, then nitro, and includes steps for sulfonation, diazotization, and substitution with ethoxy. However, the final nitration step would likely add an additional nitro group, resulting in a product with two nitro groups, which is inconsistent with the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
- Sequence: t-butyl → nitration → Fe/HCl → nitration → diazotization → H3O+/heat → NaOH/EtBr → sulfonation → dilute H2SO4.
- This sequence also introduces the tert-butyl group first, followed by nitration. However, the second nitration step would again result in two nitro groups, making this option incorrect.

#### **Option C**:
- Sequence: t-butyl → sulfonation → nitration → Fe/HCl → diazotization → nitration → H3O+/heat → dilute H2SO4 → NaOH/EtBr.
- This sequence introduces the tert-butyl group first, followed by sulfonation and nitration. The Fe/HCl step likely reduces the nitro group to an amine, and subsequent steps involve diazotization and substitution. However, the sequence is convoluted, and the timing of ethoxy introduction is unclear, making it difficult to confirm this as the correct pathway.

#### **Option D**:
- Sequence: Nitration → Fe/HCl → t-butyl → nitration → diazotization → sulfonation → dilute H2SO4 → H3O+/heat → NaOH/EtBr.
- This sequence starts with nitration, which deactivates the ring, making subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation (to introduce tert-butyl) unlikely to proceed efficiently. Additionally, the second nitration step would result in two nitro groups, which is inconsistent with the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the desired synthesis pathway. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option D** is the most plausible choice, despite its flaws. It starts with nitration, which aligns with the meta-directing nature of the nitro group, even though the subsequent steps are problematic.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to find the right reaction sequence to synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I should probably sketch the target molecule. It's a benzene ring with three substituents: a tert-butyl group at position 2, an ethoxy group at position 1, and a nitro group at position 3. Wait, let me make sure about the numbering. Oh wait, benzene is a ring, so positions are relative. Let me imagine the substituents. So if position 1 is ethoxy, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So they are all meta to each other? Or perhaps adjacent. Wait, the numbering would be such that substituents are in the order: position 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), 3 (nitro). So if benzene is a six-membered ring, numbering goes sequentially. So, ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, substituents would be in adjacent positions—1,2,3. So ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at 2, and nitro at 3, making them adjacent.

Wait, but let's think about the directing effects. Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution. The substituents on the ring will direct incoming groups to certain positions.

Wait, the synthesis starts with benzene. So the plan is to introduce these substituents in an order that allows the directing effects to work in our favor.

So the target has three substituents: ethoxy, tert-butyl, nitro.

Let me think about the order of adding these groups. Nitration is a strong meta-directing group. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Tert-butyl is a bulky, activating, ortho/para-directing group as well. Wait, but the positions are adjacent, so perhaps the substituents are introduced in a way that allows for maximum directing. Alternatively, maybe some groups are added before others to control where the next substituent goes.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to approach this by considering the possibility of using Friedel-Crafts alkylation and acylation, nitrations, sulfonation, etc.

I remember that Friedel-Crafts alkylation typically uses AlCl3 as a catalyst, like with tert-butyl chloride. But Friedel-Crafts tends to introduce substituents in a certain order.

Wait, the ethoxy group is an ether. That might be introduced via an alkoxy group, perhaps through a nucleophilic substitution, but more likely via an SN2 or using something like Williamson ether synthesis. But since we're starting with benzene, maybe we use a substitution after activating the ring.

Wait, but benzene can't be directly attached to an ether. Oh wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using ethyl chloride and AlCl3? No, wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation usually introduces alkyl groups, but for ethers, maybe the ethoxy is introduced via another method, perhaps via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires a strongly activating group and a good leaving group.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is introduced after nitration and alkylation. Wait, perhaps I should think about which substituent is added first to control the positions of the others.

Wait, the target molecule has all three substituents on the ring. Let's think about each substituent's effect on the ring's reactivity and directing.

Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Ethoxy is an activating, ortho/para-directing group. Tert-butyl is an activating, ortho/para-directing group but bulky.

Wait, if I add a nitro group first, it would deactivating the ring and direct any subsequent electrophiles to meta positions. But in the target, the nitro group is at position 3, and the ethoxy and tert-butyl are at positions 1 and 2, which are ortho to each other, perhaps.

But wait, if I add nitro first, then the ring becomes deactivating. Adding another group might be difficult because it's harder to substitute on a deactivating ring. So maybe nitro is added last.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced first, activating the ring. Then, adding the tert-butyl group in a position directed by the ethoxy. Then adding the nitro group in the correct position.

Wait, but I need to think about the order of addition. Let me outline possible steps.

Let me think about each substituent's order to get the correct positions.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. So substituents are at positions 1 (ethoxy), 2 (tert-butyl), and 3 (nitro).

So, if I add ethoxy first, then when I add tert-butyl, it could go into the para or ortho positions relative to ethoxy. But if ethoxy is at position 1, then adding tert-butyl in position 2 would be ortho to ethoxy, which is possible. Then, adding nitro in position 3, which is ortho to the tert-butyl group but meta to the ethoxy?

Wait, but nitro is a meta director. Wait, after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the next substituent is nitro. Let's think about the directing effects.

Wait, when you have multiple substituents, the positions are determined by the most influential group—usually the strongest directors. Nitro is a strong meta director. Ethoxy is ortho/para. Tert-butyl is also ortho/para.

So, perhaps the order in which substituents are added matters a lot.

Alternatively, maybe the nitro group is introduced first. Let me see: if I nitrate benzene, the nitro group goes in position 1. Then, adding ethoxy would go into ortho or para relative to nitro, but nitro is meta-directing. Wait, if I have nitro group at position 3, then adding ethoxy would go into positions that are meta to nitro, which might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added first. Let's say I perform a Friedel-Crafts alkylation with ethyl chloride and AlCl3 to get ethylbenzene. But wait, Friedel-Crafts alkylation tends to have issues with steric hindrance, and ethyl is a small group, so it could work. Alternatively, perhaps introducing the ethoxy group directly via a different method.

Wait, another way to introduce ethoxy group is via a nucleophilic substitution. But benzene isn't very nucleophilic. Oh, perhaps I should consider making a phenol first and then converting it to an ether. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's more straightforward to consider the reactions step by step, considering each possible option.

Looking at the options, each option lists a series of reactions. Let's check each option's steps.

Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iv) NaNO2/HCl ; v) dilute H2SO4 ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) Fe/HCl ; ix) HNO3/H2SO4

Wait, so option A starts with Friedel-Crafts alkylation with tert-butyl chloride. So the first substituent is tert-butyl. Then, nitration (ii), sulfonation (iii), diazotization (iv), acid (v), then H3O+ and heat (vi), which might be a hydrolysis step. Then NaOH and EtBr (vii), which is likely an SN2 displacement to introduce an ethoxy group. Then Fe/HCl (viii), which is a catalyst for some reaction, perhaps another substitution, and finally another nitration (ix). Hmm, but that seems a bit convoluted.

Option B: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) HNO3/H2SO4 ; iii) Fe/HCl ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; vii) NaOH/EtBr ; viii) SO3/H2SO4 ; ix) dilute H2SO4.

So, same initial steps: alkylation with t-butyl, then nitration. Then Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction?), then another nitration, which might not make sense if nitration is done again. Wait, but nitration after alkylation and nitration would perhaps add another nitro group, but the target has only one nitro group. Hmm, not sure.

Option C: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; ii) SO3/H2SO4 ; iii) HNO3/H2SO4 iv) Fe/HCl ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) HNO3/H2SO4 ; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; viii) dilute H2SO4 ix) NaOH/EtBr.

So, first t-butyl via FC alkylation, then sulfonation, then nitration. Then Fe/HCl (maybe a reduction?), then diazotization, then another nitration, then H3O+ and heat, then dilute H2SO4, and finally NaOH and EtBr. I'm not sure about the sequence here.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 ; ii) Fe/HCl ; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3 ; iv) HNO3/H2SO4 ; v) NaNO2/HCl ; vi) SO3/H2SO4 ; vii) dilute H2SO4 ; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat ; ix) NaOH/EtBr.

So D starts with nitration. So first substituent is nitro. Then Fe/HCl, which is a catalyst for reductions, perhaps. Then FC alkylation with t-butyl. Then another nitration. Not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the correct order of substituents. The target has three groups: ethoxy, t-butyl, and nitro. Let's think about how to introduce them.

Adding nitro as a meta director first would probably complicate adding the other groups because nitro deactivates the ring. Alternatively, adding activating groups first might be better.

Wait, the ethoxy group is an activating group, so perhaps adding it early would help. But wait, how to add the ethoxy group? Because benzene can't directly get an ethoxy group unless through something like a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by something else. Oh wait, wait—another approach: perhaps introducing ethoxy via a two-step process, like making a phenol and then converting it into an ether.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about each substituent.

Let me think about the target molecule again. Ethoxy is at position 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So, when adding substituents, perhaps the order is: add ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro.

But wait, adding nitro after the ethoxy and t-butyl groups would require the ring to be activated enough for nitration. Wait, but nitro is a deactivating group, so maybe it's introduced earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should add the nitro group last. Let me think. If I have ethoxy and t-butyl on the ring, they are activating, so the ring is still reactive. Then, nitrating would add the nitro group in a position influenced by both substituents.

Wait, but if the ring has ethoxy at position 1 and t-butyl at position 2, then adding nitro would go where? The ethoxy directs ortho/para, t-butyl directs ortho/para as well. But where is the available position? Nitro needs to be at position 3. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added first, but that's a deactivating group. Then adding ethoxy and t-butyl would require activating conditions, but the ring is deactivating. Hmm, that might not be feasible.

Alternatively, introducing ethoxy first. Let me imagine: benzene → ethoxybenzene via Friedel-Crafts alkylation. Then, adding t-butyl in the ortho or para position relative to ethoxy. But wait, a Friedel-Crafts alkylation is difficult with ethyl chloride because it's a small alkyl group and can be problematic (like possible carbocation rearrangements, but ethyl is less likely to rearrange). So ethoxybenzene is formed.

Then, adding t-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation: but wait, the ring already has an activating group, so FC alkylation can proceed. So after ethoxy is attached, adding t-butyl would go into ortho or para relative to ethoxy. Let's say we get the t-butyl at position 2. Now, the ring has ethoxy (1) and t-butyl (2).

Now, adding nitro group. Nitration is a meta-directing, deactivating group. So where would it go? The existing substituents are ethoxy (1) and t-butyl (2). Both are ortho/para directors. But the ring is activated, so nitration can proceed.

But with two substituents, the position of the nitro group depends on the most influential substituent. Ethoxy is more activating than t-butyl? Or they are both activating. Hmm, not sure. But perhaps the nitro would be added in a position meta to one substituent and para to another. Let's see.

Wait, in the target, nitro is at 3. Let me imagine the benzene ring as a hexagon with positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So substituents at 1, 2, and 3.

If ethoxy is at 1, and t-butyl at 2, then nitro would be at 3, which is meta to ethoxy (1 → 4 would be para, 2 and 6 are ortho, 3 and 5 are meta). Wait, no. Ethoxy at 1: the meta positions would be 4 and 6. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the meta position from 1 is 4, and the ortho positions are 2 and 6.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me number the benzene ring with 1 at the top. Then, positions 2 is at upper right, 3 is lower right, 4 at bottom, 5 is lower left, 6 is upper left.

So, ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2 (ortho to ethoxy), and nitro at 3 (which is meta to ethoxy and adjacent to t-butyl). Hmm, that makes sense.

So, after adding ethoxy and t-butyl, where would the nitro group go? The ring has substituents at 1 and 2. The available positions are 3,4,5,6. But considering directing effects, ethoxy (1) is ortho/para, so para to ethoxy is 4; ortho is 2 and 6. But 2 is already occupied. So possible positions for nitration would be 4 and 6, but maybe the t-butyl group also directs.

Wait, the t-butyl group is at 2 and is ortho/para. So para to t-butyl is 6, and ortho is 1 and 3. But 1 is occupied. So possible positions for nitration directed by t-butyl would be 3 and 6.

So, where does the nitro group end up? It could be in a position directed by both substituents. If the ethoxy directs to 4 and 6 (ortho/para), and t-butyl directs to 3 and 6, then the only common position is 6. But in the target, nitro is at 3. So this suggests that perhaps the nitro group isn't added in this order.

Hmm, maybe I should think of a different order. What if I add the nitro group after adding both ethoxy and t-butyl groups? But then, the ring is activated, so nitration could still proceed, but where? Alternatively, perhaps I need to add the nitro group first, but that would deactivate the ring, making it harder to add the other groups.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy and t-butyl groups. Let me see: ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2. Now, the ring is activated, so nitration can proceed. Where would the nitro group go? The ethoxy directs to ortho/para (positions 2 and 6 for para), but 2 is already taken. So para would be 4, but that's not where we want nitro. Alternatively, the t-butyl group at 2 directs to ortho (1 and 3) and para (6). Position 3 is available. So the nitro could go into position 3, which is adjacent to the t-butyl and meta to the ethoxy.

Ah, that makes sense. So the order would be: first ethoxy, then t-butyl, then nitro.

But wait, how do I introduce the ethoxy group? Because benzene can't directly undergo Friedel-Crafts alkylation with ethyl chloride to get ethoxybenzene? Or can it? Wait, no. Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds an alkyl group, not an ether. So ethoxy would have to be introduced in a different way.

Ah, right! To introduce an ethoxy group on benzene, you can't do Friedel-Crafts alkylation because that would add an ethyl group, not an ethoxy. So maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a different method, perhaps by converting a phenol to an ether.

Wait, but benzene can't be directly converted into phenol without some modification. Alternatively, perhaps we can perform a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a good leaving group and activating groups.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the ethoxy group is introduced via a Williamson-type synthesis, but that typically involves an alkoxide attacking an alkyl halide, but for aromatic rings, maybe it's different.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced after another substituent has been added, making the ring more reactive towards electrophilic substitution with an ethoxy group. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Friedel-Crafts alkylation using diethyl sulfate or some other method. Wait, no, Friedel-Crafts is for alkylation, not for adding ether groups.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction. But benzene isn't nucleophilic enough for that. So maybe we make a phenol first, then convert to an ether.

To make a phenol from benzene, we can nitrate, then reduce the nitro group to an amino group, then sulfonate, then perform a hydrolysis to get the phenol. Then, the phenol can be converted to an ether via a substitution reaction.

Wait, but that's a lot of steps. Let me outline: benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene → reduction (Fe/HCl) → aniline → sulfonation (SO3/H2SO4) → sulfanilic acid → hydrolysis → phenol. Then, phenol can undergo alkylation to form ethoxybenzene.

But wait, that would take several steps, and I'm not sure if that's part of any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Grignard reagent, but that's typically for adding methyl groups, not ethoxy.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again and see which one makes the most sense.

Looking at option D: starts with nitration (HNO3/H2SO4), then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), then FC alkylation with t-butyl, then another nitration. Hmm, but the target has only one nitro group.

Option B: starts with t-butyl, then nitration, then Fe/HCl, then another nitration. Wait, that would result in two nitro groups, which isn't the case.

Option C: starts with t-butyl, then sulfonation, then nitration, then Fe/HCl, diazotization, then another nitration, then H3O+, then dilute H2SO4, then NaOH and EtBr. Hmm, that seems complicated.

Option A: starts with t-butyl, then nitration, then sulfonation, then diazotization, etc. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add the ethoxy group first, then t-butyl, then nitro. But how to add ethoxy? Maybe via FC acylation followed by something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that would require a strong activating group, like a nitro group adjacent, but maybe that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a coupling reaction, but that's probably beyond the scope of this question.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution after a sulfonic acid group is introduced. Like, making a tosyl group which can then be replaced by ethoxy.

Wait, let's think: benzene → sulfonation → benzene sulfonic acid. Then, perhaps perform a substitution with an ethyl group? But that's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a two-step process: first, introducing a leaving group, then substituting with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should think about the steps in each option and see which one could lead to the target.

Option D: steps are nitration first. So, benzene → nitrobenzene. Then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction? Like converting nitro to amine). Then, FC alkylation with t-butyl chloride. Then, nitration again.

Wait, but after nitration, the ring is deactivating. So, after nitration, adding t-butyl via FC alkylation would be difficult because the ring is deactivating. So, perhaps that's not the right order.

Option A: starts with t-butyl via FC. Then nitrates. Then sulfonates. Let's see: benzene → t-butyl benzene via FC. Then, nitration would add nitro in a position directed by t-butyl (ortho/para). Then sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group. Then, diazotization, etc. Hmm, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution after another group has been added. For example, making a bromo group which is then replaced by ethoxy.

Wait, but that would require a good leaving group. Maybe through a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by something else.

Another approach: the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 reaction, but that's not typical for benzene. Or perhaps via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For that, you need a strongly activating group, like a nitro group in the ortho or para position, making the ring more activated in that spot.

Wait, for nucleophilic aromatic substitution, the ring must be activated. So, if I have a nitro group in the meta position, perhaps the ring is activated in the para position relative to nitro. But not sure.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a phenol intermediate. Let me think: benzene undergoes nitration to become nitrobenzene. Then, perhaps it's reduced to aniline. Then, aniline is sulfonated to make sulphanilic acid. Then, the sulfonic acid group is replaced with ethoxy via a substitution. But that seems complex and may not be part of any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy comes from a substitution after introducing another group that can be replaced.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation with an acetyl group, then something else. But that would give an acetyl group, not ethoxy.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the product steps again.

Looking at the target molecule, it has three substituents: ethoxy, t-butyl, nitro. The steps in the options include various reactions, such as nitration, sulfonation, diazotization, etc.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a substitution reaction after a leaving group has been attached. For example, making a bromide which is then replaced by an ethoxy group.

But how to make that bromide? Maybe through a Friedel-Crafts alkylation with a bromide, but that would add an alkyl group, not a bromide directly attached to the ring.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution of a nitro group. But nitro groups are not good leaving groups unless under specific conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 reaction using a benzyl halide. But benzyl halides typically undergo elimination or other reactions, not substitution on the aromatic ring.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced after converting a nitro group into a leaving group. For example, nitro → amine → diazonium salt → substitution.

But in that case, the order would be: nitro group added first, then converted to a diazonium salt, then substituted with ethoxy. But that would require the ring to have a nitro group, which is deactivating, so adding other groups would be difficult.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy group is added in a position directed by the t-butyl group. Let me think about the steps in option C.

Option C: steps are t-butyl, sulfonate, nitrate, Fe/HCl, diazo, nitrate, H3O+, dilute H2SO4, NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, that's a lot. Let me break it down:

1. t-butyl via FC alkylation → t-butylbenzene.
2. SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation, adds a sulfonic acid group. Now, two substituents: t-butyl and sulfonic acid.
3. HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Where does nitro go? Sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. t-butyl is activating, ortho/para.
4. Fe/HCl → maybe reduction of nitro to amine?
5. NaNO2/HCl → diazotization (makes diazonium chloride).
6. HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration? Not sure.
7. H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis? Maybe of a diazo compound.
8. Dilute H2SO4 → acid workup.
9. NaOH/EtBr → SN2 substitution, perhaps introducing an ethoxy group.

Wait, but the target has only one nitro group. So step 3 and step 6 would add two nitro groups? That might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps step 6 is not a nitration but another reaction. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps this sequence introduces the nitro group in the correct position.

Wait, perhaps I should number the substituents. Let's think about each step in option C.

Step 1: t-butyl attached. So, benzene becomes t-butylbenzene.

Step 2: sulfonate. Now, the ring has t-butyl and sulfonic acid. Sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating group, meta-directing. So, the next substituent (nitro) would be added in a position meta to the sulfonic acid and para to the t-butyl.

Wait, t-butyl is at position 1. Sulfonic acid is at position 4 (meta to t-butyl). Then, nitration would occur in positions directed by both substituents.

Wait, t-butyl is ortho/para director, and sulfonic acid is meta director. So, the possible positions for nitro would be influenced by both. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps after sulfonation and nitration, the nitro is at a position that can be later manipulated.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about each option's steps and see which one leads to the correct substituents in the right positions.

Wait, another angle: the target molecule has nitro at position 3. So, how can that happen?

If I have the ethoxy group at 1 and t-butyl at 2, then nitro at 3.

So, let's think about the order of adding these groups.

Perhaps I should add ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy? Maybe through a different pathway.

Wait, perhaps I can add ethoxy via a substitution after making a nitro group. For example, if I have a nitro group at position 3, then I can perform a substitution to add ethoxy at position 1.

But nitro is a meta director, so adding ethoxy would go into positions 1 and 5 (if starting from nitro). Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic substitution after the nitro group is in place.

But I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for the option that has the nitro group added last, following the ethoxy and t-butyl.

Looking at the options, option B is: t-butyl, nitrate, Fe/HCl, nitrate again, which might add two nitro groups, which is not desired.

Option D starts with nitration, then FC alkylation with t-butyl, which is difficult because after nitration, the ring is deactivating, so FC alkylation may not proceed.

Option A: t-butyl, nitrate, sulfonate, diazo, H3O+, NaOH/EtBr, Fe/HCl, nitrate again.

Wait, perhaps after t-butyl and nitrate, the ring has t-butyl and nitro. Then sulfonate adds a sulfonic acid group. Then diazo and H3O+ may remove something. Then NaOH/EtBr adds ethoxy via SN2. Then Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), then nitrate again.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are: t-butyl → nitro → sulfonate → something else → ethoxy → nitro again. But I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to add nitro last. So the steps would be:

1. Ethoxy group added first.

But how? Let's think ethoxy is added via FC alkylation. Wait, no, FC alkylation adds alkyl groups, not ethoxy. So another method is needed.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction after a nitro group is present. So, if I have nitro at position 3, then I can substitute another group into position 1.

Wait, but substituting on the aromatic ring requires a good leaving group, which nitro is not. Unless it's converted into something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a Grignard-like reaction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a benzene ring that has been made more reactive, such as through a sulfonic acid group.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a Friedel-Crafts acylation followed by a reduction. For example, benzene is first acylated to form acetophenone, then a nucleophilic substitution occurs to introduce the ethoxy group. But I'm not sure if that's feasible.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for an option that introduces ethoxy via an SN2 reaction, like NaOH and EtBr. Looking at the options, they all have a step with NaOH and EtBr (steps vii in option A, vii in B, ix in C, ix in D).

Wait, in the options, the NaOH and EtBr step is likely an SN2 reaction to substitute a leaving group with an ethoxy group.

So perhaps the correct sequence is to first introduce a leaving group (like Br) at the desired position, then substitute with ethoxy.

So, steps would be:

1. Introduce tert-butyl via FC alkylation.

2. Nitrate to introduce nitro group.

3. Introduce a leaving group (like Br) at the desired position for ethoxy.

4. Substitute Br with ethoxy using NaOH and EtBr.

5. Maybe another reaction to adjust substituents.

Wait, but how to introduce the Br?

Alternatively, perhaps the Br is introduced via a FC alkylation of a bromide, but that would add an alkyl bromide, not a bromine directly on the ring.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is added via a substitution after another group is in place.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

First, nitrate benzene to get nitrobenzene (deactivating, meta director).

Then, perform some reaction to add a substituent that can be replaced with ethoxy.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me consider each option again.

Option D: i) nitrate first → nitrobenzene. ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine (aniline). iii) FC alkylation with t-butyl chloride → t-butyl attached. iv) nitrate again → another nitro group? But target has only one.

Hmm, not likely.

Option C: steps are t-butyl, sulfonate, nitrate, Fe/HCl, diazo, nitrate again, H3O+, dilute H2SO4, NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, perhaps after step iii) nitrate, we have a nitro group. Then Fe/HCl may reduce it to an amine. Then diazo reaction forms a diazonium salt. Then maybe a substitution occurs. Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add t-butyl via FC alkylation.

2. Nitrate → nitro group in a specific position.

3. Sulfonate → another substituent.

4. Diazotization → forms diazonium salt.

5. H3O+ and heat → hydrolysis to phenol.

6. Dilute H2SO4 → acid workup.

7. NaOH and EtBr → substituting a leaving group with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after ethoxy and t-butyl, but how?

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D. Let me see. Option D's steps:

i) nitrate → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → likely reduction to make aniline.

iii) FC alkylation with t-butyl → t-butyl attached. But wait, after reduction, the ring has an amino group. FC alkylation with t-butyl would add t-butyl to the ring. But where?

Aniline is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So adding t-butyl would go into ortho or para to the amino group.

Then, iv) nitrate → nitro group added.

But after adding amino and t-butyl, nitration would be directed by the amino and t-butyl groups.

Wait, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think about the product and the steps required.

The target has ethoxy at 1, t-butyl at 2, nitro at 3.

So, the positions are 1,2,3 in a row. So, perhaps the groups are added in the order of ethoxy, t-butyl, nitro.

But again, adding ethoxy first is tricky.

Wait, perhaps ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after a leaving group is in place. For example, the nitro group is added first, which is a meta director, then a leaving group is introduced in the desired position for ethoxy, then substituted.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a coupling reaction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: looking for the presence of a sulfonic acid group in the options.

Option C has sulfonate as step ii. So, after adding t-butyl, sulfonate is added. Then, nitrate, Fe/HCl (maybe reduction), then diazo, then nitrate again, then H3O+, then dilute H2SO4, then NaOH and EtBr.

But I'm not seeing the connection.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not confident.

Wait, maybe I should think about the sequence of reactions to introduce each substituent.

I think the correct order is:

1. Add ethoxy group.

But since I can't directly FC alkylate to add ethoxy, perhaps I need to introduce it via a substitution.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a substitution after a nitro group is in place. So:

- Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

- Then, reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

- Then, introduce a leaving group in the desired position for ethoxy. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is to use a Friedel-Crafts acylation to add an acetyl group, then reduce it to a CH2 group, but that's not directly giving ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strong activating group, such as a nitro group in the ortho or para position.

So, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Introduce a good leaving group (like Br) in the desired position for ethoxy (position 1), perhaps via a substitution.

But how to introduce Br? Maybe via a FC alkylation with Br, but that would add an alkyl bromide, not a bromine on the ring.

Wait, perhaps another approach: using a sulfonic acid group as a leaving group. For example:

- Benzene → sulfonate → benzene sulfonic acid.

- Then, substitute the sulfonic acid group with ethoxy via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires the ring to be activated, which it isn't unless another group is present.

Hmm, maybe I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for the option that introduces the ethoxy group via NaOH and EtBr, which would be an SN2 reaction.

Looking at the options, each has a step with NaOH and EtBr. So, perhaps the correct sequence is:

After introducing a bromine in the desired position for ethoxy, perform NaOH and EtBr to substitute Br with ethoxy.

So, the steps would be:

1. Add t-butyl via FC alkylation.

2. Add nitro group in the correct position.

3. Add bromine in the position where ethoxy will go.

4. Substitute Br with ethoxy via NaOH and EtBr.

But how to add bromine?

Wait, perhaps through a FC alkylation using a bromide, but that would add an alkyl bromide, not an aryl bromide.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is added via a substitution after nitration.

Alternatively, maybe the correct option is option A, which has steps that include substituting Br with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: think about the positions of the substituents. If the nitro group is added after the ethoxy and t-butyl, then the nitro would be directed by both groups. Since ethoxy and t-butyl are activating and ortho/para directors, nitro would be added in a position that's ortho to both, which would be position 3.

So, the order would be: ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy? Maybe via a substitution after a nitro group is added.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after a leaving group is introduced.

Wait, maybe the correct option is option D, which starts with nitration, then reduces nitro to amine, then FC alkylates with t-butyl, then nitrates again. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the positions again. If I have ethoxy at 1 and t-butyl at 2, nitration would add nitro at 3, which is ortho to t-butyl and meta to ethoxy. That makes sense.

So, the order would be: ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy? Maybe through a substitution after a nitro group is present.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a coupling reaction or another method.

But I'm not seeing it. Since time is limited, perhaps I should pick the option that introduces ethoxy via NaOH and EtBr, and the nitro group in the correct position.

Looking at the options, which option has the nitro group added after both ethoxy and t-butyl groups?

Option C: steps are t-butyl, sulfonate, nitrate, Fe/HCl, diazo, nitrate, H3O+, dilute H2SO4, NaOH/EtBr.

Wait, perhaps after t-butyl and sulfonate, nitrate adds nitro. Then, Fe/HCl reduces it to amine. Then, diazo forms a diazonium salt, which upon treatment with H3O+ and heat would undergo hydrolysis to phenol. Then, NaOH and EtBr would substitute a leaving group with ethoxy.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after ethoxy and t-butyl.

Looking at option D, after nitration, reduction, then FC alkylation with t-butyl, then nitration again. So, the nitro would be added after the t-butyl, which might be the correct position.

But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D. Let me read option D's steps again:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine (aniline).

iii) t-butyl via FC → t-butyl attached. Since the ring has an amino group (activating, ortho/para), the t-butyl would go into ortho or para.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again, adding another nitro group. But target has only one, so this seems wrong.

Hmm, that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

After nitration, reduction, FC alkylation, and then another nitration, but that would result in two nitro groups. So option D is not correct.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck, but I think option D is not the right one. Let me look at option B.

Option B: steps are t-butyl, nitrate, Fe/HCl, nitrate again, which again results in two nitro groups. So probably not.

Option C: steps after t-butyl and sulfonate would involve nitration, which could add nitro in a position influenced by both groups.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option A, which has steps that could involve substituting ethoxy after introducing t-butyl and nitro.

Wait, let me outline the steps in option A:

i) t-butyl via FC → t-butylbenzene.

ii) nitrate → nitro group added.

iii) sulfonate → adds sulfonic acid.

iv) NaNO2/HCl → diazo reaction.

v) dilute H2SO4 → workup.

vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitute Br with ethoxy.

viii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction.

ix) nitrate again → another nitro group.

But the target has only one nitro, so option A might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option D, but I'm not seeing it clearly.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option D because it introduces nitro first, then others.

Hmm, I'm not confident, but given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess. I think the correct order is to add the ethoxy group first, then t-butyl, then nitro. But since I don't see an option that does this, perhaps option D is correct.

Wait, no, option D starts with nitration, which would deactivate the ring, making FC alkylation difficult. So perhaps option D is not correct.

After struggling through all these possibilities, I think the correct option is option D, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, another thought: the nitro group is meta to ethoxy and ortho to t-butyl. So, if ethoxy is at 1 and t-butyl at 2, nitro is at 3. To achieve this, perhaps the nitro group is added last, directed by both ethoxy and t-butyl.

So, the correct sequence would be ethoxy first, then t-butyl, then nitro.

But how to add ethoxy? Maybe via substitution after a nitro group is present.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C, which has steps that end with NaOH/EtBr (adding ethoxy), followed by other steps. Let me consider option C's steps:

i) t-butyl → t-butylbenzene.

ii) sulfonate → adds sulfonic acid group.

iii) nitrate → nitro added.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration? Hmm.

vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat → hydrolysis.

viii) dilute H2SO4 → acid workup.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitute Br with ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps after steps i-iii, the ring has t-butyl, sulfonic acid, and nitro. Then, Fe/HCl reduces nitro to amine. Then, diazo forms a diazonium salt. Then, H3O+ and heat hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a phenol. Then, dilute H2SO4 perhaps protonates something. Finally, NaOH and EtBr substitute Br with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after the first nitration, the ring has t-butyl and nitro. Then, sulfonate adds a sulfonic acid group. Then, diazo and hydrolysis convert a substituent into a phenol, which is then substituted with ethoxy.

Honestly, I'm not entirely sure, but given the options, I think option D is the correct one. But I'm not confident.


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the key challenge is to determine the correct sequence of reactions that introduces the substituents (ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro) in the correct positions (1, 2, and 3, respectively) while accounting for the directing effects of the substituents. The analysis of each option is as follows:

### Key Considerations:
1. **Substituent Effects**:
   - **Ethoxy**: Activating, ortho/para-directing.
   - **tert-Butyl**: Activating, ortho/para-directing (bulkier than ethoxy).
   - **Nitro**: Deactivating, meta-directing.

2. **Order of Addition**:
   - Adding the nitro group first would deactivate the ring, making subsequent substitutions difficult.
   - Adding the ethoxy group first would activate the ring, but ethoxy is challenging to introduce directly via Friedel-Crafts alkylation as it is not an alkyl group.

3. **Substitution Methods**:
   - The ethoxy group can be introduced via nucleophilic aromatic substitution after a suitable leaving group is present, but this requires activation of the ring.
   - The tert-butyl group can be introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, which is feasible with tert-butyl chloride.

### Analysis of Options:
#### **Option A**:
- Sequence: t-butyl → nitration → sulfonation → diazotization → H3O+/heat → NaOH/EtBr → Fe/HCl → nitration.
- This sequence introduces the tert-butyl group first, then nitro, and includes steps for sulfonation, diazotization, and substitution with ethoxy. However, the final nitration step would likely add an additional nitro group, resulting in a product with two nitro groups, which is inconsistent with the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
- Sequence: t-butyl → nitration → Fe/HCl → nitration → diazotization → H3O+/heat → NaOH/EtBr → sulfonation → dilute H2SO4.
- This sequence also introduces the tert-butyl group first, followed by nitration. However, the second nitration step would again result in two nitro groups, making this option incorrect.

#### **Option C**:
- Sequence: t-butyl → sulfonation → nitration → Fe/HCl → diazotization → nitration → H3O+/heat → dilute H2SO4 → NaOH/EtBr.
- This sequence introduces the tert-butyl group first, followed by sulfonation and nitration. The Fe/HCl step likely reduces the nitro group to an amine, and subsequent steps involve diazotization and substitution. However, the sequence is convoluted, and the timing of ethoxy introduction is unclear, making it difficult to confirm this as the correct pathway.

#### **Option D**:
- Sequence: Nitration → Fe/HCl → t-butyl → nitration → diazotization → sulfonation → dilute H2SO4 → H3O+/heat → NaOH/EtBr.
- This sequence starts with nitration, which deactivates the ring, making subsequent Friedel-Crafts alkylation (to introduce tert-butyl) unlikely to proceed efficiently. Additionally, the second nitration step would result in two nitro groups, which is inconsistent with the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences perfectly align with the desired synthesis pathway. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option D** is the most plausible choice, despite its flaws. It starts with nitration, which aligns with the meta-directing nature of the nitro group, even though the subsequent steps are problematic.

ANSWER: D
