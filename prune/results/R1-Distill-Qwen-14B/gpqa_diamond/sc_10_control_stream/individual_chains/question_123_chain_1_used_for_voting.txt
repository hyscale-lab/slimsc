Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and its ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The problem says that the supernova ejecta and the Galaxy are both inertial frames. Oh wait, inertial frames are ones that are not accelerating, moving at constant velocity. So, that means we can use special relativity here, right? Because in special relativity, the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers.

The question is about finding how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Wait, no, actually, it's the other way around. Wait, no, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy. Or wait, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s.

Wait, so let me clarify the frames. Let's say the Galaxy is at rest in its own frame (Galaxy frame), and the ejecta is moving towards the center (so in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at some speed v). Alternatively, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. But wait, speed is relative. So in reality, if the ejecta is moving at v towards the Galaxy, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v as well, but only if the motion is along the same line.

Wait, but no, wait. In reality, if in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at v towards the Galaxy, then in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy would be moving towards it at v as well. Because relative velocity is symmetric in that case. Hmm, but wait, no, I think that's only when both are moving along the same line. So that's probably correct.

Wait, but the problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it. So that would mean that in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy. No, wait, no. Because when you switch frames, the velocity reverses direction but the magnitude depends on the relative velocity.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The velocity measured in each frame depends on the relative speed. So if the ejecta's frame (let's call it S') is moving at velocity v relative to the Galaxy frame (S), then an object at rest in S (like the Galaxy) would appear to be moving at velocity -v in S'. But wait, in this case, the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So that implies that the ejecta's frame is moving at 60,000 km/s relative to the Galaxy's frame, but in the opposite direction.

Wait no, let me think again. Let's model it. Let's say the Galaxy is at rest in frame S. The ejecta is moving towards the center (which is in the direction, say, negative x-axis) at velocity v in S. So in the ejecta's frame S', the Galaxy is moving in the opposite direction, which is positive x' direction.

No, wait. If in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the center (which is in the direction let's say negative x), then in S', the frame of the ejecta, the Galaxy's center is moving at velocity -v (since from S', the Galaxy is moving towards it at speed v). Wait, no, wait. If in S, the ejecta is moving at +v towards the Galaxy (so if the Galaxy is at rest at x=0, and the ejecta is moving towards x=0 from some x positive location), then in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy would be approaching at velocity v. Because relative velocity is such that if you're moving at v towards something, that something is moving towards you at v in your frame. So if the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy in the Galaxy's frame, then the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, that makes sense. So in this problem, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy in the Galaxy's frame. So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at the same speed, 60,000 km/s.

Wait, but that's not correct, because according to the problem statement, the ejecta's frame is moving such that the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy.

So, now the question is: when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how far does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me rephrase. The time is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. We need to find the distance covered in the Galaxy's frame during that time.

Hmm, so in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. So we can find the distance the ejecta travels in its own frame, but we need the distance in the Galaxy's frame. But wait, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s, so if the time is longer, the distance would be greater. Or perhaps the other way around.

Wait, no. Because in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. But due to time dilation, the Galaxy's frame would see a different time. Wait, but perhaps we need to calculate the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame, which requires knowing the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is longer than 50 seconds.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the problem again.

The problem states: the ejecta's frame observes the Galaxy approaching at 60,000 km/s. So the relative speed between the two frames is 60,000 km/s. But wait, wait. No. Because in special relativity, if you are in a frame S' moving at velocity v relative to S, then an object at rest in S will appear to move at velocity v in S'.

So, if the ejecta's frame S' is moving at v towards the Galaxy (which is in S), then the Galaxy (which is at rest in S) would appear to move towards S' at v. So in the problem, from S', the Galaxy is approaching at v=60,000 km/s. So that implies that in S (Galaxy frame), the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy.

So, the Galaxy is frame S, the ejecta is frame S', moving at v=60,000 km/s relative to S.

But wait, wait a second. Let me get the directions right. If the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy (which is in S), then in the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at v=60,000 km/s. So that's correct.

Now, the problem is: in S' (ejecta's frame), 50 seconds pass. What is the distance the ejecta travels in S (Galaxy's frame) during that time?

Wait, that's not correct. Because in S, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s towards the center of the Galaxy. So, from S's perspective, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s. The duration of time is 50 seconds in S' (ejecta's frame), but S' is moving relative to S.

So to find the distance in S, we need to find the time duration in S. Because the distance is v multiplied by time in S.

But how to find the time in S? Because the time experienced in S' is 50 seconds. So we'll have to consider time dilation.

Wait, time dilation occurs because moving clocks run slower. So, the time in S (Galaxy frame) will be longer than the time in S' (ejecta's frame) when the events happen.

Wait, but which way is the time dilation? Let me think. The proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (say, the start and end of the 50 seconds) happen at the same place. So, if in S', the 50 seconds is the proper time, then the time in S would be longer.

Wait, but in this case, the events are: the start of the 50 seconds and the end of the 50 seconds. In the ejecta's frame (S'), these two events happen at the same place (since the ejecta is at rest in S'). So, the proper time is 50 seconds. Therefore, in the Galaxy's frame (S), the time elapsed would be longer. So, the time in S is gamma multiplied by the proper time.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where v is the relative velocity between the frames.

Wait, but v is 60,000 km/s. Let's compute that in terms of c. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2 c. So v = 0.2c.

So, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So, the time in S is t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Then, the distance the ejecta travels in S (Galaxy's frame) is v * t. v is 60,000 km/s, and t is 51.03 seconds.

60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 km = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate gamma more accurately.

v = 0.2c.

v^2 = 0.04c^2.

So, 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206. So t = 50 * 1.0206 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Distance in Galaxy frame: v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 = ?

Wait, 60,000 * 50 is 3,000,000. 60,000 * 1.03 is 61,800. So total is 3,061,800 km. Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Close enough. Wait, but let's be precise with the calculations.

Wait, 50 * gamma is 50 * 1.0206 = 51.03. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Compute sqrt(0.96):

0.96^0.5 : Let me compute it. Let's see, 0.98^2 is 0.9604. So sqrt(0.96) is about 0.9798 because 0.9798^2 = (0.98 - 0.0002)^2 ≈ 0.96 - 2*(0.98)(0.0002) + (0.0002)^2 = 0.96 - 0.000392 + 0.00000004 ≈ 0.959608. Hmm, but 0.9798^2 is about 0.96.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 0.96's square root.

Let me compute 0.96 = 96/100 = 24/25. So sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5. sqrt(24) is about 4.89898. So 4.89898 /5 ≈ 0.9798.

So gamma is approximately 1.0206, as before.

So t = 1.0206 * 50 = 51.03 s.

Then, distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 = ?

Let me compute 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000. 60,000 * 0.03 = 1,800. So total is 3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. The computed value is 3,061,800, which is close but not exact. Hmm, perhaps the exact calculation of gamma is needed.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let's compute 1 - (0.2)^2 = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. So 1/sqrt(0.96) is 1/(sqrt(96/100)) )= 1/( (sqrt(96))/10 ) )= 10/(sqrt(96)).

sqrt(96) = sqrt(16*6) =4*sqrt(6) ≈4*2.4495 ≈9.798.

So 10/9.798≈1.02062.

So, more accurately, gamma is approximately 1.02062.

t = 50 * 1.02062 = 51.031 s.

So distance is 60,000 * 51.031 = 60,000 *51.031 = 60,000 *51 +60,000 *0.031.

60,000 *51 = 3,060,000.

60,000 *0.031 = 1,860.

Total is 3,061,860 km.

But the options don't have this number. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km. But why isn't it matching exactly?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. Because the problem says that the ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy in the Galaxy's frame. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s.

So, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds. So, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 ≈51.03 seconds.

So the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v*t =60,000 *51.03 = ~3,061,800 km.

But that's not one of the options. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 2,940,000 km.

B) 3,000,000 km.

C) 2,880,000 km.

D) 3,060,000 km.

Ah, option D is 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the question expects us to compute it without considering time dilation? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the situation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the distance the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, but without considering relativity. But that can't be right because the speed is a significant fraction of c (20% of c), so relativity effects are noticeable.

Wait, but perhaps I have the frames mixed up. Let me double-check.

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So, in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s towards S.

So, in S, the time is longer. So, the time in S is t = gamma * t' =50 * gamma.

So, the distance in S would be v * t =60,000 * gamma * 50.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of length contraction. Wait, but length contraction applies to objects moving relative to the frame. Wait, in this case, the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy? Hmm, but the problem is about the distance the ejecta moves, not the distance between them.

So, I think my initial approach is correct. But why isn't the option matching?

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately. Let's compute 1/sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96).

Calculate sqrt(0.96):

Let me compute it more accurately. 0.96 is 96/100 → sqrt(96)= approximately 9.798.

So, 1/sqrt(0.96)=10/9.798≈1.02062.

So, gamma is approximately 1.02062.

t =50 *1.02062=51.031 s.

So, distance: 60,000 * 51.031 = 60,000 *51 + 60,000 *0.031=3,060,000 + 1,860=3,061,860 km.

But the closest option is D, 3,060,000 km. Hmm, but 3,061,860 is 1,860 km over that. So either I made a mistake, or the problem expects an approximate value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma using a more precise method.

Wait, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9797959.

So gamma is 1/0.9797959 ≈1.02062.

So, 50 *1.02062 =51.031 s.

So 60,000 *51.031=3,061,860 km.

But perhaps the question is assuming that the time in the Galaxy's frame is the same as the ejecta's frame, which would make the distance 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km. That would be option B.

But that would be ignoring time dilation, which isn't correct at 0.2c.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the frames.

Wait, maybe the problem is the other way around. The ejecta is moving at some speed, and the time is measured in their frame. So the time in the Galaxy's frame is not gamma multiplied, but the distance is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another way: to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, we can use the velocity addition. Wait, no, because the velocities are already given.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply a question of converting the time due to length contraction.

Wait, another approach: in the ejecta's frame, the distance they move is v' * t', where v' is their speed in their own frame. Wait, but in their own frame, they are at rest. So in S', the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So, the distance the Galaxy moves in S' is 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km. But that's the distance the Galaxy moves towards the ejecta in S' frame, but we're to find the distance the ejecta moves in S frame.

Hmm, that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Lorentz transformation equations to find the distance in S.

The Lorentz transformation for time and space can help here. Let’s think about the events: the start and end of the 50 seconds in S'.

In S', the two events (start and end) are at the same place (x' = 0), with time separation t' =50 s.

We need to find the coordinates of these events in S, and then compute the distance traveled in S.

The Lorentz transformation equations are:

t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c² )

x = gamma (x' + v t')

But since x' =0 (because both events happen at the same place in S'), then:

t = gamma t'

x = gamma v t'

So, the distance the ejecta travels in S is x = gamma v t'

Substituting the values:

gamma ≈1.02062

v =60,000 km/s =0.2c (since c=300,000 km/s)

t' =50 s.

So, x = 1.02062 * 0.2c *50 s.

Wait, but 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. So,

x =1.02062 *60,000 *50 km.

Wait, 60,000 *50 =3,000,000.

Multiply by 1.02062: 3,000,000 *1.02062 =3,061,860 km.

Same result as before.

So the correct distance should be approximately 3,061,860 km.

But the options don't include this exact value. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km.

But wait, perhaps in the problem, v is 60,000 km/s, but perhaps the exact gamma is 5/4.89898. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

Compute 1/sqrt(0.96):

=1/(sqrt(96/100))=10/sqrt(96)=10/(4*sqrt(6))=5/(2*sqrt(6)).

sqrt(6) is approximately 2.44949.

So 5/(2*2.44949)=5/(4.89898)=approx 1.02062.

So, calculations are correct.

So the distance is about 3,061,860 km.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended approach is to neglect relativistic effects and just compute v*t'=60,000*50=3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that would be incorrect because at v=0.2c, time dilation is significant.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the distance in the ejecta's frame, but that's not what the question states. The question asks for the distance in the Galaxy's frame.

Hmm, maybe I should check if I got the direction of the velocity right. The ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy in the Galaxy's frame. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v*t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

But from the ejecta's frame, t' is 50 seconds.

The time in the Galaxy's frame is t=gamma * t', as we determined.

So, the distance is v * t =60,000 * (50 * gamma) =60,000 *50 *1.02062=3,000,000 *1.02062=3,061,860 km.

Again, same result.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is phrased such that the time in the Galaxy's frame is 50 seconds, but that's not the case. The problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the speed as non-relativistic and just uses v*t, so 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, option B.

But that wouldn't be correct with special relativity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the time in the Galaxy's frame as 50 seconds, but no, the problem says 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm, this is confusing. The correct calculation leads to approximately 3,061,860 km, but the closest option is D) 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the intended answer is D, approximating the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the approximate gamma as 1.02, leading to 50 *1.02=51 s, 60,000 *51=3,060,000 km, which is option D.

That would make sense. Because 1.02 *50=51, and 60,000 *51=3,060,000.

So perhaps the intended answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) in the Galaxy's frame. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy appears to move towards the ejecta at the same speed (\( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \)), as relative velocity is symmetric in inertial frames.

The problem asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during a time interval of \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \) in the ejecta's frame. To calculate this, we must account for time dilation due to the relative motion between the frames.

### Key Steps:
1. **Relating Time in the Two Frames**:  
   Using the time dilation formula in special relativity, the time in the Galaxy's frame (\( t \)) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (\( t' \)) by:
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} = 0.2c \), we calculate:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   t = \gamma t' = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Calculating the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is given by:
   \[
   d = v \cdot t
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t = 51.03 \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   d = 60,000 \times 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}.
   \]

3. **Matching the Closest Option**:  
   The calculated distance (\( 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \)) is very close to option \( D = 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \). The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \) in the ejecta's frame is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \).

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and its ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's see if I can figure this out.

The problem says that the supernova ejecta and the Galaxy are both inertial frames. Oh wait, inertial frames are ones that are not accelerating, moving at constant velocity. So, that means we can use special relativity here, right? Because in special relativity, the laws of physics are the same for all inertial observers.

The question is about finding how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Wait, no, actually, it's the other way around. Wait, no, the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy. Or wait, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s.

Wait, so let me clarify the frames. Let's say the Galaxy is at rest in its own frame (Galaxy frame), and the ejecta is moving towards the center (so in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at some speed v). Alternatively, from the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. But wait, speed is relative. So in reality, if the ejecta is moving at v towards the Galaxy, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is approaching at v as well, but only if the motion is along the same line.

Wait, but no, wait. In reality, if in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving at v towards the Galaxy, then in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy would be moving towards it at v as well. Because relative velocity is symmetric in that case. Hmm, but wait, no, I think that's only when both are moving along the same line. So that's probably correct.

Wait, but the problem states that from the ejecta's frame, the center is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it. So that would mean that in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy. No, wait, no. Because when you switch frames, the velocity reverses direction but the magnitude depends on the relative velocity.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The velocity measured in each frame depends on the relative speed. So if the ejecta's frame (let's call it S') is moving at velocity v relative to the Galaxy frame (S), then an object at rest in S (like the Galaxy) would appear to be moving at velocity -v in S'. But wait, in this case, the problem states that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So that implies that the ejecta's frame is moving at 60,000 km/s relative to the Galaxy's frame, but in the opposite direction.

Wait no, let me think again. Let's model it. Let's say the Galaxy is at rest in frame S. The ejecta is moving towards the center (which is in the direction, say, negative x-axis) at velocity v in S. So in the ejecta's frame S', the Galaxy is moving in the opposite direction, which is positive x' direction.

No, wait. If in S, the ejecta is moving at velocity v towards the center (which is in the direction let's say negative x), then in S', the frame of the ejecta, the Galaxy's center is moving at velocity -v (since from S', the Galaxy is moving towards it at speed v). Wait, no, wait. If in S, the ejecta is moving at +v towards the Galaxy (so if the Galaxy is at rest at x=0, and the ejecta is moving towards x=0 from some x positive location), then in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy would be approaching at velocity v. Because relative velocity is such that if you're moving at v towards something, that something is moving towards you at v in your frame. So if the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy in the Galaxy's frame, then the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at 60,000 km/s in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, that makes sense. So in this problem, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy in the Galaxy's frame. So in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at the same speed, 60,000 km/s.

Wait, but that's not correct, because according to the problem statement, the ejecta's frame is moving such that the Galaxy is moving at 60,000 km/s towards it. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy.

So, now the question is: when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame, how far does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy's frame?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me rephrase. The time is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. We need to find the distance covered in the Galaxy's frame during that time.

Hmm, so in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. So we can find the distance the ejecta travels in its own frame, but we need the distance in the Galaxy's frame. But wait, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s, so if the time is longer, the distance would be greater. Or perhaps the other way around.

Wait, no. Because in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. But due to time dilation, the Galaxy's frame would see a different time. Wait, but perhaps we need to calculate the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame, which requires knowing the time in the Galaxy's frame, which is longer than 50 seconds.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about the problem again.

The problem states: the ejecta's frame observes the Galaxy approaching at 60,000 km/s. So the relative speed between the two frames is 60,000 km/s. But wait, wait. No. Because in special relativity, if you are in a frame S' moving at velocity v relative to S, then an object at rest in S will appear to move at velocity v in S'.

So, if the ejecta's frame S' is moving at v towards the Galaxy (which is in S), then the Galaxy (which is at rest in S) would appear to move towards S' at v. So in the problem, from S', the Galaxy is approaching at v=60,000 km/s. So that implies that in S (Galaxy frame), the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s towards the Galaxy.

So, the Galaxy is frame S, the ejecta is frame S', moving at v=60,000 km/s relative to S.

But wait, wait a second. Let me get the directions right. If the ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy (which is in S), then in the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta at v=60,000 km/s. So that's correct.

Now, the problem is: in S' (ejecta's frame), 50 seconds pass. What is the distance the ejecta travels in S (Galaxy's frame) during that time?

Wait, that's not correct. Because in S, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s towards the center of the Galaxy. So, from S's perspective, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s. The duration of time is 50 seconds in S' (ejecta's frame), but S' is moving relative to S.

So to find the distance in S, we need to find the time duration in S. Because the distance is v multiplied by time in S.

But how to find the time in S? Because the time experienced in S' is 50 seconds. So we'll have to consider time dilation.

Wait, time dilation occurs because moving clocks run slower. So, the time in S (Galaxy frame) will be longer than the time in S' (ejecta's frame) when the events happen.

Wait, but which way is the time dilation? Let me think. The proper time is the time measured in the frame where the two events (say, the start and end of the 50 seconds) happen at the same place. So, if in S', the 50 seconds is the proper time, then the time in S would be longer.

Wait, but in this case, the events are: the start of the 50 seconds and the end of the 50 seconds. In the ejecta's frame (S'), these two events happen at the same place (since the ejecta is at rest in S'). So, the proper time is 50 seconds. Therefore, in the Galaxy's frame (S), the time elapsed would be longer. So, the time in S is gamma multiplied by the proper time.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where v is the relative velocity between the frames.

Wait, but v is 60,000 km/s. Let's compute that in terms of c. The speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 km/s is 0.2 c. So v = 0.2c.

So, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So, the time in S is t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Then, the distance the ejecta travels in S (Galaxy's frame) is v * t. v is 60,000 km/s, and t is 51.03 seconds.

60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 km = 3,061,800 km.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate gamma more accurately.

v = 0.2c.

v^2 = 0.04c^2.

So, 1 - v^2/c^2 = 0.96.

sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

So gamma is 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206. So t = 50 * 1.0206 ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Distance in Galaxy frame: v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 = ?

Wait, 60,000 * 50 is 3,000,000. 60,000 * 1.03 is 61,800. So total is 3,061,800 km. Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. Close enough. Wait, but let's be precise with the calculations.

Wait, 50 * gamma is 50 * 1.0206 = 51.03. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

Compute sqrt(0.96):

0.96^0.5 : Let me compute it. Let's see, 0.98^2 is 0.9604. So sqrt(0.96) is about 0.9798 because 0.9798^2 = (0.98 - 0.0002)^2 ≈ 0.96 - 2*(0.98)(0.0002) + (0.0002)^2 = 0.96 - 0.000392 + 0.00000004 ≈ 0.959608. Hmm, but 0.9798^2 is about 0.96.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute 0.96's square root.

Let me compute 0.96 = 96/100 = 24/25. So sqrt(24/25) = (sqrt(24))/5. sqrt(24) is about 4.89898. So 4.89898 /5 ≈ 0.9798.

So gamma is approximately 1.0206, as before.

So t = 1.0206 * 50 = 51.03 s.

Then, distance is 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s = 60,000 * 51.03 = ?

Let me compute 60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000. 60,000 * 0.03 = 1,800. So total is 3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km. The computed value is 3,061,800, which is close but not exact. Hmm, perhaps the exact calculation of gamma is needed.

Wait, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately. Let's compute 1 - (0.2)^2 = 1 - 0.04 = 0.96. So 1/sqrt(0.96) is 1/(sqrt(96/100)) )= 1/( (sqrt(96))/10 ) )= 10/(sqrt(96)).

sqrt(96) = sqrt(16*6) =4*sqrt(6) ≈4*2.4495 ≈9.798.

So 10/9.798≈1.02062.

So, more accurately, gamma is approximately 1.02062.

t = 50 * 1.02062 = 51.031 s.

So distance is 60,000 * 51.031 = 60,000 *51.031 = 60,000 *51 +60,000 *0.031.

60,000 *51 = 3,060,000.

60,000 *0.031 = 1,860.

Total is 3,061,860 km.

But the options don't have this number. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km. But why isn't it matching exactly?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. Because the problem says that the ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy in the Galaxy's frame. So, in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s.

So, the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame is longer than 50 seconds. So, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 *50 ≈51.03 seconds.

So the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v*t =60,000 *51.03 = ~3,061,800 km.

But that's not one of the options. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 2,940,000 km.

B) 3,000,000 km.

C) 2,880,000 km.

D) 3,060,000 km.

Ah, option D is 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the question expects us to compute it without considering time dilation? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the situation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking for the distance the ejecta moves in the Galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, but without considering relativity. But that can't be right because the speed is a significant fraction of c (20% of c), so relativity effects are noticeable.

Wait, but perhaps I have the frames mixed up. Let me double-check.

In the ejecta's frame (S'), the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So, in the Galaxy's frame (S), the ejecta is moving at v=60,000 km/s towards S.

So, in S, the time is longer. So, the time in S is t = gamma * t' =50 * gamma.

So, the distance in S would be v * t =60,000 * gamma * 50.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of length contraction. Wait, but length contraction applies to objects moving relative to the frame. Wait, in this case, the distance between the ejecta and the Galaxy? Hmm, but the problem is about the distance the ejecta moves, not the distance between them.

So, I think my initial approach is correct. But why isn't the option matching?

Wait, maybe I should compute gamma more accurately. Let's compute 1/sqrt(1 - 0.04) = 1/sqrt(0.96).

Calculate sqrt(0.96):

Let me compute it more accurately. 0.96 is 96/100 → sqrt(96)= approximately 9.798.

So, 1/sqrt(0.96)=10/9.798≈1.02062.

So, gamma is approximately 1.02062.

t =50 *1.02062=51.031 s.

So, distance: 60,000 * 51.031 = 60,000 *51 + 60,000 *0.031=3,060,000 + 1,860=3,061,860 km.

But the closest option is D, 3,060,000 km. Hmm, but 3,061,860 is 1,860 km over that. So either I made a mistake, or the problem expects an approximate value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma using a more precise method.

Wait, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9797959.

So gamma is 1/0.9797959 ≈1.02062.

So, 50 *1.02062 =51.031 s.

So 60,000 *51.031=3,061,860 km.

But perhaps the question is assuming that the time in the Galaxy's frame is the same as the ejecta's frame, which would make the distance 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km. That would be option B.

But that would be ignoring time dilation, which isn't correct at 0.2c.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the frames.

Wait, maybe the problem is the other way around. The ejecta is moving at some speed, and the time is measured in their frame. So the time in the Galaxy's frame is not gamma multiplied, but the distance is v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps another way: to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during the 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame, we can use the velocity addition. Wait, no, because the velocities are already given.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simply a question of converting the time due to length contraction.

Wait, another approach: in the ejecta's frame, the distance they move is v' * t', where v' is their speed in their own frame. Wait, but in their own frame, they are at rest. So in S', the Galaxy is moving towards them at 60,000 km/s. So, the distance the Galaxy moves in S' is 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km. But that's the distance the Galaxy moves towards the ejecta in S' frame, but we're to find the distance the ejecta moves in S frame.

Hmm, that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Lorentz transformation equations to find the distance in S.

The Lorentz transformation for time and space can help here. Let’s think about the events: the start and end of the 50 seconds in S'.

In S', the two events (start and end) are at the same place (x' = 0), with time separation t' =50 s.

We need to find the coordinates of these events in S, and then compute the distance traveled in S.

The Lorentz transformation equations are:

t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c² )

x = gamma (x' + v t')

But since x' =0 (because both events happen at the same place in S'), then:

t = gamma t'

x = gamma v t'

So, the distance the ejecta travels in S is x = gamma v t'

Substituting the values:

gamma ≈1.02062

v =60,000 km/s =0.2c (since c=300,000 km/s)

t' =50 s.

So, x = 1.02062 * 0.2c *50 s.

Wait, but 0.2c is 60,000 km/s. So,

x =1.02062 *60,000 *50 km.

Wait, 60,000 *50 =3,000,000.

Multiply by 1.02062: 3,000,000 *1.02062 =3,061,860 km.

Same result as before.

So the correct distance should be approximately 3,061,860 km.

But the options don't include this exact value. The closest option is D) 3,060,000 km.

But wait, perhaps in the problem, v is 60,000 km/s, but perhaps the exact gamma is 5/4.89898. Let me compute gamma more precisely.

Compute 1/sqrt(0.96):

=1/(sqrt(96/100))=10/sqrt(96)=10/(4*sqrt(6))=5/(2*sqrt(6)).

sqrt(6) is approximately 2.44949.

So 5/(2*2.44949)=5/(4.89898)=approx 1.02062.

So, calculations are correct.

So the distance is about 3,061,860 km.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the intended approach is to neglect relativistic effects and just compute v*t'=60,000*50=3,000,000 km, which is option B. But that would be incorrect because at v=0.2c, time dilation is significant.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the distance in the ejecta's frame, but that's not what the question states. The question asks for the distance in the Galaxy's frame.

Hmm, maybe I should check if I got the direction of the velocity right. The ejecta is moving towards the Galaxy in the Galaxy's frame. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s. So the distance in the Galaxy's frame is v*t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame.

But from the ejecta's frame, t' is 50 seconds.

The time in the Galaxy's frame is t=gamma * t', as we determined.

So, the distance is v * t =60,000 * (50 * gamma) =60,000 *50 *1.02062=3,000,000 *1.02062=3,061,860 km.

Again, same result.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is phrased such that the time in the Galaxy's frame is 50 seconds, but that's not the case. The problem states that 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the speed as non-relativistic and just uses v*t, so 60,000 *50=3,000,000 km, option B.

But that wouldn't be correct with special relativity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the time in the Galaxy's frame as 50 seconds, but no, the problem says 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame.

Hmm, this is confusing. The correct calculation leads to approximately 3,061,860 km, but the closest option is D) 3,060,000 km. So perhaps the intended answer is D, approximating the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the use of the approximate gamma as 1.02, leading to 50 *1.02=51 s, 60,000 *51=3,060,000 km, which is option D.

That would make sense. Because 1.02 *50=51, and 60,000 *51=3,060,000.

So perhaps the intended answer is D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) in the Galaxy's frame. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy appears to move towards the ejecta at the same speed (\( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \)), as relative velocity is symmetric in inertial frames.

The problem asks for the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during a time interval of \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \) in the ejecta's frame. To calculate this, we must account for time dilation due to the relative motion between the frames.

### Key Steps:
1. **Relating Time in the Two Frames**:  
   Using the time dilation formula in special relativity, the time in the Galaxy's frame (\( t \)) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (\( t' \)) by:
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} = 0.2c \), we calculate:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   t = \gamma t' = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}.
   \]

2. **Calculating the Distance in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   The distance traveled by the ejecta in the Galaxy's frame is given by:
   \[
   d = v \cdot t
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t = 51.03 \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   d = 60,000 \times 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}.
   \]

3. **Matching the Closest Option**:  
   The calculated distance (\( 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \)) is very close to option \( D = 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \). The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding or approximations in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame during \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \) in the ejecta's frame is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \).

ANSWER: D
