Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these reactions, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I'm supposed to identify the final product. The options are A to D. They also gave me some IR and NMR data for Compound X. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are involved in some kind of elimination or substitution reaction. Oh wait, I think that when you have a compound with a vicinal dihalide (two halogens on adjacent carbons), treating it with red phosphorus and HI can cause the elimination of HX, leading to the formation of an alkyne. Or wait, no, maybe that's when you have two different halides? Or perhaps this is a dehydrohalogenation reaction, leading to an alkene. Wait, no, the other way around. Wait, red phosphorus is often used for the dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides to form alkenes. But wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another thought: Oh, maybe if you have a compound with two adjacent halogens, like a dihalide, and you treat it with red phosphorus and HI, you might eliminate HX and form a triple bond, making an alkyne. Because I think that when you have a 1,2-dihaloalkane and you use a strong base like red phosphorus, it can eliminate twice to form an alkyne. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about that. I should think about the reagents. I remember that when you use a solution of red phosphorus in HI, it's called the hydroiodic acid method, which can dehalogenate vicinal dihalides to form alkenes or alkynes, depending on the starting material.

So, the key here is to figure out what Compound X is, right? Because once I know that, I can figure out what happens when it reacts with the reagents.

The IR and NMR data will help me figure out the structure of Compound X. Let's look at the IR first.

IR data:
- 3400–2500 cm-1: That broad range suggests O-H (like in a carboxylic acid) or maybe N-H, or maybe an alkyne's C-H stretch. Wait, alkyne C-H stretches are usually around 3300 cm-1, but if this is a broad peak, maybe it's O-H from a carboxylic acid. Also, if it's a broad peak, it could be an alcohol, but the NMR might help clarify that.

- 1720 cm-1: That's a strong peak, likely a carbonyl (C=O). So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. But the 1720 is a bit on the lower side for a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids usually have higher wavenumbers, maybe around 1700-1725? Hmm, 1720 is possible. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, another thought: In the NMR, there's a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a singlet for 1H. That's a very downfield shift, which is typical for an aldehyde proton, but wait, no—aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, another possibility is a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, but the carboxylic acid would have a broad peak, maybe around 12 ppm or so. Wait, but in the NMR, the peak at 10.5 is a broad singlet (bs). So maybe it's a phenolic OH, but that's usually less downfield. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. Or, perhaps it's a carbonyl oxygen adjacent to something else.

Wait, maybe it's a ketone. But the 10.5 ppm is a bit high for a ketone. Hmm. Let me think about the other IR peaks.

- 1610 cm-1: That's around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So there's an aromatic ring in the compound.

- 1450 cm-1: That's around where we get C-O stretching, perhaps in an ester or a phenol. But not sure.

So combining the IR data: Possible structures include a substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group. Maybe a ketone or an ester, but the NMR will help.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): As discussed, probably a carbonyl group. Maybe an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another thought: The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1 which is a strong carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be very broad, around 2500-3000 cm-1, which is in the first IR region. So the IR data has 3400–2500, which is a broad region—maybe that's the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. So that would fit. Then the 1720 would be the C=O of the acid.

So then, the NMR's 10.5 ppm might be the -COOH proton. But wait, in the NMR, the -COOH proton is usually a broad peak, but also a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent proton. Or wait, maybe not. It can vary. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but then the IR doesn't quite fit.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the NMR peaks.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): That's aromatic protons, probably on a para-substituted benzene ring. So, maybe two protons as doublets, suggesting substitution in para positions. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene, with two substituents.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons, also as doublets. So two doublets, each integrating for 2H, which suggests a para-substituted ring. Because in para substitution, you have two pairs of equivalent protons. For example, in 4-substituted benzene, you have two sets of doublets.

So, looking at those, we have an aromatic ring, probably with substituents in the para positions.

Then, looking at the other peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating for one proton. Maybe a CH group adjacent to another group, perhaps near a carbonyl.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet for two protons. Maybe next to a branching point or near another substituent.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H as a doublet—so that's likely a CH2 group attached to something, but wait, a doublet with 3H would imply it's a CH2CH3 group, where the CH2 is attached to something else. Wait, no: a doublet for 3H would be a CH2CH3, but in this case, it's a triplet? Wait, the data says 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). Oh, a doublet with 3H. That suggests a CH2CH3 group attached to a CH. So like -CH(CH2CH3)- ?

Wait, perhaps it's an isopropyl group. Or maybe a branching with a methyl group attached. Let me think: for example, if there's a CH group attached to a CH(CH2CH3), but I'm not sure yet.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating for 3H, probably a terminal CH2CH2CH3 group. So a methyl group at the end of a chain, like CH2CH2CH2CH3, but wait, 0.9 ppm and triplet—so maybe a CH2CH2CH3 group, like in an ethyl group. Wait, but the triplet would come from coupling with two adjacent protons. Wait, no, a triplet would usually come from a CH2 group next to a CH3. For example, in a CH2CH3 group, the CH2 would show a quartet (split by the CH3), and the CH3 would be a triplet. But here, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet for 3H, which would fit a CH2CH3 group. So perhaps a longer chain, like a propyl group.

Wait, but the 1.4 ppm is a doublet with 3H. So perhaps it's a CH(CH2CH3) group. So for example, the structure could have a CH group connected to a CH(CH2CH3) and another CH2 group.

Putting this all together, the NMR suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with substituents that include a CH group, and possibly a longer chain, perhaps a butyl group or something similar.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures. The IR suggested a carbonyl group, so perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a carbonyl-containing group, like a ketone, ester, or acid.

But if the IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, that's a carbonyl. So the substituent is likely a carbonyl group attached to the benzene.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any peaks around 2.1 ppm (which would be typical for a ketone or an aldehyde). Hmm. Let me think again.

The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which could be an aldehyde proton. But aldehydes typically have a strong, sharp peak around 9.5-10 ppm. So maybe it's an aldehyde. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton is a broad peak, but usually around 10-12 ppm. So 10.5 is possible for either.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe it's a vinyl group or something else, but I think that's less likely.

Let me consider the options given. The options are A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Structure would be a benzene ring with ethyl group in the para position (since 4-ethyl would be para), and a propanoic acid group attached at position 2. Wait, but propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the benzene would have substituents at positions 2 and 4.

But in the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, each as doublets. That would suggest a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, which would have two sets of two equivalent protons each. So in that case, substituents at positions 1 and 4 would lead to a pattern where the aromatic protons are in two doublets. Alternatively, substituents at positions 2 and 4 would also lead to similar splitting.

Wait, but looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would be a benzene ring with a -COOH group in position 4 (para) and a sec-butyl group in another position. Wait, but where? If the benzoic acid is at position 4, then the substituent would be at position 1, making it 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene would have substituents at 1 and 4 positions. But wait, that's not possible because benzene is a ring, so position 1 and 4 are the same as positions 4 and 1, which are across from each other. So if the benzoic acid is at position 4, and the substituent is at position 1, that's the same as position 4 and position 1 being across from each other, but that's the same as being para.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: Benzoic acid is at position 4, and the substituent is at position 1, but that's just another way of saying the same as positions 4 and 1 being the same as 4 and 4 if it's the same substituent. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on adjacent carbons. But the NMR suggests a para-substituted pattern. So let's consider each option.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene has a COOH group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 4? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 2 and 4. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's think about the NMR again. In the aromatic region, two doublets each integrating for two protons. In a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, you would have four equivalent protons, but that's not the case here. Wait, no. Let me think: if you have substituents in the para positions on a benzene ring, then the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons, each as doublets. For example, if substituents are at positions 1 and 3, that's meta, but that's not the case here. So maybe it's 1,4 positions.

Wait, for a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, each substituent is at opposite ends. So the ring would have two sets of two protons each, each set as doublets.

So, looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would have substituents at position 4 (the COOH group) and the sec-butyl group at another position. Wait, but the name is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would imply that the benzoic acid is at position 1 and the sec-butyl is at position 4. Because in the IUPAC nomenclature, the numbering starts at the functional group. So benzoic acid is at position 1, and the substituent is at position 4.

Ah, that makes sense. So the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. So the substituents are in para positions. That would explain why the aromatic protons are two doublets, each with 2H.

So in this case, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2 and 6 (if substituents are at 1 and 4). Those would be equivalent and as doublets. Then, the NMR shows two doublets, each 2H, which matches this scenario.

Now, looking at the NMR of the non-aromatic protons:

At 10.5 ppm, the broad singlet is the COOH proton. So that matches.

The other peaks: 

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe the CH group adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached at position 4. The structure would be:

COOH is at position 1, and the substituent at position 4 is a -CH2-C(CH2CH3)2 group? Wait, no: sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3) ?, no. Wait, no. Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no. Let me think: Butyl groups are four carbons. The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- ?

Wait, no. Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- but that's not correct. Wait, wait, butyl groups: the four carbons. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- but that's not right. Wait, no. Let me get this right.

The structure of a sec-butyl group is: the butyl chain is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So, the sec-butyl group is: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think: The butyl group has four carbons. The substituent is attached to the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's only three carbons. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but let's try: the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, that doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps it's -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-? No, wait, but that's a longer chain. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group attached in a way that the branching is on the second carbon. So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, but that would be a propyl group attached to another CH2, making it a longer chain. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a tert-butyl group, but the option says sec-butyl. So, let me think: the structure is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So, the substituent would be attached to the benzene ring as a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the NMR would show peaks for the CH2 and the CH(CH2CH3) groups.

Looking at the NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Could this be the CH group in the sec-butyl group? The CH in the middle, which is attached to two CH2 groups and the benzene. That would be a CH group, which as a multiplet due to coupling with adjacent protons.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Could these be the two CH2 groups adjacent to the CH in the sec-butyl group. So, the two CH2 groups would each have two protons, but their chemical shifts might be around 1.7 ppm.

Wait, but the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the methyl group attached to the CH in the sec-butyl. So, the CH is connected to a CH2CH3 group. So, the structure would be:

Benzene ring with COOH at 1 and a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group at position 4.

Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 3H, which would be the terminal CH2 of the ethyl group. So, let's see: the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. Then, the ethyl group (CH2CH3) would have its CH2 attached to the CH, and the terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet (t), which suggests it's a -CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, but in the substituent, the ethyl group is CH2CH3, which would be a triplet for the CH3. So that matches.

So, putting it all together, the substituent is a sec-butyl group: -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So, the substituent is attached to the benzene ring. The structure would be:

COOH attached at position 1, and the substituent (sec-butyl) at position 4.

So, the NMR would show:

- The aromatic protons in two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, each integrating for two protons. So that's consistent.

The sec-butyl group: the CH2 adjacent to the ring would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) for the CH group. Then, the next CH2 group would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). The terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Additionally, the methyl group (CH2CH3) attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which is a doublet.

Wait, but in the substituent structure, the CH2 next to the benzene is attached to the CH, which is connected to another CH2CH3. So, the CH2 next to the ring (the first CH2 in the substituent) would be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the protons on that CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH, which has one proton. So each of these protons would be a quartet, but in the NMR, they are a multiplet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with more branching.

Wait, another thought: Let's think about the substituent as a (sec-butyl) group. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So, the CH2 is attached to the ring, then a CH, then a CH2CH3.

So, the CH2 attached to the ring would be a -CH2- group, which would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH. Each of these two protons would be a quartet (n+1, where n=3 protons from the adjacent CH?), but perhaps more splitting.

Wait, perhaps the -CH2- group is next to a CH that has two adjacent protons. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact splitting.

But looking at the NMR data:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is the CH group in the middle of the substituent, which is connected to two CH2 groups. So, each of the two CH2 groups would have their own protons, which would be split into multiplets.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Perhaps the two protons on the CH2 group adjacent to the CH. So, each of these would be adjacent to the CH group, which has one proton. So, they'd be split into doublets of doublets, but in the NMR, it's a multiplet.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): The methyl group attached to the CH. So, the CH is connected to a CH2CH3 group. The methyl group would be a triplet if it's attached to a CH2, but in this case, it's a CH2 attached to a CH, which is attached to the ring. So, the methyl group's protons would be split by the adjacent CH2. Wait, no, the CH2CH3 group is at the end, so the methyl group would be a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2. But in the NMR, it's a doublet. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a tertiary group. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a butyl group with different branching. But I'm not entirely sure. Perhaps I should proceed with the analysis.

So, the NMR seems to support that the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring along with a COOH group in the para position.

Now, looking back at the reaction: Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I think that when a vicinal dihalide reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it can undergo dehydrohalogenation twice to form an alkyne. Alternatively, if it's a dihalide but not vicinal, perhaps it forms an alkene. Wait, I'm a bit confused on the exact conditions.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus in HI is used for the dehydrohalogenation of 1,2-dihalides to form alkenes. But if the dihalide is 1,2-dibromide, for example, treatment with HI and red phosphorus would eliminate to form an alkene. So, perhaps Compound X is a dihalide that upon elimination forms an alkyne or an alkene.

Wait, but if the starting material is a dihalide, and the product is an alkyne, then elimination would involve losing two equivalents of HX. Alternatively, perhaps the compound has a geminal dihalide, but I'm not sure.

But wait, in this case, the product options don't have any alkenes or alkynes; they're all substituted benzene rings. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the reaction is not elimination but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzyl halide, and the reaction is a substitution.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI are more commonly involved in elimination reactions, especially when dihalides are present. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of converting a benzyl halide to a benzylidene group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the leaving group (like a bromide) is replaced by a hydrogen. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne. So if Compound X is a 1,2-dihaloalkane attached to a benzene ring, treatment with red phosphorus and HI would eliminate two equivalents of HX to form an alkyne.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alkyl halide, and the reaction forms an alkene.

Hmm, but looking at the options, they all have substituents on the benzene ring without any alkenes or alkynes. So perhaps the reaction doesn't form a new pi bond but instead removes some groups.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction could be a Clemmensen reduction, but that's for ketones to alkanes, using Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat. Not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis. For example, a nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid, but that's with H2O and acid or base. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester hydrolysis, but the reagents don't seem right for that.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzyl bromide or something similar. If Compound X is a benzyl bromide, reacting with red phosphorus and HI could abstract a proton and eliminate HBr, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the halogen is replaced by an isopropyl or another group. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product. The options are all substituted benzene rings. So, perhaps the reaction removes a group from the starting material, or perhaps adds a group.

But let's think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroiodic acid method, which can cause dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides to form alkenes. So, if the starting material is a dihalide, the product would be an alkene.

But the options don't have any alkenes. They all have substituents on the benzene ring. So perhaps the dihalide is attached to the benzene ring, and elimination forms a triple bond, making a benzene ring with an alkyne substituent.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have an alkyne. So that can't be the case.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzyl halide and the reaction forms a hydrogenated product. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't an elimination but a substitution. For example, if the starting material has a bromide adjacent to a carbonyl group, the substitution could form something else. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzene ring with a substituent that has a bromide and a carbonyl group, and the reaction removes the bromide, perhaps leading to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. So, if the starting material has two adjacent bromides, like Br-CH2-CH2-CO-X, then treatment would eliminate HBr to form a double bond. But again, the options don't have alkenes.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation of a dihalide to form an alkene. For example, if the starting material is 1,2-dibromoethyl benzene, the elimination would form styrene. But again, the options don't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced. For example, if the starting material has a bromide attached to a carbon next to a carbonyl group, the substitution could form a ketone.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's go back. The starting material, Compound X, has an IR and NMR that suggests a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group (like a carboxylic acid). Then, when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of a carbon-halogen bond. For example, if the substituent on the benzene is a benzoyl bromide, reacting with HI might form a benzoyl iodide, but that doesn't seem relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester, and the reaction converts it to a carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure about the reagents for that.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI are used in the formation of alkenes from vicinal dihalides. So, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a dihalide group, and the reaction forms an alkyne.

Wait, but the options don't show any alkynes, so I'm stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a bromo group attached to a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, treating with HI might cause a nucleophilic substitution, replacing the bromide with iodide, but that doesn't change the structure much.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to summarize what I have so far.

Compound X has a para-substituted benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group (like a carboxylic acid). The substituent also has a longer chain, possibly a butyl group. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI leads to some transformation. The options are all substituted benzene rings, suggesting that perhaps the reaction doesn't add or remove any substituents but maybe modifies a functional group.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a reduction. Red phosphorus can act as a reducing agent. For example, reducing a carbonyl group. But that would require specific conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehalogenation, removing a halogen from a substituent.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about each option again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the starting material is this compound, then what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI? Well, benzoic acid doesn't have any halogens, so maybe the reaction isn't applicable. Unless the starting material has a bromide or iodide attached elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzoyl bromide, like benzoyl chloride. Then, reaction with HI would substitute Cl with I, but that doesn't seem to fit the options either.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think differently. Let's think about the reaction of each option with red phosphorus and HI, and see which one fits.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the substituent is a propanoic acid attached to the benzene ring. If Compound X is this, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI—what would happen? Well, propanoic acid doesn't have any halogens, so I'm not sure. Unless the starting material has a bromide elsewhere, but I don't see any in the structure.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So benzene with isobutyl and methyl groups in para positions. No carbonyl group. The IR data of Compound X showed a carbonyl, so this option might not fit.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This has a COOH group in para position to a sec-butyl group. So the structure includes a carbonyl. Reacting this with red phosphorus and HI—what would happen? Well, benzoic acid doesn't have any leaving groups, so perhaps no reaction would occur. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a bromide that I'm not considering.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a different compound. Let me think about the reaction again.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation of a vicinal dihalide attached to the benzene ring, leading to the formation of an alkyne. So, if the starting material is a 1,2-dibromoethyl group attached to the benzene, elimination would form a triple bond, giving a propargyl benzene.

But the options don't show any triple bonds. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an alkene, but again, none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Maybe the starting material has an ester group, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to a carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a bromide is replaced by an iodide. But that doesn't change the structure much, and the options don't reflect that.

Another angle: Let me think about the starting material's structure. The NMR suggests a carboxylic acid (10.5 ppm, broad singlet). So the structure likely has a -COOH group attached to the benzene ring. The substituent is a sec-butyl group, as we discussed earlier.

So, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Now, when this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. Red phosphorus can reduce carbonyl groups. But benzoic acid's carbonyl is a strong acid, so I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but without a leaving group, I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the starting material isn't a carboxylic acid. Let me reevaluate the IR and NMR.

The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be a ketone (around 1715 cm-1), an ester (around 1735 cm-1), or a carboxylic acid (1700-1725 cm-1). The NMR has a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid than a ketone or ester.

So, the substituent is probably a carboxylic acid group.

But then, what reaction would a carboxylic acid undergo with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting material isn't a carboxylic acid but an ester. So, the 1720 cm-1 would be an ester, and the broad peak in the IR would be an O-H from an alcohol or an acid. But if it's an ester, the O-H wouldn't be present. Hmm, conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from an alcohol, but then the 1720 would be a carbonyl from an ester or ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a phenyl ester, like a methyl benzoate. Then, the IR would show the ester carbonyl at ~1720 cm-1, and maybe an O-H from an alcohol elsewhere, but I don't see that in the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde, but the IR would show a strong C=O around 1700 cm-1, and the NMR would have a peak around 9-10 ppm for the aldehyde proton, which could fit the 10.5 ppm peak. But then, the substituent would be an aldehyde group.

But in that case, the NMR aromatic peaks would be different, maybe more downfield due to the aldehyde's electron-withdrawing effect.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI are used for dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides to form alkenes. So, perhaps the starting material is a dihalide with a substituent on the benzene.

So, if the substituent is a dihalide, like CH2BrCH2Br, attached to the benzene ring, the reaction would eliminate two HBr molecules to form a triple bond, giving a propargyl benzene.

But looking at the options, none of them are alkyne-containing. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a bromide adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, a benzoyl bromide. Then, reacting with HI might substitute the bromide with iodide, but that doesn't change the structure much.

Hmm. I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to approach this differently. Let's consider each option and think about what reaction would lead to it from Compound X.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if this is the product, what reaction would form it? If the starting material is a benzoyl bromide (Br-CO-Bz), then perhaps treatment with HI would substitute Br with I, but that's not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzene ring with a bromide and a carbonyl group, and the reaction removes the bromide. For example, if the substituent is a bromoalkane, elimination might form an alkene. But again, the options don't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, but I don't think red phosphorus and HI are used for that.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzyl bromide attached to a carbonyl group, and the reaction substitutes the bromide with an iodide. But again, the options don't reflect that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a carbonyl group to a CH2 group. For example, using red phosphorus and HI might reduce a ketone to an alcohol, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: The reaction could be a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that typically uses peracids and isn't relevant here.

Hmm, I'm really not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about what the reaction does to the substituent.

Red phosphorus and HI are used for dehydrohalogenation. So, if the substituent has two adjacent halogens, like a 1,2-dibromide, the reaction will eliminate HBr to form a double bond. So, the substituent would become an alkene.

But looking at the options, none of them have an alkene. So perhaps the substituent after reaction isn't an alkene but something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a dihalide attached to a benzene ring, and elimination forms a triple bond, making a propargyl benzene. But again, none of the options show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a bromide and a carbonyl group, and the elimination forms a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: Let's think about the possible structure of Compound X. From the NMR, it has a benzene ring, a carboxylic acid (from the 10.5 ppm peak), and a substituent with a butyl group.

So, perhaps Compound X is 4-bromobenzoic acid. Then, reacting with red phosphorus and HI would substitute the bromide with iodide, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, but the substituent is a butyl group, not a bromide. So, perhaps the substituent is a bromide attached to a butyl group.

Wait, for example, the substituent could be CH2CH2BrCH2CH3. Then, treating with red phosphorus and HI would eliminate HBr, forming an alkene. So, the substituent would become CH2=CHCH2CH3.

But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a dihalide, like CH2BrCHBrCH2CH3, which upon elimination would form an alkyne, CH≡CCH2CH3.

Again, none of the options show that.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, and the ring also has a COOH group. The substituents are in para positions.

If the reaction is between Compound X and red phosphorus/HI, what would lead to this product?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a dihalide, and the reaction forms the acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzoyl chloride with a bromide substituent, and the reaction replaces the bromide with something else, but I don't see that in the options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester to form a carboxylic acid. If the starting material is an ester with a substituent that becomes a sec-butyl group after hydrolysis, then the product would be option C.

But I'm not sure if red phosphorus and HI are used for ester hydrolysis. Typically, esters are hydrolyzed with acid or base, not with HI and red phosphorus.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a bromide in the substituent is replaced by a hydrogen, leading to a longer chain. But I'm not certain.

Another approach: Let's think about the reaction conditions and the product options. The product options are all substituted benzene rings without any alkenes or alkynes. So the reaction doesn't form any new pi bonds but perhaps modifies substituents.

If the starting material has a bromide in the substituent, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might eliminate HBr, leading to a longer chain or a branching.

Wait, for example, if the substituent is a 2-bromo-2-methylpropane (tert-butyl bromide), treatment with red phosphorus and HI might eliminate HBr, forming an alkyne. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 1-bromo-2-methylpropane, which upon elimination would form an alkene.

But again, the options don't show any alkenes or alkynes.

At this point, I'm not making much progress. Let me try to think about what the product would be.

The correct answer is likely option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Because the NMR and IR data suggest a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid and a sec-butyl group in the para position.

As for the reaction, perhaps the starting material is a bromo-substituted compound, and the reaction replaces the bromide with a hydrogen, leading to the formation of the acid.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a bromide is replaced by something else, but I'm not seeing how that leads to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzyl bromide attached to a carbonyl group, and the reaction forms the acid.

Hmm. Another thought: Maybe the starting material is a benzoyl bromide, and the reaction with HI replaces the bromide with iodide, but that doesn't lead to a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis of an acid chloride to a carboxylic acid, but again, that's typically done with water or base, not HI and red phosphorus.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a carbonyl group to a CH2 group, but that would require different conditions.

Wait, given that I'm stuck, I think I should make an educated guess. The data points towards option C as the structure of Compound X. But the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, so perhaps the product is an elimination product.

Wait, but the options don't have any elimination products. So I'm likely missing something.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituents on the benzene ring but does something else. For example, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation of a dihalide attached to a side chain, leading to an alkyne. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the bromide in the substituent is replaced by iodide, but that doesn't change the structure much.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of a carbon-bromine bond, leading to a shorter chain.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires AlCl3 as a catalyst, not red phosphorus and HI.

I'm really not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a choice. Based on the NMR and IR data, Compound X is likely 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. When this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps nothing happens, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the bromide in the substituent is replaced by iodide, but that's not reflected in the options.

Wait, another thought: Maybe Compound X is a benzoyl bromide with a substituent, and the reaction replaces the bromide with iodide, but that doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carbonyl group to a CH2 group, turning the benzoic acid into benzyl alcohol. But that would require a different reagent.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. But if the starting material has a ketone, the product would be an alkane. But our options don't have that.

Another Idea:

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. But that requires different conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a bromide in the substituent, and the reaction replaces it with a hydrogen, leading to a shorter chain.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Given that, I'll have to go with option C as the structure of Compound X, and perhaps the reaction doesn't change it, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the question is about the product after reaction, so the product would be one of the options. So perhaps the reaction doesn't involve the substituents but does something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a bromide in the substituent is replaced by an iodide, but that doesn't change the structure much.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to a double bond in the substituent. So, for example, if the substituent is a 1-bromo-2-methylpropane (isobutyl bromide), the reaction would eliminate HBr, forming an alkene, which would make the substituent an isobutylene group. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 2-bromo-2-methylpropane (tert-butyl bromide), which upon elimination would form an alkyne, but again, the options don't show that.

Given that, I'm going to make a guess that the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of an acid from an ester, but I'm not sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data of Compound X to deduce its structure. The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad, likely an O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid), 1720 cm⁻¹ (carbonyl group, likely a carboxylic acid or ester), 1610 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C stretch), and 1450 cm⁻¹ (possibly C-O stretch). The NMR data includes peaks at 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, likely a carboxylic acid proton), 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm (doublets, 2H each, indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring), and additional peaks at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), suggesting a sec-butyl group.

From this analysis, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is typically associated with dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides to form alkenes or alkynes. However, none of the options involve alkenes or alkynes, suggesting that the reaction does not alter the aromatic ring or its substituents but may instead modify a functional group.

Given the structure of Compound X and the reaction conditions, the most plausible conclusion is that the reaction does not significantly change the structure of the compound. Therefore, the final product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

Answer: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these reactions, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The question says that Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I'm supposed to identify the final product. The options are A to D. They also gave me some IR and NMR data for Compound X. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus and HI are involved in some kind of elimination or substitution reaction. Oh wait, I think that when you have a compound with a vicinal dihalide (two halogens on adjacent carbons), treating it with red phosphorus and HI can cause the elimination of HX, leading to the formation of an alkyne. Or wait, no, maybe that's when you have two different halides? Or perhaps this is a dehydrohalogenation reaction, leading to an alkene. Wait, no, the other way around. Wait, red phosphorus is often used for the dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides to form alkenes. But wait, wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, another thought: Oh, maybe if you have a compound with two adjacent halogens, like a dihalide, and you treat it with red phosphorus and HI, you might eliminate HX and form a triple bond, making an alkyne. Because I think that when you have a 1,2-dihaloalkane and you use a strong base like red phosphorus, it can eliminate twice to form an alkyne. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about that. I should think about the reagents. I remember that when you use a solution of red phosphorus in HI, it's called the hydroiodic acid method, which can dehalogenate vicinal dihalides to form alkenes or alkynes, depending on the starting material.

So, the key here is to figure out what Compound X is, right? Because once I know that, I can figure out what happens when it reacts with the reagents.

The IR and NMR data will help me figure out the structure of Compound X. Let's look at the IR first.

IR data:
- 3400–2500 cm-1: That broad range suggests O-H (like in a carboxylic acid) or maybe N-H, or maybe an alkyne's C-H stretch. Wait, alkyne C-H stretches are usually around 3300 cm-1, but if this is a broad peak, maybe it's O-H from a carboxylic acid. Also, if it's a broad peak, it could be an alcohol, but the NMR might help clarify that.

- 1720 cm-1: That's a strong peak, likely a carbonyl (C=O). So maybe a ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. But the 1720 is a bit on the lower side for a carboxylic acid. Wait, carboxylic acids usually have higher wavenumbers, maybe around 1700-1725? Hmm, 1720 is possible. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester or a ketone.

Wait, another thought: In the NMR, there's a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is a singlet for 1H. That's a very downfield shift, which is typical for an aldehyde proton, but wait, no—aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, another possibility is a carboxylic acid proton. Wait, but the carboxylic acid would have a broad peak, maybe around 12 ppm or so. Wait, but in the NMR, the peak at 10.5 is a broad singlet (bs). So maybe it's a phenolic OH, but that's usually less downfield. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde. Or, perhaps it's a carbonyl oxygen adjacent to something else.

Wait, maybe it's a ketone. But the 10.5 ppm is a bit high for a ketone. Hmm. Let me think about the other IR peaks.

- 1610 cm-1: That's around the range for aromatic C=C stretching. So there's an aromatic ring in the compound.

- 1450 cm-1: That's around where we get C-O stretching, perhaps in an ester or a phenol. But not sure.

So combining the IR data: Possible structures include a substituted benzene ring with a carbonyl group. Maybe a ketone or an ester, but the NMR will help.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:

- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): As discussed, probably a carbonyl group. Maybe an aldehyde or a carboxylic acid.

Wait, another thought: The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1 which is a strong carbonyl. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch would be very broad, around 2500-3000 cm-1, which is in the first IR region. So the IR data has 3400–2500, which is a broad region—maybe that's the O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid. So that would fit. Then the 1720 would be the C=O of the acid.

So then, the NMR's 10.5 ppm might be the -COOH proton. But wait, in the NMR, the -COOH proton is usually a broad peak, but also a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent proton. Or wait, maybe not. It can vary. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde, but then the IR doesn't quite fit.

Wait, another approach: Let's think about the NMR peaks.

- 8.0 ppm (d, 2H): That's aromatic protons, probably on a para-substituted benzene ring. So, maybe two protons as doublets, suggesting substitution in para positions. So perhaps a para-substituted benzene, with two substituents.

- 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): Another set of aromatic protons, also as doublets. So two doublets, each integrating for 2H, which suggests a para-substituted ring. Because in para substitution, you have two pairs of equivalent protons. For example, in 4-substituted benzene, you have two sets of doublets.

So, looking at those, we have an aromatic ring, probably with substituents in the para positions.

Then, looking at the other peaks:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): A multiplet integrating for one proton. Maybe a CH group adjacent to another group, perhaps near a carbonyl.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): A multiplet for two protons. Maybe next to a branching point or near another substituent.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): A triplet of 3H as a doublet—so that's likely a CH2 group attached to something, but wait, a doublet with 3H would imply it's a CH2CH3 group, where the CH2 is attached to something else. Wait, no: a doublet for 3H would be a CH2CH3, but in this case, it's a triplet? Wait, the data says 1.4 ppm (d, 3H). Oh, a doublet with 3H. That suggests a CH2CH3 group attached to a CH. So like -CH(CH2CH3)- ?

Wait, perhaps it's an isopropyl group. Or maybe a branching with a methyl group attached. Let me think: for example, if there's a CH group attached to a CH(CH2CH3), but I'm not sure yet.

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): A triplet integrating for 3H, probably a terminal CH2CH2CH3 group. So a methyl group at the end of a chain, like CH2CH2CH2CH3, but wait, 0.9 ppm and triplet—so maybe a CH2CH2CH3 group, like in an ethyl group. Wait, but the triplet would come from coupling with two adjacent protons. Wait, no, a triplet would usually come from a CH2 group next to a CH3. For example, in a CH2CH3 group, the CH2 would show a quartet (split by the CH3), and the CH3 would be a triplet. But here, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet for 3H, which would fit a CH2CH3 group. So perhaps a longer chain, like a propyl group.

Wait, but the 1.4 ppm is a doublet with 3H. So perhaps it's a CH(CH2CH3) group. So for example, the structure could have a CH group connected to a CH(CH2CH3) and another CH2 group.

Putting this all together, the NMR suggests a para-substituted benzene ring with substituents that include a CH group, and possibly a longer chain, perhaps a butyl group or something similar.

Wait, let's think about the possible structures. The IR suggested a carbonyl group, so perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a carbonyl-containing group, like a ketone, ester, or acid.

But if the IR has a strong peak at 1720 cm-1, that's a carbonyl. So the substituent is likely a carbonyl group attached to the benzene.

Wait, but the NMR doesn't show any peaks around 2.1 ppm (which would be typical for a ketone or an aldehyde). Hmm. Let me think again.

The 10.5 ppm peak is a broad singlet, which could be an aldehyde proton. But aldehydes typically have a strong, sharp peak around 9.5-10 ppm. So maybe it's an aldehyde. Alternatively, if it's a carboxylic acid, the proton is a broad peak, but usually around 10-12 ppm. So 10.5 is possible for either.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe it's a vinyl group or something else, but I think that's less likely.

Let me consider the options given. The options are A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. Structure would be a benzene ring with ethyl group in the para position (since 4-ethyl would be para), and a propanoic acid group attached at position 2. Wait, but propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the benzene would have substituents at positions 2 and 4.

But in the NMR, the aromatic protons are at 8.0 and 7.2, each as doublets. That would suggest a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, which would have two sets of two equivalent protons each. So in that case, substituents at positions 1 and 4 would lead to a pattern where the aromatic protons are in two doublets. Alternatively, substituents at positions 2 and 4 would also lead to similar splitting.

Wait, but looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would be a benzene ring with a -COOH group in position 4 (para) and a sec-butyl group in another position. Wait, but where? If the benzoic acid is at position 4, then the substituent would be at position 1, making it 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene would have substituents at 1 and 4 positions. But wait, that's not possible because benzene is a ring, so position 1 and 4 are the same as positions 4 and 1, which are across from each other. So if the benzoic acid is at position 4, and the substituent is at position 1, that's the same as position 4 and position 1 being across from each other, but that's the same as being para.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think: Benzoic acid is at position 4, and the substituent is at position 1, but that's just another way of saying the same as positions 4 and 1 being the same as 4 and 4 if it's the same substituent. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are on adjacent carbons. But the NMR suggests a para-substituted pattern. So let's consider each option.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the benzene has a COOH group at position 4 and a sec-butyl group at position 4? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the substituents are at positions 1 and 4. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are at positions 2 and 4. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's think about the NMR again. In the aromatic region, two doublets each integrating for two protons. In a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, you would have four equivalent protons, but that's not the case here. Wait, no. Let me think: if you have substituents in the para positions on a benzene ring, then the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons, each as doublets. For example, if substituents are at positions 1 and 3, that's meta, but that's not the case here. So maybe it's 1,4 positions.

Wait, for a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, each substituent is at opposite ends. So the ring would have two sets of two protons each, each set as doublets.

So, looking at option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. That would have substituents at position 4 (the COOH group) and the sec-butyl group at another position. Wait, but the name is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which would imply that the benzoic acid is at position 1 and the sec-butyl is at position 4. Because in the IUPAC nomenclature, the numbering starts at the functional group. So benzoic acid is at position 1, and the substituent is at position 4.

Ah, that makes sense. So the benzene ring has a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. So the substituents are in para positions. That would explain why the aromatic protons are two doublets, each with 2H.

So in this case, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2 and 6 (if substituents are at 1 and 4). Those would be equivalent and as doublets. Then, the NMR shows two doublets, each 2H, which matches this scenario.

Now, looking at the NMR of the non-aromatic protons:

At 10.5 ppm, the broad singlet is the COOH proton. So that matches.

The other peaks: 

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Maybe the CH group adjacent to the carbonyl.

Wait, the structure is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached at position 4. The structure would be:

COOH is at position 1, and the substituent at position 4 is a -CH2-C(CH2CH3)2 group? Wait, no: sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3) ?, no. Wait, no. Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no. Let me think: Butyl groups are four carbons. The sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- ?

Wait, no. Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)- but that's not correct. Wait, wait, butyl groups: the four carbons. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2- but that's not right. Wait, no. Let me get this right.

The structure of a sec-butyl group is: the butyl chain is CH2CH2CH2CH3, but the substituent is attached to the second carbon. So, the sec-butyl group is: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think: The butyl group has four carbons. The substituent is attached to the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that's only three carbons. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but let's try: the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-? No, that doesn't add up. Wait, perhaps it's -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-? No, wait, but that's a longer chain. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group attached in a way that the branching is on the second carbon. So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, but that would be a propyl group attached to another CH2, making it a longer chain. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a tert-butyl group, but the option says sec-butyl. So, let me think: the structure is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So, the substituent would be attached to the benzene ring as a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So the NMR would show peaks for the CH2 and the CH(CH2CH3) groups.

Looking at the NMR:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): Could this be the CH group in the sec-butyl group? The CH in the middle, which is attached to two CH2 groups and the benzene. That would be a CH group, which as a multiplet due to coupling with adjacent protons.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Could these be the two CH2 groups adjacent to the CH in the sec-butyl group. So, the two CH2 groups would each have two protons, but their chemical shifts might be around 1.7 ppm.

Wait, but the 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) would be the methyl group attached to the CH in the sec-butyl. So, the CH is connected to a CH2CH3 group. So, the structure would be:

Benzene ring with COOH at 1 and a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3) group at position 4.

Wait, but the NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm for 3H, which would be the terminal CH2 of the ethyl group. So, let's see: the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene. Then, the ethyl group (CH2CH3) would have its CH2 attached to the CH, and the terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm as a triplet.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 0.9 ppm is a triplet (t), which suggests it's a -CH2CH2CH3 group. Wait, but in the substituent, the ethyl group is CH2CH3, which would be a triplet for the CH3. So that matches.

So, putting it all together, the substituent is a sec-butyl group: -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So, the substituent is attached to the benzene ring. The structure would be:

COOH attached at position 1, and the substituent (sec-butyl) at position 4.

So, the NMR would show:

- The aromatic protons in two doublets at 8.0 and 7.2 ppm, each integrating for two protons. So that's consistent.

The sec-butyl group: the CH2 adjacent to the ring would be at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) for the CH group. Then, the next CH2 group would be at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H). The terminal CH3 would be at 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). Additionally, the methyl group (CH2CH3) attached to the CH would be at 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), which is a doublet.

Wait, but in the substituent structure, the CH2 next to the benzene is attached to the CH, which is connected to another CH2CH3. So, the CH2 next to the ring (the first CH2 in the substituent) would be a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. So, the protons on that CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH, which has one proton. So each of these protons would be a quartet, but in the NMR, they are a multiplet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with more branching.

Wait, another thought: Let's think about the substituent as a (sec-butyl) group. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. So, the CH2 is attached to the ring, then a CH, then a CH2CH3.

So, the CH2 attached to the ring would be a -CH2- group, which would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH. Each of these two protons would be a quartet (n+1, where n=3 protons from the adjacent CH?), but perhaps more splitting.

Wait, perhaps the -CH2- group is next to a CH that has two adjacent protons. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact splitting.

But looking at the NMR data:

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): This is the CH group in the middle of the substituent, which is connected to two CH2 groups. So, each of the two CH2 groups would have their own protons, which would be split into multiplets.

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): Perhaps the two protons on the CH2 group adjacent to the CH. So, each of these would be adjacent to the CH group, which has one proton. So, they'd be split into doublets of doublets, but in the NMR, it's a multiplet.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): The methyl group attached to the CH. So, the CH is connected to a CH2CH3 group. The methyl group would be a triplet if it's attached to a CH2, but in this case, it's a CH2 attached to a CH, which is attached to the ring. So, the methyl group's protons would be split by the adjacent CH2. Wait, no, the CH2CH3 group is at the end, so the methyl group would be a triplet due to coupling with the adjacent CH2. But in the NMR, it's a doublet. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a tertiary group. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a butyl group with different branching. But I'm not entirely sure. Perhaps I should proceed with the analysis.

So, the NMR seems to support that the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring along with a COOH group in the para position.

Now, looking back at the reaction: Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. I think that when a vicinal dihalide reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it can undergo dehydrohalogenation twice to form an alkyne. Alternatively, if it's a dihalide but not vicinal, perhaps it forms an alkene. Wait, I'm a bit confused on the exact conditions.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus in HI is used for the dehydrohalogenation of 1,2-dihalides to form alkenes. But if the dihalide is 1,2-dibromide, for example, treatment with HI and red phosphorus would eliminate to form an alkene. So, perhaps Compound X is a dihalide that upon elimination forms an alkyne or an alkene.

Wait, but if the starting material is a dihalide, and the product is an alkyne, then elimination would involve losing two equivalents of HX. Alternatively, perhaps the compound has a geminal dihalide, but I'm not sure.

But wait, in this case, the product options don't have any alkenes or alkynes; they're all substituted benzene rings. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the reaction is not elimination but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzyl halide, and the reaction is a substitution.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI are more commonly involved in elimination reactions, especially when dihalides are present. Alternatively, maybe it's a case of converting a benzyl halide to a benzylidene group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the leaving group (like a bromide) is replaced by a hydrogen. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne. So if Compound X is a 1,2-dihaloalkane attached to a benzene ring, treatment with red phosphorus and HI would eliminate two equivalents of HX to form an alkyne.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an alkyl halide, and the reaction forms an alkene.

Hmm, but looking at the options, they all have substituents on the benzene ring without any alkenes or alkynes. So perhaps the reaction doesn't form a new pi bond but instead removes some groups.

Wait, another possibility: The reaction could be a Clemmensen reduction, but that's for ketones to alkanes, using Zn(Hg)/HCl and heat. Not sure if that's relevant here.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis. For example, a nitrile would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid, but that's with H2O and acid or base. Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester hydrolysis, but the reagents don't seem right for that.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzyl bromide or something similar. If Compound X is a benzyl bromide, reacting with red phosphorus and HI could abstract a proton and eliminate HBr, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the halogen is replaced by an isopropyl or another group. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should think about the product. The options are all substituted benzene rings. So, perhaps the reaction removes a group from the starting material, or perhaps adds a group.

But let's think about the reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydroiodic acid method, which can cause dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides to form alkenes. So, if the starting material is a dihalide, the product would be an alkene.

But the options don't have any alkenes. They all have substituents on the benzene ring. So perhaps the dihalide is attached to the benzene ring, and elimination forms a triple bond, making a benzene ring with an alkyne substituent.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have an alkyne. So that can't be the case.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzyl halide and the reaction forms a hydrogenated product. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't an elimination but a substitution. For example, if the starting material has a bromide adjacent to a carbonyl group, the substitution could form something else. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzene ring with a substituent that has a bromide and a carbonyl group, and the reaction removes the bromide, perhaps leading to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. So, if the starting material has two adjacent bromides, like Br-CH2-CH2-CO-X, then treatment would eliminate HBr to form a double bond. But again, the options don't have alkenes.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation of a dihalide to form an alkene. For example, if the starting material is 1,2-dibromoethyl benzene, the elimination would form styrene. But again, the options don't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced. For example, if the starting material has a bromide attached to a carbon next to a carbonyl group, the substitution could form a ketone.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let's go back. The starting material, Compound X, has an IR and NMR that suggests a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group (like a carboxylic acid). Then, when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of a carbon-halogen bond. For example, if the substituent on the benzene is a benzoyl bromide, reacting with HI might form a benzoyl iodide, but that doesn't seem relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester, and the reaction converts it to a carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure about the reagents for that.

Wait, another thought: Red phosphorus and HI are used in the formation of alkenes from vicinal dihalides. So, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a dihalide group, and the reaction forms an alkyne.

Wait, but the options don't show any alkynes, so I'm stuck again.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a bromo group attached to a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl group. So, treating with HI might cause a nucleophilic substitution, replacing the bromide with iodide, but that doesn't change the structure much.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to summarize what I have so far.

Compound X has a para-substituted benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group (like a carboxylic acid). The substituent also has a longer chain, possibly a butyl group. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI leads to some transformation. The options are all substituted benzene rings, suggesting that perhaps the reaction doesn't add or remove any substituents but maybe modifies a functional group.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a reduction. Red phosphorus can act as a reducing agent. For example, reducing a carbonyl group. But that would require specific conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehalogenation, removing a halogen from a substituent.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about each option again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If the starting material is this compound, then what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI? Well, benzoic acid doesn't have any halogens, so maybe the reaction isn't applicable. Unless the starting material has a bromide or iodide attached elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzoyl bromide, like benzoyl chloride. Then, reaction with HI would substitute Cl with I, but that doesn't seem to fit the options either.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should think differently. Let's think about the reaction of each option with red phosphorus and HI, and see which one fits.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So the substituent is a propanoic acid attached to the benzene ring. If Compound X is this, then reacting with red phosphorus and HI—what would happen? Well, propanoic acid doesn't have any halogens, so I'm not sure. Unless the starting material has a bromide elsewhere, but I don't see any in the structure.

Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene. So benzene with isobutyl and methyl groups in para positions. No carbonyl group. The IR data of Compound X showed a carbonyl, so this option might not fit.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. This has a COOH group in para position to a sec-butyl group. So the structure includes a carbonyl. Reacting this with red phosphorus and HI—what would happen? Well, benzoic acid doesn't have any leaving groups, so perhaps no reaction would occur. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a bromide that I'm not considering.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a different compound. Let me think about the reaction again.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation of a vicinal dihalide attached to the benzene ring, leading to the formation of an alkyne. So, if the starting material is a 1,2-dibromoethyl group attached to the benzene, elimination would form a triple bond, giving a propargyl benzene.

But the options don't show any triple bonds. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms an alkene, but again, none of the options have that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but something else. Maybe the starting material has an ester group, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to a carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a bromide is replaced by an iodide. But that doesn't change the structure much, and the options don't reflect that.

Another angle: Let me think about the starting material's structure. The NMR suggests a carboxylic acid (10.5 ppm, broad singlet). So the structure likely has a -COOH group attached to the benzene ring. The substituent is a sec-butyl group, as we discussed earlier.

So, the starting material is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Now, when this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, what happens?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a reduction. Red phosphorus can reduce carbonyl groups. But benzoic acid's carbonyl is a strong acid, so I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but without a leaving group, I don't see how.

Wait, perhaps the starting material isn't a carboxylic acid. Let me reevaluate the IR and NMR.

The IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be a ketone (around 1715 cm-1), an ester (around 1735 cm-1), or a carboxylic acid (1700-1725 cm-1). The NMR has a broad peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid than a ketone or ester.

So, the substituent is probably a carboxylic acid group.

But then, what reaction would a carboxylic acid undergo with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting material isn't a carboxylic acid but an ester. So, the 1720 cm-1 would be an ester, and the broad peak in the IR would be an O-H from an alcohol or an acid. But if it's an ester, the O-H wouldn't be present. Hmm, conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from an alcohol, but then the 1720 would be a carbonyl from an ester or ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a phenyl ester, like a methyl benzoate. Then, the IR would show the ester carbonyl at ~1720 cm-1, and maybe an O-H from an alcohol elsewhere, but I don't see that in the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzaldehyde, but the IR would show a strong C=O around 1700 cm-1, and the NMR would have a peak around 9-10 ppm for the aldehyde proton, which could fit the 10.5 ppm peak. But then, the substituent would be an aldehyde group.

But in that case, the NMR aromatic peaks would be different, maybe more downfield due to the aldehyde's electron-withdrawing effect.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible reaction again. Red phosphorus and HI are used for dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides to form alkenes. So, perhaps the starting material is a dihalide with a substituent on the benzene.

So, if the substituent is a dihalide, like CH2BrCH2Br, attached to the benzene ring, the reaction would eliminate two HBr molecules to form a triple bond, giving a propargyl benzene.

But looking at the options, none of them are alkyne-containing. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a bromide adjacent to a carbonyl group. For example, a benzoyl bromide. Then, reacting with HI might substitute the bromide with iodide, but that doesn't change the structure much.

Hmm. I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to approach this differently. Let's consider each option and think about what reaction would lead to it from Compound X.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if this is the product, what reaction would form it? If the starting material is a benzoyl bromide (Br-CO-Bz), then perhaps treatment with HI would substitute Br with I, but that's not relevant.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzene ring with a bromide and a carbonyl group, and the reaction removes the bromide. For example, if the substituent is a bromoalkane, elimination might form an alkene. But again, the options don't show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, but I don't think red phosphorus and HI are used for that.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a benzyl bromide attached to a carbonyl group, and the reaction substitutes the bromide with an iodide. But again, the options don't reflect that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a carbonyl group to a CH2 group. For example, using red phosphorus and HI might reduce a ketone to an alcohol, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: The reaction could be a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that typically uses peracids and isn't relevant here.

Hmm, I'm really not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about what the reaction does to the substituent.

Red phosphorus and HI are used for dehydrohalogenation. So, if the substituent has two adjacent halogens, like a 1,2-dibromide, the reaction will eliminate HBr to form a double bond. So, the substituent would become an alkene.

But looking at the options, none of them have an alkene. So perhaps the substituent after reaction isn't an alkene but something else.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a dihalide attached to a benzene ring, and elimination forms a triple bond, making a propargyl benzene. But again, none of the options show that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent has a bromide and a carbonyl group, and the elimination forms a ketone. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: Let's think about the possible structure of Compound X. From the NMR, it has a benzene ring, a carboxylic acid (from the 10.5 ppm peak), and a substituent with a butyl group.

So, perhaps Compound X is 4-bromobenzoic acid. Then, reacting with red phosphorus and HI would substitute the bromide with iodide, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, but the substituent is a butyl group, not a bromide. So, perhaps the substituent is a bromide attached to a butyl group.

Wait, for example, the substituent could be CH2CH2BrCH2CH3. Then, treating with red phosphorus and HI would eliminate HBr, forming an alkene. So, the substituent would become CH2=CHCH2CH3.

But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a dihalide, like CH2BrCHBrCH2CH3, which upon elimination would form an alkyne, CH≡CCH2CH3.

Again, none of the options show that.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, and the ring also has a COOH group. The substituents are in para positions.

If the reaction is between Compound X and red phosphorus/HI, what would lead to this product?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a dihalide, and the reaction forms the acid. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzoyl chloride with a bromide substituent, and the reaction replaces the bromide with something else, but I don't see that in the options.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of an ester to form a carboxylic acid. If the starting material is an ester with a substituent that becomes a sec-butyl group after hydrolysis, then the product would be option C.

But I'm not sure if red phosphorus and HI are used for ester hydrolysis. Typically, esters are hydrolyzed with acid or base, not with HI and red phosphorus.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a bromide in the substituent is replaced by a hydrogen, leading to a longer chain. But I'm not certain.

Another approach: Let's think about the reaction conditions and the product options. The product options are all substituted benzene rings without any alkenes or alkynes. So the reaction doesn't form any new pi bonds but perhaps modifies substituents.

If the starting material has a bromide in the substituent, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI might eliminate HBr, leading to a longer chain or a branching.

Wait, for example, if the substituent is a 2-bromo-2-methylpropane (tert-butyl bromide), treatment with red phosphorus and HI might eliminate HBr, forming an alkyne. But that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 1-bromo-2-methylpropane, which upon elimination would form an alkene.

But again, the options don't show any alkenes or alkynes.

At this point, I'm not making much progress. Let me try to think about what the product would be.

The correct answer is likely option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Because the NMR and IR data suggest a benzene ring with a carboxylic acid and a sec-butyl group in the para position.

As for the reaction, perhaps the starting material is a bromo-substituted compound, and the reaction replaces the bromide with a hydrogen, leading to the formation of the acid.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a bromide is replaced by something else, but I'm not seeing how that leads to option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a benzyl bromide attached to a carbonyl group, and the reaction forms the acid.

Hmm. Another thought: Maybe the starting material is a benzoyl bromide, and the reaction with HI replaces the bromide with iodide, but that doesn't lead to a carboxylic acid.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis of an acid chloride to a carboxylic acid, but again, that's typically done with water or base, not HI and red phosphorus.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of a carbonyl group to a CH2 group, but that would require different conditions.

Wait, given that I'm stuck, I think I should make an educated guess. The data points towards option C as the structure of Compound X. But the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI, so perhaps the product is an elimination product.

Wait, but the options don't have any elimination products. So I'm likely missing something.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the substituents on the benzene ring but does something else. For example, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation of a dihalide attached to a side chain, leading to an alkyne. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the bromide in the substituent is replaced by iodide, but that doesn't change the structure much.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of a carbon-bromine bond, leading to a shorter chain.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but that requires AlCl3 as a catalyst, not red phosphorus and HI.

I'm really not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a choice. Based on the NMR and IR data, Compound X is likely 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. When this reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps nothing happens, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the bromide in the substituent is replaced by iodide, but that's not reflected in the options.

Wait, another thought: Maybe Compound X is a benzoyl bromide with a substituent, and the reaction replaces the bromide with iodide, but that doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a reduction of the carbonyl group to a CH2 group, turning the benzoic acid into benzyl alcohol. But that would require a different reagent.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. But if the starting material has a ketone, the product would be an alkane. But our options don't have that.

Another Idea:

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid. But that requires different conditions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a bromide in the substituent, and the reaction replaces it with a hydrogen, leading to a shorter chain.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere. Given that, I'll have to go with option C as the structure of Compound X, and perhaps the reaction doesn't change it, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the question is about the product after reaction, so the product would be one of the options. So perhaps the reaction doesn't involve the substituents but does something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a bromide in the substituent is replaced by an iodide, but that doesn't change the structure much.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to a double bond in the substituent. So, for example, if the substituent is a 1-bromo-2-methylpropane (isobutyl bromide), the reaction would eliminate HBr, forming an alkene, which would make the substituent an isobutylene group. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a 2-bromo-2-methylpropane (tert-butyl bromide), which upon elimination would form an alkyne, but again, the options don't show that.

Given that, I'm going to make a guess that the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of an acid from an ester, but I'm not sure.


The question involves identifying the final product when Compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the IR and NMR data of Compound X to deduce its structure. The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (broad, likely an O-H stretch of a carboxylic acid), 1720 cm⁻¹ (carbonyl group, likely a carboxylic acid or ester), 1610 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C stretch), and 1450 cm⁻¹ (possibly C-O stretch). The NMR data includes peaks at 10.5 ppm (broad singlet, likely a carboxylic acid proton), 8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm (doublets, 2H each, indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring), and additional peaks at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), and 0.9 ppm (t, 3H), suggesting a sec-butyl group.

From this analysis, Compound X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**, a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4. The reaction with red phosphorus and HI is typically associated with dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides to form alkenes or alkynes. However, none of the options involve alkenes or alkynes, suggesting that the reaction does not alter the aromatic ring or its substituents but may instead modify a functional group.

Given the structure of Compound X and the reaction conditions, the most plausible conclusion is that the reaction does not significantly change the structure of the compound. Therefore, the final product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

Answer: C
