Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question says there are two planets orbiting a star. The star's mass is 1.5 times that of the Sun, radius 1.2 times, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The planets are Planet1 and Planet2. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which I think is important because albedo affects how much light they reflect and thus their temperature.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, considering the energy it absorbs and emits. The formula I remember is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), where a is the planet's orbital distance.

But wait, the problem doesn't give me the orbital distances. Oh wait, but maybe I can find that from the data given about the Doppler shifts.

The planets were detected using transit and radial velocity methods. The RV method gives the mass of the planet, which we have. The transit method gives the radius. But how does that help with the orbital distance?

Wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The shift depends on the planet's mass and the distance between the planet and the star. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1 + M_planet/M_star ) )^(2/3) ) ) ). But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term goes away. Also, since the planets are much less massive than the star (M_planet << M_star), we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So for each planet, K is proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(1/3) * a^(1/3) ). Hmm, but wait, perhaps the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The RV semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star induced by the planet. 

But wait, the question gives the maximum Doppler shift as a wavelength shift. The forbidden line [OI] is at 6300 Å, and the shifts are 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. So the Doppler shift tells us about the velocity of the star.

The Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity of the star towards or away from us. Since the orbit is circular, the maximum velocity would correspond to when the planet is moving directly towards or away, so v = K.

So for Planet1: delta_lambda1 = 0.03 Å, lambda = 6300 Å → v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c. Similarly for Planet2: v2 = (0.04 /6300) * c.

But I'm more interested in the relationship between the velocities. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (a)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * [some other factors?]

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the formula for K:

K = ( ( (G * M_planet * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (a (1 - e²) )^(1/2) ) )

Wait, no, perhaps a more precise formula. From what I recall, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) ) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (a)) ) * (1/sqrt(1 - e²)) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_*, we can ignore M_p in M_* + M_p. Also, e is zero for circular orbits. So simplifying, K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) * a^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / a )^(1/3) )? Wait, maybe I should look for a better way.

Alternatively, the formula I think is:

K = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (a * (1 - e²)^(0.5)) ) ) * ( sin i / (1 + M_p/M_* )^(2/3) ) )

But for small M_p, M_* >> M_p, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and 1 + M_p/M_* ≈1. Moreover, e=0, so (1-e²)=1. So K ≈ (G M_p )/(M_* )^(1/3) a^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/a )^(1/3) )? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G ) / (4 * c^3 * P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But what do I know? For each planet, I can relate K to the orbital period and the planet's mass.

Wait, but I don't have the periods. Hmm, perhaps I can find the ratio of the velocities v1 and v2 from the Doppler shifts, and then relate that to the ratio of their semi-major axes.

The Doppler shift gives the velocity of the star, which is K. So:

v1 = (0.03 Å) / (6300 Å) * c = (0.03/6300) * c

Similarly,

v2 = (0.04 /6300) * c

So v2 / v1 = (0.04/6300) / (0.03/6300) ) = 0.04/0.03 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333.

But what's v related to? The radial velocity semi-amplitude K. So K is proportional to v.

But K is also inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, let's think about the formula.

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p) / (M_*^2 * a ) )^(1/3) * (something else?)

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period and semi-major axis.

Kepler's third law (in astronomical units) is P² = (4π²/G M_*) a³.

But perhaps more useful here is the version:

a^3 = (G M_*) P² / (4 π² )

But I'm stuck because I don't have P for either planet. Hmm.

Wait, but the RV method gives K in terms of the planet's mass and orbital distance. Since the problem gives me K1 and K2 (the velocity shifts), I can relate their velocities, which in turn relate to a1 and a2.

Wait, the formula for K is:

K = ( ( (27 π G ) / (4 c³) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ) * (1 / P )

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can write K for each planet and take the ratio.

K1 = ( (G M_p1 ) / ( (M_* + M_p1)^(1/3) a1^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) / a1^(1/3) ?

Wait, perhaps I should find the formula for K in terms of M_p, M_*, and a.

I think the correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = (v) = ( ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( 1 / (a * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ) )

But again, since M_p << M_*, and e=0, this simplifies to:

K = ( (G M_p ) / M_* )^(1/3) * (1/(a^(1/3) )) )

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. Let's rearrange for a.

From the RV method, K is given by:

K = ( ( (G (M_p) ) / ( (M_* ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (a^(1/3) )) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_* )^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate (1 + M_p/M_*) ≈ 1. So,

K ≈ ( (G M_p / M_* )^(1/3) ) / a^(1/3) )

Which can be rewritten as:

K = ( ( G M_p ) / ( M_* a ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( ( M_* )^(1/3) ) ) )

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's take the ratio of the two K's.

K1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / a1) / ( M_p2 / a2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Because K is proportional to (M_p / a )^(1/3) according to that formula. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / ( a^(1/3) * (M_*)^(2/3) ) )

But since both planets are around the same star, M_* is the same for both. So,

K1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / a1^(1/3) ) / ( M_p2 / a2^(1/3) ) ]

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( a2 / a1 )^(1/3 )

But from the Doppler shifts, K1 corresponds to a shift of 0.03 Å, K2 to 0.04 Å. So K1=0.03, K2=0.04. Hence, K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So,

0.75 = ( (7/5) ) * ( a2 / a1 )^(1/3 )

Because M_p1 =7 Earth masses, M_p2=5 Earth masses.

Wait, M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5. So M_p1 / M_p2 = 7/5 = 1.4.

So,

0.75 = 1.4 * (a2 / a1 )^(1/3 )

Divide both sides by 1.4:

0.75 / 1.4 ≈ 0.5357 = (a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

Cube both sides:

(0.5357)^3 ≈ 0.153 → a2/a1 ≈0.153.

Alternatively, a1/a2 ≈ 6.54.

Wait, wait, calculating 0.5357 cubed:

0.5^3 is 0.125; 0.5357^3 is a bit higher. Let me compute:

0.5357^3 = (0.5 + 0.0357)^3 ≈ 0.125 + 3*(0.5)^2 *0.0357 + 3*(0.5)*(0.0357)^2 + (0.0357)^3

= 0.125 + 3*(0.25)(0.0357) + 3*(0.5)(0.001275) + 0.000045.

≈ 0.125 + 0.026775 + 0.0019125 + 0.000045 ≈ 0.15373.

So a2/a1 = 0.15373 → a1/a2 = 1 / 0.15373 ≈ 6.513.

So the orbital distance of Planet1 is about 6.51 times that of Planet2.

Wait, but wait: a1 is the orbital radius of Planet1, and a2 is Planet2's. So Planet1 is much farther out than Planet2.

Now, for the equilibrium temperature, the formula is:

T_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

Since both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - albedo) term is the same, so when taking the ratio of T1 to T2, that term cancels.

So,

T1 / T2 = sqrt( R_star / (2 a1 ) ) / sqrt( R_star / (2 a2 ) ) )

Simplify: sqrt( (R_star/(2 a1 )) / (R_star/(2 a2 )) ) )

= sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because the R_star and 2 cancel out.

So,

T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 1 / sqrt( a1/a2 )

We found a1/a2 ≈6.513, so sqrt(a1/a2) is sqrt(6.513) ≈ 2.552.

So,

T1 / T2 ≈ 1 / 2.552 ≈ 0.392.

Wait, that's a ratio less than 1, meaning Planet1 is colder than Planet2.

But wait, let me double-check the formula. The equilibrium temperature is given by:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 D) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

Where D is the distance from the star. So for each planet, D is a1 and a2.

So the ratio is:

T1/T2 = [ sqrt(R/(2 a1)) ] / [ sqrt(R/(2 a2)) ] = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Which is the same as 1/sqrt(a1/a2).

Since a1 is larger, sqrt(a1/a2) is larger than 1, so the ratio is less than 1.

So T1 is about 0.392 times T2.

Wait, but that would mean Planet1's equilibrium temperature is about 0.39 times that of Planet2, which would make the ratio T1:T2 ≈ 0.39, but the options don't have that. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) ~0.98

B) ~1.30

C) ~0.53

D) ~1.05

Wait, so 0.39 isn't any of the options. Hmm. That suggests I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, let me double-check the steps.

First, the Doppler shifts: K1 is 0.03 Å, K2 is 0.04 Å. So K1/K2=0.75.

We used the RV formula to find the ratio of a's. I think that's where I might have gone wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used for K is incorrect. Another way: the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* )^(1/3) * (a)^(1/3) ) ) ) )^(1/3) ?

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the formula for K.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( ( (G M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* )^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_*)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(a^(1/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )

But since e=0 and M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / (M_*^(1/3) a^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps I've seen the formula K = ( (v) ) = ( (G M_p ) / (M_* a ) )^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the correct expression for K. Let me look for a better approach.

Alternative approach: use the fact that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass function, but perhaps it's better to use the formula for K in terms of the planet's orbital period and other parameters.

Wait, maybe instead of K, I can find the ratio of the velocities.

Wait, I know that the star's velocity is K = v. The orbital velocity of the planet is much higher, but the RV method measures the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit.

The star's velocity K is related to the planet's orbital velocity v_p. Since the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, the ratio of their velocities is inversely proportional to their masses.

So, v_* / v_p = M_p / M_*

But M_* is 1.5 solar masses, M_p is much smaller, so v_* is much smaller than v_p. But perhaps this isn't directly helpful.

Wait, but the orbital period P is the same for both the star and the planet. The planet's orbital period P is same as the star's period around the center of mass.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation between the orbital velocity and the semi-major axis.

Planet's orbital velocity v_p = 2π a / P.

But same for the star: v_* = 2π a_* / P, where a_* is the star's orbit around the center of mass.

Since M_* a_* = M_p a_p (from center of mass: M_* a_* = M_p a_p, and a = a_* +a_p).

So a_p = (M_* / M_p) a_*.

Thus, v_p = 2π a_p / P = 2π (M_* / M_p a_*) / P.

v_* = 2π a_* / P.

So v_p = (M_* / M_p) v_*.

But that's the planet's velocity. The star's velocity is v_*.

But back to the RV semi-amplitude K: K is the measured velocity of the star, which is v_*.

So, K1 = v_*1, K2 = v_*2.

But from the previous relation, v_p = (M_* / M_p) v_*, so for each planet,

v_p1 = (M_* / M_p1) K1,

v_p2 = (M_* / M_p2) K2.

But the orbital period P is the same for both the star and the planet.

The orbital period P can also be expressed via Kepler's third law:

P² = (4π² G (M_* + M_p) ) a³.

But since M_p << M_*, it's approximately P² = (4π² G M_*) a³.

So, for each planet,

P² ≈ (4π² G M_*) a1³ → for planet 1,

and P² ≈ (4π² G M_*) a2³ → for planet 2.

But since P is the same for both planets, this would imply that a1³ = a2³ → a1 = a2, which can't be right because they have different Doppler shifts. So that suggests that my initial assumption is wrong. Probably, each planet has a different period and distance, so each has their own Kepler's law.

Wait, that would make sense. Each planet has their own a and period. So, for each planet, I can write P1² = (4π² G M_*) a1³ / (M_* + M_p1), and same for P2. But M_p1 and M_p2 are much smaller than M_*, so P1² ≈ (4π² G M_*) a1³ / M_*, and similarly P2² ≈ (4π² G M_*) a2³ / M_*.

So, P1² = (4π² G M_*) a1³ / M_* → simplifies to P1² = (4π² G a1³ ) / M_*^{1/3}?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find the ratio a1/a2.

From Kepler's third law, P² ∝ a³ / M_*, since M_* is the same for both.

So, (P1/P2)^2 = (a1³/a2³) * (M_*2 / M_*1 )

But M_* is same, so (P1/P2)^2 = (a1/a2)^3.

But I don't know the periods P1 and P2. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe I can relate the periods to the RV semi-amplitudes.

The RV semi-amplitude K is related to the period P. The formula is:

K = (v) = ( (G M_p) / (M_* a ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(2/3) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) * (1/P )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can use the formula derived from combining Kepler's law and the RV formula.

Another approach: express a in terms of K, M_p, and M_*, then find the ratio a1/a2.

From the RV semi-amplitude equation, K is given by:

K = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_* a ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*)^(2/3) )) ) * ( 1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

Again, e=0, and M_p << M_*, so:

K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / (M_* a ) )^(1/3 )

Let me cube both sides:

K³ = (G M_p ) / ( M_* a )

Rearranging for a:

a = G M_p / ( M_* K³ )

So, a1 = ( G M_p1 ) / ( M_* K1³ )

a2 = ( G M_p2 ) / ( M_* K2³ )

So, a1/a2 = [ ( M_p1 K2³ ) ] / [ ( M_p2 K1³ ) ]

Because G and M_* are same for both.

So,

a1/a2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * ( K2 / K1 )³

Plugging in the numbers:

M_p1 =7, M_p2=5 → 7/5=1.4.

K1=0.03, K2=0.04 → K2/K1=4/3≈1.333.

(4/3)^3 = (64)/(27) ≈2.37.

So,

a1/a2 = 1.4 * 2.37 ≈3.318.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was around 6.5. So which is correct?

Wait, because I had a different approach earlier leading to a different result. Now, using a1 = (G M_p )/( M_* K³ ), which is a different approach.

So with this new calculation, a1/a2 is about 3.318, which is different from my earlier 6.5.

Hmm, so this suggests a1 is about 3.3 times a2.

So now, going back to the equilibrium temperature ratio.

T_eq = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

So, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because:

T1 / T2 = [ sqrt( R/(2a1) ) ] / [ sqrt( R/(2a2) ) ] = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So,

T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 1 / sqrt( a1/a2 )

From the new a1/a2=3.318, sqrt(3.318)= approx 1.821.

So T1/T2=1/1.821≈0.549.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which is close to 0.549.

So the ratio is approximately 0.55, which would correspond to option C.

But earlier, with the first approach, I got a different ratio. Which approach is correct?

I think the second approach is more accurate because it directly relates a to K, M_p, and M_*.

So why did I get a different ratio earlier? Because I messed up the formula for K and the relation between a, K, and M_p.

So the correct ratio is approximately 0.54, which is closest to option C) ~0.53.

So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T1/T2 is approximately 0.53, so the answer is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by analyzing the given data and applying relevant formulas.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Mass: \( M_* = 1.5 M_\odot \)
   - Radius: \( R_* = 1.2 R_\odot \)
   - Effective Temperature: \( T_* = 6300 \, \text{K} \)

2. **Planet Properties**:
   - Planet1: \( M_{p1} = 7 M_\oplus \), \( R_{p1} = 1.7 R_\oplus \)
   - Planet2: \( M_{p2} = 5 M_\oplus \), \( R_{p2} = 1.3 R_\oplus \)
   - Both planets have the same albedo.

3. **Radial Velocity (RV) Data**:
   - Planet1 induces a Doppler shift of \( \Delta \lambda_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å} \).
   - Planet2 induces a Doppler shift of \( \Delta \lambda_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å} \).

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Distances to RV Shifts
The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to the velocity of the star, which can be derived from the Doppler shift. Using the formula \( \Delta \lambda / \lambda = v / c \), the velocities of the star are:
\[
v_1 = \frac{\Delta \lambda_1}{\lambda} c = \frac{0.03}{6300} c, \quad v_2 = \frac{\Delta \lambda_2}{\lambda} c = \frac{0.04}{6300} c
\]
The ratio of the velocities is:
\[
\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{\Delta \lambda_1}{\Delta \lambda_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75
\]

From the RV formula, \( K \propto \frac{M_p}{a^{1/3}} \). Taking the ratio of \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \):
\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \cdot \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]
Substituting \( M_{p1} = 7 \, M_\oplus \), \( M_{p2} = 5 \, M_\oplus \), and \( K_1/K_2 = 0.75 \):
\[
0.75 = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]
Simplify:
\[
\left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^{1/3} = \frac{0.75}{1.4} \approx 0.5357
\]
Cubing both sides:
\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 0.1537 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{a_1}{a_2} \approx 6.52
\]

### Step 2: Equilibrium Temperature Ratio
The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:
\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_* \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2a}} \cdot \left(1 - \text{albedo}\right)^{1/4}
\]
Since both planets have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends only on their orbital distances:
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]
Substituting \( a_1/a_2 \approx 6.52 \):
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{6.52}} \approx \frac{1}{2.552} \approx 0.392
\]
This result is inconsistent with the provided options, indicating an error in the earlier approach.

### Step 3: Correcting the Orbital Distance Ratio
Using the correct relationship \( a \propto \frac{M_p}{K^3} \), the ratio of orbital distances is:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{M_{p1} \cdot K_2^3}{M_{p2} \cdot K_1^3}
\]
Substituting \( M_{p1} = 7 \, M_\oplus \), \( M_{p2} = 5 \, M_\oplus \), \( K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å} \), and \( K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å} \):
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \left(\frac{0.04}{0.03}\right)^3 = 1.4 \cdot \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^3 \approx 1.4 \cdot 2.37 \approx 3.32
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{3.32} \approx 0.301
\]

### Step 4: Recalculating the Temperature Ratio
Using the corrected orbital distance ratio:
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{0.301} \approx 0.549
\]
This matches closely with option **C) ~0.53**.

### Final Answer:
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately **0.53**.

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question says there are two planets orbiting a star. The star's mass is 1.5 times that of the Sun, radius 1.2 times, and an effective temperature of 6300 K. The planets are Planet1 and Planet2. Planet1 has 7 Earth masses and 1.7 Earth radii. Planet2 is 5 Earth masses and 1.3 Earth radii. Both have the same albedo, which I think is important because albedo affects how much light they reflect and thus their temperature.

The question is about the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, equilibrium temperature... right, that's the temperature a planet would have if it were in thermal equilibrium, considering the energy it absorbs and emits. The formula I remember is something like T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4) ), where a is the planet's orbital distance.

But wait, the problem doesn't give me the orbital distances. Oh wait, but maybe I can find that from the data given about the Doppler shifts.

The planets were detected using transit and radial velocity methods. The RV method gives the mass of the planet, which we have. The transit method gives the radius. But how does that help with the orbital distance?

Wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum. The shift depends on the planet's mass and the distance between the planet and the star. The formula for the radial velocity semi-amplitude is K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1/( (1 + M_planet/M_star ) )^(2/3) ) ) ). But since the orbits are circular, e=0, so that term goes away. Also, since the planets are much less massive than the star (M_planet << M_star), we can approximate M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star.

So for each planet, K is proportional to (M_planet) / (M_star^(1/3) * a^(1/3) ). Hmm, but wait, perhaps the Doppler shift relates to the velocity of the star. The RV semi-amplitude K is the maximum velocity of the star induced by the planet. 

But wait, the question gives the maximum Doppler shift as a wavelength shift. The forbidden line [OI] is at 6300 Å, and the shifts are 0.03 Å for Planet1 and 0.04 Å for Planet2. So the Doppler shift tells us about the velocity of the star.

The Doppler shift formula is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity of the star towards or away from us. Since the orbit is circular, the maximum velocity would correspond to when the planet is moving directly towards or away, so v = K.

So for Planet1: delta_lambda1 = 0.03 Å, lambda = 6300 Å → v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c. Similarly for Planet2: v2 = (0.04 /6300) * c.

But I'm more interested in the relationship between the velocities. The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (a)^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) * [some other factors?]

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the formula for K:

K = ( ( (G * M_planet * sin i) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (a (1 - e²) )^(1/2) ) )

Wait, no, perhaps a more precise formula. From what I recall, the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* )^(2/3) ) ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (a)) ) * (1/sqrt(1 - e²)) ) * (1/( (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(1/3) )

But since M_p << M_*, we can ignore M_p in M_* + M_p. Also, e is zero for circular orbits. So simplifying, K ≈ ( (G * M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) * a^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / a )^(1/3) )? Wait, maybe I should look for a better way.

Alternatively, the formula I think is:

K = ( ( (G * M_p ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (a * (1 - e²)^(0.5)) ) ) * ( sin i / (1 + M_p/M_* )^(2/3) ) )

But for small M_p, M_* >> M_p, so M_* + M_p ≈ M_*, and 1 + M_p/M_* ≈1. Moreover, e=0, so (1-e²)=1. So K ≈ (G M_p )/(M_* )^(1/3) a^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) * (1/a )^(1/3) )? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G ) / (4 * c^3 * P ) )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

But what do I know? For each planet, I can relate K to the orbital period and the planet's mass.

Wait, but I don't have the periods. Hmm, perhaps I can find the ratio of the velocities v1 and v2 from the Doppler shifts, and then relate that to the ratio of their semi-major axes.

The Doppler shift gives the velocity of the star, which is K. So:

v1 = (0.03 Å) / (6300 Å) * c = (0.03/6300) * c

Similarly,

v2 = (0.04 /6300) * c

So v2 / v1 = (0.04/6300) / (0.03/6300) ) = 0.04/0.03 = 4/3 ≈ 1.333.

But what's v related to? The radial velocity semi-amplitude K. So K is proportional to v.

But K is also inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, let's think about the formula.

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p) / (M_*^2 * a ) )^(1/3) * (something else?)

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period and semi-major axis.

Kepler's third law (in astronomical units) is P² = (4π²/G M_*) a³.

But perhaps more useful here is the version:

a^3 = (G M_*) P² / (4 π² )

But I'm stuck because I don't have P for either planet. Hmm.

Wait, but the RV method gives K in terms of the planet's mass and orbital distance. Since the problem gives me K1 and K2 (the velocity shifts), I can relate their velocities, which in turn relate to a1 and a2.

Wait, the formula for K is:

K = ( ( (27 π G ) / (4 c³) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ) * (1 / P )

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can write K for each planet and take the ratio.

K1 = ( (G M_p1 ) / ( (M_* + M_p1)^(1/3) a1^(1/3) ) ) )^(1/3) / a1^(1/3) ?

Wait, perhaps I should find the formula for K in terms of M_p, M_*, and a.

I think the correct formula for the RV semi-amplitude is:

K = (v) = ( ( (G * M_p * sin i) ) / ( (M_* + M_p) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( 1 / (a * (1 - e²)^(0.5) ) ) ) )

But again, since M_p << M_*, and e=0, this simplifies to:

K = ( (G M_p ) / M_* )^(1/3) * (1/(a^(1/3) )) )

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. Let's rearrange for a.

From the RV method, K is given by:

K = ( ( (G (M_p) ) / ( (M_* ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (a^(1/3) )) ) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_* )^(2/3) ) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_*, we can approximate (1 + M_p/M_*) ≈ 1. So,

K ≈ ( (G M_p / M_* )^(1/3) ) / a^(1/3) )

Which can be rewritten as:

K = ( ( G M_p ) / ( M_* a ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( ( M_* )^(1/3) ) ) )

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let's take the ratio of the two K's.

K1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / a1) / ( M_p2 / a2 ) ]^(1/3 )

Because K is proportional to (M_p / a )^(1/3) according to that formula. Wait, let me think again.

Wait, K is proportional to (M_p * sin i) / ( a^(1/3) * (M_*)^(2/3) ) )

But since both planets are around the same star, M_* is the same for both. So,

K1/K2 = [ (M_p1 / a1^(1/3) ) / ( M_p2 / a2^(1/3) ) ]

So,

K1/K2 = ( M_p1 / M_p2 ) * ( a2 / a1 )^(1/3 )

But from the Doppler shifts, K1 corresponds to a shift of 0.03 Å, K2 to 0.04 Å. So K1=0.03, K2=0.04. Hence, K1/K2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75.

So,

0.75 = ( (7/5) ) * ( a2 / a1 )^(1/3 )

Because M_p1 =7 Earth masses, M_p2=5 Earth masses.

Wait, M_p1 is 7 Earth masses, M_p2 is 5. So M_p1 / M_p2 = 7/5 = 1.4.

So,

0.75 = 1.4 * (a2 / a1 )^(1/3 )

Divide both sides by 1.4:

0.75 / 1.4 ≈ 0.5357 = (a2/a1 )^(1/3 )

Cube both sides:

(0.5357)^3 ≈ 0.153 → a2/a1 ≈0.153.

Alternatively, a1/a2 ≈ 6.54.

Wait, wait, calculating 0.5357 cubed:

0.5^3 is 0.125; 0.5357^3 is a bit higher. Let me compute:

0.5357^3 = (0.5 + 0.0357)^3 ≈ 0.125 + 3*(0.5)^2 *0.0357 + 3*(0.5)*(0.0357)^2 + (0.0357)^3

= 0.125 + 3*(0.25)(0.0357) + 3*(0.5)(0.001275) + 0.000045.

≈ 0.125 + 0.026775 + 0.0019125 + 0.000045 ≈ 0.15373.

So a2/a1 = 0.15373 → a1/a2 = 1 / 0.15373 ≈ 6.513.

So the orbital distance of Planet1 is about 6.51 times that of Planet2.

Wait, but wait: a1 is the orbital radius of Planet1, and a2 is Planet2's. So Planet1 is much farther out than Planet2.

Now, for the equilibrium temperature, the formula is:

T_planet = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

Since both planets have the same albedo, the (1 - albedo) term is the same, so when taking the ratio of T1 to T2, that term cancels.

So,

T1 / T2 = sqrt( R_star / (2 a1 ) ) / sqrt( R_star / (2 a2 ) ) )

Simplify: sqrt( (R_star/(2 a1 )) / (R_star/(2 a2 )) ) )

= sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because the R_star and 2 cancel out.

So,

T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 1 / sqrt( a1/a2 )

We found a1/a2 ≈6.513, so sqrt(a1/a2) is sqrt(6.513) ≈ 2.552.

So,

T1 / T2 ≈ 1 / 2.552 ≈ 0.392.

Wait, that's a ratio less than 1, meaning Planet1 is colder than Planet2.

But wait, let me double-check the formula. The equilibrium temperature is given by:

T_eq = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2 D) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

Where D is the distance from the star. So for each planet, D is a1 and a2.

So the ratio is:

T1/T2 = [ sqrt(R/(2 a1)) ] / [ sqrt(R/(2 a2)) ] = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Which is the same as 1/sqrt(a1/a2).

Since a1 is larger, sqrt(a1/a2) is larger than 1, so the ratio is less than 1.

So T1 is about 0.392 times T2.

Wait, but that would mean Planet1's equilibrium temperature is about 0.39 times that of Planet2, which would make the ratio T1:T2 ≈ 0.39, but the options don't have that. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) ~0.98

B) ~1.30

C) ~0.53

D) ~1.05

Wait, so 0.39 isn't any of the options. Hmm. That suggests I must have made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, let me double-check the steps.

First, the Doppler shifts: K1 is 0.03 Å, K2 is 0.04 Å. So K1/K2=0.75.

We used the RV formula to find the ratio of a's. I think that's where I might have gone wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used for K is incorrect. Another way: the semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_* )^(1/3) * (a)^(1/3) ) ) ) )^(1/3) ?

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the formula for K.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = ( ( (G M_p sin i ) / ( (M_* )^(1/3) (1 + M_p/M_*)^(2/3) ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1/(a^(1/3) (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) )

But since e=0 and M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / (M_*^(1/3) a^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps I've seen the formula K = ( (v) ) = ( (G M_p ) / (M_* a ) )^(1/3) * (1/(1 + M_p/M_* )^(1/3) )

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on the correct expression for K. Let me look for a better approach.

Alternative approach: use the fact that the RV semi-amplitude K is related to the mass function, but perhaps it's better to use the formula for K in terms of the planet's orbital period and other parameters.

Wait, maybe instead of K, I can find the ratio of the velocities.

Wait, I know that the star's velocity is K = v. The orbital velocity of the planet is much higher, but the RV method measures the star's velocity due to the planet's orbit.

The star's velocity K is related to the planet's orbital velocity v_p. Since the star and planet orbit their common center of mass, the ratio of their velocities is inversely proportional to their masses.

So, v_* / v_p = M_p / M_*

But M_* is 1.5 solar masses, M_p is much smaller, so v_* is much smaller than v_p. But perhaps this isn't directly helpful.

Wait, but the orbital period P is the same for both the star and the planet. The planet's orbital period P is same as the star's period around the center of mass.

But I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the relation between the orbital velocity and the semi-major axis.

Planet's orbital velocity v_p = 2π a / P.

But same for the star: v_* = 2π a_* / P, where a_* is the star's orbit around the center of mass.

Since M_* a_* = M_p a_p (from center of mass: M_* a_* = M_p a_p, and a = a_* +a_p).

So a_p = (M_* / M_p) a_*.

Thus, v_p = 2π a_p / P = 2π (M_* / M_p a_*) / P.

v_* = 2π a_* / P.

So v_p = (M_* / M_p) v_*.

But that's the planet's velocity. The star's velocity is v_*.

But back to the RV semi-amplitude K: K is the measured velocity of the star, which is v_*.

So, K1 = v_*1, K2 = v_*2.

But from the previous relation, v_p = (M_* / M_p) v_*, so for each planet,

v_p1 = (M_* / M_p1) K1,

v_p2 = (M_* / M_p2) K2.

But the orbital period P is the same for both the star and the planet.

The orbital period P can also be expressed via Kepler's third law:

P² = (4π² G (M_* + M_p) ) a³.

But since M_p << M_*, it's approximately P² = (4π² G M_*) a³.

So, for each planet,

P² ≈ (4π² G M_*) a1³ → for planet 1,

and P² ≈ (4π² G M_*) a2³ → for planet 2.

But since P is the same for both planets, this would imply that a1³ = a2³ → a1 = a2, which can't be right because they have different Doppler shifts. So that suggests that my initial assumption is wrong. Probably, each planet has a different period and distance, so each has their own Kepler's law.

Wait, that would make sense. Each planet has their own a and period. So, for each planet, I can write P1² = (4π² G M_*) a1³ / (M_* + M_p1), and same for P2. But M_p1 and M_p2 are much smaller than M_*, so P1² ≈ (4π² G M_*) a1³ / M_*, and similarly P2² ≈ (4π² G M_*) a2³ / M_*.

So, P1² = (4π² G M_*) a1³ / M_* → simplifies to P1² = (4π² G a1³ ) / M_*^{1/3}?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to find the ratio a1/a2.

From Kepler's third law, P² ∝ a³ / M_*, since M_* is the same for both.

So, (P1/P2)^2 = (a1³/a2³) * (M_*2 / M_*1 )

But M_* is same, so (P1/P2)^2 = (a1/a2)^3.

But I don't know the periods P1 and P2. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe I can relate the periods to the RV semi-amplitudes.

The RV semi-amplitude K is related to the period P. The formula is:

K = (v) = ( (G M_p) / (M_* a ) )^(1/3) * (1 / (1 + M_p/M_*) )^(2/3) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^(1/2) )) * (1/P )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I can use the formula derived from combining Kepler's law and the RV formula.

Another approach: express a in terms of K, M_p, and M_*, then find the ratio a1/a2.

From the RV semi-amplitude equation, K is given by:

K = ( (G M_p ) / ( (M_* a ) ) )^(1/3) * (1 / ( (1 + M_p/M_*)^(2/3) )) ) * ( 1 / ( (1 - e²)^(1/2) ) )

Again, e=0, and M_p << M_*, so:

K ≈ ( (G M_p ) / (M_* a ) )^(1/3 )

Let me cube both sides:

K³ = (G M_p ) / ( M_* a )

Rearranging for a:

a = G M_p / ( M_* K³ )

So, a1 = ( G M_p1 ) / ( M_* K1³ )

a2 = ( G M_p2 ) / ( M_* K2³ )

So, a1/a2 = [ ( M_p1 K2³ ) ] / [ ( M_p2 K1³ ) ]

Because G and M_* are same for both.

So,

a1/a2 = (M_p1 / M_p2) * ( K2 / K1 )³

Plugging in the numbers:

M_p1 =7, M_p2=5 → 7/5=1.4.

K1=0.03, K2=0.04 → K2/K1=4/3≈1.333.

(4/3)^3 = (64)/(27) ≈2.37.

So,

a1/a2 = 1.4 * 2.37 ≈3.318.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was around 6.5. So which is correct?

Wait, because I had a different approach earlier leading to a different result. Now, using a1 = (G M_p )/( M_* K³ ), which is a different approach.

So with this new calculation, a1/a2 is about 3.318, which is different from my earlier 6.5.

Hmm, so this suggests a1 is about 3.3 times a2.

So now, going back to the equilibrium temperature ratio.

T_eq = T_* * sqrt( R_* / (2 a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 )

So, the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because:

T1 / T2 = [ sqrt( R/(2a1) ) ] / [ sqrt( R/(2a2) ) ] = sqrt( (R/(2a1)) / (R/(2a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So,

T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 ) = 1 / sqrt( a1/a2 )

From the new a1/a2=3.318, sqrt(3.318)= approx 1.821.

So T1/T2=1/1.821≈0.549.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53, which is close to 0.549.

So the ratio is approximately 0.55, which would correspond to option C.

But earlier, with the first approach, I got a different ratio. Which approach is correct?

I think the second approach is more accurate because it directly relates a to K, M_p, and M_*.

So why did I get a different ratio earlier? Because I messed up the formula for K and the relation between a, K, and M_p.

So the correct ratio is approximately 0.54, which is closest to option C) ~0.53.

So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures T1/T2 is approximately 0.53, so the answer is option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start by analyzing the given data and applying relevant formulas.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Mass: \( M_* = 1.5 M_\odot \)
   - Radius: \( R_* = 1.2 R_\odot \)
   - Effective Temperature: \( T_* = 6300 \, \text{K} \)

2. **Planet Properties**:
   - Planet1: \( M_{p1} = 7 M_\oplus \), \( R_{p1} = 1.7 R_\oplus \)
   - Planet2: \( M_{p2} = 5 M_\oplus \), \( R_{p2} = 1.3 R_\oplus \)
   - Both planets have the same albedo.

3. **Radial Velocity (RV) Data**:
   - Planet1 induces a Doppler shift of \( \Delta \lambda_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å} \).
   - Planet2 induces a Doppler shift of \( \Delta \lambda_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å} \).

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Distances to RV Shifts
The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to the velocity of the star, which can be derived from the Doppler shift. Using the formula \( \Delta \lambda / \lambda = v / c \), the velocities of the star are:
\[
v_1 = \frac{\Delta \lambda_1}{\lambda} c = \frac{0.03}{6300} c, \quad v_2 = \frac{\Delta \lambda_2}{\lambda} c = \frac{0.04}{6300} c
\]
The ratio of the velocities is:
\[
\frac{v_1}{v_2} = \frac{\Delta \lambda_1}{\Delta \lambda_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75
\]

From the RV formula, \( K \propto \frac{M_p}{a^{1/3}} \). Taking the ratio of \( K_1 \) and \( K_2 \):
\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_{p1}}{M_{p2}} \cdot \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]
Substituting \( M_{p1} = 7 \, M_\oplus \), \( M_{p2} = 5 \, M_\oplus \), and \( K_1/K_2 = 0.75 \):
\[
0.75 = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^{1/3}
\]
Simplify:
\[
\left(\frac{a_2}{a_1}\right)^{1/3} = \frac{0.75}{1.4} \approx 0.5357
\]
Cubing both sides:
\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 0.1537 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{a_1}{a_2} \approx 6.52
\]

### Step 2: Equilibrium Temperature Ratio
The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:
\[
T_{\text{eq}} = T_* \cdot \sqrt{\frac{R_*}{2a}} \cdot \left(1 - \text{albedo}\right)^{1/4}
\]
Since both planets have the same albedo, the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures depends only on their orbital distances:
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]
Substituting \( a_1/a_2 \approx 6.52 \):
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{6.52}} \approx \frac{1}{2.552} \approx 0.392
\]
This result is inconsistent with the provided options, indicating an error in the earlier approach.

### Step 3: Correcting the Orbital Distance Ratio
Using the correct relationship \( a \propto \frac{M_p}{K^3} \), the ratio of orbital distances is:
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{M_{p1} \cdot K_2^3}{M_{p2} \cdot K_1^3}
\]
Substituting \( M_{p1} = 7 \, M_\oplus \), \( M_{p2} = 5 \, M_\oplus \), \( K_1 = 0.03 \, \text{Å} \), and \( K_2 = 0.04 \, \text{Å} \):
\[
\frac{a_1}{a_2} = \frac{7}{5} \cdot \left(\frac{0.04}{0.03}\right)^3 = 1.4 \cdot \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^3 \approx 1.4 \cdot 2.37 \approx 3.32
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx \frac{1}{3.32} \approx 0.301
\]

### Step 4: Recalculating the Temperature Ratio
Using the corrected orbital distance ratio:
\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \sqrt{0.301} \approx 0.549
\]
This matches closely with option **C) ~0.53**.

### Final Answer:
The ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately **0.53**.

ANSWER: C
