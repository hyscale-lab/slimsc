Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it through again.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). Then, the reaction was monitored with TLC, and it showed that the reactant spot had diminished, with two new spots appearing. The options are about the possible structures of the products.

Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, it usually leads to an addition reaction. But wait, the compound here is an ether, right? Because the structure is (something)oxybenzene, which means it's an aryl ether. So the group attached to oxygen is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl). Let me draw that structure in my mind.

The substituent is a butenyl group. Let me number the carbons. The main chain is four carbons long. The double bond is between C3 and C4 (since it's but-3-en-1-yl). So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond starting at position 3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, that can't be because that's but-1-ene. Wait, maybe I should think about the actual structure.

But-3-en-1-yl group: the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 where the double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait, that doesn't make sense because but has four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but that's but-1-en-1-yl? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the correct numbering. For but-3-en-1-yl, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So it's CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? But wait, that's impossible because but has four carbons. Oh wait, wait. Let me think again. The butenyl group is four carbons long. The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene.

So the butenyl group is CH2-CH(C)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond at position 3. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but where's the double bond?

Wait, no, the group is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, that would make it CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? But that's not possible because but has only four carbons. So the structure must be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 is four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond from C3 to C4? But there are only four carbons, so C1, C2, C3, C4. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that would be but-1-en-1-yl. Oh wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4, but that's not possible because for but, the longest chain has four carbons. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, or C2 and C3.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the group is:

O-benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2?

Wait, no, because if it's but-3-en-1-yl, the structure would be O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 where the double bond is between C3 and C4? That's impossible because but has four carbons. Oh, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but that's but-1-en-1-yl. I think I'm getting the positions wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2)2C(CH3)2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that would be CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but that doesn't have a double bond. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe it's better to draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, perhaps I should move on and think about the reaction.

Okay, so the molecule is an aryl ether, R-O-benzene, where R is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the ether is O-benzene connected to a butenyl group that has a double bond at position 3, and two methyl groups on carbon 2.

When HBr is added, what happens? HBr is a typical reagent for acid-catalyzed addition to alkenes. So the double bond in the butenyl group will undergo addition.

Wait, but in ethers, the adjacent groups can sometimes undergo different reactions. Wait, but in this case, the structure is an ether, so the O is connected to the butenyl group. So the reaction would be an addition of HBr to the double bond in the butenyl group.

Wait, but ethers are generally not very reactive towards HBr unless under specific conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more like an acid-catalyzed cleavage or some kind of electrophilic substitution.

Wait, but the molecule is O-benzene connected to a butenyl group, which has a double bond. So when HBr is added, it would add across the double bond in the butenyl group. So it's an alkyl bromide that's being formed.

But wait, let's think about the structure. The butenyl group is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl). So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but butenyl has four carbons, so positions 1-4.

Wait, perhaps the structure is: the double bond is between C2 and C3. Wait, but the substituent is called but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond from C3 to C4. Therefore, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 where the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, but that would mean the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's impossible because that's a four-carbon chain with the double bond between C3 and C4, which isn't possible. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a typo, but I'll have to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-benzene? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the butenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3, which would make it but-2-en-1-yl, but the question says but-3-en-1-yl.

Wait, maybe the substituent is:

The main chain is four carbons: positions 1,2,3,4.

But-3-en-1-yl: the double bond is between C3 and C4.

So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that's not possible because that's the same as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond on the third and fourth positions? Wait, but that's beyond the main chain. I think I'm getting stuck on this, but perhaps I should proceed.

So the reaction is between HBr and the double bond. So the HBr will add across the double bond. The addition of HBr to an alkene typically follows anti addition (for non-polar solvents) but in more polar solvents, maybe it's via a carbocation intermediate.

Wait, but the butenyl group is substituted with two methyl groups on the second carbon. So the structure of the substituent is probably CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4? But that can't be right because but has four carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but that doesn't include a double bond. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction.

When HBr adds to an alkene, the result is an alkyl bromide. So if the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, adding HBr across the double bond would lead to a bromide on the adjacent carbons.

So the possible products would be the diastereomers or different substitution products, but considering the structure of the substituent, perhaps the addition could occur in a way that leads to different regiochemistry or stereochemistry.

Wait, but the reaction is an acid-catalyzed addition. So the mechanism would involve the formation of a carbocation. Let me think: when HBr adds to an alkene with a strong acid catalyst, the H adds to the double bond, forming a carbocation, then the bromide ion attacks.

But in this case, the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is probably CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH2)2C(CH3)2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4. Hmm, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, 2,2-dimethyl means two methyl groups on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but that's but-2-en-1-yl. No, but the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is further along.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (CH2)2CH-C(CH3)2, but that's not making sense. I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps I should proceed.

Assuming that HBr adds to the double bond, the possible products would be the bromide formed from the addition. So the initial substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. After addition, the substituent would become (2,2-dimethylbutane-3-yl)oxy with a bromide.

Wait, but butane-3-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the bromine on the third carbon? Or perhaps the bromide would be on the adjacent carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent would become a bromoalkyl group. So the product would be (2,2-dimethylbutane-3-bromo-1-yl)oxybenzene.

Wait, but if the addition is HBr to the double bond, the substituent would have a bromine added. So the two possible products would be where the bromine adds to either end of the double bond.

Wait, but for an alkene, adding HBr can lead to two possible products if there's a possibility of different regiochemistry (like in case of allylic carbocation), but in this case, the substituent is highly branched. Let me think about the structure again.

The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that can't be because but only has four carbons. So perhaps the correct structure is:

It's (CH2)2C(CH3)2-CH2, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. No, because the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl.

Wait, maybe the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that leaves the substituent as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond at the end. But that would make it but-1-en-1-yl, but the question says but-3-en-1-yl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (CH(CH3)2)CH2-CH2, but with a double bond elsewhere. I think I'm getting stuck here, but perhaps I should think about the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option B: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene.

Wait, so one product is a brominated butoxy group, and the other is a more substituted double bond.

Option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

So these are two diastereomers or different bromination positions.

Option A: Two phenols. But that would imply hydrolysis of the ether, which is possible under acidic conditions, but the question is about adding HBr, which is a strong acid but I'm not sure if it would hydrolyze the ether. Alternatively, perhaps some elimination happened.

Option C: Two cyclic structures. Chromane and dihydrobenzofuran. Hmm, that suggests some kind of cyclization, but I'm not sure how that would happen with HBr addition.

Back to the reaction. HBr added to an alkene would lead to an alkyl bromide. So the initial substituent is an ether, and upon addition, the substituent becomes a brominated alkyl group.

But let's think about the structure. If the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy, then adding HBr across the double bond would produce a bromide on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, when HBr adds to a double bond, the H adds to one carbon and Br to the other. The more substituted carbocation is more stable, so the H adds to the less substituted end, making the more substituted carbocation.

In this substituent, the double bond is probably between C2 and C3, given the substituents.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but I'm not getting it right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2. No, but that's but-2-en-1-yl.

Wait, perhaps it's best to think that the substituent is something like CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere, but I'm not getting it right. Let me think about the reaction.

The addition of HBr to the double bond in the substituent would result in two possible products depending on where the Br adds.

So if the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl), the addition of HBr would form either a 3-bromo or 4-bromo product.

Wait, but if the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, adding HBr would make either 3-bromo or 4-bromo.

But since the substituent is 2,2-dimethyl, the structure is probably CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So adding HBr would give either 3-bromo or 4-bromo.

Wait, but in reality, the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the structure is:

O-benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2.

Wait, but that can't be because that doesn't include the double bond. So the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl), which would have a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that's four carbons, so the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, which can't be. So perhaps the substituent is actually CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2 but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-benzene.

Wait, that would make it a 3-enyl group. So the substituent is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-benzene.

In that case, adding HBr would lead to the formation of a bromide on either the first or second carbon of the substituent.

Wait, no, the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, so the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at position 3. Wait, that's impossible because with four carbons, the double bond can't start at 3. So perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I should think that the substituent is (CH2)2C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, but that's impossible. So perhaps the substituent is actually (CH2)2C(CH3)=CH2. Oh, wait, but that would be but-2-en-1-yl.

Wait, but the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the substituent would have four carbons, with the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4. But that doesn't add up because but has four carbons, and the double bond can't be between C3 and C4 because that would require a fifth carbon.

Ah, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to construct it step by step.

But-3-en-1-yl would have the structure CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4. But that's impossible because it's only four carbons. So perhaps the correct structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's just a four-carbon chain. Oh, wait, but the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, which would have a double bond starting at C3, which is the third carbon. So the substituent is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but that's the same as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, which doesn't have a double bond. This doesn't make sense. I think I'm stuck on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Because but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But how? Wait, maybe the correct structure is CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (CH2)2C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but that can't be.

I think I need to move forward, perhaps by considering the options. Let's look at option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

So these are two products where the bromine is on carbon 3 or 4 of the butoxy group. That suggests that the addition of HBr across the double bond could lead to either the 3-bromo or 4-bromo product.

Wait, but if the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, adding HBr could lead to either 3-bromo or 4-bromo.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in the substituent is between C2 and C3, making it but-2-en-1-yl. In that case, adding HBr would form either a 2-bromo or 3-bromo derivative.

But the question says the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, so maybe the addition leads to 3-bromo and 4-bromo.

Wait, but if the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, that can't be. So perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O-benzene, which would be but-1-en-1-yl, not 3-en-1-yl.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake in the structure. Let me think again. But-3-en-1-yl has the structure CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond starting at C3, but that's impossible because with four carbons, the double bond can only start at C1 or C2.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3, making it but-2-en-1-yl. But the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, so perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4, which is possible in a longer chain but not in a four-carbon chain.

I think I'm stuck on the structure, but perhaps the reaction leads to two products where the bromine is added to different positions. So looking at the options, option D has two products with bromine on 3 and 4 positions of the butoxy group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the formation of a bromide and an elimination product. For example, if the reaction leads to addition (main product) and some elimination (side product), but the question states that two new spots appeared, so perhaps two products are formed.

Wait, but the problem says the reaction was with HBr. HBr is typically for addition to alkenes, not elimination. So the main products would be the addition products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not addition but some kind of substitution. Wait, but ethers are generally not very reactive towards HBr unless the leaving group is good. But in this case, the substituent is an ether, so the oxygen is a good leaving group only under certain conditions, but HBr is more likely to add to the double bond.

So the initial product would be the addition of HBr to the double bond in the substituent, leading to a bromide.

So if the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy, adding HBr would form either (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene or (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, which are the two products in option D.

Wait, but let me think about the positions. When HBr adds to the double bond, the H adds to one carbon and Br to the adjacent. So the substituent has a methyl groups on C2. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-O-benzene, but that's but-2-en-1-yl. Hmm, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, but that can't be. So perhaps the substituent is actually CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-benzene.

In that case, adding HBr would result in Br adding to either the first or the second carbon of the substituent.

Wait, but if the double bond is between C1 and C2, then adding HBr would form either 1-bromo or 2-bromo derivatives.

But the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between C3 and C4, which isn't possible in a four-carbon chain. So perhaps I'm wrong about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (CH2)2C(CH3)2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3, making it but-2-en-1-yl.

In that case, adding HBr would form either 2-bromo or 3-bromo products.

Wait, but the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, so this might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but that's but-2-en-1-yl.

I think I'm not getting the structure right, but perhaps I should proceed to the options.

Looking again, option D has two products: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So the bromine is on the 3rd and 4th carbons of the butoxy group.

Wait, but when you add HBr to a double bond, the Br adds to one end, and the H adds to the other. So the major product would be where the Br is added to the more substituted carbon because that forms the more stable carbocation.

In this case, the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH(CH(CH3))-CH2, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, but again, that's impossible.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible products.

If the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl, then adding HBr would add Br to the more substituted carbon. So the double bond is between C3 and C4, but that's not possible in a four-carbon chain. So perhaps the substituent is actually (CH2)2C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, that would make the substituent CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Wait, no, because but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2, which is 2,2-dimethylbut-1-en-1-yl.

No, that's not right. I think I'm going in circles. Let me think about the options again.

Option B: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene.

So one product is a bromide, and the other is a different butenyl group. That suggests that the reaction may have involved some isomerization or rearrangement.

Option D: Two bromides at different positions.

Option D's products are 3-bromo and 4-bromo derivatives. So if the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl, adding HBr would give either 3-bromo or 4-bromo.

Wait, but let's imagine the substituent is (CH2)2C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4 (but that's not possible in four carbons). So perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH(CH(CH3))-CH2, but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=C(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-O-benzene, which would be 3-en-1-yl. Then adding HBr would add to the double bond, leading to 3-bromo and 2-bromo products.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. That doesn't make sense.

I think I'm stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is option D, where two bromides are formed on different positions. So the products are (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about acid-catalyzed cleavage, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy, which upon reaction with HBr could undergo acid-catalyzed cleavage to form a carbocation, leading to possible shifts.

If the double bond is between C3 and C4, then adding HBr would form a bromide on C3, but given the substituents, perhaps a hydride shift could occur to form a more stable carbocation.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is (CH2)2C(CH3)=CH2, which is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl.

In that case, adding HBr would form a bromide on either C2 or C3.

Wait, but the substituent is (CH2)2C(CH3)=CH2, so adding HBr would protonate the double bond, leading to the more stable carbocation.

The structure would have a double bond between C3 and C4: CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

Protonation would occur on the less substituted carbon (C4), leading to a carbocation on C3: CH2-CH2-C(CH3)+ -CH2.

Then Br- would attack from either side, but since it's symmetric, perhaps only one product forms. Hmm, but that doesn't explain two new spots.

Wait, but maybe the initial substituent can add HBr in two different ways due to the possibility of forming different carbocations.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is more like CH2=C(CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2-O-benzene.

Wait, but I'm not getting the structure right. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options.

Option B: One product is a bromide, the other is a different butenyl group. That suggests some isomerization or rearrangement. But I'm not sure.

Option D: Two bromides at different positions, which would happen if the addition occurs on either end of the double bond, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to some elimination, forming a different alkene, but that would require a base, which HBr isn't.

Wait, but in an acid-catalyzed addition, the bromide could attack from either side, leading to possible diastereomers, but I'm not sure if that would create two distinct spots on TLC.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D, where two different bromoalkyl ethers are formed, leading to two spots on TLC.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves the reaction of (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The reaction is expected to involve the double bond in the but-3-en-1-yl group, as HBr typically adds across double bonds in alkenes. The substituent is identified as 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl, which has a double bond between C3 and C4 in a four-carbon chain, with two methyl groups on C2.

When HBr adds to the double bond, the reaction mechanism likely involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate. The addition of HBr can occur in two ways, leading to bromination at either the 3rd or 4th carbon of the butoxy group. This results in two possible products: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. These two products would appear as distinct spots on the TLC plate.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A:** Suggests the formation of two phenols, which would require hydrolysis of the ether bond. However, the reaction conditions with HBr do not favor ether hydrolysis, making this option unlikely.
- **Option B:** Proposes one product as a brominated butoxy benzene and the other as a different butenyl ether. This implies isomerization or rearrangement, which is not consistent with the reaction mechanism involving HBr addition.
- **Option C:** Suggests the formation of two cyclic structures, which would require cyclization. This is not supported by the reaction conditions or the structure of the starting material.
- **Option D:** Indicates the formation of two brominated products, (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. This aligns with the expected addition of HBr across the double bond, leading to bromination at different positions.

### Conclusion:
The reaction of (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with HBr results in the addition of HBr across the double bond, forming two brominated products. These products correspond to the structures described in **Option D**.

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it through again.

The question says that a researcher reacted (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). Then, the reaction was monitored with TLC, and it showed that the reactant spot had diminished, with two new spots appearing. The options are about the possible structures of the products.

Hmm, I remember that when alkenes react with HBr, it usually leads to an addition reaction. But wait, the compound here is an ether, right? Because the structure is (something)oxybenzene, which means it's an aryl ether. So the group attached to oxygen is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl). Let me draw that structure in my mind.

The substituent is a butenyl group. Let me number the carbons. The main chain is four carbons long. The double bond is between C3 and C4 (since it's but-3-en-1-yl). So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2 with a double bond between the third and fourth carbons? Wait, no. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-? No, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond starting at position 3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? No, that can't be because that's but-1-ene. Wait, maybe I should think about the actual structure.

But-3-en-1-yl group: the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait. Wait, but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 where the double bond is between C3 and C4? Wait, that doesn't make sense because but has four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but that's but-1-en-1-yl? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the correct numbering. For but-3-en-1-yl, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So it's CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? But wait, that's impossible because but has four carbons. Oh wait, wait. Let me think again. The butenyl group is four carbons long. The substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene.

So the butenyl group is CH2-CH(C)-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond at position 3. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but where's the double bond?

Wait, no, the group is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, that would make it CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4? But that's not possible because but has only four carbons. So the structure must be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 is four carbons. So but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond from C3 to C4? But there are only four carbons, so C1, C2, C3, C4. So but-3-en-1-yl is CH2-CH2-CH=CH2? No, that would be but-1-en-1-yl. Oh wait, no, but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4, but that's not possible because for but, the longest chain has four carbons. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, or C2 and C3.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the group is:

O-benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2?

Wait, no, because if it's but-3-en-1-yl, the structure would be O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 where the double bond is between C3 and C4? That's impossible because but has four carbons. Oh, wait, but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- but that's but-1-en-1-yl. I think I'm getting the positions wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (CH2)2C(CH3)2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that would be CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but that doesn't have a double bond. Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe it's better to draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, perhaps I should move on and think about the reaction.

Okay, so the molecule is an aryl ether, R-O-benzene, where R is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the ether is O-benzene connected to a butenyl group that has a double bond at position 3, and two methyl groups on carbon 2.

When HBr is added, what happens? HBr is a typical reagent for acid-catalyzed addition to alkenes. So the double bond in the butenyl group will undergo addition.

Wait, but in ethers, the adjacent groups can sometimes undergo different reactions. Wait, but in this case, the structure is an ether, so the O is connected to the butenyl group. So the reaction would be an addition of HBr to the double bond in the butenyl group.

Wait, but ethers are generally not very reactive towards HBr unless under specific conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more like an acid-catalyzed cleavage or some kind of electrophilic substitution.

Wait, but the molecule is O-benzene connected to a butenyl group, which has a double bond. So when HBr is added, it would add across the double bond in the butenyl group. So it's an alkyl bromide that's being formed.

But wait, let's think about the structure. The butenyl group is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl). So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but butenyl has four carbons, so positions 1-4.

Wait, perhaps the structure is: the double bond is between C2 and C3. Wait, but the substituent is called but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond from C3 to C4. Therefore, the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 where the double bond is between C3 and C4. Wait, but that would mean the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's impossible because that's a four-carbon chain with the double bond between C3 and C4, which isn't possible. Oh, wait, perhaps it's a typo, but I'll have to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-benzene? No, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the butenyl group is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3, which would make it but-2-en-1-yl, but the question says but-3-en-1-yl.

Wait, maybe the substituent is:

The main chain is four carbons: positions 1,2,3,4.

But-3-en-1-yl: the double bond is between C3 and C4.

So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that's not possible because that's the same as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond on the third and fourth positions? Wait, but that's beyond the main chain. I think I'm getting stuck on this, but perhaps I should proceed.

So the reaction is between HBr and the double bond. So the HBr will add across the double bond. The addition of HBr to an alkene typically follows anti addition (for non-polar solvents) but in more polar solvents, maybe it's via a carbocation intermediate.

Wait, but the butenyl group is substituted with two methyl groups on the second carbon. So the structure of the substituent is probably CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4? But that can't be right because but has four carbons.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but that doesn't include a double bond. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction.

When HBr adds to an alkene, the result is an alkyl bromide. So if the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, adding HBr across the double bond would lead to a bromide on the adjacent carbons.

So the possible products would be the diastereomers or different substitution products, but considering the structure of the substituent, perhaps the addition could occur in a way that leads to different regiochemistry or stereochemistry.

Wait, but the reaction is an acid-catalyzed addition. So the mechanism would involve the formation of a carbocation. Let me think: when HBr adds to an alkene with a strong acid catalyst, the H adds to the double bond, forming a carbocation, then the bromide ion attacks.

But in this case, the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is probably CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH2)2C(CH3)2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4. Hmm, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2? No, wait, 2,2-dimethyl means two methyl groups on the second carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2, but that's but-2-en-1-yl. No, but the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is further along.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (CH2)2CH-C(CH3)2, but that's not making sense. I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps I should proceed.

Assuming that HBr adds to the double bond, the possible products would be the bromide formed from the addition. So the initial substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. After addition, the substituent would become (2,2-dimethylbutane-3-yl)oxy with a bromide.

Wait, but butane-3-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the bromine on the third carbon? Or perhaps the bromide would be on the adjacent carbon.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent would become a bromoalkyl group. So the product would be (2,2-dimethylbutane-3-bromo-1-yl)oxybenzene.

Wait, but if the addition is HBr to the double bond, the substituent would have a bromine added. So the two possible products would be where the bromine adds to either end of the double bond.

Wait, but for an alkene, adding HBr can lead to two possible products if there's a possibility of different regiochemistry (like in case of allylic carbocation), but in this case, the substituent is highly branched. Let me think about the structure again.

The substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, that can't be because but only has four carbons. So perhaps the correct structure is:

It's (CH2)2C(CH3)2-CH2, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. No, because the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl.

Wait, maybe the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that leaves the substituent as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond at the end. But that would make it but-1-en-1-yl, but the question says but-3-en-1-yl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (CH(CH3)2)CH2-CH2, but with a double bond elsewhere. I think I'm getting stuck here, but perhaps I should think about the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option B: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene.

Wait, so one product is a brominated butoxy group, and the other is a more substituted double bond.

Option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

So these are two diastereomers or different bromination positions.

Option A: Two phenols. But that would imply hydrolysis of the ether, which is possible under acidic conditions, but the question is about adding HBr, which is a strong acid but I'm not sure if it would hydrolyze the ether. Alternatively, perhaps some elimination happened.

Option C: Two cyclic structures. Chromane and dihydrobenzofuran. Hmm, that suggests some kind of cyclization, but I'm not sure how that would happen with HBr addition.

Back to the reaction. HBr added to an alkene would lead to an alkyl bromide. So the initial substituent is an ether, and upon addition, the substituent becomes a brominated alkyl group.

But let's think about the structure. If the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy, then adding HBr across the double bond would produce a bromide on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, when HBr adds to a double bond, the H adds to one carbon and Br to the other. The more substituted carbocation is more stable, so the H adds to the less substituted end, making the more substituted carbocation.

In this substituent, the double bond is probably between C2 and C3, given the substituents.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2, but I'm not getting it right. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2. No, but that's but-2-en-1-yl.

Wait, perhaps it's best to think that the substituent is something like CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere, but I'm not getting it right. Let me think about the reaction.

The addition of HBr to the double bond in the substituent would result in two possible products depending on where the Br adds.

So if the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl), the addition of HBr would form either a 3-bromo or 4-bromo product.

Wait, but if the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, adding HBr would make either 3-bromo or 4-bromo.

But since the substituent is 2,2-dimethyl, the structure is probably CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. So adding HBr would give either 3-bromo or 4-bromo.

Wait, but in reality, the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy. So the structure is:

O-benzene-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2.

Wait, but that can't be because that doesn't include the double bond. So the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl), which would have a double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But that's four carbons, so the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, which can't be. So perhaps the substituent is actually CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2 but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-benzene.

Wait, that would make it a 3-enyl group. So the substituent is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-benzene.

In that case, adding HBr would lead to the formation of a bromide on either the first or second carbon of the substituent.

Wait, no, the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, so the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond starting at position 3. Wait, that's impossible because with four carbons, the double bond can't start at 3. So perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I should think that the substituent is (CH2)2C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, but that's impossible. So perhaps the substituent is actually (CH2)2C(CH3)=CH2. Oh, wait, but that would be but-2-en-1-yl.

Wait, but the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the substituent would have four carbons, with the double bond between C3 and C4. So the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4. But that doesn't add up because but has four carbons, and the double bond can't be between C3 and C4 because that would require a fifth carbon.

Ah, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to construct it step by step.

But-3-en-1-yl would have the structure CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4. But that's impossible because it's only four carbons. So perhaps the correct structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's just a four-carbon chain. Oh, wait, but the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, which would have a double bond starting at C3, which is the third carbon. So the substituent is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but that's the same as CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, which doesn't have a double bond. This doesn't make sense. I think I'm stuck on the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Because but-3-en-1-yl would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. But how? Wait, maybe the correct structure is CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but I'm not getting it right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (CH2)2C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. Wait, but that can't be.

I think I need to move forward, perhaps by considering the options. Let's look at option D: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

So these are two products where the bromine is on carbon 3 or 4 of the butoxy group. That suggests that the addition of HBr across the double bond could lead to either the 3-bromo or 4-bromo product.

Wait, but if the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, adding HBr could lead to either 3-bromo or 4-bromo.

Alternatively, perhaps the double bond in the substituent is between C2 and C3, making it but-2-en-1-yl. In that case, adding HBr would form either a 2-bromo or 3-bromo derivative.

But the question says the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, so maybe the addition leads to 3-bromo and 4-bromo.

Wait, but if the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, that can't be. So perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-O-benzene, which would be but-1-en-1-yl, not 3-en-1-yl.

Wait, I think I'm making a mistake in the structure. Let me think again. But-3-en-1-yl has the structure CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond starting at C3, but that's impossible because with four carbons, the double bond can only start at C1 or C2.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3, making it but-2-en-1-yl. But the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, so perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with the double bond between C3 and C4, which is possible in a longer chain but not in a four-carbon chain.

I think I'm stuck on the structure, but perhaps the reaction leads to two products where the bromine is added to different positions. So looking at the options, option D has two products with bromine on 3 and 4 positions of the butoxy group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the formation of a bromide and an elimination product. For example, if the reaction leads to addition (main product) and some elimination (side product), but the question states that two new spots appeared, so perhaps two products are formed.

Wait, but the problem says the reaction was with HBr. HBr is typically for addition to alkenes, not elimination. So the main products would be the addition products.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not addition but some kind of substitution. Wait, but ethers are generally not very reactive towards HBr unless the leaving group is good. But in this case, the substituent is an ether, so the oxygen is a good leaving group only under certain conditions, but HBr is more likely to add to the double bond.

So the initial product would be the addition of HBr to the double bond in the substituent, leading to a bromide.

So if the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy, adding HBr would form either (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene or (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene, which are the two products in option D.

Wait, but let me think about the positions. When HBr adds to the double bond, the H adds to one carbon and Br to the adjacent. So the substituent has a methyl groups on C2. So the structure is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-O-benzene, but that's but-2-en-1-yl. Hmm, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, but that can't be. So perhaps the substituent is actually CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2-O-benzene.

In that case, adding HBr would result in Br adding to either the first or the second carbon of the substituent.

Wait, but if the double bond is between C1 and C2, then adding HBr would form either 1-bromo or 2-bromo derivatives.

But the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, so the double bond is between C3 and C4, which isn't possible in a four-carbon chain. So perhaps I'm wrong about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is (CH2)2C(CH3)2-CH2 with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between C2 and C3, making it but-2-en-1-yl.

In that case, adding HBr would form either 2-bromo or 3-bromo products.

Wait, but the substituent is but-3-en-1-yl, so this might not be the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but that's but-2-en-1-yl.

I think I'm not getting the structure right, but perhaps I should proceed to the options.

Looking again, option D has two products: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. So the bromine is on the 3rd and 4th carbons of the butoxy group.

Wait, but when you add HBr to a double bond, the Br adds to one end, and the H adds to the other. So the major product would be where the Br is added to the more substituted carbon because that forms the more stable carbocation.

In this case, the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH(CH(CH3))-CH2, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4, but again, that's impossible.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible products.

If the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl, then adding HBr would add Br to the more substituted carbon. So the double bond is between C3 and C4, but that's not possible in a four-carbon chain. So perhaps the substituent is actually (CH2)2C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, that would make the substituent CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. Wait, no, because but-3-en-1-yl would have the double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is CH2=CH-C(CH3)2-CH2, which is 2,2-dimethylbut-1-en-1-yl.

No, that's not right. I think I'm going in circles. Let me think about the options again.

Option B: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and ((2,3-dimethylbut-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzene.

So one product is a bromide, and the other is a different butenyl group. That suggests that the reaction may have involved some isomerization or rearrangement.

Option D: Two bromides at different positions.

Option D's products are 3-bromo and 4-bromo derivatives. So if the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl, adding HBr would give either 3-bromo or 4-bromo.

Wait, but let's imagine the substituent is (CH2)2C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4 (but that's not possible in four carbons). So perhaps the substituent is CH2-CH2-CH(CH(CH3))-CH2, but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH2=C(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH2-O-benzene, which would be 3-en-1-yl. Then adding HBr would add to the double bond, leading to 3-bromo and 2-bromo products.

Wait, but in that case, the substituent is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl. So the structure is CH2-CH2-C(CH3)2-CH2 with a double bond between C3 and C4. That doesn't make sense.

I think I'm stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is option D, where two bromides are formed on different positions. So the products are (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about acid-catalyzed cleavage, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxy, which upon reaction with HBr could undergo acid-catalyzed cleavage to form a carbocation, leading to possible shifts.

If the double bond is between C3 and C4, then adding HBr would form a bromide on C3, but given the substituents, perhaps a hydride shift could occur to form a more stable carbocation.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the substituent is (CH2)2C(CH3)=CH2, which is 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl.

In that case, adding HBr would form a bromide on either C2 or C3.

Wait, but the substituent is (CH2)2C(CH3)=CH2, so adding HBr would protonate the double bond, leading to the more stable carbocation.

The structure would have a double bond between C3 and C4: CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

Protonation would occur on the less substituted carbon (C4), leading to a carbocation on C3: CH2-CH2-C(CH3)+ -CH2.

Then Br- would attack from either side, but since it's symmetric, perhaps only one product forms. Hmm, but that doesn't explain two new spots.

Wait, but maybe the initial substituent can add HBr in two different ways due to the possibility of forming different carbocations.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is more like CH2=C(CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2-O-benzene.

Wait, but I'm not getting the structure right. I think I'll have to make an educated guess based on the options.

Option B: One product is a bromide, the other is a different butenyl group. That suggests some isomerization or rearrangement. But I'm not sure.

Option D: Two bromides at different positions, which would happen if the addition occurs on either end of the double bond, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction leads to some elimination, forming a different alkene, but that would require a base, which HBr isn't.

Wait, but in an acid-catalyzed addition, the bromide could attack from either side, leading to possible diastereomers, but I'm not sure if that would create two distinct spots on TLC.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D, where two different bromoalkyl ethers are formed, leading to two spots on TLC.


The question involves the reaction of (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with hydrogen bromide (HBr). The reaction is expected to involve the double bond in the but-3-en-1-yl group, as HBr typically adds across double bonds in alkenes. The substituent is identified as 2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl, which has a double bond between C3 and C4 in a four-carbon chain, with two methyl groups on C2.

When HBr adds to the double bond, the reaction mechanism likely involves the formation of a carbocation intermediate. The addition of HBr can occur in two ways, leading to bromination at either the 3rd or 4th carbon of the butoxy group. This results in two possible products: (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. These two products would appear as distinct spots on the TLC plate.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A:** Suggests the formation of two phenols, which would require hydrolysis of the ether bond. However, the reaction conditions with HBr do not favor ether hydrolysis, making this option unlikely.
- **Option B:** Proposes one product as a brominated butoxy benzene and the other as a different butenyl ether. This implies isomerization or rearrangement, which is not consistent with the reaction mechanism involving HBr addition.
- **Option C:** Suggests the formation of two cyclic structures, which would require cyclization. This is not supported by the reaction conditions or the structure of the starting material.
- **Option D:** Indicates the formation of two brominated products, (4-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene and (3-bromo-2,2-dimethylbutoxy)benzene. This aligns with the expected addition of HBr across the double bond, leading to bromination at different positions.

### Conclusion:
The reaction of (2,2-dimethylbut-3-en-1-yl)oxybenzene with HBr results in the addition of HBr across the double bond, forming two brominated products. These products correspond to the structures described in **Option D**.
