Okay, so I've got this question about NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized peptidic compound. Hmm, let's try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound is mostly as expected, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals, adding up to 1H. The coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Oh right, spin-spin coupling usually leads to splitting into multiple peaks, like a doublet or more, but if they're same integral and same shift, maybe it's something else.

Then the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. That suggests they have the same molecular weight, so probably the same compound but maybe different forms.

Wait, what could cause two peaks in NMR for the same proton? One possibility is that the compound is a racemic mixture. Enantiomers would have the same NMR shifts because they're mirror images, but wait, no, that's for chiral centers. Oh wait, in an enantiomeric pair, the same protons are present but their environments are mirror images, so their shifts might be the same. So in that case, the NMR would show each proton once, but if both enantiomers are present, maybe the signals would just add up? But wait, the integral is 1H total, so perhaps each enantiomer contributes their own set of protons. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe it's a diastereomer. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR shifts would be different. But in the question, the two peaks have similar shifts. So that might not fit if it's diastereomers, unless the diastereomers are very similar in structure, causing their alpha-protons to have almost the same shifts. But then the integrals would be more than 1H if both are present, unless each diastereomer is contributing 0.5H each. But wait, each diastereomer would have their own set of protons. Hmm, not sure.

Another thought: the question says that the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So, perhaps the proton is split into two due to something else, but the coupling is ruled out. Maybe it's a double bond or something else causing the splitting. Or perhaps it's a case of isomerism without chiral centers. Wait, but what kind of isomerism would cause the same proton to split into two?

Wait, looking at the options, option B is enantiomer mixture, and D is diastereomers.

Let me think about the NMR. If it's a racemic mixture (enantiomers), the NMR would see both as the same because enantiomers have identical spectra. So if the compound is a 50:50 mixture, each proton would contribute to a single peak. So that wouldn't explain two separate peaks for the same proton. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, another possibility is that the compound is a diastereomer mixture. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR peaks would be split into separate signals. But wait, the question says that the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton, meaning that in each diastereomer, that proton is present and shows a peak. So if there are two diastereomers, each with that proton, their NMR would show two separate peaks for the same proton, each with half the integral. Because each diastereomer contributes 0.5H. So together, 1H. That fits the scenario described.

But wait, if the diastereomers are present in equal amounts, each would contribute a peak. But how does that affect the NMR shifts? If the environment of the alpha-proton is slightly different in each diastereomer, their shifts would be similar but not identical. Since the shifts are similar, it's possible. So that could explain the two peaks in NMR.

Now, the LC-MS part: two peaks with same mass. Same mass suggests same molecular formula. So the same compound, but perhaps different conformers or something else. But diastereomers have different physical properties and would usually have different retention times in LC. Unless the separation isn't perfect. Alternatively, maybe the diastereomers are in rapid equilibrium, but that's more about NMR than LC-MS.

Wait, but the question states that the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So the same m/z, which suggests same molecular weight. So each peak is the same compound. But that doesn't make sense unless they are enantiomers because enantiomers have the same molecular weight and same mass spec. So if it's an enantiomeric mixture, the LC might not separate them if the column isn't chiral, because enantiomers can sometimes have similar retention times. But I thought that LC-MS can sometimes separate them if the column is chiral. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the two peaks in LC-MS are due to a diastereomer mixture. But diastereomers have different physical properties, so they would elute at different times, which is what the question says: two clearly defined peaks. So if they have same molecular weight, that implies same formula, which would be diastereomers, not enantiomers.

Wait, noâ€”diastereomers do have the same molecular formula. So the same molecular weight. So the LC-MS would show two peaks because the diastereomers have different physical properties (like different melting points, boiling points, solubility, etc.), and thus different retention times. So that matches the description.

So, putting it together: the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, which suggests that the environment is slightly different for that proton in each isomer. Since the shifts are similar, and the integrals add up, it's more likely a diastereomer situation. The LC-MS shows two same mass peaks with same intensity, consistent with two diastereomers in equal amounts.

So looking at the options, that would point towards option D: the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.

Wait, but wait another possibility: what about tautomers? No, because tautomers are isomers with the same connectivity but different H positions, but in this case, the peaks are for the same alpha-proton. Tautomers would have different shifts, but the question says the shifts are similar.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a racemic mixture. But in that case, the NMR wouldn't split into two peaks because the enantios would have same shifts. So the integral would look like one peak. Unless the sample is a racemic mixture, but another factor is causing splitting. But the question says that coupling is ruled out, so it's not spin-spin.

Wait, another point: the question says that the two peaks in NMR correspond to the same alpha-proton. So maybe the alpha-carbon is a chiral center. Then, in the racemic mixture, each enantiomer has the same alpha-proton environment, so their peaks would add, making a single peak. So that wouldn't explain two peaks, right? So B is probably not the answer.

So it's more likely that the compound is a diastereomer mixture. Because in that case, each diastereomer has its own set of protons, leading to separate peaks.

So then, options: D is diastereomers, and B is enantiomers.

Wait, another thought: could this be due to a coupling during the amide bond formation? Option C says 'double coupling' during amide bond forming. I'm not familiar with that term. Maybe it's about when two amide bonds form in different ways, leading to different products. But I'm not sure. I'll have to think about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the NMR is showing two peaks because of a coupling between two protons, but the question says that spin-spin coupling is ruled out as an explanation. So that's not it.

Hmm, so between options B and D. The NMR and LC-MS data. Let me reevaluate.

If the crude compound is a racemic mixture (option B), the NMR would show a single peak for each proton, because enantiomers have the same NMR shifts. So the NMR wouldn't show two peaks for the same proton. Therefore, option B is not the right answer.

So, that leaves option D: mixture of diastereoisomers. So in that case, each diastereomer would have a different environment for the alpha-proton, leading to two separate peaks in the NMR, but with similar shifts because the environments are somewhat similar.

The LC-MS part: each diastereomer has same molecular weight (same mass spec), so two peaks of same mass, same intensity if present in equal amounts. So that fits.

So the correct answer is D.

The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound based on its 1H NMR and LC-MS data. The NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton with similar chemical shifts, roughly equal integrals (adding up to 1H), and coupling patterns that rule out spin-spin coupling. The LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule.

### Key Analysis:
1. **NMR Observations**:
   - The presence of two peaks for the same alpha-proton suggests that the proton exists in slightly different environments in the compound. This rules out enantiomers, as enantiomers would produce a single peak for each proton due to identical chemical environments.
   - The similar chemical shifts and equal integrals suggest that the two peaks arise from two distinct forms of the compound in equal amounts.

2. **LC-MS Observations**:
   - The two peaks with the same mass and intensity indicate that the compound has the same molecular formula but exists in two distinct forms. This is consistent with diastereomers, which have the same molecular weight but different physical properties.

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **A) Contamination with a precursor**: This would likely result in a mass spectrum inconsistent with the expected molecule, which is not the case here.
   - **B) Mixture of enantiomers**: Enantiomers have identical NMR spectra, so they would not produce two separate peaks for the same proton. This explanation is inconsistent with the NMR data.
   - **C) Double coupling during amide bond formation**: The question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as an explanation, making this option unlikely.
   - **D) Mixture of diastereoisomers**: Diastereomers have different physical properties, leading to separate NMR peaks for the same proton if their environments are slightly different. The LC-MS data, showing two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, further supports this explanation.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, as this accounts for both the NMR and LC-MS observations.
