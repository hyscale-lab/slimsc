Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question is about three exoplanets—Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But I'm not super sure about that, but I guess it's not directly relevant for solving this problem.

The problem gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So, the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 is 1.4 times that of Planet2, and Planet2 is 2.3 times hotter than Planet3. So, if I let Planet3's temperature be T, Planet2 would be 2.3T, and Planet1 would be 1.4 * 2.3T which is about 3.22T. Wait, maybe I should write that down.

Equilibrium temperature ratio: T1/T2 = 1.4, and T2/T3 = 2.3. So T1 = 1.4 T2, and T2 = 2.3 T3. So T1 = 1.4 * 2.3 T3 = 3.22 T3. So T1 is about 3.22 times T3, but I don't know if I'll need that right away.

Then, the mass ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 1.35. So mass of Planet1 is 1.15 times that of Planet2, and Planet2 is 1.35 times Planet3. So mass-wise, Planet1 = 1.15 * Planet2, and Planet2 = 1.35 * Planet3. So Planet1's mass is 1.15 * 1.35 * Planet3's mass. Let me calculate that: 1.15 * 1.35 is… let's see, 1.15 * 1.35 = 1.5525. So Planet1 is about 1.55 times Planet3's mass.

But wait, I'm not sure how mass comes into play here. The question is about the orbital period, so Kepler's third law must be involved. Kepler's law relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. Oh, but wait, the problem doesn't mention the mass of the star. Hmm, but maybe since all three planets are orbiting the same star, their periods relate in a way that depends on the star's mass.

Wait, the formula for Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³, where M is the mass of the star. So for each planet, P² is proportional to a³/(M), but since M is the same for all planets, the ratio of periods squared would be the ratio of a³.

But the problem is, we don't know the semi-major axes. So I need to find a way to relate the equilibrium temperatures and masses to the semi-major axes.

Equilibrium temperature—what's the formula for that? I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by T = [ ( L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance from the star, which is the semi-major axis a.

Wait, wait, no, the formula is T_eff = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 D) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4), but maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law. Alternatively, I think the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * ( (1 - a) / (2) )^(1/4) * ( D / R_star )^(-1/2), but perhaps I'm mixing up terms. Alternatively, the formula can be written as T = T_star * ( (1 - a) / 2 )^(1/4) * sqrt( L / (16 π σ D²) ), but perhaps I should just consider that the equilibrium temperature is proportional to ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) / sqrt(D). Wait, I think the exact formula is T = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 D) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4). But maybe I can simplify this because the albedo is the same for all three planets, which is 0.3. So a = 0.3 for all, so (1 - a) is 0.7 for all.

Wait, so the equilibrium temperature equation for each planet would be T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2 D)) * (0.7)^(1/4). So T is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(2 D) ). So T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). So since T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D), then D is proportional to 1/(T^2).

Wait, that's interesting. So if T1 / T2 = 1.4, then D1 / D2 = (T2 / T1 )^2. Because D is proportional to 1/T². So D1 / D2 = (T2 / T1 ) squared. Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D), so D is proportional to 1/(T^2).

So more precisely, since T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), then T1 = k / sqrt(D1), and T2 = k / sqrt(D2). So T1 / T2 = sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4. So sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4 → D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 → D1/D2 = 1/1.96 ≈ 0.51. So D1 is about 0.51 times D2.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is T2/T3 = 2.3. So T2 = 2.3 T3.

Again, D2/D3 = (T3/T2)^2 = (1/2.3)^2 ≈ (0.4348)^2 ≈ 0.189. So D2 is about 0.189 times D3.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. Let me write this properly.

Given T1 / T2 = 1.4 → T1 = 1.4 T2 → which implies D1 = D2 / (1.4)^2 ≈ D2 / 1.96.

Similarly, T2 / T3 = 2.3 → T2 = 2.3 T3 → D2 = D3 / (2.3)^2 ≈ D3 /5.29.

So D1 = D2 / 1.96, and D2 = D3 /5.29.

So substituting D2 into D1, D1 = (D3 /5.29) / 1.96 = D3 / (5.29 * 1.96) Let me compute 5.29 * 1.96.

5.29 is approximately (2.3)^2. 1.96 is (1.4)^2. 5.29 * 1.96 = let's compute 5 * 1.96 =9.8, 0.29 *1.96≈0.5684 → total around 10.3684. So D1 ≈ D3 / 10.3684 → D1 ≈ 0.0965 D3.

Wait, but that's the distance of Planet1 relative to Planet3. Wait, but Kepler's third law relates the period to the semi-major axis (distance). So if I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes (D1, D2, D3), I can find the ratio of the periods.

But wait, Kepler's third law for a star (assuming same mass M) is P² ∝ D³ / M. So since M is the same, P² ∝ D³ → P ∝ D^(3/2).

So if D1 is about 0.0965 D3, then P1 is proportional to (D1)^(3/2) = (0.0965 D3)^(3/2) = (0.0965)^(3/2) * D3^(3/2).

Similarly, P3 is proportional to (D3)^(3/2).

So P1/P3 = (0.0965)^(3/2). Let me compute 0.0965^(1/2) first. The square root of 0.0965 is approximately 0.31 (since 0.31^2=0.0961). So 0.31. Then, 0.31^3 = 0.0298, approximately 0.03. So P1 is about 0.03 times P3, meaning P3 is about 33.33 times P1. Wait, but that's one of the options. Option D is ~33.4.

Wait, but wait. That would mean P3 is about 33.4 times P1. So the factor by which P3 is larger than P1 is 33.4. So the answer would be D.

But wait, did I miss something else? Because the question also gave the mass ratios. The problem's mass ratios are given as between the planets. Wait, the mass of the planet shouldn't directly affect the equilibrium temperature, unless through gravitational interactions, but in the TTV method, the masses influence the timing variations. But for the equilibrium temperature, the planet's mass doesn't directly come into play, unless perhaps through the planet's radius affecting the albedo or something else. Wait, but the albedo is given as the same for all planets, so 0.3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the equilibrium temperature depends only on D and the star's properties. Because the actual equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4). So the star's radius and luminosity would matter, but the problem doesn't give us any information about the star. Oh, but maybe all the planets orbit the same star, so R_star and L are the same for all. Therefore, the (R_star/(2D)) term would vary per planet.

But in this case, since all planets are around the same star, the R_star and L are same, so the equilibrium temperature ratio only depends on D and (1 - a), which is same for all. So, the approach I did above holds.

But wait, the problem gives the mass ratios of the planets. So how do masses affect the periods? Because in Kepler's law, the period depends on the mass of the star, not the planet. So the planets' masses are negligible compared to the star. So for Kepler's third law, the planet's mass doesn't affect the period. So perhaps the mass ratios are a red herring and don't affect the calculation here.

Hmm, so why are they given? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-read the problem.

The question states that the planets were discovered through the TTV method. TTV stands for Transit Timing Variation. Oh, right, that's a method where you look for variations in the timing of transits caused by gravitational interactions with other planets in the system. So the presence of other planets can perturb the timing of the transits of a given planet, and by measuring these variations, you can infer the existence of other planets.

But for this problem, perhaps the masses are given because the TTV method depends on the masses of the other planets. But given that this is a Keplerian problem, and the period depends on the star's mass and the semi-major axis, the planet masses may not directly affect the period. So, perhaps the mass ratios are not needed for calculating the period ratio.

But wait, maybe the planet's mass affects the TTV method in a way that could impact other parameters, but in this question, since the equilibrium temperatures are given, perhaps the masses are irrelevant for the current calculation. So, the mass ratios might be a distractor.

So, going back, I think the approach is correct. So, if D1 is about 0.0965 D3, then the period ratio would be P3 / P1 = (D3 / D1 )^(3/2) = (1/0.0965 )^(3/2 ) ≈ (10.36 )^(3/2 ).

Wait, let me compute 10.36^(1/2) is approximately 3.22, because 3.2^2=10.24, which is close. So 10.36^(1/2) ≈ 3.22. Then, 3.22^3 is approx 3.22 * 3.22 =10.368, then *3.22 ≈ 10.368 *3.22. Let me compute that: 10 *3.22=32.2, 0.368*3.22≈1.184. So total approx 32.2 +1.184=33.384. So 10.36^(3/2) ≈33.384. So P3 is about 33.4 times P1. So the factor is approximately 33.4, which is option D.

Wait, but what if I made a mistake in the calculation of D1 and D3? Let me double-check.

We have T1 = 1.4 T2 → T1/T2=1.4. Since T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), then D1/D2 = (T2/T1 )^2 = (1/1.4 )^2 = (5/7 )^2 ≈ 25/49 ≈ 0.5102. So D1≈0.5102 D2.

Similarly, T2 =2.3 T3 → T2/T3=2.3 → D2/D3 = (T3/T2 )^2 = (1/2.3 )^2 ≈ (0.4348 )^2 ≈ 0.189. So D2 ≈0.189 D3.

So D1 = D2 * 0.5102 ≈ (0.189 D3 ) *0.5102 → 0.189 *0.5102 ≈0.0964 D3.

So D1/D3≈0.0964.

Thus, D3/D1≈1/0.0964≈10.37.

So Kepler's law says P^2 ∝ D^3 → P ∝ sqrt(D^3 ) = D^(3/2).

So P3/P1 = (D3/D1 )^(3/2 ) → (10.37 )^(3/2 ).

As before, 10.37^(1/2)=3.22. Then, 3.22^3≈33.384.

So the period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times longer than Planet1. So the answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the relationships provided in the problem and apply Kepler's third law. The equilibrium temperature ratio and the TTV method details are key to solving this.

### Step 1: Equilibrium Temperature and Distance Relationship
The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star (\( D \)), i.e., \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{D} \). This implies \( D \propto 1/T^2 \). Using the given temperature ratios:
- \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \) → \( D_1 / D_2 = (T_2 / T_1)^2 = (1/1.4)^2 \approx 0.5102 \)
- \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \) → \( D_2 / D_3 = (T_3 / T_2)^2 = (1/2.3)^2 \approx 0.189 \)

Substituting \( D_2 = 0.189 D_3 \) into \( D_1 = 0.5102 D_2 \), we get:
\[
D_1 = 0.5102 \times 0.189 D_3 \approx 0.0964 D_3
\]
Thus, \( D_1 / D_3 \approx 0.0964 \), or equivalently, \( D_3 / D_1 \approx 10.37 \).

### Step 2: Orbital Period Ratio Using Kepler's Third Law
Kepler's third law states that \( P^2 \propto D^3 \), so \( P \propto D^{3/2} \). The ratio of the periods is:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left( \frac{D_3}{D_1} \right)^{3/2}
\]
Substituting \( D_3 / D_1 \approx 10.37 \):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.37)^{3/2}
\]
First, calculate \( 10.37^{1/2} \approx 3.22 \). Then, \( 10.37^{3/2} = (10.37^{1/2})^3 \approx 3.22^3 \). Compute \( 3.22^3 \):
\[
3.22^2 \approx 10.368, \quad 10.368 \times 3.22 \approx 33.384
\]
Thus, \( P_3 / P_1 \approx 33.4 \).

### Step 3: Final Answer
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. This matches option **D**.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question is about three exoplanets—Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variation. But I'm not super sure about that, but I guess it's not directly relevant for solving this problem.

The problem gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures. Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.4, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 2.3. So, the equilibrium temperature of Planet1 is 1.4 times that of Planet2, and Planet2 is 2.3 times hotter than Planet3. So, if I let Planet3's temperature be T, Planet2 would be 2.3T, and Planet1 would be 1.4 * 2.3T which is about 3.22T. Wait, maybe I should write that down.

Equilibrium temperature ratio: T1/T2 = 1.4, and T2/T3 = 2.3. So T1 = 1.4 T2, and T2 = 2.3 T3. So T1 = 1.4 * 2.3 T3 = 3.22 T3. So T1 is about 3.22 times T3, but I don't know if I'll need that right away.

Then, the mass ratios: Planet1 to Planet2 is about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is about 1.35. So mass of Planet1 is 1.15 times that of Planet2, and Planet2 is 1.35 times Planet3. So mass-wise, Planet1 = 1.15 * Planet2, and Planet2 = 1.35 * Planet3. So Planet1's mass is 1.15 * 1.35 * Planet3's mass. Let me calculate that: 1.15 * 1.35 is… let's see, 1.15 * 1.35 = 1.5525. So Planet1 is about 1.55 times Planet3's mass.

But wait, I'm not sure how mass comes into play here. The question is about the orbital period, so Kepler's third law must be involved. Kepler's law relates the orbital period to the semi-major axis and the mass of the star. Oh, but wait, the problem doesn't mention the mass of the star.

Wait, the formula for Kepler's third law is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³, where M is the mass of the star. So for each planet, P² is proportional to a³/(M), but since M is the same for all planets, the ratio of periods squared would be the ratio of a³.

But the problem is, we don't know the semi-major axes. So I need to find a way to relate the equilibrium temperatures and masses to the semi-major axes.

Equilibrium temperature—what's the formula for that? I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by T = [ ( L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's albedo, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and D is the distance from the star, which is the semi-major axis a.

Wait, wait, no, the formula is T_eff = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 D) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4), but maybe I should think in terms of the inverse square law. Alternatively, I think the equilibrium temperature formula is T = T_star * ( (1 - a) / (2) )^(1/4) * ( D / R_star )^(-1/2), but perhaps I'm mixing up terms. Alternatively, the formula can be written as T = T_star * ( (1 - a) / 2 )^(1/4) * sqrt( L / (16 π σ D²) ), but perhaps I should just consider that the equilibrium temperature is proportional to ( (1 - a) )^(1/4) / sqrt(D). Wait, I think the exact formula is T = T_star * sqrt( R_star / (2 D) ) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4). But maybe I can simplify this because the albedo is the same for all three planets, which is 0.3. So a = 0.3 for all, so (1 - a) is 0.7 for all.

Wait, so the equilibrium temperature equation for each planet would be T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2 D)) * (0.7)^(1/4). So T is proportional to sqrt( R_star/(2 D) ). So T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). So since T is proportional to 1/sqrt(D), then D is proportional to 1/(T^2).

Wait, that's interesting. So if T1 / T2 = 1.4, then D1 / D2 = (T2 / T1 )^2. Because D is proportional to 1/T². So D1 / D2 = (T2 / T1 ) squared. Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D), so D is proportional to 1/(T^2).

So more precisely, since T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), then T1 = k / sqrt(D1), and T2 = k / sqrt(D2). So T1 / T2 = sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4. So sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4 → D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 → D1/D2 = 1/1.96 ≈ 0.51. So D1 is about 0.51 times D2.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is T2/T3 = 2.3. So T2 = 2.3 T3.

Again, D2/D3 = (T3/T2)^2 = (1/2.3)^2 ≈ (0.4348)^2 ≈ 0.189. So D2 is about 0.189 times D3.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. Let me write this properly.

Given T1 / T2 = 1.4 → T1 = 1.4 T2 → which implies D1 = D2 / (1.4)^2 ≈ D2 / 1.96.

Similarly, T2 / T3 = 2.3 → T2 = 2.3 T3 → D2 = D3 / (2.3)^2 ≈ D3 /5.29.

So D1 = D2 / 1.96, and D2 = D3 /5.29.

So substituting D2 into D1, D1 = (D3 /5.29) / 1.96 = D3 / (5.29 * 1.96) Let me compute 5.29 * 1.96.

5.29 is approximately (2.3)^2. 1.96 is (1.4)^2. 5.29 * 1.96 = let's compute 5 * 1.96 =9.8, 0.29 *1.96≈0.5684 → total around 10.3684. So D1 ≈ D3 / 10.3684 → D1 ≈ 0.0965 D3.

Wait, but that's the distance of Planet1 relative to Planet3. Wait, but Kepler's third law relates the period to the semi-major axis (distance). So if I can find the ratio of the semi-major axes (D1, D2, D3), I can find the ratio of the periods.

But wait, Kepler's third law for a star (assuming same mass M) is P² ∝ D³ / M. So since M is the same, P² ∝ D³ → P ∝ D^(3/2).

So if D1 is about 0.0965 D3, then P1 is proportional to (D1)^(3/2) = (0.0965 D3)^(3/2) = (0.0965)^(3/2) * D3^(3/2).

Similarly, P3 is proportional to (D3)^(3/2).

So P1/P3 = (0.0965)^(3/2). Let me compute 0.0965^(1/2) first. The square root of 0.0965 is approximately 0.31 (since 0.31^2=0.0961). So 0.31. Then, 0.31^3 = 0.0298, approximately 0.03. So P1 is about 0.03 times P3, meaning P3 is about 33.33 times P1. Wait, but that's one of the options. Option D is ~33.4.

Wait, but wait. That would mean P3 is about 33.4 times P1. So the factor by which P3 is larger than P1 is 33.4. So the answer would be D.

But wait, did I miss something else? Because the question also gave the mass ratios. The problem's mass ratios are given as between the planets. Wait, the mass of the planet shouldn't directly affect the equilibrium temperature, unless through gravitational interactions, but in the TTV method, the masses influence the timing variations.

Hmm, so why are they given? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me re-read the problem.

The question states that the planets were discovered through the TTV method. TTV stands for Transit Timing Variation. Oh, right, that's a method where you look for variations in the timing of transits caused by gravitational interactions with other planets in the system.

So, perhaps the mass ratios are not needed for calculating the period ratio.

But wait, maybe the planet's mass affects the TTV method in a way that could impact other parameters, but in this question, since the equilibrium temperatures are given, perhaps the masses are irrelevant for the current calculation. So, the mass ratios might be a distractor.

So, going back, I think the approach is correct. So, if D1 is about 0.0965 D3, then the period ratio would be P3 / P1 = (D3 / D1 )^(3/2) = (1/0.0965 )^(3/2 ) ≈ (10.36 )^(3/2 ).

Wait, let me compute 10.36^(1/2) is approximately 3.22, because 3.2^2=10.24, which is close. So 10.36^(1/2) ≈ 3.22. Then, 3.22^3 is approx 3.22 * 3.22 =10.368, then *3.22 ≈ 10.368 *3.22. Let me compute that: 10 *3.22=32.2, 0.368*3.22≈1.184. So total approx 32.2 +1.184=33.384. So 10.36^(3/2) ≈33.384. So P3 is about 33.4 times P1. So the factor is approximately 33.4, which is option D.

Wait, but what if I made a mistake in the calculation of D1 and D3? Let me double-check.

We have T1 = 1.4 T2 → T1/T2=1.4. Since T ∝ 1/sqrt(D), then D1/D2 = (T2/T1 )^2 = (1/1.4 )^2 = (5/7 )^2 ≈ 25/49 ≈ 0.5102. So D1≈0.5102 D2.

Similarly, T2 =2.3 T3 → T2/T3=2.3 → D2/D3 = (T3/T2 )^2 = (1/2.3 )^2 ≈ (0.4348 )^2 ≈ 0.189. So D2 ≈0.189 D3.

So D1 = D2 * 0.5102 ≈ (0.189 D3 ) *0.5102 → 0.189 *0.5102 ≈0.0964 D3.

So D1/D3≈0.0964.

Thus, D3/D1≈1/0.0964≈10.37.

So Kepler's law says P^2 ∝ D^3 → P ∝ sqrt(D^3 ) = D^(3/2).

So P3/P1 = (D3/D1 )^(3/2 ) → (10.37 )^(3/2 ).

As before, 10.37^(1/2)=3.22. Then, 3.22^3≈33.384.

So the period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times longer than Planet1. So the answer is D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the relationships provided in the problem and apply Kepler's third law. The equilibrium temperature ratio and the TTV method details are key to solving this.

### Step 1: Equilibrium Temperature and Distance Relationship
The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star (\( D \)), i.e., \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{D} \). This implies \( D \propto 1/T^2 \). Using the given temperature ratios:
- \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \) → \( D_1 / D_2 = (T_2 / T_1)^2 = (1/1.4)^2 \approx 0.5102 \)
- \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \) → \( D_2 / D_3 = (T_3 / T_2)^2 = (1/2.3)^2 \approx 0.189 \)

Substituting \( D_2 = 0.189 D_3 \) into \( D_1 = 0.5102 D_2 \), we get:
\[
D_1 = 0.5102 \times 0.189 D_3 \approx 0.0964 D_3
\]
Thus, \( D_1 / D_3 \approx 0.0964 \), or equivalently, \( D_3 / D_1 \approx 10.37 \).

### Step 2: Orbital Period Ratio Using Kepler's Third Law
Kepler's third law states that \( P^2 \propto D^3 \), so \( P \propto D^{3/2} \). The ratio of the periods is:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left( \frac{D_3}{D_1} \right)^{3/2}
\]
Substituting \( D_3 / D_1 \approx 10.37 \):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.37)^{3/2}
\]
First, calculate \( 10.37^{1/2} \approx 3.22 \). Then, \( 10.37^{3/2} = (10.37^{1/2})^3 \approx 3.22^3 \). Compute \( 3.22^3 \):
\[
3.22^2 \approx 10.368, \quad 10.368 \times 3.22 \approx 33.384
\]
Thus, \( P_3 / P_1 \approx 33.4 \).

### Step 3: Final Answer
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. This matches option **D**.
