Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence leads to the desired product with high yield.

First, I should probably sketch the structure of the target molecule to better visualize what's needed. The molecule is ethan-1-one, which means it's acetophenone with substituents. The phenyl group attached to the ketone has two substituents: a bromo group and a nitro group. The positions are 3-bromo and 5-nitro, so numbering the benzene ring, the nitro is at position 5, and bromo at 3 relative to the ketone group.

Wait, no. Let me clarify the numbering. In the compound 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, the phenyl group is attached to the ketone (the ethan-1-one part). So the substituents are on the benzene ring. The numbering would be such that the ketone is at position 1, then the bromo is at 3 and nitro at 5. So the substituents are at meta and para positions relative to each other. Hmm, perhaps it's better to imagine the benzene ring with the ketone group at position 1, bromo at 3, nitro at 5.

Wait, actually, benzene is a six-membered ring. If the ketone is attached at position 1, then positions 2,3,4,5,6 are around. So 3-bromo would be the third position, and 5-nitro would be the fifth, which is across from the ketone. So the substituents are at the meta (3) and para (5?) Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering. Let me think again. Another approach: the benzene ring has three substituents: the ketone (at position 1), nitro (at position 5), and bromo (position 3). So that's 1-ketone, 3-bromo, 5-nitro. So the substituents are in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone.

So the benzene ring would have the ketone group attached, and then two other substituents at 3 and 5 positions.

To make this, I need to plan the synthesis steps. The starting material is benzene. I need to introduce a ketone group (acetophenone) and two substituents: bromine and nitro groups.

Wait, but the order of introducing these substituents matters. For example, nitration and bromination are typically done under certain conditions, which could be influenced by other substituents present.

Let me recall the directing effects of substituents. Acetophenone (a ketone) is a meta director because the carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing. Nitro groups are strong meta directors. Bromine can be either ortho/para (if it's a substituent on the benzene without any other directing groups), but if another group is present, it might direct differently.

Wait, but when introducing substituents, the existing groups will influence where the next substituent goes. So if I first introduce a nitro group, it's a meta director. Then, when adding bromine, the position would be meta to nitro. Alternatively, if I add the bromine first, it's ortho/para, but then the next substituent (like nitro) would be directed differently.

Wait, but the target has both a bromo and a nitro group on the benzene ring along with the ketone. So I need to figure out the order in which these groups are introduced to get the correct positions.

Let me outline possible steps.

First, maybe I should introduce the acetophenone group first. Acetophenone can be made by Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with an acyl chloride, like CH3COCl, using AlCl3 as a catalyst. So step 1 would be CH3COCl/AlCl3.

Once benzene is converted to acetophenone, the next step would be to introduce the nitro group. Since acetophenone is a meta director, the nitration would occur at the meta position relative to the ketone. So nitration would add a nitro group at position 3 (assuming the ketone is at position 1). Then, bromination would add a bromine at the meta position relative to the nitro group? Or wait, maybe not.

Wait, let's think: After acylation, the ring has a ketone group (meta director). Nitration would add nitro group at position 3. Then, bromination would be directed by the existing groups. So if the ring has a ketone at 1 and nitro at 3, where would bromine add?

The nitro group is a strong meta director. The ketone is also a meta director. So when adding bromine, which substituent will dominate the direction? The most activating and strongest director has the most influence. Nitro is deactivating (so less activating than the ring itself), while the ketone is also deactivating. Wait, but both are meta directors. So perhaps the bromine would enter where both directors point.

Wait, perhaps it's better to plan the order of introducing substituents. Let me think: perhaps the nitro group and bromine should be added before the ketone? Wait, but benzene doesn't have a directing group, so nitrating and brominating benzene would give para and ortho products. Alternatively, if I add nitro first, then bromine.

Wait, but if I have benzene, and I first nitrate it, I get nitrobenzene. Then, brominating nitrobenzene would add bromine in the meta position relative to nitro. Because nitro is a strong meta director. So that would place bromine at position 3 if nitro is at position 1.

Then, after nitro and bromine are on benzene, I need to add the ketone group. But wait, ketone is an electron-withdrawing group, so perhaps the Friedel-Crafts acylation would not proceed on an already nitrated and brominated benzene. Because Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. Nitro is deactivating, so after nitration, benzene becomes deactivated, making Friedel-Crafts impossible.

So that approach might not work. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Introduce the strongest activating group first, allowing subsequent reactions. For instance, introducing a methyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation could activate the ring. Or perhaps, but wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation is possible on benzene but not on rings with strong deactivating groups.

Wait, maybe introducing the ketone first, then nitration, then bromination.

Wait, I know that after the ketone is introduced (making acetophenone), the next substituents would be added in the meta position relative to the ketone.

So, first step: Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with CH3COCl to get acetophenone.

Second step: nitration. Since acetophenone is meta directing, nitration would introduce nitro group at position 3.

Third step: bromination. Now, the ring has a ketone at position 1 and a nitro at position 3. What directs the bromine? The nitro is a stronger director than the ketone. So the nitro group is a meta director, so bromine would add at position 5 (since position 3 is already taken by nitro, meta would be position 6? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with numbering.

Let me imagine the benzene ring with the ketone at position 1. The nitro group is at position 3 (meta to ketone). Now, where would bromination occur? The nitro group is a meta director, so bromine would enter at position 5 (which is meta to the nitro group). Because, the nitro group is at position 3, so the meta position would be positions 6 and 1. Wait, no, the meta positions are two positions away. So in a benzene ring, each substituent has two meta positions. Let me think of the ring as 1 (ketone), 2, 3 (nitro), 4, 5, 6.

The nitro group at 3 would direct incoming groups to positions 6 and 1 (since those are the meta positions relative to 3). But position 1 is already occupied by the ketone. So the only available meta position is 6. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up ortho, meta, para.

Wait, no. For a substituent at position 3, the meta positions are 6 and 1? Or wait, numbering is such that each substituent has ortho (adjacent), meta (two away), and para (opposite). So for substituent at position 3, the para would be position 6? Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Positions 1 and 4 are para. Positions 2 and 5 are para, 3 and 6 are para. So for substituent at 3, the para is 6, ortho are 2 and 4, and meta would be 5 and 1. Wait, no. Wait, meta is two positions away. Let me think of substituent at position 1: ortho are 2 and 6, meta are 3 and 5, para is 4.

So substituent at 3: ortho are 2 and 4, meta are 5 and 1, para is 6.

Wait, so for substituent at 3, the meta positions are 5 and 1. So if I have a nitro at 3, the next substituent would go to meta positions 5 or 1. But position 1 is already taken by the ketone, so bromine would go to position 5.

Wait, but acetophenone is at 1, nitro at 3. If I do bromination now, the nitro is a meta director, so bromine would enter at 5. That would give me the desired structure: 1-ketone, 3-nitro, 5-bromo. So the target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl ketone.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which is what we have.

So the steps would be:

1. Acetophenone (Friedel-Crafts acylation)
2. Nitration (introduces nitro at position 3)
3. Bromination (introduces Br at position 5)

But wait, bromination of acetophenone? Wait, acetophenone is a meta director. But if I have the ketone and nitro, which are both meta directors, how does the bromination proceed?

Wait, perhaps another approach: maybe the nitro group is added after bromination. Let me think.

Alternative approach: Introduce bromine first, then nitro, then ketone.

Wait, no, because the ketone is difficult to introduce after nitration as nitro is deactivating.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene is nitrated first. Then, brominated. Then, the ketone is introduced. But wait, after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts might not work. So that's not feasible.

So the first approach seems better: first ketone, then nitro, then bromine.

Wait, but how does bromination proceed after nitration?

In acetophenone, the nitro is at position 3. Then, bromination would be directed by the nitro group. So, nitro is a meta director, so bromine would go to position 5.

Wait, but what's the order of reactions in the options? Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation), ii) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination), iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), iv) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), and so on. Hmm, but in this case, after acylation, step ii is bromination. But the nitro comes after, which would be step iii.

Wait, but if the order is acylation, then bromination, then nitration, would the bromine and nitro end up in the correct positions?

Let me think: starting with benzene.

Step i: acylation → acetophenone (position 1).

Step ii: bromination. Since acetophenone is a meta director, bromine would go to position 3.

So now the ring has ketone at 1, bromine at 3.

Step iii: nitration. The directing would be influenced by both the ketone (meta) and bromine (if it's para/ortho director, but wait, bromine is an ortho/para director. But wait, the ring now has a ketone (meta) and bromine (ortho/para). Which group is more influential?

The nitration is a meta director for the ketone and ortho/para for bromine. So where would the nitro group add?

Wait, in a ring with multiple substituents, the most activating group directs the incoming electrophile. But in this case, both the ketone and bromine are deactivating. The ketone is meta-directing, and bromine is ortho/para-directing. Since both are deactivating, the most activating would be the one with the least deactivating effect.

Wait, but bromine is an ortho/para director because it's a leaving group but actually, bromine is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group because it's an electron-withdrawing substituent.

Wait, now I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think: when you have multiple substituents, the strongest directing group (the one that is most activating) will dominate. But if all substituents are deactivating, the most powerful (strongest) deactivating group may dominate.

Wait, the nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. If a ring has both a nitro and a bromine, the nitro is more deactivating, so perhaps it would dominate. But in our scenario, after step ii, the ring has a ketone (meta director) and bromine (ortho/para). 

Wait, when nitration is performed on acetophenone brominated at position 3, the nitro group would enter where?

So, in acetophenone, the ketone is at 1. Bromine is at 3. Now, when nitrating, the existing substituents are ketone (meta) and bromine (ortho/para).

So the nitration would be directed by both. Since the ketone is a meta director and bromine is an ortho/para director, but which effect is stronger? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is in a position that allows the nitration to occur in a certain position.

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the target again. The target has nitro at position 5 and bromine at position 3, with ketone at 1.

Let me imagine the ring:

1: ketone

3: bromine

5: nitro

So, after acylation, bromination, and nitration steps, the substituents should end up in these positions.

But wait, in the initial approach, if I first do acylation, then bromination (which would add at 3), then nitration (which would add where? Let's see.)

After acylation and bromination, the ring has ketone at 1, Br at 3.

Now, during nitration, where does the nitro group go?

The ketone is a meta director, so it would direct to positions 3 and 5, but 3 is already taken by Br. The bromine is an ortho/para director, so it would direct to positions 2, 4, and 6.

Wait, the nitro group would be directed by the strongest influence. Since both substituents are deactivating, the stronger director (the one that's more powerful) would dominate.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration would occur at position 5, which is meta to the ketone and para to the bromine. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration would occur at position 5 because it's meta to the ketone and para to the bromine. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the position 5 is meta to the ketone (position 1) and para to the bromine (position 3). So if the ketone directs the nitro to 5, that's where it would go. So after nitration, the nitro is at 5.

So that would give us the desired product.

But wait, is that possible? So steps would be:

i) Acetophenone (ketone at 1)

ii) Bromination → Br at 3.

iii) Nitration → nitro at 5.

So the substituents are at 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro). That matches the target.

But wait, looking at the options, none of the options have this exact sequence. Let's check the options again.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. So after this, acetophenone has Br at 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So in this step, the nitro group would be added where?

If the nitro group is added in position 5, then the substituents would be correct. But after acylation and bromination, would nitration add at 5?

I'm not sure, because the ring now has two substituents: a ketone (meta) and a Br (ortho/para). So which directs more?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration would happen at position 5 because that's meta to the ketone.

So if that's the case, then option A would produce the desired product.

But wait, option A continues with more steps, like iv) Fe/HCl, which might be a reducing step. But the target doesn't have any other substituents, so I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps after the first three steps (acylation, bromination, nitration), the target is achieved. So why do the options have more steps?

Looking back, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So it requires the ketone, 3-bromo, and 5-nitro. So the reaction steps would be: acylation, bromination, nitration. But if the order is acylation, then bromination, then nitration, is that correct?

Wait, but in option A, after acylation and bromination (steps i and ii), the nitration (step iii) is done. Then comes step iv: Fe and HCl. Fe in HCl is typically used for reducing nitro groups to amino, but that's not desired here. So perhaps option A isn't the correct sequence because it includes steps beyond what's needed.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the options.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination of benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration?

Wait, that would result in two nitro groups, which isn't the case in the target.

Option C:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction of nitro to amine?

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

iv) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

Hmm, nitration first. Benzene would get a nitro group. Then, Fe/HCl is likely a reduction step, converting nitro to amine. Then acylation. Then bromination.

But the target has nitro, so this might not be the case. Unless after acylation, the nitro group is introduced again. But that seems unlikely.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction of nitro to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → nitrous acid conditions, perhaps diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → reduction, maybe to form aniline or something else.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

vii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

This seems like a more complicated sequence, possibly introducing multiple groups, which may not lead to the desired product.

So perhaps option A's steps are i, ii, iii, but then why does it have more steps?

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So perhaps after the initial steps of acylation, bromination, and nitration, we're done. But the options have more steps. So perhaps I'm missing something in the reaction sequences.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Maybe the nitro group is added before bromine.

Wait, let's try another approach. Suppose we first nitrate benzene, then brominate, then acylate.

So step 1: nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

Step 2: brominate nitrobenzene → would add Br in meta relative to nitro, so position 4 (if nitro is at 1, then Br at 3 or 5. Wait, no, nitro at 1, meta would be 3 and 5.

Wait, but then step 3 is acylation. But if the ring has nitro and Br substituents, will acylation proceed? Because nitro is a deactivating group, making the ring less reactive towards Friedel-Crafts acylation.

So that approach might not work.

So maybe the correct sequence is acylation first, then nitration, then bromination.

But wait, after acylation, the ring is acetophenone. Then nitration would add nitro group at position 3. Then bromination would add Br at position 5.

So the substituents are 1 (ketone), 3 (nitro), 5 (Br). Wait, but the target is 3-bromo-5-nitro, meaning Br is at 3 and nitro at 5. So my earlier assumption might have been wrong.

Wait, let me think again. The target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl. So the substituents are at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (nitro) relative to the ketone (position 1). So in that case, after acylation, nitration would add nitro at position 5, and bromination would add Br at position 3.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the numbering. Let me think: the target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl. So the phenyl group attached to the ethan-1-one has a Br at position 3 and a nitro at position 5. So, in the benzene ring, the ketone is attached at position 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5.

So the substituents are 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), 5 (NO2).

So how to get both substituents in the correct positions.

Another approach: perhaps nitration occurs first, then bromination, then acylation.

Wait, but again, if I nitrate benzene, get nitrobenzene. Then brominate, adding Br in the meta position relative to nitro → position 5. Then, can I acylate? Probably not because nitro is deactivating. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe I should do acylation, then bromination, then nitration. Let's see.

Step 1: acetophenone → position 1.

Step 2: brominate → Br adds at position 3 (meta to ketone).

Step 3: nitrate → where does nitro go? The ketone is meta director, and Br is ortho/para director. So nitration would be directed by which group?

If the ring has Br at 3 (ortho/para) and ketone at 1 (meta), the nitro would be added where?

Let me imagine the ring: 1 is ketone, 3 is Br.

Nitration would be directed by both. The Br (at 3) is an ortho/para director, so possible positions are 2,4,6.

The ketone (1) is a meta director, so nitro would go to 4 and 6.

Wait, perhaps the nitration would occur at position 5, but that's not adjacent to either. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group would be added at position 5, which is meta to the ketone (position 1) and para to the Br (position 3). But how does that happen? Because the existing substituents are at 1 and 3.

Wait, maybe the nitro group would be added at position 5 because it's meta to the ketone. Let me see:

In acetophenone brominated at 3, the ring has groups at 1 (COCH3) and 3 (Br). When nitrating, the ketone is a meta director, so it would direct incoming nitro to positions 4 and 6. The Br at 3 is an ortho/para director, so it would direct to positions 2,4,6.

So the possible positions for nitration are 4 and 6 (from ketone) and 2,4,6 (from Br). The overlapping positions are 4 and 6.

So which of these positions is favored? It's possible that the nitro group ends up at position 5, but that's not overlapping.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to think about the options and see which sequence would lead to the correct substituents.

Looking at option A:

i) Acetophenone.

ii) Bromination: Br at 3.

iii) Nitration: would go to position 5, which is meta to the ketone.

So the substituents would be 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro). That's the target!

But option A continues with step iv) Fe/HCl. That's a reducing agent. Fe in HCl is typically for reducing nitro groups to amines. But in our target, we have a nitro group, so reducing it would change it to an amine, which is not desired. So perhaps option A isn't the correct one, as it includes steps beyond what's needed.

Wait, but the target is achieved after steps i, ii, iii. So why is step iv present in all the options?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps. Let me re-examine each option.

Option A: The steps after i, ii, iii are iv) Fe/HCl, v) HNO3/H2SO4, vi) NaNO2/HCl, vii) H3PO2.

I don't see why those would be needed, unless perhaps the steps are to modify substituents in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a step to introduce another group. But the target has only three substituents: ketone, Br, nitro.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that I'm considering only three substitution steps, but the options have more steps, perhaps implying that more than three substituents are added.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility of introducing the nitro group before the bromine. Let's think:

Step i: Acetophenone → ketone at 1.

Step ii: Nitration → nitro at position 5 (meta to ketone).

Step iii: bromination → Br at position 3.

This would give the target structure. But looking at the options, which one follows this sequence?

Looking at the options, option A's step iii is nitration after acylation and bromination. So that's the order I was thinking earlier. But in option A, after that, there are more steps.

Wait, perhaps the other steps are for introducing another group, but the target doesn't have any. So maybe the correct sequence is only the first three steps, but the options include all steps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should look for a sequence where the nitro and bromo groups are introduced in the correct order.

Wait, let's think about the possible directing effects again.

Another possibility: The nitro group is introduced second, but after bromine.

So, first acylation (ketone at 1).

Then bromination (Br at 3).

Then nitration (nitro at 5). So that's the correct order.

So in which option does this happen? Let's check the options.

Option A: i) acylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration. That's the sequence I'm thinking. So that would produce the correct product. But the option A has more steps after that. So why are they there?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps. Maybe some steps are for protecting groups or other purposes. Alternatively, perhaps the sequences in the options are longer because they include steps to modify other groups.

Wait, but the target only has three substituents. So perhaps the only steps needed are acylation, bromination, and nitration.

Looking at the options, which one has only those three steps? None of them. Each option has seven steps. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that after nitration, another reaction is needed. For example, sometimes nitration is followed by a reduction step, but in this case, we want to retain the nitro group.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are for the production of a different substituent, but I'm not seeing it.

Another thought: Maybe the nitro group is added after the bromide is introduced via a different pathway.

Wait, perhaps the bromide is introduced via a substitution reaction, but that's not the case here. The bromide is via electrophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A because it's the only one where acylation is the first step, followed by bromination and then nitration. The other steps might be for something else, but the first three would achieve the correct substituents.

But then why does the target require more steps? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced before the bromine.

Another approach: Let me consider the substituents.

The target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5 relative to ketone. So the substituents are both meta to the ketone.

Wait, perhaps both substituents are introduced via meta direction from the ketone.

So, first acylation (step i), then nitration (step iii), then bromination (step ii). Wait, but that would place nitro and Br both at meta positions, but which would they occupy?

Wait, perhaps in that order, nitration would add at position 3, and bromination at position 5.

Wait, but I'm getting mixed up again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to introduce the nitro group first, then the bromine, then the ketone. But as I thought earlier, that might not work because the ring would be deactivated.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is A: acylation, bromination, nitration.

But I'm not sure why the option includes more steps. Maybe the extra steps are for something else, but the first three steps are the key.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but let's think about the other options.

Option B: i) bromination, ii) nitration, iii) acylation. So first Br is added. Then nitration. Then acylation.

But after bromination and nitration, the ring would have Br and nitro groups, both of which are deactivating. Friedel-Crafts acylation wouldn't proceed because the ring is too deactivated. So option B isn't correct.

Option C: i) nitration, ii) Fe/HCl → reduction to amine, iii) acylation, iv) bromination.

So step i: nitro at position 1.

Step ii: reduces nitro to amine (-NH2 at position 1).

Step iii: acylation. But Friedel-Crafts acylation requires an activating group, and an amine is strongly activating (ortho/para). So acylation would occur at ortho or para to the amine. But the target has the ketone at position 1. So after acylation, the ketone would be at position 1, pushing other substituents elsewhere.

Wait, but the target has substituents at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. If in option C, after acylation, the substituents are at 1 (ketone), and the amine is at 1 (but wait, step ii reduces nitro to amine, which would be at 1, but then step iii acylation would add the ketone at position 1, which would not be possible because the amine is already there. Or perhaps the acylation would occur at a different position.

Alternatively, perhaps after reduction, the amine is at position 1, and acylation occurs at position 3 or 5. Then bromination would add at another position. But this seems complicated and I'm not sure if it would lead to the correct structure.

Option D: i) nitration, ii) Fe/HCl (reduction), iii) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), iv) H3PO2 (reduction to amine?), v) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination), vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acetylation), vii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration).

This seems to involve multiple steps, including diazotization and reduction, which I don't see how they relate to the target structure. Also, the ketone would be introduced in step vi, but the ring might have other substituents which complicate the reaction.

So, after considering all options, the sequence in option A seems the most plausible, as it introduces the ketone first, then bromine (meta), then nitro (meta to ketone and para to Br). But I'm still a bit confused about the extra steps in the options.

Wait, perhaps the extra steps in option A are for something else, but the first three steps are the key. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something about the reaction conditions.

Wait, another thought: after acylation, bromination, and nitration, the product is correct. The other steps might involve unnecessary reactions, but perhaps the correct option is A because it's the only one where the substituents are added in the correct order.

So, putting it all together, the correct sequence is acylation, bromination, nitration, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the ketone group first, followed by the bromine and nitro groups in the appropriate positions. The target molecule has a ketone at position 1, bromine at position 3, and nitro at position 5 relative to the ketone. 

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - Step i: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group at position 1.  
   - Step ii: Bromination adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the ketone).  
   - Step iii: Nitration adds nitro at position 5 (meta to the ketone and para to the bromine).  
   This sequence correctly places all substituents in the desired positions. However, the option includes additional steps (iv–vii), which are unnecessary for the target product. Despite this, the first three steps are sufficient to achieve the desired structure.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Step i: Bromination of benzene introduces bromine at position 1.  
   - Step ii: Nitration adds nitro at position 3 (meta to bromine).  
   - Step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone.  
   This sequence fails because Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot proceed after bromination and nitration, as the ring becomes deactivated by the nitro group.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Step i: Nitration introduces nitro at position 1.  
   - Step ii: Reduction converts nitro to an amine (-NH₂).  
   - Step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone.  
   - Step iv: Bromination adds bromine.  
   This sequence is problematic because the nitro group is reduced to an amine, which would alter the final structure and make it inconsistent with the target molecule.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Step i: Nitration introduces nitro at position 1.  
   - Step ii: Reduction converts nitro to an amine (-NH₂).  
   - Step iii: Diazotization and reduction produce a different intermediate.  
   - Step iv: Bromination adds bromine.  
   - Step v: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone.  
   - Step vi: Nitration adds another nitro group.  
   This sequence introduces multiple substituents and is overly complex, leading to a structure inconsistent with the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
Option A is the only sequence that introduces the ketone first, followed by bromine and nitro groups in the correct positions. While the additional steps in Option A are unnecessary, the first three steps are sufficient to synthesize the target molecule. Therefore, Option A is the correct choice.

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because synthesis problems can be tricky. But I'll try to break it down step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. There are four options, each with a sequence of reactions. I need to figure out which sequence leads to the desired product with high yield.

First, I should probably sketch the structure of the target molecule to better visualize what's needed. The molecule is ethan-1-one, which means it's acetophenone with substituents. The phenyl group attached to the ketone has two substituents: a bromo group and a nitro group. The positions are 3-bromo and 5-nitro, so numbering the benzene ring, the nitro is at position 5, and bromo at 3 relative to the ketone group.

Wait, no. Let me clarify the numbering. In the compound 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, the phenyl group is attached to the ketone (the ethan-1-one part). So the substituents are on the benzene ring. The numbering would be such that the ketone is at position 1, then the bromo is at 3 and nitro at 5. So the substituents are at meta and para positions relative to each other. Hmm, perhaps it's better to imagine the benzene ring with the ketone group at position 1, bromo at 3, nitro at 5.

Wait, actually, benzene is a six-membered ring. If the ketone is attached at position 1, then positions 2,3,4,5,6 are around. So 3-bromo would be the third position, and 5-nitro would be the fifth, which is across from the ketone. So the substituents are at the meta (3) and para (5?) Wait, maybe I'm getting confused with the numbering. Let me think again. Another approach: the benzene ring has three substituents: the ketone (at position 1), nitro (at position 5), and bromo (position 3). So that's 1-ketone, 3-bromo, 5-nitro. So the substituents are in the 3 and 5 positions relative to the ketone.

So the benzene ring would have the ketone group attached, and then two other substituents at 3 and 5 positions.

To make this, I need to plan the synthesis steps. The starting material is benzene. I need to introduce a ketone group (acetophenone) and two substituents: bromine and nitro groups.

Wait, but the order of introducing these substituents matters. For example, nitration and bromination are typically done under certain conditions, which could be influenced by other substituents present.

Let me recall the directing effects of substituents. Acetophenone (a ketone) is a meta director because the carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing. Nitro groups are strong meta directors. Bromine can be either ortho/para (if it's a substituent on the benzene without any other directing groups), but if another group is present, it might direct differently.

Wait, but when introducing substituents, the existing groups will influence where the next substituent goes. So if I first introduce a nitro group, it's a meta director. Then, when adding bromine, the position would be meta to nitro. Alternatively, if I add the bromine first, it's ortho/para, but then the next substituent (like nitro) would be directed differently.

Wait, but the target has both a bromo and a nitro group on the benzene ring along with the ketone. So I need to figure out the order in which these groups are introduced to get the correct positions.

Let me outline possible steps.

First, maybe I should introduce the acetophenone group first. Acetophenone can be made by Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with an acyl chloride, like CH3COCl, using AlCl3 as a catalyst. So step 1 would be CH3COCl/AlCl3.

Once benzene is converted to acetophenone, the next step would be to introduce the nitro group. Since acetophenone is a meta director, the nitration would occur at the meta position relative to the ketone. So nitration would add a nitro group at position 3 (assuming the ketone is at position 1). Then, bromination would add a bromine at the meta position relative to the nitro group? Or wait, maybe not.

Wait, let's think: After acylation, the ring has a ketone group (meta director). Nitration would add nitro group at position 3. Then, bromination would be directed by the existing groups. So if the ring has a ketone at 1 and nitro at 3, where would bromine add?

The nitro group is a strong meta director. The ketone is also a meta director. So when adding bromine, which substituent will dominate the direction? The most activating and strongest director has the most influence. Nitro is deactivating (so less activating than the ring itself), while the ketone is also deactivating. Wait, but both are meta directors. So perhaps the bromine would enter where both directors point.

Wait, perhaps it's better to plan the order of introducing substituents. Let me think: perhaps the nitro group and bromine should be added before the ketone? Wait, but benzene doesn't have a directing group, so nitrating and brominating benzene would give para and ortho products. Alternatively, if I add nitro first, then bromine.

Wait, but if I have benzene, and I first nitrate it, I get nitrobenzene. Then, brominating nitrobenzene would add bromine in the meta position relative to nitro. Because nitro is a strong meta director. So that would place bromine at position 3 if nitro is at position 1.

Then, after nitro and bromine are on benzene, I need to add the ketone group. But wait, ketone is an electron-withdrawing group, so perhaps the Friedel-Crafts acylation would not proceed on an already nitrated and brominated benzene. Because Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group. Nitro is deactivating, so after nitration, benzene becomes deactivated, making Friedel-Crafts impossible.

So that approach might not work. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Introduce the strongest activating group first, allowing subsequent reactions. For instance, introducing a methyl group via Friedel-Crafts alkylation could activate the ring. Or perhaps, but wait, Friedel-Crafts acylation is possible on benzene but not on rings with strong deactivating groups.

Wait, maybe introducing the ketone first, then nitration, then bromination.

Wait, I know that after the ketone is introduced (making acetophenone), the next substituents would be added in the meta position relative to the ketone.

So, first step: Friedel-Crafts acylation of benzene with CH3COCl to get acetophenone.

Second step: nitration. Since acetophenone is meta directing, nitration would introduce nitro group at position 3.

Third step: bromination. Now, the ring has a ketone at position 1 and a nitro at position 3. What directs the bromine? The nitro is a stronger director than the ketone. So the nitro group is a meta director, so bromine would add at position 5 (since position 3 is already taken by nitro, meta would be position 6? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with numbering.

Let me imagine the benzene ring with the ketone at position 1. The nitro group is at position 3 (meta to ketone). Now, where would bromination occur? The nitro group is a meta director, so bromine would enter at position 5 (which is meta to the nitro group). Because, the nitro group is at position 3, so the meta position would be positions 6 and 1. Wait, no, the meta positions are two positions away. So in a benzene ring, each substituent has two meta positions. Let me think of the ring as 1 (ketone), 2, 3 (nitro), 4, 5, 6.

The nitro group at 3 would direct incoming groups to positions 6 and 1 (since those are the meta positions relative to 3). But position 1 is already occupied by the ketone. So the only available meta position is 6. Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up ortho, meta, para.

Wait, no. For a substituent at position 3, the meta positions are 6 and 1? Or wait, numbering is such that each substituent has ortho (adjacent), meta (two away), and para (opposite). So for substituent at position 3, the para would be position 6? Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. Positions 1 and 4 are para. Positions 2 and 5 are para, 3 and 6 are para. So for substituent at 3, the para is 6, ortho are 2 and 4, and meta would be 5 and 1. Wait, no. Wait, meta is two positions away. Let me think of substituent at position 1: ortho are 2 and 6, meta are 3 and 5, para is 4.

So substituent at 3: ortho are 2 and 4, meta are 5 and 1, para is 6.

Wait, so for substituent at 3, the meta positions are 5 and 1. So if I have a nitro at 3, the next substituent would go to meta positions 5 or 1. But position 1 is already taken by the ketone, so bromine would go to position 5.

Wait, but acetophenone is at 1, nitro at 3. If I do bromination now, the nitro is a meta director, so bromine would enter at 5. That would give me the desired structure: 1-ketone, 3-nitro, 5-bromo. So the target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl ketone.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one, which is what we have.

So the steps would be:

1. Acetophenone (Friedel-Crafts acylation)
2. Nitration (introduces nitro at position 3)
3. Bromination (introduces Br at position 5)

But wait, bromination of acetophenone? Wait, acetophenone is a meta director. But if I have the ketone and nitro, which are both meta directors, how does the bromination proceed?

Wait, perhaps another approach: maybe the nitro group is added after bromination. Let me think.

Alternative approach: Introduce bromine first, then nitro, then ketone.

Wait, no, because the ketone is difficult to introduce after nitration as nitro is deactivating.

Alternatively, perhaps the benzene is nitrated first. Then, brominated. Then, the ketone is introduced. But wait, after nitration, the ring is deactivated, so Friedel-Crafts might not work. So that's not feasible.

So the first approach seems better: first ketone, then nitro, then bromine.

Wait, but how does bromination proceed after nitration?

In acetophenone, the nitro is at position 3. Then, bromination would be directed by the nitro group. So, nitro is a meta director, so bromine would go to position 5.

Wait, but what's the order of reactions in the options? Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (Friedel-Crafts acylation), ii) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination), iii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), iv) Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), and so on. Hmm, but in this case, after acylation, step ii is bromination. But the nitro comes after, which would be step iii.

Wait, but if the order is acylation, then bromination, then nitration, would the bromine and nitro end up in the correct positions?

Let me think: starting with benzene.

Step i: acylation → acetophenone (position 1).

Step ii: bromination. Since acetophenone is a meta director, bromine would go to position 3.

So now the ring has ketone at 1, bromine at 3.

Step iii: nitration. The directing would be influenced by both the ketone (meta) and bromine (if it's para/ortho director, but wait, bromine is an ortho/para director. But wait, the ring now has a ketone (meta) and bromine (ortho/para). Which group is more influential?

The nitration is a meta director for the ketone and ortho/para for bromine. So where would the nitro group add?

Wait, in a ring with multiple substituents, the most activating group directs the incoming electrophile. But in this case, both the ketone and bromine are deactivating. The ketone is meta-directing, and bromine is ortho/para-directing. Since both are deactivating, the most activating would be the one with the least deactivating effect.

Wait, but bromine is an ortho/para director because it's a leaving group but actually, bromine is a deactivating, ortho/para-directing group because it's an electron-withdrawing substituent.

Wait, now I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think: when you have multiple substituents, the strongest directing group (the one that is most activating) will dominate. But if all substituents are deactivating, the most powerful (strongest) deactivating group may dominate.

Wait, the nitro group is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. If a ring has both a nitro and a bromine, the nitro is more deactivating, so perhaps it would dominate. But in our scenario, after step ii, the ring has a ketone (meta director) and bromine (ortho/para). 

Wait, when nitration is performed on acetophenone brominated at position 3, the nitro group would enter where?

So, in acetophenone, the ketone is at 1. Bromine is at 3. Now, when nitrating, the existing substituents are ketone (meta) and bromine (ortho/para).

So the nitration would be directed by both. Since the ketone is a meta director and bromine is an ortho/para director, but which effect is stronger? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is in a position that allows the nitration to occur in a certain position.

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the target again. The target has nitro at position 5 and bromine at position 3, with ketone at 1.

Let me imagine the ring:

1: ketone

3: bromine

5: nitro

So, after acylation, bromination, and nitration steps, the substituents should end up in these positions.

But wait, in the initial approach, if I first do acylation, then bromination (which would add at 3), then nitration (which would add where? Let's see.)

After acylation and bromination, the ring has ketone at 1, Br at 3.

Now, during nitration, where does the nitro group go?

The ketone is a meta director, so it would direct to positions 3 and 5, but 3 is already taken by Br. The bromine is an ortho/para director, so it would direct to positions 2, 4, and 6.

Wait, the nitro group would be directed by the strongest influence. Since both substituents are deactivating, the stronger director (the one that's more powerful) would dominate.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration would occur at position 5, which is meta to the ketone and para to the bromine. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration would occur at position 5 because it's meta to the ketone and para to the bromine. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the position 5 is meta to the ketone (position 1) and para to the bromine (position 3). So if the ketone directs the nitro to 5, that's where it would go. So after nitration, the nitro is at 5.

So that would give us the desired product.

But wait, is that possible? So steps would be:

i) Acetophenone (ketone at 1)

ii) Bromination → Br at 3.

iii) Nitration → nitro at 5.

So the substituents are at 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro). That matches the target.

But wait, looking at the options, none of the options have this exact sequence. Let's check the options again.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. So after this, acetophenone has Br at 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. So in this step, the nitro group would be added where?

If the nitro group is added in position 5, then the substituents would be correct. But after acylation and bromination, would nitration add at 5?

I'm not sure, because the ring now has two substituents: a ketone (meta) and a Br (ortho/para). So which directs more?

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration would happen at position 5 because that's meta to the ketone.

So if that's the case, then option A would produce the desired product.

But wait, option A continues with more steps, like iv) Fe/HCl, which might be a reducing step. But the target doesn't have any other substituents, so I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps after the first three steps (acylation, bromination, nitration), the target is achieved. So why do the options have more steps?

Looking back, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So it requires the ketone, 3-bromo, and 5-nitro. So the reaction steps would be: acylation, bromination, nitration. But if the order is acylation, then bromination, then nitration, is that correct?

Wait, but in option A, after acylation and bromination (steps i and ii), the nitration (step iii) is done. Then comes step iv: Fe and HCl. Fe in HCl is typically used for reducing nitro groups to amino, but that's not desired here. So perhaps option A isn't the correct sequence because it includes steps beyond what's needed.

Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check all the options.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination of benzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4 → another nitration?

Wait, that would result in two nitro groups, which isn't the case in the target.

Option C:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction of nitro to amine?

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

iv) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

Hmm, nitration first. Benzene would get a nitro group. Then, Fe/HCl is likely a reduction step, converting nitro to amine. Then acylation. Then bromination.

But the target has nitro, so this might not be the case. Unless after acylation, the nitro group is introduced again. But that seems unlikely.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduction of nitro to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → nitrous acid conditions, perhaps diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → reduction, maybe to form aniline or something else.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acylation.

vii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again.

This seems like a more complicated sequence, possibly introducing multiple groups, which may not lead to the desired product.

So perhaps option A's steps are i, ii, iii, but then why does it have more steps?

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So perhaps after the initial steps of acylation, bromination, and nitration, we're done. But the options have more steps. So perhaps I'm missing something in the reaction sequences.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Maybe the nitro group is added before bromine.

Wait, let's try another approach. Suppose we first nitrate benzene, then brominate, then acylate.

So step 1: nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

Step 2: brominate nitrobenzene → would add Br in meta relative to nitro, so position 4 (if nitro is at 1, then Br at 3 or 5. Wait, no, nitro at 1, meta would be 3 and 5.

Wait, but then step 3 is acylation. But if the ring has nitro and Br substituents, will acylation proceed? Because nitro is a deactivating group, making the ring less reactive towards Friedel-Crafts acylation.

So that approach might not work.

So maybe the correct sequence is acylation first, then nitration, then bromination.

But wait, after acylation, the ring is acetophenone. Then nitration would add nitro group at position 3. Then bromination would add Br at position 5.

So the substituents are 1 (ketone), 3 (nitro), 5 (Br). Wait, but the target is 3-bromo-5-nitro, meaning Br is at 3 and nitro at 5. So my earlier assumption might have been wrong.

Wait, let me think again. The target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl. So the substituents are at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (nitro) relative to the ketone (position 1). So in that case, after acylation, nitration would add nitro at position 5, and bromination would add Br at position 3.

Wait, that's the opposite of what I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the numbering. Let me think: the target is 3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl. So the phenyl group attached to the ethan-1-one has a Br at position 3 and a nitro at position 5. So, in the benzene ring, the ketone is attached at position 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5.

So the substituents are 1 (COCH3), 3 (Br), 5 (NO2).

So how to get both substituents in the correct positions.

Another approach: perhaps nitration occurs first, then bromination, then acylation.

Wait, but again, if I nitrate benzene, get nitrobenzene. Then brominate, adding Br in the meta position relative to nitro → position 5. Then, can I acylate? Probably not because nitro is deactivating. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe I should do acylation, then bromination, then nitration. Let's see.

Step 1: acetophenone → position 1.

Step 2: brominate → Br adds at position 3 (meta to ketone).

Step 3: nitrate → where does nitro go? The ketone is meta director, and Br is ortho/para director. So nitration would be directed by which group?

If the ring has Br at 3 (ortho/para) and ketone at 1 (meta), the nitro would be added where?

Let me imagine the ring: 1 is ketone, 3 is Br.

Nitration would be directed by both. The Br (at 3) is an ortho/para director, so possible positions are 2,4,6.

The ketone (1) is a meta director, so nitro would go to 4 and 6.

Wait, perhaps the nitration would occur at position 5, but that's not adjacent to either. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group would be added at position 5, which is meta to the ketone (position 1) and para to the Br (position 3). But how does that happen? Because the existing substituents are at 1 and 3.

Wait, maybe the nitro group would be added at position 5 because it's meta to the ketone. Let me see:

In acetophenone brominated at 3, the ring has groups at 1 (COCH3) and 3 (Br). When nitrating, the ketone is a meta director, so it would direct incoming nitro to positions 4 and 6. The Br at 3 is an ortho/para director, so it would direct to positions 2,4,6.

So the possible positions for nitration are 4 and 6 (from ketone) and 2,4,6 (from Br). The overlapping positions are 4 and 6.

So which of these positions is favored? It's possible that the nitro group ends up at position 5, but that's not overlapping.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to think about the options and see which sequence would lead to the correct substituents.

Looking at option A:

i) Acetophenone.

ii) Bromination: Br at 3.

iii) Nitration: would go to position 5, which is meta to the ketone.

So the substituents would be 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro). That's the target!

But option A continues with step iv) Fe/HCl. That's a reducing agent. Fe in HCl is typically for reducing nitro groups to amines. But in our target, we have a nitro group, so reducing it would change it to an amine, which is not desired. So perhaps option A isn't the correct one, as it includes steps beyond what's needed.

Wait, but the target is achieved after steps i, ii, iii. So why is step iv present in all the options?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps. Let me re-examine each option.

Option A: The steps after i, ii, iii are iv) Fe/HCl, v) HNO3/H2SO4, vi) NaNO2/HCl, vii) H3PO2.

I don't see why those would be needed, unless perhaps the steps are to modify substituents in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a step to introduce another group. But the target has only three substituents: ketone, Br, nitro.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that I'm considering only three substitution steps, but the options have more steps, perhaps implying that more than three substituents are added.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility of introducing the nitro group before the bromine. Let's think:

Step i: Acetophenone → ketone at 1.

Step ii: Nitration → nitro at position 5 (meta to ketone).

Step iii: bromination → Br at position 3.

This would give the target structure. But looking at the options, which one follows this sequence?

Looking at the options, option A's step iii is nitration after acylation and bromination. So that's the order I was thinking earlier. But in option A, after that, there are more steps.

Wait, perhaps the other steps are for introducing another group, but the target doesn't have any. So maybe the correct sequence is only the first three steps, but the options include all steps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should look for a sequence where the nitro and bromo groups are introduced in the correct order.

Wait, let's think about the possible directing effects again.

Another possibility: The nitro group is introduced second, but after bromine.

So, first acylation (ketone at 1).

Then bromination (Br at 3).

Then nitration (nitro at 5). So that's the correct order.

So in which option does this happen? Let's check the options.

Option A: i) acylation, ii) bromination, iii) nitration. That's the sequence I'm thinking. So that would produce the correct product. But the option A has more steps after that. So why are they there?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps. Maybe some steps are for protecting groups or other purposes. Alternatively, perhaps the sequences in the options are longer because they include steps to modify other groups.

Wait, but the target only has three substituents. So perhaps the only steps needed are acylation, bromination, and nitration.

Looking at the options, which one has only those three steps? None of them. Each option has seven steps. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that after nitration, another reaction is needed. For example, sometimes nitration is followed by a reduction step, but in this case, we want to retain the nitro group.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are for the production of a different substituent, but I'm not seeing it.

Another thought: Maybe the nitro group is added after the bromide is introduced via a different pathway.

Wait, perhaps the bromide is introduced via a substitution reaction, but that's not the case here. The bromide is via electrophilic substitution.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is A because it's the only one where acylation is the first step, followed by bromination and then nitration. The other steps might be for something else, but the first three would achieve the correct substituents.

But then why does the target require more steps? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced before the bromine.

Another approach: Let me consider the substituents.

The target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5 relative to ketone. So the substituents are both meta to the ketone.

Wait, perhaps both substituents are introduced via meta direction from the ketone.

So, first acylation (step i), then nitration (step iii), then bromination (step ii). Wait, but that would place nitro and Br both at meta positions, but which would they occupy?

Wait, perhaps in that order, nitration would add at position 3, and bromination at position 5.

Wait, but I'm getting mixed up again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to introduce the nitro group first, then the bromine, then the ketone. But as I thought earlier, that might not work because the ring would be deactivated.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is A: acylation, bromination, nitration.

But I'm not sure why the option includes more steps. Maybe the extra steps are for something else, but the first three steps are the key.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but let's think about the other options.

Option B: i) bromination, ii) nitration, iii) acylation. So first Br is added. Then nitration. Then acylation.

But after bromination and nitration, the ring would have Br and nitro groups, both of which are deactivating. Friedel-Crafts acylation wouldn't proceed because the ring is too deactivated. So option B isn't correct.

Option C: i) nitration, ii) Fe/HCl → reduction to amine, iii) acylation, iv) bromination.

So step i: nitro at position 1.

Step ii: reduces nitro to amine (-NH2 at position 1).

Step iii: acylation. But Friedel-Crafts acylation requires an activating group, and an amine is strongly activating (ortho/para). So acylation would occur at ortho or para to the amine. But the target has the ketone at position 1. So after acylation, the ketone would be at position 1, pushing other substituents elsewhere.

Wait, but the target has substituents at 3 and 5 relative to the ketone. If in option C, after acylation, the substituents are at 1 (ketone), and the amine is at 1 (but wait, step ii reduces nitro to amine, which would be at 1, but then step iii acylation would add the ketone at position 1, which would not be possible because the amine is already there. Or perhaps the acylation would occur at a different position.

Alternatively, perhaps after reduction, the amine is at position 1, and acylation occurs at position 3 or 5. Then bromination would add at another position. But this seems complicated and I'm not sure if it would lead to the correct structure.

Option D: i) nitration, ii) Fe/HCl (reduction), iii) NaNO2/HCl (diazotization), iv) H3PO2 (reduction to amine?), v) Br2/FeBr3 (bromination), vi) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (acetylation), vii) HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration).

This seems to involve multiple steps, including diazotization and reduction, which I don't see how they relate to the target structure. Also, the ketone would be introduced in step vi, but the ring might have other substituents which complicate the reaction.

So, after considering all options, the sequence in option A seems the most plausible, as it introduces the ketone first, then bromine (meta), then nitro (meta to ketone and para to Br). But I'm still a bit confused about the extra steps in the options.

Wait, perhaps the extra steps in option A are for something else, but the first three steps are the key. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something about the reaction conditions.

Wait, another thought: after acylation, bromination, and nitration, the product is correct. The other steps might involve unnecessary reactions, but perhaps the correct option is A because it's the only one where the substituents are added in the correct order.

So, putting it all together, the correct sequence is acylation, bromination, nitration, which is option A.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the ketone group first, followed by the bromine and nitro groups in the appropriate positions. The target molecule has a ketone at position 1, bromine at position 3, and nitro at position 5 relative to the ketone. 

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:  
   - Step i: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group at position 1.  
   - Step ii: Bromination adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the ketone).  
   - Step iii: Nitration adds nitro at position 5 (meta to the ketone and para to the bromine).  
   This sequence correctly places all substituents in the desired positions. However, the option includes additional steps (iv–vii), which are unnecessary for the target product. Despite this, the first three steps are sufficient to achieve the desired structure.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Step i: Bromination of benzene introduces bromine at position 1.  
   - Step ii: Nitration adds nitro at position 3 (meta to bromine).  
   - Step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone.  
   This sequence fails because Friedel-Crafts acylation cannot proceed after bromination and nitration, as the ring becomes deactivated by the nitro group.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Step i: Nitration introduces nitro at position 1.  
   - Step ii: Reduction converts nitro to an amine (-NH₂).  
   - Step iii: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone.  
   - Step iv: Bromination adds bromine.  
   This sequence is problematic because the nitro group is reduced to an amine, which would alter the final structure and make it inconsistent with the target molecule.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Step i: Nitration introduces nitro at position 1.  
   - Step ii: Reduction converts nitro to an amine (-NH₂).  
   - Step iii: Diazotization and reduction produce a different intermediate.  
   - Step iv: Bromination adds bromine.  
   - Step v: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone.  
   - Step vi: Nitration adds another nitro group.  
   This sequence introduces multiple substituents and is overly complex, leading to a structure inconsistent with the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
Option A is the only sequence that introduces the ketone first, followed by bromine and nitro groups in the correct positions. While the additional steps in Option A are unnecessary, the first three steps are sufficient to synthesize the target molecule. Therefore, Option A is the correct choice.
