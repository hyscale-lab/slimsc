Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down. The question involves two reactions and then analyzing the products using HPLC. Hmm, I'll take it step by step.

So, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, right? It's LiAlH4. It's used to reduce carbonyl groups, like ketones and aldehydes. So the starting material is a ketone, hexan-3-one with a methoxy group at the 5th carbon. The configuration is S, so it's a chiral center.

When we reduce a ketone with LAH, it should become a secondary alcohol. So hexan-3-one becomes hexan-3-ol. Wait, but what about the methoxy group? Methoxy is an ether, so I don't think LAH affects that. So the product after LAH would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Then acidic workup—like adding acid, which I think protonates any remaining alcohols or maybe something else, but in this case, the main product is the secondary alcohol.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a milder reducing agent compared to LAH. It typically reduces ketones but not esters or amides. Now, pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups on carbons 2 and 4. So when you reduce this, each ketone will become an alcohol. But wait, NaBH4 is a strong enough to reduce both ketones, but since it's in excess, maybe both get reduced.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)COCH2COCH2CH3? No, wait, no, pentane has five carbons. So 2,4-dione would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? Wait, pentane is five carbons. So positions 2 and 4: so the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, wait, wait. Pentane-2,4-dione would be (CH3)COCH2COCH2CH3? Wait, wait, let me count. The formula is C5H8O2. So for pentane-2,4-dione: the structure is CH3-CO-CH2-CO-O-R? No, no, wait. Pentane is five carbons. So 2 and 4 are the second and fourth carbons. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So it's CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. Oh wait, that makes four carbons? No, no, wait. Let's count: 1(CH3)-2(CO)-3(CH2)-4(CO)-5(CH3). So yes, that's correct. So it's 2,4-pentanedione: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

So when you reduce this with NaBH4, each ketone becomes an alcohol. So each C=O becomes a CH-OH. But wait, in this molecule, each ketone is on either end of a CH2 group. So when reduced, each ketone becomes an alcohol. So the product would be CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So that's 2,4-pentanediol. But wait, does NaBH4 reduce both ketones? I think so, because it can do so in situ, but sometimes steric hindrance might play a role, but in this case, both ketones are in a way that they can be approached. So the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but pentane-2,4-dione is symmetric. So when reduced, the diol will have two secondary alcohols on C2 and C4. So the structure is (CH3)CH(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH3. Hmm, but wait, is that correct? Wait, no, the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, no. Let me think again: the starting material is CH3-C(O)-CH2-C(O)-CH3. After reduction, each C=O becomes CH(OH). So it becomes CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So that's 2,4-pentanediol, which is a vicinal diol? No, vicinal is adjacent, but here the OH groups are on C2 and C4, so they are separated by a CH2 group. So they are not adjacent. So the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but what about the stereochemistry? NaBH4 is a chiral reducing agent? No, wait, NaBH4 is typically a source of BH4-, which is a chiral reducing agent. But in the case of ketones, which are prochiral, the reduction would proceed with inversion or some specific stereochemistry. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is symmetrical. So the two ketones are identical. Therefore, when reduced, each will form an alcohol with the same configuration. But wait, wait—since the starting carbonyl groups are in a symmetrical molecule, would the product have any stereocenters?

Wait, looking at each ketone: each is on a carbon attached to two CH3 groups and a CH2 group. For each ketone, the alpha carbons are CH2. So when the ketone is reduced, each becomes a CH(OH). So each of those carbons (C2 and C4) would have four different groups, making them chiral centers.

Wait, for C2: attached groups are CH3 (from C1), CH(OH) (itself), CH2 (from C3), and another CH(OH) from C4? No, C2 is connected to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and two OH groups? Wait, no, that can't be. Let me see: the original structure: C1 is CH3, C2 is C(O), connected to C1, C3, and another CH3. Wait, no, no. Let me clarify: the structure of pentane-2,4-dione is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So C2 is connected to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and two oxygens (the ketone O's). So when reduced, C2 becomes CH(OH), so what are the groups around C2? CH3 (from C1), CH2 (from C3), OH, and another CH2? No, wait. Wait, C2 is connected to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and two oxygen atoms from the ketone. Wait, no. No, C2 is connected to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and two O's (each from the C=O). So after reduction, C2 will have CH3, CH2, OH, and another atom—what's the fourth? Wait, no. Let me think: the carbon C2 is originally bonded to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and two oxygen atoms (from the carbonyl groups). So when reduced, the carbonyl becomes CH(OH). So the groups attached to C2 become CH3, CH2, OH, and another CH2? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe each C2 and C4 ends up with two identical groups. Because the molecule is symmetric. So both C2 and C4 would have the same substituents.

Wait, perhaps each of these carbons (C2 and C4) becomes a chiral center, but because the molecule is symmetrical, the configuration (R or S) would be the same for both. So when you reduce pentane-2,4-dione with NaBH4, you get a diol where both C2 and C4 are chiral centers, and both have the same configuration. But wait, wait. No, because the reducing agent's approach might generate specific stereochemistry. Let me think: NaBH4 is a source of BH4-, which is a chiral reducing agent, leading to the anti addition of the hydride. So for each ketone, the hydride would add from the less hindered side. But in a symmetrical molecule, both ketones are the same, so the same would happen for each.

But wait, the molecule is symmetrical, so the diol would have two chiral centers, each with the same configuration. So the product would be (R,R) or (S,S) configuration. Alternatively, if the molecule is symmetrical, perhaps the two OH groups end up on the same face, leading to a meso compound. Wait, no, because the molecule is symmetrical, and if both OH groups are on the same face, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

Wait, let's think about the structure. The diol would be CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So if each OH is on the same side of the chain, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between the two OHs. So it would be a meso compound, meaning that the molecule has two chiral centers but is achiral because of the plane of symmetry.

So when we reduce pentane-2,4-dione with NaBH4, the product is a meso compound. So the product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound, so it's not chiral. So when you run this on a chiral HPLC column, it would not separate into enantiomers because it's achiral. But wait, wait, the product is a single compound, but let me verify.

So Reaction I gives (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. That's a single enantiomer because the starting material was (S) configuration at the chiral center, and the reduction doesn't change the configuration. Wait, no. Wait, when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, the configuration is determined by the hydride attack. Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent. Let me think: in the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, the hydride (from LAH) attacks the carbonyl carbon, which is electrophilic. The mechanism is that the carbonyl oxygen is a good leaving group after the addition of the hydride. So the hydride comes from the less hindered side, leading to inversion of configuration in the product. Wait, but in our case, the starting material is a racemic mixture or a single enantiomer? No, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, so it's a single enantiomer.

Wait, when you reduce a chiral ketone, the product's configuration depends on the approach of the hydride. So in the case of an (S)-configured ketone, what happens upon reduction?

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure. Let's imagine hexan-3-one: the carbonyl is at C3. The structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-something. Wait, the original structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

The structure would be: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one means the carbonyl is on C3. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, that can't be right. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one would be CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write it as:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6.

So hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one: so the carbonyl is on C3, and the methoxy is on C5.

So the structure would be: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH2CH2-OCH3)-... Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So if the methoxy is on C5, then the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let's count the carbons.

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, no, that would make the structure as CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. So the full structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. Hmm, but wait, that's six carbons in a row. So the configuration at C5: the central carbon is C5. So the groups attached to C5 would be CH2 (from C4), OCH3, and two other groups. Wait, no, C5 is CH(OCH3), connected to C4 and C6. So the groups are: CH2-C(=O) (from C3?), no, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to draw it mentally as:

The molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the ketone is at position 3. So positions 3 is the carbonyl. Then, position 5 is the methoxy.

So the structure would be:

CH2CH2(C=O) -CH2 -CH(OCH3) - CH2 -CH2CH3?

Wait, but that's 6 carbons. Wait, perhaps:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C(=O)

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)

6: CH2CH3.

Wait, no, that would make it a 6-carbon chain. So the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would make it seven carbons. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong, but perhaps it's not necessary to get the exact structure for this question.

But the key point is that it's a chiral ketone, and upon reduction with LAH, it becomes a secondary alcohol. The configuration might change or remain, depending on the mechanism. Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent, and the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols proceeds via the formation of an alkoxide intermediate. The hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of the alcohol. But in this case, the starting material is (S) configuration. So after reduction, what's the configuration?

Wait, when you reduce a chiral ketone, the configuration at the chiral center can change. Because the hydride attacks from the less hindered side. So if the starting material is (S), the product would be (R), perhaps, but wait, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, considering the mechanism, the hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen becomes an alkoxide. Since the starting material's configuration is S, the attack would occur from the opposite face, leading to inversion of configuration in the product. Or maybe retention?

Wait, maybe I should think about the mechanism. The ketone is (S) configuration. The carbonyl is at C3, and the C5 has the methoxy group. The hydride would attack the carbonyl carbon (C3) from the less hindered side. The configuration at C5 is S, which would influence which side is more hindered. So the hydride would approach from the opposite side of the largest group. So the attack would lead to inversion at the C3. Wait, but the C3's configuration was originally a carbonyl—now it becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product would have a new chiral center at C3, but perhaps with opposite configuration.

Wait, but wait—when you reduce a ketone, the product is a secondary alcohol. The configuration depends on the approach of the hydride. So the starting material's configuration (S) at C5 may not directly influence the configuration at C3. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the product will have a new chiral center at C3 with a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that Reaction I produces a secondary alcohol that's chiral because the starting material was chiral, and the reduction introduces a new chiral center or affects an existing one.

But perhaps the product after Reaction I is a secondary alcohol with a specific configuration. Let me move on for a moment and consider the overall problem.

The two reactions produce products that are then combined. The products are run on both normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC columns.

The question is: how many peaks will the chemist observe in each type of chromatogram?

Let's think about each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → LAH → secondary alcohol → (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, is the configuration at C3 (the new OH) R or S? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product has a new chiral center at C3.

Wait, the starting material is (S) at C5. The reduction adds an OH group at C3. So the product has a new chiral center at C3. So the product (5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) would have two chiral centers: C3 and C5. Wait, no, the starting material is a ketone, so the C3 was a carbonyl (not chiral). After reduction, C3 becomes a chiral center (as it's now a secondary alcohol). The C5 already had a methoxy group and perhaps was a chiral center in the starting material.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So in the starting material, the C5 has four different groups: a CH2 group (from C4), a methoxy (OCH3), a CH2 from C6, and the ketone is at C3, but C5 is connected to C4 (CH2) and C6 (CH2). Wait, perhaps the starting material has a chiral center at C5. So, upon reduction, the C3 becomes a new chiral center. So the product has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

So the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer? Or maybe it's a single enantiomer. Wait, no, the starting material was a single enantiomer (S at C5). After reduction, the product would have two chiral centers: C3 and C5. So the product would be a single diastereomer, but if the configuration at C3 is fixed based on the reduction, or if it's a mixture. Wait, no, because the starting material was a single enantiomer, and the reduction is stereospecific. So the product would be a single diastereomer, but with two chiral centers. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the specifics of the product structure. Let's think about the possible products from both reactions.

Reaction I produces a compound with two chiral centers, assuming the product is a secondary alcohol at C3 and the C5 remains as it was. Or perhaps only C3 becomes a new chiral center. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single chiral molecule.

Reaction II produces a meso compound, which is achiral. Because the product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound.

So when we combine the products from both reactions, we have:

- From Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Let's say this is a single enantiomer, but perhaps with two chiral centers. Or maybe it's a single diastereomer.

Wait, no. Let me think again: the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. After reduction, at C3, a new chiral center is formed. Since the starting material is (S) at C5, and LAH is a strong reducing agent, which would approach the carbonyl from a specific face, leading to a specific configuration at C3.

Wait, but perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, as the starting material was a single enantiomer, and the reduction doesn't introduce new stereocenters but perhaps maintains or inverts.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the reduction of a chiral ketone with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent and typically leads to retention of configuration because it adds the hydride from the same face as the leaving group. Or wait, no, wait: LAH is a strong enough reducing agent that it can cause inversion. Wait, no, perhaps the mechanism is such that the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon from the less hindered side, leading to inversion, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration at C5 remains S, and the new chiral center at C3 is R or S. But perhaps the product is a single stereoisomer.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's focus on the number of products:

From Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → treated with LAH → becomes (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Now, does this product have any chiral centers?

In the starting material, the C5 was S. After reduction, the C3 becomes a new chiral center. So the product has two chiral centers: C3 and C5. So the product is a diastereomer, but is the molecule chiral?

Wait, if the molecule has two chiral centers and no plane of symmetry, it's chiral. So the product is a diastereomer, and the molecule is chiral. So if the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer (since the starting was a single enantiomer and the reduction is stereospecific), then Reaction I gives a single product.

Reaction II gives a meso compound, which is not chiral. So when combining the products, we have two compounds: one chiral and one achiral.

Wait, no. Let's think about the number of products.

Reaction I produces a single stereoisomer: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol with a specific configuration at C3 and C5. So it's a single compound.

Reaction II produces 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound. So it's a single compound as well.

So when the products are combined, there are two compounds in total: one chiral (from Reaction I) and one achiral (from Reaction II).

Now, when they're run on normal-phase HPLC and on a chiral HPLC column.

Normal-phase HPLC separates based on polarity. The products are:

- 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: this is a secondary alcohol, relatively polar.
- 2,4-pentanediol: a diol, more polar than the first.

So in normal-phase HPLC, which is silica-based and elutes with more polar solvents later, the more polar compounds will elute later. So if 2,4-pentanediol is more polar than the alcohol, it would elute later. So normal-phase would show two peaks: one for each product.

But wait, wait. Are the two products different in terms of their retention times? Yes, because they're structurally different. So normal-phase HPLC would show two peaks.

Now, for the chiral HPLC column. Chiral columns are designed to separate enantiomers. So if a compound is chiral, it will have two peaks (enantiomers), but if it's achiral, only one peak.

In our case, the product from Reaction I is chiral (has two chiral centers, and is a single stereoisomer). Wait, no: the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer, but is it a pair of enantiomers or a diastereomer?

Wait, no. The product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer, so it will elute as a single peak on a chiral column. Because it's not a pair of enantiomers but a single molecule, it would be a single peak.

Wait, but wait: the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, but is it a single enantiomer or a pair? Let me clarify.

In Reaction I, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. After reduction, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two chiral centers: C3 and C5. So the product is a single stereoisomer. Since it's not a meso compound, it's chiral, so it would have a pair of enantiomers. But since only one enantiomer is present, it would only show as a single peak on a chiral column.

Wait, but no. The product is a single stereoisomer, so it's only one enantiomer. So when run on a chiral column, it would show as a single peak.

Wait, no, because the chiral column can distinguish enantiomers. If the compound is chiral, the column would cause the enantiomers to elute at different times, but if you have only one enantiomer, it would produce a single peak.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture, but no, the starting material was a single enantiomer, and the reaction is stereospecific, so the product is a single enantiomer.

So in the chiral column, each chiral compound would produce a certain number of peaks.

Wait, the product from Reaction I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is a chiral molecule. So it would be a single enantiomer. So on a chiral column, it would produce one peak.

The product from Reaction II: 2,4-pentanediol is a meso compound, so it's achiral. On a chiral column, it would also produce one peak because it's not a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but for achiral compounds on a chiral column, how many peaks do they produce? They would interact with the stationary phase in a way that their retention is based on their structure, but since they're not chiral, the column wouldn't separate them from themselves. So each achiral compound would produce a single peak. So in the chiral HPLC, the two products would produce two peaks: one for the chiral product and one for the achiral.

Wait, but wait. The product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, so it would produce a single peak on the chiral column. The product from Reaction II is a meso compound, which is achiral. So it would also produce a single peak on the chiral column, because it's not a pair of enantiomers, but a single compound.

So in total, for the chiral HPLC, two peaks: one for each product.

Wait, but wait. The product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, which is chiral. So the chiral column would separate it as a single peak. The product from Reaction II is achiral, so it would also be a single peak. So the total peaks on chiral HPLC are two.

In normal-phase HPLC, both products are resolved into two peaks.

So the combined products would show two peaks in normal-phase and two peaks in chiral. But looking at the options:

Options are:

A) 5 and 4 → no.

B) 3 and 2 → no, because each reaction gives one product.

C)4 and 2 → no.

D)3 and 3 → no.

Wait, none of the options seem to fit. Because I thought each reaction gives one product, so two total. So in normal-phase, 2 peaks; chiral, 2 peaks.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of products.

Wait, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → reduction to (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So that's one product.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → reduction to 2,4-pentanediol (meso), which is one product.

So the combined products are two. So when run on normal-phase, two peaks. On chiral, two peaks: one for the chiral product, one for the achiral.

But looking at the options, none have 2 and 2. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A)5 and 4 → no.

B)3 and 2 → no.

C)4 and 2 → no.

D)3 and 3 → no.

Hmm. So none of the options match my conclusion. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product. Let me reevaluate.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent that can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Is that a single compound or a pair of enantiomers?

Wait, the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product should be a single enantiomer, hence a single peak on a chiral column.

But perhaps the product has another chiral center.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction produces more than one product because it's a reduction that can result in different stereoisomers. But LAH is a strong reducing agent, and the reaction is stereospecific. So if the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would be a single enantiomer.

So Reaction I gives one product. Reaction II gives one product. So two products total.

But looking at the options, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction II is not a meso compound. Let me reevaluate.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione reduced with excess NaBH4. So the product is 2,4-pentanediol. Is this a meso compound?

Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C4), each with OH groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C4. Therefore, it's a meso compound, so it's achiral. So the product is a single compound, which is achiral.

So when combined, we have two products: one chiral and one achiral.

So in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, the chiral product would elute as a single peak, and the achiral product as a single peak. So two peaks in total.

But the options don't include two peaks in either. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in determining how many products each reaction gives.

Wait, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → after LAH → 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So only one product.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → after NaBH4 → 2,4-pentanediol (meso). So one product.

Thus, two products in total.

So when combined, on normal-phase HPLC, two peaks. On chiral HPLC, two peaks.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the number of products. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces two products. How?

Wait, LAH can sometimes cause elimination if there's a possibility, but in this case, it's a simple ketone with adjacent groups. So perhaps the product is a single alcohol.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider if the starting material is a racemic mixture, but no, the question states it's (S) configuration.

Wait, perhaps the reaction produces more than one product because the starting material is a diastereomer. No, the starting material is a single enantiomer.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers. How?

No, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reduction is stereospecific, so the product would be a single enantiomer.

Wait, maybe I should think about the exact structures again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → reduction → 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Assuming the structure is: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → (after reduction) → (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Now, the product has two chiral centers: C5 (from the starting material) and C3 (newly formed).

Wait, the configuration at C5 remains S, and C3 becomes R or S. So the product is a diastereomer, but it's a single stereoisomer.

So the product is a single compound, chiral.

Reaction II gives a single, achiral compound.

So when combined, two compounds: chiral and achiral.

Thus, on normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

On chiral HPLC: the chiral compound is a single peak, and the achiral is a single peak. So two peaks.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the products from each reaction are more than one. Let me consider.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → LAH → 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, could LAH cause elimination here, forming an alkene? No, because the reaction conditions are for reduction, and LAH is a strong enough reducing agent to favor reduction over elimination. So the product is the alcohol.

So Reaction I gives a single product.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → NaBH4 → 2,4-pentanediol (meso). So a single product.

So two products in total.

Thus, in normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

In chiral HPLC: two peaks (one for each compound).

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the reaction products wrong. Let me think again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → LAH → 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Structure: CH2-CH2-C(OH)H-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the product is a secondary alcohol, which is a single compound.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → NaBH4 → 2,4-pentanediol (meso).

So the products are two. So when combined, they would give two peaks on normal-phase and two on chiral.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the products are more than two.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers. No, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product is a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, not an enantiomer, but since the product is a single stereoisomer, it's chiral, but the question is about how many peaks on a chiral column.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture. No, the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product can't be racemic.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A)5 and 4 → No.

B)3 and 2 → No.

C)4 and 2 → No.

D)3 and 3 → No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of stereoisomers. Let me think about each product's possible stereoisomers.

Reaction I: product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. How many stereoisomers are possible?

The molecule has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

C3: after reduction, becomes a chiral center.

C5: was a chiral center in the starting material (S), and perhaps remains so.

So the product could have four stereoisomers in total (2^2 =4), but since the starting material was (S) at C5, and the reaction is stereospecific, the product would have one specific stereochemistry at C3 and C5.

Wait, but the starting material's configuration at C5 is S, but when reduced, the configuration at C3 could be R or S, depending on the approach of the hydride.

So the product would have two chiral centers, but only one possible stereoisomer based on the reaction's stereospecificity.

So the product is a single stereoisomer, hence a single peak on a chiral column.

Reaction II's product is a meso compound, so a single peak on a chiral column.

So two peaks on the chiral column.

In normal-phase, two peaks.

But options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I've overlooked something. Let me think about the actual products.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → LAH → 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

So the product has two chiral centers: C3 and C5. So it's a diastereomer, but not a meso compound because the two chiral centers are not mirror images. So the product is chiral.

So on a chiral column, it would produce a single peak, because it's a single enantiomer.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → NaBH4 → 2,4-pentanediol (meso), which is achiral. So on a chiral column, it would produce a single peak.

So in total, two peaks on the chiral column and two on normal phase.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but given the choices, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe Reaction I's product is a pair of enantiomers, but that would require the starting material to be racemic, which isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, but there are more products, such as elimination products. But under LAH conditions, it's a strong reducing agent, so elimination is less likely.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction II is not a meso compound. Let me think again.

If pentane-2,4-dione is reduced, the product is 2,4-pentanediol. If the molecule is symmetrical, the product is a meso compound. So it's achiral. Thus, only one product.

So, combining, two products. So on both HPLC columns, two peaks.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the options again.

Option B is 3 and 2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product. Let me think: Could the reduction lead to more than one product? For example, if the molecule could form more than one stereoisomer. But no, the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reduction is stereospecific, so the product would be a single stereoisomer.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, but the product has two chiral centers, and the question is how many peaks would it produce in a chiral column. Since the product is a single stereoisomer, it's a single compound, so one peak.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think of the possible answer based on the options.

The products from the two reactions are:

- Reaction I: chiral compound (single stereoisomer)
- Reaction II: achiral compound (meso)

So when run on normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

On chiral HPLC: the chiral product is a single peak, the achiral is a single peak. So two peaks.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the question is considering that the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, but that would require the starting material to be racemic, which it isn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of diastereomers. But no, the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product is a single diastereomer.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer but with the same molecular weight, but that's not relevant for the number of peaks.

I'm really stuck here. Since none of the options fit, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, another approach: the number of peaks in each HPLC corresponds to the number of distinct compounds.

So for normal-phase HPLC, each distinct compound would be a peak. So two peaks.

For chiral HPLC, each chiral compound (enantiomer) would be a peak. So:

- Reaction I: chiral → 1 peak (since it's a single enantiomer)
- Reaction II: achiral → 1 peak

Total: 2 peaks.

But options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers. But that would require the starting material to be racemic, which it's not. So that's not the case.

Hmm. I'm not sure, but perhaps the correct answer is B) 3 and 2. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, and when combined with the product from Reaction II, it's a pair of diastereomers.

No, because Reaction II's product is achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps I've miscalculated the number of products.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product is a diastereomer with multiple stereoisomers.

But no, the starting material was a single enantiomer, so the product is a single stereoisomer.

Hmm. At this point, given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess.

The correct answer is likely option B: 3 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal-phase. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the products are more than two.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product is a diastereomer, but since it's a single stereoisomer, it's a single peak on chiral.

Reaction II's product is a meso compound, which is a single peak.

So 2 peaks on chiral, 2 on normal. But no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single compound, and the product from Reaction II is a pair of diastereomers. No, because Reaction II's product is a meso compound.

I'm stuck, so I'll go with the initial thought that each reaction gives one product, leading to two peaks in each HPLC. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I has two chiral centers, leading to four possible stereoisomers. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product will have two chiral centers, but only one possible stereoisomer. So the product is a single peak on normal and chiral.

Reaction II's product is a single peak.

So total: two peaks on each HPLC. But no option has this.

Given this confusion, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 3 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that Reaction I's product is a racemic mixture, but that's not possible because the starting material is chiral.

Another possibility: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single compound, and the product from Reaction II is a pair of enantiomers. No, because Reaction II's product is a meso compound, which is achiral.

I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

But I'm really not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C)4 and 2.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer with two stereoisomers. No, because the starting material is a single enantiomer.

I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves analyzing the products of two reactions and determining the number of peaks observed in normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC columns.

### Reaction I:
- **Starting Material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.
- **Reagent**: LAH (a strong reducing agent).
- **Product**: Reduction of the ketone at C3 introduces a secondary alcohol, resulting in 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reduction is stereospecific, so the product is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers (C3 and C5). This product is chiral.

### Reaction II:
- **Starting Material**: Pentane-2,4-dione.
- **Reagent**: NaBH4 (a mild reducing agent).
- **Product**: Reduction of both ketones at C2 and C4 results in 2,4-pentanediol. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the product is a meso compound, which is achiral.

### Combined Products:
- **From Reaction I**: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral, single stereoisomer).
- **From Reaction II**: 2,4-pentanediol (achiral, meso compound).

### Analysis of HPLC Results:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**:
   - Separates compounds based on polarity.
   - The two products (5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and 2,4-pentanediol) are structurally distinct and have different polarities.
   - **Expected Peaks**: 2 peaks.

2. **Chiral HPLC**:
   - Separates enantiomers. A chiral column will not separate achiral compounds.
   - 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is chiral and will elute as a single peak (since it is a single stereoisomer).
   - 2,4-pentanediol is achiral and will elute as a single peak.
   - **Expected Peaks**: 2 peaks.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (5 and 4)**: Incorrect. The number of peaks does not match the expected results.
- **Option B (3 and 2)**: Incorrect. The number of peaks does not align with the analysis.
- **Option C (4 and 2)**: Incorrect. The number of peaks does not match the expected results.
- **Option D (3 and 3)**: Incorrect. The number of peaks does not align with the analysis.

### Conclusion:
The analysis suggests that both HPLC columns should produce 2 peaks each. However, none of the provided options match this result. Based on the reasoning provided, the closest plausible answer is **Option B (3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC)**, though this does not fully align with the detailed reasoning.

Answer: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let me try to break it down. The question involves two reactions and then analyzing the products using HPLC. Hmm, I'll take it step by step.

So, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH followed by an acidic workup. LAH is a strong reducing agent, right? It's LiAlH4. It's used to reduce carbonyl groups, like ketones and aldehydes. So the starting material is a ketone, hexan-3-one with a methoxy group at the 5th carbon. The configuration is S, so it's a chiral center.

When we reduce a ketone with LAH, it should become a secondary alcohol. So hexan-3-one becomes hexan-3-ol. Wait, but what about the methoxy group? Methoxy is an ether, so I don't think LAH affects that. So the product after LAH would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Then acidic workup—like adding acid, which I think protonates any remaining alcohols or maybe something else, but in this case, the main product is the secondary alcohol.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione is treated with excess NaBH4 followed by an acidic workup. NaBH4 is a milder reducing agent compared to LAH. It typically reduces ketones but not esters or amides. Now, pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups on carbons 2 and 4. So when you reduce this, each ketone will become an alcohol. But wait, NaBH4 is a strong enough to reduce both ketones, but since it's in excess, maybe both get reduced.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)COCH2COCH2CH3? No, wait, no, pentane has five carbons. So 2,4-dione would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? Wait, pentane is five carbons. So positions 2 and 4: so the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, wait, wait. Pentane-2,4-dione would be (CH3)COCH2COCH2CH3? Wait, wait, let me count. The formula is C5H8O2. So for pentane-2,4-dione: the structure is CH3-CO-CH2-CO-O-R? No, no, wait. Pentane is five carbons. So 2 and 4 are the second and fourth carbons. So positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. So it's CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. Oh wait, that makes four carbons? No, no, wait. Let's count: 1(CH3)-2(CO)-3(CH2)-4(CO)-5(CH3). So yes, that's correct. So it's 2,4-pentanedione: CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

So when you reduce this with NaBH4, each ketone becomes an alcohol. So each C=O becomes a CH-OH. But wait, in this molecule, each ketone is on either end of a CH2 group. So when reduced, each ketone becomes an alcohol. So the product would be CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So that's 2,4-pentanediol. But wait, does NaBH4 reduce both ketones? I think so, because it can do so in situ, but sometimes steric hindrance might play a role, but in this case, both ketones are in a way that they can be approached. So the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but pentane-2,4-dione is symmetric. So when reduced, the diol will have two secondary alcohols on C2 and C4. So the structure is (CH3)CH(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH3. Hmm, but wait, is that correct? Wait, no, the structure would be CH2(OH)CH2CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, no. Let me think again: the starting material is CH3-C(O)-CH2-C(O)-CH3. After reduction, each C=O becomes CH(OH). So it becomes CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So that's 2,4-pentanediol, which is a vicinal diol? No, vicinal is adjacent, but here the OH groups are on C2 and C4, so they are separated by a CH2 group. So they are not adjacent. So the product is 2,4-pentanediol.

Wait, but what about the stereochemistry? NaBH4 is a chiral reducing agent? No, wait, NaBH4 is typically a source of BH4-, which is a chiral reducing agent. But in the case of ketones, which are prochiral, the reduction would proceed with inversion or some specific stereochemistry. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is symmetrical. So the two ketones are identical. Therefore, when reduced, each will form an alcohol with the same configuration. But wait, wait—since the starting carbonyl groups are in a symmetrical molecule, would the product have any stereocenters?

Wait, looking at each ketone: each is on a carbon attached to two CH3 groups and a CH2 group. For each ketone, the alpha carbons are CH2. So when the ketone is reduced, each becomes a CH(OH). So each of those carbons (C2 and C4) would have four different groups, making them chiral centers.

Wait, for C2: attached groups are CH3 (from C1), CH(OH) (itself), CH2 (from C3), and another CH(OH) from C4? No, C2 is connected to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and two OH groups? Wait, no, that can't be. Let me see: the original structure: C1 is CH3, C2 is C(O), connected to C1, C3, and another CH3. Wait, no, no. Let me clarify: the structure of pentane-2,4-dione is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. So C2 is connected to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and two oxygens (the ketone O's). So when reduced, C2 becomes CH(OH), so what are the groups around C2? CH3 (from C1), CH2 (from C3), OH, and another CH2? No, wait. Wait, C2 is connected to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and two oxygen atoms from the ketone. Wait, no. No, C2 is connected to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and two O's (each from the C=O). So after reduction, C2 will have CH3, CH2, OH, and another atom—what's the fourth? Wait, no. Let me think: the carbon C2 is originally bonded to C1 (CH3), C3 (CH2), and two oxygen atoms (from the carbonyl groups). So when reduced, the carbonyl becomes CH(OH). So the groups attached to C2 become CH3, CH2, OH, and another CH2? Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe each C2 and C4 ends up with two identical groups. Because the molecule is symmetric. So both C2 and C4 would have the same substituents.

Wait, perhaps each of these carbons (C2 and C4) becomes a chiral center, but because the molecule is symmetrical, the configuration (R or S) would be the same for both. So when you reduce pentane-2,4-dione with NaBH4, you get a diol where both C2 and C4 are chiral centers, and both have the same configuration. But wait, wait. No, because the reducing agent's approach might generate specific stereochemistry. Let me think: NaBH4 is a source of BH4-, which is a chiral reducing agent, leading to the anti addition of the hydride. So for each ketone, the hydride would add from the less hindered side. But in a symmetrical molecule, both ketones are the same, so the same would happen for each.

But wait, the molecule is symmetrical, so the diol would have two chiral centers, each with the same configuration. So the product would be (R,R) or (S,S) configuration. Alternatively, if the molecule is symmetrical, perhaps the two OH groups end up on the same face, leading to a meso compound. Wait, no, because the molecule is symmetrical, and if both OH groups are on the same face, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

Wait, let's think about the structure. The diol would be CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So if each OH is on the same side of the chain, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between the two OHs. So it would be a meso compound, meaning that the molecule has two chiral centers but is achiral because of the plane of symmetry.

So when we reduce pentane-2,4-dione with NaBH4, the product is a meso compound. So the product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound, so it's not chiral. So when you run this on a chiral HPLC column, it would not separate into enantiomers because it's achiral. But wait, wait, the product is a single compound, but let me verify.

So Reaction I gives (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. That's a single enantiomer because the starting material was (S) configuration at the chiral center, and the reduction doesn't change the configuration. Wait, no. Wait, when you reduce a ketone to an alcohol, the configuration is determined by the hydride attack. Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent. Let me think: in the reduction of a ketone to an alcohol, the hydride (from LAH) attacks the carbonyl carbon, which is electrophilic. The mechanism is that the carbonyl oxygen is a good leaving group after the addition of the hydride. So the hydride comes from the less hindered side, leading to inversion of configuration in the product. Wait, but in our case, the starting material is a racemic mixture or a single enantiomer? No, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, so it's a single enantiomer.

Wait, when you reduce a chiral ketone, the product's configuration depends on the approach of the hydride. So in the case of an (S)-configured ketone, what happens upon reduction?

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure. Let's imagine hexan-3-one: the carbonyl is at C3. The structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-something. Wait, the original structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

The structure would be: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no. Let me think again. Hexan-3-one means the carbonyl is on C3. So the structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, that can't be right. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hexan-3-one would be CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write it as:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6.

So hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Hmm, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one: so the carbonyl is on C3, and the methoxy is on C5.

So the structure would be: CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(CH2CH2-OCH3)-... Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So if the methoxy is on C5, then the structure is:

CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Let's count the carbons.

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 6: CH3.

Wait, no, that would make the structure as CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. So the full structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3. Hmm, but wait, that's six carbons in a row. So the configuration at C5: the central carbon is C5. So the groups attached to C5 would be CH2 (from C4), OCH3, and two other groups. Wait, no, C5 is CH(OCH3), connected to C4 and C6. So the groups are: CH2-C(=O) (from C3?), no, wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Maybe it's better to draw it mentally as:

The molecule is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the ketone is at position 3. So positions 3 is the carbonyl. Then, position 5 is the methoxy.

So the structure would be:

CH2CH2(C=O) -CH2 -CH(OCH3) - CH2 -CH2CH3?

Wait, but that's 6 carbons. Wait, perhaps:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C(=O)

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)

6: CH2CH3.

Wait, no, that would make it a 6-carbon chain. So the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that would make it seven carbons. Hmm. Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong, but perhaps it's not necessary to get the exact structure for this question.

But the key point is that it's a chiral ketone, and upon reduction with LAH, it becomes a secondary alcohol. The configuration might change or remain, depending on the mechanism. Wait, LAH is a strong reducing agent, and the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols proceeds via the formation of an alkoxide intermediate. The hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, leading to the formation of the alcohol. But in this case, the starting material is (S) configuration. So after reduction, what's the configuration?

Wait, when you reduce a chiral ketone, the configuration at the chiral center can change. Because the hydride attacks from the less hindered side. So if the starting material is (S), the product would be (R), perhaps, but wait, I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, considering the mechanism, the hydride adds to the carbonyl carbon, and the oxygen becomes an alkoxide. Since the starting material's configuration is S, the attack would occur from the opposite face, leading to inversion of configuration in the product. Or maybe retention?

Wait, maybe I should think about the mechanism. The ketone is (S) configuration. The carbonyl is at C3, and the C5 has the methoxy group. The hydride would attack the carbonyl carbon (C3) from the less hindered side. The configuration at C5 is S, which would influence which side is more hindered. So the hydride would approach from the opposite side of the largest group. So the attack would lead to inversion at the C3. Wait, but the C3's configuration was originally a carbonyl—now it becomes a secondary alcohol. So the product would have a new chiral center at C3, but perhaps with opposite configuration.

Wait, but wait—when you reduce a ketone, the product is a secondary alcohol. The configuration depends on the approach of the hydride. So the starting material's configuration (S) at C5 may not directly influence the configuration at C3. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the product will have a new chiral center at C3 with a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that Reaction I produces a secondary alcohol that's chiral because the starting material was chiral, and the reduction introduces a new chiral center or affects an existing one.

But perhaps the product after Reaction I is a secondary alcohol with a specific configuration. Let me move on for a moment and consider the overall problem.

The two reactions produce products that are then combined. The products are run on both normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC columns.

The question is: how many peaks will the chemist observe in each type of chromatogram?

Let's think about each reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → LAH → secondary alcohol → (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, is the configuration at C3 (the new OH) R or S? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product has a new chiral center at C3.

Wait, the starting material is (S) at C5. The reduction adds an OH group at C3. So the product has a new chiral center at C3. So the product (5-methoxyhexan-3-ol) would have two chiral centers: C3 and C5. Wait, no, the starting material is a ketone, so the C3 was a carbonyl (not chiral). After reduction, C3 becomes a chiral center (as it's now a secondary alcohol). The C5 already had a methoxy group and perhaps was a chiral center in the starting material.

Wait, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So in the starting material, the C5 has four different groups: a CH2 group (from C4), a methoxy (OCH3), a CH2 from C6, and the ketone is at C3, but C5 is connected to C4 (CH2) and C6 (CH2). Wait, perhaps the starting material has a chiral center at C5. So, upon reduction, the C3 becomes a new chiral center. So the product has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

So the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer? Or maybe it's a single enantiomer. Wait, no, the starting material was a single enantiomer (S at C5). After reduction, the product would have two chiral centers: C3 and C5. So the product would be a single diastereomer, but if the configuration at C3 is fixed based on the reduction, or if it's a mixture. Wait, no, because the starting material was a single enantiomer, and the reduction is stereospecific. So the product would be a single diastereomer, but with two chiral centers. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck on the specifics of the product structure. Let's think about the possible products from both reactions.

Reaction I produces a compound with two chiral centers, assuming the product is a secondary alcohol at C3 and the C5 remains as it was. Or perhaps only C3 becomes a new chiral center. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single chiral molecule.

Reaction II produces a meso compound, which is achiral. Because the product is 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound.

So when we combine the products from both reactions, we have:

- From Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Let's say this is a single enantiomer, but perhaps with two chiral centers. Or maybe it's a single diastereomer.

Wait, no. Let me think again: the starting material is (S) configuration at C5. After reduction, at C3, a new chiral center is formed. Since the starting material is (S) at C5, and LAH is a strong reducing agent, which would approach the carbonyl from a specific face, leading to a specific configuration at C3.

Wait, but perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, as the starting material was a single enantiomer, and the reduction doesn't introduce new stereocenters but perhaps maintains or inverts.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the reduction of a chiral ketone with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent and typically leads to retention of configuration because it adds the hydride from the same face as the leaving group. Or wait, no, wait: LAH is a strong enough reducing agent that it can cause inversion. Wait, no, perhaps the mechanism is such that the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon from the less hindered side, leading to inversion, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration at C5 remains S, and the new chiral center at C3 is R or S. But perhaps the product is a single stereoisomer.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's focus on the number of products:

From Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → treated with LAH → becomes (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Now, does this product have any chiral centers?

In the starting material, the C5 was S. After reduction, the C3 becomes a new chiral center. So the product has two chiral centers: C3 and C5. So the product is a diastereomer, but is the molecule chiral?

Wait, if the molecule has two chiral centers and no plane of symmetry, it's chiral. So the product is a diastereomer, and the molecule is chiral. So if the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer (since the starting was a single enantiomer and the reduction is stereospecific), then Reaction I gives a single product.

Reaction II gives a meso compound, which is not chiral. So when combining the products, we have two compounds: one chiral and one achiral.

Wait, no. Let's think about the number of products.

Reaction I produces a single stereoisomer: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol with a specific configuration at C3 and C5. So it's a single compound.

Reaction II produces 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound. So it's a single compound as well.

So when the products are combined, there are two compounds in total: one chiral (from Reaction I) and one achiral (from Reaction II).

Now, when they're run on normal-phase HPLC and on a chiral HPLC column.

Normal-phase HPLC separates based on polarity. The products are:

- 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol: this is a secondary alcohol, relatively polar.
- 2,4-pentanediol: a diol, more polar than the first.

So in normal-phase HPLC, which is silica-based and elutes with more polar solvents later, the more polar compounds will elute later. So if 2,4-pentanediol is more polar than the alcohol, it would elute later. So normal-phase would show two peaks: one for each product.

But wait, wait. Are the two products different in terms of their retention times? Yes, because they're structurally different. So normal-phase HPLC would show two peaks.

Now, for the chiral HPLC column. Chiral columns are designed to separate enantiomers. So if a compound is chiral, it will have two peaks (enantiomers), but if it's achiral, only one peak.

In our case, the product from Reaction I is chiral (has two chiral centers, and is a single stereoisomer). Wait, no: the product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer, but is it a pair of enantiomers or a diastereomer?

Wait, no. The product from Reaction I is a single stereoisomer, so it will elute as a single peak on a chiral column. Because it's not a pair of enantiomers but a single molecule, it would be a single peak.

Wait, but wait: the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, but is it a single enantiomer or a pair? Let me clarify.

In Reaction I, the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. After reduction, the product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two chiral centers: C3 and C5. So the product is a single stereoisomer. Since it's not a meso compound, it's chiral, so it would have a pair of enantiomers. But since only one enantiomer is present, it would only show as a single peak on a chiral column.

Wait, but no. The product is a single stereoisomer, so it's only one enantiomer. So when run on a chiral column, it would show as a single peak.

Wait, no, because the chiral column can distinguish enantiomers. If the compound is chiral, the column would cause the enantiomers to elute at different times, but if you have only one enantiomer, it would produce a single peak.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture, but no, the starting material was a single enantiomer, and the reaction is stereospecific, so the product is a single enantiomer.

So in the chiral column, each chiral compound would produce a certain number of peaks.

Wait, the product from Reaction I: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is a chiral molecule. So it would be a single enantiomer. So on a chiral column, it would produce one peak.

The product from Reaction II: 2,4-pentanediol is a meso compound, so it's achiral. On a chiral column, it would also produce one peak because it's not a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but for achiral compounds on a chiral column, how many peaks do they produce? They would interact with the stationary phase in a way that their retention is based on their structure, but since they're not chiral, the column wouldn't separate them from themselves. So each achiral compound would produce a single peak. So in the chiral HPLC, the two products would produce two peaks: one for the chiral product and one for the achiral.

Wait, but wait. The product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, so it would produce a single peak on the chiral column. The product from Reaction II is a meso compound, which is achiral. So it would also produce a single peak on the chiral column, because it's not a pair of enantiomers, but a single compound.

So in total, for the chiral HPLC, two peaks: one for each product.

Wait, but wait. The product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, which is chiral. So the chiral column would separate it as a single peak. The product from Reaction II is achiral, so it would also be a single peak. So the total peaks on chiral HPLC are two.

In normal-phase HPLC, both products are resolved into two peaks.

So the combined products would show two peaks in normal-phase and two peaks in chiral. But looking at the options:

Options are:

A) 5 and 4 → no.

B) 3 and 2 → no, because each reaction gives one product.

C)4 and 2 → no.

D)3 and 3 → no.

Wait, none of the options seem to fit. Because I thought each reaction gives one product, so two total. So in normal-phase, 2 peaks; chiral, 2 peaks.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of products.

Wait, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → reduction to (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So that's one product.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → reduction to 2,4-pentanediol (meso), which is one product.

So the combined products are two. So when run on normal-phase, two peaks. On chiral, two peaks: one for the chiral product, one for the achiral.

But looking at the options, none have 2 and 2. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A)5 and 4 → no.

B)3 and 2 → no.

C)4 and 2 → no.

D)3 and 3 → no.

Hmm. So none of the options match my conclusion. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product. Let me reevaluate.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH. LAH is a strong reducing agent that can reduce ketones to secondary alcohols. So the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Is that a single compound or a pair of enantiomers?

Wait, the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product should be a single enantiomer, hence a single peak on a chiral column.

But perhaps the product has another chiral center.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction produces more than one product because it's a reduction that can result in different stereoisomers. But LAH is a strong reducing agent, and the reaction is stereospecific. So if the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would be a single enantiomer.

So Reaction I gives one product. Reaction II gives one product. So two products total.

But looking at the options, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction II is not a meso compound. Let me reevaluate.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione reduced with excess NaBH4. So the product is 2,4-pentanediol. Is this a meso compound?

Structure: CH3-CH(OH)-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3.

This molecule has two chiral centers (C2 and C4), each with OH groups. The molecule has a plane of symmetry between C2 and C4. Therefore, it's a meso compound, so it's achiral. So the product is a single compound, which is achiral.

So when combined, we have two products: one chiral and one achiral.

So in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

In chiral HPLC, the chiral product would elute as a single peak, and the achiral product as a single peak. So two peaks in total.

But the options don't include two peaks in either. So perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in determining how many products each reaction gives.

Wait, Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → after LAH → 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. So only one product.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → after NaBH4 → 2,4-pentanediol (meso). So one product.

Thus, two products in total.

So when combined, on normal-phase HPLC, two peaks. On chiral HPLC, two peaks.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the number of products. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces two products. How?

Wait, LAH can sometimes cause elimination if there's a possibility, but in this case, it's a simple ketone with adjacent groups. So perhaps the product is a single alcohol.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider if the starting material is a racemic mixture, but no, the question states it's (S) configuration.

Wait, perhaps the reaction produces more than one product because the starting material is a diastereomer. No, the starting material is a single enantiomer.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers. How?

No, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reduction is stereospecific, so the product would be a single enantiomer.

Wait, maybe I should think about the exact structures again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → reduction → 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Assuming the structure is: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → (after reduction) → (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Now, the product has two chiral centers: C5 (from the starting material) and C3 (newly formed).

Wait, the configuration at C5 remains S, and C3 becomes R or S. So the product is a diastereomer, but it's a single stereoisomer.

So the product is a single compound, chiral.

Reaction II gives a single, achiral compound.

So when combined, two compounds: chiral and achiral.

Thus, on normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

On chiral HPLC: the chiral compound is a single peak, and the achiral is a single peak. So two peaks.

But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the products from each reaction are more than one. Let me consider.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → LAH → 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Wait, could LAH cause elimination here, forming an alkene? No, because the reaction conditions are for reduction, and LAH is a strong enough reducing agent to favor reduction over elimination. So the product is the alcohol.

So Reaction I gives a single product.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → NaBH4 → 2,4-pentanediol (meso). So a single product.

So two products in total.

Thus, in normal-phase HPLC: two peaks.

In chiral HPLC: two peaks (one for each compound).

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the reaction products wrong. Let me think again.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → LAH → 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

Structure: CH2-CH2-C(OH)H-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the product is a secondary alcohol, which is a single compound.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → NaBH4 → 2,4-pentanediol (meso).

So the products are two. So when combined, they would give two peaks on normal-phase and two on chiral.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the products are more than two.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers. No, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product is a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, not an enantiomer, but since the product is a single stereoisomer, it's chiral, but the question is about how many peaks on a chiral column.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a racemic mixture. No, the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product can't be racemic.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A)5 and 4 → No.

B)3 and 2 → No.

C)4 and 2 → No.

D)3 and 3 → No.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of stereoisomers. Let me think about each product's possible stereoisomers.

Reaction I: product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. How many stereoisomers are possible?

The molecule has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.

C3: after reduction, becomes a chiral center.

C5: was a chiral center in the starting material (S), and perhaps remains so.

So the product could have four stereoisomers in total (2^2 =4), but since the starting material was (S) at C5, and the reaction is stereospecific, the product would have one specific stereochemistry at C3 and C5.

Wait, but the starting material's configuration at C5 is S, but when reduced, the configuration at C3 could be R or S, depending on the approach of the hydride.

So the product would have two chiral centers, but only one possible stereoisomer based on the reaction's stereospecificity.

So the product is a single stereoisomer, hence a single peak on a chiral column.

Reaction II's product is a meso compound, so a single peak on a chiral column.

So two peaks on the chiral column.

In normal-phase, two peaks.

But options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I've overlooked something. Let me think about the actual products.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one → LAH → 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

So the product has two chiral centers: C3 and C5. So it's a diastereomer, but not a meso compound because the two chiral centers are not mirror images. So the product is chiral.

So on a chiral column, it would produce a single peak, because it's a single enantiomer.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione → NaBH4 → 2,4-pentanediol (meso), which is achiral. So on a chiral column, it would produce a single peak.

So in total, two peaks on the chiral column and two on normal phase.

But none of the options match. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but given the choices, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe Reaction I's product is a pair of enantiomers, but that would require the starting material to be racemic, which isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, but there are more products, such as elimination products. But under LAH conditions, it's a strong reducing agent, so elimination is less likely.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction II is not a meso compound. Let me think again.

If pentane-2,4-dione is reduced, the product is 2,4-pentanediol. If the molecule is symmetrical, the product is a meso compound. So it's achiral. Thus, only one product.

So, combining, two products. So on both HPLC columns, two peaks.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the options again.

Option B is 3 and 2. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I produces more than one product. Let me think: Could the reduction lead to more than one product? For example, if the molecule could form more than one stereoisomer. But no, the starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reduction is stereospecific, so the product would be a single stereoisomer.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, but the product has two chiral centers, and the question is how many peaks would it produce in a chiral column. Since the product is a single stereoisomer, it's a single compound, so one peak.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think of the possible answer based on the options.

The products from the two reactions are:

- Reaction I: chiral compound (single stereoisomer)
- Reaction II: achiral compound (meso)

So when run on normal-phase HPLC, two peaks.

On chiral HPLC: the chiral product is a single peak, the achiral is a single peak. So two peaks.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps the question is considering that the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers, but that would require the starting material to be racemic, which it isn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a pair of diastereomers. But no, the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product is a single diastereomer.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer but with the same molecular weight, but that's not relevant for the number of peaks.

I'm really stuck here. Since none of the options fit, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Wait, another approach: the number of peaks in each HPLC corresponds to the number of distinct compounds.

So for normal-phase HPLC, each distinct compound would be a peak. So two peaks.

For chiral HPLC, each chiral compound (enantiomer) would be a peak. So:

- Reaction I: chiral → 1 peak (since it's a single enantiomer)
- Reaction II: achiral → 1 peak

Total: 2 peaks.

But options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the product from Reaction I is a pair of enantiomers. But that would require the starting material to be racemic, which it's not. So that's not the case.

Hmm. I'm not sure, but perhaps the correct answer is B) 3 and 2. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer, and when combined with the product from Reaction II, it's a pair of diastereomers.

No, because Reaction II's product is achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps I've miscalculated the number of products.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product is a diastereomer with multiple stereoisomers.

But no, the starting material was a single enantiomer, so the product is a single stereoisomer.

Hmm. At this point, given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess.

The correct answer is likely option B: 3 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal-phase. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the products are more than two.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product is a diastereomer, but since it's a single stereoisomer, it's a single peak on chiral.

Reaction II's product is a meso compound, which is a single peak.

So 2 peaks on chiral, 2 on normal. But no option matches.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single compound, and the product from Reaction II is a pair of diastereomers. No, because Reaction II's product is a meso compound.

I'm stuck, so I'll go with the initial thought that each reaction gives one product, leading to two peaks in each HPLC. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I has two chiral centers, leading to four possible stereoisomers. But since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product will have two chiral centers, but only one possible stereoisomer. So the product is a single peak on normal and chiral.

Reaction II's product is a single peak.

So total: two peaks on each HPLC. But no option has this.

Given this confusion, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 3 peaks in chiral and 2 in normal.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that Reaction I's product is a racemic mixture, but that's not possible because the starting material is chiral.

Another possibility: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single compound, and the product from Reaction II is a pair of enantiomers. No, because Reaction II's product is a meso compound, which is achiral.

I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC.

But I'm really not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C)4 and 2.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer with two stereoisomers. No, because the starting material is a single enantiomer.

I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a choice.


The problem involves analyzing the products of two reactions and determining the number of peaks observed in normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC columns.

### Reaction I:
- **Starting Material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.
- **Reagent**: LAH (a strong reducing agent).
- **Product**: Reduction of the ketone at C3 introduces a secondary alcohol, resulting in 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. The starting material is a single enantiomer, and the reduction is stereospecific, so the product is a single stereoisomer with two chiral centers (C3 and C5). This product is chiral.

### Reaction II:
- **Starting Material**: Pentane-2,4-dione.
- **Reagent**: NaBH4 (a mild reducing agent).
- **Product**: Reduction of both ketones at C2 and C4 results in 2,4-pentanediol. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, the product is a meso compound, which is achiral.

### Combined Products:
- **From Reaction I**: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol (chiral, single stereoisomer).
- **From Reaction II**: 2,4-pentanediol (achiral, meso compound).

### Analysis of HPLC Results:
1. **Normal-Phase HPLC**:
   - Separates compounds based on polarity.
   - The two products (5-methoxyhexan-3-ol and 2,4-pentanediol) are structurally distinct and have different polarities.
   - **Expected Peaks**: 2 peaks.

2. **Chiral HPLC**:
   - Separates enantiomers. A chiral column will not separate achiral compounds.
   - 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol is chiral and will elute as a single peak (since it is a single stereoisomer).
   - 2,4-pentanediol is achiral and will elute as a single peak.
   - **Expected Peaks**: 2 peaks.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (5 and 4)**: Incorrect. The number of peaks does not match the expected results.
- **Option B (3 and 2)**: Incorrect. The number of peaks does not align with the analysis.
- **Option C (4 and 2)**: Incorrect. The number of peaks does not match the expected results.
- **Option D (3 and 3)**: Incorrect. The number of peaks does not align with the analysis.

### Conclusion:
The analysis suggests that both HPLC columns should produce 2 peaks each. However, none of the provided options match this result. Based on the reasoning provided, the closest plausible answer is **Option B (3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC)**, though this does not fully align with the detailed reasoning.

Answer: B
