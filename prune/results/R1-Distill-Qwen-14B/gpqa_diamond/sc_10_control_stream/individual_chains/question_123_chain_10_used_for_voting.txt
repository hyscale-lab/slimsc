Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova's ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let me think.

The question says that from the ejecta's frame of reference, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. Both are inertial frames, so no acceleration involved. I need to find out how far the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Wait, wait. I remember something about time dilation and length contraction in special relativity. Oh right, because if one frame is moving relative to another, their measurements of time and distance can differ.

So the scenario is like this: in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards it at v = 60,000 km/s. But in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards the center at the same speed, but time and distance might be different.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me get this straight. The problem is giving me a proper time (or is it? Hmm.) Wait, the time given is 50 seconds in the ejecta's frame. I need to find the distance traveled in the Galaxy's frame. Or wait, no, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let's read it again.

Wait, the question says: What distance does the ejecta travel in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?

Oh, so in the ejecta's frame, 50 seconds pass. But the Galaxy's frame would see a different time because of time dilation. Because the frames are moving relative to each other.

So the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame would be its speed multiplied by the time in that frame. But wait, the time in the Galaxy frame is longer than 50 seconds because the ejecta's clock is moving, so it runs slower from the Galaxy's perspective.

Wait, no. Wait, from the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving towards it at v. So the time elapsed in the Galaxy's frame would be longer than 50 seconds.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the Lorentz transformations. Because the time in one frame is different from the other.

Let me outline the variables:

In the ejecta's frame (let's call it S'), the Galaxy's center is moving towards the ejecta at velocity v = 60,000 km/s. So in S', the time passed is t' = 50 seconds. We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame (S). But wait, how are these distances related?

Wait, no. Wait, in S' (ejecta's frame), the distance might not be directly related. Because in S' (ejecta frame), the Galaxy is moving towards the ejecta. So from S' perspective, the Galaxy is approaching, so the distance between them (if any) is closing at velocity v.

But the problem is, we're to find the distance the ejecta moves in S (Galaxy's frame). So in S, the ejecta is moving towards the center at v, so in S's frame, the distance the ejecta covers is v multiplied by the time t in S's frame.

But how to find t in S when t' is 50 seconds in S'?

So, using the time dilation formula: t = gamma (t' + (v x)/c² ), but wait, maybe I should think in terms of Lorentz transformations.

Alternatively, the time in the Galaxy's frame S is longer than in the ejecta's frame S' because the ejecta's clock is moving relative to S.

Wait, the formula is t = gamma (t' + (v x')/c² ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, for events that happen at the same point in S', perhaps I should use the time dilation formula, which is t = gamma t'.

Wait, but in S', the events (start and end of the 50 seconds) happen at the same place (since the ejecta is in its own rest frame, so the two events are at the same location). So the time in S would be t = gamma t'.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

But wait, v is 60,000 km/s. Let's compute that in terms of the speed of light. The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So v is 0.2c (since 60,000 is 0.2 times 300,000). So v = 0.2c.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So gamma is approximately 1.0206.

So t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Wait, so in Galaxy's frame, 51.03 seconds have passed. Then, the distance the ejecta travels is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 3,060,000 km.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96)

Calculating sqrt(0.96): Let's see, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

So gamma is about 1.0206.

t = 50 * 1.0206 ≈ 51.03 s.

Then distance is v * t.

v = 60,000 km/s.

So 60,000 * 51.03 = ?

60,000 *50 = 3,000,000.

60,000 *1.03 = 61,800.

Total is 3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 3,060,000 km. Close enough, considering possible rounding.

Wait, but another approach: perhaps considering that in S' frame, the ejecta is stationary, and the Galaxy is approaching at v. So, the distance the ejecta travels in S (Galaxy's frame) would be v multiplied by the time in S.

Wait, let me think about it using relative velocity. Let me model this.

In S', the Galaxy is approaching at v. The time elapsed in S' is 50s. So, in S', the distance the ejecta has moved is zero (since it's stationary in its own frame). But wait, no, the problem is about the ejecta moving towards the Galaxy as seen from the Galaxy's frame.

Wait, perhaps I should model it using the velocity addition formula. Or perhaps it's simpler with length contraction.

Wait, in S' frame (ejecta rest), the Galaxy is approaching at v, and the distance between them is L'. So the time it takes for the Galaxy to cover that distance is t' = L'/(v), but wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the distance in S' is L' = L / gamma, considering length contraction.

Wait, no, in special relativity, the length contraction is in the direction of motion. So in the Galaxy's frame (S), the distance is L. In the ejecta's frame (S'), the distance is L' = L / gamma.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try another approach.

We need to find the distance the ejecta travels in S (Galaxy's frame) during t seconds in S. So t is the time in S, which is longer than 50 seconds because of time dilation.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute t = gamma * t', then distance = v * t.

So, using t' =50s, v=0.2c, gamma≈1.0206.

t ≈50 * 1.0206 ≈51.03s.

distance = 60,000 *51.03≈3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km which is the closest. So I think that's the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame using special relativity. The ejecta is moving towards the center of the Galaxy at a speed \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \), which is \( 0.2c \) (where \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \)). The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame is \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \), and we need to determine the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame.

### Key Steps:
1. **Time Dilation**: In special relativity, the time in the Galaxy's frame (\( t \)) is related to the time in the ejecta's frame (\( t' \)) by the Lorentz factor:
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]
   where
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 0.2c \):
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.2)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   t = \gamma t' = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}
   \]

2. **Distance Traveled**: In the Galaxy's frame, the distance the ejecta travels is given by:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = v \cdot t
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t = 51.03 \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 60,000 \times 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}
   \]

3. **Comparison with Options**: The closest option to the calculated distance is:
   \[
   \text{Option D: } 3,060,000 \, \text{km}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \), which matches option D.

Wait, but in S', the events (start and end of the 50 seconds) happen at the same place (since the ejecta is in its own rest frame, so the two events are at the same location). So the time in S would be t = gamma t'.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

But wait, v is 60,000 km/s. Let's compute that in terms of the speed of light. The speed of light is approximately 300,000 km/s. So v is 0.2c (since 60,000 is 0.2 times 300,000). So v = 0.2c.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So gamma is approximately 1.0206.

So t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds.

Wait, so in Galaxy's frame, 51.03 seconds have passed. Then, the distance the ejecta travels is v * t = 60,000 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 60,000 * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: 3,060,000 km.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96)

Calculating sqrt(0.96): Let's see, sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

So gamma is about 1.0206.

t = 50 * 1.0206 ≈ 51.03 s.

Then distance is v * t.

v = 60,000 km/s.

So 60,000 * 51.03 = ?

60,000 *50 = 3,000,000.

60,000 *1.03 = 61,800.

Total is 3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options:

Option D is 3,060,000 km. Close enough, considering possible rounding.

So, perhaps the correct approach is to compute t = gamma * t', then distance = v * t.

So, using t' =50s, v=0.2c, gamma≈1.0206.

t ≈50 * 1.0206 ≈51.03s.

distance = 60,000 *51.03≈3,061,800 km.

Looking at the options, option D is 3,060,000 km which is the closest. So I think that's the correct answer.
