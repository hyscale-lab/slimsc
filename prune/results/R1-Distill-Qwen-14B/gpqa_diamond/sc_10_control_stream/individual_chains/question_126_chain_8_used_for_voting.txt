Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The question involves two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II, each starting with different compounds. The products are then combined and analyzed using normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC. The task is to determine how many peaks appear in each type of chromatogram.

First, I'll tackle Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce carbonyl groups. Hexan-3-one has a ketone group at position 3. So, when reduced, the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. The structure of the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3? Wait, wait, no. Let me draw it properly.

Hexan-3-one means the ketone is on carbon 3 of a six-carbon chain. So the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait:

Wait, 5-methoxy substitution. So it's CH2CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait. Let me think: the formula is hexan-3-one, which is (CH2)2CO... but with a substitution.

Wait, the correct structure for (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is:

Positions 1 to 6:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O (since it's 3-one)

4: CH(OCH3)-

5: CH2-

6: CH3? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me number the carbons:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, wait, the formula is hexan-3-one, which is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3? No, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)2CH3. So the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. But the substituent is at position 5? Wait, no, the substituent is a methoxy group at position 5.

Wait, the compound is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So in the six-carbon chain, the ketone is on carbon 3, and the methoxy group is on carbon 5.

So the structure is:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)-

6: CH3.

Wait, wait, no. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3. If the substituent is at position 5, then numbering starts from the other end. Wait, perhaps I should draw this correctly.

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3. So carbons are 1 (CH3), 2 (CH2), 3 (C=O), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH2), 6 (CH3). So position 5 is the fifth carbon. So 5-methoxy would be on the fifth carbon, which is a CH2 group. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if it's a CH2 group, substituting a methoxy would make it CH2-OCH3. So the structure would be:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O

4: CH2-

5: CH2-OCH3

6: CH3.

Wait, but wait, carbon 5 is CH2, so adding a methoxy as a substituent would make it CH2-OCH3? That's correct.

So when (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH, the ketone group (C=O) is reduced to a CH2OH group. LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol? Wait, no: Wait, the starting ketone is at position 3, so reducing it would give a secondary alcohol at position 3, making it hexan-3-ol with a methoxy group at position 5.

Wait, but the starting compound is (S)-configured because it's an (S) enantiomer. So after reduction, the product's configuration would depend on the reaction. LAH is a strong reducing agent, and when reducing a ketone, it typically leads to the formation of an alcohol with retention of configuration because the mechanism is a two-step process without inversion. Wait, no, in the reduction of ketones with LAH, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, and since the starting carbonyl isn't a chiral center, the product will have the hydride adding in a certain way. Wait, but the starting material is a chiral center at position 5 because the methoxy group is attached to a carbon that's adjacent to the ketone.

Wait, no. Wait, in the starting material, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 6: CH2CH3? Wait, no, hexan is six carbons. Let me correct this. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the carbons are:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O

4: CH2-

5: CH2-

6: CH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Hexan-3-one would be (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. So it's:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So carbon 3 is the carbonyl.

But in the starting material, there's a methoxy group on carbon 5.

Wait, carbon 5 is the fifth carbon. So in the structure, after the carbonyl (carbon 3), we have CH2 (carbon 4), then CH2 (carbon 5), then CH3 (carbon 6). So if carbon 5 is substituted with a methoxy, the structure becomes:

Carbon 5: CH2-OCH3?

Wait, but that would make it a CH2-OCH3 group on carbon 5, which is adjacent to the carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

CH2CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, because that would place the methoxy on carbon 4, but the question states it's on carbon 5.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the numbering. Let me try again. The correct IUPAC name is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

Hexan-3-one: the longest chain with the ketone on carbon 3. The substituent is a methoxy on carbon 5.

So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 6: CH2CH3?

Wait, that doesn't make sense because carbons 5 and 6 would be CH(OCH3) and CH2CH3. Wait, but hexan has six carbons, so:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 6: CH2- but that's only six carbons? Maybe it's:

Wait, perhaps it's:

(CH2)2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that would be seven carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. That would mean carbons 3 is the ketone, 5 is the methoxy on carbon 5.

Wait, no, in that structure, the carbonyl is on carbon 3, then CH2 (carbon 4), then CH(OCH3) (carbon 5), then CH2 (carbon 6), and then CH3 (wait, that's more than six carbons). Maybe I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps that's not critical right now. Let me think about the reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH.

LAH reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the product after this reduction would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, the starting material is a chiral center. So the product will have the same configuration at that center unless the reaction changes it.

Wait, the starting material has a chiral center at carbon 5. Because the structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, carbon 5 is connected to four different groups: OCH3, a CH2 from carbon 4, a CH2 from carbon 6, and a hydrogen (if it's a CH group). Wait, no, the structure: Carbon 5 is CH(OCH3), attached to carbon 4 (CH2), carbon 6 (CH2?), and the other substituents. Hmm, perhaps the structure is such that carbon 5 is a chiral center. So the starting material is chiral.

When LAH reduces the ketone (at carbon 3) to an alcohol (at carbon 3), the configuration at carbon 5 remains the same because the reduction doesn't affect carbon 5. So the product will still have the same configuration at carbon 5, and the new alcohol at carbon 3.

So the product of Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. This is a diastereomer if another stereocenter is formed, but in this case, the only stereocenter is at carbon 5, which remains S. The product is a single enantiomer because it's a stereocenter.

Wait, no. Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at carbon 5. Upon reduction, the ketone becomes an alcohol, but that's at carbon 3, which was not a chiral center before. So carbon 3 becomes a chiral center after reduction because it's now attached to four different groups: OH, the two adjacent CH2 groups, and another group. Wait, let's see:

After reduction, the structure is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Carbon 3: connected to OH, two CH2 groups, and a carbonyl group? No, wait, the ketone becomes CH2OH. So the structure at carbon 3 is CH2OH, so it's connected to two CH2 groups (from carbons 2 and 4), an OH, and a CH group (from carbon 5, which is CH(OCH3)).

Wait, no, carbon 3 is now CH(OH), right? Because when you reduce a ketone (R2CO), you get R2CH(OH). So carbon 3 is CH(OH). So it would have four substituents: two CH2 groups (from carbons 2 and 4), an OH group, and a CH(OCH3) group (from carbon 5). So carbon 3 becomes a chiral center.

So the product of Reaction I has two chiral centers: one at carbon 3 (new) and one at carbon 5 (original).

Wait, but wait. The starting material, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, has a chiral center at carbon 5. Upon reduction, a new chiral center forms at carbon 3.

So the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer because it has two chiral centers, both of which are present in the product. But since the starting material was a single enantiomer, the product will have two chiral centers, but if the reaction doesn't change the configuration at any center, then the product will have two chiral centers leading to four possible stereoisomers, but in reality, only two would be present because LAH leads to a specific configuration when reducing.

Wait, no, LAH typically leads to the formation of the alcohol with the same configuration as the ketone. Wait, no, the ketone isn't chiral. The ketone is at carbon 3. So when reduced, the product is a secondary alcohol with the same configuration as the reduction. Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

When a ketone is reduced, the product is an alcohol. The stereochemistry of the new chiral center (if any) depends on the reducing agent. LAH is a strong reducing agent that tends to form the alcohol with specific configuration, but in the absence of any other stereogenic influence, it usually gives a racemic mixture if the ketone is symmetric. But wait, in this case, the ketone is not symmetric because the groups on either side are different.

Wait, perhaps the mechanism for LAH reduction would form a specific stereoisomer based on the approach of the hydride. Let me think: LAH is a source of H- (hydride). The hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, which is the electrophilic carbon. In ketones, the hydride attack can lead to a specific configuration based on the structure.

But wait, the ketone in Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the groups around the carbonyl are different, leading to a possibility of stereoselective reduction.

Wait, but wait, the carbonyl group is at C3, and the groups attached are:

On the left: (from C2) a CH2 group leading to C1.

On the right: (from C4) a CH2 leading to C5, which has a methoxy group.

So when LAH reduces the ketone, the hydride will attack the carbonyl carbon, which is C3. The hydride (H-) is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon (C3). The addition would be from the less hindered side.

But since the starting material is a chiral center at C5, the structure is such that the approach of hydride could be influenced by the existing stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps the reduction leads to the formation of a specific diastereomer. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture, but considering that the starting material is chiral, maybe the product has a specific configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps after the acidic workup, the product is a single enantiomer because the reaction leads to only one possible configuration.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently. The key point is that the product from Reaction I has two chiral centers: C3 and C5. The configuration of C5 is S, and the configuration of C3 would be determined by the reduction.

But wait, perhaps the reduction leads to the new chiral center (C3) having a specific configuration, say R or S, depending on the approach of hydride.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, making it a pair of enantiomers, but since the starting material was a single enantiomer, the product might be a single diastereomer, which would have two chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's proceed to Reaction II and see if that gives me more insight.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3CO)2CHCH3, but wait, no. Pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, wait, pentane is five carbons. So pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons? Let me count: positions 1 to 5.

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: C=O

Carbon 3: CH2-

Carbon 4: C=O

Carbon 5: CH3.

Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make it 2 and 4 diones, but pentane has five carbons. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's six carbons. No, wait, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3 is actually pentane-2,4-dione. Wait, no, that would be six carbons. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's (CH2)2 between the two ketones? No, I'm getting confused again. Let me think of it as:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? No, that's more than five carbons. Maybe it's CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3, which is four carbons, not five. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's CH2(COCH2CH3)COCH3? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)C(O)CH2C(O)CH2CH3. No, that's more than five carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)COCH2COCH2CH3, but that's six carbons.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it as a diketone with two ketone groups on carbons 2 and 4. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. So, five carbons in total. So when treated with NaBH4, which is a reducing agent, but it's a milder agent compared to LAH. Wait, but NaBH4 generally doesn't reduce esters or amides, but it does reduce ketones.

However, in the presence of excess NaBH4, perhaps both ketones are reduced. So each ketone in pentane-2,4-dione will be reduced to an alcohol.

Each ketone is at positions 2 and 4. So the product would be HOCH2CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, no, let's see.

Wait, the starting material is pentane-2,4-dione: O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's five carbons. So positions 1 to 5:

1: CH3-

2: C=O

3: CH2-

4: C=O

5: CH3.

Wait, that's not correct because that would make it a four-carbon chain with two ketones. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. That's four carbons, making it butane-2,4-dione, but the question says pentane-2,4-dione, so it's five carbons.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's six carbons. I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I should proceed with the reaction regardless.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione + excess NaBH4 → ?

Assuming that the structure is such that there are two ketone groups, each would be reduced to an alcohol. So the product would be a diol.

So the product would be HOCH2CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, no, perhaps it's HOCH2-CH2-CHOH-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but each ketone is at positions 2 and 4. So when reduced, each becomes an alcohol.

So the product would be pentane-2,4-diol, but as a diol with two adjacent alcohols?

Wait, no, because the positions are 2 and 4, so the diol would be 2 and 4 diols.

Wait, no, pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, perhaps I should think in terms of the product.

Assuming the structure is O=C-R-CO-R', where R and R' are CH2 groups, but I'm not getting the structure right. Let me just think about the reaction.

Upon reduction with excess NaBH4, each ketone is reduced to an alcohol. So the product would have two alcohol groups, leading to a vicinal diol? Or perhaps not. Let me think.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione would have two ketone groups at positions 2 and 4 of a five-carbon chain. So the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? No, that's six carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

CH2=C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. That's five carbons? Let me count: the first O=C is on C2, then CH2 (C3), then CH2 (C4), then CO (C5), and CH3. Wait, that's five carbons in the chain, making it pentane-2,4-dione.

So when reduced, each ketone (C2 and C5) becomes an alcohol. So the product would be HOCH2-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So the structure is HOCH2CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3.

Wait, but that's a five-carbon diol with the OH groups on C2 and C5? No, wait, in the starting material, the ketones are at C2 and C5, so after reduction, the diol would have OHs on C2 and C5.

But this would make the diol as HOCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2OH? No, because the starting material is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. Upon reduction, each ketone becomes an alcohol. So the product would be HOCH2-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So the structure is HOCH2CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3. Wait, but that would have OH groups on C2 and C5? Or wait, no. Let's correct the numbering:

Original structure: positions 2 and 4 are ketones. So the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Wait, that's five carbons: C1 is CH3, C2 is CH2, C3 is C(=O), C4 is CH2, C5 is C(=O). So the structure is CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. No, that would be six carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here again. Let me proceed with the assumption that the product is a 2,4-pentanediol, with OH groups on C2 and C4.

So the product would be HOCH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3. So the molecule has two secondary alcohols.

But wait, each of these alcohols is on a carbon adjacent to another CH2 group. So each OH is on a secondary carbon (since each is attached to two CH2 groups and an OH).

Now, considering the reaction conditions: NaBH4 is used, which is a milder reducing agent. However, in the presence of excess NaBH4, both ketones are reduced. So the product is a diol.

Now, considering the stereochemistry: NaBH4 is a chiral reducing agent, but in this case, each ketone is a symmetric ketone. Wait, pentane-2,4-dione has two identical ketone groups. Each ketone is flanked by two identical groups. So when each ketone is reduced, the product's configuration would be the same for each alcohol group.

Wait, no, because each ketone is at a different position. Let me think: each ketone in pentane-2,4-dione is symmetrical. So when reduced, each will form the same stereochemistry. So the product will be a diastereomer with both OH groups on the same side or opposite sides.

Wait, but wait, each ketone is in a symmetric environment. So when NaBH4 reduces each, it would form a specific diastereomer. However, since each ketone is symmetric, the reduction would lead to a racemic mixture for each, but since they're symmetrical, the overall product would be a single enantiomer.

Wait, no. Wait, if each ketone is symmetrical, reduction would lead to a single diastereomer, as the same configuration would form on each side.

Alternatively, since each ketone is symmetric, the product would have two identical chiral centers, leading to either a meso compound or a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, for example, if the product is HOCH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not the case here. Wait, perhaps the product is HOCH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3, which is 2,4-pentanediol.

In this case, the two OHs are on C2 and C4. The molecule is symmetric around the central CH2 group. So the molecule could be a meso compound if the configurations are opposite.

Wait, let me imagine the structure: HOCH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3. So the two OHs are on C2 and C4, which are symmetrically equivalent in a five-carbon chain.

If both OHs are R configuration, or both S, then the molecule would be a meso compound because the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the configurations are opposite, it could form a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but when you reduce a symmetric diketone, the product would have two OH groups that are mirror images of each other, leading to a meso compound.

Wait, for example, consider tartaric acid. It's a meso compound because the two stereocenters are mirror images, making the molecule achiral overall.

In this case, pentane-2,4-dione, when reduced, would produce a diol where the two OH groups are mirror images, leading to a meso compound. So the product would be a single compound, a meso diol, which is not chiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry.

Wait, but is that correct? Let me think. If the two OH groups are on symmetric positions and have opposite configurations, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and be achiral, making it a meso compound.

So the product of Reaction II is a single compound, a meso diol, with two stereocenters but not chiral.

So now, putting it all together:

Reaction I produces (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. This product has two chiral centers: C3 and C5. The configuration at C5 is S, and the configuration at C3 is determined by the reduction. Since LAH is a strong reducing agent, and the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have specific configurations.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer with two chiral centers, making it a pair of enantiomers. But wait, no, because the product is derived from a single enantiomer, the product would have a specific configuration at both centers, meaning it's a single diastereomer, which could be a pair of enantiomers if both centers are present.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, so it would have two stereocenters, making it a pair of enantiomers. But since the starting material was a single enantiomer, the product would be a single stereoisomer, hence a pair of enantiomers would not form unless there's a new chiral center formed.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting too confused. Let me think about the possible products.

From Reaction I:

- Starting material: 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, (S) configuration at C5.
- After reduction with LAH, becomes 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.
- This product has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.
- The configuration at C5 remains S.
- The configuration at C3 is R or S, depending on the reduction.

Assuming the reduction leads to a specific configuration, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer with two stereocenters. Thus, it's a pair of enantiomers, but since the starting material was a single enantiomer, the product would be a single stereoisomer, hence a pair of enantiomers would not form. Wait, no—each stereocenter adds another dimension of stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer with two stereocenters, making it a single compound but with two stereocenters. So, the product would be a single diastereomer, but I'm not sure if it's chiral because it has two stereocenters and no plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single compound with two stereocenters, making it a pair of enantiomers, but since the starting material was a single enantiomer, the product would be a single diastereomer, which would have two stereocenters, making it a pair of enantiomers unless it's a meso compound.

But in this case, the product has two stereocenters without a plane of symmetry, so it's chiral, and thus exists as a pair of enantiomers. But since the starting material was a single enantiomer, the product would be a single diastereomer, which is a pair of enantiomers, but perhaps the reaction leads to only one enantiomer.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the possible number of peaks in each HPLC.

The question asks, after both reactions are complete, the products are combined and run on normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC. How many peaks are observed in each?

So, Reaction I gives a certain product, and Reaction II gives another product. These are combined, so the mixture contains both products.

So, let's figure out the number of stereoisomers in each product.

For Reaction I:

The product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. It has two chiral centers: C3 and C5. So, the possible stereoisomers are 2^2 = 4, but since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have a specific configuration, making it a single diastereomer. Wait, but wait: the reduction of the ketone (C3) may lead to a new stereocenter. So the product would have two chiral centers, but perhaps only one possible diastereomer is formed because the starting material is a single enantiomer, leading to specific configurations.

Wait, but no. The starting material has a single chiral center (C5 is S), and the reduction forms a new chiral center (C3). So the product would have two chiral centers, making it a diastereomer, but whether it's a single stereoisomer depends on the reaction's stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer with two stereocenters, making it a pair of enantiomers. So, the product would have two stereocenters, meaning four possible stereoisomers, but in reality, only two are formed (as enantiomers) from the reaction.

Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would have a specific configuration at both centers, leading to a single diastereomer, which could be a pair of enantiomers. But since the product has two stereocenters, it's chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers. So, the product would consist of a single enantiomer, leading to one peak in a chiral HPLC but two peaks in normal-phase HPLC? No, wait: in normal-phase HPLC, if the molecule is not chiral, it would elute as a single peak. But if it's chiral, but the column is not chiral, it would have two peaks for the two enantiomers. Wait, no, but if the substance is not chiral, it would have one peak. If it's chiral, and the column is normal-phase (not chiral), it would have two peaks. But wait, in Reaction I, the product is chiral because it has two stereocenters without a plane of symmetry. So the product is a single enantiomer, leading to a single peak in a chiral HPLC, but two peaks in a normal-phase HPLC if the column doesn't separate enantiomers.

Wait, but no. Normal-phase HPLC columns typically have a polar stationary phase and are used for separating compounds based on their polarity. They are not chiral, so enantiomers would elute as a single peak because the column can't distinguish between enantiomers. Wait, no, actually, in normal-phase HPLC, enantiomers can be separated if the mobile phase is chiral, but in standard normal-phase HPLC with a non-chiral column, enantiomers would not be separated and would co-elute as a single peak.

Wait, no. Wait, normal-phase HPLC columns are achiral. So if you have a chiral compound, the column can't distinguish between enantiomers, so they would elute together as a single peak. But if the compound is a meso compound, it's achiral, so it would also elute as a single peak. But if the compound is chiral and has a non-superimposable mirror image, then in a normal-phase HPLC, it would appear as a single peak because the column doesn't separate enantiomers.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Chiral columns have a chiral stationary phase that can separate enantiomers. In achiral columns (like normal-phase), enantiomers may not be separated and would appear as a single peak. So, for a chiral molecule, the normal-phase HPLC would show one peak, while a chiral column would show two peaks if the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but in this case, the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, so in a normal-phase HPLC, it would show one peak. But in a chiral HPLC column, it would show one peak as well because it's a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again. For the product from Reaction I, which is a single enantiomer with two stereocenters, when run on a normal-phase (achiral) column, it would elute as one peak. When run on a chiral column, it would also elute as one peak because it's a single enantiomer, so no separation occurs.

Wait, but if the product is a racemic mixture, then the normal-phase would show one peak, and the chiral column would show two peaks. But in Reaction I, the product is a single enantiomer, so both chromatograms would show one peak for this compound.

Now, Reaction II's product: pentane-2,4-dione reduced to 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound. So it has two stereocenters but is achiral because of a plane of symmetry. So, when run on a normal-phase HPLC, it would be a single peak, and on a chiral column, it would also be a single peak because the compound is not chiral.

So now, the combined products from both reactions are:

- Reaction I: single enantiomer of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol with two stereocenters (so it's chiral).
- Reaction II: meso compound 2,4-pentanediol (achiral).

So when both are combined, what do we have?

Each reaction gives one product. So, the combined mixture has two compounds: product A (chiral, single enantiomer) and product B (achiral).

When run on normal-phase HPLC (achiral column), product A would elute as one peak, product B as another. So total of two peaks.

When run on chiral HPLC, product A (chiral) would elute as one peak, and product B (achiral) would also elute as one peak. So total of two peaks.

Wait, but earlier I thought Reaction I's product would be a single diastereomer with two stereocenters, which would be a pair of enantiomers. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me reevaluate Reaction I.

Reaction I: Starting with (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which has a chiral center at C5 (S configuration).

After reduction, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has chiral centers at C3 and C5.

The configuration at C5 remains S because the reduction doesn't affect it. The configuration at C3 is determined by the reduction. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have a specific configuration at C3.

Wait, but the reduction would form a specific stereoisomer. So the product would have two chiral centers, making it a diastereomer, and since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would be a single diastereomer with two stereocenters. Thus, the product would be a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, no. If the product has two stereocenters, the possible stereoisomers are 2^2=4. But the reaction would produce a specific diastereomer, which would be a pair of enantiomers, but in the product, since it's derived from a single enantiomer, perhaps only one enantiomer is formed.

Wait, perhaps the product has two stereocenters, and the reaction produces a single enantiomer, leading to a single peak in a chiral HPLC, but two peaks in a normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the product is a single enantiomer with two stereocenters, then in a chiral column, it would show as one peak. In a normal-phase (achiral) column, it would also show as one peak because the column can't distinguish enantiomers.

But wait, the product from Reaction I has two stereocenters and is chiral. So, in a normal-phase HPLC, it would appear as one peak because the column can't separate enantiomers. In a chiral HPLC, it would appear as two peaks if it's a racemic mixture, but in our case, it's a single enantiomer, so only one peak.

But wait, if the product is a single enantiomer, then in any column, it would be a single peak. But if the product is a pair of enantiomers (racemic), then in a normal-phase column, it would be a single peak, and in a chiral column, two peaks.

Wait, but in Reaction I, the product is derived from a single enantiomer. So, the product would have a specific configuration at both chiral centers, making it a single diastereomer, which is a pair of enantiomers. So, the product would be a racemic mixture? No, wait, the reaction starts with a single enantiomer, so the product would have specific configurations, leading to a single diastereomer, which is a pair of enantiomers. But wait, the product is a single diastereomer, which is a pair of enantiomers, so it's a racemic mixture. But that's not possible because the starting material is a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, which is a single enantiomer, hence a single peak in both columns.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the possible products and their HPLC behavior.

Product A: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two chiral centers and is a single enantiomer. So, in normal-phase HPLC (achiral), it would elute as one peak. In chiral HPLC, it would also elute as one peak.

Product B: 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound (achiral). So, in both HPLC types, it would elute as one peak.

So, when both are combined, the mixture has two compounds: product A (elutes as one peak in both HPLCs) and product B (elutes as one peak in both HPLCs).

So, in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks: one for product A and one for product B.

In chiral HPLC, two peaks as well.

Wait, but the options don't have 2 peaks for both. Let me check the options.

Options:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC

Hmm. So according to my previous reasoning, both chromatograms would show two peaks each, but none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of stereocenters or the products. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product isn't a single enantiomer but a pair of enantiomers. So, product A would give two peaks in chiral HPLC and one in normal-phase.

Product B is a meso compound (one peak in both HPLCs).

So, combined, product A (two peaks) and product B (one peak) would give three peaks in chiral HPLC and two in normal-phase.

Which matches option B: 3 peaks in chiral, 2 in normal.

Wait, so let's think again.

Reaction I's product: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

It has two chiral centers, so it's a diastereomer with four possible stereoisomers. But the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would have a specific configuration at both centers, making it a single diastereomer, which is a pair of enantiomers, hence a racemic mixture. But if the reaction is stereospecific, perhaps it produces only one diastereomer, which is a single enantiomer. Wait, no, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have a specific configuration at both centers, making it a single diastereomer, which is a pair of enantiomers. But that would mean the product is a racemic mixture, which would have two peaks in chiral HPLC and one in normal.

But wait, in reality, when a ketone is reduced with LAH, it typically leads to the formation of the same configuration on both sides, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, so it would give one peak in both HPLCs.

In that case, combining with product B (meso, one peak in both HPLCs), the total would be two peaks in both HPLCs, which isn't an option.

Hmm.

Alternative approach: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a secondary alcohol with a single chiral center.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine Reaction I.

Starting material: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

Structure: CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Upon reduction with LAH, the ketone at C3 becomes CH(OH).

So the product is CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, now, looking at the structure, the OH is on C3. What about the configuration?

The starting material has a chiral center at C5 (S configuration). After reduction, does C3 become a new chiral center?

Yes. So the product has chiral centers at C3 and C5.

Thus, the product has two chiral centers.

Now, considering the reaction, the configuration at C3 would be determined by the reduction.

LAH is a strong reducing agent and typically reduces ketones to alcohols with the same configuration as the starting ketone. Wait, but the ketone isn't chiral, so the reduction would form a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps the reduction leads to the same configuration on both sides, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer, which would be a pair of enantiomers. So, for Reaction I, the product would have two stereocenters, making it a diastereomer that is chiral.

So, when run on a chiral HPLC, product A would show two peaks (racemic mixture), and product B (meso) would show one peak. So total of three peaks in chiral HPLC.

On normal-phase HPLC, product A would show one peak (racemic), product B one peak. So total of two peaks.

So the answer would be option B: 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.

But wait, earlier I thought that if the product is a single enantiomer, it would show one peak in both. But perhaps the product is a racemic mixture, leading to two peaks in chiral HPLC.

Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer. How would the product end up as a racemic mixture?

Wait, no. The starting material is a single enantiomer. Upon reduction, the product would have a specific configuration at C3, leading to a single diastereomer, which is a pair of enantiomers. So the product would be a racemic mixture of product A and its enantiomer.

Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would have a specific configuration at both C3 and C5, leading to a single diastereomer, which is a pair of enantiomers. So the product would be a racemic mixture, giving two peaks in chiral HPLC, and one peak in normal-phase for each compound.

But I'm getting confused again. Let me approach it differently.

Reaction I yields a single diastereomer with two stereocenters. That diastereomer is a pair of enantiomers. So the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.

Reaction II yields a meso compound, which is achiral.

So, when the products are combined, the mixture contains:

- Two enantiomers from Reaction I (each would be a separate peak in chiral HPLC, one peak in normal-phase).

- One meso compound from Reaction II (one peak in both HPLCs).

So, in chiral HPLC: two peaks (from Reaction I) + one peak (from Reaction II) = three peaks.

In normal-phase HPLC: each pair of enantiomers from Reaction I would co-elute as one peak, plus one peak from Reaction II. So total of two peaks.

Thus, the answer is option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves analyzing the products of two reactions and determining the number of peaks observed in normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC chromatograms after combining the products.

### Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH
1. **Starting Material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one has a chiral center at C5 (S configuration) and a ketone group at C3.
2. **Reaction**: LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol, forming 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.
3. **Product**: The product has two chiral centers (C3 and C5). The configuration at C5 remains S, while the reduction introduces a specific configuration at C3. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product is a single diastereomer with two stereocenters, which exists as a pair of enantiomers (racemic mixture).
4. **HPLC Behavior**:
   - In **normal-phase HPLC** (achiral column), enantiomers co-elute as a single peak.
   - In **chiral HPLC**, the two enantiomers separate into two distinct peaks.

### Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4
1. **Starting Material**: Pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups at C2 and C4.
2. **Reaction**: NaBH4 reduces both ketones to alcohols, forming 2,4-pentanediol.
3. **Product**: The product is a meso compound due to the plane of symmetry between the two chiral centers (C2 and C4). Meso compounds are achiral.
4. **HPLC Behavior**:
   - In both **normal-phase HPLC** and **chiral HPLC**, the meso compound elutes as a single peak.

### Combined Products and Final Analysis
1. **Reaction I** produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers (5-methoxyhexan-3-ol), which gives:
   - **2 peaks** in chiral HPLC (one for each enantiomer).
   - **1 peak** in normal-phase HPLC (enantiomers co-elute).
2. **Reaction II** produces a meso compound (2,4-pentanediol), which gives:
   - **1 peak** in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC.
3. **Combined Products**:
   - In **chiral HPLC**: 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 1 peak (from Reaction II) = **3 peaks**.
   - In **normal-phase HPLC**: 1 peak (from Reaction I) + 1 peak (from Reaction II) = **2 peaks**.

### Correct Answer
The chromatograms will show **3 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**.

**Answer: B**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's break it down.

The question involves two reactions, Reaction I and Reaction II, each starting with different compounds. The products are then combined and analyzed using normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC. The task is to determine how many peaks appear in each type of chromatogram.

First, I'll tackle Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH followed by acidic workup.

LAH is a strong reducing agent, typically used to reduce carbonyl groups. Hexan-3-one has a ketone group at position 3. So, when reduced, the ketone becomes a secondary alcohol. The structure of the starting material is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So, the structure is CH2CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? Wait, no, hexan-3-one is CH3CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-OCH3? Wait, wait, no. Let me draw it properly.

Hexan-3-one means the ketone is on carbon 3 of a six-carbon chain. So the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait:

Wait, 5-methoxy substitution. So it's CH2CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, wait. Let me think: the formula is hexan-3-one, which is (CH2)2CO... but with a substitution.

Wait, the correct structure for (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is:

Positions 1 to 6:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O (since it's 3-one)

4: CH(OCH3)-

5: CH2-

6: CH3? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me number the carbons:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 5: CH2-

Carbon 6: CH3? No, wait, wait. Wait, wait, the formula is hexan-3-one, which is (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3? No, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, hexan-3-one is (CH2)2CO(CH2)2CH3. So the structure is CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. But the substituent is at position 5? Wait, no, the substituent is a methoxy group at position 5.

Wait, the compound is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So in the six-carbon chain, the ketone is on carbon 3, and the methoxy group is on carbon 5.

So the structure is:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O

4: CH2-

5: CH(OCH3)-

6: CH3.

Wait, wait, no. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3. If the substituent is at position 5, then numbering starts from the other end. Wait, perhaps I should draw this correctly.

Wait, hexan-3-one is CH2CH2COCH2CH2CH3. So carbons are 1 (CH3), 2 (CH2), 3 (C=O), 4 (CH2), 5 (CH2), 6 (CH3). So position 5 is the fifth carbon. So 5-methoxy would be on the fifth carbon, which is a CH2 group. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if it's a CH2 group, substituting a methoxy would make it CH2-OCH3. So the structure would be:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O

4: CH2-

5: CH2-OCH3

6: CH3.

Wait, but wait, carbon 5 is CH2, so adding a methoxy as a substituent would make it CH2-OCH3? That's correct.

So when (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH, the ketone group (C=O) is reduced to a CH2OH group. LAH is a strong reducing agent that typically reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the product would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol? Wait, no: Wait, the starting ketone is at position 3, so reducing it would give a secondary alcohol at position 3, making it hexan-3-ol with a methoxy group at position 5.

Wait, but the starting compound is (S)-configured because it's an (S) enantiomer. So after reduction, the product's configuration would depend on the reaction. LAH is a strong reducing agent, and when reducing a ketone, it typically leads to the formation of an alcohol with retention of configuration because the mechanism is a two-step process without inversion. Wait, no, in the reduction of ketones with LAH, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, and since the starting carbonyl isn't a chiral center, the product will have the hydride adding in a certain way. Wait, but the starting material is a chiral center at position 5 because the methoxy group is attached to a carbon that's adjacent to the ketone.

Wait, no. Wait, in the starting material, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 6: CH2CH3? Wait, no, hexan is six carbons. Let me correct this. Hexan-3-one is CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the carbons are:

1: CH3-

2: CH2-

3: C=O

4: CH2-

5: CH2-

6: CH3.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Hexan-3-one would be (CH2)2CO(CH2)3CH3. So it's:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2CH2CH3. So carbon 3 is the carbonyl.

But in the starting material, there's a methoxy group on carbon 5.

Wait, carbon 5 is the fifth carbon. So in the structure, after the carbonyl (carbon 3), we have CH2 (carbon 4), then CH2 (carbon 5), then CH3 (carbon 6). So if carbon 5 is substituted with a methoxy, the structure becomes:

Carbon 5: CH2-OCH3?

Wait, but that would make it a CH2-OCH3 group on carbon 5, which is adjacent to the carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is more like:

CH2CH2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3? No, because that would place the methoxy on carbon 4, but the question states it's on carbon 5.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with the numbering. Let me try again. The correct IUPAC name is 5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

Hexan-3-one: the longest chain with the ketone on carbon 3. The substituent is a methoxy on carbon 5.

So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 6: CH2CH3?

Wait, that doesn't make sense because carbons 5 and 6 would be CH(OCH3) and CH2CH3. Wait, but hexan has six carbons, so:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: C=O

Carbon 4: CH2-

Carbon 5: CH(OCH3)-

Carbon 6: CH2- but that's only six carbons? Maybe it's:

Wait, perhaps it's:

(CH2)2-CO-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that would be seven carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2CH2-CO-CH2-CH(OCH3)-CH2CH3. That would mean carbons 3 is the ketone, 5 is the methoxy on carbon 5.

Wait, no, in that structure, the carbonyl is on carbon 3, then CH2 (carbon 4), then CH(OCH3) (carbon 5), then CH2 (carbon 6), and then CH3 (wait, that's more than six carbons). Maybe I'm getting stuck on the structure, but perhaps that's not critical right now. Let me think about the reaction.

Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one is treated with LAH.

LAH reduces ketones to secondary alcohols. So the product after this reduction would be (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. But wait, the starting material is a chiral center. So the product will have the same configuration at that center unless the reaction changes it.

Wait, the starting material has a chiral center at carbon 5. Because the structure is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, carbon 5 is connected to four different groups: OCH3, a CH2 from carbon 4, a CH2 from carbon 6, and a hydrogen (if it's a CH group). Wait, no, the structure: Carbon 5 is CH(OCH3), attached to carbon 4 (CH2), carbon 6 (CH2?), and the other substituents. Hmm, perhaps the structure is such that carbon 5 is a chiral center. So the starting material is chiral.

When LAH reduces the ketone (at carbon 3) to an alcohol (at carbon 3), the configuration at carbon 5 remains the same because the reduction doesn't affect carbon 5. So the product will still have the same configuration at carbon 5, and the new alcohol at carbon 3.

So the product of Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. This is a diastereomer if another stereocenter is formed, but in this case, the only stereocenter is at carbon 5, which remains S. The product is a single enantiomer because it's a stereocenter.

Wait, no. Wait, the starting material is (S) configuration at carbon 5. Upon reduction, the ketone becomes an alcohol, but that's at carbon 3, which was not a chiral center before. So carbon 3 becomes a chiral center after reduction because it's now attached to four different groups: OH, the two adjacent CH2 groups, and another group. Wait, let's see:

After reduction, the structure is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. Carbon 3: connected to OH, two CH2 groups, and a carbonyl group? No, wait, the ketone becomes CH2OH. So the structure at carbon 3 is CH2OH, so it's connected to two CH2 groups (from carbons 2 and 4), an OH, and a CH group (from carbon 5, which is CH(OCH3)).

Wait, no, carbon 3 is now CH(OH), right? Because when you reduce a ketone (R2CO), you get R2CH(OH). So carbon 3 is CH(OH). So it would have four substituents: two CH2 groups (from carbons 2 and 4), an OH group, and a CH(OCH3) group (from carbon 5). So carbon 3 becomes a chiral center.

So the product of Reaction I has two chiral centers: one at carbon 3 (new) and one at carbon 5 (original).

Wait, but wait. The starting material, (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, has a chiral center at carbon 5. Upon reduction, a new chiral center forms at carbon 3.

So the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer because it has two chiral centers, both of which are present in the product. But since the starting material was a single enantiomer, the product will have two chiral centers, but if the reaction doesn't change the configuration at any center, then the product will have two chiral centers leading to four possible stereoisomers, but in reality, only two would be present because LAH leads to a specific configuration when reducing.

Wait, no, LAH typically leads to the formation of the alcohol with the same configuration as the ketone. Wait, no, the ketone isn't chiral. The ketone is at carbon 3. So when reduced, the product is a secondary alcohol with the same configuration as the reduction. Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

When a ketone is reduced, the product is an alcohol. The stereochemistry of the new chiral center (if any) depends on the reducing agent. LAH is a strong reducing agent that tends to form the alcohol with specific configuration, but in the absence of any other stereogenic influence, it usually gives a racemic mixture if the ketone is symmetric. But wait, in this case, the ketone is not symmetric because the groups on either side are different.

Wait, perhaps the mechanism for LAH reduction would form a specific stereoisomer based on the approach of the hydride. Let me think: LAH is a source of H- (hydride). The hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, which is the electrophilic carbon. In ketones, the hydride attack can lead to a specific configuration based on the structure.

But wait, the ketone in Reaction I is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one. So the groups around the carbonyl are different, leading to a possibility of stereoselective reduction.

Wait, but wait, the carbonyl group is at C3, and the groups attached are:

On the left: (from C2) a CH2 group leading to C1.

On the right: (from C4) a CH2 leading to C5, which has a methoxy group.

So when LAH reduces the ketone, the hydride will attack the carbonyl carbon, which is C3. The hydride (H-) is a strong nucleophile and attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon (C3). The addition would be from the less hindered side.

But since the starting material is a chiral center at C5, the structure is such that the approach of hydride could be influenced by the existing stereochemistry.

Wait, perhaps the reduction leads to the formation of a specific diastereomer. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a racemic mixture, but considering that the starting material is chiral, maybe the product has a specific configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps after the acidic workup, the product is a single enantiomer because the reaction leads to only one possible configuration.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think differently. The key point is that the product from Reaction I has two chiral centers: C3 and C5. The configuration of C5 is S, and the configuration of C3 would be determined by the reduction.

But wait, perhaps the reduction leads to the new chiral center (C3) having a specific configuration, say R or S, depending on the approach of hydride.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, making it a pair of enantiomers, but since the starting material was a single enantiomer, the product might be a single diastereomer, which would have two chiral centers.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's proceed to Reaction II and see if that gives me more insight.

Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4 followed by acidic workup.

Pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3CO)2CHCH3, but wait, no. Pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3? No, wait, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, wait, pentane is five carbons. So pentane-2,4-dione is:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's five carbons? Let me count: positions 1 to 5.

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: C=O

Carbon 3: CH2-

Carbon 4: C=O

Carbon 5: CH3.

Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make it 2 and 4 diones, but pentane has five carbons. So the structure is O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's six carbons. No, wait, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3 is actually pentane-2,4-dione. Wait, no, that would be six carbons. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the correct structure is:

O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's (CH2)2 between the two ketones? No, I'm getting confused again. Let me think of it as:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? No, that's more than five carbons. Maybe it's CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3, which is four carbons, not five. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's CH2(COCH2CH3)COCH3? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe pentane-2,4-dione is (CH3)C(O)CH2C(O)CH2CH3. No, that's more than five carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's (CH3)COCH2COCH2CH3, but that's six carbons.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of it as a diketone with two ketone groups on carbons 2 and 4. So the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. So, five carbons in total. So when treated with NaBH4, which is a reducing agent, but it's a milder agent compared to LAH. Wait, but NaBH4 generally doesn't reduce esters or amides, but it does reduce ketones.

However, in the presence of excess NaBH4, perhaps both ketones are reduced. So each ketone in pentane-2,4-dione will be reduced to an alcohol.

Each ketone is at positions 2 and 4. So the product would be HOCH2CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, no, let's see.

Wait, the starting material is pentane-2,4-dione: O=C-CH2-CO-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's five carbons. So positions 1 to 5:

1: CH3-

2: C=O

3: CH2-

4: C=O

5: CH3.

Wait, that's not correct because that would make it a four-carbon chain with two ketones. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. That's four carbons, making it butane-2,4-dione, but the question says pentane-2,4-dione, so it's five carbons.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. Wait, that's six carbons. I'm getting stuck, but perhaps I should proceed with the reaction regardless.

Reaction II: pentane-2,4-dione + excess NaBH4 → ?

Assuming that the structure is such that there are two ketone groups, each would be reduced to an alcohol. So the product would be a diol.

So the product would be HOCH2CH2CH(OH)CH2CH3? Wait, no, perhaps it's HOCH2-CH2-CHOH-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but each ketone is at positions 2 and 4. So when reduced, each becomes an alcohol.

So the product would be pentane-2,4-diol, but as a diol with two adjacent alcohols?

Wait, no, because the positions are 2 and 4, so the diol would be 2 and 4 diols.

Wait, no, pentane-2,4-dione is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3? No, perhaps I should think in terms of the product.

Assuming the structure is O=C-R-CO-R', where R and R' are CH2 groups, but I'm not getting the structure right. Let me just think about the reaction.

Upon reduction with excess NaBH4, each ketone is reduced to an alcohol. So the product would have two alcohol groups, leading to a vicinal diol? Or perhaps not. Let me think.

Wait, pentane-2,4-dione would have two ketone groups at positions 2 and 4 of a five-carbon chain. So the structure is:

CH3-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3? No, that's six carbons. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

CH2=C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-CH3. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. That's five carbons? Let me count: the first O=C is on C2, then CH2 (C3), then CH2 (C4), then CO (C5), and CH3. Wait, that's five carbons in the chain, making it pentane-2,4-dione.

So when reduced, each ketone (C2 and C5) becomes an alcohol. So the product would be HOCH2-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So the structure is HOCH2CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3.

Wait, but that's a five-carbon diol with the OH groups on C2 and C5? No, wait, in the starting material, the ketones are at C2 and C5, so after reduction, the diol would have OHs on C2 and C5.

But this would make the diol as HOCH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2OH? No, because the starting material is O=C-CH2-CH2-CO-CH3. Upon reduction, each ketone becomes an alcohol. So the product would be HOCH2-CH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH3. So the structure is HOCH2CH2CH2CH(OH)CH3. Wait, but that would have OH groups on C2 and C5? Or wait, no. Let's correct the numbering:

Original structure: positions 2 and 4 are ketones. So the structure is:

CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3.

Wait, that's five carbons: C1 is CH3, C2 is CH2, C3 is C(=O), C4 is CH2, C5 is C(=O). So the structure is CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH2-C(=O)-CH3. No, that would be six carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here again. Let me proceed with the assumption that the product is a 2,4-pentanediol, with OH groups on C2 and C4.

So the product would be HOCH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3. So the molecule has two secondary alcohols.

But wait, each of these alcohols is on a carbon adjacent to another CH2 group. So each OH is on a secondary carbon (since each is attached to two CH2 groups and an OH).

Now, considering the reaction conditions: NaBH4 is used, which is a milder reducing agent. However, in the presence of excess NaBH4, both ketones are reduced. So the product is a diol.

Now, considering the stereochemistry: NaBH4 is a chiral reducing agent, but in this case, each ketone is a symmetric ketone. Wait, pentane-2,4-dione has two identical ketone groups. Each ketone is flanked by two identical groups. So when each ketone is reduced, the product's configuration would be the same for each alcohol group.

Wait, no, because each ketone is at a different position. Let me think: each ketone in pentane-2,4-dione is symmetrical. So when reduced, each will form the same stereochemistry. So the product will be a diastereomer with both OH groups on the same side or opposite sides.

Wait, but wait, each ketone is in a symmetric environment. So when NaBH4 reduces each, it would form a specific diastereomer. However, since each ketone is symmetric, the reduction would lead to a racemic mixture for each, but since they're symmetrical, the overall product would be a single enantiomer.

Wait, no. Wait, if each ketone is symmetrical, reduction would lead to a single diastereomer, as the same configuration would form on each side.

Alternatively, since each ketone is symmetric, the product would have two identical chiral centers, leading to either a meso compound or a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, for example, if the product is HOCH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that's not the case here. Wait, perhaps the product is HOCH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3, which is 2,4-pentanediol.

In this case, the two OHs are on C2 and C4. The molecule is symmetric around the central CH2 group. So the molecule could be a meso compound if the configurations are opposite.

Wait, let me imagine the structure: HOCH2-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-CH3. So the two OHs are on C2 and C4, which are symmetrically equivalent in a five-carbon chain.

If both OHs are R configuration, or both S, then the molecule would be a meso compound because the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, if the configurations are opposite, it could form a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, but when you reduce a symmetric diketone, the product would have two OH groups that are mirror images of each other, leading to a meso compound.

Wait, for example, consider tartaric acid. It's a meso compound because the two stereocenters are mirror images, making the molecule achiral overall.

In this case, pentane-2,4-dione, when reduced, would produce a diol where the two OH groups are mirror images, leading to a meso compound. So the product would be a single compound, a meso diol, which is not chiral because it has an internal plane of symmetry.

Wait, but is that correct? Let me think. If the two OH groups are on symmetric positions and have opposite configurations, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry and be achiral, making it a meso compound.

So the product of Reaction II is a single compound, a meso diol, with two stereocenters but not chiral.

So now, putting it all together:

Reaction I produces (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. This product has two chiral centers: C3 and C5. The configuration at C5 is S, and the configuration at C3 is determined by the reduction. Since LAH is a strong reducing agent, and the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have specific configurations.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer with two chiral centers, making it a pair of enantiomers. But wait, no, because the product is derived from a single enantiomer, the product would have a specific configuration at both centers, meaning it's a single diastereomer, which could be a pair of enantiomers if both centers are present.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, so it would have two stereocenters, making it a pair of enantiomers. But since the starting material was a single enantiomer, the product would be a single stereoisomer, hence a pair of enantiomers would not form unless there's a new chiral center formed.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting too confused. Let me think about the possible products.

From Reaction I:

- Starting material: 5-methoxyhexan-3-one, (S) configuration at C5.
- After reduction with LAH, becomes 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.
- This product has two chiral centers: C3 and C5.
- The configuration at C5 remains S.
- The configuration at C3 is R or S, depending on the reduction.

Assuming the reduction leads to a specific configuration, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer with two stereocenters. Thus, it's a pair of enantiomers, but since the starting material was a single enantiomer, the product would be a single stereoisomer, hence a pair of enantiomers would not form. Wait, no—each stereocenter adds another dimension of stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a diastereomer with two stereocenters, making it a single compound but with two stereocenters. So, the product would be a single diastereomer, but I'm not sure if it's chiral because it has two stereocenters and no plane of symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single compound with two stereocenters, making it a pair of enantiomers, but since the starting material was a single enantiomer, the product would be a single diastereomer, which would have two stereocenters, making it a pair of enantiomers unless it's a meso compound.

But in this case, the product has two stereocenters without a plane of symmetry, so it's chiral, and thus exists as a pair of enantiomers. But since the starting material was a single enantiomer, the product would be a single diastereomer, which is a pair of enantiomers, but perhaps the reaction leads to only one enantiomer.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the possible number of peaks in each HPLC.

The question asks, after both reactions are complete, the products are combined and run on normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC. How many peaks are observed in each?

So, Reaction I gives a certain product, and Reaction II gives another product. These are combined, so the mixture contains both products.

So, let's figure out the number of stereoisomers in each product.

For Reaction I:

The product is (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-ol. It has two chiral centers: C3 and C5. So, the possible stereoisomers are 2^2 = 4, but since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have a specific configuration, making it a single diastereomer. Wait, but wait: the reduction of the ketone (C3) may lead to a new stereocenter. So the product would have two chiral centers, but perhaps only one possible diastereomer is formed because the starting material is a single enantiomer, leading to specific configurations.

Wait, but no. The starting material has a single chiral center (C5 is S), and the reduction forms a new chiral center (C3). So the product would have two chiral centers, making it a diastereomer, but whether it's a single stereoisomer depends on the reaction's stereochemistry.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer with two stereocenters, making it a pair of enantiomers. So, the product would have two stereocenters, meaning four possible stereoisomers, but in reality, only two are formed (as enantiomers) from the reaction.

Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would have a specific configuration at both centers, leading to a single diastereomer, which could be a pair of enantiomers. But since the product has two stereocenters, it's chiral and exists as a pair of enantiomers. So, the product would consist of a single enantiomer, leading to one peak in a chiral HPLC but two peaks in normal-phase HPLC? No, wait: in normal-phase HPLC, if the molecule is not chiral, it would elute as a single peak. But if it's chiral, but the column is not chiral, it would have two peaks for the two enantiomers. Wait, no, but if the substance is not chiral, it would have one peak. If it's chiral, and the column is normal-phase (not chiral), it would have two peaks. But wait, in Reaction I, the product is chiral because it has two stereocenters without a plane of symmetry. So the product is a single enantiomer, leading to a single peak in a chiral HPLC, but two peaks in a normal-phase HPLC if the column doesn't separate enantiomers.

Wait, but no. Normal-phase HPLC columns typically have a polar stationary phase and are used for separating compounds based on their polarity. They are not chiral, so enantiomers would elute as a single peak because the column can't distinguish between enantiomers. Wait, no, actually, in normal-phase HPLC, enantiomers can be separated if the mobile phase is chiral, but in standard normal-phase HPLC with a non-chiral column, enantiomers would not be separated and would co-elute as a single peak.

Wait, no. Wait, normal-phase HPLC columns are achiral. So if you have a chiral compound, the column can't distinguish between enantiomers, so they would elute together as a single peak. But if the compound is a meso compound, it's achiral, so it would also elute as a single peak. But if the compound is chiral and has a non-superimposable mirror image, then in a normal-phase HPLC, it would appear as a single peak because the column doesn't separate enantiomers.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting this wrong. Chiral columns have a chiral stationary phase that can separate enantiomers. In achiral columns (like normal-phase), enantiomers may not be separated and would appear as a single peak. So, for a chiral molecule, the normal-phase HPLC would show one peak, while a chiral column would show two peaks if the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but in this case, the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, so in a normal-phase HPLC, it would show one peak. But in a chiral HPLC column, it would show one peak as well because it's a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Let me think again. For the product from Reaction I, which is a single enantiomer with two stereocenters, when run on a normal-phase (achiral) column, it would elute as one peak. When run on a chiral column, it would also elute as one peak because it's a single enantiomer, so no separation occurs.

Wait, but if the product is a racemic mixture, then the normal-phase would show one peak, and the chiral column would show two peaks. But in Reaction I, the product is a single enantiomer, so both chromatograms would show one peak for this compound.

Now, Reaction II's product: pentane-2,4-dione reduced to 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound. So it has two stereocenters but is achiral because of a plane of symmetry. So, when run on a normal-phase HPLC, it would be a single peak, and on a chiral column, it would also be a single peak because the compound is not chiral.

So now, the combined products from both reactions are:

- Reaction I: single enantiomer of 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol with two stereocenters (so it's chiral).
- Reaction II: meso compound 2,4-pentanediol (achiral).

So when both are combined, what do we have?

Each reaction gives one product. So, the combined mixture has two compounds: product A (chiral, single enantiomer) and product B (achiral).

When run on normal-phase HPLC (achiral column), product A would elute as one peak, product B as another. So total of two peaks.

When run on chiral HPLC, product A (chiral) would elute as one peak, and product B (achiral) would also elute as one peak. So total of two peaks.

Wait, but earlier I thought Reaction I's product would be a single diastereomer with two stereocenters, which would be a pair of enantiomers. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me reevaluate Reaction I.

Reaction I: Starting with (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one, which has a chiral center at C5 (S configuration).

After reduction, the product is 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has chiral centers at C3 and C5.

The configuration at C5 remains S because the reduction doesn't affect it. The configuration at C3 is determined by the reduction. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have a specific configuration at C3.

Wait, but the reduction would form a specific stereoisomer. So the product would have two chiral centers, making it a diastereomer, and since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would be a single diastereomer with two stereocenters. Thus, the product would be a pair of enantiomers.

Wait, no. If the product has two stereocenters, the possible stereoisomers are 2^2=4. But the reaction would produce a specific diastereomer, which would be a pair of enantiomers, but in the product, since it's derived from a single enantiomer, perhaps only one enantiomer is formed.

Wait, perhaps the product has two stereocenters, and the reaction produces a single enantiomer, leading to a single peak in a chiral HPLC, but two peaks in a normal-phase HPLC.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the product is a single enantiomer with two stereocenters, then in a chiral column, it would show as one peak. In a normal-phase (achiral) column, it would also show as one peak because the column can't distinguish enantiomers.

But wait, the product from Reaction I has two stereocenters and is chiral. So, in a normal-phase HPLC, it would appear as one peak because the column can't separate enantiomers. In a chiral HPLC, it would appear as two peaks if it's a racemic mixture, but in our case, it's a single enantiomer, so only one peak.

But wait, if the product is a single enantiomer, then in any column, it would be a single peak. But if the product is a pair of enantiomers (racemic), then in a normal-phase column, it would be a single peak, and in a chiral column, two peaks.

Wait, but in Reaction I, the product is derived from a single enantiomer. So, the product would have a specific configuration at both chiral centers, making it a single diastereomer, which is a pair of enantiomers. So, the product would be a racemic mixture? No, wait, the reaction starts with a single enantiomer, so the product would have specific configurations, leading to a single diastereomer, which is a pair of enantiomers. But wait, the product is a single diastereomer, which is a pair of enantiomers, so it's a racemic mixture. But that's not possible because the starting material is a single enantiomer.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single diastereomer, which is a single enantiomer, hence a single peak in both columns.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the possible products and their HPLC behavior.

Product A: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol, which has two chiral centers and is a single enantiomer. So, in normal-phase HPLC (achiral), it would elute as one peak. In chiral HPLC, it would also elute as one peak.

Product B: 2,4-pentanediol, which is a meso compound (achiral). So, in both HPLC types, it would elute as one peak.

So, when both are combined, the mixture has two compounds: product A (elutes as one peak in both HPLCs) and product B (elutes as one peak in both HPLCs).

So, in normal-phase HPLC, two peaks: one for product A and one for product B.

In chiral HPLC, two peaks as well.

Wait, but the options don't have 2 peaks for both. Let me check the options.

Options:

A) 5 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 4 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

B) 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

C) 4 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC

D) 3 peaks in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC

Hmm. So according to my previous reasoning, both chromatograms would show two peaks each, but none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of stereocenters or the products. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps Reaction I's product isn't a single enantiomer but a pair of enantiomers. So, product A would give two peaks in chiral HPLC and one in normal-phase.

Product B is a meso compound (one peak in both HPLCs).

So, combined, product A (two peaks) and product B (one peak) would give three peaks in chiral HPLC and two in normal-phase.

Which matches option B: 3 peaks in chiral, 2 in normal.

Wait, so let's think again.

Reaction I's product: 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.

It has two chiral centers, so it's a diastereomer with four possible stereoisomers. But the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would have a specific configuration at both centers, making it a single diastereomer, which is a pair of enantiomers, hence a racemic mixture. But if the reaction is stereospecific, perhaps it produces only one diastereomer, which is a single enantiomer. Wait, no, because the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product would have a specific configuration at both centers, making it a single diastereomer, which is a pair of enantiomers. But that would mean the product is a racemic mixture, which would have two peaks in chiral HPLC and one in normal.

But wait, in reality, when a ketone is reduced with LAH, it typically leads to the formation of the same configuration on both sides, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single enantiomer, so it would give one peak in both HPLCs.

In that case, combining with product B (meso, one peak in both HPLCs), the total would be two peaks in both HPLCs, which isn't an option.

Hmm.

Alternative approach: perhaps the product from Reaction I is a secondary alcohol with a single chiral center.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine Reaction I.

Starting material: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one.

Structure: CH3-CH2-C(=O)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Upon reduction with LAH, the ketone at C3 becomes CH(OH).

So the product is CH3-CH2-CH(OH)-CH(OCH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, now, looking at the structure, the OH is on C3. What about the configuration?

The starting material has a chiral center at C5 (S configuration). After reduction, does C3 become a new chiral center?

Yes. So the product has chiral centers at C3 and C5.

Thus, the product has two chiral centers.

Now, considering the reaction, the configuration at C3 would be determined by the reduction.

LAH is a strong reducing agent and typically reduces ketones to alcohols with the same configuration as the starting ketone. Wait, but the ketone isn't chiral, so the reduction would form a specific configuration.

Wait, perhaps the reduction leads to the same configuration on both sides, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the product from Reaction I is a single diastereomer, which would be a pair of enantiomers. So, for Reaction I, the product would have two stereocenters, making it a diastereomer that is chiral.

So, when run on a chiral HPLC, product A would show two peaks (racemic mixture), and product B (meso) would show one peak. So total of three peaks in chiral HPLC.

On normal-phase HPLC, product A would show one peak (racemic), product B one peak. So total of two peaks.

So the answer would be option B: 3 Peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.

But wait, earlier I thought that if the product is a single enantiomer, it would show one peak in both. But perhaps the product is a racemic mixture, leading to two peaks in chiral HPLC.

Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer. How would the product end up as a racemic mixture?

Wait, no. The starting material is a single enantiomer. Upon reduction, the product would have a specific configuration at C3, leading to a single diastereomer, which is a pair of enantiomers. So the product would be a racemic mixture of product A and its enantiomer.

Wait, but the starting material is a single enantiomer, so the product would have a specific configuration at both C3 and C5, leading to a single diastereomer, which is a pair of enantiomers. So the product would be a racemic mixture, giving two peaks in chiral HPLC, and one peak in normal-phase for each compound.

But I'm getting confused again. Let me approach it differently.

Reaction I yields a single diastereomer with two stereocenters. That diastereomer is a pair of enantiomers. So the product is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.

Reaction II yields a meso compound, which is achiral.

So, when the products are combined, the mixture contains:

- Two enantiomers from Reaction I (each would be a separate peak in chiral HPLC, one peak in normal-phase).

- One meso compound from Reaction II (one peak in both HPLCs).

So, in chiral HPLC: two peaks (from Reaction I) + one peak (from Reaction II) = three peaks.

In normal-phase HPLC: each pair of enantiomers from Reaction I would co-elute as one peak, plus one peak from Reaction II. So total of two peaks.

Thus, the answer is option B: 3 peaks in chiral HPLC and 2 in normal-phase.


The question involves analyzing the products of two reactions and determining the number of peaks observed in normal-phase HPLC and chiral HPLC chromatograms after combining the products.

### Reaction I: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one treated with LAH
1. **Starting Material**: (S)-5-methoxyhexan-3-one has a chiral center at C5 (S configuration) and a ketone group at C3.
2. **Reaction**: LAH reduces the ketone at C3 to an alcohol, forming 5-methoxyhexan-3-ol.
3. **Product**: The product has two chiral centers (C3 and C5). The configuration at C5 remains S, while the reduction introduces a specific configuration at C3. Since the starting material is a single enantiomer, the product is a single diastereomer with two stereocenters, which exists as a pair of enantiomers (racemic mixture).
4. **HPLC Behavior**:
   - In **normal-phase HPLC** (achiral column), enantiomers co-elute as a single peak.
   - In **chiral HPLC**, the two enantiomers separate into two distinct peaks.

### Reaction II: Pentane-2,4-dione treated with excess NaBH4
1. **Starting Material**: Pentane-2,4-dione has two ketone groups at C2 and C4.
2. **Reaction**: NaBH4 reduces both ketones to alcohols, forming 2,4-pentanediol.
3. **Product**: The product is a meso compound due to the plane of symmetry between the two chiral centers (C2 and C4). Meso compounds are achiral.
4. **HPLC Behavior**:
   - In both **normal-phase HPLC** and **chiral HPLC**, the meso compound elutes as a single peak.

### Combined Products and Final Analysis
1. **Reaction I** produces a racemic mixture of two enantiomers (5-methoxyhexan-3-ol), which gives:
   - **2 peaks** in chiral HPLC (one for each enantiomer).
   - **1 peak** in normal-phase HPLC (enantiomers co-elute).
2. **Reaction II** produces a meso compound (2,4-pentanediol), which gives:
   - **1 peak** in both chiral HPLC and normal-phase HPLC.
3. **Combined Products**:
   - In **chiral HPLC**: 2 peaks (from Reaction I) + 1 peak (from Reaction II) = **3 peaks**.
   - In **normal-phase HPLC**: 1 peak (from Reaction I) + 1 peak (from Reaction II) = **2 peaks**.

### Correct Answer
The chromatograms will show **3 peaks in chiral HPLC** and **2 peaks in normal-phase HPLC**.

**Answer: B**
