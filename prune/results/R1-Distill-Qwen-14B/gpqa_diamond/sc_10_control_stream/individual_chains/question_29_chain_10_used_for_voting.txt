Okay, so I've got this question about genetics and mutations. Hmm, let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and sequenced the target gene in mutants. They found changes in the first exon area. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

So, the intact gene sequence is given, and four mutants. I need to look for the mutation that probably disrupts the gene's function, maybe a premature stop codon or a frameshift that changes the amino acids enough to disable the compound.

Let me look at each mutant's sequence and compare to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA.

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Wait, let's look at the differences. Comparing to the intact gene:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mutant 1: ATG T TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

Wait, so let me write the segments where they differ. The first part is:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGT...
Mutant 1: ...TCTACGCTGGT...

Hmm, so let me break it into triplets to see codons.

Intact first part:
TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg)... 

Mutant 1:
TCT (Ser), ACA (Thr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGC (Arg)... 

Wait, so in the first exon, the region where they differ is the first few codons.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial split. Let me line up the sequences properly. Let me write the intact and mutant sequences in the same structure.

Intact: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5’-ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA-3’
Wait, maybe I should look for where the mutations are.

Wait, perhaps I should compare the sequences more precisely. Let's count the nucleotides.

The intact gene starts as:

Positions 1-20: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’

Wait, perhaps I should look for where the mutations occur. Let me write out the intact gene and each mutant, then see where the changes are.

Intact gene first part (simplified):
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mutant 1: 
ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT... So, looking at the first few nucleotides. 

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compare the sequences letter by letter up to the point where they differ.

Alternatively, perhaps I should note that the key is to find a mutation that causes a premature stop codon or a frameshift, which would disrupt the protein and possibly disable the compound.

Looking for any in-frame stop codons. Alternatively, a frameshift could change the reading frame, but that depends on where the mutation is.

Let me look at each mutant:

Mutant 1: Comparing to the intact gene.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mutant 1: ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

Looking at the first few codons:

Intact: 1-3: ATG (start)
3-5: TTT (Phe)
5-7: CTC (Leu)
7-9: GCT (Ala)
9-11: GGT (Gly)
11-13: ACT (Thr)
13-15: TCT (Ser)
15-17: GTG (Val)
17-19: GAT (Asp)
19-21: GAA (Glu)
21-23: CAT (His)
23-25: ATT (Ile)
25-27: TAT (Tyr)
27-29: TGT (Cys)
29-31: CGT (Arg)

Mutant 1:

1-3: ATG (same)
3-5: TCT (Ser) instead of TTT (Phe)
5-7: ACG (Thr) instead of CTC (Leu)
7-9: C (wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's better to check the exact nucleotides.)

Wait, perhaps I should look for the exact point where the sequences diverge.

The intact gene has the nucleotides after ATG as T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A...

Mutant 1: T C T A C G C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A...

Hmm, perhaps I should write each position.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find if any of the mutations introduce a stop codon early in the sequence.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The change is at the beginning. The first three nucleotides after ATG are TTT in intact, TCT in mutant. So codon 2: Phe -> Ser. Then at position 5,6,7: CTC becomes ACG. So codon 3: Leu becomes Thr. Then, the next codon is GCT in intact (Ala), but in mutant it's missing a C? Wait, perhaps the mutant has a different length?

Wait, looking at the sequences again:

Intact: ...TCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant 1: ...TACGCTGGTACT...

Wait, the intact has T-C-G-C-T-G-G-T-A-C-T...

Mutant 1: T-A-C-G-C-T-G-G-T-A-C-T...

Ah, so in the intact, it's T C G C T G G T A C T...

In mutant 1, it becomes T A C G C T G G T A C T...

Wait, so the second codon after the two changes is:

In intact, at that point, the codons are CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

In mutant 1, perhaps the changes are:

After the initial TCT, the next codon is ACG (Thr). So the first few amino acids change from Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val... to Ser, Thr, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val... So no stop codon here.

Mutant 1 doesn't introduce a stop codon in the beginning. So probably not this one.

Mutant 2:

Sequence: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Comparing to intact, which is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

So the first part: intact is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Mutant 2: TCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Wait, so the first change is:

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant 2: TCT AAG C GCT GGT ACT...

Hmm, so after ATG, the second codon in intact is TTT (Phe), but in mutant 2, it's TCT (Ser). Then the next codon in intact is CTC (Leu), but in mutant 2, it's AAG (Lys). Wait, that would change the amino acids, but again, does it introduce a stop codon?

Wait, let me write the exact changes. The intact gene has:

...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT T...

Mutant 2 has:

...TCT AAG C GCT GGT ACT T...

Wait, perhaps the exact nucleotides differ. Let me write out the sequences for the first part.

Intact: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A...

Mutant 2: T C T A A G C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A...

So, the second codon (after ATG) is TCT (Ser) instead of TTT (Phe). Then the next codon is AAG instead of CTC. So the third codon becomes Lys instead of Leu. Then, the fourth codon is GCT (Ala) again.

No stop codon in the first few. So that's not introducing a premature stop.

Mutant 3:

Sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing to intact, which is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So, looking at the changes:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG... (codons: Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val...)

Mutant3: ...TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG G...

Wait, let me break it down.

After ATG, the next parts:

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, the second codon is TTT (Phe) same as in intact. Third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), but in Mutant3 it's TAC (Tyr). Then, the fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), same as in Mutant3. Then, fifth codon in intact is GGT (Gly), same as Mutant3.

Wait, but the next part: in intact, it's ACT TCT GTG GAT... So codons: Thr, Ser, Val, Asp.

In Mutant3, after GGT, the next codon is GTC (Val) instead of ACT (Thr). Then, the next codon is ACT (Thr), same as before.

So the sequence changes from Thr, Ser, Val, Asp to Val, Thr, Ser, Val, Asp.

So, the amino acids would change. But again, no stop codon introduced. The question is, does this change enough to disrupt the protein function? Maybe, but without a stop codon early, it's not as likely to eliminate the compound entirely.

Mutant4:

Sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at the changes:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG... (Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val...)

Mutant4: ...TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, perhaps line by line:

Intact has after ATG: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant4: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, so the second codon is same (Phe). Third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), in mutant4 it's TAC (Tyr). Fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), in mutant4 it's same perhaps? Or wait, perhaps I should compare the exact nucleotides.

Wait, perhaps in the intact, after TTT, the next nucleotides are CTC, which is Leu. In Mutant4, after TTT, it's TAC, which is Tyr. So the third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). Then, the next codon in intact is GCT (Ala), but in Mutant4, after TAC, the next codon is GCT (Ala) as well? Or is there a difference?

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence after TAC is GCT, same as in intact. Then, the next codon in intact is GGT (Gly), but in Mutant4, it's ACT (Thr). So, the fourth codon is GGT (intact) vs ACT (mutant4).

So, the sequence becomes:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

So, the first few codons are:

- ATG (start)
- TTT (Phe)
- CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr)
- GCT (Ala) same?
- GGT (Gly) → ACT (Thr)
- TCT (Ser) same
- GTG (Val) same
- GAT (Asp) same...

So, no stop codon introduced. But perhaps the mutation disrupts a critical part of the gene.

Wait, but another possibility is a frameshift. Let me check if any of the mutations have an insertion or deletion that causes a frameshift.

In the given question, all the mutants have sequences that seem to be similar in length, so maybe no frameshifts. Let me check.

Intact length: Let's see, the given sequences end with TGA, which is a stop codon. So the length is the same, as all the mutants have the same length. So likely, no frameshifts, but substitutions.

Hmm, so without frameshifts, the only way to get a nonfunctional protein is to introduce a premature stop codon.

Looking again for any stop codons in the mutants.

Stop codons are TAA, TAG, or TGA.

In the given sequences, the last part ends with TGA in all cases, which is a stop codon. So the intact gene ends with ...TGA.

So, the question is, do any of the mutants have another stop codon earlier in the sequence?

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: Let's see, after the mutations, any TAA, TAG, or TGA earlier?

Looking at the sequence for each mutant:

Mutant1: The codons are, after ATG, TCT (Ser), ACG (Thr), C GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc. No early stop codon.

Mutant2: The codons after ATG are TCT (Ser), AAG (Lys), C GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc. No early stop.

Mutant3: The sequence after ATG is TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), GTC (Val), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc. No stop codons.

Mutant4: The sequence after ATG is TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc. No stop codons.

Wait, but wait. Let me look at the exact nucleotides again. Maybe I missed a stop codon.

Another approach: look for any occurrence of TAA, TAG, or TGA in the coding sequence before the natural stop.

Looking at each mutant's sequences.

Mutant1:

Looking at the nucleotide sequence:

...TCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Looking for TGA, TAG, TAA. Let's see.

ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

Wait, in the middle, there's GAA, which is Glu. Then CAT, ATT, TAT, TGT, CGC.

No TGA in the middle. The original stop is at the end.

Mutant2:

ATG TCT AAG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

No early TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Mutant3:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

No early stop.

Mutant4:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Wait, let me look again. The sequence is 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Hmm, the part after ATG is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, ACT is Thr, then TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), and then TGA.

No stop codons in the middle.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing a point. If the mutation is in the first exon, perhaps it's in a regulatory region, but the question says the target gene was sequenced. So, perhaps the mutation is in the coding region.

Another approach: which mutation introduces a stop codon early in the coding sequence?

Wait, none of the options do, so perhaps the correct approach is to find a mutation that changes a critical part of the gene product, perhaps the start codon or a key region.

Wait, the start codon is ATG. In all mutants, the start is intact. So that's fine.

Wait, perhaps the mutation creates a new start codon upstream, leading to a shorter protein? Or perhaps the mutation is in a critical region, like the active site of an enzyme.

Alternatively, perhaps a nonsense mutation (early stop) is present.

Wait, looking again, perhaps I made a mistake in checking for stop codons. Let's check each mutant again.

Mutant1: Looking for TGA, TAG, TAA. The only TGA is at the end. The rest: no.

Mutant2: Same, no early stops.

Mutant3: Same, no.

Mutant4: Same, no.

Hmm, maybe I should check if any of the mutations cause a missense mutation that disrupts the protein's function. But without knowing the protein structure, it's hard to tell which amino acid change is critical.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation leads to the loss of the start codon or frameshift. Wait, no, the start codon is intact in all.

Wait, perhaps the first few codons are more critical. For example, if the first codon after start is changed, it could affect the protein.

Wait, looking at the intact gene and mutants:

Mutant1: The first codon after ATG is TTT (Phe) → TCT (Ser). Then ACG (Thr) instead of CTC (Leu). So, the first few amino acids are Ser, Thr, Ala, etc. Could this disrupt the protein?

Mutant2: First codon after ATG is TTT → TCT (Ser). Then CTC → AAG (Lys). So, Ser, Lys, Ala...

Mutant3: The first codon after ATG is TTT, same. Then CTC → TAC (Tyr). So, Phe, Tyr, Ala...

Mutant4: First codon same, then CTC → TAC (Tyr). Then GCT same, then GGT → ACT (Thr). So, Phe, Tyr, Ala, Thr... 

Wait, perhaps the most drastic change is in Mutant4, where the fourth codon changes from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr). Gly is a small, non-reactive residue, while Thr is a bit bulkier but maybe that's not enough.

Alternatively, another approach: perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1, because the mutation is in the first exon and the initial changes may affect the protein's function. But without a stop codon, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps a nonsense mutation is present somewhere else. Wait, another way to look: perhaps the mutation introduces an additional stop codon earlier. 

Wait, looking again. Let me check Mutant4's sequence.

Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking it down:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA

So, the codons after ATG are:

1. TTT (Phe)
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. GCT (Ala)
4. ACT (Thr)
5. TCT (Ser)
6. GTG (Val)
7. GAT (Asp)
8. GAA (Glu)
9. CAT (His)
10. ATT (Ile)
11. TAT (Tyr)
12. TGT (Cys)
13. CGT (Arg)
14. TGA (Stop)

So, the sequence seems to go until TGA, same as intact. No early stop.

Wait, but what about the structure of the gene? It has five exons. So, perhaps the mutation is in the first exon, which is part of the coding region. So, any mutation in the coding sequence could change the protein.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the mutation that creates a stop codon early on. But none of the mutants have that.

Alternative plan: perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1, because the first few changes might disrupt a critical region, like the start of the protein.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation is a silent mutation (no change in amino acid), but that's unlikely as the question asks to eliminate the compound.

Wait, another angle: maybe the mutation creates a splice site disruption. But the question says the changes are in the first exon area, so perhaps intron-exon boundaries are not affected.

Wait, but the mutants were produced using EMS, which typically causes point mutations. So, looking for point mutations that create a stop codon.

Wait, looking again at Mutant4: after the TAC (Tyr), the next codon is GCT (Ala), then ACT (Thr). So, in the fourth codon, Gly (GGT) becomes Thr (ACT). So, the sequence is Phe, Tyr, Ala, Thr, Ser, Val, etc.

Mutant1: Ser, Thr, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val...

Hmm, perhaps another approach is to look for a nonsense mutation. Let's see:

In all the mutants, the only stop codon is at the end. So none of them have an early stop. So, perhaps the intended answer is the mutant that disrupts the gene's reading frame via a frameshift, but none of the options show that.

Wait, could I have missed a stop codon in any of them?

Wait, let me check Mutant2 again. The sequence is:

ATG TCT AAG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…

So, looking for TAA, TAG, TGA. The only TGA is at the end.

Wait, but in Mutant2, the third codon is AAG (Lys). Fourth is GCT (Ala). No, no stop codon.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the sequences. Let me re-examine each.

Another approach: perhaps the correct answer is the one where a stop codon is created in the middle.

Wait, looking again, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence is:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA

Wait, in the middle of this, does any triplet form a stop codon?

Looking at the nucleotides:

After ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT.

Looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA. The only TGA is at the end.

Hmm, so perhaps none of the mutants have a premature stop codon. Then, perhaps the correct answer is based on which mutation disrupts the gene's function the most, perhaps by creating a nonfunctional protein through a missense mutation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about disrupting the gene's function by a nonsense mutation, but if none do that, then perhaps the question is about the presence of a frameshift.

Wait, another possibility: the mutation is in the first exon, which may be part of the promoter region, but the question states that the mutation is in the first exon area, implying the coding region.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, which has a larger change in the sequence, perhaps disrupting a critical part of the gene. Let me see.

Mutant4's sequence after ATG is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

In the intact gene, after ATG, the sequence is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, in Mutant4, after TTT, the next codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then, the following codon is GCT (Ala) same as intact. Then comes ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). So, the first few amino acids change from Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser... to Phe, Tyr, Ala, Thr, Ser...

I'm not sure if that's the most disruptive, but perhaps it's better than the others.

Alternatively, maybe Mutant1, because the changes are in the first codons, leading to early changes in the protein structure, possibly leading to a nonfunctional enzyme.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4. Because it changes the fourth codon from Gly to Thr. Gly is a small, non-reactive amino acid, while Thr is slightly bulkier. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the only way to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound is to disrupt the gene's function. If the gene is necessary for producing the compound, then a loss-of-function mutation would stop the compound.

Among the options, perhaps the mutant that causes the most drastic change in the initial exons is Mutant1, with two early changes: Phe to Ser, and Leu to Thr. Alternatively, Mutant4 changes the fourth codon from Gly to Thr.

But without knowing which part of the gene is most critical, perhaps the intended answer is Mutant1 because the change occurs in the first exon, which is near the start, potentially disrupting the function early.

Wait, another thought: perhaps one of the mutations leads to a frameshift, but I don't see any insertions or deletions. All the mutant sequences seem to have the same length as the intact gene.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in checking the length.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact: ...TGT CGT…TGA

Mutant1: ...TGT CGC…TGA

Same length.

Mutant2: ...TGT CGC…TGA → same length.

Mutant3: ...TGT CGT…TGA → same.

Mutant4: ...TGT CGT…TGA → same.

So no frameshift.

Back to the problem: the only way to eliminate the compound is to disrupt the gene's function. Without a premature stop codon, perhaps the intended answer is the mutation that changes the start codon. Wait, but all have the same start.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, as it has a larger portion of the sequence changed. Wait, looking again, the intact gene has G G T A C T T C T G T G G A..., while Mutant4 has A C T T C T G T G G A....

Wait, perhaps the change from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr) is in a critical region, leading to a nonfunctional enzyme.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1 because it changes the second codon from Phe to Ser and third from Leu to Thr, which might disrupt the protein structure early on.

But without knowing the exact function of the protein, it's hard to say. However, given the options, perhaps the intended correct answer is Mutant1, as it has a substitution in the earlier part of the gene.

Wait, but looking again, perhaps I should note that in Mutant1, the third codon is ACG (Thr) instead of CTC (Leu). Leucine is a hydrophobic amino acid, while Thr is polar. That could significantly change the protein structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because the fourth codon changes from Gly to Thr. Gly is a structure-breaking amino acid, and changing it could disrupt the protein's structure.

But I'm not certain. Another approach: perhaps the mutation that creates a stop codon in the first exon is the one. But in all cases, the stop is at the end.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any mutations that lead to a stop codon in the first exon.

Wait, the first exon starts after the start codon. So, any stop codon within the first exon would be early.

Looking again:

Mutant1's sequence in the first exon:

ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

No TGA, TAG, or TAA in the first exon.

Same for others.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is the one that introduces a missense mutation in a critical region. Since I can't determine that, perhaps the intended answer is Mutant1.

Wait, the question states that the gene has five exons and four introns. So the first exon is the first part. The changes in the first exon could be in the coding region, so a mutation there could change the protein.

In that case, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, which changes Gly to Thr. Glycine is often in regions where the protein needs to be flexible. Changing it might disrupt the structure.

Wait, but I'm not finding any of the mutations leading to a stop codon. So perhaps the intended answer is the one that creates the maximum disruption, perhaps a mutation that changes multiple codons early on, like Mutant1.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a larger change in the sequence, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct answer is the one that introduces a stop codon in the first exon. But none do. So perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that disrupts the gene's reading frame, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps each of the mutations is a point mutation, and only one of them introduces a stop codon. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the presence of a TAA, TAG, or TGA in the middle of any of the mutant sequences.

Looking again:

Mutant1: After ATG, the codons are TCT, ACG, GCT, GGT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, GAA, etc. No TAA, TAG, or TGA except at the end.

Mutant2: TCT, AAG, GCT, GGT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, etc. No stop codons.

Mutant3: TTT, TAC, GCT, GGT, GTC, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, etc. No stops.

Mutant4: TTT, TAC, GCT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, etc. No stops.

So none of the mutants introduce a premature stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the question's correct answer is based on the location of the mutation. The first exon is often the first part of the mRNA, so a mutation there could lead to a nonfunctional protein.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the fourth codon, which might be in a critical region.

But without any stop codons, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1, as it has a change in two early codons, leading to a significant change in the protein's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the fourth codon from Gly to Thr, which could disrupt a critical part of the protein structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant2, but I can't find a reason.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the effect of each mutation:

Mutant1: Changes two early amino acids. Might disrupt the protein.

Mutant2: Changes two amino acids, but perhaps less significantly.

Mutant3: Changes two amino acids, but in a way that might affect the structure.

Mutant4: Changes two amino acids and possibly disrupts a region.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a larger change in the sequence.

But I'm not sure. Given the options, I'll go with the most drastic change in the first few codons. So Mutant1 has the first codon changed from Phe to Ser and the third from Leu to Thr. That's a significant change early on, which might disrupt the protein function.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, potentially by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein structure.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:
1. **Intact Gene Sequence**:
   - 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’
   - The sequence starts with ATG (start codon) and ends with TGA (stop codon).

2. **Mutant 1**:
   - Sequence: 5’-ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA-3’
   - Changes:
     - TTT (Phe) → TCT (Ser) at codon 2.
     - CTC (Leu) → ACG (Thr) at codon 3.
   - No premature stop codon introduced. The changes alter early amino acids, potentially disrupting the protein structure.

3. **Mutant 2**:
   - Sequence: 5’-ATG TCT AAG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA-3’
   - Changes:
     - TTT (Phe) → TCT (Ser) at codon 2.
     - CTC (Leu) → AAG (Lys) at codon 3.
   - No premature stop codon introduced. The changes affect early amino acids, but the impact on protein function is less clear compared to Mutant 1.

4. **Mutant 3**:
   - Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’
   - Changes:
     - CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr) at codon 3.
     - ACT (Thr) → GTC (Val) at codon 5.
   - No premature stop codon introduced. The changes alter amino acids, but the impact on protein function is less significant compared to Mutant 1.

5. **Mutant 4**:
   - Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’
   - Changes:
     - CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr) at codon 3.
     - GCT (Ala) → ACT (Thr) at codon 5.
   - No premature stop codon introduced. The changes alter amino acids, but the impact on protein function is less significant compared to Mutant 1.

### Conclusion:
None of the mutants introduce a premature stop codon. However, Mutant 1 has the most significant changes in the early codons (Phe → Ser and Leu → Thr), which are likely to disrupt the protein structure and function more drastically than the other mutations. This makes Mutant 1 the most likely candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about genetics and mutations. Hmm, let me read through it carefully.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. They found the gene responsible, which has five exons and four introns. They used EMS mutagenesis and sequenced the target gene in mutants. They found changes in the first exon area. The goal is to find which mutation would eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

So, the intact gene sequence is given, and four mutants. I need to look for the mutation that probably disrupts the gene's function, maybe a premature stop codon or a frameshift that changes the amino acids enough to disable the compound.

Let me look at each mutant's sequence and compare to the intact gene.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA.

Mutant 1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Wait, let's look at the differences. Comparing to the intact gene:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mutant 1: ATG T TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

Wait, so let me write the segments where they differ. The first part is:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGT...
Mutant 1: ...TCTACGCTGGT...

Hmm, so let me break it into triplets to see codons.

Intact first part:
TTT (Phe), CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg)... 

Mutant 1:
TCT (Ser), ACA (Thr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGC (Arg)... 

Wait, so in the first exon, the region where they differ is the first few codons.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial split. Let me line up the sequences properly. Let me write the intact and mutant sequences in the same structure.

Intact: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’
Mutant 1: 5’-ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA-3’
Wait, maybe I should look for where the mutations are.

Wait, perhaps I should compare the sequences more precisely. Let's count the nucleotides.

The intact gene starts as:

Positions 1-20: 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’

Wait, perhaps I should look for where the mutations occur. Let me write out the intact gene and each mutant, then see where the changes are.

Intact gene first part (simplified):
ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mutant 1: 
ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT... So, looking at the first few nucleotides. 

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compare the sequences letter by letter up to the point where they differ.

Alternatively, perhaps I should note that the key is to find a mutation that causes a premature stop codon or a frameshift, which would disrupt the protein and possibly disable the compound.

Looking for any in-frame stop codons. Alternatively, a frameshift could change the reading frame, but that depends on where the mutation is.

Let me look at each mutant:

Mutant 1: Comparing to the intact gene.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Mutant 1: ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

Looking at the first few codons:

Intact: 1-3: ATG (start)
3-5: TTT (Phe)
5-7: CTC (Leu)
7-9: GCT (Ala)
9-11: GGT (Gly)
11-13: ACT (Thr)
13-15: TCT (Ser)
15-17: GTG (Val)
17-19: GAT (Asp)
19-21: GAA (Glu)
21-23: CAT (His)
23-25: ATT (Ile)
25-27: TAT (Tyr)
27-29: TGT (Cys)
29-31: CGT (Arg)

Mutant 1:

1-3: ATG (same)
3-5: TCT (Ser) instead of TTT (Phe)
5-7: ACG (Thr) instead of CTC (Leu)
7-9: C (wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe it's better to check the exact nucleotides.)

Wait, perhaps I should look for the exact point where the sequences diverge.

The intact gene has the nucleotides after ATG as T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A...

Mutant 1: T C T A C G C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A...

Hmm, perhaps I should write each position.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find if any of the mutations introduce a stop codon early in the sequence.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant 1: The change is at the beginning. The first three nucleotides after ATG are TTT in intact, TCT in mutant. So codon 2: Phe -> Ser. Then at position 5,6,7: CTC becomes ACG. So codon 3: Leu becomes Thr. Then, the next codon is GCT in intact (Ala), but in mutant it's missing a C? Wait, perhaps the mutant has a different length?

Wait, looking at the sequences again:

Intact: ...TCGCTGGTACT...

Mutant 1: ...TACGCTGGTACT...

Wait, the intact has T-C-G-C-T-G-G-T-A-C-T...

Mutant 1: T-A-C-G-C-T-G-G-T-A-C-T...

Ah, so in the intact, it's T C G C T G G T A C T...

In mutant 1, it becomes T A C G C T G G T A C T...

Wait, so the second codon after the two changes is:

In intact, at that point, the codons are CTC (Leu), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc.

In mutant 1, perhaps the changes are:

After the initial TCT, the next codon is ACG (Thr). So the first few amino acids change from Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val... to Ser, Thr, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val... So no stop codon here.

Mutant 1 doesn't introduce a stop codon in the beginning. So probably not this one.

Mutant 2:

Sequence: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…

Comparing to intact, which is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…

So the first part: intact is TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Mutant 2: TCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG...

Wait, so the first change is:

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT...

Mutant 2: TCT AAG C GCT GGT ACT...

Hmm, so after ATG, the second codon in intact is TTT (Phe), but in mutant 2, it's TCT (Ser). Then the next codon in intact is CTC (Leu), but in mutant 2, it's AAG (Lys). Wait, that would change the amino acids, but again, does it introduce a stop codon?

Wait, let me write the exact changes. The intact gene has:

...TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT T...

Mutant 2 has:

...TCT AAG C GCT GGT ACT T...

Wait, perhaps the exact nucleotides differ. Let me write out the sequences for the first part.

Intact: T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A...

Mutant 2: T C T A A G C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A...

So, the second codon (after ATG) is TCT (Ser) instead of TTT (Phe). Then the next codon is AAG instead of CTC. So the third codon becomes Lys instead of Leu. Then, the fourth codon is GCT (Ala) again.

No stop codon in the first few. So that's not introducing a premature stop.

Mutant 3:

Sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Comparing to intact, which is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

So, looking at the changes:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG... (codons: Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val...)

Mutant3: ...TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG G...

Wait, let me break it down.

After ATG, the next parts:

Intact: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant3: TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, the second codon is TTT (Phe) same as in intact. Third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), but in Mutant3 it's TAC (Tyr). Then, the fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), same as in Mutant3. Then, fifth codon in intact is GGT (Gly), same as Mutant3.

Wait, but the next part: in intact, it's ACT TCT GTG GAT... So codons: Thr, Ser, Val, Asp.

In Mutant3, after GGT, the next codon is GTC (Val) instead of ACT (Thr). Then, the next codon is ACT (Thr), same as before.

So the sequence changes from Thr, Ser, Val, Asp to Val, Thr, Ser, Val, Asp.

So, the amino acids would change. But again, no stop codon introduced. The question is, does this change enough to disrupt the protein function? Maybe, but without a stop codon early, it's not as likely to eliminate the compound entirely.

Mutant4:

Sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Intact: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at the changes:

Intact: ...TTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGG... (Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val...)

Mutant4: ...TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, perhaps line by line:

Intact has after ATG: TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant4: TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Wait, so the second codon is same (Phe). Third codon in intact is CTC (Leu), in mutant4 it's TAC (Tyr). Fourth codon in intact is GCT (Ala), in mutant4 it's same perhaps? Or wait, perhaps I should compare the exact nucleotides.

Wait, perhaps in the intact, after TTT, the next nucleotides are CTC, which is Leu. In Mutant4, after TTT, it's TAC, which is Tyr. So the third codon changes from CTC (Leu) to TAC (Tyr). Then, the next codon in intact is GCT (Ala), but in Mutant4, after TAC, the next codon is GCT (Ala) as well? Or is there a difference?

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence after TAC is GCT, same as in intact. Then, the next codon in intact is GGT (Gly), but in Mutant4, it's ACT (Thr). So, the fourth codon is GGT (intact) vs ACT (mutant4).

So, the sequence becomes:

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT ...

So, the first few codons are:

- ATG (start)
- TTT (Phe)
- CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr)
- GCT (Ala) same?
- GGT (Gly) → ACT (Thr)
- TCT (Ser) same
- GTG (Val) same
- GAT (Asp) same...

So, no stop codon introduced. But perhaps the mutation disrupts a critical part of the gene.

Wait, but another possibility is a frameshift. Let me check if any of the mutations have an insertion or deletion that causes a frameshift.

In the given question, all the mutants have sequences that seem to be similar in length, so maybe no frameshifts. Let me check.

Intact length: Let's see, the given sequences end with TGA, which is a stop codon. So the length is the same, as all the mutants have the same length. So likely, no frameshifts, but substitutions.

Hmm, so without frameshifts, the only way to get a nonfunctional protein is to introduce a premature stop codon.

Looking again for any stop codons in the mutants.

Stop codons are TAA, TAG, or TGA.

In the given sequences, the last part ends with TGA in all cases, which is a stop codon. So the intact gene ends with ...TGA.

So, the question is, do any of the mutants have another stop codon earlier in the sequence?

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: Let's see, after the mutations, any TAA, TAG, or TGA earlier?

Looking at the sequence for each mutant:

Mutant1: The codons are, after ATG, TCT (Ser), ACG (Thr), C GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc. No early stop codon.

Mutant2: The codons after ATG are TCT (Ser), AAG (Lys), C GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), etc. No early stop.

Mutant3: The sequence after ATG is TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), GGT (Gly), GTC (Val), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc. No stop codons.

Mutant4: The sequence after ATG is TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), etc. No stop codons.

Wait, but wait. Let me look at the exact nucleotides again. Maybe I missed a stop codon.

Another approach: look for any occurrence of TAA, TAG, or TGA in the coding sequence before the natural stop.

Looking at each mutant's sequences.

Mutant1:

Looking at the nucleotide sequence:

...TCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...

Looking for TGA, TAG, TAA. Let's see.

ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

Wait, in the middle, there's GAA, which is Glu. Then CAT, ATT, TAT, TGT, CGC.

No TGA in the middle. The original stop is at the end.

Mutant2:

ATG TCT AAG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

No early TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Mutant3:

ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

No early stop.

Mutant4:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT...

Wait, let me look again. The sequence is 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Hmm, the part after ATG is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

Wait, ACT is Thr, then TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), CAT (His), ATT (Ile), TAT (Tyr), TGT (Cys), CGT (Arg), and then TGA.

No stop codons in the middle.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing a point. If the mutation is in the first exon, perhaps it's in a regulatory region, but the question says the target gene was sequenced. So, perhaps the mutation is in the coding region.

Another approach: which mutation introduces a stop codon early in the coding sequence?

Wait, none of the options do, so perhaps the correct approach is to find a mutation that changes a critical part of the gene product, perhaps the start codon or a key region.

Wait, the start codon is ATG. In all mutants, the start is intact. So that's fine.

Wait, perhaps the mutation creates a new start codon upstream, leading to a shorter protein? Or perhaps the mutation is in a critical region, like the active site of an enzyme.

Alternatively, perhaps a nonsense mutation (early stop) is present.

Wait, looking again, perhaps I made a mistake in checking for stop codons. Let's check each mutant again.

Mutant1: Looking for TGA, TAG, TAA. The only TGA is at the end. The rest: no.

Mutant2: Same, no early stops.

Mutant3: Same, no.

Mutant4: Same, no.

Hmm, maybe I should check if any of the mutations cause a missense mutation that disrupts the protein's function. But without knowing the protein structure, it's hard to tell which amino acid change is critical.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation leads to the loss of the start codon or frameshift. Wait, no, the start codon is intact in all.

Wait, perhaps the first few codons are more critical. For example, if the first codon after start is changed, it could affect the protein.

Wait, looking at the intact gene and mutants:

Mutant1: The first codon after ATG is TTT (Phe) → TCT (Ser). Then ACG (Thr) instead of CTC (Leu). So, the first few amino acids are Ser, Thr, Ala, etc. Could this disrupt the protein?

Mutant2: First codon after ATG is TTT → TCT (Ser). Then CTC → AAG (Lys). So, Ser, Lys, Ala...

Mutant3: The first codon after ATG is TTT, same. Then CTC → TAC (Tyr). So, Phe, Tyr, Ala...

Mutant4: First codon same, then CTC → TAC (Tyr). Then GCT same, then GGT → ACT (Thr). So, Phe, Tyr, Ala, Thr... 

Wait, perhaps the most drastic change is in Mutant4, where the fourth codon changes from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr). Gly is a small, non-reactive residue, while Thr is a bit bulkier but maybe that's not enough.

Alternatively, another approach: perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1, because the mutation is in the first exon and the initial changes may affect the protein's function. But without a stop codon, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps a nonsense mutation is present somewhere else. Wait, another way to look: perhaps the mutation introduces an additional stop codon earlier. 

Wait, looking again. Let me check Mutant4's sequence.

Mutant4:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Breaking it down:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA

So, the codons after ATG are:

1. TTT (Phe)
2. TAC (Tyr)
3. GCT (Ala)
4. ACT (Thr)
5. TCT (Ser)
6. GTG (Val)
7. GAT (Asp)
8. GAA (Glu)
9. CAT (His)
10. ATT (Ile)
11. TAT (Tyr)
12. TGT (Cys)
13. CGT (Arg)
14. TGA (Stop)

So, the sequence seems to go until TGA, same as intact. No early stop.

Wait, but what about the structure of the gene? It has five exons. So, perhaps the mutation is in the first exon, which is part of the coding region. So, any mutation in the coding sequence could change the protein.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the mutation that creates a stop codon early on. But none of the mutants have that.

Alternative plan: perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1, because the first few changes might disrupt a critical region, like the start of the protein.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation is a silent mutation (no change in amino acid), but that's unlikely as the question asks to eliminate the compound.

Wait, another angle: maybe the mutation creates a splice site disruption. But the question says the changes are in the first exon area, so perhaps intron-exon boundaries are not affected.

Wait, but the mutants were produced using EMS, which typically causes point mutations. So, looking for point mutations that create a stop codon.

Wait, looking again at Mutant4: after the TAC (Tyr), the next codon is GCT (Ala), then ACT (Thr). So, in the fourth codon, Gly (GGT) becomes Thr (ACT). So, the sequence is Phe, Tyr, Ala, Thr, Ser, Val, etc.

Mutant1: Ser, Thr, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val...

Hmm, perhaps another approach is to look for a nonsense mutation. Let's see:

In all the mutants, the only stop codon is at the end. So none of them have an early stop. So, perhaps the intended answer is the mutant that disrupts the gene's reading frame via a frameshift, but none of the options show that.

Wait, could I have missed a stop codon in any of them?

Wait, let me check Mutant2 again. The sequence is:

ATG TCT AAG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…

So, looking for TAA, TAG, TGA. The only TGA is at the end.

Wait, but in Mutant2, the third codon is AAG (Lys). Fourth is GCT (Ala). No, no stop codon.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the sequences. Let me re-examine each.

Another approach: perhaps the correct answer is the one where a stop codon is created in the middle.

Wait, looking again, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence is:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA

Wait, in the middle of this, does any triplet form a stop codon?

Looking at the nucleotides:

After ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT.

Looking for TAA, TAG, or TGA. The only TGA is at the end.

Hmm, so perhaps none of the mutants have a premature stop codon. Then, perhaps the correct answer is based on which mutation disrupts the gene's function the most, perhaps by creating a nonfunctional protein through a missense mutation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about disrupting the gene's function by a nonsense mutation, but if none do that, then perhaps the question is about the presence of a frameshift.

Wait, another possibility: the mutation is in the first exon, which may be part of the promoter region, but the question states that the mutation is in the first exon area, implying the coding region.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, which has a larger change in the sequence, perhaps disrupting a critical part of the gene. Let me see.

Mutant4's sequence after ATG is TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

In the intact gene, after ATG, the sequence is TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So, in Mutant4, after TTT, the next codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then, the following codon is GCT (Ala) same as intact. Then comes ACT (Thr) instead of GGT (Gly). So, the first few amino acids change from Phe, Leu, Ala, Gly, Thr, Ser... to Phe, Tyr, Ala, Thr, Ser...

I'm not sure if that's the most disruptive, but perhaps it's better than the others.

Alternatively, maybe Mutant1, because the changes are in the first codons, leading to early changes in the protein structure, possibly leading to a nonfunctional enzyme.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4. Because it changes the fourth codon from Gly to Thr. Gly is a small, non-reactive amino acid, while Thr is slightly bulkier. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the only way to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound is to disrupt the gene's function. If the gene is necessary for producing the compound, then a loss-of-function mutation would stop the compound.

Among the options, perhaps the mutant that causes the most drastic change in the initial exons is Mutant1, with two early changes: Phe to Ser, and Leu to Thr. Alternatively, Mutant4 changes the fourth codon from Gly to Thr.

But without knowing which part of the gene is most critical, perhaps the intended answer is Mutant1 because the change occurs in the first exon, which is near the start, potentially disrupting the function early.

Wait, another thought: perhaps one of the mutations leads to a frameshift, but I don't see any insertions or deletions. All the mutant sequences seem to have the same length as the intact gene.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in checking the length.

Looking at the sequences:

Intact: ...TGT CGT…TGA

Mutant1: ...TGT CGC…TGA

Same length.

Mutant2: ...TGT CGC…TGA → same length.

Mutant3: ...TGT CGT…TGA → same.

Mutant4: ...TGT CGT…TGA → same.

So no frameshift.

Back to the problem: the only way to eliminate the compound is to disrupt the gene's function. Without a premature stop codon, perhaps the intended answer is the mutation that changes the start codon. Wait, but all have the same start.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, as it has a larger portion of the sequence changed. Wait, looking again, the intact gene has G G T A C T T C T G T G G A..., while Mutant4 has A C T T C T G T G G A....

Wait, perhaps the change from GGT (Gly) to ACT (Thr) is in a critical region, leading to a nonfunctional enzyme.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1 because it changes the second codon from Phe to Ser and third from Leu to Thr, which might disrupt the protein structure early on.

But without knowing the exact function of the protein, it's hard to say. However, given the options, perhaps the intended correct answer is Mutant1, as it has a substitution in the earlier part of the gene.

Wait, but looking again, perhaps I should note that in Mutant1, the third codon is ACG (Thr) instead of CTC (Leu). Leucine is a hydrophobic amino acid, while Thr is polar. That could significantly change the protein structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because the fourth codon changes from Gly to Thr. Gly is a structure-breaking amino acid, and changing it could disrupt the protein's structure.

But I'm not certain. Another approach: perhaps the mutation that creates a stop codon in the first exon is the one. But in all cases, the stop is at the end.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any mutations that lead to a stop codon in the first exon.

Wait, the first exon starts after the start codon. So, any stop codon within the first exon would be early.

Looking again:

Mutant1's sequence in the first exon:

ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC...

No TGA, TAG, or TAA in the first exon.

Same for others.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is the one that introduces a missense mutation in a critical region. Since I can't determine that, perhaps the intended answer is Mutant1.

Wait, the question states that the gene has five exons and four introns. So the first exon is the first part. The changes in the first exon could be in the coding region, so a mutation there could change the protein.

In that case, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, which changes Gly to Thr. Glycine is often in regions where the protein needs to be flexible. Changing it might disrupt the structure.

Wait, but I'm not finding any of the mutations leading to a stop codon. So perhaps the intended answer is the one that creates the maximum disruption, perhaps a mutation that changes multiple codons early on, like Mutant1.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a larger change in the sequence, leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct answer is the one that introduces a stop codon in the first exon. But none do. So perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that disrupts the gene's reading frame, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps each of the mutations is a point mutation, and only one of them introduces a stop codon. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the presence of a TAA, TAG, or TGA in the middle of any of the mutant sequences.

Looking again:

Mutant1: After ATG, the codons are TCT, ACG, GCT, GGT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, GAA, etc. No TAA, TAG, or TGA except at the end.

Mutant2: TCT, AAG, GCT, GGT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, etc. No stop codons.

Mutant3: TTT, TAC, GCT, GGT, GTC, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, etc. No stops.

Mutant4: TTT, TAC, GCT, ACT, TCT, GTG, GAT, etc. No stops.

So none of the mutants introduce a premature stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the question's correct answer is based on the location of the mutation. The first exon is often the first part of the mRNA, so a mutation there could lead to a nonfunctional protein.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the fourth codon, which might be in a critical region.

But without any stop codons, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1, as it has a change in two early codons, leading to a significant change in the protein's structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it changes the fourth codon from Gly to Thr, which could disrupt a critical part of the protein structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant2, but I can't find a reason.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the effect of each mutation:

Mutant1: Changes two early amino acids. Might disrupt the protein.

Mutant2: Changes two amino acids, but perhaps less significantly.

Mutant3: Changes two amino acids, but in a way that might affect the structure.

Mutant4: Changes two amino acids and possibly disrupts a region.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because it has a larger change in the sequence.

But I'm not sure. Given the options, I'll go with the most drastic change in the first few codons. So Mutant1 has the first codon changed from Phe to Ser and the third from Leu to Thr. That's a significant change early on, which might disrupt the protein function.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, potentially by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein structure.

### Key Analysis of Each Mutant:
1. **Intact Gene Sequence**:
   - 5’-ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’
   - The sequence starts with ATG (start codon) and ends with TGA (stop codon).

2. **Mutant 1**:
   - Sequence: 5’-ATG TCT ACG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA-3’
   - Changes:
     - TTT (Phe) → TCT (Ser) at codon 2.
     - CTC (Leu) → ACG (Thr) at codon 3.
   - No premature stop codon introduced. The changes alter early amino acids, potentially disrupting the protein structure.

3. **Mutant 2**:
   - Sequence: 5’-ATG TCT AAG C GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC…TGA-3’
   - Changes:
     - TTT (Phe) → TCT (Ser) at codon 2.
     - CTC (Leu) → AAG (Lys) at codon 3.
   - No premature stop codon introduced. The changes affect early amino acids, but the impact on protein function is less clear compared to Mutant 1.

4. **Mutant 3**:
   - Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’
   - Changes:
     - CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr) at codon 3.
     - ACT (Thr) → GTC (Val) at codon 5.
   - No premature stop codon introduced. The changes alter amino acids, but the impact on protein function is less significant compared to Mutant 1.

5. **Mutant 4**:
   - Sequence: 5’-ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT…TGA-3’
   - Changes:
     - CTC (Leu) → TAC (Tyr) at codon 3.
     - GCT (Ala) → ACT (Thr) at codon 5.
   - No premature stop codon introduced. The changes alter amino acids, but the impact on protein function is less significant compared to Mutant 1.

### Conclusion:
None of the mutants introduce a premature stop codon. However, Mutant 1 has the most significant changes in the early codons (Phe → Ser and Leu → Thr), which are likely to disrupt the protein structure and function more drastically than the other mutations. This makes Mutant 1 the most likely candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.
