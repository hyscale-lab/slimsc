Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different distances in meters.

First, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. The general formula I think is the mean decay length, which is the speed of the particle multiplied by its lifetime. So, decay distance L = v * τ. But wait, what's τ? Oh right, the lifetime τ is related to the particle's width by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty says that Γ ≈ ħ/τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I should get the exact expressions right.

So, the lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. Then, the velocity v can be found using the relativistic energy relation. The production energy E_X is the total energy, which includes the rest mass and kinetic energy. But for a relativistic particle, E ≈ pc when the particle is moving at speeds close to light speed. Alternatively, the energy can be written as E = gamma * m * c². But since the mass is given in GeV, perhaps it's easier to work in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but then I'll have to convert units at the end.

Wait, maybe I can approach this without natural units first. Let's think about the relativistic energy. The energy E = γ m c². So γ = E / (m c²). But wait, in natural units, c=1 and ħ=1, but perhaps we can calculate it more straightforwardly.

Alternatively, another approach: The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Once we have τ, we can find the velocity v, and then L = v * τ.

But wait, what is v for a particle at high energy? Let me think. The velocity can be approximated from the energy. Since E is much larger than the rest mass (E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV), the particle is ultra-relativistic. So, E ≈ pc, and p ≈ gamma m v. Wait, but in that case, p = gamma m v, and E = gamma m c². So, if E ≈ pc, then E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). Hmm, but since E >> m c², we can approximate E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E / c. Then, gamma is E/(m c²), but wait, let's compute gamma.

Wait, let's get more precise. The total energy E is given, so E = γ m c². The momentum p is γ m v. So velocity v can be found from E and p. Alternatively, since E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2, so p = sqrt( (E^2 - (mc²)^2) ) / c.

But with E much larger than m c², p ≈ E / c. So, v can be approximated as (pc²)/(E) ? Wait, maybe another way. Since E = γ m c² and p = γ m v, so v = (p c²) / E.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find the velocity. E = γ m c², p = γ m v. So, p = (E / (gamma m c²)) ) * gamma m v → p = (E v) / (c²). Hmm, but that seems a bit tangled.

Alternatively, since E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2, we can solve for p:

p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c.

For E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV, so m c² is 1.2 GeV. So E² is (8)^2 =64 (GeV)^2, m c² squared is 1.44. So E² - (mc²)^2 = 64 - 1.44 =62.56, which is about 62.56 GeV². Then p = sqrt(62.56) GeV / c ≈ 7.91 GeV/c.

So p ≈7.91 GeV/c. Then, velocity v = (p c) / gamma * c. Wait, but gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 ≈6.6667.

Wait, gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is about 6.6667.

Now, v can be found using beta = v/c = p c / (gamma m c²) ) → beta = (p c) / (gamma m c²) ) = p/(gamma m c). Wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, beta = v/c = (p c²)/(E). Because, from E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v. So, p c² = gamma m v c² = gamma m c² v = E v.

So, v = (p c²) / E. So, substituting in the numbers:

p =7.91 GeV/c, E=8 GeV.

v = (7.91 GeV/c * c² ) / 8 GeV. The GeV cancels, c units: (7.91 * c^2) / (8 c) ) = (7.91 /8 ) c. 7.91 /8 is approximately 0.98875. So v ≈ 0.98875 c, which is about 0.989c.

Alternatively, I could have used beta = p / (E/c) → because E = pc when v≈c. So beta ≈ p c / E. Which is 7.91 GeV/c * c / 8 GeV = 7.91/8 ≈0.98875. Same result. So, velocity is about 0.98875c.

Now, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. But we have Γ in MeV. Let's convert units.

Gamma is given as 320 MeV. Let me write ħ in units of GeV·seconds.

I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·seconds.

So, ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV s.

Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So, τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s ) / 0.32 GeV ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32 ) s.

Compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 = approx 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me calculate 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32.

6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 → let's compute that. 0.32 * 20 =6.4, so 6.4/0.32=20. 0.182 /0.32 = ~0.56875. So 20.56875.

So 20.56875e-25 s =2.056875e-24 s.

So τ ≈2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the decay length L is v * τ.

v is 0.98875 c.

Speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So v = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.96625e8 m/s.

Multiply by τ:

L =2.96625e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = ?

Let me compute 2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Multiply the coefficients: 2.96625 * 2.056875 ≈ approx 6.117. Let me compute it more accurately.

2.96625 * 2.056875.

First, 2.96625 *2 =5.9325.

2.96625 *0.056875= ?

Wait, 0.056875 is 9/158 approx? Not sure, perhaps better to compute 2.96625 *0.056875.

Let me compute:

0.056875 = 56875e-7 = 0.05 + 0.006875.

2.96625 *0.05 = 0.1483125.

2.96625 *0.006875 = 0.02034375.

Adding these: 0.1483125 +0.02034375=0.16865625.

So total is 5.9325 +0.16865625=6.10115625.

So approximately 6.101156e(8-24) m.

Wait, because 2.96625e8 *2.056875e-24 is 6.101156e-16 m.

So L ≈6.10e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are around 6e-16. The options are:

A)5.0223 * 1e-16 m

B)4.0655 *1e-15 m

C)5.0223 *1e-15 m

D)4.0655 *1e-16 m

Hmm, none of these match 6e-16. Did I make a mistake?

Let's go back and check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the lifetime. Hmm. Let me recheck the steps.

Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV s.

So τ = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 =6.582 /0.32=20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s. That seems correct.

Velocity calculation: p is sqrt(8^2 -1.2^2 )= sqrt(64-1.44)=sqrt(62.56)= approx 7.91 GeV/c.

So v = (p c ) / E → (7.91 GeV/c * c ) / 8 GeV )= 7.91/8 c ≈0.98875c.

Then, L= v * τ.

v is 0.98875 *3e8 m/s≈2.966e8 m/s.

τ is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L=2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Compute 2.966e8 *2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) *1e-16.

Wait, 2.966 *2.056875= ?

2 *2.056875=4.11375

0.966 *2.056875 = let's compute.

0.966 → 1 - 0.034.

So 2.056875 *0.966 = 2.056875*(1-0.034)=2.056875 - (2.056875 *0.034)

Compute 2.056875 *0.034:

0.034 is 3.4e-2.

2.056875 *0.034= approximately 0.070 (since 2*0.034=0.068, and 0.056875*0.034 ≈0.001934, so total about 0.069934).

So 2.056875 *0.966 ≈2.056875 - 0.069934=1.986941.

So total 2.966 *2.056875 ≈4.11375 +1.986941 =6.100691.

So 6.100691e-16 meters.

But the options don't have this. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the velocity. Another approach: let's use beta = v/c = p/(E/c) → p is in GeV/c.

So, beta = p / (E/c) ) → E is GeV, p is GeV/c. So beta = (GeV/c) * c / GeV )= (GeV c)/(GeV c) ). Wait, that makes sense: beta = (p c ) / E.

So, p =7.91 GeV/c.

So beta = (7.91 GeV/c * c ) / 8 GeV ) → (7.91 GeV ) / 8 GeV = 7.91/8=0.98875. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation of the velocity? Alternatively, perhaps using gamma = E/(m c²) and beta = sqrt(1-1/gamma²).

Gamma is 8 /1.2=6.6666667.

So, 1/gamma²= (1.2/8)^2 = (3/20)^2=9/400=0.0225.

So 1 - 1/gamma²=1 - 0.0225=0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887, which matches the earlier calculation. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the lifetime. Let me double-check the units.

Gamma is 320 MeV=0.32 GeV.

Tau = ħ / (Gamma). ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV s.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈2.056875e-24 seconds.

Yes, that's correct.

So L= v * tau= (0.98875c) * (2.056875e-24 s).

c=3e8 m/s.

So 0.98875 *3e8=2.96625e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.10069e-16 meters.

But the options are A)5.02e-16, D)4.06e-16, etc. So none match 6e-16.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the decay width. Oh wait! The mean lifetime is actually tau = ħ / (Gamma). But Gamma is the total decay width, which is the width in energy. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the production energy is 8 GeV, but the particle's mass is 1.2 GeV. So when it's produced, perhaps it's not at rest? No, the decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime and velocity. So I think the approach is correct.

Wait another thing: perhaps I should have used the average lifetime of the particle as tau = ħ / (Gamma), but considering that the production energy is higher, does that affect the lifetime? No, because the lifetime is a property of the particle and doesn't depend on the energy at which it's produced.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation when computing L. Let me recompute it.

Compute 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

2.966e8 = 2.966 × 1e8.

2.056875e-24 = 2.056875 × 1e-24.

Multiply them:

2.966 * 2.056875 = Let me compute that accurately.

2 *2.056875 =4.11375
0.966 * 2.056875 → compute 2 *0.966=1.932; 0.056875 *0.966= approx 0.05487.

So 0.966 *2.056875=1.932 +0.05487=1.98687.

So 4.11375 +1.98687=6.10062.

So 6.10062 × 1e8 × 1e-24 =6.10062 ×1e-16 meters.

Hmm, so 6.10e-16 m. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, maybe I should have used the relativistic formula for the mean decay length. Another approach: The mean decay length is L = (gamma * beta) * c * tau.

Wait, because L = v * tau, and v = beta c. So L = beta c tau.

But tau is ħ/(Gamma). So L = beta c ( ħ / Gamma ).

Wait, maybe a more precise formula is better. Let me re-express L in terms of E, m, and Gamma.

We have beta = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2 ) → but since E is much larger than m c², beta ≈1. So beta can be approximated as E/(sqrt(E^2 - m^2)) * c? Alternatively, perhaps using the relation beta = p c / E.

Wait, let's use the precise formula.

L = (v * tau) = (beta c) * ( ħ / Gamma )

But beta = p c / E, and p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c.

So beta = [ sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c ] * c / E = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) ) / (E c ) ) * c / E? Wait, perhaps it's better to write beta = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E )^2 )

So L = [ sqrt(1 - (m c²/E )^2 ) * c ] * [ ħ / Gamma ]

Let me plug in the numbers:

E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

c^2 is (3e8 m/s)^2, but perhaps in units where c=1, but let's compute it in SI units.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute the term sqrt(1 - (m c²/E )^2 ):

m c² =1.2 GeV.

E =8 GeV.

So (m c²/E )= 1.2/8=0.15.

So (m c²/E )^2 =0.0225.

sqrt(1-0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887, which matches the earlier beta. So beta is 0.9887.

So L= 0.9887 * c * ħ / Gamma.

c=3e8 m/s.

ħ=6.582e-25 GeV s.

Gamma=0.32 GeV.

So L =0.9887 *3e8 m/s *6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV.

Units: GeV cancels. Seconds cancel. So units are m.

Compute:

0.9887 *3e8 = 2.966e8.

Multiply by 6.582e-25: 2.966e8 *6.582e-25 = (2.966 *6.582 )e-17.

2.966 *6.582 → let's compute: 3*6.582=19.746; 0.966 *6.582≈6.367. So total approx 19.746 +6.367=26.113.

So 26.113e-17.

Divide by 0.32: 26.113 /0.32= approx 81.603125.

So 81.603125e-17=8.1603125e-16 meters.

Wait, that's about 8.16e-16 meters, which is larger than the earlier 6e-16. Hmm, but that doesn't match the options either.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me recompute step by step.

Compute 0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.9661e8.

2.9661e8 *6.582e-25 = (2.9661 *6.582) * 1e8 *1e-25 = (19.609) *1e-17=1.9609e-16.

Then, divide by 0.32: 1.9609e-16 /0.32 = (1.9609/0.32) e-16 → approx 6.1278e-16.

Which matches the earlier result of approximately 6.1e-16 m.

But none of the options are close to 6e-16. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the options are A)5.02e-16, D)4.06e-16.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere. Let's check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I should not have used c in m/s, but instead in GeV terms. Because, when working with natural units where ħ = c =1, the conversions can get tricky. Let me try a different approach, calculating everything in natural units and then converting to meters.

In natural units (ħ = c =1), the width Γ is given in GeV. The lifetime τ would be in natural units of GeV^-1. Then, since c=1, the decay length L is v * tau, but v is in units (since c=1, v is a dimensionless factor).

Wait, perhaps I can compute the decay length in natural units first, then convert to meters.

So, in natural units:

Gamma Γ =320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

Tau = 1 / Gamma = 1 / 0.32 GeV = approx 3.125 GeV^-1.

But wait, no: in natural units, ħ=1, so tau = ħ / Gamma → but ħ is 1 in GeV s units? Wait, perhaps this approach isn't correct. Maybe it's getting too confusing.

An alternative approach: Let's use the formula for the decay length in terms of E, m, and Gamma.

The decay length L is given by L = (E c tau) / sqrt( E^2 - m^2 c^4 ). But I'm not entirely confident about this formula.

Wait, another approach I've heard of is the decay length formula: L = c * tau * beta gamma. Because, L = v * tau, and v = beta c, so L = beta c tau. And beta gamma is (v/c) gamma. Since gamma = E/(m c²), and beta = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2 ), then beta gamma = (E/(m c²)) * sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

Alternatively, beta gamma = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) )/(m c^2 ), because (E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → beta gamma = (E c )/(m c² ) ) → beta gamma = E/(m c ).

Wait, so L = beta gamma c tau.

Tau is ħ/(Gamma).

So, L = (E/(m c )) * c * ( ħ / Gamma ) → E * ħ / ( m c Gamma )

Wait, that's an interesting formula. Let me write it down: L = (E * ħ ) / ( m c Gamma )

Plugging in the numbers:

E =8 GeV,

m=1.2 GeV,

Gamma=0.32 GeV,

ħ=6.582e-25 GeV s,

c=3e8 m/s.

But wait, let me make sure the units are correct.

E is in GeV,

m is in GeV/c²,

Wait, no, m is given as m_X=1.2 GeV, but in reality, the mass should be in GeV/c². Hmm, perhaps the problem statement has m_X=1.2 GeV, which is actually GeV/c² because E=mc².

Wait, but in any case, perhaps to compute L correctly using the formula:

L = (E * ħ ) / ( m c Gamma )

But let me check the units.

E is GeV,

m is GeV/c²,

c is m/s,

Gamma is GeV.

So,

L = ( GeV * GeV s ) / ( GeV/c² * m/s * GeV )

Let me compute the units:

Gev in numerator: GeV * GeV s = GeV^2 s.

Denominator: GeV/c² * m/s * GeV → GeV^2 (m) / (c^2 s).

So overall units:

GeV^2 s / [ GeV^2 (m) / (c^2 s) ) ] = s^2 * c^2 / m.

Wait, that's not meters. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is L = (E * ħ c ) / ( m c^2 Gamma )

Let me compute the units for that.

E [GeV], ħ [GeV s], c [m/s], m [GeV/c²], Gamma [GeV].

So,

E * ħ c → GeV * GeV s * m/s → GeV^2 m.

Denominator: m c^2 Gamma → (GeV/c²) * (m²/s²) * GeV → GeV^2 m²/(s² c²).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me just try plugging the numbers into the formula and see if the units work.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula L = (E * ħ c ) / ( m c^2 Gamma ) * (1/c) )

Wait, but I'm not confident. Perhaps the correct formula is L = c * tau * beta gamma.

Yes, let's use that approach.

Tau = ħ / Gamma → tau=6.582e-25 GeV s /0.32 GeV → 2.056875e-24 s.

Beta gamma is (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )/( m c^2 )

Wait, beta gamma = E/(m c^2 ) * sqrt(1 - (m c^2/E )^2 )

Alternatively, beta gamma = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) ) / ( m c^2 )

So,

E=8 GeV,

m c^2=1.2 GeV.

So,

E² - (m c^2 )² = 64 -1.44 =62.56.

sqrt(62.56)=7.91.

So beta gamma=7.91 GeV / (1.2 GeV ) =7.91 /1.2 ≈6.5917.

So,

L = c * tau * beta gamma = (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) *6.5917.

Compute:

3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16.

Multiply by 6.5917: 6.170625e-16 *6.5917 ≈4.074e-15 m.

Wait, 6.17e-16 *6.59 is approximately 4.07e-15 m.

Hmm, that's 4.07e-15 meters. Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option D is4.0655e-16 m.

So, 4.07e-15 is close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

But wait, earlier calculations gave me about 6.1e-16 m, but this approach gives 4.07e-15 m.

Wait, I must have made a mistake earlier. What's the discrepancy here?

Ah! Earlier, I used L = v * tau, which is beta c tau. But when I used the beta gamma approach, I used L = c * tau * beta gamma.

Wait, beta gamma is (beta c)(gamma) = (v)(gamma). Hmm, perhaps the formula is L = (beta gamma c) * tau.

Wait, tau is in seconds. So,

L = (beta gamma c) * tau.

So, beta gamma is 6.5917,

c =3e8 m/s,

tau= 2.056875e-24 s.

So,

L=6.5917 *3e8 *2.056875e-24.

Compute 6.5917 *3e8 =1.9775e9.

1.9775e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.9775 *2.056875 )e-15.

1.9775 *2.056875 = approx 4.074.

So L≈4.074e-15 m → which is about 4.07e-15 m.

Which matches option B (4.0655e-15 m) and D (4.0655e-16 m) is much smaller. So option B is the closest.

Wait, but earlier when I did the first approach, I thought I had 6e-16 m, but that was incorrect because I forgot to include the gamma factor. So the correct approach is to use L= c * tau * beta gamma.

So the correct decay distance is approximately 4.07e-15 m, which is option B (4.0655e-15 m), considering rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more precisely.

Compute beta gamma =7.91 /1.2 =6.591666667.

Then,

L= c * tau * beta gamma.

c=3e8 m/s,

tau= 6.582e-25 /0.32 =2.056875e-24 s.

So,

L=3e8 *2.056875e-24 *6.591666667.

Compute:

3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16.

Multiply by6.591666667 →6.170625e-16 *6.591666667.

Compute 6.170625 *6.591666667.

Let me compute 6 *6.591666667= 39.55.

0.170625 *6.591666667 ≈1.122.

Total approx 40.672.

So 40.672e-16 m=4.0672e-15 m.

Which is very close to option B, 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = c \cdot \tau \cdot \beta \gamma
\]

where:
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the lifetime of the particle,
- \( \beta \gamma \) is the relativistic factor.

### Step 1: Calculate the lifetime \( \tau \)
The lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \),
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),

we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \gamma \)
The relativistic factor \( \beta \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\beta \gamma = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - m^2 c^4}}{m c^2}
\]

Given:
- \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m c^2 = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \),

we compute:

\[
E^2 - (m c^2)^2 = 8^2 - 1.2^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56,
\]
\[
\sqrt{62.56} = 7.91 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\beta \gamma = \frac{7.91}{1.2} \approx 6.5917.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the decay length \( L \)
Using the formula \( L = c \cdot \tau \cdot \beta \gamma \), we substitute the values:

\[
L = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 6.5917.
\]

First, calculate \( 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \):

\[
3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16}.
\]

Next, multiply by \( 6.5917 \):

\[
L = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \cdot 6.5917 \approx 4.074 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The calculated decay length \( L \approx 4.074 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B**, \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson resonance decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through step by step.

The question is asking about the mean decay distance of a meson X. The given parameters are the production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and the width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each with different distances in meters.

First, I remember that the mean decay distance is related to the lifetime of the particle. The general formula I think is the mean decay length, which is the speed of the particle multiplied by its lifetime. So, decay distance L = v * τ. But wait, what's τ? Oh right, the lifetime τ is related to the particle's width by the uncertainty principle. The Heisenberg uncertainty says that Γ ≈ ħ/τ, so τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I should get the exact expressions right.

So, the lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. Then, the velocity v can be found using the relativistic energy relation. The production energy E_X is the total energy, which includes the rest mass and kinetic energy. But for a relativistic particle, E ≈ pc when the particle is moving at speeds close to light speed. Alternatively, the energy can be written as E = gamma * m * c². But since the mass is given in GeV, perhaps it's easier to work in natural units where c=1 and ħ=1, but then I'll have to convert units at the end.

Wait, maybe I can approach this without natural units first. Let's think about the relativistic energy. The energy E = γ m c². So γ = E / (m c²). But wait, in natural units, c=1 and ħ=1, but perhaps we can calculate it more straightforwardly.

Alternatively, another approach: The decay width Γ is related to the lifetime τ. The relation is Γ = ħ / τ. So τ = ħ / Γ. Once we have τ, we can find the velocity v, and then L = v * τ.

But wait, what is v for a particle at high energy? Let me think. The velocity can be approximated from the energy. Since E is much larger than the rest mass (E=8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV), the particle is ultra-relativistic. So, E ≈ pc, and p ≈ gamma m v. Wait, but in that case, p = gamma m v, and E = gamma m c². So, if E ≈ pc, then E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). Hmm, but since E >> m c², we can approximate E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E / c. Then, gamma is E/(m c²), but wait, let's compute gamma.

Wait, let's get more precise. The total energy E is given, so E = γ m c². The momentum p is γ m v. So velocity v can be found from E and p. Alternatively, since E² = (pc)^2 + (mc²)^2, so p = sqrt( (E^2 - (mc²)^2) ) / c.

But with E much larger than m c², p ≈ E / c. So, v can be approximated as (pc²)/(E) ? Wait, maybe another way. Since E = γ m c² and p = γ m v, so v = (p c²) / E.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find the velocity. E = γ m c², p = γ m v. So, p = (E / (gamma m c²)) ) * gamma m v → p = (E v) / (c²). Hmm, but that seems a bit tangled.

Alternatively, since E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2, we can solve for p:

p = sqrt(E² - (m c²)^2) / c.

For E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV, so m c² is 1.2 GeV. So E² is (8)^2 =64 (GeV)^2, m c² squared is 1.44. So E² - (mc²)^2 = 64 - 1.44 =62.56, which is about 62.56 GeV². Then p = sqrt(62.56) GeV / c ≈ 7.91 GeV/c.

So p ≈7.91 GeV/c. Then, velocity v = (p c) / gamma * c. Wait, but gamma = E/(m c²) = 8 / 1.2 ≈6.6667.

Wait, gamma is 8 / 1.2 = 6.666... So gamma is about 6.6667.

Now, v can be found using beta = v/c = p c / (gamma m c²) ) → beta = (p c) / (gamma m c²) ) = p/(gamma m c). Wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, beta = v/c = (p c²)/(E). Because, from E = gamma m c², and p = gamma m v. So, p c² = gamma m v c² = gamma m c² v = E v.

So, v = (p c²) / E. So, substituting in the numbers:

p =7.91 GeV/c, E=8 GeV.

v = (7.91 GeV/c * c² ) / 8 GeV. The GeV cancels, c units: (7.91 * c^2) / (8 c) ) = (7.91 /8 ) c. 7.91 /8 is approximately 0.98875. So v ≈ 0.98875 c, which is about 0.989c.

Alternatively, I could have used beta = p / (E/c) → because E = pc when v≈c. So beta ≈ p c / E. Which is 7.91 GeV/c * c / 8 GeV = 7.91/8 ≈0.98875. Same result. So, velocity is about 0.98875c.

Now, the lifetime τ is ħ / Γ. But we have Γ in MeV. Let's convert units.

Gamma is given as 320 MeV. Let me write ħ in units of GeV·seconds.

I remember that ħ is approximately 6.582 x 10^-25 GeV·seconds.

So, ħ = 6.582e-25 GeV s.

Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

So, τ = ħ / Γ = (6.582e-25 GeV s ) / 0.32 GeV ) = (6.582e-25 / 0.32 ) s.

Compute that: 6.582 / 0.32 = approx 20.56875. So 20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 seconds.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me calculate 6.582e-25 divided by 0.32.

6.582e-25 / 0.32 = (6.582 / 0.32 ) * 1e-25.

6.582 / 0.32 → let's compute that. 0.32 * 20 =6.4, so 6.4/0.32=20. 0.182 /0.32 = ~0.56875. So 20.56875.

So 20.56875e-25 s =2.056875e-24 s.

So τ ≈2.056875e-24 seconds.

Now, the decay length L is v * τ.

v is 0.98875 c.

Speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So v = 0.98875 * 3e8 m/s ≈ 2.96625e8 m/s.

Multiply by τ:

L =2.96625e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s = ?

Let me compute 2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24.

Multiply the coefficients: 2.96625 * 2.056875 ≈ approx 6.117. Let me compute it more accurately.

2.96625 * 2.056875.

First, 2.96625 *2 =5.9325.

2.96625 *0.056875= ?

Wait, 0.056875 is 9/158 approx? Not sure, perhaps better to compute 2.96625 *0.056875.

Let me compute:

0.056875 = 56875e-7 = 0.05 + 0.006875.

2.96625 *0.05 = 0.1483125.

2.96625 *0.006875 = 0.02034375.

Adding these: 0.1483125 +0.02034375=0.16865625.

So total is 5.9325 +0.16865625=6.10115625.

So approximately 6.101156e(8-24) m.

Wait, because 2.96625e8 *2.056875e-24 is 6.101156e-16 m.

So L ≈6.10e-16 meters.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are around 6e-16. The options are:

A)5.0223 * 1e-16 m

B)4.0655 *1e-15 m

C)5.0223 *1e-15 m

D)4.0655 *1e-16 m

Hmm, none of these match 6e-16. Did I make a mistake?

Let's go back and check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the lifetime. Hmm. Let me recheck the steps.

Gamma is 320 MeV = 0.32 GeV. ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV s.

So τ = ħ / Γ = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 =6.582 /0.32=20.56875e-25 s → 2.056875e-24 s. That seems correct.

Velocity calculation: p is sqrt(8^2 -1.2^2 )= sqrt(64-1.44)=sqrt(62.56)= approx 7.91 GeV/c.

So v = (p c ) / E → (7.91 GeV/c * c ) / 8 GeV )= 7.91/8 c ≈0.98875c.

Then, L= v * τ.

v is 0.98875 *3e8 m/s≈2.966e8 m/s.

τ is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L=2.966e8 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Compute 2.966e8 *2.056875e-24 = (2.966 * 2.056875) *1e-16.

Wait, 2.966 *2.056875= ?

2 *2.056875=4.11375

0.966 *2.056875 = let's compute.

0.966 → 1 - 0.034.

So 2.056875 *0.966 = 2.056875*(1-0.034)=2.056875 - (2.056875 *0.034)

Compute 2.056875 *0.034:

0.034 is 3.4e-2.

2.056875 *0.034= approximately 0.070 (since 2*0.034=0.068, and 0.056875*0.034 ≈0.001934, so total about 0.069934).

So 2.056875 *0.966 ≈2.056875 - 0.069934=1.986941.

So total 2.966 *2.056875 ≈4.11375 +1.986941 =6.100691.

So 6.100691e-16 meters.

But the options don't have this. Hmmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the velocity. Another approach: let's use beta = v/c = p/(E/c) → p is in GeV/c.

So, beta = p / (E/c) ) → E is GeV, p is GeV/c. So beta = (GeV/c) * c / GeV )= (GeV c)/(GeV c) ). Wait, that makes sense: beta = (p c ) / E.

So, p =7.91 GeV/c.

So beta = (7.91 GeV/c * c ) / 8 GeV ) → (7.91 GeV ) / 8 GeV = 7.91/8=0.98875. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation of the velocity? Alternatively, perhaps using gamma = E/(m c²) and beta = sqrt(1-1/gamma²).

Gamma is 8 /1.2=6.6666667.

So, 1/gamma²= (1.2/8)^2 = (3/20)^2=9/400=0.0225.

So 1 - 1/gamma²=1 - 0.0225=0.9775.

So beta = sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887, which matches the earlier calculation. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the lifetime. Let me double-check the units.

Gamma is 320 MeV=0.32 GeV.

Tau = ħ / (Gamma). ħ is 6.582e-25 GeV s.

So tau = 6.582e-25 / 0.32 ≈2.056875e-24 seconds.

Yes, that's correct.

So L= v * tau= (0.98875c) * (2.056875e-24 s).

c=3e8 m/s.

So 0.98875 *3e8=2.96625e8 m/s.

Multiply by 2.056875e-24 s:

2.96625e8 * 2.056875e-24 = 6.10069e-16 meters.

But the options are A)5.02e-16, D)4.06e-16, etc. So none match 6e-16.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the decay width. Oh wait! The mean lifetime is actually tau = ħ / (Gamma). But Gamma is the total decay width, which is the width in energy. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the production energy is 8 GeV, but the particle's mass is 1.2 GeV. So when it's produced, perhaps it's not at rest? No, the decay distance depends on the particle's lifetime and velocity. So I think the approach is correct.

Wait another thing: perhaps I should have used the average lifetime of the particle as tau = ħ / (Gamma), but considering that the production energy is higher, does that affect the lifetime? No, because the lifetime is a property of the particle and doesn't depend on the energy at which it's produced.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation when computing L. Let me recompute it.

Compute 2.966e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

2.966e8 = 2.966 × 1e8.

2.056875e-24 = 2.056875 × 1e-24.

Multiply them:

2.966 * 2.056875 = Let me compute that accurately.

2 *2.056875 =4.11375
0.966 * 2.056875 → compute 2 *0.966=1.932; 0.056875 *0.966= approx 0.05487.

So 0.966 *2.056875=1.932 +0.05487=1.98687.

So 4.11375 +1.98687=6.10062.

So 6.10062 × 1e8 × 1e-24 =6.10062 ×1e-16 meters.

Hmm, so 6.10e-16 m. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, maybe I should have used the relativistic formula for the mean decay length. Another approach: The mean decay length is L = (gamma * beta) * c * tau.

Wait, because L = v * tau, and v = beta c. So L = beta c tau.

But tau is ħ/(Gamma). So L = beta c ( ħ / Gamma ).

Wait, maybe a more precise formula is better. Let me re-express L in terms of E, m, and Gamma.

We have beta = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2 ) → but since E is much larger than m c², beta ≈1. So beta can be approximated as E/(sqrt(E^2 - m^2)) * c? Alternatively, perhaps using the relation beta = p c / E.

Wait, let's use the precise formula.

L = (v * tau) = (beta c) * ( ħ / Gamma )

But beta = p c / E, and p = sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c.

So beta = [ sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c ] * c / E = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) ) / (E c ) ) * c / E? Wait, perhaps it's better to write beta = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E )^2 )

So L = [ sqrt(1 - (m c²/E )^2 ) * c ] * [ ħ / Gamma ]

Let me plug in the numbers:

E =8 GeV, m=1.2 GeV.

c^2 is (3e8 m/s)^2, but perhaps in units where c=1, but let's compute it in SI units.

Wait, but perhaps I can compute the term sqrt(1 - (m c²/E )^2 ):

m c² =1.2 GeV.

E =8 GeV.

So (m c²/E )= 1.2/8=0.15.

So (m c²/E )^2 =0.0225.

sqrt(1-0.0225)=sqrt(0.9775)= approx 0.9887, which matches the earlier beta. So beta is 0.9887.

So L= 0.9887 * c * ħ / Gamma.

c=3e8 m/s.

ħ=6.582e-25 GeV s.

Gamma=0.32 GeV.

So L =0.9887 *3e8 m/s *6.582e-25 GeV s / 0.32 GeV.

Units: GeV cancels. Seconds cancel. So units are m.

Compute:

0.9887 *3e8 = 2.966e8.

Multiply by 6.582e-25: 2.966e8 *6.582e-25 = (2.966 *6.582 )e-17.

2.966 *6.582 → let's compute: 3*6.582=19.746; 0.966 *6.582≈6.367. So total approx 19.746 +6.367=26.113.

So 26.113e-17.

Divide by 0.32: 26.113 /0.32= approx 81.603125.

So 81.603125e-17=8.1603125e-16 meters.

Wait, that's about 8.16e-16 meters, which is larger than the earlier 6e-16. Hmm, but that doesn't match the options either.

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me recompute step by step.

Compute 0.9887 * 3e8 = 2.9661e8.

2.9661e8 *6.582e-25 = (2.9661 *6.582) * 1e8 *1e-25 = (19.609) *1e-17=1.9609e-16.

Then, divide by 0.32: 1.9609e-16 /0.32 = (1.9609/0.32) e-16 → approx 6.1278e-16.

Which matches the earlier result of approximately 6.1e-16 m.

But none of the options are close to 6e-16. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the options are A)5.02e-16, D)4.06e-16.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units somewhere. Let's check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I should not have used c in m/s, but instead in GeV terms. Because, when working with natural units where ħ = c =1, the conversions can get tricky. Let me try a different approach, calculating everything in natural units and then converting to meters.

In natural units (ħ = c =1), the width Γ is given in GeV. The lifetime τ would be in natural units of GeV^-1. Then, since c=1, the decay length L is v * tau, but v is in units (since c=1, v is a dimensionless factor).

Wait, perhaps I can compute the decay length in natural units first, then convert to meters.

So, in natural units:

Gamma Γ =320 MeV = 0.32 GeV.

Tau = 1 / Gamma = 1 / 0.32 GeV = approx 3.125 GeV^-1.

But wait, no: in natural units, ħ=1, so tau = ħ / Gamma → but ħ is 1 in GeV s units? Wait, perhaps this approach isn't correct. Maybe it's getting too confusing.

An alternative approach: Let's use the formula for the decay length in terms of E, m, and Gamma.

The decay length L is given by L = (E c tau) / sqrt( E^2 - m^2 c^4 ). But I'm not entirely confident about this formula.

Wait, another approach I've heard of is the decay length formula: L = c * tau * beta gamma. Because, L = v * tau, and v = beta c, so L = beta c tau. And beta gamma is (v/c) gamma. Since gamma = E/(m c²), and beta = sqrt(1 - (m c²/E)^2 ), then beta gamma = (E/(m c²)) * sqrt(1 - (m^2 c^4)/(E^2)).

Alternatively, beta gamma = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) )/(m c^2 ), because (E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 → beta gamma = (E c )/(m c² ) ) → beta gamma = E/(m c ).

Wait, so L = beta gamma c tau.

Tau is ħ/(Gamma).

So, L = (E/(m c )) * c * ( ħ / Gamma ) → E * ħ / ( m c Gamma )

Wait, that's an interesting formula. Let me write it down: L = (E * ħ ) / ( m c Gamma )

Plugging in the numbers:

E =8 GeV,

m=1.2 GeV,

Gamma=0.32 GeV,

ħ=6.582e-25 GeV s,

c=3e8 m/s.

But wait, let me make sure the units are correct.

E is in GeV,

m is in GeV/c²,

Wait, no, m is given as m_X=1.2 GeV, but in reality, the mass should be in GeV/c². Hmm, perhaps the problem statement has m_X=1.2 GeV, which is actually GeV/c² because E=mc².

Wait, but in any case, perhaps to compute L correctly using the formula:

L = (E * ħ ) / ( m c Gamma )

But let me check the units.

E is GeV,

m is GeV/c²,

c is m/s,

Gamma is GeV.

So,

L = ( GeV * GeV s ) / ( GeV/c² * m/s * GeV )

Let me compute the units:

Gev in numerator: GeV * GeV s = GeV^2 s.

Denominator: GeV/c² * m/s * GeV → GeV^2 (m) / (c^2 s).

So overall units:

GeV^2 s / [ GeV^2 (m) / (c^2 s) ) ] = s^2 * c^2 / m.

Wait, that's not meters. Hmm, perhaps I messed up the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is L = (E * ħ c ) / ( m c^2 Gamma )

Let me compute the units for that.

E [GeV], ħ [GeV s], c [m/s], m [GeV/c²], Gamma [GeV].

So,

E * ħ c → GeV * GeV s * m/s → GeV^2 m.

Denominator: m c^2 Gamma → (GeV/c²) * (m²/s²) * GeV → GeV^2 m²/(s² c²).

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me just try plugging the numbers into the formula and see if the units work.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula L = (E * ħ c ) / ( m c^2 Gamma ) * (1/c) )

Wait, but I'm not confident. Perhaps the correct formula is L = c * tau * beta gamma.

Yes, let's use that approach.

Tau = ħ / Gamma → tau=6.582e-25 GeV s /0.32 GeV → 2.056875e-24 s.

Beta gamma is (E^2 - m^2 c^4 )/( m c^2 )

Wait, beta gamma = E/(m c^2 ) * sqrt(1 - (m c^2/E )^2 )

Alternatively, beta gamma = sqrt( (E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) ) / ( m c^2 )

So,

E=8 GeV,

m c^2=1.2 GeV.

So,

E² - (m c^2 )² = 64 -1.44 =62.56.

sqrt(62.56)=7.91.

So beta gamma=7.91 GeV / (1.2 GeV ) =7.91 /1.2 ≈6.5917.

So,

L = c * tau * beta gamma = (3e8 m/s) * (2.056875e-24 s) *6.5917.

Compute:

3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16.

Multiply by 6.5917: 6.170625e-16 *6.5917 ≈4.074e-15 m.

Wait, 6.17e-16 *6.59 is approximately 4.07e-15 m.

Hmm, that's 4.07e-15 meters. Looking at the options:

Option B is 4.0655e-15 m.

Option D is4.0655e-16 m.

So, 4.07e-15 is close to option B, which is 4.0655e-15 m.

But wait, earlier calculations gave me about 6.1e-16 m, but this approach gives 4.07e-15 m.

Wait, I must have made a mistake earlier. What's the discrepancy here?

Ah! Earlier, I used L = v * tau, which is beta c tau. But when I used the beta gamma approach, I used L = c * tau * beta gamma.

Wait, beta gamma is (beta c)(gamma) = (v)(gamma). Hmm, perhaps the formula is L = (beta gamma c) * tau.

Wait, tau is in seconds. So,

L = (beta gamma c) * tau.

So, beta gamma is 6.5917,

c =3e8 m/s,

tau= 2.056875e-24 s.

So,

L=6.5917 *3e8 *2.056875e-24.

Compute 6.5917 *3e8 =1.9775e9.

1.9775e9 *2.056875e-24 = (1.9775 *2.056875 )e-15.

1.9775 *2.056875 = approx 4.074.

So L≈4.074e-15 m → which is about 4.07e-15 m.

Which matches option B (4.0655e-15 m) and D (4.0655e-16 m) is much smaller. So option B is the closest.

Wait, but earlier when I did the first approach, I thought I had 6e-16 m, but that was incorrect because I forgot to include the gamma factor. So the correct approach is to use L= c * tau * beta gamma.

So the correct decay distance is approximately 4.07e-15 m, which is option B (4.0655e-15 m), considering rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more precisely.

Compute beta gamma =7.91 /1.2 =6.591666667.

Then,

L= c * tau * beta gamma.

c=3e8 m/s,

tau= 6.582e-25 /0.32 =2.056875e-24 s.

So,

L=3e8 *2.056875e-24 *6.591666667.

Compute:

3e8 *2.056875e-24 =6.170625e-16.

Multiply by6.591666667 →6.170625e-16 *6.591666667.

Compute 6.170625 *6.591666667.

Let me compute 6 *6.591666667= 39.55.

0.170625 *6.591666667 ≈1.122.

Total approx 40.672.

So 40.672e-16 m=4.0672e-15 m.

Which is very close to option B, 4.0655e-15 m.

So the correct answer should be option B.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for the decay length:

\[
L = c \cdot \tau \cdot \beta \gamma
\]

where:
- \( c \) is the speed of light (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( \tau \) is the lifetime of the particle,
- \( \beta \gamma \) is the relativistic factor.

### Step 1: Calculate the lifetime \( \tau \)
The lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given:
- \( \hbar = 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV} \cdot \text{s} \),
- \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \),

we find:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} = 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \beta \gamma \)
The relativistic factor \( \beta \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\beta \gamma = \frac{\sqrt{E^2 - m^2 c^4}}{m c^2}
\]

Given:
- \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( m c^2 = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \),

we compute:

\[
E^2 - (m c^2)^2 = 8^2 - 1.2^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56,
\]
\[
\sqrt{62.56} = 7.91 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\beta \gamma = \frac{7.91}{1.2} \approx 6.5917.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the decay length \( L \)
Using the formula \( L = c \cdot \tau \cdot \beta \gamma \), we substitute the values:

\[
L = (3 \times 10^8) \cdot (2.056875 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 6.5917.
\]

First, calculate \( 3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} \):

\[
3 \times 10^8 \cdot 2.056875 \times 10^{-24} = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16}.
\]

Next, multiply by \( 6.5917 \):

\[
L = 6.170625 \times 10^{-16} \cdot 6.5917 \approx 4.074 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
The calculated decay length \( L \approx 4.074 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is closest to option **B**, \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).

### Final Answer:
**Answer: B**
