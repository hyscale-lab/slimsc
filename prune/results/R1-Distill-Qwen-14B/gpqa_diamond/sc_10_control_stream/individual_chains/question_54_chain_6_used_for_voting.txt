Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about ring-closing metathesis, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. The question is asking which starting material would be needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene through this metathesis reaction. Hmm, ring-closing metathesis usually involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups to form a ring, right? So it's about breaking and reforming double bonds, swapping the ends.

The target molecule is a cyclohexene derivative. The structure given is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So I imagine a six-membered ring with substituents. The double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, I think. Wait, cyclohex-1-ene would mean the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, substituents are at positions 3,4 (methyl groups) and 5 (isopropyl group).

Ring-closing metathesis typically uses a diene as the starting material. The metathesis would bring the two ends of the diene together, forming a ring and a double bond in the process. So the diene should have two double bonds or just a conjugated diene? Wait, no, I think the starting material is an alkyldiene, maybe a diene with substituents that will end up in the ring.

Wait, no, ring-closing metathesis usually uses a diene where the two ends can come together. So the starting material is a diene, like a diene with substituents that, when the metathesis happens, form the cyclohexene ring.

So for the target, the cyclohexene has substituents at 3,4,5. Let me think about the positions. The ring has six carbons, so the substituents are on carbons 3,4,5. But in the ring, the positions are numbered such that the double bond is between 1 and 2. So the substituents are on carbons 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). So the ring is 1,2 double bond, substituents on 3,4,5.

The starting material is an octadiene. Because when it undergoes ring-closing metathesis, it forms a six-membered ring. So octa would have eight carbons, but after forming a six-membered ring (losing two carbons as ethylene), so the starting material has eight carbons and two double bonds.

Wait, no, in ring-closing metathesis, the diene (two double bonds) isn't always needed. Actually, it's a process where two alkenes (each part of a larger molecule) exchange ends. So perhaps the starting material is a diene with substituents at each end that will form the ring.

Wait, maybe I should think about the structure. The target molecule is cyclohexene with substituents in certain positions. So the starting material must be a diene where the ends can connect to form the six-membered ring.

Let me try drawing this out. The target is a cyclohexene ring with substituents at 3,4,5. The substituents are: 3 and 4 are methyl, 5 is isopropyl. So perhaps the starting material has these substituents on the ends of a diene.

Wait, the starting material would be a diene with substituents that, when the metathesis occurs, those substituents end up being in the correct positions in the ring.

So for ring-closing metathesis, the diene structure is such that when the metathesis happens, the two ends (the ends of the diene) connect to form the ring.

So the diene would have substituents on the end carbons that, upon ring formation, become the substituents on the cyclohexene.

In the target molecule, the substituent at position 5 is isopropyl. So in the starting material, perhaps the end of the diene has the isopropyl group. Similarly, the substituents at 3 and 4 being methyl would be in the middle of the diene.

Wait, but the diene is an octadiene, so eight carbons. Let's think. The target is a six-membered ring, so the starting material must have the substituents placed such that when the ends come together, the substituents are in the correct positions.

Alternatively, the starting material is a diene with substituents at positions that, when the ring forms, become the substituents in the target.

Let me think of the target: positions 3,4,5 have substituents. So in the starting material, which is a straight chain, these substituents would be on the appropriate carbons so that when the ring forms, they end up adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene where, when the two ends are connected via metathesis, the substituents are placed correctly.

So the target has a substituent at position 5 (isopropyl), and two methyl groups at 3 and 4. So in the starting material, perhaps the substituents are located on carbons 5 and something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has substituents at the ends. So for example, if the starting material is an octadiene with substituents at the ends, which upon metathesis form the ring.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. Let me imagine that.

Structure of starting material option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So the molecule is eight carbons long, with double bonds at 1 and 7, and substituents at 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). So positions 1 and 7 are the ends, each with a double bond.

So during ring-closing metathesis, the two double bonds (at 1 and 7) would react. The Grubbs catalyst, for example, would facilitate the [2+2] cycloaddition of the two alkenes, but wait, no, metathesis is more about breaking and reforming the double bonds. So perhaps the two ends (the alkenes) will undergo a metathesis that connects the ends, forming a ring.

Wait, in ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst will break the double bonds and form new ones. So, for example, in a diene, the catalyst will trigger the exchange of the ends, leading to the formation of a ring and the elimination of ethylene.

So for starting material A: octa-1,7-diene. The two double bonds are at the ends of a long chain. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, wait, the starting material is octa-1,7-diene, so it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, octa is 8 carbons, so positions 1 and 7 would be the first and seventh carbons. So:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
          CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2

Wait, no, perhaps that's not right. Wait, the molecule is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So the full structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Octa has eight carbons. So the structure is:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2?

No, wait, that's nine carbons. Oh, wait no. Maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me number from 1 to 8.

Wait, no, the compound is octa-1,7-diene. So the double bonds are between 1-2 and 7-8. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, but that would have two isolated double bonds at the ends. Hmm.

But the substituents are at positions 3,4,5. So this is 5-isopropyl, so the fifth carbon has an isopropyl group. Additionally, 3 and 4 have methyl groups.

So the structure would be:

1: CH2=
2: CH-
3: CH2
4: CH(CH3)
5: CH(CH3)
6: CH2
7: CH2
8: CH2

Wait, no, perhaps:

Wait, the molecule is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So the structure is:

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))... Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, perhaps it's better to structure it as:

The starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So the chain is eight carbons, with double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8. The substituents are at 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). So:

Carbon 1: CH2= (start of first double bond)
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)
Carbon 4: CH(CH3)
Carbon 5: CH(CH2CH(CH3)) ? No, wait, isopropyl is CH(CH3)2. So Carbon 5 has an isopropyl group attached.

So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, but that's more than eight carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting tangled here. Perhaps it's better to think about the positions in the ring.

When the ring-closing metathesis happens, the two ends (the two double bonds) will connect to form the ring. So, the two double bonds (1,2 and 7,8) in the starting material would become part of the new ring.

In the target, the cyclohexene has six members. To form a six-membered ring, the number of atoms between the two ends in the starting material should be four. Because 6-membered ring: the two ends are connected through four atoms, making the ring.

Wait, the starting material is an octadiene (8 carbons), and after forming a six-membered ring, it would lose two carbons as ethylene. Wait, no, ring-closing metathesis typically results in the loss of ethylene, so the number of carbons in the ring would be (n) = (starting carbons) - 2.

Wait, no, the starting material is a diene, which has two double bonds. So the molecule is an octadiene, which is eight carbons with two double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene where the two ends are the alkenes, and the middle has the substituents. When the metathesis occurs, the two ends (from the double bonds) will connect, forming the ring.

So in the target molecule, the substituents are at 3,4,5. So in the starting material, which is a straight chain, those substituents are on carbons that, when the ends are connected, end up at 3,4,5 in the ring.

So perhaps in the starting material, the substituents at 3,4,5 (from the ring) are placed in the middle of the chain. So when the ends (positions 1 and 8) come together, the substituents in the middle form the substituents in the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So when the metathesis occurs, the double bonds at 1,2 and 7,8 react. So the catalyst breaks the double bonds and connects the ends, forming a new double bond in the ring.

The resulting ring would have substituents at the positions that were in the middle. So the substituents at 3,4,5 would end up in the ring as 3,4,5.

Wait, the starting material is octa-1,7-diene, which is eight carbons, with double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8. So when the metathesis occurs, the ends (1 and 7) will connect, forming a six-membered ring. The double bonds will break, and new double bonds will form in the ring.

So after the reaction, the positions 1 and 7 would be connected, making a six-membered ring. The substituents are at 3,4,5 in the original chain. So in the ring, these would be at positions 3,4,5.

Wait, maybe. Let me imagine the chain:

Positions: 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8

Structure: CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2

Wait, but that would be octa-1,7-diene. Then, during metathesis, the two double bonds (1 and 7) would undergo exchange. The Grubbs catalyst would facilitate the breaking of both double bonds and form new ones in a way that connects the ends.

So the ring would form between positions 1 and 8 (or 7?), but in the starting material, position 7 is a double bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diene with the substituents in the correct positions so that when the ring forms, they become adjacent in the ring.

Looking at the options, option A is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So the substituents are at 3,4,5. So when the ends (1 and 7) are connected, the substituents at 3,4,5 would be on the ring in the correct positions.

Wait, but when you connect 1 and 7 in an eight-carbon chain, how many atoms are between them? Let's count. From 1 to 8 is 7 bonds, but in a ring, connecting 1 and 8 would create a seven-membered ring, which isn't what we want. Hmm, that can't be right because the target is a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene where the two double bonds are at positions 1,2 and 6,7, so that when they react, the ring formed is six-membered. Because when you connect positions 1 and 6, that's five atoms in between, making a six-membered ring (including the two ends).

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

So the double bonds are between 2-3 and 6-7. So the structure would be:

CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2... ?

Wait, no, octa-2,6-diene would have double bonds at positions 2-3 and 6-7. So the numbering is from 1 to 8.

If the starting material is octa-2,6-diene, then the double bonds are in the middle. So during metathesis, perhaps the catalyst would connect the ends, but I'm not sure how that would form a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the correct starting material is option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So the double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2?

Wait, octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds at positions 1-2 and 6-7. So when the ring-closing occurs, the ends (1 and 6) would connect. Let's count the carbons between 1 and 6: 1-2-3-4-5-6. So connecting 1 and 6 would form a six-membered ring. Because 1 to 6 is five carbons apart, so the ring would have six members (including the two ends).

So in this case, when the two double bonds (1-2 and 6-7) undergo metathesis, the ends would connect to form a ring. The substituents at positions 3,4,5 (from the chain) would end up in the ring at positions 3,4,5.

So the target molecule has substituents at 3,4,5. That matches. So the starting material is option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Wait, but let me double-check. The substituents in the starting material would be at positions 3,4,5. When the ring is formed by connecting 1 and 6, the positions in the ring would be 1 (from starting 1) connected to 6 (from starting 6). So the substituents at 3,4,5 are in the chain between 1 and 6. So in the ring, the substituents would be on the adjacent carbons.

Wait, so the starting material is:

1 (CH2=CH2-), then 2 (CH2), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH(CH3)), 5 (CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)), 6 (CH2-CH2=CH-CH2...? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct starting material is option B. Let me think again.

Option B is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene. So the double bonds are at 2-3 and 6-7.

So structure is:

CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2?

Wait, but when the metathesis occurs, the catalyst would break the double bonds and form new ones. So perhaps the two ends (positions 2 and 6) are connected.

Wait, if the starting material is octa-2,6-diene, then the double bonds are in the middle. So the catalyst would facilitate a metathesis that connects the ends, forming a ring.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe another approach would help.

The target molecule is a cyclohexene, so six-membered ring, with double bond at position 1. The substituents are at 3,4,5.

For ring-closing metathesis, the starting material must have substituents positioned such that upon ring formation, they end up at the correct positions.

Let me imagine starting with an octadiene. When the two ends undergo metathesis, the substituents in the middle become part of the ring.

So for the target, substituents at 3,4,5 would be in the middle of the chain. So the starting material must have substituents at positions that are three, four, and five carbons away from each end, perhaps.

Wait, if the starting material is octa-1,7-diene (option A), then the substituents at 3,4,5 are in the middle. When the ends (1 and 7) are connected, the substituents would end up in positions 3,4,5 of the ring.

Wait, but connecting 1 and 7 in an eight-carbon chain would create a six-membered ring? Let me count:

1 connected to 7: the chain from 1 to 7 is 6 carbons (positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) but wait, 1 to 7 is seven positions, which would make a seven-membered ring. That's not right because the target is six-membered.

Hmm, so option A would form a seven-membered ring, which isn't what we want. So option A is likely not the correct starting material.

Option C is octa-1,6-diene. So the chain is eight carbons, with double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7. So positions 1 and 6 would be the ends with double bonds.

When these ends undergo metathesis, they would form a six-membered ring because the distance from 1 to 6 is five carbons (positions 1,2,3,4,5,6), making a six-membered ring.

So in the starting material, the substituents at 3,4,5 would be in the middle. So when the ring forms, these substituents would be in the correct positions.

So the starting material would be option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Wait, but let me think of the actual structure. Starting material C is octa-1,6-diene. So positions 1-2 and 6-7 have double bonds.

So from 1 to 6, it's 5 carbons apart. So when the metathesis happens, the two double bonds break, and the ends (1 and 6) connect, forming a six-membered ring.

Therefore, the substituents at 3,4,5 in the chain would end up as substituents at positions 3,4,5 in the ring.

Thus, the correct starting material is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, we analyze the options based on the reaction mechanism. Ring-closing metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups to form a ring, typically requiring a diene with substituents positioned such that, upon reaction, they end up in the correct positions in the target molecule.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Target Molecule**: The target is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with a double bond at position 1 and substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). The starting material must be an octadiene with substituents positioned so that, after metathesis, they align correctly in the ring.

2. **Ring Formation**: For a six-membered ring, the starting material must have substituents positioned such that the distance between the reacting ends (the double bonds) is five carbons apart. This ensures that the ring formed is six-membered.

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene)**: This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8. Connecting these ends would form a seven-membered ring, not a six-membered ring. Thus, this option is incorrect.
   - **Option B (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene)**: This molecule has double bonds at positions 2-3 and 6-7. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 are not positioned correctly to align in the six-membered ring after metathesis. This option is also incorrect.
   - **Option C (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene)**: This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 6-7. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 are positioned correctly in the middle of the chain. When the double bonds undergo metathesis, the ends (positions 1 and 6) connect to form a six-membered ring, with the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 aligning correctly in the ring. This option is correct.
   - **Option D (4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene)**: This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8, but the substituents are incorrectly positioned, leading to a seven-membered ring. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**, as it has the appropriate substituents positioned to form the six-membered ring with the correct substituents in the target molecule.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about ring-closing metathesis, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to figure it out. The question is asking which starting material would be needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene through this metathesis reaction. Hmm, ring-closing metathesis usually involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups to form a ring, right? So it's about breaking and reforming double bonds, swapping the ends.

The target molecule is a cyclohexene derivative. The structure given is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So I imagine a six-membered ring with substituents. The double bond is between carbons 1 and 2, I think. Wait, cyclohex-1-ene would mean the double bond is between C1 and C2. Then, substituents are at positions 3,4 (methyl groups) and 5 (isopropyl group).

Ring-closing metathesis typically uses a diene as the starting material. The metathesis would bring the two ends of the diene together, forming a ring and a double bond in the process. So the diene should have two double bonds or just a conjugated diene? Wait, no, I think the starting material is an alkyldiene, maybe a diene with substituents that will end up in the ring.

Wait, no, ring-closing metathesis usually uses a diene where the two ends can come together. So the starting material is a diene, like a diene with substituents that, when the metathesis happens, form the cyclohexene ring.

So for the target, the cyclohexene has substituents at 3,4,5. Let me think about the positions. The ring has six carbons, so the substituents are on carbons 3,4,5. But in the ring, the positions are numbered such that the double bond is between 1 and 2. So the substituents are on carbons 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). So the ring is 1,2 double bond, substituents on 3,4,5.

The starting material is an octadiene. Because when it undergoes ring-closing metathesis, it forms a six-membered ring. So octa would have eight carbons, but after forming a six-membered ring (losing two carbons as ethylene), so the starting material has eight carbons and two double bonds.

Wait, no, in ring-closing metathesis, the diene (two double bonds) isn't always needed. Actually, it's a process where two alkenes (each part of a larger molecule) exchange ends. So perhaps the starting material is a diene with substituents at each end that will form the ring.

Let me try drawing this out. The target is a cyclohexene ring with substituents at 3,4,5. The substituents are: 3 and 4 are methyl, 5 is isopropyl. So perhaps the starting material has these substituents on the ends of a diene.

So for ring-closing metathesis, the diene structure is such that when the metathesis happens, the two ends (the ends of the diene) connect to form the ring.

So the diene would have substituents on the end carbons that, upon ring formation, become the substituents on the cyclohexene.

In the target molecule, the substituent at position 5 is isopropyl. So in the starting material, perhaps the end of the diene has the isopropyl group. Similarly, the substituents at 3 and 4 being methyl would be in the middle of the diene.

Wait, but the diene is an octadiene, so eight carbons. Let's think. The target is a six-membered ring, so the starting material must have the substituents placed such that when the ends come together, the substituents are in the correct positions.

Alternatively, the starting material is a diene with substituents at positions that, when the ring forms, become the substituents in the target.

Let me think of the target: positions 3,4,5 have substituents. So in the starting material, which is a straight chain, these substituents would be on the appropriate carbons so that when the ring forms, they end up adjacent.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene where, when the two ends are connected via metathesis, the substituents are placed correctly.

So the target has a substituent at position 5 (isopropyl), and two methyl groups at 3 and 4. So in the starting material, perhaps the substituents are located on carbons 5 and something else.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has substituents at the ends. So for example, if the starting material is an octadiene with substituents at the ends, which upon metathesis form the ring.

Wait, maybe the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. Let me imagine that.

Structure of starting material option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So the molecule is eight carbons long, with double bonds at 1 and 7, and substituents at 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). So positions 1 and 7 are the ends, each with a double bond.

So during ring-closing metathesis, the two double bonds (at 1 and 7) would react. The Grubbs catalyst, for example, would facilitate the [2+2] cycloaddition of the two alkenes, but wait, no, metathesis is more about breaking and reforming the double bonds. So perhaps the two ends (the alkenes) will undergo a metathesis that connects the ends, forming a ring.

Wait, in ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst will break the double bonds and form new ones. So, for example, in a diene, the catalyst will trigger the exchange of the ends, leading to the formation of a ring and the elimination of ethylene.

So for starting material A: octa-1,7-diene. The two double bonds are at the ends of a long chain. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, wait, the starting material is octa-1,7-diene, so it's CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, octa is 8 carbons, so positions 1 and 7 would be the first and seventh carbons. So:

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
          CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2

Wait, no, perhaps that's not right. Wait, the molecule is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So the full structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2?

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Octa has eight carbons. So the structure is:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2?

No, wait, that's nine carbons. Oh, wait no. Maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me number from 1 to 8.

Wait, no, the compound is octa-1,7-diene. So the double bonds are between 1-2 and 7-8. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, but that would have two isolated double bonds at the ends. Hmm.

But the substituents are at positions 3,4,5. So this is 5-isopropyl, so the fifth carbon has an isopropyl group. Additionally, 3 and 4 have methyl groups.

So the structure would be:

1: CH2=
2: CH-
3: CH2
4: CH(CH3)
5: CH(CH3)
6: CH2
7: CH2
8: CH2

Wait, no, perhaps:

Wait, the molecule is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So the structure is:

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))... Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, perhaps it's better to structure it as:

The starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So the chain is eight carbons, with double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8. The substituents are at 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). So:

Carbon 1: CH2= (start of first double bond)
Carbon 2: CH-
Carbon 3: CH(CH3)
Carbon 4: CH(CH3)
Carbon 5: CH(CH2CH(CH3)) ? No, wait, isopropyl is CH(CH3)2. So Carbon 5 has an isopropyl group attached.

So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH(CH3)2)-CH2-CH2-CH2? Wait, but that's more than eight carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting tangled here. Perhaps it's better to think about the positions in the ring.

When the ring-closing metathesis happens, the two ends (the two double bonds) will connect to form the ring. So, the two double bonds (1,2 and 7,8) in the starting material would become part of the new ring.

In the target, the cyclohexene has six members. To form a six-membered ring, the number of atoms between the two ends in the starting material should be four. Because 6-membered ring: the two ends are connected through four atoms, making the ring.

Wait, the starting material is an octadiene (8 carbons), and after forming a six-membered ring, it would lose two carbons as ethylene. Wait, no, ring-closing metathesis typically results in the loss of ethylene, so the number of carbons in the ring would be (n) = (starting carbons) - 2.

Wait, no, the starting material is a diene, which has two double bonds. So the molecule is an octadiene, which is eight carbons with two double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene where the two ends are the alkenes, and the middle has the substituents. When the metathesis occurs, the two ends (from the double bonds) will connect, forming the ring.

So in the target molecule, the substituents are at 3,4,5. So in the starting material, which is a straight chain, those substituents are on carbons that, when the ends are connected, end up at 3,4,5 in the ring.

So perhaps in the starting material, the substituents at 3,4,5 (from the ring) are placed in the middle of the chain. So when the ends (positions 1 and 8) come together, the substituents in the middle form the substituents in the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So when the metathesis occurs, the double bonds at 1,2 and 7,8 react. So the catalyst breaks the double bonds and connects the ends, forming a new double bond in the ring.

The resulting ring would have substituents at the positions that were in the middle. So the substituents at 3,4,5 would end up in the ring as 3,4,5.

Wait, the starting material is octa-1,7-diene, which is eight carbons, with double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8. So when the metathesis occurs, the ends (1 and 7) will connect, forming a six-membered ring. The double bonds will break, and new double bonds will form in the ring.

So after the reaction, the positions 1 and 7 would be connected, making a six-membered ring. The substituents are at 3,4,5 in the original chain. So in the ring, these would be at positions 3,4,5.

Wait, maybe. Let me imagine the chain:

Positions: 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8

Structure: CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2

Wait, but that would be octa-1,7-diene. Then, during metathesis, the two double bonds (1 and 7) would undergo exchange. The Grubbs catalyst would facilitate the breaking of both double bonds and form new ones in a way that connects the ends.

So the ring would form between positions 1 and 8 (or 7?), but in the starting material, position 7 is a double bond. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a diene with the substituents in the correct positions so that when the ring forms, they become adjacent in the ring.

Looking at the options, option A is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. So the substituents are at 3,4,5. So when the ends (1 and 7) are connected, the substituents at 3,4,5 would be on the ring in the correct positions.

Wait, but when you connect 1 and 7 in an eight-carbon chain, how many atoms are between them? Let's count. From 1 to 8 is 7 bonds, but in a ring, connecting 1 and 8 would create a seven-membered ring, which isn't what we want. Hmm, that can't be right because the target is a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene where the two double bonds are at positions 1,2 and 6,7, so that when they react, the ring formed is six-membered. Because when you connect positions 1 and 6, that's five atoms in between, making a six-membered ring (including the two ends).

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option B is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene.

So the double bonds are between 2-3 and 6-7. So the structure would be:

CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2... ?

Wait, no, octa-2,6-diene would have double bonds at positions 2-3 and 6-7. So the numbering is from 1 to 8.

If the starting material is octa-2,6-diene, then the double bonds are in the middle. So during metathesis, perhaps the catalyst would connect the ends, but I'm not sure how that would form a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the correct starting material is option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So the double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7. So the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2?

Wait, octa-1,6-diene would have double bonds at positions 1-2 and 6-7. So when the ring-closing occurs, the ends (1 and 6) would connect. Let's count the carbons between 1 and 6: 1-2-3-4-5-6. So connecting 1 and 6 would form a six-membered ring. Because 1 to 6 is five carbons apart, so the ring would have six members (including the two ends).

So in this case, when the two double bonds (1-2 and 6-7) undergo metathesis, the ends would connect to form a ring. The substituents at positions 3,4,5 (from the chain) would end up in the ring at positions 3,4,5.

So the target molecule has substituents at 3,4,5. That matches. So the starting material is option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Wait, but let me double-check. The substituents in the starting material would be at positions 3,4,5. When the ring is formed by connecting 1 and 6, the positions in the ring would be 1 (from starting 1) connected to 6 (from starting 6). So the substituents at 3,4,5 are in the chain between 1 and 6. So in the ring, the substituents would be on the adjacent carbons.

Wait, so the starting material is:

1 (CH2=CH2-), then 2 (CH2), 3 (CH(CH3)), 4 (CH(CH3)), 5 (CH(CH2CH(CH3)2)), 6 (CH2-CH2=CH-CH2...? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct starting material is option B. Let me think again.

Option B is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene. So the double bonds are at 2-3 and 6-7.

So structure is:

CH2-CH2=CH-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2=CH-CH2?

Wait, but when the metathesis occurs, the catalyst would break the double bonds and form new ones. So perhaps the two ends (positions 2 and 6) are connected.

Wait, if the starting material is octa-2,6-diene, then the double bonds are in the middle. So the catalyst would facilitate a metathesis that connects the ends, forming a ring.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe another approach would help.

The target molecule is a cyclohexene, so six-membered ring, with double bond at position 1. The substituents are at 3,4,5.

For ring-closing metathesis, the starting material must have substituents positioned such that upon ring formation, they end up at the correct positions.

Let me imagine starting with an octadiene. When the two ends undergo metathesis, the substituents in the middle become part of the ring.

So for the target, substituents at 3,4,5 would be in the middle of the chain. So the starting material must have substituents at positions that are three, four, and five carbons away from each end, perhaps.

Wait, if the starting material is octa-1,7-diene (option A), then the substituents at 3,4,5 are in the middle. When the ends (1 and 7) are connected, the substituents would end up in positions 3,4,5 of the ring.

Wait, but connecting 1 and 7 in an eight-carbon chain would create a six-membered ring? Let me count:

1 connected to 7: the chain from 1 to 7 is 6 carbons (positions 1,2,3,4,5,6,7) but wait, 1 to 7 is seven positions, which would make a seven-membered ring. That's not right because the target is six-membered.

Hmm, so option A would form a seven-membered ring, which isn't what we want. So option A is likely not the correct starting material.

Option C is octa-1,6-diene. So the chain is eight carbons, with double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7. So positions 1 and 6 would be the ends with double bonds.

When these ends undergo metathesis, they would form a six-membered ring because the distance from 1 to 6 is five carbons (positions 1,2,3,4,5,6), making a six-membered ring.

So in the starting material, the substituents at 3,4,5 would be in the middle. So when the ring forms, these substituents would be in the correct positions.

So the starting material would be option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

Wait, but let me think of the actual structure. Starting material C is octa-1,6-diene. So positions 1-2 and 6-7 have double bonds.

So from 1 to 6, it's 5 carbons apart. So when the metathesis happens, the two double bonds break, and the ends (1 and 6) connect, forming a six-membered ring.

Therefore, the substituents at 3,4,5 in the chain would end up as substituents at positions 3,4,5 in the ring.

Thus, the correct starting material is option C.


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, we analyze the options based on the reaction mechanism. Ring-closing metathesis involves the redistribution of alkylidene groups to form a ring, typically requiring a diene with substituents positioned such that, upon reaction, they end up in the correct positions in the target molecule.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Target Molecule**: The target is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with a double bond at position 1 and substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). The starting material must be an octadiene with substituents positioned so that, after metathesis, they align correctly in the ring.

2. **Ring Formation**: For a six-membered ring, the starting material must have substituents positioned such that the distance between the reacting ends (the double bonds) is five carbons apart. This ensures that the ring formed is six-membered.

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene)**: This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8. Connecting these ends would form a seven-membered ring, not a six-membered ring. Thus, this option is incorrect.
   - **Option B (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene)**: This molecule has double bonds at positions 2-3 and 6-7. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 are not positioned correctly to align in the six-membered ring after metathesis. This option is also incorrect.
   - **Option C (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene)**: This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 6-7. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 are positioned correctly in the middle of the chain. When the double bonds undergo metathesis, the ends (positions 1 and 6) connect to form a six-membered ring, with the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 aligning correctly in the ring. This option is correct.
   - **Option D (4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene)**: This molecule has double bonds at positions 1-2 and 7-8, but the substituents are incorrectly positioned, leading to a seven-membered ring. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**, as it has the appropriate substituents positioned to form the six-membered ring with the correct substituents in the target molecule.
