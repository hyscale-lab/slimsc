Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question goes through a series of reactions starting with benzene. Each step involves a different reagent, and I need to figure out what the final product looks like. The options are A, B, C, D, all of which are 1,1'-biphenyl derivatives with some substituents. Hmm.

Let me break down each step one by one.

Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1. I remember that nitrating benzene requires a nitrating mixture, which is HNO3 and H2SO4. So benzene undergoes nitration here. Nitration adds a nitro group. Where does it attach? Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution. Since benzene is symmetric, the nitro group can add in any position. Wait, but in nitration, the nitro group is a meta-directing group. Oh wait, wait. No, wait, in this step, benzene is the starting material, so the first substitution is in the nitration. So product 1 is nitrobenzene. But wait, wait, when benzene undergoes nitration, the nitro group can only enter in certain positions. Oh wait, no, benzene is symmetric, so the nitro group can be in any position, but the product is a single isomer? No, actually, nitrobenzene is just a single product because all positions are equivalent? No, wait, benzene is a regular hexagon, so when you nitrate it, the nitro group can be in any position, but you get a single product because the molecule is symmetrical. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Wait, but wait, no. Nitrobenzene is a monosubstituted benzene with a nitro group attached. So product 1 is nitrobenzene. Okay, moving on.

Step 2: Product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder, forming product 2. Br2 with Fe is a brominating agent. But wait, when you have a nitro group on benzene, which is a meta director. So bromine should add in the meta position relative to nitro. So nitrobenzene plus Fe and Br2. Nitro group is meta-directing, so the bromine will add in the meta position. So product 2 would have bromine in the meta position relative to nitro. So nitro group in position 1, bromine in position 3? Or maybe position 4? Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering might matter here.

Wait, let me think. The nitro group is at position 1. Then, the bromine can enter at position 3 or position 5, but since benzene is symmetric, they are equivalent. So product 2 would be 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene. Wait, wait, no; nitrobenzene is when benzene has a nitro group in position 1. When you brominate, the bromine goes into the meta position, which would be position 3, 5, etc., but considering the ring, it's actually position 3 and 5 are equivalent. So product 2 would be 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene.

But wait, wait, another thought: maybe I should think of the nitro group as the substituent, and the bromine adds in the meta position relative to it. So if nitro is at position 1, then bromine is added at position 3. So the structure is nitro in position 1, bromine in position 3. So product 2 is 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused with the numbering. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let's say nitro is at position 1, then the bromine would be at position 3. So the structure is 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene.

Wait, but sometimes when we have multiple substituents, the numbering is done to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So perhaps in product 2, the nitro group is at position 1, bromine at position 3. So that's correct.

Step 3: Product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen, forming product 3. Pd/C and H2 is hydrogenation. So, the nitro group in product 2 would be reduced. Nitro groups (NO2) upon hydrogenation typically reduce to NH2. So the nitro group becomes an amino group. So product 3 would be 1-amino-3-bromobenzene. Or, if I number differently, maybe the amino group is at position 1 and bromine at position 3. So that's product 3.

Step 4: Product 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, forming product 4. Hmm, sodium nitrite and HBF4. Wait, I think this is a diazotization reaction. The amino group is at position 1. Under cold (0-5Â°C) conditions, the amine is converted to a diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are usually formed under such conditions. So here, the amino group (NH2) in product 3 is converted to a diazonium chloride (Ar-N+Cl^-). But wait, HBF4 is a source of H+ and BF4^- as a weak base. So in this case, the amine (which is a primary amine) would react with NaNO2 to form a diazonium salt. So product 4 is the diazonium salt: 1-bromo-3-diazonium benzene? Or is the bromine in position 3 and the diazonium group in position 1?

Wait, product 3 is 1-amino-3-bromobenzene. So when treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, the amino group is converted to a diazonium group. So product 4 is 1-bromo-3-diazonium benzene. So the structure would be benzene with a Br in position 3 and a diazonium group (-N2+) in position 1.

Step 5: Product 4 is heated and then treated with anisole. Heating a diazonium salt typically leads to either coupling or decomposition. When a diazonium salt is treated with an aromatic compound like anisole (methoxybenzene), under certain conditions, it can undergo a coupling reaction. Alternatively, if the diazonium salt is heated in the presence of another aromatic ring, it can undergo a coupling (like the Friedlander coupling) or a substitution.

Wait, but another option is the formation of a biphenyl structure. Diazonium salts can undergo coupling reactions. If product 4 is the diazonium salt, and when heated with anisole, perhaps the benzene ring of anisole is undergoing some reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is involved in a substitution.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Product 4 is 1-diazonium-3-bromobenzene. When heated, the diazonium group can decompose. Diazonium salts, when heated, typically decompose to form a benzene ring with a substituent. For example, a diazonium group can lose N2, and the ring might undergo a substitution. But when in the presence of another aromatic ring, maybe it's a coupling reaction.

Wait, when a diazonium salt is treated with a phenol or anisole (which is an ortho/para director), the coupling occurs. The diazonium group can couple with the anisole ring. So, the anisole would act as a nucleophile and attack the benzene ring where the diazonium group is attached. So, the coupling would lead to the formation of a biphenyl structure.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: The coupling of a diazonium salt with another aromatic ring typically involves the diazonium group acting as an electrophilic group, and the other ring (like anisole, which is activated) providing the electron density to attack, leading to a new aromatic ring connected via a single bond.

So, in this case, product 4 is the diazonium salt, with the diazo group in position 1 and Br in position 3. When this reacts with anisole, which is an electron-rich ring (due to the methoxy group, which is a strong activating group), the coupling occurs.

The coupling would connect the benzene ring of the diazonium salt (now acting as the electrophilic part) to the anisole ring. So, the coupling would form a biphenyl structure: the original benzene ring (with Br) connected to the anisole ring. The point of connection would be where the diazonium group was (position 1 of the first benzene) and the position on the anisole ring where the coupling occurs.

Wait, but where does the coupling occur on the anisole ring? Anisole has a methoxy group, which directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. So, when the diazonium salt couples with anisole, the benzene ring of anisole (which is activated by the OMe group) will have the incoming group (from the diazonium) attach to either the ortho or para positions relative to the OMe group.

Wait, but since the coupling partners are the diazonium salt and the anisole, the benzene ring from the diazonium salt will attach to the anisole's ring at a position ortho or para to the OMe. So, the anisole has the OMe group in position 1 (if we imagine it as such), so the coupling would occur at positions 2 or 4.

Wait, but in the end, the final product is a biphenyl. So, product 5 is a biphenyl where one ring has a Br in position 3, and the other ring (the anisole-derived ring) has a methoxy group. Let me try to imagine this.

The original benzene (product 4) has the diazonium group in position 1 and Br in position 3. When this couples with anisole, the benzene ring from product 4 will connect to the anisole ring. The point of connection on the anisole ring would be where the incoming group (from the diazonium) attaches. Since the OMe group is a strong activating group, it directs incoming groups to ortho and para positions. So, the coupling would occur at either ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) relative to OMe.

Wait, but the coupling typically occurs in such a way that the two rings are connected. Let me think about the structure. The anisole is methoxybenzene, so it's a benzene ring with OMe in position 1. When it undergoes coupling with the diazonium salt, the ring from the diazonium (let's say, ring A) connects to the anisole ring (ring B) at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para) of ring B, relative to OMe.

So, the final product would be a biphenyl with ring A connected to ring B at position 1 of ring B (the OMe is at position 1, so the coupling occurs at position 2 or 4 on ring B). Wait, no, that's not correct. The OMe is at position 1 on ring B, so when the coupling occurs, it can be at position 2 (ortho) or position 4 (para). So, the position where ring A connects to ring B is either position 2 or 4 on ring B.

Now, ring A (from product 4) has a Br in position 3 and the connection point (where the diazonium was) in position 1. So, ring A is connected to ring B at position 1 of ring A (since that's where the diazonium was). So, the biphenyl would have ring A connected to ring B at position 1 of both rings.

Wait, no. Biphenyl is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. So, each ring has a point of attachment. So ring A's position 1 is connected to ring B's position (either 2 or 4, relative to OMe). So, the OMe is at position 1 on ring B, and the connection is at position 2 or 4 on ring B. So, when the biphenyl forms, ring B (anisole) has OMe at position 1, and the connection to ring A is at position 2 or 4.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally. Let's say ring B is the anisole ring with OMe at position 1. When the coupling occurs, the incoming group from the diazonium (from ring A) attaches to position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para) on ring B. So, the biphenyl will have ring A attached to ring B at position 2 or 4 of ring B.

So, the biphenyl structure would be such that ring B has OMe at position 1 and the connection to ring A at position 2 or 4. Then, ring A (from product 4) has a Br at position 3 (relative to the connection point, which is position 1 of ring A). So, when we look at ring A, the Br is in position 3, and the connection is position 1.

Wait, but in the biphenyl structure, the numbering is such that each ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So, the main substituents are the Br on one ring and the OMe on the other.

Let me try to figure out the numbering. Let's consider the biphenyl as 1,1'-biphenyl. So, the point of connection is position 1 on both rings. But wait, in our case, the connection is not necessarily at position 1 on both rings. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl is formed such that the diazonium ring (ring A) connects to the anisole ring (ring B) at their respective positions. So, ring A has substituents at positions 1 (where it's connected to ring B) and 3 (Br). Ring B has substituents at position 1 (OMe) and position 2 or 4 (the connection point to ring A).

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the final structure. The final product is a biphenyl with substituents. Let me look at the options:

Option C is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. So, the biphenyl is connected at position 1 of each ring. The left ring (ring 1) has Br at position 3, and the right ring (ring 1') has OMe at position 4'.

Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think about the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the positioning is such that ring A (from product 4) has Br at position 3 relative to the point of connection (position 1), and ring B (anisole) has OMe at position 4 relative to the connection point.

Wait, but the OMe is in position 1 on ring B, and the connection is at position 4 on ring B. So, the OMe and the connection are at positions 1 and 4 on ring B, meaning that the OMe is at position 4' relative to the connection point (since ring B is the second ring, so it's the 1', 2', etc.). Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of each substituent's position on the biphenyl.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about what each step does in terms of functional groups and directing effects.

Wait, let me recap all steps:

1. Benzene â nitrobenzene (product 1)
2. Nitrobenzene â brominate in meta â 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene (product 2)
3. Reduce nitro to amine â 1-amino-3-bromobenzene (product 3)
4. Diazotize amine â 1-diazonium-3-bromobenzene (product 4)
5. Heat with anisole â coupling to form biphenyl

So, the coupling would link the diazonium ring (ring A) to the anisole ring (ring B). The OMe is in position 1 on ring B. The coupling occurs at position 2 or 4 on ring B (ortho or para to OMe). So, the connection point on ring B is 2 or 4.

So, ring A is connected at position 1 of itself (since that's where the diazonium group was) to position 2 or 4 on ring B.

Now, in the biphenyl, the substituents on each ring are:

- Ring A: Br at position 3 (relative to connection at position 1)
- Ring B: OMe at position 1 (relative to connection point at position 2 or 4)

So, the positions on each ring are as follows.

Assuming the connection is at position 2 on ring B (anisole):

- Ring A: positions 1 (connected to ring B at position 2), and Br at position 3 (so on ring A, Br is at position 3)
- Ring B: position 1 (OMe), position 2 (connected to ring A), and what's the position of OMe relative to the connection point?

Wait, if ring B has OMe at position 1, and the connection is at position 2, then OMe is one position away from the connection. So on the biphenyl, ring B's substituents are OMe at position 1 and the connection at position 2.

Wait, but in terms of the biphenyl nomenclature, ring B would be the attached ring, so their positions are numbered as 1', 2', etc. So, if ring B (anisole) is connected at position 2, then OMe is at position 1, which is adjacent (ortho) to the connection (position 2). So, the OMe is at position 1 on ring B, which is position 2' on the biphenyl. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the final structure.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.

So, the biphenyl is connected at position 1 on each ring. The left ring has a Br at position 3, and the right ring (1') has a OMe at position 4'. So, the OMe is at position 4 on ring 1', which is in the para position relative to the connection point.

So, when the coupling occurs, the OMe is at position 4' (since the connection is at 1'), which would be the para position on ring B (anisole). So, the coupling would have occurred at the para position on anisole relative to OMe.

Wait, but anisole's OMe is at position 1. So, the para position would be position 4 on the same ring. So, the connection would be at position 4 on ring B. Thus, the biphenyl would have ring A connected to ring B at position 4 on ring B. So, ring B's substituents are OMe at position 1 and connection at position 4.

Wait, but the biphenyl is numbered such that the main substituents get the lowest numbers. So, in option C, the substituents are Br at 3 and OMe at 4', which are on opposite rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the OMe is on the same ring as the connection. Let me try to imagine the structure.

In the end, the biphenyl would have Br on ring 1 at position 3 and OMe on ring 1' at position 4. So, the structure is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl, which is option C.

So, putting it all together:

- Step 1: Nitration â nitrobenzene
- Step 2: Bromination in meta â 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene
- Step 3: Reduction â 1-amino-3-bromobenzene
- Step 4: Diazotization â 1-diazonium-3-bromobenzene
- Step 5: Coupling with anisole â OMe is at position 4' and Br at position 3 on the biphenyl.

So, the correct answer is option C: 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with benzene and proceeding through several transformations to yield a final biphenyl product. Here's the analysis of each step:

1. **Nitration with HNOâ and HâSOâ**: Benzene undergoes nitration to form nitrobenzene (product 1). The nitro group (-NOâ) is introduced as the first substituent.

2. **Bromination with Brâ and Fe**: Nitrobenzene is treated with bromine in the presence of Fe, which introduces a bromine atom. The nitro group is a meta-directing group, so bromination occurs at the meta position relative to the nitro group, forming 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene (product 2).

3. **Reduction with Pd/C and Hâ**: The nitro group in 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene is reduced to an amino group (-NHâ), yielding 1-amino-3-bromobenzene (product 3).

4. **Diazotization with NaNOâ and HBFâ**: The amino group in 1-amino-3-bromobenzene is converted into a diazonium group (-Nââº), forming 1-diazonium-3-bromobenzene (product 4).

5. **Coupling with Anisole**: The diazonium salt reacts with anisole (methoxybenzene) under heating. The diazonium group couples with the aromatic ring of anisole, forming a biphenyl structure. The methoxy group (-OMe) on anisole is an ortho/para-directing group, and the coupling occurs at the para position relative to the methoxy group. This results in a biphenyl where the original benzene ring (from product 4) has a bromine atom at position 3, and the anisole-derived ring has a methoxy group at position 4'.

The final product is **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**, which corresponds to option C.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reactions. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question goes through a series of reactions starting with benzene. Each step involves a different reagent, and I need to figure out what the final product looks like. The options are A, B, C, D, all of which are 1,1'-biphenyl derivatives with some substituents. Hmm.

Let me break down each step one by one.

Step 1: Benzene is treated with HNO3 and H2SO4, forming product 1. I remember that nitrating benzene requires a nitrating mixture, which is HNO3 and H2SO4. So benzene undergoes nitration here. Nitration adds a nitro group. Where does it attach? Benzene undergoes electrophilic substitution. Since benzene is symmetric, the nitro group can add in any position. Wait, but in nitration, the nitro group is a meta-directing group. Oh wait, wait. No, wait, in this step, benzene is the starting material, so the first substitution is in the nitration. So product 1 is nitrobenzene. But wait, wait, when benzene undergoes nitration, the nitro group can only enter in certain positions. Oh wait, no, benzene is symmetric, so the nitro group can be in any position, but the product is a single isomer? No, actually, nitrobenzene is just a single product because all positions are equivalent? No, wait, benzene is a regular hexagon, so when you nitrate it, the nitro group can be in any position, but you get a single product because the molecule is symmetrical. So product 1 is nitrobenzene.

Wait, but wait, no. Nitrobenzene is a monosubstituted benzene with a nitro group attached. So product 1 is nitrobenzene. Okay, moving on.

Step 2: Product 1 is treated with Br2 and iron powder, forming product 2. Br2 with Fe is a brominating agent. But wait, when you have a nitro group on benzene, which is a meta director. So bromine should add in the meta position relative to nitro. So nitrobenzene plus Fe and Br2. Nitro group is meta-directing, so the bromine will add in the meta position. So product 2 would have bromine in the meta position relative to nitro. So nitro group in position 1, bromine in position 3? Or maybe position 4? Wait, benzene is a ring, so numbering might matter here.

Wait, let me think. The nitro group is at position 1. Then, the bromine can enter at position 3 or position 5, but since benzene is symmetric, they are equivalent. So product 2 would be 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene. Wait, wait, no; nitrobenzene is when benzene has a nitro group in position 1. When you brominate, the bromine goes into the meta position, which would be position 3, 5, etc., but considering the ring, it's actually position 3 and 5 are equivalent. So product 2 would be 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene.

But wait, wait, another thought: maybe I should think of the nitro group as the substituent, and the bromine adds in the meta position relative to it. So if nitro is at position 1, then bromine is added at position 3. So the structure is nitro in position 1, bromine in position 3. So product 2 is 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused with the numbering. Let me imagine the benzene ring. Let's say nitro is at position 1, then the bromine would be at position 3. So the structure is 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene.

Wait, but sometimes when we have multiple substituents, the numbering is done to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So perhaps in product 2, the nitro group is at position 1, bromine at position 3. So that's correct.

Step 3: Product 2 is stirred with Pd/C under hydrogen, forming product 3. Pd/C and H2 is hydrogenation. So, the nitro group in product 2 would be reduced. Nitro groups (NO2) upon hydrogenation typically reduce to NH2. So the nitro group becomes an amino group. So product 3 would be 1-amino-3-bromobenzene. Or, if I number differently, maybe the amino group is at position 1 and bromine at position 3. So that's product 3.

Step 4: Product 3 is treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, forming product 4. Hmm, sodium nitrite and HBF4. Wait, I think this is a diazotization reaction. The amino group is at position 1. Under cold (0-5Â°C) conditions, the amine is converted to a diazonium salt. Diazonium salts are usually formed under such conditions. So here, the amino group (NH2) in product 3 is converted to a diazonium chloride (Ar-N+Cl^-). But wait, HBF4 is a source of H+ and BF4^- as a weak base. So in this case, the amine (which is a primary amine) would react with NaNO2 to form a diazonium salt. So product 4 is the diazonium salt: 1-bromo-3-diazonium benzene? Or is the bromine in position 3 and the diazonium group in position 1?

Wait, product 3 is 1-amino-3-bromobenzene. So when treated with NaNO2 and HBF4, the amino group is converted to a diazonium group. So product 4 is 1-bromo-3-diazonium benzene. So the structure would be benzene with a Br in position 3 and a diazonium group (-N2+) in position 1.

Step 5: Product 4 is heated and then treated with anisole. Heating a diazonium salt typically leads to either coupling or decomposition. When a diazonium salt is treated with an aromatic compound like anisole (methoxybenzene), under certain conditions, it can undergo a coupling reaction. Alternatively, if the diazonium salt is heated in the presence of another aromatic ring, it can undergo a coupling (like the Friedlander coupling) or a substitution.

Wait, but another option is the formation of a biphenyl structure. Diazonium salts can undergo coupling reactions. If product 4 is the diazonium salt, and when heated with anisole, perhaps the benzene ring of anisole is undergoing some reaction. Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is involved in a substitution.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Product 4 is 1-diazonium-3-bromobenzene. When heated, the diazonium group can decompose. Diazonium salts, when heated, typically decompose to form a benzene ring with a substituent. For example, a diazonium group can lose N2, and the ring might undergo a substitution. But when in the presence of another aromatic ring, maybe it's a coupling reaction.

Wait, when a diazonium salt is treated with a phenol or anisole (which is an ortho/para director), the coupling occurs. The diazonium group can couple with the anisole ring. So, the anisole would act as a nucleophile and attack the benzene ring where the diazonium group is attached. So, the coupling would lead to the formation of a biphenyl structure.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: The coupling of a diazonium salt with another aromatic ring typically involves the diazonium group acting as an electrophilic group, and the other ring (like anisole, which is activated) providing the electron density to attack, leading to a new aromatic ring connected via a single bond.

So, in this case, product 4 is the diazonium salt, with the diazo group in position 1 and Br in position 3. When this reacts with anisole, which is an electron-rich ring (due to the methoxy group, which is a strong activating group), the coupling occurs.

The coupling would connect the benzene ring of the diazonium salt (now acting as the electrophilic part) to the anisole ring. So, the coupling would form a biphenyl structure: the original benzene ring (with Br) connected to the anisole ring. The point of connection would be where the diazonium group was (position 1 of the first benzene) and the position on the anisole ring where the coupling occurs.

Wait, but where does the coupling occur on the anisole ring? Anisole has a methoxy group, which directs incoming electrophiles to ortho and para positions. So, when the diazonium salt couples with anisole, the benzene ring of anisole (which is activated by the OMe group) will have the incoming group (from the diazonium) attach to either the ortho or para positions relative to the OMe group.

Wait, but since the coupling partners are the diazonium salt and the anisole, the benzene ring from the diazonium salt will attach to the anisole's ring at a position ortho or para to the OMe. So, the anisole has the OMe group in position 1 (if we imagine it as such), so the coupling would occur at positions 2 or 4.

Wait, but in the end, the final product is a biphenyl. So, product 5 is a biphenyl where one ring has a Br in position 3, and the other ring (the anisole-derived ring) has a methoxy group. Let me try to imagine this.

The original benzene (product 4) has the diazonium group in position 1 and Br in position 3. When this couples with anisole, the benzene ring from product 4 will connect to the anisole ring. The point of connection on the anisole ring would be where the incoming group (from the diazonium) attaches. Since the OMe group is a strong activating group, it directs incoming groups to ortho and para positions. So, the coupling would occur at either ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) relative to OMe.

Wait, but the coupling typically occurs in such a way that the two rings are connected. Let me think about the structure. The anisole is methoxybenzene, so it's a benzene ring with OMe in position 1. When it undergoes coupling with the diazonium salt, the ring from the diazonium (let's say, ring A) connects to the anisole ring (ring B) at position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para) of ring B, relative to OMe.

So, the final product would be a biphenyl with ring A connected to ring B at position 1 of ring B (the OMe is at position 1, so the coupling occurs at position 2 or 4 on ring B). Wait, no, that's not correct. The OMe is at position 1 on ring B, so when the coupling occurs, it can be at position 2 (ortho) or position 4 (para). So, the position where ring A connects to ring B is either position 2 or 4 on ring B.

Now, ring A (from product 4) has a Br in position 3 and the connection point (where the diazonium was) in position 1. So, ring A is connected to ring B at position 1 of ring A (since that's where the diazonium was). So, the biphenyl would have ring A connected to ring B at position 1 of both rings.

Wait, no. Biphenyl is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. So, each ring has a point of attachment. So ring A's position 1 is connected to ring B's position (either 2 or 4, relative to OMe). So, the OMe is at position 1 on ring B, and the connection is at position 2 or 4 on ring B. So, when the biphenyl forms, ring B (anisole) has OMe at position 1, and the connection to ring A is at position 2 or 4.

Wait, maybe I should draw this out mentally. Let's say ring B is the anisole ring with OMe at position 1. When the coupling occurs, the incoming group from the diazonium (from ring A) attaches to position 2 (ortho) or 4 (para) on ring B. So, the biphenyl will have ring A attached to ring B at position 2 or 4 of ring B.

So, the biphenyl structure would be such that ring B has OMe at position 1 and the connection to ring A at position 2 or 4. Then, ring A (from product 4) has a Br at position 3 (relative to the connection point, which is position 1 of ring A). So, when we look at ring A, the Br is in position 3, and the connection is position 1.

Wait, but in the biphenyl structure, the numbering is such that each ring is numbered to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So, the main substituents are the Br on one ring and the OMe on the other.

Let me try to figure out the numbering. Let's consider the biphenyl as 1,1'-biphenyl. So, the point of connection is position 1 on both rings. But wait, in our case, the connection is not necessarily at position 1 on both rings. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the biphenyl is formed such that the diazonium ring (ring A) connects to the anisole ring (ring B) at their respective positions. So, ring A has substituents at positions 1 (where it's connected to ring B) and 3 (Br). Ring B has substituents at position 1 (OMe) and position 2 or 4 (the connection point to ring A).

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the final structure. The final product is a biphenyl with substituents. Let me look at the options:

Option C is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. So, the biphenyl is connected at position 1 of each ring. The left ring (ring 1) has Br at position 3, and the right ring (ring 1') has OMe at position 4'.

Wait, or is it the other way around? Let me think about the substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the positioning is such that ring A (from product 4) has Br at position 3 relative to the point of connection (position 1), and ring B (anisole) has OMe at position 4 relative to the connection point.

Wait, but the OMe is in position 1 on ring B, and the connection is at position 4 on ring B. So, the OMe and the connection are at positions 1 and 4 on ring B, meaning that the OMe is at position 4' relative to the connection point (since ring B is the second ring, so it's the 1', 2', etc.). Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of each substituent's position on the biphenyl.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about what each step does in terms of functional groups and directing effects.

Wait, let me recap all steps:

1. Benzene â nitrobenzene (product 1)
2. Nitrobenzene â brominate in meta â 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene (product 2)
3. Reduce nitro to amine â 1-amino-3-bromobenzene (product 3)
4. Diazotize amine â 1-diazonium-3-bromobenzene (product 4)
5. Heat with anisole â coupling to form biphenyl

So, the coupling would link the diazonium ring (ring A) to the anisole ring (ring B). The OMe is in position 1 on ring B. The coupling occurs at position 2 or 4 on ring B (ortho or para to OMe). So, the connection point on ring B is 2 or 4.

So, ring A is connected at position 1 of itself (since that's where the diazonium group was) to position 2 or 4 on ring B.

Now, in the biphenyl, the substituents on each ring are:

- Ring A: Br at position 3 (relative to connection at position 1)
- Ring B: OMe at position 1 (relative to connection point at position 2 or 4)

So, the positions on each ring are as follows.

Assuming the connection is at position 2 on ring B (anisole):

- Ring A: positions 1 (connected to ring B at position 2), and Br at position 3 (so on ring A, Br is at position 3)
- Ring B: position 1 (OMe), position 2 (connected to ring A), and what's the position of OMe relative to the connection point?

Wait, if ring B has OMe at position 1, and the connection is at position 2, then OMe is one position away from the connection. So on the biphenyl, ring B's substituents are OMe at position 1 and the connection at position 2.

Wait, but in terms of the biphenyl nomenclature, ring B would be the attached ring, so their positions are numbered as 1', 2', etc. So, if ring B (anisole) is connected at position 2, then OMe is at position 1, which is adjacent (ortho) to the connection (position 2). So, the OMe is at position 1 on ring B, which is position 2' on the biphenyl. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the final structure.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.

So, the biphenyl is connected at position 1 on each ring. The left ring has a Br at position 3, and the right ring (1') has a OMe at position 4'. So, the OMe is at position 4 on ring 1', which is in the para position relative to the connection point.

So, when the coupling occurs, the OMe is at position 4' (since the connection is at 1'), which would be the para position on ring B (anisole). So, the coupling would have occurred at the para position on anisole relative to OMe.

Wait, but anisole's OMe is at position 1. So, the para position would be position 4 on the same ring. So, the connection would be at position 4 on ring B. Thus, the biphenyl would have ring A connected to ring B at position 4 on ring B. So, ring B's substituents are OMe at position 1 and connection at position 4.

Wait, but the biphenyl is numbered such that the main substituents get the lowest numbers. So, in option C, the substituents are Br at 3 and OMe at 4', which are on opposite rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the OMe is on the same ring as the connection. Let me try to imagine the structure.

In the end, the biphenyl would have Br on ring 1 at position 3 and OMe on ring 1' at position 4. So, the structure is 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl, which is option C.

So, putting it all together:

- Step 1: Nitration â nitrobenzene
- Step 2: Bromination in meta â 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene
- Step 3: Reduction â 1-amino-3-bromobenzene
- Step 4: Diazotization â 1-diazonium-3-bromobenzene
- Step 5: Coupling with anisole â OMe is at position 4' and Br at position 3 on the biphenyl.

So, the correct answer is option C: 3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl.


The problem involves a series of reactions starting with benzene and proceeding through several transformations to yield a final biphenyl product. Here's the analysis of each step:

1. **Nitration with HNOâ and HâSOâ**: Benzene undergoes nitration to form nitrobenzene (product 1). The nitro group (-NOâ) is introduced as the first substituent.

2. **Bromination with Brâ and Fe**: Nitrobenzene is treated with bromine in the presence of Fe, which introduces a bromine atom. The nitro group is a meta-directing group, so bromination occurs at the meta position relative to the nitro group, forming 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene (product 2).

3. **Reduction with Pd/C and Hâ**: The nitro group in 1-nitro-3-bromobenzene is reduced to an amino group (-NHâ), yielding 1-amino-3-bromobenzene (product 3).

4. **Diazotization with NaNOâ and HBFâ**: The amino group in 1-amino-3-bromobenzene is converted into a diazonium group (-Nââº), forming 1-diazonium-3-bromobenzene (product 4).

5. **Coupling with Anisole**: The diazonium salt reacts with anisole (methoxybenzene) under heating. The diazonium group couples with the aromatic ring of anisole, forming a biphenyl structure. The methoxy group (-OMe) on anisole is an ortho/para-directing group, and the coupling occurs at the para position relative to the methoxy group. This results in a biphenyl where the original benzene ring (from product 4) has a bromine atom at position 3, and the anisole-derived ring has a methoxy group at position 4'.

The final product is **3-bromo-4'-methoxy-1,1'-biphenyl**, which corresponds to option C.
