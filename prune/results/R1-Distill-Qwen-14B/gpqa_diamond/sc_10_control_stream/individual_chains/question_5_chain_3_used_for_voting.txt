Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is given with its X, Y, and Z components. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Right, so the operator P is a vector operator, and it's probably the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

Let me write down the components they gave. 

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. And Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

The operator in the direction n is given by the vector dot product P · n. Since n is in the x-z plane, its direction can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because it's in x-z, the y-component is zero. So the operator is P · n = Px sinθ + Pz cosθ.

Wait, no, wait. The direction vector n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, so it has components (n_x, 0, n_z). But n_x and n_z are such that n_x² + n_z² = 1. Let me think in terms of angles. Let θ be the angle from the z-axis, so n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. So the operator P along n is P·n = Px sinθ + Pz cosθ.

Wait, no, wait. The components of the operator P are vectors in the x,y,z directions. So P·n is the sum over i of P_i * n_i. So since n has n_x, n_y, n_z, but wait, wait the direction is in x-z plane, so n_y is zero. So P·n = Px n_x + Pz n_z.

So yeah, n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ, because in spherical coordinates, the x component is sinθ cosφ, but since we're in x-z, φ is zero or π? Wait, no, in x-z, φ is 0, so the angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So n would have components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but wait, in 3D, the x component is actually sinθ cosφ. But since φ is zero (since in x-z plane), cosφ is 1, so n_x is sinθ. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Hence, the operator P·n is P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Wait, no, wait a second. Because P is a vector operator, right. So the operator along n is P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y = 0. So it's n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So the operator matrix is:

n_x * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that. Let me substitute n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. So:

Operator = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So combining the matrices:

First term: sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]]

Second term: cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Add them:

Top-left: 0 + cosθ → cosθ

Top-right: sinθ → sinθ

Bottom-left: sinθ → sinθ

Bottom-right: -cosθ → -cosθ

So the operator matrix is:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Wait, no, wait. Because adding the two matrices:

First matrix (after sinθ multiplication) is:

[ [0, sinθ],
  [sinθ, 0] ]

Second matrix is:

[ [cosθ, 0],
  [0, -cosθ] ]

Adding them:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So the operator is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix.

So the operator is:

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
            [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So when we find eigenvectors of this operator, the eigenvalue is ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

[ (ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
             [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Wait, wait, because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So the equation is:

Operator * |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

We can write this as:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] |v> = |v>

Because when we factor out (ħ/2) from both sides, it cancels, leaving the matrix multiplied by |v> equal to |v>.

So the matrix equation is:

[ [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ] |v> = 0

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The equation is [M] |v> = (1) |v>, where M is the matrix [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ].

So,

( M - I ) |v> = 0.

So the matrix (M - I) is:

[ [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ - 1 ] ]

We need to find the non-trivial solutions (eigenvectors) of this equation.

So the determinant of (M - I) must be zero.

Calculating the determinant:

( cosθ - 1 )( -cosθ - 1 ) - ( sinθ )^2 = 0

Let me compute that:

First term: (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = (-cosθ)(cosθ -1) -1*(cosθ -1) = -cos²θ + cosθ - cosθ + 1 = -cos²θ + 1.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to multiply it out directly.

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = (-cos^2 theta - cos theta + cos theta +1 ) = (-cos²theta +1)

So determinant becomes (-cos²theta +1 ) - sin²theta = 0

Because the second term is (sin theta)^2 multiplied by 1 (from sin theta * sin theta).

So:

(-cos² theta +1) - sin² theta = 0

But 1 - cos² theta = sin² theta, so this becomes sin² theta - sin² theta = 0 → 0 =0.

So the equation is satisfied for any theta, which makes sense because we're looking for the eigenvalue 1 (since M |v> = 1 |v>).

Wait, but perhaps I should find the eigenvectors. Let's proceed.

So, the system of equations is:

( cosθ - 1 ) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0

sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1 ) v2 = 0

Let me write the first equation:

( cosθ - 1 ) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0

We can write this as:

v1 ( cosθ -1 ) = - v2 sinθ

So,

v1 = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] v2

But cosθ -1 = -(1 - cos theta ) = -2 sin^2(theta/2 )

Similarly, sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

So,

v1 = [ - (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) / ( -2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ) ] v2

Simplify:

The denominator is (cosθ -1) = -2 sin^2(theta/2) → so denominator is negative.

So the expression becomes:

v1 = [ - (2 sin (theta/2) cos(theta/2 )) / (-2 sin^2(theta/2)) ) ] v2

The negatives cancel, and 2 cancels with 2.

So,

v1 = [ ( sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / ( sin^2(theta/2) ) ) ] v2

Simplify:

= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] v2

= cot(theta/2) * v2

So, v1 = cot(theta/2) v2

Let me set v2 =1 (for simplicity, since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar). So v1 = cot(theta/2).

But wait, cot(theta/2) can be written as (1 + cos theta) / sin theta. Because:

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2 )

And 1 + cos theta = 2 cos^2(theta/2 ), sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

So,

cot(theta/2) = [ 2 cos^2(theta/2 ) ] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 ) ] = cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2 )

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

But we can write this as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), because if we factor out sin(theta/2 ) from numerator and denominator:

= [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2 ), 1 ]

= [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ] * [ 1 / sin(theta/2 ) ]

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

But wait, does this hold for all theta?

Wait, let me test theta = 0.

If theta is 0, direction is along z. Then, cos(theta/2 ) = cos(0) =1, sin(theta/2 )=0. So the eigenvector is (1,0), which makes sense because for Pz, the eigenvalue +ħ/2 is (1,0).

Another test: theta = 90 degrees (pi/2 radians). Then, cos(theta/2) = cos(pi/4 )= sqrt(2)/2, sin(theta/2 )= sqrt(2)/2. So the eigenvector is (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ), which is the same as (1,1) up to normalization. This is correct because when the direction is along the x-axis, the eigenstate with eigenvalue +ħ/2 is (1,1)/sqrt(2), which is the |+x> state.

So, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Wait, but wait, let me check the eigenvector for the case theta = 180 degrees (pi). Then, cos(theta/2 )= cos(pi/2 )=0, sin(theta/2 )=1. So the vector is (0,1). Which is the eigenstate for P_(-z), but since our eigenvalue is +ħ/2, and for Pz, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So, when theta is pi, the operator points in the negative z direction. So the eigenvalue +ħ/2 corresponds to (0,1), which is correct for P_z when direction is -z.

So, the general eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

But wait, the eigenvectors can have a global phase, but in the options, I see option C: (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) )

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C: ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) )

But wait, the question says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in x-z. So the eigenvector components are ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ), but wait, perhaps they're normalized.

Wait, the vector [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ] has a norm of 1, because cos^2 + sin^2 =1. So it's already normalized.

So the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) )

But wait, looking at the options, option C is exactly that. So the elements are cos(theta/2 ) and sin(theta/2 )

But wait, the options have some with hbar, others with just trigonometric functions.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A is ( sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ )

Option B is ( cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ )

Option C is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Option D: ( sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )

Wait, but wait, in my calculation, the eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ), without any hbar factors, since the operator is scaled by ħ/2, but the eigenvector is just a vector in Hilbert space, the components are dimensionless (assuming ħ is in the operator).

Wait, wait, but the question says the eigenvector's elements are to be found. So perhaps the options are considering whether the operator's components have ħ/2 factors, but the eigenvectors themselves are just vectors, so their elements shouldn't have ħ factors.

So option C is the correct one. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, in the operator, each component is multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator is a 2x2 matrix with elements scaled by ħ/2. The eigenvectors are just vectors in the space, so they don't have any factors of ħ. So the eigenvector components are just cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ), so option C.

But wait, looking at the options again, option C is (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )). So that's what I got.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the vector.

Wait, the equations I solved for theta give the eigenvector as [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

But in another approach, the eigenstates are the spin-up states along the direction n.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices along an arbitrary direction (n_x, n_y, n_z) are given by:

|+> = ( (n_x + i n_y ) |0> + (n_z + 1 ) |1> ) / sqrt( (n_x + i n_y )^2 + (n_z +1 )^2 )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it in terms of the direction vector.

Wait, another approach is that the eigenstate for spin-up along direction n is given by:

|+> = e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2) |0> + e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2)|1>

But in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero.

So phi =0, so the expression becomes:

cos(theta/2)|0> + sin(theta/2)|1>

Which matches our earlier result.

Thus, the vector is ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ), so option C is correct.

But wait, looking at the other options, option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ ), but since φ is zero in our case, that would give (cosθ, sinθ ), which is different from what we found.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator \( \vec{P} \) along an arbitrary direction \( \vec{n} \) in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \( +\hbar/2 \). The components of \( \vec{P} \) are given as:

- \( P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \),
- \( P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} \),
- \( P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \).

Since \( \vec{n} \) lies in the x-z plane, it can be represented as \( \vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta) \), where \( \theta \) is the angle from the z-axis. The operator along \( \vec{n} \) is given by:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta.
\]

Substituting the given components of \( P_x \) and \( P_z \), the operator becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
\]

Simplifying the matrix:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \right) |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle.
\]

Factoring out \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \), the eigenvalue equation becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} |v\rangle = |v\rangle.
\]

This implies:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} |v\rangle = 0.
\]

The first row of the matrix gives the equation:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)v_1 + \sin\theta v_2 = 0.
\]

Solving for \( v_1 \) in terms of \( v_2 \):

\[
v_1 = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} v_2.
\]

Using trigonometric identities, \( \sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2) \) and \( 1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2) \), we find:

\[
v_1 = \cot(\theta/2) v_2.
\]

Letting \( v_2 = 1 \), the eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This vector is already normalized, as \( \cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1 \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( (\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)) \).**

The other options are incorrect because:

- **A)** Includes \( \hbar \) factors, which are not part of the eigenvector components.
- **B)** Involves \( \cos\theta \) and \( \sin\theta \), which are not consistent with the derived eigenvector.
- **D)** Includes \( \hbar \) factors and additional coefficients, which are not present in the normalized eigenvector.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me try to figure it out. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P for a muon along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

Wait, the operator P is given with its X, Y, and Z components. Each component is a 2x2 matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Right, so the operator P is a vector operator, and it's probably the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ/2.

Let me write down the components they gave. 

Px is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. Oh right, that's the Pauli X matrix multiplied by ħ/2. Similarly, Py is (ħ/2) times [[0, -i],[i, 0]], which is the Pauli Y matrix. And Pz is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

The operator in the direction n is given by the vector dot product P · n. Since n is in the x-z plane, its direction can be represented as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because it's in x-z, the y-component is zero. So the operator is P · n = Px sinθ + Pz cosθ.

Wait, no, wait. The direction vector n is a unit vector in the x-z plane, so it has components (n_x, 0, n_z). But n_x and n_z are such that n_x² + n_z² = 1. Let me think in terms of angles. Let θ be the angle from the z-axis, so n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. So the operator P along n is P·n = Px sinθ + Pz cosθ.

Wait, no, wait. The components of the operator P are vectors in the x,y,z directions. So P·n is the sum over i of P_i * n_i. So since n has n_x, n_y, n_z, but wait, wait the direction is in x-z plane, so n_y is zero. So P·n = Px n_x + Pz n_z.

So yeah, n_x is sinθ, n_z is cosθ, because in spherical coordinates, the x component is sinθ cosφ, but since we're in x-z, φ is zero or π? Wait, no, in x-z, φ is 0, so the angle θ is measured from the z-axis. So n would have components (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but wait, in 3D, the x component is actually sinθ cosφ. But since φ is zero (since in x-z plane), cosφ is 1, so n_x is sinθ. So n is (sinθ, 0, cosθ). Hence, the operator P·n is P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Wait, no, wait a second. Because P is a vector operator, right. So the operator along n is P·n = n_x P_x + n_y P_y + n_z P_z. But since n is in x-z plane, n_y = 0. So it's n_x P_x + n_z P_z.

So the operator matrix is:

n_x * (ħ/2) * [[0,1],[1,0]] + n_z * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Let me compute that. Let me substitute n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. So:

Operator = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

So combining the matrices:

First term: sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]]

Second term: cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

Add them:

Top-left: 0 + cosθ → cosθ

Top-right: sinθ → sinθ

Bottom-left: sinθ → sinθ

Bottom-right: -cosθ → -cosθ

So the operator matrix is:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

Wait, no, wait. Because adding the two matrices:

First matrix (after sinθ multiplication) is:

[ [0, sinθ],
  [sinθ, 0] ]

Second matrix is:

[ [cosθ, 0],
  [0, -cosθ] ]

Adding them:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So the operator is (ħ/2) multiplied by this matrix.

So the operator is:

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
            [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Now, we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue +ħ/2.

Wait, because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So when we find eigenvectors of this operator, the eigenvalue is ħ/2.

So the eigenvalue equation is:

[ (ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
             [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] ] |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Wait, wait, because the eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. So the equation is:

Operator * |v> = (ħ/2) |v>

We can write this as:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] |v> = |v>

Because when we factor out (ħ/2) from both sides, it cancels, leaving the matrix multiplied by |v> equal to |v>.

So the matrix equation is:

[ [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ] |v> = 0

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The equation is [M] |v> = (1) |v>, where M is the matrix [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ].

So,

( M - I ) |v> = 0.

So the matrix (M - I) is:

[ [ cosθ - 1, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ - 1 ] ]

We need to find the non-trivial solutions (eigenvectors) of this equation.

So the determinant of (M - I) must be zero.

Calculating the determinant:

( cosθ - 1 )( -cosθ - 1 ) - ( sinθ )^2 = 0

Let me compute that:

First term: (cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = (-cosθ)(cosθ -1) -1*(cosθ -1) = -cos²θ + cosθ - cosθ + 1 = -cos²θ + 1.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to multiply it out directly.

(cosθ -1)(-cosθ -1) = (-cos^2 theta - cos theta + cos theta +1 ) = (-cos²theta +1)

So determinant becomes (-cos²theta +1 ) - sin²theta = 0

Because the second term is (sin theta)^2 multiplied by 1 (from sin theta * sin theta).

So:

(-cos² theta +1) - sin² theta = 0

But 1 - cos² theta = sin² theta, so this becomes sin² theta - sin² theta = 0 → 0 =0.

So the equation is satisfied for any theta, which makes sense because we're looking for the eigenvalue 1 (since M |v> = 1 |v>).

Wait, but perhaps I should find the eigenvectors. Let's proceed.

So, the system of equations is:

( cosθ - 1 ) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0

sinθ v1 + (-cosθ -1 ) v2 = 0

Let me write the first equation:

( cosθ - 1 ) v1 + sinθ v2 = 0

We can write this as:

v1 ( cosθ -1 ) = - v2 sinθ

So,

v1 = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] v2

But cosθ -1 = -(1 - cos theta ) = -2 sin^2(theta/2 )

Similarly, sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

So,

v1 = [ - (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) / ( -2 sin^2(theta/2) ) ) ] v2

Simplify:

The denominator is (cosθ -1) = -2 sin^2(theta/2) → so denominator is negative.

So the expression becomes:

v1 = [ - (2 sin (theta/2) cos(theta/2 )) / (-2 sin^2(theta/2)) ) ] v2

The negatives cancel, and 2 cancels with 2.

So,

v1 = [ ( sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) / ( sin^2(theta/2) ) ) ] v2

Simplify:

= [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] v2

= cot(theta/2) * v2

So, v1 = cot(theta/2) v2

Let me set v2 =1 (for simplicity, since eigenvectors are defined up to a scalar). So v1 = cot(theta/2).

But wait, cot(theta/2) can be written as (1 + cos theta) / sin theta. Because:

cot(theta/2) = cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2 )

And 1 + cos theta = 2 cos^2(theta/2 ), sin theta = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

So,

cot(theta/2) = [ 2 cos^2(theta/2 ) ] / [ 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 ) ] = cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2 )

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [ cot(theta/2), 1 ]

But we can write this as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ), because if we factor out sin(theta/2 ) from numerator and denominator:

= [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2 ), 1 ]

= [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ] * [ 1 / sin(theta/2 ) ]

So, the eigenvector is proportional to [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

But wait, does this hold for all theta?

Wait, let me test theta = 0.

If theta is 0, direction is along z. Then, cos(theta/2 ) = cos(0) =1, sin(theta/2 )=0. So the eigenvector is (1,0), which makes sense because for Pz, the eigenvalue +ħ/2 is (1,0).

Another test: theta = 90 degrees (pi/2 radians). Then, cos(theta/2) = cos(pi/4 )= sqrt(2)/2, sin(theta/2 )= sqrt(2)/2. So the eigenvector is (sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ), which is the same as (1,1) up to normalization. This is correct because when the direction is along the x-axis, the eigenstate with eigenvalue +ħ/2 is (1,1)/sqrt(2), which is the |+x> state.

So, the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Wait, but wait, let me check the eigenvector for the case theta = 180 degrees (pi). Then, cos(theta/2 )= cos(pi/2 )=0, sin(theta/2 )=1. So the vector is (0,1). Which is the eigenstate for P_(-z), but since our eigenvalue is +ħ/2, and for Pz, the eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So, when theta is pi, the operator points in the negative z direction. So the eigenvalue +ħ/2 corresponds to (0,1), which is correct for P_z when direction is -z.

So, the general eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

But wait, the eigenvectors can have a global phase, but in the options, I see option C: (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) )

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C: ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) )

But wait, the question says the operator is along an arbitrary direction n in x-z. So the eigenvector components are ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ), but wait, perhaps they're normalized.

Wait, the vector [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ] has a norm of 1, because cos^2 + sin^2 =1. So it's already normalized.

So the normalized eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) )

But wait, looking at the options, option C is exactly that. So the elements are cos(theta/2 ) and sin(theta/2 )

But wait, the options have some with hbar, others with just trigonometric functions.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A is ( sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ )

Option B is ( cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ )

Option C is ( cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) )

Option D: ( sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )

Wait, but wait, in my calculation, the eigenvector is ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ), without any hbar factors, since the operator is scaled by ħ/2, but the eigenvector is just a vector in Hilbert space, the components are dimensionless (assuming ħ is in the operator).

Wait, wait, but the question says the eigenvector's elements are to be found. So perhaps the options are considering whether the operator's components have ħ/2 factors, but the eigenvectors themselves are just vectors, so their elements shouldn't have ħ factors.

So option C is the correct one. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, in the operator, each component is multiplied by ħ/2. So the operator is a 2x2 matrix with elements scaled by ħ/2. The eigenvectors are just vectors in the space, so they don't have any factors of ħ. So the eigenvector components are just cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ), so option C.

But wait, looking at the options again, option C is (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )). So that's what I got.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the vector.

Wait, the equations I solved for theta give the eigenvector as [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

But in another approach, the eigenstates are the spin-up states along the direction n.

In quantum mechanics, the eigenstates of the Pauli matrices along an arbitrary direction (n_x, n_y, n_z) are given by:

|+> = ( (n_x + i n_y ) |0> + (n_z + 1 ) |1> ) / sqrt( (n_x + i n_y )^2 + (n_z +1 )^2 )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think of it in terms of the direction vector.

Wait, another approach is that the eigenstate for spin-up along direction n is given by:

|+> = e^{-i phi/2} cos(theta/2) |0> + e^{i phi/2} sin(theta/2)|1>

But in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, phi is zero.

So phi =0, so the expression becomes:

cos(theta/2)|0> + sin(theta/2)|1>

Which matches our earlier result.

Thus, the vector is ( cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ), so option C is correct.

But wait, looking at the other options, option B is (cosθ, e^{iφ} sinθ ), but since φ is zero in our case, that would give (cosθ, sinθ ), which is different from what we found.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the operator \( \vec{P} \) along an arbitrary direction \( \vec{n} \) in the x-z plane corresponding to the eigenvalue \( +\hbar/2 \). The components of \( \vec{P} \) are given as:

- \( P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \),
- \( P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix} \),
- \( P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \).

Since \( \vec{n} \) lies in the x-z plane, it can be represented as \( \vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta) \), where \( \theta \) is the angle from the z-axis. The operator along \( \vec{n} \) is given by:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta.
\]

Substituting the given components of \( P_x \) and \( P_z \), the operator becomes:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \left( \sin\theta \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} + \cos\theta \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \right).
\]

Simplifying the matrix:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \right) |v\rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} |v\rangle.
\]

Factoring out \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \), the eigenvalue equation becomes:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} |v\rangle = |v\rangle.
\]

This implies:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix} |v\rangle = 0.
\]

The first row of the matrix gives the equation:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)v_1 + \sin\theta v_2 = 0.
\]

Solving for \( v_1 \) in terms of \( v_2 \):

\[
v_1 = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} v_2.
\]

Using trigonometric identities, \( \sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2) \) and \( 1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2) \), we find:

\[
v_1 = \cot(\theta/2) v_2.
\]

Letting \( v_2 = 1 \), the eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This vector is already normalized, as \( \cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1 \). Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**C) \( (\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2)) \).**

The other options are incorrect because:

- **A)** Includes \( \hbar \) factors, which are not part of the eigenvector components.
- **B)** Involves \( \cos\theta \) and \( \sin\theta \), which are not consistent with the derived eigenvector.
- **D)** Includes \( \hbar \) factors and additional coefficients, which are not present in the normalized eigenvector.

Answer: C
