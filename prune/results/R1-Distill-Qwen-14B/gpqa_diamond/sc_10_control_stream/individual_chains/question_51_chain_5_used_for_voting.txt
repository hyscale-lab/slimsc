Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with conductors and charges, there are some key concepts like induction and image charges that come into play. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The problem states that a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are given, so maybe I can eliminate some possibilities based on what I know.

First, I recall that a grounded conductor means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge on it will go to the ground. But wait, in this case, the sphere is conducting, so when you place a charge near it, charges will redistribute. But since it's grounded, the induced charges on the sphere will leave, right? Or wait, no—wait, no. If the conducting sphere is grounded, any induced charges will cause the sphere to lose or gain electrons until the electric field inside the conductor is zero.

Wait, no, when you place a charge outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's charges redistribute. But since it's grounded, the induced charges on the sphere's surface will be such that the conductor remains neutral, unless the charge q induces an image charge. Hmm, maybe it's better to model this using the method of images.

The method of images is a technique used in electrostatics where you can model the potential due to a charge near a conductor by considering an image charge. For a conducting sphere, the image charge q' would be located inside the sphere, right? The image charge location depends on the radius of the sphere and the position of the real charge.

Wait, no, wait. The real charge is outside the sphere. So the image charge would be inside the sphere. The image charge q' is given by some formula. I think for a sphere of radius R, the image charge when a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center is q' = -(R/d) q, but wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the image charge is located at a point such that R is the radius of the sphere. The distance from the center of the sphere to the image charge q' would be R^2/d. So if the real charge q is at a distance d, then the image charge is at a distance R²/d from the center, along the same line.

Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. The image charge is at a distance R from the surface? No, perhaps the image charge is inside the sphere. Let me try to recall the formula. The image charge for a conducting sphere when a charge q is outside is given by q' = - (R^3 / d²) * q, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's q' = - (R² / d) q. Wait, maybe I should think about the potential.

The conducting sphere being grounded means its potential is zero. So the potential at the surface of the sphere must be the same as the ground, which is zero. So the potential at any point on the sphere's surface due to both the real charge and the image charge must sum to zero.

Wait, the potential due to the real charge q at a point on the sphere's surface (a distance R from the center) would be V1 = k q / (sqrt(d² + R²)). The potential due to the image charge q' would be V2 = k q' / (distance between q' and the point on the sphere). Hmm, the image charge is located at a point inside the sphere. Let me model this.

If the charge q is at a distance d from the center, then the image charge q' is at a distance x from the center, where x = R^2 / d. Because the distance from the charge to the center is d, the image is inside at x = R²/d. So the distance between the real charge q and the image charge q' would be d - x = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d. Wait, but for points on the sphere's surface, the distance from q' to a point on the sphere would be R - x'? Wait, no. Let's try this again.

The image charge q' is located along the line connecting the charge q and the center of the sphere. The distance from the center to the image charge is x = R²/d. So when I consider the potential at the surface of the sphere (radius R), the potential due to q is k q / (sqrt(d² + R²)), because the charge q is at a distance d from the center, and any point on the surface is at a distance sqrt(d² + R²) from q if it's along the same line. Wait, no, that's not right. If the charge q is at a distance d from the center along, say, the x-axis, then a point on the sphere's surface along that line would be at distance d + R from q (if it's on the same side) or d - R (on the opposite side). But wait, no, because the sphere has radius R, so if the center is at the origin, the charge is at (d, 0), then a point on the sphere along that line would be at (R,0) if d > R. So the distance from q (at d) to (R,0) would be d - R. So the potential due to q at that point is k q / (d - R).

Similarly, the image charge q' is at x = R²/d from the center. So the distance from q' (position x = R²/d) to the point (R,0) on the sphere is R - (R²/d). So the potential due to q' at that point is k q' / (R - R²/d) = k q' d (R (d - R)) / (d (R - R²/d) )? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the potential at the surface must be zero because the sphere is grounded. So the sum of the potentials due to q and q' at the surface is zero.

So, V = V_q + V_q' = 0.

V_q = k q / (distance from q to surface point) = k q / (d - R) [since the charge is outside, and the point is along the same line, so distance is d - R.]

Similarly, the image charge is located at x = R²/d, which is inside the sphere. So the distance from the image charge to the point on the sphere (R,0) is R - x = R - (R²/d) = R (d - R)/d.

So, V_q' = k q' / [R(d-R)/d] ) = k q' d / [R(d - R)].

So summing V_q and V_q' gives zero:

k q / (d - R) + [k q' d / (R (d - R))] = 0.

Multiply both sides by (d - R):

k q + (k q' d)/(R) ) = 0.

Divide by k:

q + (q' d)/R = 0.

So,

q' d = - R q.

Therefore, q' = - R q / d.

So the image charge is q' = - (R q) / d.

Wait, that's interesting. So the image charge magnitude is (R/d) * q, and it's negative.

Now, the potential energy U of the system is the work done to bring the charge q near the sphere, which would be the work done against the electric field. Alternatively, the potential energy can be calculated using the interaction between the real charge and the image charge.

Wait, because when you bring a charge near a conductor, the system's potential energy is the same as the work done by the external force. And in the method of images, this is equivalent to the potential energy between the real charge and the image charge.

So the potential energy U is equal to the potential energy between q and q', which are two point charges separated by a certain distance.

The distance between q and q' is (d - x), where x is the distance from the center to q', which is R²/d. So the separation is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So the distance r between q and q' is r = (d² - R²)/d.

The potential energy between two point charges is U = k q1 q2 / r.

So substituting q1 = q, q2 = q' = - (R q)/d, and r = (d² - R²)/d.

So,

U = k * q * (-R q/d) / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

Let me compute that:

U = [ -k R q² / d ] / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

Simplify the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator:

The division is [ (-k R q² / d) ] * [ d / (d² - R²) ) ]

The d cancels out:

U = [ -k R q² ] * [ 1 / (d² - R²) ) ]

Which is:

U = - (k R q²) / (d² - R²)

But wait, none of the options have that. Let me check again.

Wait, the options are:

A) U=− (1/2) k q² d/(d²+R²)
B) U=−k q² d/(d²−R²)
C) U=−(1/2) k q² R²/(d²−R²)
D) U=− (1/2) *k q² R/(d²−R²)

Hmm, my calculated U is - (k R q^2) / (d² - R^2). But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy of the system when a charge is placed near a conductor is indeed the same as the potential energy between the charge and its image. But perhaps I missed a factor of 1/2 somewhere.

Wait, another thought: When you use the method of images, the potential energy is given by (1/2) times the potential energy of the image system. Because when you place the image charge, you're effectively considering the potential energy as if you have two charges, but you shouldn't double count.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Another way to think: The potential energy U is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, which is the same as the work done by the external force against the electric field created by the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges on the sphere have a certain distribution, but the image method models this as a single charge inside the sphere.

Alternatively, the potential energy could be the sum of the self-energy of the sphere and the interaction between the charge and the sphere. But wait, the sphere is neutral, right? Because it's grounded. So the sphere's self-energy wouldn't contribute, but perhaps only the interaction energy.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the potential energy is the work done in assembling the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is neutral, the only contribution comes from the charge q and the image charge.

Wait, in the method of images, the system's potential energy is considered as the potential energy of the real charge and the image charge. So U = (1/2) k (q q') / r, where r is the separation. Because when you have two charges, the potential energy is (1/2) times the product of each pair.

Wait, that's right! Because the potential energy between two point charges is U = k q1 q2 / r, but when you model the image charge, the real charge and the image charge are considered as a pair, so you should take half of that to avoid double-counting. Because when you bring two charges together, you count each interaction once.

So, let's recalculate using that.

q' = - (R q)/d.

The separation r is (d² - R²)/d.

So the potential energy U is (1/2) * [k * q * q' ] / r.

Substituting q' and r:

U = (1/2) * [ k * q * (- R q/d) ] / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= (1/2) * [ -k R q² / d ] * [ d / (d² - R²) ]

The d's cancel:

= (1/2) * [ -k R q² ] / (d² - R² )

So,

U = - (k R q² ) / [ 2 (d² - R²) ]

Looking at the options, option C is U = - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²). That's similar, but has R squared in the numerator. Hmm, so that's different from what I have here, which has R in the numerator.

Alternatively, maybe I messed up the image charge. Let me recheck the image charge calculation.

Earlier, I thought that the image charge q' = - (R q) / d. But perhaps I made a mistake there. Let me revisit that part.

We have the condition that the potential at the sphere's surface is zero (because it's grounded). The potential due to q and q' must sum to zero.

V = V_q + V_q' = 0.

V_q is the potential at the surface due to q. If the charge q is at a distance d from the center, and the surface point is along that line, the distance from q to the surface point is d - R (since d > R, as the charge is outside the sphere).

So V_q = k q / (d - R).

The image charge is located at x = R²/d from the center, so its distance from the surface point is R - x = R - (R²/d) = R (d - R)/d.

So V_q' = k q' / [ R (d - R)/d ) ] = (k q' d) / [ R (d - R) ) ]

Adding the potentials:

k q / (d - R) + (k q' d) / [ R (d - R) ) ] = 0

Multiply both sides by (d - R):

k q + (k q' d) / R = 0

Divide by k:

q + (q' d)/R = 0 → q' d = - R q → q' = - (R q)/d.

So that part seems correct. So the image charge is - (R q)/d.

So why isn't any of the options matching my result? Let's check each option.

Option C: - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²)

Which is - (k R² q² )/(2 (d² - R^2))

Which is different from my U, which is - (k R q² )/(2 (d²-R^2)).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the separation between q and q'?

Wait, the separation r is the distance between q (at d) and q' (at R²/d). So the distance between them is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d. That's correct.

So the U is (1/2) * [ k * q * q' ] / r.

Substituting q' = - R q/d and r = (d² - R²)/d.

Putting it all into U:

U = (1/2) * [ k * q * (- R q/d) ] / [ (d² - R^2)/d ]

= (1/2) * [ (-k R q²/d) ) ] * [ d / (d² - R²) ) ]

The d's cancel, so:

= (1/2) * [ (-k R q²) ) / (d² - R²) ]

Which would be:

U = - (k R q² )/( 2 (d² - R²) )

Looking at the options:

Option C is U= - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R^2)

So that's different because it has R squared in the numerator.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge value. Alternatively, maybe I should model this differently.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position near the sphere, considering the induced charges. Alternatively, the potential energy can be found by considering the electrostatic potential.

The potential at the point where the charge q is placed is the sum of the potential due to the sphere's induced charges. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the potential on the sphere is zero. So the potential at the location of q is due to the image charge q'.

The potential energy U is q times the potential at that point, which would be q * V, where V is the potential at the location of q due to the image charge.

Wait, but V at point q is due to the image charge q', which is located at a distance (d - R²/d) from q. Wait, no. The location of q' is R²/d from the center, so the distance from q to q' is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So the potential at q due to q' is V = k q' / [ (d² - R²)/d ].

So U = q * V = q * [ k q' d / (d² - R²) ]

Substituting q' = - R q/d:

U = q * [ k (- R q/d) * d / (d² - R²) ) ]

Simplify:

= q * [ -k R q / (d² - R²) ) ]

= - k R q² / (d² - R² )

Wait, that's different from before. But earlier, when I considered the method of images with (1/2) factor, I had U = - (k R q² )/(2 (d² - R^2) )

But now, this approach gives U = -k R q²/(d² - R^2 )

Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the potential energy of the system as consisting of two parts: the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, and the work done to bring the image charge into place.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to compute the potential energy as the sum of the self-energy of the sphere and the interaction between the charge and the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, its self-energy might be zero, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy U of the system is the potential energy of the charge q in the field of the grounded sphere. The sphere, being grounded, has a potential of zero. The potential at the location of q is due to the induced charges on the sphere, which can be modeled as the image charge.

So the potential at q's location is V = k q' / r, where r is the distance between q and q'.

As before, V = k q' / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

So V = k q' d / (d² - R² )

The potential energy U is q * V.

So U = q * [k q' d / (d² - R² ) ]

Substituting q' = - R q/d:

U = q * [ k (- R q/d) d / (d² - R² ) ]

Simplify:

= q * [ -k R q / (d² - R²) ) ]

= -k R q² / (d² - R² )

Hmm, that's the same as before.

But looking back at the options, none of them match this exactly. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, another thought: The potential energy of the system when a charge is placed outside a grounded conducting sphere is given by U = - (1/2) k q^2 ( R ) / (d² - R² )

Wait, that's similar to option C but with R² in the numerator. Let me recheck.

Wait, I'm getting U = -k R q²/(d² - R²), but none of the options have that. Option C is U= - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R² )

Ah, perhaps I missed a factor of 1/2 somewhere. Maybe because the potential energy in the image method is calculated as half the product of the two charges, as each pair is counted once.

Wait, earlier when I considered the potential energy between q and q', I had U = (1/2) (k q q' ) / r.

So, let's calculate that again.

q' = - R q / d.

r = (d² - R²)/d.

So,

U = (1/2) * [ k * q * (- R q/d) ] / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

= (1/2) * [ (-k R q²/d) ] * [ d/(d² - R²) )

The d's cancel:

= (1/2) * [ -k R q² ] / (d² - R² )

So,

U = - (k R q² )/( 2 (d² - R²) )

Now, comparing this to the options:

Option C is U= - (1/2) k q² R^2/(d^2 - R^2) → which is - (k R² q² )/(2 (d² - R^2) )

Hmm, that's different. So the numerator in the correct U is R q², but option C has R² q².

So perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge calculation. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-calculate the image charge.

The image charge method for a sphere: When a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge q' is located at a distance R²/d from the center, along the line connecting the charge and the center.

The magnitude of the image charge is given by q' = (R^3 / d^2) q, but wait, I'm not confident about that. Alternatively, I think the image charge is located at x = R^2/d, and the magnitude is q' = (R q) / (d) ?

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the image charge formula for a sphere. From what I recall, for a conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge q' of a charge q placed at a distance d from the center is given by q' = (R^2 / d) * q. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach: The potential at the surface due to q and q' must be zero.

The potential due to q at a point on the sphere's surface (say, along the line) is V_q = k q / (d - R).

The potential due to q' at that same point is V_q' = k q' / (R - x), where x is the position of q' from the center. Wait, x is R²/d, so the distance from q' to the surface point is R - (R²/d) = R (d - R)/d.

So,

V_q' = k q' / [ R (d - R)/d ] = (k q' d ) / ( R (d - R) )

Sum to zero:

k q/(d - R) + (k q' d)/( R (d - R) ) ) = 0.

Multiply both sides by (d - R):

k q + (k q' d )/( R ) ) = 0.

Divide by k:

q + (q' d)/R = 0 → q' d = - R q → q' = - R q/(d )

So this part seems correct. So q' = - R q / d.

So, the image charge is - R q/d.

So perhaps the issue is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position, which is the same as the potential energy of the system. So the potential at the location of q is the potential due to the image charge.

So U = q * V, where V is the potential at q's position due to q'.

The distance between q and q' is (d² - R²)/d.

So,

V = k q' / r = k ( - R q/d ) / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

= k (- R q )/(d² - R² )

So,

U = q * V = q * [ -k R q/(d² - R^2) ) ]

= - k R q^2 / (d² - R^2 )

But looking at the options again, this is U = -k R q²/(d² - R^2), which isn't one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the potential energy involves the work done in assembling the system, which includes the image charge. But since the image charge is part of the conductor, perhaps the potential energy is only between q and the sphere's induced charges (modeled as the image charge), but in reality, the sphere is neutral, so the image charge is a model. Therefore, perhaps the correct expression is U = - (k R q² )/(2 (d² - R^2) )

Wait, but again, that's not matching the options. Let me think again.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps option A is the correct one. Let me see:

Option A: U = - (1/2) k q^2 d/(d^2 + R^2 )

Doesn't match.

Option B: U= -k q^2 d/(d^2 - R^2 )

No, that would be if our U was -k q^2 d/(d^2 - R^2 ), which isn't the case.

Option D: U= - (1/2) k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2 )

Again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the separation between the charges. Let me check again.

The real charge q is at a distance d from the center. The image charge q' is at a distance x = R²/d from the center. So the separation is d - x = d - R²/d = (d² - R^2)/d.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is (d + x) if they are on opposite sides. Wait no, because q is outside, and the image is inside, so the distance is d - x.

So, the separation is correct as (d² - R^2)/d.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy should be (1/2) k q q' / r.

So let's plug in q', r, and see:

U = (1/2) * [ (k) * q * ( - R q /d ) ] / [ (d² - R² ) / d ]

= (1/2) * [ (-k R q² ) / d ] * [ d / (d² - R² ) ]

Simplifying:

= (1/2) * ( -k R q² ) / (d² - R² )

So U = - (k R q² )/( 2 (d² - R²) )

Looking at the options, option C is U= - (1/2) k q² R^2/(d^2 - R^2 )

Which is:

U = - (k R^2 q^2 )/( 2 (d² - R^2) )

Hmm, not the same. So perhaps the correct formula isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the image charge is q' = - R^2 q / d. Let me reevaluate the image charge calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the image charge placement. Let me think again.

The method of images for a grounded sphere: The image charge is within the sphere, so that any induced charges on the sphere are accounted for. The image charge q' is located at a distance x from the center such that x = R²/d.

Wait, no, that's correct. So q' = - R q/d is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the potential energy as the energy stored in the system of the real charge and the image charge. Since the image charge is inside the conductor, but the conductor is neutral, perhaps the total potential energy includes only the interaction between q and the image charge.

So, if U = (1/2) k q q' / r, then with q' = - R q/d, r = (d² - R²)/d, then:

U = 0.5 * k * q * (- R q/d) / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

= 0.5 * [ -k R q²/d ] * [d/(d² - R²) ]

= 0.5 * (-k R q²) / (d² - R^2 )

= - (k R q² )/( 2 (d² - R^2) )

Which again, none of the options match.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but given the options, perhaps option C is the intended one, but I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the potential energy is calculated differently when the sphere is grounded. Oh wait, perhaps the potential energy is the work done by the external force to bring the charge q near the sphere, which equals the potential at the location of q multiplied by q. And the potential at the location of q is due to the sphere's induced charges, which can be modeled as the image charge.

So, the potential at q's location is V = k q' / r', where r' is the distance from q' to q, which is (d^2 - R^2)/d.

So,

V = k q' / [ (d^2 - R^2)/d ] = k q' d/(d^2 - R^2 )

The potential energy U is q * V = q * [k q' d/(d^2 - R^2 ) ]

Substituting q' = - R q/d:

U = q * [ k (- R q/d ) * d/(d^2 - R^2 ) ]

= q * [ -k R q/(d^2 - R^2 ) ]

= -k R q^2/(d^2 - R^2 )

So again, this doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps the image charge is q' = - (R/d) q. So if I substitute that, then:

U = -k R q^2/(d^2 - R^2 )

Comparing with the options, none match, but perhaps I should check which option could be rewritten as this.

Looking at option C: U= - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R^2 )

That's - (k R² q² )/( 2 (d² - R^2) )

Which is twice as small as my result, but with R squared.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge calculation. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps the image charge for a grounded sphere is q' = - ( R q )/(d - R )

Wait, that would change the calculation. Let me try that.

If q' = - ( R q ) / (d - R ), then:

r = distance between q and q' is d - (R^2/(d - R )) ?

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the formula for the potential energy of a charge near a conducting sphere.

After some research, I recall that the potential energy when a charge q is placed outside a grounded conducting sphere of radius R is U = - (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R² )

Wait, that's option D.

Wait, but when I calculated earlier, I got U = - (k R q² )/( 2 (d² - R²) )

Which is - (k R q^2 )/(2 (d^2 - R^2) )

Which would be option D: U= - (1/2) k q² R/(d^2 - R^2 )

Yes, that matches.

Wait a minute, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the image charge approach, but the correct answer is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the image charge approach gives U = - (k R q²)/( 2 (d² - R²) ), which is option D.

So, the correct answer would be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we consider the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \) using the method of images. The grounded sphere ensures that its potential is zero, and the induced charges on the sphere can be modeled as an image charge \( q' \) inside the sphere.

### Key Steps:
1. **Image Charge Calculation**:  
   The image charge \( q' \) is located at a distance \( x = \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the charge \( q \) and the center of the sphere. The magnitude of the image charge is given by:
   \[
   q' = -\frac{R q}{d}.
   \]

2. **Separation Between \( q \) and \( q' \)**:  
   The distance between the real charge \( q \) (at \( d \)) and the image charge \( q' \) (at \( \frac{R^2}{d} \)) is:
   \[
   r = d - \frac{R^2}{d} = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}.
   \]

3. **Potential Energy Between \( q \) and \( q' \)**:  
   The potential energy \( U \) between two point charges is given by:

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option D**.

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potential energy of a system involving a charge and a grounded conducting sphere. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with conductors and charges, there are some key concepts like induction and image charges that come into play. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The problem states that a charge q is placed a distance d away from the center of a grounded conducting sphere of radius R. I need to find the net potential energy of this system. The options are given, so maybe I can eliminate some possibilities based on what I know.

First, I recall that a grounded conductor means it's connected to the Earth, so any excess charge on it will go to the ground. But wait, in this case, the sphere is conducting, so when you place a charge near it, charges will redistribute. But since it's grounded, the induced charges on the sphere will leave, right? Or wait, no—wait, no. If the conducting sphere is grounded, any induced charges will cause the sphere to lose or gain electrons until the electric field inside the conductor is zero.

Wait, no, when you place a charge outside a conducting sphere, the sphere's charges redistribute. But since it's grounded, the induced charges on the sphere's surface will be such that the conductor remains neutral, unless the charge q induces an image charge. Hmm, maybe it's better to model this using the method of images.

The method of images is a technique used in electrostatics where you can model the potential due to a charge near a conductor by considering an image charge. For a conducting sphere, the image charge q' would be located inside the sphere, right? The image charge location depends on the radius of the sphere and the position of the real charge.

Wait, no, wait. The real charge is outside the sphere. So the image charge would be inside the sphere. The image charge q' is given by some formula. I think for a sphere of radius R, the image charge when a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center is q' = -(R/d) q, but wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Alternatively, the image charge is located at a point such that R is the radius of the sphere. The distance from the center of the sphere to the image charge q' would be R^2/d. So if the real charge q is at a distance d, then the image charge is at a distance R²/d from the center, along the same line.

Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. The image charge is at a distance R from the surface? No, perhaps the image charge is inside the sphere. Let me try to recall the formula. The image charge for a conducting sphere when a charge q is outside is given by q' = - (R^3 / d²) * q, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's q' = - (R² / d) q. Wait, maybe I should think about the potential.

The conducting sphere being grounded means its potential is zero. So the potential at the surface of the sphere must be the same as the ground, which is zero. So the potential at any point on the sphere's surface due to both the real charge and the image charge must sum to zero.

Wait, the potential due to the real charge q at a point on the sphere's surface (a distance R from the center) would be V1 = k q / (sqrt(d² + R²)). The potential due to the image charge q' would be V2 = k q' / (distance between q' and the point on the sphere). Hmm, the image charge is located at a point inside the sphere. Let me model this.

If the charge q is at a distance d from the center, then the image charge q' is at a distance x from the center, where x = R^2 / d. Because the distance from the charge to the center is d, the image is inside at x = R²/d. So the distance between the real charge q and the image charge q' would be d - x = d - R²/d = (d² - R²)/d. Wait, but for points on the sphere's surface, the distance from q' to a point on the sphere would be R - x'? Wait, no. Let's try this again.

The image charge q' is located along the line connecting the charge q and the center of the sphere. The distance from the center to the image charge is x = R²/d. So when I consider the potential at the surface of the sphere (radius R), the potential due to q is k q / (sqrt(d² + R²)), because the charge q is at a distance d from the center, and any point on the surface is at a distance sqrt(d² + R²) from q if it's along the same line. Wait, no, that's not right. If the charge q is at a distance d from the center along, say, the x-axis, then a point on the sphere's surface along that line would be at distance d + R from q (if it's on the same side) or d - R (on the opposite side). But wait, no, because the sphere has radius R, so if the center is at the origin, the charge is at (d, 0), then a point on the sphere along that line would be at (R,0) if d > R. So the distance from q (at d) to (R,0) would be d - R. So the potential due to q at that point is k q / (d - R).

Similarly, the image charge q' is at x = R²/d from the center. So the distance from q' (position x = R²/d) to the point (R,0) on the sphere is R - (R²/d). So the potential due to q' at that point is k q' / (R - R²/d) = k q' d (R (d - R)) / (d (R - R²/d) )? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the potential at the surface must be zero because the sphere is grounded. So the sum of the potentials due to q and q' at the surface is zero.

So, V = V_q + V_q' = 0.

V_q = k q / (distance from q to surface point) = k q / (d - R) [since the charge is outside, and the point is along the same line, so distance is d - R.]

Similarly, the image charge is located at x = R²/d, which is inside the sphere. So the distance from the image charge to the point on the sphere (R,0) is R - x = R - (R²/d) = R (d - R)/d.

So, V_q' = k q' / [R(d-R)/d] ) = k q' d / [R(d - R)].

So summing V_q and V_q' gives zero:

k q / (d - R) + [k q' d / (R (d - R))] = 0.

Multiply both sides by (d - R):

k q + (k q' d)/(R) ) = 0.

Divide by k:

q + (q' d)/R = 0.

So,

q' d = - R q.

Therefore, q' = - R q / d.

So the image charge is q' = - (R q) / d.

Wait, that's interesting. So the image charge magnitude is (R/d) * q, and it's negative.

Now, the potential energy U of the system is the work done to bring the charge q near the sphere, which would be the work done against the electric field. Alternatively, the potential energy can be calculated using the interaction between the real charge and the image charge.

Wait, because when you bring a charge near a conductor, the system's potential energy is the same as the work done by the external force. And in the method of images, this is equivalent to the potential energy between the real charge and the image charge.

So the potential energy U is equal to the potential energy between q and q', which are two point charges separated by a certain distance.

The distance between q and q' is (d - x), where x is the distance from the center to q', which is R²/d. So the separation is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So the distance r between q and q' is r = (d² - R²)/d.

The potential energy between two point charges is U = k q1 q2 / r.

So substituting q1 = q, q2 = q' = - (R q)/d, and r = (d² - R²)/d.

So,

U = k * q * (-R q/d) / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

Let me compute that:

U = [ -k R q² / d ] / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

Simplify the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator:

The division is [ (-k R q² / d) ] * [ d / (d² - R²) ) ]

The d cancels out:

U = [ -k R q² ] * [ 1 / (d² - R²) ) ]

Which is:

U = - (k R q²) / (d² - R²)

But wait, none of the options have that. Let me check again.

Wait, the options are:

A) U=− (1/2) k q² d/(d²+R²)
B) U=−k q² d/(d²−R²)
C) U=−(1/2) k q² R²/(d²−R²)
D) U=− (1/2) *k q² R/(d²−R²)

Hmm, my calculated U is - (k R q^2) / (d² - R^2). But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy of the system when a charge is placed near a conductor is indeed the same as the potential energy between the charge and its image. But perhaps I missed a factor of 1/2 somewhere.

Wait, another thought: When you use the method of images, the potential energy is given by (1/2) times the potential energy of the image system. Because when you place the image charge, you're effectively considering the potential energy as if you have two charges, but you shouldn't double count.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Another way to think: The potential energy U is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, which is the same as the work done by the external force against the electric field created by the sphere. Since the sphere is grounded, the induced charges on the sphere have a certain distribution, but the image method models this as a single charge inside the sphere.

Alternatively, the potential energy could be the sum of the self-energy of the sphere and the interaction between the charge and the sphere. But wait, the sphere is neutral, right? Because it's grounded. So the sphere's self-energy wouldn't contribute, but perhaps only the interaction energy.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the potential energy is the work done in assembling the charge q and the induced charges on the sphere. But since the sphere is neutral, the only contribution comes from the charge q and the image charge.

Wait, in the method of images, the system's potential energy is considered as the potential energy of the real charge and the image charge. So U = (1/2) k (q q') / r, where r is the separation. Because when you have two charges, the potential energy is (1/2) times the product of each pair.

Wait, that's right! Because the potential energy between two point charges is U = k q1 q2 / r, but when you model the image charge, the real charge and the image charge are considered as a pair, so you should take half of that to avoid double-counting. Because when you bring two charges together, you count each interaction once.

So, let's recalculate using that.

q' = - (R q)/d.

The separation r is (d² - R²)/d.

So the potential energy U is (1/2) * [k * q * q' ] / r.

Substituting q' and r:

U = (1/2) * [ k * q * (- R q/d) ] / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= (1/2) * [ -k R q² / d ] * [ d / (d² - R²) ]

The d's cancel:

= (1/2) * [ -k R q² ] / (d² - R² )

So,

U = - (k R q² ) / [ 2 (d² - R²) ]

Looking at the options, option C is U = - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²). That's similar, but has R squared in the numerator. Hmm, so that's different from what I have here, which has R in the numerator.

Alternatively, maybe I messed up the image charge. Let me recheck the image charge calculation.

Earlier, I thought that the image charge q' = - (R q) / d. But perhaps I made a mistake there. Let me revisit that part.

We have the condition that the potential at the sphere's surface is zero (because it's grounded). The potential due to q and q' must sum to zero.

V = V_q + V_q' = 0.

V_q is the potential at the surface due to q. If the charge q is at a distance d from the center, and the surface point is along that line, the distance from q to the surface point is d - R (since d > R, as the charge is outside the sphere).

So V_q = k q / (d - R).

The image charge is located at x = R²/d from the center, so its distance from the surface point is R - x = R - (R²/d) = R (d - R)/d.

So V_q' = k q' / [ R (d - R)/d ) ] = (k q' d) / [ R (d - R) ) ]

Adding the potentials:

k q / (d - R) + (k q' d) / [ R (d - R) ) ] = 0

Multiply both sides by (d - R):

k q + (k q' d) / R = 0

Divide by k:

q + (q' d)/R = 0 → q' d = - R q → q' = - (R q)/d.

So that part seems correct. So the image charge is - (R q)/d.

So why isn't any of the options matching my result? Let's check each option.

Option C: - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R²)

Which is - (k R² q² )/(2 (d² - R^2))

Which is different from my U, which is - (k R q² )/(2 (d²-R^2)).

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the separation between q and q'?

Wait, the separation r is the distance between q (at d) and q' (at R²/d). So the distance between them is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d. That's correct.

So the U is (1/2) * [ k * q * q' ] / r.

Substituting q' = - R q/d and r = (d² - R²)/d.

Putting it all into U:

U = (1/2) * [ k * q * (- R q/d) ] / [ (d² - R^2)/d ]

= (1/2) * [ (-k R q²/d) ) ] * [ d / (d² - R²) ) ]

The d's cancel, so:

= (1/2) * [ (-k R q²) ) / (d² - R²) ]

Which would be:

U = - (k R q² )/( 2 (d² - R²) )

Looking at the options:

Option C is U= - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R^2)

So that's different because it has R squared in the numerator.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge value. Alternatively, maybe I should model this differently.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy of the system is the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position near the sphere, considering the induced charges. Alternatively, the potential energy can be found by considering the electrostatic potential.

The potential at the point where the charge q is placed is the sum of the potential due to the sphere's induced charges. Since the sphere is conducting and grounded, the potential on the sphere is zero. So the potential at the location of q is due to the image charge q'.

The potential energy U is q times the potential at that point, which would be q * V, where V is the potential at the location of q due to the image charge.

Wait, but V at point q is due to the image charge q', which is located at a distance (d - R²/d) from q. Wait, no. The location of q' is R²/d from the center, so the distance from q to q' is d - (R²/d) = (d² - R²)/d.

So the potential at q due to q' is V = k q' / [ (d² - R²)/d ].

So U = q * V = q * [ k q' d / (d² - R²) ]

Substituting q' = - R q/d:

U = q * [ k (- R q/d) * d / (d² - R²) ) ]

Simplify:

= q * [ -k R q / (d² - R²) ) ]

= - k R q² / (d² - R² )

Wait, that's different from before. But earlier, when I considered the method of images with (1/2) factor, I had U = - (k R q² )/(2 (d² - R^2) )

But now, this approach gives U = -k R q²/(d² - R^2 )

Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the potential energy of the system as consisting of two parts: the work done to bring the charge q from infinity to its position, and the work done to bring the image charge into place.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to compute the potential energy as the sum of the self-energy of the sphere and the interaction between the charge and the sphere. But since the sphere is grounded, its self-energy might be zero, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: The potential energy U of the system is the potential energy of the charge q in the field of the grounded sphere. The sphere, being grounded, has a potential of zero. The potential at the location of q is due to the induced charges on the sphere, which can be modeled as the image charge.

So the potential at q's location is V = k q' / r, where r is the distance between q and q'.

As before, V = k q' / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

So V = k q' d / (d² - R² )

The potential energy U is q * V.

So U = q * [k q' d / (d² - R² ) ]

Substituting q' = - R q/d:

U = q * [ k (- R q/d) d / (d² - R² ) ]

Simplify:

= q * [ -k R q / (d² - R²) ) ]

= -k R q² / (d² - R² )

Hmm, that's the same as before.

But looking back at the options, none of them match this exactly. So perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, another thought: The potential energy of the system when a charge is placed outside a grounded conducting sphere is given by U = - (1/2) k q^2 ( R ) / (d² - R² )

Wait, that's similar to option C but with R² in the numerator. Let me recheck.

Wait, I'm getting U = -k R q²/(d² - R²), but none of the options have that. Option C is U= - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R² )

Ah, perhaps I missed a factor of 1/2 somewhere. Maybe because the potential energy in the image method is calculated as half the product of the two charges, as each pair is counted once.

Wait, earlier when I considered the potential energy between q and q', I had U = (1/2) (k q q' ) / r.

So, let's calculate that again.

q' = - R q / d.

r = (d² - R²)/d.

So,

U = (1/2) * [ k * q * (- R q/d) ] / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

= (1/2) * [ (-k R q²/d) ] * [ d/(d² - R²) )

The d's cancel:

= (1/2) * [ -k R q² ] / (d² - R² )

So,

U = - (k R q² )/( 2 (d² - R²) )

Now, comparing this to the options:

Option C is U= - (1/2) k q² R^2/(d^2 - R^2) → which is - (k R² q² )/(2 (d² - R^2) )

Hmm, that's different. So the numerator in the correct U is R q², but option C has R² q².

So perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge calculation. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier. Let me re-calculate the image charge.

The image charge method for a sphere: When a charge q is placed at a distance d from the center of a conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge q' is located at a distance R²/d from the center, along the line connecting the charge and the center.

The magnitude of the image charge is given by q' = (R^3 / d^2) q, but wait, I'm not confident about that. Alternatively, I think the image charge is located at x = R^2/d, and the magnitude is q' = (R q) / (d) ?

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the image charge formula for a sphere. From what I recall, for a conducting sphere of radius R, the image charge q' of a charge q placed at a distance d from the center is given by q' = (R^2 / d) * q. Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach: The potential at the surface due to q and q' must be zero.

The potential due to q at a point on the sphere's surface (say, along the line) is V_q = k q / (d - R).

The potential due to q' at that same point is V_q' = k q' / (R - x), where x is the position of q' from the center. Wait, x is R²/d, so the distance from q' to the surface point is R - (R²/d) = R (d - R)/d.

So,

V_q' = k q' / [ R (d - R)/d ] = (k q' d ) / ( R (d - R) )

Sum to zero:

k q/(d - R) + (k q' d)/( R (d - R) ) ) = 0.

Multiply both sides by (d - R):

k q + (k q' d )/( R ) ) = 0.

Divide by k:

q + (q' d)/R = 0 → q' d = - R q → q' = - R q/(d )

So this part seems correct. So q' = - R q / d.

So, the image charge is - R q/d.

So perhaps the issue is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy is the work done in bringing the charge q from infinity to its position, which is the same as the potential energy of the system. So the potential at the location of q is the potential due to the image charge.

So U = q * V, where V is the potential at q's position due to q'.

The distance between q and q' is (d² - R²)/d.

So,

V = k q' / r = k ( - R q/d ) / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

= k (- R q )/(d² - R² )

So,

U = q * V = q * [ -k R q/(d² - R^2) ) ]

= - k R q^2 / (d² - R^2 )

But looking at the options again, this is U = -k R q²/(d² - R^2), which isn't one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the potential energy involves the work done in assembling the system, which includes the image charge. But since the image charge is part of the conductor, perhaps the potential energy is only between q and the sphere's induced charges (modeled as the image charge), but in reality, the sphere is neutral, so the image charge is a model. Therefore, perhaps the correct expression is U = - (k R q² )/(2 (d² - R^2) )

Wait, but again, that's not matching the options. Let me think again.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps option A is the correct one. Let me see:

Option A: U = - (1/2) k q^2 d/(d^2 + R^2 )

Doesn't match.

Option B: U= -k q^2 d/(d^2 - R^2 )

No, that would be if our U was -k q^2 d/(d^2 - R^2 ), which isn't the case.

Option D: U= - (1/2) k q^2 R/(d^2 - R^2 )

Again, not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the separation between the charges. Let me check again.

The real charge q is at a distance d from the center. The image charge q' is at a distance x = R²/d from the center. So the separation is d - x = d - R²/d = (d² - R^2)/d.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is (d + x) if they are on opposite sides. Wait no, because q is outside, and the image is inside, so the distance is d - x.

So, the separation is correct as (d² - R^2)/d.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the potential energy should be (1/2) k q q' / r.

So let's plug in q', r, and see:

U = (1/2) * [ (k) * q * ( - R q /d ) ] / [ (d² - R² ) / d ]

= (1/2) * [ (-k R q² ) / d ] * [ d / (d² - R² ) ]

Simplifying:

= (1/2) * ( -k R q² ) / (d² - R² )

So U = - (k R q² )/( 2 (d² - R²) )

Looking at the options, option C is U= - (1/2) k q² R^2/(d^2 - R^2 )

Which is:

U = - (k R^2 q^2 )/( 2 (d² - R^2) )

Hmm, not the same. So perhaps the correct formula isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the image charge is q' = - R^2 q / d. Let me reevaluate the image charge calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the image charge placement. Let me think again.

The method of images for a grounded sphere: The image charge is within the sphere, so that any induced charges on the sphere are accounted for. The image charge q' is located at a distance x from the center such that x = R²/d.

Wait, no, that's correct. So q' = - R q/d is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the potential energy as the energy stored in the system of the real charge and the image charge. Since the image charge is inside the conductor, but the conductor is neutral, perhaps the total potential energy includes only the interaction between q and the image charge.

So, if U = (1/2) k q q' / r, then with q' = - R q/d, r = (d² - R²)/d, then:

U = 0.5 * k * q * (- R q/d) / [ (d² - R²)/d ]

= 0.5 * [ -k R q²/d ] * [d/(d² - R²) ]

= 0.5 * (-k R q²) / (d² - R^2 )

= - (k R q² )/( 2 (d² - R^2) )

Which again, none of the options match.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but given the options, perhaps option C is the intended one, but I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the potential energy is calculated differently when the sphere is grounded. Oh wait, perhaps the potential energy is the work done by the external force to bring the charge q near the sphere, which equals the potential at the location of q multiplied by q. And the potential at the location of q is due to the sphere's induced charges, which can be modeled as the image charge.

So, the potential at q's location is V = k q' / r', where r' is the distance from q' to q, which is (d^2 - R^2)/d.

So,

V = k q' / [ (d^2 - R^2)/d ] = k q' d/(d^2 - R^2 )

The potential energy U is q * V = q * [k q' d/(d^2 - R^2 ) ]

Substituting q' = - R q/d:

U = q * [ k (- R q/d ) * d/(d^2 - R^2 ) ]

= q * [ -k R q/(d^2 - R^2 ) ]

= -k R q^2/(d^2 - R^2 )

So again, this doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps the image charge is q' = - (R/d) q. So if I substitute that, then:

U = -k R q^2/(d^2 - R^2 )

Comparing with the options, none match, but perhaps I should check which option could be rewritten as this.

Looking at option C: U= - (1/2) k q² R²/(d² - R^2 )

That's - (k R² q² )/( 2 (d² - R^2) )

Which is twice as small as my result, but with R squared.

So perhaps I made a mistake in the image charge calculation. Let me see.

Wait, perhaps the image charge for a grounded sphere is q' = - ( R q )/(d - R )

Wait, that would change the calculation. Let me try that.

If q' = - ( R q ) / (d - R ), then:

r = distance between q and q' is d - (R^2/(d - R )) ?

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the formula for the potential energy of a charge near a conducting sphere.

After some research, I recall that the potential energy when a charge q is placed outside a grounded conducting sphere of radius R is U = - (1/2) k q² R/(d² - R² )

Wait, that's option D.

Wait, but when I calculated earlier, I got U = - (k R q² )/( 2 (d² - R²) )

Which is - (k R q^2 )/(2 (d^2 - R^2) )

Which would be option D: U= - (1/2) k q² R/(d^2 - R^2 )

Yes, that matches.

Wait a minute, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier in the image charge approach, but the correct answer is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the image charge approach gives U = - (k R q²)/( 2 (d² - R²) ), which is option D.

So, the correct answer would be option D.


To calculate the net potential energy of the system, we consider the interaction between the charge \( q \) and the grounded conducting sphere of radius \( R \) using the method of images. The grounded sphere ensures that its potential is zero, and the induced charges on the sphere can be modeled as an image charge \( q' \) inside the sphere.

### Key Steps:
1. **Image Charge Calculation**:  
   The image charge \( q' \) is located at a distance \( x = \frac{R^2}{d} \) from the center of the sphere, along the line connecting the charge \( q \) and the center of the sphere. The magnitude of the image charge is given by:
   \[
   q' = -\frac{R q}{d}.
   \]

2. **Separation Between \( q \) and \( q' \)**:  
   The distance between the real charge \( q \) (at \( d \)) and the image charge \( q' \) (at \( \frac{R^2}{d} \)) is:
   \[
   r = d - \frac{R^2}{d} = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}.
   \]

3. **Potential Energy Between \( q \) and \( q' \)**:  
   The potential energy \( U \) between two point charges is given by:
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k q q'}{r}.
   \]
   Substituting \( q' = -\frac{R q}{d} \) and \( r = \frac{d^2 - R^2}{d} \):
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k q \left(-\frac{R q}{d}\right)}{\frac{d^2 - R^2}{d}}.
   \]

4. **Simplification**:  
   Simplify the expression:
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{-k R q^2}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]

5. **Final Expression**:  
   The net potential energy of the system is:
   \[
   U = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k R q^2}{d^2 - R^2}.
   \]

### Comparison with Options:
- **Option A**: \( U = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k q^2 d}{d^2 + R^2} \)  
  This does not match the derived expression.
  
- **Option B**: \( U = -\frac{k q^2 d}{d^2 - R^2} \)  
  This does not match the derived expression.
  
- **Option C**: \( U = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k q^2 R^2}{d^2 - R^2} \)  
  This does not match the derived expression.
  
- **Option D**: \( U = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{k q^2 R}{d^2 - R^2} \)  
  This matches the derived expression.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option D**.
