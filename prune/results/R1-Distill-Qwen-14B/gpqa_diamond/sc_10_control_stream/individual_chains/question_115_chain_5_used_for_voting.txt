Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again and break it down step by step. 

So, the setup is that an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis but in opposite directions. The electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce photons. Since both are moving, the system's momentum should be conserved. Because energy and momentum are conserved, the photons' momenta should add up in a way that matches the initial total momentum.

Wait, the positron is the antimatter counterpart of the electron, right? So when they meet, they annihilate into energy, which in this case is two photons. The problem states that both photons have the same energy. 

Let me think about the initial momenta. The positron and electron are moving in opposite directions. But their velocities are different because their Lorentz factors are different. The Lorentz factor gamma is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But for the momentum, I can calculate it as gamma * m * v. Since the positron and electron have the same mass (but opposite charges), their momenta will depend on their velocities and gamma factors.

Wait, but the electron is moving to the right (from the left), and the positron is moving to the left (from the right), so their momenta are in opposite directions. So the total initial momentum is the sum of the two, but since they are opposite, I need to be careful with the signs.

Let me denote the electron's momentum as p_e and the positron's as p_p. Since they are moving towards each other, their momenta are in opposite directions. Let's assume the electron is moving in the positive x-direction. Then the positron is moving in the negative x-direction.

So the total initial momentum would be p_e (right) + p_p (left). Wait, but p_p is the positron's momentum. Since the positron is moving left, its momentum is negative. So, in vector terms, the initial total momentum is p_e (right) minus p_p (since p_p is moving left, it's positive if direction is considered, but wait, wait. Wait, no. Let me correct that. The direction matters in the sign. So, if I take right as positive, the positron's momentum is negative. So, the initial total momentum P_initial is p_e (right, positive) plus p_p (left, so negative). So P_initial = p_e - p_p.

Wait, but wait. The positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is to the left. So in terms of momentum, its direction is negative x. So when calculating the total momentum, it's electron's momentum (right, positive) plus positron's momentum (left, negative).

Hmm, but the positron's momentum is gamma_p * m_e * v_p. But since v_p is to the left, it's negative. So maybe I should model this as vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the magnitudes and then sum as vectors.

So, let's compute each particle's momentum.

Electron: gamma_e =4. So gamma_e =4. Its velocity v_e can be found from gamma, but maybe I don't need the exact velocity. For momentum, p = gamma * m_e * v.

Wait, but to compute p, I can write p = gamma * m_e * v. Alternatively, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and if I write v in terms of beta (beta = v/c), then gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). Also, since p = gamma m v = gamma m beta c. So p = gamma beta m c.

But wait, for each particle, their beta is v/c. So for the electron, p_e = gamma_e * beta_e * m_e * c. Similarly for the positron, p_p = gamma_p * beta_p * m_e * c.

But to find beta, I can use gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). So for each particle, beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/(4)^2) )= sqrt(1-1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682 c.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me compute beta_e and beta_p.

Gamma_e =4:
beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_e)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

Gamma_p =2:
beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/(4)) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So, the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * beta_e * m_e c = 4 * (sqrt(15)/4) * m_e c = sqrt(15) m_e c.

Similarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * beta_p * m_e c = 2 * (sqrt(3)/2) m_e c = sqrt(3) m_e c.

Wait, but wait. The positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is in the negative x-direction. So, in terms of vectors, the electron's momentum is +sqrt(15) m_e c (right), and the positron's is -sqrt(3) m_e c (left). So the total initial momentum is p_e (electron) + p_p (positron) = sqrt(15) m_e c - sqrt(3) m_e c.

Wait, wait no. Because the positron is moving left, its momentum is negative. So the initial momentum is (sqrt(15) m_e c) [from electron] + (– sqrt(3) m_e c) [from positron]. So the total is (sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)) m_e c.

But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is negative. So when calculating momentum, it's (gamma_p) * m * v. Since v is negative, the momentum is negative.

But perhaps I should consider the direction in the signs. So the electron's p is positive, the positron's is negative. So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left) = +p_e – p_p.

Wait, no. Because the positron is moving left, p_p is the magnitude, but direction is left. So the total initial momentum is p_e (right) minus p_p (since the positron's momentum is to the left).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me rephrase. The electron is moving to the right (let's say positive x), so its momentum is +p_e. The positron is moving to the left (negative x), so its momentum is –p_p, because p_p is its magnitude. So the total initial momentum is p_e – p_p.

Wait, but wait no. Because the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so it's - p_p (since p_p is the magnitude). So the total is p_e (positive) + (- p_p) = p_e - p_p.

Yes, correct. So p_initial = p_e - p_p.

Now, substituting the values, since p_e = sqrt(15) m_e c and p_p = sqrt(3) m_e c.

So p_initial = sqrt(15) m_e c – sqrt(3) m_e c = [ sqrt(15) – sqrt(3) ] m_e c.

Hmm, let me compute that numerically. sqrt(15) is approximately 3.87298, sqrt(3) is about 1.73205. So 3.87298 – 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093 m_e c.

So the total initial momentum is approximately 2.14093 m_e c in the positive x-direction.

Now, after the annihilation, we have two photons. Let me denote their momenta as p1 and p2.

Since photons carry momentum, and their direction is given, one is upper-right (so in the first quadrant) and the other is lower-right (fourth quadrant), but both in the right direction. Wait, but the problem says one is upper-right, another lower-right. So both are moving in the right (positive x) direction, but one has positive y component and the other has negative y component.

Wait, but wait, the initial momentum was in the positive x-direction. So the photons must have a net momentum in the positive x-direction.

The problem states that both photons have the same energy. Energy of a photon is E = h f = pc, where p is the magnitude of the photon's momentum.

So since both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes of momentum are the same. So |p1| = |p2| = p.

But wait, photons are massless and their momentum is a vector. So each photon will have a momentum vector in some direction. Since both have the same energy, their momenta have the same magnitude.

So the total momentum after annihilation is p1 + p2. This must equal the initial total momentum, which is [sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)] m_e c in the positive x-direction. Let's call this P_initial.

So, the photons' momenta must add up to P_initial.

Each photon's momentum can be written in terms of their direction. Let me denote the angles each photon makes with the x-axis. Let's say photon 1 makes an angle theta above the x-axis (upper-right), and photon 2 makes an angle phi below the x-axis (lower-right). But since they're symmetric in some way, maybe phi is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign?

Wait, the problem says the directions are upper-right and lower-right. So each photon is moving to the right, but one upwards, the other downwards. So their momenta are in the first and fourth quadrants.

But their energies are the same, so their magnitudes of momentum are the same. Let me denote each photon's momentum as p1 and p2, each with magnitude p.

The momentum vectors are:

p1 = p * (cos(theta), sin(theta)) 
p2 = p * (cos(phi), -sin(phi)) 

Wait, wait. Because if phi is the angle below the x-axis, then the y-component is negative. So if photon 2 is moving lower-right, its angle with the x-axis is -phi, so sin is negative. Alternatively, I can model the y-component as negative for photon 2.

But I'm not sure if the angles are symmetrical. Since the problem states that both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes are the same. But their directions are such that the resultant momentum is along the x-axis (since initial momentum is along x). So the sum of their y-components must be zero, and the sum of their x-components must equal P_initial.

Wait, the sum of their y-components must be zero because the initial system has no momentum in the y-direction. So the total y momentum after collision must be zero.

So, let's write that:

p1_y + p2_y = 0

Which is:

p * sin(theta) + p * (- sin(phi)) = 0

So, p (sin(theta) - sin(phi)) = 0

Since p is not zero, sin(theta) = sin(phi). Now, theta is the angle above the x-axis, and phi is the angle below. So sin(theta) = sin(phi) implies that either theta = phi, which would mean same direction (but they are going in opposite y directions), or theta = 180 - phi, but that would imply they are in opposite quadrants. Wait, no. Wait, sin(theta) = sin(phi) could also mean that theta = phi, but that would require that the sines are equal. Alternatively, theta = 180 - phi, but that would be if the angles are in the opposite direction.

Wait, but in this case, the two photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, so their angles are theta and -theta, perhaps. Because, for example, if one is at +theta degrees, the other is at -theta degrees.

Wait, but wait, if the two photons are symmetric about the x-axis, their y-components will cancel each other. So theta and phi could be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So phi = -theta.

Wait, but the problem says the directions are upper-right and lower-right, but not necessarily symmetric. Hmm, but the only way their y-components cancel is if they are symmetric, because otherwise their y-components won't cancel.

Wait, but if they are symmetric, then the sum of y-components would be zero. So the angles are theta and -theta. So sin(theta) = sin(-theta) = -sin(theta), so p1_y = p sin(theta), p2_y = p sin(-theta) = -p sin(theta). So sum is zero.

But wait, the problem states that one is upper-right, another lower-right. So that suggests that their angles are theta and (360 - theta), but in terms of direction, maybe 180 - theta and theta, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, when moving in lower-right, the angle could be measured clockwise from the x-axis. So if one is at angle theta above the x-axis, the other is theta below. So in terms of their y-components, their signs are opposite.

So, for the y-components to sum to zero, we must have that sin(theta) = sin(phi), but since their directions are opposite, phi is -theta.

So, p1_y = p sin(theta), p2_y = p sin(-theta) = -p sin(theta).

So sum is zero, which satisfies the y-momentum conservation.

Now, the x-components of the photons' momenta must add up to the initial momentum P_initial.

So, the sum of x-components:

p1_x + p2_x = P_initial

Which is:

p cos(theta) + p cos(phi) = P_initial

But since phi is -theta, because of the symmetry, this becomes:

p [cos(theta) + cos(-theta)] = P_initial

But cos is even, so cos(-theta) = cos(theta). So:

p [cos(theta) + cos(theta)] = P_initial

Which is 2 p cos(theta) = P_initial

So, 2 p cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)] m_e c.

But wait, I think earlier I found that P_initial is (sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)) m_e c. Let me compute that.

Wait, what's the exact value? Let me compute sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) numerically. sqrt(15)≈3.87298, sqrt(3)≈1.73205. So 3.87298 – 1.73205 ≈2.14093 m_e c.

So, 2 p cos(theta) = 2.14093 m_e c.

But each photon's energy E is the same. Since E = pc, and E is the same for both photons, their magnitudes of momentum are the same, p.

Wait no, E = pc since for photons, E = |p| c. So each photon has E = p c, because p is the magnitude. So both have the same E, so same p.

So, the equation is 2 p cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)) m_e c.

But I don't know what p is yet. Let me think about the total energy.

The initial total energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.

The energy of a particle is gamma m c². So the electron's energy is gamma_e m_e c² =4 m_e c², and the positron's energy is gamma_p m_e c² = 2 m_e c². So total initial energy is 4 + 2 =6 m_e c².

This energy must be equal to the sum of the energies of the two photons. Each photon has energy E, so 2 E =6 m_e c². So E=3 m_e c².

But E = p c, so p = E / c =3 m_e c² / c =3 m_e c.

So p=3 m_e c.

So, substituting back into the momentum equation:

2 * (3 m_e c) * cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)) m_e c

Simplify:

6 m_e c cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)) m_e c

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)

So cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)) /6

Let me compute that numerically.

sqrt(15)=3.87298, sqrt(3)=1.73205.

So numerator: 3.87298 – 1.73205 ≈2.14093.

2.14093 /6 ≈0.35682.

So cos(theta)=0.35682.

What's the angle theta where cos(theta)=0.35682?

Well, cos(60) is 0.5, cos(70)≈0.3420. Our value is 0.3568, which is between 60 and 70 degrees. Let me compute.

Using a calculator, cos(theta) =0.35682.

So theta ≈acos(0.35682) ≈69.6 degrees, approximately 70 degrees.

Wait, but wait, wait. The question is asking for the angle between the two photons. So each photon is at theta and -theta, so the angle between them would be 2 theta.

Wait, no. Because one is at +theta, the other at -theta. So the angle between them is theta - (-theta) =2 theta.

So the angle between the two photons is 2 theta.

Wait, but wait. Photon 1 is at theta above x-axis, photon 2 at theta below x-axis. So the angle between them is theta - (-theta)= 2 theta.

So if theta is about 69.6 degrees, then the angle between them is approximately 139.2 degrees, which is about 139 degrees. Looking at the options, option C is 138, which is close to this value.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Compute cos(theta)=0.35682.

Using a calculator, let me compute the exact value.

cos(theta)=0.35682. The angle is in the first quadrant.

Using a calculator function: arccos(0.35682).

Let me calculate it more precisely.

Using a calculator, let me find the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute using exact expressions.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the initial momentum. Let me double-check.

Wait, the initial momentum is p_initial = p_e – p_p.

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Wait, earlier I used a different approach, where p_e = gamma_e * beta_e * m_e c, right?

Wait, let me recompute.

p_e = gamma_e * beta_e * m_e c.

Gamma_e is 4, beta_e is sqrt(15)/4 ≈0.9682.

So p_e =4 * (sqrt(15)/4) * m_e c = sqrt(15) m_e c.

p_p is gamma_p * beta_p * m_e c. Gamma_p is 2, beta_p is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So p_p =2 * (sqrt(3)/2) m_e c = sqrt(3) m_e c.

So p_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left). Wait, but wait, the positron is moving left, so p_p is in the negative direction. So p_initial = p_e – p_p = sqrt(15) m_e c – sqrt(3) m_e c.

Which is the same as [sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)] m_e c.

This equals approximately 2.14093 m_e c.

So, earlier substitution is correct.

So, cos(theta)= [ (sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)) /6 ].

Let me compute that fraction exactly.

Compute (sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)) = approx 3.87298 – 1.73205 =2.14093.

So 2.14093 /6 ≈0.35682.

So theta=acos(0.35682)= about 69 degrees.

Wait, more accurately, using a calculator:

acos(0.35682)= approximately 69.1 degrees.

So the angle between the photons is 2 * 69.1 =138.2 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138, which fits.

So the angle is approximately 138 degrees.

To solve the problem, we analyze the situation using conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons of equal energy. The photons move in opposite vertical directions (upper-right and lower-right), and we aim to find the angle between them.

### Step 1: Initial Momentum
The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor \( \gamma_e = 4 \), and the positron moves to the left with \( \gamma_p = 2 \). The momentum of each particle is given by:

\[
p = \gamma \beta m_e c
\]

where \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \). For the electron:
\[
\beta_e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{15}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}
\]
\[
p_e = \gamma_e \beta_e m_e c = 4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} m_e c = \sqrt{15} m_e c
\]

For the positron:
\[
\beta_p = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
\[
p_p = \gamma_p \beta_p m_e c = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} m_e c = \sqrt{3} m_e c
\]

The total initial momentum is:
\[
P_{\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = \sqrt{15} m_e c - \sqrt{3} m_e c = (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) m_e c
\]

### Step 2: Energy Conservation
The total energy of the system before annihilation is:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2
\]

After annihilation, the total energy is shared equally between the two photons:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{initial}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2
\]

Since \( E = pc \) for photons, the magnitude of momentum for each photon is:
\[
p = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c
\]

### Step 3: Momentum Conservation
The photons move in opposite vertical directions (upper-right and lower-right), making angles \( \theta \) and \( -\theta \) with the x-axis. Their momentum vectors are:
\[
\vec{p}_1 = p (\cos\theta, \sin\theta), \quad \vec{p}_2 = p (\cos\theta, -\sin\theta)
\]

The total momentum after annihilation is:
\[
\vec{P}_{\text{final}} = \vec{p}_1 + \vec{p}_2 = (2p \cos\theta, 0)
\]

Equating this to the initial momentum:
\[
2p \cos\theta = (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) m_e c
\]

Substitute \( p = 3 m_e c \):
\[
2(3 m_e c) \cos\theta = (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) m_e c
\]
\[
6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}
\]
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \theta \)
Numerically:
\[
\sqrt{15} \approx 3.87298, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.73205
\]
\[
\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \approx 3.87298 - 1.73205 = 2.14093
\]
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{2.14093}{6} \approx 0.35682
\]
\[
\theta = \arccos(0.35682) \approx 69.1^\circ
\]

### Step 5: Angle Between Photons
The photons are symmetric about the x-axis, with angles \( \theta \) and \( -\theta \). The angle between them is:
\[
\phi = 2\theta \approx 2 \cdot 69.1^\circ = 138.2^\circ
\]

### Final Answer
The angle between the directions of the photons is approximately \( 138^\circ \).

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again and break it down step by step. 

So, the setup is that an electron and a positron are moving along the horizontal axis but in opposite directions. The electron is moving from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4, and the positron is moving from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured. One is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm, okay. So, I remember that when particles like electrons and positrons annihilate, they produce photons. Since both are moving, the system's momentum should be conserved. Because energy and momentum are conserved, the photons' momenta should add up in a way that matches the initial total momentum.

Wait, the positron is the antimatter counterpart of the electron, right? So when they meet, they annihilate into energy, which in this case is two photons. The problem states that both photons have the same energy. 

Let me think about the initial momenta. The positron and electron are moving in opposite directions. But their velocities are different because their Lorentz factors are different. The Lorentz factor gamma is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But for the momentum, I can calculate it as gamma * m * v. Since the positron and electron have the same mass (but opposite charges), their momenta will depend on their velocities and gamma factors.

Wait, but the electron is moving to the right (from the left), and the positron is moving to the left (from the right), so their momenta are in opposite directions. So the total initial momentum is the sum of the two, but since they are opposite, I need to be careful with the signs.

Let me denote the electron's momentum as p_e and the positron's as p_p. Since they are moving towards each other, their momenta are in opposite directions. Let's assume the electron is moving in the positive x-direction. Then the positron is moving in the negative x-direction.

So the total initial momentum would be p_e (right) + p_p (left). Wait, but p_p is the positron's momentum. Since the positron is moving left, its momentum is negative. So, in vector terms, the initial total momentum is p_e (right) minus p_p (since p_p is moving left, it's positive if direction is considered, but wait, wait. Wait, no. Let me correct that. The direction matters in the sign. So, if I take right as positive, the positron's momentum is negative. So, the initial total momentum P_initial is p_e (right, positive) plus p_p (left, so negative). So P_initial = p_e - p_p.

Wait, but wait. The positron is moving from the right, so its velocity is to the left. So in terms of momentum, its direction is negative x. So when calculating the total momentum, it's electron's momentum (right, positive) plus positron's momentum (left, negative).

Hmm, but the positron's momentum is gamma_p * m_e * v_p. But since v_p is to the left, it's negative. So maybe I should model this as vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the magnitudes and then sum as vectors.

So, let's compute each particle's momentum.

Electron: gamma_e =4. So gamma_e =4. Its velocity v_e can be found from gamma, but maybe I don't need the exact velocity. For momentum, p = gamma * m_e * v.

Wait, but to compute p, I can write p = gamma * m_e * v. Alternatively, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and if I write v in terms of beta (beta = v/c), then gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). Also, since p = gamma m v = gamma m beta c. So p = gamma beta m c.

But wait, for each particle, their beta is v/c. So for the electron, p_e = gamma_e * beta_e * m_e * c. Similarly for the positron, p_p = gamma_p * beta_p * m_e * c.

But to find beta, I can use gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²). So for each particle, beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/(4)^2) )= sqrt(1-1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682 c.

Wait, but wait, wait. Let me compute beta_e and beta_p.

Gamma_e =4:
beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/(gamma_e)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

Gamma_p =2:
beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/(4)) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So, the momentum of the electron is p_e = gamma_e * beta_e * m_e c = 4 * (sqrt(15)/4) * m_e c = sqrt(15) m_e c.

Similarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * beta_p * m_e c = 2 * (sqrt(3)/2) m_e c = sqrt(3) m_e c.

Wait, but wait. The positron is moving to the left, so its momentum is in the negative x-direction. So, in terms of vectors, the electron's momentum is +sqrt(15) m_e c (right), and the positron's is -sqrt(3) m_e c (left). So the total initial momentum is p_e (electron) + p_p (positron) = sqrt(15) m_e c - sqrt(3) m_e c.

Wait, wait no. Because the positron is moving left, its momentum is negative. So the initial momentum is (sqrt(15) m_e c) [from electron] + (– sqrt(3) m_e c) [from positron]. So the total is (sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)) m_e c.

But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. The positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is negative. So when calculating momentum, it's (gamma_p) * m * v. Since v is negative, the momentum is negative.

But perhaps I should consider the direction in the signs. So the electron's p is positive, the positron's is negative. So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left) = +p_e – p_p.

Wait, no. Because the positron is moving left, p_p is the magnitude, but direction is left. So the total initial momentum is p_e (right) minus p_p (since the positron's momentum is to the left).

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me rephrase. The electron is moving to the right (let's say positive x), so its momentum is +p_e. The positron is moving to the left (negative x), so its momentum is –p_p, because p_p is its magnitude. So the total initial momentum is p_e – p_p.

Wait, but wait no. Because the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so it's - p_p (since p_p is the magnitude). So the total is p_e (positive) + (- p_p) = p_e - p_p.

Yes, correct. So p_initial = p_e - p_p.

Now, substituting the values, since p_e = sqrt(15) m_e c and p_p = sqrt(3) m_e c.

So p_initial = sqrt(15) m_e c – sqrt(3) m_e c = [ sqrt(15) – sqrt(3) ] m_e c.

Hmm, let me compute that numerically. sqrt(15) is approximately 3.87298, sqrt(3) is about 1.73205. So 3.87298 – 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093 m_e c.

So the total initial momentum is approximately 2.14093 m_e c in the positive x-direction.

Now, after the annihilation, we have two photons. Let me denote their momenta as p1 and p2.

Since photons carry momentum, and their direction is given, one is upper-right (so in the first quadrant) and the other is lower-right (fourth quadrant), but both in the right direction. Wait, but the problem says one is upper-right, another lower-right. So both are moving in the right (positive x) direction, but one has positive y component and the other has negative y component.

Wait, but wait, the initial momentum was in the positive x-direction. So the photons must have a net momentum in the positive x-direction.

The problem states that both photons have the same energy. Energy of a photon is E = h f = pc, where p is the magnitude of the photon's momentum.

So since both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes of momentum are the same. So |p1| = |p2| = p.

But wait, photons are massless and their momentum is a vector. So each photon will have a momentum vector in some direction. Since both have the same energy, their momenta have the same magnitude.

So the total momentum after annihilation is p1 + p2. This must equal the initial total momentum, which is [sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)] m_e c in the positive x-direction. Let's call this P_initial.

So, the photons' momenta must add up to P_initial.

Each photon's momentum can be written in terms of their direction. Let me denote the angles each photon makes with the x-axis. Let's say photon 1 makes an angle theta above the x-axis (upper-right), and photon 2 makes an angle phi below the x-axis (lower-right). But since they're symmetric in some way, maybe phi is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign?

Wait, the problem says the directions are upper-right and lower-right. So each photon is moving to the right, but one upwards, the other downwards. So their momenta are in the first and fourth quadrants.

But their energies are the same, so their magnitudes of momentum are the same. Let me denote each photon's momentum as p1 and p2, each with magnitude p.

The momentum vectors are:

p1 = p * (cos(theta), sin(theta)) 
p2 = p * (cos(phi), -sin(phi)) 

Wait, wait. Because if phi is the angle below the x-axis, then the y-component is negative. So if photon 2 is moving lower-right, its angle with the x-axis is -phi, so sin is negative. Alternatively, I can model the y-component as negative for photon 2.

But I'm not sure if the angles are symmetrical. Since the problem states that both photons have the same energy, their magnitudes are the same. But their directions are such that the resultant momentum is along the x-axis (since initial momentum is along x). So the sum of their y-components must be zero, and the sum of their x-components must equal P_initial.

Wait, the sum of their y-components must be zero because the initial system has no momentum in the y-direction. So the total y momentum after collision must be zero.

So, let's write that:

p1_y + p2_y = 0

Which is:

p * sin(theta) + p * (- sin(phi)) = 0

So, p (sin(theta) - sin(phi)) = 0

Since p is not zero, sin(theta) = sin(phi). Now, theta is the angle above the x-axis, and phi is the angle below. So sin(theta) = sin(phi) implies that either theta = phi, which would mean same direction (but they are going in opposite y directions), or theta = 180 - phi, but that would imply they are in opposite quadrants. Wait, no. Wait, sin(theta) = sin(phi) could also mean that theta = phi, but that would require that the sines are equal. Alternatively, theta = 180 - phi, but that would be if the angles are in the opposite direction.

Wait, but in this case, the two photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, so their angles are theta and -theta, perhaps. Because, for example, if one is at +theta degrees, the other is at -theta degrees.

Wait, but wait, if the two photons are symmetric about the x-axis, their y-components will cancel each other. So theta and phi could be equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So phi = -theta.

Wait, but the problem says the directions are upper-right and lower-right, but not necessarily symmetric. Hmm, but the only way their y-components cancel is if they are symmetric, because otherwise their y-components won't cancel.

Wait, but if they are symmetric, then the sum of y-components would be zero. So the angles are theta and -theta. So sin(theta) = sin(-theta) = -sin(theta), so p1_y = p sin(theta), p2_y = p sin(-theta) = -p sin(theta). So sum is zero.

But wait, the problem states that one is upper-right, another lower-right. So that suggests that their angles are theta and (360 - theta), but in terms of direction, maybe 180 - theta and theta, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no, when moving in lower-right, the angle could be measured clockwise from the x-axis. So if one is at angle theta above the x-axis, the other is theta below. So in terms of their y-components, their signs are opposite.

So, for the y-components to sum to zero, we must have that sin(theta) = sin(phi), but since their directions are opposite, phi is -theta.

So, p1_y = p sin(theta), p2_y = p sin(-theta) = -p sin(theta).

So sum is zero, which satisfies the y-momentum conservation.

Now, the x-components of the photons' momenta must add up to the initial momentum P_initial.

So, the sum of x-components:

p1_x + p2_x = P_initial

Which is:

p cos(theta) + p cos(phi) = P_initial

But since phi is -theta, because of the symmetry, this becomes:

p [cos(theta) + cos(-theta)] = P_initial

But cos is even, so cos(-theta) = cos(theta). So:

p [cos(theta) + cos(theta)] = P_initial

Which is 2 p cos(theta) = P_initial

So, 2 p cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)] m_e c.

But wait, I think earlier I found that P_initial is (sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)) m_e c. Let me compute that.

Wait, what's the exact value? Let me compute sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) numerically. sqrt(15)≈3.87298, sqrt(3)≈1.73205. So 3.87298 – 1.73205 ≈2.14093 m_e c.

So, 2 p cos(theta) = 2.14093 m_e c.

But each photon's energy E is the same. Since E = pc, and E is the same for both photons, their magnitudes of momentum are the same, p.

Wait no, E = pc since for photons, E = |p| c. So each photon has E = p c, because p is the magnitude. So both have the same E, so same p.

So, the equation is 2 p cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)) m_e c.

But I don't know what p is yet. Let me think about the total energy.

The initial total energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.

The energy of a particle is gamma m c². So the electron's energy is gamma_e m_e c² =4 m_e c², and the positron's energy is gamma_p m_e c² = 2 m_e c². So total initial energy is 4 + 2 =6 m_e c².

This energy must be equal to the sum of the energies of the two photons. Each photon has energy E, so 2 E =6 m_e c². So E=3 m_e c².

But E = p c, so p = E / c =3 m_e c² / c =3 m_e c.

So p=3 m_e c.

So, substituting back into the momentum equation:

2 * (3 m_e c) * cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)) m_e c

Simplify:

6 m_e c cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)) m_e c

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)

So cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)) /6

Let me compute that numerically.

sqrt(15)=3.87298, sqrt(3)=1.73205.

So numerator: 3.87298 – 1.73205 ≈2.14093.

2.14093 /6 ≈0.35682.

So cos(theta)=0.35682.

What's the angle theta where cos(theta)=0.35682?

Well, cos(60) is 0.5, cos(70)≈0.3420. Our value is 0.3568, which is between 60 and 70 degrees. Let me compute.

Using a calculator, cos(theta) =0.35682.

So theta ≈acos(0.35682) ≈69.6 degrees, approximately 70 degrees.

Wait, but wait, wait. The question is asking for the angle between the two photons. So each photon is at theta and -theta, so the angle between them would be 2 theta.

Wait, no. Because one is at +theta, the other at -theta. So the angle between them is theta - (-theta) =2 theta.

So the angle between the two photons is 2 theta.

Wait, but wait. Photon 1 is at theta above x-axis, photon 2 at theta below x-axis. So the angle between them is theta - (-theta)= 2 theta.

So if theta is about 69.6 degrees, then the angle between them is approximately 139.2 degrees, which is about 139 degrees. Looking at the options, option C is 138, which is close to this value.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Compute cos(theta)=0.35682.

Using a calculator, let me compute the exact value.

cos(theta)=0.35682. The angle is in the first quadrant.

Using a calculator function: arccos(0.35682).

Let me calculate it more precisely.

Using a calculator, let me find the exact value.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute using exact expressions.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the initial momentum. Let me double-check.

Wait, the initial momentum is p_initial = p_e – p_p.

p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Wait, earlier I used a different approach, where p_e = gamma_e * beta_e * m_e c, right?

Wait, let me recompute.

p_e = gamma_e * beta_e * m_e c.

Gamma_e is 4, beta_e is sqrt(15)/4 ≈0.9682.

So p_e =4 * (sqrt(15)/4) * m_e c = sqrt(15) m_e c.

p_p is gamma_p * beta_p * m_e c. Gamma_p is 2, beta_p is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So p_p =2 * (sqrt(3)/2) m_e c = sqrt(3) m_e c.

So p_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left). Wait, but wait, the positron is moving left, so p_p is in the negative direction. So p_initial = p_e – p_p = sqrt(15) m_e c – sqrt(3) m_e c.

Which is the same as [sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)] m_e c.

This equals approximately 2.14093 m_e c.

So, earlier substitution is correct.

So, cos(theta)= [ (sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)) /6 ].

Let me compute that fraction exactly.

Compute (sqrt(15) – sqrt(3)) = approx 3.87298 – 1.73205 =2.14093.

So 2.14093 /6 ≈0.35682.

So theta=acos(0.35682)= about 69 degrees.

Wait, more accurately, using a calculator:

acos(0.35682)= approximately 69.1 degrees.

So the angle between the photons is 2 * 69.1 =138.2 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138, which fits.

So the angle is approximately 138 degrees.


To solve the problem, we analyze the situation using conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron annihilate, producing two photons of equal energy. The photons move in opposite vertical directions (upper-right and lower-right), and we aim to find the angle between them.

### Step 1: Initial Momentum
The electron moves to the right with a Lorentz factor \( \gamma_e = 4 \), and the positron moves to the left with \( \gamma_p = 2 \). The momentum of each particle is given by:

\[
p = \gamma \beta m_e c
\]

where \( \beta = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} \). For the electron:
\[
\beta_e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{15}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}
\]
\[
p_e = \gamma_e \beta_e m_e c = 4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} m_e c = \sqrt{15} m_e c
\]

For the positron:
\[
\beta_p = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
\[
p_p = \gamma_p \beta_p m_e c = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} m_e c = \sqrt{3} m_e c
\]

The total initial momentum is:
\[
P_{\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = \sqrt{15} m_e c - \sqrt{3} m_e c = (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) m_e c
\]

### Step 2: Energy Conservation
The total energy of the system before annihilation is:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2
\]

After annihilation, the total energy is shared equally between the two photons:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{initial}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2
\]

Since \( E = pc \) for photons, the magnitude of momentum for each photon is:
\[
p = \frac{E}{c} = \frac{3 m_e c^2}{c} = 3 m_e c
\]

### Step 3: Momentum Conservation
The photons move in opposite vertical directions (upper-right and lower-right), making angles \( \theta \) and \( -\theta \) with the x-axis. Their momentum vectors are:
\[
\vec{p}_1 = p (\cos\theta, \sin\theta), \quad \vec{p}_2 = p (\cos\theta, -\sin\theta)
\]

The total momentum after annihilation is:
\[
\vec{P}_{\text{final}} = \vec{p}_1 + \vec{p}_2 = (2p \cos\theta, 0)
\]

Equating this to the initial momentum:
\[
2p \cos\theta = (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) m_e c
\]

Substitute \( p = 3 m_e c \):
\[
2(3 m_e c) \cos\theta = (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) m_e c
\]
\[
6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}
\]
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( \theta \)
Numerically:
\[
\sqrt{15} \approx 3.87298, \quad \sqrt{3} \approx 1.73205
\]
\[
\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \approx 3.87298 - 1.73205 = 2.14093
\]
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{2.14093}{6} \approx 0.35682
\]
\[
\theta = \arccos(0.35682) \approx 69.1^\circ
\]

### Step 5: Angle Between Photons
The photons are symmetric about the x-axis, with angles \( \theta \) and \( -\theta \). The angle between them is:
\[
\phi = 2\theta \approx 2 \cdot 69.1^\circ = 138.2^\circ
\]

### Final Answer
The angle between the directions of the photons is approximately \( 138^\circ \).
