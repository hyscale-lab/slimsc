Okay, so I have this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I've heard of cyclotrons before, but synchrocyclotrons are a bit different. Let me think about what I remember.

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? Maybe it's accelerated twice in each revolution? Or perhaps it's something else about the setup.

The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. Oh wait, I think that in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage changes to match the proton's changing frequency as it gains energy. Because in a regular cyclotron, the frequency is fixed, but in a synchrocyclotron, it's adjusted to keep the resonance condition.

The data given: Φ0 is π/4, and U0 is 190 kV. So the initial phase shift is 45 degrees.

I'm trying to figure out how to find the number of revolutions the proton makes. I remember that in cyclotrons, the time for each revolution is related to the magnetic field and the velocity. The formula I recall is T = (2π m)/(qB), but that's when the frequency is fixed. In a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases as the particle gains energy? Or maybe the frequency of the accelerating voltage changes so that the phase of the voltage matches the phase of the particle's motion.

Wait, the key here is probably the resonance condition for the synchrocyclotron. The condition is that the angular frequency ω of the proton's motion equals the angular frequency of the accelerating voltage. So ω = 2πν(α), where ν is the frequency and α is the time variable.

But how does the proton's angular frequency change as it gains energy? Oh right, the proton's mass increases relativistically. So the momentum p is related to the magnetic field B by p = qBr, where r is the radius of the orbit. The energy of the proton is T = (p² c²)/(2m), but I might have to adjust for relativistic effects.

Wait, the problem states that the proton is injected with negligible kinetic energy, so initially, it's non-relativistic. But when it gains a lot of energy, relativistic effects become significant.

Wait, the kinetic energy is 950 MeV. Let me check what that means in terms of mass. The rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So 950 MeV is almost ten times the rest mass. So definitely relativistic.

The main equation for the synchrocyclotron is probably the energy gained per revolution. Each time the proton goes around, it gains some energy from the voltage. Considering that the voltage is applied in a way that the phase matches, each half-cycle (since it's cosine) might give a kick to the proton.

Wait, the accelerating voltage is sinusoidal, so each time the voltage is at its peak, the proton might gain energy. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, the number of revolutions might be determined by the total energy gained divided by the energy per revolution. Because each revolution, the proton gains some energy from the voltage.

Let me think about the energy gained. The voltage is U(t), so the energy per revolution might be related to the peak voltage times some factor.

Wait, the energy gain per revolution in a cyclotron is approximately q * U0, where q is the charge. But wait, is that correct? Or does it depend on the phase?

Wait, in a regular cyclotron, the maximum energy gain per half-cycle is qU0. So for each full cycle (two half-cycles), the proton gains 2qU0. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but this is a synchrocyclotron, so maybe the energy per revolution isn't constant because the magnetic field changes. Hmm. Alternatively, the number of revolutions can be found using the time it takes to reach the desired energy, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is the sum over each revolution's energy gain. So, each revolution, the proton gains some energy, and we can sum that up until reaching 950 MeV.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this methodically.

The problem states that the proton is accelerated twice to reach T1=950 MeV. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe it's accelerated twice per revolution? Or perhaps it undergoes two acceleration events in total, but that seems unlikely for reaching such a high energy.

Wait, perhaps the main formula I should use is the relation between the number of revolutions N and the energy gained. In a synchrocyclotron, the total energy gained is the product of N and the energy per revolution.

The energy per revolution is approximately q*U0, but considering relativistic effects, the energy gain per revolution decreases as the proton's mass increases.

Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let me think about the energy gained per revolution.

The energy gain per revolution for a relativistic particle in a synchrocyclotron can be approximated by ΔT ≈ q U0 (γ)^{-1} }, but I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, maybe it's ΔT ≈ q U0, regardless of γ.

Wait, maybe the energy per revolution is given by q U0, but since the magnetic field is adjusted, the actual formula might be different. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the total energy.

Wait, the total energy is given as 950 MeV, so I need to find how many times the proton is accelerated by the voltage U0 to reach this.

Wait, but the voltage is U(t), which is time-dependent. But each time the voltage completes a cycle, the particle is given a certain energy boost.

Wait, perhaps the total number of revolutions N is equal to the total energy divided by the energy per revolution. So N = T1/(q U0 per revolution).

But what's the energy per revolution? Let me think. In a cyclotron, each time the electric field is applied, the particle is accelerated. For a full cycle, the field changes polarity, so the particle is accelerated twice per revolution? Or perhaps once per half-cycle.

Wait, the voltage is sinusoidal, so the electric field is applied once per cycle, but the proton is accelerated twice per cycle, once when the voltage is positive and once when it's negative, but perhaps they're in phase with the motion.

Wait, maybe each half-cycle (each π) of the voltage gives a kick to the particle. So, each full cycle (2π) provides two kicks, each adding q U0. So for each revolution, the proton gains 2 q U0 of energy? Or maybe just q U0 per revolution.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of the basics. In a cyclotron, the electric field is applied in the gap between the dees. The electric field alternates, and the timing is such that the proton is accelerated each time it crosses the gap. The time it takes for each revolution must match the period of the electric field.

In a regular cyclotron, the frequency is fixed, and this leads to a fixed maximum energy. In a synchrocyclotron, the frequency is varied to account for the relativistic increase in mass, allowing for higher energies.

So, the energy gain per revolution in a synchrocyclotron might be related to the product of the charge, the voltage, and some factor involving the Lorentz factor.

Wait, I found a formula in my notes. The energy per revolution in a synchrocyclotron is given by ΔE ≈ (e U0)/(gamma). But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, but in the problem, the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so initially gamma is about 1. As the proton gains energy, gamma increases.

Wait, the total energy is T = 950 MeV. The rest mass energy of a proton is about 938 MeV. So the total energy is about 950 + 938 ≈ 1888 MeV, making gamma ≈ 1888 / 938 ≈ 2.011.

Wait, but that can't be right because when the kinetic energy is 950 MeV, the total energy is 950 + 938 = 1888 MeV, so gamma is 1888 / 938 ≈ 2.011. So it's a bit more than twice the rest mass.

Hmm, so each revolution, the proton gains some energy. So the number of revolutions would be the total energy divided by the energy per revolution.

But what's the energy per revolution? Let's think about the cyclotron equation.

In a cyclotron, the time for each revolution is T = (2π m)/(q B). But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is increased as the proton gains energy to keep the frequency matched. So the resonance condition is q B(r) = gamma m_e e omega, where omega is the angular frequency of the electric field.

Wait, perhaps the energy per revolution is e U0. Because each time the voltage completes a half cycle, the proton is accelerated by e U0.

Wait, but in a regular cyclotron, the energy gained per full cycle is e U0, because the electric field alternates, providing acceleration on each half cycle.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again about the energy per revolution.

In a regular cyclotron, the maximum kinetic energy is given by K_max = (n e U0) where n is the number of revolutions. But that's when the frequency is fixed and the proton can't go relativistic. In a synchrocyclotron, since the magnetic field changes, the number of revolutions needed increases.

But in this problem, the voltage is applied as U(t) = U0 cos(2 pi nu(t) t + phi0).

Wait, the phase phi0 is pi/4, but I'm not sure if that affects the number of revolutions. Maybe it's to do with the timing of the acceleration.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions can be found using the relation between the energy and the voltage.

Wait, another approach: the total energy T is given by T = (gamma - 1) m c^2. So gamma is (T + m c^2)/(m c^2). For T=950 MeV, m c^2 is about 938 MeV. So gamma ≈ (950 + 938)/938 ≈ (1888)/938 ≈ 2.012.

Wait, so gamma is about 2.012. Then, the total number of revolutions N can be found using the relation N = (gamma m c^2) / (e U0). Because each revolution provides e U0 energy.

Wait, but wait, the energy per revolution is e U0 multiplied by some factors. Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is N times e U0. Because each revolution adds e U0 energy.

But if the initial energy is zero, then T ≈ N e U0.

Wait, in that case, N = T / (e U0). But let's compute that.

U0 is 190 kV, which is 190,000 volts. e is the elementary charge, about 1.6e-19 coulombs.

So e U0 = 1.6e-19 C * 1.9e5 V = 3.04e-14 J.

But 950 MeV is 950e6 eV. Each eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 950e6 eV = 950e6 * 1.6e-19 = 1.52e-11 J.

So N would be T / (e U0) = (1.52e-11 J) / (3.04e-14 J) ≈ 5000 revolutions.

Looking at the options, B is 5300. That's in the ballpark. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a factor of 2 because each revolution provides two energy kicks (positive and negative half cycles).

Wait, in a cyclotron, the proton is accelerated twice per revolution because the electric field changes direction each half cycle. So for each revolution, the proton gains 2 e U0.

Wait, but in that case, the energy per revolution would be 2 e U0.

Wait, let me recalculate. So T = N * 2 e U0.

So N = T/(2 e U0) = (950e6 eV) / (2 * 190e3 eV) ) = (950e6) / (380e3) = (950 * 1e6) / (380 * 1e3) ) = (950 * 1e3) / 380 = 950,000 / 380 ≈ 2500.

Hmm, 2500 is one of the options, option D.

But wait, earlier I thought that N would be around 5000, but that's without considering that each revolution gives two accelerations. So perhaps this approach is correct.

But wait, why am I considering two accelerations per revolution? Because in each revolution, the proton passes through the gap twice, once on each semicircle. So each half cycle provides a kick.

Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the acceleration might be applied once per revolution because the magnetic field is adjusted to match the frequency.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit conflicting information here. Let's think again.

In a cyclotron, the electric field is applied each time the proton crosses the gap between the dees. Each time it does that, it's accelerated. Since it crosses twice per revolution, it gets two accelerations per revolution. So each revolution, the proton gains 2 e U0 of energy.

So for the total energy T = 950 MeV, the number of revolutions N would be T/(2 e U0).

But wait, the initial energy is zero, and each revolution adds 2 e U0. So N = T / (2 e U0).

Wait, but the voltage is applied as U(t) = U0 cos(...), so each full cycle (2π) would be one revolution, and the proton is accelerated twice, as in each half-cycle.

So, let me compute N. T is 950 MeV. U0 is 190 kV. So in terms of eV, U0 is 190e3 V * e charge, which is 190e3 eV.

Each revolution gives 2 * U0 eV, so 2 * 190e3 = 380e3 eV per revolution.

So N = (950e6 eV) / (380e3 eV) = (950e6)/(380e3) = 950e3 / 380 ≈ 2500.

Wait, that brings us to option D: 2500.

But wait, some sources might say that in a synchrocyclotron, each revolution provides only a single acceleration because the phase is adjusted, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is the same as in the cyclotron case.

But according to this calculation, option D is 2500.

Wait, but let me check the data given. The initial phase phi0 is pi/4. Does that affect anything? Maybe not in terms of the number of revolutions, but perhaps in the timing of the acceleration.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual formula involves integrating the energy gain over time, considering the varying magnetic field. But that might be more complicated, and given the options, 2500 is an option, and I'm getting that from a straightforward approach.

But wait, wait a minute. The problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. Does that mean that each acceleration gives a certain energy? If two accelerations are needed per something, maybe per revolution.

Hmm, if the proton is accelerated twice as it goes around once, then each revolution gives two kicks, each of e U0. So the energy per revolution is 2 e U0. So the computation I did earlier would hold, leading to N=2500.

So the answer would be D) 2500.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between whether each revolution gives one or two energy gains. Let me think about it.

In a cyclotron, the electric field is applied in the gap, and each time the proton crosses the gap, it's accelerated. Since the proton does this twice per revolution, each revolution contributes two energy gains. So each revolution gives 2 e U0.

Therefore, for T=950 MeV, the number of revolutions N is 950e6 eV / (2 * 190e3 eV) )= (950e6)/(380e3) = (950e3)/(380) ≈ 2500.

So the answer should be D.

But wait, another approach: the time taken for each revolution is T = (2π m)/(gamma q B). But since the magnetic field is adjusted, the product qB is kept such that the resonance condition is maintained. I'm not sure how that affects the number of revolutions.

Wait, perhaps the energy per revolution isn't simply e U0, but a bit more involved. Because as the proton gains energy, its momentum increases, and the radius of the orbit increases. But the magnetic field is varied to keep the cyclotron frequency matching the applied voltage.

Hmm, but perhaps the total energy can be written as N * e U0, where N is the number of revolutions. But I'm not sure if this is the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is N ≈ (gamma m c^2)/(e U0). Let me compute that.

gamma is about 2.012, m c^2 is 938 MeV. So (2.012 *938 MeV) / (190e3 eV) ) = (1888.9 MeV) / (190e3 eV) )= (1888900e3 eV) / (190e3 eV) )= 1888900/190 ≈ 9941.57. That's about 9941, which isn't one of the options.

Hmm, that's not matching any option. So maybe that approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is given by the total energy divided by the energy per revolution, which in this case is (gamma - 1) m c^2 = 950 MeV.

So N = (gamma -1) m c^2 / (e U0 per revolution).

Wait, but if each revolution gives e U0 energy, then N = 950e6 eV / 190e3 eV = 5000.

But looking at the options, option B is 5300. Close but not exact. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase phi0 is involved in the calculation. Since phi0 is pi/4, maybe the effective energy gain per revolution is 190e3 * cos(phi0) ?

Wait, phi0 is the initial phase. So the maximum energy transfer might be affected by this phase. The maximum acceleration occurs when the electric field is at its maximum, so when cos(phi0 + 2 pi nu t) is 1. So perhaps the effective energy per revolution is U0 * cos(phi0) in some way.

Wait, but the initial phase is pi/4, which is 45 degrees. Cos(pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.707. So if each revolution's energy gain is U0 * cos(phi0), then the energy per revolution is 190e3 V * e * 0.707.

Wait, let me recalculate N:

N = T / (e U0 cos(phi0)) ) = 950e6 eV / (190e3 eV * 0.7071) ≈ 950e6 / (190e3 * 0.7071) 

Calculate denominator: 190e3 * 0.7071 ≈ 134,349 eV.

So N ≈ 950e6 / 134349 ≈ 950,000,000 / 134,349 ≈ 7084. That's not matching any options.

Alternatively, maybe the energy per revolution is U0 times the amplitude factor. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the initial approach. The number of revolutions is N = T / (e U0), considering each revolution provides e U0.

So T=950 MeV = 950e6 eV.

e U0 = 190e3 eV.

So N=950e6 / 190e3 = 950000 / 190 ≈ 5000.

Looking at the options, 5300 is option B, which is close. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the phase phi0 affects the number of revolutions because the timing of the acceleration is such that not every half-cycle contributes to a full energy gain. For example, if the phase is pi/4, the first acceleration might not be at the peak, so the effective energy per revolution is less.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial phase causes the first acceleration to be smaller, but the question says the kinetic energy is negligible, so the first acceleration might be the main factor.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: the number of revolutions is given by N = gamma m c^2/(e U0) ). Because each revolution provides e U0.

gamma is about 2.012, so N = (2.012 * 938e6 eV) / (190e3 eV) )= (2.012 * 938e6) / 190e3.

Calculate numerator: 2.012 * 938e6 ≈ 1.887e9 eV.

Divide by 190e3 eV: 1.887e9 / 1.9e5 ≈ 1.887e9 / 1.9e5 = (1.887 / 1.9) * 1e4 ≈ 0.993 * 1e4 ≈ 9930.

Again, not matching any option.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Another thought: perhaps the energy per revolution is (e U0) * (gamma_initial)/(gamma_final), but I'm not sure.

Wait, considering the initial gamma is 1 and final gamma is about 2, so the average gamma is 1.5. So energy per revolution would be e U0 / gamma_avg. So N = T * gamma_avg / (e U0).

So N = (950e6 eV) * 1.5 / (190e3 eV) )= (950e6 * 1.5) / 190e3.

Calculate: 950e6 *1.5 = 1.425e9 eV.

Divide by 190e3: 1.425e9 / 1.9e5 ≈ 7500.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is given by N = (gamma m c^2)/(e U0) ), which would be (2.012 *938e6 eV) / (190e3 eV) ≈ (1.887e9)/1.9e5 ≈ ~9930. But again, no matching option.

Alternatively, perhaps the voltage is applied for each half-revolution. So each half-revolution gives e U0, leading to two per revolution. So N = T/(2 e U0) = 950e6 / (2 *190e3) = 950e6/(380e3)=2500. Which is option D.

But earlier, I thought that each revolution gives two accelerations, each of e U0, leading to 2500.

But the problem states "two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950MeV." So perhaps it's accelerated twice, meaning each acceleration contributes to the energy. So if each acceleration gives e U0, then two accelerations give 2 e U0. But that would mean that each revolution gives two accelerations, leading to two energy boosts. So, if the proton undergoes N revolutions, that's 2N accelerations, each giving e U0. So total energy would be N * 2 e U0.

Wait, but the problem says it undergoes two accelerations. Wait, no: the question says, "undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950MeV." Hmm, that's confusing. So maybe it's being accelerated twice, which gets it to 950 MeV. So each acceleration gives 950/2 = 475 MeV. But that doesn't fit with the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps each acceleration is a single energy gain. So two accelerations would give 2 e U0. But that seems too simplistic.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to find another approach.

I recall that in a cyclotron, the maximum kinetic energy is given by K_max = (n e U0)/(gamma), where n is the number of turns. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another formula I found: the number of turns N for a synchrocyclotron is N = (gamma m c^2)/(e U0). So if gamma is about 2, then N would be (2 * 938e6 eV)/(190e3 eV) )= (1876e6)/(190e3) = 1876e3 /190 ≈ 9873. Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase doesn't affect the total number of revolutions but only the timing, so it can be neglected for this calculation.

So, going back to the initial approach, if each revolution gives two e U0, then N = T/(2 e U0) = 950e6 / (2 * 190e3) )= 950e6 / 380e3 = 2500.

Which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is N = (gamma - 1) m c^2 / (e U0). So, (2.012-1)*938e6 / (190e3) )= (1.012 *938e6)/190e3 ≈ (947.7e6)/190e3 ≈ 5000/1.012 ≈ 4942. But that's not an option.

Hmmm. I'm not getting anywhere with this. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, I think the key is that the energy per revolution in a synchrocyclotron is q U0. So each revolution adds q U0 to the kinetic energy. So N would be T1/(q U0).

But let me compute that.

T1 = 950 MeV = 950e6 eV.

q U0 = 1 * 190e3 eV = 190e3 eV.

So N = 950e6 / 190e3 = 950000 / 190 ≈ 5000.

Which is close to option B:5300.

But why the discrepancy? Ah, perhaps because the initial phase of pi/4 means that the first acceleration isn't at maximum. So the effective voltage is U0 * cos(pi/4) = 190e3 * 0.707 ≈ 134.35e3 V.

So the effective e U0 per revolution is 134.35e3 eV.

Then N = 950e6 / 134.35e3 ≈ let's compute.

950e6 / 134350 ≈ approx 7070.

Still doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, maybe the phase affects the starting point but not the effective energy per revolution because the average effect over time would still give the same number of revolutions.

So perhaps the phase doesn't affect the number of revolutions, only the initial timing of the acceleration.

In that case, the number of revolutions would be about 5000. But the closest option is B)5300.

Wait, wait another thought. In a synchrocyclotron, the number of revolutions N is given by N = (gamma m c^2)/(e U0) ). So gamma is (E_total)/(m c^2) )= (950 +938)/938 ≈ 2.

So N= (2 * 938e6 eV) / (190e3 eV )= (1.876e9) / (1.9e5)= approx 9873. Again, not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2π somewhere. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the frequency.

Wait, the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(2π ν(α) t + phi0). The frequency ν(α) is a function of the radius α. The resonance condition is that the angular frequency of the proton's motion matches that of the voltage.

The angular frequency for a charged particle in a magnetic field is omega = q B/(gamma m). And in the synchrocyclotron, B is adjusted so that omega matches the voltage's frequency.

But how does this relate to the number of revolutions?

Wait, the number of revolutions N is the total time of acceleration divided by the period of each revolution.

But the total time would be determined by how many times the voltage has to be applied to reach the desired energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is given by the total energy divided by the energy per revolution, with the energy per revolution being e U0.

So N = T1/(e U0) = 950e6 / 190e3 = 5000.

But option B is 5300, which is close. Maybe I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, another approach: the energy per revolution is actually e U0 / (gamma), because as the proton gains energy, its mass increases, so the gain per revolution decreases. So the total number of revolutions would be N = (gamma m c^2) / (e U0).

Which would be (2 * 938e6 ) / (190e3) )= (1876e6 ) / (190e3 )= 9873. Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm not sure anymore. I think the best approach is to go with the initial calculation where each revolution provides 2 e U0 of energy, leading to N = 950e6/(2*190e3) )= 2500, which is option D.

So I'll go with D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the energy gain per revolution and the total energy to be reached. The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy (\(T \approx 0\)) and is accelerated to a kinetic energy of \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\). The voltage applied in the accelerator is given by \(U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi \nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0]\), with \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\) and \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Gain Per Revolution**:  
   In a synchrocyclotron, the proton gains energy due to the alternating voltage. Each revolution provides an energy gain of approximately \(qU_0\), where \(q = e\) is the proton's charge. Since the voltage is sinusoidal, the proton is accelerated twice per revolution (once per half-cycle), effectively gaining \(2qU_0\) per revolution.

2. **Total Energy and Number of Revolutions**:  
   The total kinetic energy to be reached is \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\). Using the energy gain per revolution, the number of revolutions \(N\) is given by:  
   \[
   N = \frac{T_1}{2qU_0}
   \]  
   Substituting \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} = 190 \times 10^3 \, \text{eV}\):  
   \[
   N = \frac{950 \times 10^6}{2 \times 190 \times 10^3} = \frac{950 \times 10^6}{380 \times 10^3} = \frac{950}{0.38} \approx 2500
   \]

3. **Phase Consideration**:  
   The initial phase \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\) does not affect the total number of revolutions, as it only determines the timing of the acceleration. The total energy gain remains the same regardless of the phase.

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated number of revolutions is \(N = 2500\), which matches option D.

### Conclusion:
The proton makes approximately **2500 revolutions** in the synchrocyclotron to reach the kinetic energy of \(950 \, \text{MeV}\). 

Answer: D

Okay, so I have this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I've heard of cyclotrons before, but synchrocyclotrons are a bit different. Let me think about what I remember.

The question says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T is approximately zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1 = 950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? Maybe it's accelerated twice in each revolution? Or perhaps it's something else about the setup.

The voltage applied is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Φ0]. Oh wait, I think that in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage changes to match the proton's changing frequency as it gains energy. Because in a regular cyclotron, the frequency is fixed, but in a synchrocyclotron, it's adjusted to keep the resonance condition.

The data given: Φ0 is π/4, and U0 is 190 kV. So the initial phase shift is 45 degrees.

I'm trying to figure out how to find the number of revolutions the proton makes. I remember that in cyclotrons, the time for each revolution is related to the magnetic field and the velocity. The formula I recall is T = (2π m)/(qB), but that's when the frequency is fixed. In a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases as the particle gains energy? Or maybe the frequency of the accelerating voltage changes so that the phase of the voltage matches the phase of the particle's motion.

Wait, the key here is probably the resonance condition for the synchrocyclotron. The condition is that the angular frequency ω of the proton's motion equals the angular frequency of the accelerating voltage. So ω = 2πν(α), where ν is the frequency and α is the time variable.

But how does the proton's angular frequency change as it gains energy? Oh right, the proton's mass increases relativistically. So the momentum p is related to the magnetic field B by p = qBr, where r is the radius of the orbit. The energy of the proton is T = (p² c²)/(2m), but I might have to adjust for relativistic effects.

Wait, the problem states that the proton is injected with negligible kinetic energy, so initially, it's non-relativistic. But when it gains a lot of energy, relativistic effects become significant.

Wait, the kinetic energy is 950 MeV. Let me check what that means in terms of mass. The rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So 950 MeV is almost ten times the rest mass. So definitely relativistic.

The main equation for the synchrocyclotron is probably the energy gained per revolution. Each time the proton goes around, it gains some energy from the voltage. Considering that the voltage is applied in a way that the phase matches, each half-cycle (since it's cosine) might give a kick to the proton.

Wait, the accelerating voltage is sinusoidal, so each time the voltage is at its peak, the proton might gain energy. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, the number of revolutions might be determined by the total energy gained divided by the energy per revolution. Because each revolution, the proton gains some energy from the voltage.

Let me think about the energy gained. The voltage is U(t), so the energy per revolution might be related to the peak voltage times some factor.

Wait, the energy gain per revolution in a cyclotron is approximately q * U0, where q is the charge. But wait, is that correct? Or does it depend on the phase?

Wait, in a regular cyclotron, the maximum energy gain per half-cycle is qU0. So for each full cycle (two half-cycles), the proton gains 2qU0. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but this is a synchrocyclotron, so maybe the energy per revolution isn't constant because the magnetic field changes. Hmm. Alternatively, the number of revolutions can be found using the time it takes to reach the desired energy, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is the sum over each revolution's energy gain. So, each revolution, the proton gains some energy, and we can sum that up until reaching 950 MeV.

Wait, but I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this methodically.

The problem states that the proton is accelerated twice to reach T1=950 MeV. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe it's accelerated twice per revolution? Or perhaps it undergoes two acceleration events in total, but that seems unlikely for reaching such a high energy.

Wait, perhaps the main formula I should use is the relation between the number of revolutions N and the energy gained. In a synchrocyclotron, the total energy gained is the product of N and the energy per revolution.

The energy per revolution is approximately q*U0, but considering relativistic effects, the energy gain per revolution decreases as the proton's mass increases.

Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Let me think about the energy gained per revolution.

The energy gain per revolution for a relativistic particle in a synchrocyclotron can be approximated by ΔT ≈ q U0 (γ)^{-1} }, but I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, maybe it's ΔT ≈ q U0, regardless of γ.

Wait, maybe the energy per revolution is given by q U0, but since the magnetic field is adjusted, the actual formula might be different. Hmm, perhaps I should think about the total energy.

Wait, the total energy is given as 950 MeV, so I need to find how many times the proton is accelerated by the voltage U0 to reach this.

Wait, but the voltage is U(t), which is time-dependent. But each time the voltage completes a cycle, the particle is given a certain energy boost.

Wait, perhaps the total number of revolutions N is equal to the total energy divided by the energy per revolution. So N = T1/(q U0 per revolution).

But what's the energy per revolution? Let me think. In a cyclotron, each time the electric field is applied, the particle is accelerated. For a full cycle, the field changes polarity, so the particle is accelerated twice per revolution? Or perhaps once per half-cycle.

Wait, the voltage is sinusoidal, so the electric field is applied once per cycle, but the proton is accelerated twice per cycle, once when the voltage is positive and once when it's negative, but perhaps they're in phase with the motion.

Wait, maybe each half-cycle (each π) of the voltage gives a kick to the particle. So, each full cycle (2π) provides two kicks, each adding q U0. So for each revolution, the proton gains 2 q U0 of energy? Or maybe just q U0 per revolution.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of the basics. In a cyclotron, the electric field is applied in the gap between the dees. The electric field alternates, and the timing is such that the proton is accelerated each time it crosses the gap. The time it takes for each revolution must match the period of the electric field.

In a regular cyclotron, the frequency is fixed, and this leads to a fixed maximum energy. In a synchrocyclotron, the frequency is varied to account for the relativistic increase in mass, allowing for higher energies.

So, the energy gain per revolution in a synchrocyclotron might be related to the product of the charge, the voltage, and some factor involving the Lorentz factor.

Wait, I found a formula in my notes. The energy per revolution in a synchrocyclotron is given by ΔE ≈ (e U0)/(gamma). But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, but in the problem, the initial kinetic energy is negligible, so initially gamma is about 1. As the proton gains energy, gamma increases.

Wait, the total energy is T = 950 MeV. The rest mass energy of a proton is about 938 MeV. So the total energy is about 950 + 938 ≈ 1888 MeV, making gamma ≈ 1888 / 938 ≈ 2.011.

Wait, but that can't be right because when the kinetic energy is 950 MeV, the total energy is 950 + 938 = 1888 MeV, so gamma is 1888 / 938 ≈ 2.011. So it's a bit more than twice the rest mass.

Hmm, so each revolution, the proton gains some energy. So the number of revolutions would be the total energy divided by the energy per revolution.

But what's the energy per revolution? Let's think about the cyclotron equation.

In a cyclotron, the time for each revolution is T = (2π m)/(q B). But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is increased as the proton gains energy to keep the frequency matched. So the resonance condition is q B(r) = gamma m_e e omega, where omega is the angular frequency of the electric field.

Wait, perhaps the energy per revolution is e U0. Because each time the voltage completes a half cycle, the proton is accelerated by e U0.

Wait, but in a regular cyclotron, the energy gained per full cycle is e U0, because the electric field alternates, providing acceleration on each half cycle.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again about the energy per revolution.

In a regular cyclotron, the maximum kinetic energy is given by K_max = (n e U0) where n is the number of revolutions. But that's when the frequency is fixed and the proton can't go relativistic. In a synchrocyclotron, since the magnetic field changes, the number of revolutions needed increases.

But in this problem, the voltage is applied as U(t) = U0 cos(2 pi nu(t) t + phi0).

Wait, the phase phi0 is pi/4, but I'm not sure if that affects the number of revolutions. Maybe it's to do with the timing of the acceleration.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions can be found using the relation between the energy and the voltage.

Wait, another approach: the total energy T is given by T = (gamma - 1) m c^2. So gamma is (T + m c^2)/(m c^2). For T=950 MeV, m c^2 is about 938 MeV. So gamma ≈ (950 + 938)/938 ≈ (1888)/938 ≈ 2.012.

Wait, so gamma is about 2.012. Then, the total number of revolutions N can be found using the relation N = (gamma m c^2) / (e U0). Because each revolution provides e U0 energy.

Wait, but wait, the energy per revolution is e U0 multiplied by some factors. Alternatively, perhaps the total energy is N times e U0. Because each revolution adds e U0 energy.

But if the initial energy is zero, then T ≈ N e U0.

Wait, in that case, N = T / (e U0). But let's compute that.

U0 is 190 kV, which is 190,000 volts. e is the elementary charge, about 1.6e-19 coulombs.

So e U0 = 1.6e-19 C * 1.9e5 V = 3.04e-14 J.

But 950 MeV is 950e6 eV. Each eV is 1.6e-19 J, so 950e6 eV = 950e6 * 1.6e-19 = 1.52e-11 J.

So N would be T / (e U0) = (1.52e-11 J) / (3.04e-14 J) ≈ 5000 revolutions.

Looking at the options, B is 5300. That's in the ballpark. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing a factor of 2 because each revolution provides two energy kicks (positive and negative half cycles).

Wait, in a cyclotron, the proton is accelerated twice per revolution because the electric field changes direction each half cycle. So for each revolution, the proton gains 2 e U0.

Wait, but in that case, the energy per revolution would be 2 e U0.

Wait, let me recalculate. So T = N * 2 e U0.

So N = T/(2 e U0) = (950e6 eV) / (2 * 190e3 eV) ) = (950e6) / (380e3) = (950 * 1e6) / (380 * 1e3) ) = (950 * 1e3) / 380 = 950,000 / 380 ≈ 2500.

Hmm, 2500 is one of the options, option D.

But wait, earlier I thought that N would be around 5000, but that's without considering that each revolution gives two accelerations. So perhaps this approach is correct.

But wait, why am I considering two accelerations per revolution? Because in each revolution, the proton passes through the gap twice, once on each semicircle. So each half cycle provides a kick.

Wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the acceleration might be applied once per revolution because the magnetic field is adjusted to match the frequency.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit conflicting information here. Let's think again.

In a cyclotron, the electric field is applied each time the proton crosses the gap between the dees. Each time it does that, it's accelerated. Since it crosses twice per revolution, it gets two accelerations per revolution. So each revolution, the proton gains 2 e U0 of energy.

So for the total energy T = 950 MeV, the number of revolutions N would be T/(2 e U0).

But wait, the initial energy is zero, and each revolution adds 2 e U0. So N = T / (2 e U0).

Wait, but the voltage is applied as U(t) = U0 cos(...), so each full cycle (2π) would be one revolution, and the proton is accelerated twice, as in each half-cycle.

So, let me compute N. T is 950 MeV. U0 is 190 kV. So in terms of eV, U0 is 190e3 V * e charge, which is 190e3 eV.

Each revolution gives 2 * U0 eV, so 2 * 190e3 = 380e3 eV per revolution.

So N = (950e6 eV) / (380e3 eV) = (950e6)/(380e3) = 950e3 / 380 ≈ 2500.

Wait, that brings us to option D: 2500.

But wait, some sources might say that in a synchrocyclotron, each revolution provides only a single acceleration because the phase is adjusted, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is the same as in the cyclotron case.

But according to this calculation, option D is 2500.

Wait, but let me check the data given. The initial phase phi0 is pi/4. Does that affect anything? Maybe not in terms of the number of revolutions, but perhaps in the timing of the acceleration.

Alternatively, perhaps the actual formula involves integrating the energy gain over time, considering the varying magnetic field. But that might be more complicated, and given the options, 2500 is an option, and I'm getting that from a straightforward approach.

But wait, wait a minute. The problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. Does that mean that each acceleration gives a certain energy? If two accelerations are needed per something, maybe per revolution.

Hmm, if the proton is accelerated twice as it goes around once, then each revolution gives two kicks, each of e U0. So the energy per revolution is 2 e U0. So the computation I did earlier would hold, leading to N=2500.

So the answer would be D) 2500.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between whether each revolution gives one or two energy gains. Let me think about it.

In a cyclotron, the electric field is applied in the gap, and each time the proton crosses the gap, it's accelerated. Since the proton does this twice per revolution, each revolution contributes two energy gains. So each revolution gives 2 e U0.

Therefore, for T=950 MeV, the number of revolutions N is 950e6 eV / (2 * 190e3 eV) )= (950e6)/(380e3) = (950e3)/(380) ≈ 2500.

So the answer should be D.

But wait, another approach: the time taken for each revolution is T = (2π m)/(gamma q B). But since the magnetic field is adjusted, the product qB is kept such that the resonance condition is maintained. I'm not sure how that affects the number of revolutions.

Wait, perhaps the energy per revolution isn't simply e U0, but a bit more involved. Because as the proton gains energy, its momentum increases, and the radius of the orbit increases. But the magnetic field is varied to keep the cyclotron frequency matching the applied voltage.

Hmm, but perhaps the total energy can be written as N * e U0, where N is the number of revolutions. But I'm not sure if this is the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is N ≈ (gamma m c^2)/(e U0). Let me compute that.

gamma is about 2.012, m c^2 is 938 MeV. So (2.012 *938 MeV) / (190e3 eV) ) = (1888.9 MeV) / (190e3 eV) )= (1888900e3 eV) / (190e3 eV) )= 1888900/190 ≈ 9941.57. That's about 9941, which isn't one of the options.

Hmm, that's not matching any option. So maybe that approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is given by the total energy divided by the energy per revolution, which in this case is (gamma - 1) m c^2 = 950 MeV.

So N = (gamma -1) m c^2 / (e U0 per revolution).

Wait, but if each revolution gives e U0 energy, then N = 950e6 eV / 190e3 eV = 5000.

But looking at the options, option B is 5300. Close but not exact. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase phi0 is involved in the calculation. Since phi0 is pi/4, maybe the effective energy gain per revolution is 190e3 * cos(phi0) ?

Wait, phi0 is the initial phase. So the maximum energy transfer might be affected by this phase. The maximum acceleration occurs when the electric field is at its maximum, so when cos(phi0 + 2 pi nu t) is 1. So perhaps the effective energy per revolution is U0 * cos(phi0) in some way.

Wait, but the initial phase is pi/4, which is 45 degrees. Cos(pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.707. So if each revolution's energy gain is U0 * cos(phi0), then the energy per revolution is 190e3 V * e * 0.707.

Wait, let me recalculate N:

N = T / (e U0 cos(phi0)) ) = 950e6 eV / (190e3 eV * 0.7071) ≈ 950e6 / (190e3 * 0.7071) 

Calculate denominator: 190e3 * 0.7071 ≈ 134,349 eV.

So N ≈ 950e6 / 134349 ≈ 950,000,000 / 134,349 ≈ 7084. That's not matching any options.

Alternatively, maybe the energy per revolution is U0 times the amplitude factor. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the initial approach. The number of revolutions is N = T / (e U0), considering each revolution provides e U0.

So T=950 MeV = 950e6 eV.

e U0 = 190e3 eV.

So N=950e6 / 190e3 = 950000 / 190 ≈ 5000.

Looking at the options, 5300 is option B, which is close. But why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the phase phi0 affects the number of revolutions because the timing of the acceleration is such that not every half-cycle contributes to a full energy gain. For example, if the phase is pi/4, the first acceleration might not be at the peak, so the effective energy per revolution is less.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial phase causes the first acceleration to be smaller, but the question says the kinetic energy is negligible, so the first acceleration might be the main factor.

But I'm not sure. Another approach: the number of revolutions is given by N = gamma m c^2/(e U0) ). Because each revolution provides e U0.

gamma is about 2.012, so N = (2.012 * 938e6 eV) / (190e3 eV) )= (2.012 * 938e6) / 190e3.

Calculate numerator: 2.012 * 938e6 ≈ 1.887e9 eV.

Divide by 190e3 eV: 1.887e9 / 1.9e5 ≈ 1.887e9 / 1.9e5 = (1.887 / 1.9) * 1e4 ≈ 0.993 * 1e4 ≈ 9930.

Again, not matching any option.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Another thought: perhaps the energy per revolution is (e U0) * (gamma_initial)/(gamma_final), but I'm not sure.

Wait, considering the initial gamma is 1 and final gamma is about 2, so the average gamma is 1.5. So energy per revolution would be e U0 / gamma_avg. So N = T * gamma_avg / (e U0).

So N = (950e6 eV) * 1.5 / (190e3 eV) )= (950e6 * 1.5) / 190e3.

Calculate: 950e6 *1.5 = 1.425e9 eV.

Divide by 190e3: 1.425e9 / 1.9e5 ≈ 7500.

Still not matching any option.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is given by N = (gamma m c^2)/(e U0) ), which would be (2.012 *938e6 eV) / (190e3 eV) ≈ (1.887e9)/1.9e5 ≈ ~9930. But again, no matching option.

Alternatively, perhaps the voltage is applied for each half-revolution. So each half-revolution gives e U0, leading to two per revolution. So N = T/(2 e U0) = 950e6 / (2 *190e3) = 950e6/(380e3)=2500. Which is option D.

But earlier, I thought that each revolution gives two accelerations, each of e U0, leading to 2500.

But the problem states "two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950MeV." So perhaps it's accelerated twice, meaning each acceleration contributes to the energy. So if each acceleration gives e U0, then two accelerations give 2 e U0. But that would mean that each revolution gives two accelerations, leading to two energy boosts. So, if the proton undergoes N revolutions, that's 2N accelerations, each giving e U0. So total energy would be N * 2 e U0.

Wait, but the problem says it undergoes two accelerations. Wait, no: the question says, "undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950MeV." Hmm, that's confusing. So maybe it's being accelerated twice, which gets it to 950 MeV. So each acceleration gives 950/2 = 475 MeV. But that doesn't fit with the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps each acceleration is a single energy gain. So two accelerations would give 2 e U0. But that seems too simplistic.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to find another approach.

I recall that in a cyclotron, the maximum kinetic energy is given by K_max = (n e U0)/(gamma), where n is the number of turns. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another formula I found: the number of turns N for a synchrocyclotron is N = (gamma m c^2)/(e U0). So if gamma is about 2, then N would be (2 * 938e6 eV)/(190e3 eV) )= (1876e6)/(190e3) = 1876e3 /190 ≈ 9873. Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase doesn't affect the total number of revolutions but only the timing, so it can be neglected for this calculation.

So, going back to the initial approach, if each revolution gives two e U0, then N = T/(2 e U0) = 950e6 / (2 * 190e3) )= 950e6 / 380e3 = 2500.

Which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is N = (gamma - 1) m c^2 / (e U0). So, (2.012-1)*938e6 / (190e3) )= (1.012 *938e6)/190e3 ≈ (947.7e6)/190e3 ≈ 5000/1.012 ≈ 4942. But that's not an option.

Hmmm. I'm not getting anywhere with this. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, I think the key is that the energy per revolution in a synchrocyclotron is q U0. So each revolution adds q U0 to the kinetic energy. So N would be T1/(q U0).

But let me compute that.

T1 = 950 MeV = 950e6 eV.

q U0 = 1 * 190e3 eV = 190e3 eV.

So N = 950e6 / 190e3 = 950000 / 190 ≈ 5000.

Which is close to option B:5300.

But why the discrepancy? Ah, perhaps because the initial phase of pi/4 means that the first acceleration isn't at maximum. So the effective voltage is U0 * cos(pi/4) = 190e3 * 0.707 ≈ 134.35e3 V.

So the effective e U0 per revolution is 134.35e3 eV.

Then N = 950e6 / 134.35e3 ≈ let's compute.

950e6 / 134350 ≈ approx 7070.

Still doesn't match any option.

Alternatively, maybe the phase affects the starting point but not the effective energy per revolution because the average effect over time would still give the same number of revolutions.

So perhaps the phase doesn't affect the number of revolutions, only the initial timing of the acceleration.

In that case, the number of revolutions would be about 5000. But the closest option is B)5300.

Wait, wait another thought. In a synchrocyclotron, the number of revolutions N is given by N = (gamma m c^2)/(e U0) ). So gamma is (E_total)/(m c^2) )= (950 +938)/938 ≈ 2.

So N= (2 * 938e6 eV) / (190e3 eV )= (1.876e9) / (1.9e5)= approx 9873. Again, not matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2π somewhere. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the frequency.

Wait, the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos(2π ν(α) t + phi0). The frequency ν(α) is a function of the radius α. The resonance condition is that the angular frequency of the proton's motion matches that of the voltage.

The angular frequency for a charged particle in a magnetic field is omega = q B/(gamma m). And in the synchrocyclotron, B is adjusted so that omega matches the voltage's frequency.

But how does this relate to the number of revolutions?

Wait, the number of revolutions N is the total time of acceleration divided by the period of each revolution.

But the total time would be determined by how many times the voltage has to be applied to reach the desired energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is given by the total energy divided by the energy per revolution, with the energy per revolution being e U0.

So N = T1/(e U0) = 950e6 / 190e3 = 5000.

But option B is 5300, which is close. Maybe I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, another approach: the energy per revolution is actually e U0 / (gamma), because as the proton gains energy, its mass increases, so the gain per revolution decreases. So the total number of revolutions would be N = (gamma m c^2) / (e U0).

Which would be (2 * 938e6 ) / (190e3) )= (1876e6 ) / (190e3 )= 9873. Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm not sure anymore. I think the best approach is to go with the initial calculation where each revolution provides 2 e U0 of energy, leading to N = 950e6/(2*190e3) )= 2500, which is option D.

So I'll go with D.


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the energy gain per revolution and the total energy to be reached. The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy (\(T \approx 0\)) and is accelerated to a kinetic energy of \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\). The voltage applied in the accelerator is given by \(U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi \nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0]\), with \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV}\) and \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Gain Per Revolution**:  
   In a synchrocyclotron, the proton gains energy due to the alternating voltage. Each revolution provides an energy gain of approximately \(qU_0\), where \(q = e\) is the proton's charge. Since the voltage is sinusoidal, the proton is accelerated twice per revolution (once per half-cycle), effectively gaining \(2qU_0\) per revolution.

2. **Total Energy and Number of Revolutions**:  
   The total kinetic energy to be reached is \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\). Using the energy gain per revolution, the number of revolutions \(N\) is given by:  
   \[
   N = \frac{T_1}{2qU_0}
   \]  
   Substituting \(T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} = 190 \times 10^3 \, \text{eV}\):  
   \[
   N = \frac{950 \times 10^6}{2 \times 190 \times 10^3} = \frac{950 \times 10^6}{380 \times 10^3} = \frac{950}{0.38} \approx 2500
   \]

3. **Phase Consideration**:  
   The initial phase \(\Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4}\) does not affect the total number of revolutions, as it only determines the timing of the acceleration. The total energy gain remains the same regardless of the phase.

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated number of revolutions is \(N = 2500\), which matches option D.

### Conclusion:
The proton makes approximately **2500 revolutions** in the synchrocyclotron to reach the kinetic energy of \(950 \, \text{MeV}\). 

Answer: D
