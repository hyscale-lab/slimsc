Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. They're asking about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, I remember that the mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian is important for determining renormalizability. Renormalizable theories have all terms with mass dimension ≤4, right? Because the coupling constants must have mass dimension ≤4 to allow the theory to be renormalizable.

So, first, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should look at the dimensions of each part of the Lagrangian term.

Let's break down the term: κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

I remember that in 4-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension for fields and other objects are based on the equations they satisfy. For example, the Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is first order in derivatives, so each derivative contributes a mass dimension of 1, but I think for a term like ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, the dimension would be (3/2) + (3/2) +1 =5, which is correct for the kinetic term.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the kinetic term is ∫ L d^4x, so the Lagrangian itself must have mass dimension 4 because when you integrate over four dimensions (each x has dimension -1), so ∫ [L] [d^4x] → [L] * (-1)^4 = [L] must be dimensionless? Wait, no. Wait, no, the action S is dimensionless in natural units (ℏ = c =1), and S = ∫ L d^4x, so L must have dimensions of [mass]^4 because d^4x is [mass}^-4. So the Lagrangian density L has mass dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So for the given term, κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, the product must have mass dimension 4.

So I need to find the mass dimension of each component.

ψ is a Dirac spinor. Its mass dimension is 3/2 because for a Dirac equation, each ψ has dimension 3/2.

So ψ̄ is the adjoint, same dimension as ψ: 3/2.

σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, right? Because they're just matrices, not fields. So σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, so dimensionless.

F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. Or wait, in this case, what's F? Since the problem doesn't specify, but the structure is similar to the interaction term in QED, which is J^μ F_{μν}, where J is the current.

In QED, the field strength F has mass dimension 2. Because the field A_mu has dimension 1, and F_{mu nu} ~ ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, so each derivative adds dimension 1, so F has dimension 2.

So putting it all together:

The term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{mu nu} has the product of:

κ (dimension: let's call it [κ] )

ψ̄: 3/2

σ_{μν}: 0 (dimensionless)

ψ: 3/2

F^{mu nu}: 2

So the dimensions of the entire term is [κ] + 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = [κ] + (3 + 2) = [κ] +5.

Since the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4, we have [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]=4-5=-1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now the second part: is the theory renormalizable? That depends on whether the interaction term is renormalizable, which would require the coupling's dimension to satisfy certain conditions.

Wait, I think that for a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constants must have mass dimension ≤4. Because operators with higher dimension would lead to non-renormalizable interactions, which require counterterms of higher dimension and hence the theory isn't renormalizable.

Wait, no. Wait, more accurately, the Lagrangian terms must have mass dimension ≤4. The dimension of the coupling constants is determined by the term's dimension.

Wait, the term in the Lagrangian is dimension 4. So each coupling (here, κ) must have its dimension such that when multiplied by the fields, the term is dimension 4.

But for renormalizability, the interaction terms must have operators of dimension ≤4. So the operator in the Lagrangian must be of dimension ≤4, which is already the case here. Wait, but the operator here is ψ̄ σ F ψ.

Wait, the operator's dimension is [ψ̄] + [σ] + [F] + [ψ] = 3/2 + 0 +2 +3/2 = 4. So the operator itself is dimension 4. So it's a renormalizable interaction because the dimension is exactly 4.

Wait, but wait. The dimension of the coupling is negative, which is a bit tricky. Because in φ^4 theory, the coupling is dimensionless (in four dimensions), so the term is renormalizable.

In our case, the coupling κ has dimension -1. So when you write the term, κ is being multiplied by an operator of dimension 5 (since the operator has dimension 4, but multiplied by a coupling, but wait, no: the term is κ times the operator, which is dimension 4. So [κ] + [operator] = [Lagrangian being 4]. So the operator's dimension is 4? Wait, no, no: the operator is part of the Lagrangian term, so the operator itself must have dimension [Lagrangian] - [coupling]. So if the Lagrangian term has dimension 4, and the coupling has dimension [κ], then the operator has dimension 4 - [κ].

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. The term is κ * (operator). So [κ] + [operator] =4. Because the term is part of the Lagrangian, which must have dimension 4.

So [operator] =4 - [κ].

We found [κ]=-1, so [operator] =4 - (-1) =5.

So the operator has dimension 5, but wait, that's higher than 4. So that implies the term is non-renormalizable, right?

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because the operator in the term is part of the interaction Lagrangian. If the operator has dimension higher than 4, then the term is non-renormalizable. Because in a renormalizable theory, all interaction terms must have operators of dimension ≤4.

In our case, the operator (ψ̄ σ F ψ) has dimension 5. Because ψ is 3/2, ψ̄ is 3/2, F is 2, and σ is 0. So 3/2 +3/2 + 2=5.

Hmmm, so the operator has dimension 5. So the term is (κ) * (operator of dim 5), and the term must be dimension 4. So [κ] +5=4 → [κ]=-1, which is correct.

Wait, but that would make the interaction term non-renormalizable, because the operator is of higher dimension. So that would mean the theory is not renormalizable.

Wait, but wait: I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. In the Lagrangian, each term must have dimension 4. So the term κ ψ̄ σ F ψ must have dimension 4. The operator part (ψ̄ σ F ψ) has dimension 5, so the coupling κ must have dimension -1 to make the term 4.

But for a theory to be renormalizable, all interaction terms must have operators of dimension ≤4. Because terms with higher-dimension operators would require higher-order counterterms and thus make the theory non-renormalizable.

So our operator is of dimension 5, which is higher than 4. Therefore, the interaction term is non-renormalizable. So the theory as a whole is non-renormalizable.

So putting it all together:

Mass dimension of κ is -1. The theory is not renormalizable.

Looking at the options:

A) Dim -1, renormalizable: No, theory isn't ren.

B) Dim 1, ren: No.

C) Dim -1, not ren: Yes.

D) Dim 1, not ren: No.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$. The mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian must satisfy the condition that the entire term has a total mass dimension of 4, as the Lagrangian density in 4-dimensional spacetime has mass dimension 4.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields and operators
- The Dirac spinor field $\psi$ has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- Its adjoint $\bar{\psi}$ also has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension 2.
- The operator $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless because it is constructed from the dimensionless gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$.

### Step 2: Total mass dimension of the interaction term
The interaction term is $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$. The total mass dimension of the term must equal 4. Breaking it down:
- $\kappa$ has mass dimension $[\kappa]$.
- $\bar{\psi}$ contributes $\frac{3}{2}$.
- $\psi$ contributes $\frac{3}{2}$.
- $F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes 2.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless.

Thus, the total mass dimension is:
\[
[\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = [\kappa] + 5.
\]
Setting this equal to 4 (since the Lagrangian term must have mass dimension 4):
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
For a theory to be renormalizable, all interaction terms in the Lagrangian must involve operators of mass dimension $\leq 4$. The operator $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has a total mass dimension of:
\[
\frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
Since this operator has mass dimension 5, which is greater than 4, the interaction term is non-renormalizable. Consequently, the theory as a whole is not renormalizable.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about Lagrangians and renormalizability. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. They're asking about the mass dimension of κ and whether the theory is renormalizable.

So, first, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should look at the dimensions of each part of the Lagrangian term.

Let's break down the term: κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

I remember that in 4-dimensional spacetime, the mass dimension for fields and other objects are based on the equations they satisfy. For example, the Dirac field ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is first order in derivatives, so each derivative contributes a mass dimension of 1, but I think for a term like ψ̄ γ^μ ∂_μ ψ, the dimension would be (3/2) + (3/2) +1 =5, which is correct for the kinetic term.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the kinetic term is ∫ L d^4x, so the Lagrangian itself must have mass dimension 4 because when you integrate over four dimensions (each x has dimension -1), so ∫ [L] [d^4x] → [L] * (-1)^4 = [L] must be dimensionless? Wait, no. Wait, no, the action S is dimensionless in natural units (ℏ = c =1), and S = ∫ L d^4x, so L must have dimensions of [mass]^4 because d^4x is [mass}^-4. So the Lagrangian density L has mass dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So for the given term, κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}, the product must have mass dimension 4.

So I need to find the mass dimension of each component.

ψ is a Dirac spinor. Its mass dimension is 3/2 because for a Dirac equation, each ψ has dimension 3/2.

So ψ̄ is the adjoint, same dimension as ψ: 3/2.

σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_mu, γ_nu]. The gamma matrices are dimensionless, right? Because they're just matrices, not fields. So σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, so dimensionless.

F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. Or wait, in this case, what's F? Since the problem doesn't specify, but the structure is similar to the interaction term in QED, which is J^μ F_{μν}, where J is the current.

In QED, the field strength F has mass dimension 2. Because the field A_mu has dimension 1, and F_{mu nu} ~ ∂_mu A_nu - ∂_nu A_mu, so each derivative adds dimension 1, so F has dimension 2.

So putting it all together:

The term κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{mu nu} has the product of:

κ (dimension: let's call it [κ] )

ψ̄: 3/2

σ_{μν}: 0 (dimensionless)

ψ: 3/2

F^{mu nu}: 2

So the dimensions of the entire term is [κ] + 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = [κ] + (3 + 2) = [κ] +5.

Since the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4, we have [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]=4-5=-1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now the second part: is the theory renormalizable? That depends on whether the interaction term is renormalizable, which would require the coupling's dimension to satisfy certain conditions.

Wait, I think that for a theory to be renormalizable, the coupling constants must have mass dimension ≤4. Because operators with higher dimension would lead to non-renormalizable interactions, which require counterterms of higher dimension and hence the theory isn't renormalizable.

Wait, no. Wait, more accurately, the Lagrangian terms must have mass dimension ≤4. The dimension of the coupling constants is determined by the term's dimension.

Wait, the term in the Lagrangian is dimension 4. So each coupling (here, κ) must have its dimension such that when multiplied by the fields, the term is dimension 4.

But for renormalizability, the interaction terms must have operators of dimension ≤4. So the operator in the Lagrangian must be of dimension ≤4, which is already the case here. Wait, but the operator here is ψ̄ σ F ψ.

Wait, the operator's dimension is [ψ̄] + [σ] + [F] + [ψ] = 3/2 + 0 +2 +3/2 = 4. So the operator itself is dimension 4. So it's a renormalizable interaction because the dimension is exactly 4.

Wait, but wait. The dimension of the coupling is negative, which is a bit tricky. Because in φ^4 theory, the coupling is dimensionless (in four dimensions), so the term is renormalizable.

In our case, the coupling κ has dimension -1. So when you write the term, κ is being multiplied by an operator of dimension 5 (since the operator has dimension 4, but multiplied by a coupling, but wait, no: the term is κ times the operator, which is dimension 4. So [κ] + [operator] = [Lagrangian being 4]. So the operator's dimension is 4? Wait, no, no: the operator is part of the Lagrangian term, so the operator itself must have dimension [Lagrangian] - [coupling]. So if the Lagrangian term has dimension 4, and the coupling has dimension [κ], then the operator has dimension 4 - [κ].

Wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me think again. The term is κ * (operator). So [κ] + [operator] =4. Because the term is part of the Lagrangian, which must have dimension 4.

So [operator] =4 - [κ].

We found [κ]=-1, so [operator] =4 - (-1) =5.

So the operator has dimension 5, but wait, that's higher than 4. So that implies the term is non-renormalizable, right?

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because the operator in the term is part of the interaction Lagrangian. If the operator has dimension higher than 4, then the term is non-renormalizable. Because in a renormalizable theory, all interaction terms must have operators of dimension ≤4.

In our case, the operator (ψ̄ σ F ψ) has dimension 5. Because ψ is 3/2, ψ̄ is 3/2, F is 2, and σ is 0. So 3/2 +3/2 + 2=5.

Hmmm, so the operator has dimension 5. So the term is (κ) * (operator of dim 5), and the term must be dimension 4. So [κ] +5=4 → [κ]=-1, which is correct.

Wait, but that would make the interaction term non-renormalizable, because the operator is of higher dimension. So that would mean the theory is not renormalizable.

Wait, but wait: I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. In the Lagrangian, each term must have dimension 4. So the term κ ψ̄ σ F ψ must have dimension 4. The operator part (ψ̄ σ F ψ) has dimension 5, so the coupling κ must have dimension -1 to make the term 4.

But for a theory to be renormalizable, all interaction terms must have operators of dimension ≤4. Because terms with higher-dimension operators would require higher-order counterterms and thus make the theory non-renormalizable.

So our operator is of dimension 5, which is higher than 4. Therefore, the interaction term is non-renormalizable. So the theory as a whole is non-renormalizable.

So putting it all together:

Mass dimension of κ is -1. The theory is not renormalizable.

Looking at the options:

A) Dim -1, renormalizable: No, theory isn't ren.

B) Dim 1, ren: No.

C) Dim -1, not ren: Yes.

D) Dim 1, not ren: No.

So the correct answer is option C.


To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$. The mass dimension of a term in the Lagrangian must satisfy the condition that the entire term has a total mass dimension of 4, as the Lagrangian density in 4-dimensional spacetime has mass dimension 4.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields and operators
- The Dirac spinor field $\psi$ has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- Its adjoint $\bar{\psi}$ also has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension 2.
- The operator $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless because it is constructed from the dimensionless gamma matrices $\gamma_\mu$.

### Step 2: Total mass dimension of the interaction term
The interaction term is $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$. The total mass dimension of the term must equal 4. Breaking it down:
- $\kappa$ has mass dimension $[\kappa]$.
- $\bar{\psi}$ contributes $\frac{3}{2}$.
- $\psi$ contributes $\frac{3}{2}$.
- $F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes 2.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is dimensionless.

Thus, the total mass dimension is:
\[
[\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = [\kappa] + 5.
\]
Setting this equal to 4 (since the Lagrangian term must have mass dimension 4):
\[
[\kappa] + 5 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
For a theory to be renormalizable, all interaction terms in the Lagrangian must involve operators of mass dimension $\leq 4$. The operator $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ has a total mass dimension of:
\[
\frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
Since this operator has mass dimension 5, which is greater than 4, the interaction term is non-renormalizable. Consequently, the theory as a whole is not renormalizable.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
