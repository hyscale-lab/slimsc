Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

Starting with benzene, I need to introduce substituents in the right positions. Let's visualize the benzene ring. Positions 1, 2, and 3 are all meta to each other, but wait, no, 1 is adjacent to 2 and 3. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So numbering the positions, if position 1 is where the ethoxy group is, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So they're all in adjacent positions. So that's like 1, 2, 3-trisubstituted benzene with ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups.

But wait, wait—how can I get three substituents on the ring? I remember that when you have multiple substituents, the order in which you add them matters because each new group directs where the next will go. So activating and deactivating groups influence where the next substituent will attach.

Let me think about the substituents:

- tert-butyl is an activating group because it's an alkyl chain. It's a strong activating group, ortho/para-directing.

- Nitro is a strong deactivating group, meta-directing.

- Ethoxy is also an activating group, since it's an ether. It's ortho/para-directing as well.

But wait, the ethoxy group is more activating than nitro is deactivating. So once you have a nitro group, adding another substituent would be influenced by it.

Wait, no, nitro is a meta director, so any new substituent would come in meta to it. But if I have other substituents already present, their directing effects also matter.

Hmm, the target molecule has all three substituents. Let me try to figure out the order in which they should be added.

One approach is to plan the order of substituent introduction based on their influence. For example, introducing nitro groups early might make it harder to add activating groups later, since nitro deactivates the ring.

Alternatively, maybe I should add the groups in an order that allows each step to add the next group in the correct position.

So, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's imagine the benzene ring:

Position 1: ethoxy
Position 2: tert-butyl
Position 3: nitro

So, let me see the relative positions. Ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, ethoxy is at position 1, which is ortho to the nitro group at position 3, and meta to the tert-butyl at position 2.

Wait, maybe it's better to number them differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about each step.

Let me think about the synthesis steps. Benzene reactions typically involve electrophilic substitution. So perhaps alkylation, nitration, etc.

First, perhaps I need to introduce the tert-butyl group. Since tert-butyl chloride can be introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, which uses AlCl3 as a catalyst.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. Benzene itself can undergo alkylation, but it's a bit tricky because the ring is electron-rich. But wait, tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 would do a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So benzene would get a tert-butyl group. So after that, the ring has a tert-butyl group, which is an activating group, ortho/para-directing.

Next, perhaps I should introduce the nitro group. Since after the tert-butyl is present, the ring is activated. But wait, nitration uses a nitronium ion, which is a strong electrophile. So when the ring has an activating group, nitration would occur in the ortho or para positions relative to the tert-butyl.

Wait, but the target has the nitro group in position 3 relative to the ethoxy. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced later. Because nitro groups are deactivating, they can make the ring less reactive for subsequent reactions. So maybe it's better to introduce the nitro group after the activating groups.

Wait, but in this case, the target has two activating groups (tert-butyl and ethoxy), but also a nitro group. So let me think: if I nitrate after adding tert-butyl, then the nitro would be ortho or para to the tert-butyl. But then, if I add ethoxy afterward, the ethoxy will be directed by the existing groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced first, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro. Let me think about that.

Wait, let's think about the directing effects.

1. Adding ethoxy first: Benzene with ethoxy group. Ethoxy is activating, so next substituents would go ortho or para to it.

2. Next, adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts. Since ethoxy is meta/ortho/para director, but wait, ethoxy directs incoming groups to ortho and para. So the tert-butyl would come either ortho or para to the ethoxy.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts can sometimes have issues with activating groups. Wait, no, benzene with an ethoxy group (activating) would undergo Friedel-Crafts alkylation more readily. So after adding ethoxy, adding tert-butyl would direct it to ortho or para.

But in the target, the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So, if I first add ethoxy to benzene, then the ring has ethoxy at position 1. Then, adding tert-butyl would go to position 2 (ortho) or position 4 (para). But position 2 is adjacent, so ortho.

So after these two, the substituents are ethoxy (1) and tert-butyl (2). Now, when I introduce the nitro group, it would be directed by the other substituents.

But wait, nitro is a meta director, but which substituent is more influential? The ring has two activating groups, ethoxy and tert-butyl. Nitration is an electrophilic substitution, so the incoming nitro group would go to the position that is activated by the existing groups.

But wait, the existing groups are both activating, so they would direct incoming groups to their ortho and para positions. So positions available would be 3, 4, 5, 6. Let's see:

If ethoxy is at 1, and tert-butyl is at 2, the ring would have substituents at 1 and 2. The positions available are 3,4,5,6. The ethoxy group directs incoming to 2,4,6. The tert-butyl group directs to 1,3,5. So the intersection of the activated positions is perhaps position 3 and 5. So which one would the nitro group go?

Wait, but nitration is a strong electrophile, so perhaps the most activated position is where the nitro group goes.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, there might be steric issues. So, which positions are available. If we have ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, the next substituent could go at 3 (which is meta to the tert-butyl and adjacent to the ethoxy) or 4 (meta to the ethoxy, which would be position 4, which is para to ethoxy and meta to tert-butyl at 2—position 4 is across from 1, so para to ethoxy. Hmm.

But I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this differently.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the order of substituents based on the possible reaction steps.

Looking at the options, each option provides a series of reactions. Let's see them.

Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) SO3/H2SO4; iv) NaNO2/HCl; v) dilute H2SO4; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat; vii) NaOH/EtBr; viii) Fe/HCl; ix) HNO3/H2SO4.

Wait, that seems a lot of steps. Let me think what each step does.

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation: adds tert-butyl to benzene.

ii) Nitration: adds nitro group.

iii) Sulfonation: adds a sulfonic acid group, but why?

iv) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl): typically for preparing diazonium salts.

v) Dilute H2SO4: acid workup.

vi) H3O+ and heat: hydrolysis of diazonium salt?

vii) NaOH and EtBr: perhaps an SN2 reaction, like ethoxy group substitution.

viii) Fe/HCl: maybe for removing a substituent, like in a Clemmensen reduction, but benzene doesn't have double bonds. Alternatively, maybe it's for dehalogenation, but not sure.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4: another nitration.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Let me see if I can model the steps.

Starting with benzene:

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation: adds tert-butyl. Now structure is tert-butylbenzene.

ii) Nitration: nitro group adds. Where? Since tert-butyl is an activating group, ortho/para director. So nitro would go at ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's imagine it goes to para (position 4), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it goes to ortho (position 2 or 3). Wait, benzene is symmetric. If tert-butyl is on position 1, nitration would occur at ortho (2 or 6) or para (4). Let's say it goes to position 2. So now, structure is 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.

But wait, the target has nitro at position 3 relative to ethoxy. Hmm, maybe I'm not on the right track.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration occurs after adding ethoxy. Wait, but in option A, the order is alkylation first, then nitration.

Wait, let's think about the target molecule. It has three substituents:

At position 1: ethoxy (OCH2CH2CH3)

At position 2: tert-butyl (C(CH3)3)

At position 3: nitro (NO2)

So in the ring, positions 1,2,3 are adjacent to each other.

So the substituents are in 1,2,3 positions. Wait, that's a meta arrangement for some substituents, but adjacent for others.

Hmm. So how to get the nitro in position 3 relative to the ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the order is ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But then, after ethoxy is added, the tert-butyl comes next, which would be directed by the ethoxy. Since ethoxy is ortho/para, the tert-butyl could be added either ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) to the ethoxy at position 1. If I add tert-butyl at position 2 (ortho), then the ring has ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2. Now, adding the nitro group would be influenced by both substituents.

Ethoxy is activating, so it would direct nitro to ortho/para positions (2,4,6). But the tert-butyl is also activating, directing to ortho/para (positions 1,3,5). The intersection of these would be position 3 and 5?

Wait, position 3 is adjacent to the ethoxy (position 1) but also meta to the tert-butyl at position 2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group would go into position 3, which is ortho to tert-butyl and para to ethoxy? Or maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the next substituent (nitro) would have to go at position 3, which is adjacent to both. But how? Because the ethoxy directs to 2,4,6, and the tert-butyl directs to 1,3,5. So the common positions are 3 and 5? Wait, 3 is adjacent to 2 (tert-butyl) and 4 (which is para to ethoxy). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps when two substituents are present, the most activating group has a greater influence. Ethoxy is a stronger activating group than tert-butyl? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. Both are activating. Ethoxy is an electron-donating group (due to the oxygen), so it's more activating than alkyl groups? Or is it the other way? Wait, I think alkyl groups are activating via induction, but also through +I effect. But oxygen groups like -OCH2CH3 are stronger activating because of resonance.

So perhaps the ethoxy group is more activating. So when both are present, the incoming nitro group would be directed by the ethoxy group.

So, ethoxy directs to ortho (2,6) and para (4) positions. Now, the ring already has substituents at 1 (ethoxy) and 2 (tert-butyl). So the available positions for nitration would be 3,4,5,6. But ethoxy directs to 2 and 4 (ortho) and 6 (para). But 2 is already taken by tert-butyl. So the next available would be 4 and 6. However, the target has nitro at 3, which is not among these positions. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I'm not thinking this through correctly. Let's consider the directing effects again. When two substituents are present, the positions where the new substituent can go are determined by where the substituents' activating effects overlap. So, if ethoxy is at 1 and tert-butyl at 2, the nitro group would go where both groups' directing effects allow.

The ethoxy at 1 directs ortho (2 and 6) and para (4). But 2 is already occupied by tert-butyl. So the next available para position would be 4. The tert-butyl at 2 directs ortho (1 and 3) and para (5). So nitration would occur at positions 1,3,5. But position 1 is taken by ethoxy, so the possible positions are 3 and 5.

So the nitro group would go either to position 3 or 5. The target has it at position 3. So if the order is ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro, the nitro would be either at 3 or 5. So let's see.

In the target, nitro is at 3. So if during nitration, it goes to 3, which is ortho to the tert-butyl at 2 and meta to ethoxy at 1.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to nitrate after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to nitrate first, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options again. Let's look at the options for the reaction sequences.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) SO3/H2SO4; vii) dilute H2SO4; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat; ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Hmmm. Starting with nitration. So benzene is nitrated. The product is nitrobenzene.

Then Fe/HCl. Hmm, Fe in HCl is often for dissolving something else, maybe a reduction step? Wait, nitrobenzene can be reduced with Fe and HCl to produce aniline. But why would that be needed here?

Wait, but then step iii is Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl chloride). So after nitration and reduction, the ring has an amine group (from nitro reduction). But Friedel-Crafts won't work on aniline because the ring is highly deactivated by the -NH2 group, which is strongly activating but in a different way. Wait, no, aniline is strongly activating, but Friedel-Crafts reactions typically require a Lewis acid catalyst, and aniline is more reactive but can undergo alkylation.

Wait, but if you have aniline, adding a tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts might be possible, but the position would be directed by the amino group. Aniline is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So the tert-butyl would go either ortho or para to the amino group (which was originally the nitro group).

But then, in the target, the substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. So this approach doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: introducing a leaving group and then substituting.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 reaction. Oh, but benzene doesn't have a leaving group unless we have a substituent with a good leaving group attached.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction. For example, via a benzene ring with a tosyl group, which can be replaced by an ethoxide ion.

Wait, but if I have a nitro group on the ring, which is a strong deactivating group, then the ring is less reactive, making substitution reactions harder. So maybe the ethoxy group is added before the nitro group.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy group, because the ethoxy is activating.

Wait, the target has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. So perhaps the order is ethoxy, tert-butyl, and then nitro.

But I'm not sure. Let me see the options again.

Looking at option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3
ii) HNO3/H2SO4
iii) Fe/HCl
iv) HNO3/H2SO4
v) NaNO2/HCl
vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat
vii) NaOH/EtBr
viii) SO3/H2SO4
ix) dilute H2SO4

Hmm, that's a lot. Let's think step by step.

i) Benzene is alkylated with t-BuCl, AlCl3 to get tert-butylbenzene.

ii) Nitration: adds nitro group. Where? Para or ortho to t-Bu. Suppose para (position 4).

Now, structure is 1-t-Bu-4-nitrobenzene.

iii) Fe/HCl: Fe in HCl is often for reduction. Nitro group can be reduced to amino. So structure becomes 1-t-Bu-4-amino benzene.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration again. But the ring now has amino group, which is strongly activating. Nitration would occur ortho or para to amino.

But the amino is at position 4. So nitro could go to position 3 or 5 (ortho) or 1 (para). But position 1 has t-Bu, so probably position 3 or 5.

If it goes to position 3, then structure would have t-Bu (1), nitro (4), and another nitro (3)? No, that would be two nitro groups, but the target has only one.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Wait, after step iii, the ring has t-Bu at 1 and amino at 4.

In step iv, another nitration occurs. Let's see where. The amino group is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So nitro would go to positions 3,5 (ortho) or 1 (para). Position 1 is taken by t-Bu, so nitro could go to 3 or 5. Let's say 3.

Now, structure is 1-t-Bu, 4-amino, 3-nitro. Then step v is NaNO2/HCl. That's a diazotization step, turning the amino group into a diazonium salt. So now, the ring has t-Bu (1), diazonium at 4, and nitro at 3.

Step vi: H3O+, H2O, heat. That's a hydrolysis step, which would convert the diazonium group into a hydroxyl group. So structure becomes 1-t-Bu, 4-OH, 3-nitro.

Step vii: NaOH and EtBr. That's an SN2 reaction, replacing the hydroxyl group with ethoxy. So now, 1-t-Bu, 4-ethoxy, 3-nitro.

But the target has ethoxy at position 1, t-Bu at 2, and nitro at 3. So this doesn't match. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the steps.

Wait, perhaps the numbering is different. Maybe the t-Bu is at position 2.

Wait, in the starting steps, benzene is first alkylated with t-BuCl to get t-Bu at position 1. Then nitration adds nitro at position 4. Then reduction gives amino at 4. Then nitration adds nitro at position 3. Then diazotization and hydrolysis produce OH at 4. Then substitution with ethoxy at 4.

So the substituents are t-Bu (1), nitro (3), ethoxy (4). But target has ethoxy at 1, t-Bu at 2, and nitro at 3. So this is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is different. Let me think about another approach.

The target has ethoxy at position 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3. So, the substituents are adjacent in a 1,2,3 pattern.

So, perhaps the order is:

1. Introduce ethoxy group.

2. Introduce t-Bu group.

3. Introduce nitro group.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires a strongly deactivating group, like a nitro, already present.

Wait, maybe the order is: nitrate first, then t-Bu alkylation, then ethoxy substitution.

But let's think:

Benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene.

Then, Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → but nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts might not proceed. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups, so nitro group makes the ring less reactive. So t-Bu alkylation may not be feasible.

So perhaps that's not the right order.

Alternative approach: introducing ethoxy via a tosylate or another leaving group. Maybe:

First, benzene → tosyl chloride to make benzene tosylate.

Then, substitute with ethoxide. But how to introduce ethoxide—maybe via an SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution). That requires a strongly deactivating group, like nitro, already present.

So perhaps benzene is nitrated first, then ethoxy is added via substitution, then t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, but after nitration, the ring is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed easily.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after a nitro group is present.

But that's getting complicated.

Wait, maybe the correct sequence is to first add the ethoxy group, then add the t-Bu group, then add the nitro group.

But when adding the nitro group, it's directed by the ethoxy and t-Bu groups.

Wait, after adding ethoxy and t-Bu, the nitro needs to go to position 3. So perhaps the nitration occurs in a position that's ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy.

Wait, let's model it:

After ethoxy at 1 and t-Bu at 2, the nitro group (as a meta director) would be directed by the more activating group.

Wait, but nitration is an electrophilic substitution. So the nitro group is added where the ring is most activated.

The ethoxy group is stronger activating than t-Bu. So it would dominate in directing the nitration.

But wait, the nitro group is a strong deactivating group. So if the ethoxy is at 1, directing ortho (2,6) and para (4), but 2 is occupied by t-Bu, so nitration would go to 4. But the target has nitro at 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu.

Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that after adding ethoxy and t-Bu, the nitro is added in a position that's ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy.

So, ethoxy is at 1, t-Bu at 2. Nitro would be at position 3, which is ortho to t-Bu (position 2) and meta to ethoxy (position 1). That fits the target.

So how to achieve that.

So, the nitration needs to happen such that the nitro group goes to position 3.

But how can the nitration be directed to that position when both ethoxy and t-Bu are present? Since ethoxy is a stronger activating group than t-Bu, perhaps it's the main director.

Wait, but when two substituents are present, the one that is more activating can dominate.

Ethoxy is more activating, so the nitration would be directed by ethoxy. So the nitro group might go para to ethoxy, which is position 4.

But in the target, nitro is at position 3, which isn't para or ortho to ethoxy.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

Option C: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3; ii) SO3/H2SO4; iii) HNO3/H2SO4; iv) Fe/HCl; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) HNO3/H2SO4; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat; viii) dilute H2SO4; ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Hmm. Let's go through this.

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) Sulfonation → adds a sulfonic acid group. So the ring now has t-Bu and SO3H groups.

But why sulfonate? Because sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Then step iii is nitration. So with t-Bu (activating, ortho/para) and SO3H (deactivating, meta), the nitration would be directed by the more activating group.

t-Bu is more activating, so nitration would go ortho or para to t-Bu.

So after step iii, nitro is added ortho or para to t-Bu.

But then, in step iv, Fe/HCl. Maybe reduction of the nitro group to amine.

So now, the ring has t-Bu, SO3H, and amino groups.

Then step v: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, then step vi: HNO3/H2SO4? Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, after step v (diazotization), step vi is another nitration? That seems odd.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps step vi is a hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. Wait, step vi is H3O+ and heat, which would hydrolyze the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group.

Then step vii is NaOH and EtBr, which would substitute the hydroxyl with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure. This seems too convoluted, and I'm not sure if it would lead to the correct substituents in the right positions.

Another approach: perhaps the correct answer is option D. Let me think about option D.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amino. So now, aniline.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, aniline is a strong activating group, so the t-Bu would add at ortho or para to amino.

So after step iii: structure is 1-nitro (reduced to amino?), no, wait: step i is nitration, step ii is reduction.

Wait, step i: nitro group added to benzene → nitrobenzene.

Step ii: Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amino. So structure becomes aniline.

Step iii: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → adds t-Bu to aniline. Aniline is a strong activating group, so t-Bu would add ortho or para to amino.

So, if amino is at position 1, t-Bu would go to 2 or 4.

Then, step iv: nitration again. Now, the ring has amino (1) and t-Bu (2 or 4). Nitration would be directed by the amino group (since it's more activating) to ortho or para.

If t-Bu is at 2, then amino is at 1. Nitration would go to 3 or 5 (ortho) or 4 (para). So let's say 3.

Now, structure has amino (1), t-Bu (2), nitro (3).

Then step v: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of amino.

Step vi: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation? Or maybe it's a sulfonation step, but why now?

Wait, step vi: SO3/H2SO4 is sulfonation. So adding a sulfonic acid group.

But the ring already has three substituents, but the target only has three, but maybe this is an extra step.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps. This seems complicated.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, the target structure has ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro. So how does that happen in option D's steps?

Let me think again.

Option D steps:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amino → aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation → t-Bu added ortho or para to amino.

Assuming t-Bu is at position 2.

iv) Nitration → adds nitro, now at position 3 (ortho to amino at 1 and adjacent to t-Bu at 2).

v) Diazotization → converts amino (position 1) to diazonium salt.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Hmm, but why sulfonate now? The ring has t-Bu (2), nitro (3), and a diazonium group (1).

Wait, step vi: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. So the ring has three substituents: t-Bu (2), nitro (3), and sulfonic acid (1). Because the diazonium group was at 1, and perhaps the sulfonation occurs there?

Wait, no, the sulfonating agent would add to the activated position. But the ring is now highly substituted and deactivated in some positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonating step is not needed in the target structure. The target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so this step might be for something else.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the options in terms of the steps needed.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, substituents are:

- 1: ethoxy.

- 2: t-Bu.

- 3: nitro.

So, the order in which these are added should be such that each substituent directs the next correctly.

Let me think of the possible order:

Option: Add t-Bu first. Then ethoxy, then nitro.

But wait, after t-Bu and ethoxy, where would nitro go?

Wait, ethoxy is activating, t-Bu is activating. Nitro is deactivating.

So, if t-Bu is added first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, let's think:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → t-Bu benzene.

2. Next, introduce ethoxy. How? Perhaps via an SNAr, but the ring is activated by t-Bu, so perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts would require a leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps ethoxy is added via a substitution reaction.

Wait, perhaps we can make a benzene ring with a leaving group, like a tosyl group, and then substitute it with ethoxide. But that would require a directing group.

Alternatively, perhaps ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring with a nitro group. But that seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps ethoxy is added via a different method, like using an alkyl halide and a strong base, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after a nitro group is present. But then, the ring would be deactivated, making substitution difficult.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Ethoxy group first via nucleophilic substitution (like using a tosyl group as a leaving group).

2. Then add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

3. Then add nitro via nitration.

But how to add ethoxy first.

Wait, perhaps benzene is first tosylated (using tosyl chloride), making benzene tosylate. Then, treated with ethoxide (NaOEt) to substitute the tosyl group with ethoxy. That would give ethoxybenzene.

Then, Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → adds t-Bu at ortho or para to ethoxy.

Then, nitration would add nitro at a position directed by ethoxy and t-Bu.

But wait, after ethoxy and t-Bu are added, the nitration would be directed by ethoxy (since it's more activating). So nitro could go to position 2 or 4 (if ethoxy is at 1, t-Bu at 2, then nitro would go to 4, which is para to ethoxy and meta to t-Bu. But target has nitro at 3, which is ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added before the ethoxy.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct answer based on the options.

Looking at the options, each has a series of steps. Let's think about when each substituent is added.

The target has ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro.

In the target, ethoxy is at position 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3.

So, the ethoxy is in the para position relative to t-Bu.

Wait, but no, because 1 and 2 are adjacent. So perhaps the ethoxy is ortho to t-Bu.

Wait, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, so ethoxy is ortho to t-Bu.

So, the order would be to add t-Bu first, then ethoxy (which would go in the ortho position), then nitro.

So: benzene → t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts → then ethoxy via substitution (but how?) → then nitro via nitration.

Wait, but after adding t-Bu, the ring is activated, so substitution could occur.

Alternatively, perhaps ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strong deactivating group, which isn't present yet.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a different method, like using an acetate group and then substituting.

But this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the options again.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → t-Bu added to benzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitro adds. Let's say para to t-Bu.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amino.

iv) HNO3 → nitro adds again. Where? Amino is ortho/para director. So nitro would go to ortho or para to amino.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolyze diazo to hydroxyl.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → SN2 substitution of OH with ethoxy.

So, the substituents would be t-Bu at 1, nitro at 4, then after reduction, amino at 4. Then nitro again at 3 (ortho to amino), then hydroxyl at 3, then ethoxy at 3.

Wait, so structure would be t-Bu (1), ethoxy (3), and nitro (4). That doesn't match the target.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl → t-Bu benzene.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitro group.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amino.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) HNO3 → another nitro.

Wait, this seems to add more substituents, which complicates things.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl → t-Bu benzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitro.

iii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2 → diazo.

v) H2SO4 → ?

vi) H3O+ → hydrolyze.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

So, after step ii: nitro added. Let's say para to t-Bu. Then sulfonate is added (SO3), which is a meta director.

Then, diazotization, then hydrolysis to OH, then substitution with ethoxy.

Not sure, but this could result in the ethoxy at a position influenced by the sulfonate.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the reaction steps needed.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, substituents at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (nitro).

So, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Ethoxy group added first.

2. Then, t-Bu added.

3. Then, nitro added.

But how to add ethoxy first. Because benzene is not easily substituted, but perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use a directing group to position the substituents correctly.

Wait, another approach: the nitro group is a meta director, so if we have nitro at position 3, then the ethoxy must be at position 1, and t-Bu at 2.

But I'm not getting anywhere quickly. Let me think about the reaction steps in the options.

Looking at option D:

Steps:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amino.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation → t-Bu added ortho or para to amino.

iv) Nitration → nitro added ortho or para to amino.

v) Diazotization → amino to diazonium.

vi) SO3 → sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → ?

viii) H3O+ → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Wait, after step iv, the ring has amino (position 1), t-Bu (2), and nitro (3). Then step v: diazo, which converts amino to diazonium. Step vi: sulfonate—adds a sulfonic acid group where? Maybe at position 4.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group. So this seems off.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B.

Wait, after step vii in option B, the ethoxy is added via substitution, which would be at the position where the OH was.

So, after steps i to vii:

t-Bu (1), nitro (4), then reduction to amino (4), then nitro again (3), then hydroxyl (3), then ethoxy (3).

So, substituents are t-Bu (1), nitro (4), ethoxy (3). Doesn't match the target.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct option is option D. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, looking at the target structure, to get ethoxy at 1, t-Bu at 2, and nitro at 3, perhaps the steps would be:

1. Add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add nitro via nitration, directed by t-Bu to position 3.

3. Add ethoxy via substitution, perhaps after introducing a leaving group.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via an SN2 reaction, but that requires a good leaving group which is not present unless we create it.

Wait, another approach: after adding t-Bu and nitro, perform a substitution to add ethoxy.

But in the target, the nitro is at 3. So after adding t-Bu and nitro, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution.

Wait, but benzene with t-Bu and nitro groups would be deactivated, making substitution difficult.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring. But that's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add nitro.

2. Add t-Bu.

3. Add ethoxy via substitution.

But then, the nitro is a deactivating group, making substitution difficult.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Introduce a nitro group.

2. Introduce ethoxy via substitution.

3. Introduce t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

But Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group; the ring would have nitro and ethoxy. Nitro deactivates, ethoxy activates. So perhaps the ring is still reactive enough for Friedel-Crafts.

So, after nitro and ethoxy are added, t-Bu would go to a position directed by ethoxy.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not confident.

After thinking through all this, I think the correct option is option D. Because in option D, after nitration and reduction, the t-Bu is added, then another nitration, leading to substituents that can be manipulated via diazotization and substitution to reach the target.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must carefully direct the introduction of substituents to achieve the desired positions: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. The order of adding substituents and their directing effects are critical, as activating groups like tert-butyl and ethoxy direct incoming substituents to ortho and para positions, while deactivating groups like nitro direct to meta positions.

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **t-BuCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds tert-butyl to benzene.
2. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds a nitro group, likely ortho or para to tert-butyl.
3. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is unnecessary for the target structure.
4. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization converts an amine (if present) to a diazonium salt.
5. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group.
6. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitutes the hydroxyl group with ethoxy.
7. **Fe/HCl**: Likely reduces a nitro group, but this step is unclear in the context of the target structure.
8. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Another nitration step, which complicates the synthesis.

This sequence introduces unnecessary steps (e.g., sulfonation) and does not clearly lead to the target structure.

#### **Option B**:
1. **t-BuCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds tert-butyl to benzene.
2. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds a nitro group, likely ortho or para to tert-butyl.
3. **Fe/HCl**: Reduces the nitro group to an amino group.
4. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Another nitration step, which could add a second nitro group.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization converts the amino group to a diazonium salt.
6. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group.
7. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitutes the hydroxyl group with ethoxy.
8. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is unnecessary for the target structure.
9. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Acid workup.

This sequence introduces a second nitro group and a sulfonic acid group, which are not part of the target structure. It does not achieve the correct substituent positions.

#### **Option C**:
1. **t-BuCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds tert-butyl to benzene.
2. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is unnecessary for the target structure.
3. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds a nitro group.
4. **Fe/HCl**: Reduces the nitro group to an amino group.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization converts the amino group to a diazonium salt.
6. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Another nitration step, which complicates the synthesis.
7. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group.
8. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Acid workup.
9. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitutes the hydroxyl group with ethoxy.

This sequence introduces a sulfonic acid group and a second nitro group, which are not part of the target structure. It does not achieve the correct substituent positions.

#### **Option D**:
1. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds a nitro group to benzene.
2. **Fe/HCl**: Reduces the nitro group to an amino group.
3. **t-BuCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds tert-butyl to the ring.
4. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Another nitration step adds a nitro group.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization converts the amino group to a diazonium salt.
6. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is unnecessary for the target structure.
7. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Acid workup.
8. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group.
9. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitutes the hydroxyl group with ethoxy.

This sequence introduces a sulfonic acid group and does not clearly achieve the correct substituent positions.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences perfectly match the target structure. However, **Option D** comes closest, as it involves nitration, reduction, and Friedel-Crafts alkylation steps that could potentially lead to the desired substituents. Despite introducing a sulfonic acid group, it aligns more closely with the required transformations than the other options.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right sequence of reactions to synthesize a specific compound. The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Hmm, that's a mouthful. Let me break it down.

Starting with benzene, I need to introduce substituents in the right positions. Let's visualize the benzene ring. Positions 1, 2, and 3 are all meta to each other, but wait, no, 1 is adjacent to 2 and 3. Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So numbering the positions, if position 1 is where the ethoxy group is, position 2 is tert-butyl, and position 3 is nitro. So they're all in adjacent positions. So that's like 1, 2, 3-trisubstituted benzene with ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro groups.

But wait, wait—how can I get three substituents on the ring? I remember that when you have multiple substituents, the order in which you add them matters because each new group directs where the next will go. So activating and deactivating groups influence where the next substituent will attach.

Let me think about the substituents:

- tert-butyl is an activating group because it's an alkyl chain. It's a strong activating group, ortho/para-directing.

- Nitro is a strong deactivating group, meta-directing.

- Ethoxy is also an activating group, since it's an ether. It's ortho/para-directing as well.

But wait, the ethoxy group is more activating than nitro is deactivating. So once you have a nitro group, adding another substituent would be influenced by it.

Wait, no, nitro is a meta director, so any new substituent would come in meta to it. But if I have other substituents already present, their directing effects also matter.

Hmm, the target molecule has all three substituents. Let me try to figure out the order in which they should be added.

One approach is to plan the order of substituent introduction based on their influence. For example, introducing nitro groups early might make it harder to add activating groups later, since nitro deactivates the ring.

Alternatively, maybe I should add the groups in an order that allows each step to add the next group in the correct position.

So, the target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene. Let's imagine the benzene ring:

Position 1: ethoxy
Position 2: tert-butyl
Position 3: nitro

So, let me see the relative positions. Ethoxy is at 1, tert-butyl at 2, nitro at 3. So, ethoxy is at position 1, which is ortho to the nitro group at position 3, and meta to the tert-butyl at position 2.

Wait, maybe it's better to number them differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about each step.

Let me think about the synthesis steps. Benzene reactions typically involve electrophilic substitution. So perhaps alkylation, nitration, etc.

First, perhaps I need to introduce the tert-butyl group. Since tert-butyl chloride can be introduced via Friedel-Crafts alkylation, which uses AlCl3 as a catalyst.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. Benzene itself can undergo alkylation, but it's a bit tricky because the ring is electron-rich. But wait, tert-butyl chloride with AlCl3 would do a Friedel-Crafts alkylation. So benzene would get a tert-butyl group. So after that, the ring has a tert-butyl group, which is an activating group, ortho/para-directing.

Next, perhaps I should introduce the nitro group. Since after the tert-butyl is present, the ring is activated. But wait, nitration uses a nitronium ion, which is a strong electrophile. So when the ring has an activating group, nitration would occur in the ortho or para positions relative to the tert-butyl.

Wait, but the target has the nitro group in position 3 relative to the ethoxy. Hmm, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced later. Because nitro groups are deactivating, they can make the ring less reactive for subsequent reactions. So maybe it's better to introduce the nitro group after the activating groups.

Wait, but in this case, the target has two activating groups (tert-butyl and ethoxy), but also a nitro group. So let me think: if I nitrate after adding tert-butyl, then the nitro would be ortho or para to the tert-butyl. But then, if I add ethoxy afterward, the ethoxy will be directed by the existing groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced first, then the tert-butyl, then the nitro. Let me think about that.

Wait, let's think about the directing effects.

1. Adding ethoxy first: Benzene with ethoxy group. Ethoxy is activating, so next substituents would go ortho or para to it.

2. Next, adding tert-butyl via Friedel-Crafts. Since ethoxy is meta/ortho/para director, but wait, ethoxy directs incoming groups to ortho and para. So the tert-butyl would come either ortho or para to the ethoxy.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts can sometimes have issues with activating groups. Wait, no, benzene with an ethoxy group (activating) would undergo Friedel-Crafts alkylation more readily. So after adding ethoxy, adding tert-butyl would direct it to ortho or para.

But in the target, the ethoxy is at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. So, if I first add ethoxy to benzene, then the ring has ethoxy at position 1. Then, adding tert-butyl would go to position 2 (ortho) or position 4 (para). But position 2 is adjacent, so ortho.

So after these two, the substituents are ethoxy (1) and tert-butyl (2). Now, when I introduce the nitro group, it would be directed by the other substituents.

But wait, nitro is a meta director, but which substituent is more influential? The ring has two activating groups, ethoxy and tert-butyl. Nitration is an electrophilic substitution, so the incoming nitro group would go to the position that is activated by the existing groups.

But wait, the existing groups are both activating, so they would direct incoming groups to their ortho and para positions. So positions available would be 3, 4, 5, 6. Let's see:

If ethoxy is at 1, and tert-butyl is at 2, the ring would have substituents at 1 and 2. The positions available are 3,4,5,6. The ethoxy group directs incoming to 2,4,6. The tert-butyl group directs to 1,3,5. So the intersection of the activated positions is perhaps position 3 and 5. So which one would the nitro group go?

Wait, but nitration is a strong electrophile, so perhaps the most activated position is where the nitro group goes.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, there might be steric issues. So, which positions are available. If we have ethoxy at 1, tert-butyl at 2, the next substituent could go at 3 (which is meta to the tert-butyl and adjacent to the ethoxy) or 4 (meta to the ethoxy, which would be position 4, which is para to ethoxy and meta to tert-butyl at 2—position 4 is across from 1, so para to ethoxy. Hmm.

But I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this differently.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the order of substituents based on the possible reaction steps.

Looking at the options, each option provides a series of reactions. Let's see them.

Option A: i) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; ii) HNO3/H2SO4; iii) SO3/H2SO4; iv) NaNO2/HCl; v) dilute H2SO4; vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat; vii) NaOH/EtBr; viii) Fe/HCl; ix) HNO3/H2SO4.

Wait, that seems a lot of steps. Let me think what each step does.

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation: adds tert-butyl to benzene.

ii) Nitration: adds nitro group.

iii) Sulfonation: adds a sulfonic acid group, but why?

iv) Diazotization (NaNO2/HCl): typically for preparing diazonium salts.

v) Dilute H2SO4: acid workup.

vi) H3O+ and heat: hydrolysis of diazonium salt?

vii) NaOH and EtBr: perhaps an SN2 reaction, like ethoxy group substitution.

viii) Fe/HCl: maybe for removing a substituent, like in a Clemmensen reduction, but benzene doesn't have double bonds. Alternatively, maybe it's for dehalogenation, but not sure.

ix) HNO3/H2SO4: another nitration.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated. Let me see if I can model the steps.

Starting with benzene:

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation: adds tert-butyl. Now structure is tert-butylbenzene.

ii) Nitration: nitro group adds. Where? Since tert-butyl is an activating group, ortho/para director. So nitro would go at ortho or para to tert-butyl. Let's imagine it goes to para (position 4), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it goes to ortho (position 2 or 3). Wait, benzene is symmetric. If tert-butyl is on position 1, nitration would occur at ortho (2 or 6) or para (4). Let's say it goes to position 2. So now, structure is 1-tert-butyl-2-nitrobenzene.

But wait, the target has nitro at position 3 relative to ethoxy. Hmm, maybe I'm not on the right track.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitration occurs after adding ethoxy. Wait, but in option A, the order is alkylation first, then nitration.

Wait, let's think about the target molecule. It has three substituents:

At position 1: ethoxy (OCH2CH2CH3)

At position 2: tert-butyl (C(CH3)3)

At position 3: nitro (NO2)

So in the ring, positions 1,2,3 are adjacent to each other.

So the substituents are in 1,2,3 positions. Wait, that's a meta arrangement for some substituents, but adjacent for others.

Hmm. So how to get the nitro in position 3 relative to the ethoxy.

Wait, perhaps the order is ethoxy first, then tert-butyl, then nitro.

But then, after ethoxy is added, the tert-butyl comes next, which would be directed by the ethoxy. Since ethoxy is ortho/para, the tert-butyl could be added either ortho (position 2) or para (position 4) to the ethoxy at position 1. If I add tert-butyl at position 2 (ortho), then the ring has ethoxy at 1 and tert-butyl at 2. Now, adding the nitro group would be influenced by both substituents.

Ethoxy is activating, so it would direct nitro to ortho/para positions (2,4,6). But the tert-butyl is also activating, directing to ortho/para (positions 1,3,5). The intersection of these would be position 3 and 5?

Wait, position 3 is adjacent to the ethoxy (position 1) but also meta to the tert-butyl at position 2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group would go into position 3, which is ortho to tert-butyl and para to ethoxy? Or maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, the next substituent (nitro) would have to go at position 3, which is adjacent to both. But how? Because the ethoxy directs to 2,4,6, and the tert-butyl directs to 1,3,5. So the common positions are 3 and 5? Wait, 3 is adjacent to 2 (tert-butyl) and 4 (which is para to ethoxy). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps when two substituents are present, the most activating group has a greater influence. Ethoxy is a stronger activating group than tert-butyl? Or is it the other way around? Wait, no. Both are activating. Ethoxy is an electron-donating group (due to the oxygen), so it's more activating than alkyl groups? Or is it the other way? Wait, I think alkyl groups are activating via induction, but also through +I effect. But oxygen groups like -OCH2CH3 are stronger activating because of resonance.

So perhaps the ethoxy group is more activating. So when both are present, the incoming nitro group would be directed by the ethoxy group.

So, ethoxy directs to ortho (2,6) and para (4) positions. Now, the ring already has substituents at 1 (ethoxy) and 2 (tert-butyl). So the available positions for nitration would be 3,4,5,6. But ethoxy directs to 2 and 4 (ortho) and 6 (para). But 2 is already taken by tert-butyl. So the next available would be 4 and 6. However, the target has nitro at 3, which is not among these positions. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe I'm not thinking this through correctly. Let's consider the directing effects again. When two substituents are present, the positions where the new substituent can go are determined by where the substituents' activating effects overlap. So, if ethoxy is at 1 and tert-butyl at 2, the nitro group would go where both groups' directing effects allow.

The ethoxy at 1 directs ortho (2 and 6) and para (4). But 2 is already occupied by tert-butyl. So the next available para position would be 4. The tert-butyl at 2 directs ortho (1 and 3) and para (5). So nitration would occur at positions 1,3,5. But position 1 is taken by ethoxy, so the possible positions are 3 and 5.

So the nitro group would go either to position 3 or 5. The target has it at position 3. So if the order is ethoxy, then tert-butyl, then nitro, the nitro would be either at 3 or 5. So let's see.

In the target, nitro is at 3. So if during nitration, it goes to 3, which is ortho to the tert-butyl at 2 and meta to ethoxy at 1.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to nitrate after adding ethoxy and tert-butyl, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to nitrate first, but that might complicate things.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options again. Let's look at the options for the reaction sequences.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4; ii) Fe/HCl; iii) tert-butyl chloride/AlCl3; iv) HNO3/H2SO4; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) SO3/H2SO4; vii) dilute H2SO4; viii) H3O+, H2O/Heat; ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Hmmm. Starting with nitration. So benzene is nitrated. The product is nitrobenzene.

Then Fe/HCl. Hmm, Fe in HCl is often for dissolving something else, maybe a reduction step? Wait, nitrobenzene can be reduced with Fe and HCl to produce aniline. But why would that be needed here?

Wait, but then step iii is Friedel-Crafts alkylation (tert-butyl chloride). So after nitration and reduction, the ring has an amine group (from nitro reduction). But Friedel-Crafts won't work on aniline because the ring is highly deactivated by the -NH2 group, which is strongly activating but in a different way. Wait, no, aniline is strongly activating, but Friedel-Crafts reactions typically require a Lewis acid catalyst, and aniline is more reactive but can undergo alkylation.

Wait, but if you have aniline, adding a tert-butyl group via Friedel-Crafts might be possible, but the position would be directed by the amino group. Aniline is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So the tert-butyl would go either ortho or para to the amino group (which was originally the nitro group).

But then, in the target, the substituents are ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. So this approach doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: introducing a leaving group and then substituting.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is introduced via an SN2 reaction. Oh, but benzene doesn't have a leaving group unless we have a substituent with a good leaving group attached.

Wait, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a substitution reaction. For example, via a benzene ring with a tosyl group, which can be replaced by an ethoxide ion.

Wait, but if I have a nitro group on the ring, which is a strong deactivating group, then the ring is less reactive, making substitution reactions harder. So maybe the ethoxy group is added before the nitro group.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is added after the ethoxy group, because the ethoxy is activating.

Wait, the target has ethoxy, tert-butyl, and nitro. So perhaps the order is ethoxy, tert-butyl, and then nitro.

But I'm not sure. Let me see the options again.

Looking at option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3
ii) HNO3/H2SO4
iii) Fe/HCl
iv) HNO3/H2SO4
v) NaNO2/HCl
vi) H3O+, H2O/Heat
vii) NaOH/EtBr
viii) SO3/H2SO4
ix) dilute H2SO4

Hmm, that's a lot. Let's think step by step.

i) Benzene is alkylated with t-BuCl, AlCl3 to get tert-butylbenzene.

ii) Nitration: adds nitro group. Where? Para or ortho to t-Bu. Suppose para (position 4).

Now, structure is 1-t-Bu-4-nitrobenzene.

iii) Fe/HCl: Fe in HCl is often for reduction. Nitro group can be reduced to amino. So structure becomes 1-t-Bu-4-amino benzene.

iv) HNO3/H2SO4: nitration again. But the ring now has amino group, which is strongly activating. Nitration would occur ortho or para to amino.

But the amino is at position 4. So nitro could go to position 3 or 5 (ortho) or 1 (para). But position 1 has t-Bu, so probably position 3 or 5.

If it goes to position 3, then structure would have t-Bu (1), nitro (4), and another nitro (3)? No, that would be two nitro groups, but the target has only one.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Wait, after step iii, the ring has t-Bu at 1 and amino at 4.

In step iv, another nitration occurs. Let's see where. The amino group is a strong activating, ortho/para director. So nitro would go to positions 3,5 (ortho) or 1 (para). Position 1 is taken by t-Bu, so nitro could go to 3 or 5. Let's say 3.

Now, structure is 1-t-Bu, 4-amino, 3-nitro. Then step v is NaNO2/HCl. That's a diazotization step, turning the amino group into a diazonium salt. So now, the ring has t-Bu (1), diazonium at 4, and nitro at 3.

Step vi: H3O+, H2O, heat. That's a hydrolysis step, which would convert the diazonium group into a hydroxyl group. So structure becomes 1-t-Bu, 4-OH, 3-nitro.

Step vii: NaOH and EtBr. That's an SN2 reaction, replacing the hydroxyl group with ethoxy. So now, 1-t-Bu, 4-ethoxy, 3-nitro.

But the target has ethoxy at position 1, t-Bu at 2, and nitro at 3. So this doesn't match. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the steps.

Wait, perhaps the numbering is different. Maybe the t-Bu is at position 2.

Wait, in the starting steps, benzene is first alkylated with t-BuCl to get t-Bu at position 1. Then nitration adds nitro at position 4. Then reduction gives amino at 4. Then nitration adds nitro at position 3. Then diazotization and hydrolysis produce OH at 4. Then substitution with ethoxy at 4.

So the substituents are t-Bu (1), nitro (3), ethoxy (4). But target has ethoxy at 1, t-Bu at 2, and nitro at 3. So this is not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is different. Let me think about another approach.

The target has ethoxy at position 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3. So, the substituents are adjacent in a 1,2,3 pattern.

So, perhaps the order is:

1. Introduce ethoxy group.

2. Introduce t-Bu group.

3. Introduce nitro group.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But that requires a strongly deactivating group, like a nitro, already present.

Wait, maybe the order is: nitrate first, then t-Bu alkylation, then ethoxy substitution.

But let's think:

Benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene.

Then, Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → but nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts might not proceed. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups, so nitro group makes the ring less reactive. So t-Bu alkylation may not be feasible.

So perhaps that's not the right order.

Alternative approach: introducing ethoxy via a tosylate or another leaving group. Maybe:

First, benzene → tosyl chloride to make benzene tosylate.

Then, substitute with ethoxide. But how to introduce ethoxide—maybe via an SNAr (nucleophilic aromatic substitution). That requires a strongly deactivating group, like nitro, already present.

So perhaps benzene is nitrated first, then ethoxy is added via substitution, then t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

Wait, but after nitration, the ring is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't proceed easily.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy group is added via a nucleophilic substitution after a nitro group is present.

But that's getting complicated.

Wait, maybe the correct sequence is to first add the ethoxy group, then add the t-Bu group, then add the nitro group.

But when adding the nitro group, it's directed by the ethoxy and t-Bu groups.

Wait, after adding ethoxy and t-Bu, the nitro needs to go to position 3. So perhaps the nitration occurs in a position that's ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy.

Wait, let's model it:

After ethoxy at 1 and t-Bu at 2, the nitro group (as a meta director) would be directed by the more activating group.

Wait, but nitration is an electrophilic substitution. So the nitro group is added where the ring is most activated.

The ethoxy group is stronger activating than t-Bu. So it would dominate in directing the nitration.

But wait, the nitro group is a strong deactivating group. So if the ethoxy is at 1, directing ortho (2,6) and para (4), but 2 is occupied by t-Bu, so nitration would go to 4. But the target has nitro at 3, which is adjacent to t-Bu.

Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that after adding ethoxy and t-Bu, the nitro is added in a position that's ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy.

So, ethoxy is at 1, t-Bu at 2. Nitro would be at position 3, which is ortho to t-Bu (position 2) and meta to ethoxy (position 1). That fits the target.

So how to achieve that.

So, the nitration needs to happen such that the nitro group goes to position 3.

But how can the nitration be directed to that position when both ethoxy and t-Bu are present? Since ethoxy is a stronger activating group than t-Bu, perhaps it's the main director.

Wait, but when two substituents are present, the one that is more activating can dominate.

Ethoxy is more activating, so the nitration would be directed by ethoxy. So the nitro group might go para to ethoxy, which is position 4.

But in the target, nitro is at position 3, which isn't para or ortho to ethoxy.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

Option C: i) t-BuCl/AlCl3; ii) SO3/H2SO4; iii) HNO3/H2SO4; iv) Fe/HCl; v) NaNO2/HCl; vi) HNO3/H2SO4; vii) H3O+, H2O/Heat; viii) dilute H2SO4; ix) NaOH/EtBr.

Hmm. Let's go through this.

i) Friedel-Crafts alkylation → tert-butylbenzene.

ii) Sulfonation → adds a sulfonic acid group. So the ring now has t-Bu and SO3H groups.

But why sulfonate? Because sulfonic acid is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. Then step iii is nitration. So with t-Bu (activating, ortho/para) and SO3H (deactivating, meta), the nitration would be directed by the more activating group.

t-Bu is more activating, so nitration would go ortho or para to t-Bu.

So after step iii, nitro is added ortho or para to t-Bu.

But then, in step iv, Fe/HCl. Maybe reduction of the nitro group to amine.

So now, the ring has t-Bu, SO3H, and amino groups.

Then step v: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, then step vi: HNO3/H2SO4? Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, after step v (diazotization), step vi is another nitration? That seems odd.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps step vi is a hydrolysis of the diazonium salt. Wait, step vi is H3O+ and heat, which would hydrolyze the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group.

Then step vii is NaOH and EtBr, which would substitute the hydroxyl with ethoxy.

But I'm not sure. This seems too convoluted, and I'm not sure if it would lead to the correct substituents in the right positions.

Another approach: perhaps the correct answer is option D. Let me think about option D.

Option D: i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amino. So now, aniline.

iii) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts alkylation. But wait, aniline is a strong activating group, so the t-Bu would add at ortho or para to amino.

So after step iii: structure is 1-nitro (reduced to amino?), no, wait: step i is nitration, step ii is reduction.

Wait, step i: nitro group added to benzene → nitrobenzene.

Step ii: Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amino. So structure becomes aniline.

Step iii: Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → adds t-Bu to aniline. Aniline is a strong activating group, so t-Bu would add ortho or para to amino.

So, if amino is at position 1, t-Bu would go to 2 or 4.

Then, step iv: nitration again. Now, the ring has amino (1) and t-Bu (2 or 4). Nitration would be directed by the amino group (since it's more activating) to ortho or para.

If t-Bu is at 2, then amino is at 1. Nitration would go to 3 or 5 (ortho) or 4 (para). So let's say 3.

Now, structure has amino (1), t-Bu (2), nitro (3).

Then step v: NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of amino.

Step vi: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation? Or maybe it's a sulfonation step, but why now?

Wait, step vi: SO3/H2SO4 is sulfonation. So adding a sulfonic acid group.

But the ring already has three substituents, but the target only has three, but maybe this is an extra step.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the steps. This seems complicated.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Wait, the target structure has ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro. So how does that happen in option D's steps?

Let me think again.

Option D steps:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amino → aniline.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation → t-Bu added ortho or para to amino.

Assuming t-Bu is at position 2.

iv) Nitration → adds nitro, now at position 3 (ortho to amino at 1 and adjacent to t-Bu at 2).

v) Diazotization → converts amino (position 1) to diazonium salt.

vi) SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. Hmm, but why sulfonate now? The ring has t-Bu (2), nitro (3), and a diazonium group (1).

Wait, step vi: SO3/H2SO4 → sulfonation. So the ring has three substituents: t-Bu (2), nitro (3), and sulfonic acid (1). Because the diazonium group was at 1, and perhaps the sulfonation occurs there?

Wait, no, the sulfonating agent would add to the activated position. But the ring is now highly substituted and deactivated in some positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the sulfonating step is not needed in the target structure. The target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group, so this step might be for something else.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should think about the options in terms of the steps needed.

The target molecule is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, substituents are:

- 1: ethoxy.

- 2: t-Bu.

- 3: nitro.

So, the order in which these are added should be such that each substituent directs the next correctly.

Let me think of the possible order:

Option: Add t-Bu first. Then ethoxy, then nitro.

But wait, after t-Bu and ethoxy, where would nitro go?

Wait, ethoxy is activating, t-Bu is activating. Nitro is deactivating.

So, if t-Bu is added first, then ethoxy, then nitro.

Wait, let's think:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → t-Bu benzene.

2. Next, introduce ethoxy. How? Perhaps via an SNAr, but the ring is activated by t-Bu, so perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but Friedel-Crafts would require a leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps ethoxy is added via a substitution reaction.

Wait, perhaps we can make a benzene ring with a leaving group, like a tosyl group, and then substitute it with ethoxide. But that would require a directing group.

Alternatively, perhaps ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic substitution after activating the ring with a nitro group. But that seems conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps ethoxy is added via a different method, like using an alkyl halide and a strong base, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution after a nitro group is present. But then, the ring would be deactivated, making substitution difficult.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Ethoxy group first via nucleophilic substitution (like using a tosyl group as a leaving group).

2. Then add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

3. Then add nitro via nitration.

But how to add ethoxy first.

Wait, perhaps benzene is first tosylated (using tosyl chloride), making benzene tosylate. Then, treated with ethoxide (NaOEt) to substitute the tosyl group with ethoxy. That would give ethoxybenzene.

Then, Friedel-Crafts alkylation with t-BuCl → adds t-Bu at ortho or para to ethoxy.

Then, nitration would add nitro at a position directed by ethoxy and t-Bu.

But wait, after ethoxy and t-Bu are added, the nitration would be directed by ethoxy (since it's more activating). So nitro could go to position 2 or 4 (if ethoxy is at 1, t-Bu at 2, then nitro would go to 4, which is para to ethoxy and meta to t-Bu. But target has nitro at 3, which is ortho to t-Bu and meta to ethoxy.

Hmm, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro is added before the ethoxy.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct answer based on the options.

Looking at the options, each has a series of steps. Let's think about when each substituent is added.

The target has ethoxy, t-Bu, and nitro.

In the target, ethoxy is at position 1, t-Bu at 2, nitro at 3.

So, the ethoxy is in the para position relative to t-Bu.

Wait, but no, because 1 and 2 are adjacent. So perhaps the ethoxy is ortho to t-Bu.

Wait, positions 1 and 2 are adjacent, so ethoxy is ortho to t-Bu.

So, the order would be to add t-Bu first, then ethoxy (which would go in the ortho position), then nitro.

So: benzene → t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts → then ethoxy via substitution (but how?) → then nitro via nitration.

Wait, but after adding t-Bu, the ring is activated, so substitution could occur.

Alternatively, perhaps ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that requires a strong deactivating group, which isn't present yet.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a different method, like using an acetate group and then substituting.

But this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the options again.

Option B:

i) t-BuCl/AlCl3 → t-Bu added to benzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitro adds. Let's say para to t-Bu.

iii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amino.

iv) HNO3 → nitro adds again. Where? Amino is ortho/para director. So nitro would go to ortho or para to amino.

v) NaNO2/HCl → diazo.

vi) H3O+/H2O/Heat → hydrolyze diazo to hydroxyl.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → SN2 substitution of OH with ethoxy.

So, the substituents would be t-Bu at 1, nitro at 4, then after reduction, amino at 4. Then nitro again at 3 (ortho to amino), then hydroxyl at 3, then ethoxy at 3.

Wait, so structure would be t-Bu (1), ethoxy (3), and nitro (4). That doesn't match the target.

Option C:

i) t-BuCl → t-Bu benzene.

ii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iii) HNO3 → nitro group.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amino.

v) NaNO2 → diazo.

vi) HNO3 → another nitro.

Wait, this seems to add more substituents, which complicates things.

Option A:

i) t-BuCl → t-Bu benzene.

ii) HNO3 → nitro.

iii) SO3 → sulfonate.

iv) NaNO2 → diazo.

v) H2SO4 → ?

vi) H3O+ → hydrolyze.

vii) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

So, after step ii: nitro added. Let's say para to t-Bu. Then sulfonate is added (SO3), which is a meta director.

Then, diazotization, then hydrolysis to OH, then substitution with ethoxy.

Not sure, but this could result in the ethoxy at a position influenced by the sulfonate.

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the reaction steps needed.

The target is 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene.

So, substituents at 1 (ethoxy), 2 (t-Bu), 3 (nitro).

So, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Ethoxy group added first.

2. Then, t-Bu added.

3. Then, nitro added.

But how to add ethoxy first. Because benzene is not easily substituted, but perhaps via a nucleophilic substitution.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use a directing group to position the substituents correctly.

Wait, another approach: the nitro group is a meta director, so if we have nitro at position 3, then the ethoxy must be at position 1, and t-Bu at 2.

But I'm not getting anywhere quickly. Let me think about the reaction steps in the options.

Looking at option D:

Steps:

i) Nitration → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amino.

iii) Friedel-Crafts alkylation → t-Bu added ortho or para to amino.

iv) Nitration → nitro added ortho or para to amino.

v) Diazotization → amino to diazonium.

vi) SO3 → sulfonate.

vii) dilute H2SO4 → ?

viii) H3O+ → hydrolysis.

ix) NaOH/EtBr → substitution.

Wait, after step iv, the ring has amino (position 1), t-Bu (2), and nitro (3). Then step v: diazo, which converts amino to diazonium. Step vi: sulfonate—adds a sulfonic acid group where? Maybe at position 4.

But the target doesn't have a sulfonic acid group. So this seems off.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B.

Wait, after step vii in option B, the ethoxy is added via substitution, which would be at the position where the OH was.

So, after steps i to vii:

t-Bu (1), nitro (4), then reduction to amino (4), then nitro again (3), then hydroxyl (3), then ethoxy (3).

So, substituents are t-Bu (1), nitro (4), ethoxy (3). Doesn't match the target.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct option is option D. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, looking at the target structure, to get ethoxy at 1, t-Bu at 2, and nitro at 3, perhaps the steps would be:

1. Add t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

2. Add nitro via nitration, directed by t-Bu to position 3.

3. Add ethoxy via substitution, perhaps after introducing a leaving group.

But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via an SN2 reaction, but that requires a good leaving group which is not present unless we create it.

Wait, another approach: after adding t-Bu and nitro, perform a substitution to add ethoxy.

But in the target, the nitro is at 3. So after adding t-Bu and nitro, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a substitution.

Wait, but benzene with t-Bu and nitro groups would be deactivated, making substitution difficult.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethoxy is added via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution after activating the ring. But that's tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Add nitro.

2. Add t-Bu.

3. Add ethoxy via substitution.

But then, the nitro is a deactivating group, making substitution difficult.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

1. Introduce a nitro group.

2. Introduce ethoxy via substitution.

3. Introduce t-Bu via Friedel-Crafts.

But Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group; the ring would have nitro and ethoxy. Nitro deactivates, ethoxy activates. So perhaps the ring is still reactive enough for Friedel-Crafts.

So, after nitro and ethoxy are added, t-Bu would go to a position directed by ethoxy.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B, but I'm not confident.

After thinking through all this, I think the correct option is option D. Because in option D, after nitration and reduction, the t-Bu is added, then another nitration, leading to substituents that can be manipulated via diazotization and substitution to reach the target.


To synthesize 2-(tert-butyl)-1-ethoxy-3-nitrobenzene starting from benzene, the sequence of reactions must carefully direct the introduction of substituents to achieve the desired positions: ethoxy at position 1, tert-butyl at position 2, and nitro at position 3. The order of adding substituents and their directing effects are critical, as activating groups like tert-butyl and ethoxy direct incoming substituents to ortho and para positions, while deactivating groups like nitro direct to meta positions.

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **t-BuCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds tert-butyl to benzene.
2. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds a nitro group, likely ortho or para to tert-butyl.
3. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is unnecessary for the target structure.
4. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization converts an amine (if present) to a diazonium salt.
5. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group.
6. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitutes the hydroxyl group with ethoxy.
7. **Fe/HCl**: Likely reduces a nitro group, but this step is unclear in the context of the target structure.
8. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Another nitration step, which complicates the synthesis.

This sequence introduces unnecessary steps (e.g., sulfonation) and does not clearly lead to the target structure.

#### **Option B**:
1. **t-BuCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds tert-butyl to benzene.
2. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds a nitro group, likely ortho or para to tert-butyl.
3. **Fe/HCl**: Reduces the nitro group to an amino group.
4. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Another nitration step, which could add a second nitro group.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization converts the amino group to a diazonium salt.
6. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group.
7. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitutes the hydroxyl group with ethoxy.
8. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is unnecessary for the target structure.
9. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Acid workup.

This sequence introduces a second nitro group and a sulfonic acid group, which are not part of the target structure. It does not achieve the correct substituent positions.

#### **Option C**:
1. **t-BuCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds tert-butyl to benzene.
2. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is unnecessary for the target structure.
3. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds a nitro group.
4. **Fe/HCl**: Reduces the nitro group to an amino group.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization converts the amino group to a diazonium salt.
6. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Another nitration step, which complicates the synthesis.
7. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group.
8. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Acid workup.
9. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitutes the hydroxyl group with ethoxy.

This sequence introduces a sulfonic acid group and a second nitro group, which are not part of the target structure. It does not achieve the correct substituent positions.

#### **Option D**:
1. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration adds a nitro group to benzene.
2. **Fe/HCl**: Reduces the nitro group to an amino group.
3. **t-BuCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts alkylation adds tert-butyl to the ring.
4. **HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Another nitration step adds a nitro group.
5. **NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization converts the amino group to a diazonium salt.
6. **SO₃/H₂SO₄**: Sulfonation adds a sulfonic acid group, which is unnecessary for the target structure.
7. **dilute H₂SO₄**: Acid workup.
8. **H₃O⁺, H₂O/Heat**: Hydrolyzes the diazonium salt to a hydroxyl group.
9. **NaOH/EtBr**: Substitutes the hydroxyl group with ethoxy.

This sequence introduces a sulfonic acid group and does not clearly achieve the correct substituent positions.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences perfectly match the target structure. However, **Option D** comes closest, as it involves nitration, reduction, and Friedel-Crafts alkylation steps that could potentially lead to the desired substituents. Despite introducing a sulfonic acid group, it aligns more closely with the required transformations than the other options.

Answer: D
