Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A to D with numbers 1, 3, 5, 0. Hmm.

Alright, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is calculated based on the formula: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Where C is the number of carbons, H hydrogens, X halogens, and N nitrogens. But in this case, the product probably doesn't have X or N, so I can ignore that part.

But wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh right, that's the Hunsdiecker reaction, I think. Or wait, maybe it's a different type of reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are generally used for the dehydrohalogenation or maybe for elimination. Wait, no, wait a second. Red phosphorus with I2 and HI—wait, perhaps it's a Wittig reaction setup? Or maybe it's a reaction where the double bonds are being modified.

Wait, no, wait. Another thought: when you have a carboxylic acid and treat it with H-I and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a decarboxylation reaction. Because I remember that when a carboxylic acid is treated with a strong reducing agent, like H2/Pd or something else, it might lose CO2. But red phosphorus and HI might be part of the reaction conditions for decarboxylation.

Wait, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So it's a cyclohexene ring (so three double bonds?), but wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So the parent is cyclohexene substituted with other groups.

Let me draw it out mentally. The main ring is cyclohexene, which is a cyclohexane ring with a double bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 is a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 is a vinyl group (CH2CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH- as a substituent. Oh wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so the substituent is a CH2CH2 group? Or no, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So at position 5, there's a vinyl group, meaning a CH2CH2 group, but with a double bond. Wait, no: if it's 5-vinyl, that means a substituent like -CH2-CH2-? No, no, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached via the CH2. So the group is CH2-CH2 with a double bond next to it? Hmm, perhaps I should think of the structure.

But wait, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation. Carboxylic acids can undergo decarboxylation under certain conditions. For example, when heated with a strong base like KOH, but in this case, it's red phosphorus and HI. Wait, red phosphorus and HI together might be part of a reaction to form a ylide or something else, but maybe it's more about the elimination.

Alternatively, I've heard that when a carboxylic acid is treated with a strong reducing agent like HI in presence of red phosphorus, it might lead to the formation of an alkane or something else. Or perhaps it's a way to reduce the carboxylic acid group.

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and excess HI. Another thought: maybe it's a reaction to reduce the double bonds. Because red phosphorus is sometimes used to reduce double bonds, like in the Hunsdiecker reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehalogenation, but that doesn't quite fit.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a diels-alder type, but that's not it. Or maybe a hydrohalogenation, but with excess HI, perhaps it's adding across double bonds.

Alternatively, considering that the starting material has a cyclohexene ring (so a double bond), a formyl group, and a vinyl group (another double bond). So the molecule has three rings but wait, no, it's a cyclohexene ring with substituents. The substituents are formyl (CHO) and vinyl (CH2CH2 with a double bond attached at the 5 position).

So the double bonds present are the cyclohexene ring (1 double bond), the vinyl group (another double bond), and the formyl group is a carbonyl (which is a double bond as well). So in the starting material, how many double bonds are there?

Wait, the structure is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene is at position 3, meaning the ring has a double bond between 3 and 4 (assuming 1,2,3,4 numbering around the ring). The substituents are at 2 (formyl) and 5 (vinyl). So the formyl is a carbonyl group, which is a double bond, and the vinyl is a CH2-CH2 group but with the double bond between the two CH2 groups, right? So the vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring.

So the starting molecule has three double bonds: the cyclohexene ring, the formyl group, and the vinyl group. So the initial molecule has three double bonds, which contribute to the hydrogen deficiency.

But when the reaction occurs, how does that change? The reaction uses red phosphorus and excess HI. I'm trying to recall what this might do. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I don't see any halogens here. Wait, maybe it's the cleavage of double bonds.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI are used in the presence of a halogen to make the Hunsdiecker reaction, which leads to elimination. But without a halogen, perhaps it's a different scenario. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction that reduces the double bonds.

Wait, I think I remember that red phosphorus can be used in the Birch reduction, but that usually involves ammonia and other conditions. Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the reaction is a catalytic hydrogenation, but I don't think red phosphorus is a catalyst for hydrogenation.

Alternatively, maybe this is a Hofmann elimination or something similar. Hofmann uses a base, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation. But that would add OH groups across double bonds, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another angle: the product's index of hydrogen deficiency. So regardless of the reaction, how many rings and double bonds does the product have?

The starting material has a cyclohexene ring (so one ring, one double bond). The formyl group is a carbonyl (another double bond). The vinyl group is another double bond. So three double bonds in the starting structure.

Now, the reaction: if we're adding HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a situation where the double bonds are being hydrogenated or modified.

Wait, I think I'm going off track. Let me think about the reaction conditions again. Red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh! Wait, perhaps it's a reaction where the carboxylic acid group is converted into something else. For example, the acid could be converted to an alkane by reducing the COOH group.

Wait, but how? Carboxylic acids are typically not reduced under such conditions. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a decarboxylation. For example, when a carboxylic acid is heated with a strong base, it can lose CO2. But under what conditions does it lose CO2 with HI and red phosphorus?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis, but that wouldn't change the number of double bonds.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus can sometimes be used as a reducing agent. So perhaps it's a reduction of the double bonds. For example, the vinyl group's double bond and the cyclohexene ring's double bond are being reduced.

So, if all the double bonds are reduced, then the product would be a cyclohexane ring (no double bond), the formyl group would become a CH2OH group (wait no, formyl is CHO, reducing that would give CH2OH?), but wait, no, the formyl group is a carbonyl. If reduced with red phosphorus and HI, which is a strong reducing agent, perhaps the carbonyl groups are being reduced.

Wait, let me clarify. HI is a strong acid and can act as a reducing agent. Red phosphorus can facilitate certain reductions. For example, in the presence of HI, red phosphorus can reduce aldehydes to alkanes. Wait, I think that when an aldehyde is treated with HI and red phosphorus, the aldehyde group is converted into a methylene group (-CH2-). So the CHO group would become CH2I, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's converted into CH2OH, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me get this straight. The formyl group is CHO. If we reduce it using HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it becomes CH2OH. But then that would still have a double bond elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is converted into a primary alcohol, but in this case, maybe more.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but without any halides in the starting material, that's not possible. So maybe the reaction is a substitution, but I can't see any leaving groups here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening. But the starting material is a cyclohexene ring; maybe the double bond will be hydrogenated, and the substituents will be modified.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions are causing the vinyl group and the cyclohexene ring's double bonds to be hydrogenated. So the cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane, and the vinyl group becomes a single bond (CH2CH2).

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI don't supply hydrogen. So perhaps it's not hydrogenation. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihalogenation, but that would add halogens.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each part of the molecule.

The main molecule: cyclohexene ring with substituents at 2 (CHO) and 5 (vinyl, CH2=CH-).

The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. So, perhaps each double bond is reacting.

Wait, I think I've heard that when a dienophile is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it might induce some addition. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrohalogenation of the double bonds.

Wait, for the cyclohexene ring, adding HI could lead to a dihydroxylation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an addition across the double bonds.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI might be used in a reaction called the Witting reaction, which is for forming alkenes from aldehydes, but I'm not sure that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product. What would the product look like after this reaction?

The starting material has a carboxylic acid group (COOH). When treated with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the COOH group is converted into something else. Alternatively, maybe it's decarboxylated.

Wait, decarboxylation of a carboxylic acid typically requires heat and a base. But in this case, the conditions are with HI and red phosphorus. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a reduction of the carboxylic acid to a methyl group. Wait, but carboxylic acids are generally not reduced under such conditions. Wait, I think I remember that when a carboxylic acid is treated with H2 and a catalyst, it can be reduced to a primary alcohol. But with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a different scenario.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group (CHO) to CH2OH. So, the formyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group.

But then, what about the other double bonds, like the cyclohexene and the vinyl groups?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is leading to the formation of a ylide, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but without any halides present, that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's count the degree of unsaturation of the starting material first.

The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The formula can be broken down as follows: cyclohexene (C6H9O2?), wait no. Let's think: cyclohexene is C6H10. But wait, with substituents.

The formula would be C6H8O2 plus substituents. Let me compute the molecular formula.

The parent is cyclohexene, which is C6H10. But with substituents: formyl (CHO) adds one C and one O. The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) adds two Cs and one double bond. Wait, but the cyclohexene ring already has one double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the molecular formula.

The molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down:

Cyclohexene ring: 6 carbons, with one double bond → formula C6H10.

But substituents are at positions 2 and 5.

At position 2: formyl group (CHO) → which is OCHO- attached to the ring. So that adds one C, one O, and no Hs (since it's a substituent replacing a H).

At position 5: vinyl group (CH2=CH-) → which is CH2CH2, but with a double bond. So that's two carbons, and the group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So formula adds two Cs and three Hs (since the ring had a CH2 there; now it's CH2-CH2, but with a double bond).

Wait, maybe better to count each part.

The cyclohexene ring without substituents is C6H10.

Each substituent adds:

Formyl (CHO): 1 C, 1 O, and 0 H (since it replaces an H on the ring).

Vinyl (CH2=CH-): 2 C, 1 O? No, wait, vinyl is just CH2=CH-. So, 2 C, 3 H (since the substituent is CH2-CH2, but the exact H count would depend on substitution).

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is:

C6 (ring) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) = 9 C.

The ring has 6 C, formyl adds 1, vinyl adds 2: total 9 C.

Hydrogen: the ring is C6H10. Each substituent:

Formyl: each substituent replaces a H on the ring. So, for the formyl group: the ring has 10 H, but substituents take away 2 (since two substituents are present? No, each substituent replaces one H). Wait, the molecule has two substituents (formyl and vinyl), so each replaces a H on the ring.

So original ring H: 10.

Minus 2 H (two substituents) → 8 H.

Now, substituents: formyl (CHO) has two H (the H from CHO is the aldehyde H, but the substituent is -CHO, which has no additional H besides the aldehyde. Wait, no: the substituent is -CHO, which is a carbonyl group. So each substituent adds Hs?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the molecular formula.

Each substituent:

Formyl (CHO): adds 1 C, 1 O, and 0 H (since it's -CHO, which has no H attached except the aldehyde H, which is part of the group but not adding H to the ring).

Vinyl (CH₂=CH-): adds 2 C, and the substituent has 3 H (CH₂-CH₂, but with a double bond, so maybe the substituent has 3 H: the CH₂ has 2 H, and the CH₂ attached to the ring has 1 H? Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the entire molecule.

The formula for 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid would be:

The cyclohexene ring is C6H8 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene, which is C6H10 minus two H, but I'm not sure). Wait, no, cyclohexene is C6H10. But with substituents, it would lose some H.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute:

Each double bond reduces the number of H by 2 per double bond.

The starting material has:

1. Cyclohexene: 1 double bond → 6 C, 10 H → but with substituents, it's C6H8 with substituents.

But maybe the overall formula is C9H8O2.

Wait, the cyclohexene ring is C6H8 (since it has one double bond). Then, the formyl adds a CHO group, which is C=O. The vinyl adds a CH2CH2 group but with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should just calculate the molecular formula.

The parent is cyclohexene (C6H10).

Substituents:

At position 2: formyl (CHO) → adds 1 C, 1 O, and 0 H (since it's replacing a H on the ring). So the ring now has 6 C, 10 H - 1 H (from substituent) → 9 H.

At position 5: vinyl (CH₂=CH-) → adds 2 C, 3 H (since the substituent is -CH₂-CH₂, but with a double bond, so perhaps the substituent contributes 3 H. Wait, the substituent is CH₂=CH- attached to the ring, so the structure is:

Ring C5H9-CH₂-CH₂? No, the substituent is CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH₂-CH₂, but with a double bond, so it's CH₂=CH- attached to the ring. So the substituent is -(CH₂)₂, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups.

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let's calculate the molecular formula:

Number of carbons: 6 (ring) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) = 9 C.

Number of oxygens: 2 (from carboxylic acid (COOH) and formyl (CHO)).

Number of hydrogens: let's compute.

The cyclohexene ring without substituents has 10 H. Each substituent replaces one H.

So 10 H - 2 H (two substituents) = 8 H.

Now, substituents:

Formyl (CHO) has one H (the aldehyde H) → but that's part of the substituent.

Vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) has 3 H: each CH2 has two H, but the double bond doesn't have H. Wait, the substituent is CH₂-CH₂, but with a double bond. So the structure is CH₂=CH- attached to the ring.

So substituent's H: the first CH₂ (attached to ring) has 2 H, the second CH₂ (with double bond) has 1 H (since it's CH₂=CH- → the CH2 group has two H, but the CH is attached to the double bond, which has one H).

Wait, perhaps the substituent contributes a total of 3 H: 2 from the first CH2 and 1 from the CH2 in the vinyl group.

So the substituent adds 3 H. So total H in molecule:

8 (from ring) + 3 (from substituent) + 1 (from formyl's H) + 2 (from COOH group? Wait, the COOH group is -COOH, which has 2 O's and the formula is -COOH, so it has two O's. The COOH has two H's: the -OH and the H from the COOH.

Wait, I'm getting myself into a tangle. Let me think: the molecular formula of the starting material is C9H8O2.

Wait, because:

Cyclohexene: C6H10.

Each substituent:

Formyl: adds 1 C, 1 O, and 0 H (since it replaces a H on the ring). So, H count remains same minus 1: 10 -1=9.

Wait, but then the substituent brings in the formyl group, which has its own H. The formyl is CHO → so the substituent contributes 1 H (the aldehyde H). So H becomes 9 +1 =10.

Wait, but this seems complicated. Maybe I should compute it using the formula for the molecule.

The molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down:

- Cyclohexene: C6H10 (since it's a six-membered ring with one double bond).
- The carboxylic acid group is at position 3 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene carboxylic acid). Wait, no, the position is 3 for the cyclohexene, and the carboxylic acid is at position x.

Wait, maybe I should think of the substituents: formyl at 2, vinyl at 5, and the carboxylic acid group where?

Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring is numbered such that the double bond is between C3 and C4. The substituents are at C2 (formyl) and C5 (vinyl). The carboxylic acid group is at another position. Wait, wait, no: the ring is cyclohexene, and the suffix is -carboxylic acid, which means the carboxylic acid group is attached to the ring. So the ring has substituents at 2 (formyl), 3 (the double bond), and 5 (vinyl). Wait, that can't be; perhaps the carboxylic acid is at position 1, but the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, so the COOH is at position 1, and the double bond is between 3 and 4.

So the substituents are at positions 2 (CHO), 5 (CH2=CH-), and 1 (COOH). Hmm.

Now, the molecular formula:

Each substituent adds:

COOH: adds 2 O and 2 H (since it's -COOH: has two O's and the H from -OH and the H from the COOH group. Wait, not sure.

But perhaps the formula is C9H8O2.

Assuming the formula is C9H8O2, let's compute the degree of unsaturation.

DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

Here, C=9, H=8, X=0 (no halogens), N=0.

So DoU = (2*9 +2 -8 -0 +0)/2 = (20-8)/2= 12/2=6.

So the starting material has 6 degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, but that's not right. Because the starting material has a cyclohexene ring (1 DoU), a formyl group (1 DoU), and a vinyl group (1 DoU), plus the COOH group (which is a carbonyl, another DoU). Wait, wait:

COOH is a carbonyl (one DoU). The cyclohexene ring is a DoU (1). The formyl group (CHO) is another DoU (1). The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is another DoU (1). So that's four DoU.

Wait, but according to the formula, it's 6 DoU. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recount.

Wait, the formula is C9H8O2.

DoU = (2*9 +2 -8)/2 = (20 -8)/2=6.

So six DoU. Each DoU can be a ring or a double bond or a triple bond.

In the starting molecule:

1. Cyclohexene ring (1 DoU).
2. COOH group (1 DoU).
3. Formyl group (1 DoU).
4. Vinyl group (1 DoU).
5. The cyclohexene has a double bond (already counted as 1).
Wait, wait, no. Wait, the cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond, which is one DoU (a ring plus a double bond counts as two DoU? No, a ring is one, a double bond is another. So the cyclohexene ring has two DoU: one for the ring, one for the double bond. Wait no, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The formula DoU counts each ring and each pi bond or triple bond as one DoU. So a cyclohexene (a six-membered ring with one double bond) would have two DoU? No, wait, no. Because a six-membered ring has one DoU (since it's a ring), and the double bond adds another. So that's two DoU.

So the starting material's DoU:

1. Cyclohexene: 2 DoU (ring + double bond).
2. COOH: 1 DoU (carbonyl).
3. Formyl: 1 DoU (carbonyl).
4. Vinyl group: 1 DoU.
Total: 2 +1 +1 +1 =5 DoU? But according to the formula, it's 6. So I'm missing one.

Wait, perhaps the COOH group is considered as two DoU? No, no. COOH is a carbonyl, so that's one DoU.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the formula. Let me think again: the formula is C9H8O2.

DoU= (2*9 +2 -8)/2= (20-8)/2=6.

So, 6 DoU.

The molecule has:

- Cyclohexene ring: 2 DoU (ring and double bond).
- COOH: 1 DoU.
- Formyl: 1 DoU.
- Vinyl: 1 DoU.
Total: 2+1+1+1=5 DoU. Hmm, but the formula gives 6. So where's the sixth DoU?

Ah, wait, maybe the COOH group is a carbonyl (1 DoU), but perhaps the molecule has another double bond or ring. Or perhaps I'm counting wrong.

Wait, the starting molecule has a cyclohexene ring with substituents. So the ring contributes 2 DoU (one for the ring, one for the double bond), the COOH contributes 1, formyl contributes 1, and the vinyl contributes 1. That's 5 DoU. But the formula says 6. So perhaps I've missed another DoU. Maybe the carboxylic acid group is in a position that creates another ring or something else?

Alternatively, maybe the substituents cause another double bond. Or perhaps the ring is a bicyclic structure, but that's unlikely given the name.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed under the assumption that the starting material's DoU is 6.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I need to figure out what happens to each part.

Assuming that the reaction reduces the double bonds. Like, the cyclohexene's double bond is hydrogenated, the vinyl group's double bond is hydrogenated, and the formyl group is reduced.

So, the product would have:

- Cyclohexane (no double bond, one ring → 1 DoU).
- The formyl group (CHO) is reduced to CH2OH, which is a single bond, so that's 0 DoU (since it's a single bond, no ring, no double bond).
- The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is hydrogenated to CH2CH2, so single bond; 0 DoU.
- The COOH group: what happens to it? COOH could be reduced. For example, with H2 and a catalyst, COOH becomes CH2OH. But with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a different reaction. Maybe the COOH is decarboxylated.

Wait, another approach: if the reaction is a decarboxylation, the COOH group is converted into a CH2 group. So, the COOH (one DoU) becomes CH2 (single bond), so one less DoU.

So, the product would have:

- Cyclohexane: 1 DoU.
- Formyl group reduced to CH2OH: 0 DoU.
- Vinyl group reduced to CH2CH2: 0 DoU.
- COOH group converted to CH2: 0 DoU.

So total DoU in product: only the cyclohexane ring → 1 DoU.

Wait, but earlier I thought the starting material had 6 DoU, and if after reaction, the product has 1 DoU, that would make the answer 1, which is option A.

But wait, what else happens. Let me think:

If the reaction conditions reduce all the double bonds:

- Cyclohexene → cyclohexane (1 DoU from ring).
- Formyl group (CHO) → CH2OH (no DoU).
- Vinyl group (CH2=CH-) → CH2CH2 (no DoU).
- COOH group → perhaps it's decarboxylated to CH2.

So the product would have only the cyclohexane ring as the source of DoU, which is 1.

So the product's DoU is 1.

But wait, what about the COOH group? If it's decarboxylated, it becomes a CH2 group, which doesn't contribute to DoU. So the product is a cyclohexane ring with substituents at 2 (CH2OH), 5 (CH2CH2), and 1 (CH2).

But wait, the cyclohexane ring itself contributes 1 DoU (the ring, no double bonds).

So the product's DoU is 1, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (degree of unsaturation, DoU) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. 

### Key Analysis:

1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. It contains:
   - A cyclohexene ring (C6H10), which contributes 2 DoU (1 for the ring and 1 for the double bond).
   - A formyl group (CHO) at position 2, contributing 1 DoU (carbonyl group).
   - A vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at position 5, contributing 1 DoU (double bond).
   - A carboxylic acid group (COOH) at position 3, contributing 1 DoU (carbonyl group).  
   Total DoU of the starting material = 2 (cyclohexene) + 1 (formyl) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (COOH) = **5 DoU**.

2. **Reaction Conditions**:  
   The reaction involves red phosphorus and excess HI. Red phosphorus is a reducing agent, and HI is a strong acid. These conditions typically reduce double bonds and functional groups:
   - The cyclohexene ring's double bond is reduced to a single bond, converting the ring into cyclohexane.
   - The formyl group (CHO) is reduced to CH2OH.
   - The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is reduced to CH2CH2.
   - The carboxylic acid group (COOH) is reduced to CH2.

3. **Structure of the Product**:  
   After the reaction, the product is a cyclohexane ring with the following substituents:
   - A hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 2.
   - An ethyl group (-CH2CH2-) at position 5.
   - A methyl group (-CH2-) at position 3.  
   The product contains only the cyclohexane ring, which contributes 1 DoU (from the ring).

4. **Degree of Unsaturation of the Product**:  
   The product has no double bonds or triple bonds, and the only source of unsaturation is the cyclohexane ring. Therefore, the product has **1 degree of unsaturation**.

### Conclusion:  
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **1**.

**Answer: A**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed from a reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. The options are A to D with numbers 1, 3, 5, 0. Hmm.

Alright, I remember that the index of hydrogen deficiency (also known as the degree of unsaturation) is calculated based on the formula: Degree of Unsaturation (DoU) = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Where C is the number of carbons, H hydrogens, X halogens, and N nitrogens. But in this case, the product probably doesn't have X or N, so I can ignore that part.

But wait, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh right, that's the Hunsdiecker reaction, I think. Or wait, maybe it's a different type of reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are generally used for the dehydrohalogenation or maybe for elimination. Wait, no, wait a second. Red phosphorus with I2 and HI—wait, perhaps it's a Wittig reaction setup? Or maybe it's a reaction where the double bonds are being modified.

Wait, no, wait. Another thought: when you have a carboxylic acid and treat it with H-I and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a decarboxylation reaction. Because I remember that when a carboxylic acid is treated with a strong reducing agent, like H2/Pd or something else, it might lose CO2. But red phosphorus and HI might be part of the reaction conditions for decarboxylation.

Wait, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So it's a cyclohexene ring (so three double bonds?), but wait, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So the parent is cyclohexene substituted with other groups.

Let me draw it out mentally. The main ring is cyclohexene, which is a cyclohexane ring with a double bond. The substituents are at positions 2 and 5. Position 2 is a formyl group (CHO), and position 5 is a vinyl group (CH2CH2? Wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH- as a substituent. Oh wait, vinyl is CH2=CH-, so the substituent is a CH2CH2 group? Or no, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So at position 5, there's a vinyl group, meaning a CH2CH2 group, but with a double bond. Wait, no: if it's 5-vinyl, that means a substituent like -CH2-CH2-? No, no, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached via the CH2. So the group is CH2-CH2 with a double bond next to it? Hmm, perhaps I should think of the structure.

But wait, perhaps the reaction is a decarboxylation. Carboxylic acids can undergo decarboxylation under certain conditions. For example, when heated with a strong base like KOH, but in this case, it's red phosphorus and HI. Wait, red phosphorus and HI together might be part of a reaction to form a ylide or something else, but maybe it's more about the elimination.

Alternatively, I've heard that when a carboxylic acid is treated with a strong reducing agent like HI in presence of red phosphorus, it might lead to the formation of an alkane or something else. Or perhaps it's a way to reduce the carboxylic acid group.

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and excess HI. Another thought: maybe it's a reaction to reduce the double bonds. Because red phosphorus is sometimes used to reduce double bonds, like in the Hunsdiecker reaction, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehalogenation, but that doesn't quite fit.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a diels-alder type, but that's not it. Or maybe a hydrohalogenation, but with excess HI, perhaps it's adding across double bonds.

Alternatively, considering that the starting material has a cyclohexene ring (so a double bond), a formyl group, and a vinyl group (another double bond). So the molecule has three rings but wait, no, it's a cyclohexene ring with substituents. The substituents are formyl (CHO) and vinyl (CH2CH2 with a double bond attached at the 5 position).

So the double bonds present are the cyclohexene ring (1 double bond), the vinyl group (another double bond), and the formyl group is a carbonyl (which is a double bond as well). So in the starting material, how many double bonds are there?

Wait, the structure is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene is at position 3, meaning the ring has a double bond between 3 and 4 (assuming 1,2,3,4 numbering around the ring). The substituents are at 2 (formyl) and 5 (vinyl). So the formyl is a carbonyl group, which is a double bond, and the vinyl is a CH2-CH2 group but with the double bond between the two CH2 groups, right? So the vinyl group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring.

So the starting molecule has three double bonds: the cyclohexene ring, the formyl group, and the vinyl group. So the initial molecule has three double bonds, which contribute to the hydrogen deficiency.

But when the reaction occurs, how does that change? The reaction uses red phosphorus and excess HI. I'm trying to recall what this might do. Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation, but I don't see any halogens here. Wait, maybe it's the cleavage of double bonds.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus and HI are used in the presence of a halogen to make the Hunsdiecker reaction, which leads to elimination. But without a halogen, perhaps it's a different scenario. Alternatively, perhaps it's a reaction that reduces the double bonds.

Wait, I think I remember that red phosphorus can be used in the Birch reduction, but that usually involves ammonia and other conditions. Alternatively, perhaps in this case, the reaction is a catalytic hydrogenation, but I don't think red phosphorus is a catalyst for hydrogenation.

Alternatively, maybe this is a Hofmann elimination or something similar. Hofmann uses a base, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dihydroxylation. But that would add OH groups across double bonds, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another angle: the product's index of hydrogen deficiency. So regardless of the reaction, how many rings and double bonds does the product have?

The starting material has a cyclohexene ring (so one ring, one double bond). The formyl group is a carbonyl (another double bond). The vinyl group is another double bond. So three double bonds in the starting structure.

Now, the reaction: if we're adding HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a situation where the double bonds are being hydrogenated or modified.

Wait, I think I'm going off track. Let me think about the reaction conditions again. Red phosphorus and excess HI. Oh! Wait, perhaps it's a reaction where the carboxylic acid group is converted into something else. For example, the acid could be converted to an alkane by reducing the COOH group.

Wait, but how? Carboxylic acids are typically not reduced under such conditions. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a decarboxylation. For example, when a carboxylic acid is heated with a strong base, it can lose CO2. But under what conditions does it lose CO2 with HI and red phosphorus?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a hydrolysis, but that wouldn't change the number of double bonds.

Wait, another thought: red phosphorus can sometimes be used as a reducing agent. So perhaps it's a reduction of the double bonds. For example, the vinyl group's double bond and the cyclohexene ring's double bond are being reduced.

So, if all the double bonds are reduced, then the product would be a cyclohexane ring (no double bond), the formyl group would become a CH2OH group (wait no, formyl is CHO, reducing that would give CH2OH?), but wait, no, the formyl group is a carbonyl. If reduced with red phosphorus and HI, which is a strong reducing agent, perhaps the carbonyl groups are being reduced.

Wait, let me clarify. HI is a strong acid and can act as a reducing agent. Red phosphorus can facilitate certain reductions. For example, in the presence of HI, red phosphorus can reduce aldehydes to alkanes. Wait, I think that when an aldehyde is treated with HI and red phosphorus, the aldehyde group is converted into a methylene group (-CH2-). So the CHO group would become CH2I, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's converted into CH2OH, but I'm not certain.

Wait, let me get this straight. The formyl group is CHO. If we reduce it using HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it becomes CH2OH. But then that would still have a double bond elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is converted into a primary alcohol, but in this case, maybe more.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but without any halides in the starting material, that's not possible. So maybe the reaction is a substitution, but I can't see any leaving groups here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a ring-opening. But the starting material is a cyclohexene ring; maybe the double bond will be hydrogenated, and the substituents will be modified.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction conditions are causing the vinyl group and the cyclohexene ring's double bonds to be hydrogenated. So the cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane, and the vinyl group becomes a single bond (CH2CH2).

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI don't supply hydrogen. So perhaps it's not hydrogenation. Alternatively, maybe it's a dihalogenation, but that would add halogens.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each part of the molecule.

The main molecule: cyclohexene ring with substituents at 2 (CHO) and 5 (vinyl, CH2=CH-).

The reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. So, perhaps each double bond is reacting.

Wait, I think I've heard that when a dienophile is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it might induce some addition. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrohalogenation of the double bonds.

Wait, for the cyclohexene ring, adding HI could lead to a dihydroxylation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's an addition across the double bonds.

Wait, but red phosphorus and HI might be used in a reaction called the Witting reaction, which is for forming alkenes from aldehydes, but I'm not sure that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product. What would the product look like after this reaction?

The starting material has a carboxylic acid group (COOH). When treated with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the COOH group is converted into something else. Alternatively, maybe it's decarboxylated.

Wait, decarboxylation of a carboxylic acid typically requires heat and a base. But in this case, the conditions are with HI and red phosphorus. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a reduction of the carboxylic acid to a methyl group. Wait, but carboxylic acids are generally not reduced under such conditions. Wait, I think I remember that when a carboxylic acid is treated with H2 and a catalyst, it can be reduced to a primary alcohol. But with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a different scenario.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the carbonyl group (CHO) to CH2OH. So, the formyl group becomes a hydroxymethyl group.

But then, what about the other double bonds, like the cyclohexene and the vinyl groups?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is leading to the formation of a ylide, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but without any halides present, that doesn't make sense.

Hmm, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's count the degree of unsaturation of the starting material first.

The starting molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

The formula can be broken down as follows: cyclohexene (C6H9O2?), wait no. Let's think: cyclohexene is C6H10. But wait, with substituents.

The formula would be C6H8O2 plus substituents. Let me compute the molecular formula.

The parent is cyclohexene, which is C6H10. But with substituents: formyl (CHO) adds one C and one O. The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) adds two Cs and one double bond. Wait, but the cyclohexene ring already has one double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the molecular formula.

The molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down:

Cyclohexene ring: 6 carbons, with one double bond → formula C6H10.

But substituents are at positions 2 and 5.

At position 2: formyl group (CHO) → which is OCHO- attached to the ring. So that adds one C, one O, and no Hs (since it's a substituent replacing a H).

At position 5: vinyl group (CH2=CH-) → which is CH2CH2, but with a double bond. So that's two carbons, and the group is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So formula adds two Cs and three Hs (since the ring had a CH2 there; now it's CH2-CH2, but with a double bond).

Wait, maybe better to count each part.

The cyclohexene ring without substituents is C6H10.

Each substituent adds:

Formyl (CHO): 1 C, 1 O, and 0 H (since it replaces an H on the ring).

Vinyl (CH2=CH-): 2 C, 1 O? No, wait, vinyl is just CH2=CH-. So, 2 C, 3 H (since the substituent is CH2-CH2, but the exact H count would depend on substitution).

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula is:

C6 (ring) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) = 9 C.

The ring has 6 C, formyl adds 1, vinyl adds 2: total 9 C.

Hydrogen: the ring is C6H10. Each substituent:

Formyl: each substituent replaces a H on the ring. So, for the formyl group: the ring has 10 H, but substituents take away 2 (since two substituents are present? No, each substituent replaces one H). Wait, the molecule has two substituents (formyl and vinyl), so each replaces a H on the ring.

So original ring H: 10.

Minus 2 H (two substituents) → 8 H.

Now, substituents: formyl (CHO) has two H (the H from CHO is the aldehyde H, but the substituent is -CHO, which has no additional H besides the aldehyde. Wait, no: the substituent is -CHO, which is a carbonyl group. So each substituent adds Hs?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the molecular formula.

Each substituent:

Formyl (CHO): adds 1 C, 1 O, and 0 H (since it's -CHO, which has no H attached except the aldehyde H, which is part of the group but not adding H to the ring).

Vinyl (CH₂=CH-): adds 2 C, and the substituent has 3 H (CH₂-CH₂, but with a double bond, so maybe the substituent has 3 H: the CH₂ has 2 H, and the CH₂ attached to the ring has 1 H? Or perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the entire molecule.

The formula for 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid would be:

The cyclohexene ring is C6H8 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene, which is C6H10 minus two H, but I'm not sure). Wait, no, cyclohexene is C6H10. But with substituents, it would lose some H.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute:

Each double bond reduces the number of H by 2 per double bond.

The starting material has:

1. Cyclohexene: 1 double bond → 6 C, 10 H → but with substituents, it's C6H8 with substituents.

But maybe the overall formula is C9H8O2.

Wait, the cyclohexene ring is C6H8 (since it has one double bond). Then, the formyl adds a CHO group, which is C=O. The vinyl adds a CH2CH2 group but with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I should just calculate the molecular formula.

The parent is cyclohexene (C6H10).

Substituents:

At position 2: formyl (CHO) → adds 1 C, 1 O, and 0 H (since it's replacing a H on the ring). So the ring now has 6 C, 10 H - 1 H (from substituent) → 9 H.

At position 5: vinyl (CH₂=CH-) → adds 2 C, 3 H (since the substituent is -CH₂-CH₂, but with a double bond, so perhaps the substituent contributes 3 H. Wait, the substituent is CH₂=CH- attached to the ring, so the structure is:

Ring C5H9-CH₂-CH₂? No, the substituent is CH₂-CH₂ with a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is CH₂-CH₂, but with a double bond, so it's CH₂=CH- attached to the ring. So the substituent is -(CH₂)₂, but with a double bond between the two CH₂ groups.

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let's calculate the molecular formula:

Number of carbons: 6 (ring) + 1 (formyl) + 2 (vinyl) = 9 C.

Number of oxygens: 2 (from carboxylic acid (COOH) and formyl (CHO)).

Number of hydrogens: let's compute.

The cyclohexene ring without substituents has 10 H. Each substituent replaces one H.

So 10 H - 2 H (two substituents) = 8 H.

Now, substituents:

Formyl (CHO) has one H (the aldehyde H) → but that's part of the substituent.

Vinyl group (CH₂=CH-) has 3 H: each CH2 has two H, but the double bond doesn't have H. Wait, the substituent is CH₂-CH₂, but with a double bond. So the structure is CH₂=CH- attached to the ring.

So substituent's H: the first CH₂ (attached to ring) has 2 H, the second CH₂ (with double bond) has 1 H (since it's CH₂=CH- → the CH2 group has two H, but the CH is attached to the double bond, which has one H).

Wait, perhaps the substituent contributes a total of 3 H: 2 from the first CH2 and 1 from the CH2 in the vinyl group.

So the substituent adds 3 H. So total H in molecule:

8 (from ring) + 3 (from substituent) + 1 (from formyl's H) + 2 (from COOH group? Wait, the COOH group is -COOH, which has 2 O's and the formula is -COOH, so it has two O's. The COOH has two H's: the -OH and the H from the COOH.

Wait, I'm getting myself into a tangle. Let me think: the molecular formula of the starting material is C9H8O2.

Wait, because:

Cyclohexene: C6H10.

Each substituent:

Formyl: adds 1 C, 1 O, and 0 H (since it replaces a H on the ring). So, H count remains same minus 1: 10 -1=9.

Wait, but then the substituent brings in the formyl group, which has its own H. The formyl is CHO → so the substituent contributes 1 H (the aldehyde H). So H becomes 9 +1 =10.

Wait, but this seems complicated. Maybe I should compute it using the formula for the molecule.

The molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

Breaking it down:

- Cyclohexene: C6H10 (since it's a six-membered ring with one double bond).
- The carboxylic acid group is at position 3 (since it's cyclohex-3-ene carboxylic acid). Wait, no, the position is 3 for the cyclohexene, and the carboxylic acid is at position x.

Wait, maybe I should think of the substituents: formyl at 2, vinyl at 5, and the carboxylic acid group where?

Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the cyclohexene ring is numbered such that the double bond is between C3 and C4. The substituents are at C2 (formyl) and C5 (vinyl). The carboxylic acid group is at another position. Wait, wait, no: the ring is cyclohexene, and the suffix is -carboxylic acid, which means the carboxylic acid group is attached to the ring. So the ring has substituents at 2 (formyl), 3 (the double bond), and 5 (vinyl). Wait, that can't be; perhaps the carboxylic acid is at position 1, but the name is cyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, so the COOH is at position 1, and the double bond is between 3 and 4.

So the substituents are at positions 2 (CHO), 5 (CH2=CH-), and 1 (COOH). Hmm.

Now, the molecular formula:

Each substituent adds:

COOH: adds 2 O and 2 H (since it's -COOH: has two O's and the H from -OH and the H from the COOH group. Wait, not sure.

But perhaps the formula is C9H8O2.

Assuming the formula is C9H8O2, let's compute the degree of unsaturation.

DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2.

Here, C=9, H=8, X=0 (no halogens), N=0.

So DoU = (2*9 +2 -8 -0 +0)/2 = (20-8)/2= 12/2=6.

So the starting material has 6 degrees of unsaturation.

Wait, but that's not right. Because the starting material has a cyclohexene ring (1 DoU), a formyl group (1 DoU), and a vinyl group (1 DoU), plus the COOH group (which is a carbonyl, another DoU). Wait, wait:

COOH is a carbonyl (one DoU). The cyclohexene ring is a DoU (1). The formyl group (CHO) is another DoU (1). The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is another DoU (1). So that's four DoU.

Wait, but according to the formula, it's 6 DoU. So perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recount.

Wait, the formula is C9H8O2.

DoU = (2*9 +2 -8)/2 = (20 -8)/2=6.

So six DoU. Each DoU can be a ring or a double bond or a triple bond.

In the starting molecule:

1. Cyclohexene ring (1 DoU).
2. COOH group (1 DoU).
3. Formyl group (1 DoU).
4. Vinyl group (1 DoU).
5. The cyclohexene has a double bond (already counted as 1).
Wait, wait, no. Wait, the cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond, which is one DoU (a ring plus a double bond counts as two DoU? No, a ring is one, a double bond is another. So the cyclohexene ring has two DoU: one for the ring, one for the double bond. Wait no, wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The formula DoU counts each ring and each pi bond or triple bond as one DoU. So a cyclohexene (a six-membered ring with one double bond) would have two DoU? No, wait, no. Because a six-membered ring has one DoU (since it's a ring), and the double bond adds another. So that's two DoU.

So the starting material's DoU:

1. Cyclohexene: 2 DoU (ring + double bond).
2. COOH: 1 DoU (carbonyl).
3. Formyl: 1 DoU (carbonyl).
4. Vinyl group: 1 DoU.
Total: 2 +1 +1 +1 =5 DoU? But according to the formula, it's 6. So I'm missing one.

Wait, perhaps the COOH group is considered as two DoU? No, no. COOH is a carbonyl, so that's one DoU.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating the formula. Let me think again: the formula is C9H8O2.

DoU= (2*9 +2 -8)/2= (20-8)/2=6.

So, 6 DoU.

The molecule has:

- Cyclohexene ring: 2 DoU (ring and double bond).
- COOH: 1 DoU.
- Formyl: 1 DoU.
- Vinyl: 1 DoU.
Total: 2+1+1+1=5 DoU. Hmm, but the formula gives 6. So where's the sixth DoU?

Ah, wait, maybe the COOH group is a carbonyl (1 DoU), but perhaps the molecule has another double bond or ring. Or perhaps I'm counting wrong.

Wait, the starting molecule has a cyclohexene ring with substituents. So the ring contributes 2 DoU (one for the ring, one for the double bond), the COOH contributes 1, formyl contributes 1, and the vinyl contributes 1. That's 5 DoU. But the formula says 6. So perhaps I've missed another DoU. Maybe the carboxylic acid group is in a position that creates another ring or something else?

Alternatively, maybe the substituents cause another double bond. Or perhaps the ring is a bicyclic structure, but that's unlikely given the name.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me proceed under the assumption that the starting material's DoU is 6.

Now, the reaction is with red phosphorus and excess HI. I need to figure out what happens to each part.

Assuming that the reaction reduces the double bonds. Like, the cyclohexene's double bond is hydrogenated, the vinyl group's double bond is hydrogenated, and the formyl group is reduced.

So, the product would have:

- Cyclohexane (no double bond, one ring → 1 DoU).
- The formyl group (CHO) is reduced to CH2OH, which is a single bond, so that's 0 DoU (since it's a single bond, no ring, no double bond).
- The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is hydrogenated to CH2CH2, so single bond; 0 DoU.
- The COOH group: what happens to it? COOH could be reduced. For example, with H2 and a catalyst, COOH becomes CH2OH. But with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a different reaction. Maybe the COOH is decarboxylated.

Wait, another approach: if the reaction is a decarboxylation, the COOH group is converted into a CH2 group. So, the COOH (one DoU) becomes CH2 (single bond), so one less DoU.

So, the product would have:

- Cyclohexane: 1 DoU.
- Formyl group reduced to CH2OH: 0 DoU.
- Vinyl group reduced to CH2CH2: 0 DoU.
- COOH group converted to CH2: 0 DoU.

So total DoU in product: only the cyclohexane ring → 1 DoU.

Wait, but earlier I thought the starting material had 6 DoU, and if after reaction, the product has 1 DoU, that would make the answer 1, which is option A.

But wait, what else happens. Let me think:

If the reaction conditions reduce all the double bonds:

- Cyclohexene → cyclohexane (1 DoU from ring).
- Formyl group (CHO) → CH2OH (no DoU).
- Vinyl group (CH2=CH-) → CH2CH2 (no DoU).
- COOH group → perhaps it's decarboxylated to CH2.

So the product would have only the cyclohexane ring as the source of DoU, which is 1.

So the product's DoU is 1.

But wait, what about the COOH group? If it's decarboxylated, it becomes a CH2 group, which doesn't contribute to DoU. So the product is a cyclohexane ring with substituents at 2 (CH2OH), 5 (CH2CH2), and 1 (CH2).

But wait, the cyclohexane ring itself contributes 1 DoU (the ring, no double bonds).

So the product's DoU is 1, which is option A.


The question involves determining the index of hydrogen deficiency (degree of unsaturation, DoU) of the product formed when 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid is reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. 

### Key Analysis:

1. **Structure of the Starting Material**:  
   The molecule is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. It contains:
   - A cyclohexene ring (C6H10), which contributes 2 DoU (1 for the ring and 1 for the double bond).
   - A formyl group (CHO) at position 2, contributing 1 DoU (carbonyl group).
   - A vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at position 5, contributing 1 DoU (double bond).
   - A carboxylic acid group (COOH) at position 3, contributing 1 DoU (carbonyl group).  
   Total DoU of the starting material = 2 (cyclohexene) + 1 (formyl) + 1 (vinyl) + 1 (COOH) = **5 DoU**.

2. **Reaction Conditions**:  
   The reaction involves red phosphorus and excess HI. Red phosphorus is a reducing agent, and HI is a strong acid. These conditions typically reduce double bonds and functional groups:
   - The cyclohexene ring's double bond is reduced to a single bond, converting the ring into cyclohexane.
   - The formyl group (CHO) is reduced to CH2OH.
   - The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) is reduced to CH2CH2.
   - The carboxylic acid group (COOH) is reduced to CH2.

3. **Structure of the Product**:  
   After the reaction, the product is a cyclohexane ring with the following substituents:
   - A hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) at position 2.
   - An ethyl group (-CH2CH2-) at position 5.
   - A methyl group (-CH2-) at position 3.  
   The product contains only the cyclohexane ring, which contributes 1 DoU (from the ring).

4. **Degree of Unsaturation of the Product**:  
   The product has no double bonds or triple bonds, and the only source of unsaturation is the cyclohexane ring. Therefore, the product has **1 degree of unsaturation**.

### Conclusion:  
The index of hydrogen deficiency of the product is **1**.

**Answer: A**
