Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state.

Wait, the spin state is given as (3i, 4). Oh wait, I think that's a two-component vector, right? So the state is a column vector [3i; 4]. Or maybe it's written as (3i, 4), which would also make a two-component column vector when transposed. Either way, the components are 3i and 4.

The expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator matrix, then multiplied by the state vector again. Oh wait no, wait. The formula is <A> = ψ† A ψ, right? So for a spin-½ particle, the spin operator S_y is ħ/2 times the Pauli sigma_y matrix. Oh right, because S = (ħ/2) σ.

So first, let me write down the components. The state vector ψ is [3i; 4], right? So ψ = [3i, 4]^T. And the sigma_y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So σ_y is that 2x2 matrix.

Wait, the operator S_y would then be (ħ/2) multiplied by sigma_y. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

To find the expectation value <S_y>, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ. Let's break this down.

First, calculate ψ†. ψ is [3i, 4]^T, so ψ† is the row vector [3i*, 4*], right? Since the components are complex numbers, we take their complex conjugates. So 3i becomes -3i, and 4 is real, so stays 4. So ψ† = [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, let me compute ψ† multiplied by S_y. Wait no, the order is ψ† multiplied by S_y, then multiplied by ψ. Wait, S_y is a matrix, so the multiplication is ψ† * S_y * ψ.

Wait, but S_y is (ħ/2) times sigma_y. So it's easier to compute sigma_y first and then multiply by ħ/2 at the end.

So let me compute ψ† sigma_y ψ. Then multiply by ħ/2.

Let me compute sigma_y acting on ψ first. So sigma_y * ψ is:

sigma_y = [[0, -i],
           [i, 0]]

ψ = [3i, 4]^T.

So sigma_y * ψ = [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + (0)(4) ]^T.

Calculating each component:

First component: 0*3i is 0, (-i)*4 is -4i. So first component is 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) is 3i², which is 3*(-1) = -3. And 0*4 is 0. So second component is -3.

So sigma_y * ψ = [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. For the second component: sigma_y rows are [i, 0], so the second row is [i, 0]. So the second component is i*(3i) + 0*4. i*3i is 3i², which is -3. So yes, the second component is -3.

Now, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ], so multiply this by the result of sigma_y * ψ.

So ψ† sigma_y ψ = [ -3i, 4 ] * [ -4i; -3 ].

Wait, the vector after sigma_y is [ -4i, -3 ]^T? Wait, no. Wait, when you multiply sigma_y with ψ, which is a column vector, you get another column vector. So sigma_y * ψ is a column vector of [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

So now, when I multiply ψ† (which is a row vector) with that column vector, it's a dot product.

So [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ].

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i². i² is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

So sum is (-12) + (-12) = -24.

Wait, wait, but wait a second. Let me compute the terms again.

First term: (-3i) * (-4i) = (3i)(4i) (since negative times negative is positive). 3*4 is 12, i*i is i² which is -1. So 12*(-1) is -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) is -12.

So adding them: (-12) + (-12) = -24.

So ψ† sigma_y ψ is -24. Then, the expectation value <S_y> is (ħ/2) multiplied by this, right? Because S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ħ)/2 = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have -12 ħ. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) -12 ħbar/25

B) 12 ħbar/25

C) 25 ħbar/2

D) -25 ħbar/2

Hmm, none of these match -12 ħ. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me go through it again.

Wait, let's redo the calculation of sigma_y * ψ.

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

ψ is [3i, 4]^T.

So the first component of σ_y ψ is (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component is (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i² + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ = [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, ψ† is [3i, 4]†, which is [ -3i, 4 ].

So ψ† σ_y ψ is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Which is (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Let's compute each term again:

(-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

4*(-3) = -12.

So total is -12 -12 = -24.

So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24/2) ħ = -12 ħ.

But the options don't have -12 ħ. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the state vector.

Wait, the problem states the spin state is (3i, 4). I assumed it's a two-component state vector. But perhaps it's a four-component state? No, because spin-1/2 has two states. So it's a two-component vector.

Wait, maybe I got the order wrong. Let me double-check the multiplication.

Wait, another approach: the expectation value can be found as the sum over the components. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using the formula <S_y> = (ħ/2) (ψ† sigma_y ψ).

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value using the components.

Wait, another way to compute ψ† sigma_y ψ is: sum_{i,j} ψ_i^* (sigma_y)_ij ψ_j.

So sigma_y is:

[ [0, -i], 
  [i, 0] ]

So sigma_y elements are:

sigma_y[0][0] = 0,
sigma_y[0][1] = -i,
sigma_y[1][0] = i,
sigma_y[1][1] = 0.

So the product ψ† sigma_y ψ is:

sum_{i} sum_{j} (ψ_i^*) (sigma_y)_ij ψ_j.

Which is (ψ_0^* * sigma_y[0][0] * ψ_0) + (ψ_0^* sigma_y[0][1] ψ_1) + (psi_1^* sigma_y[1][0] psi_0) + (psi_1^* sigma_y[1][1] psi_1).

But sigma_y[0][0] and sigma_y[1][1] are zero, so those terms drop out.

So we have:

psi_0^* * (-i) * psi_1 + psi_1^* * (i) * psi_0.

So plugging in the values:

psi_0 is 3i, so psi_0^* is -3i.

psi_1 is 4, so psi_1^* is 4.

So the first term is (-3i) * (-i) * 4.

Wait, wait, let me compute:

First term: (psi_0^*) * (-i) * psi_1 = (-3i) * (-i) * 4.

Compute (-3i)*(-i) = 3 i² = 3*(-1) = -3.

Multiply by psi_1 (4): (-3)*4 = -12.

Second term: (psi_1^*) * (i) * psi_0 = 4 * i * (3i).

4 * i = 4i, multiplied by 3i is 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

So adding both terms: (-12) + (-12) = -24.

Same as before. So <S_y> is (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12 ħ.

But the options don't seem to match. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, wait, another possibility: maybe the state vector is normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized so that ψ† ψ = 1. Let me check if that's the case here.

Compute ψ† ψ: [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [3i; 4].

Which is (-3i)(3i) + 4*4.

First term: (-3i)(3i) = -9i² = -9*(-1) = 9.

Second term: 4*4=16.

Total: 9+16=25.

So the norm is 25. So the state is not normalized. So the expectation value would be [ (ψ† S_y ψ) ] divided by the norm, because the state is not normalized. Oh wait, right! Because the expectation value is the inner product of the state with the operator acting on the state, normalized by the state's norm squared.

Wait, no, wait. The expectation value is ⟨A⟩ = (⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩) only if the state is not normalized. Because the general formula is for when the state is not necessarily normalized.

Wait, no, wait no. The expectation value is ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩, but if |ψ⟩ is not normalized, then ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ isn't 1, so perhaps the formula is adjusted. Wait, no, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually assumed to be normalized, but when they're not, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩.

Wait, wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, if the state is given as |ψ⟩, it's assumed to be normalized, unless stated otherwise. But in this problem, the state is given as (3i,4), so perhaps it's not normalized.

So in our calculation, we found that ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

But wait, the state's norm squared is 25, as we saw earlier. So perhaps the expectation value is (-24) * (ħ/2) divided by 25? Because the state is not normalized, and the expectation value is ⟨A⟩ = (⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩).

So let me recalculate that.

So ψ† S_y ψ = -24 ħ/2? Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

Wait, actually, S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So the expectation value is (⟨ψ| sigma_y |ψ⟩) multiplied by (ħ/2).

But, since the state is not normalized, the expectation value would be [⟨ψ| sigma_y |ψ⟩] * (ħ/2) / [⟨ψ|ψ⟩].

So let's compute this.

We have ⟨ψ| sigma_y |ψ⟩ = -24.

⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 25.

So ⟨S_y⟩ = (-24) * (ħ/2) / 25.

So that's (-24* ħ)/(2 *25) = (-12 ħ) /25.

Ah, so that's -12 ħ /25, which matches option A.

So I think I made a mistake earlier by assuming the state was normalized, but in reality, it's not. So the correct expectation value is -12 ħ /25.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Operator Setup**: The spin operator along the y-direction is given by \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Expectation Value Formula**: The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi}.
   \]
   Here, \( \psi^\dagger \) is the conjugate transpose of \( \psi \), and \( \psi^\dagger \psi \) ensures normalization of the state.

3. **Compute \( \psi^\dagger \psi \)**: The norm of the state is:
   \[
   \psi^\dagger \psi = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]

4. **Compute \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi \)**: First, calculate \( \sigma_y \psi \):
   \[
   \sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) \\ (i)(3i) + (0)(4) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Now, compute \( \psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) \):
   \[
   \psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3).
   \]
   - First term: \( (-3i)(-4i) = 12i^2 = 12(-1) = -12 \).
   - Second term: \( (4)(-3) = -12 \).
   - Total: \( -12 + (-12) = -24 \).

5. **Expectation Value**: Substituting into the formula:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25} = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

6. **Final Answer**: The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12 \hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a specific spin state.

The expectation value of an operator is calculated as the conjugate transpose of the state vector multiplied by the operator matrix, then multiplied by the state vector again. Oh wait no, wait. The formula is <A> = ψ† A ψ, right? So for a spin-½ particle, the spin operator S_y is ħ/2 times the Pauli sigma_y matrix. Oh right, because S = (ħ/2) σ.

So first, let me write down the components. The state vector ψ is [3i; 4], right? So ψ = [3i, 4]^T. And the sigma_y matrix is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So σ_y is that 2x2 matrix.

Wait, the operator S_y would then be (ħ/2) multiplied by sigma_y. So S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. 

To find the expectation value <S_y>, I need to compute ψ† S_y ψ. Let's break this down.

First, calculate ψ†. ψ is [3i, 4]^T, so ψ† is the row vector [3i*, 4*], right? Since the components are complex numbers, we take their complex conjugates. So 3i becomes -3i, and 4 is real, so stays 4. So ψ† = [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, let me compute ψ† multiplied by S_y. Wait no, the order is ψ† multiplied by S_y, then multiplied by ψ. Wait, S_y is a matrix, so the multiplication is ψ† * S_y * ψ.

Wait, but S_y is (ħ/2) times sigma_y. So it's easier to compute sigma_y first and then multiply by ħ/2 at the end.

So let me compute ψ† sigma_y ψ. Then multiply by ħ/2.

Let me compute sigma_y acting on ψ first. So sigma_y * ψ is:

sigma_y = [[0, -i],
           [i, 0]]

ψ = [3i, 4]^T.

So sigma_y * ψ = [ (0)(3i) + (-i)(4), (i)(3i) + (0)(4) ]^T.

Calculating each component:

First component: 0*3i is 0, (-i)*4 is -4i. So first component is 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component: i*(3i) is 3i², which is 3*(-1) = -3. And 0*4 is 0. So second component is -3.

So sigma_y * ψ = [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. For the second component: sigma_y rows are [i, 0], so the second row is [i, 0]. So the second component is i*(3i) + 0*4. i*3i is 3i², which is -3. So yes, the second component is -3.

Now, ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ], so multiply this by the result of sigma_y * ψ.

So ψ† sigma_y ψ = [ -3i, 4 ] * [ -4i; -3 ].

Wait, the vector after sigma_y is [ -4i, -3 ]^T? Wait, no. Wait, when you multiply sigma_y with ψ, which is a column vector, you get another column vector. So sigma_y * ψ is a column vector of [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

So now, when I multiply ψ† (which is a row vector) with that column vector, it's a dot product.

So [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i; -3 ].

Let me compute each term:

First term: (-3i) * (-4i) = 12 i². i² is -1, so 12*(-1) = -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) = -12.

So sum is (-12) + (-12) = -24.

Wait, wait, but wait a second. Let me compute the terms again.

First term: (-3i) * (-4i) = (3i)(4i) (since negative times negative is positive). 3*4 is 12, i*i is i² which is -1. So 12*(-1) is -12.

Second term: 4 * (-3) is -12.

So adding them: (-12) + (-12) = -24.

So ψ† sigma_y ψ is -24. Then, the expectation value <S_y> is (ħ/2) multiplied by this, right? Because S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y.

So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24 ħ)/2 = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have -12 ħ. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) -12 ħbar/25

B) 12 ħbar/25

C) 25 ħbar/2

D) -25 ħbar/2

Hmm, none of these match -12 ħ. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait a minute, perhaps I messed up the calculation. Let me go through it again.

Wait, let's redo the calculation of sigma_y * ψ.

σ_y is [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

ψ is [3i, 4]^T.

So the first component of σ_y ψ is (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) = 0 + (-4i) = -4i.

Second component is (i)(3i) + (0)(4) = 3i² + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So σ_y ψ = [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Now, ψ† is [3i, 4]†, which is [ -3i, 4 ].

So ψ† σ_y ψ is [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [ -4i, -3 ]^T.

Which is (-3i)*(-4i) + 4*(-3).

Let's compute each term again:

(-3i)*(-4i) = 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

4*(-3) = -12.

So total is -12 -12 = -24.

So <S_y> = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24/2) ħ = -12 ħ.

But the options don't have -12 ħ. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the state vector.

Wait, the problem states the spin state is (3i, 4). I assumed it's a two-component state vector. But perhaps it's a four-component state? No, because spin-1/2 has two states. So it's a two-component vector.

Wait, maybe I got the order wrong. Let me double-check the multiplication.

Wait, another approach: the expectation value can be found as the sum over the components. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using the formula <S_y> = (ħ/2) (ψ† sigma_y ψ).

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expectation value using the components.

Wait, another way to compute ψ† sigma_y ψ is: sum_{i,j} ψ_i^* (sigma_y)_ij ψ_j.

So sigma_y is:

[ [0, -i], 
  [i, 0] ]

So sigma_y elements are:

sigma_y[0][0] = 0,
sigma_y[0][1] = -i,
sigma_y[1][0] = i,
sigma_y[1][1] = 0.

So the product ψ† sigma_y ψ is:

sum_{i} sum_{j} (ψ_i^*) (sigma_y)_ij ψ_j.

Which is (ψ_0^* * sigma_y[0][0] * ψ_0) + (ψ_0^* sigma_y[0][1] ψ_1) + (psi_1^* sigma_y[1][0] psi_0) + (psi_1^* sigma_y[1][1] psi_1).

But sigma_y[0][0] and sigma_y[1][1] are zero, so those terms drop out.

So we have:

psi_0^* * (-i) * psi_1 + psi_1^* * (i) * psi_0.

So plugging in the values:

psi_0 is 3i, so psi_0^* is -3i.

psi_1 is 4, so psi_1^* is 4.

So the first term is (-3i) * (-i) * 4.

Wait, wait, let me compute:

First term: (psi_0^*) * (-i) * psi_1 = (-3i) * (-i) * 4.

Compute (-3i)*(-i) = 3 i² = 3*(-1) = -3.

Multiply by psi_1 (4): (-3)*4 = -12.

Second term: (psi_1^*) * (i) * psi_0 = 4 * i * (3i).

4 * i = 4i, multiplied by 3i is 12 i² = 12*(-1) = -12.

So adding both terms: (-12) + (-12) = -24.

Same as before. So <S_y> is (ħ/2)*(-24) = -12 ħ.

But the options don't seem to match. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, wait, another possibility: maybe the state vector is normalized. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized so that ψ† ψ = 1. Let me check if that's the case here.

Compute ψ† ψ: [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by [3i; 4].

Which is (-3i)(3i) + 4*4.

First term: (-3i)(3i) = -9i² = -9*(-1) = 9.

Second term: 4*4=16.

Total: 9+16=25.

So the norm is 25. So the state is not normalized. So the expectation value would be [ (ψ† S_y ψ) ] divided by the norm, because the state is not normalized. Oh wait, right! Because the expectation value is the inner product of the state with the operator acting on the state, normalized by the state's norm squared.

Wait, no, wait. The expectation value is ⟨A⟩ = (⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩) only if the state is not normalized. Because the general formula is for when the state is not necessarily normalized.

Wait, no, wait no. The expectation value is ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩, but if |ψ⟩ is not normalized, then ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ isn't 1, so perhaps the formula is adjusted. Wait, no, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually assumed to be normalized, but when they're not, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩.

Wait, wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, if the state is given as |ψ⟩, it's assumed to be normalized, unless stated otherwise. But in this problem, the state is given as (3i,4), so perhaps it's not normalized.

So in our calculation, we found that ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24) = -12 ħ.

But wait, the state's norm squared is 25, as we saw earlier. So perhaps the expectation value is (-24) * (ħ/2) divided by 25? Because the state is not normalized, and the expectation value is ⟨A⟩ = (⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩).

So let me recalculate that.

So ψ† S_y ψ = -24 ħ/2? Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify.

Wait, actually, S_y is (ħ/2) sigma_y. So the expectation value is (⟨ψ| sigma_y |ψ⟩) multiplied by (ħ/2).

But, since the state is not normalized, the expectation value would be [⟨ψ| sigma_y |ψ⟩] * (ħ/2) / [⟨ψ|ψ⟩].

So let's compute this.

We have ⟨ψ| sigma_y |ψ⟩ = -24.

⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 25.

So ⟨S_y⟩ = (-24) * (ħ/2) / 25.

So that's (-24* ħ)/(2 *25) = (-12 ħ) /25.

Ah, so that's -12 ħ /25, which matches option A.

So I think I made a mistake earlier by assuming the state was normalized, but in reality, it's not. So the correct expectation value is -12 ħ /25.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \), we proceed as follows:

1. **Operator Setup**: The spin operator along the y-direction is given by \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]

2. **Expectation Value Formula**: The expectation value of \( S_y \) is:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi}.
   \]
   Here, \( \psi^\dagger \) is the conjugate transpose of \( \psi \), and \( \psi^\dagger \psi \) ensures normalization of the state.

3. **Compute \( \psi^\dagger \psi \)**: The norm of the state is:
   \[
   \psi^\dagger \psi = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = 9 + 16 = 25.
   \]

4. **Compute \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi \)**: First, calculate \( \sigma_y \psi \):
   \[
   \sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} (0)(3i) + (-i)(4) \\ (i)(3i) + (0)(4) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
   Now, compute \( \psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) \):
   \[
   \psi^\dagger (\sigma_y \psi) = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -4i \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = (-3i)(-4i) + (4)(-3).
   \]
   - First term: \( (-3i)(-4i) = 12i^2 = 12(-1) = -12 \).
   - Second term: \( (4)(-3) = -12 \).
   - Total: \( -12 + (-12) = -24 \).

5. **Expectation Value**: Substituting into the formula:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{-24}{25} = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
   \]

6. **Final Answer**: The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12 \hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
