Okay, so I've got this problem here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me try to break it down. So, the question is about an astronaut from an alien civilization traveling to Earth. The spacecraft is moving at a really high speed—0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super fast, almost light speed. 

Wait, the astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long their journey will take from their own perspective. Oh right, because when you travel at relativistic speeds, time dilation occurs. So, the time experienced by the astronaut (proper time) is less than the time measured by someone on Earth (coordinate time).

But wait, how do I calculate that? Oh, right, the time dilation formula from special relativity. The formula is the proper time (τ) equals the coordinate time (t) multiplied by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). Or wait, actually, it's τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). But wait, when you're moving at a high speed, the time experienced by the traveler is less than the time observed from Earth.

But wait, wait, the problem is asking for the time from the astronaut's point of view. So, I need to calculate the proper time for the astronaut. But to find that, I might need to know the distance and the speed, right? Because time is distance over speed.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Oh wait, but maybe they're implying that the distance is such that, from Earth's perspective, it's taking a certain amount of time. Or maybe that's not the case. Wait, no, the problem gives the spacecraft's speed as a fraction of c, so I can calculate the time from Earth's frame, but then I need to apply the time dilation effect to find out the astronaut's experienced time.

Wait, but without knowing the distance, how can I calculate the time? Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Wait, the options are given, but I think the problem is assuming the distance is such that the Earth's frame time is a certain value, but I don't think that's given. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Oh wait, wait a minute. The spacecraft is traveling at 0.99999987c. Let's compute the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Let me compute that. Let me calculate v²/c². v is 0.99999987c, so v² is approximately (0.99999987)^2 times c². Let me compute that.

Wait, 0.99999987 is very close to 1. Let's compute (1 - 0.00000013) because 0.99999987 = 1 - 0.00000013. So, (1 - 0.00000013)^2 is approximately 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2. The last term is negligible, so it's about 1 - 0.00000026, which is 0.99999974. So, 1 - v²/c² is approximately 0.00000026.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute (0.99999987)^2. Let me calculate 0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Well, 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 0.00000026 + 0.0000000000000169. So approximately 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - (0.99999987)^2 = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(0.00000026). Let's compute that.

Wait, sqrt(2.6e-7) is approximately 0.00051, because (0.00051)^2 is about 0.0000002601. So sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 0.00051. So gamma is 1 / 0.00051 ≈ 1960.78.

Hmm, so gamma is about 1960.78. So that means that from Earth's frame, the time taken is t = distance / v. But wait, distance isn't given. Oh wait, wait, maybe I'm missing something. Since the distance is to Earth, perhaps the distance is the same as the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud from Earth. Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away. So if the spaceship is traveling at 0.99999987c, the time taken from Earth's frame would be t = distance / speed.

So let's compute that. Distance is 160,000 light-years. Speed is 0.99999987c. So time t = 160,000 ly / 0.99999987c. Since ly is light-years, and speed is c, then the time in years is 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ approximately 160,000 / 1 = 160,000 years. Wait, but that can't be right because 0.99999987 is so close to 1. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 0.00000013, so 1/0.99999987 ≈ 1 + 0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2, but perhaps I should compute 160,000 / 0.99999987. Let's compute that.

160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1 + 0.00000013) ) ≈ 160,000 + 160,000 * 0.00000013. 160,000 * 0.00000013 is 0.0208. So about 160,002.08 years. But that's a really long time. So from Earth's perspective, the trip takes about 160,002 years.

But wait, the astronaut's lifetime is 150 years. So if the trip takes 160,002 years from Earth's frame, and the astronaut is 22, he would surely die before reaching Earth. But wait, that's not considering time dilation. Because from the astronaut's perspective, the trip is shorter.

Wait, the astronaut's proper time is t'= t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So t' is 160,002 years * sqrt(0.00000026). Which is 160,002 * 0.00051 ≈ 81.6 years. Oh, so the astronaut would experience about 81.6 years. So he's 22 now, so 81.6 years later he would be 103.6, which is less than his 150-year lifespan. That would mean he'd make it.

But wait, let me double-check the calculations. Because I might have messed up somewhere.

Wait, gamma is 1960.78. So the time experienced by the astronaut is t' = t / gamma. Because t' = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = t / gamma.

So t is about 160,000 years. So t' = 160,000 / 1960.78 ≈ 81.55 years. So about 81.5 years. Which is around 81 years, matching option C. So the astronaut would be about 22 +81=103, which is less than 150, so he would live to reach Earth.

Wait, but wait, let me check the distance. The Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away. So if the ship is moving at 0.99999987c, then from Earth's frame, the time is t = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ approximately 160,000 /1 = 160,000 years, which is t. But with time dilation, the astronaut's time is t / gamma, which is 160,000 / 1960.78 ≈ 81.5 years.

So the astronaut would be 22 +81.5 = 103.5 years old when he arrives, which is within his 150-year lifespan, so he'd live. So the time he experiences is about 81 years, so the correct option is C) 81 years.

Wait, but wait a second. When the astronaut is moving at such a high speed, perhaps the distance is contracted from his frame. So from his perspective, the distance is shorter. So the time experienced would be (distance in his frame) / speed. Because distance contraction is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), where L0 is the proper length (Earth frame). So L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c² ). So t' = L / v = (L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c² )) / v. But since L0 = distance to Earth as per Earth frame, which is 160,000 ly. So t'= (160,000 * sqrt(0.00000026) ) / 0.99999987c.

Wait, let me compute that. sqrt(0.00000026) is approx 0.00051. So 160,000 *0.00051 =81.6 ly. Then, 81.6 ly divided by 0.99999987c. Since 1 ly at speed v takes 1/v years, so 81.6 /0.99999987 ≈ 81.6 /1 ≈81.6 years. So same result. So the astronaut experiences about 81.6 years, which is about 81 years. So the answer is C) 81 years.

But wait, the question says "approximately how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth." So the time experienced by the astronaut is about 81 years, so he would reach Earth when he is 22+81=103 years old, which is within his 150-year lifespan. So the correct option is C) 81 years.

To determine how long the astronaut's journey will take from their perspective, we use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and length contraction. The spacecraft is traveling at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), which is extremely close to the speed of light. The distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 160,000 light-years.

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))
The Lorentz factor is given by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]
Substituting \( v = 0.99999987c \):
\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974
\]
\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 0.00000026
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 0.00051
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.00051} \approx 1960.78
\]

### Step 2: Time from Earth's perspective
From Earth's frame, the time taken for the journey is:
\[
t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{light-years}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 3: Time experienced by the astronaut (proper time)
The astronaut's proper time (\( \tau \)) is related to the Earth's time (\( t \)) by:
\[
\tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = t \cdot \frac{1}{\gamma}
\]
Substituting \( t \approx 160,000 \, \text{years} \) and \( \gamma \approx 1960.78 \):
\[
\tau = \frac{160,000}{1960.78} \approx 81.5 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 4: Verify using length contraction
From the astronaut's perspective, the distance to Earth is contracted:
\[
L = L_0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 160,000 \cdot 0.00051 \approx 81.6 \, \text{light-years}
\]
The time experienced by the astronaut is:
\[
\tau = \frac{L}{v} = \frac{81.6 \, \text{light-years}}{0.99999987c} \approx 81.6 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with astronaut's lifespan
The astronaut is 22 years old and has a lifespan of approximately 150 years. After traveling for 81 years, the astronaut would be \( 22 + 81 = 103 \) years old, which is within their expected lifespan. Therefore, the astronaut will reach Earth safely.

### Final Answer
The time experienced by the astronaut is approximately **81 years**.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute (0.99999987)^2. Let me calculate 0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Well, 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 0.00000026 + 0.0000000000000169. So approximately 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - (0.99999987)^2 = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026. So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(0.00000026). Let's compute that.

Wait, sqrt(2.6e-7) is approximately 0.00051, because (0.00051)^2 is about 0.0000002601. So sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 0.00051. So gamma is 1 / 0.00051 ≈ 1960.78.

So let's compute that. Distance is 160,000 light-years. Speed is 0.99999987c. So time t = 160,000 ly / 0.99999987c. Since ly is light-years, and speed is c, then the time in years is 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ approximately 160,000 / 1 = 160,000 years. Wait, but that can't be right because 0.99999987 is so close to 1. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 0.99999987 is 1 - 0.00000013, so 1/0.99999987 ≈ 1 + 0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2, but perhaps I should compute 160,000 / 0.99999987. Let's compute that.

160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 160,000 * (1 + 0.00000013) ) ≈ 160,000 + 160,000 * 0.00000013. 160,000 * 0.00000013 is 0.0208. So about 160,002.08 years. But that's a really long time. So from Earth's perspective, the trip takes about 160,002 years.

Wait, but wait, let me check the distance. The Large Magellanic Cloud is about 160,000 light-years away. So if the ship is moving at 0.99999987c, then from Earth's frame, the time is t = 160,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ approximately 160,000 /1 = 160,000 years, which is t. But with time dilation, the astronaut's time is t / gamma, which is 160,000 / 1960.78 ≈ 81.5 years.

So the astronaut would be 22 +81.5 = 103.5 years old when he arrives, which is within his 150-year lifespan, so he'd live. So the time he experiences is about 81 years, so the correct option is C) 81 years.

Wait, but wait a second. When the astronaut is moving at such a high speed, perhaps the distance is contracted from his frame. So from his perspective, the distance is shorter. So the time experienced would be (distance in his frame) / speed. Because distance contraction is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c² ), where L0 is the proper length (Earth frame). So L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c² ). So t' = L / v = (L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c² )) / v. But since L0 = distance to Earth as per Earth frame, which is 160,000 ly. So t'= (160,000 * sqrt(0.00000026) ) / 0.99999987c.

Wait, let me compute that. sqrt(0.00000026) is approx 0.00051. So 160,000 *0.00051 =81.6 ly. Then, 81.6 ly divided by 0.99999987c. Since 1 ly at speed v takes 1/v years, so 81.6 /0.99999987 ≈ 81.6 /1 ≈81.6 years. So same result. So the astronaut experiences about 81.6 years, which is about 81 years. So the answer is C) 81 years.

But wait, the question says "approximately how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut (from the point of view of the astronaut) to reach the Earth." So the time experienced by the astronaut is about 81 years, so he would reach Earth when he is 22+81=103 years old, which is within his 150-year lifespan. So the correct option is C) 81 years.


To determine how long the astronaut's journey will take from their perspective, we use the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and length contraction. The spacecraft is traveling at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), which is extremely close to the speed of light. The distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 160,000 light-years.

### Step 1: Calculate the Lorentz factor (\( \gamma \))
The Lorentz factor is given by:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]
Substituting \( v = 0.99999987c \):
\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = (0.99999987)^2 \approx 0.99999974
\]
\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \approx 0.00000026
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \approx \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 0.00051
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{0.00051} \approx 1960.78
\]

### Step 2: Time from Earth's perspective
From Earth's frame, the time taken for the journey is:
\[
t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{160,000 \, \text{light-years}}{0.99999987c} \approx 160,000 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 3: Time experienced by the astronaut (proper time)
The astronaut's proper time (\( \tau \)) is related to the Earth's time (\( t \)) by:
\[
\tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = t \cdot \frac{1}{\gamma}
\]
Substituting \( t \approx 160,000 \, \text{years} \) and \( \gamma \approx 1960.78 \):
\[
\tau = \frac{160,000}{1960.78} \approx 81.5 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 4: Verify using length contraction
From the astronaut's perspective, the distance to Earth is contracted:
\[
L = L_0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 160,000 \cdot 0.00051 \approx 81.6 \, \text{light-years}
\]
The time experienced by the astronaut is:
\[
\tau = \frac{L}{v} = \frac{81.6 \, \text{light-years}}{0.99999987c} \approx 81.6 \, \text{years}
\]

### Step 5: Compare with astronaut's lifespan
The astronaut is 22 years old and has a lifespan of approximately 150 years. After traveling for 81 years, the astronaut would be \( 22 + 81 = 103 \) years old, which is within their expected lifespan. Therefore, the astronaut will reach Earth safely.

### Final Answer
The time experienced by the astronaut is approximately **81 years**.

Answer: C
