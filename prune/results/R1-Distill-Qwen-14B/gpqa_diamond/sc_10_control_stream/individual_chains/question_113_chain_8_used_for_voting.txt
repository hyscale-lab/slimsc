Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 suggests the presence of O-H groups, probably from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but a broad peak that's strong—alcohol O-H is usually broad but maybe a carboxylic acid would have a really strong and broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH in a ketone? No, wait, ketones don't have O-H. So perhaps a hydroxyl group is present.

Then there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, or maybe an amine. Wait, but the 1650 is a bit lower than a typical carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugation. Oh wait, maybe that's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Because in conjugation, the carbonyl stretch can be lower. So maybe it's an ester or a ketone with a double bond nearby.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones in a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe conjugated with a carbonyl group, like in an ester or a ketone.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 could be a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, 45 could be CH3-O-CH2CH2... or wait, what's the molecular weight of some common groups. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of maybe a (CH3)2O (which is 45? Let me check: CH3 is 15, O is 16, so (CH3)2O would be (15*2) + 16 = 46. No, that's 46. Wait, what else? Oh, maybe a CH3(OH) group? Or perhaps a fragment like a CH2=CH-O-... No, wait, 45 is 45. Let's think: C3H7 has a molecular weight of 45? Wait, C is 12, H is 1. So C3H7 would be 3*12 +7=43, which isn't 45. Hmm. Alternatively, it's maybe a carbonyl group fragment. Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

The mass fragment at m/z 45. Let's see: 45 could be a (CH3)2CO+ (that's a ketone fragment?), but wait, (CH3)2CO is (45) — (because (CH3)2CO is 2*15 (for CH3) + 16 (C) + 16 (O) = wait, no, that's not right. Let me calculate better.

Wait, (CH3)2CO is acetone. The molecular formula is C3H6O. So molecular weight is 3*12 +6*1 +16 = 36 +6 +16=58. So that's too high. Hmm.

Wait, 45 could be a CH2CH2O group? Or perhaps a (CH2CH2O+) ion? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the loss of a fragment. Let me think about possible structures.

Also, looking back, the IR has a peak at 1700 and 1650. So perhaps the compound has two carbonyl groups. Like an ester and a ketone? Or maybe an ester with a conjugated double bond.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula. Let's consider the options.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structure: an ester, maybe with an unsaturated group. Because esters have the carbonyl group. And the unsaturation from a double bond would explain the vinyl protons in NMR.

Option B: C6H10O. This would have more unsaturation. Maybe a cyclic ether with some double bonds, but I'm not sure how that would fit with the IR and NMR data.

Option C: C6H10O2. So two oxygen atoms. Could be an ester or a ketone plus something else. Or a carboxylic acid and an ether, but that's less likely.

Option D: C6H12O. One oxygen. Hmm, maybe an alcohol with a double bond, but the IR has a strong peak at 1700, which suggests a carbonyl, so maybe a ketone. But if it's a ketone and an alcohol, that would be O in both, so O2, which would make it option C or A.

Wait, but the IR also has a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1. That suggests an -OH group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the IR would have a very strong, broad peak around 2500-3300. But in the question, the peak is at 3000, but it's a very broad peak. Hmm.

So putting this together: possible structures include an ester (which has a carbonyl) and an alcohol group, so that would be two oxygen atoms. Or a carboxylic acid, but that could complicate things.

Wait, let's think about the NMR. There are vinyl protons, which are probably in an alkene. So the molecule has a double bond. So maybe it's an ester with a double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. That structure would have the conjugated carbonyl, which could explain the 1650 peak.

If it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the structure would be something like CH2=CHCOO-R. So for example, something like methyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOCH3). But wait, the molecular formula in the options is C6H12O2. Let's see: methyl acrylate is C4H6O2. So for the given options, maybe it's a larger molecule, perhaps something with a ring?

Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester, but that's a lactone. But that's probably not, given the other data.

Wait, another thought: the mass spectrum has a peak at m/z 45. Let's see what the possible fragments are.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, molecular weight is (6*12) + (10*1) + (2*16) =72 +10 +32=114. So molecular weight is 114.

If the fragment is at 45, that's a significant loss. For example, if the molecule breaks off a fragment of 45, that would leave a larger piece. Or perhaps the fragment is a smaller part.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation for each.

Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X=0 and N=0.

Option A: C6H12O2. C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14 -12)/2 = 2/2=1.

So one degree of unsaturation. That could be one ring and/or one double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU = (2*6+2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2= 4/2=2. Two degrees: maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=(2*6+2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2. Two degrees, same as B.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU=(2*6+2 -12)/2=(14-12)/2=1.

So, back to the data: the NMR has vinyl protons (double bond), so that's one DoU. The IR shows a carbonyl (another DoU). So total DoU from these would be two. So the compound must have two degrees of unsaturation.

Looking at the options, the compounds that have DoU=2 are B, C, and A has DoU=1, D=1. So the correct option should be either B or C.

Wait, but wait: the IR has two carbonyl peaks, at 1700 and 1650. That suggests two carbonyl groups. Or perhaps one carbonyl and another functional group. Alternatively, one carbonyl and maybe a conjugated system.

Wait, if there are two carbonyl groups, that would account for two DoU (each carbonyl is a double bond). But we have a vinyl group (another DoU), so that would make three DoU. But looking at the options:

Option B: C6H10O. DoU=2. So possible with one carbonyl and a double bond.

Wait, but if there are two carbonyls, that would require DoU=2 from carbonyls plus one from the double bond, which is DoU=3. But none of the options have DoU=3. So perhaps the two IR peaks are not two carbonyl groups.

Alternative idea: the 1650 cm^-1 peak is not a carbonyl. Could it be an aromatic ring? For example, benzene rings have C=C stretching around 1450-1600. 1650 is a bit higher, which could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So maybe only one carbonyl group, but the 1650 is due to conjugation, not another carbonyl.

So the IR has a carbonyl at 1700. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring or a conjugated double bond.

If the molecule has an ester group (which has a carbonyl) and a double bond, that's two DoU. So the molecular formula should be DoU=2.

So options B (C6H10O) and C (C6H10O2) have DoU=2.

So which one is it?

Looking at the NMR: there are vinyl protons, so a double bond is present. The presence of O-H (from IR peak at 3000, broad) suggests an alcohol or carboxylic acid.

If it's an ester, which has O2, then the formula would be C6H10O2 (option C) or C6H12O2 (option A). But option A has DoU=1, so that can't be because we have two DoU (if the ester is one DoU and the double bond another).

Wait, wait. Let me re-express the DoU for each option.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2.

So for C6H10O2, two DoU can be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, etc.

So what functional groups are present? We have a carbonyl (ester), a double bond (vinyl protons), and an O-H group. Wait, that would require three DoU. Because each carbonyl, double bond, and ring contribute to DoU.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try again.

The IR has a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1, which is probably an -OH group, so the compound has an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But in the presence of a carbonyl (1700 cm^-1), maybe it's an ester and an alcohol? That would have two oxygen-containing groups.

Wait, but esters are usually O2, so if the compound is an ester with an alcohol, that would be O3, but the options don't have O3. Hmm, perhaps it's a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an alcohol group, but that would complicate things.

Wait, maybe the compound is an alkenol ester, like an ester with a double bond adjacent to the ester group. So for example, something like CH2=CHCOOR.

Let's think about the possible structure. Suppose it's an ester with a double bond. The IR at 1700 is the ester carbonyl. The 1650 could be the conjugated double bond (C=C) stretch, which is lower than a regular alkene because of conjugation with the carbonyl.

So the structure would have an ester group (O2) and a double bond (so two DoU). Let's check the molecular formula.

If the structure is CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is something. Let's say R is an ethyl group, making the formula CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. The formula would be C5H8O2. But our options are C6 so maybe a larger R group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an ester group attached. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is something with a benzene ring. Wait, but the options don't have benzene (since it's C6H...). Wait, benzene is C6H6. So for C6H10O2, the degrees of unsaturation are 2. So perhaps a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU) but that's not possible because the compound has only two DoU. So benzene is three DoU (three double bonds in the ring) and that's more than what we have.

So, probably not a benzene ring. So back to the original idea: an ester with a conjugated double bond.

So the molecular formula would be C6H10O2 (option C) or C6H12O2 (option A).

Wait, but let's check the molecular weights again. Option A is C6H12O2, which is (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116. So molecular weight is 116.

Option C is C6H10O2: (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114.

In the mass spectrum, the fragment is at m/z=45. Let's consider which molecular formulas would produce a fragment at 45.

For option C (C6H10O2), possible fragments could be (CH2)2CO+ (which is 45? Let's calculate: CH2CO is (CH2)2CO? Wait, no. Let me think: (CH3)2CO is acetone, which is 58. Alternatively, if a fragment is (CH2CH2O), but that's not correct. Wait, 45 could be CH3CH2O+ (45? CH3CH2O is (15 + 15 +16) = 46? Wait, no, because CH3CH2O has a methyl group (15) plus ethylene group (24? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is CH2=CH-O- something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula C6H10O2. Let's think about possible structures. Maybe it's an ester with a double bond.

Let's take an example: methyl vinyl carbonate? No, that's O3.

Wait, perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For instance, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Let's see what the formula would be: CH2=CHCOO is C3H3O2, and CH2CH2CH3 is C3H7, so overall C6H10O2. Oh, that fits option C.

So the structure would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. But wait, that would be C6H10O2.

Wait, the molecular formula would be (3 carbons from CH2=CHCOO) + 3 from the ester's R group (like CH2CH2CH3?), but I'm a bit confused. Let me count: CH2=CHCOO is 3 carbons, and if the R is CH2CH2CH3, that's 3 carbons as well, making 6 in total. So yes, that would be C6H10O2.

In that structure, the NMR would show vinyl protons (from the CH2=CHCOO group), and the IR would show the ester carbonyl (1700) and the conjugated double bond (1650). The O-H from where? Wait, wait, in this structure, do we have an O-H group? Because the IR has a broad peak at 3000, suggesting O-H.

Oh wait, maybe I was wrong about that. If the structure is an ester, where is the O-H coming from? Ester groups don't have O-H. Unless the compound is a carboxylic acid, but then why would there be an ester? Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the O-H isn't part of the main structure but is from another group. Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else. Or maybe I made a mistake earlier about the O-H.

Wait, if the compound is a diol ester or something with both an ester and an -OH group. But that would require more oxygen. For example, a molecule with both an ester group and an alcohol group would have O3, but none of the options have O3.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from an acidic proton elsewhere. Wait, maybe it's a cyclic ester with an adjacent O-H, but that seems unlikely.

Hmm, maybe I need to re-evaluate the O-H peak. Broad peak at 3000 cm^-1. Could that be an N-H stretch instead? But the question states it's FTIR, which usually can distinguish between O-H and N-H stretches, but the question says it's O-H. Alternatively, perhaps it's an -OH in a phenol group. But if there's a benzene ring, the DoU would be higher. So perhaps it's an alcohol.

Wait, but if the compound is an ester and an alcohol, that's two O-containing groups, which would require O2, but the molecular formula would have O3 (since ester is two O, alcohol is O). But our options don't have O3. So perhaps the O-H is from somewhere else. Maybe it's a hemiacetal? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me go back to the mass spectrum. The fragment peak at m/z 45. Let me think about what could fragment to give 45.

45 is a molecular ion for C3H7O? Wait, molecular weight of C3H8O is 56 (3*12 +8 +16=36+8+16=60). No, wrong.

Wait, 45 is 45. Let me think about possible ions. Maybe it's the propyl group or something else.

Wait, the molecular formula C6H10O2 has a molecular weight of 114. If the fragment is 45, that leaves a remaining fragment of 114-45=69. Hmm, what's 69? 69 could be C4H9O? Let's see: C4H9O would be 4*12 +9*1 +16=48+9+16=73. No, that's not 69.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH3)2CO, which is 58. No, that's too high.

Wait, perhaps the 45 is a (CH2CH2O) group. Wait, CH2CH2O would be C2H4O, which has molecular weight 2*12 +4 +16=24+4+16=44. Close to 45, but not quite.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH3-O-CH2CH2. Wait, that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is CH2=CH-O- something.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 is a CH2CH2O+ group, which is 44. So not matching. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula C6H10O2. If the structure is an ester, which would have the formula R-O-CO-R', then:

R and R' are alkyl groups. So for example, if R is CH2CH2CH3 and R' is CH2=CHCOO-, wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, but that would have O2 and a ring, which would account for one DoU. Then, the double bond would be another, making DoU=2.

Wait, if the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond, that would have two DoU. So for example, a five-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester, but that would require more oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is not part of the main structure but is from a different group. Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from an acidic proton, like in an enol form, but that's getting into more complex structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from an alcohol group and the compound also has an ester. But that would require O3, which isn't an option.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

Option C is C6H10O2. That would be:

Possible structure: an ester with a double bond, and no O-H group. But then why the O-H peak in IR?

Wait, perhaps the O-H is from a different group. Maybe it's an ester and an ether. But then again, why would there be a broad O-H peak. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone and an ester, but that would require more oxygen.

Wait, maybe the O-H is from a carboxylic acid, but that would have two O's (COOH has two O's). So in that case, the formula would be C6H10O2 (option C), as COOH contributes two O's.

So if the structure is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, then the IR would have a broad O-H peak (carboxylic acid), a carbonyl peak around 1700 (carboxylic acid), and the 1650 could be from a conjugated double bond.

But wait, a carboxylic acid's carbonyl peak is usually around 1700, and the O-H is very broad. Additionally, in such a case, the NMR would show a broad peak for the O-H proton, but the question doesn't mention that. However, the question says "several peaks including vinyl hydrogens," so maybe the O-H is exchange broadened and not clearly seen, or perhaps it's a broad peak elsewhere.

But then, if it's a carboxylic acid, the molecular formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C. Also, the presence of a vinyl group (double bond) would explain the NMR and the IR at 1650.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to match each option with the given data.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation = 1. So either a ring or a double bond. But our data suggests two DoU (from the carbonyl and the double bond), so this option may not fit.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU=2. So maybe a ring and a double bond. But where would the IR peaks come in? The 1700 cm^-1 would be a carbonyl, but with only O=1, perhaps a ketone. But then the O-H from where? Since it's C6H10O, and the O is one, perhaps it's a ketone and an alcohol. That would require O=2, but this option has O=1. So that doesn't fit.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So a carbonyl (ester or ketone or acid) and a double bond. Also, O=2. So perhaps an ester with a double bond. Then, the O-H could be from an alcohol group. But that would require O=3. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is part of the ester group, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's not an O-H but an N-H, but the question says the IR peak is at 3000, which is more O-H than N-H.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a different functional group, like a phenol. But that would require a benzene ring, which would take up DoU. So, if the structure is a phenol with a double bond, that would be DoU=3 (ring and two double bonds?), but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is from a hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU=1. So either a ring or a double bond. But the data suggests two DoU.

So the only option that fits with two DoU is C (DoU=2) and B (DoU=2). Let's think about O.

Option C has O2. So if the compound is an ester (O2), with a double bond, then the IR would show the ester carbonyl (1700) and the conjugated double bond (1650). But then where is the O-H from the IR? Because the O-H suggests another O-containing group.

Hmm, perhaps the O-H is not part of the main structure but is a solvent or something else. But that's unlikely.

Wait, unless the O-H is from an aliphatic alcohol. So the compound is an ester (O2) and an alcohol (O1), making O3. But none of the options have O3.

Wait, but the options don't have O3. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial IR analysis. Maybe the peak at 3000 cm^-1 isn't an O-H but something else.

Wait, another possibility: the broad peak at 3000 could be an N-H stretch. But the question says FTIR, which can sometimes pick up N-H as well. However, the question doesn't mention any other peaks that suggest N-containing groups.

Alternatively, maybe it's a C-H stretch, like from sp3 C-H or sp2 C-H. But that's usually around 2800-3000, but a broad peak suggests it's O-H or N-H.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a secondary or tertiary alcohol. The O-H stretch in secondary alcohols is usually less broad than primary alcohols, but it's still a broad peak.

So, if it's a secondary alcohol, the structure would have O-H, a carbonyl group (like an ester), and a double bond. But that would require O3, which isn't an option. So perhaps the O-H is not present.

Wait, but the IR shows a strong peak at 3000, so O-H must be present.

Wait, unless the O-H is part of a carbonyl group, which doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a ketone? No, that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the O-H is from a carboxylic acid. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, the IR would have a very strong O-H peak (broad) around 2500-3300, which the question says it's at 3000. The carbonyl would be around 1700. The 1650 could be a conjugated double bond. Then the NMR would have vinyl protons.

So the molecular formula would be C6H10O2 (because a carboxylic acid has two O's). So option C.

But then, the mass fragment at 45. Let's think: the molecular formula is C6H10O2, molecular weight 114. The fragment at 45 would be 45/114 = about 39% of the molecular ion. So what could be a fragment with 45?

Perhaps the -COOH group loses something. Wait, COOH is 44 (12+16*2 +1?), no: COOH is (12 + 16*2 + 1) = 44? Wait, molecular weight of COOH group: 12 (C) + 16 (O) +16 (O) +1 (H) = 45. So the COOH group itself is 45. So if the molecule breaks off the COOH group, the fragment would be at m/z=45. But wait, COOH is 45. So that makes sense. So if the molecule is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, then the loss of COOH would give a fragment at 45.

Wait, but wait. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, the molecular formula would be C6H10O2. So the structure could be something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH.

Wait, that would have a double bond (CH2=CH...) and a carboxylic acid group (COOH). The IR would show a broad O-H (carboxylic acid) at 3000, the strong carbonyl at 1700, and the conjugated double bond at 1650. The NMR would show vinyl protons (the CH2=CH group) and the COOH proton, which would be exchange broadened and perhaps not seen as a sharp peak. So that fits.

But wait, the molecular formula for that structure (CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH) would be C7H10O2. But the options are up to C6. So perhaps it's a shorter chain.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic structure. For example, a cyclohexene ring with a carboxylic acid group attached.

Wait, cyclohexene is C6H10. Adding a COOH group would make it C7H10O2, which again is beyond the options.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. Structure like CH2=CHCOOH. That would be C3H4O2. But the options are C6, so perhaps it's a longer chain.

Wait, another approach: if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, and it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, perhaps it's something like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. But that's C6H10O2. Wait, let me count:

CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH: that's 2 (from CH2=CH) + 2 (CH2CH2) + 2 (COOH) = 6 carbons. Correct. The formula is C6H10O2. So the molecular weight is (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114.

In the mass spectrum, when the molecule breaks, the COOH group (45) could come off, leaving a fragment of 114-45=69. So the fragment at m/z=45 would correspond to the COOH group.

So putting it all together, the data fits option C: C6H10O2.

Wait, but the initial IR analysis said a broad peak at 3000, which could be the carboxylic acid O-H. The 1700 is the COOH carbonyl, and the 1650 is the conjugated double bond. The NMR shows vinyl protons. The mass spectrum shows a fragment at 45, which matches the COOH group.

So the correct answer should be option C: C6H10O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The unknown compound is analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or alcohol. Two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated system, such as an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. The ¹H NMR spectrum includes peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, indicating the presence of a double bond. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, which is consistent with the loss of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH, molecular weight = 45).

The molecular formula options are evaluated based on the degree of unsaturation (DoU) and functional groups:

1. **Option A: C₆H₁₂O₂**  
   DoU = 1. This suggests either a ring or a double bond. However, the data indicates two degrees of unsaturation (from the carbonyl and the double bond), so this option is inconsistent.

2. **Option B: C₆H₁₀O**  
   DoU = 2. This could correspond to a double bond and a ring. However, the IR peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl group, which requires oxygen, but this option only has one oxygen atom, making it inconsistent.

3. **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**  
   DoU = 2. This matches the two degrees of unsaturation (one from the carbonyl and one from the double bond). The IR peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ can be explained by a carboxylic acid carbonyl and a conjugated double bond. The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid. The mass spectrum fragment at m/z = 45 is consistent with the loss of the -COOH group. This option fits all the data.

4. **Option D: C₆H₁₂O**  
   DoU = 1. This suggests either a ring or a double bond, but the data indicates two degrees of unsaturation, making this option inconsistent.

The most consistent explanation is that the compound is a carboxylic acid with a conjugated double bond, fitting the molecular formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopic techniques. Let me think through this step by step.

First, let's look at the FTIR data. The broad peak around 3000 cm^-1 suggests the presence of O-H groups, probably from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. Wait, but a broad peak that's strong—alcohol O-H is usually broad but maybe a carboxylic acid would have a really strong and broad peak. Alternatively, maybe it's an -OH in a ketone? No, wait, ketones don't have O-H. So perhaps a hydroxyl group is present.

Then there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm^-1. The 1700 is a strong peak, which often indicates a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. The 1650 might be another carbonyl or an aromatic ring with conjugated double bonds, or maybe an amine. Wait, but the 1650 is a bit lower than a typical carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an aromatic ring with conjugation. Oh wait, maybe that's an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. Because in conjugation, the carbonyl stretch can be lower. So maybe it's an ester or a ketone with a double bond nearby.

Next, the 1H NMR shows peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl hydrogens are the ones in a double bond, like in an alkene. So the compound probably has a double bond, maybe conjugated with a carbonyl group, like in an ester or a ketone.

Looking at the mass spectrum, there's a fragment peak at m/z 45. Hmm, 45 is a common fragment. Let me think about possible fragments. 45 could be a methyl group attached to something else. Wait, 45 could be CH3-O-CH2CH2... or wait, what's the molecular weight of some common groups. Wait, 45 is the molecular weight of maybe a (CH3)2O (which is 45? Let me check: CH3 is 15, O is 16, so (CH3)2O would be (15*2) + 16 = 46. No, that's 46. Wait, what else? Oh, maybe a CH3(OH) group? Or perhaps a fragment like a CH2=CH-O-... No, wait, 45 is 45. Let's think: C3H7 has a molecular weight of 45? Wait, C is 12, H is 1. So C3H7 would be 3*12 +7=43, which isn't 45. Hmm. Alternatively, it's maybe a carbonyl group fragment. Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options are C6H12O2, C6H10O, C6H10O2, C6H12O.

The mass fragment at m/z 45. Let's see: 45 could be a (CH3)2CO+ (that's a ketone fragment?), but wait, (CH3)2CO is (45) — (because (CH3)2CO is 2*15 (for CH3) + 16 (C) + 16 (O) = wait, no, that's not right. Let me calculate better.

Wait, (CH3)2CO is acetone. The molecular formula is C3H6O. So molecular weight is 3*12 +6*1 +16 = 36 +6 +16=58. So that's too high. Hmm.

Wait, 45 could be a CH2CH2O group? Or perhaps a (CH2CH2O+) ion? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the loss of a fragment. Let me think about possible structures.

Also, looking back, the IR has a peak at 1700 and 1650. So perhaps the compound has two carbonyl groups. Like an ester and a ketone? Or maybe an ester with a conjugated double bond.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula. Let's consider the options.

Option A: C6H12O2. Possible structure: an ester, maybe with an unsaturated group. Because esters have the carbonyl group. And the unsaturation from a double bond would explain the vinyl protons in NMR.

Option B: C6H10O. This would have more unsaturation. Maybe a cyclic ether with some double bonds, but I'm not sure how that would fit with the IR and NMR data.

Option C: C6H10O2. So two oxygen atoms. Could be an ester or a ketone plus something else. Or a carboxylic acid and an ether, but that's less likely.

Option D: C6H12O. One oxygen. Hmm, maybe an alcohol with a double bond, but the IR has a strong peak at 1700, which suggests a carbonyl, so maybe a ketone. But if it's a ketone and an alcohol, that would be O in both, so O2, which would make it option C or A.

Wait, but the IR also has a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1. That suggests an -OH group, like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the IR would have a very strong, broad peak around 2500-3300. But in the question, the peak is at 3000, but it's a very broad peak. Hmm.

So putting this together: possible structures include an ester (which has a carbonyl) and an alcohol group, so that would be two oxygen atoms. Or a carboxylic acid, but that could complicate things.

Wait, let's think about the NMR. There are vinyl protons, which are probably in an alkene. So the molecule has a double bond. So maybe it's an ester with a double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. That structure would have the conjugated carbonyl, which could explain the 1650 peak.

If it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, the structure would be something like CH2=CHCOO-R. So for example, something like methyl acrylate (CH2=CHCOOCH3). But wait, the molecular formula in the options is C6H12O2. Let's see: methyl acrylate is C4H6O2. So for the given options, maybe it's a larger molecule, perhaps something with a ring?

Alternatively, maybe a cyclic ester, but that's a lactone. But that's probably not, given the other data.

Wait, another thought: the mass spectrum has a peak at m/z 45. Let's see what the possible fragments are.

If the molecular formula is C6H10O2, molecular weight is (6*12) + (10*1) + (2*16) =72 +10 +32=114. So molecular weight is 114.

If the fragment is at 45, that's a significant loss. For example, if the molecule breaks off a fragment of 45, that would leave a larger piece. Or perhaps the fragment is a smaller part.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula options. Let's calculate the degree of unsaturation for each.

Degree of unsaturation (DoU) is calculated as DoU = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming X=0 and N=0.

Option A: C6H12O2. C=6, H=12, O=2.

DoU = (2*6 +2 -12 -0 +0)/2 = (14 -12)/2 = 2/2=1.

So one degree of unsaturation. That could be one ring and/or one double bond.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU = (2*6+2 -10)/2 = (14-10)/2= 4/2=2. Two degrees: maybe a ring and a double bond, or two double bonds.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=(2*6+2 -10)/2=(14-10)/2=2. Two degrees, same as B.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU=(2*6+2 -12)/2=(14-12)/2=1.

So, back to the data: the NMR has vinyl protons (double bond), so that's one DoU. The IR shows a carbonyl (another DoU). So total DoU from these would be two. So the compound must have two degrees of unsaturation.

Looking at the options, the compounds that have DoU=2 are B, C, and A has DoU=1, D=1. So the correct option should be either B or C.

Wait, but wait: the IR has two carbonyl peaks, at 1700 and 1650. That suggests two carbonyl groups. Or perhaps one carbonyl and another functional group. Alternatively, one carbonyl and maybe a conjugated system.

Wait, if there are two carbonyl groups, that would account for two DoU (each carbonyl is a double bond). But we have a vinyl group (another DoU), so that would make three DoU. But looking at the options:

Option B: C6H10O. DoU=2. So possible with one carbonyl and a double bond.

Wait, but if there are two carbonyls, that would require DoU=2 from carbonyls plus one from the double bond, which is DoU=3. But none of the options have DoU=3. So perhaps the two IR peaks are not two carbonyl groups.

Alternative idea: the 1650 cm^-1 peak is not a carbonyl. Could it be an aromatic ring? For example, benzene rings have C=C stretching around 1450-1600. 1650 is a bit higher, which could be a conjugated carbonyl, like in an alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl. So maybe only one carbonyl group, but the 1650 is due to conjugation, not another carbonyl.

So the IR has a carbonyl at 1700. The 1650 could be an aromatic ring or a conjugated double bond.

If the molecule has an ester group (which has a carbonyl) and a double bond, that's two DoU. So the molecular formula should be DoU=2.

So options B (C6H10O) and C (C6H10O2) have DoU=2.

So which one is it?

Looking at the NMR: there are vinyl protons, so a double bond is present. The presence of O-H (from IR peak at 3000, broad) suggests an alcohol or carboxylic acid.

If it's an ester, which has O2, then the formula would be C6H10O2 (option C) or C6H12O2 (option A). But option A has DoU=1, so that can't be because we have two DoU (if the ester is one DoU and the double bond another).

Wait, wait. Let me re-express the DoU for each option.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2.

So for C6H10O2, two DoU can be a double bond and a ring, or two double bonds, etc.

So what functional groups are present? We have a carbonyl (ester), a double bond (vinyl protons), and an O-H group. Wait, that would require three DoU. Because each carbonyl, double bond, and ring contribute to DoU.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me try again.

The IR has a broad peak at 3000 cm^-1, which is probably an -OH group, so the compound has an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But in the presence of a carbonyl (1700 cm^-1), maybe it's an ester and an alcohol? That would have two oxygen-containing groups.

Wait, but esters are usually O2, so if the compound is an ester with an alcohol, that would be O3, but the options don't have O3. Hmm, perhaps it's a different structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a cyclic ester (lactone) with an alcohol group, but that would complicate things.

Wait, maybe the compound is an alkenol ester, like an ester with a double bond adjacent to the ester group. So for example, something like CH2=CHCOOR.

Let's think about the possible structure. Suppose it's an ester with a double bond. The IR at 1700 is the ester carbonyl. The 1650 could be the conjugated double bond (C=C) stretch, which is lower than a regular alkene because of conjugation with the carbonyl.

So the structure would have an ester group (O2) and a double bond (so two DoU). Let's check the molecular formula.

If the structure is CH2=CHCOO-R, where R is something. Let's say R is an ethyl group, making the formula CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. The formula would be C5H8O2. But our options are C6 so maybe a larger R group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclohexene ring with an ester group attached. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is something with a benzene ring. Wait, but the options don't have benzene (since it's C6H...). Wait, benzene is C6H6. So for C6H10O2, the degrees of unsaturation are 2. So perhaps a benzene ring (which is 3 DoU) but that's not possible because the compound has only two DoU. So benzene is three DoU (three double bonds in the ring) and that's more than what we have.

So, probably not a benzene ring. So back to the original idea: an ester with a conjugated double bond.

So the molecular formula would be C6H10O2 (option C) or C6H12O2 (option A).

Wait, but let's check the molecular weights again. Option A is C6H12O2, which is (6*12)+(12*1)+(2*16)=72+12+32=116. So molecular weight is 116.

Option C is C6H10O2: (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114.

In the mass spectrum, the fragment is at m/z=45. Let's consider which molecular formulas would produce a fragment at 45.

For option C (C6H10O2), possible fragments could be (CH2)2CO+ (which is 45? Let's calculate: CH2CO is (CH2)2CO? Wait, no. Let me think: (CH3)2CO is acetone, which is 58. Alternatively, if a fragment is (CH2CH2O), but that's not correct. Wait, 45 could be CH3CH2O+ (45? CH3CH2O is (15 + 15 +16) = 46? Wait, no, because CH3CH2O has a methyl group (15) plus ethylene group (24? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is CH2=CH-O- something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula C6H10O2. Let's think about possible structures. Maybe it's an ester with a double bond.

Let's take an example: methyl vinyl carbonate? No, that's O3.

Wait, perhaps it's an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For instance, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Let's see what the formula would be: CH2=CHCOO is C3H3O2, and CH2CH2CH3 is C3H7, so overall C6H10O2. Oh, that fits option C.

So the structure would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. But wait, that would be C6H10O2.

Wait, the molecular formula would be (3 carbons from CH2=CHCOO) + 3 from the ester's R group (like CH2CH2CH3?), but I'm a bit confused. Let me count: CH2=CHCOO is 3 carbons, and if the R is CH2CH2CH3, that's 3 carbons as well, making 6 in total. So yes, that would be C6H10O2.

In that structure, the NMR would show vinyl protons (from the CH2=CHCOO group), and the IR would show the ester carbonyl (1700) and the conjugated double bond (1650). The O-H from where? Wait, wait, in this structure, do we have an O-H group? Because the IR has a broad peak at 3000, suggesting O-H.

Oh wait, maybe I was wrong about that. If the structure is an ester, where is the O-H coming from? Ester groups don't have O-H. Unless the compound is a carboxylic acid, but then why would there be an ester? Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the O-H isn't part of the main structure but is from another group. Alternatively, maybe it's a hemiacetal or something else. Or maybe I made a mistake earlier about the O-H.

Wait, if the compound is a diol ester or something with both an ester and an -OH group. But that would require more oxygen. For example, a molecule with both an ester group and an alcohol group would have O3, but none of the options have O3.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from an acidic proton elsewhere. Wait, maybe it's a cyclic ester with an adjacent O-H, but that seems unlikely.

Hmm, maybe I need to re-evaluate the O-H peak. Broad peak at 3000 cm^-1. Could that be an N-H stretch instead? But the question states it's FTIR, which usually can distinguish between O-H and N-H stretches, but the question says it's O-H. Alternatively, perhaps it's an -OH in a phenol group. But if there's a benzene ring, the DoU would be higher. So perhaps it's an alcohol.

Wait, but if the compound is an ester and an alcohol, that's two O-containing groups, which would require O2, but the molecular formula would have O3 (since ester is two O, alcohol is O). But our options don't have O3. So perhaps the O-H is from somewhere else. Maybe it's a hemiacetal? Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me go back to the mass spectrum. The fragment peak at m/z 45. Let me think about what could fragment to give 45.

45 is a molecular ion for C3H7O? Wait, molecular weight of C3H8O is 56 (3*12 +8 +16=36+8+16=60). No, wrong.

Wait, 45 is 45. Let me think about possible ions. Maybe it's the propyl group or something else.

Wait, the molecular formula C6H10O2 has a molecular weight of 114. If the fragment is 45, that leaves a remaining fragment of 114-45=69. Hmm, what's 69? 69 could be C4H9O? Let's see: C4H9O would be 4*12 +9*1 +16=48+9+16=73. No, that's not 69.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is (CH3)2CO, which is 58. No, that's too high.

Wait, perhaps the 45 is a (CH2CH2O) group. Wait, CH2CH2O would be C2H4O, which has molecular weight 2*12 +4 +16=24+4+16=44. Close to 45, but not quite.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is CH3-O-CH2CH2. Wait, that's a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is CH2=CH-O- something.

Alternatively, perhaps the 45 is a CH2CH2O+ group, which is 44. So not matching. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula C6H10O2. If the structure is an ester, which would have the formula R-O-CO-R', then:

R and R' are alkyl groups. So for example, if R is CH2CH2CH3 and R' is CH2=CHCOO-, wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a cyclic ester, but that would have O2 and a ring, which would account for one DoU. Then, the double bond would be another, making DoU=2.

Wait, if the structure is a cyclic ester with a double bond, that would have two DoU. So for example, a five-membered ring with an ester group and a double bond.

But I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diester, but that would require more oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is not part of the main structure but is from a different group. Alternatively, maybe the O-H is from an acidic proton, like in an enol form, but that's getting into more complex structures.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from an alcohol group and the compound also has an ester. But that would require O3, which isn't an option.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

Option C is C6H10O2. That would be:

Possible structure: an ester with a double bond, and no O-H group. But then why the O-H peak in IR?

Wait, perhaps the O-H is from a different group. Maybe it's an ester and an ether. But then again, why would there be a broad O-H peak. Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone and an ester, but that would require more oxygen.

Wait, maybe the O-H is from a carboxylic acid, but that would have two O's (COOH has two O's). So in that case, the formula would be C6H10O2 (option C), as COOH contributes two O's.

So if the structure is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, then the IR would have a broad O-H peak (carboxylic acid), a carbonyl peak around 1700 (carboxylic acid), and the 1650 could be from a conjugated double bond.

But wait, a carboxylic acid's carbonyl peak is usually around 1700, and the O-H is very broad. Additionally, in such a case, the NMR would show a broad peak for the O-H proton, but the question doesn't mention that. However, the question says "several peaks including vinyl hydrogens," so maybe the O-H is exchange broadened and not clearly seen, or perhaps it's a broad peak elsewhere.

But then, if it's a carboxylic acid, the molecular formula would be C6H10O2, which is option C. Also, the presence of a vinyl group (double bond) would explain the NMR and the IR at 1650.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to match each option with the given data.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation = 1. So either a ring or a double bond. But our data suggests two DoU (from the carbonyl and the double bond), so this option may not fit.

Option B: C6H10O. DoU=2. So maybe a ring and a double bond. But where would the IR peaks come in? The 1700 cm^-1 would be a carbonyl, but with only O=1, perhaps a ketone. But then the O-H from where? Since it's C6H10O, and the O is one, perhaps it's a ketone and an alcohol. That would require O=2, but this option has O=1. So that doesn't fit.

Option C: C6H10O2. DoU=2. So a carbonyl (ester or ketone or acid) and a double bond. Also, O=2. So perhaps an ester with a double bond. Then, the O-H could be from an alcohol group. But that would require O=3. Hmm, that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is part of the ester group, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's not an O-H but an N-H, but the question says the IR peak is at 3000, which is more O-H than N-H.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a different functional group, like a phenol. But that would require a benzene ring, which would take up DoU. So, if the structure is a phenol with a double bond, that would be DoU=3 (ring and two double bonds?), but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the O-H is from a hemiacetal or something else, but I'm not sure.

Option D: C6H12O. DoU=1. So either a ring or a double bond. But the data suggests two DoU.

So the only option that fits with two DoU is C (DoU=2) and B (DoU=2). Let's think about O.

Option C has O2. So if the compound is an ester (O2), with a double bond, then the IR would show the ester carbonyl (1700) and the conjugated double bond (1650). But then where is the O-H from the IR? Because the O-H suggests another O-containing group.

Hmm, perhaps the O-H is not part of the main structure but is a solvent or something else. But that's unlikely.

Wait, unless the O-H is from an aliphatic alcohol. So the compound is an ester (O2) and an alcohol (O1), making O3. But none of the options have O3.

Wait, but the options don't have O3. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial IR analysis. Maybe the peak at 3000 cm^-1 isn't an O-H but something else.

Wait, another possibility: the broad peak at 3000 could be an N-H stretch. But the question says FTIR, which can sometimes pick up N-H as well. However, the question doesn't mention any other peaks that suggest N-containing groups.

Alternatively, maybe it's a C-H stretch, like from sp3 C-H or sp2 C-H. But that's usually around 2800-3000, but a broad peak suggests it's O-H or N-H.

Wait, another thought: maybe it's a secondary or tertiary alcohol. The O-H stretch in secondary alcohols is usually less broad than primary alcohols, but it's still a broad peak.

So, if it's a secondary alcohol, the structure would have O-H, a carbonyl group (like an ester), and a double bond. But that would require O3, which isn't an option. So perhaps the O-H is not present.

Wait, but the IR shows a strong peak at 3000, so O-H must be present.

Wait, unless the O-H is part of a carbonyl group, which doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the O-H is from a ketone? No, that's not possible.

Wait, maybe the O-H is from a carboxylic acid. So if the compound is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, the IR would have a very strong O-H peak (broad) around 2500-3300, which the question says it's at 3000. The carbonyl would be around 1700. The 1650 could be a conjugated double bond. Then the NMR would have vinyl protons.

So the molecular formula would be C6H10O2 (because a carboxylic acid has two O's). So option C.

But then, the mass fragment at 45. Let's think: the molecular formula is C6H10O2, molecular weight 114. The fragment at 45 would be 45/114 = about 39% of the molecular ion. So what could be a fragment with 45?

Perhaps the -COOH group loses something. Wait, COOH is 44 (12+16*2 +1?), no: COOH is (12 + 16*2 + 1) = 44? Wait, molecular weight of COOH group: 12 (C) + 16 (O) +16 (O) +1 (H) = 45. So the COOH group itself is 45. So if the molecule breaks off the COOH group, the fragment would be at m/z=45. But wait, COOH is 45. So that makes sense. So if the molecule is a carboxylic acid with a double bond, then the loss of COOH would give a fragment at 45.

Wait, but wait. If the compound is a carboxylic acid, the molecular formula would be C6H10O2. So the structure could be something like CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH.

Wait, that would have a double bond (CH2=CH...) and a carboxylic acid group (COOH). The IR would show a broad O-H (carboxylic acid) at 3000, the strong carbonyl at 1700, and the conjugated double bond at 1650. The NMR would show vinyl protons (the CH2=CH group) and the COOH proton, which would be exchange broadened and perhaps not seen as a sharp peak. So that fits.

But wait, the molecular formula for that structure (CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2COOH) would be C7H10O2. But the options are up to C6. So perhaps it's a shorter chain.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic structure. For example, a cyclohexene ring with a carboxylic acid group attached.

Wait, cyclohexene is C6H10. Adding a COOH group would make it C7H10O2, which again is beyond the options.

Hmm, perhaps the structure is an alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic acid. Structure like CH2=CHCOOH. That would be C3H4O2. But the options are C6, so perhaps it's a longer chain.

Wait, another approach: if the molecular formula is C6H10O2, and it's a carboxylic acid with a double bond, perhaps it's something like CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH. But that's C6H10O2. Wait, let me count:

CH2=CHCH2CH2COOH: that's 2 (from CH2=CH) + 2 (CH2CH2) + 2 (COOH) = 6 carbons. Correct. The formula is C6H10O2. So the molecular weight is (6*12)+(10*1)+(2*16)=72+10+32=114.

In the mass spectrum, when the molecule breaks, the COOH group (45) could come off, leaving a fragment of 114-45=69. So the fragment at m/z=45 would correspond to the COOH group.

So putting it all together, the data fits option C: C6H10O2.

Wait, but the initial IR analysis said a broad peak at 3000, which could be the carboxylic acid O-H. The 1700 is the COOH carbonyl, and the 1650 is the conjugated double bond. The NMR shows vinyl protons. The mass spectrum shows a fragment at 45, which matches the COOH group.

So the correct answer should be option C: C6H10O2.


The unknown compound is analyzed using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicating the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or alcohol. Two strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ suggest the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated system, such as an alpha, beta-unsaturated carbonyl. The ¹H NMR spectrum includes peaks corresponding to vinyl hydrogens, indicating the presence of a double bond. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, which is consistent with the loss of a carboxylic acid group (-COOH, molecular weight = 45).

The molecular formula options are evaluated based on the degree of unsaturation (DoU) and functional groups:

1. **Option A: C₆H₁₂O₂**  
   DoU = 1. This suggests either a ring or a double bond. However, the data indicates two degrees of unsaturation (from the carbonyl and the double bond), so this option is inconsistent.

2. **Option B: C₆H₁₀O**  
   DoU = 2. This could correspond to a double bond and a ring. However, the IR peak at 1700 cm⁻¹ indicates a carbonyl group, which requires oxygen, but this option only has one oxygen atom, making it inconsistent.

3. **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**  
   DoU = 2. This matches the two degrees of unsaturation (one from the carbonyl and one from the double bond). The IR peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm⁻¹ can be explained by a carboxylic acid carbonyl and a conjugated double bond. The broad peak at 3000 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid. The mass spectrum fragment at m/z = 45 is consistent with the loss of the -COOH group. This option fits all the data.

4. **Option D: C₆H₁₂O**  
   DoU = 1. This suggests either a ring or a double bond, but the data indicates two degrees of unsaturation, making this option inconsistent.

The most consistent explanation is that the compound is a carboxylic acid with a conjugated double bond, fitting the molecular formula **C₆H₁₀O₂**.

**Answer: C**
