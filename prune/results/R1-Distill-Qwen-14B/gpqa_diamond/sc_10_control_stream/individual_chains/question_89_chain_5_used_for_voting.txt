Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid molecule. The compound 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on the 1 and 3 positions of the adamantane structure.

The first reaction is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are given.

Looking at the IR spectrum: a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong peak, probably a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, maybe something like a ketone or an ester or an aldehyde. But since it's a solid product from a dibromide with KOH, perhaps it's an elimination reaction, forming an epoxide? Wait, no. Wait, KOH is a strong base, so perhaps an E2 elimination.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If both Brs are on adjacent or 1,3 positions—wait, adamantane's structure is a diamondoid, so positions 1 and 3 might be across each other. So if we have two Brs in 1 and 3 positions, and heat with KOH, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. Since KOH is a strong base, it could eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming a double bond.

Wait, but considering the product is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe it's elimination to form an allene (a conjugated diene?) or perhaps a cyclic structure. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide elimination to form an alkene. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, so which positions are the Brs on? Let me think, in adamantane, the 1 and 3 positions might refer to adjacent carbons or not. Wait, I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps in this scenario, when heated with KOH, it's a double elimination, removing two HBr molecules and forming a double bond. That would make product 1 a diene, perhaps an allene? Or maybe a single elimination, but that's less likely since KOH is in excess.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is more indicative of a ketone. Wait, but from a dihalide elimination, maybe it's forming an epoxide? No, because epoxides don't have a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe it's an elimination to form an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone? Or perhaps the KOH is causing a pinacol-like elimination, but that's usually for vicinal diols. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but no, that doesn't have a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. If both Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, then elimination would form a double bond. But if they're on 1 and 3 positions, perhaps it's a bridge structure. Wait, but if KOH is a base, maybe it's causing two elimination steps.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is a ketone. For that to happen, the structure would need to have a carbonyl group. How could that form from a dihalide? Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the KOH causes a substitution reaction, but with such a rigid structure, substitution might not be feasible. Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl peak, so product 1 is likely a ketone.

Wait, let me think again. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, perhaps it's an E2 elimination to form a double bond, but if the double bond is conjugated with a carbonyl, maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is forming a carbonyl via some oxidation, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diepoxide, but that doesn't explain the IR peak. Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. But how would you get that from a dihalide using KOH?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:

4.79 (2H) – maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O. A triplet or something. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is likely from some CH2 or CH groups, perhaps around the adamantane structure. Then 1.94 (2H) – another CH2 group.

So, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's a bridgehead ketone. For example, if two Brs are eliminated, and a carbonyl is formed. Wait, but elimination of two HBr would require adjacent Brs, but 1 and 3 positions might not be adjacent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the elimination isn't from the same carbon but adjacent. Wait, maybe the structure is such that when the two Brs are removed, a carbonyl is formed. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that would form an ether, which doesn't have a carbonyl. So maybe not.

Another approach: what reaction of dihalides gives a ketone upon treatment with KOH? Hmm, perhaps if it's a geminal dihalide, but in adamantane, the geminal positions are the same carbon, which would be 1,1-dibromoadamantane. But the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, not geminal.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexane ring or something. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide undergoes a double elimination to form a conjugated diene. But then, how would that give a carbonyl group?

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. No, because then we wouldn't expect a carbonyl in the IR. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a carbonyl because the two bromides are on adjacent carbons, and elimination forms a double bond, but then maybe another reaction occurs. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone due to some rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is not elimination but substitution. Wait, with KOH, substitution would require a good leaving group, which bromide is. But substitution would form an alkoxide, which upon protonation would give an alcohol. But the IR peak is at 1720, which is a carbonyl, so that's more likely a ketone than an alcohol. So substitution probably isn't the main pathway here.

Hmm, perhaps the product is a diol, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl peak.

Wait, maybe it's a beta-diketo structure. But I'm not seeing how that would form from a dihalide. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via some elimination of HBr and a rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a carbonyl formed via a double elimination, such as from 1,2-dibromide to form a ketone. Wait, but the starting material is 1,3-dibromide.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid, so it's four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions are two bridgehead carbons. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Brs on two bridgehead carbons.

When heated with KOH, perhaps each Br undergoes elimination, forming a double bond between the two bridgeheads. But wait, bridgeheads can't have double bonds because of Bredt's rule, which states that bridgehead positions (like in bicyclic systems) cannot support double bonds due to the angle strain. So maybe that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps the elimination isn't between the bridgeheads.

Wait, maybe each Br is on adjacent carbons in a way that allows elimination without involving the bridgehead. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, so when they eliminate, they form a double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by an -O- group, but that would form an epoxide if the two O atoms are connected across adjacent carbons. But in that case, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl, so that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H, maybe an -OCH2O- group, like in an epoxide. But wait, that's a singlet, but in an epoxide, the protons are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm and are a singlet if there are two equivalent protons. Hmm, but in an epoxide, the two protons are on adjacent carbons and are equivalent, so they'd be a singlet if the structure is symmetric.

Wait, but the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl, not an epoxide. So that's conflicting. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction forms a ketone via elimination of two HBr and forming a carbonyl group. For example, perhaps it's a pinacol-like rearrangement, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition elimination.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexanone derivative. If the starting material is a dihalide, and upon elimination, a cyclohexanone ring is formed. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the product. It's a solid, light yellow. KOH is a strong base, so perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond. But if that's the case, how do we get a carbonyl group?

Wait, perhaps the molecule undergoes two eliminations, each losing HBr and forming a double bond. But then, how does that lead to a carbonyl group? Hmm, maybe it's an elimination to form a conjugated diene, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm stuck on the first reaction, so perhaps I should look at the next steps and see if that gives me any clues.

So product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide upon heating to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 is a carbonyl compound, right? Because of the IR peak. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes some kind of acylation. Wait, but AlCl3 is more commonly used for Friedel-Crafts, but Al(OiPr)3 can also act as a catalyst.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone. So what reaction would a ketone undergo with a Lewis acid catalyst? Maybe some kind of enol formation or acylation. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone undergoes a Claisen or aldol condensation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, and the catalyst helps in ring-opening. But earlier I thought the IR doesn't fit an epoxide.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps in the presence of Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes some kind of ring expansion or other rearrangement.

Wait, but maybe product 1 is a diol. If that's the case, then Al(OiPr)3 could help in forming an acetal or something else. But then, the IR wouldn't have the carbonyl peak, so that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cycloketone, and under the influence of Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes ring-opening or other reactions.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think again about product 1. The IR has a peak at 1720, which is a strong, medium carbonyl. That's typical for a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone.

The NMR of product 1: 4.79 (2H) as a singlet. Maybe this is a CH2 group attached to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. But in a ketone, maybe it's adjacent to the carbonyl. Alternatively, it could be part of an enol structure, but that's less likely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene group next to an oxygen, such as OCH2O.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's a vicinal diketone. But then the NMR wouldn't have a singlet for 2H. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ketone, like a cyclohexanone derivative, with a substituent that gives the 4.79 ppm signal.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diethyl ketone or something similar, but the adamantane structure is more likely to have a bridgehead substitution.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone where the carbonyl is at a bridgehead, but that's not allowed because bridgehead carbonyls are possible, but perhaps the structure is such that the 4.79 ppm is from a CH2 group adjacent to the bridgehead.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should think about the sequence.

Product 1 is treated with excess Al(OiPr)3 upon heating, forming product 2. Then, product 2 is ozonolyzed at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, forming product 3. The question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. But let's think step by step.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a di-tertiary bromide, which upon elimination forms a conjugated diene. Then, product 1 would have a double bond. But that doesn't fit with the IR carbonyl peak.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and then product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone formed via some reaction with Al(OiPr)3. For example, if product 1 is a ketone, maybe product 2 is an enone (alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone) formed via a conjugate addition or some rearrangement. Then, ozonolysis of the double bond in product 2 would cleave it into two carbonyls, but perhaps the structure is such that one of the resulting carbonyl groups is adjacent to some protons that have a certain coupling pattern.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a di-substituted ketone, and product 2 is a dienone (with a conjugated double bond). Ozonolysis would then break the double bond into two carbonyls, each connected to some hydrogen atoms.

Wait, but let me try to outline the possible structures.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's a bridgehead ketone. Then, product 2, after treatment with Al(OiPr)3, might undergo some kind of ring expansion or form a double bond. For example, the ketone could form an enol which then loses a proton to form a double bond, creating an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. That would make product 2 an enone.

Then, ozonolysis of the double bond in product 2 would cleave it. Ozonolysis typically breaks the double bond into two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is an enone like RC(O)CH2CH2CO, ozonolysis would break the double bond between the two CH2 groups, producing two carbonyl compounds.

But I'm not sure about the exact structure. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, which upon ozonolysis would form carbonyl groups. But let's think about the NMR of product 3 after ozonolysis.

Product 3's NMR is the focus. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with solvent. So, which hydrogen in product 3 would be the most deshielded?

Deshielded hydrogens are typically those in electron-deficient areas, like near electronegative atoms or in conjugated systems. For example, a proton adjacent to a carbonyl group would be deshielded and appear downfield.

In ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each resulting fragment becomes a carbonyl compound. So if product 3 comes from ozonolysis, it's likely a diketone or two separate carbonyl compounds. But in our case, product 3 is a single compound, so perhaps the ozonolysis of a symmetric diene would give two identical carbonyl groups connected somehow.

Wait, but product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, then workup with dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis usually results in the cleavage of the double bond to form carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond between carbons A and B, ozonolysis would break it into A-O and B-O groups, but with DMS as a reductant, perhaps the ozonides are cleaved to form aldehydes or ketones.

Wait, in the presence of dimethyl sulfide, which is a mild reductant, the ozonide would typically cleave to form carbonyl groups without further oxidation. So for a simple alkene, ozonolysis would give two carbonyl compounds. But if the alkene is part of a ring, it could break the ring and form two carbonyls.

But perhaps in this problem, product 2 is a cyclic diene. Then, ozonolysis would break the ring and form two carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a conjugated dienone, which upon ozonolysis would yield two ketones.

But how does this tie back to the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in product 3?

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's consider what kind of coupling that would have.

In a simple case, a proton next to a carbonyl (like in an aldehyde) would be split by neighboring protons. But in our case, product 3's structure might have a proton that's coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons, leading to a more complex splitting pattern.

Wait, for example, if the proton is adjacent to a carbonyl and is between two CH2 groups, each with two protons, it could couple with each set, leading to a triplet of triplets or some other pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the proton is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and each of the adjacent groups has two protons, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but I'm not getting the exact structure. Let me try to piece it together.

Starting again:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH to form product 1, which is a ketone (due to IR at 1720 cm⁻¹). The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 (2H), which might be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps in an epoxide or an ether, but since it's a ketone, perhaps it's part of a cycloketone.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is adamantanedione, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's a mono-substituted ketone.

Then, product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3 upon heating, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts, but since product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's involved in an acylation. Alternatively, it may facilitate the formation of an enol, which could then form a double bond.

So, product 2 could be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone), which would have a conjugated double bond next to the carbonyl.

Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 is an enone (RCOCH2CH2CO), ozonolysis would break the central double bond into two carbonyl groups. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a dienone, such as a cyclohexene ring with a ketone group. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls, perhaps forming two ketones or an aldehyde and a ketone, depending on the structure.

But perhaps after ozonolysis, product 3 would have a structure like two carbonyl groups connected via some chain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, not conjugated with a ketone. Then, ozonolysis would break the diene into two aldehydes or ketones.

Wait, but product 3 is the result of ozonolysis. Let's think about the structure of product 3. Suppose product 2 is a conjugated diene. Ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would typically yield two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would give two formaldehyde molecules. But our starting material is adamantane-based, so the product would have a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond and form two carbonyl groups, possibly creating a diketone or similar.

But I'm not making much progress, so perhaps I should consider the possible options for the coupling pattern.

The options are:

A) triplet
B) triplet of triplets
C) doublet of triplets
D) pentet

The most deshielded proton in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's imagine it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Each of the two protons on this CH2 would couple with neighboring protons.

Wait, but perhaps the structure is such that the proton is adjacent to a carbonyl and is coupled to two different sets of protons. For example, a proton that is next to a carbonyl and is between two CH2 groups, each with two protons. Then, each set of two protons would split the signal into a triplet, but since there are two different J values, it could lead to a triplet of triplets or something else.

Wait, another scenario: the proton is on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl and is next to another CH2 group, which is itself next to another CH2. So, the proton on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be split by the neighboring CH2 groups. If each neighboring CH2 has two protons, the splitting would be a triplet due to each neighboring group. But if there are two such neighboring groups, each causing a triplet split, the overall pattern could be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the proton is adjacent to two different groups, each with two protons, it could lead to a more complex coupling. For example, if the proton is next to a CH2 and another CH2, each with two protons, the coupling constants (J) might be similar, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But wait, another possibility: if the proton is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and the adjacent groups are each CH2, each with two protons, the coupling would be a triplet from each adjacent CH2. So, the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the proton is part of a vinyl group, but that's less likely since ozonolysis would break the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is such that the most deshielded proton is on a CH2 adjacent to two carbonyl groups. No, that might not be possible because ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls, so perhaps the CH2 is between two carbonyls.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diketone with a CH2 group between the two carbonyls. The protons on this CH2 would be deshielded due to being between two carbonyls. Each CH2 proton would couple with the neighboring groups. If each adjacent group is a CH2 with two protons, it would split into a triplet. But if both adjacent groups are CH2, each with two protons, the splitting would be more complex.

Wait, but perhaps each CH2 group is only split by one neighboring group, leading to a triplet. Or perhaps the coupling is with two different groups, each providing a splitting, leading to a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Another angle: in product 3, the most deshielded proton is on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say it's a CH group. Then, it would have neighboring protons. For example, if it's a CH next to a carbonyl and has two neighboring CH2 groups, each with two protons, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but the question states "the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)". So, perhaps it's a proton adjacent to a carbonyl group, which is deshielded.

Putting it all together, perhaps the coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets, making option B the correct answer.

The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C produces a light yellow solid product 1. The IR spectrum shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group, likely a ketone. The ¹H NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H singlet; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a ketone structure, possibly with a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl and other hydrogens in the adamantane framework.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**:  
   Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide upon heating, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely facilitates the formation of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone) from the ketone in product 1. This involves the formation of a double bond conjugated with the carbonyl group.

3. **Ozonolysis of Product 2**:  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide, cleaves the double bond in the enone, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds to yield carbonyl compounds. In this case, the cleavage likely results in a diketone or similar structure.

4. **¹H NMR of Product 3**:  
   The question focuses on the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. Deshielded hydrogens are typically those near electronegative groups like carbonyls. If the structure of product 3 includes a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, the protons on this CH₂ would be deshielded. These protons would couple with neighboring groups, such as two CH₂ groups, each contributing a splitting. This would result in a **triplet of triplets** coupling pattern.

Given the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is best described as a **triplet of triplets**.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. I remember that adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so it's a pretty rigid molecule. The compound 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have bromine atoms on the 1 and 3 positions of the adamantane structure.

The first reaction is heating this compound with excess KOH at 240°C, which gives a light yellow solid product 1. The NMR and IR data are given.

Looking at the IR spectrum: a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹. That's a strong peak, probably a carbonyl (C=O) stretch. So, maybe something like a ketone or an ester or an aldehyde. But since it's a solid product from a dibromide with KOH, perhaps it's an elimination reaction, forming an epoxide? Wait, no. Wait, KOH is a strong base, so perhaps an E2 elimination.

Wait, but 1,3-dibromoadamantane. If both Brs are on adjacent or 1,3 positions—wait, adamantane's structure is a diamondoid, so positions 1 and 3 might be across each other. So if we have two Brs in 1 and 3 positions, and heat with KOH, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation. Since KOH is a strong base, it could eliminate two equivalents of HBr, forming a double bond.

Wait, but considering the product is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, maybe it's elimination to form an allene (a conjugated diene?) or perhaps a cyclic structure. Wait, no. Alternatively, maybe it's a vicinal dihalide elimination to form an alkene. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is 1,3-dibromo, so which positions are the Brs on? Let me think, in adamantane, the 1 and 3 positions might refer to adjacent carbons or not. Wait, I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps in this scenario, when heated with KOH, it's a double elimination, removing two HBr molecules and forming a double bond. That would make product 1 a diene, perhaps an allene? Or maybe a single elimination, but that's less likely since KOH is in excess.

Wait, but the IR shows a peak at 1720 cm⁻¹, which is more indicative of a ketone. Wait, but from a dihalide elimination, maybe it's forming an epoxide? No, because epoxides don't have a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe it's an elimination to form an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone? Or perhaps the KOH is causing a pinacol-like elimination, but that's usually for vicinal diols. Alternatively, perhaps the product is an epoxide, but no, that doesn't have a carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let's think about the reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. If both Br atoms are on adjacent carbons, then elimination would form a double bond. But if they're on 1 and 3 positions, perhaps it's a bridge structure. Wait, but if KOH is a base, maybe it's causing two elimination steps.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product is a ketone. For that to happen, the structure would need to have a carbonyl group. How could that form from a dihalide? Maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation followed by some rearrangement, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the KOH causes a substitution reaction, but with such a rigid structure, substitution might not be feasible. Wait, but the IR has a carbonyl peak, so product 1 is likely a ketone.

Wait, let me think again. If 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH, perhaps it's an E2 elimination to form a double bond, but if the double bond is conjugated with a carbonyl, maybe an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is forming a carbonyl via some oxidation, but KOH is a base, not an oxidizing agent. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diepoxide, but that doesn't explain the IR peak. Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. But how would you get that from a dihalide using KOH?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about the NMR data. The 1H NMR shows:

4.79 (2H) – maybe a CH2 group adjacent to an electronegative atom, like O. A triplet or something. The 2.41-2.23 (10H) is likely from some CH2 or CH groups, perhaps around the adamantane structure. Then 1.94 (2H) – another CH2 group.

So, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's a bridgehead ketone. For example, if two Brs are eliminated, and a carbonyl is formed. Wait, but elimination of two HBr would require adjacent Brs, but 1 and 3 positions might not be adjacent. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the elimination isn't from the same carbon but adjacent. Wait, maybe the structure is such that when the two Brs are removed, a carbonyl is formed. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where each Br is replaced by an O- group, but that would form an ether, which doesn't have a carbonyl. So maybe not.

Another approach: what reaction of dihalides gives a ketone upon treatment with KOH? Hmm, perhaps if it's a geminal dihalide, but in adamantane, the geminal positions are the same carbon, which would be 1,1-dibromoadamantane. But the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, not geminal.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexane ring or something. Alternatively, maybe the dihalide undergoes a double elimination to form a conjugated diene. But then, how would that give a carbonyl group?

Wait, maybe the product is an epoxide. No, because then we wouldn't expect a carbonyl in the IR. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the product is a carbonyl because the two bromides are on adjacent carbons, and elimination forms a double bond, but then maybe another reaction occurs. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone due to some rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial reaction is not elimination but substitution. Wait, with KOH, substitution would require a good leaving group, which bromide is. But substitution would form an alkoxide, which upon protonation would give an alcohol. But the IR peak is at 1720, which is a carbonyl, so that's more likely a ketone than an alcohol. So substitution probably isn't the main pathway here.

Hmm, perhaps the product is a diol, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl peak.

Wait, maybe it's a beta-diketo structure. But I'm not seeing how that would form from a dihalide. Alternatively, perhaps the product is a ketone formed via some elimination of HBr and a rearrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the product is a carbonyl formed via a double elimination, such as from 1,2-dibromide to form a ketone. Wait, but the starting material is 1,3-dibromide.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure. Adamantane is a diamondoid, so it's four cyclohexane rings fused together. The 1 and 3 positions are two bridgehead carbons. So, 1,3-dibromoadamantane would have Brs on two bridgehead carbons.

When heated with KOH, perhaps each Br undergoes elimination, forming a double bond between the two bridgeheads. But wait, bridgeheads can't have double bonds because of Bredt's rule, which states that bridgehead positions (like in bicyclic systems) cannot support double bonds due to the angle strain. So maybe that's not possible. Therefore, perhaps the elimination isn't between the bridgeheads.

Wait, maybe each Br is on adjacent carbons in a way that allows elimination without involving the bridgehead. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, so when they eliminate, they form a double bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where each Br is replaced by an -O- group, but that would form an epoxide if the two O atoms are connected across adjacent carbons. But in that case, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl, so that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the NMR. The 4.79 ppm is a singlet for 2H, maybe an -OCH2O- group, like in an epoxide. But wait, that's a singlet, but in an epoxide, the protons are usually around 3.5-4.5 ppm and are a singlet if there are two equivalent protons. Hmm, but in an epoxide, the two protons are on adjacent carbons and are equivalent, so they'd be a singlet if the structure is symmetric.

Wait, but the IR at 1720 cm⁻¹ suggests a carbonyl, not an epoxide. So that's conflicting. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the reaction forms a ketone via elimination of two HBr and forming a carbonyl group. For example, perhaps it's a pinacol-like rearrangement, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugate addition elimination.

Wait, perhaps the product is a cyclohexanone derivative. If the starting material is a dihalide, and upon elimination, a cyclohexanone ring is formed. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the product. It's a solid, light yellow. KOH is a strong base, so perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form a double bond. But if that's the case, how do we get a carbonyl group?

Wait, perhaps the molecule undergoes two eliminations, each losing HBr and forming a double bond. But then, how does that lead to a carbonyl group? Hmm, maybe it's an elimination to form a conjugated diene, but that wouldn't explain the carbonyl.

Wait, maybe I'm stuck on the first reaction, so perhaps I should look at the next steps and see if that gives me any clues.

So product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide upon heating to form product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide (Al(OiPr)3) is a Lewis acid catalyst, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But product 1 is a carbonyl compound, right? Because of the IR peak. So perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and when treated with Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes some kind of acylation. Wait, but AlCl3 is more commonly used for Friedel-Crafts, but Al(OiPr)3 can also act as a catalyst.

Wait, but product 1 is a ketone. So what reaction would a ketone undergo with a Lewis acid catalyst? Maybe some kind of enol formation or acylation. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone undergoes a Claisen or aldol condensation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe product 1 is an epoxide, and the catalyst helps in ring-opening. But earlier I thought the IR doesn't fit an epoxide.

Alternatively, if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps in the presence of Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes some kind of ring expansion or other rearrangement.

Wait, but maybe product 1 is a diol. If that's the case, then Al(OiPr)3 could help in forming an acetal or something else. But then, the IR wouldn't have the carbonyl peak, so that's probably not it.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a cycloketone, and under the influence of Al(OiPr)3, it undergoes ring-opening or other reactions.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck. Let me think again about product 1. The IR has a peak at 1720, which is a strong, medium carbonyl. That's typical for a ketone. So product 1 is a ketone.

The NMR of product 1: 4.79 (2H) as a singlet. Maybe this is a CH2 group attached to an oxygen, like an ether or an ester. But in a ketone, maybe it's adjacent to the carbonyl. Alternatively, it could be part of an enol structure, but that's less likely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methylene group next to an oxygen, such as OCH2O.

Wait, but if product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's a vicinal diketone. But then the NMR wouldn't have a singlet for 2H. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ketone, like a cyclohexanone derivative, with a substituent that gives the 4.79 ppm signal.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a diethyl ketone or something similar, but the adamantane structure is more likely to have a bridgehead substitution.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a ketone where the carbonyl is at a bridgehead, but that's not allowed because bridgehead carbonyls are possible, but perhaps the structure is such that the 4.79 ppm is from a CH2 group adjacent to the bridgehead.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should think about the sequence.

Product 1 is treated with excess Al(OiPr)3 upon heating, forming product 2. Then, product 2 is ozonolyzed at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide, forming product 3. The question asks about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3's NMR.

Ozonolysis typically cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls. But let's think step by step.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a di-tertiary bromide, which upon elimination forms a conjugated diene. Then, product 1 would have a double bond. But that doesn't fit with the IR carbonyl peak.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is a ketone, and then product 2 is an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone formed via some reaction with Al(OiPr)3. For example, if product 1 is a ketone, maybe product 2 is an enone (alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone) formed via a conjugate addition or some rearrangement. Then, ozonolysis of the double bond in product 2 would cleave it into two carbonyls, but perhaps the structure is such that one of the resulting carbonyl groups is adjacent to some protons that have a certain coupling pattern.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is a di-substituted ketone, and product 2 is a dienone (with a conjugated double bond). Ozonolysis would then break the double bond into two carbonyls, each connected to some hydrogen atoms.

Wait, but let me try to outline the possible structures.

Assuming product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's a bridgehead ketone. Then, product 2, after treatment with Al(OiPr)3, might undergo some kind of ring expansion or form a double bond. For example, the ketone could form an enol which then loses a proton to form a double bond, creating an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone. That would make product 2 an enone.

Then, ozonolysis of the double bond in product 2 would cleave it. Ozonolysis typically breaks the double bond into two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is an enone like RC(O)CH2CH2CO, ozonolysis would break the double bond between the two CH2 groups, producing two carbonyl compounds.

But I'm not sure about the exact structure. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, which upon ozonolysis would form carbonyl groups. But let's think about the NMR of product 3 after ozonolysis.

Product 3's NMR is the focus. The question is about the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen, excluding those that exchange with solvent. So, which hydrogen in product 3 would be the most deshielded?

Deshielded hydrogens are typically those in electron-deficient areas, like near electronegative atoms or in conjugated systems. For example, a proton adjacent to a carbonyl group would be deshielded and appear downfield.

In ozonolysis, the double bond is cleaved, and each resulting fragment becomes a carbonyl compound. So if product 3 comes from ozonolysis, it's likely a diketone or two separate carbonyl compounds. But in our case, product 3 is a single compound, so perhaps the ozonolysis of a symmetric diene would give two identical carbonyl groups connected somehow.

Wait, but product 3 is formed by ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, then workup with dimethyl sulfide. Ozonolysis usually results in the cleavage of the double bond to form carbonyl groups. So if product 2 has a double bond between carbons A and B, ozonolysis would break it into A-O and B-O groups, but with DMS as a reductant, perhaps the ozonides are cleaved to form aldehydes or ketones.

Wait, in the presence of dimethyl sulfide, which is a mild reductant, the ozonide would typically cleave to form carbonyl groups without further oxidation. So for a simple alkene, ozonolysis would give two carbonyl compounds. But if the alkene is part of a ring, it could break the ring and form two carbonyls.

But perhaps in this problem, product 2 is a cyclic diene. Then, ozonolysis would break the ring and form two carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a conjugated dienone, which upon ozonolysis would yield two ketones.

But how does this tie back to the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in product 3?

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded hydrogen is adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's consider what kind of coupling that would have.

In a simple case, a proton next to a carbonyl (like in an aldehyde) would be split by neighboring protons. But in our case, product 3's structure might have a proton that's coupled to two different sets of neighboring protons, leading to a more complex splitting pattern.

Wait, for example, if the proton is adjacent to a carbonyl and is between two CH2 groups, each with two protons, it could couple with each set, leading to a triplet of triplets or some other pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps the proton is part of a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and each of the adjacent groups has two protons, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but I'm not getting the exact structure. Let me try to piece it together.

Starting again:

1. 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with KOH to form product 1, which is a ketone (due to IR at 1720 cm⁻¹). The NMR shows a singlet at 4.79 (2H), which might be a CH2 group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps in an epoxide or an ether, but since it's a ketone, perhaps it's part of a cycloketone.

Wait, perhaps product 1 is adamantanedione, but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's a mono-substituted ketone.

Then, product 1 is treated with Al(OiPr)3 upon heating, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide is a Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts, but since product 1 is a ketone, perhaps it's involved in an acylation. Alternatively, it may facilitate the formation of an enol, which could then form a double bond.

So, product 2 could be an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone), which would have a conjugated double bond next to the carbonyl.

Then, product 2 undergoes ozonolysis. Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds to form carbonyl groups. So, if product 2 is an enone (RCOCH2CH2CO), ozonolysis would break the central double bond into two carbonyl groups. Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact structure.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a dienone, such as a cyclohexene ring with a ketone group. Ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls, perhaps forming two ketones or an aldehyde and a ketone, depending on the structure.

But perhaps after ozonolysis, product 3 would have a structure like two carbonyl groups connected via some chain.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a diene, not conjugated with a ketone. Then, ozonolysis would break the diene into two aldehydes or ketones.

Wait, but product 3 is the result of ozonolysis. Let's think about the structure of product 3. Suppose product 2 is a conjugated diene. Ozonolysis of a conjugated diene would typically yield two carbonyl groups. For example, if product 2 is 1,3-pentadiene, ozonolysis would give two formaldehyde molecules. But our starting material is adamantane-based, so the product would have a more complex structure.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is a bridged bicyclic compound with a double bond. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond and form two carbonyl groups, possibly creating a diketone or similar.

But I'm not making much progress, so perhaps I should consider the possible options for the coupling pattern.

The options are:

A) triplet
B) triplet of triplets
C) doublet of triplets
D) pentet

The most deshielded proton in product 3 is likely adjacent to a carbonyl group. Let's imagine it's a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Each of the two protons on this CH2 would couple with neighboring protons.

Wait, but perhaps the structure is such that the proton is adjacent to a carbonyl and is coupled to two different sets of protons. For example, a proton that is next to a carbonyl and is between two CH2 groups, each with two protons. Then, each set of two protons would split the signal into a triplet, but since there are two different J values, it could lead to a triplet of triplets or something else.

Wait, another scenario: the proton is on a CH2 adjacent to a carbonyl and is next to another CH2 group, which is itself next to another CH2. So, the proton on the CH2 adjacent to the carbonyl would be split by the neighboring CH2 groups. If each neighboring CH2 has two protons, the splitting would be a triplet due to each neighboring group. But if there are two such neighboring groups, each causing a triplet split, the overall pattern could be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, if the proton is adjacent to two different groups, each with two protons, it could lead to a more complex coupling. For example, if the proton is next to a CH2 and another CH2, each with two protons, the coupling constants (J) might be similar, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But wait, another possibility: if the proton is on a CH2 group next to a carbonyl, and the adjacent groups are each CH2, each with two protons, the coupling would be a triplet from each adjacent CH2. So, the overall pattern would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the proton is part of a vinyl group, but that's less likely since ozonolysis would break the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is such that the most deshielded proton is on a CH2 adjacent to two carbonyl groups. No, that might not be possible because ozonolysis would break the double bond into two carbonyls, so perhaps the CH2 is between two carbonyls.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a diketone with a CH2 group between the two carbonyls. The protons on this CH2 would be deshielded due to being between two carbonyls. Each CH2 proton would couple with the neighboring groups. If each adjacent group is a CH2 with two protons, it would split into a triplet. But if both adjacent groups are CH2, each with two protons, the splitting would be more complex.

Wait, but perhaps each CH2 group is only split by one neighboring group, leading to a triplet. Or perhaps the coupling is with two different groups, each providing a splitting, leading to a doublet of triplets or a triplet of triplets.

Another angle: in product 3, the most deshielded proton is on a carbon adjacent to a carbonyl. Let's say it's a CH group. Then, it would have neighboring protons. For example, if it's a CH next to a carbonyl and has two neighboring CH2 groups, each with two protons, the splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Wait, but the question states "the most deshielded hydrogen atom (excluding those that will exchange with deuterated solvent)". So, perhaps it's a proton adjacent to a carbonyl group, which is deshielded.

Putting it all together, perhaps the coupling pattern is a triplet of triplets, making option B the correct answer.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   Heating 1,3-dibromoadamantane with excess KOH at 240°C produces a light yellow solid product 1. The IR spectrum shows a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group, likely a ketone. The ¹H NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H singlet; 2.41-2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a ketone structure, possibly with a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl and other hydrogens in the adamantane framework.

2. **Reaction with Al(OiPr)₃**:  
   Product 1 is treated with excess aluminum isopropoxide upon heating, forming product 2. Aluminum isopropoxide, a Lewis acid, likely facilitates the formation of an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone (enone) from the ketone in product 1. This involves the formation of a double bond conjugated with the carbonyl group.

3. **Ozonolysis of Product 2**:  
   Ozonolysis of product 2 at -78°C, followed by addition of dimethyl sulfide, cleaves the double bond in the enone, forming product 3. Ozonolysis typically breaks double bonds to yield carbonyl compounds. In this case, the cleavage likely results in a diketone or similar structure.

4. **¹H NMR of Product 3**:  
   The question focuses on the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3. Deshielded hydrogens are typically those near electronegative groups like carbonyls. If the structure of product 3 includes a CH₂ group adjacent to a carbonyl, the protons on this CH₂ would be deshielded. These protons would couple with neighboring groups, such as two CH₂ groups, each contributing a splitting. This would result in a **triplet of triplets** coupling pattern.

Given the analysis, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is best described as a **triplet of triplets**.

Answer: B
