Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about an electron's state and measuring probabilities for a certain operator. Also, finding the average value of that operator. Alright, let's break it down.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, I think I should normalize this state because the coefficients probably don't sum up to 1. Let me calculate the norm.

The norm squared is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each coefficient. So for (1+i), the absolute value squared is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. For (2-i), it's (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 + 1 = 5. So total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ].

Now, the operator in question has a matrix representation A where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. Wait, so this is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out. The diagonal elements A_11 and A_22 are zero. The off-diagonal elements A_12 and A_21 are ħ/2 each. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0  ]

Hmm, this matrix resembles the Pauli matrices. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], but scaled by ħ/2 here. So, operator A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, I think the Pauli matrices are usually represented as σx, σy, σz. So A would be (ħ/2) σx. Because σx has off-diagonal elements 1 and 1. So yes, A is (ħ/2) σx.

Now, measuring the eigenstates of operator A. Oh wait, wait—when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the states are the eigenstates. So the eigenvalues of A are the same as the eigenvalues of σx scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, the eigenvalues of σx are +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)(+1) = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)(-1) = -ħ/2.

But wait, the question is about the probabilities of measuring in each eigenstate. So I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and then the probabilities would be the squares of the coefficients.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σx, its eigenstates are the same as σx's. The eigenstates of σx are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)}.

Wait, let me confirm. For σx, the eigenstates are the superpositions where up and down are equally weighted with a +1 and -1 in the coefficients. So yes, (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) is one eigenstate, and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) is the other.

So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

But wait, let's think differently. The operator A has matrix elements A_12 = A_21 = ħ/2, and A_11 = A_22 = 0. So it's a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

So, the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of σx, which are (|+x> and |−x>) in the spin-1/2 system.

So, to find the probability of measuring each eigenvalue, we can expand |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach would be to find the eigenvectors of A and then compute the inner product with |alpha>.

Wait, but maybe I can diagonalize A by finding its eigenvectors. Let me try that.

The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]. So, to find eigenvectors, we solve (A - λI) v = 0.

The characteristic equation is determinant of [[-λ, ħ/2],[ħ/2, -λ]] = 0. So determinant is λ^2 - (ħ/2)^2 = 0. So λ^2 = (ħ^2)/4, so λ = ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2, as I thought earlier.

Now, for λ = ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I) = [[-ħ/2, ħ/2],[ħ/2, -ħ/2]]

The equations are:

-ħ/2 v1 + ħ/2 v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1,1). So |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). Wait, but our state |alpha> is a combination of |up> and |down>, so perhaps we can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x> (which are (|up> +|down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> -|down>)/sqrt(2), respectively).

So, let me write |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

First, let me write |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |−x>. 

We have:

|up> = (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2)

So, substituting into |alpha>, which is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, we get:

(1+i) [ (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2) ] + (2 - i) [ (|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2) ]

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2):

[ (1+i)(|+x> + |−x>) ) + (2 - i)(|+x> - |−x>) ] / sqrt(2)

Expanding this:

[ (1+i + 2 -i)|+x> + (1+i - (2 -i))|−x> ] / sqrt(2)

Wait, let's compute the coefficients:

For |+x>:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = (1+2) + (i -i) = 3. So coefficient is 3.

For |−x>:

(1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

So putting it all together:

[3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i)|−x> ] / sqrt(2)

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me re-calculate.

Let me distribute the terms:

(1+i)|up> = (1+i) ( |+x> + |−x> ) / sqrt(2)
(2 -i)|down> = (2 -i) ( |+x> - |−x> ) / sqrt(2)

So when adding them:

[ (1+i)(|+x> + |−x>) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |−x>) ] / sqrt(2)

Factor out |+x> and |−x>:

|+x> [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(2) + |−x> [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(2)

Compute the coefficients:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 1 + 2 + i -i = 3.

(1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 -2 +i +i = (-1) + 2i.

So, |alpha> becomes [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i)|−x> ] / sqrt(2)

Wait, but this should all be multiplied by 1/sqrt(7) because |alpha> is normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

Wait, no. Wait, the initial |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, and when we express in terms of |+x> and |−x>, I have to consider the normalization. Let me re-express all steps.

Wait, the original |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

So, substituting |up> and |down> as before:

(1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) * (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2) + (2 -i) * (|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2) ) ]

Factor 1/(sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) ):

[ (1+i) (|+x> + |−x>) + (2 -i) (|+x> - |−x>) ) ] / sqrt(14)

Wait, because sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) = sqrt(14).

Now, expanding the numerator:

(1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|−x> + (2 -i)|+x> - (2 -i)|−x>

Combine like terms:

[ (1+i + 2 -i) |+x> ] + [ (1+i - (2 -i)) |−x> ]

Simplify:

(3) |+x> + [ (1 +i -2 +i) ] |−x> 

Which is 3 |+x> + ( -1 + 2i ) |−x>

So numerator is 3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |−x>, and denominator is sqrt(14).

So |alpha> = [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i)|−x> ] / sqrt(14)

Hmm, now the coefficients for |+x> and |−x> are 3/sqrt(14) and (-1+2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probability of measuring the eigenvalue +ħ/2 (which corresponds to |+x>) is the square of the absolute value of the coefficient of |+x>, right?

So, the coefficient is 3/sqrt(14). The absolute value squared is (3^2)/(14) )= 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Similarly, the coefficient for |−x> is (-1+2i)/sqrt(14). The absolute value squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, wait, 5/14 is about 0.357, which is 0.357 when approximated. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.643 and 0.357. Looking at the options, let's check:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36. That seems close, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 ≈ 0.357, which is 0.357. So option A has these probabilities, but let me check the other options.

Wait, option D has 0.61 and 0.29, which doesn’t match.

Okay, so probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

Now, the average value of the operator A. The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σx, the expectation value is (ħ/2) <sigma_x>.

The expectation value of sigma_x in state |alpha> is ( <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> ), which can be found using the expansion in |+x> and |−x> states.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler way is to compute it directly.

Wait, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

So, the expectation value <A> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ]^dagger A (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

Wait, since A is a matrix, let me compute it as <alpha| A |alpha>.

The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So, |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

So, the vector representation is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So, <alpha| is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

So, compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Which is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] multiplied by A multiplied by [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

So, let's compute each part.

First, A is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]

So, compute A multiplied by the vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

A * vector = [0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (ħ/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

So this becomes:

[ ( (ħ/2)*(2 -i) ) / sqrt(7), ( (ħ/2)*(1+i) ) / sqrt(7) ]

Simplify:

( (2 -i) ħ/2 ) / sqrt(7) = ( (2 ħ/2 ) - (i ħ)/2 ) ) / sqrt(7) → ( ħ - i ħ/2 ) / sqrt(7)

Similarly, (1+i) ħ/2 / sqrt(7) = ( ħ/2 + i ħ/2 ) / sqrt(7)

Now, multiply <alpha| with this result.

<alpha| is [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

So, the inner product is:

(1 - i)/sqrt(7) * [ (ħ - i ħ/2 ) / sqrt(7) ] + (2 + i)/sqrt(7) * [ (ħ/2 + i ħ/2 ) / sqrt(7) ]

Let me compute each term separately.

First term:
(1 - i)( ħ - i ħ/2 ) / 7
= ħ (1 - i) [1 - i/2 ] /7
Multiply out (1 - i)(1 - i/2):
= 1*(1) + 1*(-i/2) -i*(1) + i*(i/2)
= 1 - i/2 - i + (i^2)/2
= 1 - (3i/2) + (-1/2)
= (1 - 1/2) - (3i/2)
= (1/2) - (3i/2)

So first term: ħ (1/2 - 3i/2 ) /7

Second term:
(2 +i) ( ħ/2 + i ħ/2 ) /7
= ħ/2 (2 +i)(1 + i) /7
Compute (2 +i)(1 +i):
= 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i
= 2 + 2i +i + (-1)
= (2 -1) + 3i
= 1 + 3i

So second term: (ħ/2)(1 +3i)/7 = ħ (1 +3i)/(14)

Now, adding both terms:

Term1 + Term2 = [ ħ (1/2 - 3i/2 ) /7 ] + [ ħ (1 +3i)/(14) ]

Let me factor ħ and 1/14:

= ħ/(14) [ ( (1/2 -3i/2)*2 ) + (1 +3i) ) ]

Because 1/7 is 2/14, so the first term is multiplied by 2.

So inside the brackets:

(1/2 *2)=1, (-3i/2 *2) =-3i → (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ) 

Adding these: 1 +1 =2, -3i +3i=0 → 2.

So overall: ħ/(14) * 2 = ħ/7.

So the expectation value <A> is ħ/7.

Wait, but wait. Hmm. Because A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, and the expectation value is the weighted average of these, weighted by the probabilities.

Given that the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14 for +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively, the average value would be (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) ) = [ (9 -5) * ħ/2 ] /14 → (4 ħ/2) /14 → (2 ħ) /14 → ħ/7. Which matches what I got earlier. So that makes sense.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average hbar/7. So 0.64 is 9/14 ≈0.6428, 5/14≈0.357. So option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which are close. Hmm, but 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places. So that's option A.

But wait, let me check the calculation of the probabilities again. The coefficient for |+x> is 3/sqrt(14), so |3/sqrt(14)|^2 is 9/14 ≈ 0.6428. And the other is 5/14≈0.357. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64 and 0.36 → which would correspond to 9/14 and 5/14 (rounded to two decimals). But wait, 9/14 is exactly 0.642857..., which rounds to 0.64 as per the option.

Option A's average is hbar/7, which matches with our calculation.

So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but wait—let me check the other options. Option D has an average of 2 hbar/sqrt(7), which is larger. Option B has average 3 hbar/sqrt(7), which is way bigger. Option C's average is hbar/sqrt(7), which is about 2.64 times larger than our result. So option A seems correct.

The problem involves an electron in the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( \hat{A} \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( \hat{A} \) must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The norm of \( |\alpha\rangle \) is calculated as:
\[
\text{Norm}^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right].
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( \hat{A} \)
The operator \( \hat{A} \) has a matrix representation:
\[
\hat{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix, scaled by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The eigenstates of \( \hat{A} \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
Substituting \( |\uparrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+x\rangle + |-x\rangle \right) \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+x\rangle - |-x\rangle \right) \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \), we get:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+x\rangle + |-x\rangle \right) + (2-i) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+x\rangle - |-x\rangle \right) \right].
\]
Simplifying:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ 3|+x\rangle + (-1+2i)|-x\rangle \right].
\]

### Step 4: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates
The coefficients of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are \( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \) and \( \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \), respectively. The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

### Step 5: Average value of \( \hat{A} \)
The expectation value of \( \hat{A} \) is:
\[
\langle \hat{A} \rangle = \langle \alpha | \hat{A} | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using the matrix representation of \( \hat{A} \) and the coefficients of \( |\alpha\rangle \), the calculation yields:
\[
\langle \hat{A} \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 6: Match with options
The probabilities \( P(+x) \approx 0.64 \) and \( P(-x) \approx 0.36 \) match the first two values in **Option A**, and the average value \( \langle \hat{A} \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7} \) also matches. The other options do not align with the calculated results.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here. Let's try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about an electron's state and measuring probabilities for a certain operator. Also, finding the average value of that operator. Alright, let's break it down.

First, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. So, I think I should normalize this state because the coefficients probably don't sum up to 1. Let me calculate the norm.

The norm squared is the sum of the squares of the absolute values of each coefficient. So for (1+i), the absolute value squared is (1^2 + 1^2) = 2. For (2-i), it's (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 4 + 1 = 5. So total norm squared is 2 +5 =7. So the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ].

Now, the operator in question has a matrix representation A where A_ij = ħ/2 if i≠j, else 0. Wait, so this is a 2x2 matrix. Let me write it out. The diagonal elements A_11 and A_22 are zero. The off-diagonal elements A_12 and A_21 are ħ/2 each. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0   ħ/2 ]
[ ħ/2 0  ]

Hmm, this matrix resembles the Pauli matrices. Wait, the Pauli X matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], but scaled by ħ/2 here. So, operator A is (ħ/2) times the Pauli X matrix.

Wait, I think the Pauli matrices are usually represented as σx, σy, σz. So A would be (ħ/2) σx. Because σx has off-diagonal elements 1 and 1. So yes, A is (ħ/2) σx.

Now, measuring the eigenstates of operator A. Oh wait, wait—when you measure an operator, the possible outcomes are its eigenvalues, and the states are the eigenstates. So the eigenvalues of A are the same as the eigenvalues of σx scaled by ħ/2.

Wait, the eigenvalues of σx are +1 and -1. So the eigenvalues of A would be (ħ/2)(+1) = ħ/2 and (ħ/2)(-1) = -ħ/2.

But wait, the question is about the probabilities of measuring in each eigenstate. So I need to find the expansion of |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, and then the probabilities would be the squares of the coefficients.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σx, its eigenstates are the same as σx's. The eigenstates of σx are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2)}.

Wait, let me confirm. For σx, the eigenstates are the superpositions where up and down are equally weighted with a +1 and -1 in the coefficients. So yes, (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) is one eigenstate, and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) is the other.

So to find the probabilities, I need to express |alpha> in terms of these eigenstates.

But wait, let's think differently. The operator A has matrix elements A_12 = A_21 = ħ/2, and A_11 = A_22 = 0. So it's a 2x2 matrix with 0 on the diagonal and ħ/2 elsewhere.

So, the eigenstates of A are the same as the eigenstates of σx, which are (|+x> and |−x>) in the spin-1/2 system.

So, to find the probability of measuring each eigenvalue, we can expand |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach would be to find the eigenvectors of A and then compute the inner product with |alpha>.

Wait, but maybe I can diagonalize A by finding its eigenvectors. Let me try that.

The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]. So, to find eigenvectors, we solve (A - λI) v = 0.

The characteristic equation is determinant of [[-λ, ħ/2],[ħ/2, -λ]] = 0. So determinant is λ^2 - (ħ/2)^2 = 0. So λ^2 = (ħ^2)/4, so λ = ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues are ħ/2 and -ħ/2, as I thought earlier.

Now, for λ = ħ/2:

(A - (ħ/2) I) = [[-ħ/2, ħ/2],[ħ/2, -ħ/2]]

The equations are:

-ħ/2 v1 + ħ/2 v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 =0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvector is proportional to (1,1). So |+x> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). Wait, but our state |alpha> is a combination of |up> and |down>, so perhaps we can express |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x> (which are (|up> +|down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> -|down>)/sqrt(2), respectively).

So, let me write |alpha> in terms of |+x> and |−x>.

First, let me write |up> and |down> in terms of |+x> and |−x>. 

We have:

|up> = (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2)
|down> = (|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2)

So, substituting into |alpha>, which is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, we get:

(1+i) [ (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2) ] + (2 - i) [ (|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2) ]

Let me factor out 1/sqrt(2):

[ (1+i)(|+x> + |−x>) ) + (2 - i)(|+x> - |−x>) ] / sqrt(2)

Expanding this:

[ (1+i + 2 -i)|+x> + (1+i - (2 -i))|−x> ] / sqrt(2)

Wait, let's compute the coefficients:

For |+x>:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = (1+2) + (i -i) = 3. So coefficient is 3.

For |−x>:

(1+i) - (2 -i) = (1-2) + (i +i) = (-1) + 2i.

So putting it all together:

[3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i)|−x> ] / sqrt(2)

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me re-calculate.

Let me distribute the terms:

(1+i)|up> = (1+i) ( |+x> + |−x> ) / sqrt(2)
(2 -i)|down> = (2 -i) ( |+x> - |−x> ) / sqrt(2)

So when adding them:

[ (1+i)(|+x> + |−x>) + (2 -i)(|+x> - |−x>) ] / sqrt(2)

Factor out |+x> and |−x>:

|+x> [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(2) + |−x> [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(2)

Compute the coefficients:

(1+i) + (2 -i) = 1 + 2 + i -i = 3.

(1+i) - (2 -i) = 1 -2 +i +i = (-1) + 2i.

So, |alpha> becomes [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i)|−x> ] / sqrt(2)

Wait, but this should all be multiplied by 1/sqrt(7) because |alpha> is normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

Wait, no. Wait, the initial |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>, and when we express in terms of |+x> and |−x>, I have to consider the normalization. Let me re-express all steps.

Wait, the original |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

So, substituting |up> and |down> as before:

(1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) * (|+x> + |−x>)/sqrt(2) + (2 -i) * (|+x> - |−x>)/sqrt(2) ) ]

Factor 1/(sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) ):

[ (1+i) (|+x> + |−x>) + (2 -i) (|+x> - |−x>) ) ] / sqrt(14)

Wait, because sqrt(7)*sqrt(2) = sqrt(14).

Now, expanding the numerator:

(1+i)|+x> + (1+i)|−x> + (2 -i)|+x> - (2 -i)|−x>

Combine like terms:

[ (1+i + 2 -i) |+x> ] + [ (1+i - (2 -i)) |−x> ]

Simplify:

(3) |+x> + [ (1 +i -2 +i) ] |−x> 

Which is 3 |+x> + ( -1 + 2i ) |−x>

So numerator is 3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i) |−x>, and denominator is sqrt(14).

So |alpha> = [3 |+x> + (-1 + 2i)|−x> ] / sqrt(14)

Hmm, now the coefficients for |+x> and |−x> are 3/sqrt(14) and (-1+2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probability of measuring the eigenvalue +ħ/2 (which corresponds to |+x>) is the square of the absolute value of the coefficient of |+x>, right?

So, the coefficient is 3/sqrt(14). The absolute value squared is (3^2)/(14) )= 9/14 ≈ 0.6429.

Similarly, the coefficient for |−x> is (-1+2i)/sqrt(14). The absolute value squared is [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 = (1 +4)/14 =5/14 ≈ 0.3571.

Wait, wait, 5/14 is about 0.357, which is 0.357 when approximated. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.643 and 0.357. Looking at the options, let's check:

Option A: 0.64, 0.36. That seems close, but 9/14 is approximately 0.6429, which is about 0.64, and 5/14 ≈ 0.357, which is 0.357. So option A has these probabilities, but let me check the other options.

Wait, option D has 0.61 and 0.29, which doesn’t match.

Okay, so probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14, which are approximately 0.643 and 0.357.

Now, the average value of the operator A. The average value is <alpha| A |alpha>.

Alternatively, since A is (ħ/2) σx, the expectation value is (ħ/2) <sigma_x>.

The expectation value of sigma_x in state |alpha> is ( <alpha| sigma_x |alpha> ), which can be found using the expansion in |+x> and |−x> states.

Alternatively, perhaps a simpler way is to compute it directly.

Wait, |alpha> is (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

So, the expectation value <A> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down> ]^dagger A (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

Wait, since A is a matrix, let me compute it as <alpha| A |alpha>.

The matrix A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]].

So, |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

So, the vector representation is [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]^T.

So, <alpha| is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ].

So, compute <alpha| A |alpha>.

Which is [ (1-i)/sqrt(7), (2+i)/sqrt(7) ] multiplied by A multiplied by [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

So, let's compute each part.

First, A is [[0, ħ/2],[ħ/2, 0]]

So, compute A multiplied by the vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

A * vector = [0*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + (ħ/2)*(2 -i)/sqrt(7), (ħ/2)*(1+i)/sqrt(7) + 0*(2 -i)/sqrt(7) ]

So this becomes:

[ ( (ħ/2)*(2 -i) ) / sqrt(7), ( (ħ/2)*(1+i) ) / sqrt(7) ]

Simplify:

( (2 -i) ħ/2 ) / sqrt(7) = ( (2 ħ/2 ) - (i ħ)/2 ) ) / sqrt(7) → ( ħ - i ħ/2 ) / sqrt(7)

Similarly, (1+i) ħ/2 / sqrt(7) = ( ħ/2 + i ħ/2 ) / sqrt(7)

Now, multiply <alpha| with this result.

<alpha| is [ (1 -i)/sqrt(7), (2 +i)/sqrt(7) ]

So, the inner product is:

(1 - i)/sqrt(7) * [ (ħ - i ħ/2 ) / sqrt(7) ] + (2 + i)/sqrt(7) * [ (ħ/2 + i ħ/2 ) / sqrt(7) ]

Let me compute each term separately.

First term:
(1 - i)( ħ - i ħ/2 ) / 7
= ħ (1 - i) [1 - i/2 ] /7
Multiply out (1 - i)(1 - i/2):
= 1*(1) + 1*(-i/2) -i*(1) + i*(i/2)
= 1 - i/2 - i + (i^2)/2
= 1 - (3i/2) + (-1/2)
= (1 - 1/2) - (3i/2)
= (1/2) - (3i/2)

So first term: ħ (1/2 - 3i/2 ) /7

Second term:
(2 +i) ( ħ/2 + i ħ/2 ) /7
= ħ/2 (2 +i)(1 + i) /7
Compute (2 +i)(1 +i):
= 2*1 +2*i +i*1 +i*i
= 2 + 2i +i + (-1)
= (2 -1) + 3i
= 1 + 3i

So second term: (ħ/2)(1 +3i)/7 = ħ (1 +3i)/(14)

Now, adding both terms:

Term1 + Term2 = [ ħ (1/2 - 3i/2 ) /7 ] + [ ħ (1 +3i)/(14) ]

Let me factor ħ and 1/14:

= ħ/(14) [ ( (1/2 -3i/2)*2 ) + (1 +3i) ) ]

Because 1/7 is 2/14, so the first term is multiplied by 2.

So inside the brackets:

(1/2 *2)=1, (-3i/2 *2) =-3i → (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ) 

Adding these: 1 +1 =2, -3i +3i=0 → 2.

So overall: ħ/(14) * 2 = ħ/7.

So the expectation value <A> is ħ/7.

Wait, but wait. Hmm. Because A has eigenvalues ± ħ/2, and the expectation value is the weighted average of these, weighted by the probabilities.

Given that the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14 for +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively, the average value would be (9/14)(ħ/2) + (5/14)(-ħ/2) ) = [ (9 -5) * ħ/2 ] /14 → (4 ħ/2) /14 → (2 ħ) /14 → ħ/7. Which matches what I got earlier. So that makes sense.

So the average value is ħ/7.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Probabilities 0.64 and 0.36, average hbar/7. So 0.64 is 9/14 ≈0.6428, 5/14≈0.357. So option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, which are close. Hmm, but 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which is 0.357, which is 0.36 when rounded to two decimal places. So that's option A.

But wait, let me check the calculation of the probabilities again. The coefficient for |+x> is 3/sqrt(14), so |3/sqrt(14)|^2 is 9/14 ≈ 0.6428. And the other is 5/14≈0.357. So the probabilities are 9/14 and 5/14.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.64 and 0.36 → which would correspond to 9/14 and 5/14 (rounded to two decimals). But wait, 9/14 is exactly 0.642857..., which rounds to 0.64 as per the option.

Option A's average is hbar/7, which matches with our calculation.

So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but wait—let me check the other options. Option D has an average of 2 hbar/sqrt(7), which is larger. Option B has average 3 hbar/sqrt(7), which is way bigger. Option C's average is hbar/sqrt(7), which is about 2.64 times larger than our result. So option A seems correct.


The problem involves an electron in the state \( |\alpha\rangle \), which is proportional to \( (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \), where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-projection of the spin operator. The task is to calculate the probabilities of measuring the particle in the eigenstates of the operator \( \hat{A} \), whose matrix representation is given by \( A_{ij} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \) if \( i \neq j \), and \( 0 \) otherwise. Additionally, the average value of \( \hat{A} \) must be determined.

### Step 1: Normalize the state \( |\alpha\rangle \)
The norm of \( |\alpha\rangle \) is calculated as:
\[
\text{Norm}^2 = |1+i|^2 + |2-i|^2 = (1^2 + 1^2) + (2^2 + (-1)^2) = 2 + 5 = 7.
\]
Thus, the normalized state is:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right].
\]

### Step 2: Eigenstates of \( \hat{A} \)
The operator \( \hat{A} \) has a matrix representation:
\[
\hat{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
This is proportional to the Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix, scaled by \( \frac{\hbar}{2} \). The eigenstates of \( \hat{A} \) are the eigenstates of \( \sigma_x \), which are:
\[
|+x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-x\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 3: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in terms of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \)
Substituting \( |\uparrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+x\rangle + |-x\rangle \right) \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+x\rangle - |-x\rangle \right) \) into \( |\alpha\rangle \), we get:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+x\rangle + |-x\rangle \right) + (2-i) \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+x\rangle - |-x\rangle \right) \right].
\]
Simplifying:
\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{14}} \left[ 3|+x\rangle + (-1+2i)|-x\rangle \right].
\]

### Step 4: Probabilities of measuring eigenstates
The coefficients of \( |+x\rangle \) and \( |-x\rangle \) are \( \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \) and \( \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \), respectively. The probabilities are the squared magnitudes of these coefficients:
\[
P(+x) = \left| \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.643, \quad P(-x) = \left| \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}} \right|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.357.
\]

### Step 5: Average value of \( \hat{A} \)
The expectation value of \( \hat{A} \) is:
\[
\langle \hat{A} \rangle = \langle \alpha | \hat{A} | \alpha \rangle.
\]
Using the matrix representation of \( \hat{A} \) and the coefficients of \( |\alpha\rangle \), the calculation yields:
\[
\langle \hat{A} \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Step 6: Match with options
The probabilities \( P(+x) \approx 0.64 \) and \( P(-x) \approx 0.36 \) match the first two values in **Option A**, and the average value \( \langle \hat{A} \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{7} \) also matches. The other options do not align with the calculated results.

**Answer: A**
