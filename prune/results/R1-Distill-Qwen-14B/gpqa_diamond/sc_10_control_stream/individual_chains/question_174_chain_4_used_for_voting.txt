Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through step by step.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The fragments' masses are in a 2:1 ratio. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are A to D, in MeV.

Wait, so the nucleus is initially at rest. So the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. That means they'll move in opposite directions with velocities such that their momenta cancel each other out.

But wait, the masses are different. The more massive fragment is twice the mass of the other. Let me think about that. Let me denote the mass of the lighter fragment as m, so the heavier one is 2m. The sum of their masses is 3m. According to the problem, 3m = 0.99 M. So M is the initial mass of the nucleus. So M = 3m / 0.99. But maybe I don't need that right away.

Wait, the rest-mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV. So Mc² = 300 GeV. So M = 300 GeV / c². But perhaps units will cancel out later.

But the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. And m1 = 2 m2. So substituting, 3 m2 = 0.99 M. So m2 = 0.33 M. Wait, no, because 3m2 = 0.99 M, so m2 = (0.99 M) / 3. So m2 = 0.33 M. Then m1 is 0.66 M.

Wait, but that would mean the total rest mass after is 0.99 M, which is less than the initial M. So the mass deficit, which is the mass converted into kinetic energy, would be delta m = M - (m1 + m2) = M - 0.99 M = 0.01 M. So the mass converted is 1% of M, which is 3 GeV (since 300 GeV is 1% of 30,000 GeV?), wait no, 1% of 300 GeV is 3 GeV. So that mass deficit times c squared is the energy available.

But wait, that's the total energy released, which goes into the kinetic energy of the two fragments and any other forms like radiation or binding energy, but the problem says nothing else happens, so I think it's all into kinetic energy.

So the total kinetic energy of both fragments is delta E = (delta m) c² = 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV. Because 300 GeV is Mc², and delta m is 0.01 M, so 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV.

So the total KE is 3 GeV. Now, the two fragments have masses m1=0.66 M and m2=0.33 M. Wait, no, earlier calculation: m1 is twice m2, and sum is 0.99 M. So m1= 0.66 M, m2=0.33 M. Wait, 0.66+0.33 is 0.99. Yes.

Now, because the system was at rest, the momentum of each must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So p1 = -p2. So the magnitudes are equal. So for each fragment, p = gamma m v, but maybe it's easier to work with the fact that the momentum for each is the same in magnitude.

In the center of mass frame, which is the same as the initial rest frame, the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

So, let's model the problem using conservation of energy and momentum.

Total initial energy is Mc² = 300 GeV.

After fission, the total energy is (gamma1 m1 c²) + (gamma2 m2 c²) ) = 300 GeV, since energy is conserved.

But the kinetic energy is (gamma1 -1) m1 c² + (gamma2 -1) m2 c² = 3 GeV. Because the rest mass energy is 0.99 M c², which is 297 GeV, so 300-297=3 GeV is the kinetic energy.

But the problem asks for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which is T1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c².

Wait, but let's think about the momentum. Since p1 = p2 (opposite directions, same magnitude), and p = gamma m v, but since the velocities are opposite, their momentum magnitudes are same.

Alternatively, since gamma m v = p, and since the momentum vectors are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, but the masses are different, their velocities will adjust accordingly. But maybe using energy and momentum equations is better.

So, let's denote:

m1 = 2m, m2 = m. So m1 + m2 = 3m = 0.99 M. So m = 0.33 M.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to define variables in terms of M. Let me think. Let me set m1 = (2/3)(0.99 M) because m1 is 2/3 of the total mass after. Wait, m1 is 2 m2 and m1 + m2 =0.99 M. So m1= 2*m2. So m2 = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. m1 = 0.66 M.

So m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

Now, the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

So, the kinetic energies are T1 and T2. So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Each fragment's kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c².

But also, their momenta must be equal in magnitude. So p1 = gamma1 m1 v1, p2 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Since p1 = -p2, the magnitudes are equal: gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that in the center of mass frame, the velocities are related to the energies.

Wait, another approach: the two fragments have velocities v1 and v2 in opposite directions. The momentum of each is gamma m v. So, since the total momentum is zero, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider the energies and momenta.

The total energy for each fragment is E1 = gamma1 m1 c², E2 = gamma2 m2 c².

The total energy is E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

The total momentum is p1 - p2 = 0, so p1 = p2.

Wait, but p1 = gamma1 m1 v1, p2 = gamma2 m2 v2. So gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Hmm, this might get messy. Maybe using the relativistic energy-momentum relation would help.

For each fragment, E^2 = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So for fragment 1: (E1)^2 = (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2.

Similarly, fragment 2: (E2)^2 = (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2.

Because p1 = p2 = p (same magnitude) and opposite directions.

So E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2 )

E2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2 )

The total energy E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

Also, the kinetic energy is (E1 - m1 c²) + (E2 - m2 c²) ) = 3 GeV.

So, E1 + E2 = 300 GeV,

(E1 - m1 c²) + (E2 - m2 c²) ) = 3 GeV.

Which implies:

E1 + E2 = 300,

(E1 + E2) - (m1 + m2) c^2 = 3.

But (m1 + m2) c^2 is 0.99 M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV, which matches the earlier calculation. So that's consistent.

So, we have the system:

E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2 )

E2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2 )

E1 + E2 = 300.

But this seems complicated to solve.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this using the fact that the two particles have equal and opposite momenta, so we can write their energies in terms of p, and then add them to get 300 GeV.

But this might not lead directly to a solution. Maybe I can make an approximation for non-relativistic speeds, then compare the relativistic and non-relativistic cases.

Wait, the problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the classical (non-relativistic) T1.

So perhaps I can calculate T1 in both cases and find the difference.

In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v².

In the relativistic case, it's (gamma -1) m c².

So, first, let's compute the non-relativistic case.

In non-relativistic fission, the two fragments would have velocities determined by conservation of momentum and energy.

Since the system is initially at rest, the momenta must be equal and opposite.

So, m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Because momentum is conserved.

Since m1 = 2 m2, let me write m1 = 2m, m2 = m.

So, 2m v1 = m v2 → v2 = 2 v1.

But their kinetic energies would add up to the total kinetic energy.

Wait, but the non-relativistic approach would model the kinetic energy as (1/2) m1 v1² + (1/2) m2 v2² = 3 GeV.

But wait, in reality, the actual energy is 3 GeV, but this is the sum of the two kinetic energies. So in non-relativistic case, KE_total = (1/2)(2m) v1² + (1/2)(m)(2v1)².

Let's compute that.

(1/2)(2m) v1² = m v1²,

(1/2)(m)(4 v1²) = 2 m v1².

So total KE = m v1² + 2 m v1² = 3 m v1².

Set equal to 3 GeV: 3 m v1² = 3 GeV → m v1² = 1 GeV.

But m is m2, which is 0.33 M.

Wait, but M is the initial mass, which is 300 GeV / c². So m2 is 0.33 * (300 GeV / c²) = 99 GeV / c².

Wait, but in non-relativistic, c is a large number, so m c² is 99 GeV.

So m v² = 1 GeV.

But m v² = (99 GeV / c²) * v².

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused with units. Let me think in terms of energy.

Wait, (1/2) m v² = KE.

So in non-relativistic, the kinetic energy of fragment 1 is (1/2)(2m) v1² = m v1².

Similarly, fragment 2's KE is (1/2) m v2².

But since v2 = 2 v1, fragment 2's KE is (1/2) m (4 v1²) = 2 m v1².

So total KE is 3 m v1² = 3 GeV.

So m v1² = 1 GeV.

Now, the non-relativistic KE of the more massive fragment is T1_nonrel = (1/2)(2m) v1² = m v1² = 1 GeV.

Wait, so T1_nonrel is 1 GeV.

But wait, the options are in MeV. So 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. But the options are 2,5,10,20 MeV. Hmm, that suggests I'm making a mistake here.

Wait a second, maybe the non-relativistic approach is too crude because the velocities are significant fractions of c, so relativistic effects are important. Because 3 GeV is a lot, but the initial rest mass is 300 GeV, so the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which is 1% of the rest mass energy. So perhaps the velocities are not extremely relativistic, but let's see.

Wait, but the correct approach requires solving the relativistic equations to find T1 and then subtract the non-relativistic T1.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that in the relativistic case, the more massive fragment would have less kinetic energy than in the classical case, but I'm not sure. Wait, actually, in the classical case, the kinetic energy is higher because the more massive fragment is moving slower.

Wait, no, in the non-relativistic case, the more massive fragment has lower velocity, but higher mass. Let me think.

In non-relativistic, the more massive fragment (m1=2m) has velocity v1, and the lighter fragment (m2=m) has velocity v2=2v1.

So, KE1_nonrel = (1/2)(2m)(v1)^2 = m v1^2.

KE2_nonrel = (1/2)(m)(2v1)^2 = (1/2)m *4v1^2 = 2 m v1^2.

So, KE1 is 1 GeV, KE2 is 2 GeV. So the more massive fragment has 1 GeV KE, the lighter has 2 GeV.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the more massive fragment is moving slower. So it would have less kinetic energy than the lighter fragment, which is correct, as observed.

Wait, but then the sum is 3 GeV. So that's correct.

But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy distribution might be different.

So, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energies would be higher than their non-relativistic counterparts because relativistic kinetic energy increases more with velocity.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the KE of the more massive fragment is 1 GeV. But when considering relativistic effects, maybe T1 is higher or lower than that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute T1 in the relativistic case and then compare.

But solving the relativistic equations might be tricky.

Another approach is to model this using the invariant mass.

Wait, but perhaps I can use the fact that the two fragments are moving with equal and opposite momenta. So the total energy is the sum of their energies, and the total momentum is zero.

Let me denote p as the magnitude of the momentum of each fragment.

So, for fragment 1: E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c^2)^2 ) / c^2 units? Wait, I think I should use consistent units.

Wait, perhaps better to work in units where c=1. So then:

E1 = sqrt( p^2 + m1^2 )

Similarly, E2 = sqrt( p^2 + m2^2 )

And E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

So, since m1 = 0.66 M, m2=0.33 M.

But M = 300 GeV (since Mc² = 300 GeV, assuming c=1).

Wait, wait, wait, I'm getting confused with units. Let me clarify:

The rest mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV. So Mc² = 300 GeV, which implies M = 300 GeV / c².

But for calculation, perhaps it's easier to set c=1, so the rest mass energy is Mc² = M = 300 GeV.

So, in that case, m1 c² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.

Similarly, m2 c² = 99 GeV.

So m1 = 198 GeV / c², m2 =99 GeV / c².

Wait no, in units where c=1, m1 = 198 GeV, m2=99 GeV.

Wait, but that may not be correct. Because mass is in GeV/c², but when c=1, it's just GeV.

So, in those units, m1 = 198 GeV, m2 =99 GeV.

So, E1 = sqrt( p^2 + (198)^2 )

E2 = sqrt( p^2 + (99)^2 )

And E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

So we have:

sqrt( p^2 + 198^2 ) + sqrt( p^2 + 99^2 ) = 300.

We can write sqrt(p^2 + 198^2) = 300 - sqrt( p^2 + 99^2 )

And square both sides:

p^2 + 198^2 = [300 - sqrt(p^2 +99^2 )]^2.

Expanding the right side:

300^2 - 2*300*sqrt(p^2 +99^2) + (p^2 +99^2 )

So:

p^2 +198^2 = 90000 - 600 sqrt(p^2 +99^2) + p^2 + 99^2.

Cancel p^2 from both sides:

198^2 = 90000 -600 sqrt(p^2 +99^2) + 99^2.

Compute 198^2: 198 *198 = (200-2)^2 = 40000 - 800 +4 = 39204.

99^2 = 9801.

So,

39204 =90000 -600 sqrt(p^2 +99^2) +9801.

Sum 90000 +9801 =99801.

So,

39204 =99801 -600 sqrt(...)

Rearranging:

600 sqrt(p^2 +99^2) = 99801 -39204 =60597.

So,

sqrt(p^2 +99^2) =60597 /600 ≈ 100.995 GeV.

Wait, let me compute 60597 /600.

600 * 100 =60000. 60597-60000=597. 597/600=0.995. So 100.995 GeV.

So,

p^2 +99^2 = (100.995)^2.

Compute 100.995^2:

= (100 +0.995)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*0.995 +0.995^2.

= 10000 + 199 + 0.990025.

≈10199.990025.

So,

p^2 =10199.990025 - 99^2.

99^2 is 9801.

So p^2 =10199.99 -9801 = 398.99 ≈399.

So p≈ sqrt(399) ≈19.975 GeV.

Now, the more massive fragment (fragment 1) has energy E1 = sqrt( p^2 +198^2 ) = sqrt(399 + 39204) = sqrt(39603).

What's sqrt(39603)? 199. So E1=199 GeV.

Because 199^2 = (200-1)^2=40000-400 +1=39601. Close enough. So E1=199 GeV.

So the rest mass energy of fragment 1 is 198 GeV. So the kinetic energy T1 = E1 -198 GeV = 1 GeV.

Wait, that's the same as the non-relativistic case?

But that can't be right, because in the non-relativistic case, the KE comes out as 1 GeV, but in reality, in the relativistic case, the KE would be higher. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, E1 is 199 GeV, which is less than 200 GeV, so the KE is 1 GeV. That's the same as the non-relativistic case.

But that's surprising. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, during the calculation, when I set sqrt(p^2 +198^2) = 199 GeV, that would give p^2 + 198^2 = 199^2 → p^2 =199^2 -198^2.

Which is (199-198)(199+198) )=1*(397) =397.

So p^2=397 GeV^2. So p= sqrt(397)≈19.925 GeV.

But earlier I calculated p^2 as 399, which is close, but perhaps that's due to approximation.

Wait, when I did the calculation, I had:

sqrt(p^2 +198^2) =300 - sqrt(...). So maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Wait, but according to the relativistic calculation, E1=199 GeV, which is only 1 GeV above rest mass energy. So T1=1 GeV.

But earlier, the non-relativistic case also gave T1=1 GeV. So the difference would be zero. But that's not possible because the options don't have zero as an option.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in the relativistic calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach to compute E1 and E2 is incorrect.

Wait another way: the total energy is 300 GeV.

E1 + E2 =300 GeV.

E1 = sqrt( p^2 + m1² )

E2 = sqrt( p^2 + m2² )

So,

sqrt( p^2 + (0.66 M)^2 ) + sqrt( p^2 + (0.33 M)^2 ) = M.

Wait, since M=300 GeV, 0.66 M=198 GeV, 0.33 M=99 GeV.

So,

sqrt( p^2 +198^2 ) + sqrt( p^2 +99^2 ) =300.

Let me call this equation (1).

Alternatively, perhaps we can let x = p^2.

Then equation (1) becomes sqrt(x + 198^2) + sqrt(x +99^2) =300.

Let me denote a=198, b=99.

So sqrt(x +a^2) + sqrt(x +b^2) =300.

Let me call the first term A and the second term B.

A + B =300.

I can square both sides:

A^2 + 2AB + B^2 =90000.

But A^2 = x +a^2, B^2 =x +b^2.

So:

(x +a^2) + 2AB + (x +b^2) =90000.

2x + (a^2 +b^2) + 2AB =90000.

But a=198, b=99, so a²=39204, b²=9801.

a² + b²=49005.

So,

2x +49005 + 2AB =90000 → 2x + 2AB =40995.

Divide both sides by 2:

x + AB =20497.5.

But AB = sqrt( (x +a²)(x +b²) ).

Hmm, this might not be the easiest way to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps we can approximate that one fragment is moving much faster than the other. But given the mass ratio, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to find the kinetic energy.

Wait, another approach: using the fact that in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero, each fragment's momentum is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So, p1 = gamma1 m1 v1, p2=gamma2 m2 v2.

And since p1 = -p2, their magnitudes are equal: gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But because the fragments are moving in opposite directions, their velocities are in opposite directions, so v2= -v1 * (gamma1 m1)/(gamma2 m2) )

But this might be getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic work-energy theorem. The work done on each fragment is equal to their kinetic energy.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can find the velocities using the fact that the center of momentum frame is the same as the initial rest frame.

Another approach: since the nucleus is at rest, the total energy is Mc²=300 GeV.

The two fragments have energies E1 and E2, with E1 + E2=300 GeV.

The total momentum is zero, so p1 = -p2.

So, p1 = sqrt( (E1² - m1² c^4) ) / c.

Similarly, p2 = sqrt( (E2² - m2² c^4) ) / c.

But p1 = -p2 → their magnitudes are equal, so:

sqrt( (E1² - m1² c^4) ) = sqrt( (E2² - m2² c^4) )

So,

(E1² - m1² c^4) = (E2² - m2² c^4 )

→ E1² - E2² = (m1² - m2²) c^4.

But E1 + E2 =300 GeV → (E1 + E2)(E1 - E2) = (m1^2 - m2^2) c^4.

So,

(300)(E1 - E2) = (m1^2 - m2^2) c^4.

We can compute m1^2 - m2^2.

m1 =0.66 M, m2=0.33 M.

So m1^2 - m2^2 = (0.66^2 -0.33^2) M^2 = (0.4356 -0.1089) M² =0.3267 M².

So,

300 (E1-E2) =0.3267 M² c^4.

But M c^2=300 GeV → M² c^4= (300)^2 (GeV)^2.

So,

300 (E1-E2) =0.3267 * 90000 (GeV)^2.

0.3267 *90000 = 29403 GeV².

So,

E1 - E2 = 29403 GeV² /300 GeV = 98.01 GeV.

So, E1 - E2 =98.01 GeV.

We also have E1 + E2 =300 GeV.

Now, adding and subtracting the two equations:

Adding:

2 E1 =398.01 GeV → E1= 199.005 GeV.

Subtracting:

2 E2 = 201.99 GeV → E2=100.995 GeV.

So E1=199.005 GeV, E2=100.995 GeV.

So the rest mass energies are m1 c² =198 GeV, m2 c²=99 GeV.

So the kinetic energies are:

T1= E1 - m1 c² =199.005 -198 =1.005 GeV.

T2= E2 -m2 c²=100.995 -99=1.995 GeV.

So, T1=1.005 GeV, T2=1.995 GeV.

So the more massive fragment has kinetic energy T1=1.005 GeV, which is approximately 1 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, as calculated earlier, T1_nonrel=1 GeV.

So the difference between the correct T1 and the non-relativistic T1 is (1.005 -1) GeV=0.005 GeV=5 MeV.

So the correct T1 is 1.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV higher than the non-relativistic approximation.

Wait, no: the problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1. So 1.005 GeV is the correct, and 1 GeV is the non-relativistic. So the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

So the answer is 5 MeV, option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the nuclear fission process using both relativistic and non-relativistic approaches to determine the difference in the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, \( T_1 \).

### Key Information:
1. **Initial Conditions**:  
   - The atomic nucleus has a rest-mass energy of \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \) and is initially at rest.  
   - After fission, it splits into two fragments with a mass ratio of \( 2:1 \).  
   - The total rest mass of the two fragments is \( 99\% \) of the initial mass, i.e., \( 0.99 \times 300 \, \text{GeV} = 297 \, \text{GeV} \).  
   - The remaining \( 1\% \) of the initial mass-energy, \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), is converted into the total kinetic energy of the two fragments.

2. **Masses of Fragments**:  
   - Let the lighter fragment have rest mass \( m_2 \). Then the heavier fragment has rest mass \( m_1 = 2m_2 \).  
   - Since \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \), we find \( m_2 = 0.33M \) and \( m_1 = 0.66M \).  
   - Substituting \( M = 300 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), we get \( m_1 = 198 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_2 = 99 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \).

3. **Relativistic Kinetic Energy**:  
   - The total energy of each fragment is \( E = \sqrt{p^2 + m^2c^4} \), where \( p \) is the momentum and \( m \) is the rest mass.  
   - Using conservation of energy and momentum, the total energy of the system is \( E_1 + E_2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) are the energies of the two fragments.  
   - Solving the relativistic equations, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is found to be \( T_1 = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} \).

4. **Non-Relativistic Kinetic Energy**:  
   - In the non-relativistic approximation, the kinetic energy is given by \( T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \).  
   - Using conservation of momentum and energy, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is calculated to be \( T_1^{\text{non-rel}} = 1.0 \, \text{GeV} \).

5. **Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic \( T_1 \)**:

### Conclusion:
The difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment and the non-relativistic approximation is **5 MeV**.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through step by step.

The problem says an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest, and its rest-mass energy is 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. The fragments' masses are in a 2:1 ratio. Also, the sum of their rest masses is 99% of M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using classical (non-relativistic) approximation. The options are A to D, in MeV.

Wait, so the nucleus is initially at rest. So the total momentum before fission is zero. After fission, the two fragments must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum. That means they'll move in opposite directions with velocities such that their momenta cancel each other out.

But wait, the masses are different. The more massive fragment is twice the mass of the other. Let me think about that. Let me denote the mass of the lighter fragment as m, so the heavier one is 2m. The sum of their masses is 3m. According to the problem, 3m = 0.99 M. So M is the initial mass of the nucleus. So M = 3m / 0.99. But maybe I don't need that right away.

Wait, the rest-mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV. So Mc² = 300 GeV. So M = 300 GeV / c². But perhaps units will cancel out later.

But the sum of the rest masses of the fragments is 99% of M. So m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. And m1 = 2 m2. So substituting, 3 m2 = 0.99 M. So m2 = 0.33 M. Wait, no, because 3m2 = 0.99 M, so m2 = (0.99 M) / 3. So m2 = 0.33 M. Then m1 is 0.66 M.

Wait, but that would mean the total rest mass after is 0.99 M, which is less than the initial M. So the mass deficit, which is the mass converted into kinetic energy, would be delta m = M - (m1 + m2) = M - 0.99 M = 0.01 M. So the mass converted is 1% of M, which is 3 GeV (since 300 GeV is 1% of 30,000 GeV?), wait no, 1% of 300 GeV is 3 GeV. So that mass deficit times c squared is the energy available.

But wait, that's the total energy released, which goes into the kinetic energy of the two fragments and any other forms like radiation or binding energy, but the problem says nothing else happens, so I think it's all into kinetic energy.

So the total kinetic energy of both fragments is delta E = (delta m) c² = 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV. Because 300 GeV is Mc², and delta m is 0.01 M, so 0.01 * 300 GeV = 3 GeV.

So the total KE is 3 GeV. Now, the two fragments have masses m1=0.66 M and m2=0.33 M. Wait, no, earlier calculation: m1 is twice m2, and sum is 0.99 M. So m1= 0.66 M, m2=0.33 M. Wait, 0.66+0.33 is 0.99. Yes.

Now, because the system was at rest, the momentum of each must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So p1 = -p2. So the magnitudes are equal. So for each fragment, p = gamma m v, but maybe it's easier to work with the fact that the momentum for each is the same in magnitude.

In the center of mass frame, which is the same as the initial rest frame, the two fragments move in opposite directions with equal and opposite momenta.

So, let's model the problem using conservation of energy and momentum.

Total initial energy is Mc² = 300 GeV.

After fission, the total energy is (gamma1 m1 c²) + (gamma2 m2 c²) ) = 300 GeV, since energy is conserved.

But the kinetic energy is (gamma1 -1) m1 c² + (gamma2 -1) m2 c² = 3 GeV. Because the rest mass energy is 0.99 M c², which is 297 GeV, so 300-297=3 GeV is the kinetic energy.

But the problem asks for the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, which is T1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c².

Wait, but let's think about the momentum. Since p1 = p2 (opposite directions, same magnitude), and p = gamma m v, but since the velocities are opposite, their momentum magnitudes are same.

Alternatively, since gamma m v = p, and since the momentum vectors are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, but the masses are different, their velocities will adjust accordingly. But maybe using energy and momentum equations is better.

So, let's denote:

m1 = 2m, m2 = m. So m1 + m2 = 3m = 0.99 M. So m = 0.33 M.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to define variables in terms of M. Let me think. Let me set m1 = (2/3)(0.99 M) because m1 is 2/3 of the total mass after. Wait, m1 is 2 m2 and m1 + m2 =0.99 M. So m1= 2*m2. So m2 = (0.99 M)/3 = 0.33 M. m1 = 0.66 M.

So m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

Now, the total kinetic energy is 3 GeV.

So, the kinetic energies are T1 and T2. So T1 + T2 = 3 GeV.

Each fragment's kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) m c².

But also, their momenta must be equal in magnitude. So p1 = gamma1 m1 v1, p2 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Since p1 = -p2, the magnitudes are equal: gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that in the center of mass frame, the velocities are related to the energies.

Wait, another approach: the two fragments have velocities v1 and v2 in opposite directions. The momentum of each is gamma m v. So, since the total momentum is zero, gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider the energies and momenta.

The total energy for each fragment is E1 = gamma1 m1 c², E2 = gamma2 m2 c².

The total energy is E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

The total momentum is p1 - p2 = 0, so p1 = p2.

Wait, but p1 = gamma1 m1 v1, p2 = gamma2 m2 v2. So gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

Hmm, this might get messy. Maybe using the relativistic energy-momentum relation would help.

For each fragment, E^2 = (pc c)^2 + (m c²)^2.

So for fragment 1: (E1)^2 = (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2.

Similarly, fragment 2: (E2)^2 = (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2.

Because p1 = p2 = p (same magnitude) and opposite directions.

So E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2 )

E2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2 )

The total energy E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

Also, the kinetic energy is (E1 - m1 c²) + (E2 - m2 c²) ) = 3 GeV.

So, E1 + E2 = 300 GeV,

(E1 - m1 c²) + (E2 - m2 c²) ) = 3 GeV.

Which implies:

E1 + E2 = 300,

(E1 + E2) - (m1 + m2) c^2 = 3.

But (m1 + m2) c^2 is 0.99 M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So 300 GeV - 297 GeV = 3 GeV, which matches the earlier calculation. So that's consistent.

So, we have the system:

E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c²)^2 )

E2 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m2 c²)^2 )

E1 + E2 = 300.

But this seems complicated to solve.

Alternatively, perhaps we can model this using the fact that the two particles have equal and opposite momenta, so we can write their energies in terms of p, and then add them to get 300 GeV.

But this might not lead directly to a solution. Maybe I can make an approximation for non-relativistic speeds, then compare the relativistic and non-relativistic cases.

Wait, the problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 (relativistic) and the classical (non-relativistic) T1.

So perhaps I can calculate T1 in both cases and find the difference.

In the non-relativistic case, the kinetic energy is (1/2) m v².

In the relativistic case, it's (gamma -1) m c².

So, first, let's compute the non-relativistic case.

In non-relativistic fission, the two fragments would have velocities determined by conservation of momentum and energy.

Since the system is initially at rest, the momenta must be equal and opposite.

So, m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Because momentum is conserved.

Since m1 = 2 m2, let me write m1 = 2m, m2 = m.

So, 2m v1 = m v2 → v2 = 2 v1.

But their kinetic energies would add up to the total kinetic energy.

Wait, but the non-relativistic approach would model the kinetic energy as (1/2) m1 v1² + (1/2) m2 v2² = 3 GeV.

But wait, in reality, the actual energy is 3 GeV, but this is the sum of the two kinetic energies. So in non-relativistic case, KE_total = (1/2)(2m) v1² + (1/2)(m)(2v1)².

Let's compute that.

(1/2)(2m) v1² = m v1²,

(1/2)(m)(4 v1²) = 2 m v1².

So total KE = m v1² + 2 m v1² = 3 m v1².

Set equal to 3 GeV: 3 m v1² = 3 GeV → m v1² = 1 GeV.

But m is m2, which is 0.33 M.

Wait, but M is the initial mass, which is 300 GeV / c². So m2 is 0.33 * (300 GeV / c²) = 99 GeV / c².

Wait, but in non-relativistic, c is a large number, so m c² is 99 GeV.

So m v² = 1 GeV.

But m v² = (99 GeV / c²) * v².

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused with units. Let me think in terms of energy.

Wait, (1/2) m v² = KE.

So in non-relativistic, the kinetic energy of fragment 1 is (1/2)(2m) v1² = m v1².

Similarly, fragment 2's KE is (1/2) m v2².

But since v2 = 2 v1, fragment 2's KE is (1/2) m (4 v1²) = 2 m v1².

So total KE is 3 m v1² = 3 GeV.

So m v1² = 1 GeV.

Now, the non-relativistic KE of the more massive fragment is T1_nonrel = (1/2)(2m) v1² = m v1² = 1 GeV.

Wait, so T1_nonrel is 1 GeV.

But wait, the options are in MeV. So 1 GeV is 1000 MeV. But the options are 2,5,10,20 MeV. Hmm, that suggests I'm making a mistake here.

Wait a second, maybe the non-relativistic approach is too crude because the velocities are significant fractions of c, so relativistic effects are important. Because 3 GeV is a lot, but the initial rest mass is 300 GeV, so the kinetic energy is 3 GeV, which is 1% of the rest mass energy. So perhaps the velocities are not extremely relativistic, but let's see.

Wait, but the correct approach requires solving the relativistic equations to find T1 and then subtract the non-relativistic T1.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that in the relativistic case, the more massive fragment would have less kinetic energy than in the classical case, but I'm not sure. Wait, actually, in the classical case, the kinetic energy is higher because the more massive fragment is moving slower.

Wait, no, in the non-relativistic case, the more massive fragment has lower velocity, but higher mass. Let me think.

In non-relativistic, the more massive fragment (m1=2m) has velocity v1, and the lighter fragment (m2=m) has velocity v2=2v1.

So, KE1_nonrel = (1/2)(2m)(v1)^2 = m v1^2.

KE2_nonrel = (1/2)(m)(2v1)^2 = (1/2)m *4v1^2 = 2 m v1^2.

So, KE1 is 1 GeV, KE2 is 2 GeV. So the more massive fragment has 1 GeV KE, the lighter has 2 GeV.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the more massive fragment is moving slower. So it would have less kinetic energy than the lighter fragment, which is correct, as observed.

Wait, but then the sum is 3 GeV. So that's correct.

But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy distribution might be different.

So, in the relativistic case, the kinetic energies would be higher than their non-relativistic counterparts because relativistic kinetic energy increases more with velocity.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, the KE of the more massive fragment is 1 GeV. But when considering relativistic effects, maybe T1 is higher or lower than that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute T1 in the relativistic case and then compare.

But solving the relativistic equations might be tricky.

Another approach is to model this using the invariant mass.

Wait, but perhaps I can use the fact that the two fragments are moving with equal and opposite momenta. So the total energy is the sum of their energies, and the total momentum is zero.

Let me denote p as the magnitude of the momentum of each fragment.

So, for fragment 1: E1 = sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m1 c^2)^2 ) / c^2 units? Wait, I think I should use consistent units.

Wait, perhaps better to work in units where c=1. So then:

E1 = sqrt( p^2 + m1^2 )

Similarly, E2 = sqrt( p^2 + m2^2 )

And E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

So, since m1 = 0.66 M, m2=0.33 M.

But M = 300 GeV (since Mc² = 300 GeV, assuming c=1).

Wait, wait, wait, I'm getting confused with units. Let me clarify:

The rest mass energy of the nucleus is 300 GeV. So Mc² = 300 GeV, which implies M = 300 GeV / c².

But for calculation, perhaps it's easier to set c=1, so the rest mass energy is Mc² = M = 300 GeV.

So, in that case, m1 c² = 0.66 * 300 GeV = 198 GeV.

Similarly, m2 c² = 99 GeV.

So m1 = 198 GeV / c², m2 =99 GeV / c².

Wait no, in units where c=1, m1 = 198 GeV, m2=99 GeV.

Wait, but that may not be correct. Because mass is in GeV/c², but when c=1, it's just GeV.

So, in those units, m1 = 198 GeV, m2 =99 GeV.

So, E1 = sqrt( p^2 + (198)^2 )

E2 = sqrt( p^2 + (99)^2 )

And E1 + E2 = 300 GeV.

So we have:

sqrt( p^2 + 198^2 ) + sqrt( p^2 + 99^2 ) = 300.

We can write sqrt(p^2 + 198^2) = 300 - sqrt( p^2 + 99^2 )

And square both sides:

p^2 + 198^2 = [300 - sqrt(p^2 +99^2 )]^2.

Expanding the right side:

300^2 - 2*300*sqrt(p^2 +99^2) + (p^2 +99^2 )

So:

p^2 +198^2 = 90000 - 600 sqrt(p^2 +99^2) + p^2 + 99^2.

Cancel p^2 from both sides:

198^2 = 90000 -600 sqrt(p^2 +99^2) + 99^2.

Compute 198^2: 198 *198 = (200-2)^2 = 40000 - 800 +4 = 39204.

99^2 = 9801.

So,

39204 =90000 -600 sqrt(p^2 +99^2) +9801.

Sum 90000 +9801 =99801.

So,

39204 =99801 -600 sqrt(...)

Rearranging:

600 sqrt(p^2 +99^2) = 99801 -39204 =60597.

So,

sqrt(p^2 +99^2) =60597 /600 ≈ 100.995 GeV.

Wait, let me compute 60597 /600.

600 * 100 =60000. 60597-60000=597. 597/600=0.995. So 100.995 GeV.

So,

p^2 +99^2 = (100.995)^2.

Compute 100.995^2:

= (100 +0.995)^2 = 100^2 + 2*100*0.995 +0.995^2.

= 10000 + 199 + 0.990025.

≈10199.990025.

So,

p^2 =10199.990025 - 99^2.

99^2 is 9801.

So p^2 =10199.99 -9801 = 398.99 ≈399.

So p≈ sqrt(399) ≈19.975 GeV.

Now, the more massive fragment (fragment 1) has energy E1 = sqrt( p^2 +198^2 ) = sqrt(399 + 39204) = sqrt(39603).

What's sqrt(39603)? 199. So E1=199 GeV.

Because 199^2 = (200-1)^2=40000-400 +1=39601. Close enough. So E1=199 GeV.

So the rest mass energy of fragment 1 is 198 GeV. So the kinetic energy T1 = E1 -198 GeV = 1 GeV.

Wait, that's the same as the non-relativistic case?

But that can't be right, because in the non-relativistic case, the KE comes out as 1 GeV, but in reality, in the relativistic case, the KE would be higher. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, E1 is 199 GeV, which is less than 200 GeV, so the KE is 1 GeV. That's the same as the non-relativistic case.

But that's surprising. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, during the calculation, when I set sqrt(p^2 +198^2) = 199 GeV, that would give p^2 + 198^2 = 199^2 → p^2 =199^2 -198^2.

Which is (199-198)(199+198) )=1*(397) =397.

So p^2=397 GeV^2. So p= sqrt(397)≈19.925 GeV.

But earlier I calculated p^2 as 399, which is close, but perhaps that's due to approximation.

Wait, when I did the calculation, I had:

sqrt(p^2 +198^2) =300 - sqrt(...). So maybe there's a better way to approach this.

Wait, but according to the relativistic calculation, E1=199 GeV, which is only 1 GeV above rest mass energy. So T1=1 GeV.

But earlier, the non-relativistic case also gave T1=1 GeV. So the difference would be zero. But that's not possible because the options don't have zero as an option.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in the relativistic calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach to compute E1 and E2 is incorrect.

Wait another way: the total energy is 300 GeV.

E1 + E2 =300 GeV.

E1 = sqrt( p^2 + m1² )

E2 = sqrt( p^2 + m2² )

So,

sqrt( p^2 + (0.66 M)^2 ) + sqrt( p^2 + (0.33 M)^2 ) = M.

Wait, since M=300 GeV, 0.66 M=198 GeV, 0.33 M=99 GeV.

So,

sqrt( p^2 +198^2 ) + sqrt( p^2 +99^2 ) =300.

Let me call this equation (1).

Alternatively, perhaps we can let x = p^2.

Then equation (1) becomes sqrt(x + 198^2) + sqrt(x +99^2) =300.

Let me denote a=198, b=99.

So sqrt(x +a^2) + sqrt(x +b^2) =300.

Let me call the first term A and the second term B.

A + B =300.

I can square both sides:

A^2 + 2AB + B^2 =90000.

But A^2 = x +a^2, B^2 =x +b^2.

So:

(x +a^2) + 2AB + (x +b^2) =90000.

2x + (a^2 +b^2) + 2AB =90000.

But a=198, b=99, so a²=39204, b²=9801.

a² + b²=49005.

So,

2x +49005 + 2AB =90000 → 2x + 2AB =40995.

Divide both sides by 2:

x + AB =20497.5.

But AB = sqrt( (x +a²)(x +b²) ).

Hmm, this might not be the easiest way to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps we can approximate that one fragment is moving much faster than the other. But given the mass ratio, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way to find the kinetic energy.

Wait, another approach: using the fact that in the center of mass frame, the total momentum is zero, each fragment's momentum is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. So, p1 = gamma1 m1 v1, p2=gamma2 m2 v2.

And since p1 = -p2, their magnitudes are equal: gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But because the fragments are moving in opposite directions, their velocities are in opposite directions, so v2= -v1 * (gamma1 m1)/(gamma2 m2) )

But this might be getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relativistic work-energy theorem. The work done on each fragment is equal to their kinetic energy.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can find the velocities using the fact that the center of momentum frame is the same as the initial rest frame.

Another approach: since the nucleus is at rest, the total energy is Mc²=300 GeV.

The two fragments have energies E1 and E2, with E1 + E2=300 GeV.

The total momentum is zero, so p1 = -p2.

So, p1 = sqrt( (E1² - m1² c^4) ) / c.

Similarly, p2 = sqrt( (E2² - m2² c^4) ) / c.

But p1 = -p2 → their magnitudes are equal, so:

sqrt( (E1² - m1² c^4) ) = sqrt( (E2² - m2² c^4) )

So,

(E1² - m1² c^4) = (E2² - m2² c^4 )

→ E1² - E2² = (m1² - m2²) c^4.

But E1 + E2 =300 GeV → (E1 + E2)(E1 - E2) = (m1^2 - m2^2) c^4.

So,

(300)(E1 - E2) = (m1^2 - m2^2) c^4.

We can compute m1^2 - m2^2.

m1 =0.66 M, m2=0.33 M.

So m1^2 - m2^2 = (0.66^2 -0.33^2) M^2 = (0.4356 -0.1089) M² =0.3267 M².

So,

300 (E1-E2) =0.3267 M² c^4.

But M c^2=300 GeV → M² c^4= (300)^2 (GeV)^2.

So,

300 (E1-E2) =0.3267 * 90000 (GeV)^2.

0.3267 *90000 = 29403 GeV².

So,

E1 - E2 = 29403 GeV² /300 GeV = 98.01 GeV.

So, E1 - E2 =98.01 GeV.

We also have E1 + E2 =300 GeV.

Now, adding and subtracting the two equations:

Adding:

2 E1 =398.01 GeV → E1= 199.005 GeV.

Subtracting:

2 E2 = 201.99 GeV → E2=100.995 GeV.

So E1=199.005 GeV, E2=100.995 GeV.

So the rest mass energies are m1 c² =198 GeV, m2 c²=99 GeV.

So the kinetic energies are:

T1= E1 - m1 c² =199.005 -198 =1.005 GeV.

T2= E2 -m2 c²=100.995 -99=1.995 GeV.

So, T1=1.005 GeV, T2=1.995 GeV.

So the more massive fragment has kinetic energy T1=1.005 GeV, which is approximately 1 GeV.

In the non-relativistic case, as calculated earlier, T1_nonrel=1 GeV.

So the difference between the correct T1 and the non-relativistic T1 is (1.005 -1) GeV=0.005 GeV=5 MeV.

So the correct T1 is 1.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV higher than the non-relativistic approximation.

Wait, no: the problem asks for the difference between the correct T1 and the classical T1. So 1.005 GeV is the correct, and 1 GeV is the non-relativistic. So the difference is 0.005 GeV, which is 5 MeV.

So the answer is 5 MeV, option B.


To solve the problem, we analyze the nuclear fission process using both relativistic and non-relativistic approaches to determine the difference in the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, \( T_1 \).

### Key Information:
1. **Initial Conditions**:  
   - The atomic nucleus has a rest-mass energy of \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \) and is initially at rest.  
   - After fission, it splits into two fragments with a mass ratio of \( 2:1 \).  
   - The total rest mass of the two fragments is \( 99\% \) of the initial mass, i.e., \( 0.99 \times 300 \, \text{GeV} = 297 \, \text{GeV} \).  
   - The remaining \( 1\% \) of the initial mass-energy, \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), is converted into the total kinetic energy of the two fragments.

2. **Masses of Fragments**:  
   - Let the lighter fragment have rest mass \( m_2 \). Then the heavier fragment has rest mass \( m_1 = 2m_2 \).  
   - Since \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \), we find \( m_2 = 0.33M \) and \( m_1 = 0.66M \).  
   - Substituting \( M = 300 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \), we get \( m_1 = 198 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) and \( m_2 = 99 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \).

3. **Relativistic Kinetic Energy**:  
   - The total energy of each fragment is \( E = \sqrt{p^2 + m^2c^4} \), where \( p \) is the momentum and \( m \) is the rest mass.  
   - Using conservation of energy and momentum, the total energy of the system is \( E_1 + E_2 = 300 \, \text{GeV} \), where \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \) are the energies of the two fragments.  
   - Solving the relativistic equations, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is found to be \( T_1 = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} \).

4. **Non-Relativistic Kinetic Energy**:  
   - In the non-relativistic approximation, the kinetic energy is given by \( T = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \).  
   - Using conservation of momentum and energy, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is calculated to be \( T_1^{\text{non-rel}} = 1.0 \, \text{GeV} \).

5. **Difference Between Relativistic and Non-Relativistic \( T_1 \)**:  
   - The difference is \( \Delta T_1 = T_1 - T_1^{\text{non-rel}} = 1.005 \, \text{GeV} - 1.0 \, \text{GeV} = 0.005 \, \text{GeV} = 5 \, \text{MeV} \).

### Conclusion:
The difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment and the non-relativistic approximation is **5 MeV**.
