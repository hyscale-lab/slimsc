Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. 

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So the full operator would be the vector product of these components. Oh wait, no, more accurately, the operator in the direction n is P · n, which is the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction cosine. Since n is in the x-z plane, the direction vector can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so n is (n_x, 0, n_z) where n_x² + n_z² =1. So n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. So the direction cosines are (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So the operator P along n is P · n = P_x * sinθ + P_z * cosθ. Because the Py component is multiplied by zero since n has no y-component.

Let me write down each component:

Px is ħ/2 times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix.
Py is ħ/2 times [[0,-i],[i,0]], the Pauli Y matrix.
Pz is ħ/2 times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

So P · n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Let me compute that matrix. 

Each term is a 2x2 matrix. The X part is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]], and the Z part is [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]. Adding them together:

The (1,1) element is cosθ.
The (1,2) element is sinθ.
The (2,1) element is sinθ.
The (2,2) element is -cosθ.

So the matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

So substituting the matrix:

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] [a; b] = [a; b]

So the equation becomes:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me write these two equations:

1) cosθ a + sinθ b = a
2) sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let's rearrange equation 1:

cosθ a - a + sinθ b = 0 → a (cosθ -1) + b sinθ = 0 → equation (A)

Equation 2:

sinθ a - cosθ b - b = 0 → sinθ a - b (cosθ +1) = 0 → equation (B)

So from equation (A): a (cosθ -1) = - b sinθ → a = [ - b sinθ ] / (cosθ -1 )

Hmm, this denominator looks like it can be rewritten. cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(theta/2). Because cosθ = 1 - 2 sin²(theta/2), so cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(theta/2). So denominator is -2 sin²(theta/2).

So a = [ -b sinθ ] / ( -2 sin²(theta/2) ) = [ b sinθ ] / (2 sin²(theta/2) )

Wait, let me compute that. Let me factor the denominator:

cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(theta/2)

So a = [ -b sinθ ] / ( -2 sin²(theta/2) ) 

The negatives cancel, so:

a = [ b sinθ ] / [ 2 sin²(theta/2) )

Now, sinθ can be written as 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), because sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So substituting that:

a = [b * 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ]

The 2's cancel, so:

a = [b sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / sin²(theta/2 )

Which simplifies to:

a = [b cos(theta/2) ] / sin(theta/2 )

So a = b cot(theta/2 )

Wait, cot is cos over sin, right. So a = b * cot(theta/2 )

So now, from equation (A), a is expressed in terms of b. Let's plug this into equation (B) to see if it holds, or perhaps find a relation.

Equation (B): sinθ a = b (cosθ +1 )

Substitute a = b cot(theta/2 ) into equation (B):

sinθ * b cot(theta/2 ) = b ( cosθ +1 )

We can cancel b from both sides (assuming b ≠ 0, which it must be for a non-trivial solution).

So:

sinθ cot(theta/2 ) = cosθ +1

Let me compute sinθ cot(theta/2 ). Let's expand cot(theta/2 ) = cos(theta/2 ) / sin(theta/2 )

So:

sinθ * [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] 

Express sinθ as 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

So:

2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] 

The sin(theta/2) cancels:

2 cos(theta/2) * cos(theta/2 ) = 2 cos²(theta/2 )

So equation (B) becomes:

2 cos²(theta/2 ) = cosθ + 1

But cosθ +1 = 2 cos²(theta/2 ), which is a trigonometric identity. So yes, it holds. So that's consistent.

So now, from equation (A), a = b cot(theta/2 )

Let me write the eigenvector |v> as [a; b] = [ a; b ]

Since a = b cot(theta/2 ), I can express a in terms of b. Let's choose b = 1 for simplicity, then a = cot(theta/2 )

But wait, I need to normalize the eigenvector. So the eigenvector is [a, b], and the normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

But because the eigenvector can be multiplied by a phase factor (since it's a quantum state), we can choose the phase such that b is real and positive, for simplicity. So let's assume b is real and positive, and a is complex if necessary.

Wait, let me think about the matrix. The operator P·n is a Hermitian matrix, so its eigenvectors are real or can be chosen as real, right? Because Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors, which can be chosen as real.

Wait, our matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) times [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]. Wait, let me check if this matrix is Hermitian.

The given P components are Hermitian. Px is real and symmetric, so it's Hermitian. Pz is diagonal with real entries, so Hermitian. Py is anti-hermitian because swapping rows and columns gives negative, but multiplied by i, it's Hermitian. Wait, Py is (ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is indeed Hermitian because (Py)† = (ħ/2)[[0,i], [-i,0]] = -Py. Wait, no, let's compute:

The conjugate transpose of Py would be:

(ħ/2) * [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is the negative of Py, which is [[0, -i],[i,0]]. Because Py is (ħ/2) [[0, -i],[i, 0]], so Py† is (ħ/2) [[0, i], [-i, 0]] = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] multiplied by (ħ/2) * (-1). So Py is Hermitian only if (Py)† = Py. Wait, no, because Py† is -Py. So Py is anti-Hermitian, not Hermitian.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because Hermitian matrices satisfy H = H†. So let's compute H = Py:

H = (ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
H† is (ħ/2) [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is equal to (ħ/2) times the negative of H. So H† = -H. So Py is anti-Hermitian. So Py is i times a Hermitian matrix because (iH)† = (-i) H† = (-i)(-H) = i H, which is equal to iH. So Py is anti-Hermitian.

But when you have a vector operator, the dot product with n should be Hermitian, because observables are Hermitian. So P·n must be Hermitian.

Let me check if P·n is Hermitian. Since n is in x-z plane, and the components are P_x, P_z, which are Hermitian, and P_y is anti-Hermitian. So when you take P·n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Each term is Hermitian because P_x and P_z are Hermitian, and sinθ and cosθ are real. So the sum of Hermitian operators is Hermitian, so P·n is Hermitian. That's correct.

So the matrix for P·n is Hermitian, so its eigenvectors can be taken as real (if the eigenvalues are real, which they are, since it's Hermitian).

Wait, but the matrix I wrote for P·n is:

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So is this matrix Hermitian?

Yes, because the (1,2) element is sinθ, and (2,1) is sinθ. The diagonal elements are cosθ and -cosθ. So the matrix is real and symmetric, hence Hermitian.

So the eigenvectors can be taken as real (or with any phase, but perhaps we can take them as real for simplicity).

So the eigenvector [a, b] is real, and we can write a and b as real numbers.

So a = b cot(theta/2 )

Let me see. Let me pick b =1, so a = cot(theta/2 ). Then the eigenvector is [cot(theta/2 ), 1 ].

But I need to normalize it.

The normalization condition is a² + b² =1.

So substituting a = cot(theta/2 ), and b=1:

cot²(theta/2 ) + 1 = csc²(theta/2 ) [since 1 + cot² x = csc² x ]

So the normalization factor is 1 / sqrt( csc²(theta/2 )) ) = sin(theta/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector becomes:

a = cot(theta/2 ) * sin(theta/2 ) = [cos(theta/2 ) / sin(theta/2 ) ] * sin(theta/2 ) = cos(theta/2 )

b = 1 * sin(theta/2 ) = sin(theta/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

Wait, that's because:

The normalized vector is [a, b] = [ cot(theta/2 ), 1 ] * sin(theta/2 )

Because the original vector [a, b] is [cot(theta/2 ), 1], and the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(csc²(theta/2 )) ) = sin(theta/2 )

Wait, maybe I should do it more carefully.

Let me compute a and b after normalization.

The initial vector is [cot(theta/2 ), 1], which can be written as [ cos(theta/2 )/sin(theta/2 ), 1 ]

The norm is sqrt( [cos²(theta/2 ) / sin²(theta/2 ) ] + 1 )

= sqrt( [ cos²(theta/2 ) + sin²(theta/2 ) ] / sin²(theta/2 ) )

= sqrt( 1 / sin²(theta/2 ) )

= 1 / | sin(theta/2 ) | 

Assuming sin(theta/2 ) is positive, which it is for theta between 0 and pi (since theta is the angle in x-z plane, between 0 and pi for a unit vector).

So the normalization factor is sin(theta/2 ), because 1/(1/sin(theta/2 )) ) = sin(theta/2 )

So the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Wait, that gives the vector as [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ], which is a unit vector.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Looking back at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )), which matches.

But let me check the other options.

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ)
This looks like it's scaled by ħ, which doesn't make sense because eigenvectors are dimensionless (they are states, not operators). So probably not.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )
This seems more like spherical harmonics or something, but our solution is based on theta/2.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2 ), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )
Again, it's scaled by ħ, which is a problem. Also, the coefficients are sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which don't match our solution.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each represented as $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ is parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$
The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta
\]
Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \right) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
Substituting the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
This gives the system of equations:
\[
\cos\theta \, a + \sin\theta \, b = a, \quad \sin\theta \, a - \cos\theta \, b = b
\]

### Step 3: Solve for $a$ and $b$
From the first equation:
\[
a (\cos\theta - 1) + b \sin\theta = 0 \implies a = \frac{-b \sin\theta}{\cos\theta - 1}
\]
Using the trigonometric identity $\cos\theta - 1 = -2 \sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2 \sin(\theta/2) \cos(\theta/2)$, we simplify:
\[
a = b \cot(\theta/2)
\]

### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector
The eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
To normalize, we compute the normalization factor:
\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1} = \sqrt{\csc^2(\theta/2)} = \frac{1}{|\sin(\theta/2)|}
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$: Incorrect, as the eigenvector is not scaled by $\hbar$ and does not match the derived components.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$: Incorrect, as the components involve $\theta$ rather than $\theta/2$.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$: Correct, matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$: Incorrect, as the eigenvector is not scaled by $\hbar$ and the coefficients do not match.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2. The operator P has components Px, Py, and Pz, each given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2. 

Wait, so the operator P is a vector operator, right? So the full operator would be the vector product of these components. Oh wait, no, more accurately, the operator in the direction n is P · n, which is the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding direction cosine. Since n is in the x-z plane, the direction vector can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because it's in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero, so n is (n_x, 0, n_z) where n_x² + n_z² =1. So n_x = sinθ and n_z = cosθ. So the direction cosines are (sinθ, 0, cosθ).

So the operator P along n is P · n = P_x * sinθ + P_z * cosθ. Because the Py component is multiplied by zero since n has no y-component.

Let me write down each component:

Px is ħ/2 times [[0,1],[1,0]], which is the Pauli X matrix.
Py is ħ/2 times [[0,-i],[i,0]], the Pauli Y matrix.
Pz is ħ/2 times [[1,0],[0,-1]], the Pauli Z matrix.

So P · n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ].

Let me compute that matrix. 

Each term is a 2x2 matrix. The X part is [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]], and the Z part is [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]. Adding them together:

The (1,1) element is cosθ.
The (1,2) element is sinθ.
The (2,1) element is sinθ.
The (2,2) element is -cosθ.

So the matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]].

Now, we're looking for the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2.

The eigenvalue equation is (P·n) |v> = (+ħ/2) |v>.

So substituting the matrix:

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can divide both sides by ħ/2 to simplify:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]] [a; b] = [a; b]

So the equation becomes:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

Let me write these two equations:

1) cosθ a + sinθ b = a
2) sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Let's rearrange equation 1:

cosθ a - a + sinθ b = 0 → a (cosθ -1) + b sinθ = 0 → equation (A)

Equation 2:

sinθ a - cosθ b - b = 0 → sinθ a - b (cosθ +1) = 0 → equation (B)

So from equation (A): a (cosθ -1) = - b sinθ → a = [ - b sinθ ] / (cosθ -1 )

Hmm, this denominator looks like it can be rewritten. cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(theta/2). Because cosθ = 1 - 2 sin²(theta/2), so cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(theta/2). So denominator is -2 sin²(theta/2).

So a = [ -b sinθ ] / ( -2 sin²(theta/2) ) = [ b sinθ ] / (2 sin²(theta/2) )

Wait, let me compute that. Let me factor the denominator:

cosθ -1 = -2 sin²(theta/2)

So a = [ -b sinθ ] / ( -2 sin²(theta/2) ) 

The negatives cancel, so:

a = [ b sinθ ] / [ 2 sin²(theta/2) )

Now, sinθ can be written as 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2), because sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2).

So substituting that:

a = [b * 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / [ 2 sin²(theta/2) ) ]

The 2's cancel, so:

a = [b sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / sin²(theta/2 )

Which simplifies to:

a = [b cos(theta/2) ] / sin(theta/2 )

So a = b cot(theta/2 )

Wait, cot is cos over sin, right. So a = b * cot(theta/2 )

So now, from equation (A), a is expressed in terms of b. Let's plug this into equation (B) to see if it holds, or perhaps find a relation.

Equation (B): sinθ a = b (cosθ +1 )

Substitute a = b cot(theta/2 ) into equation (B):

sinθ * b cot(theta/2 ) = b ( cosθ +1 )

We can cancel b from both sides (assuming b ≠ 0, which it must be for a non-trivial solution).

So:

sinθ cot(theta/2 ) = cosθ +1

Let me compute sinθ cot(theta/2 ). Let's expand cot(theta/2 ) = cos(theta/2 ) / sin(theta/2 )

So:

sinθ * [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ] 

Express sinθ as 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2 )

So:

2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) * [ cos(theta/2) / sin(theta/2) ) ] 

The sin(theta/2) cancels:

2 cos(theta/2) * cos(theta/2 ) = 2 cos²(theta/2 )

So equation (B) becomes:

2 cos²(theta/2 ) = cosθ + 1

But cosθ +1 = 2 cos²(theta/2 ), which is a trigonometric identity. So yes, it holds. So that's consistent.

So now, from equation (A), a = b cot(theta/2 )

Let me write the eigenvector |v> as [a; b] = [ a; b ]

Since a = b cot(theta/2 ), I can express a in terms of b. Let's choose b = 1 for simplicity, then a = cot(theta/2 )

But wait, I need to normalize the eigenvector. So the eigenvector is [a, b], and the normalization condition is |a|^2 + |b|^2 =1.

But because the eigenvector can be multiplied by a phase factor (since it's a quantum state), we can choose the phase such that b is real and positive, for simplicity. So let's assume b is real and positive, and a is complex if necessary.

Wait, let me think about the matrix. The operator P·n is a Hermitian matrix, so its eigenvectors are real or can be chosen as real, right? Because Hermitian matrices have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors, which can be chosen as real.

Wait, our matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) times [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]. Wait, let me check if this matrix is Hermitian.

The given P components are Hermitian. Px is real and symmetric, so it's Hermitian. Pz is diagonal with real entries, so Hermitian. Py is anti-hermitian because swapping rows and columns gives negative, but multiplied by i, it's Hermitian. Wait, Py is (ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]], which is indeed Hermitian because (Py)† = (ħ/2)[[0,i], [-i,0]] = -Py. Wait, no, let's compute:

The conjugate transpose of Py would be:

(ħ/2) * [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is the negative of Py, which is [[0, -i],[i,0]]. Because Py is (ħ/2) [[0, -i],[i, 0]], so Py† is (ħ/2) [[0, i], [-i, 0]] = [[0, -i], [i, 0]] multiplied by (ħ/2) * (-1). So Py is Hermitian only if (Py)† = Py. Wait, no, because Py† is -Py. So Py is anti-Hermitian, not Hermitian.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because Hermitian matrices satisfy H = H†. So let's compute H = Py:

H = (ħ/2) [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
H† is (ħ/2) [[0, i], [-i, 0]]

Which is equal to (ħ/2) times the negative of H. So H† = -H. So Py is anti-Hermitian. So Py is i times a Hermitian matrix because (iH)† = (-i) H† = (-i)(-H) = i H, which is equal to iH. So Py is anti-Hermitian.

But when you have a vector operator, the dot product with n should be Hermitian, because observables are Hermitian. So P·n must be Hermitian.

Let me check if P·n is Hermitian. Since n is in x-z plane, and the components are P_x, P_z, which are Hermitian, and P_y is anti-Hermitian. So when you take P·n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Each term is Hermitian because P_x and P_z are Hermitian, and sinθ and cosθ are real. So the sum of Hermitian operators is Hermitian, so P·n is Hermitian. That's correct.

So the matrix for P·n is Hermitian, so its eigenvectors can be taken as real (if the eigenvalues are real, which they are, since it's Hermitian).

Wait, but the matrix I wrote for P·n is:

(ħ/2) * [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So is this matrix Hermitian?

Yes, because the (1,2) element is sinθ, and (2,1) is sinθ. The diagonal elements are cosθ and -cosθ. So the matrix is real and symmetric, hence Hermitian.

So the eigenvectors can be taken as real (or with any phase, but perhaps we can take them as real for simplicity).

So the eigenvector [a, b] is real, and we can write a and b as real numbers.

So a = b cot(theta/2 )

Let me see. Let me pick b =1, so a = cot(theta/2 ). Then the eigenvector is [cot(theta/2 ), 1 ].

But I need to normalize it.

The normalization condition is a² + b² =1.

So substituting a = cot(theta/2 ), and b=1:

cot²(theta/2 ) + 1 = csc²(theta/2 ) [since 1 + cot² x = csc² x ]

So the normalization factor is 1 / sqrt( csc²(theta/2 )) ) = sin(theta/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector becomes:

a = cot(theta/2 ) * sin(theta/2 ) = [cos(theta/2 ) / sin(theta/2 ) ] * sin(theta/2 ) = cos(theta/2 )

b = 1 * sin(theta/2 ) = sin(theta/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is [cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ].

Wait, that's because:

The normalized vector is [a, b] = [ cot(theta/2 ), 1 ] * sin(theta/2 )

Because the original vector [a, b] is [cot(theta/2 ), 1], and the normalization factor is 1/sqrt(csc²(theta/2 )) ) = sin(theta/2 )

Wait, maybe I should do it more carefully.

Let me compute a and b after normalization.

The initial vector is [cot(theta/2 ), 1], which can be written as [ cos(theta/2 )/sin(theta/2 ), 1 ]

The norm is sqrt( [cos²(theta/2 ) / sin²(theta/2 ) ] + 1 )

= sqrt( [ cos²(theta/2 ) + sin²(theta/2 ) ] / sin²(theta/2 ) )

= sqrt( 1 / sin²(theta/2 ) )

= 1 / | sin(theta/2 ) | 

Assuming sin(theta/2 ) is positive, which it is for theta between 0 and pi (since theta is the angle in x-z plane, between 0 and pi for a unit vector).

So the normalization factor is sin(theta/2 ), because 1/(1/sin(theta/2 )) ) = sin(theta/2 )

So the normalized vector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Wait, that gives the vector as [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ], which is a unit vector.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Looking back at the options:

Option C is (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )), which matches.

But let me check the other options.

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ)
This looks like it's scaled by ħ, which doesn't make sense because eigenvectors are dimensionless (they are states, not operators). So probably not.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) )
This seems more like spherical harmonics or something, but our solution is based on theta/2.

Option D: (sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2 ), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) )
Again, it's scaled by ħ, which is a problem. Also, the coefficients are sqrt(2/3) and sqrt(1/3), which don't match our solution.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ has components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, each represented as $2 \times 2$ matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. The direction $\vec{n}$ is parameterized as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle from the z-axis.

### Step 1: Construct the operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$
The operator $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$ is given by:
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta
\]
Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$:
\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 2: Solve the eigenvalue equation
The eigenvalue equation is:
\[
\left( \vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \right) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
Substituting the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$:
\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}
\]
This gives the system of equations:
\[
\cos\theta \, a + \sin\theta \, b = a, \quad \sin\theta \, a - \cos\theta \, b = b
\]

### Step 3: Solve for $a$ and $b$
From the first equation:
\[
a (\cos\theta - 1) + b \sin\theta = 0 \implies a = \frac{-b \sin\theta}{\cos\theta - 1}
\]
Using the trigonometric identity $\cos\theta - 1 = -2 \sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2 \sin(\theta/2) \cos(\theta/2)$, we simplify:
\[
a = b \cot(\theta/2)
\]

### Step 4: Normalize the eigenvector
The eigenvector is proportional to:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}
\]
To normalize, we compute the normalization factor:
\[
\sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1} = \sqrt{\csc^2(\theta/2)} = \frac{1}{|\sin(\theta/2)|}
\]
Thus, the normalized eigenvector is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}
\]

### Step 5: Analyze the options
- **Option A**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar, \sqrt{1/3}\hbar)$: Incorrect, as the eigenvector is not scaled by $\hbar$ and does not match the derived components.
- **Option B**: $(\cos\theta, e^{i\phi}\sin\theta)$: Incorrect, as the components involve $\theta$ rather than $\theta/2$.
- **Option C**: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$: Correct, matches the derived normalized eigenvector.
- **Option D**: $(\sqrt{2/3}\hbar \cos(\theta/2), \sqrt{1/3}\hbar \sin(\theta/2))$: Incorrect, as the eigenvector is not scaled by $\hbar$ and the coefficients do not match.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: C**
