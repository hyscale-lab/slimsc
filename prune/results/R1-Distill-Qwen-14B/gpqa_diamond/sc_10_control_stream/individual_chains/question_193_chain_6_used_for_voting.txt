Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over parallax to the fifth power. So, number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Hmm, wait, or is it the number varying as 1/plx^5? Oh, right, it's N ∝ 1/plx^5. 

Wait, but parallax is related to distance. Parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance, right? So plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So, if plx is 1/d, then 1/plx would be d. So let's express N in terms of distance.

If N ∝ 1/(plx)^5, substituting plx = 1/d, so 1/( (1/d)^5 ) = d^5. So N ∝ d^5. So N is proportional to the fifth power of distance.

But wait, the question is asking about how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance. Hmm. So I think it's about the number density or the density of stars as a function of distance.

Wait, maybe it's about the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r. So like, the number of stars between r and r + dr. Or perhaps it's about the number per unit volume, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's about the number of stars per unit distance. So if the number is proportional to d^5, then the number per unit distance (like the derivative) would be proportional to d^4. Wait, because if N is proportional to d^5, then the number per unit distance dr would be d^4. So for each additional distance unit, the number increases by d^4.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The problem says 'how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)'. So maybe the number per unit distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, how does the number per unit distance (like the rate of change of N with d) behave?

Wait, if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dr = 5d^4. So the change in number per unit change in distance is proportional to d^4. So the number of stars increases with distance to the fourth power per unit distance.

But wait, let me double-check that. So if N = k * d^5, then the number of stars per unit distance (since we're considering a unit range) would be the derivative dN/dr, which is 5k d^4. So that's proportional to d^4. So the number per unit distance increases as r^4.

Looking back at the options, option C is ~ r^4. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The question says the number of stars varies as 1/plx^5. So N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, this becomes N ∝ (1/(1/d))^5 = d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Now, when considering per unit distance, like the number of stars you encounter as you move a unit distance further, that's the derivative dN/dr, which is 5d^4. So the number per unit distance is proportional to r^4. So the correct option is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r, which would be proportional to 4πr² * (number density). But wait, number density would be N per volume, so if N ∝ d^5, then per unit volume would be N/(r^3). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a shell is the surface density multiplied by the area of the sphere. But no, the problem seems to be about the number per unit distance, so I think the approach with the derivative is correct.

The question states that the number of stars, \( N \), varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}^5} \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), i.e., \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \), substituting this into the relation gives \( N \propto d^5 \). 

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). This corresponds to the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which is \( \frac{dN}{dr} \). Since \( N \propto d^5 \), taking the derivative yields \( \frac{dN}{dr} \propto d^4 \). Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \).

Among the options provided, the correct answer is \( \sim r^4 \), which corresponds to option C.
