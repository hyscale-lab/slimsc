Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Oh wait, no, I think I'm mixing up something. Wait, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are typically represented as columns, and their elements are complex numbers. But here, the state is (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, maybe these are real numbers? Because complex numbers would have an 'i' somewhere, but maybe it's just real. I'll proceed with that.

The operators P and Q are given as square matrices. The matrix for P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Let me write that down:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

And the operator Q has a matrix:
[
[1,0,0],
[0,0,0],
[0,0,-1]
]

The question is about measuring P first and then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no, the order is: someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the sequence is P first, then Q. So we need to find the probabilities for the outcomes 0 in P and -1 in Q.

Wait, no, the question specifically says: the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements. So their measurements are in that order: first P is measured, then Q. But wait, in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of the operator. So measuring P first will collapse the state into an eigenstate of P, and then measuring Q on that new state.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around: if you measure P, then Q, then the probabilities depend on the results of each step.

Wait, no. The process is: initial state is |ψ⟩. You measure P, get outcome p, which collapses the state to the eigenstate of P corresponding to p. Then, you measure Q on this new state, get outcome q. So the probability we're looking for is the probability that P is 0 and Q is -1, given the initial state.

But wait, perhaps the operator P has eigenvalues, including 0. Let me find the eigenvalues of P. Because the possible outcomes of P are its eigenvalues.

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Since P is a 3x3 matrix, let's compute its characteristic equation. The trace is the sum of diagonal elements: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

The determinant might be a bit tricky, but perhaps there's a pattern. Let's compute:

The matrix P is symmetric, so it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues.

Looking at P's structure, perhaps it's a symmetric matrix with a particular pattern. Let me write it:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Hmm. Let's compute the eigenvalues. Let's denote λ as the eigenvalue.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix (P - λ I) is:

Row 1: -λ, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, -λ

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (0)(1/√2) ] + 0 * [ ... ] 

Wait, maybe expanding the determinant is a bit tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by noticing symmetries or patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the eigenvalues numerically.

Let me compute the trace (sum of diagonal elements) is zero, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

The determinant of P is the product of the eigenvalues. Let's compute the determinant of P.

Well, the determinant is the sum of all permutations of the product of elements, with the appropriate signs.

But for 3x3 it's manageable.

det(P) = 0*(0*0 - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2)*( (1/√2)(0) - (1/√2)(0) ) + 0*( ... )

Wait, no, perhaps I should use the formula for a 3x3 determinant.

Alternatively, maybe using a method of minors.

But maybe another approach: Let me compute the determinant by expanding along the first row.

det(P) = 0 * minor(1,1) - (1/√2) * minor(1,2) + 0 * minor(1,3)

So minor(1,2) is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2.

So the minor(1,2) matrix is:

Row 2: 1/√2, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, -λ (Wait, no, wait. Wait, the minor is the determinant for (P - λ I) at (1,2), so I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant numerically for P.

Wait, let me compute the determinant of P as follows:

The matrix P is:
Row1: 0, a, 0
Row2: a, 0, a
Row3: 0, a, 0
where a = 1/√2.

The determinant is calculated as:

0 * determinant of the submatrix [[0, a], [a, 0]] minus a * determinant of [[a, a], [0, 0]] plus 0 * something.

Wait, no, the first row is [0, a, 0], so expanding:

0*( minor 11 ) - a*( minor 12 ) + 0*( minor 13 )

Minor 12 is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2. So the minor is:

Row2: a, a
Row3: 0, 0

Wait, no, no— if you remove column 2, the remaining elements are:

Row2: a (column1), a (column3)
Row3: 0, 0

Wait, no, the minor for (1,2) is:

Row2: a (column1), a (column3)
Row3: 0 (column1), 0 (column3)

Wait, no, because when you remove column 2, the columns are 1 and 3. So Row2 after removing column 2 is [a (from column1), a (from column3)], and Row3 after removing column2 is [0 (column1), 0 (column3)].

So the minor 12 matrix is:
a  a
0  0

The determinant of this is (a)(0) - (a)(0) = 0.

So the determinant of P is 0 * ... - a * (0) + 0 = 0. So det(P) is zero. So one of the eigenvalues is zero.

Since the trace is zero, the sum of eigenvalues is zero. So the eigenvalues are λ1, λ2, 0, with λ1 + λ2 = 0. So λ2 = -λ1.

Wait, but P is a 3x3 matrix, so three eigenvalues. So perhaps the eigenvalues are √2, -√2, and 0? Not sure, but let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvectors.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The operator Q is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. The eigenvectors are the basis vectors.

Because the matrix Q is:

[1 0 0]
[0 0 0]
[0 0 -1]

So when you measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1. And the eigenstates are the standard basis vectors: |1> = (1,0,0), |2>=(0,1,0), |3>=(0,0,1).

Wait, but then the diagonal elements correspond to each eigenvalue. So for eigenvalue 1, the eigenvector is (1,0,0), for 0, it's (0,1,0), and for -1, it's (0,0,1).

Now, let's get back to the problem. The initial state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be normalized. Let's check the norm.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the state is not normalized. But perhaps the problem assumes that it's normalized, or perhaps I was given the state as a vector of components, not necessarily normalized. Wait, the problem states that the state is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). So perhaps it's not normalized. Oh, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized since it represents a physical state. So perhaps I should normalize it first.

Wait, normalization: the state vector |ψ> is ( -1, 2, 1 ). The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1).

But the question is about the probabilities after measuring P and then Q. So perhaps the initial state is not normalized, but when measuring, we'll have to consider the probabilities based on the squared moduli of the components.

Wait, but for the probabilities, perhaps we can proceed without normalizing. Let me think.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, probabilities are calculated using the inner product, so the state should be normalized. So perhaps the given state is just a vector, and I need to normalize it before proceeding.

So first, let's compute the normalized state. The norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state is:

|ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1) = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )

Now, the first measurement is of P, and we're interested in the outcome 0.

So let's find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Since P is symmetric, it's diagonalizable, and the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis.

Looking at P, perhaps we can find the eigenvectors. Let's find the eigenspace for λ=0.

We solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0.

So the equations are:

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Similarly, second equation: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (v1 + v3)/√2 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0.

Third equation: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → same as first equation, v2=0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are all vectors where v2=0 and v1 = -v3.

So the eigenspace is two-dimensional, spanned by vectors like (1,0,-1) and (0,0,0) — wait, no, wait. Wait, the vectors must satisfy v2=0 and v1 =-v3.

So any vector in this eigenspace can be written as (a, 0, -a) for any a.

So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1). So the normalized eigenvector would be (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, because the norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so normalized by 1/sqrt(2).

So |P=0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Now, when we measure P, the probability of getting 0 is the squared modulus of the inner product between |ψ> and |P=0>.

So the inner product is:

⟨P=0|ψ⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) ) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) )= (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) )= (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)) )

Third term: (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )= (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) )= same as above, (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

So sum is [ (-1)/(2√3) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(2√3) ) ] = (-2)/(2√3) ) = (-1)/√3.

The modulus squared is [ (-1)/√3 ]^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of getting 0 for P is 1/3.

Now, after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses to |P=0>, which is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Then, we measure Q.

The operator Q has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

But the state after P measurement is |P=0> which is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So let's express this state in the eigenbasis of Q. Since Q's eigenstates are the standard basis vectors, the state can be written as a linear combination of |Q=1>, |Q=0>, and |Q=-1>.

So let's write |P=0> as components in the Q eigenbasis:

|P=0> = (1/sqrt(2)) |Q=1> + 0 |Q=0> + (-1/sqrt(2)) |Q=-1>.

So when we measure Q, the probabilities are the squared moduli of the coefficients.

So the probability of getting -1 is | (-1/sqrt(2)) |^2 = (1/2).

So the probability after measuring P=0 is 1/2 for Q=-1.

So the combined probability of first getting P=0 and then Q=-1 is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the measurement of Q occurs in the state |P=0>, which is already an eigenstate of P, but not of Q. So when we measure Q, the result depends on the expansion of |P=0> in the Q eigenbasis.

So the probabilities are as I computed: P=0 is 1/3, then in that state, Q=-1 has a 1/2 probability. So the combined probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

So the answer should be D.

The problem involves a quantum system with an initial state vector given as \( \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \). This state is not normalized, so it is first normalized by dividing by its norm, \( \sqrt{6} \), resulting in the normalized state:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

To find the probability of measuring \( P = 0 \), we first determine the eigenvectors of \( P \) corresponding to the eigenvalue \( 0 \). Solving \( (P - 0I)|v\rangle = 0 \), the eigenvectors are of the form \( (a, 0, -a) \). A normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|P=0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the squared modulus of the inner product between \( |\psi\rangle \) and \( |P=0\rangle \):

\[
\langle P=0|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The modulus squared is:

\[
|\langle P=0|\psi\rangle|^2 = \left(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

After measuring \( P = 0 \), the system collapses to the state \( |P=0\rangle \). The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding eigenvectors \( |Q=1\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \), \( |Q=0\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \), and \( |Q=-1\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \). The state \( |P=0\rangle \) can be expressed in the \( Q \)-eigenbasis as:

\[
|P=0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |Q=1\rangle + 0 |Q=0\rangle - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |Q=-1\rangle.
\]

The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the squared modulus of the coefficient of \( |Q=-1\rangle \):

\[
\left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

The combined probability of first measuring \( P = 0 \) and then \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P=0 \text{ and } Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The problem says that the state of the system at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Wait, wait, that doesn't seem right. Oh wait, no, I think I'm mixing up something.

The operators P and Q are given as square matrices. The matrix for P has elements in the first row as (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). Let me write that down:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

And the operator Q has a matrix:
[
[1,0,0],
[0,0,0],
[0,0,-1]
]

The question is about measuring P first and then Q, and finding the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q.

Wait, no, the order is: someone measures Q just after the measurement of P. So the sequence is P first, then Q. So we need to find the probabilities for the outcomes 0 in P and -1 in Q.

Wait, no, the question specifically says: the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements. So their measurements are in that order: first P is measured, then Q. But wait, in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of the operator. So measuring P first will collapse the state into an eigenstate of P, and then measuring Q on that new state.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around: if you measure P, then Q, then the probabilities depend on the results of each step.

Wait, no. The process is: initial state is |ψ⟩. You measure P, get outcome p, which collapses the state to the eigenstate of P corresponding to p. Then, you measure Q on this new state, get outcome q. So the probability we're looking for is the probability that P is 0 and Q is -1, given the initial state.

But wait, perhaps the operator P has eigenvalues, including 0. Let me find the eigenvalues of P. Because the possible outcomes of P are its eigenvalues.

So first, I need to find the eigenvalues of P. Since P is a 3x3 matrix, let's compute its characteristic equation. The trace is the sum of diagonal elements: 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

The determinant might be a bit tricky, but perhaps there's a pattern. Let's compute:

The matrix P is symmetric, so it's diagonalizable with real eigenvalues.

Looking at P's structure, perhaps it's a symmetric matrix with a particular pattern. Let me write it:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Hmm. Let's compute the eigenvalues. Let's denote λ as the eigenvalue.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

So the matrix (P - λ I) is:

Row 1: -λ, 1/√2, 0
Row 2: 1/√2, -λ, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, 1/√2, -λ

The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (0)(1/√2) ] + 0 * [ ... ] 

Wait, maybe expanding the determinant is a bit tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvalues by noticing symmetries or patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the eigenvalues numerically.

Let me compute the trace (sum of diagonal elements) is zero, so the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

The determinant of P is the product of the eigenvalues. Let's compute the determinant of P.

Well, the determinant is the sum of all permutations of the product of elements, with the appropriate signs.

But for 3x3 it's manageable.

det(P) = 0*(0*0 - (1/√2)(1/√2)) - (1/√2)*( (1/√2)(0) - (1/√2)(0) ) + 0*( ... )

Wait, no, perhaps I should use the formula for a 3x3 determinant.

Alternatively, maybe using a method of minors.

But maybe another approach: Let me compute the determinant by expanding along the first row.

det(P) = 0 * minor(1,1) - (1/√2) * minor(1,2) + 0 * minor(1,3)

So minor(1,2) is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2.

So the minor(1,2) matrix is:

Row 2: 1/√2, 1/√2
Row 3: 0, -λ (Wait, no, wait. Wait, the minor is the determinant for (P - λ I) at (1,2), so I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant numerically for P.

Wait, let me compute the determinant of P as follows:

The matrix P is:
Row1: 0, a, 0
Row2: a, 0, a
Row3: 0, a, 0
where a = 1/√2.

The determinant is calculated as:

0 * determinant of the submatrix [[0, a], [a, 0]] minus a * determinant of [[a, a], [0, 0]] plus 0 * something.

Wait, no, the first row is [0, a, 0], so expanding:

0*( minor 11 ) - a*( minor 12 ) + 0*( minor 13 )

Minor 12 is the determinant of the 2x2 matrix obtained by removing row 1 and column 2. So the minor is:

Row2: a, a
Row3: 0, 0

Wait, no, no— if you remove column 2, the remaining elements are:

Row2: a (column1), a (column3)
Row3: 0, 0

Wait, no, the minor for (1,2) is:

Row2: a (column1), a (column3)
Row3: 0 (column1), 0 (column3)

Wait, no, because when you remove column 2, the columns are 1 and 3. So Row2 after removing column 2 is [a (from column1), a (from column3)], and Row3 after removing column2 is [0 (column1), 0 (column3)].

So the minor 12 matrix is:
a  a
0  0

The determinant of this is (a)(0) - (a)(0) = 0.

So the determinant of P is 0 * ... - a * (0) + 0 = 0. So det(P) is zero. So one of the eigenvalues is zero.

Since the trace is zero, the sum of eigenvalues is zero. So the eigenvalues are λ1, λ2, 0, with λ1 + λ2 = 0. So λ2 = -λ1.

Wait, but P is a 3x3 matrix, so three eigenvalues. So perhaps the eigenvalues are √2, -√2, and 0? Not sure, but let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the eigenvectors.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The operator Q is diagonal, so its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. The eigenvectors are the basis vectors.

Because the matrix Q is:

[1 0 0]
[0 0 0]
[0 0 -1]

So when you measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1. And the eigenstates are the standard basis vectors: |1> = (1,0,0), |2>=(0,1,0), |3>=(0,0,1).

Wait, but then the diagonal elements correspond to each eigenvalue. So for eigenvalue 1, the eigenvector is (1,0,0), for 0, it's (0,1,0), and for -1, it's (0,0,1).

Now, let's get back to the problem. The initial state is given as (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector should be normalized. Let's check the norm.

The norm squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. So the state is not normalized. But perhaps the problem assumes that it's normalized, or perhaps I was given the state as a vector of components, not necessarily normalized. Wait, the problem states that the state is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). So perhaps it's not normalized. Oh, but in quantum mechanics, the state vector must be normalized since it represents a physical state. So perhaps I should normalize it first.

Wait, normalization: the state vector |ψ> is ( -1, 2, 1 ). The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 +1^2 ) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1).

But the question is about the probabilities after measuring P and then Q. So perhaps the initial state is not normalized, but when measuring, we'll have to consider the probabilities based on the squared moduli of the components.

Wait, but for the probabilities, perhaps we can proceed without normalizing. Let me think.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, probabilities are calculated using the inner product, so the state should be normalized. So perhaps the given state is just a vector, and I need to normalize it before proceeding.

So first, let's compute the normalized state. The norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state is:

|ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) * (-1, 2, 1) = ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )

Now, the first measurement is of P, and we're interested in the outcome 0.

So let's find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

Since P is symmetric, it's diagonalizable, and the eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis.

Looking at P, perhaps we can find the eigenvectors. Let's find the eigenspace for λ=0.

We solve (P - 0 I) |v> = 0.

So the equations are:

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Similarly, second equation: (1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (v1 + v3)/√2 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0.

Third equation: 0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → same as first equation, v2=0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 are all vectors where v2=0 and v1 = -v3.

So the eigenspace is two-dimensional, spanned by vectors like (1,0,-1) and (0,0,0) — wait, no, wait. Wait, the vectors must satisfy v2=0 and v1 =-v3.

So any vector in this eigenspace can be written as (a, 0, -a) for any a.

So the eigenvectors are scalar multiples of (1, 0, -1). So the normalized eigenvector would be (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, because the norm is sqrt(1^2 + 0^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2), so normalized by 1/sqrt(2).

So |P=0> = (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Now, when we measure P, the probability of getting 0 is the squared modulus of the inner product between |ψ> and |P=0>.

So the inner product is:

⟨P=0|ψ⟩ = (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) ) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) ) + (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )

Calculating each term:

First term: (1/sqrt(2)) * (-1/sqrt(6)) )= (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) )= (-1)/sqrt(12) = (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)) )

Third term: (-1/sqrt(2)) * (1/sqrt(6)) )= (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) )= same as above, (-1)/(2*sqrt(3)).

So sum is [ (-1)/(2√3) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1)/(2√3) ) ] = (-2)/(2√3) ) = (-1)/√3.

The modulus squared is [ (-1)/√3 ]^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of getting 0 for P is 1/3.

Now, after measuring P and getting 0, the state collapses to |P=0>, which is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Then, we measure Q.

The operator Q has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1. So when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1.

But the state after P measurement is |P=0> which is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

So let's express this state in the eigenbasis of Q. Since Q's eigenstates are the standard basis vectors, the state can be written as a linear combination of |Q=1>, |Q=0>, and |Q=-1>.

So let's write |P=0> as components in the Q eigenbasis:

|P=0> = (1/sqrt(2)) |Q=1> + 0 |Q=0> + (-1/sqrt(2)) |Q=-1>.

So when we measure Q, the probabilities are the squared moduli of the coefficients.

So the probability of getting -1 is | (-1/sqrt(2)) |^2 = (1/2).

So the probability after measuring P=0 is 1/2 for Q=-1.

So the combined probability of first getting P=0 and then Q=-1 is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the measurement of Q occurs in the state |P=0>, which is already an eigenstate of P, but not of Q. So when we measure Q, the result depends on the expansion of |P=0> in the Q eigenbasis.

So the probabilities are as I computed: P=0 is 1/3, then in that state, Q=-1 has a 1/2 probability. So the combined probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

So the answer should be D.


The problem involves a quantum system with an initial state vector given as \( \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \). This state is not normalized, so it is first normalized by dividing by its norm, \( \sqrt{6} \), resulting in the normalized state:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

To find the probability of measuring \( P = 0 \), we first determine the eigenvectors of \( P \) corresponding to the eigenvalue \( 0 \). Solving \( (P - 0I)|v\rangle = 0 \), the eigenvectors are of the form \( (a, 0, -a) \). A normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|P=0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the squared modulus of the inner product between \( |\psi\rangle \) and \( |P=0\rangle \):

\[
\langle P=0|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The modulus squared is:

\[
|\langle P=0|\psi\rangle|^2 = \left(\frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

After measuring \( P = 0 \), the system collapses to the state \( |P=0\rangle \). The operator \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding eigenvectors \( |Q=1\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \), \( |Q=0\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \), and \( |Q=-1\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \). The state \( |P=0\rangle \) can be expressed in the \( Q \)-eigenbasis as:

\[
|P=0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |Q=1\rangle + 0 |Q=0\rangle - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} |Q=-1\rangle.
\]

The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the squared modulus of the coefficient of \( |Q=-1\rangle \):

\[
\left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

The combined probability of first measuring \( P = 0 \) and then \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P=0 \text{ and } Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

**Answer: D**
