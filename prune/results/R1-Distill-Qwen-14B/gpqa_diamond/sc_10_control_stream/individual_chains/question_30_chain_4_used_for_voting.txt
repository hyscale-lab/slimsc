Okay, so I've got this question about a textile dye and the light it emits. Hmm, I think I remember something about the energy of light and colors from my classes. Let me think through this.

The question says the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. Wait, I think when a substance absorbs light, it's the complementary color that's emitted. Oh right, because absorption and emission are related through the color wheel. So if it emits a certain color, it must have absorbed the opposite.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. When a compound absorbs light, it's actually absorbing a specific wavelength, and the color we see is the complementary color. Because the absorbed color is taken in, and the rest is reflected or transmitted, which we perceive as the color of the object.

So the energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV. I need to find out what color that corresponds to. Oh, right, I think there's a formula to convert energy to wavelength, and then from wavelength to color.

The formula I remember is E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c the speed of light, and λ the wavelength. Let me jot down the constants. Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s, and the speed of light c is about 3.00 x 10^8 m/s.

But since the energy given is in electron volts (eV), maybe there's a shortcut. Oh yeah, I remember that 1 eV corresponds to a wavelength of about 1240 nm. So the formula in eV would be λ (nm) ≈ 1240 / E (eV).

So plugging in 2.3393 eV: λ ≈ 1240 / 2.3393. Let me calculate that. 1240 divided by 2.3393... Let's see, 2.3393 is roughly 2.34. 1240 / 2.34 is about 529.8 nm. Wait, that's approximately 530 nm. 

What color is around 530 nm? I think green is around there. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, the visible spectrum goes from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So 530 nm is in the green region, but wait, the question is about what color is absorbed. Wait, no. Wait a second, the compound emits light when it loses energy. So the energy it emits corresponds to the wavelength it's emitting, which is the color we see. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the dye emits light with that energy. So if it emits light of a certain wavelength, that would be the color we see. But the question is asking what color is absorbed. Because when a compound absorbs a photon, it gets excited, then emits a photon. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than the emitted one, right?

Wait, no, maybe the dye absorbs a certain wavelength, and then emits another. The emission is what we see as the color of the dye. So if the dye is emitting light at 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm (green), then the color we see is green. But the question is, what color is absorbed? Because it must have absorbed a higher energy photon to get excited, which then emits a lower energy photon.

Wait, but the question is a bit different. It says, the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. So the color emitted is the color of the light we see. But the question is about the color absorbed by the compound. Oh wait, no. Wait, the compound absorbs light, and that's what excites it to emit light. So the emitted light is the color that is not absorbed. Or wait, perhaps the absorbed light is the complementary color.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let's think step by step. The compound absorbs certain wavelengths (colors) and reflects others. The color we see is the one that's not absorbed, i.e., the compound emits that color when excited. So if the compound emits green light, then it must have absorbed the complementary color, which would be magenta. But wait, the options given are red, violet, blue, yellow. Hmm.

Wait, but 530 nm is green. The complementary color on the color wheel is magenta, which is a combination of red and blue. But none of the options are magenta. So perhaps I need to think differently.

Alternatively, maybe I've got this backwards. The energy given is the energy of the emitted light. So the compound, when excited, emits at 2.3393 eV, which is green. So the compound must have absorbed a higher energy photon to reach that excited state. Because when an electron is excited, it absorbs a photon of higher energy than the emitted photon. So the energy absorbed is higher.

So the absorbed photon's energy is higher than 2.3393 eV. Let's calculate the wavelength of that. Wait, but maybe I should find the absorbed photon's wavelength. Let's think, if emission is at 2.3393 eV, the absorption must be at a higher energy, which would correspond to a shorter wavelength (since higher energy is lower wavelength). So the absorbed light would be of higher energy, that is, shorter wavelength.

Wait, but maybe the question is phrased differently. Let me read it again: "What color of light is absorbed by the organic compound?" Oh, right. So the compound absorbs a certain wavelength, which causes it to emit another. The emitted light is 2.3393 eV, so the absorbed must be higher.

But how do we find the absorbed wavelength? Well, the energy difference between the absorbed and emitted would correspond to the energy gap of the compound. But without knowing the exact energy difference, perhaps I need to think in terms of the color.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is equal to the energy of the emitted photon plus the energy gap. Wait, no. When a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited to a higher energy state. Then, when it relaxes, it emits a photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon (E_absorbed) equals the energy of the emitted photon (E_emitted) plus the energy difference between the excited state and the ground state (E_gap).

Wait, but without knowing E_gap, perhaps the question is implying that the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than E_emitted. So the absorbed wavelength would be shorter than the emitted wavelength.

So since the emitted wavelength is about 530 nm (green), the absorbed wavelength must be shorter, which would correspond to higher energy, so perhaps blue or violet.

Wait, but looking at the options: A is red (long wavelength), B is violet (short), C is blue (shorter than green?), D is yellow (~570 nm?).

Wait, wait, actually, the colors and their approximate wavelengths:

- Violet: ~400-440 nm

- Blue: ~450-495 nm

- Green: ~495-570 nm

- Yellow: ~570-590 nm

- Orange: ~590-620 nm

- Red: ~620-750 nm

So, if the emitted light is at 530 nm (green), the absorbed wavelength would be higher in energy, which is shorter wavelength. So if the emitted is green, the absorbed is a color with a shorter wavelength than green. So that would be blue or violet.

Wait, but the question is, what color is absorbed. So the compound absorbs a photon of higher energy, which corresponds to a color with a shorter wavelength than the emitted light.

So the options are A) Red (longer wavelength, lower energy), which is not correct. B) Violet (short, high energy), yes, possible. C) Blue (shorter than green), yes. D) Yellow (longer than green).

So the compound absorbs either violet or blue. Hmm, but how do I pick between them?

Wait, the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. The energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So let's compute the absorbed wavelength.

Wait, but without knowing the energy gap, I can't directly compute the absorbed wavelength. Hmm, so maybe this approach is not the right way.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler. Maybe the energy emitted is the energy of the photon that the compound emits, which is the energy difference between two energy levels. So the absorbed photon's energy is higher, but perhaps it's in the same vicinity. Or maybe the question is implying that the compound emits light in that energy, so the color absorbed is the same as what it emits?

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because typically, when something is colored, it's because it absorbs certain wavelengths and reflects others. So the color we see is the color that's not absorbed (i.e., the complementary color). Wait, but the question is about the color absorbed.

So if the compound emits light with energy 2.3393 eV (green), then the color it's emitting is green. Which would mean that green is not the color it absorbs. Wait, no, no. Let me think again. The compound absorbs a certain color, which excites it, and then when it relaxes, it emits another color, which is what we see as the color of the compound.

So if the compound appears green, that means it's emitting green, which implies that it absorbed the complementary color. The complementary of green is magenta, but that's not an option. So perhaps I got this wrong.

Wait, the options are A) Red, B) Violet, C) Blue, D) Yellow.

Wait, another approach: the energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. Let's calculate the wavelength.

E = hc/λ

Rearranged, λ = hc/E.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

E = 2.3393 eV = 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J = about 3.745e-19 J.

So λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.745e-19) = (1.9878e-25) / (3.745e-19) = approximately 5.306e-7 m, which is 530.6 nm. So around 530 nm, which is green. So the dye emits green light.

So the color that the dye appears is green, which is the color that is not absorbed. So the dye must have absorbed the complementary color. The complementary of green is magenta, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the question is not about the color we see, but the color absorbed. So the compound absorbs a certain color, which is the energy given. So if the emitted energy is 2.3393 eV, which is 530 nm (green), then the compound must have absorbed that. But that can't be, because if it absorbs green, it wouldn't emit green.

Wait, wait, no. Because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it gets excited, then emits a photon when it relaxes. So the absorbed photon is higher in energy than the emitted one. So the absorbed photon would correspond to a shorter wavelength than the emitted.

So the emitted is green (530 nm), so the absorbed photon would have a wavelength shorter than 530 nm, which is in the blue or violet region.

So the absorbed color is either violet or blue, which are options B and C.

But which one? How do I decide whether it's blue or violet?

Hmm, maybe the energy difference can help. Let's say the compound absorbs a photon of energy E_abs and emits a photon of E_emit = 2.3393 eV.

The energy difference E_abs - E_emit would be the energy gap of the compound. Without knowing the gap, perhaps we can't find the exact value, but maybe the question expects us to know that for dyes, the energy gap is such that the absorbed light is in the visible range, probably in the blue or violet.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound's absorption maximum is in the blue region. Wait, but without knowing more, I'm not sure. So perhaps the question is expecting me to think that the compound emits light with energy 2.3393 eV, so the color it's emitting is green. Therefore, the color it absorbed must be the complementary color, which is magenta. But again, magenta's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the question is about the color of the emitted light, and what color is absorbed. Wait, no, the question is what color is absorbed.

Wait, another thought. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon's wavelength is shorter than 530 nm.

So which color has a wavelength shorter than 530? Violet is around 400-440, blue is 450-495. So both are shorter than 530.

So the options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

But how to choose between them?

Hmm, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is close to the emitted. Let me think. If the dye emits green, perhaps it absorbs blue or violet.

Wait, another approach: the energy difference between absorption and emission is the energy gap. Let's say the energy of the absorbed photon is E_abs = E_emit + ΔE, where ΔE is the energy gap.

But without knowing ΔE, perhaps the question is expecting me to know that the energy of 2.3393 eV is in the green region, so the absorbed must be blue or violet. So the options are B and C.

Wait, looking at the options, the colors are Red, Violet, Blue, Yellow.

Wait, another thought: The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. What's the approximate wavelength? 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm, which is green.

So the compound must have absorbed a higher energy photon, which would be in the blue or violet region.

So the options are B and C.

But the question is, which one is the correct answer? Let me think about the possible energy of absorbed photons.

If the emitted is 2.34 eV, what's the likely absorbed wavelength? Let's say the energy gap is around 3 eV, which is a common energy gap for dyes. Wait, no. 3 eV would be about 413 nm, which is violet. So if the compound absorbs at 3 eV, emits at 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed wavelength is 413 nm (violet), and the emitted is 530 nm (green).

So in that case, the absorbed color would be violet.

Alternatively, if the energy gap is smaller, say 2.5 eV, the absorbed wavelength would be about 496 nm (blue).

So without knowing the exact energy gap, it's hard to say, but the options are B and C.

Wait, perhaps the question is implying that the compound emits light with energy 2.3393 eV, so the color absorbed is the same as the emitted. But that doesn't make sense because if it absorbed green, it wouldn't emit green.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking what color is emitted, but the options are colors, and it's a trick question. But the question is clearly about what's absorbed.

Wait, the question says, the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. What color is absorbed.

So the dye must have absorbed a photon of higher energy than 2.3393 eV. Because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it's promoting an electron to a higher energy state, and then when it relaxes, it emits a photon of lower energy.

So the absorbed photon has higher energy (lower wavelength) than the emitted.

Therefore, the absorbed color has a shorter wavelength than 530 nm.

So among the options, B is violet (400-440 nm), C is blue (450-495 nm).

So the absorbed color must be either violet or blue.

The question is, which one?

Well, 2.3393 eV is the energy of the emitted photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than that.

So E_abs > E_emit.

So let's compute E_abs for each option.

For Violet: let's say 400 nm.

E_violet = 1240 / 400 = 3.1 eV.

For Blue: say 450 nm.

E_blue = 1240 / 450 ≈ 2.76 eV.

So both are higher than 2.3393 eV.

So which is more likely? Oh, but the question is about the color absorbed by the organic compound.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is B) Violet.

Wait, but why would it absorb violet? Maybe it's a common absorption for dyes. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the absorption to be in the same region as the emission, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: What is the energy difference between green (530 nm, 2.34 eV) and the other options.

If the absorbed is violet (400 nm, 3.1 eV), then the energy gap is 3.1 - 2.34 = 0.76 eV.

If the absorbed is blue (450 nm, 2.76 eV), the gap is 0.42 eV.

Well, energy gaps in organic compounds can vary, but often they are in the range of a few eV. So both are possible.

But without more information, I can't be certain. So perhaps the answer is B) Violet, as that's a higher energy than green and thus a more likely absorbed wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler. Since the emitted wavelength is around 530 nm (green), the absorbed must be the complementary color, which is in the magenta region. But since the options don't have magenta, perhaps the question is expecting me to know that the absorbed color is blue or violet. And given that the options are B and C, perhaps the answer is B) Violet.

Wait, but wait. The complementary color of green is magenta, which is a combination of blue and red. But in terms of single colors, perhaps the main absorbed is in the blue region. Hmm. Or maybe the question is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the complementary color but the actual absorbed wavelength. So the compound absorbs light at 2.3393 eV, which is green, but that can't be because when you absorb green, you would emit another color. Wait, no. Wait, the question states the dye emits light with that energy, so it's emitting green. Therefore, the color absorbed must be something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this all wrong. Let me think differently. The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, which is green. The color absorbed is the one that is not emitted. Wait, no, because when something emits light, it's because it has absorbed that light.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to approach this from another angle.

The energy level diagram: when a molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from a lower energy level (ground state) to a higher one (excited state). Then, it emits a photon when it relaxes to a lower energy level than the ground state, but perhaps not all the way down.

Wait, no. When it relaxes, it can emit a photon with energy equal to the difference between the excited state and the new lower state.

So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted one. So if the emitted photon is at 2.3393 eV, the absorbed must be higher.

So the absorbed color must be higher energy, shorter wavelength, which would be blue or violet.

So the answer is either B or C.

But which one?

Hmm. Maybe the most common answer for this kind of question is that the absorbed color is violet. Because 2.3393 eV is green, and the absorbed is higher energy (violet).

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the use of the relationship between energy and color.

Wait, I think I remember that lower energy photons are red, and higher are violet.

So the emitted is green, so the absorbed must be higher, so violet.

So the answer is B) Violet.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we start by analyzing the energy of the emitted light, which is given as **2.3393 eV**. Using the relationship between energy and wavelength, \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( c \) is the speed of light, we can approximate the wavelength of the emitted light using the shortcut \( \lambda \approx \frac{1240}{E} \) (in nanometers when \( E \) is in eV). 

Substituting \( E = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{1240}{2.3393} \approx 530 \, \text{nm}.
\]

This wavelength corresponds to green light. The compound emits green light, which means it must have absorbed a photon of higher energy (shorter wavelength) to excite an electron to a higher energy state. The absorbed photon's energy is related to the energy gap between the ground and excited states, but the exact gap is not provided. 

The absorbed photon must have a shorter wavelength than 530 nm, corresponding to higher energy. Among the options provided, violet (400–440 nm) and blue (450–495 nm) fall into this range. To decide between them, we note that the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than 2.3393 eV. For example:

- Violet light at 400 nm corresponds to \( E \approx 3.1 \, \text{eV} \).
- Blue light at 450 nm corresponds to \( E \approx 2.76 \, \text{eV} \).

Both are valid possibilities, but violet is a higher energy and shorter wavelength, making it more likely to be absorbed by the compound. Thus, the compound absorbs violet light, which aligns with the energy gap and the typical behavior of organic dyes.

E = hc/λ

Rearranged, λ = hc/E.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

E = 2.3393 eV = 2.3393 * 1.602e-19 J = about 3.745e-19 J.

So λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (3.745e-19) = (1.9878e-25) / (3.745e-19) = approximately 5.306e-7 m, which is 530.6 nm. So around 530 nm, which is green. So the dye emits green light.

So the color that the dye appears is green, which is the color that is not absorbed. So the dye must have absorbed the complementary color. The complementary of green is magenta, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing something.

So the emitted is green (530 nm), so the absorbed photon would have a wavelength shorter than 530 nm, which is in the blue or violet region.

So the absorbed color is either violet or blue, which are options B and C.

But which one? How do I decide whether it's blue or violet?

Hmm, maybe the energy difference can help. Let's say the compound absorbs a photon of energy E_abs and emits a photon of E_emit = 2.3393 eV.

The energy difference E_abs - E_emit would be the energy gap of the compound. Without knowing the gap, perhaps we can't find the exact value, but maybe the question expects us to know that for dyes, the energy gap is such that the absorbed light is in the visible range, probably in the blue or violet.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound's absorption maximum is in the blue region. Wait, but without knowing more, I'm not sure. So perhaps the question is expecting me to think that the compound emits light with energy 2.3393 eV, so the color it's emitting is green. Therefore, the color it absorbed must be the complementary color, which is magenta. But again, magenta's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the question is about the color of the emitted light, and what color is absorbed. Wait, no, the question is what color is absorbed.

Wait, another thought. The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. So the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than that. So the absorbed photon's wavelength is shorter than 530 nm.

So which color has a wavelength shorter than 530? Violet is around 400-440, blue is 450-495. So both are shorter than 530.

So the options are B) Violet and C) Blue.

But how to choose between them?

Hmm, perhaps the energy of the absorbed photon is close to the emitted. Let me think. If the dye emits green, perhaps it absorbs blue or violet.

Wait, another approach: the energy difference between absorption and emission is the energy gap. Let's say the energy of the absorbed photon is E_abs = E_emit + ΔE, where ΔE is the energy gap.

But without knowing ΔE, perhaps the question is expecting me to know that the energy of 2.3393 eV is in the green region, so the absorbed must be blue or violet. So the options are B and C.

Wait, looking at the options, the colors are Red, Violet, Blue, Yellow.

Wait, another thought: The energy of the emitted photon is 2.3393 eV. What's the approximate wavelength? 1240 / 2.3393 ≈ 530 nm, which is green.

So the compound must have absorbed a higher energy photon, which would be in the blue or violet region.

So the options are B and C.

But the question is, which one is the correct answer? Let me think about the possible energy of absorbed photons.

If the emitted is 2.34 eV, what's the likely absorbed wavelength? Let's say the energy gap is around 3 eV, which is a common energy gap for dyes. Wait, no. 3 eV would be about 413 nm, which is violet. So if the compound absorbs at 3 eV, emits at 2.3393 eV, then the absorbed wavelength is 413 nm (violet), and the emitted is 530 nm (green).

So in that case, the absorbed color would be violet.

Alternatively, if the energy gap is smaller, say 2.5 eV, the absorbed wavelength would be about 496 nm (blue).

So without knowing the exact energy gap, it's hard to say, but the options are B and C.

Wait, perhaps the question is implying that the compound emits light with energy 2.3393 eV, so the color absorbed is the same as the emitted. But that doesn't make sense because if it absorbed green, it wouldn't emit green.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking what color is emitted, but the options are colors, and it's a trick question. But the question is clearly about what's absorbed.

Wait, the question says, the dye emits light with energy 2.3393 eV. What color is absorbed.

So the dye must have absorbed a photon of higher energy than 2.3393 eV. Because when a molecule absorbs a photon, it's promoting an electron to a higher energy state, and then when it relaxes, it emits a photon of lower energy.

So the absorbed photon has higher energy (lower wavelength) than the emitted.

Therefore, the absorbed color has a shorter wavelength than 530 nm.

So among the options, B is violet (400-440 nm), C is blue (450-495 nm).

So the absorbed color must be either violet or blue.

The question is, which one?

Well, 2.3393 eV is the energy of the emitted photon. So the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than that.

So E_abs > E_emit.

So let's compute E_abs for each option.

For Violet: let's say 400 nm.

E_violet = 1240 / 400 = 3.1 eV.

For Blue: say 450 nm.

E_blue = 1240 / 450 ≈ 2.76 eV.

So both are higher than 2.3393 eV.

So which is more likely? Oh, but the question is about the color absorbed by the organic compound.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is B) Violet.

Wait, but why would it absorb violet? Maybe it's a common absorption for dyes. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the absorption to be in the same region as the emission, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: What is the energy difference between green (530 nm, 2.34 eV) and the other options.

If the absorbed is violet (400 nm, 3.1 eV), then the energy gap is 3.1 - 2.34 = 0.76 eV.

If the absorbed is blue (450 nm, 2.76 eV), the gap is 0.42 eV.

Well, energy gaps in organic compounds can vary, but often they are in the range of a few eV. So both are possible.

But without more information, I can't be certain. So perhaps the answer is B) Violet, as that's a higher energy than green and thus a more likely absorbed wavelength.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler. Since the emitted wavelength is around 530 nm (green), the absorbed must be the complementary color, which is in the magenta region. But since the options don't have magenta, perhaps the question is expecting me to know that the absorbed color is blue or violet. And given that the options are B and C, perhaps the answer is B) Violet.

Wait, but wait. The complementary color of green is magenta, which is a combination of blue and red. But in terms of single colors, perhaps the main absorbed is in the blue region. Hmm. Or maybe the question is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is not about the complementary color but the actual absorbed wavelength. So the compound absorbs light at 2.3393 eV, which is green, but that can't be because when you absorb green, you would emit another color. Wait, no. Wait, the question states the dye emits light with that energy, so it's emitting green. Therefore, the color absorbed must be something else.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this all wrong. Let me think differently. The energy of the emitted light is 2.3393 eV, which is green. The color absorbed is the one that is not emitted. Wait, no, because when something emits light, it's because it has absorbed that light.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to approach this from another angle.

The energy level diagram: when a molecule absorbs a photon, it goes from a lower energy level (ground state) to a higher one (excited state). Then, it emits a photon when it relaxes to a lower energy level than the ground state, but perhaps not all the way down.

Wait, no. When it relaxes, it can emit a photon with energy equal to the difference between the excited state and the new lower state.

So the energy of the absorbed photon is higher than the emitted one. So if the emitted photon is at 2.3393 eV, the absorbed must be higher.

So the absorbed color must be higher energy, shorter wavelength, which would be blue or violet.

So the answer is either B or C.

But which one?

Hmm. Maybe the most common answer for this kind of question is that the absorbed color is violet. Because 2.3393 eV is green, and the absorbed is higher energy (violet).

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the use of the relationship between energy and color.

Wait, I think I remember that lower energy photons are red, and higher are violet.

So the emitted is green, so the absorbed must be higher, so violet.

So the answer is B) Violet.


To determine the color of light absorbed by the organic compound, we start by analyzing the energy of the emitted light, which is given as **2.3393 eV**. Using the relationship between energy and wavelength, \( E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h \) is Planck's constant and \( c \) is the speed of light, we can approximate the wavelength of the emitted light using the shortcut \( \lambda \approx \frac{1240}{E} \) (in nanometers when \( E \) is in eV). 

Substituting \( E = 2.3393 \, \text{eV} \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{1240}{2.3393} \approx 530 \, \text{nm}.
\]

This wavelength corresponds to green light. The compound emits green light, which means it must have absorbed a photon of higher energy (shorter wavelength) to excite an electron to a higher energy state. The absorbed photon's energy is related to the energy gap between the ground and excited states, but the exact gap is not provided. 

The absorbed photon must have a shorter wavelength than 530 nm, corresponding to higher energy. Among the options provided, violet (400–440 nm) and blue (450–495 nm) fall into this range. To decide between them, we note that the energy of the absorbed photon must be higher than 2.3393 eV. For example:

- Violet light at 400 nm corresponds to \( E \approx 3.1 \, \text{eV} \).
- Blue light at 450 nm corresponds to \( E \approx 2.76 \, \text{eV} \).

Both are valid possibilities, but violet is a higher energy and shorter wavelength, making it more likely to be absorbed by the compound. Thus, the compound absorbs violet light, which aligns with the energy gap and the typical behavior of organic dyes.
