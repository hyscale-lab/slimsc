Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) and the symmetries that its operators must respect. The question is asking which symmetries must be obeyed by all operators in SMEFT. The options are four symmetries: Lorentz Symmetry, Poincare symmetry, CP symmetry, and CPT symmetry, and I need to choose which combination is correct.

First, I should recall what each of these symmetries means and how they apply in the context of SMEFT.

Starting with Lorentz Symmetry (option 1). I remember that SMEFT is a framework that extends the Standard Model by adding higher-dimensional operators, respecting the gauge symmetries of the SM but modifying the interactions. Lorentz symmetry is fundamental because it's the symmetry of spacetime in special relativity. All terms in the Lagrangian must respect this symmetry. Operators in SMEFT are constructed as Lorentz-invariant. So Lorentz symmetry is definitely a must.

Next, Poincare symmetry (option 2). Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry plus translations. So it's a bigger symmetry group. If a theory respects Poincare symmetry, it must automatically respect Lorentz symmetry. But wait, in SMEFT, the operators are built in a way that respects the SM gauge symmetries, but I'm not sure if they all respect Poincare. Or do they? Because the SM itself is Poincare invariant. So maybe SMEFT operators, being part of the SM's effective theory, also respect Poincare. But I think that the SMEFT is constructed under the assumption that the underlying theory (like a UV complete theory) has Poincare symmetry. So operators in SMEFT should be Poincare invariant. So both Lorentz and Poincare are required. So options that include both 1 and 2 are possible.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Does SMEFT require all operators to be Poincare invariant? Because I think that the effective theory is constructed by considering all possible Lorentz-invariant operators. But Poincare includes translations, so operators would have to respect that. Wait, but the effective theory is a Lorentz-invariant theory, which is a subset of Poincare-invariant. So if all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz-invariant, they may not necessarily be Poincare-invariant, but wait, actually, the fields in the theory are constructed to transform correctly under Poincare. Hmm, perhaps I need to think again. No, wait: the SMEFT is constructed as a Lorentz-invariant theory, but does it automatically respect Poincare? Because Poincare includes translations, and the effective theory is built in a way that the Lagrangian is translation invariant, meaning it's written in a way that the equations of motion are valid everywhere. So I think that operators in SMEFT are Poincare-invariant. So both 1 and 2 must be respected.

Moving on to CP symmetry (option 3) and CPT symmetry (option4). I'm a bit fuzzy on this. CP symmetry is the combination of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P), while CPT is the combination of C, P, and T (time reversal). In the Standard Model, the SM is not CP symmetric, because processes like CP violation in the CKM matrix occur. However, in SMEFT, are the operators required to respect CP or CPT symmetry?

Wait, I remember that SMEFT allows for operators that can violate various symmetries, because the effective theory captures beyond the SM effects, which could include new sources of CP violation or others. However, the SMEFT framework itself must impose certain symmetries based on the underlying theory. Wait, perhaps the SMEFT doesn't enforce CP symmetry, because the interactions can have terms that violate it. Or does it?

But wait, the question is about what all operators must respect. For example, any physics beyond the SM in SMEFT can include terms that violate CP, but perhaps the operators themselves are not required to conserve CP. So if the question is about which symmetries must be respected by all operators, then I think that CP symmetry isn't necessarily one of them. Because in the effective theory, you can have operators that break CP. So option 3 might not be correct.

What about CPT symmetry (option4)? I remember that in quantum field theory, all theories respecting Lorentz symmetry must also respect CPT symmetry. Because the CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant QFT must have CPT symmetry. So if the operators respect Lorentz symmetry, they must also respect CPT. So number 4 is a must.

Putting it all together: the operators must respect Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). Wait, but no, wait, earlier I thought that the SMEFT requires Poincare, but I'm not certain. Let me double-check.

Wait, Poincare symmetry includes translations. The effective theory is supposed to be valid at low energies, so it's written in a way that is Lorentz invariant. But is it necessarily Poincare invariant? Because Poincare requires the theory to be invariant under spacetime translations. The effective theory is built with a Lagrangian, which is a local object, so it's translation invariant. So all the operators in the SMEFT must be Poincare-invariant. So both 1 and 2 are required.

So the required symmetries are Lorentz (1), Poincare (2), and CPT (4). So looking at the options:

Option C) 1,2,4 is correct.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C is 1,2,4. Option A is 1,2. So the correct answer would be C or A? Wait, no, if all operators must respect 1, 2, and 4, then the correct option is C.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because in the SMEFT, the operators are constructed as Lorentz-invariant. Since the Poincare symmetry includes Lorentz, but also translations. Do the operators in SMEFT necessarily have to respect Poincare symmetry? Because the theory as a whole must be Poincare-invariant, which implies that all the terms must respect it. Therefore, yes, the operators must respect both Lorentz and Poincare.

So the correct symmetries are 1,2, and 4. So option C says 1,2,4. So the answer is C.

In the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), operators are constructed to extend the Standard Model while respecting certain symmetries. The question asks which symmetries must be respected by all operators in SMEFT. Let us analyze the options:

1. **Lorentz Symmetry**: This is a fundamental symmetry of spacetime in special relativity. All terms in the Lagrangian of SMEFT must respect Lorentz symmetry, as SMEFT is built as a Lorentz-invariant effective theory. Therefore, Lorentz symmetry is required.

2. **Poincaré Symmetry**: Poincaré symmetry includes Lorentz symmetry and translations. Since SMEFT is constructed using a Lagrangian, which is inherently translation-invariant, all operators in SMEFT must respect Poincaré symmetry. Thus, Poincaré symmetry is also required.

3. **CP Symmetry**: CP symmetry combines charge conjugation (C) and parity (P). However, SMEFT allows for operators that violate CP symmetry, as it captures effects beyond the Standard Model, which can include new sources of CP violation. Therefore, CP symmetry is not necessarily required by all operators in SMEFT.

4. **CPT Symmetry**: The CPT theorem states that any Lorentz-invariant quantum field theory must respect CPT symmetry. Since SMEFT respects Lorentz symmetry, it must also respect CPT symmetry. Thus, CPT symmetry is required.

From this analysis, the symmetries that must be respected by all operators in SMEFT are Lorentz symmetry (1), Poincaré symmetry (2), and CPT symmetry (4). The correct option is **C**.
