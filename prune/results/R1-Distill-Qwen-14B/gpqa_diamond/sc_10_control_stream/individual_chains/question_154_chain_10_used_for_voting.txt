Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. The chemist found a white solid, and they've got some spectral data to help identify it. The options are four different compounds, and I need to choose which one fits the data.

First, let me look at the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, and there's another peak at 158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, so the molecular weight is 156. I know that molecular ion peaks can sometimes indicate the molecular formula, but I'm not sure about the exact formula here. The 158 peak could be a fragment or maybe an isotope. Wait, chlorine has a molecular weight of about 35.5, so if the molecule has a Cl, its isotopic peaks might show up. But 156 to 158 is a difference of 2, which could be Cl (mass 35) plus something else? Or maybe it's a doublet due to isotopes. Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula includes Cl and O. Let's think about each option's molecular weight.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let me calculate its molecular weight. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding a Cl (35.5) and another OH group? Wait, 2-hydroxy would be another OH, so formula would be C7H5ClO2? Let me compute: C=12*7=84, H=5=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. So total is 84+5=89, 89+35.5=124.5, 124.5+32=156.5. Oh, but the molecular ion is 156. Maybe that's close enough, considering rounding. So molecular weight around 156.5 could be 156, so that's possible. But wait, what about the peak at 158? That's 156 +2. Could that be a chlorine isotope? Chlorine has about 75% 35Cl and 25% 37Cl. So the molecular ion would be at 156, and the next peak would be 158 (35Cl to 37Cl?), but wait, the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Cl has a mass of 35, so the molecular weight would be 156 (assuming 35Cl). The other peak is 158, which would be if the molecule had a 37Cl instead. But wait, the intensity is 32%, which is about a third. 37Cl is about 25% abundance, so the peak at 158 is likely the M+2 peak due to Cl isotopes. So that fits. So the molecular ion is 156 (M), and the 158 is M+2 with 32%, which is roughly 25% (since Cl is 35 and 37). So that seems to fit. 

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl (35.5), molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight would be 12*7=84, H5=5, Cl=35.5, O2=32. Total: 84+5=89, 89+35.5=124.5, 124.5+32=156.5. So molecular weight 156.5, which would round to 156 as the molecular ion. The M+2 would be at 158 with about 25% intensity. That matches the data. So B is also a possibility.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. The formula for phenyl chloroformate is C6H5ClO2COCl? Wait, no. Wait, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the formula would be C6H5O2CClO? Wait, let me think. Phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So the formula is C7H5ClO2. Wait, same as the others? Let me calculate: C7H5ClO2. So molecular weight is same as A and B: 156.5. So M is 156, M+2 is 158. So that fits. So the mass data doesn't differentiate between A, B, C, and maybe D.

Wait, let's look at the other options. Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is same as B but Cl in position 2. Molecular weight same as B and others: 156.5. So mass data can't differentiate between A, B, C, D yet.

Next, the IR data. A broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. But where? The broad peak could be from an alcohol (OH) or a carboxylic acid. Wait, the IR has a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's about the carbonyl region. So 1720 is a strong peak. What functional groups have that? A carbonyl group. 

Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700-1725 cm^-1, but their O-H stretch is very broad, usually from 2500-3300. However, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be a very broad peak, but the question says a broad peak from 3500-2700. Wait, 3500-2700 is a region that includes both O-H (broad around 3000) and maybe an alcohol or maybe an aldehyde's O-H? Or perhaps an aromatic ring with something else.

Wait, another possibility: the 3500-2700 broad peak could be from an aromatic ring with substitution, but more likely, it's an O-H from a hydroxy group or maybe an aldehyde's O-H? Wait, aldehydes don't have O-H. Wait, wait. Let me think about each possibility.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That's a benzaldehyde with Cl and OH groups. So the structure is OH on C2, Cl on C3, and aldehyde on C1 (assuming numbering). So in this molecule, you have an aldehyde group (-CHO), which is a carbonyl, and a hydroxyl group (-OH). So the IR would show a strong peak for the aldehyde's carbonyl (around 1720 cm^-1) and the O-H of the phenol group would have a broad peak around 3200-3500. Wait, the IR here shows a broad peak from 3500-2700. That's a pretty broad region. Wait, if the O-H is in a phenol group, the O-H stretch is usually broader and around 3200-3600 cm^-1. But also, the aldehyde's carbonyl is around 1700-1720, which matches the IR data.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid has a carboxylic acid group. So the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid is around 1700 cm^-1. The O-H of the carboxylic acid is very strong and broad, typically from 2500-3300. But in the IR data, the broad peak is from 3500-2700, which is a bit higher than the typical O-H of a carboxylic acid. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the broad peak could be from both the O-H of the carboxylic acid and a possible alcohol, but in benzoic acid, it's just the carboxylic acid. So in that case, the IR would show a very broad O-H around 2500-3300, but the data here is a broad peak from 3500-2700. Maybe I'm missing something.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. The structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So, chloroformate has a carbonyl group (the CO part). So the carbonyl in chloroformate is usually a bit lower than a ketone, maybe around 1780-1720 cm^-1, which fits the 1720 peak. But what about the O-H? Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. There's no O-H in that structure. So why is there a broad peak in the IR? Unless I'm missing something. Wait, maybe it's a different stretching. Alternatively, perhaps the peak isn't O-H but something else. Hmm, maybe an aromatic ring with some substituent. But without an O-H, this might not fit. So the IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700. That's a region where O-H and maybe alkenes (C-H) stretch, but if it's a chloroformate, which doesn't have O-H, then maybe the broad peak is not O-H. Alternatively, maybe it's a C-O stretch? But I'm not sure. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same as B but Cl is on C2. So it's a benzoic acid with Cl on the ring. The IR would have the same as B: a strong broad O-H from the carboxylic acid (but the data seems to have a broad peak from 3500-2700; benzoic acid's O-H is a single very broad peak around 2500-3300). Hmm, perhaps the 3500-2700 is from another group.

Wait, the IR data has a broad peak in 3500-2700, which could be from an O-H group. But benzoic acid's O-H is a broad peak, but maybe in this case, the substitution affects the position? Or maybe it's a different group.

Wait, looking back, the IR also has a strong sharp peak at 1720. So that could be a carbonyl group. Let's think about each option's carbonyl.

Option A: Aldehyde group. Aldehydes have carbonyls around 1700-1720, so 1720 would fit. Also, it has a hydroxyl group (phenol), so the broad peak would come from the phenolic O-H.

Option B: Carboxylic acid. The carbonyl is around 1700, but the O-H is a broad peak lower in wavenumber. But in the IR data, the broad peak is in 3500-2700. So if the O-H is from a carboxylic acid, it's usually a broad peak in the 2500-3300 region. But here the data is 3500-2700. Maybe the peak is split or something. Alternatively, maybe the peak is from an alcohol group.

Wait, but benzoic acid doesn't have an alcohol group. So in option B, if the O-H is a carboxylic acid, why the IR shows a peak from 3500-2700, which is higher. Maybe the peak is from something else. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from somewhere else, like an aromatic C-H stretch. Wait, aromatic C-H in alkanes or alkenes can have peaks around 3000-3100, but those are usually less intense, maybe. But a broad peak in that region could be from O-H.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a hemiacetal or something else, but that's probably not the case here.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. No O-H group, so the 3500-2700 peak must be something else. But if there is no O-H, then that peak must be from another functional group. But I don't see any other O-H groups in chloroformate. Maybe it's not O-H. Wait, perhaps it's an aliphatic C-O stretch or something else. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake, and the O-H is present. Maybe the compound is something else.

Wait, another thought: the IR shows a strong sharp peak at 1720. So what's that?

Option A: Aldehyde. 1720 fits.
Option B: Carboxylic acid. The carbonyl is around 1700, but if conjugated, maybe it's higher. Benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1680-1710, I think. So 1720 could be a bit high for a benzoic acid. Unless the substituents affect it.
Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. The carbonyl in chloroformates is usually higher, around 1750-1800, but in some cases, maybe lower. But 1720 is possible. Or maybe not. Maybe that's a stretch.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H).

NMR signals at 11 ppm is very downfield. That's a strong indicator. What protons appear at 11 ppm? Typically, aldehydic protons are around 9-10 ppm, but more downfield could suggest something else. Alternatively, phenolic O-H protons can appear as singlets around 10-12 ppm. Wait, but in D2O, they usually exchange and don't show up, unless the solution is not in D2O. Alternatively, carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm as broad singlets. Wait, but the NMR here has a singlet at 11 ppm. So in option B, it's a carboxylic acid, and the -COOH proton would be a broad singlet around 12 ppm. But the integration is 1H. So for option B, the -COOH proton would be a singlet, maybe not sharp. But the NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which could be an acidic proton.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The structure has a benzaldehyde group (CHO) and a phenol (OH) group. The aldehyde proton is usually around 9.5-10.5 ppm as a triplet or singlet, depending on the substitution. Wait, but the NMR has a singlet at 11 ppm. That doesn't fit the aldehyde proton. Alternatively, the phenol O-H would appear as a broad peak around 10 ppm, but in the NMR, it's a singlet. However, in DMSO or another solvent, the O-H might not exchange and could appear as a singlet. So the 11ppm singlet might be the phenol O-H. Then, the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm. But in the NMR data, there's only a singlet at 11, no other peak. Wait, but the other signals are at 8.02 and 7.72, which are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, if the substituents are in the para position, the protons would be as two doublets. 

So for option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The structure would have the aldehyde at position 1, Cl at position 3, and OH at position 2. The aromatic protons would be in positions 4 and 5 and 6. Wait, let me draw the benzene ring. Positions 1: CHO, 2: OH, 3: Cl. Then positions 4 and 5 and 6 would have protons. The protons at positions 4 and 6 would be equivalent (para to each other) if the substituents are at 1, 2, 3. Wait, no. Let me think again. The numbering would be: 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). Then, the positions 4,5,6 have protons. But since the substituents are at 1,2,3, the ring would have symmetry. The protons in positions 4 and 6 would be equivalent. So their NMR would show a doublet for each of them, integrating to 2H each. So that would match the NMR data given: two doublets, each 2H. So that seems to fit.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure: Cl at position 4, COOH at position 1. The aromatic ring would have substituents at 1 and 4. So the protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. The protons at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent (meta to Cl and para to COOH?), and the protons at 3 and 5 would be another set. Wait, if the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl), then positions 2 and 6 are equivalent (both meta to Cl and adjacent to COOH), and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent. So their NMR would have two doublets: one for the protons adjacent to COOH and another for the others. Alternatively, in the NMR data, we have two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That would fit benzoic acid with substituents in the para position. So for 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the protons would be two doublets: the two ortho to COOH and the two meta to Cl. Or maybe the two para to Cl. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try again. If the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, then the protons at 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. Their chemical shifts would be similar. The protons at 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH and para to Cl. So in the NMR, perhaps two doublets each integrating to 2H. So that would match.

But the NMR also has a singlet at 11ppm. For benzoic acid, the COOH proton is a broad singlet around 12 ppm. However, in the NMR, it's a sharp singlet at 11, which suggests it may not be the COOH proton, unless it's deuterated or something. Alternatively, maybe the 11ppm is the O-H of the phenol, but option B doesn't have a phenol group.

Wait, but in the NMR, the singlet at 11.0 is sharp. That suggests it's not a broad O-H, which would be expected for a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the 11ppm is not from a COOH group but from an aldehyde. But aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm. So 11 is a bit higher, but possible if it's deshielded. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, like a phenolic O-H. But in that case, the O-H would be a broad peak, but in the NMR, it's a sharp singlet. So that's conflicting.

So for option B, the COOH proton is a broad singlet around 12, but in the NMR, it's a sharp singlet at 11. So that doesn't fit. 

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. The structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the aromatic ring would have the substituents. The NMR shows two doublets, each 2H, which suggests a para-substituted ring. So, if the chloroformate is attached in a para position, the ring would have two sets of protons. The phenyl group would have substituents in the para position (COCl). Wait, but the structure is O-Ph attached to COCl. So the substituents would be at the ortho and para positions relative to the O-Ph? Hmm, perhaps. Alternatively, the substituent is at a single position, making the ring have two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if the substituent is in the para position, the ring would have two doublets. So the NMR would match that. 

But what about the singlet at 11ppm? There's no O-H in chloroformate, so that must be something else. Maybe the carbonyl oxygen or something else, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from an aliphatic proton, but that doesn't fit with 11 ppm. So perhaps option C is not the right choice because the NMR doesn't explain the 11 ppm peak.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure: Cl at position 2, COOH at position 1. The aromatic ring would have substituents at 1 and 2. So the ring would have substituents in adjacent positions. The protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. Proton 3 is meta to Cl and para to COOH; proton 4 is ortho to Cl and meta to COOH; but I'm not sure about the exact equivalence. Alternatively, the protons may split into two sets, each integrating to 2H, as doublets. So the NMR would show two doublets, each 2H. That matches the data.

But again, the singlet at 11ppm. For benzoic acid, it's the COOH proton. But in the data, it's a sharp singlet. So perhaps the 11ppm is from something else, but I don't see what that would be. 

Wait, another angle: the 1H NMR has a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which integrates to 1H. So that's a single proton. The options with a single proton that appears as a singlet at 11ppm would be:

Option A: the OH group as a singlet. But in that case, it would be a broad peak, not sharp. Unless it's in a different solvent where the peak is sharp.

Option B: the COOH proton, which is usually a broad singlet, but in the NMR, it's sharp. So that doesn't fit.

Option D: same as B, the COOH proton.

Wait, another possibility: the aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. So 11 is a bit high, but maybe in a substituted benzaldehyde, it's downfield. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde or something else. So in option A, the aldehyde proton would be at 9-10, but the NMR has 11. So that's a problem. Unless the aldehyde is in a different environment.

Alternatively, maybe it's not a proton but something else. But that's unlikely.

Wait, looking back to the 1H NMR, the singlet is 1H. So what else could that be? Maybe a carbonyl oxygen, but that doesn't have a proton. Hmm.

Another thought: the peak at 11 ppm could be an acidic proton from another group. For example, a nitro group, but none of the options have that. Or perhaps a ketone, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, another possibility: the peak at 11.0 ppm is from an aromatic ring's proton in a very deshielded environment. But that's less likely. Usually, aromatic protons are in the 6.5-8.5 ppm range. So 11 is way outside that.

Wait, perhaps the peak is from a carbonyl oxygen, but that's not a proton. So that can't be. 

So, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try to tie all the data together.

Mass data: M is 156, M+2=158 with 32% (so Cl present). 

IR: broad peak 3500-2700 (O-H likely), strong peak at 1720 (carbonyl).

1H NMR: 11.0 (s, 1H), 8.02 (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H).

So for the NMR, the 11ppm is something. The doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. So the substituent(s) are in the para position. Wait, but if there are two substituents in para positions, like in a di-substituted ring, the protons would be in two sets.

Wait, let's think about the options again.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the ring would have substituents in para positions. The protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Positions 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. Positions 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. So the NMR would show two sets of doublets: maybe one at around 8 ppm and another at 7.7 ppm, which matches the data. So the two doublets would account for the 4 aromatic protons. So that fits.

But then, what's the singlet at 11ppm? For benzoic acid, it's the COOH proton. But that's usually a broad peak. However, in the NMR, it's a sharp singlet. That could be because the solution is not exchanging (maybe not in D2O) or because it's a different kind of proton. Alternatively, maybe the peak isn't from the COOH proton but from something else.

Wait, let me think about the 1H NMR of benzoic acid. The COOH proton is a broad singlet around 12 ppm. So in the given data, the peak is at 11.0, which is close. So perhaps that's the COOH proton. But in the NMR, it's a sharp peak. Hmm. Maybe the sample is not in D2O, so the O-H is exchanging and appears as a singlet. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different environment making the O-H appear as a sharp peak. I'm not sure, but maybe it's plausible.

So if I accept that, then option B's NMR would fit.

Option A: the singlet at 11 is the phenol O-H. But in the NMR, it's a sharp peak, whereas phenolic O-H is usually a broad peak. So that's conflicting.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. The structure has Cl at position 2 and COOH at position 1. The substituents are adjacent. The aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. The substituents would make the ring have two sets of doublets. The NMR data would fit, but again, the singlet at 11ppm would be the COOH proton, which is a problem.

So, considering all this, the IR has a strong peak at 1720, which fits a carbonyl. Benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1700, but if it's conjugated or something, maybe it's a bit higher. The M matches all options except for the singlet.

Wait, another possibility: the IR's broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 could be from the O-H of the carboxylic acid. But the O-H of a carboxylic acid is usually a very broad peak in 2500-3300. But the data shows a broad peak from 3500-2700, which is a lower wavenumber. Hmm, maybe the O-H is from an alcohol group instead. So maybe the compound is an alcohol, but the options don't have any except option A, which is a phenol.

Wait, but option A is a phenol (has an OH group). The IR would show a broad peak for the phenolic O-H, maybe around 3200-3600. The peak given is 3500-2700, which includes that region. So that could fit.

The IR's carbonyl at 1720 would be from the aldehyde group (CHO). So for option A, the aldehyde's carbonyl would be around 1720, which fits. The phenol O-H would be a broad peak around 3200-3600, which is within the 3500-2700 region. So that fits the IR.

The NMR for option A: the phenolic O-H would be a singlet at around 10-12 ppm. If it's a sharp singlet, that's unusual for a phenol. Phenolic O-H's are usually broad because of hydrogen bonding. Maybe in this case, the peak is sharp because it's not exchanging, or it's in a different solvent. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is not from O-H but from the aldehyde proton, which is around 10 ppm. But the aldehyde is at position 1, so the aldehyde proton would be a triplet or singlet around 10 ppm. But the NMR has 11.0, which is a bit higher. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 11 ppm is the aldehyde proton in a very deshielded environment. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's look for the 11.0 ppm singlet. If it's a proton, which one could it be.

Option B: COOH proton at 11.0.

Option A: phenol O-H at 11.0.

Option D: COOH.

Option C: no O-H, so no.

So, in option B, the COOH proton is at 11.0, which is close to where the data is. The IR has a peak at 1720, which would be from the COOH's carbonyl, but wait, no, the COOH's carbonyl is around 1700. So perhaps the 1720 peak is from another carbonyl.

Wait, option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Its carbonyl would be around 1700 cm^-1. But the IR shows 1720. So that's a problem. Because the carbonyl is 20 cm^-1 higher than expected. Maybe it's conjugated in a way that shifts it higher. If the molecule has electron-withdrawing groups, like Cl, then the carbonyl could be at a higher wavenumber. Benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1680-1700. So 1720 would be a bit higher, but possible. Alternatively, maybe it's not the carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: the IR peak at 1720 could be from an ester or a chloroformate. For example, chloroformate's carbonyl is higher, around 1750-1800. So if the peak is at 1720, that's not typical for chloroformate. So option C's carbonyl would be higher than 1720, which doesn't fit the IR.

Option A's aldehyde: 1720 would fit.

So, for the IR, if the peak is at 1720, it's likely an aldehyde. That points more towards option A.

But then, the NMR: for option A, the aldehyde proton is at 11 ppm, which is a singlet. Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. So 11 is a bit high. But perhaps in a substituted benzaldehyde, it's downfield.

Alternatively, let's think about the NMR shifts. The aldehyde proton is deshielded, giving a high ppm. If the ring is electron-withdrawing, which it is with Cl and OH substituents, that could cause the aldehyde proton to shift downfield. So, in option A, the aldehyde is at position 1, adjacent to the OH at position 2 and Cl at position 3. The ring's electron-withdrawing groups could deshield the aldehyde proton, causing it to appear downfield at 11 ppm.

So, the aldehyde proton in option A would be a sharp singlet at 11 ppm. That would fit the NMR data. The other aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the data.

Wait, but in option A, the structure is:

CHO
|
O
Cl
|
Benzene ring

Wait, no. The structure is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So the benzaldehyde is at position 1, OH at position 2, Cl at position 3.

In that case, the aldehyde is at position 1, with substituents at 2 and 3. So the aldehyde proton would be influenced by the substituents. The presence of the OH and Cl groups adjacent would deshield it, causing it to shift downfield. So the aldehyde proton would appear at 11 ppm as a singlet. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually singlets? Or are they split based on coupling? In benzaldehyde, the aldehyde proton is a singlet because it's coupled with no other protons (as it's at the end of the chain). So in this case, it would be a singlet.

So in the NMR, the aldehyde proton would be a singlet at around 10-11 ppm. The data has a sharp singlet at 11.0, which fits. 

The other aromatic protons would be at positions 4,5,6. Since substituents are at 1,2,3, the remaining protons are at 4,5,6. The substituents at 1,2,3 would cause the ring to have two sets of equivalent protons: positions 4 and 6 (meta to Cl and para to OH) would be one set, and position 5 would be another. Wait, no, because substituents are at 1,2,3, the ring would have protons at 4,5,6. Proton 4 is adjacent to substituent 3 (Cl) and proton 5 is adjacent to substituent 2 (OH). Hmm, perhaps the protons at 4 and 6 are equivalent, and the proton at 5 is not. But that would give three distinct protons, which doesn't match the NMR data which has two doublets of 2H each.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused about the substitution pattern. Let me try to sketch it out:

Positions:

1: CHO
2: OH
3: Cl
4: H
5: H
6: H

Wait, no. Benzoic aldehyde has substituents at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). So the ring would have substituents at positions 1,2,3. That leaves positions 4,5,6. Are any of these equivalent?

In such a case, the ring would be meta-substituted, but I'm not sure about the symmetry. Wait, if substituents are at 1,2,3, then positions 4,5,6 would each have a unique environment. So the NMR would have three distinct signals for the aromatic protons. But the data shows only two signals, each integrating to 2H. So that doesn't fit. So option A's NMR would have three sets of protons, not two. But the data shows two sets. So that's a problem. So option A might not be the correct answer.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the substitution pattern. Let me think again. If the substituents are at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl), then the ring doesn't have any symmetry. So each of the remaining positions (4,5,6) would have unique environments, leading to three distinct signals. But the NMR data has two, each integrating to 2H. So that doesn't fit. Therefore, option A might not be the correct choice.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try another angle. Let's look at the options again.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

The structure has substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the ring is para-substituted. The aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Positions 2 and 6 are equivalent (both ortho to COOH and meta to Cl), and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent (both meta to COOH and ortho to Cl). So each pair would show up as a doublet in the NMR, integrating to 2H each. That matches the NMR data. 

The 11.0 ppm singlet would be the COOH proton. But as I thought earlier, that doesn't fit because the COOH proton is usually a broad peak. The IR data has a strong peak at 1720, which would correspond to the COOH carbonyl. But wait, the COOH carbonyl is typically around 1700, so 1720 is a bit high. Maybe because Cl is a para-substituent, it could cause a slight shift. Alternatively, perhaps it's not the COOH carbonyl but something else.

Alternatively, the IR could have another carbonyl. Let me think, if the compound were a chloroformate, the carbonyl would be higher, but option B doesn't have that.

Wait, another possibility: the IR peak at 1720 is from a conjugated carbonyl. If the COOH group is conjugated with the Cl, could that shift the carbonyl peak higher?

Alternatively, maybe the IR is showing the O-H of the COOH, but that's usually in the 2500-3300 region. But the IR's broad peak is from 3500-2700, which is lower. Hmm, that's conflicting.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but let's try to think about the possible structures again.

The NMR data:

- 11.0 ppm (s,1H): possibly the COOH proton (option B), aldehyde proton (option A), or something else.

- 8.02 and 7.72 (each d, 2H): indicates a para-substituted ring.

So for para-substituted rings, the aromatic protons are split into two sets, each integrating to 2H. So that matches options B and D (if their structures have para-substituted rings).

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Substituents at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So the ring is ortho-substituted. The aromatic protons would not be in two sets of 2H each. Instead, they would be three sets: perhaps two doublets and a triplet, but I'm not sure. So the NMR data doesn't fit option D as well.

So, option B's aromatic protons fit the NMR data.

Now, let's think about the IR. If the 1720 peak is from the COOH group, it's a bit high but possible. The broad peak in IR from 3500-2700 would be the O-H of the COOH group. But why is the O-H peak in that region? Because COOH's O-H is usually a very broad peak around 2500-3300. But the data shows a broad peak from 3500-2700, which is a lower wavenumber. That's a bit conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak is from an alcohol group, like in option A. But option B doesn't have a phenol group.

Wait, maybe the broad peak is from another group. Let me think about option C: phenyl chloroformate. The structure would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. The IR would show the carbonyl at around 1720, which fits. But where is the broad peak from 3500-2700? There's no O-H in chloroformate, so that can't be. Unless the broad peak is from something else, like C-O stretching, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: in chloroformate, the O-Ph group could have C-O stretching, which typically appears around 1250-1050 cm^-1. So that's not in the 3500-2700 region. So the IR data's broad peak can't be explained by option C.

So back to option B: the IR's broad peak from 3500-2700 is the O-H of the COOH group. The fact that it's broad and in that region makes sense. The 1720 peak is the carbonyl, but why is it at 1720 when COOH is usually around 1700? Maybe the substituent (Cl) is causing a slight upshift. Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, which would strengthen the carbonyl bond, leading to a higher wavenumber. So 1720 could make sense.

The NMR's 11ppm peak would be the COOH proton as a sharp singlet. But that's conflicting because COOH protons are usually broad. Unless the sample is not exchanged in D2O, but in most cases, the O-H proton would be a broad peak.

Wait, another thought: in the NMR, if the solution is not in D2O, the COOH proton would appear as a broad peak. But if the sample is in D2O, the O-H would be exchanged and not show up. But in the NMR data, it's a sharp singlet. So perhaps the sample isn't deuterated, so the O-H is visible but appears as a sharp peak. I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is not from the COOH group but from a different proton, but I can't think of what that would be.

So, considering all the data, the IR and NMR seem to fit option B, except for the O-H peak in the NMR. But maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, let's think about option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. The substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). The aromatic protons would be in positions 3,4,5,6. The protons at 3 and 5 would be equivalent (both meta to Cl and adjacent to COOH), and protons 4 and 6 would be another set. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That matches the data.

The 11ppm peak would be the COOH proton. But again, the issue is whether it's a sharp singlet. 

The IR: the COOH group would have a carbonyl around 1700 and an O-H around 2500-3300. The given IR has a peak at 1720 (which is a bit high), and a broad peak from 3500-2700. So the O-H would be in the correct region, but the carbonyl is a bit high.

So, considering all, maybe option B is more likely because the NMR's aromatic protons fit better. Also, the molecular weight and M+2 peak fit all options, so that can't differentiate.

Another point: the IR's strong peak at 1720 could be from an ester or a ketone. But none of the options are esters or ketones.

Wait, let me think about the 1H NMR for option B. The singlet at 11 could be the COOH proton. But if it's a sharp peak, that's unusual. So perhaps the 11ppm is from another group.

Wait, another possibility: the 11ppm peak is from an acidic aliphatic proton, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from a carbonyl group, but that's not a proton.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck between options B and A. Let me try to think about the IR again.

Option A: the IR has a strong peak at 1720 (aldehyde carbonyl) and a broad peak from 3500-2700 (phenol O-H). That would fit. The NMR for option A would have the aldehyde as a singlet at 11ppm, which is a bit high but plausible. However, the aromatic protons would have three signals, which doesn't fit the data.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate the aromatic protons in option A. If the substituents are at 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl), what about the symmetry?

The ring would have substituents at 1,2,3. So the remaining positions are 4,5,6. Are any of these positions equivalent?

Position 4: between 3 (Cl) and 5 (H)
Position 5: between 4 (H) and 6 (H)
Position 6: between 5 (H) and 1 (CHO)

Wait, perhaps positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. So the NMR would have three distinct signals, but the data has two. So that doesn't fit.

Thus, option A is unlikely because the aromatic protons don't match.

So, going back, the only option that fits the aromatic proton NMR data is option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and option D (if the substitution allows two doublets).

Wait, option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure has Cl at position 2, COOH at 1. The aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6.

Positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent (both meta to Cl and adjacent to COOH), and positions 4 and 6 would be another set (ortho to Cl and meta to COOH). So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That matches the data.

So option D's aromatic protons fit.

The 11ppm peak would be the COOH proton, which is a singlet. But again, the issue is the sharpness.

So, IR:

Option D: COOH's carbonyl at around 1700. The IR shows 1720, which is a bit high.

The O-H in the IR would be in the 2500-3300 region, but the data shows a broad peak from 3500-2700. Hmm, conflicting.

So, considering all, perhaps the best fit is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

But I'm still not entirely confident because of the NMR's 11ppm peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the 11ppm peak is not the COOH proton but something else. Wait, another possibility: the 11ppm could be an aliphatic chlorine, but no, Cl doesn't have protons.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let's try to go through the options again:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

- Mass: M=156, M+2=158 → fits.

- IR: strong peak at 1720 → maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

- Broad peak from 3500-2700 → O-H of COOH.

- NMR: 11.0 (s,1H) → COOH proton. But expected to be broad, but in the data it's sharp.

- Aromatic protons: two doublets → fits.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

- Mass: same.

- IR: same.

- NMR: fits aromatic protons, same as B.

But the O-H and carbonyl regions are same issues.

Wait, maybe the 11ppm is from a different group, like a nitro group, but none of the options have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the 11ppm is from an aliphatic proton that's highly deshielded. But I can't think of any.

At this point, I think the best fit is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Because the aromatic protons match, and the other data can be explained with some assumptions.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data and comparing it to four options: **3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (A)**, **4-chlorobenzoic acid (B)**, **Phenyl chloroformate (C)**, and **2-chlorobenzoic acid (D)**. The analysis proceeds as follows:

---

### **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**
- Molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** and a fragment peak at **m/z = 158 (32%)** suggest a molecular weight of 156 with a chlorine atom (Cl), as the M+2 peak corresponds to the isotopic abundance of chlorine (37Cl).

---

### **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**
- **Broad peak from 3500–2700 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or phenol.
- **Strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid or aldehyde.

---

### **1H NMR Spectroscopy:**
- **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: A sharp singlet, likely from a proton in a highly deshielded environment, such as a carboxylic acid or phenol O-H.
- **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicative of a **para-substituted aromatic ring**.

---

### **Analysis of Each Option:**

#### **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**
- **Structure**: CHO at position 1, OH at position 2, Cl at position 3.
- **Mass**: Fits (C₇H₅ClO₂, molecular weight ~156.5).
- **IR**: The aldehyde carbonyl (~1720 cm⁻¹) and phenol O-H (broad peak) are consistent.
- **NMR**: 
  - The aldehyde proton (~9–10 ppm) is unusually downfield at 11.0 ppm, which is plausible due to deshielding from adjacent electron-withdrawing groups.
  - However, the aromatic protons would not produce two doublets (each integrating to 2H), as the substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3 disrupt symmetry, leading to three distinct aromatic signals. This conflicts with the NMR data.
- **Conclusion**: Does not fit the NMR data.

---

#### **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic Acid**
- **Structure**: COOH at position 1, Cl at position 4.
- **Mass**: Fits (C₇H₅ClO₂, molecular weight ~156.5).
- **IR**: 
  - The carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is slightly higher than typical for a carboxylic acid (~1700 cm⁻¹), but this could be due to conjugation with the chlorine atom.
  - The broad peak from 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carboxylic acid O-H stretch.
- **NMR**: 
  - The sharp singlet at 11.0 ppm matches the carboxylic acid proton, though carboxylic acid protons are typically broad. This discrepancy could be due to the sample not being exchanged in D₂O.
  - The aromatic protons at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm (each integrating to 2H) match the para-substituted aromatic ring pattern.
- **Conclusion**: Fits the data well.

---

#### **Option C: Phenyl Chloroformate**
- **Structure**: Cl-CO-O-Ph.
- **Mass**: Fits (C₇H₅ClO₂, molecular weight ~156.5).
- **IR**: 
  - The carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a chloroformate.
  - However, there is no O-H group in this structure to account for the broad peak from 3500–2700 cm⁻¹.
- **NMR**: 
  - The absence of an O-H group makes it impossible to explain the sharp singlet at 11.0 ppm.
  - The aromatic protons would not produce two doublets (each integrating to 2H), as the substitution pattern does not allow for such symmetry.
- **Conclusion**: Does not fit the data.

---

#### **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic Acid**
- **Structure**: COOH at position 1, Cl at position 2.
- **Mass**: Fits (C₇H₅ClO₂, molecular weight ~156.5).
- **IR**: 
  - The carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is slightly higher than typical for a carboxylic acid (~1700 cm⁻¹), but this could be due to conjugation with the chlorine atom.
  - The broad peak from 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carboxylic acid O-H stretch.
- **NMR**: 
  - The sharp singlet at 11.0 ppm matches the carboxylic acid proton, though carboxylic acid protons are typically broad. This discrepancy could be due to the sample not being exchanged in D₂O.
  - The aromatic protons would not produce two doublets (each integrating to 2H), as the substitution pattern does not allow for such symmetry.
- **Conclusion**: Does not fit the NMR data.

---

### **Final Conclusion:**
Option **B (4-chlorobenzoic acid)** best fits the spectral data. The mass, IR, and NMR data are consistent with the structure, despite minor discrepancies in the sharpness of the COOH proton peak in the NMR.

**Answer: B**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is about. The chemist found a white solid, and they've got some spectral data to help identify it. The options are four different compounds, and I need to choose which one fits the data.

First, let me look at the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156, and there's another peak at 158 with 32% intensity. Hmm, so the molecular weight is 156. I know that molecular ion peaks can sometimes indicate the molecular formula, but I'm not sure about the exact formula here. The 158 peak could be a fragment or maybe an isotope. Wait, chlorine has a molecular weight of about 35.5, so if the molecule has a Cl, its isotopic peaks might show up. But 156 to 158 is a difference of 2, which could be Cl (mass 35) plus something else? Or maybe it's a doublet due to isotopes. Alternatively, maybe the molecular formula includes Cl and O. Let's think about each option's molecular weight.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let me calculate its molecular weight. Benzaldehyde is C7H6O. Adding a Cl (35.5) and another OH group? Wait, 2-hydroxy would be another OH, so formula would be C7H5ClO2? Let me compute: C=12*7=84, H=5=5, Cl=35.5, O=16*2=32. So total is 84+5=89, 89+35.5=124.5, 124.5+32=156.5. Oh, but the molecular ion is 156. Maybe that's close enough, considering rounding. So molecular weight around 156.5 could be 156, so that's possible. But wait, what about the peak at 158? That's 156 +2. Could that be a chlorine isotope? Chlorine has about 75% 35Cl and 25% 37Cl. So the molecular ion would be at 156, and the next peak would be 158 (35Cl to 37Cl?), but wait, the molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Cl has a mass of 35, so the molecular weight would be 156 (assuming 35Cl). The other peak is 158, which would be if the molecule had a 37Cl instead. But wait, the intensity is 32%, which is about a third. 37Cl is about 25% abundance, so the peak at 158 is likely the M+2 peak due to Cl isotopes. So that fits. So the molecular ion is 156 (M), and the 158 is M+2 with 32%, which is roughly 25% (since Cl is 35 and 37). So that seems to fit. 

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Adding Cl (35.5), molecular formula is C7H5ClO2. Molecular weight would be 12*7=84, H5=5, Cl=35.5, O2=32. Total: 84+5=89, 89+35.5=124.5, 124.5+32=156.5. So molecular weight 156.5, which would round to 156 as the molecular ion. The M+2 would be at 158 with about 25% intensity. That matches the data. So B is also a possibility.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. The formula for phenyl chloroformate is C6H5ClO2COCl? Wait, no. Wait, chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the formula would be C6H5O2CClO? Wait, let me think. Phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So the formula is C7H5ClO2. Wait, same as the others? Let me calculate: C7H5ClO2. So molecular weight is same as A and B: 156.5. So M is 156, M+2 is 158. So that fits. So the mass data doesn't differentiate between A, B, C, and maybe D.

Wait, let's look at the other options. Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Formula is same as B but Cl in position 2. Molecular weight same as B and others: 156.5. So mass data can't differentiate between A, B, C, D yet.

Next, the IR data. A broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H stretching. But where? The broad peak could be from an alcohol (OH) or a carboxylic acid. Wait, the IR has a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That's about the carbonyl region. So 1720 is a strong peak. What functional groups have that? A carbonyl group. 

Carboxylic acids have a carbonyl around 1700-1725 cm^-1, but their O-H stretch is very broad, usually from 2500-3300. However, if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be a very broad peak, but the question says a broad peak from 3500-2700. Wait, 3500-2700 is a region that includes both O-H (broad around 3000) and maybe an alcohol or maybe an aldehyde's O-H? Or perhaps an aromatic ring with something else.

Wait, another possibility: the 3500-2700 broad peak could be from an aromatic ring with substitution, but more likely, it's an O-H from a hydroxy group or maybe an aldehyde's O-H? Wait, aldehydes don't have O-H. Wait, wait. Let me think about each possibility.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. That's a benzaldehyde with Cl and OH groups. So the structure is OH on C2, Cl on C3, and aldehyde on C1 (assuming numbering). So in this molecule, you have an aldehyde group (-CHO), which is a carbonyl, and a hydroxyl group (-OH). So the IR would show a strong peak for the aldehyde's carbonyl (around 1720 cm^-1) and the O-H of the phenol group would have a broad peak around 3200-3500. Wait, the IR here shows a broad peak from 3500-2700. That's a pretty broad region. Wait, if the O-H is in a phenol group, the O-H stretch is usually broader and around 3200-3600 cm^-1. But also, the aldehyde's carbonyl is around 1700-1720, which matches the IR data.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Benzoic acid has a carboxylic acid group. So the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid is around 1700 cm^-1. The O-H of the carboxylic acid is very strong and broad, typically from 2500-3300. But in the IR data, the broad peak is from 3500-2700, which is a bit higher than the typical O-H of a carboxylic acid. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the broad peak could be from both the O-H of the carboxylic acid and a possible alcohol, but in benzoic acid, it's just the carboxylic acid. So in that case, the IR would show a very broad O-H around 2500-3300, but the data here is a broad peak from 3500-2700. Maybe I'm missing something.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. The structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So, chloroformate has a carbonyl group (the CO part). So the carbonyl in chloroformate is usually a bit lower than a ketone, maybe around 1780-1720 cm^-1, which fits the 1720 peak. But what about the O-H? Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. There's no O-H in that structure. So why is there a broad peak in the IR? Unless I'm missing something. Wait, maybe it's a different stretching. Alternatively, perhaps the peak isn't O-H but something else. Hmm, maybe an aromatic ring with some substituent. But without an O-H, this might not fit. So the IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700. That's a region where O-H and maybe alkenes (C-H) stretch, but if it's a chloroformate, which doesn't have O-H, then maybe the broad peak is not O-H. Alternatively, maybe it's a C-O stretch? But I'm not sure. Maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Same as B but Cl is on C2. So it's a benzoic acid with Cl on the ring. The IR would have the same as B: a strong broad O-H from the carboxylic acid (but the data seems to have a broad peak from 3500-2700; benzoic acid's O-H is a single very broad peak around 2500-3300). Hmm, perhaps the 3500-2700 is from another group.

Wait, the IR data has a broad peak in 3500-2700, which could be from an O-H group. But benzoic acid's O-H is a broad peak, but maybe in this case, the substitution affects the position? Or maybe it's a different group.

Wait, looking back, the IR also has a strong sharp peak at 1720. So that could be a carbonyl group. Let's think about each option's carbonyl.

Option A: Aldehyde group. Aldehydes have carbonyls around 1700-1720, so 1720 would fit. Also, it has a hydroxyl group (phenol), so the broad peak would come from the phenolic O-H.

Option B: Carboxylic acid. The carbonyl is around 1700, but the O-H is a broad peak lower in wavenumber. But in the IR data, the broad peak is in 3500-2700. So if the O-H is from a carboxylic acid, it's usually a broad peak in the 2500-3300 region. But here the data is 3500-2700. Maybe the peak is split or something. Alternatively, maybe the peak is from an alcohol group.

Wait, but benzoic acid doesn't have an alcohol group. So in option B, if the O-H is a carboxylic acid, why the IR shows a peak from 3500-2700, which is higher. Maybe the peak is from something else. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from somewhere else, like an aromatic C-H stretch. Wait, aromatic C-H in alkanes or alkenes can have peaks around 3000-3100, but those are usually less intense, maybe. But a broad peak in that region could be from O-H.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a hemiacetal or something else, but that's probably not the case here.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. No O-H group, so the 3500-2700 peak must be something else. But if there is no O-H, then that peak must be from another functional group. But I don't see any other O-H groups in chloroformate. Maybe it's not O-H. Wait, perhaps it's an aliphatic C-O stretch or something else. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's a mistake, and the O-H is present. Maybe the compound is something else.

Wait, another thought: the IR shows a strong sharp peak at 1720. So what's that?

Option A: Aldehyde. 1720 fits.
Option B: Carboxylic acid. The carbonyl is around 1700, but if conjugated, maybe it's higher. Benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1680-1710, I think. So 1720 could be a bit high for a benzoic acid. Unless the substituents affect it.
Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. The carbonyl in chloroformates is usually higher, around 1750-1800, but in some cases, maybe lower. But 1720 is possible. Or maybe not. Maybe that's a stretch.

Looking at the 1H NMR data: 11.0 ppm (s, 1H), 8.02 ppm (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H).

NMR signals at 11 ppm is very downfield. That's a strong indicator. What protons appear at 11 ppm? Typically, aldehydic protons are around 9-10 ppm, but more downfield could suggest something else. Alternatively, phenolic O-H protons can appear as singlets around 10-12 ppm. Wait, but in D2O, they usually exchange and don't show up, unless the solution is not in D2O. Alternatively, carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm as broad singlets. Wait, but the NMR here has a singlet at 11 ppm. So in option B, it's a carboxylic acid, and the -COOH proton would be a broad singlet around 12 ppm. But the integration is 1H. So for option B, the -COOH proton would be a singlet, maybe not sharp. But the NMR shows a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which could be an acidic proton.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The structure has a benzaldehyde group (CHO) and a phenol (OH) group. The aldehyde proton is usually around 9.5-10.5 ppm as a triplet or singlet, depending on the substitution. Wait, but the NMR has a singlet at 11 ppm. That doesn't fit the aldehyde proton. Alternatively, the phenol O-H would appear as a broad peak around 10 ppm, but in the NMR, it's a singlet. However, in DMSO or another solvent, the O-H might not exchange and could appear as a singlet. So the 11ppm singlet might be the phenol O-H. Then, the aldehyde proton would be around 9-10 ppm. But in the NMR data, there's only a singlet at 11, no other peak. Wait, but the other signals are at 8.02 and 7.72, which are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. For example, if the substituents are in the para position, the protons would be as two doublets. 

So for option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. The structure would have the aldehyde at position 1, Cl at position 3, and OH at position 2. The aromatic protons would be in positions 4 and 5 and 6. Wait, let me draw the benzene ring. Positions 1: CHO, 2: OH, 3: Cl. Then positions 4 and 5 and 6 would have protons. The protons at positions 4 and 6 would be equivalent (para to each other) if the substituents are at 1, 2, 3. Wait, no. Let me think again. The numbering would be: 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). Then, the positions 4,5,6 have protons. But since the substituents are at 1,2,3, the ring would have symmetry. The protons in positions 4 and 6 would be equivalent. So their NMR would show a doublet for each of them, integrating to 2H each. So that would match the NMR data given: two doublets, each 2H. So that seems to fit.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure: Cl at position 4, COOH at position 1. The aromatic ring would have substituents at 1 and 4. So the protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. The protons at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent (meta to Cl and para to COOH?), and the protons at 3 and 5 would be another set. Wait, if the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl), then positions 2 and 6 are equivalent (both meta to Cl and adjacent to COOH), and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent. So their NMR would have two doublets: one for the protons adjacent to COOH and another for the others. Alternatively, in the NMR data, we have two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That would fit benzoic acid with substituents in the para position. So for 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the protons would be two doublets: the two ortho to COOH and the two meta to Cl. Or maybe the two para to Cl. Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me try again. If the substituents are at positions 1 and 4, then the protons at 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. Their chemical shifts would be similar. The protons at 3 and 5 would be meta to COOH and para to Cl. So in the NMR, perhaps two doublets each integrating to 2H. So that would match.

But the NMR also has a singlet at 11ppm. For benzoic acid, the COOH proton is a broad singlet around 12 ppm. However, in the NMR, it's a sharp singlet at 11, which suggests it may not be the COOH proton, unless it's deuterated or something. Alternatively, maybe the 11ppm is the O-H of the phenol, but option B doesn't have a phenol group.

Wait, but in the NMR, the singlet at 11.0 is sharp. That suggests it's not a broad O-H, which would be expected for a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the 11ppm is not from a COOH group but from an aldehyde. But aldehyde protons are around 9-10 ppm. So 11 is a bit higher, but possible if it's deshielded. Alternatively, maybe it's an acidic proton, like a phenolic O-H. But in that case, the O-H would be a broad peak, but in the NMR, it's a sharp singlet. So that's conflicting.

So for option B, the COOH proton is a broad singlet around 12, but in the NMR, it's a sharp singlet at 11. So that doesn't fit. 

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. The structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the aromatic ring would have the substituents. The NMR shows two doublets, each 2H, which suggests a para-substituted ring. So, if the chloroformate is attached in a para position, the ring would have two sets of protons. The phenyl group would have substituents in the para position (COCl). Wait, but the structure is O-Ph attached to COCl. So the substituents would be at the ortho and para positions relative to the O-Ph? Hmm, perhaps. Alternatively, the substituent is at a single position, making the ring have two sets of equivalent protons. For example, if the substituent is in the para position, the ring would have two doublets. So the NMR would match that. 

But what about the singlet at 11ppm? There's no O-H in chloroformate, so that must be something else. Maybe the carbonyl oxygen or something else, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from an aliphatic proton, but that doesn't fit with 11 ppm. So perhaps option C is not the right choice because the NMR doesn't explain the 11 ppm peak.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure: Cl at position 2, COOH at position 1. The aromatic ring would have substituents at 1 and 2. So the ring would have substituents in adjacent positions. The protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. Proton 3 is meta to Cl and para to COOH; proton 4 is ortho to Cl and meta to COOH; but I'm not sure about the exact equivalence. Alternatively, the protons may split into two sets, each integrating to 2H, as doublets. So the NMR would show two doublets, each 2H. That matches the data.

But again, the singlet at 11ppm. For benzoic acid, it's the COOH proton. But in the data, it's a sharp singlet. So perhaps the 11ppm is from something else, but I don't see what that would be. 

Wait, another angle: the 1H NMR has a singlet at 11.0 ppm, which integrates to 1H. So that's a single proton. The options with a single proton that appears as a singlet at 11ppm would be:

Option A: the OH group as a singlet. But in that case, it would be a broad peak, not sharp. Unless it's in a different solvent where the peak is sharp.

Option B: the COOH proton, which is usually a broad singlet, but in the NMR, it's sharp. So that doesn't fit.

Option D: same as B, the COOH proton.

Wait, another possibility: the aldehyde proton. Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. So 11 is a bit high, but maybe in a substituted benzaldehyde, it's downfield. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated aldehyde or something else. So in option A, the aldehyde proton would be at 9-10, but the NMR has 11. So that's a problem. Unless the aldehyde is in a different environment.

Alternatively, maybe it's not a proton but something else. But that's unlikely.

Wait, looking back to the 1H NMR, the singlet is 1H. So what else could that be? Maybe a carbonyl oxygen, but that doesn't have a proton. Hmm.

Another thought: the peak at 11 ppm could be an acidic proton from another group. For example, a nitro group, but none of the options have that. Or perhaps a ketone, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, another possibility: the peak at 11.0 ppm is from an aromatic ring's proton in a very deshielded environment. But that's less likely. Usually, aromatic protons are in the 6.5-8.5 ppm range. So 11 is way outside that.

Wait, perhaps the peak is from a carbonyl oxygen, but that's not a proton. So that can't be. 

So, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try to tie all the data together.

Mass data: M is 156, M+2=158 with 32% (so Cl present). 

IR: broad peak 3500-2700 (O-H likely), strong peak at 1720 (carbonyl).

1H NMR: 11.0 (s, 1H), 8.02 (d, 2H), 7.72 (d, 2H).

So for the NMR, the 11ppm is something. The doublets at 8.02 and 7.72 suggest a para-substituted aromatic ring. So the substituent(s) are in the para position. Wait, but if there are two substituents in para positions, like in a di-substituted ring, the protons would be in two sets.

Wait, let's think about the options again.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the ring would have substituents in para positions. The protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Positions 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. Positions 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. So the NMR would show two sets of doublets: maybe one at around 8 ppm and another at 7.7 ppm, which matches the data. So the two doublets would account for the 4 aromatic protons. So that fits.

But then, what's the singlet at 11ppm? For benzoic acid, it's the COOH proton. But that's usually a broad peak. However, in the NMR, it's a sharp singlet. That could be because the solution is not exchanging (maybe not in D2O) or because it's a different kind of proton. Alternatively, maybe the peak isn't from the COOH proton but from something else.

Wait, let me think about the 1H NMR of benzoic acid. The COOH proton is a broad singlet around 12 ppm. So in the given data, the peak is at 11.0, which is close. So perhaps that's the COOH proton. But in the NMR, it's a sharp peak. Hmm. Maybe the sample is not in D2O, so the O-H is exchanging and appears as a singlet. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different environment making the O-H appear as a sharp peak. I'm not sure, but maybe it's plausible.

So if I accept that, then option B's NMR would fit.

Option A: the singlet at 11 is the phenol O-H. But in the NMR, it's a sharp peak, whereas phenolic O-H is usually a broad peak. So that's conflicting.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. The structure has Cl at position 2 and COOH at position 1. The substituents are adjacent. The aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6. The substituents would make the ring have two sets of doublets. The NMR data would fit, but again, the singlet at 11ppm would be the COOH proton, which is a problem.

So, considering all this, the IR has a strong peak at 1720, which fits a carbonyl. Benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1700, but if it's conjugated or something, maybe it's a bit higher. The M matches all options except for the singlet.

Wait, another possibility: the IR's broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 could be from the O-H of the carboxylic acid. But the O-H of a carboxylic acid is usually a very broad peak in 2500-3300. But the data shows a broad peak from 3500-2700, which is a lower wavenumber. Hmm, maybe the O-H is from an alcohol group instead. So maybe the compound is an alcohol, but the options don't have any except option A, which is a phenol.

Wait, but option A is a phenol (has an OH group). The IR would show a broad peak for the phenolic O-H, maybe around 3200-3600. The peak given is 3500-2700, which includes that region. So that could fit.

The IR's carbonyl at 1720 would be from the aldehyde group (CHO). So for option A, the aldehyde's carbonyl would be around 1720, which fits. The phenol O-H would be a broad peak around 3200-3600, which is within the 3500-2700 region. So that fits the IR.

The NMR for option A: the phenolic O-H would be a singlet at around 10-12 ppm. If it's a sharp singlet, that's unusual for a phenol. Phenolic O-H's are usually broad because of hydrogen bonding. Maybe in this case, the peak is sharp because it's not exchanging, or it's in a different solvent. Alternatively, perhaps the peak is not from O-H but from the aldehyde proton, which is around 10 ppm. But the aldehyde is at position 1, so the aldehyde proton would be a triplet or singlet around 10 ppm. But the NMR has 11.0, which is a bit higher. 

Alternatively, perhaps the 11 ppm is the aldehyde proton in a very deshielded environment. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: let's look for the 11.0 ppm singlet. If it's a proton, which one could it be.

Option B: COOH proton at 11.0.

Option A: phenol O-H at 11.0.

Option D: COOH.

Option C: no O-H, so no.

So, in option B, the COOH proton is at 11.0, which is close to where the data is. The IR has a peak at 1720, which would be from the COOH's carbonyl, but wait, no, the COOH's carbonyl is around 1700. So perhaps the 1720 peak is from another carbonyl.

Wait, option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Its carbonyl would be around 1700 cm^-1. But the IR shows 1720. So that's a problem. Because the carbonyl is 20 cm^-1 higher than expected. Maybe it's conjugated in a way that shifts it higher. If the molecule has electron-withdrawing groups, like Cl, then the carbonyl could be at a higher wavenumber. Benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1680-1700. So 1720 would be a bit higher, but possible. Alternatively, maybe it's not the carbonyl.

Wait, another possibility: the IR peak at 1720 could be from an ester or a chloroformate. For example, chloroformate's carbonyl is higher, around 1750-1800. So if the peak is at 1720, that's not typical for chloroformate. So option C's carbonyl would be higher than 1720, which doesn't fit the IR.

Option A's aldehyde: 1720 would fit.

So, for the IR, if the peak is at 1720, it's likely an aldehyde. That points more towards option A.

But then, the NMR: for option A, the aldehyde proton is at 11 ppm, which is a singlet. Aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. So 11 is a bit high. But perhaps in a substituted benzaldehyde, it's downfield.

Alternatively, let's think about the NMR shifts. The aldehyde proton is deshielded, giving a high ppm. If the ring is electron-withdrawing, which it is with Cl and OH substituents, that could cause the aldehyde proton to shift downfield. So, in option A, the aldehyde is at position 1, adjacent to the OH at position 2 and Cl at position 3. The ring's electron-withdrawing groups could deshield the aldehyde proton, causing it to appear downfield at 11 ppm.

So, the aldehyde proton in option A would be a sharp singlet at 11 ppm. That would fit the NMR data. The other aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H, which matches the data.

Wait, but in option A, the structure is:

CHO
|
O
Cl
|
Benzene ring

Wait, no. The structure is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So the benzaldehyde is at position 1, OH at position 2, Cl at position 3.

In that case, the aldehyde is at position 1, with substituents at 2 and 3. So the aldehyde proton would be influenced by the substituents. The presence of the OH and Cl groups adjacent would deshield it, causing it to shift downfield. So the aldehyde proton would appear at 11 ppm as a singlet. But wait, aldehyde protons are usually singlets? Or are they split based on coupling? In benzaldehyde, the aldehyde proton is a singlet because it's coupled with no other protons (as it's at the end of the chain). So in this case, it would be a singlet.

So in the NMR, the aldehyde proton would be a singlet at around 10-11 ppm. The data has a sharp singlet at 11.0, which fits. 

The other aromatic protons would be at positions 4,5,6. Since substituents are at 1,2,3, the remaining protons are at 4,5,6. The substituents at 1,2,3 would cause the ring to have two sets of equivalent protons: positions 4 and 6 (meta to Cl and para to OH) would be one set, and position 5 would be another. Wait, no, because substituents are at 1,2,3, the ring would have protons at 4,5,6. Proton 4 is adjacent to substituent 3 (Cl) and proton 5 is adjacent to substituent 2 (OH). Hmm, perhaps the protons at 4 and 6 are equivalent, and the proton at 5 is not. But that would give three distinct protons, which doesn't match the NMR data which has two doublets of 2H each.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused about the substitution pattern. Let me try to sketch it out:

Positions:

1: CHO
2: OH
3: Cl
4: H
5: H
6: H

Wait, no. Benzoic aldehyde has substituents at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). So the ring would have substituents at positions 1,2,3. That leaves positions 4,5,6. Are any of these equivalent?

In such a case, the ring would be meta-substituted, but I'm not sure about the symmetry. Wait, if substituents are at 1,2,3, then positions 4,5,6 would each have a unique environment. So the NMR would have three distinct signals for the aromatic protons. But the data shows only two signals, each integrating to 2H. So that doesn't fit. So option A's NMR would have three sets of protons, not two. But the data shows two sets. So that's a problem. So option A might not be the correct answer.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the substitution pattern. Let me think again. If the substituents are at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl), then the ring doesn't have any symmetry. So each of the remaining positions (4,5,6) would have unique environments, leading to three distinct signals. But the NMR data has two, each integrating to 2H. So that doesn't fit. Therefore, option A might not be the correct choice.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's try another angle. Let's look at the options again.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

The structure has substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the ring is para-substituted. The aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. Positions 2 and 6 are equivalent (both ortho to COOH and meta to Cl), and positions 3 and 5 are equivalent (both meta to COOH and ortho to Cl). So each pair would show up as a doublet in the NMR, integrating to 2H each. That matches the NMR data. 

The 11.0 ppm singlet would be the COOH proton. But as I thought earlier, that doesn't fit because the COOH proton is usually a broad peak. The IR data has a strong peak at 1720, which would correspond to the COOH carbonyl. But wait, the COOH carbonyl is typically around 1700, so 1720 is a bit high. Maybe because Cl is a para-substituent, it could cause a slight shift. Alternatively, perhaps it's not the COOH carbonyl but something else.

Alternatively, the IR could have another carbonyl. Let me think, if the compound were a chloroformate, the carbonyl would be higher, but option B doesn't have that.

Wait, another possibility: the IR peak at 1720 is from a conjugated carbonyl. If the COOH group is conjugated with the Cl, could that shift the carbonyl peak higher?

Alternatively, maybe the IR is showing the O-H of the COOH, but that's usually in the 2500-3300 region. But the IR's broad peak is from 3500-2700, which is lower. Hmm, that's conflicting.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but let's try to think about the possible structures again.

The NMR data:

- 11.0 ppm (s,1H): possibly the COOH proton (option B), aldehyde proton (option A), or something else.

- 8.02 and 7.72 (each d, 2H): indicates a para-substituted ring.

So for para-substituted rings, the aromatic protons are split into two sets, each integrating to 2H. So that matches options B and D (if their structures have para-substituted rings).

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Substituents at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So the ring is ortho-substituted. The aromatic protons would not be in two sets of 2H each. Instead, they would be three sets: perhaps two doublets and a triplet, but I'm not sure. So the NMR data doesn't fit option D as well.

So, option B's aromatic protons fit the NMR data.

Now, let's think about the IR. If the 1720 peak is from the COOH group, it's a bit high but possible. The broad peak in IR from 3500-2700 would be the O-H of the COOH group. But why is the O-H peak in that region? Because COOH's O-H is usually a very broad peak around 2500-3300. But the data shows a broad peak from 3500-2700, which is a lower wavenumber. That's a bit conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak is from an alcohol group, like in option A. But option B doesn't have a phenol group.

Wait, maybe the broad peak is from another group. Let me think about option C: phenyl chloroformate. The structure would be Cl-CO-O-Ph. The IR would show the carbonyl at around 1720, which fits. But where is the broad peak from 3500-2700? There's no O-H in chloroformate, so that can't be. Unless the broad peak is from something else, like C-O stretching, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: in chloroformate, the O-Ph group could have C-O stretching, which typically appears around 1250-1050 cm^-1. So that's not in the 3500-2700 region. So the IR data's broad peak can't be explained by option C.

So back to option B: the IR's broad peak from 3500-2700 is the O-H of the COOH group. The fact that it's broad and in that region makes sense. The 1720 peak is the carbonyl, but why is it at 1720 when COOH is usually around 1700? Maybe the substituent (Cl) is causing a slight upshift. Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, which would strengthen the carbonyl bond, leading to a higher wavenumber. So 1720 could make sense.

The NMR's 11ppm peak would be the COOH proton as a sharp singlet. But that's conflicting because COOH protons are usually broad. Unless the sample is not exchanged in D2O, but in most cases, the O-H proton would be a broad peak.

Wait, another thought: in the NMR, if the solution is not in D2O, the COOH proton would appear as a broad peak. But if the sample is in D2O, the O-H would be exchanged and not show up. But in the NMR data, it's a sharp singlet. So perhaps the sample isn't deuterated, so the O-H is visible but appears as a sharp peak. I'm not sure if that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is not from the COOH group but from a different proton, but I can't think of what that would be.

So, considering all the data, the IR and NMR seem to fit option B, except for the O-H peak in the NMR. But maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, let's think about option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. The substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). The aromatic protons would be in positions 3,4,5,6. The protons at 3 and 5 would be equivalent (both meta to Cl and adjacent to COOH), and protons 4 and 6 would be another set. So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That matches the data.

The 11ppm peak would be the COOH proton. But again, the issue is whether it's a sharp singlet. 

The IR: the COOH group would have a carbonyl around 1700 and an O-H around 2500-3300. The given IR has a peak at 1720 (which is a bit high), and a broad peak from 3500-2700. So the O-H would be in the correct region, but the carbonyl is a bit high.

So, considering all, maybe option B is more likely because the NMR's aromatic protons fit better. Also, the molecular weight and M+2 peak fit all options, so that can't differentiate.

Another point: the IR's strong peak at 1720 could be from an ester or a ketone. But none of the options are esters or ketones.

Wait, let me think about the 1H NMR for option B. The singlet at 11 could be the COOH proton. But if it's a sharp peak, that's unusual. So perhaps the 11ppm is from another group.

Wait, another possibility: the 11ppm peak is from an acidic aliphatic proton, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from a carbonyl group, but that's not a proton.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck between options B and A. Let me try to think about the IR again.

Option A: the IR has a strong peak at 1720 (aldehyde carbonyl) and a broad peak from 3500-2700 (phenol O-H). That would fit. The NMR for option A would have the aldehyde as a singlet at 11ppm, which is a bit high but plausible. However, the aromatic protons would have three signals, which doesn't fit the data.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me reevaluate the aromatic protons in option A. If the substituents are at 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl), what about the symmetry?

The ring would have substituents at 1,2,3. So the remaining positions are 4,5,6. Are any of these positions equivalent?

Position 4: between 3 (Cl) and 5 (H)
Position 5: between 4 (H) and 6 (H)
Position 6: between 5 (H) and 1 (CHO)

Wait, perhaps positions 4 and 6 are not equivalent. So the NMR would have three distinct signals, but the data has two. So that doesn't fit.

Thus, option A is unlikely because the aromatic protons don't match.

So, going back, the only option that fits the aromatic proton NMR data is option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid) and option D (if the substitution allows two doublets).

Wait, option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure has Cl at position 2, COOH at 1. The aromatic protons would be at positions 3,4,5,6.

Positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent (both meta to Cl and adjacent to COOH), and positions 4 and 6 would be another set (ortho to Cl and meta to COOH). So the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That matches the data.

So option D's aromatic protons fit.

The 11ppm peak would be the COOH proton, which is a singlet. But again, the issue is the sharpness.

So, IR:

Option D: COOH's carbonyl at around 1700. The IR shows 1720, which is a bit high.

The O-H in the IR would be in the 2500-3300 region, but the data shows a broad peak from 3500-2700. Hmm, conflicting.

So, considering all, perhaps the best fit is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

But I'm still not entirely confident because of the NMR's 11ppm peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the 11ppm peak is not the COOH proton but something else. Wait, another possibility: the 11ppm could be an aliphatic chlorine, but no, Cl doesn't have protons.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let's try to go through the options again:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

- Mass: M=156, M+2=158 → fits.

- IR: strong peak at 1720 → maybe a conjugated carbonyl.

- Broad peak from 3500-2700 → O-H of COOH.

- NMR: 11.0 (s,1H) → COOH proton. But expected to be broad, but in the data it's sharp.

- Aromatic protons: two doublets → fits.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

- Mass: same.

- IR: same.

- NMR: fits aromatic protons, same as B.

But the O-H and carbonyl regions are same issues.

Wait, maybe the 11ppm is from a different group, like a nitro group, but none of the options have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the 11ppm is from an aliphatic proton that's highly deshielded. But I can't think of any.

At this point, I think the best fit is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Because the aromatic protons match, and the other data can be explained with some assumptions.


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data and comparing it to four options: **3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (A)**, **4-chlorobenzoic acid (B)**, **Phenyl chloroformate (C)**, and **2-chlorobenzoic acid (D)**. The analysis proceeds as follows:

---

### **Mass Spectrometry (MS):**
- Molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** and a fragment peak at **m/z = 158 (32%)** suggest a molecular weight of 156 with a chlorine atom (Cl), as the M+2 peak corresponds to the isotopic abundance of chlorine (37Cl).

---

### **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy:**
- **Broad peak from 3500–2700 cm⁻¹**: Indicates the presence of an O-H group, likely from a carboxylic acid or phenol.
- **Strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**: Suggests a carbonyl group, likely from a carboxylic acid or aldehyde.

---

### **1H NMR Spectroscopy:**
- **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: A sharp singlet, likely from a proton in a highly deshielded environment, such as a carboxylic acid or phenol O-H.
- **8.02 ppm (d, 2H)** and **7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicative of a **para-substituted aromatic ring**.

---

### **Analysis of Each Option:**

#### **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**
- **Structure**: CHO at position 1, OH at position 2, Cl at position 3.
- **Mass**: Fits (C₇H₅ClO₂, molecular weight ~156.5).
- **IR**: The aldehyde carbonyl (~1720 cm⁻¹) and phenol O-H (broad peak) are consistent.
- **NMR**: 
  - The aldehyde proton (~9–10 ppm) is unusually downfield at 11.0 ppm, which is plausible due to deshielding from adjacent electron-withdrawing groups.
  - However, the aromatic protons would not produce two doublets (each integrating to 2H), as the substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3 disrupt symmetry, leading to three distinct aromatic signals. This conflicts with the NMR data.
- **Conclusion**: Does not fit the NMR data.

---

#### **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic Acid**
- **Structure**: COOH at position 1, Cl at position 4.
- **Mass**: Fits (C₇H₅ClO₂, molecular weight ~156.5).
- **IR**: 
  - The carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is slightly higher than typical for a carboxylic acid (~1700 cm⁻¹), but this could be due to conjugation with the chlorine atom.
  - The broad peak from 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carboxylic acid O-H stretch.
- **NMR**: 
  - The sharp singlet at 11.0 ppm matches the carboxylic acid proton, though carboxylic acid protons are typically broad. This discrepancy could be due to the sample not being exchanged in D₂O.
  - The aromatic protons at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm (each integrating to 2H) match the para-substituted aromatic ring pattern.
- **Conclusion**: Fits the data well.

#### **Option C: Phenyl Chloroformate**
- **Structure**: Cl-CO-O-Ph.
- **Mass**: Fits (C₇H₅ClO₂, molecular weight ~156.5).
- **IR**: 
  - The carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is consistent with a chloroformate.
  - However, there is no O-H group in this structure to account for the broad peak from 3500–2700 cm⁻¹.
- **NMR**: 
  - The absence of an O-H group makes it impossible to explain the sharp singlet at 11.0 ppm.
  - The aromatic protons would not produce two doublets (each integrating to 2H), as the substitution pattern does not allow for such symmetry.
- **Conclusion**: Does not fit the data.

#### **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic Acid**
- **Structure**: COOH at position 1, Cl at position 2.
- **Mass**: Fits (C₇H₅ClO₂, molecular weight ~156.5).
- **IR**: 
  - The carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ is slightly higher than typical for a carboxylic acid (~1700 cm⁻¹), but this could be due to conjugation with the chlorine atom.
  - The broad peak from 3500–2700 cm⁻¹ corresponds to the carboxylic acid O-H stretch.
- **NMR**: 
  - The sharp singlet at 11.0 ppm matches the carboxylic acid proton, though carboxylic acid protons are typically broad. This discrepancy could be due to the sample not being exchanged in D₂O.
  - The aromatic protons would not produce two doublets (each integrating to 2H), as the substitution pattern does not allow for such symmetry.
- **Conclusion**: Does not fit the NMR data.

### **Final Conclusion:**
Option **B (4-chlorobenzoic acid)** best fits the spectral data. The mass, IR, and NMR data are consistent with the structure, despite minor discrepancies in the sharpness of the COOH proton peak in the NMR.

**Answer: B**
