Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question in front of me. Let's try to tackle it step by step. Hmm, the question says we have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Oh wait, di-substituted usually means two substituents on the ring, right?

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. So, the molecule must have both a carbonyl (like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and a halogen attached to the aromatic ring. That makes me think of something like an aromatic aldehyde or maybe an aromatic ketone with a halogen substituent.

Wait, the ring has 8 carbons in total. Oh wait, no, the ring itself is 6-membered, so the substituents add up to 2 more carbons. Because 6 (aromatic ring) plus 2 substituents equals 8. So each substituent adds a certain number of carbons. Wait, but substituents can vary. For example, if one is a carbonyl group (like a ketone, which is a carbonyl attached to two carbons), but wait, no: a ketone substituent would be something like R-CO-R', but that depends on the structure.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about possible structures. Let me think: the aromatic ring has two substituents. One is a carbonyl group, which could be like a carbonyl attached directly to the ring (like a ketone, but wait, benzene rings usually can't have ketones directly attached because of the stability. Oh wait, no, benzophenone is a diketone, but that's a different scenario. Alternatively, maybe it's an aldehyde attached to the ring, but aldehydes are usually RCHO, which is one substituent.

Wait, but wait, the molecule has a total of 8 carbons. The benzene ring is 6 carbons. So the two substituents must contribute 2 carbons in total. So each substituent can contribute 1 carbon, or one substituent has 1 and the other 1. Or perhaps one substituent has two carbons and the other has zero? No, because the substituents are di, so two substituents.

Wait, no, substituents can have multiple carbons. Let's think. Let's say substituent A is a carbonyl group, like O=C-R, and substituent B is a halogen, like Cl or Br. But wait, the carbonyl group would add more carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the aromatic ring has 6 carbons. The substituents are two groups, each attached to the ring. Each substituent is a group, which can have their own carbons. So if the total is 8, then substituents add 2 carbons. So each substituent could be one carbon or one substituent has two and the other zero—no, because both substituents must contribute, because di-substituted.

Wait, perhaps substituents like -OCH3 (methoxy) would add one carbon each, but that's not a carbonyl. Alternatively, substituents like -CHO (aldehyde) which contributes one carbon, and another substituent—like -X (halogen) which contributes no carbons. So total substituent carbons: one (from aldehyde) plus zero (from halogen) equals one. So total carbons would be 6 (ring) + 1 (substituents) =7. But the molecule has 8 carbons. So that's not enough.

Ah, wait, maybe the substituents together add two carbons. So substituent A has two carbons, substituent B has zero (like a halogen). Alternatively, substituent A has one, substituent B has one. Let's see.

If substituent A is a carbonyl group. For example, a ketone substituent. Wait, but how? To have a carbonyl, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl attached to another carbon. Like an acetyl group, OAc group. Wait, for example, an acetyl group is -COCH3. That would add two carbons (the CO and the CH3). So substituent A is -COCH3 (2 carbons), substituent B is a halogen (like Cl), which adds zero. So total substituent carbons: 2 +0=2, plus the 6 ring carbons gives 8. That fits.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with two substituents: one acetyl (COCH3) and one halogen (Cl, Br, etc.). Alternatively, another possibility: substituent A is a carbonyl group attached directly to the ring, but that's a ketone, which isn't possible on benzene because that would form a cyclohexadienone, which is not stable unless it's a very strong directing group like para substitution. Alternatively, maybe substituent A is an aldehyde group (-CHO) which has one carbon, and substituent B is an ethyl group or something else. Wait, but then substituent B would need to contribute one carbon. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the FTIR shows a carbonyl (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond. So the molecule has both a carbonyl group and an aromatic halogen substituent. So that would mean that the ring has two substituents: one being a carbonyl group (like -CO- something) and another being a halogen, say Cl or Br.

But how many carbons do these substituents contribute? The acetyl group (-COCH3) is a substituent with two carbons. So if the ring has 6, and the substituents are -COCH3 and -X (where X is Cl, Br, etc.), that gives 6 +2 +0=8 carbons. That fits the total of 8.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with an acetyl group (COCH3) and a halogen atom as substituents. Now, the question is about the 1H NMR.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)

Hmm, the singlet at 9.9 could be an aldehyde proton. But if the substituent is a ketone (like acetyl), there wouldn't be an aldehyde proton. So maybe this is for an aldehyde substituent.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)

This looks like perhaps a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an acetate or an acetal. But I'm not sure how that would fit with the aromatic ring.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)

The aromatic peaks are in the typical range. The singlet at 2.3 ppm with 3H could be a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, like COCH3. So that would fit the acetyl group. Let me think: in the NMR, the aromatic protons would be split into two doublets if the substituents are in a para position. Because if the substituents are para, then the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons.

Wait, if the substituents are para, the ring would have two doublets each integrating to 2H. So that fits with option C's 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). And the singlet at 2.3 (3H) would be the acetyl methyl group. So that seems to fit. So option C could be correct.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)

This seems like a monosubstituted benzene with some other groups, perhaps an oxygen-bearing substituent, but not sure. The 1H singlet at 6.9 could be a proton next to substituents, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents could be a carbonyl group attached differently. Let's think about the structure. If the substituents are in the para position, the aromatic protons would be in two doublets, each integrating to two H. So, for example, if the substituents are at para positions, the adjacent Hs would be as two doublets.

So in option C, the aromatic peaks are two doublets, each 2H. That suggests para substituents.

In that case, the substituents would be para to each other. So the ring has -COCH3 and -X (Cl, Br, etc.) in para positions.

So the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, each integrating to 2H. The COCH3 group would have a singlet at around 2.3 ppm for the methyl group.

So option C's data matches that: aromatic peaks as two doublets, and a singlet for the methyl group attached to the carbonyl.

So then, the correct NMR would be option C.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (-X). The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons, so the two substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. One substituent is a carbonyl group, likely an acetyl group (-COCH3), which contributes 2 carbons, and the other substituent is a halogen (-X), which does not contribute any carbons. Thus, the structure is a benzene ring with an acetyl group and a halogen in the para positions.

In the 1H NMR spectrum, the aromatic protons will appear as two doublets (each integrating to 2H) due to the para substitution pattern. The methyl group of the acetyl group (-COCH3) will appear as a singlet around 2.3 ppm. This matches the data in option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). The other options do not align with the expected splitting pattern for the aromatic protons or the chemical shift for the acetyl methyl group.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question in front of me. Let's try to tackle it step by step. Hmm, the question says we have a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with a total of 8 carbon atoms. Oh wait, di-substituted usually means two substituents on the ring, right?

Looking at the options:

Hmm, the singlet at 9.9 could be an aldehyde proton. But if the substituent is a ketone (like acetyl), there wouldn't be an aldehyde proton. So maybe this is for an aldehyde substituent.

Option B: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s)

This looks like perhaps a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like in an acetate or an acetal. But I'm not sure how that would fit with the aromatic ring.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)

The aromatic peaks are in the typical range. The singlet at 2.3 ppm with 3H could be a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, like COCH3. So that would fit the acetyl group.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)

This seems like a monosubstituted benzene with some other groups, perhaps an oxygen-bearing substituent, but not sure. The 1H singlet at 6.9 could be a proton next to substituents, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: the substituents could be a carbonyl group attached differently. Let's think about the structure.

So the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets, each integrating to 2H. The COCH3 group would have a singlet at around 2.3 ppm for the methyl group.

So option C's data matches that: aromatic peaks as two doublets, and a singlet for the methyl group attached to the carbonyl.

So then, the correct NMR would be option C.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (-X).

Thus, the structure is a benzene ring with an acetyl group and a halogen in the para positions.

In the 1H NMR spectrum, the aromatic protons will appear as two doublets (each integrating to 2H) due to the para substitution pattern. The methyl group of the acetyl group (-COCH3) will appear as a singlet around 2.3 ppm. This matches the data in option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 (3H, s). The other options do not align with the expected splitting pattern for the aromatic protons or the chemical shift for the acetyl methyl group.
