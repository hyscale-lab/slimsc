Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me see what it's about. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a particular spin state. Hmm, I remember that expectation values are like the average measurement you'd get if you measured that observable many times on identical systems.

The given spin state is (3i, 4). Wait, I think that's a two-component vector representing the electron's spin state. So in Dirac notation, that's a column vector: ψ = [3i; 4]. Or wait, no, wait, in spinor notation, the components are usually written as ψ = (up, down), right? So here, the first component is 3i, and the second is 4.

The operator for S_y is given by ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix σ_y. Oh, right, because the spin operators are S_x, S_y, S_z which are (ħ/2) multiplied by the respective Pauli matrices. So σ_y is the matrix they wrote: [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

The expectation value is calculated as ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. So I need to compute this. Let me write it down step by step.

First, compute ψ† (the conjugate transpose of ψ) multiplied by S_y, then multiply by ψ. So:

⟨S_y⟩ = (ψ†) (S_y) ψ

Breaking it down, I'll compute each part step by step. Let's compute ψ† first. ψ is [3i; 4], so ψ† would be [ -3 (since the conjugate of 3i is -3), 4 ]. Wait, no, wait: the first component is 3i, so its complex conjugate is -3i? Wait no, wait: 3i's complex conjugate is -3i, because the conjugate of i is -i. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ], as a row vector.

Wait, wait, let me think again. The original ψ is a column vector: [3i, 4]^T. So when we take the conjugate transpose, the first component becomes the first row, but we take the complex conjugate. So 3i becomes -3i, and 4 stays 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by σ_y. So:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So when we compute ψ† * S_y, that's [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by (ħ/2) times the matrix. Let me compute ψ† times σ_y first, and then multiply by ħ/2.

So, ψ† * σ_y = [ -3i, 4 ] * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Wait, matrix multiplication. So each element is the dot product of the row and column. So element (1,1) is ( -3i * 0 ) + (4 * i ) = 4i. Element (1,2) is ( -3i * (-i) ) + (4 * 0 ) = (3i^2) + 0 = 3*(-1) because i^2 is -1. So 3*(-1) is -3.

Wait, wait, let me compute each component correctly. The product of ψ† (which is a 1x2 matrix) and σ_y (2x2) will give a 1x2 matrix.

Wait, actually, no: ψ† is 1x2, σ_y is 2x2. So ψ† * σ_y is 1x2.

Let me see:

The first element is ( -3i * 0 ) + (4 * i ) = 0 + 4i = 4i.

The second element is ( -3i * (-i) ) + (4 * 0 ) = (3i^2) + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So ψ† σ_y = [4i, -3].

Now, multiply this by (ħ/2), so ψ† S_y = [ (4i) * (ħ/2), (-3) * (ħ/2) ) ] = [ 2i ħ, (-3/2) ħ ].

Wait, that's ψ† S_y. Now, to get ⟨S_y⟩, you multiply this by ψ, which is [3i; 4]. So it's a 1x2 multiplied by a 2x1, giving a scalar.

Wait, no: ψ is a column vector. So ψ† S_y is a row vector, and ψ is a column vector. So the product is:

[4i * (ħ/2), (-3) * (ħ/2)] multiplied by [3i; 4]. So:

= (4i * ħ/2) * 3i + ( (-3) * ħ/2 ) *4

Wait no, the first term is (4i * ħ/2) multiplied by 3i, and the second term is (-3 * ħ/2) multiplied by 4.

So let's compute each term.

First term:

(4i) * (ħ/2) * 3i = (4i * 3i) * (ħ/2) = (12 i²) * (ħ/2) = 12*(-1) * (ħ/2) = -12 ħ / 2 = -6 ħ.

Wait, no, wait: 4i * 3i is 12 i², which is 12*(-1) = -12. So (4i)*(3i) = -12. So multiplying by (ħ/2), that's (-12) * (ħ/2) = -6 ħ.

Wait, perhaps I should break it down step by step.

Wait, first term: (4i * ħ/2) * 3i = (4i * 3i) * (ħ/2) = (12 i²) * (ħ/2) = 12*(-1) * (ħ/2) = -12 * ħ/2 = -6 ħ.

Second term: (-3 * ħ/2) * 4 = (-3 *4) * (ħ/2) = (-12) * (ħ/2) = -6 ħ.

So the total is (-6 ħ) + (-6 ħ) = -12 ħ.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the options don't have -12 ħ. Let me check where I went wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is (ψ† S_y ψ). So first I compute ψ† S_y, which is [4i, -3] multiplied by (ħ/2), so that's [2i ħ, (-3/2) ħ]. Then, when I multiply this by ψ, which is [3i; 4], it's the sum of the products.

Wait, no: ψ is a column vector, [3i;4], so the multiplication is [4i * (ħ/2), -3 * (ħ/2)] multiplied by [3i;4]. So the dot product is:

(4i * ħ/2) * 3i + ( (-3) * ħ/2 ) *4.

Wait, let me compute each term:

First term: (4i * ħ/2) * 3i = (4i * 3i) * (ħ/2) = (12 i²) (ħ/2) = (12*(-1)) (ħ/2) = (-12) (ħ/2) = -6 ħ.

Second term: ( (-3) * ħ/2 ) *4 = (-3 *4) * (ħ/2 ) = (-12) (ħ/2 )= -6 ħ.

So total expectation value is (-6 ħ) + (-6 ħ) = -12 ħ. But wait, that's without considering the 1/2 factor correctly. Wait, no, because S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So the entire expression is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_y.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the matrix elements correctly.

Alternative approach: Compute ψ† σ_y ψ, then multiply by (ħ/2).

So let me compute ψ† σ_y ψ:

ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ], σ_y is [[0, -i], [i,0]], and ψ is [3i;4].

So ψ† σ_y ψ is:

[ -3i, 4 ] * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i;4].

Wait, actually, matrix multiplication order: ψ† σ_y is a row vector, then multiplied by ψ gives a scalar.

Alternatively, compute as (ψ† σ_y) · ψ.

So ψ† σ_y = [ -3i,4 ] * σ_y, which is:

First element: (-3i * 0) + (4 * i) = 0 + 4i =4i.

Second element: (-3i * (-i)) + (4 * 0) = (3i^2) +0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So ψ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Now, multiply this by ψ: [4i, -3] · [3i;4] = (4i)(3i) + (-3)(4) = 12 i² + (-12) = 12*(-1) -12 = -12 -12 = -24.

So ψ† σ_y ψ = -24.

Therefore, ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24/2) ħ = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see -12 ħ. Option A is -12 ħ/25, B is 12 ħ/25.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the components again.

Wait, ψ is given as (3i,4), which is the column vector [3i;4]. So ψ† is [3i*,4*] = [-3i,4].

Wait, yes, that's correct. So ψ† is [-3i,4].

Then σ_y is [[0, -i], [i,0]].

So ψ† σ_y is:

First component: (-3i)*0 + 4 *i = 0 +4i =4i.

Second component: (-3i)*(-i) +4*0 = (3i^2) +0=3*(-1) =-3.

So ψ† σ_y = [4i, -3].

Then ψ is [3i;4].

So the dot product is (4i)(3i) + (-3)(4) = 12i² -12 =12*(-1) -12 = -12-12 =-24.

So ψ† σ_y ψ = -24.

So ⟨S_y⟩ is (ħ/2)(-24) = -12 ħ.

Hmm, but the options don't have -12 ħ. The options are (A) -12 ħ/25, (B) 12 ħ/25, (C)25 ħ/2, (D) -25 ħ/2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the spin state's normalization. Because the state (3i,4) might not be normalized. Oh, right! The expectation value formula requires that the state is normalized. So the state must have a norm of 1.

Wait, the norm squared of ψ is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) =25. So the norm is 5. So the state is (3i/5,4/5), because we need to normalize it. Wait, but the question didn't mention anything about normalization. So does that mean ψ is not normalized, and the expectation value would account for that?

Ah, right! Because the expectation value is (ψ† S_y ψ) divided by (ψ† ψ) if the state isn't normalized. Wait, no, wait: the expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ if the state is not normalized. Because expectation value is (ψ† S_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ) only when the state is not normalized. No, wait, no. Wait, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, but if |ψ⟩ is not normalized, then the state should be normalized before computing the expectation. So perhaps the given state is not normalized, and thus the expectation value will involve the normalization factor.

So let me compute the normalization factor. The inner product ψ† ψ is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 +16=25. So the norm is 5. So the normalized state is (3i/5,4/5).

So the correct expectation value would be [⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ ] / (ψ† ψ).

Wait, no, because the expectation value is calculated as (ψ† S_y ψ) divided by the norm squared, which is 25.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The expectation value is (⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩) divided by (⟨ψ|ψ⟩) if the state is not normalized.

Wait, no, no. The expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, but if the state is not normalized, you have to normalize it. So perhaps the correct approach is to first normalize ψ, then compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, the expectation value is (ψ† S_y ψ) divided by (ψ† ψ), because ψ is not normalized. Let me clarify this.

The expectation value is given by (ψ† S_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ), because ψ is a non-normalized state vector. Because the standard expectation formula is ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩ where |ψ⟩ is normalized, i.e., ⟨ψ|ψ⟩=1. Here, since ψ is not normalized, ⟨ψ|ψ⟩=25, so the correct expectation value would be (ψ† S_y ψ)/(ψ† ψ) = (-24) /25 * ħ/2 * 2? Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled up.

Wait, no, earlier I found that ψ† σ_y ψ is -24. So the expectation value of σ_y is -24/25, because ψ† ψ is 25.

So ⟨σ_y⟩ = (ψ† σ_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ) )= (-24)/25.

Then, ⟨S_y⟩ is (ħ/2) * ⟨σ_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24/25) )= (-12 ħ)/25.

Ah, that makes sense. So the expectation value is (-12 ħ)/25, which matches option A.

Wait, so I think I initially forgot that the state wasn't normalized. So I have to normalize it first. So the correct steps are:

1. Compute ψ† ψ = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 =9+16=25. So the norm is 5.

2. The expectation value of σ_y is (ψ† σ_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ) )= (-24)/25.

3. So the expectation value of S_y is (ħ/2) * (-24/25) )= (-12 ħ)/25.

Which is option A.

To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = (3i, 4) \), we proceed as follows:

### Key Information:
1. The spin operator along the y-direction is \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & -i \\
   i & 0
   \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
2. The expectation value of \( S_y \) is given by:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi}.
   \]
   Here, \( \psi^\dagger \) is the conjugate transpose of \( \psi \), and \( \psi^\dagger \psi \) ensures normalization.

### Step 1: Compute \( \psi^\dagger \psi \) (Normalization Factor)
The given spin state is \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \). Its conjugate transpose is:
\[
\psi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The norm squared is:
\[
\psi^\dagger \psi = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = 9 + 16 = 25.
\]
Thus, the normalization factor is \( \psi^\dagger \psi = 25 \).

### Step 2: Compute \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi \)
First, calculate \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \):
\[
\psi^\dagger \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4i & -3 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Next, multiply by \( \psi \):
\[
\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 4i & -3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = (4i)(3i) + (-3)(4) = 12i^2 - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \langle S_y \rangle \)
The expectation value of \( \sigma_y \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi} = \frac{-24}{25}.
\]
Thus, the expectation value of \( S_y \) is:
\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \left(-\frac{24}{25}\right) = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12 \hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me see what it's about. The question is about finding the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, S_y, for an electron in a particular spin state. Hmm, I remember that expectation values are like the average measurement you'd get if you measured that observable many times on identical systems.

The given spin state is (3i, 4). Wait, I think that's a two-component vector representing the electron's spin state. So in Dirac notation, that's a column vector: ψ = [3i; 4]. Or wait, no, wait, in spinor notation, the components are usually written as ψ = (up, down), right? So here, the first component is 3i, and the second is 4.

The operator for S_y is given by ħ/2 times the Pauli matrix σ_y. Oh, right, because the spin operators are S_x, S_y, S_z which are (ħ/2) multiplied by the respective Pauli matrices. So σ_y is the matrix they wrote: [[0, -i], [i, 0]]. So S_y = (ħ/2) * σ_y.

The expectation value is calculated as ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩. So I need to compute this. Let me write it down step by step.

First, compute ψ† (the conjugate transpose of ψ) multiplied by S_y, then multiply by ψ. So:

⟨S_y⟩ = (ψ†) (S_y) ψ

Breaking it down, I'll compute each part step by step. Let's compute ψ† first. ψ is [3i; 4], so ψ† would be [ -3 (since the conjugate of 3i is -3), 4 ]. Wait, no, wait: the first component is 3i, so its complex conjugate is -3i? Wait no, wait: 3i's complex conjugate is -3i, because the conjugate of i is -i. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ], as a row vector.

Wait, wait, let me think again. The original ψ is a column vector: [3i, 4]^T. So when we take the conjugate transpose, the first component becomes the first row, but we take the complex conjugate. So 3i becomes -3i, and 4 stays 4. So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

So ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ].

Now, S_y is (ħ/2) multiplied by σ_y. So:

S_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]

So when we compute ψ† * S_y, that's [ -3i, 4 ] multiplied by (ħ/2) times the matrix. Let me compute ψ† times σ_y first, and then multiply by ħ/2.

So, ψ† * σ_y = [ -3i, 4 ] * [ [0, -i], [i, 0] ]

Wait, matrix multiplication. So each element is the dot product of the row and column. So element (1,1) is ( -3i * 0 ) + (4 * i ) = 4i. Element (1,2) is ( -3i * (-i) ) + (4 * 0 ) = (3i^2) + 0 = 3*(-1) because i^2 is -1. So 3*(-1) is -3.

Wait, wait, let me compute each component correctly. The product of ψ† (which is a 1x2 matrix) and σ_y (2x2) will give a 1x2 matrix.

Wait, actually, no: ψ† is 1x2, σ_y is 2x2. So ψ† * σ_y is 1x2.

Let me see:

The first element is ( -3i * 0 ) + (4 * i ) = 0 + 4i = 4i.

The second element is ( -3i * (-i) ) + (4 * 0 ) = (3i^2) + 0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So ψ† σ_y = [4i, -3].

Now, multiply this by (ħ/2), so ψ† S_y = [ (4i) * (ħ/2), (-3) * (ħ/2) ) ] = [ 2i ħ, (-3/2) ħ ].

Wait, that's ψ† S_y. Now, to get ⟨S_y⟩, you multiply this by ψ, which is [3i; 4]. So it's a 1x2 multiplied by a 2x1, giving a scalar.

Wait, no: ψ is a column vector. So ψ† S_y is a row vector, and ψ is a column vector. So the product is:

[4i * (ħ/2), (-3) * (ħ/2)] multiplied by [3i; 4]. So:

= (4i * ħ/2) * 3i + ( (-3) * ħ/2 ) *4

Wait no, the first term is (4i * ħ/2) multiplied by 3i, and the second term is (-3 * ħ/2) multiplied by 4.

So let's compute each term.

First term:

(4i) * (ħ/2) * 3i = (4i * 3i) * (ħ/2) = (12 i²) * (ħ/2) = 12*(-1) * (ħ/2) = -12 ħ / 2 = -6 ħ.

Wait, no, wait: 4i * 3i is 12 i², which is 12*(-1) = -12. So (4i)*(3i) = -12. So multiplying by (ħ/2), that's (-12) * (ħ/2) = -6 ħ.

Wait, perhaps I should break it down step by step.

Wait, first term: (4i * ħ/2) * 3i = (4i * 3i) * (ħ/2) = (12 i²) * (ħ/2) = 12*(-1) * (ħ/2) = -12 * ħ/2 = -6 ħ.

Second term: (-3 * ħ/2) * 4 = (-3 *4) * (ħ/2) = (-12) * (ħ/2) = -6 ħ.

So the total is (-6 ħ) + (-6 ħ) = -12 ħ.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the options don't have -12 ħ. Let me check where I went wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go back.

Wait, the expectation value ⟨S_y⟩ is (ψ† S_y ψ). So first I compute ψ† S_y, which is [4i, -3] multiplied by (ħ/2), so that's [2i ħ, (-3/2) ħ]. Then, when I multiply this by ψ, which is [3i; 4], it's the sum of the products.

Wait, no: ψ is a column vector, [3i;4], so the multiplication is [4i * (ħ/2), -3 * (ħ/2)] multiplied by [3i;4]. So the dot product is:

(4i * ħ/2) * 3i + ( (-3) * ħ/2 ) *4.

Wait, let me compute each term:

First term: (4i * ħ/2) * 3i = (4i * 3i) * (ħ/2) = (12 i²) (ħ/2) = (12*(-1)) (ħ/2) = (-12) (ħ/2) = -6 ħ.

Second term: ( (-3) * ħ/2 ) *4 = (-3 *4) * (ħ/2 ) = (-12) (ħ/2 )= -6 ħ.

So total expectation value is (-6 ħ) + (-6 ħ) = -12 ħ. But wait, that's without considering the 1/2 factor correctly. Wait, no, because S_y is (ħ/2) σ_y. So the entire expression is (ħ/2) times the expectation value of σ_y.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the matrix elements correctly.

Alternative approach: Compute ψ† σ_y ψ, then multiply by (ħ/2).

So let me compute ψ† σ_y ψ:

ψ† is [ -3i, 4 ], σ_y is [[0, -i], [i,0]], and ψ is [3i;4].

So ψ† σ_y ψ is:

[ -3i, 4 ] * [[0, -i], [i, 0]] * [3i;4].

Wait, actually, matrix multiplication order: ψ† σ_y is a row vector, then multiplied by ψ gives a scalar.

Alternatively, compute as (ψ† σ_y) · ψ.

So ψ† σ_y = [ -3i,4 ] * σ_y, which is:

First element: (-3i * 0) + (4 * i) = 0 + 4i =4i.

Second element: (-3i * (-i)) + (4 * 0) = (3i^2) +0 = 3*(-1) = -3.

So ψ† σ_y is [4i, -3].

Now, multiply this by ψ: [4i, -3] · [3i;4] = (4i)(3i) + (-3)(4) = 12 i² + (-12) = 12*(-1) -12 = -12 -12 = -24.

So ψ† σ_y ψ = -24.

Therefore, ⟨S_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24) = (-24/2) ħ = -12 ħ.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see -12 ħ. Option A is -12 ħ/25, B is 12 ħ/25.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the components again.

Wait, ψ is given as (3i,4), which is the column vector [3i;4]. So ψ† is [3i*,4*] = [-3i,4].

Wait, yes, that's correct. So ψ† is [-3i,4].

Then σ_y is [[0, -i], [i,0]].

So ψ† σ_y is:

First component: (-3i)*0 + 4 *i = 0 +4i =4i.

Second component: (-3i)*(-i) +4*0 = (3i^2) +0=3*(-1) =-3.

So ψ† σ_y = [4i, -3].

Then ψ is [3i;4].

So the dot product is (4i)(3i) + (-3)(4) = 12i² -12 =12*(-1) -12 = -12-12 =-24.

So ψ† σ_y ψ = -24.

So ⟨S_y⟩ is (ħ/2)(-24) = -12 ħ.

Hmm, but the options don't have -12 ħ. The options are (A) -12 ħ/25, (B) 12 ħ/25, (C)25 ħ/2, (D) -25 ħ/2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the spin state's normalization. Because the state (3i,4) might not be normalized. Oh, right! The expectation value formula requires that the state is normalized. So the state must have a norm of 1.

Wait, the norm squared of ψ is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = (9) + (16) =25. So the norm is 5. So the state is (3i/5,4/5), because we need to normalize it. Wait, but the question didn't mention anything about normalization. So does that mean ψ is not normalized, and the expectation value would account for that?

Ah, right! Because the expectation value is (ψ† S_y ψ) divided by (ψ† ψ) if the state isn't normalized. Wait, no, wait: the expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ if the state is not normalized. Because expectation value is (ψ† S_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ) only when the state is not normalized. No, wait, no. Wait, the expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, but if |ψ⟩ is not normalized, then the state should be normalized before computing the expectation. So perhaps the given state is not normalized, and thus the expectation value will involve the normalization factor.

So let me compute the normalization factor. The inner product ψ† ψ is |3i|^2 + |4|^2 = 9 +16=25. So the norm is 5. So the normalized state is (3i/5,4/5).

So the correct expectation value would be [⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩ ] / (ψ† ψ).

Wait, no, because the expectation value is calculated as (ψ† S_y ψ) divided by the norm squared, which is 25.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The expectation value is (⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩) divided by (⟨ψ|ψ⟩) if the state is not normalized.

Wait, no, no. The expectation value is ⟨ψ| S_y |ψ⟩, but if the state is not normalized, you have to normalize it. So perhaps the correct approach is to first normalize ψ, then compute the expectation value.

Alternatively, the expectation value is (ψ† S_y ψ) divided by (ψ† ψ), because ψ is not normalized. Let me clarify this.

The expectation value is given by (ψ† S_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ), because ψ is a non-normalized state vector. Because the standard expectation formula is ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩ where |ψ⟩ is normalized, i.e., ⟨ψ|ψ⟩=1. Here, since ψ is not normalized, ⟨ψ|ψ⟩=25, so the correct expectation value would be (ψ† S_y ψ)/(ψ† ψ) = (-24) /25 * ħ/2 * 2? Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled up.

Wait, no, earlier I found that ψ† σ_y ψ is -24. So the expectation value of σ_y is -24/25, because ψ† ψ is 25.

So ⟨σ_y⟩ = (ψ† σ_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ) )= (-24)/25.

Then, ⟨S_y⟩ is (ħ/2) * ⟨σ_y⟩ = (ħ/2) * (-24/25) )= (-12 ħ)/25.

Ah, that makes sense. So the expectation value is (-12 ħ)/25, which matches option A.

Wait, so I think I initially forgot that the state wasn't normalized. So I have to normalize it first. So the correct steps are:

1. Compute ψ† ψ = |3i|^2 + |4|^2 =9+16=25. So the norm is 5.

2. The expectation value of σ_y is (ψ† σ_y ψ) / (ψ† ψ) )= (-24)/25.

3. So the expectation value of S_y is (ħ/2) * (-24/25) )= (-12 ħ)/25.

Which is option A.


To find the expectation value of the spin along the y-direction, \( S_y \), for an electron in the spin state \( \psi = (3i, 4) \), we proceed as follows:

### Key Information:
1. The spin operator along the y-direction is \( S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \sigma_y \), where \( \sigma_y \) is the Pauli matrix:
   \[
   \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix}
   0 & -i \\
   i & 0
   \end{pmatrix}.
   \]
2. The expectation value of \( S_y \) is given by:
   \[
   \langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \frac{\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi}.
   \]
   Here, \( \psi^\dagger \) is the conjugate transpose of \( \psi \), and \( \psi^\dagger \psi \) ensures normalization.

### Step 1: Compute \( \psi^\dagger \psi \) (Normalization Factor)
The given spin state is \( \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} \). Its conjugate transpose is:
\[
\psi^\dagger = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The norm squared is:
\[
\psi^\dagger \psi = (-3i)(3i) + (4)(4) = 9 + 16 = 25.
\]
Thus, the normalization factor is \( \psi^\dagger \psi = 25 \).

### Step 2: Compute \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi \)
First, calculate \( \psi^\dagger \sigma_y \):
\[
\psi^\dagger \sigma_y = \begin{pmatrix} -3i & 4 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4i & -3 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Next, multiply by \( \psi \):
\[
\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi = \begin{pmatrix} 4i & -3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix} = (4i)(3i) + (-3)(4) = 12i^2 - 12 = -12 - 12 = -24.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \langle S_y \rangle \)
The expectation value of \( \sigma_y \) is:
\[
\langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\psi^\dagger \sigma_y \psi}{\psi^\dagger \psi} = \frac{-24}{25}.
\]
Thus, the expectation value of \( S_y \) is:
\[
\langle S_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \langle \sigma_y \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cdot \left(-\frac{24}{25}\right) = -\frac{12 \hbar}{25}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The expectation value of \( S_y \) is \( -\frac{12 \hbar}{25} \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
