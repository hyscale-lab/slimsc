Okay, so I've got this question about the Lagrangian in a physics problem. Hmm, let me think about what I know. The question gives a Lagrangian: L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. I need to find the mass dimension of κ and determine if the theory is renormalizable.

Wait, I remember that in quantum field theory, the renormalizability depends on the dimension of the coupling constants. Each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because the action is dimensionless (in natural units where ħ = c = 1). So for each term, the product of the fields and coupling constants should give mass dimension 4.

Let me break down the term. The Lagrangian term is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. I need to find the mass dimension of each component.

First, let's find the mass dimension of ψ (the fermion field). For a Dirac spinor, each ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because in four dimensions, the Dirac equation is first order, so each ψ contributes 3/2.

Next, σ_{μν} is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So σ doesn't contribute to the mass dimension. So ψ̄ σ ψ is like ψ̄ times ψ, so 3/2 + 3/2 = 3. But wait, σ is a product of two gammas, which are matrices, but dimensionless.

Then F^{μν} is the field strength tensor of the electromagnetic field (assuming it's like that since it's antisymmetric). The field strength F has mass dimension 2 because the electromagnetic field tensor is derived from the vector potential A, which has mass dimension 1. The field strength F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, so same dimension as ∂ times A. ∂ has dimension -1 (since it's derivative over mass), so A has dimension 1. So F has dimension 1 + 1 = 2? Wait, no, ∂ has dimension 1 (since mass is dimension 1, derivative is also dimension 1 in terms of M). Wait, wait, no: the derivative is like M^1, right? Because [∂_μ] = M, since the derivative is ∂/∂x which is 1/(x) and x has [M]^−1, so ∂ has [M]^1.

So A has dimension 1 (like a vector field), so each ∂ A is (∂)(A) = M * [A] → [F] = [∂ A] = [M * 1] = M^1. Wait, but wait, F is a tensor, so each F^μν has two indices, but its mass dimension is 2? No, let me think again. The vector potential A has dimension 1. The field strength F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, which would have dimension [∂][A] = (1)(1) = 1. So F has mass dimension 1.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the field tensor F is used in terms like ∫ F^2, which would be dimension 4 for the action. So if F has dimension 2, then (F^2) would be 4, which is correct. Wait, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think about it again.

The action term for the electromagnetic field is L = -(1/4) F_{μν} F^{μν}. Each F has dimension 2 because when you square it, you get dimension 4, which is correct for the Lagrangian. So [F] = 2.

So going back, the term in the Lagrangian is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let's compute the mass dimension of each component.

ψ̄ σ ψ → [ψ̄][σ][ψ]. Since σ is made from gamma matrices (which are dimensionless), [σ] = 0. So [ψ̄][ψ] = (3/2) * (3/2) = 9/4. Then F has dimension 2. So the product is (9/4) * 2 = 9/2. Then we have κ multiplied by this. The entire Lagrangian term must have dimension 4 because each term in the Lagrangian has to have [L] = 4. So [κ] * [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = [κ] * (9/2) = 4.

Solving for [κ], which is the mass dimension of κ: [κ] = 4 * (2/9) = 8/9? Wait, that can't be right, because all the options have [κ] as either 1 or -1. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, maybe I messed up the dimension of F. Let me double-check. The Maxwell term is (F^2), which is in the action. The Lagrangian has dimension 4. So each F must have dimension 2 because (F)^2 * d^4x is dimensionless. So [F] = 2.

But wait, wait, the term in the Lagrangian is F^2, so each F is dimension 2 because [F]^2 = 4, so [F] is 2. So that part is correct.

So let me recompute the dimensions:

Each ψ has [ψ] = 3/2, so [ψ̄] is the same as [ψ], since it's the adjoint. So ψ̄ σ ψ would have [ψ̄][σ][ψ] = (3/2)^2 = 9/4. Then F has 2, so the product ψ̄σψ F has dimension (9/4) * 2 = 9/2. Multiply by κ, so [κ] * (9/2) = 4. Thus [κ] = (4 * 2) / 9 = 8/9 ≈ 0.888. But that's not among the options given (options are -1 or 1 for [κ]). So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in counting the dimension of the term. Let me see.

Wait, the term is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

The ψ̄ is a spinor, so dimension 3/2. σ is a product of gamma matrices, so dimensionless. F^{μν} is a field strength tensor, which has dimension 2. So ψ̄ σ ψ contributes (3/2) * 2 (since σ is spinor indices and ψ̄ and ψ are each 3/2), wait, no, wait. Let me think about the actual dimensions:

The term ψ̄ σ ψ is a scalar. Because ψ̄ is (Dirac adjoint), which has dimension 3/2. The σ_{μν} is a tensor made from [γ_μ, γ_ν], which is dimensionless. So ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension (3/2) + (3/2) = 3, because each ψ is 3/2, and σ is 0.

Then F^{μν} is a tensor with each F_{μν} having dimension 2, as we determined. So the product ψ̄ σ ψ F has dimension 3 + 2 = 5. But the Lagrangian term must be dimension 4, so κ must have dimension 4 -5 = -1. Because [L] = [κ] + [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = 4. So [κ] = 4 - [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = 4 -5 = -1.

Ah, okay, that makes sense. So [κ] is -1. So the first part is that [κ] is -1.

Now, the second part is whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizability depends on whether the coupling has positive mass dimension or not. Wait, wait, no. The general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if its coupling has a mass dimension ≤ d/2, where d is the spacetime dimension. Wait, in 4 dimensions, d=4, so couplings must have dimension ≤ 2. Wait, but for a theory to be renormalizable, all the interactions must have coupling constants with positive mass dimension.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The mass dimension of the coupling must be ≥ d - (sum of fields in the term - interaction term). Or, another approach: For a term in the Lagrangian like g φ^n, the coupling g must have dimension [g] = d - (n-1) * [φ], because each φ has some dimension.

Wait, another approach: In 4 dimensions, a renormalizable theory requires that the coupling constant has a mass dimension ≥ 0. Because when you compute the superficial degree of divergence, a coupling with negative mass dimension leads to a non-renormalizable interaction, which leads to a theory that is not renormalizable.

So for a coupling κ with [κ] = -1, that's negative. So the interaction term would have a coupling with negative dimension, which implies that the interaction is non-renormalizable. Because renormalizable terms have couplings with non-negative dimensions.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the general rule. The superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = d - (n -1)[φ] - [g], where n is the number of fields in the term and g is the coupling.

Wait, perhaps another way: Each interaction term L must have mass dimension 4. For a term with m fields and a coupling g, the mass dimension is [g] + m [φ] = 4. For the term to be renormalizable, the mass dimension of the coupling [g] must be ≥ 0. Because if [g] is negative, then as the energy scale increases, the coupling becomes stronger, leading to a Landau pole and non-predictive theory.

So in our case, the term is L = κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. The product has dimension 5, so κ must have dimension -1. So [κ] = -1.

Since [κ] < 0, the interaction is non-renormalizable. So the theory is not renormalizable.

So from the options given:

Options are:

A) [κ]=-1, renormalizable.

B) [κ]=1, renormalizable.

C) [κ]=-1, not ren.

D) [κ]=1, not ren.

So our conclusion is [κ] =-1 and not renormalizable. So the correct option is option C.

To determine the mass dimension of $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$. 

### Step 1: Mass dimension of $\kappa$
In quantum field theory, the Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions. The term $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes as follows:
- Each fermion field $\psi$ has mass dimension $\frac{3}{2}$.
- $\sigma_{\mu\nu}$ is constructed from $\gamma$-matrices, which are dimensionless.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension 2.

Thus, the mass dimension of $\bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ is:
\[
\left[\bar{\psi}\right] + \left[\psi\right] + \left[F^{\mu\nu}\right] = \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 5.
\]
Since the Lagrangian term must have mass dimension 4, the coupling constant $\kappa$ must satisfy:
\[
\left[\kappa\right] + 5 = 4 \implies \left[\kappa\right] = -1.
\]

### Step 2: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. In this case, $\kappa$ has a mass dimension of $-1$, which is negative. This implies that the interaction term is non-renormalizable, as the coupling becomes stronger at higher energy scales, leading to a breakdown of predictivity.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $-1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.

The field strength F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, so same dimension as ∂ times A. ∂ has dimension -1 (since it's derivative over mass), so A has dimension 1. So F has dimension 1 + 1 = 2? Wait, no, ∂ has dimension 1 (since mass is dimension 1, derivative is also dimension 1 in terms of M). Wait, wait, no: the derivative is like M^1, right? Because [∂_μ] = M, since the derivative is ∂/∂x which is 1/(x) and x has [M]^−1, so ∂ has [M]^1.

So A has dimension 1 (like a vector field), so each ∂ A is (∂)(A) = M * [A] → [F] = [∂ A] = [M * 1] = M^1. Wait, but wait, F is a tensor, so each F^μν has two indices, but its mass dimension is 2? No, let me think again. The vector potential A has dimension 1. The field strength F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, which would have dimension [∂][A] = (1)(1) = 1. So F has mass dimension 1.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because the field tensor F is used in terms like ∫ F^2, which would be dimension 4 for the action. So if F has dimension 2, then (F^2) would be 4, which is correct. Wait, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Let me think about it again.

The action term for the electromagnetic field is L = -(1/4) F_{μν} F^{μν}. Each F has dimension 2 because when you square it, you get dimension 4, which is correct for the Lagrangian. So [F] = 2.

So going back, the term in the Lagrangian is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. Let's compute the mass dimension of each component.

Then we have κ multiplied by this. The entire Lagrangian term must have dimension 4 because each term in the Lagrangian has to have [L] = 4. So [κ] * [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = [κ] * (9/2) = 4.

Solving for [κ], which is the mass dimension of κ: [κ] = 4 * (2/9) = 8/9? Wait, that can't be right, because all the options have [κ] as either 1 or -1. Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in my calculations.

Ah, okay, that makes sense. So [κ] is -1. So the first part is that [κ] is -1.

Now, the second part is whether the theory is renormalizable. Renormalizability depends on whether the coupling has positive mass dimension or not. Wait, wait, no. The general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian is renormalizable if its coupling has a mass dimension ≤ d/2, where d is the spacetime dimension. Wait, in 4 dimensions, d=4, so couplings must have dimension ≤ 2. Wait, but for a theory to be renormalizable, all the interactions must have coupling constants with positive mass dimension.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The mass dimension of the coupling must be ≥ d - (sum of fields in the term - interaction term). Or, another approach: For a term in the Lagrangian like g φ^n, the coupling g must have dimension [g] = d - (n-1) * [φ], because each φ has some dimension.

Wait, another approach: In 4 dimensions, a renormalizable theory requires that the coupling constant has a mass dimension ≥ 0. Because when you compute the superficial degree of divergence, a coupling with negative mass dimension leads to a non-renormalizable interaction, which leads to a theory that is not renormalizable.

So for a coupling κ with [κ] = -1, that's negative. So the interaction term would have a coupling with negative dimension, which implies that the interaction is non-renormalizable. Because renormalizable terms have couplings with non-negative dimensions.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the general rule. The superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = d - (n -1)[φ] - [g], where n is the number of fields in the term and g is the coupling.

Wait, perhaps another way: Each interaction term L must have mass dimension 4. For a term with m fields and a coupling g, the mass dimension is [g] + m [φ] = 4. For the term to be renormalizable, the mass dimension of the coupling [g] must be ≥ 0. Because if [g] is negative, then as the energy scale increases, the coupling becomes stronger, leading to a Landau pole and non-predictive theory.

So in our case, the term is L = κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. The product has dimension 5, so κ must have dimension -1. So [κ] = -1.

Since [κ] < 0, the interaction is non-renormalizable. So the theory is not renormalizable.

So from the options given:

Options are:

A) [κ]=-1, renormalizable.

B) [κ]=1, renormalizable.

C) [κ]=-1, not ren.
