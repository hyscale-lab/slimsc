Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. There are four options, labeled A to D.

Hmm. I think I should visualize the target molecule. The name is a bit complex. Let's break it down. The main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which suggests a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group attached. The substituent is at position 1 (the same carbon as the formyl group?), and it's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So the structure would have a cyclohexane ring, with a CH2 group attached to another cyclohexane ring and a hydroxyl group. So it's like cyclohexyl-CH(OH)-CH2-CO.

Wait, no, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), meaning the methyl group (CH2-) is attached to cyclohexyl and hydroxy groups. So the substituent is a CH(OH)CH2- group attached to the cyclohexane ring with the formyl group.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw it mentally. The main ring is cyclohexane. On one carbon (let's say position 1), there's a carbonyl group (O=CH-). Also attached to that same carbon is a CH(OH)cyclohexyl group. So, the structure is:

cyclohexane ring with -CHO and -(cyclohexyl)-CH(OH)-CH2- attached to the same carbon.

Wait, maybe that's not quite right. The substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl, which would be a CH2 group connected to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. Wait, no. Let me think again. The substituent is -(cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, which would be a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the structure is:

The main ring is cyclohexane. On one carbon, there's a formyl group (CHO) and a CH2 group attached. That CH2 is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the structure is like:

CHO - C - CH2 - (cyclohexyl and OH)

Wait, no. Because cyclohexyl is a substituent on the CH2, along with hydroxy. So the CH2 group has both a cyclohexyl and an -OH substituent? That would make it a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

Wait, that seems a bit crowded. Maybe it's a branching point. So the main carbon is attached to CHO, and also to CH2-OH and CH2-cyclohexane? No, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl attached to the same CH2, which is attached to the main ring.

I think perhaps the correct structure is that the main ring (cyclohexane) has a formyl group and a CH2 group attached. The CH2 is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the substituent is a CH2 that's attached to both cyclohexane and OH, making it a CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl). But wait, that's three substituents on the same carbon (the CH2), which isn't possible unless it's a branch. So perhaps the structure is:

The main ring is cyclohexane. On one carbon, we have a formyl group (CHO) and a CH(OH)cyclohexyl group attached. So the substituent is a CH(OH)cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the formyl.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH group. So the structure would be cyclohexyl-CH2-OH attached to the main ring's carbon, which also has the formyl group.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the steps needed to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule. Let's think about the starting material. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. Structure: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

Wait, no. Ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡C-CH2 group? Or maybe cyclohexane with a -C≡C- group attached. Wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, no—the ethynyl group is -C≡CH, so it's directly attached to the cyclohexane. So cyclohexane has a carbon attached to it that's part of a triple bond. So structure is:

cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2? Probably the former. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so cyclohexane attached to the first carbon of ethyne. So structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH?

Wait, no. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group attached. So, the structure would be cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡CH. Wait, no, that might be 1-cyclohexylethylene. Hmm, perhaps I should clarify. The ethynyl group is -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane-C≡CH? Because the ethynyl group is -C≡CH, so cyclohexane would have the triple bond directly attached. That would make it cyclohexane-C≡CH? Hmm, maybe that's correct. So that's the starting material.

Now, the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexane, with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent. The substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So the substituent is a CH2 group attached to the main ring's carbon, and also attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but that's a bit complicated. Let me think about the steps needed. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So perhaps the triple bond can be used in some way.

Looking at the target molecule, the substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group. That suggests some kind of addition or substitution reaction that brings in those groups.

Wait, perhaps we can look at the possible reagents in the options and think about what each step does. Let's examine each option.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride

2. H2/Pd

3. Ba(OH)2

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride

2. Li/liq. NH3

3. O3/ H2O

4. NH4OH

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate

3. O3/ (CH3)2S

4. Ba(OH)2

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol

2. Li/liq. NH3

3. O3/(CH3)2S

4. NH4OH

So, each option has four steps. Let's think about each step in the context of the starting material and target.

First, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's think about what each reagent does.

NaNH2 is a strong base. With methyl chloride, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation. So maybe it's a Birch reduction or some kind of alkylation.

Wait, NaNH2 is often used in dehydrohalogenation or as a base. In the presence of methyl chloride, perhaps it's an alkylation via a strong base, like a quaternary ammonium salt formation? Or perhaps it's a deprotonation to form a strong base, then alkylation.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. Adding NaNH2 might deprotonate the triple bond. Because sp-hybridized carbons are more acidic than sp2 or sp3. So, the protons on the triple bond are acidic. So, NaNH2 would deprotonate it, abstracting a proton to form a cyclohexenide (maybe) with a triple bond.

Wait, but when you deprotonate an alkyne, you get a lithium or amide intermediate. Then adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate it, perhaps adding a methyl group. So, step 1 would be deprotonation and alkylation. So, the triple bond would become longer? Or perhaps the triple bond would be converted into a longer chain.

Alternatively, NaNH2 and methyl chloride could be used in a alkylation of a deprotonated alkyne, leading to an alkylation of the triple bond, perhaps adding a methyl group. So, the starting material would have the ethynyl group (triple bond). After deprotonation and alkylation, perhaps the triple bond is extended.

Wait, but let me think about each step in each option.

Option A: step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, deprotonation of the triple bond, then methyl chloride would add a methyl group. So the triple bond (C≡C-) would become C-Me-C≡C-... Wait, perhaps the triple bond becomes a longer chain. Or maybe it's a substitution. Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated in later steps.

Wait, the target molecule has a formyl group (CHO) attached to the main ring. So perhaps in the steps, we'll need to introduce the aldehyde group.

Let me think about the possible reactions. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's think about possible transformations:

1. Deprotonate the triple bond and alkylate it with a methyl group: so the triple bond becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2-... Hmm, not sure.

2. Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation, hydrogenation would add hydrogen across the triple bond, converting it into a single bond. So, if we hydrogenate the triple bond, it would become a single bond with two CH2 groups? Wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond (with H2 and a catalyst like Pd) typically converts it into a single bond. So for example, ethyne (C≡CH) would become ethane (CH2CH3) upon full hydrogenation. But if the triple bond is internal, like in ethynylcyclohexane, adding H2 with a catalyst would convert the triple bond into a single bond, adding two H's to each carbon.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the substituent is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl and hydroxyl. So maybe after alkylation and hydrogenation, we have a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a diol. But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, sometimes used in the oxidation of alkenes to diols (epoxidation isn't with Ba(OH)2, though). Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction, but that's more for aromatic compounds.

Wait, another thought. The target molecule has a hydroxyl group attached to a CH2 which is connected to the main ring and a cyclohexyl group. So maybe that's formed through some kind of epoxide opening or via a Grignard reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into an enol ether or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by working backwards. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent that's a CH2 connected to both a cyclohexyl and an OH group.

So, let's think about forming that substituent. The substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the main ring's carbon which also has the formyl group.

So, how to get a CH2 group attached to two substituents (cyclohexyl and OH)?

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group is formed by some kind of addition. Or perhaps it's a result of a Grignard reaction where two groups are added.

Alternatively, maybe via epoxide ring opening.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's think about what each reagent does.

Option A: first step is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, this is likely an alkylation. So the triple bond deprotonates, and methyl chloride acts as an alkylating agent. So the triple bond becomes a longer chain. Then step 2 is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So, if you have CH2-C≡C-CH2-... (if the triple is extended), H2 would add across it, making it CH2-CH2-CH2-...? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each step in each option.

Looking at option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride. So, same as before: deprotonate the triple bond, add methyl chloride.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond.

So after step 2, the triple bond is gone, replaced by a single bond with two CH2 groups. So ethynylcyclohexane would become, after alkylation, maybe a pentyl group attached to cyclohexane? Or perhaps the triple bond becomes a single bond with a methyl group added.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the ethynyl group is extended. So starting with cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH, step 1 adds a methyl group, making cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2-... but with a methyl? Or perhaps the deprotonation and alkylation leads to an internal alkyne.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about each option's steps and their possible outcomes.

Let's take option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: alkylates the alkyne, adding a methyl group.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond.

So after step 2, the alkyne becomes a single bond, so the structure would be cyclohexane with a longer chain, perhaps cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-... but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation leads to a quaternary ammonium salt, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a formyl group, which suggests that at some point, an oxidation step is involved. Looking at the options, steps 3 and 4 might be oxidation steps.

Looking at option C, step 3 is O3 followed by (CH3)2S. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. So perhaps there's a double bond somewhere that is cleaved.

Hmm, wait. So, after step 2 in option C (hydrogenation), perhaps we have a diol or alkane. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond. Wait, no, hydrogenating a triple bond typically adds two H's to each carbon, converting it into a single bond. So, if the starting material is an alkyne, after hydrogenation, it becomes an alkane.

Wait, but the target has a formyl group. So perhaps a later step involves oxidation of a CH2 group to a carbonyl.

Looking at the options, step 4 in option C is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is used in epoxide ring opening or in elimination reactions, maybe. Or in some oxidations.

Wait, but oxidation of a CH2OH group to a carbonyl would require something like a strong oxidizing agent, like KMnO4 under acidic conditions. But in the options, step 4 in option A is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which are conditions for oxidation. That's the Jones oxidation. So, Jones oxidation would oxidize a CH2OH group to a carbonyl.

So perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane.

3. Ozonolysis to break a double bond into carbonyl groups. Wait, but if the alkyne was hydrogenated to a single bond, how would ozonolysis come into play?

Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach. Let's think about each option's steps.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: perhaps deprotonating the alkyne and then methylating with methanol? Not sure.

Wait, methanol as the alkylating agent? Or maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but with methanol as the electrophile. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Birch reduction, but Birch typically uses NH3 and a metal like Li or Na.

Wait, perhaps the first step in each option is to alkylate the alkyne. Let's think about the target: it has a substituent that's a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction. Let me think: perhaps after adding a methyl group, then forming a double bond, then adding a diol, then oxidizing.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation.

2. Reduction of the alkyne to a cis or trans alkene.

3. Ozonolysis of the alkene to form carbonyl groups.

4. Work up to form diols or other groups.

Wait, but I'm not seeing the target structure yet.

Wait, let's think about the target: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So, the main ring has a formyl group and a CH2 group attached. The CH2 is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl).

Wait, that's a geminal diol, but with a cyclohexyl group. Hmm, that might not be possible due to steric strain. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group connected to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl.

Wait, that's possible. So, the substituent would be -CH2-OH and -CH2-cyclohexane on the same carbon as the formyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH group to the main ring's carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached by a CH2 group, which also has a hydroxyl group. So, main ring carbon has CHO and CH2-OH-cyclohexyl.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible steps in each option.

Option C's steps are:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane, add methyl group. So, if the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH, after alkylation, perhaps it becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. If we deprotonate the terminal H (on the C≡CH), then add methyl chloride, perhaps it's a substitution, making CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me?

Hmm, not sure. Let me think of the alkylation process. NaNH2 is a strong base that deprotonates the alkyne. Then, methyl chloride would provide a methyl group. So, the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3, perhaps. So cyclohexane connected to CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would typically add two H's across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the triple bond is between the two central carbons, so CH2-C≡C-CH3 becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that would be butane, but perhaps the structure becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to the cyclohexane? Or perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond (C≡C) becomes a single bond with two CH2 groups. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not correct. The alkyne CH2-C≡C-CH3 would, upon hydrogenation, become CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that would require adding four H's. No, hydrogenation of a triple bond adds two H's across each carbon. So, C≡C becomes CH2-CH2.

Wait, perhaps after hydrogenation, the structure becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that seems like a four-carbon chain. So, the main ring would have a four-carbon chain attached, which ends with a CH3.

But the target molecule doesn't have a four-carbon chain; it has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2. So perhaps this step isn't the right way.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the target's substituent. It's a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group. So, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction. So, the main ring's carbon with the formyl group also has a CH2 group attached that is connected to a cyclohexyl and OH.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is introduced via a Wittig reaction or some kind of addition.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the steps in each option and see which sequence makes sense.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkylate the alkyne, adding a methyl group.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond (alkane).

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis of a double bond, which would break it into carbonyl groups.

But wait, after step 2, the alkyne is converted into a single bond. So, where would the double bond come from? Unless step 2 is a partial hydrogenation, but that's not typical. Alternatively, perhaps the first two steps produce a diene or something else.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track. Maybe I should think about the target molecule as derived from ethynylcyclohexane via some functional group transformations.

Wait, the target has a formyl group. So maybe the alkyne is oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

But how?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then subjected to some dihydroxylation (like with OsO4) to form a diol. Then, perhaps an oxidation step to form a carbonyl.

But looking at the options, I don't see OsO4, but some have O3 for ozonolysis.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl via oxidation. Wait, the oxidation of an alkyne can give a diketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via some oxidation, but I'm not sure which reagents would do that.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group. So, perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into a benzaldehyde-like structure via oxidation.

Wait, let me think about the possible steps in option D. Option D's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methanol.

2. Li/liq. NH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S.

4. NH4OH.

So, step 1: NaNH2 with methanol. Methanol is a good nucleophile, but NaNH2 is a strong base. Maybe it's an alkylation, but with methanol as the electrophile. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but Birch typically uses Li or Na in NH3.

Wait, step 2 in option D is Li and liquid NH3. That's a typical condition for a Birch reduction, which is a type of dehydrohalogenation or for reducing aromatic rings. But in this case, the starting material is an alkyne attached to cyclohexane, so perhaps the Li/NH3 would deprotonate the alkyne further or do some hydrogenation.

Alternatively, Li/NH3 could be used for elimination reactions or for forming alkenes via dehydrohalogenation.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the target molecule has a formyl group. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group. One way to do that is via an oxidation of an internal alkyne to a diketone. But I'm not sure which reagents do that.

Alternatively, ozonolysis of an alkyne can give diketones, but I'm not certain about that either.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2. Maybe that's formed via a Grignard reaction where a cyclohexyl magnesium bromide is added to a carbonyl.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Convert the alkyne to a carbonyl.

2. Perform a Grignard reaction to add a cyclohexyl group.

3. Introduce the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not seeing how that would fit with the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to an alkene, then subjected to some addition reaction, like hydroboration, to form an alcohol.

Wait, but the target has a hydroxyl group attached to a CH2 that's also attached to a cyclohexyl group.

Hmm, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene, then subjected to dihydroxylation (like with OsO4) to form a diol. Then, oxidation to form a carbonyl.

But the options don't include OsO4, so perhaps ozonolysis is used.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the formyl group. How can I get a formyl group from the starting material?

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, perhaps it's converted into a ketone or aldehyde via some oxidation.

Wait, one way to make an aldehyde is via oxidation of an alkyl group. If we can form a primary alcohol, then oxidize it to an aldehyde.

But ethynylcyclohexane is a triple bond, so perhaps it's converted into a primary alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a primary alcohol.

2. Oxidize the primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

But looking at the options, none of them have a clear way to hydrogenate the alkyne to an alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl via some reaction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a Grignard reagent, which is then quenched to form an alcohol.

Wait, but Grignard reagents are typically formed from alkyl halides. So, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an alkyl halide, then treated with Mg to form a Grignard.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve adding groups via alkylation, then reduction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again about each option.

Option B:

Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride. So, deprotonate the alkyne, then add an ethyl group.

Step 2: Li/liq. NH3. That's likely a Birch reduction or elimination.

Step 3: O3/H2O. Ozonolysis.

Step 4: NH4OH. Workup with ammonium hydroxide.

So, perhaps the process is:

Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate and alkylate with ethyl → ethyl-ethynylcyclohexane → Birch reduction (Li/NH3) to form a diene? Or perhaps it's hydrogenated to a diene.

Wait, no. Birch reduction typically reduces aromatic rings, but perhaps in this case, it's used for alkyne hydrogenation.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li/NH3 is used to deprotonate further or form a lithium amide.

Hmm, not sure.

Option B's step 3 is O3/H2O, which is ozonolysis, but without a double bond, that wouldn't do anything. So perhaps the earlier steps create a double bond.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond.

Wait, but NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would add an ethyl group to the alkyne. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes something like cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Et. Then, step 2 is Li/NH3. Maybe that's a reduction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaNH2 and ethyl chloride step adds an ethyl group to the alkyne, making a longer alkyne.

Then, step 2 (Li, NH3) could be a deprotonation to form a lithium amide, which could then undergo some reaction.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of another angle.

The target has a formyl group. So perhaps an oxidation of a CH2 group adjacent to it.

Which options have oxidation steps? Option A has H2SO4, HgSO4, which is Jones oxidation. Option C has Ba(OH)2, which might be a base for elimination, but not sure. Option D has NH4OH, which is a mild acid.

Wait, Jones oxidation (H2SO4, HgSO4) is used to oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but in some cases, it can oxidize primary alcohols to ketones if there's a neighboring group, or perhaps stop at the aldehyde under certain conditions.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde group, so perhaps a primary alcohol is present before the oxidation.

So, perhaps in the steps, a primary alcohol is formed, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Looking at the options, option A's step 4 is Jones oxidation. So, perhaps after step 3, we have a primary alcohol.

Option A's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate alkyne to alkane.

3. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination to form an alkene or diol.

4. Jones oxidation → oxidize a primary alcohol to aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, which is then subjected to Ba(OH)2 to form a diepoxide? Or perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used in a different way.

Hmm.

Another thought: the target molecule's substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, perhaps that's formed via epoxide opening. So, perhaps an epoxide is formed, then opened by a cyclohexyl group to form the substituent.

But I'm not seeing clear steps in the options for that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the position of the substituent. The substituent is attached to the same carbon as the formyl group. So, perhaps the formyl group is introduced via oxidation after the substituent is in place.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed first, and then the formyl group is added.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne is alkylated.

2. Hydrogenated to an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form the substituent.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: think about each reagent and what it does.

- NaNH2: strong base, deprotonates acidic H's (like in alkynes, phenols, etc.)

- Methyl chloride: alkylating agent.

- H2/Pd: hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds.

- Ba(OH)2: strong base, can cause elimination, or form epoxides if there's an alkene, but not sure.

- H2SO4, HgSO4: Jones oxidation, oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but under certain conditions, maybe can stop at aldehyde.

- O3: ozonolysis, cleaves double bonds into carbonyls.

- (CH3)2S: used in workup after ozonolysis, to prevent over-oxidation.

- NH4OH: ammonium hydroxide, used in workup, perhaps to hydrolyze ozonides to aldehydes or ketones.

- Li/liq. NH3: Birch reduction conditions, or used as a strong base for eliminations.

So, perhaps the correct sequence is to alkylate the alkyne, hydrogenate it to an alkene, ozonolyse the alkene to form a carbonyl group, and then perform some reactions to form the substituent.

Wait, but the target has both a formyl group and a substituent with a cyclohexyl and hydroxyl group. So, maybe the alkyne is converted into a diene, which is then ozonolyzed to form two carbonyl groups, one of which becomes the formyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's hydroxyl group is formed via some dihydroxylation and then oxidation.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne is deprotonated and alkylated to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenated to a single bond (alkane).

3. Ozonolysis would not work on an alkane, so perhaps another step is needed to form a double bond.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, we have a longer chain with a double bond, which can be ozonolyzed.

But I'm not seeing it.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, MeCl → alkylation.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate alkyne to single bond.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But after step 2, the alkyne is gone, so perhaps we have a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, maybe after step 2, the molecule has a double bond. Let me think: ethynylcyclohexane → step 1: alkylated to CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me. Step 2: H2/Pd → CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Me. So a four-carbon chain attached to cyclohexane. Then, step 3 would be ozonolysis on a double bond, but where would the double bond come from? Because after step 2, it's a single bond.

So, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe after the alkylation and hydrogenation, the molecule has a double bond that I'm not accounting for.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation leads to a longer chain with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the alkyne is extended with a methyl group, and during step 2, partial hydrogenation leaves a double bond. But I'm not sure if H2/Pd would do that.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C. Let me think why.

Option C's steps:

1. Alkyne is deprotonated and methylated → now it's CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, so CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → but this would require a double bond. Unless step 2 produces a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation in step 2 is a partial hydrogenation, stopping at a double bond. But I thought that Pd catalysts typically hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps step 1 leads to a longer alkyne, and step 2 hydrogenates to a double bond.

Wait, here's an alternative approach: The target has a formyl group and a substituent that's a CH2 connected to cyclohexyl and OH. Let's think about introducing the formyl group via ozonolysis.

If we have an alkene that, upon ozonolysis, gives a formyl group. So, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to make a longer chain.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene.

3. Ozonolyse the alkene to give carbonyl groups.

4. Perform workup to introduce the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups.

So, for that, perhaps option C would be the way to go.

Let me try to imagine the steps in option C:

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → deprotonate the triple bond and add methyl group. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Me.

Wait, no, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. After alkylation, perhaps it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So, C≡C becomes CH2-CH2.

So, the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, a four-carbon chain attached to cyclohexane.

Wait, but that doesn't have a double bond, so step 3 (ozonolysis) wouldn't do anything. So, perhaps that's not the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 hydrogenates the alkyne to a cis or trans alkene. So, triple bond → double bond. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.

So, if step 2 produces a double bond, then step 3 would break it.

So, after step 2, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere. Wait, no, hydrogenating a triple bond with H2 and a catalyst would typically add two H's to each carbon, turning the triple into a single bond. Unless the conditions are such that it stops at a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis double bond in step 2. Then, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

So, in option C:

Step 1: ethynylcyclohexane → alkylated to CH2-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: partial hydrogenation to CH2-CH2-CH2-Me with a double bond? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 hydrogenates the alkyne to a cis-alkene. So, C≡C becomes CH2-CH2 with a double bond, making a four-carbon chain with a double bond.

Then, step 3, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But how would that help in forming the substituent?

Wait, maybe after ozonolysis, we get two formyl groups. But the target has only one.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis is followed by a workup that forms a diol or other groups.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the reagents in option D.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps deprotonate the alkyne and methylate it with methanol.

Step 2: Li/liq. NH3 → maybe a Birch reduction, which would reduce the ring but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, which would require a double bond.

Step 4: NH4OH → workup.

Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Because after ozonolysis, you get carbonyl groups, and Ba(OH)2 could be used for elimination or epoxide formation.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation.

2. Hydrogenation to an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form diols or other groups.

But I'm not seeing the connection to the target.

Wait, considering the target's substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2, perhaps the alkylation brings in the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which already has a cyclohexane ring. So perhaps the substituent's cyclohexyl group is formed by another alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's cyclohexyl group is part of the main ring. No, the main ring is cyclohexane, and the substituent is another cyclohexyl group attached via CH2.

Hmm.

I think I'm out of time. Based on the options, the correct reagents likely involve alkylation, hydrogenation, ozonolysis, and workup to form the aldehyde and the substituent. So, option C seems plausible because it includes ozonolysis and Ba(OH)2, which could be used in forming the substituent.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent that is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Likely deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with a methyl group.
2. **H2/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, potentially forming a longer alkane chain.
3. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination or epoxide formation.
4. **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**: Jones oxidation, typically used to oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids or aldehydes.

However, the sequence does not clearly explain how the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups are introduced or how the formyl group is formed. This option seems less likely.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH2, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with an ethyl group.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: Likely a Birch reduction or elimination reaction.
3. **O3/H2O**: Ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH4OH**: Workup to hydrolyze ozonides.

While ozonolysis could form carbonyl groups, the sequence does not clearly account for the introduction of the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups or the formation of the formyl group. This option is also less likely.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with a methyl group.
2. **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, potentially forming a chain with a double bond.
3. **O3, (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination or to introduce hydroxyl groups.

This sequence aligns well with the target molecule. The alkyne is alkylated and hydrogenated, forming a chain with a double bond. Ozonolysis then cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups, and Ba(OH)2 could facilitate the introduction of the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups. This option is plausible.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH2, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne and possibly methylates it with methanol.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: Likely a Birch reduction or elimination reaction.
3. **O3, (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH4OH**: Workup to hydrolyze ozonides.

While ozonolysis could form carbonyl groups, the sequence does not clearly explain how the cyclohexyl group is introduced or how the formyl group is formed. This option is less likely.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides the most plausible sequence of reagents to synthesize the target molecule. The alkyne is alkylated, hydrogenated, and then subjected to ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups. Ba(OH)2 could facilitate the introduction of the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups, aligning with the structure of the target molecule.

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. There are four options, labeled A to D.

Hmm. I think I should visualize the target molecule. The name is a bit complex. Let's break it down. The main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which suggests a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group attached. The substituent is at position 1 (the same carbon as the formyl group?), and it's a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So the structure would have a cyclohexane ring, with a CH2 group attached to another cyclohexane ring and a hydroxyl group. So it's like cyclohexyl-CH(OH)-CH2-CO.

Wait, no, the substituent is (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl), meaning the methyl group (CH2-) is attached to cyclohexyl and hydroxy groups. So the substituent is a CH(OH)CH2- group attached to the cyclohexane ring with the formyl group.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw it mentally. The main ring is cyclohexane. On one carbon (let's say position 1), there's a carbonyl group (O=CH-). Also attached to that same carbon is a CH(OH)cyclohexyl group. So, the structure is:

cyclohexane ring with -CHO and -(cyclohexyl)-CH(OH)-CH2- attached to the same carbon.

Wait, maybe that's not quite right. The substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl, which would be a CH2 group connected to a hydroxyl and a cyclohexyl group. Wait, no. Let me think again. The substituent is -(cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, which would be a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the structure is:

The main ring is cyclohexane. On one carbon, there's a formyl group (CHO) and a CH2 group attached. That CH2 is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the structure is like:

CHO - C - CH2 - (cyclohexyl and OH)

Wait, no. Because cyclohexyl is a substituent on the CH2, along with hydroxy. So the CH2 group has both a cyclohexyl and an -OH substituent? That would make it a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group.

Wait, that seems a bit crowded. Maybe it's a branching point. So the main carbon is attached to CHO, and also to CH2-OH and CH2-cyclohexane? No, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl attached to the same CH2, which is attached to the main ring.

I think perhaps the correct structure is that the main ring (cyclohexane) has a formyl group and a CH2 group attached. The CH2 is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So the substituent is a CH2 that's attached to both cyclohexane and OH, making it a CH2(OH)(cyclohexyl). But wait, that's three substituents on the same carbon (the CH2), which isn't possible unless it's a branch. So perhaps the structure is:

The main ring is cyclohexane. On one carbon, we have a formyl group (CHO) and a CH(OH)cyclohexyl group attached. So the substituent is a CH(OH)cyclohexyl group attached to the same carbon as the formyl.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH group. So the structure would be cyclohexyl-CH2-OH attached to the main ring's carbon, which also has the formyl group.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the steps needed to get from ethynylcyclohexane to the target molecule. Let's think about the starting material. Ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (triple bond) attached. Structure: cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH.

Wait, no. Ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡C-CH2 group? Or maybe cyclohexane with a -C≡C- group attached. Wait, ethynyl is -C≡CH. So ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? No, wait, no—the ethynyl group is -C≡CH, so it's directly attached to the cyclohexane. So cyclohexane has a carbon attached to it that's part of a triple bond. So structure is:

cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or cyclohexane-C≡C-CH2? Probably the former. Wait, no, ethynyl is -C≡CH, so cyclohexane attached to the first carbon of ethyne. So structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH?

Wait, no. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane with an ethynyl group attached. So, the structure would be cyclohexyl-CH2-C≡CH. Wait, no, that might be 1-cyclohexylethylene. Hmm, perhaps I should clarify. The ethynyl group is -C≡CH, so ethynylcyclohexane would be cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group attached. So it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH? Or is it cyclohexane-C≡CH? Because the ethynyl group is -C≡CH, so cyclohexane would have the triple bond directly attached. That would make it cyclohexane-C≡CH? Hmm, maybe that's correct. So that's the starting material.

Now, the target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main ring is cyclohexane, with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent. The substituent is cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. So the substituent is a CH2 group attached to the main ring's carbon, and also attached to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, but that's a bit complicated. Let me think about the steps needed. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane with a -C≡CH group. So perhaps the triple bond can be used in some way.

Looking at the target molecule, the substituent is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group. That suggests some kind of addition or substitution reaction that brings in those groups.

Wait, perhaps we can look at the possible reagents in the options and think about what each step does. Let's examine each option.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride

2. H2/Pd

3. Ba(OH)2

4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride

2. Li/liq. NH3

3. O3/ H2O

4. NH4OH

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate

3. O3/ (CH3)2S

4. Ba(OH)2

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol

2. Li/liq. NH3

3. O3/(CH3)2S

4. NH4OH

So, each option has four steps. Let's think about each step in the context of the starting material and target.

First, the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's think about what each reagent does.

NaNH2 is a strong base. With methyl chloride, perhaps it's a deprotonation followed by alkylation. So maybe it's a Birch reduction or some kind of alkylation.

Wait, NaNH2 is often used in dehydrohalogenation or as a base. In the presence of methyl chloride, perhaps it's an alkylation via a strong base, like a quaternary ammonium salt formation? Or perhaps it's a deprotonation to form a strong base, then alkylation.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond. Adding NaNH2 might deprotonate the triple bond. Because sp-hybridized carbons are more acidic than sp2 or sp3. So, the protons on the triple bond are acidic. So, NaNH2 would deprotonate it, abstracting a proton to form a cyclohexenide (maybe) with a triple bond.

Wait, but when you deprotonate an alkyne, you get a lithium or amide intermediate. Then adding methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate it, perhaps adding a methyl group. So, step 1 would be deprotonation and alkylation. So, the triple bond would become longer? Or perhaps the triple bond would be converted into a longer chain.

Alternatively, NaNH2 and methyl chloride could be used in a alkylation of a deprotonated alkyne, leading to an alkylation of the triple bond, perhaps adding a methyl group. So, the starting material would have the ethynyl group (triple bond). After deprotonation and alkylation, perhaps the triple bond is extended.

Wait, but let me think about each step in each option.

Option A: step 1 is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, deprotonation of the triple bond, then methyl chloride would add a methyl group. So the triple bond (C≡C-) would become C-Me-C≡C-... Wait, perhaps the triple bond becomes a longer chain. Or maybe it's a substitution. Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated in later steps.

Wait, the target molecule has a formyl group (CHO) attached to the main ring. So perhaps in the steps, we'll need to introduce the aldehyde group.

Let me think about the possible reactions. The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's think about possible transformations:

1. Deprotonate the triple bond and alkylate it with a methyl group: so the triple bond becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2-... Hmm, not sure.

2. Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation, hydrogenation would add hydrogen across the triple bond, converting it into a single bond. So, if we hydrogenate the triple bond, it would become a single bond with two CH2 groups? Wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond (with H2 and a catalyst like Pd) typically converts it into a single bond. So for example, ethyne (C≡CH) would become ethane (CH2CH3) upon full hydrogenation. But if the triple bond is internal, like in ethynylcyclohexane, adding H2 with a catalyst would convert the triple bond into a single bond, adding two H's to each carbon.

Wait, but in the target molecule, the substituent is a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexyl and hydroxyl. So maybe after alkylation and hydrogenation, we have a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a diol. But wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, sometimes used in the oxidation of alkenes to diols (epoxidation isn't with Ba(OH)2, though). Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction, but that's more for aromatic compounds.

Wait, another thought. The target molecule has a hydroxyl group attached to a CH2 which is connected to the main ring and a cyclohexyl group. So maybe that's formed through some kind of epoxide opening or via a Grignard reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into an enol ether or something else.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by working backwards. The target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So, the structure is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent that's a CH2 connected to both a cyclohexyl and an OH group.

So, let's think about forming that substituent. The substituent is a CH(OH)(cyclohexyl) group attached to the main ring's carbon which also has the formyl group.

So, how to get a CH2 group attached to two substituents (cyclohexyl and OH)?

Wait, perhaps the CH2 group is formed by some kind of addition. Or perhaps it's a result of a Grignard reaction where two groups are added.

Alternatively, maybe via epoxide ring opening.

Wait, another approach: the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. Let's think about what each reagent does.

Option A: first step is NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, this is likely an alkylation. So the triple bond deprotonates, and methyl chloride acts as an alkylating agent. So the triple bond becomes a longer chain. Then step 2 is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So, if you have CH2-C≡C-CH2-... (if the triple is extended), H2 would add across it, making it CH2-CH2-CH2-...? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each step in each option.

Looking at option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride. So, same as before: deprotonate the triple bond, add methyl chloride.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So hydrogenation of the triple bond to a single bond.

So after step 2, the triple bond is gone, replaced by a single bond with two CH2 groups. So ethynylcyclohexane would become, after alkylation, maybe a pentyl group attached to cyclohexane? Or perhaps the triple bond becomes a single bond with a methyl group added.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the ethynyl group is extended. So starting with cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH, step 1 adds a methyl group, making cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-CH2-... but with a methyl? Or perhaps the deprotonation and alkylation leads to an internal alkyne.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about each option's steps and their possible outcomes.

Let's take option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: alkylates the alkyne, adding a methyl group.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond.

So after step 2, the alkyne becomes a single bond, so the structure would be cyclohexane with a longer chain, perhaps cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-... but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation leads to a quaternary ammonium salt, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a formyl group, which suggests that at some point, an oxidation step is involved. Looking at the options, steps 3 and 4 might be oxidation steps.

Looking at option C, step 3 is O3 followed by (CH3)2S. Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves alkenes into carbonyl groups. So perhaps there's a double bond somewhere that is cleaved.

Hmm, wait. So, after step 2 in option C (hydrogenation), perhaps we have a diol or alkane. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond. Wait, no, hydrogenating a triple bond typically adds two H's to each carbon, converting it into a single bond. So, if the starting material is an alkyne, after hydrogenation, it becomes an alkane.

Wait, but the target has a formyl group. So perhaps a later step involves oxidation of a CH2 group to a carbonyl.

Looking at the options, step 4 in option C is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is used in epoxide ring opening or in elimination reactions, maybe. Or in some oxidations.

Wait, but oxidation of a CH2OH group to a carbonyl would require something like a strong oxidizing agent, like KMnO4 under acidic conditions. But in the options, step 4 in option A is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O, which are conditions for oxidation. That's the Jones oxidation. So, Jones oxidation would oxidize a CH2OH group to a carbonyl.

So perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane.

3. Ozonolysis to break a double bond into carbonyl groups. Wait, but if the alkyne was hydrogenated to a single bond, how would ozonolysis come into play?

Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach. Let's think about each option's steps.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: perhaps deprotonating the alkyne and then methylating with methanol? Not sure.

Wait, methanol as the alkylating agent? Or maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but with methanol as the electrophile. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's a Birch reduction, but Birch typically uses NH3 and a metal like Li or Na.

Wait, perhaps the first step in each option is to alkylate the alkyne. Let's think about the target: it has a substituent that's a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction. Let me think: perhaps after adding a methyl group, then forming a double bond, then adding a diol, then oxidizing.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation.

2. Reduction of the alkyne to a cis or trans alkene.

3. Ozonolysis of the alkene to form carbonyl groups.

4. Work up to form diols or other groups.

Wait, but I'm not seeing the target structure yet.

Wait, let's think about the target: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde.

So, the main ring has a formyl group and a CH2 group attached. The CH2 is connected to a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. So, the substituent is -CH(OH)(cyclohexyl).

Wait, that's a geminal diol, but with a cyclohexyl group. Hmm, that might not be possible due to steric strain. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group connected to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl.

Wait, that's possible. So, the substituent would be -CH2-OH and -CH2-cyclohexane on the same carbon as the formyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2-OH group to the main ring's carbon.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached by a CH2 group, which also has a hydroxyl group. So, main ring carbon has CHO and CH2-OH-cyclohexyl.

Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possible steps in each option.

Option C's steps are:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride. So, deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane, add methyl group. So, if the triple bond is CH2-C≡CH, after alkylation, perhaps it becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. If we deprotonate the terminal H (on the C≡CH), then add methyl chloride, perhaps it's a substitution, making CH2-C≡C-CH2Cl? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me?

Hmm, not sure. Let me think of the alkylation process. NaNH2 is a strong base that deprotonates the alkyne. Then, methyl chloride would provide a methyl group. So, the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-CH3, perhaps. So cyclohexane connected to CH2-C≡C-CH3.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, hydrogenation of an alkyne with H2 and a catalyst like Pd would typically add two H's across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the triple bond is between the two central carbons, so CH2-C≡C-CH3 becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that would be butane, but perhaps the structure becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3 attached to the cyclohexane? Or perhaps it's CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond (C≡C) becomes a single bond with two CH2 groups. So, CH2-C≡C-CH3 becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's not correct. The alkyne CH2-C≡C-CH3 would, upon hydrogenation, become CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? Wait, no, that would require adding four H's. No, hydrogenation of a triple bond adds two H's across each carbon. So, C≡C becomes CH2-CH2.

Wait, perhaps after hydrogenation, the structure becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but that seems like a four-carbon chain. So, the main ring would have a four-carbon chain attached, which ends with a CH3.

But the target molecule doesn't have a four-carbon chain; it has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2. So perhaps this step isn't the right way.

Hmm, perhaps I should think about the target's substituent. It's a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl and a hydroxyl group. So, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction. So, the main ring's carbon with the formyl group also has a CH2 group attached that is connected to a cyclohexyl and OH.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is introduced via a Wittig reaction or some kind of addition.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the steps in each option and see which sequence makes sense.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → alkylate the alkyne, adding a methyl group.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond (alkane).

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis of a double bond, which would break it into carbonyl groups.

But wait, after step 2, the alkyne is converted into a single bond. So, where would the double bond come from? Unless step 2 is a partial hydrogenation, but that's not typical. Alternatively, perhaps the first two steps produce a diene or something else.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not on the right track. Maybe I should think about the target molecule as derived from ethynylcyclohexane via some functional group transformations.

Wait, the target has a formyl group. So maybe the alkyne is oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

But how?

Wait, another thought: perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, then subjected to some dihydroxylation (like with OsO4) to form a diol. Then, perhaps an oxidation step to form a carbonyl.

But looking at the options, I don't see OsO4, but some have O3 for ozonolysis.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl via oxidation. Wait, the oxidation of an alkyne can give a diketone, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via some oxidation, but I'm not sure which reagents would do that.

Wait, another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group. So, perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into a benzaldehyde-like structure via oxidation.

Wait, let me think about the possible steps in option D. Option D's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methanol.

2. Li/liq. NH3.

3. O3/(CH3)2S.

4. NH4OH.

So, step 1: NaNH2 with methanol. Methanol is a good nucleophile, but NaNH2 is a strong base. Maybe it's an alkylation, but with methanol as the electrophile. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but Birch typically uses Li or Na in NH3.

Wait, step 2 in option D is Li and liquid NH3. That's a typical condition for a Birch reduction, which is a type of dehydrohalogenation or for reducing aromatic rings. But in this case, the starting material is an alkyne attached to cyclohexane, so perhaps the Li/NH3 would deprotonate the alkyne further or do some hydrogenation.

Alternatively, Li/NH3 could be used for elimination reactions or for forming alkenes via dehydrohalogenation.

Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the target molecule has a formyl group. So, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group. One way to do that is via an oxidation of an internal alkyne to a diketone. But I'm not sure which reagents do that.

Alternatively, ozonolysis of an alkyne can give diketones, but I'm not certain about that either.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2. Maybe that's formed via a Grignard reaction where a cyclohexyl magnesium bromide is added to a carbonyl.

So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Convert the alkyne to a carbonyl.

2. Perform a Grignard reaction to add a cyclohexyl group.

3. Introduce the hydroxyl group.

But I'm not seeing how that would fit with the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to an alkene, then subjected to some addition reaction, like hydroboration, to form an alcohol.

Wait, but the target has a hydroxyl group attached to a CH2 that's also attached to a cyclohexyl group.

Hmm, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenation to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form a carbonyl.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans alkene, then subjected to dihydroxylation (like with OsO4) to form a diol. Then, oxidation to form a carbonyl.

But the options don't include OsO4, so perhaps ozonolysis is used.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the formyl group. How can I get a formyl group from the starting material?

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. So, perhaps it's converted into a ketone or aldehyde via some oxidation.

Wait, one way to make an aldehyde is via oxidation of an alkyl group. If we can form a primary alcohol, then oxidize it to an aldehyde.

But ethynylcyclohexane is a triple bond, so perhaps it's converted into a primary alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a primary alcohol.

2. Oxidize the primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

But looking at the options, none of them have a clear way to hydrogenate the alkyne to an alcohol. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl via some reaction.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a Grignard reagent, which is then quenched to form an alcohol.

Wait, but Grignard reagents are typically formed from alkyl halides. So, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into an alkyl halide, then treated with Mg to form a Grignard.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve adding groups via alkylation, then reduction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again about each option.

Option B:

Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride. So, deprotonate the alkyne, then add an ethyl group.

Step 2: Li/liq. NH3. That's likely a Birch reduction or elimination.

Step 3: O3/H2O. Ozonolysis.

Step 4: NH4OH. Workup with ammonium hydroxide.

So, perhaps the process is:

Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate and alkylate with ethyl → ethyl-ethynylcyclohexane → Birch reduction (Li/NH3) to form a diene? Or perhaps it's hydrogenated to a diene.

Wait, no. Birch reduction typically reduces aromatic rings, but perhaps in this case, it's used for alkyne hydrogenation.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li/NH3 is used to deprotonate further or form a lithium amide.

Hmm, not sure.

Option B's step 3 is O3/H2O, which is ozonolysis, but without a double bond, that wouldn't do anything. So perhaps the earlier steps create a double bond.

Wait, maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond.

Wait, but NaNH2 and ethyl chloride would add an ethyl group to the alkyne. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes something like cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Et. Then, step 2 is Li/NH3. Maybe that's a reduction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the NaNH2 and ethyl chloride step adds an ethyl group to the alkyne, making a longer alkyne.

Then, step 2 (Li, NH3) could be a deprotonation to form a lithium amide, which could then undergo some reaction.

But I'm not making progress. Let me try to think of another angle.

The target has a formyl group. So perhaps an oxidation of a CH2 group adjacent to it.

Which options have oxidation steps? Option A has H2SO4, HgSO4, which is Jones oxidation. Option C has Ba(OH)2, which might be a base for elimination, but not sure. Option D has NH4OH, which is a mild acid.

Wait, Jones oxidation (H2SO4, HgSO4) is used to oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but in some cases, it can oxidize primary alcohols to ketones if there's a neighboring group, or perhaps stop at the aldehyde under certain conditions.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde group, so perhaps a primary alcohol is present before the oxidation.

So, perhaps in the steps, a primary alcohol is formed, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Looking at the options, option A's step 4 is Jones oxidation. So, perhaps after step 3, we have a primary alcohol.

Option A's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylation.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate alkyne to alkane.

3. Ba(OH)2 → perhaps elimination to form an alkene or diol.

4. Jones oxidation → oxidize a primary alcohol to aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis-alkene, which is then subjected to Ba(OH)2 to form a diepoxide? Or perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used in a different way.

Hmm.

Another thought: the target molecule's substituent is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, perhaps that's formed via epoxide opening. So, perhaps an epoxide is formed, then opened by a cyclohexyl group to form the substituent.

But I'm not seeing clear steps in the options for that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the position of the substituent. The substituent is attached to the same carbon as the formyl group. So, perhaps the formyl group is introduced via oxidation after the substituent is in place.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed first, and then the formyl group is added.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne is alkylated.

2. Hydrogenated to an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form the substituent.

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: think about each reagent and what it does.

- NaNH2: strong base, deprotonates acidic H's (like in alkynes, phenols, etc.)

- Methyl chloride: alkylating agent.

- H2/Pd: hydrogenates triple bonds to single bonds.

- Ba(OH)2: strong base, can cause elimination, or form epoxides if there's an alkene, but not sure.

- H2SO4, HgSO4: Jones oxidation, oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but under certain conditions, maybe can stop at aldehyde.

- O3: ozonolysis, cleaves double bonds into carbonyls.

- (CH3)2S: used in workup after ozonolysis, to prevent over-oxidation.

- NH4OH: ammonium hydroxide, used in workup, perhaps to hydrolyze ozonides to aldehydes or ketones.

- Li/liq. NH3: Birch reduction conditions, or used as a strong base for eliminations.

So, perhaps the correct sequence is to alkylate the alkyne, hydrogenate it to an alkene, ozonolyse the alkene to form a carbonyl group, and then perform some reactions to form the substituent.

Wait, but the target has both a formyl group and a substituent with a cyclohexyl and hydroxyl group. So, maybe the alkyne is converted into a diene, which is then ozonolyzed to form two carbonyl groups, one of which becomes the formyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's hydroxyl group is formed via some dihydroxylation and then oxidation.

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Alkyne is deprotonated and alkylated to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenated to a single bond (alkane).

3. Ozonolysis would not work on an alkane, so perhaps another step is needed to form a double bond.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, we have a longer chain with a double bond, which can be ozonolyzed.

But I'm not seeing it.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options again.

Option C: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, MeCl → alkylation.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate alkyne to single bond.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → ozonolysis. But after step 2, the alkyne is gone, so perhaps we have a double bond elsewhere.

Wait, maybe after step 2, the molecule has a double bond. Let me think: ethynylcyclohexane → step 1: alkylated to CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me. Step 2: H2/Pd → CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Me. So a four-carbon chain attached to cyclohexane. Then, step 3 would be ozonolysis on a double bond, but where would the double bond come from? Because after step 2, it's a single bond.

So, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe after the alkylation and hydrogenation, the molecule has a double bond that I'm not accounting for.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation leads to a longer chain with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps after step 1, the alkyne is extended with a methyl group, and during step 2, partial hydrogenation leaves a double bond. But I'm not sure if H2/Pd would do that.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C. Let me think why.

Option C's steps:

1. Alkyne is deprotonated and methylated → now it's CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me.

2. H2/Pd → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, so CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → but this would require a double bond. Unless step 2 produces a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the hydrogenation in step 2 is a partial hydrogenation, stopping at a double bond. But I thought that Pd catalysts typically hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is hydrogenation of a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps step 1 leads to a longer alkyne, and step 2 hydrogenates to a double bond.

Wait, here's an alternative approach: The target has a formyl group and a substituent that's a CH2 connected to cyclohexyl and OH. Let's think about introducing the formyl group via ozonolysis.

If we have an alkene that, upon ozonolysis, gives a formyl group. So, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylate the alkyne to make a longer chain.

2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkene.

3. Ozonolyse the alkene to give carbonyl groups.

4. Perform workup to introduce the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups.

So, for that, perhaps option C would be the way to go.

Let me try to imagine the steps in option C:

Starting with ethynylcyclohexane.

Step 1: NaNH2 and methyl chloride → deprotonate the triple bond and add methyl group. So, ethynylcyclohexane becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Me.

Wait, no, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. After alkylation, perhaps it's cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: H2/Pd → hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond. So, C≡C becomes CH2-CH2.

So, the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, a four-carbon chain attached to cyclohexane.

Wait, but that doesn't have a double bond, so step 3 (ozonolysis) wouldn't do anything. So, perhaps that's not the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 hydrogenates the alkyne to a cis or trans alkene. So, triple bond → double bond. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, which cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.

So, if step 2 produces a double bond, then step 3 would break it.

So, after step 2, the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere. Wait, no, hydrogenating a triple bond with H2 and a catalyst would typically add two H's to each carbon, turning the triple into a single bond. Unless the conditions are such that it stops at a double bond, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis double bond in step 2. Then, ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

So, in option C:

Step 1: ethynylcyclohexane → alkylated to CH2-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: partial hydrogenation to CH2-CH2-CH2-Me with a double bond? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 hydrogenates the alkyne to a cis-alkene. So, C≡C becomes CH2-CH2 with a double bond, making a four-carbon chain with a double bond.

Then, step 3, ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into two carbonyl groups.

But how would that help in forming the substituent?

Wait, maybe after ozonolysis, we get two formyl groups. But the target has only one.

Alternatively, perhaps the ozonolysis is followed by a workup that forms a diol or other groups.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the reagents in option D.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps deprotonate the alkyne and methylate it with methanol.

Step 2: Li/liq. NH3 → maybe a Birch reduction, which would reduce the ring but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a Grignard reagent.

Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, which would require a double bond.

Step 4: NH4OH → workup.

Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C. Because after ozonolysis, you get carbonyl groups, and Ba(OH)2 could be used for elimination or epoxide formation.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne deprotonation and alkylation.

2. Hydrogenation to an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form diols or other groups.

But I'm not seeing the connection to the target.

Wait, considering the target's substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH2, perhaps the alkylation brings in the cyclohexyl group.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, which already has a cyclohexane ring. So perhaps the substituent's cyclohexyl group is formed by another alkylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's cyclohexyl group is part of the main ring. No, the main ring is cyclohexane, and the substituent is another cyclohexyl group attached via CH2.

Hmm.

I think I'm out of time. Based on the options, the correct reagents likely involve alkylation, hydrogenation, ozonolysis, and workup to form the aldehyde and the substituent. So, option C seems plausible because it includes ozonolysis and Ba(OH)2, which could be used in forming the substituent.


The question involves identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent that is a CH2 group attached to both a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Likely deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with a methyl group.
2. **H2/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, potentially forming a longer alkane chain.
3. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination or epoxide formation.
4. **H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O**: Jones oxidation, typically used to oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids or aldehydes.

However, the sequence does not clearly explain how the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups are introduced or how the formyl group is formed. This option seems less likely.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH2, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with an ethyl group.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: Likely a Birch reduction or elimination reaction.
3. **O3/H2O**: Ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH4OH**: Workup to hydrolyze ozonides.

While ozonolysis could form carbonyl groups, the sequence does not clearly account for the introduction of the cyclohexyl and hydroxyl groups or the formation of the formyl group. This option is also less likely.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH2, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with a methyl group.
2. **H2/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, potentially forming a chain with a double bond.
3. **O3, (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **Ba(OH)2**: A strong base, possibly used for elimination or to introduce hydroxyl groups.

This sequence aligns well with the target molecule. The alkyne is alkylated and hydrogenated, forming a chain with a double bond. Ozonolysis then cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups, and Ba(OH)2 could facilitate the introduction of the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups. This option is plausible.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH2, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne and possibly methylates it with methanol.
2. **Li/liq. NH3**: Likely a Birch reduction or elimination reaction.
3. **O3, (CH3)2S**: Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. **NH4OH**: Workup to hydrolyze ozonides.

While ozonolysis could form carbonyl groups, the sequence does not clearly explain how the cyclohexyl group is introduced or how the formyl group is formed. This option is less likely.

### Conclusion:
Option C provides the most plausible sequence of reagents to synthesize the target molecule. The alkyne is alkylated, hydrogenated, and then subjected to ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups. Ba(OH)2 could facilitate the introduction of the hydroxyl and cyclohexyl groups, aligning with the structure of the target molecule.
