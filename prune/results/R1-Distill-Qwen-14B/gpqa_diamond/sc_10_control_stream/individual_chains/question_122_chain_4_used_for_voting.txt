Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and NMR spectroscopy. Let's try to break this down step by step.

The problem starts with acetic acid being treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Hmm, I remember that when acetic acid reacts with bromine in the presence of pyridine and acetic anhydride, it's probably undergoing some kind of acetylation or bromination. Wait, I think bromine is a good electrophile here. Oh, right! Acetic acid can act as a nucleophile. So, pyridine might be acting as a base, absorbing the HBr that's generated during the reaction. Oh wait, but wait—what's the reaction called when acetic acid is treated with bromine? I think it's a bromination, maybe forming an acyl bromide? Or perhaps it's a substitution. Oh wait, another possibility: when acetic acid reacts with bromine, it might be forming the acetyl bromide. But wait, or is it something else? Oh, wait, I remember that the acetylation of something with acetic anhydride usually adds an acetyl group. But here, it's bromine. Hmm. Maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation? No, that's for aromatic rings. Wait, no, acetic acid is just an acid.

Wait, perhaps this is about the bromination of the carboxylic acid. Oh, wait, another thought: the acetylation of the -OH group in acetic acid. Because acetic anhydride can acetylate hydroxyl groups. So, acetic acid has an -OH. If it's treated with acetic anhydride, that would acetylate the -OH, turning it into an acetate ester. But then why is bromine and pyridine present? Oh, I think the reaction is forming the acetyl bromide. Let me think again. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts with acetic anhydride (which is (CH3CO)2O). Wait, but acetic anhydride is typically used to make esters. For example, when a hydroxyl group is present, like in alcohol, acetic anhydride would acetylate it. So, in this case, the acetic acid has an -OH. So when treated with acetic anhydride, perhaps it forms an acetylated compound. But wait, the reaction also involves bromine and pyridine. Oh, maybe it's a mix of reactions.

Wait another angle: Perhaps the acetic acid is undergoing a bromination on the alpha carbon. Because acetic acid has a CH3 group attached to the carbonyl. The alpha position is the CH3. Bromine is a good electrophile, so it could add there. But how? Oh, wait, I think the reaction here is the bromination of the alpha carbon in acetic acid to form bromoacetic acid. Or maybe it's more likely that it's a substitution. Wait, no, in acetic acid, the alpha carbon is CH3. So, adding bromine might substitute a hydrogen. But wait, under what conditions would that happen? I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, another thought: When acetic acid is treated with Br2 in the presence of a base like pyridine, it's possible that it's undergoing an acetylation. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl bromide. Acetic anhydride can react with Br2 to form an acyl bromide. Or perhaps, acetic acid is being converted into an acyl chloride, but since acetic anhydride is used, maybe it's an acyl bromide. Wait, but acetic anhydride and bromine... I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the reaction conditions again.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the hydroxyl group is replaced by a bromide. Because acetic acid has a -OH group. If it reacts with Br2 and pyridine, which is a base, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid, and the -OH is not a great leaving group. Oh, but acetic anhydride can act as a catalyst or perhaps as a source of acetyl groups. Wait, maybe the reaction is acetylation of the -OH group in acetic acid, making an acetylated product. But then, why would bromine be used?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromination at the alpha position. Acetic acid has CH3COOH. The alpha carbons are the methyl group. So, perhaps it's undergoing alpha bromination. How does that happen? Alpha bromination can occur via the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, but that usually involves adding bromine in the presence of a catalyst like a metal. But here, pyridine is present. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the -OH is replaced by Br. So, acetic acid would become CH3COBr, acetyl bromide. But wait, acetic anhydride is also present. Oh, wait, perhaps the reaction is the bromide formation via the acid. Let me think: acetic acid (CH3COOH) plus acetic anhydride (which is (CH3CO)2O) can react to form an acetylated product. But with Br2 and pyridine, perhaps it's the formation of the acyl bromide.

Wait, another approach: The reaction conditions are bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride, with heating. I think that this is a case of the formation of an acyl bromide. So, the acetic acid's -OH group is being replaced by Br. So, the product would be CH3COBr, which is acetyl bromide. But wait, acetic anhydride is present. Wait, perhaps it's a mixed anhydride? Or maybe the acetic anhydride acts as a catalyst or a base? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the -OH group is first acetylated to form the acetate ester, and then bromine substitutes the acetyl group. No, that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetic acid is being used in a substitution reaction where the -OH is replaced by Br. So, acetic acid (CH3COOH) becomes CH3COBr. But how does that happen with Br2, pyridine, and acetic anhydride? I think that the presence of pyridine suggests that it's acting as a base to capture any HBr that's formed. So, perhaps the reaction is acetic acid reacting with Br2 to form CH3COBr and HBr. But wait, does acetic acid directly react with Br2 to form the acyl bromide? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps that's the case. So, product 1 is CH3COBr.

Then, product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2. So, CH3COBr is heated with ethanol and H2SO4. That sounds like a nucleophilic acyl substitution. Ethanol is a nucleophile, and H+ from H2SO4 would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group. So, the bromide leaves, and ethanol's oxygen attacks. So, the product would be ethyl acetate, CH3COOCH2CH3.

So, product 2 is ethyl acetate.

Next, product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3. Sodium cyanide is a source of CN- ions. So, perhaps it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution. The ethyl acetate would react with CN- to form an acyl cyanide. Wait, but ethyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH3. If CN- attacks the carbonyl, then the oxygen would leave as OCH2CH3-, but that's a poor leaving group. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is hydrolysis. No, wait, not hydrolysis because that would require water. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where the ethoxy group is replaced by CN. But how? Because the leaving group would need to be a good one. Hmm, maybe under certain conditions, like in a basic solution, the ethoxy group could leave as ethoxide, but that's a poor leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a substitution, but a substitution with the formation of an acylnitrile.

Wait, another approach: The OAc (ester) group is being converted into a CN group. So, the reaction is CH3COOCH2CH3 + CN- → CH3CON-CN + something. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is being hydrolyzed under basic conditions. Wait, sodium cyanide is basic because CN- is a weak base, but perhaps in the presence of an acid or other conditions. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the ethoxy group is replaced by CN. But I'm not sure about the mechanism here.

Wait, perhaps it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution. The CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. The leaving group would be the OEt- (ethoxide). But ethoxide is not a good leaving group. So, perhaps some activation is needed. But the conditions are just sodium cyanide, so maybe the solution is that the reaction is possible under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe the ester is first converted into an acid chloride, but that's not part of the reaction steps given.

Wait, another thought: Could the ester undergo a substitution where the OR group is replaced by CN? For that to happen, the OR group would have to leave, which requires it to be a better leaving group. Perhaps under strongly basic conditions, but sodium cyanide is a source of CN- and a base, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ester is treated with CN- in a basic solution. Wait, perhaps the reaction is similar to the formation of an amide from an ester, where the OR is replaced by NR2. But here, it's CN-.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis. Wait, but if it's treated with NaCN, maybe it's a substitution. Let me think, if the ester is in a solution with CN-, perhaps the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the ethoxy group leaves as OEt-.

So, product 3 would be CH3COCN, which is acetyl cyanide (or propionitrile? No, acetyl cyanide is CH3C(O)CN, right? So, the structure is CH3-C(=O)-CN.

Then, product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.

Sodium hydride is a strong base, typically used to deprotonate compounds. 1,5-dibromopentane is a dihalide. So, perhaps an alkylation is occurring here. Let's see: product 3 is CH3COCN. So, sodium hydride would deprotonate where? Wait, CH3COCN is an acyl cyanide. Where are the acidic hydrogens? The alpha hydrogens (the CH3 group attached to the carbonyl) are somewhat acidic, but not as much as, say, in a ketone. However, with a strong base like NaH, perhaps deprotonation occurs.

So, the structure of product 3 is:

O
||
CH3-C-O-CN

Wait, no, wait. Wait, from product 2, which is ethyl acetate: CH3COOCH2CH3. Then, when treated with NaCN, perhaps the OR group (OCH2CH3) is replaced by CN. So, product 3 would be CH3CO-CN, which is acetyl cyanide, right? Structure: CH3-C(=O)-CN.

So, in product 3, the molecule is CH3-C(=O)-CN. Now, when treated with excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane, what happens?

NaH would deprotonate the most acidic hydrogen. In this molecule, the alpha hydrogens are on the CH3 group attached to the carbonyl. The pKa of such alpha hydrogens is around 19-21, which is pretty acidic, but NaH is a strong base (pKa of conjugate acid around 35 or so?), so it can deprotonate it.

So, the NaH would deprotonate the CH3 group, producing an enolate. The enolate would have a negative charge on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl.

The 1,5-dibromopentane is a dihalide, which is a good alkylating agent. So, the enolate would attack one of the bromide-bearing carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane.

But wait, 1,5-dibromopentane is Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br. So, when it reacts with a strong base like NaH, perhaps it's first deprotonated if possible, but more likely, the leaving groups (Br-) are available for substitution.

Wait, but the enolate is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So, the enolate would attack one of the ends of the dihalide.

Wait, but in this case, the enolate is at the alpha position (CH2-C-O-CN-) after deprotonation. So, when it attacks 1,5-dibromopentane, it would add a five-carbon chain.

Wait, let's think about the structure. The enolate would have a negative charge on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. So, the structure would be:

O
||
CH2(-)-C-O-CN

Then, when it attacks 1,5-dibromopentane, which is a primary bromide on both ends. So, the enolate would attack one of the ends, leading to an alkylation.

But wait, 1,5-dibromopentane has bromines on both ends. So, when the enolate attacks, it would add a five-carbon group, but with two bromines at each end. Or perhaps the molecule is symmetric, so it doesn't matter which end is attacked.

Wait, no, the molecule is symmetric, so it would attack either end equally, but in this case, perhaps both bromines are on the same carbon. Wait, no, 1,5-dibromopentane is Br(CH2)4CH2Br? No, wait, pentane has five carbons. So, 1,5-dibromopentane is Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br. So, each end is a bromide.

So, when the enolate (from the acyl cyanide) attacks, it would substitute a bromide. So, the enolate's negative carbon would attack one end, the bromide leaves, and the enolate gets a pentyl group attached.

So, the product would be CH2(CO-CN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, maybe more accurately, after the attack, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-C(=O)-CN? No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused about the substitution.

Wait, let's correct this. The enolate has a negative charge on the central carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. So, the enolate would be:

:CH2-C(=O)-CN 

Wait, no. The acyl cyanide is CH3-C(=O)-CN. When deprotonated, the enolate would be [CH2-]-C(=O)-CN. Then, when it attacks 1,5-dibromopentane, which is BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br, the enolate would attack one of the Brs, say, the left end.

So, the attack would add the five-carbon chain to the alpha position. So, the structure would become:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CN

Wait, no, because the enolate is the nucleophile, attacking the carbon where Br was. So, the product would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)-C(=O)-CN but connected where?

Wait, perhaps the enolate attacks each end. Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane has two ends, each with a Br. So, each substitution would add a pentyl group. But since we're using excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane, perhaps both alpha positions are alkylated.

Wait, wait. The starting molecule, product 3, is CH3-C(=O)-CN. When the enolate is formed, it's [CH2-C(=O)-CN]^- Na^+. So, each enolate can attack a dihalide, adding a pentyl group.

But wait, 1,5-dibromopentane has two Br atoms on the same molecule. So, if the enolate attacks one Br, the product would be [CH2-pentyl]-C(=O)-CN, but then there's another Br on the same molecule. So, would another enolate form and attack the other Br?

Wait, but product 3 is CH3-C(=O)-CN. The NaH is in excess, so perhaps after the first substitution, another deprotonation occurs, leading to another substitution. So, the enolate could attack both ends of the dihalide.

Wait, but each substitution would add a pentyl group. So, the final product would have two pentyl groups attached to the central carbon.

Wait, but the enolate is a conjugate base. So, perhaps the first substitution adds one pentyl group, and a second substitution occurs, adding another pentyl group.

So, the product 4 would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(=O)CN.

Wait, that structure would have two pentyl groups attached to a central carbon, which is connected to the carbonyl and the cyanide group.

But wait, the starting enolate is from CH3-C(=O)-CN. So, when you deprotonate the CH3, you get a CH2 group that attacks the dihalide. So, each substitution adds a pentyl group to the same carbon.

Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane is a primary dihalide. So, when the enolate attacks, the pentyl group is added to the alpha carbon, which is the same carbon as the carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The enolate is a conjugate base, so when it attacks the dihalide, it's adding a five-carbon chain to the alpha position.

So, after two substitutions, we would have two pentyl groups attached to that alpha carbon. So, the structure of product 4 would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(=O)CN.

So, the molecule is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(=O)-CN, but with two such pentyl groups attached to the central C.

Wait, perhaps it's better written as:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN.

Now, let's consider the structure of product 4. It has a central carbon connected to two pentyl groups, a carbonyl group, and a cyanide group.

Wait, that central carbon is connected to:

- Two pentyl (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-) groups.

- One carbonyl (C=O) group.

- One cyano (CN) group.

So, the structure is a central carbon (let's call it C*) bonded to:

- Two -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- groups.

- One -C(=O)- group.

- One -CN group.

So, the molecule is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(=O)CN.

Now, the question is about the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR of product 4.

So, let's break it down.

First, the molecule is symmetric, but wait, is it? Let's see.

Each of the two pentyl groups is the same, so the molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two pentyl groups. So, any protons that are equivalent due to this symmetry would give the same signal.

But wait, the central carbon is attached to two identical pentyl groups, a carbonyl, and a cyano group. The carbonyl and cyano are not identical, so the molecule is not perfectly symmetric.

Wait, no. Because the two substituents (the two pentyl groups) are the same, but the other two substituents (carbonyl and cyano) are different. So, the molecule isn't symmetric, but the two pentyl groups are identical. So, the two sets of protons on the pentyl groups that are in similar environments would be equivalent.

Let me try to visualize this structure.

The central carbon (C*) is connected to:

- Two pentyl groups (each is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-).

- One carbonyl group (C=O).

- One cyano group (CN).

So, the structure is:

CN
|
O=C*-(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2

Wait, but that's not quite right. The central carbon is connected to the two pentyl groups, the carbonyl, and the cyano. So, more accurately, it's:

          CN
           |
C=O – C* – (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2

So, the central carbon is connected to four groups: two pentyl, one carbonyl, one cyano.

Wait, but that can't be right because a carbon can't have five bonds. Oh, wait, no. Each substituent is a group attached to the central carbon.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure properly.

The central carbon (C*) is bonded as follows:

- To a carbonyl group (C=O). So, C* is double-bonded to O? No, wait, no. The carbonyl is a group: O=C-R.

Wait, no, in the molecule, the central carbon is C*, which is attached to:

- A carbonyl group: O=C*-

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me correct.

The molecule is CH3-C(=O)-CN after substitution. Wait, no, after substitution, the structure is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(=O)CN.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN.

So, the central carbon (C*) is attached to:

- Two pentyl groups (each is a -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- group).

- One carbonyl oxygen (O double bonded to C*, so C* is part of the carbonyl group).

Wait, that can't be right because the carbonyl is C=O, which is a double bond. Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN.

So, the structure is:

           CN
            |
O=C*-(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2

Wait, but that would make the central carbon (C*) part of the carbonyl group (C=O), and also connected to two pentyl groups and the CN. So, in total, four substituents: two pentyl, one O (double bond), and one CN.

Wait, that's possible. But wait, each pentyl group is a chain of five carbons. So, each is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

So, the molecule is symmetric in terms of the two pentyl groups. So, the two pentyl groups are mirror images of each other. Therefore, any protons that are in equivalent positions in each pentyl group will give the same NMR signal.

Now, let's think about the NMR signals.

First, the protons on the central carbon (C*) — but wait, central carbon is part of the carbonyl group. No, the carbonyl is C=O, so the central carbon (C*) is the one attached to the two pentyl groups, the carbonyl, and the CN.

Wait, but if the central carbon is connected to two identical pentyl groups, the protons in each pentyl group that are in the same environment would be equivalent.

So, let's analyze each set of protons:

1. The protons on the central carbon (C*): Are there any? No, because the central carbon is connected to four groups (two pentyl, O, CN) and is part of the carbonyl. Wait, no, the central carbon is the one attached to the two pentyl groups, the carbonyl, and the CN. So, in the structure, the central carbon is a quaternary carbon, with no hydrogens attached.

Wait, yes. Because each substituent (pentyl, O, CN) is attached to C*, which is a carbon without any hydrogens. So, C* has no H attached.

So, the H's are all in the pentyl chains and perhaps in the CN group (but CN doesn't have H's).

So, now, looking at the pentyl groups. Each pentyl group is a five-carbon chain attached to C*.

But because the two pentyl groups are identical and the molecule is symmetric, the protons on the two pentyl chains that are in equivalent positions will be equivalent.

Let me consider each position in the pentyl group.

Each pentyl group is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-

But wait, actually, the pentyl group is:

-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-

So, each chain is five carbons long, with the first carbon (attached to C*) being CH2.

So, for each pentyl group, the structure is:

C* - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH3.

Wait, no, wait. The pentyl group is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- attached to C*. So, the first carbon is CH2 connected to C*, then another CH2, and so on, ending in a CH3.

So, each pentyl group is a straight chain: C* - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 (but wait, that would be five CH2 groups? No, that's six carbons. Wait, wait, 1,5-dibromopentane is Br(CH2)4CH2Br, so each chain is five carbons. So, when the enolate attacks, the substitution occurs at the first carbon of the pentyl group. So, the pentyl group attached to C* is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to number the pentyl group as follows:

1  2  3  4  5
CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But when the substitution occurs, the enolate attacks the first carbon (the one with Br), so the resulting group is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 attached to C*.

So, each pentyl group is a five-carbon chain, so the NMR would have signals from the different environments of the CH2 groups.

But since the two pentyl groups are identical and the molecule is symmetric, the protons on each group that are in the same position relative to the C* will be equivalent.

So, let's analyze each position in the pentyl group.

The first CH2 (attached directly to C*) is unique because it's connected to the central carbon. Then the second, third, fourth, and fifth (CH3) carbons.

But wait, in each pentyl chain, the first carbon is attached to C*, so each chain has:

Position 1: CH2 (attached to C*)

Position 2: CH2

Position 3: CH2

Position 4: CH2

Position 5: CH3.

Wait, but the molecule's symmetry is such that each chain's positions are mirrored on the other side. So, for example, the two CH2 groups in positions 2 and 4 (on each pentyl chain) are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

The molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two pentyl groups. So, if you imagine a mirror plane passing through the central carbon (C*) and the line bisecting the two pentyl groups, then the protons on each pentyl group that are equidistant from C* on either side would be equivalent.

So, for each pentyl group, the protons on the first CH2 (position 1) are unique. The protons on the second CH2 (position 2) are equivalent to the protons on the fourth CH2 (position 4) of the other pentyl group. Similarly, the protons on position 3 are equivalent between the two chains.

Wait, no. Let me think about this. Each pentyl group is in a specific position relative to the central C*, and the molecule's symmetry would cause certain equivalences.

Wait, perhaps the two pentyl groups are symmetric, so the environments of their respective CH2 groups are identical.

So, for each CH2 group in the pentyl chain, the equivalent protons would be in the same position on the other chain.

So, the first CH2 (position 1) on each pentyl group is attached to C*, and since both are the same, their protons are equivalent.

Similarly, the second CH2 (position 2) on each pentyl group would be in the same environment, so their protons are equivalent. Same goes for position 3, position 4, and the terminal CH3.

Wait, but the position 4 on each chain is the fourth CH2, which is next to the terminal CH3. So, the second chain's position 4 is equivalent to the first chain's position 2? Because of the symmetry.

Wait, no. Let me imagine looking down the central carbon. The two pentyl chains are on either side. So, the first CH2 on each is next to C*. Then, the second CH2 on each is next to the first CH2, and so on.

Because of the mirror symmetry, the second CH2 on one chain is equivalent to the second CH2 on the other chain. Similarly, the third CH2 on each chain is equivalent, and the fourth CH2 on each is equivalent.

Wait, but for each CH2 group:

- Position 1: attached to C*, each chain has the same environment. So, the protons on each position 1 are equivalent.

- Position 2: each chain's position 2 is attached to position 1 CH2 and the next CH2. So, same environment on both chains. Equivalent.

- Position 3: same as above. Each chain's position 3 is equivalent.

- Position 4: same. Each chain's position 4 is equivalent.

Wait, but wait, position 4 is next to the CH3. So, for the first chain, position 4 is attached to position 3 and CH3. For the second chain, the same applies. So, yes, their environments are the same.

So, each position in the pentyl chains contributes a set of equivalent protons across both chains.

So, the NMR would show:

1. The protons on position 1 (attached to C*) → one signal.

2. The protons on position 2 → another signal.

3. The protons on position 3 → another signal.

4. The protons on position 4 → another signal.

5. The terminal CH3 groups → another signal.

Wait, but each of these groups has how many sets of equivalent protons?

Wait, each CH2 group has two protons, but if the environment is the same for both chains, all protons in that position are equivalent.

But wait, in each CH2 group, the two protons are equivalent because they are on the same carbon. So, each position would contribute one signal.

So, the pentyl groups contribute five distinct signals:

- Position 1: one set of H.

- Position 2: another.

- Position 3: another.

- Position 4: another.

- CH3 (position 5): another.

But wait, in the molecule, each CH2 group is in the same environment on both chains. So, the protons on each CH2 group are equivalent across both chains. Therefore, each position (1-4) contributes a single signal, and the CH3 contributes another.

Wait, but wait: the two pentyl groups are identical and symmetric, so the CH2 groups at the same position on each chain are equivalent. So, for each position (1-4), all the Hs are equivalent across both chains, so each contributes a single peak.

So, for the pentyl groups, total of 5 signals: 1, 2, 3, 4 (CH2s), and 5 (CH3).

But wait, no. The CH3 is at the end of each pentyl chain. Each CH3 is attached to a CH2, which is the same on both chains. So, the CH3 protons should be equivalent.

So, let me recount:

1. Position 1 (CH2 next to C*): 2 H, but equivalent on both chains. So, one signal.

2. Position 2 (CH2): same on both chains. One signal.

3. Position 3 (CH2): same on both chains. One signal.

4. Position 4 (CH2): same on both chains. One signal.

5. Position 5 (CH3): same on both chains. One signal.

So, that's 5 signals from the pentyl groups.

Wait, but wait a second. The CH3 group is at the end of each pentyl chain. So, each CH3 is attached to a CH2, which is part of a longer chain. Are the two CH3 groups equivalent? Because the molecule is symmetric, yes. So, their protons would be the same, contributing a single signal.

Similarly, each CH2 group in positions 1-4 is equivalent across both chains, so each gives a single signal.

So, total 5 signals from the pentyl groups.

But wait, the CH2 groups in position 3 are each attached to two CH2 groups (positions 2 and 4), so their environment is the same on both chains. So, their Hs are equivalent.

Therefore, the pentyl groups contribute 5 signals.

But wait, I'm getting 5 signals from the two pentyl groups. But am I missing anything else?

Wait, any other Hs in the molecule? The central C* has no Hs, the CN group has no Hs, and the carbonyl group has no Hs.

So, all the Hs are in the pentyl chains, giving 5 signals.

But wait, let me think again. Each CH2 group that is in the same position on both chains contributes the same signal.

So, the NMR would have:

- Position 1: a triplet? Or just a quartet? Wait, no, the splitting depends on neighboring protons. But in any case, the question is about the number of distinct signals, not the splitting.

So, number of signals is 5 from the pentyl groups.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: the CH2 groups in position 2 and 4 are equivalent due to the symmetry. So, perhaps the signals from positions 2 and 4 are the same.

Wait, are the environments of position 2 and 4 the same?

No, because position 2 is closer to the C*, while position 4 is further away, closer to the CH3.

So, the environments are different, so their signals would be different.

So, no, the positions 2 and 4 are not equivalent. So, their Hs contribute separate signals.

Thus, the pentyl groups contribute 5 signals.

Wait, but I must have made a mistake because the options don't have 5 as the correct answer. Wait, the options are A)8, B)5, C)10, D)12.

Wait, option B is 5. But I'm getting 5 from the pentyl groups, but wait, perhaps I'm missing other signals.

Wait, another possible source of Hs: the central C* is attached to the two pentyl groups, a carbonyl, and a cyano group. But, as I thought earlier, the C* doesn't have any H.

Wait, but what about the CN group? CN doesn't have any H, so no signal there.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the Hs on the carbonyl group? No, carbonyl is a double bond, no H.

Wait, so the entire Hs are in the two pentyl chains, giving 5 distinct signals.

But the options have 5 as option B. But I think I must be missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I didn't account for the fact that the two pentyl groups are attached to a central carbon that has other substituents, which could cause some of their CH2 groups to be in different environments.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 groups adjacent to the C* (position 1) are each in a different environment because one is attached to a carbonyl and the other to a cyano group.

Wait, no, because the molecule is symmetric with the two pentyl groups. The two pentyl groups are attached to the same C*, which is connected to a carbonyl and a cyano. So, each CH2 group in position 1 is attached to a C* that's connected to a carbonyl and a cyano. So, their environments are the same.

Wait, but wait, the substituents on C* are: two pentyl groups, a carbonyl, and a cyano. Therefore, each position 1 CH2 is attached to C*, which has the same substituents on both sides, so their environments are the same.

So, the two position 1 CH2s are equivalent, giving one signal.

Similarly, the other CH2 groups are equivalent across the two chains, giving their own signals.

So, I think I was correct earlier—the pentyl groups contribute five signals.

But that's only 5 signals. The options include option B as 5, but I suspect the correct answer is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of product 4. Let me re-examine the synthesis steps.

Step 1: Acetic acid + bromine, pyridine, acetic anhydride, heat → product 1.

As I thought earlier, product 1 is CH3COBr (acetyl bromide).

Step 2: Product 1 (CH3COBr) heated with ethanol and H2SO4 → product 2.

That's a nucleophilic substitution, so product 2 is ethyl acetate: CH3COOCH2CH3.

Step 3: Product 2 treated with NaCN → product 3.

So, in this step, the ester (ethyl acetate) reacts with CN-.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. The reaction of an ester with NaCN would typically form an acyl cyanide, but how?

Wait, when an ester reacts with CN-, it's possible to substitute the OR group with CN. So, ester R-O-CO-R' + CN- → R-CN-CO-R' + RO-.

But wait, that might not be correct because the OR group is a poor leaving group. Unless the reaction is under basic conditions, where the OR is deprotonated to form a better leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the ethoxide (OEt-) is replaced by CN-.

Wait, in the presence of a base like NaCN, maybe the ester is hydrolyzed to the acid, then the acid reacts with CN- to form the acyl cyanide. But that would require two steps.

Wait, but the reaction conditions are just NaCN. Maybe it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution where the CN- replaces the OR group.

So, product 3 would be CH3CO-CN, acetyl cyanide.

Step 4: Product 3 (CH3CO-CN) treated with excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane → product 4.

As I thought before, the NaH deprotonates the alpha H (the CH3 group), forming an enolate. The enolate then attacks 1,5-dibromopentane.

But 1,5-dibromopentane is a dihalide, so each substitution would add a pentyl group. Since there are two Br atoms, perhaps two substitutions occur, leading to two pentyl groups attached to the alpha carbon.

So, product 4 would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(=O)CN.

Wait, that's the same as before. So, the structure is correct.

Now, the NMR of product 4.

So, the molecule is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(=O)CN.

Each pentyl group is a five-carbon chain attached to the central carbon.

So, each pentyl group has five CH2 units and a terminal CH3.

Wait, no, five carbons in the chain: the first is attached to the central carbon (C*), then four more CH2 groups, ending in a CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, 1,5-dibromopentane is Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br. So, when the enolate attacks, it substitutes one Br, so the added group is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

So, each pentyl group is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, because substitution at the end would give a chain of five CH2 groups, ending in a CH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

C(=O)CN
|
C* – (CH2)5-CH3 (but two of these)

Wait, no. Each substitution adds a CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- group. So, each chain is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So, each chain is five carbons, with the first carbon attached to C*, and the last is a CH3.

So, each chain is:

C* – CH2 – CH2 – CH2 – CH2 – CH2 – CH3.

Wait, no, because each substitution adds a five-carbon group. So, each chain is five carbons in a row. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- (with CH3 at the end).

Wait, but the substituent from 1,5-dibromopentane substitution is a -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- group, with the last carbon being CH2, not CH3. Because 1,5-dibromopentane is Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br. So, when you substitute Br with the enolate, you get -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- attached to C*.

Wait, but that can't be because that would make the chain five CH2 groups, which would end in another CH2, not a CH3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me clarify.

When the enolate attacks 1,5-dibromopentane, which is Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br.

The enolate would attack one end, replacing Br with the enolate's R group. So, the product after substitution would have the structure:

R-C* – CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br.

Wait, no, because the substitution would replace a Br with the R group. So, the product would be R-C* – CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

Wait, but where is the Br? No, the dihalide is symmetric; each substitution would replace a Br with R.

Wait, perhaps each substitution adds a five-carbon chain to the central carbon.

So, the structure after two substitutions would be:

(CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-)2C(=O)CN.

But each chain is five carbons, and the last carbon is CH2, not CH3. So, perhaps the structure is:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(=O)CN.

In this case, each chain is five CH2 groups, with no terminal CH3.

Wait, that can't be right because 1,5-dibromopentane has five carbons and ends in CH2Br. So, substitution would lead to each chain ending in CH2.

Wait, but then where's the CH3? There isn't one. So, perhaps the structure is (CH2)5 groups attached to C*.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me correct this.

The structure of 1,5-dibromopentane is Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br. So, when the enolate attacks, it will substitute one Br, leading to the addition of a five-carbon chain.

So, each substitution adds the group -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

But wait, that can't be, because the enolate attacks at the end of the dihalide, so the substituent would be -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a five-carbon chain with all CH2 groups, ending in another CH2 (since the Br was at the end). So, the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

But that would mean each substituent is a five-carbon chain, but without a CH3 at the end.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think of it this way: when the enolate attacks 1,5-dibromopentane, it substitutes one Br. So, for each substitution, the substituent added is a five-carbon chain with a CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- group attached to C*.

But that would make the substituent a straight chain of five CH2 groups, which can't be right because that would require the substituent to end with another CH2 group, not a CH3.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let's try a different approach. Let me consider the number of NMR signals again.

Each substituent is a pentyl group: five carbons in a row, with the first carbon attached to C*, and the last being a CH3.

So, each substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, because 1,5-dibromopentane has five carbons, so the substituent would be five carbons, making each substituent a pentyl group.

So, each substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So, each substituent is a five-carbon chain ending in CH3.

Thus, each substituent has the structure:

C* – CH2 – CH2 – CH2 – CH2 – CH3.

So, each substituent is a pentyl group.

Now, considering the NMR:

Each substituent (pentyl group) has five unique sets of Hs, as previously thought.

But wait, the molecule has two pentyl groups attached to C*. Due to the symmetry between the two substituents, the Hs in equivalent positions on each substituent will have the same chemical shift.

So, for each substituent:

- The first CH2 (attached to C*) is position 1.

- The next CH2 is position 2.

- Then position 3.

- Then position 4.

- And the terminal CH3 is position 5.

But the environment of position 1 on each substituent is the same because the substituents are identical and the molecule is symmetric. So, the Hs in position 1 on each substituent are equivalent.

Similarly, the Hs in position 2 on each substituent are equivalent, and so on for positions 3 and 4. The terminal CH3 groups are also equivalent.

So, we have:

1. Position 1: one signal.

2. Position 2: another.

3. Position 3: another.

4. Position 4: another.

5. Position 5 (CH3): another.

Thus, five signals from the two pentyl groups.

But wait, in the structure I have, the substituent is a pentyl group. So, perhaps the NMR would show five signals for the substituents.

But the options have 5 as option B, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Another possibility is that I'm missing some signals.

Wait, perhaps the enolate substitution leads to more than two substituents. No, it's two substituents, each a pentyl group.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the substituents are longer than five carbons? No, the substituent comes from 1,5-dibromopentane, which is five carbons.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the possibility of the molecule being more complex. Let me think.

Another possibility: the substitution doesn't add the entire pentyl group but only a portion. For example, perhaps the enolate adds a three-carbon group. But that doesn't seem right because the dihalide is pentane.

Alternatively, perhaps each substitution adds a four-carbon group. But I think the reaction adds the entire five-carbon chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution leads to branching, but that doesn't seem likely here.

Wait, perhaps the product is a gem-dialkylation, where the enolate attacks both ends of the dihalide, leading to two substituents on the same carbon. So, the structure would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(=O)CN.

In that case, each substituent is a pentyl group, and the molecule is symmetric.

So, the NMR would have:

- Each CH2 group in the pentyl substituents would contribute a signal.

- The terminal CH3 groups would contribute another.

But given the symmetry, each position (1-4) would have equivalent Hs across both substituents, leading to five signals.

So, I'm confident that the NMR would have five signals from the substituents.

But the options have B)5, which would be the answer.

Wait, but wait, the question says, "how many distinct hydrogen signals will be observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of 4?"

If the structure is symmetric, and each substituent's Hs are equivalent, then the answer would be 5.

But looking at the options, option B is 5.

Another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in the structure, and the substituents are longer, leading to more signals.

Wait, let me think again about product 4.

If product 3 is CH3-C(=O)-CN, and when treated with excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane, perhaps the enolate attacks both ends of the dihalide, leading to two substituents.

So, the product would be (CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-)2C(=O)CN.

Wait, each substituent is a five-carbon chain with all CH2 groups, no terminal CH3. So, the substituent is -(CH2)5-.

In that case, each substituent has four CH2 groups and one CH2 attached to C*.

So, each substituent has five CH2 groups, no CH3.

In this structure, each substituent is a straight chain of five CH2 groups.

So, the NMR would have:

- The CH2 groups in each substituent.

But with two substituents, each having five CH2 groups, but due to symmetry, equivalent.

Wait, no. Each substituent is a chain of five CH2 groups. So, each substituent has:

Position 1: CH2 (attached to C*)

Position 2: CH2

Position 3: CH2

Position 4: CH2

Position 5: CH2.

So, each substituent has five CH2 groups, all in a row.

Now, considering the molecule's symmetry, the Hs in each position across the two substituents are equivalent.

So, for each substituent's CH2 groups:

1. Position 1: equivalent across both substituents → one signal.

2. Position 2: same → one signal.

3. Position 3: same → one signal.

4. Position 4: same → one signal.

5. Position 5: same → one signal.

Thus, five signals from the substituents.

But wait, that's five signals, same as before.

So, the total number of signals is five.

But why is option B)5 an option? Because the other options are higher numbers.

Wait, am I missing any other Hs in the molecule? Let me think.

The central carbon (C*) doesn't have any Hs. The CN group has no Hs. The carbonyl group has no Hs. The only Hs are in the substituent chains.

So, total of five signals.

So, the correct answer would be 5, which is option B.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck because I thought the correct answer might be higher, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Another possibility: Perhaps the substituents are longer, leading to more CH2 groups, thus more signals.

Wait, no, the substituents are five carbons each, so each has five CH2 groups.

Wait, no, the substituent is five carbons, including the one attached to C*. So, each substituent has five CH2 groups.

Wait, but that would mean each substituent is five CH2 groups, leading to five different environments for each CH2 group, but with symmetry leading to five signals.

So, the NMR would show five signals.

So, the answer should be 5, option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step synthesis starting with acetic acid and ending with a final product, whose ¹H NMR spectrum is analyzed for distinct hydrogen signals. Here's the breakdown:

---

### Reaction Steps and Product Analysis:

1. **Step 1: Acetic acid + bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride (heating)**  
   Acetic acid reacts with bromine in the presence of pyridine and acetic anhydride to form **acetyl bromide (CH₃COBr)**. Pyridine acts as a base, neutralizing HBr formed during the reaction.

2. **Step 2: Acetyl bromide + ethanol and sulfuric acid (heating)**  
   Acetyl bromide undergoes nucleophilic acyl substitution with ethanol, forming **ethyl acetate (CH₃COOCH₂CH₃)**. Sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst.

3. **Step 3: Ethyl acetate + sodium cyanide**  
   Ethyl acetate reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN) via nucleophilic acyl substitution, replacing the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) with a cyano group (-CN). The product is **acetyl cyanide (CH₃COCN)**.

4. **Step 4: Acetyl cyanide + excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane**  
   Sodium hydride deprotonates the methyl group adjacent to the carbonyl, forming an enolate. The enolate attacks 1,5-dibromopentane, a dihalide, leading to **gem-dialkylation**. The final product is **(CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂)₂C(=O)CN**, where the central carbon is bonded to two pentyl groups, a carbonyl group, and a cyano group.

---

### NMR Analysis of the Final Product:

The final product, **(CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂)₂C(=O)CN**, has two identical pentyl chains attached to the central carbon. The molecule is symmetric, and the environments of protons in equivalent positions on the two pentyl chains are identical. The analysis of distinct hydrogen signals is as follows:

1. **Position 1 (CH₂ attached to C*)**: The CH₂ group directly bonded to the central carbon contributes one signal.  
2. **Position 2 (CH₂)**: The CH₂ group in the second position of each pentyl chain contributes another signal.  
3. **Position 3 (CH₂)**: The CH₂ group in the third position of each pentyl chain contributes another signal.  
4. **Position 4 (CH₂)**: The CH₂ group in the fourth position of each pentyl chain contributes another signal.  
5. **Position 5 (CH₃)**: The terminal CH₃ group at the end of each pentyl chain contributes another signal.

Thus, there are **5 distinct hydrogen environments** in the molecule, leading to **5 signals** in the ¹H NMR spectrum.

---

### Conclusion:

The number of distinct hydrogen signals observable in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product is **5**.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these reaction mechanisms and NMR spectroscopy. Let's try to break this down step by step.

The problem starts with acetic acid being treated with bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride with heating. Hmm, I remember that when acetic acid reacts with bromine in the presence of pyridine and acetic anhydride, it's probably undergoing some kind of acetylation or bromination. Wait, I think bromine is a good electrophile here. Oh, right! Acetic acid can act as a nucleophile. So, pyridine might be acting as a base, absorbing the HBr that's generated during the reaction. Oh wait, but wait—what's the reaction called when acetic acid is treated with bromine? I think it's a bromination, maybe forming an acyl bromide? Or perhaps it's a substitution. Oh wait, another possibility: when acetic acid reacts with bromine, it might be forming the acetyl bromide. But wait, or is it something else? Oh, wait, I remember that the acetylation of something with acetic anhydride usually adds an acetyl group. But here, it's bromine. Hmm. Maybe it's a Friedel-Crafts acylation? No, that's for aromatic rings. Wait, no, acetic acid is just an acid.

Wait, perhaps this is about the bromination of the carboxylic acid. Oh, wait, another thought: the acetylation of the -OH group in acetic acid. Because acetic anhydride can acetylate hydroxyl groups. So, acetic acid has an -OH. If it's treated with acetic anhydride, that would acetylate the -OH, turning it into an acetate ester. But then why is bromine and pyridine present? Oh, I think the reaction is forming the acetyl bromide. Let me think again. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts with acetic anhydride (which is (CH3CO)2O). Wait, but acetic anhydride is typically used to make esters. For example, when a hydroxyl group is present, like in alcohol, acetic anhydride would acetylate it. So, in this case, the acetic acid has an -OH. So when treated with acetic anhydride, perhaps it forms an acetylated compound. But wait, the reaction also involves bromine and pyridine. Oh, maybe it's a mix of reactions.

Wait another angle: Perhaps the acetic acid is undergoing a bromination on the alpha carbon. Because acetic acid has a CH3 group attached to the carbonyl. The alpha position is the CH3. Bromine is a good electrophile, so it could add there. But how? Oh, wait, I think the reaction here is the bromination of the alpha carbon in acetic acid to form bromoacetic acid. Or maybe it's more likely that it's a substitution. Wait, no, in acetic acid, the alpha carbon is CH3. So, adding bromine might substitute a hydrogen. But wait, under what conditions would that happen? I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, another thought: When acetic acid is treated with Br2 in the presence of a base like pyridine, it's possible that it's undergoing an acetylation. Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl bromide. Acetic anhydride can react with Br2 to form an acyl bromide. Or perhaps, acetic acid is being converted into an acyl chloride, but since acetic anhydride is used, maybe it's an acyl bromide. Wait, but acetic anhydride and bromine... I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to think about the reaction conditions again.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the hydroxyl group is replaced by a bromide. Because acetic acid has a -OH group. If it reacts with Br2 and pyridine, which is a base, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. Wait, but acetic acid is a weak acid, and the -OH is not a great leaving group. Oh, but acetic anhydride can act as a catalyst or perhaps as a source of acetyl groups. Wait, maybe the reaction is acetylation of the -OH group in acetic acid, making an acetylated product. But then, why would bromine be used?

Alternatively, perhaps it's a bromination at the alpha position. Acetic acid has CH3COOH. The alpha carbons are the methyl group. So, perhaps it's undergoing alpha bromination. How does that happen? Alpha bromination can occur via the Hell–Volhard–Zelinskii reaction, but that usually involves adding bromine in the presence of a catalyst like a metal. But here, pyridine is present. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the -OH is replaced by Br. So, acetic acid would become CH3COBr, acetyl bromide. But wait, acetic anhydride is also present. Oh, wait, perhaps the reaction is the bromide formation via the acid. Let me think: acetic acid (CH3COOH) plus acetic anhydride (which is (CH3CO)2O) can react to form an acetylated product. But with Br2 and pyridine, perhaps it's the formation of the acyl bromide.

Wait, another approach: The reaction conditions are bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride, with heating. I think that this is a case of the formation of an acyl bromide. So, the acetic acid's -OH group is being replaced by Br. So, the product would be CH3COBr, which is acetyl bromide. But wait, acetic anhydride is present. Wait, perhaps it's a mixed anhydride? Or maybe the acetic anhydride acts as a catalyst or a base? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the -OH group is first acetylated to form the acetate ester, and then bromine substitutes the acetyl group. No, that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the acetic acid is being used in a substitution reaction where the -OH is replaced by Br. So, acetic acid (CH3COOH) becomes CH3COBr. But how does that happen with Br2, pyridine, and acetic anhydride? I think that the presence of pyridine suggests that it's acting as a base to capture any HBr that's formed. So, perhaps the reaction is acetic acid reacting with Br2 to form CH3COBr and HBr. But wait, does acetic acid directly react with Br2 to form the acyl bromide? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps that's the case. So, product 1 is CH3COBr.

Then, product 1 is heated with ethanol and a small amount of sulfuric acid, forming product 2. So, CH3COBr is heated with ethanol and H2SO4. That sounds like a nucleophilic acyl substitution. Ethanol is a nucleophile, and H+ from H2SO4 would protonate the carbonyl oxygen, making it a better leaving group. So, the bromide leaves, and ethanol's oxygen attacks. So, the product would be ethyl acetate, CH3COOCH2CH3.

So, product 2 is ethyl acetate.

Next, product 2 is treated with sodium cyanide, forming product 3. Sodium cyanide is a source of CN- ions. So, perhaps it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution. The ethyl acetate would react with CN- to form an acyl cyanide. Wait, but ethyl acetate is CH3COOCH2CH3. If CN- attacks the carbonyl, then the oxygen would leave as OCH2CH3-, but that's a poor leaving group. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is hydrolysis. No, wait, not hydrolysis because that would require water. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where the ethoxy group is replaced by CN. But how? Because the leaving group would need to be a good one. Hmm, maybe under certain conditions, like in a basic solution, the ethoxy group could leave as ethoxide, but that's a poor leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not a substitution, but a substitution with the formation of an acylnitrile.

Wait, another approach: The OAc (ester) group is being converted into a CN group. So, the reaction is CH3COOCH2CH3 + CN- → CH3CON-CN + something. Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is being hydrolyzed under basic conditions. Wait, sodium cyanide is basic because CN- is a weak base, but perhaps in the presence of an acid or other conditions. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a substitution where the ethoxy group is replaced by CN. But I'm not sure about the mechanism here.

Wait, perhaps it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution. The CN- would attack the carbonyl carbon. The leaving group would be the OEt- (ethoxide). But ethoxide is not a good leaving group. So, perhaps some activation is needed. But the conditions are just sodium cyanide, so maybe the solution is that the reaction is possible under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe the ester is first converted into an acid chloride, but that's not part of the reaction steps given.

Wait, another thought: Could the ester undergo a substitution where the OR group is replaced by CN? For that to happen, the OR group would have to leave, which requires it to be a better leaving group. Perhaps under strongly basic conditions, but sodium cyanide is a source of CN- and a base, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the ester is treated with CN- in a basic solution. Wait, perhaps the reaction is similar to the formation of an amide from an ester, where the OR is replaced by NR2. But here, it's CN-.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis. Wait, but if it's treated with NaCN, maybe it's a substitution. Let me think, if the ester is in a solution with CN-, perhaps the CN- attacks the carbonyl carbon, and the ethoxy group leaves as OEt-.

So, product 3 would be CH3COCN, which is acetyl cyanide (or propionitrile? No, acetyl cyanide is CH3C(O)CN, right? So, the structure is CH3-C(=O)-CN.

Then, product 3 is treated with excess sodium hydride and 1,5-dibromopentane, forming final product 4.

Sodium hydride is a strong base, typically used to deprotonate compounds. 1,5-dibromopentane is a dihalide. So, perhaps an alkylation is occurring here. Let's see: product 3 is CH3COCN. So, sodium hydride would deprotonate where? Wait, CH3COCN is an acyl cyanide. Where are the acidic hydrogens? The alpha hydrogens (the CH3 group attached to the carbonyl) are somewhat acidic, but not as much as, say, in a ketone. However, with a strong base like NaH, perhaps deprotonation occurs.

So, the structure of product 3 is:

O
||
CH3-C-O-CN

Wait, no, wait. Wait, from product 2, which is ethyl acetate: CH3COOCH2CH3. Then, when treated with NaCN, perhaps the OR group (OCH2CH3) is replaced by CN. So, product 3 would be CH3CO-CN, which is acetyl cyanide, right? Structure: CH3-C(=O)-CN.

So, in product 3, the molecule is CH3-C(=O)-CN. Now, when treated with excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane, what happens?

NaH would deprotonate the most acidic hydrogen. In this molecule, the alpha hydrogens are on the CH3 group attached to the carbonyl. The pKa of such alpha hydrogens is around 19-21, which is pretty acidic, but NaH is a strong base (pKa of conjugate acid around 35 or so?), so it can deprotonate it.

So, the NaH would deprotonate the CH3 group, producing an enolate. The enolate would have a negative charge on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl.

The 1,5-dibromopentane is a dihalide, which is a good alkylating agent. So, the enolate would attack one of the bromide-bearing carbons in 1,5-dibromopentane.

But wait, 1,5-dibromopentane is Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br. So, when it reacts with a strong base like NaH, perhaps it's first deprotonated if possible, but more likely, the leaving groups (Br-) are available for substitution.

Wait, but the enolate is a strong base and a good nucleophile. So, the enolate would attack one of the ends of the dihalide.

Wait, but in this case, the enolate is at the alpha position (CH2-C-O-CN-) after deprotonation. So, when it attacks 1,5-dibromopentane, it would add a five-carbon chain.

Wait, let's think about the structure. The enolate would have a negative charge on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. So, the structure would be:

O
||
CH2(-)-C-O-CN

Then, when it attacks 1,5-dibromopentane, which is a primary bromide on both ends. So, the enolate would attack one of the ends, leading to an alkylation.

But wait, 1,5-dibromopentane has bromines on both ends. So, when the enolate attacks, it would add a five-carbon group, but with two bromines at each end. Or perhaps the molecule is symmetric, so it doesn't matter which end is attacked.

Wait, no, the molecule is symmetric, so it would attack either end equally, but in this case, perhaps both bromines are on the same carbon. Wait, no, 1,5-dibromopentane is Br(CH2)4CH2Br? No, wait, pentane has five carbons. So, 1,5-dibromopentane is Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br. So, each end is a bromide.

So, when the enolate (from the acyl cyanide) attacks, it would substitute a bromide. So, the enolate's negative carbon would attack one end, the bromide leaves, and the enolate gets a pentyl group attached.

So, the product would be CH2(CO-CN)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. Wait, no, maybe more accurately, after the attack, the structure would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-O-C(=O)-CN? No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused about the substitution.

Wait, let's correct this. The enolate has a negative charge on the central carbon adjacent to the carbonyl. So, the enolate would be:

:CH2-C(=O)-CN 

Wait, no. The acyl cyanide is CH3-C(=O)-CN. When deprotonated, the enolate would be [CH2-]-C(=O)-CN. Then, when it attacks 1,5-dibromopentane, which is BrCH2CH2CH2CH2CH2Br, the enolate would attack one of the Brs, say, the left end.

So, the attack would add the five-carbon chain to the alpha position. So, the structure would become:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CN

Wait, no, because the enolate is the nucleophile, attacking the carbon where Br was. So, the product would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)-C(=O)-CN but connected where?

Wait, perhaps the enolate attacks each end. Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane has two ends, each with a Br. So, each substitution would add a pentyl group. But since we're using excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane, perhaps both alpha positions are alkylated.

Wait, wait. The starting molecule, product 3, is CH3-C(=O)-CN. When the enolate is formed, it's [CH2-C(=O)-CN]^- Na^+. So, each enolate can attack a dihalide, adding a pentyl group.

But wait, 1,5-dibromopentane has two Br atoms on the same molecule. So, if the enolate attacks one Br, the product would be [CH2-pentyl]-C(=O)-CN, but then there's another Br on the same molecule. So, would another enolate form and attack the other Br?

Wait, but product 3 is CH3-C(=O)-CN. The NaH is in excess, so perhaps after the first substitution, another deprotonation occurs, leading to another substitution. So, the enolate could attack both ends of the dihalide.

Wait, but each substitution would add a pentyl group. So, the final product would have two pentyl groups attached to the central carbon.

Wait, but the enolate is a conjugate base. So, perhaps the first substitution adds one pentyl group, and a second substitution occurs, adding another pentyl group.

So, the product 4 would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(=O)CN.

Wait, that structure would have two pentyl groups attached to a central carbon, which is connected to the carbonyl and the cyanide group.

But wait, the starting enolate is from CH3-C(=O)-CN. So, when you deprotonate the CH3, you get a CH2 group that attacks the dihalide. So, each substitution adds a pentyl group to the same carbon.

Wait, but 1,5-dibromopentane is a primary dihalide. So, when the enolate attacks, the pentyl group is added to the alpha carbon, which is the same carbon as the carbonyl.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The enolate is a conjugate base, so when it attacks the dihalide, it's adding a five-carbon chain to the alpha position.

So, after two substitutions, we would have two pentyl groups attached to that alpha carbon. So, the structure of product 4 would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(=O)CN.

So, the molecule is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(=O)-CN, but with two such pentyl groups attached to the central C.

Wait, perhaps it's better written as:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN.

Now, let's consider the structure of product 4. It has a central carbon connected to two pentyl groups, a carbonyl group, and a cyanide group.

Wait, that central carbon is connected to:

- Two pentyl (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2-) groups.

- One carbonyl (C=O) group.

- One cyano (CN) group.

So, the structure is a central carbon (let's call it C*) bonded to:

- Two -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- groups.

- One -C(=O)- group.

- One -CN group.

So, the molecule is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(=O)CN.

Now, the question is about the number of distinct hydrogen signals in the 1H NMR of product 4.

So, let's break it down.

First, the molecule is symmetric, but wait, is it? Let's see.

Each of the two pentyl groups is the same, so the molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two pentyl groups. So, any protons that are equivalent due to this symmetry would give the same signal.

But wait, the central carbon is attached to two identical pentyl groups, a carbonyl, and a cyano group. The carbonyl and cyano are not identical, so the molecule is not perfectly symmetric.

Wait, no. Because the two substituents (the two pentyl groups) are the same, but the other two substituents (carbonyl and cyano) are different. So, the molecule isn't symmetric, but the two pentyl groups are identical. So, the two sets of protons on the pentyl groups that are in similar environments would be equivalent.

Let me try to visualize this structure.

The central carbon (C*) is connected to:

- Two pentyl groups (each is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-).

- One carbonyl group (C=O).

- One cyano group (CN).

So, the structure is:

CN
|
O=C*-(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2

Wait, but that's not quite right. The central carbon is connected to the two pentyl groups, the carbonyl, and the cyano. So, more accurately, it's:

          CN
           |
C=O – C* – (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2

So, the central carbon is connected to four groups: two pentyl, one carbonyl, one cyano.

Wait, but that can't be right because a carbon can't have five bonds. Oh, wait, no. Each substituent is a group attached to the central carbon.

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure properly.

The central carbon (C*) is bonded as follows:

- To a carbonyl group (C=O). So, C* is double-bonded to O? No, wait, no. The carbonyl is a group: O=C-R.

Wait, no, in the molecule, the central carbon is C*, which is attached to:

- A carbonyl group: O=C*-

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me correct.

The molecule is CH3-C(=O)-CN after substitution. Wait, no, after substitution, the structure is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(=O)CN.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN.

So, the central carbon (C*) is attached to:

- Two pentyl groups (each is a -CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- group).

- One carbonyl oxygen (O double bonded to C*, so C* is part of the carbonyl group).

Wait, that can't be right because the carbonyl is C=O, which is a double bond. Wait, perhaps the structure is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(O)CN.

So, the structure is:

           CN
            |
O=C*-(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2

Wait, but that would make the central carbon (C*) part of the carbonyl group (C=O), and also connected to two pentyl groups and the CN. So, in total, four substituents: two pentyl, one O (double bond), and one CN.

Wait, that's possible. But wait, each pentyl group is a chain of five carbons. So, each is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

So, the molecule is symmetric in terms of the two pentyl groups. So, the two pentyl groups are mirror images of each other. Therefore, any protons that are in equivalent positions in each pentyl group will give the same NMR signal.

Now, let's think about the NMR signals.

First, the protons on the central carbon (C*) — but wait, central carbon is part of the carbonyl group. No, the carbonyl is C=O, so the central carbon (C*) is the one attached to the two pentyl groups, the carbonyl, and the CN.

Wait, but if the central carbon is connected to two identical pentyl groups, the protons in each pentyl group that are in the same environment would be equivalent.

So, let's analyze each set of protons:

1. The protons on the central carbon (C*): Are there any? No, because the central carbon is connected to four groups (two pentyl, O, CN) and is part of the carbonyl. Wait, no, the central carbon is the one attached to the two pentyl groups, the carbonyl, and the CN. So, in the structure, the central carbon is a quaternary carbon, with no hydrogens attached.

Wait, yes. Because each substituent (pentyl, O, CN) is attached to C*, which is a carbon without any hydrogens. So, C* has no H attached.

So, the H's are all in the pentyl chains and perhaps in the CN group (but CN doesn't have H's).

So, now, looking at the pentyl groups. Each pentyl group is a five-carbon chain attached to C*.

But because the two pentyl groups are identical and the molecule is symmetric, the protons on the two pentyl chains that are in equivalent positions will be equivalent.

Let me consider each position in the pentyl group.

Each pentyl group is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-

But wait, actually, the pentyl group is:

-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-

So, each chain is five carbons long, with the first carbon (attached to C*) being CH2.

So, for each pentyl group, the structure is:

C* - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH3.

Wait, no, wait. The pentyl group is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- attached to C*. So, the first carbon is CH2 connected to C*, then another CH2, and so on, ending in a CH3.

So, each pentyl group is a straight chain: C* - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 (but wait, that would be five CH2 groups? No, that's six carbons. Wait, wait, 1,5-dibromopentane is Br(CH2)4CH2Br, so each chain is five carbons. So, when the enolate attacks, the substitution occurs at the first carbon of the pentyl group. So, the pentyl group attached to C* is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, perhaps it's better to number the pentyl group as follows:

1  2  3  4  5
CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But when the substitution occurs, the enolate attacks the first carbon (the one with Br), so the resulting group is CH2CH2CH2CH2CH3 attached to C*.

So, each pentyl group is a five-carbon chain, so the NMR would have signals from the different environments of the CH2 groups.

But since the two pentyl groups are identical and the molecule is symmetric, the protons on each group that are in the same position relative to the C* will be equivalent.

So, let's analyze each position in the pentyl group.

The first CH2 (attached directly to C*) is unique because it's connected to the central carbon. Then the second, third, fourth, and fifth (CH3) carbons.

But wait, in each pentyl chain, the first carbon is attached to C*, so each chain has:

Position 1: CH2 (attached to C*)

Position 2: CH2

Position 3: CH2

Position 4: CH2

Position 5: CH3.

Wait, but the molecule's symmetry is such that each chain's positions are mirrored on the other side. So, for example, the two CH2 groups in positions 2 and 4 (on each pentyl chain) are equivalent due to the molecule's symmetry.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

The molecule has a plane of symmetry between the two pentyl groups. So, if you imagine a mirror plane passing through the central carbon (C*) and the line bisecting the two pentyl groups, then the protons on each pentyl group that are equidistant from C* on either side would be equivalent.

So, for each pentyl group, the protons on the first CH2 (position 1) are unique. The protons on the second CH2 (position 2) are equivalent to the protons on the fourth CH2 (position 4) of the other pentyl group. Similarly, the protons on position 3 are equivalent between the two chains.

Wait, no. Let me think about this. Each pentyl group is in a specific position relative to the central C*, and the molecule's symmetry would cause certain equivalences.

Wait, perhaps the two pentyl groups are symmetric, so the environments of their respective CH2 groups are identical.

So, for each CH2 group in the pentyl chain, the equivalent protons would be in the same position on the other chain.

So, the first CH2 (position 1) on each pentyl group is attached to C*, and since both are the same, their protons are equivalent.

Similarly, the second CH2 (position 2) on each pentyl group would be in the same environment, so their protons are equivalent. Same goes for position 3, position 4, and the terminal CH3.

Wait, but the position 4 on each chain is the fourth CH2, which is next to the terminal CH3. So, the second chain's position 4 is equivalent to the first chain's position 2? Because of the symmetry.

Wait, no. Let me imagine looking down the central carbon. The two pentyl chains are on either side. So, the first CH2 on each is next to C*. Then, the second CH2 on each is next to the first CH2, and so on.

Because of the mirror symmetry, the second CH2 on one chain is equivalent to the second CH2 on the other chain. Similarly, the third CH2 on each chain is equivalent, and the fourth CH2 on each is equivalent.

Wait, but for each CH2 group:

- Position 1: attached to C*, each chain has the same environment. So, the protons on each position 1 are equivalent.

- Position 2: each chain's position 2 is attached to position 1 CH2 and the next CH2. So, same environment on both chains. Equivalent.

- Position 3: same as above. Each chain's position 3 is equivalent.

- Position 4: same. Each chain's position 4 is equivalent.

Wait, but wait, position 4 is next to the CH3. So, for the first chain, position 4 is attached to position 3 and CH3. For the second chain, the same applies. So, yes, their environments are the same.

So, each position in the pentyl chains contributes a set of equivalent protons across both chains.

So, the NMR would show:

1. The protons on position 1 (attached to C*) → one signal.

2. The protons on position 2 → another signal.

3. The protons on position 3 → another signal.

4. The protons on position 4 → another signal.

5. The terminal CH3 groups → another signal.

Wait, but each of these groups has how many sets of equivalent protons?

Wait, each CH2 group has two protons, but if the environment is the same for both chains, all protons in that position are equivalent.

But wait, in each CH2 group, the two protons are equivalent because they are on the same carbon. So, each position would contribute one signal.

So, the pentyl groups contribute five distinct signals:

- Position 1: one set of H.

- Position 2: another.

- Position 3: another.

- Position 4: another.

- CH3 (position 5): another.

But wait, in the molecule, each CH2 group is in the same environment on both chains. So, the protons on each CH2 group are equivalent across both chains. Therefore, each position (1-4) contributes a single signal, and the CH3 contributes another.

Wait, but wait: the two pentyl groups are identical and symmetric, so the CH2 groups at the same position on each chain are equivalent. So, for each position (1-4), all the Hs are equivalent across both chains, so each contributes a single peak.

So, for the pentyl groups, total of 5 signals: 1, 2, 3, 4 (CH2s), and 5 (CH3).

But wait, no. The CH3 is at the end of each pentyl chain. Each CH3 is attached to a CH2, which is the same on both chains. So, the CH3 protons should be equivalent.

So, let me recount:

1. Position 1 (CH2 next to C*): 2 H, but equivalent on both chains. So, one signal.

2. Position 2 (CH2): same on both chains. One signal.

3. Position 3 (CH2): same on both chains. One signal.

4. Position 4 (CH2): same on both chains. One signal.

5. Position 5 (CH3): same on both chains. One signal.

So, that's 5 signals from the pentyl groups.

Wait, but wait a second. The CH3 group is at the end of each pentyl chain. So, each CH3 is attached to a CH2, which is part of a longer chain. Are the two CH3 groups equivalent? Because the molecule is symmetric, yes. So, their protons would be the same, contributing a single signal.

Similarly, each CH2 group in positions 1-4 is equivalent across both chains, so each gives a single signal.

So, total 5 signals from the pentyl groups.

But wait, the CH2 groups in position 3 are each attached to two CH2 groups (positions 2 and 4), so their environment is the same on both chains. So, their Hs are equivalent.

Therefore, the pentyl groups contribute 5 signals.

But wait, I'm getting 5 signals from the two pentyl groups. But am I missing anything else?

Wait, any other Hs in the molecule? The central C* has no Hs, the CN group has no Hs, and the carbonyl group has no Hs.

So, all the Hs are in the pentyl chains, giving 5 signals.

But wait, let me think again. Each CH2 group that is in the same position on both chains contributes the same signal.

So, the NMR would have:

- Position 1: a triplet? Or just a quartet? Wait, no, the splitting depends on neighboring protons. But in any case, the question is about the number of distinct signals, not the splitting.

So, number of signals is 5 from the pentyl groups.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: the CH2 groups in position 2 and 4 are equivalent due to the symmetry. So, perhaps the signals from positions 2 and 4 are the same.

Wait, are the environments of position 2 and 4 the same?

No, because position 2 is closer to the C*, while position 4 is further away, closer to the CH3.

So, the environments are different, so their signals would be different.

So, no, the positions 2 and 4 are not equivalent. So, their Hs contribute separate signals.

Thus, the pentyl groups contribute 5 signals.

Wait, but I must have made a mistake because the options don't have 5 as the correct answer. Wait, the options are A)8, B)5, C)10, D)12.

Wait, option B is 5. But I'm getting 5 from the pentyl groups, but wait, perhaps I'm missing other signals.

Wait, another possible source of Hs: the central C* is attached to the two pentyl groups, a carbonyl, and a cyano group. But, as I thought earlier, the C* doesn't have any H.

Wait, but what about the CN group? CN doesn't have any H, so no signal there.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the Hs on the carbonyl group? No, carbonyl is a double bond, no H.

Wait, so the entire Hs are in the two pentyl chains, giving 5 distinct signals.

But the options have 5 as option B. But I think I must be missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I didn't account for the fact that the two pentyl groups are attached to a central carbon that has other substituents, which could cause some of their CH2 groups to be in different environments.

Wait, perhaps the CH2 groups adjacent to the C* (position 1) are each in a different environment because one is attached to a carbonyl and the other to a cyano group.

Wait, no, because the molecule is symmetric with the two pentyl groups. The two pentyl groups are attached to the same C*, which is connected to a carbonyl and a cyano. So, each CH2 group in position 1 is attached to a C* that's connected to a carbonyl and a cyano. So, their environments are the same.

Wait, but wait, the substituents on C* are: two pentyl groups, a carbonyl, and a cyano. Therefore, each position 1 CH2 is attached to C*, which has the same substituents on both sides, so their environments are the same.

So, the two position 1 CH2s are equivalent, giving one signal.

Similarly, the other CH2 groups are equivalent across the two chains, giving their own signals.

So, I think I was correct earlier—the pentyl groups contribute five signals.

But that's only 5 signals. The options include option B as 5, but I suspect the correct answer is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the structure of product 4. Let me re-examine the synthesis steps.

Step 1: Acetic acid + bromine, pyridine, acetic anhydride, heat → product 1.

As I thought earlier, product 1 is CH3COBr (acetyl bromide).

Step 2: Product 1 (CH3COBr) heated with ethanol and H2SO4 → product 2.

That's a nucleophilic substitution, so product 2 is ethyl acetate: CH3COOCH2CH3.

Step 3: Product 2 treated with NaCN → product 3.

So, in this step, the ester (ethyl acetate) reacts with CN-.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong earlier. Let me think again. The reaction of an ester with NaCN would typically form an acyl cyanide, but how?

Wait, when an ester reacts with CN-, it's possible to substitute the OR group with CN. So, ester R-O-CO-R' + CN- → R-CN-CO-R' + RO-.

But wait, that might not be correct because the OR group is a poor leaving group. Unless the reaction is under basic conditions, where the OR is deprotonated to form a better leaving group.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where the ethoxide (OEt-) is replaced by CN-.

Wait, in the presence of a base like NaCN, maybe the ester is hydrolyzed to the acid, then the acid reacts with CN- to form the acyl cyanide. But that would require two steps.

Wait, but the reaction conditions are just NaCN. Maybe it's a nucleophilic acyl substitution where the CN- replaces the OR group.

So, product 3 would be CH3CO-CN, acetyl cyanide.

Step 4: Product 3 (CH3CO-CN) treated with excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane → product 4.

As I thought before, the NaH deprotonates the alpha H (the CH3 group), forming an enolate. The enolate then attacks 1,5-dibromopentane.

But 1,5-dibromopentane is a dihalide, so each substitution would add a pentyl group. Since there are two Br atoms, perhaps two substitutions occur, leading to two pentyl groups attached to the alpha carbon.

So, product 4 would be (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(=O)CN.

Wait, that's the same as before. So, the structure is correct.

Now, the NMR of product 4.

So, the molecule is (CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(=O)CN.

Each pentyl group is a five-carbon chain attached to the central carbon.

So, each pentyl group has five CH2 units and a terminal CH3.

Wait, no, five carbons in the chain: the first is attached to the central carbon (C*), then four more CH2 groups, ending in a CH3.

Wait, no. Wait, 1,5-dibromopentane is Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br. So, when the enolate attacks, it substitutes one Br, so the added group is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

So, each pentyl group is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, because substitution at the end would give a chain of five CH2 groups, ending in a CH3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

C(=O)CN
|
C* – (CH2)5-CH3 (but two of these)

Wait, no. Each substitution adds a CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- group. So, each chain is:

CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So, each chain is five carbons, with the first carbon attached to C*, and the last is a CH3.

So, each chain is:

C* – CH2 – CH2 – CH2 – CH2 – CH2 – CH3.

Wait, no, because each substitution adds a five-carbon group. So, each chain is five carbons in a row. So, the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- (with CH3 at the end).

Wait, but the substituent from 1,5-dibromopentane substitution is a -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- group, with the last carbon being CH2, not CH3. Because 1,5-dibromopentane is Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br. So, when you substitute Br with the enolate, you get -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- attached to C*.

Wait, but that can't be because that would make the chain five CH2 groups, which would end in another CH2, not a CH3.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me clarify.

When the enolate attacks 1,5-dibromopentane, which is Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br.

The enolate would attack one end, replacing Br with the enolate's R group. So, the product after substitution would have the structure:

R-C* – CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br.

Wait, no, because the substitution would replace a Br with the R group. So, the product would be R-C* – CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

Wait, but where is the Br? No, the dihalide is symmetric; each substitution would replace a Br with R.

Wait, perhaps each substitution adds a five-carbon chain to the central carbon.

So, the structure after two substitutions would be:

(CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-)2C(=O)CN.

But each chain is five carbons, and the last carbon is CH2, not CH3. So, perhaps the structure is:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(=O)CN.

In this case, each chain is five CH2 groups, with no terminal CH3.

Wait, that can't be right because 1,5-dibromopentane has five carbons and ends in CH2Br. So, substitution would lead to each chain ending in CH2.

Wait, but then where's the CH3? There isn't one. So, perhaps the structure is (CH2)5 groups attached to C*.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me correct this.

The structure of 1,5-dibromopentane is Br-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-Br. So, when the enolate attacks, it will substitute one Br, leading to the addition of a five-carbon chain.

So, each substitution adds the group -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

But wait, that can't be, because the enolate attacks at the end of the dihalide, so the substituent would be -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a five-carbon chain with all CH2 groups, ending in another CH2 (since the Br was at the end). So, the substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-.

But that would mean each substituent is a five-carbon chain, but without a CH3 at the end.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think of it this way: when the enolate attacks 1,5-dibromopentane, it substitutes one Br. So, for each substitution, the substituent added is a five-carbon chain with a CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- group attached to C*.

But that would make the substituent a straight chain of five CH2 groups, which can't be right because that would require the substituent to end with another CH2 group, not a CH3.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let's try a different approach. Let me consider the number of NMR signals again.

Each substituent is a pentyl group: five carbons in a row, with the first carbon attached to C*, and the last being a CH3.

So, each substituent is -CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, because 1,5-dibromopentane has five carbons, so the substituent would be five carbons, making each substituent a pentyl group.

So, each substituent is CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3.

So, each substituent is a five-carbon chain ending in CH3.

Thus, each substituent has the structure:

C* – CH2 – CH2 – CH2 – CH2 – CH3.

So, each substituent is a pentyl group.

Now, considering the NMR:

Each substituent (pentyl group) has five unique sets of Hs, as previously thought.

But wait, the molecule has two pentyl groups attached to C*. Due to the symmetry between the two substituents, the Hs in equivalent positions on each substituent will have the same chemical shift.

So, for each substituent:

- The first CH2 (attached to C*) is position 1.

- The next CH2 is position 2.

- Then position 3.

- Then position 4.

- And the terminal CH3 is position 5.

But the environment of position 1 on each substituent is the same because the substituents are identical and the molecule is symmetric. So, the Hs in position 1 on each substituent are equivalent.

Similarly, the Hs in position 2 on each substituent are equivalent, and so on for positions 3 and 4. The terminal CH3 groups are also equivalent.

So, we have:

1. Position 1: one signal.

2. Position 2: another.

3. Position 3: another.

4. Position 4: another.

5. Position 5 (CH3): another.

Thus, five signals from the two pentyl groups.

But wait, in the structure I have, the substituent is a pentyl group. So, perhaps the NMR would show five signals for the substituents.

But the options have 5 as option B, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Another possibility is that I'm missing some signals.

Wait, perhaps the enolate substitution leads to more than two substituents. No, it's two substituents, each a pentyl group.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the substituents are longer than five carbons? No, the substituent comes from 1,5-dibromopentane, which is five carbons.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering the possibility of the molecule being more complex. Let me think.

Another possibility: the substitution doesn't add the entire pentyl group but only a portion. For example, perhaps the enolate adds a three-carbon group. But that doesn't seem right because the dihalide is pentane.

Alternatively, perhaps each substitution adds a four-carbon group. But I think the reaction adds the entire five-carbon chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substitution leads to branching, but that doesn't seem likely here.

Wait, perhaps the product is a gem-dialkylation, where the enolate attacks both ends of the dihalide, leading to two substituents on the same carbon. So, the structure would be:

(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2)2C(=O)CN.

In that case, each substituent is a pentyl group, and the molecule is symmetric.

So, the NMR would have:

- Each CH2 group in the pentyl substituents would contribute a signal.

- The terminal CH3 groups would contribute another.

But given the symmetry, each position (1-4) would have equivalent Hs across both substituents, leading to five signals.

So, I'm confident that the NMR would have five signals from the substituents.

But the options have B)5, which would be the answer.

Wait, but wait, the question says, "how many distinct hydrogen signals will be observable in the 1H NMR spectrum of 4?"

If the structure is symmetric, and each substituent's Hs are equivalent, then the answer would be 5.

But looking at the options, option B is 5.

Another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in the structure, and the substituents are longer, leading to more signals.

Wait, let me think again about product 4.

If product 3 is CH3-C(=O)-CN, and when treated with excess NaH and 1,5-dibromopentane, perhaps the enolate attacks both ends of the dihalide, leading to two substituents.

So, the product would be (CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-)2C(=O)CN.

Wait, each substituent is a five-carbon chain with all CH2 groups, no terminal CH3. So, the substituent is -(CH2)5-.

In that case, each substituent has four CH2 groups and one CH2 attached to C*.

So, each substituent has five CH2 groups, no CH3.

In this structure, each substituent is a straight chain of five CH2 groups.

So, the NMR would have:

- The CH2 groups in each substituent.

But with two substituents, each having five CH2 groups, but due to symmetry, equivalent.

Wait, no. Each substituent is a chain of five CH2 groups. So, each substituent has:

Position 1: CH2 (attached to C*)

Position 2: CH2

Position 3: CH2

Position 4: CH2

Position 5: CH2.

So, each substituent has five CH2 groups, all in a row.

Now, considering the molecule's symmetry, the Hs in each position across the two substituents are equivalent.

So, for each substituent's CH2 groups:

1. Position 1: equivalent across both substituents → one signal.

2. Position 2: same → one signal.

3. Position 3: same → one signal.

4. Position 4: same → one signal.

5. Position 5: same → one signal.

Thus, five signals from the substituents.

But wait, that's five signals, same as before.

So, the total number of signals is five.

But why is option B)5 an option? Because the other options are higher numbers.

Wait, am I missing any other Hs in the molecule? Let me think.

The central carbon (C*) doesn't have any Hs. The CN group has no Hs. The carbonyl group has no Hs. The only Hs are in the substituent chains.

So, total of five signals.

So, the correct answer would be 5, which is option B.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck because I thought the correct answer might be higher, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Another possibility: Perhaps the substituents are longer, leading to more CH2 groups, thus more signals.

Wait, no, the substituents are five carbons each, so each has five CH2 groups.

Wait, no, the substituent is five carbons, including the one attached to C*. So, each substituent has five CH2 groups.

Wait, but that would mean each substituent is five CH2 groups, leading to five different environments for each CH2 group, but with symmetry leading to five signals.

So, the NMR would show five signals.

So, the answer should be 5, option B.


The problem involves a multi-step synthesis starting with acetic acid and ending with a final product, whose ¹H NMR spectrum is analyzed for distinct hydrogen signals. Here's the breakdown:

---

### Reaction Steps and Product Analysis:

1. **Step 1: Acetic acid + bromine, pyridine, and acetic anhydride (heating)**  
   Acetic acid reacts with bromine in the presence of pyridine and acetic anhydride to form **acetyl bromide (CH₃COBr)**. Pyridine acts as a base, neutralizing HBr formed during the reaction.

2. **Step 2: Acetyl bromide + ethanol and sulfuric acid (heating)**  
   Acetyl bromide undergoes nucleophilic acyl substitution with ethanol, forming **ethyl acetate (CH₃COOCH₂CH₃)**. Sulfuric acid acts as a catalyst.

3. **Step 3: Ethyl acetate + sodium cyanide**  
   Ethyl acetate reacts with sodium cyanide (NaCN) via nucleophilic acyl substitution, replacing the ethoxy group (-OCH₂CH₃) with a cyano group (-CN). The product is **acetyl cyanide (CH₃COCN)**.

4. **Step 4: Acetyl cyanide + excess sodium hydride (NaH) and 1,5-dibromopentane**  
   Sodium hydride deprotonates the methyl group adjacent to the carbonyl, forming an enolate. The enolate attacks 1,5-dibromopentane, a dihalide, leading to **gem-dialkylation**. The final product is **(CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂)₂C(=O)CN**, where the central carbon is bonded to two pentyl groups, a carbonyl group, and a cyano group.

### NMR Analysis of the Final Product:

The final product, **(CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂CH₂)₂C(=O)CN**, has two identical pentyl chains attached to the central carbon. The molecule is symmetric, and the environments of protons in equivalent positions on the two pentyl chains are identical. The analysis of distinct hydrogen signals is as follows:

1. **Position 1 (CH₂ attached to C*)**: The CH₂ group directly bonded to the central carbon contributes one signal.  
2. **Position 2 (CH₂)**: The CH₂ group in the second position of each pentyl chain contributes another signal.  
3. **Position 3 (CH₂)**: The CH₂ group in the third position of each pentyl chain contributes another signal.  
4. **Position 4 (CH₂)**: The CH₂ group in the fourth position of each pentyl chain contributes another signal.  
5. **Position 5 (CH₃)**: The terminal CH₃ group at the end of each pentyl chain contributes another signal.

Thus, there are **5 distinct hydrogen environments** in the molecule, leading to **5 signals** in the ¹H NMR spectrum.

---

### Conclusion:

The number of distinct hydrogen signals observable in the ¹H NMR spectrum of the final product is **5**.

**Answer: B**
