Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a Lagrangian and determining the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The given Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. And σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν]. Right, the gamma matrices. So, first, I need to figure out the mass dimension of κ.

Wait, I remember that in quantum field theory, the mass dimension of the Lagrangian density must be 4 because the action has to be dimensionless in natural units (like ℏ = c = 1). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

Let's break down each part of the term. The term is κ multiplied by ψ̄, σ_{μν}, ψ, and F^{μν}.

First, what's the mass dimension of each field? I think the Dirac spinor ψ has mass dimension 3/2. Because for a scalar field φ, it's 1, and each derivative adds a dimension, so maybe that's similar. Wait, no, for a Dirac spinor, it's 3/2. Because in 4 dimensions, the action integral is ∫ d^4x L, so each term in L must be dimension 4. For example, in the Dirac equation, the term i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ would have ψ with dimension 3/2 because the derivative has dimension 1, and the term must be dimension 4. Let me check: i γ ∂ ψ. The ψ is 3/2, ∂ is 1, so the term is (3/2) +1 =5/2. Wait, but that's multiplied by γ matrices, which are dimensionless. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong. Wait, actually, the term in the Lagrangian would be something like the kinetic term: ψ̄ i γ^μ ∂_μ ψ. So ψ̄ is also 3/2, because it's like ψ^dagger γ^0, which has same dimension as ψ. So ψ̄ i γ ∂ ψ would have 3/2 + 3/2 + 1 (from ∂) = 4. Oh right, yes, that makes sense. So each ψ and ψ̄ is 3/2.

Next, F^{μν} is the field strength tensor for electromagnetism, I think. Or wait, this could be a non-Abelian field, but maybe it doesn't matter for the dimension. The field strength F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, right? So each F has the same dimension as ∂ A. The gauge field A has mass dimension 1 because, for Maxwell theory, the term like F^2 would be (∂A)^2, which is (mass)^2, so F has dimension 2. Wait wait, no. Wait, in Maxwell's theory, the term is (F_{μν})^2, so each F has dimension 2 because (F^2) would be (2)^2 =4, which is correct for the Lagrangian term. So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The gauge field A has dimension 1 because the covariant derivative is ∂ - i e A, which must have the same dimension as ∂, which is 1. So A has dimension 1. Then F_{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, which is ∂ (A), so each derivative has dimension 1, A has 1, so F has dimension 1 +1 =2? No, wait, ∂ has dimension 1, and A is dimension 1, so each term in F is ∂ A, which would be 1 +1 =2. So F has dimension 2.

So putting the pieces together.

The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ and ψ each contribute 3/2. σ_{μν} is made of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (they are just matrices, no mass scaling). So σ doesn't change the dimension. Then F^{μν} is 2.

So the product of the fields:

ψ̄ (3/2) * ψ (3/2) * F (2) = 3/2 +3/2 +2 = (3/2 *2) =3, plus 2 is 5? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because each ψ is 3/2, and F is 2. So 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 4.

Wait, no: 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. Wait, that's 5, but the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So the term κ times all that must be dimension 4. So κ must have dimension (4 -5) = -1.

Because: [κ] * [ψ̄] * [σ] * [ψ] * [F] = [κ] * (3/2) * (dimensionless) * (3/2) * (2) ) = [κ] * ( (3/2)^2 * 2 ) = [κ] * (9/4 * 2) ) = [κ] * (9/2) ?

Wait, wait, no, no. Let me compute each part correctly.

The term is: κ * ψ̄ * σ_{μν} * ψ * F^{μν}

So each component's dimension:

κ → what we're trying to find.

ψ̄ → 3/2

σ_{μν}: made from [γ_mu, gamma_nu], which are dimensionless. So σ is dimensionless.

ψ → 3/2

F^{μν} → 2.

So the product is:

κ * (3/2) * (3/2) * (2) ) = κ * ( (3/2)^2 * 2 ) = κ * (9/4 * 2 )= κ * (9/2).

Wait, 9/2 is 4.5. Because 3/2 *3/2 is 9/4, times 2 is 9/2.

So the term must have mass dimension 4.

So [κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] +3/2 +3/2 +2 = [κ] + (3/2 *2) +2 = [κ] +3 +2 = [κ] +5 = [Lagrangian term] is 4.

So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]= -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.

Now, the second part: is the theory renormalizable?

Renormalizability depends on the mass dimension of the coupling constant. The rule of thumb is that a theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have non-negative mass dimension. Wait, no, actually, no. Wait, I think the condition is that the coupling's dimension must be less than or equal to 4 in 4 dimensions. Because the superficial degree of divergence is given by D = d - (n_φ (d_φ) - L), where n_φ is the number of fields, d_φ the dimension of each, and L is the number of loops, but perhaps I'm getting mixed up.

Wait, another approach: the interaction term is part of the Lagrangian, which has dimension 4. The term's dimension is [κ] + [ψ̄][ψ][F] = 4.

The interaction is a vertex with certain fields. For renormalizability, the dimension of the coupling must satisfy [κ] >= 0. Because, I think, if the dimension is negative, the interaction becomes relevant, which might lead to non-renormalizable interactions.

Wait, no, actually, I think the other way around. Wait, for a term in the Lagrangian, the maximum dimension allowed for a renormalizable theory is 4, and the coupling's dimension can't be negative. Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the superficial degree of divergence.

In four dimensions, the superficial degree of divergence D is given by D = 4 - (n_f * [field] + n_v * [vertices] ), but wait, perhaps it's better to think about the scaling. Let me think about the term in the Lagrangian.

Each coupling's dimension affects the renormalizability. For a term to be renormalizable, the coupling must have a mass dimension less than or equal to 4. Because, in four dimensions, the dimension of the coupling [g] must satisfy [g] >= - (4 - (sum of dimensions of fields)). Or wait, maybe I need to think about the scaling of the coupling with energy.

Wait, another approach: The coupling constant's dimension, [κ], is -1. So in terms of energy scaling, when you go to higher energies (or equivalently, larger momentum scales μ), the coupling grows like μ^(-1), which is bad because at high energies, the coupling becomes larger, leading to possible non-perturbative effects and making the perturbative expansion unreliable. Therefore, such a theory would require an infinite number of counterterms, making it non-renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. I think the general rule is that in a renormalizable theory, the coupling constants must have positive or zero mass dimension. Because if the dimension is negative, the interaction becomes relevant, leading to Landau poles and non-renormalizable behavior.

Wait, here [κ] is -1, which is negative. So the theory is not renormalizable.

Putting it all together: [κ] = -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. So looking at the options, option C says [κ]=-1 and theory is not renormalizable. Option A says [κ]=-1 and theory is renormalizable, which can't be right. So the correct option is C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant \(\kappa\) and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where \(\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2} [\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]\), and the fields involved are the Dirac spinor \(\psi\), the field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\), and the coupling constant \(\kappa\).

### Step 1: Mass dimension of the fields
- The Dirac spinor \(\psi\) has mass dimension \([ \psi ]_M = \frac{3}{2}\). Its adjoint \(\bar{\psi}\) has the same dimension, \([ \bar{\psi} ]_M = \frac{3}{2}\).
- The field strength tensor \(F^{\mu\nu}\) has mass dimension \([ F ]_M = 2\), as it is derived from derivatives of the gauge field \(A_\mu\), which has dimension 1.

### Step 2: Mass dimension of \(\kappa\)
The Lagrangian density must have mass dimension 4 in 4 spacetime dimensions. The term \(\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}\) must therefore satisfy:
\[
[ \kappa ]_M + [ \bar{\psi} ]_M + [ \psi ]_M + [ F ]_M = 4.
\]
Substituting the dimensions of the fields:
\[
[ \kappa ]_M + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = 4.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
[ \kappa ]_M + 4 = 4 \implies [ \kappa ]_M = -1.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, \([ \kappa ]_M = -1\), which is negative. This implies that the interaction becomes relevant at high energies, leading to an infinite number of counterterms and making the theory non-renormalizable.

### Conclusion
The mass dimension of \(\kappa\) is \(-1\), and the theory is not renormalizable. Comparing with the options:

- **A)** Incorrect: Claims \([ \kappa ]_M = -1\) but states the theory is renormalizable.
- **B)** Incorrect: Claims \([ \kappa ]_M = 1\), which is wrong.
- **C)** Correct: States \([ \kappa ]_M = -1\) and the theory is not renormalizable.
- **D)** Incorrect: Claims \([ \kappa ]_M = 1\) and states the theory is not renormalizable, both of which are wrong.

**Answer: C**

The field strength F_{μν} is ∂_μ A_ν - ∂_ν A_μ, right? So each F has the same dimension as ∂ A. The gauge field A has mass dimension 1 because, for Maxwell theory, the term like F^2 would be (∂A)^2, which is (mass)^2, so F has dimension 2. Wait wait, no. Wait, in Maxwell's theory, the term is (F_{μν})^2, so each F has dimension 2 because (F^2) would be (2)^2 =4, which is correct for the Lagrangian term. So F^{μν} has dimension 2.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The gauge field A has dimension 1 because the covariant derivative is ∂ - i e A, which must have the same dimension as ∂, which is 1. So A has dimension 1. Then F_{μν} is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, which is ∂ (A), so each derivative has dimension 1, A has 1, so F has dimension 1 +1 =2? No, wait, ∂ has dimension 1, and A is dimension 1, so each term in F is ∂ A, which would be 1 +1 =2. So F has dimension 2.

So putting the pieces together.

The term is κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each ψ is 3/2, so ψ̄ and ψ each contribute 3/2. σ_{μν} is made of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (they are just matrices, no mass scaling). So σ doesn't change the dimension. Then F^{μν} is 2.

So the product of the fields:

ψ̄ (3/2) * ψ (3/2) * F (2) = 3/2 +3/2 +2 = (3/2 *2) =3, plus 2 is 5? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because each ψ is 3/2, and F is 2. So 3/2 + 3/2 + 2 = 4.

Wait, no: 3/2 +3/2 is 3, plus 2 is 5. Wait, that's 5, but the Lagrangian term must have dimension 4. So the term κ times all that must be dimension 4. So κ must have dimension (4 -5) = -1.

Because: [κ] * [ψ̄] * [σ] * [ψ] * [F] = [κ] * (3/2) * (dimensionless) * (3/2) * (2) ) = [κ] * ( (3/2)^2 * 2 ) = [κ] * (9/4 * 2) ) = [κ] * (9/2) ?

Wait, wait, no, no. Let me compute each part correctly.

The term is: κ * ψ̄ * σ_{μν} * ψ * F^{μν}

So each component's dimension:

κ → what we're trying to find.

ψ̄ → 3/2

σ_{μν}: made from [γ_mu, gamma_nu], which are dimensionless. So σ is dimensionless.

ψ → 3/2

F^{μν} → 2.

So the product is:

κ * (3/2) * (3/2) * (2) ) = κ * ( (3/2)^2 * 2 ) = κ * (9/4 * 2 )= κ * (9/2).

Wait, 9/2 is 4.5. Because 3/2 *3/2 is 9/4, times 2 is 9/2.

So the term must have mass dimension 4.

So [κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] +3/2 +3/2 +2 = [κ] + (3/2 *2) +2 = [κ] +3 +2 = [κ] +5 = [Lagrangian term] is 4.

So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]= -1.

So the mass dimension of κ is -1.
