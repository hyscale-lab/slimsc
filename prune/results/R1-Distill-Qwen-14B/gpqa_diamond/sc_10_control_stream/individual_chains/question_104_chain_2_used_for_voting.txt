Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets detected using the radial velocity method. Hmm, radial velocity, that's the method where the star's movement is measured due to the planet's gravity, right? So the star moves back and forth, and we detect that through shifts in its spectral lines.

The question says that there are two stars, both with the same mass as the Sun. Each has a planet with a mass similar to Neptune. Both planets are in circular orbits. So the setup is similar in some ways.

The detection is done via the RV method. The key data here are the shifts in the spectral lines. For planet #1, the shift is up to 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7 milliangstroms. Wait, milli is 10^-3, so 5e-3 and 7e-3 angstroms.

Wait, the RV method measures the Doppler shift. The Doppler shift depends on the velocity of the star towards or away from us. The formula for Doppler shift is delta_lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the velocity and c is the speed of light. But in this case, the shift is given as delta_lambda, so delta_lambda = (v/c) * lambda.

Wait, but wait, the actual formula for the Doppler shift when the source is moving towards us is: (lambda - lambda0)/lambda0 = -v/c. But for small velocities, we can approximate it as delta_lambda / lambda = v/c.

But here, the shift is given in milliangstroms, which is the change in wavelength. So the observed shift is proportional to the velocity of the star. Because both stars have the same mass, and the planets have similar mass, but the shifts are different.

Wait, but in the RV method, the semi-amplitude K is the velocity semi-amplitude. K is the maximum velocity of the star towards or away from us. So K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(1/3)) ) or something like that... Wait, I need to remember the formula. The RV semi-amplitude is given by:

K = (v) = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1/sin i) )

But since M_p is much less than M_star (Sun-like stars and Neptune mass), M_star + M_p ≈ M_star, so that term simplifies. Also, sin i is about 1 for edge-on orbits, which is the case for RV detection (since it's most effective when the orbital plane is edge-on, i=90 degrees). So the formula simplifies.

Alternatively, I remember that the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / M_star^(2/3)) ) * (1/(1 + (M_p/M_star))^(1/3)) )

But since M_p is much smaller than M_star, that factor is approximately 1. So K ≈ (M_p / (M_star^(2/3))) )^(1/1) ) * (something with the period and other factors).

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the formula for K. The formula is:

K = [ (2π G) / (c P) ) ]^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) )

But since M_p << M_star, this becomes:

K ≈ ( (2π G ) / (c P) )^(1/3) * (M_p / M_star^(2/3) )

Hmm, but maybe there's another approach. I think another way to approach this is considering that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(1/3))) ) * (1/(P^(1/3))) ), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should consider what causes the Doppler shift. The larger the velocity of the star (K), the larger the shift in wavelength. So for a given setup (same star mass, same planet mass), if K is larger, the shift is larger.

Wait, but no, in the question, the stars have same mass, and the planets have same mass. So why are the shifts different? Because the orbital periods are different, perhaps. Or maybe because the orbital velocities of the stars are different.

Wait, the RV method measures the star's velocity, which depends on the mass of the planet, the star's mass, and the orbital parameters.

Wait, the formula for K is:

K = (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(1/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * (1 day) )^(1/3) )

Wait, no, maybe it's better to think in terms of another formula. Let me see.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * P ) / (2π c^3) ) ]^(-1/3) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3))

Wait, I'm not fully confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to note that, given the same star mass and same planet mass, the semi-amplitude K (which relates to the velocity shift) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period P.

Wait, I think the formula is K = (v) = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 c^3) )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) (1 + M_p/M_star)^(1/3)) ) * (1/(P) )

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, since both stars have the same mass and both planets have the same mass, the ratio of their semi-amplitudes (K) should be the inverse cube root of the ratio of their periods. Because the Doppler shift is proportional to velocity, and velocity is proportional to K.

Wait, the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^(1/3) * (P)^(1/3)) )

Wait, that's probably not the right way. Let me think again.

The radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = [ (G * (M_p) ) / ( (M_star)^(1/3) * (P * (1 day) ) ) ) ]^(1/3) * [ ... something about the orbital distance? ]

Wait, perhaps I should recall that for the same star and planet mass, the semi-amplitude K is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital period. No, wait, more accurately, K is inversely proportional to the cube root of the period, because the orbital period is related to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law.

Wait, Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² G M_star) )^(−1) * a³. So a³ = G M_star P² / (4 π²).

But the velocity of the star (the semi-amplitude K) is related to the planet's velocity. Since the planet and star orbit their common center of mass, the star's velocity is (M_p/(M_p + M_star)) * planet's velocity. But since M_p << M_star, this is approximately (M_p / M_star) * v_planet.

The planet's velocity v_planet is 2π a / P. So substituting, K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (2π a / P).

But from Kepler's law, a³ = G M_star P² / (4 π² )

So a = [ G M_star P² / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting that into the K equation:

K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (2 π / P) * [ G M_star P² / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify this:

Let me compute the exponents. Let me write each term:

= (M_p / M_star) * (2 π / P ) * [ (G M_star P² )^(1/3) ) / (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ]

= (M_p / M_star) * (2 π / P ) * [ ( G^(1/3) M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) ) / ( (4 π² )^(1/3) ) )

Now, let's collect terms:

= (M_p / M_star) * (2 π )/( P ) * [ G^(1/3) M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) ) / ( (4 π² )^(1/3) ) )

= M_p / M_star * (2 π / P ) * [ ( G M_star P² )^(1/3) ) / (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps simplifying the exponents:

Let me consider each term:

- M_p / M_star: M_p / M_star

- 2 π / P: (2 π) / P

- [ (G M_star P² )^(1/3) ) ]: G^(1/3) M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3)

- Divided by (4 π² )^(1/3): which is 4^(1/3) π^(2/3)

So putting it all together:

M_p / M_star * (2 π) / P * [ G^(1/3) M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) )

Let's combine like terms:

M_p / M_star * (2 π) / P * [ (G M_star P² )^(1/3) ) / (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's better to write each term's exponents as fractions:

= M_p * M_star^(-1) * 2 π * P^(-1) * G^(1/3) * M_star^(1/3) * P^(2/3) * 4^(-1/3) * π^(-2/3 )

Now, let's combine all the exponents for each variable.

For M_star:

-1 (from M_p/M_star) + 1/3 (from M_star^(1/3)) = (-3/3 + 1/3) = (-2/3)

For π:

1 (from 2π) - 2/3 (from π^(-2/3)) = (3/3 - 2/3) = 1/3

For P:

-1 (from 1/P) + 2/3 (from P^(2/3)) = (-3/3 + 2/3) = (-1/3)

So now, the expression becomes:

M_p * G^(1/3) * 2 * 4^(-1/3) * π^(1/3) * M_star^(-2/3) * P^(-1/3)

Factor out constants:

2 * 4^(-1/3) = 2 / (4^(1/3)) ) = 2/( (2^2)^(1/3) ) ) = 2/(2^(2/3)) )= 2^(1 - 2/3) ) = 2^(1/3) )

So 2 / 4^(1/3) = 2^(1/3) * 2^(1) / 2^(2/3) ) = wait, maybe I should compute 4^(1/3) is 2^(2/3). So 2 / 2^(2/3) ) = 2^(1 - 2/3) ) = 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26.

Wait, but perhaps just leave it as 2/(4^(1/3)) for now.

Similarly, π^(1/3) is cube root of pi.

Putting it all together, K is proportional to:

(2 / 4^(1/3)) ) * (π^(1/3)) ) * [ M_p / (M_star^(2/3) ) ) ] * [ 1 / (P^(1/3) ) )

So K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But in this question, M_p is same for both planets, M_star is same for both stars. So K ∝ 1 / (P^(1/3) )

So for K1 and K2, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, no. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 = [ something ] / P1^(1/3 ), K2 = [ same something ] / P2^(1/3 )

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

But wait, in the question, the shifts (K) are given. The shift magnitude is proportional to K. So the shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7.

So K1 = 5, K2 =7.

So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

But from the above, K1/K2 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

So 5/7 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So (P2/P1 ) = (5/7 )^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.364 times that of planet #1.

But wait, the question is asking how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1. So P2 / P1 ≈ 0.364. So that would be about 0.36 times as long.

But looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

So the answer would be option A.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the logic.

If K is proportional to 1 / (P^(1/3) ), then higher K means shorter period. Because if P increases, K decreases.

So if K2 > K1, then P2 < P1. So P2 is shorter than P1. So P2 = (K1/K2 )^3 * P1.

Wait, K1/K2 =5/7. So (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈0.364. So P2 =0.364 * P1.

So P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of 0.364.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2 / P1 =0.364, so it's 0.364 times as long.

So the correct answer is A) ~0.36.

The question involves determining how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, given that both planets were detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method measures the Doppler shift caused by the star's motion due to the gravitational pull of the planet. The key data provided are the shifts in the spectral lines: 5 milliangstroms for planet #1 and 7 milliangstroms for planet #2.

The RV semi-amplitude \( K \), which is proportional to the star's velocity, depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, and the orbital period \( P \). For stars and planets with the same mass, \( K \) is inversely proportional to \( P^{1/3} \). This relationship can be expressed as:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

Given that \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \), the ratio of the semi-amplitudes is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \approx 0.714
\]

Since \( K \propto P^{-1/3} \), the ratio of the periods is related to the inverse cube of the ratio of the semi-amplitudes:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.364 times that of planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1.

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**

Wait, that's probably not the right way. Let me think again.

The planet's velocity v_planet is 2π a / P. So substituting, K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (2π a / P).

But from Kepler's law, a³ = G M_star P² / (4 π² )

So a = [ G M_star P² / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting that into the K equation:

K ≈ (M_p / M_star) * (2 π / P) * [ G M_star P² / (4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Simplify this:

Let me compute the exponents. Let me write each term:

= (M_p / M_star) * (2 π / P ) * [ (G M_star P² )^(1/3) ) / (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ]

= (M_p / M_star) * (2 π / P ) * [ ( G^(1/3) M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) ) / ( (4 π² )^(1/3) ) )

Now, let's collect terms:

= (M_p / M_star) * (2 π )/( P ) * [ G^(1/3) M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) ) / ( (4 π² )^(1/3) ) )

= M_p / M_star * (2 π / P ) * [ ( G M_star P² )^(1/3) ) / (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ]

Hmm, perhaps simplifying the exponents:

Let me consider each term:

- M_p / M_star: M_p / M_star

- 2 π / P: (2 π) / P

- [ (G M_star P² )^(1/3) ) ]: G^(1/3) M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3)

- Divided by (4 π² )^(1/3): which is 4^(1/3) π^(2/3)

So putting it all together:

M_p / M_star * (2 π) / P * [ G^(1/3) M_star^(1/3) P^(2/3) ) / (4^(1/3) π^(2/3) ) )

Let's combine like terms:

M_p / M_star * (2 π) / P * [ (G M_star P² )^(1/3) ) / (4 π² )^(1/3) ) ]

Wait, perhaps it's better to write each term's exponents as fractions:

= M_p * M_star^(-1) * 2 π * P^(-1) * G^(1/3) * M_star^(1/3) * P^(2/3) * 4^(-1/3) * π^(-2/3 )

Now, let's combine all the exponents for each variable.

For M_star:

-1 (from M_p/M_star) + 1/3 (from M_star^(1/3)) = (-3/3 + 1/3) = (-2/3)

For π:

1 (from 2π) - 2/3 (from π^(-2/3)) = (3/3 - 2/3) = 1/3

For P:

-1 (from 1/P) + 2/3 (from P^(2/3)) = (-3/3 + 2/3) = (-1/3)

So now, the expression becomes:

M_p * G^(1/3) * 2 * 4^(-1/3) * π^(1/3) * M_star^(-2/3) * P^(-1/3)

Factor out constants:

2 * 4^(-1/3) = 2 / (4^(1/3)) ) = 2/( (2^2)^(1/3) ) ) = 2/(2^(2/3)) )= 2^(1 - 2/3) ) = 2^(1/3) )

So 2 / 4^(1/3) = 2^(1/3) * 2^(1) / 2^(2/3) ) = wait, maybe I should compute 4^(1/3) is 2^(2/3). So 2 / 2^(2/3) ) = 2^(1 - 2/3) ) = 2^(1/3) ≈ 1.26.

Wait, but perhaps just leave it as 2/(4^(1/3)) for now.

Similarly, π^(1/3) is cube root of pi.

Putting it all together, K is proportional to:

(2 / 4^(1/3)) ) * (π^(1/3)) ) * [ M_p / (M_star^(2/3) ) ) ] * [ 1 / (P^(1/3) ) )

So K ∝ (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But in this question, M_p is same for both planets, M_star is same for both stars. So K ∝ 1 / (P^(1/3) )

So for K1 and K2, K1 / K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

Wait, no. Because K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3). So K1 = [ something ] / P1^(1/3 ), K2 = [ same something ] / P2^(1/3 )

So K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

But wait, in the question, the shifts (K) are given. The shift magnitude is proportional to K. So the shift for planet #1 is 5 milliangstroms, and for planet #2, it's 7.

So K1 = 5, K2 =7.

So K1/K2 = 5/7 ≈ 0.714.

But from the above, K1/K2 = (P2/P1 )^(1/3 )

So 5/7 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So (P2/P1 ) = (5/7 )^3 = (125)/(343) ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is approximately 0.364 times P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.364 times that of planet #1.

But wait, the question is asking how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1. So P2 / P1 ≈ 0.364. So that would be about 0.36 times as long.

But looking at the options, option A is ~0.36.

So the answer would be option A.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the logic.

If K is proportional to 1 / (P^(1/3) ), then higher K means shorter period. Because if P increases, K decreases.

So if K2 > K1, then P2 < P1. So P2 is shorter than P1. So P2 = (K1/K2 )^3 * P1.

Wait, K1/K2 =5/7. So (5/7)^3 = (125)/(343) ≈0.364. So P2 =0.364 * P1.

So P2 is shorter than P1 by a factor of 0.364.

So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So P2 / P1 =0.364, so it's 0.364 times as long.

So the correct answer is A) ~0.36.

\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{K_1}{K_2}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( \frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{5}{7} \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.364 times that of planet #1. Therefore, the orbital period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times as long as that of planet #1.

The correct answer is:
