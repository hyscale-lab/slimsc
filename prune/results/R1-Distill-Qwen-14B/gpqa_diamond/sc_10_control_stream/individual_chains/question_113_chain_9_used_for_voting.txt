Okay, so I have this question about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says the compound was characterized with FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Oh wait, but a broad peak could also be from an amine, but I don't think that's relevant here since the options don't include nitrogen. So, maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Then, there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. I remember that carbonyl groups (like in ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc.) absorb around 1700. The 1650 might be something else. Maybe an aromatic ring? Like C=C stretching? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or something with conjugation. Alternatively, the 1650 could be an amide, but again, no N here.

Wait, if the 1700 is a carbonyl, maybe the 1650 is an aromatic C=C stretch. So the compound might have both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring. Or perhaps another carbonyl group? Like maybe an ester has two carbonyls? Wait, no, esters have one carbonyl. Hmm.

Looking at the 1H NMR: there are peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means double bond, so the compound has a double bond, probably in an alkene or maybe an aromatic ring. Wait, aromatic rings would give more complex splitting, but vinyl could refer to an isolated double bond elsewhere.

Mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. That's a key point. I need to think about what fragments have a mass of 45. Common fragments include CH3COOH (45?), or something like CHO, but let me check. Wait, the molecular ion might break into smaller fragments. For example, the fragment could be a CH2O group (formaldehyde is 30, but maybe something else). Alternatively, 45 could be (CH3)2O if that's a fragment, but I'm not sure.

Now, looking at the options:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

The molecular formulas all have six carbons. Let me calculate their degrees of unsaturation to see possible structures.

Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 - H - 0)/2.

For option A: C6H12O2. H=12.
(2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So 1 degree: could be a ring or double bond. But wait, O doesn't affect the degree of unsaturation. So 1. Hmm.

Option B: C6H10O. H=10.
(14 -10)/2 = 2. So two degrees. Could be two rings, a ring plus a double bond, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. H=10.
(14-10)/2=2. Two degrees.

Option D: C6H12O. H=12.
Same as A: (14-12)/2=1.

Wait, but I thought the IR had a carbonyl (which is a double bond, so that's a degree) and a broad peak for O-H. So if there's a carbonyl and an O-H, that uses up two degrees. Let me check each option's degrees.

Wait, maybe I should think about the IR again. The broad peak is probably O-H, so that's one group. The peaks at 1700 and 1650. Let me think: a carbonyl group (like ester, ketone, etc.) is at 1700. The 1650 could be conjugated double bonds. For example, in an ester group, the carbonyl is around 1700, and maybe an aromatic ring's C=C would be around 1600-1650. But wait, the 1650 is a bit high for a regular aromatic C=C. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. That would cause the carbonyl peak to be lower? Wait, no, maybe higher. Or perhaps it's an amide, but no N here.

Wait, maybe the 1650 is from a C=O in a conjugated system. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl oxygen with some conjugation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is from an aromatic ring (so benzene ring) and the 1700 is another carbonyl, like an ester or ketone.

So the compound could be something like phenyl acetate, which would have a benzene ring (C=C, 1450-1600 cm-1) but maybe with some conjugation shifting the peak. Or maybe it's an aromatic ester.

So considering this, the compound might have both a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.

Now, looking at the mass spec: m/z=45. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me calculate the possible ions.

45 could be:

- C3H7O? Wait, molecular weight of C3H7O is 3*12 +7*1 +16=36+7+16=59. No.

Wait, maybe COOCH3? Wait, COOCH3 is 12+16*2 +12+3*1= 12+32+15=59. Hmm, that's not 45.

Wait, another approach: possible fragments that sum to 45.

What's the possible combination of atoms that sum to 45? Let's think.

For example, C2H5O2: 24 +5 +32=59. Not 45.

C3H3O: 36 +3 +16=55. No.

Wait, maybe something else. The molecular ion could be breaking into a smaller part. For example, in an ester, the cleavage could occur between the carbonyl and oxygen, leading to a fragment like the acyloxy group or the R-O- part.

Wait, another idea: the fragment could be a CH3COO+ group. That's 45? Let me calculate: CH3COO is 12*2 +1*4 +16=24 +4 +16=44. No, not 45. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a CHO group plus something? CHO is 29, but 45-29=16. That's O, but I don't know.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: what common compounds have a fragment at m/z 45?

Looking up, I remember that the tropylium ion (C7H7+) has a m/z around 91, so that's not it. What about the propyl acetate? No, but maybe the fragment is an acetate group.

Wait, I think the fragment at 45 could come from a ketene (like CH2=C=O, which is 44) but that's close. Or perhaps it's a different structure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a (CH2O) group, which is formaldehyde, but that's 30. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the molecular ion could be losing a larger fragment. For example, if the compound is an ester like methyl benzoate, the molecular formula would be C8H8O2. But the options don't include that. So maybe it's a different ester with six carbons.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The molecular formulas:

A) C6H12O2: 6 carbons, 12 H, 2 O.

B) C6H10O: 6,10,1.

C) C6H10O2: 6,10,2.

D) C6H12O: 6,12,1.

So, which of these would have a fragment at 45?

Let me think about the possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. Maybe something like methyl cyclohexanoate. The structure could be O=C-O-R where R is cyclohexyl. But I'm not sure about the fragment.

Option C: C6H10O2. Maybe an ester with a double bond. For example, something like methyl vinyl benzoate? Or perhaps it's a diester? Or maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone.

Wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so that suggests a double bond. So perhaps the compound has an ester group and a double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

So, for example, something like methyl acrylate: CH2=CHCOOCH3. But that would be C4H6O2. Hmm, but the options are for C6.

Another example: perhaps it's a substituted acrylic ester, maybe with a benzene ring. Like phenyl acrylate, but that would be more carbons.

Wait, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, but with a double bond elsewhere. Hmm.

Alternatively, could the compound be a benzene ring with an ester substituent and a double bond? But I'm not sure.

Back to the mass spec: m/z=45. Maybe the fragment is a CH3COO group. Wait, that's 45? Let's calculate: CH3COO is (12*2)+(1*3)+(16*2)=24+3+32=59. No. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a (CH2)2O group, which is 48. Not 45. Hmmm.

Wait, maybe it's (CH3)CO, which is 59. No.

Wait, perhaps it's the loss of a larger fragment. For example, if the molecule is losing a (CH2CH2O) group, but that would be 58, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a carbonyl group with some hydrogens attached. Like COCH2CH2O, but not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the fragment is an acetylenic group, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, maybe it's the m/z of a ketone. For example, if one of the carbonyl groups is an aldehyde, then the aldehyde group is CHO, which is 30. But in mass spec, sometimes the fragment would be at 30, but here it's 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2CH2O group. Wait, that's ethylene oxide, which is 44, close but not 45.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on this. Let me think about each option and their possible fragments.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So maybe a ring or a double bond.

If the structure is an ester with a cyclohexane ring, like something like cyclohexyl acetate. The formula for cyclohexyl acetate is C8H12O2, which is more than our options. Hmm, so maybe a different structure.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like methyl cyclopentanoate, which would be C6H10O2. Wait, that's option C. But I need to think about each option.

Option C: C6H10O2. The degrees of unsaturation are 2. So maybe two rings, or one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

If it's an ester with a double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCO-O-R, but with R being something that brings the total to six carbons. Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a ring.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, a lactone. For example, gamma-butyrolactone would be a 5-membered ring, but that's only four carbons. Hmm.

Wait, another structure: perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester, like phenyl propionate. But that would be C9H10O2, which is more than six carbons.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted ester with a double bond. Let's say, for example, the ester is between a benzene ring and an acrylic acid. But again, that might not fit the formula.

Let me think about the NMR again. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond, perhaps in a trans or cis configuration. So, maybe the ester is part of a structure that includes a double bond.

Now, looking at the mass spec, perhaps the fragment comes from the ester group. For example, in an ester like R-O-CO-R', the cleavage could occur at the ester oxygen, leading to a fragment that includes the R-O-CO- part.

If the R is CH2CH2, perhaps the fragment would be (CH2CH2O-CO), which is C3H6O2. Wait, what is the molecular weight of that? C3H6O2: 3*12=36, 6*1=6, 2*16=32. Total 74. That's not 45.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the R' part. If the ester is, say, methyl something, then the ester would be O-CO-OCH3. The fragment could be the methyl group attached to the oxygen. But methyl is 15, which is way below 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion. A ketene has the structure R-C=C=O, but I'm not sure how that would fragment.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a propionyl group (CH2CH2CO), but that doesn't add up.

Wait, another approach: maybe the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C). Let's calculate the possible molecular weight. 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 2*16=32. Total 72+10=82+32=114 g/mol.

So the molecular ion would be at m/z 114. The fragment at 45 is about 40% of that, which could be a significant fragment. So, perhaps the compound breaks into a 45 fragment and another part.

What's 114 -45=69. So, a possible fragment would be 45 and 69?

Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, 45 is 45, so what's 45? Let me think about possible molecular formulas that sum to 45.

Possible combinations:

- C3H7O: 3*12 +7*1 +16=36+7+16=59. No.

- C3H3O2: 36 +3 +32=71. No.

- C4H5O: 48 +5 +16=69. No.

Wait, what about C2H5O2: 24 +5 +32=61. No.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3 group attached to something else. Or maybe a CH2=CHCOO+ group. Wait, CH2=CHCOO+ would have a molecular weight of (12*3)+(1*4)+(16*2)=36+4+32=72. No.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a (CH2)2O group, which is 48. Not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a (CO) group with some hydrogens. Wait, CO is 28. Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the fragment is not from the ester group but from elsewhere. For example, if the compound is a diester, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from a ketone group. For example, if the compound has a ketone, the fragment could be the carbonyl plus some hydrogens.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. This could be an ester, which would typically have the formula RCOOR'. So, for example, R could be a three-carbon group and R' a three-carbon group. Let's see: RCOOR' would be (3 carbons) + (3 carbons) + (O and O from ester) => total 6 carbons, which fits.

So, the ester would be, for example, propyl propionate (but that's 6 carbons, but would likely have a different structure). Alternatively, maybe it's methyl cyclopentanoate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So maybe the ester is part of a structure that includes a double bond. Like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that would be 5 carbons for R and R', but perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

Wait, the structure would be CH2=CHCO-O-R, where R has two carbons. Then, the formula would be:

CH2=CHCOO has 3 carbons, and R is, say, ethyl (2 carbons). So total 5, but our options are 6. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCO-O-CH2CH2CH3. That would be 3 (from CH2=CHCO) +3 (from CH2CH2CH3) =6 carbons. So the formula would be C6H10O2. Because:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3: That's 3 carbons (CH2=CHCO) + 3 (CH2CH2CH3) =6. The hydrogens: Let's count.

CH2=CHCOO: Each CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1 H (from double bond), COO has O's, no H. Then, the ethyl group: CH2CH2CH3 has 2 CH2 (each 2 H) and a CH3 (3 H). So adding up:

CH2=CHCOO: CH2 (2 H) + CH (1 H) + COO (O's, no H) → 3 H.

The ethyl group: CH2 (2) + CH2 (2) + CH3 (3) → 7 H.

Plus any from the ester oxygen? Wait, the ester groups don't add H. So total H is 3 +7=10.

Wait, but wait: the CH2=CHCOO group: The structure is CH2-CH2-COO-? No, it's CH2=CHCOO. So, CH2-CH2- is not correct. Let me think again.

The structure for CH2=CHCOOEt (ethyl ester) would be:

CH2=CHCO-O-CH2CH2CH3.

So, the molecule is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3.

The molecular formula would be:

CH2=CHCOO: C3, H4 (because CH2=CHCO has 3 H: CH2 has 2, CH has 1, COO no H).

Wait, wait, no. Let me count each part.

CH2=CHCOO: This is CH2-CH2-COO. No, that's not right. Wait, CH2=CHCOO is actually CH2=CH-C-O-O-? No, the structure is CH2=CH-C-O-O-R.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me write the structure properly.

The correct structure for an ester like methyl acrylate would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. So, the formula is C4H6O2.

Hmm, but our options are for C6. So, perhaps a longer chain.

If the ester is butyl something, then maybe it's longer.

But perhaps I'm complicating things. Let's go back to the options and the fragments.

The fragment at 45 could be a CH3COO group, but that's 59. Alternatively, maybe a smaller fragment.

Wait, another idea: the fragment is a CH2CH=CHCO group, but that's 64. Not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a COOCH2CH2 group. COOCH2CH2 would have a molecular weight of 60 (COO is 44, CH2CH2 is 28? Wait, COO is 44 (12+16*2), CH2CH2 is 24 (12*2 +1*4). So 44+24=68. No.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the other clues.

The IR shows a broad peak around 3000 cm-1, which is probably O-H stretch, so the compound has an -OH group. Wait, but the options with O and O2 could have that.

Wait, if the compound is an ester (which has an O but no OH), but the FTIR shows a broad peak, which is more like a hydroxyl (like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid). Hmm, that complicates things. Because esters don't have OH groups.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. If the FTIR shows a broad peak around 3000, that usually indicates O-H stretch. Esters don't have O-H; they have O-O-C-O, but those are usually around 1700. So if the compound has an O-H, that suggests either a carboxylic acid, an alcohol, or perhaps a phenol.

But in the options, the O count is either 1 or 2.

So, for a carboxylic acid, the formula would be CnH2nO2. For example, hexanoic acid is C6H12O2, which is option A.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. Hexanoic acid doesn't have a double bond. So that can't be.

If the compound is an alcohol with a double bond and a carbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the compound could be a phenol with a substituent. But phenol's O-H would be very broad, which fits the IR. But the options don't have a phenol structure, unless it's something like a substituted phenol with an ester group.

Wait, but the molecular formulas don't match benzene rings. For example, a phenol would have a benzene ring (three degrees of unsaturation), but the options have either one or two.

Let me re-calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each option:

Option A: C6H12O2.
Degrees of Unsat: (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1.

So one double bond or ring.

But if the IR shows a broad O-H (like a carboxylic acid or alcohol), and a carbonyl, that would require two degrees (O-H is not a double bond, just a single bond with O). Wait, but O-H is a single bond, so it doesn't count towards degrees of unsaturation. So the carbonyl (C=O) is one degree, and the O-H doesn't add to it. So perhaps the structure has a carbonyl group and something else.

Wait, but in option A, the degrees of unsaturation is one. So the compound would have one double bond or one ring, but not both.

But earlier, the IR suggested a carbonyl (double bond) and a O-H, which is another group. So, for a carboxylic acid, the formula would fit option A (C6H12O2), but would that structure have a double bond? No, because that would require an additional degree of unsaturation. So perhaps it's not a carboxylic acid.

Hmm. Maybe the O-H is from an alcohol group, and the carbonyl is from an ester. So the structure would have both an alcohol and an ester group. But that would require more oxygens than some of the options allow.

Wait, let's think about the structure as an ester and an alcohol. For example, a molecule with both an ester group (RCOOR') and an alcohol group (R''OH). But that would have two O's from ester and another O from the alcohol, making O3, which isn't in any of the options. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, the compound might be a glycol ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the O-H is from a phenol group. So, a phenol with an ester substituent. For example, methyl salicylate. But methyl salicylate is C8H8O3, which doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester with an O-H, but I'm not sure.

Another possibility: the broad peak is not from O-H but from amines. But the options don't have N, so that's probably not it.

Wait, going back to the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C: C6H10O2.

Because, for that formula, the degrees of unsaturation would be (14-10)/2=2. So two double bonds or rings. So, perhaps a benzene ring (three double bonds, but that would be too much) or one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

Wait, but a benzene ring has three double bonds, which would require three degrees. So that can't be unless the compound has a benzene ring plus another double bond, which would require more than two degrees. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a double bond. So, the structure is RCOOR', where R has a double bond.

So, for option C: C6H10O2. Let's see.

If R is CH2CH2CH2- with a double bond, like CH2=CHCH2-, then RCOOR' would be (CH2=CHCH2COO)R'.

But perhaps a better way is to think of the structure as having both a carbonyl group and a double bond elsewhere.

In that case, the degrees of unsaturation would account for both the carbonyl and the double bond.

So, in that case, the IR would show both the carbonyl (around 1700) and the C=C (maybe around 1650). That fits the IR data.

Then, the NMR would show vinyl hydrogens (from the double bond), which also fits.

Mass spec: the fragment at 45 could correspond to a fragment that includes the carbonyl group. For example, if the molecule breaks after the carbonyl, the fragment could be the acyl part, like O=C-O-R', which could lose some parts.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion, which is O=C=O, but that's 64.

Wait, another thought: the fragment could be a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. Like CH3CO, which is 44. Close to 45, but not exactly. Maybe a different fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the ester group itself. For example, RCOO- would have a molecular weight of RCOO. If R is CH2CH2, then RCOO would be (12*3 + 1*4 +16*2) =36+4+32=72. Hmm, no. That's not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH3CH2O group. That's 45? CH3CH2O is 12*2 +1*5 +16=24+5+16=45. Oh! Wait, that's exactly 45.

So, the fragment at m/z=45 could be CH2CH2O+ (although I think it's actually (CH2CH2O)+ which is 45. So, the molecular ion breaks into a CH2CH2O group and another part.

Which of the options would allow that fragment?

Looking back, option C is C6H10O2. Let's consider the structure as an ester with an ethyl group.

For example, the structure could be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. The molecular formula of this would be C5H8O2. Wait, that's not 6 carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, let's count the carbons.

CH2CH2COO is 3 carbons, and CH2CH2CH3 is 3, so total 6. The formula would be C6H10O2, which matches option C.

So, the structure is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, CH2CH2COO is CH2CH2-COO. No, the correct structure would be CH2CH2COO-R, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like methyl cyclopropane carboxylate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the key point is that the fragment at 45 is CH2CH2O+. So, if the molecule has an ethyl group attached to oxygen (like OCH2CH3), then during fragmentation, the molecule could lose the rest and leave the OCH2CH3 group as a fragment at 45.

So, if the structure is R-O-O-CO-R', but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the structure could be an ester with an ethyl group. Like, for example, ethyl acrylic ester. So, the ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. Let's calculate the formula: CH2=CHCOO (3 carbons) + OCH2CH3 (2 carbons) → total 5 carbons. That's not 6.

Hmm. So maybe the structure is longer.

Another possibility: the ester is methyl pentanoate. But that wouldn't have a double bond.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so the compound must have a double bond.

So, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, which is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That would be 3 carbons (CH2=CHCOO) + 3 carbons (CH2CH2CH3) → 6 carbons. The formula would be C6H10O2, which matches option C.

So, the structure would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Now, the molecular weight is:

CH2=CHCOO is 3 carbons, each CH2 is 12+2=14, CH is 12+1=13, COO is 12+32=44. Wait, maybe I should calculate the molecular weight properly.

Wait, the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Molecular weight is 6*12=72 +10*1=10 + 2*16=32 → 72+10=82+32=114.

In the mass spectrum, the molecular ion would be at m/z 114. The fragment at 45 is a significant fragment.

If the molecule breaks between the ester oxygen and the ethyl group, the ethyl group (CH2CH2CH3) would have a molecular weight of 58 (for CH2CH2CH3: (12*3)+(1*7)=36+7=43? Wait, no. Wait, CH2CH2CH3 is C3H7, which is 3*12 +7*1=36+7=43. So the fragment would be 43, but the observed is 45. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, but I thought the fragment was OCH2CH2CH3, which would be (16)+(12*2)+(1*5)=16+24+5=45. Oh! Wait, OCH2CH2CH3: that's 16 (O) + 24 (2*12) + 5 (5 H?) Wait, wait, the formula would be OCH2CH2CH3, which is C3H7O. The molecular weight is 3*12 +7*1 +16=36+7+16=59. Hmm, that's not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is OCH2CH3 (45?), which is 16 + 2*12 +3*1=16+24+3=43. Not 45.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to tie everything together.

The IR shows a broad O-H (probably an alcohol or carboxylic acid), but the presence of a carbonyl (ester, ketone, etc.) at 1700. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. The mass spec has a fragment at 45.

Looking at the options, the correct formula must have O's that allow for the IR, a double bond (from NMR), and a fragment at 45.

Option C is C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation 2. So, one could be a carbonyl (ester or ketone), and the other a double bond.

If the structure is an ester with a double bond (like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester), then the IR would show the carbonyl at ~1700 and the C=C at ~1650. The NMR would have vinyl H's.

In this case, the molecular formula would be C6H10O2, which fits option C. The mass spec fragment at 45 could come from a smaller fragment, perhaps a CH2CH2O group (which is 45). So, if the ester group is OCH2CH2CH3, but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, the fragment could be from the ester's acyl group, but I'm not certain.

Putting it all together, I think the correct answer is option C) C6H10O2.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The unknown compound is characterized using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H group, and strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹, suggesting the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated double bond (C=C). The ¹H NMR spectrum indicates the presence of vinyl hydrogens, confirming the presence of a double bond. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, which is a key clue for identifying the compound.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: C₆H₁₂O₂**
   - Degrees of unsaturation: \( \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 12)}{2} = 1 \).
   - This formula allows for either one double bond or one ring. However, the IR data suggests the presence of both a carbonyl group and a double bond, requiring at least two degrees of unsaturation. Thus, this option is inconsistent with the data.

2. **Option B: C₆H₁₀O**
   - Degrees of unsaturation: \( \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 10)}{2} = 2 \).
   - This formula allows for two degrees of unsaturation, such as a carbonyl group and a double bond. However, the IR spectrum shows two strong peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹, which are consistent with a carbonyl and a conjugated system. The presence of O-H and the fragment at m/z = 45 also needs to be considered. This option does not fully align with the data.

3. **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**
   - Degrees of unsaturation: \( \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 10)}{2} = 2 \).
   - This formula allows for two degrees of unsaturation, which can correspond to a carbonyl group (C=O) and a double bond (C=C). The IR data matches this structure, as the peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ are consistent with a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond. The NMR data also supports the presence of vinyl hydrogens. The fragment at m/z = 45 can correspond to a CH₃CH₂O group, which is plausible for this formula. This option aligns well with all the data.

4. **Option D: C₆H₁₂O**
   - Degrees of unsaturation: \( \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 12)}{2} = 1 \).
   - Similar to Option A, this formula allows for only one degree of unsaturation, which is insufficient to explain the IR data showing both a carbonyl and a double bond. Thus, this option is inconsistent with the data.

### Conclusion:
The compound must have a molecular formula of **C₆H₁₀O₂** to satisfy the IR, NMR, and mass spectrometry data. The IR peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ correspond to a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond, respectively. The NMR data confirms the presence of vinyl hydrogens, and the fragment at m/z = 45 is consistent with a CH₃CH₂O group. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this question about identifying an unknown compound using various spectroscopy techniques. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says the compound was characterized with FTIR, 1H NMR, and Mass Spec. The FTIR shows a very broad peak around 3000 cm-1, which usually indicates O-H stretching, like in alcohols or maybe carboxylic acids. Oh wait, but a broad peak could also be from an amine, but I don't think that's relevant here since the options don't include nitrogen. So, maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid.

Then, there are strong absorption peaks at 1700 and 1650 cm-1. I remember that carbonyl groups (like in ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc.) absorb around 1700. The 1650 might be something else. Maybe an aromatic ring? Like C=C stretching? Or maybe a conjugated carbonyl, like an ester or something with conjugation. Alternatively, the 1650 could be an amide, but again, no N here.

Wait, if the 1700 is a carbonyl, maybe the 1650 is an aromatic C=C stretch. So the compound might have both a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring. Or perhaps another carbonyl group? Like maybe an ester has two carbonyls? Wait, no, esters have one carbonyl. Hmm.

Looking at the 1H NMR: there are peaks for vinyl hydrogens. Vinyl means double bond, so the compound has a double bond, probably in an alkene or maybe an aromatic ring. Wait, aromatic rings would give more complex splitting, but vinyl could refer to an isolated double bond elsewhere.

Mass spec shows a fragment peak at m/z=45. That's a key point. I need to think about what fragments have a mass of 45. Common fragments include CH3COOH (45?), or something like CHO, but let me check. Wait, the molecular ion might break into smaller fragments. For example, the fragment could be a CH2O group (formaldehyde is 30, but maybe something else). Alternatively, 45 could be (CH3)2O if that's a fragment, but I'm not sure.

Now, looking at the options:

A) C6H12O2
B) C6H10O
C) C6H10O2
D) C6H12O

The molecular formulas all have six carbons. Let me calculate their degrees of unsaturation to see possible structures.

Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Since no X or N, it's (2*6 +2 - H - 0)/2.

For option A: C6H12O2. H=12.
(2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2 = 1. So 1 degree: could be a ring or double bond. But wait, O doesn't affect the degree of unsaturation. So 1. Hmm.

Option B: C6H10O. H=10.
(14 -10)/2 = 2. So two degrees. Could be two rings, a ring plus a double bond, etc.

Option C: C6H10O2. H=10.
(14-10)/2=2. Two degrees.

Option D: C6H12O. H=12.
Same as A: (14-12)/2=1.

Wait, but I thought the IR had a carbonyl (which is a double bond, so that's a degree) and a broad peak for O-H. So if there's a carbonyl and an O-H, that uses up two degrees. Let me check each option's degrees.

Wait, maybe I should think about the IR again. The broad peak is probably O-H, so that's one group. The peaks at 1700 and 1650. Let me think: a carbonyl group (like ester, ketone, etc.) is at 1700. The 1650 could be conjugated double bonds. For example, in an ester group, the carbonyl is around 1700, and maybe an aromatic ring's C=C would be around 1600-1650. But wait, the 1650 is a bit high for a regular aromatic C=C. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl like in an alpha, beta-unsaturated ester. That would cause the carbonyl peak to be lower? Wait, no, maybe higher. Or perhaps it's an amide, but no N here.

Wait, maybe the 1650 is from a C=O in a conjugated system. Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl oxygen with some conjugation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 1650 is from an aromatic ring (so benzene ring) and the 1700 is another carbonyl, like an ester or ketone.

So the compound could be something like phenyl acetate, which would have a benzene ring (C=C, 1450-1600 cm-1) but maybe with some conjugation shifting the peak. Or maybe it's an aromatic ester.

So considering this, the compound might have both a benzene ring and a carbonyl group.

Now, looking at the mass spec: m/z=45. Let's think about possible fragments. 45 is 45 g/mol. Let me calculate the possible ions.

45 could be:

- C3H7O? Wait, molecular weight of C3H7O is 3*12 +7*1 +16=36+7+16=59. No.

Wait, maybe COOCH3? Wait, COOCH3 is 12+16*2 +12+3*1= 12+32+15=59. Hmm, that's not 45.

Wait, another approach: possible fragments that sum to 45.

What's the possible combination of atoms that sum to 45? Let's think.

For example, C2H5O2: 24 +5 +32=59. Not 45.

C3H3O: 36 +3 +16=55. No.

Wait, maybe something else. The molecular ion could be breaking into a smaller part. For example, in an ester, the cleavage could occur between the carbonyl and oxygen, leading to a fragment like the acyloxy group or the R-O- part.

Wait, another idea: the fragment could be a CH3COO+ group. That's 45? Let me calculate: CH3COO is 12*2 +1*4 +16=24 +4 +16=44. No, not 45. Hmm.

Wait, maybe it's a CHO group plus something? CHO is 29, but 45-29=16. That's O, but I don't know.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a ketene ion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: what common compounds have a fragment at m/z 45?

Looking up, I remember that the tropylium ion (C7H7+) has a m/z around 91, so that's not it. What about the propyl acetate? No, but maybe the fragment is an acetate group.

Wait, I think the fragment at 45 could come from a ketene (like CH2=C=O, which is 44) but that's close. Or perhaps it's a different structure.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a (CH2O) group, which is formaldehyde, but that's 30. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the molecular ion could be losing a larger fragment. For example, if the compound is an ester like methyl benzoate, the molecular formula would be C8H8O2. But the options don't include that. So maybe it's a different ester with six carbons.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The molecular formulas:

A) C6H12O2: 6 carbons, 12 H, 2 O.

B) C6H10O: 6,10,1.

C) C6H10O2: 6,10,2.

D) C6H12O: 6,12,1.

So, which of these would have a fragment at 45?

Let me think about the possible structures.

Option A: C6H12O2. Maybe something like methyl cyclohexanoate. The structure could be O=C-O-R where R is cyclohexyl. But I'm not sure about the fragment.

Option C: C6H10O2. Maybe an ester with a double bond. For example, something like methyl vinyl benzoate? Or perhaps it's a diester? Or maybe it's a cyclic ester, like a lactone.

Wait, the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, so that suggests a double bond. So perhaps the compound has an ester group and a double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

So, for example, something like methyl acrylate: CH2=CHCOOCH3. But that would be C4H6O2. Hmm, but the options are for C6.

Another example: perhaps it's a substituted acrylic ester, maybe with a benzene ring. Like phenyl acrylate, but that would be more carbons.

Wait, maybe the compound is a cyclic ester, but with a double bond elsewhere. Hmm.

Alternatively, could the compound be a benzene ring with an ester substituent and a double bond? But I'm not sure.

Back to the mass spec: m/z=45. Maybe the fragment is a CH3COO group. Wait, that's 45? Let's calculate: CH3COO is (12*2)+(1*3)+(16*2)=24+3+32=59. No. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: the fragment could be a (CH2)2O group, which is 48. Not 45. Hmmm.

Wait, maybe it's (CH3)CO, which is 59. No.

Wait, perhaps it's the loss of a larger fragment. For example, if the molecule is losing a (CH2CH2O) group, but that would be 58, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a carbonyl group with some hydrogens attached. Like COCH2CH2O, but not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the fragment is an acetylenic group, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, maybe it's the m/z of a ketone. For example, if one of the carbonyl groups is an aldehyde, then the aldehyde group is CHO, which is 30. But in mass spec, sometimes the fragment would be at 30, but here it's 45.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a CH2CH2O group. Wait, that's ethylene oxide, which is 44, close but not 45.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on this. Let me think about each option and their possible fragments.

Option A: C6H12O2. Degrees of unsaturation: 1. So maybe a ring or a double bond.

If the structure is an ester with a cyclohexane ring, like something like cyclohexyl acetate. The formula for cyclohexyl acetate is C8H12O2, which is more than our options. Hmm, so maybe a different structure.

Wait, maybe the structure is something like methyl cyclopentanoate, which would be C6H10O2. Wait, that's option C. But I need to think about each option.

Option C: C6H10O2. The degrees of unsaturation are 2. So maybe two rings, or one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

If it's an ester with a double bond, like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester. For example, something like CH2=CHCO-O-R, but with R being something that brings the total to six carbons. Alternatively, maybe the ester is part of a ring.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester, a lactone. For example, gamma-butyrolactone would be a 5-membered ring, but that's only four carbons. Hmm.

Wait, another structure: perhaps the compound is an aromatic ester, like phenyl propionate. But that would be C9H10O2, which is more than six carbons.

Alternatively, maybe it's a substituted ester with a double bond. Let's say, for example, the ester is between a benzene ring and an acrylic acid. But again, that might not fit the formula.

Let me think about the NMR again. The presence of vinyl hydrogens suggests a double bond, perhaps in a trans or cis configuration. So, maybe the ester is part of a structure that includes a double bond.

Now, looking at the mass spec, perhaps the fragment comes from the ester group. For example, in an ester like R-O-CO-R', the cleavage could occur at the ester oxygen, leading to a fragment that includes the R-O-CO- part.

If the R is CH2CH2, perhaps the fragment would be (CH2CH2O-CO), which is C3H6O2. Wait, what is the molecular weight of that? C3H6O2: 3*12=36, 6*1=6, 2*16=32. Total 74. That's not 45.

Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is from the R' part. If the ester is, say, methyl something, then the ester would be O-CO-OCH3. The fragment could be the methyl group attached to the oxygen. But methyl is 15, which is way below 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion. A ketene has the structure R-C=C=O, but I'm not sure how that would fragment.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a propionyl group (CH2CH2CO), but that doesn't add up.

Wait, another approach: maybe the molecular formula is C6H10O2 (option C). Let's calculate the possible molecular weight. 6*12=72, 10*1=10, 2*16=32. Total 72+10=82+32=114 g/mol.

So the molecular ion would be at m/z 114. The fragment at 45 is about 40% of that, which could be a significant fragment. So, perhaps the compound breaks into a 45 fragment and another part.

What's 114 -45=69. So, a possible fragment would be 45 and 69?

Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, 45 is 45, so what's 45? Let me think about possible molecular formulas that sum to 45.

Possible combinations:

- C3H7O: 3*12 +7*1 +16=36+7+16=59. No.

- C3H3O2: 36 +3 +32=71. No.

- C4H5O: 48 +5 +16=69. No.

Wait, what about C2H5O2: 24 +5 +32=61. No.

Alternatively, maybe it's a CH3 group attached to something else. Or maybe a CH2=CHCOO+ group. Wait, CH2=CHCOO+ would have a molecular weight of (12*3)+(1*4)+(16*2)=36+4+32=72. No.

Wait, maybe the fragment is a (CH2)2O group, which is 48. Not 45.

Alternatively, maybe the fragment is a (CO) group with some hydrogens. Wait, CO is 28. Doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the fragment is not from the ester group but from elsewhere. For example, if the compound is a diester, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment comes from a ketone group. For example, if the compound has a ketone, the fragment could be the carbonyl plus some hydrogens.

Wait, another thought: the molecular formula for option C is C6H10O2. This could be an ester, which would typically have the formula RCOOR'. So, for example, R could be a three-carbon group and R' a three-carbon group. Let's see: RCOOR' would be (3 carbons) + (3 carbons) + (O and O from ester) => total 6 carbons, which fits.

So, the ester would be, for example, propyl propionate (but that's 6 carbons, but would likely have a different structure). Alternatively, maybe it's methyl cyclopentanoate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the NMR has vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. So maybe the ester is part of a structure that includes a double bond. Like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester.

For example, something like CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, that would be 5 carbons for R and R', but perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong.

Wait, the structure would be CH2=CHCO-O-R, where R has two carbons. Then, the formula would be:

CH2=CHCOO has 3 carbons, and R is, say, ethyl (2 carbons). So total 5, but our options are 6. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCO-O-CH2CH2CH3. That would be 3 (from CH2=CHCO) +3 (from CH2CH2CH3) =6 carbons. So the formula would be C6H10O2. Because:

CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3: That's 3 carbons (CH2=CHCO) + 3 (CH2CH2CH3) =6. The hydrogens: Let's count.

CH2=CHCOO: Each CH2 has 2 H, CH has 1 H (from double bond), COO has O's, no H. Then, the ethyl group: CH2CH2CH3 has 2 CH2 (each 2 H) and a CH3 (3 H). So adding up:

CH2=CHCOO: CH2 (2 H) + CH (1 H) + COO (O's, no H) → 3 H.

The ethyl group: CH2 (2) + CH2 (2) + CH3 (3) → 7 H.

Plus any from the ester oxygen? Wait, the ester groups don't add H. So total H is 3 +7=10.

Wait, but wait: the CH2=CHCOO group: The structure is CH2-CH2-COO-? No, it's CH2=CHCOO. So, CH2-CH2- is not correct. Let me think again.

The structure for CH2=CHCOOEt (ethyl ester) would be:

CH2=CHCO-O-CH2CH2CH3.

So, the molecule is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3.

The molecular formula would be:

CH2=CHCOO: C3, H4 (because CH2=CHCO has 3 H: CH2 has 2, CH has 1, COO no H).

Wait, wait, no. Let me count each part.

CH2=CHCOO: This is CH2-CH2-COO. No, that's not right. Wait, CH2=CHCOO is actually CH2=CH-C-O-O-? No, the structure is CH2=CH-C-O-O-R.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me write the structure properly.

The correct structure for an ester like methyl acrylate would be CH2=CHCOOCH3. So, the formula is C4H6O2.

Hmm, but our options are for C6. So, perhaps a longer chain.

If the ester is butyl something, then maybe it's longer.

But perhaps I'm complicating things. Let's go back to the options and the fragments.

The fragment at 45 could be a CH3COO group, but that's 59. Alternatively, maybe a smaller fragment.

Wait, another idea: the fragment is a CH2CH=CHCO group, but that's 64. Not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a COOCH2CH2 group. COOCH2CH2 would have a molecular weight of 60 (COO is 44, CH2CH2 is 28? Wait, COO is 44 (12+16*2), CH2CH2 is 24 (12*2 +1*4). So 44+24=68. No.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the other clues.

The IR shows a broad peak around 3000 cm-1, which is probably O-H stretch, so the compound has an -OH group. Wait, but the options with O and O2 could have that.

Wait, if the compound is an ester (which has an O but no OH), but the FTIR shows a broad peak, which is more like a hydroxyl (like an alcohol or a carboxylic acid). Hmm, that complicates things. Because esters don't have OH groups.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. If the FTIR shows a broad peak around 3000, that usually indicates O-H stretch. Esters don't have O-H; they have O-O-C-O, but those are usually around 1700. So if the compound has an O-H, that suggests either a carboxylic acid, an alcohol, or perhaps a phenol.

But in the options, the O count is either 1 or 2.

So, for a carboxylic acid, the formula would be CnH2nO2. For example, hexanoic acid is C6H12O2, which is option A.

But wait, the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, which suggests a double bond. Hexanoic acid doesn't have a double bond. So that can't be.

If the compound is an alcohol with a double bond and a carbonyl group, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the compound could be a phenol with a substituent. But phenol's O-H would be very broad, which fits the IR. But the options don't have a phenol structure, unless it's something like a substituted phenol with an ester group.

Wait, but the molecular formulas don't match benzene rings. For example, a phenol would have a benzene ring (three degrees of unsaturation), but the options have either one or two.

Let me re-calculate the degrees of unsaturation for each option:

Option A: C6H12O2.
Degrees of Unsat: (2*6 +2 -12)/2 = (14-12)/2=1.

So one double bond or ring.

But if the IR shows a broad O-H (like a carboxylic acid or alcohol), and a carbonyl, that would require two degrees (O-H is not a double bond, just a single bond with O). Wait, but O-H is a single bond, so it doesn't count towards degrees of unsaturation. So the carbonyl (C=O) is one degree, and the O-H doesn't add to it. So perhaps the structure has a carbonyl group and something else.

Wait, but in option A, the degrees of unsaturation is one. So the compound would have one double bond or one ring, but not both.

But earlier, the IR suggested a carbonyl (double bond) and a O-H, which is another group. So, for a carboxylic acid, the formula would fit option A (C6H12O2), but would that structure have a double bond? No, because that would require an additional degree of unsaturation. So perhaps it's not a carboxylic acid.

Hmm. Maybe the O-H is from an alcohol group, and the carbonyl is from an ester. So the structure would have both an alcohol and an ester group. But that would require more oxygens than some of the options allow.

Wait, let's think about the structure as an ester and an alcohol. For example, a molecule with both an ester group (RCOOR') and an alcohol group (R''OH). But that would have two O's from ester and another O from the alcohol, making O3, which isn't in any of the options. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, the compound might be a glycol ester, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the O-H is from a phenol group. So, a phenol with an ester substituent. For example, methyl salicylate. But methyl salicylate is C8H8O3, which doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, maybe it's a cyclic ester with an O-H, but I'm not sure.

Another possibility: the broad peak is not from O-H but from amines. But the options don't have N, so that's probably not it.

Wait, going back to the options, perhaps the correct answer is option C: C6H10O2.

Because, for that formula, the degrees of unsaturation would be (14-10)/2=2. So two double bonds or rings. So, perhaps a benzene ring (three double bonds, but that would be too much) or one ring and one double bond, or two double bonds.

Wait, but a benzene ring has three double bonds, which would require three degrees. So that can't be unless the compound has a benzene ring plus another double bond, which would require more than two degrees. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an ester with a double bond. So, the structure is RCOOR', where R has a double bond.

So, for option C: C6H10O2. Let's see.

If R is CH2CH2CH2- with a double bond, like CH2=CHCH2-, then RCOOR' would be (CH2=CHCH2COO)R'.

But perhaps a better way is to think of the structure as having both a carbonyl group and a double bond elsewhere.

In that case, the degrees of unsaturation would account for both the carbonyl and the double bond.

So, in that case, the IR would show both the carbonyl (around 1700) and the C=C (maybe around 1650). That fits the IR data.

Then, the NMR would show vinyl hydrogens (from the double bond), which also fits.

Mass spec: the fragment at 45 could correspond to a fragment that includes the carbonyl group. For example, if the molecule breaks after the carbonyl, the fragment could be the acyl part, like O=C-O-R', which could lose some parts.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is a ketene ion, which is O=C=O, but that's 64.

Wait, another thought: the fragment could be a methyl group attached to a carbonyl. Like CH3CO, which is 44. Close to 45, but not exactly. Maybe a different fragment.

Alternatively, perhaps the fragment is the ester group itself. For example, RCOO- would have a molecular weight of RCOO. If R is CH2CH2, then RCOO would be (12*3 + 1*4 +16*2) =36+4+32=72. Hmm, no. That's not 45.

Wait, perhaps the fragment is a CH3CH2O group. That's 45? CH3CH2O is 12*2 +1*5 +16=24+5+16=45. Oh! Wait, that's exactly 45.

So, the fragment at m/z=45 could be CH2CH2O+ (although I think it's actually (CH2CH2O)+ which is 45. So, the molecular ion breaks into a CH2CH2O group and another part.

Which of the options would allow that fragment?

Looking back, option C is C6H10O2. Let's consider the structure as an ester with an ethyl group.

For example, the structure could be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. The molecular formula of this would be C5H8O2. Wait, that's not 6 carbons. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, let's count the carbons.

CH2CH2COO is 3 carbons, and CH2CH2CH3 is 3, so total 6. The formula would be C6H10O2, which matches option C.

So, the structure is CH2CH2COOCH2CH2CH3. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, CH2CH2COO is CH2CH2-COO. No, the correct structure would be CH2CH2COO-R, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is something like methyl cyclopropane carboxylate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the key point is that the fragment at 45 is CH2CH2O+. So, if the molecule has an ethyl group attached to oxygen (like OCH2CH3), then during fragmentation, the molecule could lose the rest and leave the OCH2CH3 group as a fragment at 45.

So, if the structure is R-O-O-CO-R', but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the structure could be an ester with an ethyl group. Like, for example, ethyl acrylic ester. So, the ester would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH3. Let's calculate the formula: CH2=CHCOO (3 carbons) + OCH2CH3 (2 carbons) → total 5 carbons. That's not 6.

Hmm. So maybe the structure is longer.

Another possibility: the ester is methyl pentanoate. But that wouldn't have a double bond.

Wait, but the NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so the compound must have a double bond.

So, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3, which is CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. That would be 3 carbons (CH2=CHCOO) + 3 carbons (CH2CH2CH3) → 6 carbons. The formula would be C6H10O2, which matches option C.

So, the structure would be CH2=CHCOOCH2CH2CH3. Now, the molecular weight is:

CH2=CHCOO is 3 carbons, each CH2 is 12+2=14, CH is 12+1=13, COO is 12+32=44. Wait, maybe I should calculate the molecular weight properly.

Wait, the molecular formula is C6H10O2. Molecular weight is 6*12=72 +10*1=10 + 2*16=32 → 72+10=82+32=114.

In the mass spectrum, the molecular ion would be at m/z 114. The fragment at 45 is a significant fragment.

If the molecule breaks between the ester oxygen and the ethyl group, the ethyl group (CH2CH2CH3) would have a molecular weight of 58 (for CH2CH2CH3: (12*3)+(1*7)=36+7=43? Wait, no. Wait, CH2CH2CH3 is C3H7, which is 3*12 +7*1=36+7=43. So the fragment would be 43, but the observed is 45. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, but I thought the fragment was OCH2CH2CH3, which would be (16)+(12*2)+(1*5)=16+24+5=45. Oh! Wait, OCH2CH2CH3: that's 16 (O) + 24 (2*12) + 5 (5 H?) Wait, wait, the formula would be OCH2CH2CH3, which is C3H7O. The molecular weight is 3*12 +7*1 +16=36+7+16=59. Hmm, that's not 45.

Wait, maybe the fragment is OCH2CH3 (45?), which is 16 + 2*12 +3*1=16+24+3=43. Not 45.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to tie everything together.

The IR shows a broad O-H (probably an alcohol or carboxylic acid), but the presence of a carbonyl (ester, ketone, etc.) at 1700. The NMR shows vinyl hydrogens, so a double bond is present. The mass spec has a fragment at 45.

Looking at the options, the correct formula must have O's that allow for the IR, a double bond (from NMR), and a fragment at 45.

Option C is C6H10O2. Degrees of unsaturation 2. So, one could be a carbonyl (ester or ketone), and the other a double bond.

If the structure is an ester with a double bond (like an alpha,beta-unsaturated ester), then the IR would show the carbonyl at ~1700 and the C=C at ~1650. The NMR would have vinyl H's.

In this case, the molecular formula would be C6H10O2, which fits option C. The mass spec fragment at 45 could come from a smaller fragment, perhaps a CH2CH2O group (which is 45). So, if the ester group is OCH2CH2CH3, but I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, the fragment could be from the ester's acyl group, but I'm not certain.

Putting it all together, I think the correct answer is option C) C6H10O2.


The unknown compound is characterized using FTIR, ¹H NMR, and mass spectrometry. The FTIR spectrum shows a broad absorption peak at 3000 cm⁻¹, indicative of an O-H group, and strong absorption peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹, suggesting the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and possibly a conjugated double bond (C=C). The ¹H NMR spectrum indicates the presence of vinyl hydrogens, confirming the presence of a double bond. The mass spectrum shows a fragment peak at m/z = 45, which is a key clue for identifying the compound.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: C₆H₁₂O₂**
   - Degrees of unsaturation: \( \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 12)}{2} = 1 \).
   - This formula allows for either one double bond or one ring. However, the IR data suggests the presence of both a carbonyl group and a double bond, requiring at least two degrees of unsaturation. Thus, this option is inconsistent with the data.

2. **Option B: C₆H₁₀O**
   - Degrees of unsaturation: \( \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 10)}{2} = 2 \).
   - This formula allows for two degrees of unsaturation, such as a carbonyl group and a double bond. However, the IR spectrum shows two strong peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹, which are consistent with a carbonyl and a conjugated system. The presence of O-H and the fragment at m/z = 45 also needs to be considered. This option does not fully align with the data.

3. **Option C: C₆H₁₀O₂**
   - Degrees of unsaturation: \( \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 10)}{2} = 2 \).
   - This formula allows for two degrees of unsaturation, which can correspond to a carbonyl group (C=O) and a double bond (C=C). The IR data matches this structure, as the peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ are consistent with a carbonyl and a conjugated double bond. The NMR data also supports the presence of vinyl hydrogens. The fragment at m/z = 45 can correspond to a CH₃CH₂O group, which is plausible for this formula. This option aligns well with all the data.

4. **Option D: C₆H₁₂O**
   - Degrees of unsaturation: \( \frac{(2 \times 6 + 2 - 12)}{2} = 1 \).
   - Similar to Option A, this formula allows for only one degree of unsaturation, which is insufficient to explain the IR data showing both a carbonyl and a double bond. Thus, this option is inconsistent with the data.

### Conclusion:
The compound must have a molecular formula of **C₆H₁₀O₂** to satisfy the IR, NMR, and mass spectrometry data. The IR peaks at 1700 cm⁻¹ and 1650 cm⁻¹ correspond to a carbonyl group and a conjugated double bond, respectively. The NMR data confirms the presence of vinyl hydrogens, and the fragment at m/z = 45 is consistent with a CH₃CH₂O group. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
