Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem. Let me think through it step by step. 

The setup is about an uncharged spherical conductor with a small cavity inside. The conductor has a radius R, and the cavity has a radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance s. Now, someone places a small positive charge +q inside the cavity. The question is about finding the electric field E at a point P outside the conductor. 

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the cavity's center is l. Also, l and L are both greater than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta. 

Hmm. I remember that conductors have some interesting properties when it comes to electric fields and charges. Since the conductor was initially uncharged, any charges placed inside the cavity will redistribute the charges on the conductor. 

Wait, when you put a charge inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's inner surface will get an induced charge opposite to it, and the outer surface will have a charge equal to the original charge, but only if the conductor was initially neutral. Oh wait, no, correction: If the conductor is uncharged, placing a charge inside the cavity will induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface. Then, the outer surface must have a charge equal to the original charge because the overall conductor's charge is zero. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. 

The conductor is initially neutral. When you put +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor (the cavity's walls) must have -q induced because the charge inside the cavity attracts the opposite charges. Since the conductor itself was neutral, the outer surface must then have +q, because the total charge on the conductor is the sum of inner and outer surface charges. Wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, the conductor is neutral, so the total charge on it is zero. So the inner surface has -q, so the outer surface must have +q to balance it out. Because conductor's total charge is inner + outer = (-q) + (+q) = 0. Oh wait, no. Wait, the conductor's initial charge is zero. When you add +q inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor must have -q (because the conductor is a conductor, charges move freely; the +q in the cavity attracts negative charges to the inner surface). Since the conductor itself was neutral, the outer surface must have +q so that the total charge on the conductor is zero (because the +q in the cavity is enclosed, but the conductor's total charge remains zero. So the outer surface has +q.

Wait, no, the conductor's total charge is the sum of the inner and outer surfaces. The inner surface is -q, so the outer must be +q to make the total charge zero. Because the conductor as a whole is neutral, the sum of its own charges (inner and outer) must be zero. So, outer is +q.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P would be due to the charges on the outer surface of the conductor. Because the fields from the inner charges (the induced -q on the inner surface and +q on the outer) would behave as if all the charge is at the center, but wait, that's for a conductor with charge on the outside.

Wait, for a spherical conductor, if you have a charge on the outer surface, the electric field outside is the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center. So the E field outside depends only on the total charge of the conductor, which is +q in this case.

Wait, but wait a second. The conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q, so the electric field outside is as if that +q were at the center. So the electric field at point P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), because L is the distance from the center of the conductor to point P.

Wait, but let me think more carefully. Because the conductor's outer surface is carrying +q, so the field outside is the same as a point charge q at the center. So the position of the charge inside the cavity, its position and the distance from the point P to the cavity's center, etc., shouldn't matter for the electric field outside. Because the outer shell's charge is what contributes to the external field.

Wait, but the point P is outside the conductor, so the conductor's outer surface has +q, so E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². So looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². But wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me make sure. The point P is outside, so the field is only due to the outer charges. The inner charge is +q, but it's inside the cavity, so the conductor's inner surface has -q, and the outer has +q. So the net charge on the conductor is zero? No, wait, the conductor's net charge is zero? Because it was initially uncharged. Wait, the conductor's net charge is the sum of inner and outer. Inner is -q, outer is +q, so sum is zero. So the conductor's total charge is zero. Huh, but that can't be right because the outer surface is +q. Wait, no, the conductor was neutral, so the inner surface must be -q, and the outer surface must be +q, making the total charge of the conductor zero? Because -q + (+q) = 0. So the outer surface charge is +q, so the net charge outside is +q. So the field outside would be that of a point charge +q at the center.

So, independent of where the charge is placed inside the cavity. So the electric field at P would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², which is option B.

Wait, but what if the charge inside the cavity is placed off-center? Would that affect the external field? Because in a conductor, the charges redistribute such that the electric field inside the conductor material is zero. But the induced charges on the inner and outer surfaces are determined by the charge inside the cavity. However, the outer surface's charge distribution is spherically symmetric because the conductor is a sphere. So regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is, the outer surface will have a uniform distribution, resulting in the same external field.

Wait, but wait. If the charge inside the cavity is not at the center, then the inner surface's charge distribution isn't symmetric. But the outer surface's charge distribution remains symmetric because the conductor is a sphere. So yes, the outer surface's charge is uniformly distributed, so the electric field outside is as if all the charge were at the center.

So in this problem, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So the field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². Looking at the options, option B matches that.

So the correct answer should be B.

The problem involves an uncharged spherical conductor of radius \( R \) with a small spherical cavity of radius \( r \) (where \( r < R \)) inside it. The center of the cavity is offset from the center of the conductor by a distance \( s \). A small positive charge \( +q \) is placed inside the cavity, and the task is to determine the electric field \( \vec{E} \) at a point \( P \) outside the conductor, which is at a distance \( L \) from the center of the conductor and a distance \( l \) from the center of the cavity. The angle between \( l \) and \( s \) is \( \theta \).

Key points to consider:

1. **Induced Charges on the Conductor**:  
   Since the conductor is initially neutral, the charge \( +q \) inside the cavity induces an equal and opposite charge \( -q \) on the inner surface of the conductor. To maintain charge neutrality, the outer surface of the conductor must then have a charge \( +q \).

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface. The outer surface has a charge of \( +q \), and the electric field at any point outside the conductor is equivalent to the field produced by a point charge \( +q \) located at the center of the conductor. This is due to the spherical symmetry of the system.

3. **Irrelevance of Internal Geometry**:  
   The position of the charge \( +q \) inside the cavity (e.g., off-center or at the center) does not affect the electric field outside the conductor. The outer surface charge distribution remains symmetric, and the electric field at point \( P \) depends only on the total charge \( +q \) and the distance \( L \) from the center of the conductor.

4. **Electric Field Expression**:  
   The electric field at point \( P \), which is at a distance \( L \) from the center of the conductor, is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

5. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. The expression \( \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l - s \cos\theta)^2} \) is not valid for the electric field outside the conductor, as the field depends only on \( L \), not on the geometry involving \( l \), \( s \), and \( \theta \).  
   - **Option B**: Correct. The expression \( \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2} \) matches the electric field produced by a point charge \( +q \) at the center of the conductor.  
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The expression \( \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{(l + s \cos\theta)^2} \) is not relevant to the electric field outside the conductor.  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The expression \( \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{l^2} \) would only apply if the charge were located at the center of the cavity, which is not the case for the outer surface charge.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
