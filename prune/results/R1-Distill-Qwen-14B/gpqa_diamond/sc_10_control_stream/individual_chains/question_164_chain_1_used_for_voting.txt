Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars are two stars orbiting each other, right? The question is about figuring out how much more massive system_1 is compared to system_2. Let me read the question again carefully.

Alright, so both systems have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses. The radial velocity (RV) variations in system_1 are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. I'm supposed to find the mass ratio, specifically the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2.

Wait, how does radial velocity relate to mass? I remember something about the radial velocity method being used to detect exoplanets. The star's velocity is measured, and from that, the planet's mass is inferred. But in this case, it's a binary system, so both stars are orbiting their common center of mass.

I think the key here is the mass function and Kepler's laws. Oh right, Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period and the masses of the stars. The formula I remember is (M1 + M2) * P² = (4π²/G) * a³, where a is the separation between the two stars. But wait, in this problem, I don't have the separation. So maybe I can relate the velocities to the masses instead.

Another thought: in a binary system, the velocity of each star is inversely proportional to its mass. So if one star is more massive, it will have a smaller velocity. Because the center of mass must balance the two. So, the mass ratio M1/M2 is equal to v2/v1, where v1 and v2 are the velocities of the two stars. Since M1*v1 = M2*v2, yeah, that makes sense.

So for each system, let's denote the two stars as Star A and Star B. In system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. So M1_A / M1_B = v1_B / v1_A = 5/10 = 1/2. So the mass ratio is 1:2. Wait, but wait, that's the individual masses. The total mass of system_1 would be M1 = M1_A + M1_B = (5 +10)/something? Wait, no, I think I should think in terms of the mass function.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each system separately. Let's consider system_1 first. The two stars have RV amplitudes K1 and K2. So K1 is the velocity of star 1, K2 is the velocity of star 2. The ratio of their masses is M1 = (M_total) * (M2 / (M1 + M2)) )? Hmm, maybe not. Let's get back to the basics.

In a binary system, the two stars orbit their mutual center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit (since it's closer to the center). The velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So M1/M2 = v2/v1. So if K1 is the velocity of star 1, and K2 is the velocity of star 2, then M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Wait, but in each system, the two stars' velocities are given. System_1: 10 and 5 km/s. So M1a / M1b = 5 /10 = 1/2. So M1a is half the mass of M1b. Therefore, the total mass of system_1 is M1 = M1a + M1b = (0.5 M1b) + M1b = 1.5 M1b.

Similarly, for system_2, the velocities are 15 and 10. So M2a / M2b = 10/15 = 2/3. So M2a = (2/3) M2b. Total mass M2 = M2a + M2b = (2/3 + 1) M2b = (5/3) M2b.

But how does this relate to the periods? The period for system_1 is 2 years, system_2 is 1 year. I think the period is the same for both stars in a binary system because they orbit each other. So the period is determined by the combined mass.

Wait, but how do I relate the mass to the period and the velocity amplitudes? I think the formula involves the velocity amplitude, the period, and the mass.

I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But wait, that's when you're looking at a star being orbited by a planet. Or in this case, a binary system where both stars are detected. So perhaps for each star, the velocity amplitude K is related to the mass of the other star and the total mass.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider the mass function. The mass function is:

f(M) = (K^3 P) / (241 * π^2 )

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The formula for the mass function in a spectroscopic binary is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But when you have both stars' velocities, you can get more information.

Wait, perhaps I can find the mass ratio from the velocity ratio. Since in a binary system, M1/M2 = v2/v1. So M1 = (v2 / v1) * M2.

So for system_1: v1 =10 km/s, v2=5. So M1a = (5/10) M1b = 0.5 M1b.

So total mass M1 = M1a + M1b = 0.5 M1b + M1b = 1.5 M1b.

Similarly, system_2: v1=15, v2=10. So M2a = (10/15) M2b = 2/3 M2b.

Total mass M2 = 2/3 M2b + M2b = (5/3) M2b.

But how do the periods come into play here? Because the period is the same for both stars in the system.

Ah, right! Kepler's third law for a binary system: (M1 + M2) * P^2 = (4π²/G) * a^3, where a is the separation between the two stars.

But since we don't have a, perhaps we can find the ratio of the masses using the velocities and the period.

Wait, maybe the velocities can be expressed in terms of the orbital period and the masses. Because the velocity of a star in orbit is 2πa/(P), but that's for a circular orbit.

Wait, but each star's velocity is related to the size of their orbit. The more massive star has a smaller orbit, so smaller velocity.

So, for star 1 in system 1, its velocity is v1 = (2π a1)/P1, and for star 2, v2 = (2π a2)/P1. Since a1 + a2 = a (the separation), and M1 a1 = M2 a2 (center of mass condition).

So, M1 a1 = M2 a2 → (M1/M2) = (a2/a1).

But a1 + a2 = a → a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) * a.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me think again.

We have for each system:

v1 = 2π a1 / P

v2 = 2π a2 / P

And a1 + a2 = a.

And from center of mass: M1 a1 = M2 a2.

So, from M1 a1 = M2 a2 → a2 = (M1/M2) a1.

Substituting into a1 + a2 = a:

a1 (1 + M1/M2) = a → a1 = a / (1 + M1/M2) = (M2 a)/(M1 + M2).

Similarly, a2 = (M1 a)/(M1+M2).

Then, substituting into velocity expressions:

v1 = 2π a1 / P = 2π ( M2 a ) / ( (M1 + M2) P )

v2 = 2π a2 / P = 2π ( M1 a ) / ( (M1 + M2) P )

Divide v2 by v1:

v2/v1 = ( M1 a / ( (M1 + M2) P )) ) / ( M2 a / ( (M1 + M2) P )) ) ) → v2/v1 = M1 / M2.

Which matches what I thought earlier: M1/M2 = v2/v1.

So, back to the problem.

For system_1: M1a/M1b = v1b/v1a = 5 /10 = 1/2.

So M1a = (1/2) M1b.

Total mass of system_1: M1 = M1a + M1b = (1/2 + 1) M1b = 3/2 M1b.

Similarly, system_2: M2a/M2b = v2/v1 =10/15= 2/3 → M2a = (2/3) M2b.

Total mass M2 = M2a + M2b = (2/3 + 1) M2b = 5/3 M2b.

But how to relate this to the periods?

Wait, from Kepler's third law, the period is related to the separation and the total mass.

But without knowing the separation, perhaps I can find the ratio of the total masses using the velocities and the periods.

Wait, let's find the ratio (M1_total)/(M2_total) = (M1)/(M2) = ( (M1a + M1b) ) / ( M2a + M2b )

But M1a = 0.5 M1b → M1 = 1.5 M1b.

M2a = (2/3) M2b → M2 = (5/3) M2b.

So, M1 = 1.5 M1b = (3/2) M1b.

M2 = (5/3) M2b.

But I don't know the relation between M1b and M2b yet. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can find the mass ratio using the velocity amplitudes and the periods.

Because from the velocities and the periods, I can compute the semi-major axis of each star's orbit.

Wait, the radial velocity amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_p + M_s)^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula involving the velocities and the period.

Wait, another approach. The mass ratio is (M1_total)/(M2_total) = ( (M1a + M1b) ) / ( M2a + M2b )

But M1a = (1/2) M1b → M1_total = (3/2) M1b.

Similarly, M2_total = (5/3) M2b.

But how to relate M1b and M2b? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the mass function.

In a spectroscopic binary, the mass function is f(M) = (K^3 P) / (241 * π^2 ), where K is the semi-amplitude of the velocity curve, P is the orbital period in years. The mass function f(M) is equal to (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But since we don't know the inclination angle i, which is the angle between the orbital plane and the line of sight (so sin i is the factor that affects the RV), but if the eclipses are observed, that means i is close to 90 degrees, so sin i ≈ 1.

So, for each system, we can compute f(M1) and f(M2), but without knowing the inclination, we can't get the absolute masses. But since both systems are eclipsing, we can assume that sin i is 1 for both. So, we can compute the mass function for each.

Wait, but the problem says that the periods are 2 years and 1 year respectively. So system 1 has period P1=2, system 2 P2=1.

But wait, the problem is about the mass of each system. The sum of the masses.

Wait, perhaps each system's mass can be found using the velocity amplitudes and the period.

Let me write the formula for the mass function for each star.

Wait, for system_1, the two stars have velocities K1=10 and K2=5. But in the mass function, each star contributes to the other's velocity. So, for star 1 in system_1, the mass function would be f1 = (K2^3 P1) / (241 * π^2 )

Similarly, for star 2 in system_1, f2 = (K1^3 P1) / (241 * π^2 )

But since the mass function for each star is the same (f1 = f2 = (M_total')^3 sin^3 i / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute the mass function for each system, then find the ratio.

Alternatively, since I don't know the actual masses, perhaps I can find the ratio of the total masses M1 and M2 by using the mass functions and the velocities.

Because the mass function f(M) is (M_secondary^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_primary + M_secondary)^2 )

But wait, when we have both stars' velocities, we can compute f(M) for each, but I think it's the same for both.

Wait, perhaps I can find M_total for each system.

Let me denote system_1's total mass as M1_total, system_2's as M2_total.

For system_1:

Each star's velocity is K1=10 and K2=5. The period is P1=2 years.

The mass function for each star is f = (K^3 P) / (241 * π^2 )

Wait, but since sin i is 1 (eclipsing), f(M) = (M2^3) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Wait, no, the mass function is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But since sin i=1,

f(M) = M2^3 / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But since M1 and M2 are the two masses, M1 = (M1a) and M2 = (M1b), then M1 + M2 = M_total.

Wait, but in system_1, for the star with K=10, what is the mass function? Let me think.

Wait, for star 1 with velocity K1=10, the mass function f1 is:

f1 = ( (M2)^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Similarly, for star 2 with K2=5, the mass function f2 would be:

f2 = ( (M1)^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Because for star 2, the primary mass is M1, and the secondary is M2.

But since both stars are in the same system, the mass function should be the same. So f1 = f2.

But that can't be right, because f1 = (M2^3)/( (M1+M2)^2 ), and f2 = (M1^3)/( (M1+M2)^2 ). So f1 and f2 are different unless M1 = M2.

So perhaps that approach isn't the way. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the mass function using each star's K and period, and then set them equal.

Wait, but the mass function f is given by f = (K^3 P) / (241 * π^2 ), and for each star in the system, this f would be the same.

So for system_1's star with K1=10:

f1 = (10^3 * 2) / (241 * π² )

Similarly, for the other star in system_1 with K2=5:

f2 = (5^3 * 2) / (241 * π² )

But these can't be different, because f should be the same for both stars. Hmm, that suggests that I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the mass function for each star is f = (K^3 P) / (241 * π² ), but since M1 and M2 are different, the same f value must relate to different terms.

Wait, for each star, the mass function is f = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But when you have both stars, you can compute two expressions for f, but they must be consistent.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of the formula differently.

The mass function for the first star in system_1 is f1 = ( (M2)^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Similarly, for the second star, f2 = ( (M1)^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But since the mass function is the same for the system, regardless of which star you look at, because it's a function of the system's parameters.

Wait, that can't be true unless M1 = M2, which isn't the case here. So I must have made a mistake in understanding the mass function.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass function is the same whether you compute it using either star's velocity.

Wait, no, because the mass function depends on which star's velocity you're observing. For example, if you observe the velocity of star 1, the mass function is (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ), and if you observe star 2, it's (M1^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Therefore, the two mass functions are f1 = (M2^3)/( (M1+M2)^2 ), f2 = (M1^3)/( (M1+M2)^2 )

But for a given system, the mass functions from the two stars are different unless M1 = M2.

But in reality, when you measure the mass function from the star with the larger velocity, it gives a higher f(M), because f is proportional to (M secondary)^3.

Wait, but in our case, for system_1, the two mass functions would be:

f1 (from star 1) = (5^3) / ( (10 +5 )^2 ) = 125 / 225 = 0.555...

f2 (from star 2) = (10^3)/( (10+5)^2 )= 1000/225≈4.444...

But this seems not right because in reality, the mass functions should be the same when using the same period and sin i.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the equations. Let me get the correct formula.

The mass function is f = (K^3 P) / (241 * π² ), and f = (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

So for system_1, let's compute f using each star's K.

For star 1: K=10, P=2.

f1 = (10^3 * 2) / (241 * π² ) ≈ (1000 * 2) / (241 * 9.8696 ) ≈ 2000 / (241 *9.8696 )

Compute that: 241 *9.8696 ≈ 241*10=2410, minus 241*(0.1304)=31.4184 → 2410-31.4184≈2378.58. So f1=2000/2378.58 ≈ 0.84.

Similarly, for star 2, K=5, same P=2.

f2 = (5^3 * 2)/(241 * π² )= (125 *2)/( same denominator )=250 / 2378.58≈0.105.

But according to the formula, f should be the same regardless of which star you look at, which implies that this approach is wrong because f1 and f2 are different.

Wait, that can't be. Oh, I see, because the mass function is defined as the function of the companion's mass.

So for the first star, the mass function f1 is (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

For the second star, the mass function f2 is (M1^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

So f1 and f2 are different unless M1 = M2.

But in reality, when you observe a binary system, you can only get f(M) from one star's velocities. So for each system, you can compute one f(M), based on which star you have the velocity for. But in our case, we have velocities for both stars in each system.

Wait, but in the problem statement, do they have RV variations for both stars?

Question says: In system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations with amplitudes of 10 and 5. So the RVs for both stars are known. So, for each system, we can compute two mass functions.

So for system_1:

f1 = (5^3 ) / ( (10 +5 )^2 ) = 125 / 225 = 5/9 ≈ 0.555

f2 = (10^3 ) / ( (10 +5 )^2 ) = 1000/225 ≈4.444.

But according to the mass function formula, f1 = (5^3) / (15^2 ) =125/225=5/9≈0.555.

Similarly, f2 = (10^3 )/(15^2 )=1000/225≈4.444.

But according to the other formula, f = (K^3 P ) / (241 π² )

So for system_1, star 1 has K=10, P=2.

f1 = (10^3 * 2) / (241 * π² ) ≈ 2000 / (241 *9.8696 )≈2000/2378.5≈0.84.

Star 2, K=5, same P=2.

f2 = (5^3 *2 )/( same denominator )= 250/2378.5≈0.105.

But 0.555 is not equal to 0.84, and 4.444 is not equal to 0.105. So where's the confusion?

Wait, perhaps the mass function using the velocities is not the same as the one where f = (M2^3)/( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Alternatively, perhaps I'm conflating the two different forms of the formula.

Wait, to clarify, the mass function using the velocity is:

f(M) = (K^3 P ) / (241 * π² )

And this is equal to (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

So, for system_1, using star 1:

f1 = (10^3 * 2) / (241 * π² ) ≈ (2000) / (241 *9.8696) ≈ 2000 /2378.5 ≈ 0.84.

Similarly, using star2:

f2 = (5^3 *2 )/( same denominator )= (250)/2378.5≈0.105.

But according to the mass function formula, these should both equal (M2^3 sin^3 i )/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) and (M1^3 sin^3 i )/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) respectively.

So, for system_1:

f1 = (M2^3) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) → 0.84 = (5^3) / (15^2 ) → 125/225=0.555. But 0.84≠0.555. So this doesn't compute.

Hmm, something's wrong here. Maybe I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, probably I should think of the mass function in terms of the companion's mass. So, when using star1's velocity, the mass function represents the mass of star2, and vice versa.

So, f1 = (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Similarly, f2 = (M1^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But since sin i=1 for both, we can write:

f1 = M2^3 / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

f2 = M1^3 / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But using the velocity formula, f1 is 0.84 and f2 is 0.105 (for system_1).

So, setting f1 = M2^3 / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Similarly, f2 = M1^3 / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

So for system_1:

Equation 1: 0.84 = (5^3) / ( (M1 +5)^2 )

Equation 2: 0.105 = (M1^3 ) / ( (M1 +5)^2 )

Wait, but M1 is the mass of star1. Hmm, but wait, in system_1, the stars have velocities 10 and5, so their masses are inversely proportional, so M1 = (5/10) M2 → M1 = 0.5 M2.

Wait, but earlier I thought M1a =0.5 M1b, but perhaps I should call the two masses M1 and M2, with M1 being the more massive star.

Wait, no, the velocities are 10 and5, so the more massive star should have the smaller velocity. So if star1 has velocity 10, and star2 has 5, then star1 is less massive than star2.

Wait, no, M1 is the mass of the star you're observing. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with notation.

Wait, let's clarify: In binary systems, the mass function is derived from the observed velocity of the star and the orbit of its unseen companion. So, when you observe the velocity curve of one star (say star A), the mass function gives you a function involving the mass of the unseen companion (star B).

But in our problem, we have velocities for both stars.

Wait, perhaps in system_1, the two masses are M1 and M2, and their velocities are v1 and v2.

From the velocity ratios, M1/M2 = v2/v1 → M1 = (v2/v1) M2 = (5/10) M2 = 0.5 M2.

So, M1 = 0.5 M2.

Total mass M_total = M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

So M2 = M_total / 1.5.

But how to find M_total.

Wait, using the mass function.

From the velocity of star1 (v1=10 km/s), the mass function f1 = (K^3 P) / (241 π² )

f1 = (10^3 * 2 ) / (241 * π^2 ) ≈ 2000/(241*9.8696) ≈ 0.84.

But f1 also equals (M2^3) / (M_total^2 )

Because f1 = (M2^3) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

So, substituting M1=0.5 M2 and M_total=1.5 M2,

f1 = (M2^3) / ( (1.5 M2)^2 ) = (M2^3 ) / ( 2.25 M2^2 ) )= M2/(2.25 )

So, f1 = M2/(2.25 )

But f1 is also 0.84 (from velocity measurement), so:

M2/(2.25 ) = 0.84 → M2 = 0.84 * 2.25 = 1.89.

So M2 is 1.89 units.

Then M1 = 0.5 * 1.89 = 0.945.

So total mass M_total = 0.945 +1.89=2.835.

Similarly, for system_2:

Velocities are 15 and10, period P=1.

So, M1a = (v2/v1) * M2a = (10/15) * M2a = (2/3) M2a.

M_total= M1a + M2a = (2/3 +1) M2a = (5/3) M2a → M2a= (3/5) M_total.

Now, compute the mass function for system_2.

Using star1's velocity (15 km/s), f2a = (15^3 *1 )/(241 * π² )= (3375 )/(241 *9.8696 )= 3375 / (241*9.8696) ≈ 3375/2378.5≈1.418.

But f2a = (M2a^3) / ( (M1a + M2a)^2 ) = (M2a^3 )/( (M_total)^2 )

Since M2a = (3/5) M_total, M2a = 0.6 M_total.

So,

f2a = ( (0.6 M_total )^3 ) / ( M_total^2 ) = (0.216 M_total^3 ) / ( M_total^2 )= 0.216 M_total.

But f2a from velocity is 1.418, so:

0.216 M_total = 1.418 → M_total ≈1.418 / 0.216 ≈6.57.

So system_2's total mass is approximately6.57.

Now, the question is, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2.

So,

system_1 M_total ≈2.835

system_2 M_total ≈6.57

Wait, but 2.835 is less than 6.57. So system_1 is less massive than system_2.

Wait, but the options are about system_1 being more massive than system_2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the other star's velocity for system_2.

Wait, system_2 has velocities 15 and10. So for star1, K=15, and star2, K=10.

Using star2's velocity to compute f.

f2b = (10^3 *1 )/(241 * π² )=1000/2378.5≈0.420.

But f2b = (M1a^3 )/( (M_total)^2 )

M1a = (2/3) M2a = (2/3)*(3/5 M_total ) = (2/5) M_total.

So,

M1a = 0.4 M_total.

So,

f2b = ( (0.4 M_total )^3 ) / ( M_total^2 ) = (0.064 M_total^3 ) / M_total^2 = 0.064 M_total.

Set equal to 0.420:

0.064 M_total = 0.420 → M_total = 0.420/0.064 ≈6.5625.

Same as before, which is consistent.

So system_2's M_total is ~6.57.

System_1's M_total: ~2.835.

So system_1 is less massive than system_2. But the question asks by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So if the factor is less than 1, that would mean system_1 is less massive.

But the options are:

A) ~0.4

B) ~0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7

Wait, so the factor is M1/M2 = 2.835 /6.57 ≈0.43.

Which is close to option A (0.4) or D (0.7).

Wait, 2.835 /6.57 is approximately 0.43.

So the factor is ~0.43, so system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2, meaning it's less massive by a factor of ~0.43.

But the question is: "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?"

If system_1 is less massive, then the factor is less than 1. So the factor would be 0.43, which is closest to option A (0.4) or D (0.7). Wait, 0.43 is closer to 0.4 than to 0.7.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Let me recompute M1_total and M2_total.

For system_1:

f1 = (10^3 *2 )/(241 * π² ) =2000/(241 *9.8696) ≈2000/(2378.5)≈0.84.

f1 = (M2^3 )/( (M1 + M2 )^2 )

We have M1 =0.5 M2.

So,

M1 +M2 =1.5 M2.

So,

f1 = (M2^3 ) / ( (1.5 M2 )^2 ) = M2^3/( 2.25 M2² )= M2/(2.25).

So,

M2= 0.84 *2.25=1.89.

M_total =1.5 M2= 1.5 *1.89=2.835.

For system_2:

Using star1's velocity (15):

f2a = (15^3 *1 )/(241 * π² )= 3375/(2378.5)=≈1.418.

f2a= (M2a^3 )/( (M1a + M2a )^2 )

M1a = (10/15) M2a = (2/3) M2a.

M_total= M1a + M2a = (2/3 M2a ) + M2a = (5/3 M2a )

So, M2a = (3/5) M_total.

So,

f2a = ( ( (3/5 M_total ) )^3 ) / ( (M_total )^2 )

= (27/125 M_total^3 ) / ( M_total^2 )

= (27/125 ) M_total.

Set equal to 1.418:

(27/125) M_total =1.418 → M_total= (1.418 *125 )/27.

1.418 *125 =177.25 → 177.25/27≈6.565.

So M_total system_2 ≈6.565.

Thus, M1_total = 2.835, M2_total=6.565.

So,

M1 / M2 = 2.835 /6.565 ≈0.432.

Which is approximately 0.43, closest to option A (0.4) or perhaps option D (0.7), but not really.

Wait, the options are: A) ~0.4, D) ~0.7.

0.43 is closer to 0.4 than to 0.7.

So the answer would be approximately 0.43. Looking at the options, the closest is A) ~0.4. But wait, another possibility: perhaps I should have normalized the other way around.

Wait, the question is: "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?"

So, it's M1 / M2 = 0.43.

But the options don't have 0.43, so the closest is A) ~0.4.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, system_1's M_total is 2.835, system_2's is 6.565.

So 2.835 /6.565 is approximately 0.43.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, option D is ~0.7.

Hmm, 0.43 is closer to 0.4 (difference of 0.03) than to 0.7 (difference of 0.27).

But perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the mass function approach.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for the total mass.

The formula for the total mass in a binary system is:

M_total = (v1 + v2) * (P/(2π)) * (some factor involving G and constants).

Wait, perhaps using Kepler's third law in the form:

M_total = (4 π² a^3) / (G P² )

But a is the separation, which is a1 + a2 = a.

From the center of mass condition: a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) a, a2=(M1/(M1+M2)) a.

The velocities are v1 = 2 π a1 / P, v2=2 π a2 / P.

So,

v1 = 2 π ( (M2 a) / (M_total P) )

Similarly,

v2 = 2 π ( (M1 a)/( M_total P ) )

So,

v1 = (2 π a M2 )/( M_total P )

v2 = (2 π a M1 )/( M_total P )

Adding v1 and v2:

v1 + v2 = 2 π a (M1 + M2 ) / ( M_total P )

But M1 + M2 = M_total, so:

v1 + v2 = 2 π a / P.

But from Kepler's third law,

M_total = (4 π² a^3)/( G P² )

So,

a^3 = ( G P² M_total )/(4 π² )

a = [ ( G P² M_total )/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting back into v1 + v2:

v1 + v2 = 2 π [ ( G P² M_total/(4 π² ) )^(1/3 ) ] / P

= 2 π [ G P² M_total/(4 π² ) )^(1/3 ) ] / P

This seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to find the ratio of M_total for system_1 to system_2.

Let me denote system_1's M_total as M1, system_2's as M2.

For system_1:

v1 =10, v2=5, P1=2.

v1 + v2 =15.

For system_2:

v1=15, v2=10, P2=1.

v1 +v2=25.

But how to relate this to the masses.

Wait, from the velocity and period, perhaps the sum of the velocities can be used in some way.

Alternatively, considering that each system's M_total is proportional to (v1 + v2) * (P) / something.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Alternatively, since I have M1_total and M2_total as 2.835 and6.565 respectively, the ratio is ~0.43.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) ~0.4, but perhaps the exact calculation would be more precise.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact values without approximations.

Compute M1_total:

M_total1 =1.5 * M2a.

Wait, no, earlier we have:

For system_1:

f1 = (K1^3 P1 ) / (241 π² ) = (10^3 * 2 )/(241 * π² )

=2000/(241 *9.8696044 )

Compute denominator: 241 *9.8696044.

Calculate 241 *9 =2169, 241 *0.8696044≈241 *0.87≈209.07. Total≈2169+209.07=2378.07.

So,

f1=2000 /2378.07≈0.841.

Then, f1 = M2/(2.25 )

So,

M2=0.841 *2.25 =1.89225.

M_total1=1.5 *1.89225=2.838375.

Similarly, system_2:

f2a= (15^3 *1 )/(241 * π² )=3375/(241 *9.8696 )

=3375/2378.07≈1.418.

f2a= ( (3/5 M_total2 )^3 ) / (M_total2 )^2 )= ( (27/125 M_total2^3 ) ) / ( M_total2^2 ) )= (27/125 ) M_total2.

So,

27/125 M_total2=1.418 → M_total2= (1.418 *125 )/27.

1.418 *125 =177.25.

177.25 /27 ≈6.565.

Thus,

M1_total=2.838, M2_total=6.565.

So,

M1/M2=2.838/6.565≈0.432.

So the factor is approximately 0.43.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, and option D is ~0.7.

0.43 is closer to 0.4 than to 0.7.

But wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass functions.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the velocity of the other star in system_2.

In system_2, using star2's velocity (10 km/s):

f2b = (10^3 *1 ) / (241 * π² )=1000/2378.07≈0.420.

f2b = (M1a^3 )/( (M_total2 )^2 )

M1a= (10/15) M2a= (2/3) M2a.

But M2a= (3/5) M_total2.

So,

M1a= (2/3)(3/5 M_total2 )= (2/5) M_total2.

So,

f2b= ( (2/5 M_total2 )^3 ) / ( (M_total2 )^2 )

= (8/125 M_total2^3 ) / (M_total2^2 )

=8/(125) M_total2.

Set equal to 0.420:

(8/125) M_total2 =0.420 → M_total2= (0.420 *125 )/8= (52.5)/8=6.5625.

Same as before.

So, M_total2=6.5625.

Thus, the ratio remains approximately 2.838/6.5625≈0.432.

So the factor is approximately 0.43, which is closest to option A (0.4) or perhaps D (0.7). But 0.43 is closer to 0.4, so the answer should be option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is ~0.7. Hmm, perhaps there is another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the velocity amplitudes and the periods, without considering the mass function.

The formula for the total mass in a binary system is given by:

M_total = ( (v1 + v2 )^3 P )/( 241.3 * π² )

Wait, is that correct? I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. The mass function is f = (K^3 P )/(241.3 * π² )

But f = (M2^3 sin^3 i )/( (M1 + M2 )^2 )

But without knowing M2, it's hard to proceed. Unless I take the ratio of the two f's.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the ratio of the mass functions for the two systems.

For system_1:

f1 = (10^3 * 2 )/(241 * π² )=2000/2378≈0.841.

For system_2:

f2 = (15^3 *1 )/(241 * π² )=3375/2378≈1.418.

So the ratio f1/f2=0.841/1.418≈0.593.

But f1/f2= [ (M2a^3 )/(M_total1^2 ) ] / [ (M2b^3 )/(M_total2^2 ) ]

Where M2a is the mass of the companion in system_1, and M2b is the mass of the companion in system_2.

But this doesn't directly give the ratio of M_total1 and M_total2, unless I have more information about the individual masses.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should approach the problem differently. Let's think about the mass function for each system.

The mass function for system_1 is f1 = (10^3 *2 )/(241 * π² )≈0.841.

Similarly, for system_2, using the 15 km/s star, f2 = (15^3 *1 )/(241 * π² )≈1.418.

The mass function is f = (M2^3 sin^3 i )/( (M1 + M2 )^2 )

Assuming sin i=1 for both systems.

So for system_1, f1 = M2a^3 / ( (M1a + M2a )^2 )

And for system_2, f2= M2b^3 / ( (M1b + M2b )^2 )

But without knowing M1a, M2a, etc., it's difficult to proceed.

Wait, but in system_1, the velocities are 10 and5, so the mass ratio is M1a/M2a =5/10=0.5.

So, M1a=0.5 M2a.

Total mass M_total1=1.5 M2a.

Thus, f1= M2a^3 / ( (1.5 M2a )^2 )= M2a/(2.25 )

So,

M2a= f1 *2.25 =0.841 *2.25=1.892.

M_total1=1.5 *1.892=2.838.

Similarly, for system_2:

Velocities are15 and10, so mass ratio M1b/M2b=10/15=2/3.

So, M1b= (2/3) M2b.

Total mass M_total2= (5/3) M2b.

f2= M2b^3 / ( ( (5/3 M2b ) )^2 )= M2b^3/( (25/9) M2b^2 )= (9/25) M2b.

Set f2=1.418= (9/25) M2b → M2b=1.418*(25/9 )= (35.45)/9≈3.939.

Then, M_total2= (5/3)*3.939≈6.565.

So, same result as before.

Thus, ratio M_total1/M_total2=2.838/6.565≈0.432.

Which is approximately 0.43. The options are A) ~0.4, D) ~0.7.

So the answer should be closest to option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how much more massive system_1 is compared to system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationships between radial velocity (RV) amplitudes, periods, and total masses in binary systems. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Radial Velocity and Mass Ratio**:  
   In a binary system, the masses of the two stars are inversely proportional to their radial velocity amplitudes. For system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, giving a mass ratio of \( M_1/M_2 = 5/10 = 1/2 \). For system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s, giving a mass ratio of \( M_1/M_2 = 10/15 = 2/3 \).

2. **Total Mass of Each System**:  
   The total mass of a binary system is the sum of the masses of its two stars.  
   - For system_1:  
     Let the masses of the two stars be \( M_{1a} \) and \( M_{1b} \), where \( M_{1a}/M_{1b} = 1/2 \). Thus, \( M_{1a} = 0.5 M_{1b} \), and the total mass is:  
     \[
     M_{\text{total,1}} = M_{1a} + M_{1b} = 0.5 M_{1b} + M_{1b} = 1.5 M_{1b}.
     \]
   - For system_2:  
     Let the masses of the two stars be \( M_{2a} \) and \( M_{2b} \), where \( M_{2a}/M_{2b} = 2/3 \). Thus, \( M_{2a} = (2/3) M_{2b} \), and the total mass is:  
     \[
     M_{\text{total,2}} = M_{2a} + M_{2b} = (2/3) M_{2b} + M_{2b} = (5/3) M_{2b}.
     \]

3. **Mass Function and Total Mass**:  
   The mass function relates the RV amplitude, period, and total mass. Using the formula:  
   \[
   f(M) = \frac{K^3 P}{241 \pi^2},
   \]  
   where \( K \) is the RV amplitude and \( P \) is the orbital period, we compute the mass function for each system. Assuming \( \sin i = 1 \) (eclipsing systems), the mass function simplifies to:  
   \[
   f(M) = \frac{M_{\text{companion}}^3}{(M_{\text{total}})^2}.
   \]  
   - For system_1:  
     Using \( K = 10 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( P = 2 \, \text{years} \):  
     \[
     f_1 = \frac{10^3 \cdot 2}{241 \cdot \pi^2} \approx 0.841.
     \]  
     Substituting into \( f_1 = \frac{M_{1b}^3}{(M_{\text{total,1}})^2} \):  
     \[
     0.841 = \frac{M_{1b}^3}{(1.5 M_{1b})^2}.
     \]  
     Solving gives \( M_{1b} \approx 1.89 \), and \( M_{\text{total,1}} = 1.5 M_{1b} \approx 2.838 \).  
   - For system_2:  
     Using \( K = 15 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( P = 1 \, \text{year} \):  
     \[
     f_2 = \frac{15^3 \cdot 1}{241 \cdot \pi^2} \approx 1.418.
     \]  
     Substituting into \( f_2 = \frac{M_{2b}^3}{(M_{\text{total,2}})^2} \):  
     \[
     1.418 = \frac{M_{2b}^3}{(1.5 M_{2b})^2}.
     \]  
     Solving gives \( M_{2b} \approx 3.939 \), and \( M_{\text{total,2}} = 1.5 M_{2b} \approx 6.565 \).

4. **Mass Ratio**:  
   The total masses of the systems are \( M_{\text{total,1}} \approx 2.838 \) and \( M_{\text{total,2}} \approx 6.565 \). The ratio of their masses is:  
   \[
   \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{2.838}{6.565} \approx 0.432.
   \]  
   This means system_1 is approximately 0.43 times as massive as system_2.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   Among the given options, the closest value to 0.43 is **A) ~0.4**.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem about binary star systems. Hmm, binary stars are two stars orbiting each other, right? The question is about figuring out how much more massive system_1 is compared to system_2. Let me read the question again carefully.

Alright, so both systems have eclipses with periods of 2 years and 1 year, respectively. The period is the time between two primary eclipses. The radial velocity (RV) variations in system_1 are 10 km/s and 5 km/s. In system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 and 10 km/s. I'm supposed to find the mass ratio, specifically the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2.

Wait, how does radial velocity relate to mass? I remember something about the radial velocity method being used to detect exoplanets. The star's velocity is measured, and from that, the planet's mass is inferred. But in this case, it's a binary system, so both stars are orbiting their common center of mass.

I think the key here is the mass function and Kepler's laws. Oh right, Kepler's third law, which relates the orbital period and the masses of the stars. The formula I remember is (M1 + M2) * P² = (4π²/G) * a³, where a is the separation between the two stars. But wait, in this problem, I don't have the separation. So maybe I can relate the velocities to the masses instead.

Another thought: in a binary system, the velocity of each star is inversely proportional to its mass. So if one star is more massive, it will have a smaller velocity. Because the center of mass must balance the two. So, the mass ratio M1/M2 is equal to v2/v1, where v1 and v2 are the velocities of the two stars. Since M1*v1 = M2*v2, yeah, that makes sense.

So for each system, let's denote the two stars as Star A and Star B. In system_1, the velocities are 10 and 5 km/s. So M1_A / M1_B = v1_B / v1_A = 5/10 = 1/2. So the mass ratio is 1:2. Wait, but wait, that's the individual masses. The total mass of system_1 would be M1 = M1_A + M1_B = (5 +10)/something? Wait, no, I think I should think in terms of the mass function.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each system separately. Let's consider system_1 first. The two stars have RV amplitudes K1 and K2. So K1 is the velocity of star 1, K2 is the velocity of star 2. The ratio of their masses is M1 = (M_total) * (M2 / (M1 + M2)) )? Hmm, maybe not. Let's get back to the basics.

In a binary system, the two stars orbit their mutual center of mass. The more massive star will have a smaller orbit (since it's closer to the center). The velocities are inversely proportional to their masses. So M1/M2 = v2/v1. So if K1 is the velocity of star 1, and K2 is the velocity of star 2, then M1/M2 = K2/K1.

Wait, but in each system, the two stars' velocities are given. System_1: 10 and 5 km/s. So M1a / M1b = 5 /10 = 1/2. So M1a is half the mass of M1b. Therefore, the total mass of system_1 is M1 = M1a + M1b = (0.5 M1b) + M1b = 1.5 M1b.

Similarly, for system_2, the velocities are 15 and 10. So M2a / M2b = 10/15 = 2/3. So M2a = (2/3) M2b. Total mass M2 = M2a + M2b = (2/3 + 1) M2b = (5/3) M2b.

But how does this relate to the periods? The period for system_1 is 2 years, system_2 is 1 year. I think the period is the same for both stars in a binary system because they orbit each other. So the period is determined by the combined mass.

Wait, but how do I relate the mass to the period and the velocity amplitudes? I think the formula involves the velocity amplitude, the period, and the mass.

I remember that the radial velocity semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (2π G)^(1/3) * (M2 sin i) / ( (M1 + M2)^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

But wait, that's when you're looking at a star being orbited by a planet. Or in this case, a binary system where both stars are detected. So perhaps for each star, the velocity amplitude K is related to the mass of the other star and the total mass.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider the mass function. The mass function is:

f(M) = (K^3 P) / (241 * π^2 )

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The formula for the mass function in a spectroscopic binary is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But when you have both stars' velocities, you can get more information.

Wait, perhaps I can find the mass ratio from the velocity ratio. Since in a binary system, M1/M2 = v2/v1. So M1 = (v2 / v1) * M2.

So for system_1: v1 =10 km/s, v2=5. So M1a = (5/10) M1b = 0.5 M1b.

So total mass M1 = M1a + M1b = 0.5 M1b + M1b = 1.5 M1b.

Similarly, system_2: v1=15, v2=10. So M2a = (10/15) M2b = 2/3 M2b.

Total mass M2 = 2/3 M2b + M2b = (5/3) M2b.

But how do the periods come into play here? Because the period is the same for both stars in the system.

Ah, right! Kepler's third law for a binary system: (M1 + M2) * P^2 = (4π²/G) * a^3, where a is the separation between the two stars.

But since we don't have a, perhaps we can find the ratio of the masses using the velocities and the period.

Wait, maybe the velocities can be expressed in terms of the orbital period and the masses. Because the velocity of a star in orbit is 2πa/(P), but that's for a circular orbit.

Wait, but each star's velocity is related to the size of their orbit. The more massive star has a smaller orbit, so smaller velocity.

So, for star 1 in system 1, its velocity is v1 = (2π a1)/P1, and for star 2, v2 = (2π a2)/P1. Since a1 + a2 = a (the separation), and M1 a1 = M2 a2 (center of mass condition).

So, M1 a1 = M2 a2 → (M1/M2) = (a2/a1).

But a1 + a2 = a → a2 = (M1/(M1+M2)) * a.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me think again.

We have for each system:

v1 = 2π a1 / P

v2 = 2π a2 / P

And a1 + a2 = a.

And from center of mass: M1 a1 = M2 a2.

So, from M1 a1 = M2 a2 → a2 = (M1/M2) a1.

Substituting into a1 + a2 = a:

a1 (1 + M1/M2) = a → a1 = a / (1 + M1/M2) = (M2 a)/(M1 + M2).

Similarly, a2 = (M1 a)/(M1+M2).

Then, substituting into velocity expressions:

v1 = 2π a1 / P = 2π ( M2 a ) / ( (M1 + M2) P )

v2 = 2π a2 / P = 2π ( M1 a ) / ( (M1 + M2) P )

Divide v2 by v1:

v2/v1 = ( M1 a / ( (M1 + M2) P )) ) / ( M2 a / ( (M1 + M2) P )) ) ) → v2/v1 = M1 / M2.

Which matches what I thought earlier: M1/M2 = v2/v1.

So, back to the problem.

For system_1: M1a/M1b = v1b/v1a = 5 /10 = 1/2.

So M1a = (1/2) M1b.

Total mass of system_1: M1 = M1a + M1b = (1/2 + 1) M1b = 3/2 M1b.

Similarly, system_2: M2a/M2b = v2/v1 =10/15= 2/3 → M2a = (2/3) M2b.

Total mass M2 = M2a + M2b = (2/3 + 1) M2b = 5/3 M2b.

But how to relate this to the periods?

Wait, from Kepler's third law, the period is related to the separation and the total mass.

But without knowing the separation, perhaps I can find the ratio of the total masses using the velocities and the periods.

Wait, let's find the ratio (M1_total)/(M2_total) = (M1)/(M2) = ( (M1a + M1b) ) / ( M2a + M2b )

But M1a = 0.5 M1b → M1 = 1.5 M1b.

M2a = (2/3) M2b → M2 = (5/3) M2b.

So, M1 = 1.5 M1b = (3/2) M1b.

M2 = (5/3) M2b.

But I don't know the relation between M1b and M2b yet. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can find the mass ratio using the velocity amplitudes and the periods.

Because from the velocities and the periods, I can compute the semi-major axis of each star's orbit.

Wait, the radial velocity amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2π G )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_p + M_s)^(2/3) P^(1/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the formula involving the velocities and the period.

Wait, another approach. The mass ratio is (M1_total)/(M2_total) = ( (M1a + M1b) ) / ( M2a + M2b )

But M1a = (1/2) M1b → M1_total = (3/2) M1b.

Similarly, M2_total = (5/3) M2b.

But how to relate M1b and M2b? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the mass function.

In a spectroscopic binary, the mass function is f(M) = (K^3 P) / (241 * π^2 ), where K is the semi-amplitude of the velocity curve, P is the orbital period in years. The mass function f(M) is equal to (M2^3 sin^3 i)/( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But since we don't know the inclination angle i, which is the angle between the orbital plane and the line of sight (so sin i is the factor that affects the RV), but if the eclipses are observed, that means i is close to 90 degrees, so sin i ≈ 1.

So, for each system, we can compute f(M1) and f(M2), but without knowing the inclination, we can't get the absolute masses. But since both systems are eclipsing, we can assume that sin i is 1 for both. So, we can compute the mass function for each.

Wait, but the problem says that the periods are 2 years and 1 year respectively. So system 1 has period P1=2, system 2 P2=1.

But wait, the problem is about the mass of each system. The sum of the masses.

Wait, perhaps each system's mass can be found using the velocity amplitudes and the period.

Let me write the formula for the mass function for each star.

Wait, for system_1, the two stars have velocities K1=10 and K2=5. But in the mass function, each star contributes to the other's velocity. So, for star 1 in system_1, the mass function would be f1 = (K2^3 P1) / (241 * π^2 )

Similarly, for star 2 in system_1, f2 = (K1^3 P1) / (241 * π^2 )

But since the mass function for each star is the same (f1 = f2 = (M_total')^3 sin^3 i / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) ), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to compute the mass function for each system, then find the ratio.

Alternatively, since I don't know the actual masses, perhaps I can find the ratio of the total masses M1 and M2 by using the mass functions and the velocities.

Because the mass function f(M) is (M_secondary^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M_primary + M_secondary)^2 )

But wait, when we have both stars' velocities, we can compute f(M) for each, but I think it's the same for both.

Wait, perhaps I can find M_total for each system.

Let me denote system_1's total mass as M1_total, system_2's as M2_total.

For system_1:

Each star's velocity is K1=10 and K2=5. The period is P1=2 years.

The mass function for each star is f = (K^3 P) / (241 * π^2 )

Wait, but since sin i is 1 (eclipsing), f(M) = (M2^3) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Wait, no, the mass function is f(M) = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But since sin i=1,

f(M) = M2^3 / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But since M1 and M2 are the two masses, M1 = (M1a) and M2 = (M1b), then M1 + M2 = M_total.

Wait, but in system_1, for the star with K=10, what is the mass function? Let me think.

Wait, for star 1 with velocity K1=10, the mass function f1 is:

f1 = ( (M2)^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Similarly, for star 2 with K2=5, the mass function f2 would be:

f2 = ( (M1)^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Because for star 2, the primary mass is M1, and the secondary is M2.

But since both stars are in the same system, the mass function should be the same. So f1 = f2.

But that can't be right, because f1 = (M2^3)/( (M1+M2)^2 ), and f2 = (M1^3)/( (M1+M2)^2 ). So f1 and f2 are different unless M1 = M2.

So perhaps that approach isn't the way. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the mass function using each star's K and period, and then set them equal.

Wait, but the mass function f is given by f = (K^3 P) / (241 * π^2 ), and for each star in the system, this f would be the same.

So for system_1's star with K1=10:

f1 = (10^3 * 2) / (241 * π² )

Similarly, for the other star in system_1 with K2=5:

f2 = (5^3 * 2) / (241 * π² )

But these can't be different, because f should be the same for both stars. Hmm, that suggests that I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the mass function for each star is f = (K^3 P) / (241 * π² ), but since M1 and M2 are different, the same f value must relate to different terms.

Wait, for each star, the mass function is f = (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But when you have both stars, you can compute two expressions for f, but they must be consistent.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think of the formula differently.

The mass function for the first star in system_1 is f1 = ( (M2)^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Similarly, for the second star, f2 = ( (M1)^3 ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But since the mass function is the same for the system, regardless of which star you look at, because it's a function of the system's parameters.

Wait, that can't be true unless M1 = M2, which isn't the case here. So I must have made a mistake in understanding the mass function.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass function is the same whether you compute it using either star's velocity.

Wait, no, because the mass function depends on which star's velocity you're observing. For example, if you observe the velocity of star 1, the mass function is (M2^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ), and if you observe star 2, it's (M1^3 sin^3 i) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Therefore, the two mass functions are f1 = (M2^3)/( (M1+M2)^2 ), f2 = (M1^3)/( (M1+M2)^2 )

But for a given system, the mass functions from the two stars are different unless M1 = M2.

But in reality, when you measure the mass function from the star with the larger velocity, it gives a higher f(M), because f is proportional to (M secondary)^3.

Wait, but in our case, for system_1, the two mass functions would be:

f1 (from star 1) = (5^3) / ( (10 +5 )^2 ) = 125 / 225 = 0.555...

f2 (from star 2) = (10^3)/( (10+5)^2 )= 1000/225≈4.444...

But this seems not right because in reality, the mass functions should be the same when using the same period and sin i.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the equations. Let me get the correct formula.

The mass function is f = (K^3 P) / (241 * π² ), and f = (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

So for system_1, let's compute f using each star's K.

For star 1: K=10, P=2.

f1 = (10^3 * 2) / (241 * π² ) ≈ (1000 * 2) / (241 * 9.8696 ) ≈ 2000 / (241 *9.8696 )

Compute that: 241 *9.8696 ≈ 241*10=2410, minus 241*(0.1304)=31.4184 → 2410-31.4184≈2378.58. So f1=2000/2378.58 ≈ 0.84.

Similarly, for star 2, K=5, same P=2.

f2 = (5^3 * 2)/(241 * π² )= (125 *2)/( same denominator )=250 / 2378.58≈0.105.

But according to the formula, f should be the same regardless of which star you look at, which implies that this approach is wrong because f1 and f2 are different.

Wait, that can't be. Oh, I see, because the mass function is defined as the function of the companion's mass.

So for the first star, the mass function f1 is (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

For the second star, the mass function f2 is (M1^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

So f1 and f2 are different unless M1 = M2.

But in reality, when you observe a binary system, you can only get f(M) from one star's velocities. So for each system, you can compute one f(M), based on which star you have the velocity for. But in our case, we have velocities for both stars in each system.

Wait, but in the problem statement, do they have RV variations for both stars?

Question says: In system_1, the two stars display sinusoidal variations with amplitudes of 10 and 5. So the RVs for both stars are known. So, for each system, we can compute two mass functions.

So for system_1:

f1 = (5^3 ) / ( (10 +5 )^2 ) = 125 / 225 = 5/9 ≈ 0.555

f2 = (10^3 ) / ( (10 +5 )^2 ) = 1000/225 ≈4.444.

But according to the mass function formula, f1 = (5^3) / (15^2 ) =125/225=5/9≈0.555.

Similarly, f2 = (10^3 )/(15^2 )=1000/225≈4.444.

But according to the other formula, f = (K^3 P ) / (241 π² )

So for system_1, star 1 has K=10, P=2.

f1 = (10^3 * 2) / (241 * π² ) ≈ 2000 / (241 *9.8696 )≈2000/2378.5≈0.84.

Star 2, K=5, same P=2.

f2 = (5^3 *2 )/( same denominator )= 250/2378.5≈0.105.

But 0.555 is not equal to 0.84, and 4.444 is not equal to 0.105. So where's the confusion?

Wait, perhaps the mass function using the velocities is not the same as the one where f = (M2^3)/( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Alternatively, perhaps I'm conflating the two different forms of the formula.

Wait, to clarify, the mass function using the velocity is:

f(M) = (K^3 P ) / (241 * π² )

And this is equal to (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

So, for system_1, using star 1:

f1 = (10^3 * 2) / (241 * π² ) ≈ (2000) / (241 *9.8696) ≈ 2000 /2378.5 ≈ 0.84.

Similarly, using star2:

f2 = (5^3 *2 )/( same denominator )= (250)/2378.5≈0.105.

But according to the mass function formula, these should both equal (M2^3 sin^3 i )/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) and (M1^3 sin^3 i )/( (M1 + M2)^2 ) respectively.

So, for system_1:

f1 = (M2^3) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 ) → 0.84 = (5^3) / (15^2 ) → 125/225=0.555. But 0.84≠0.555. So this doesn't compute.

Hmm, something's wrong here. Maybe I'm making a mistake in the formula.

Wait, probably I should think of the mass function in terms of the companion's mass. So, when using star1's velocity, the mass function represents the mass of star2, and vice versa.

So, f1 = (M2^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Similarly, f2 = (M1^3 sin^3 i ) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But since sin i=1 for both, we can write:

f1 = M2^3 / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

f2 = M1^3 / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

But using the velocity formula, f1 is 0.84 and f2 is 0.105 (for system_1).

So, setting f1 = M2^3 / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

Similarly, f2 = M1^3 / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

So for system_1:

Equation 1: 0.84 = (5^3) / ( (M1 +5)^2 )

Equation 2: 0.105 = (M1^3 ) / ( (M1 +5)^2 )

Wait, but M1 is the mass of star1. Hmm, but wait, in system_1, the stars have velocities 10 and5, so their masses are inversely proportional, so M1 = (5/10) M2 → M1 = 0.5 M2.

Wait, but earlier I thought M1a =0.5 M1b, but perhaps I should call the two masses M1 and M2, with M1 being the more massive star.

Wait, no, the velocities are 10 and5, so the more massive star should have the smaller velocity. So if star1 has velocity 10, and star2 has 5, then star1 is less massive than star2.

Wait, no, M1 is the mass of the star you're observing. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with notation.

Wait, let's clarify: In binary systems, the mass function is derived from the observed velocity of the star and the orbit of its unseen companion. So, when you observe the velocity curve of one star (say star A), the mass function gives you a function involving the mass of the unseen companion (star B).

But in our problem, we have velocities for both stars.

Wait, perhaps in system_1, the two masses are M1 and M2, and their velocities are v1 and v2.

From the velocity ratios, M1/M2 = v2/v1 → M1 = (v2/v1) M2 = (5/10) M2 = 0.5 M2.

So, M1 = 0.5 M2.

Total mass M_total = M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

So M2 = M_total / 1.5.

But how to find M_total.

Wait, using the mass function.

From the velocity of star1 (v1=10 km/s), the mass function f1 = (K^3 P) / (241 π² )

f1 = (10^3 * 2 ) / (241 * π^2 ) ≈ 2000/(241*9.8696) ≈ 0.84.

But f1 also equals (M2^3) / (M_total^2 )

Because f1 = (M2^3) / ( (M1 + M2)^2 )

So, substituting M1=0.5 M2 and M_total=1.5 M2,

f1 = (M2^3) / ( (1.5 M2)^2 ) = (M2^3 ) / ( 2.25 M2^2 ) )= M2/(2.25 )

So, f1 = M2/(2.25 )

But f1 is also 0.84 (from velocity measurement), so:

M2/(2.25 ) = 0.84 → M2 = 0.84 * 2.25 = 1.89.

So M2 is 1.89 units.

Then M1 = 0.5 * 1.89 = 0.945.

So total mass M_total = 0.945 +1.89=2.835.

Similarly, for system_2:

Velocities are 15 and10, period P=1.

So, M1a = (v2/v1) * M2a = (10/15) * M2a = (2/3) M2a.

M_total= M1a + M2a = (2/3 +1) M2a = (5/3) M2a → M2a= (3/5) M_total.

Now, compute the mass function for system_2.

Using star1's velocity (15 km/s), f2a = (15^3 *1 )/(241 * π² )= (3375 )/(241 *9.8696 )= 3375 / (241*9.8696) ≈ 3375/2378.5≈1.418.

But f2a = (M2a^3) / ( (M1a + M2a)^2 ) = (M2a^3 )/( (M_total)^2 )

Since M2a = (3/5) M_total, M2a = 0.6 M_total.

So,

f2a = ( (0.6 M_total )^3 ) / ( M_total^2 ) = (0.216 M_total^3 ) / ( M_total^2 )= 0.216 M_total.

But f2a from velocity is 1.418, so:

0.216 M_total = 1.418 → M_total ≈1.418 / 0.216 ≈6.57.

So system_2's total mass is approximately6.57.

Now, the question is, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2.

So,

system_1 M_total ≈2.835

system_2 M_total ≈6.57

Wait, but 2.835 is less than 6.57. So system_1 is less massive than system_2.

Wait, but the options are about system_1 being more massive than system_2. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the other star's velocity for system_2.

Wait, system_2 has velocities 15 and10. So for star1, K=15, and star2, K=10.

Using star2's velocity to compute f.

f2b = (10^3 *1 )/(241 * π² )=1000/2378.5≈0.420.

But f2b = (M1a^3 )/( (M_total)^2 )

M1a = (2/3) M2a = (2/3)*(3/5 M_total ) = (2/5) M_total.

So,

M1a = 0.4 M_total.

So,

f2b = ( (0.4 M_total )^3 ) / ( M_total^2 ) = (0.064 M_total^3 ) / M_total^2 = 0.064 M_total.

Set equal to 0.420:

0.064 M_total = 0.420 → M_total = 0.420/0.064 ≈6.5625.

Same as before, which is consistent.

So system_2's M_total is ~6.57.

System_1's M_total: ~2.835.

So system_1 is less massive than system_2. But the question asks by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So if the factor is less than 1, that would mean system_1 is less massive.

But the options are:

A) ~0.4

B) ~0.6

C) ~1.2

D) ~0.7

Wait, so the factor is M1/M2 = 2.835 /6.57 ≈0.43.

Which is close to option A (0.4) or D (0.7).

Wait, 2.835 /6.57 is approximately 0.43.

So the factor is ~0.43, so system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2, meaning it's less massive by a factor of ~0.43.

But the question is: "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?"

If system_1 is less massive, then the factor is less than 1. So the factor would be 0.43, which is closest to option A (0.4) or D (0.7). Wait, 0.43 is closer to 0.4 than to 0.7.

But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Let me recompute M1_total and M2_total.

For system_1:

f1 = (10^3 *2 )/(241 * π² ) =2000/(241 *9.8696) ≈2000/(2378.5)≈0.84.

f1 = (M2^3 )/( (M1 + M2 )^2 )

We have M1 =0.5 M2.

So,

M1 +M2 =1.5 M2.

So,

f1 = (M2^3 ) / ( (1.5 M2 )^2 ) = M2^3/( 2.25 M2² )= M2/(2.25).

So,

M2= 0.84 *2.25=1.89.

M_total =1.5 M2= 1.5 *1.89=2.835.

For system_2:

Using star1's velocity (15):

f2a = (15^3 *1 )/(241 * π² )= 3375/(2378.5)=≈1.418.

f2a= (M2a^3 )/( (M1a + M2a )^2 )

M1a = (10/15) M2a = (2/3) M2a.

M_total= M1a + M2a = (2/3 M2a ) + M2a = (5/3 M2a )

So, M2a = (3/5) M_total.

So,

f2a = ( ( (3/5 M_total ) )^3 ) / ( (M_total )^2 )

= (27/125 M_total^3 ) / ( M_total^2 )

= (27/125 ) M_total.

Set equal to 1.418:

(27/125) M_total =1.418 → M_total= (1.418 *125 )/27.

1.418 *125 =177.25 → 177.25/27≈6.565.

So M_total system_2 ≈6.565.

Thus, M1_total = 2.835, M2_total=6.565.

So,

M1 / M2 = 2.835 /6.565 ≈0.432.

Which is approximately 0.43, closest to option A (0.4) or perhaps option D (0.7), but not really.

Wait, the options are: A) ~0.4, D) ~0.7.

0.43 is closer to 0.4 than to 0.7.

So the answer would be approximately 0.43. Looking at the options, the closest is A) ~0.4. But wait, another possibility: perhaps I should have normalized the other way around.

Wait, the question is: "By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?"

So, it's M1 / M2 = 0.43.

But the options don't have 0.43, so the closest is A) ~0.4.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, system_1's M_total is 2.835, system_2's is 6.565.

So 2.835 /6.565 is approximately 0.43.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, option D is ~0.7.

Hmm, 0.43 is closer to 0.4 (difference of 0.03) than to 0.7 (difference of 0.27).

But perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the mass function approach.

Wait, another approach: using the formula for the total mass.

The formula for the total mass in a binary system is:

M_total = (v1 + v2) * (P/(2π)) * (some factor involving G and constants).

Wait, perhaps using Kepler's third law in the form:

M_total = (4 π² a^3) / (G P² )

But a is the separation, which is a1 + a2 = a.

From the center of mass condition: a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) a, a2=(M1/(M1+M2)) a.

The velocities are v1 = 2 π a1 / P, v2=2 π a2 / P.

So,

v1 = 2 π ( (M2 a) / (M_total P) )

Similarly,

v2 = 2 π ( (M1 a)/( M_total P ) )

So,

v1 = (2 π a M2 )/( M_total P )

v2 = (2 π a M1 )/( M_total P )

Adding v1 and v2:

v1 + v2 = 2 π a (M1 + M2 ) / ( M_total P )

But M1 + M2 = M_total, so:

v1 + v2 = 2 π a / P.

But from Kepler's third law,

M_total = (4 π² a^3)/( G P² )

So,

a^3 = ( G P² M_total )/(4 π² )

a = [ ( G P² M_total )/(4 π² ) ]^(1/3 )

Substituting back into v1 + v2:

v1 + v2 = 2 π [ ( G P² M_total/(4 π² ) )^(1/3 ) ] / P

= 2 π [ G P² M_total/(4 π² ) )^(1/3 ) ] / P

This seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to find the ratio of M_total for system_1 to system_2.

Let me denote system_1's M_total as M1, system_2's as M2.

For system_1:

v1 =10, v2=5, P1=2.

v1 + v2 =15.

For system_2:

v1=15, v2=10, P2=1.

v1 +v2=25.

But how to relate this to the masses.

Wait, from the velocity and period, perhaps the sum of the velocities can be used in some way.

Alternatively, considering that each system's M_total is proportional to (v1 + v2) * (P) / something.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere.

Alternatively, since I have M1_total and M2_total as 2.835 and6.565 respectively, the ratio is ~0.43.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A) ~0.4, but perhaps the exact calculation would be more precise.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact values without approximations.

Compute M1_total:

M_total1 =1.5 * M2a.

Wait, no, earlier we have:

For system_1:

f1 = (K1^3 P1 ) / (241 π² ) = (10^3 * 2 )/(241 * π² )

=2000/(241 *9.8696044 )

Compute denominator: 241 *9.8696044.

Calculate 241 *9 =2169, 241 *0.8696044≈241 *0.87≈209.07. Total≈2169+209.07=2378.07.

So,

f1=2000 /2378.07≈0.841.

Then, f1 = M2/(2.25 )

So,

M2=0.841 *2.25 =1.89225.

M_total1=1.5 *1.89225=2.838375.

Similarly, system_2:

f2a= (15^3 *1 )/(241 * π² )=3375/(241 *9.8696 )

=3375/2378.07≈1.418.

f2a= ( (3/5 M_total2 )^3 ) / (M_total2 )^2 )= ( (27/125 M_total2^3 ) ) / ( M_total2^2 ) )= (27/125 ) M_total2.

So,

27/125 M_total2=1.418 → M_total2= (1.418 *125 )/27.

1.418 *125 =177.25.

177.25 /27 ≈6.565.

Thus,

M1_total=2.838, M2_total=6.565.

So,

M1/M2=2.838/6.565≈0.432.

So the factor is approximately 0.43.

Looking at the options, option A is ~0.4, and option D is ~0.7.

0.43 is closer to 0.4 than to 0.7.

But wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass functions.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the velocity of the other star in system_2.

In system_2, using star2's velocity (10 km/s):

f2b = (10^3 *1 ) / (241 * π² )=1000/2378.07≈0.420.

f2b = (M1a^3 )/( (M_total2 )^2 )

M1a= (10/15) M2a= (2/3) M2a.

But M2a= (3/5) M_total2.

So,

M1a= (2/3)(3/5 M_total2 )= (2/5) M_total2.

So,

f2b= ( (2/5 M_total2 )^3 ) / ( (M_total2 )^2 )

= (8/125 M_total2^3 ) / (M_total2^2 )

=8/(125) M_total2.

Set equal to 0.420:

(8/125) M_total2 =0.420 → M_total2= (0.420 *125 )/8= (52.5)/8=6.5625.

Same as before.

So, M_total2=6.5625.

Thus, the ratio remains approximately 2.838/6.5625≈0.432.

So the factor is approximately 0.43, which is closest to option A (0.4) or perhaps D (0.7). But 0.43 is closer to 0.4, so the answer should be option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is ~0.7. Hmm, perhaps there is another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the velocity amplitudes and the periods, without considering the mass function.

The formula for the total mass in a binary system is given by:

M_total = ( (v1 + v2 )^3 P )/( 241.3 * π² )

Wait, is that correct? I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think again. The mass function is f = (K^3 P )/(241.3 * π² )

But f = (M2^3 sin^3 i )/( (M1 + M2 )^2 )

But without knowing M2, it's hard to proceed. Unless I take the ratio of the two f's.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the ratio of the mass functions for the two systems.

For system_1:

f1 = (10^3 * 2 )/(241 * π² )=2000/2378≈0.841.

For system_2:

f2 = (15^3 *1 )/(241 * π² )=3375/2378≈1.418.

So the ratio f1/f2=0.841/1.418≈0.593.

But f1/f2= [ (M2a^3 )/(M_total1^2 ) ] / [ (M2b^3 )/(M_total2^2 ) ]

Where M2a is the mass of the companion in system_1, and M2b is the mass of the companion in system_2.

But this doesn't directly give the ratio of M_total1 and M_total2, unless I have more information about the individual masses.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should approach the problem differently. Let's think about the mass function for each system.

The mass function for system_1 is f1 = (10^3 *2 )/(241 * π² )≈0.841.

Similarly, for system_2, using the 15 km/s star, f2 = (15^3 *1 )/(241 * π² )≈1.418.

The mass function is f = (M2^3 sin^3 i )/( (M1 + M2 )^2 )

Assuming sin i=1 for both systems.

So for system_1, f1 = M2a^3 / ( (M1a + M2a )^2 )

And for system_2, f2= M2b^3 / ( (M1b + M2b )^2 )

But without knowing M1a, M2a, etc., it's difficult to proceed.

Wait, but in system_1, the velocities are 10 and5, so the mass ratio is M1a/M2a =5/10=0.5.

So, M1a=0.5 M2a.

Total mass M_total1=1.5 M2a.

Thus, f1= M2a^3 / ( (1.5 M2a )^2 )= M2a/(2.25 )

So,

M2a= f1 *2.25 =0.841 *2.25=1.892.

M_total1=1.5 *1.892=2.838.

Similarly, for system_2:

Velocities are15 and10, so mass ratio M1b/M2b=10/15=2/3.

So, M1b= (2/3) M2b.

Total mass M_total2= (5/3) M2b.

f2= M2b^3 / ( ( (5/3 M2b ) )^2 )= M2b^3/( (25/9) M2b^2 )= (9/25) M2b.

Set f2=1.418= (9/25) M2b → M2b=1.418*(25/9 )= (35.45)/9≈3.939.

Then, M_total2= (5/3)*3.939≈6.565.

So, same result as before.

Thus, ratio M_total1/M_total2=2.838/6.565≈0.432.

Which is approximately 0.43. The options are A) ~0.4, D) ~0.7.

So the answer should be closest to option A.


To determine how much more massive system_1 is compared to system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationships between radial velocity (RV) amplitudes, periods, and total masses in binary systems. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Radial Velocity and Mass Ratio**:  
   In a binary system, the masses of the two stars are inversely proportional to their radial velocity amplitudes. For system_1, the RV amplitudes are 10 km/s and 5 km/s, giving a mass ratio of \( M_1/M_2 = 5/10 = 1/2 \). For system_2, the RV amplitudes are 15 km/s and 10 km/s, giving a mass ratio of \( M_1/M_2 = 10/15 = 2/3 \).

2. **Total Mass of Each System**:  
   The total mass of a binary system is the sum of the masses of its two stars.  
   - For system_1:  
     Let the masses of the two stars be \( M_{1a} \) and \( M_{1b} \), where \( M_{1a}/M_{1b} = 1/2 \). Thus, \( M_{1a} = 0.5 M_{1b} \), and the total mass is:  
     \[
     M_{\text{total,1}} = M_{1a} + M_{1b} = 0.5 M_{1b} + M_{1b} = 1.5 M_{1b}.
     \]
   - For system_2:  
     Let the masses of the two stars be \( M_{2a} \) and \( M_{2b} \), where \( M_{2a}/M_{2b} = 2/3 \). Thus, \( M_{2a} = (2/3) M_{2b} \), and the total mass is:  
     \[
     M_{\text{total,2}} = M_{2a} + M_{2b} = (2/3) M_{2b} + M_{2b} = (5/3) M_{2b}.
     \]

3. **Mass Function and Total Mass**:  
   The mass function relates the RV amplitude, period, and total mass. Using the formula:  
   \[
   f(M) = \frac{K^3 P}{241 \pi^2},
   \]  
   where \( K \) is the RV amplitude and \( P \) is the orbital period, we compute the mass function for each system. Assuming \( \sin i = 1 \) (eclipsing systems), the mass function simplifies to:  
   \[
   f(M) = \frac{M_{\text{companion}}^3}{(M_{\text{total}})^2}.
   \]  
   - For system_1:  
     Using \( K = 10 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( P = 2 \, \text{years} \):  
     \[
     f_1 = \frac{10^3 \cdot 2}{241 \cdot \pi^2} \approx 0.841.
     \]  
     Substituting into \( f_1 = \frac{M_{1b}^3}{(M_{\text{total,1}})^2} \):  
     \[
     0.841 = \frac{M_{1b}^3}{(1.5 M_{1b})^2}.
     \]  
     Solving gives \( M_{1b} \approx 1.89 \), and \( M_{\text{total,1}} = 1.5 M_{1b} \approx 2.838 \).  
   - For system_2:  
     Using \( K = 15 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( P = 1 \, \text{year} \):  
     \[
     f_2 = \frac{15^3 \cdot 1}{241 \cdot \pi^2} \approx 1.418.
     \]  
     Substituting into \( f_2 = \frac{M_{2b}^3}{(M_{\text{total,2}})^2} \):  
     \[
     1.418 = \frac{M_{2b}^3}{(1.5 M_{2b})^2}.
     \]  
     Solving gives \( M_{2b} \approx 3.939 \), and \( M_{\text{total,2}} = 1.5 M_{2b} \approx 6.565 \).

4. **Mass Ratio**:  
   The total masses of the systems are \( M_{\text{total,1}} \approx 2.838 \) and \( M_{\text{total,2}} \approx 6.565 \). The ratio of their masses is:  
   \[
   \frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{2.838}{6.565} \approx 0.432.
   \]  
   This means system_1 is approximately 0.43 times as massive as system_2.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   Among the given options, the closest value to 0.43 is **A) ~0.4**.
