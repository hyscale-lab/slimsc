Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a particle moving in two dimensions with a specific potential. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. 

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ. Wait, that's expressed in polar coordinates, right? So the potential depends on r and θ.

I remember that in two-dimensional quantum mechanics, especially when dealing with central potentials, it's useful to separate the variables into radial and angular parts. But wait, does that apply here? Because if the potential has a term that depends on cos²θ, that breaks the spherical symmetry. So it's not a spherically symmetric potential anymore, but maybe it's still separable.

Let me write down the potential again: V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I can factor out the r², so it becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, that's interesting. So the potential has a part that's purely radial and another that's angular-dependent.

I think I should try to separate the Schrödinger equation for this potential. The time-independent Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates is:

[- (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r ∂/∂r (r ∂ψ/∂r) ) + (ħ²/(2m r²)) ∂²ψ/∂θ²) ] + V(r,θ) ψ = E ψ.

Substituting V(r,θ):

= [ - (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r ∂/∂r (r ∂ψ/∂r) ) + (ħ²/(2m r²)) ∂²ψ/∂θ²) ] + ( (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ ) ψ = E ψ.

Hmm, can I separate this equation into functions of r and θ? Let me see. Let's rearrange terms:

The equation would be:

[ - (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r d/dr)) + (ħ²/(2m) ) (d²/dθ²) ) + (1/2 k r² + 3/2 k r² cos²θ) ] ψ = E ψ.

Let me group the terms. The 1/2 k r² is purely radial, and the 3/2 k r² cos²θ is angular-dependent.

Wait, maybe I can write this as:

[ - (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r d/dr) ) + (1/2 k r²) ] ψ(r) + [ (ħ²/(2m r²) d²/dθ²) + (3/2 k r² cos²θ) ] ψ(θ) ] = E ψ.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe I can consider this potential as a sum of two parts: a purely radial part (1/2 k r²) and a part that varies with cos²θ multiplied by r². 

Wait, maybe I should consider that the potential can be written as (k r²/2) [1 + 3 cos²θ]. So the angular part is [1 +3 cos²θ], which can be expressed in terms of cos(2θ), perhaps. Because cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. Let me compute that:

3 cos²θ = 3*(1 + cos 2θ)/2 = 3/2 (1 + cos 2θ). So the entire V becomes:

V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) [1 + 3 cos²θ] = (k r²/2) [1 + 3*(1 + cos 2θ)/2 ].

Wait, compute inside the brackets:

1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ) = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ = (2/2 + 3/2) + (3/2) cos2θ = (5/2) + (3/2) cos2θ.

So V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ].

Hmm, so the potential now has a term proportional to cos(2θ). That suggests that the angular part of the potential depends on cos(2θ), which is a higher harmonic. So perhaps the wavefunction can be expressed in terms of associated Legendre polynomials or spherical harmonics with l=2 or something like that.

Wait, but wait, in two dimensions, the angular part is typically solved using functions related to e^{i m θ}, where m is an integer. But in 2D, the orbital angular momentum is quantized as m ħ. Since the potential depends on cos2θ, which is cos(2θ), perhaps the angular part of the wavefunction must have a component that can couple with this term.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to separate the variables into r and θ. Let me try to write the Schrödinger equation in a way that allows me to separate terms.

The equation is:

[- (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r d/dr)) + (ħ²/(2m r²)) d²/dθ² ) + ( (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ ) ] ψ(r,θ) = E ψ(r,θ).

Let me rearrange terms to group the r and θ parts. Let's see:

The terms involving r are:

- (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r d/dr)) ψ(r,θ) + (1/2 k r² ) ψ(r,θ) + (3/2 k r² cos²θ ) ψ(r,θ) 

Wait, but ψ(r,θ) is a product of functions R(r) and Θ(θ), I suppose. So let's assume ψ(r,θ) = R(r) Θ(θ).

Substituting that into the equation:

- (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r dR/dr) ) R Θ + (ħ²/(2m r²)) (d²Θ/dθ²) R Θ + [ (1/2 k r² ) + (3/2 k r² cos²θ ) ] R Θ = E R Θ.

I can divide both sides by R Θ, giving:

- (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r dR/dr) ) / R + (ħ²/(2m r²)) (d²Θ/dθ²)/Θ + [ (1/2 k r² ) + (3/2 k r² cos²θ ) ] = E.

Hmm, but wait, the [1/2 k r² ] and [3/2 k r² cos²θ ] both have R² Θ terms. So perhaps I can factor this into terms involving R and Θ separately.

Let me rearrange the equation to bring terms involving R and Θ to separate sides. Let's move the terms:

[ - (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r dR/dr) ) / R ] + (1/2 k r² ) + [ (ħ²/(2m r²)) (d²Θ/dθ²)/Θ + (3/2 k r² cos²θ ) ] = E.

Hmm, but this seems a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider splitting the potential into parts. Wait, perhaps the term (1/2)k r² is like a harmonic oscillator potential in r, and the other term, (3/2 k r² cos²θ ), can be treated as a perturbation. But I'm not sure if it's a small term or not. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed in a way that allows for separation of variables.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the potential V(r,θ) = (k r²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Let me think about this in terms of a product of functions. Let me see, perhaps we can write this as (k r²/2)(A + B cosθ + C cos²θ), but I'm not sure if that helps for separation.

Wait, maybe it's better to write the potential as V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) [1 + 3 cos²θ ] = (k r²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Let me think about this as a sum of two terms: V(r,θ) = V0(r) + V1(r,θ), where V0 = (1/2)k r², and V1 = (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Then the total potential is the sum of these two. So perhaps the Schrödinger equation can be written as:

[ - (ħ²/(2m)) ( ... ) + V0 + V1 ] ψ = E ψ.

But I'm not sure how that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire potential as (k r²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ) and see if it can be written as a sum of functions that can be factored. 

Wait, another thought: The term cos²θ can be expressed as (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) [1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 ] = (k r²/2) [ (2 + 3 + 3 cos2θ ) / 2 ] = (k r²/2) * (5 + 3 cos2θ)/2 = (k r² (5 + 3 cos2θ)) /4.

So V(r,θ) = (k r² /4) (5 + 3 cos2θ).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Let me think about the angular part. The term involving cos2θ suggests that the angular part of the potential depends on cos2θ, so the wavefunction might have angular momentum quantum numbers that are even. But wait, perhaps I should consider the angular part equation.

If I can separate the Schrödinger equation into radial and angular parts, that would be helpful. Let me try to rearrange the equation so that the radial terms and angular terms are on opposite sides.

So, starting from the equation:

- (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r dR/dr) ) R Θ / R Θ + (ħ²/(2m r²)) d²Θ/dθ² / Θ + (k r²/2) (5 + 3 cos2θ)/4 = E.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting myself confused. Let me approach this more carefully.

Let me reorganize the Schrödinger equation. The equation is:

[ - (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r d/dr) ) + (ħ²/(2m) ) (1/r² d²/dθ² ) + V(r,θ) ] ψ = E ψ.

Substituting ψ(r,θ) = R(r) Θ(θ), the equation becomes:

- (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r) (d/dr)(r dR/dr) R Θ + (ħ²/(2m r²)) (d²Θ/dθ²) R Θ + [ (1/2) k r² + (3/2 k r² cos²θ) ] R Θ = E R Θ.

Dividing both sides by R Θ gives:

- (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r) (d/dr)(r dR/dr) / R + (ħ²/(2m r²)) (d²Θ/dθ²)/Θ + [ (1/2)k r² + (3/2 k r² cos²θ) ] = E.

Wait, but the [1/2 k r²] is only a function of r, while the [3/2 k r^2 cos^2 theta] is a function of both r and theta. Hmm, that complicates things because it's not purely a function of one variable. So perhaps separation of variables isn't straightforward here. Maybe I need to find a clever way to rewrite the potential.

Another thought: Maybe the potential can be rewritten in terms of a shifted radial variable and some angular function. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a different coordinate system, like elliptic coordinates or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the cos2θ term suggests that the angular part has a certain symmetry, leading to specific angular momentum quantum numbers. Let me recall that for central potentials, the angular part is handled by spherical harmonics, which have quantum numbers l and m. The energy levels depend on l, but in this case, the potential is not spherically symmetric. So maybe the solution isn't as straightforward as the hydrogen atom or harmonic oscillator.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a radial equation with an effective potential that includes both r and theta. Alternatively, maybe the potential allows for separation in terms of r and a function of theta that includes cos2θ.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the substitution u = r², but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the potential as V(r,θ) = (k/2) r² [1 + 3 cos²θ], and notice that [1 +3 cos²θ] = 1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = (2 +3 +3 cos2θ)/2 = (5 +3 cos2θ)/2. So, V(r,θ) = (k/2) r² * (5 +3 cos2θ)/2 = (k r² (5 +3 cos2θ))/4.

Hmm, so V(r,θ) = (5k r²)/(4) + (3k r² cos2θ)/4.

Wait, the second term is (3k r² cos2θ)/4. So the potential has a term that varies with cos2θ.

Now, perhaps the angular part of the wavefunction should involve cos2θ, or perhaps a combination of functions that match the potential's angular dependence.

If I think of the angular part, the equation becomes:

(ħ²/(2m r²)) (d²Θ/dθ²) + (3k r² cos2θ)/4 Θ = [E - (k r²/2)(5/4 + 3 cos2θ/4) ] R Θ.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the angular equation in terms of separation. Let me try to arrange the equation so that the radial and angular terms are on separate sides.

Hmm, maybe I can reorganize the equation such that the terms involving R and Θ are grouped together. Let me try:

[ - (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r dR/dr) ) / R ] + [ (ħ²/(2m r²) ) (d²Θ/dθ²)/Θ + (3k r² cos2θ)/4 ] = E - (k r²/2)(5/4 +3 cos2θ/4) ) * (1/R Θ) ?

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should consider that this potential resembles a 2D harmonic oscillator with an additional angular component. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be written in terms of a shifted radial coordinate and a shifted angular coordinate.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider polar coordinates (r,θ), and think about whether the potential can be expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because sometimes, problems are easier in Cartesian coordinates, especially when the potential has terms like x², y², etc.

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r, sinθ = y/r. So cos²θ = x²/r². So the potential can be written as:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x²/r²) ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

So V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Hmm, wait, that's interesting. So the potential is actually a sum of two terms: a radial term and a term proportional to x squared. So in Cartesian coordinates, this would be a harmonic oscillator in x and another in r, perhaps.

Wait, but r² = x² + y². So substituting that into the potential:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y²) + (3/2 k x²) ) = ( (1/2 + 3/2) k x² ) + (1/2 k y² ) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Oh! So the potential is actually a sum of two quadratic terms in x and y. Wait, but in 2D, that's a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y directions.

Wait, let me compute that again. The potential in Cartesian coordinates is:

(1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = [1/2 k x² + 3/2 k x²] + (1/2 k y²) = (2k x²) + (1/2 k y²).

So V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2 k y²).

Wait, that's a harmonic oscillator in x with frequency sqrt(2k/m), and in y with frequency sqrt(k/(2m)). Because the standard harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2) m ω² x², so the potential here is 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x², where ω_x² = (4k)/m. So ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m). Similarly, for y, 1/2 k y² is (1/2) m ω_y² y², so ω_y² = k/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

Wait, but wait, the potential I have is V = 2k x² + (k/2) y². So in x direction, the potential is (1/2) m ω_x² x², so ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). And in y direction, (1/2) m ω_y² y² = (1/2) k y² → ω_y² = (k)/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So the particle is in a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y directions. Therefore, the energy levels would be the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction, multiplied by their respective ω terms.

Wait, no. Wait, in 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies, the energy is given by E = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2 ) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2 ), where n_x and n_y are the quantum numbers for each direction, integers ≥0.

So in this case,

E = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2 ) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2 )

Substituting ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m ), ω_y = sqrt(k/m ):

E = ħ (2 sqrt(k/m )) (n_x + 1/2 ) + ħ (sqrt(k/m )) (n_y + 1/2 )

= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2 (n_x + 1/2 ) + (n_y + 1/2 ) ]

= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ]

= ħ sqrt(k/m) ( 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Hmm, looking at the options, option C says E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). Which matches what I derived.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option C: E = (2n_x +n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m)

Yes, that's exactly what I have. So the correct answer should be option C.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential given by \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). The goal is to determine the energy spectrum.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**:  
   The potential is expressed in polar coordinates, but it is more convenient to rewrite it in Cartesian coordinates using \( x = r \cos\theta \) and \( y = r \sin\theta \). Substituting \( \cos^2\theta = \frac{x^2}{r^2} \), the potential becomes:  
   \[
   V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
   \]  
   Expanding \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), the potential simplifies to:  
   \[
   V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
   \]  
   This represents a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions.

2. **Energy Levels in a 2D Harmonic Oscillator**:  
   For a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies, the energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E = \hbar \omega_x (n_x + \frac{1}{2}) + \hbar \omega_y (n_y + \frac{1}{2}),
   \]  
   where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers (quantum numbers), and \( \omega_x \) and \( \omega_y \) are the angular frequencies in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions, respectively.

3. **Frequencies**:  
   From the potential \( V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \), the frequencies are determined as:  
   \[
   \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}, \quad \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

4. **Substituting Frequencies into Energy**:  
   Substituting \( \omega_x \) and \( \omega_y \) into the energy formula:  
   \[
   E = \hbar \cdot 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \cdot (n_x + \frac{1}{2}) + \hbar \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \cdot (n_y + \frac{1}{2}).
   \]  
   Factoring out \( \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \):  
   \[
   E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left( 2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2} \right).
   \]

5. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived energy expression with the given options, it matches **Option C**:  
   \[
   E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}) \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The energy spectrum for the given potential is correctly described by **Option C**.

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a particle moving in two dimensions with a specific potential. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. 

The potential is given as V(r, θ) = (1/2) k r² + (3/2) k r² cos²θ. Wait, that's expressed in polar coordinates, right? So the potential depends on r and θ.

I remember that in two-dimensional quantum mechanics, especially when dealing with central potentials, it's useful to separate the variables into radial and angular parts. But wait, does that apply here? Because if the potential has a term that depends on cos²θ, that breaks the spherical symmetry. So it's not a spherically symmetric potential anymore, but maybe it's still separable.

Let me write down the potential again: V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ. I can factor out the r², so it becomes V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² [1 + 3 cos²θ]. Hmm, that's interesting. So the potential has a part that's purely radial and another that's angular-dependent.

I think I should try to separate the Schrödinger equation for this potential. The time-independent Schrödinger equation in polar coordinates is:

[- (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r ∂/∂r (r ∂ψ/∂r) ) + (ħ²/(2m r²)) ∂²ψ/∂θ²) ] + V(r,θ) ψ = E ψ.

Substituting V(r,θ):

= [ - (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r ∂/∂r (r ∂ψ/∂r) ) + (ħ²/(2m r²)) ∂²ψ/∂θ²) ] + ( (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ ) ψ = E ψ.

Hmm, can I separate this equation into functions of r and θ? Let me see. Let's rearrange terms:

The equation would be:

[ - (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r d/dr)) + (ħ²/(2m) ) (d²/dθ²) ) + (1/2 k r² + 3/2 k r² cos²θ) ] ψ = E ψ.

Let me group the terms. The 1/2 k r² is purely radial, and the 3/2 k r² cos²θ is angular-dependent.

Wait, maybe I can write this as:

[ - (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r d/dr) ) + (1/2 k r²) ] ψ(r) + [ (ħ²/(2m r²) d²/dθ²) + (3/2 k r² cos²θ) ] ψ(θ) ] = E ψ.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe I can consider this potential as a sum of two parts: a purely radial part (1/2 k r²) and a part that varies with cos²θ multiplied by r². 

Wait, maybe I should consider that the potential can be written as (k r²/2) [1 + 3 cos²θ]. So the angular part is [1 +3 cos²θ], which can be expressed in terms of cos(2θ), perhaps. Because cos²θ = (1 + cos 2θ)/2. Let me compute that:

3 cos²θ = 3*(1 + cos 2θ)/2 = 3/2 (1 + cos 2θ). So the entire V becomes:

V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) [1 + 3 cos²θ] = (k r²/2) [1 + 3*(1 + cos 2θ)/2 ].

Wait, compute inside the brackets:

1 + (3/2)(1 + cos2θ) = 1 + 3/2 + (3/2) cos2θ = (2/2 + 3/2) + (3/2) cos2θ = (5/2) + (3/2) cos2θ.

So V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) [5/2 + (3/2) cos2θ ].

Hmm, so the potential now has a term proportional to cos(2θ). That suggests that the angular part of the potential depends on cos(2θ), which is a higher harmonic. So perhaps the wavefunction can be expressed in terms of associated Legendre polynomials or spherical harmonics with l=2 or something like that.

Wait, but wait, in two dimensions, the angular part is typically solved using functions related to e^{i m θ}, where m is an integer. But in 2D, the orbital angular momentum is quantized as m ħ. Since the potential depends on cos2θ, which is cos(2θ), perhaps the angular part of the wavefunction must have a component that can couple with this term.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to separate the variables into r and θ. Let me try to write the Schrödinger equation in a way that allows me to separate terms.

The equation is:

[- (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r d/dr)) + (ħ²/(2m r²)) d²/dθ² ) + ( (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² cos²θ ) ] ψ(r,θ) = E ψ(r,θ).

Let me rearrange terms to group the r and θ parts. Let's see:

The terms involving r are:

- (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r d/dr)) ψ(r,θ) + (1/2 k r² ) ψ(r,θ) + (3/2 k r² cos²θ ) ψ(r,θ) 

Wait, but ψ(r,θ) is a product of functions R(r) and Θ(θ), I suppose. So let's assume ψ(r,θ) = R(r) Θ(θ).

Substituting that into the equation:

- (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r dR/dr) ) R Θ + (ħ²/(2m r²)) (d²Θ/dθ²) R Θ + [ (1/2 k r² ) + (3/2 k r² cos²θ ) ] R Θ = E R Θ.

I can divide both sides by R Θ, giving:

- (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r dR/dr) ) / R + (ħ²/(2m r²)) (d²Θ/dθ²)/Θ + [ (1/2 k r² ) + (3/2 k r² cos²θ ) ] = E.

Hmm, but wait, the [1/2 k r² ] and [3/2 k r² cos²θ ] both have R² Θ terms. So perhaps I can factor this into terms involving R and Θ separately.

Let me rearrange the equation to bring terms involving R and Θ to separate sides. Let's move the terms:

[ - (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r dR/dr) ) / R ] + (1/2 k r² ) + [ (ħ²/(2m r²)) (d²Θ/dθ²)/Θ + (3/2 k r² cos²θ ) ] = E.

Hmm, but this seems a bit messy. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider splitting the potential into parts. Wait, perhaps the term (1/2)k r² is like a harmonic oscillator potential in r, and the other term, (3/2 k r² cos²θ ), can be treated as a perturbation. But I'm not sure if it's a small term or not. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be expressed in a way that allows for separation of variables.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider the potential V(r,θ) = (k r²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Let me think about this in terms of a product of functions. Let me see, perhaps we can write this as (k r²/2)(A + B cosθ + C cos²θ), but I'm not sure if that helps for separation.

Wait, maybe it's better to write the potential as V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) [1 + 3 cos²θ ] = (k r²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ). Let me think about this as a sum of two terms: V(r,θ) = V0(r) + V1(r,θ), where V0 = (1/2)k r², and V1 = (3/2)k r² cos²θ.

Then the total potential is the sum of these two. So perhaps the Schrödinger equation can be written as:

[ - (ħ²/(2m)) ( ... ) + V0 + V1 ] ψ = E ψ.

But I'm not sure how that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can think of the entire potential as (k r²/2)(1 + 3 cos²θ) and see if it can be written as a sum of functions that can be factored. 

Wait, another thought: The term cos²θ can be expressed as (1 + cos 2θ)/2. So substituting that in, the potential becomes:

V(r,θ) = (k r²/2) [1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 ] = (k r²/2) [ (2 + 3 + 3 cos2θ ) / 2 ] = (k r²/2) * (5 + 3 cos2θ)/2 = (k r² (5 + 3 cos2θ)) /4.

So V(r,θ) = (k r² /4) (5 + 3 cos2θ).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Let me think about the angular part. The term involving cos2θ suggests that the angular part of the potential depends on cos2θ, so the wavefunction might have angular momentum quantum numbers that are even. But wait, perhaps I should consider the angular part equation.

If I can separate the Schrödinger equation into radial and angular parts, that would be helpful. Let me try to rearrange the equation so that the radial terms and angular terms are on opposite sides.

So, starting from the equation:

- (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r dR/dr) ) R Θ / R Θ + (ħ²/(2m r²)) d²Θ/dθ² / Θ + (k r²/2) (5 + 3 cos2θ)/4 = E.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting myself confused. Let me approach this more carefully.

Let me reorganize the Schrödinger equation. The equation is:

[ - (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r d/dr) ) + (ħ²/(2m) ) (1/r² d²/dθ² ) + V(r,θ) ] ψ = E ψ.

Substituting ψ(r,θ) = R(r) Θ(θ), the equation becomes:

- (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r) (d/dr)(r dR/dr) R Θ + (ħ²/(2m r²)) (d²Θ/dθ²) R Θ + [ (1/2) k r² + (3/2 k r² cos²θ) ] R Θ = E R Θ.

Dividing both sides by R Θ gives:

- (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r) (d/dr)(r dR/dr) / R + (ħ²/(2m r²)) (d²Θ/dθ²)/Θ + [ (1/2)k r² + (3/2 k r² cos²θ) ] = E.

Wait, but the [1/2 k r²] is only a function of r, while the [3/2 k r^2 cos^2 theta] is a function of both r and theta. Hmm, that complicates things because it's not purely a function of one variable. So perhaps separation of variables isn't straightforward here. Maybe I need to find a clever way to rewrite the potential.

Another thought: Maybe the potential can be rewritten in terms of a shifted radial variable and some angular function. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a different coordinate system, like elliptic coordinates or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the cos2θ term suggests that the angular part has a certain symmetry, leading to specific angular momentum quantum numbers. Let me recall that for central potentials, the angular part is handled by spherical harmonics, which have quantum numbers l and m. The energy levels depend on l, but in this case, the potential is not spherically symmetric. So maybe the solution isn't as straightforward as the hydrogen atom or harmonic oscillator.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into a radial equation with an effective potential that includes both r and theta. Alternatively, maybe the potential allows for separation in terms of r and a function of theta that includes cos2θ.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the substitution u = r², but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the potential as V(r,θ) = (k/2) r² [1 + 3 cos²θ], and notice that [1 +3 cos²θ] = 1 + 3*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = (2 +3 +3 cos2θ)/2 = (5 +3 cos2θ)/2. So, V(r,θ) = (k/2) r² * (5 +3 cos2θ)/2 = (k r² (5 +3 cos2θ))/4.

Hmm, so V(r,θ) = (5k r²)/(4) + (3k r² cos2θ)/4.

Wait, the second term is (3k r² cos2θ)/4. So the potential has a term that varies with cos2θ.

Now, perhaps the angular part of the wavefunction should involve cos2θ, or perhaps a combination of functions that match the potential's angular dependence.

If I think of the angular part, the equation becomes:

(ħ²/(2m r²)) (d²Θ/dθ²) + (3k r² cos2θ)/4 Θ = [E - (k r²/2)(5/4 + 3 cos2θ/4) ] R Θ.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the angular equation in terms of separation. Let me try to arrange the equation so that the radial and angular terms are on separate sides.

Hmm, maybe I can reorganize the equation such that the terms involving R and Θ are grouped together. Let me try:

[ - (ħ²/(2m)) (1/r d/dr (r dR/dr) ) / R ] + [ (ħ²/(2m r²) ) (d²Θ/dθ²)/Θ + (3k r² cos2θ)/4 ] = E - (k r²/2)(5/4 +3 cos2θ/4) ) * (1/R Θ) ?

Wait, I'm not getting anywhere. Maybe I should consider that this potential resembles a 2D harmonic oscillator with an additional angular component. Alternatively, perhaps the potential can be written in terms of a shifted radial coordinate and a shifted angular coordinate.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider polar coordinates (r,θ), and think about whether the potential can be expressed in terms of Cartesian coordinates. Because sometimes, problems are easier in Cartesian coordinates, especially when the potential has terms like x², y², etc.

In polar coordinates, x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So cosθ = x/r, sinθ = y/r. So cos²θ = x²/r². So the potential can be written as:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k r² (x²/r²) ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x².

So V(r,θ) = (1/2)k r² + (3/2)k x². Hmm, wait, that's interesting. So the potential is actually a sum of two terms: a radial term and a term proportional to x squared. So in Cartesian coordinates, this would be a harmonic oscillator in x and another in r, perhaps.

Wait, but r² = x² + y². So substituting that into the potential:

V(r,θ) = (1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = (1/2 k x² + 1/2 k y²) + (3/2 k x²) ) = ( (1/2 + 3/2) k x² ) + (1/2 k y² ) = 2k x² + (1/2)k y².

Oh! So the potential is actually a sum of two quadratic terms in x and y. Wait, but in 2D, that's a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y directions.

Wait, let me compute that again. The potential in Cartesian coordinates is:

(1/2)k (x² + y²) + (3/2)k x² = [1/2 k x² + 3/2 k x²] + (1/2 k y²) = (2k x²) + (1/2 k y²).

So V(x,y) = 2k x² + (1/2 k y²).

Wait, that's a harmonic oscillator in x with frequency sqrt(2k/m), and in y with frequency sqrt(k/(2m)). Because the standard harmonic oscillator potential is (1/2) m ω² x², so the potential here is 2k x² = (1/2) m ω_x² x², where ω_x² = (4k)/m. So ω_x = sqrt(4k/m) = 2 sqrt(k/m). Similarly, for y, 1/2 k y² is (1/2) m ω_y² y², so ω_y² = k/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

Wait, but wait, the potential I have is V = 2k x² + (k/2) y². So in x direction, the potential is (1/2) m ω_x² x², so ω_x² = (4k)/m → ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m). And in y direction, (1/2) m ω_y² y² = (1/2) k y² → ω_y² = (k)/m → ω_y = sqrt(k/m).

So the particle is in a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in x and y directions. Therefore, the energy levels would be the sum of the quantum numbers in each direction, multiplied by their respective ω terms.

Wait, no. Wait, in 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies, the energy is given by E = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2 ) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2 ), where n_x and n_y are the quantum numbers for each direction, integers ≥0.

So in this case,

E = ħ ω_x (n_x + 1/2 ) + ħ ω_y (n_y + 1/2 )

Substituting ω_x = 2 sqrt(k/m ), ω_y = sqrt(k/m ):

E = ħ (2 sqrt(k/m )) (n_x + 1/2 ) + ħ (sqrt(k/m )) (n_y + 1/2 )

= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2 (n_x + 1/2 ) + (n_y + 1/2 ) ]

= ħ sqrt(k/m) [ 2n_x + 1 + n_y + 1/2 ]

= ħ sqrt(k/m) ( 2n_x + n_y + 3/2 )

Hmm, looking at the options, option C says E = (2n_x + n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m). Which matches what I derived.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option C: E = (2n_x +n_y + 3/2) ℏ sqrt(k/m)

Yes, that's exactly what I have. So the correct answer should be option C.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical particle of mass \( m \) moving in a two-dimensional potential given by \( V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2(\theta) \). The goal is to determine the energy spectrum.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Potential in Cartesian Coordinates**:  
   The potential is expressed in polar coordinates, but it is more convenient to rewrite it in Cartesian coordinates using \( x = r \cos\theta \) and \( y = r \sin\theta \). Substituting \( \cos^2\theta = \frac{x^2}{r^2} \), the potential becomes:  
   \[
   V(r, \theta) = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kr^2 \cos^2\theta = \frac{1}{2}kr^2 + \frac{3}{2}kx^2.
   \]  
   Expanding \( r^2 = x^2 + y^2 \), the potential simplifies to:  
   \[
   V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2.
   \]  
   This represents a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions.

2. **Energy Levels in a 2D Harmonic Oscillator**:  
   For a 2D harmonic oscillator with different frequencies, the energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E = \hbar \omega_x (n_x + \frac{1}{2}) + \hbar \omega_y (n_y + \frac{1}{2}),
   \]  
   where \( n_x \) and \( n_y \) are non-negative integers (quantum numbers), and \( \omega_x \) and \( \omega_y \) are the angular frequencies in the \( x \)- and \( y \)-directions, respectively.

3. **Frequencies**:  
   From the potential \( V(x, y) = 2kx^2 + \frac{1}{2}ky^2 \), the frequencies are determined as:  
   \[
   \omega_x = 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}, \quad \omega_y = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

4. **Substituting Frequencies into Energy**:  
   Substituting \( \omega_x \) and \( \omega_y \) into the energy formula:  
   \[
   E = \hbar \cdot 2\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \cdot (n_x + \frac{1}{2}) + \hbar \cdot \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \cdot (n_y + \frac{1}{2}).
   \]  
   Factoring out \( \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \):  
   \[
   E = \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} \left( 2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2} \right).
   \]

5. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived energy expression with the given options, it matches **Option C**:  
   \[
   E = (2n_x + n_y + \frac{3}{2}) \hbar \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The energy spectrum for the given potential is correctly described by **Option C**.
