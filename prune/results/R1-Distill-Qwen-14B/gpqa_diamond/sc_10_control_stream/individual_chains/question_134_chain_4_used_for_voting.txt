Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. Enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when one mole of an acid reacts with one mole of a base. But wait, the question gives me three solutions. Oh, wait, no, wait. Let me read the question again.

Oh, right, it's when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. So all three are being mixed together. Hmm, I need to figure out the reaction here.

Wait, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when mixed, they'll react.

But wait, what's the stoichiometry here? Let me think. HCl is H+ and Cl- when it dissociates. H2SO4, being a diprotic acid, in strong acid conditions (like in water) would dissociate completely into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2, the base, when dissolved, Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-. So each mole gives two moles of OH-.

So the reaction would be between H+ ions from the acids and OH- ions from the base.

Wait, but both HCl and H2SO4 are acids, so their H+ will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, how much H+ is each acid contributing?

Let me calculate the moles of H+ from each acid.

First, HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, each mole gives one mole H+, so 0.1 moles H+.

Next, H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. Since each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles H+, that's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

So total H+ from both acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 moles OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

So the reaction is between H+ and OH-:

H+ + OH- → H2O

The question is, how much of each reacts? The limiting reagent determines the extent.

We have 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

OH- is the limiting reagent. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, using up 0.2 moles of H+. That leaves 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

Wait, but wait: H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. In a strong acid solution, both protons are available. So when you mix it with a base, it will donate both H+ ions.

So in this case, the total H+ is indeed 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28. That part makes sense.

So, moles of H+ available: 0.28.
Moles of OH- available: 0.2.

So all OH- will react, using up 0.2 H+.

Moles of H+ remaining: 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08. So that's more H+ than OH-.

But wait, in the reaction, each H+ from both acids can react with OH-.

So the neutralization would produce 0.2 moles of water from the reaction.

Now, the enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of H+ reacting with OH-.

Wait, but the problem is about the overall reaction. So the total enthalpy change would be based on the amount that actually reacts.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57 kJ/mol of H+ reacting. But wait, wait, I think the standard value is approximately -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized. Let me confirm.

Yes, I recall that the enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) for a strong acid and strong base is about -57.3 kJ per mole. That's because the reaction is exothermic.

So, in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ react with OH-.

So total enthalpy change would be 0.2 moles * (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) -2.72 kcal
B) -11.42 kcal
C) -3.80 kcal
D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm, so my calculation gives -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.46 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16 kJ, which is a bit higher. Option B is in kcal, around -11.42. Wait, wait, maybe I should convert kJ to kcal.

Wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So, 11.46 kJ is about how much in kcal?

Dividing 11.46 by 4.184: let's see, 4.184 * 2 = 8.368, 4.184 * 2.7 = 11.2968. So 2.7 kcal.

Wait, 11.46 /4.184 is approximately 2.736 kcal. So that would be about -2.74 kcal.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close. But wait, I thought the neutralization enthalpy was per mole of H+.

Wait, but wait a second. The other thing to consider is that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization per H+ is the same. So whether it's from HCl or H2SO4, each H+ contributes -57.3 kJ when neutralized.

So, in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ → 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.74 kcal.

Wait, but the options have option B as -11.42 kJ, but that's in kcal. Wait no, option B is in kcal. Let me see:

Wait, 11.46 kJ is about 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.736 kcal. So approximately -2.74 kcal. So the closest option would be A: -2.72 kcal.

But wait, another consideration: maybe the reaction is not just between the H+ and OH-, but also considering the salts formed. Oh wait, no, the enthalpy of neutralization refers to the reaction of acid and base to form water. So the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done in terms of the actual moles of acid and base. Let me think about that.

Wait, another approach: let's write the overall reaction.

HCl + Ba(OH)2 + H2SO4 → ?

Wait, perhaps writing out the reaction would help.

HCl is H+ Cl-.

H2SO4 is 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 is Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

So when mixed, the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So, let's see:

Total H+ = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- = 0.2 mol.

So, H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, producing 0.2 moles of water.

The remaining 0.08 moles of H+ will stay in solution, along with the SO4^2- and Cl- and Ba^2+ ions.

So the neutralization is only for 0.2 moles of H+.

Thus, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but the options have option B as -11.42 kcal, which is about 48.2 kJ (since 11.42 *4.184 ≈ 48.1 kJ). No, wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait: I'm getting confused between kJ and kcal.

Wait, 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So, 11.46 kJ is approximately 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.736 kcal, which is about -2.74 kcal. So the closest option is A: -2.72 kcal.

But wait, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is bigger than the 11.46 I calculated. So that's not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be about -48.2 kJ, which is way higher than my calculation.

Hmm, something's not right here. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of moles.

Let me recalculate the moles:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+: 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, moles of H+ reacting: 0.2. moles of OH- reacting: 0.2.

So, 0.2 moles of H+ reacting, which would release 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ. But since it's exothermic, it's -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but the options don't have -11.46 in kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that H2SO4 is a strong acid, but maybe for the second H+, the enthalpy is slightly different. Or maybe the reaction is with Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base but may form BaSO4 precipitate or something else. Wait, but that's not part of the neutralization reaction. No, the neutralization is just H+ + OH- → H2O.

Wait, but another thought: when mixing H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, perhaps a precipitation occurs. For example, Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 can react to form BaSO4, a precipitate, and water. But wait, in this case, when all three solutions are mixed, perhaps some of the H2SO4 is reacting with Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4, which is a solid, and that reaction would release heat.

Oh, right! I think I missed this part. Because H2SO4 is a strong acid, but when mixed with a strong base like Ba(OH)2, perhaps the reaction is not just neutralization but also a precipitation reaction.

Wait, so let's think again. The H2SO4 (H2SO4) and Ba(OH)2 (Ba(OH)2) can react as follows:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

This reaction would produce BaSO4 precipitate and water. But wait, let me write the balanced equation:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Yes, that's the reaction. So, each mole of H2SO4 reacts with a mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce a mole of BaSO4 and 2 moles of H2O.

In this case, I need to calculate if any of the H2SO4 is reacting with Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4, which would release heat as well.

So, let's find out how much H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are present.

H2SO4 moles: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2 moles: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol.

So, the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is 1:1.

We have 0.09 mol H2SO4 and 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent, as 0.09 is less than 0.1.

So, 0.09 mol of H2SO4 will react with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 to produce 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O.

Wait, but wait: the Ba(OH)2 is present in 0.1 mol, but only 0.09 reacts, leaving 0.01 mol Ba(OH)2 unreacted.

So, the enthalpy change from this reaction would be for 0.09 mol.

What is the enthalpy change for this reaction?

I need to find the ΔH for the reaction: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

I think the enthalpy of this reaction isn't the same as the neutralization enthalpy. The neutralization is a specific reaction, but here it's an acid-base reaction leading to precipitation.

Wait, but maybe the overall reaction can be considered as a combination of neutralization and precipitation.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate all the H+ available from all sources and all the OH- available, and see which is the limiting reagent, but considering that some H+ comes from H2SO4 reacting with Ba(OH)2.

This is getting complicated. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by considering all possible reactions:

1. The neutralization between H+ (from HCl and H2SO4) and OH- (from Ba(OH)2).

2. The precipitation reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4.

So, first, let's calculate how much of each reactant is consumed in the precipitation reaction.

As earlier, H2SO4 (0.09 mol) and Ba(OH)2 (0.1 mol) will react in a 1:1 ratio. So 0.09 mol H2SO4 reacts with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O.

So after this reaction:

H2SO4 remaining: 0.09 - 0.09 = 0 mol.

Ba(OH)2 remaining: 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 mol.

Now, the remaining H+ comes from the unreacted H2SO4 (which is 0, as all reacted) and the HCl.

HCl initially: 0.1 mol H+.

But wait, in the precipitation reaction, does any H+ get consumed?

No, because in the reaction H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O, the H2SO4 donates both H+ ions, and the Ba(OH)2 donates OH-.

Wait, actually, the reaction can be written as:

H2SO4 (2 H+) + Ba(OH)2 (2 OH-) → BaSO4 + 2 H2O (neither H+ nor OH-).

But, the reaction produces water, so perhaps the H+ and OH- from the acid and base combine to form water, but in this case, it's part of the precipitation.

Wait, perhaps the overall reaction can be considered as:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

Which is a neutralization reaction, but it's more specific because it forms a precipitate.

So, for this reaction, each mole releases a certain amount of heat. I might need to find the enthalpy change for this reaction.

But wait, I'm not given any specific ΔH values for this reaction. Hmm, so maybe I should proceed without it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that only the neutralization (H+ + OH-) is considered, and the precipitation is ignored, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to only consider the neutralization part, ignoring the precipitation. But that's unclear.

Hmm, this complicates things. Let me try to think of another approach. Maybe the problem expects me to calculate the heat released due to all the H+ reacting with OH-.

But I have to consider that some of the H2SO4 has reacted with Ba(OH)2, so the available H+ is reduced.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the H+ and OH- after any precipitation.

Wait, let's reevaluate:

H2SO4 (0.09 mol) reacts with Ba(OH)2 (0.1 mol) in a 1:1 ratio, producing 0.09 mol BaSO4 and using up 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2.

So, H2SO4 is completely consumed. Ba(OH)2 left is 0.01 mol.

So, the H+ comes from the remaining HCl and any H+ from the remaining H2SO4. But H2SO4 is all consumed, so H+ is from HCl.

HCl is 0.1 mol, which provides 0.1 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.01 mol, which provides 0.02 mol OH-.

So, now, the neutralization reaction between H+ and OH- would be:

0.02 mol OH- + 0.02 mol H+ → 0.02 mol H2O.

But wait, the available H+ is 0.1, and OH- is 0.02. So OH- is the limiting reagent. So all 0.02 mol OH- reacts with 0.02 mol H+.

So, in total, the H+ that reacts is 0.02.

So, the total enthalpy change would be 0.02 mol * (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -1.146 kJ.

That's about -2.72 kcal (since 1.146 kJ is approximately 0.274 kcal; wait, wait: 1.146 kJ = 1.146 /4.184 ≈ 0.2736 kcal. So total is -0.2736 kcal. But that seems too low, and the options have A as -2.72 kcal, which is much larger.

Hmm, something's definitely wrong with my approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- available, regardless of other reactions, and then find the limiting reagent.

Total H+ from HCl and H2SO4: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2.

So, OH- is limiting. So 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH- react, making 0.2 H2O.

The enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

But wait, the problem is that some of the H2SO4 might have reacted with Ba(OH)2, so the H+ available from H2SO4 may have been used in that reaction, not in neutralization. So perhaps the initial H+ is 0.28, but some of it is used in forming BaSO4, not in neutralization.

Alternatively, maybe the H+ from H2SO4 is all available, regardless of any precipitate.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider all H+ and OH- ions, regardless of their source, and find the limiting reagent.

So:

Total H+ from HCl: 0.1.

H+ from H2SO4: 0.18 → but wait, if some H2SO4 reacted with Ba(OH)2, then that H+ would not be available for neutralization.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to think in terms of all possible reactions.

Let me outline the possible steps:

1. Reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4 precipitate and water.

   H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

   This reaction uses up some H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, producing BaSO4 and water.

2. After this reaction, any remaining H+ (from HCl and any unreacted H2SO4) will react with remaining OH- (from Ba(OH)2) in neutralization.

So, first, calculate how much H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are consumed in the precipitation.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.09 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol.

The reaction is 1:1, so H2SO4 is the limiting reagent, as it has fewer moles. So 0.09 mol H2SO4 reacts, consuming 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2.

So after this reaction:

H2SO4: 0.09 - 0.09 = 0 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 mol.

Now, the remaining H+ comes from HCl and any unreacted H2SO4. But H2SO4 is all reacted, so H+ is only from HCl: 0.1 mol.

The remaining OH- comes from the unreacted Ba(OH)2: 0.01 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.02 mol OH-.

So, the neutralization reaction now is H+ (0.1 mol) and OH- (0.02 mol) reacting.

OH- is the limiting reagent here, so all 0.02 mol OH- reacts with 0.02 mol H+.

So, total H+ neutralized is 0.02 mol.

Enthalpy change for this: 0.02 * (-57.3) = -1.146 kJ.

But that's only part of the enthalpy change. There's also the enthalpy from the precipitation reaction.

So, I need to calculate the enthalpy change for both reactions.

Reaction 1: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Reaction 2: H+ + OH- → H2O (0.02 mol).

But without knowing the enthalpy change of Reaction 1, I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the precipitation reaction. Or maybe the problem is designed so that the precipitation doesn't happen because the concentrations or volumes are such that it's negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all H+ and OH- are available for neutralization, regardless of possible precipitations.

In that case, the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2, so 0.2 H+ reacts, releasing 0.2 *57.3 = 11.46 kJ → -11.46 kJ.

In that case, the enthalpy change is approximately -11.46 kJ.

Looking back at the options:

Option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, not matching.

Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.42 kcal is about 48.2 kJ, which is much higher than 11.46 kJ.

Wait, but perhaps the problem uses the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of H+ as -57.3 kcal/mol. No, that can't be right because 57.3 is in kJ.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the units.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+.

So, 0.2 moles → 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

So, the enthalpy change is approximately -11.46 kJ. But the options don't have this exact value.

Looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ. That's not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.3 kJ, way too high.

Wait, I'm getting confused because the options have both kcal and kJ. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the enthalpy in calories rather than kilojoules.

Wait, 1 kJ is about 239.006 kcal. No, wait, 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ. So 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal.

Wait, no, sorry, the conversion is 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So 1 kJ is 1/4.184 kcal ≈ 0.2388 kcal.

So, -11.46 kJ is equal to -11.46 * 0.2388 ≈ -2.736 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close. So the answer would be A.

But I'm not entirely confident because I'm not sure if the problem accounts for the precipitation reaction or not.

Wait, but let's recap: if I ignore the precipitation reaction (i.e., if the problem considers only the neutralization of H+ and OH-), then 0.2 moles H+ react, giving -11.46 kJ → ≈-2.74 kcal, which is close to option A.

Alternatively, if I account for the precipitation, the enthalpy change would be from both reactions:

Reaction 1: 0.09 mol H2SO4 + 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.09 mol BaSO4 + 0.18 mol H2O. Let's assume this reaction releases some heat, say, ΔH1.

Reaction 2: 0.02 mol H+ + 0.02 mol OH- → 0.02 mol H2O. ΔH2 = 0.02 * (-57.3) = -1.146 kJ.

Total ΔH = ΔH1 + ΔH2.

But without knowing ΔH1, I can't compute the exact value. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the precipitation and consider only the neutralization of the available H+ and OH-.

In that case, the answer is approximately -2.74 kcal, so option A.

But wait, option D is in kJ. Let me see if the problem expects the answer in kJ.

The options are: A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

If the correct value is -11.46 kJ, the closest option would be D: -16.0 kJ is not close. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the enthalpy per mole is wrong. Let me check: the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+.

Wait, but when dealing with strong acids and strong bases, the enthalpy per mole of H+ is indeed around -57.3 kJ. So, 0.2 mol → 11.46 kJ.

But none of the options in kJ match that. Only option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger.

Hmm, perhaps I should recheck the moles.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the moles of H+.

Wait, HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.2 M → 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 M → 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L. 0.5 M → 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 H+ reacts.

Thus, 0.2 *57.3 = 11.46 kJ.

But again, none of the options match exactly.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem states that the enthalpy of neutralization is -57.3 kcal/mol. But that's not correct, since 57.3 is in kJ.

Wait, perhaps the given options are in kcal, but the correct calculation is in kJ, then convert.

Wait, 11.46 kJ is equal to about 2.736 kcal. So approximately -2.74 kcal, which is option A.

But then why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be about 48.2 kJ, which is way higher.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the question is considering each mole of acid or base as contributing to the neutralization. For example, perhaps the calculation is based on the number of moles of H+ from each acid and the OH- from the base, and considering that each acid contributes a certain amount.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem might be designed to ignore the precipitation and just consider all the H+ and OH- available for neutralization, thus leading to 0.2 moles of H+ reacting.

So, the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.74 kcal, which matches option A.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we proceed as follows:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - HCl: \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol HCl} \), which contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol H⁺} \).
   - H₂SO₄: \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol H₂SO₄} \), which contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol H⁺} \).
   - Total \( \text{H⁺} \): \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Determine moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Ba(OH)₂: \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol Ba(OH)₂} \), which contributes \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol OH⁻} \).

3. **Identify the limiting reagent:**
   - The reaction \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \) requires 1 mole of \( \text{H⁺} \) and 1 mole of \( \text{OH⁻} \).
   - \( \text{H⁺} \) is present in excess (0.28 mol), while \( \text{OH⁻} \) is limiting (0.2 mol). Thus, 0.2 mol of \( \text{H⁺} \) reacts with 0.2 mol of \( \text{OH⁻} \).

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) of \( \text{H⁺} \).
   - For 0.2 mol of \( \text{H⁺} \), the enthalpy change is:
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]

5. **Convert to kcal (if necessary):**
   - \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.2388 \, \text{kcal} \), so:
     \[
     -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \times 0.2388 \, \text{kcal/kJ} \approx -2.74 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

6. **Compare with the options:**
   - Option A (\(-2.72 \, \text{kcal}\)) is the closest to the calculated value of \(-2.74 \, \text{kcal}\).
   - Other options (e.g., \(-11.42 \, \text{kcal}\) or \(-16.0 \, \text{kJ}\)) do not match the calculation.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that neutralization reactions involve acids and bases reacting to form water and a salt. Enthalpy of neutralization is usually the heat released when one mole of an acid reacts with one mole of a base. But wait, the question gives me three solutions. Oh, wait, no, wait. Let me read the question again.

Oh, right, it's when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. So all three are being mixed together. Hmm, I need to figure out the reaction here.

Wait, HCl is a strong acid, H2SO4 is a strong acid too, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. So when mixed, they'll react.

But wait, what's the stoichiometry here? Let me think. HCl is H+ and Cl- when it dissociates. H2SO4, being a diprotic acid, in strong acid conditions (like in water) would dissociate completely into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2, the base, when dissolved, Ba(OH)2 → Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-. So each mole gives two moles of OH-.

So the reaction would be between H+ ions from the acids and OH- ions from the base.

Wait, but both HCl and H2SO4 are acids, so their H+ will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

But wait, how much H+ is each acid contributing?

Let me calculate the moles of H+ from each acid.

First, HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 moles of HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, each mole gives one mole H+, so 0.1 moles H+.

Next, H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 moles of H2SO4. Since each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles H+, that's 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles H+.

So total H+ from both acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 moles of Ba(OH)2. Each mole gives 2 moles OH-, so 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles OH-.

So the reaction is between H+ and OH-:

H+ + OH- → H2O

The question is, how much of each reacts? The limiting reagent determines the extent.

We have 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH-.

OH- is the limiting reagent. So all 0.2 moles of OH- will react, using up 0.2 moles of H+. That leaves 0.08 moles of H+ unreacted.

Wait, but wait: H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. In a strong acid solution, both protons are available. So when you mix it with a base, it will donate both H+ ions.

So in this case, the total H+ is indeed 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28. That part makes sense.

So, moles of H+ available: 0.28.
Moles of OH- available: 0.2.

So all OH- will react, using up 0.2 H+.

Moles of H+ remaining: 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08. So that's more H+ than OH-.

But wait, in the reaction, each H+ from both acids can react with OH-.

So the neutralization would produce 0.2 moles of water from the reaction.

Now, the enthalpy of neutralization is usually given per mole of H+ reacting with OH-.

Wait, but the problem is about the overall reaction. So the total enthalpy change would be based on the amount that actually reacts.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57 kJ/mol of H+ reacting. But wait, wait, I think the standard value is approximately -57.3 kJ per mole of H+ neutralized. Let me confirm.

Yes, I recall that the enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) for a strong acid and strong base is about -57.3 kJ per mole. That's because the reaction is exothermic.

So, in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ react with OH-.

So total enthalpy change would be 0.2 moles * (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) -2.72 kcal
B) -11.42 kcal
C) -3.80 kcal
D) -16.0 kJ

Hmm, so my calculation gives -11.46 kJ, which is approximately -11.46 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16 kJ, which is a bit higher. Option B is in kcal, around -11.42. Wait, wait, maybe I should convert kJ to kcal.

Wait, 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So, 11.46 kJ is about how much in kcal?

Dividing 11.46 by 4.184: let's see, 4.184 * 2 = 8.368, 4.184 * 2.7 = 11.2968. So 2.7 kcal.

Wait, 11.46 /4.184 is approximately 2.736 kcal. So that would be about -2.74 kcal.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close. But wait, I thought the neutralization enthalpy was per mole of H+.

Wait, but wait a second. The other thing to consider is that H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, so perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization per H+ is the same. So whether it's from HCl or H2SO4, each H+ contributes -57.3 kJ when neutralized.

So, in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ → 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.74 kcal.

Wait, but the options have option B as -11.42 kJ, but that's in kcal. Wait no, option B is in kcal. Let me see:

Wait, 11.46 kJ is about 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.736 kcal. So approximately -2.74 kcal. So the closest option would be A: -2.72 kcal.

But wait, another consideration: maybe the reaction is not just between the H+ and OH-, but also considering the salts formed. Oh wait, no, the enthalpy of neutralization refers to the reaction of acid and base to form water. So the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O, which releases heat.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done in terms of the actual moles of acid and base. Let me think about that.

Wait, another approach: let's write the overall reaction.

HCl + Ba(OH)2 + H2SO4 → ?

Wait, perhaps writing out the reaction would help.

HCl is H+ Cl-.

H2SO4 is 2 H+ + SO4^2-.

Ba(OH)2 is Ba^2+ + 2 OH^-.

So when mixed, the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So, let's see:

Total H+ = 0.1 (from HCl) + 0.18 (from H2SO4) = 0.28 mol.

Total OH- = 0.2 mol.

So, H+ + OH- → H2O.

So, 0.2 moles of H+ and OH- react, producing 0.2 moles of water.

The remaining 0.08 moles of H+ will stay in solution, along with the SO4^2- and Cl- and Ba^2+ ions.

So the neutralization is only for 0.2 moles of H+.

Thus, the enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but the options have option B as -11.42 kcal, which is about 48.2 kJ (since 11.42 *4.184 ≈ 48.1 kJ). No, wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait: I'm getting confused between kJ and kcal.

Wait, 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So, 11.46 kJ is approximately 11.46 /4.184 ≈ 2.736 kcal, which is about -2.74 kcal. So the closest option is A: -2.72 kcal.

But wait, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is bigger than the 11.46 I calculated. So that's not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be about -48.2 kJ, which is way higher than my calculation.

Hmm, something's not right here. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of moles.

Let me recalculate the moles:

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Total H+: 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, moles of H+ reacting: 0.2. moles of OH- reacting: 0.2.

So, 0.2 moles of H+ reacting, which would release 0.2 * 57.3 kJ = 11.46 kJ. But since it's exothermic, it's -11.46 kJ.

Wait, but the options don't have -11.46 in kJ. Option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that H2SO4 is a strong acid, but maybe for the second H+, the enthalpy is slightly different. Or maybe the reaction is with Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base but may form BaSO4 precipitate or something else. Wait, but that's not part of the neutralization reaction. No, the neutralization is just H+ + OH- → H2O.

Wait, but another thought: when mixing H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, perhaps a precipitation occurs. For example, Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 can react to form BaSO4, a precipitate, and water. But wait, in this case, when all three solutions are mixed, perhaps some of the H2SO4 is reacting with Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4, which is a solid, and that reaction would release heat.

Oh, right! I think I missed this part. Because H2SO4 is a strong acid, but when mixed with a strong base like Ba(OH)2, perhaps the reaction is not just neutralization but also a precipitation reaction.

Wait, so let's think again. The H2SO4 (H2SO4) and Ba(OH)2 (Ba(OH)2) can react as follows:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

This reaction would produce BaSO4 precipitate and water. But wait, let me write the balanced equation:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Yes, that's the reaction. So, each mole of H2SO4 reacts with a mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce a mole of BaSO4 and 2 moles of H2O.

In this case, I need to calculate if any of the H2SO4 is reacting with Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4, which would release heat as well.

So, let's find out how much H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are present.

H2SO4 moles: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2 moles: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol.

So, the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is 1:1.

We have 0.09 mol H2SO4 and 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2. So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent, as 0.09 is less than 0.1.

So, 0.09 mol of H2SO4 will react with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 to produce 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O.

Wait, but wait: the Ba(OH)2 is present in 0.1 mol, but only 0.09 reacts, leaving 0.01 mol Ba(OH)2 unreacted.

So, the enthalpy change from this reaction would be for 0.09 mol.

What is the enthalpy change for this reaction?

I need to find the ΔH for the reaction: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

I think the enthalpy of this reaction isn't the same as the neutralization enthalpy. The neutralization is a specific reaction, but here it's an acid-base reaction leading to precipitation.

Wait, but maybe the overall reaction can be considered as a combination of neutralization and precipitation.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate all the H+ available from all sources and all the OH- available, and see which is the limiting reagent, but considering that some H+ comes from H2SO4 reacting with Ba(OH)2.

This is getting complicated. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by considering all possible reactions:

1. The neutralization between H+ (from HCl and H2SO4) and OH- (from Ba(OH)2).

2. The precipitation reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4.

So, first, let's calculate how much of each reactant is consumed in the precipitation reaction.

As earlier, H2SO4 (0.09 mol) and Ba(OH)2 (0.1 mol) will react in a 1:1 ratio. So 0.09 mol H2SO4 reacts with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2, producing 0.09 mol BaSO4 and 0.18 mol H2O.

So after this reaction:

H2SO4 remaining: 0.09 - 0.09 = 0 mol.

Ba(OH)2 remaining: 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 mol.

Now, the remaining H+ comes from the unreacted H2SO4 (which is 0, as all reacted) and the HCl.

HCl initially: 0.1 mol H+.

But wait, in the precipitation reaction, does any H+ get consumed?

No, because in the reaction H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O, the H2SO4 donates both H+ ions, and the Ba(OH)2 donates OH-.

Wait, actually, the reaction can be written as:

H2SO4 (2 H+) + Ba(OH)2 (2 OH-) → BaSO4 + 2 H2O (neither H+ nor OH-).

But, the reaction produces water, so perhaps the H+ and OH- from the acid and base combine to form water, but in this case, it's part of the precipitation.

Wait, perhaps the overall reaction can be considered as:

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

Which is a neutralization reaction, but it's more specific because it forms a precipitate.

So, for this reaction, each mole releases a certain amount of heat. I might need to find the enthalpy change for this reaction.

But wait, I'm not given any specific ΔH values for this reaction. Hmm, so maybe I should proceed without it. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that only the neutralization (H+ + OH-) is considered, and the precipitation is ignored, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to only consider the neutralization part, ignoring the precipitation. But that's unclear.

Hmm, this complicates things. Let me try to think of another approach. Maybe the problem expects me to calculate the heat released due to all the H+ reacting with OH-.

But I have to consider that some of the H2SO4 has reacted with Ba(OH)2, so the available H+ is reduced.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the H+ and OH- after any precipitation.

Wait, let's reevaluate:

H2SO4 (0.09 mol) reacts with Ba(OH)2 (0.1 mol) in a 1:1 ratio, producing 0.09 mol BaSO4 and using up 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2.

So, H2SO4 is completely consumed. Ba(OH)2 left is 0.01 mol.

So, the H+ comes from the remaining HCl and any H+ from the remaining H2SO4. But H2SO4 is all consumed, so H+ is from HCl.

HCl is 0.1 mol, which provides 0.1 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.01 mol, which provides 0.02 mol OH-.

So, now, the neutralization reaction between H+ and OH- would be:

0.02 mol OH- + 0.02 mol H+ → 0.02 mol H2O.

But wait, the available H+ is 0.1, and OH- is 0.02. So OH- is the limiting reagent. So all 0.02 mol OH- reacts with 0.02 mol H+.

So, in total, the H+ that reacts is 0.02.

So, the total enthalpy change would be 0.02 mol * (-57.3 kJ/mol) = -1.146 kJ.

That's about -2.72 kcal (since 1.146 kJ is approximately 0.274 kcal; wait, wait: 1.146 kJ = 1.146 /4.184 ≈ 0.2736 kcal. So total is -0.2736 kcal. But that seems too low, and the options have A as -2.72 kcal, which is much larger.

Hmm, something's definitely wrong with my approach.

Alternative approach: perhaps I should calculate the total H+ and OH- available, regardless of other reactions, and then find the limiting reagent.

Total H+ from HCl and H2SO4: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.2.

So, OH- is limiting. So 0.2 H+ and 0.2 OH- react, making 0.2 H2O.

The enthalpy change is 0.2 * (-57.3 kJ) = -11.46 kJ.

But wait, the problem is that some of the H2SO4 might have reacted with Ba(OH)2, so the H+ available from H2SO4 may have been used in that reaction, not in neutralization. So perhaps the initial H+ is 0.28, but some of it is used in forming BaSO4, not in neutralization.

Alternatively, maybe the H+ from H2SO4 is all available, regardless of any precipitate.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider all H+ and OH- ions, regardless of their source, and find the limiting reagent.

So:

Total H+ from HCl: 0.1.

H+ from H2SO4: 0.18 → but wait, if some H2SO4 reacted with Ba(OH)2, then that H+ would not be available for neutralization.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to think in terms of all possible reactions.

Let me outline the possible steps:

1. Reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4 precipitate and water.

   H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

   This reaction uses up some H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, producing BaSO4 and water.

2. After this reaction, any remaining H+ (from HCl and any unreacted H2SO4) will react with remaining OH- (from Ba(OH)2) in neutralization.

So, first, calculate how much H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 are consumed in the precipitation.

Moles of H2SO4: 0.09 mol.

Moles of Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol.

The reaction is 1:1, so H2SO4 is the limiting reagent, as it has fewer moles. So 0.09 mol H2SO4 reacts, consuming 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2.

So after this reaction:

H2SO4: 0.09 - 0.09 = 0 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 mol.

Now, the remaining H+ comes from HCl and any unreacted H2SO4. But H2SO4 is all reacted, so H+ is only from HCl: 0.1 mol.

The remaining OH- comes from the unreacted Ba(OH)2: 0.01 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.02 mol OH-.

So, the neutralization reaction now is H+ (0.1 mol) and OH- (0.02 mol) reacting.

OH- is the limiting reagent here, so all 0.02 mol OH- reacts with 0.02 mol H+.

So, total H+ neutralized is 0.02 mol.

Enthalpy change for this: 0.02 * (-57.3) = -1.146 kJ.

But that's only part of the enthalpy change. There's also the enthalpy from the precipitation reaction.

So, I need to calculate the enthalpy change for both reactions.

Reaction 1: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Reaction 2: H+ + OH- → H2O (0.02 mol).

But without knowing the enthalpy change of Reaction 1, I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the precipitation reaction. Or maybe the problem is designed so that the precipitation doesn't happen because the concentrations or volumes are such that it's negligible.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that all H+ and OH- are available for neutralization, regardless of possible precipitations.

In that case, the total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2, so 0.2 H+ reacts, releasing 0.2 *57.3 = 11.46 kJ → -11.46 kJ.

In that case, the enthalpy change is approximately -11.46 kJ.

Looking back at the options:

Option D is -16.0 kJ. Hmm, not matching.

Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.42 kcal is about 48.2 kJ, which is much higher than 11.46 kJ.

Wait, but perhaps the problem uses the enthalpy of neutralization per mole of H+ as -57.3 kcal/mol. No, that can't be right because 57.3 is in kJ.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the units.

Wait, the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+.

So, 0.2 moles → 0.2 * (-57.3) = -11.46 kJ.

So, the enthalpy change is approximately -11.46 kJ. But the options don't have this exact value.

Looking at the options, D is -16.0 kJ. That's not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -48.3 kJ, way too high.

Wait, I'm getting confused because the options have both kcal and kJ. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is using the enthalpy in calories rather than kilojoules.

Wait, 1 kJ is about 239.006 kcal. No, wait, 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ. So 1 kJ is approximately 0.239 kcal.

Wait, no, sorry, the conversion is 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ. So 1 kJ is 1/4.184 kcal ≈ 0.2388 kcal.

So, -11.46 kJ is equal to -11.46 * 0.2388 ≈ -2.736 kcal.

Looking at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal, which is very close. So the answer would be A.

But I'm not entirely confident because I'm not sure if the problem accounts for the precipitation reaction or not.

Wait, but let's recap: if I ignore the precipitation reaction (i.e., if the problem considers only the neutralization of H+ and OH-), then 0.2 moles H+ react, giving -11.46 kJ → ≈-2.74 kcal, which is close to option A.

Alternatively, if I account for the precipitation, the enthalpy change would be from both reactions:

Reaction 1: 0.09 mol H2SO4 + 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.09 mol BaSO4 + 0.18 mol H2O. Let's assume this reaction releases some heat, say, ΔH1.

Reaction 2: 0.02 mol H+ + 0.02 mol OH- → 0.02 mol H2O. ΔH2 = 0.02 * (-57.3) = -1.146 kJ.

Total ΔH = ΔH1 + ΔH2.

But without knowing ΔH1, I can't compute the exact value. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the precipitation and consider only the neutralization of the available H+ and OH-.

In that case, the answer is approximately -2.74 kcal, so option A.

But wait, option D is in kJ. Let me see if the problem expects the answer in kJ.

The options are: A) -2.72 kcal, B) -11.42 kcal, C) -3.80 kcal, D) -16.0 kJ.

If the correct value is -11.46 kJ, the closest option would be D: -16.0 kJ is not close. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption about the enthalpy per mole is wrong. Let me check: the standard enthalpy of neutralization is about -57.3 kJ per mole of H+.

Wait, but when dealing with strong acids and strong bases, the enthalpy per mole of H+ is indeed around -57.3 kJ. So, 0.2 mol → 11.46 kJ.

But none of the options in kJ match that. Only option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger.

Hmm, perhaps I should recheck the moles.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the moles of H+.

Wait, HCl: 500 mL = 0.5 L. 0.2 M → 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL = 0.3 L. 0.3 M → 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL = 0.2 L. 0.5 M → 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So, total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So 0.2 H+ reacts.

Thus, 0.2 *57.3 = 11.46 kJ.

But again, none of the options match exactly.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem states that the enthalpy of neutralization is -57.3 kcal/mol. But that's not correct, since 57.3 is in kJ.

Wait, perhaps the given options are in kcal, but the correct calculation is in kJ, then convert.

Wait, 11.46 kJ is equal to about 2.736 kcal. So approximately -2.74 kcal, which is option A.

But then why is option B -11.42 kcal? That would be about 48.2 kJ, which is way higher.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the question is considering each mole of acid or base as contributing to the neutralization. For example, perhaps the calculation is based on the number of moles of H+ from each acid and the OH- from the base, and considering that each acid contributes a certain amount.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem might be designed to ignore the precipitation and just consider all the H+ and OH- available for neutralization, thus leading to 0.2 moles of H+ reacting.

So, the enthalpy change is -11.46 kJ, which is about -2.74 kcal, which matches option A.

Therefore, the correct answer is option A.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we proceed as follows:

1. **Determine moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - HCl: \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol HCl} \), which contributes \( 0.1 \, \text{mol H⁺} \).
   - H₂SO₄: \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol H₂SO₄} \), which contributes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol H⁺} \).
   - Total \( \text{H⁺} \): \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Determine moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**
   - Ba(OH)₂: \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol Ba(OH)₂} \), which contributes \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{mol OH⁻} \).

3. **Identify the limiting reagent:**
   - The reaction \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \) requires 1 mole of \( \text{H⁺} \) and 1 mole of \( \text{OH⁻} \).
   - \( \text{H⁺} \) is present in excess (0.28 mol), while \( \text{OH⁻} \) is limiting (0.2 mol). Thus, 0.2 mol of \( \text{H⁺} \) reacts with 0.2 mol of \( \text{OH⁻} \).

4. **Calculate the enthalpy change:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and bases is approximately \( -57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) of \( \text{H⁺} \).
   - For 0.2 mol of \( \text{H⁺} \), the enthalpy change is:
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \times (-57.3 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.46 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]

5. **Convert to kcal (if necessary):**
   - \( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.2388 \, \text{kcal} \), so:
     \[
     -11.46 \, \text{kJ} \times 0.2388 \, \text{kcal/kJ} \approx -2.74 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

6. **Compare with the options:**
   - Option A (\(-2.72 \, \text{kcal}\)) is the closest to the calculated value of \(-2.74 \, \text{kcal}\).
   - Other options (e.g., \(-11.42 \, \text{kcal}\) or \(-16.0 \, \text{kJ}\)) do not match the calculation.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**.

Answer: A
