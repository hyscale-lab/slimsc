Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about an annihilation process: p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other and produce two particles of A⁺ and two of A⁻. The mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D, with velocities like 0.77c, 0.96c, etc.

Wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, right, that's important. So the initial setup is that the antiproton is moving at a low speed compared to the speed of light. But wait, protons and antiprotons have the same mass, right? So, when they collide, because the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial energy isn't too high.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving." So, its kinetic energy is much less than its rest energy. So, perhaps we can approximate the initial energy as just the rest energy of the proton and antiproton.

Wait, but when particles annihilate, they usually convert their mass into energy. But in this case, they're producing these A particles. So, maybe the total energy available is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton.

Wait, but wait. The proton and antiproton have the same rest mass. Let's calculate that. The rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So each has m_p c² ≈ 938 MeV. So, total rest energy for the system before annihilation is 2 * 938 MeV = around 1876 MeV.

But the products are four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. Each A has a mass of 300 MeV. So the total rest mass of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. So 1200 MeV is less than 1876 MeV. So that means there's energy available to give to the kinetic energy of the products. Hmm, but since the initial particles are at rest (or the antiproton is moving slowly), wait, no. Wait, the initial setup: the antiproton is moving, but slowly. So the system's total energy is higher than their rest masses. But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, which suggests that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. So perhaps we can approximate the total initial energy as the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton.

Wait, but no. Because the initial scenario is a collision between a proton and antiproton. The proton is probably at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it, but slowly. So the total energy would be the rest energy of the proton plus the energy of the moving antiproton, which is gamma * m_p c². But since it's moving slowly, gamma is approximately 1. So total initial energy is about 2 * m_p c² ≈ 1876 MeV.

Now, the products are four A particles. Each has rest mass 300 MeV, so the total rest mass of the products is 1200 MeV. So the initial energy (1876 MeV) is greater than the rest energy of the products, so there's kinetic energy available.

But wait, since the initial is moving, perhaps the products will have some kinetic energy as well. But the question is about the velocity of particle A. Assuming all four particles A have the same velocity? Hmm, the question says "the velocity of particle A," so perhaps each A has the same speed. But wait, maybe they are moving in different directions, but perhaps in this scenario, they all have the same speed, just opposite directions or something? Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe each A is moving in opposite directions, so their velocities are opposite. But we'll probably have to make some assumptions.

But wait, the question gives options for the velocity, and the velocities are all a certain fraction of c. So probably, the particles A are moving at high speeds, so relativistic effects are important.

Wait, but let's think about conservation of energy and momentum. Because in the initial state, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. So, the initial momentum is approximately the momentum of the antiproton, which is since it's moving slowly, p ≈ m_p v. But since v is small, p is small compared to m_p c.

Wait, but perhaps if the system is symmetric, the products would move in a certain way. For example, if the products are two A+ and two A-, perhaps they are moving in pairs, like two pairs moving in opposite directions. So, two A+ in one direction and two A- in the opposite? Or maybe each A+ and A- are moving in opposite directions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the products are all moving in the same direction, but that seems unlikely given the charges; but the question is about their velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, and we can model it as the total energy and momentum are conserved, and the products all have the same velocity. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the system is symmetric, so the products are moving in such a way that their momenta add up in a certain direction.

Wait, the initial system has the proton at rest and the antiproton moving with some velocity, but if the antiproton is very slow, then the initial momentum is low. So perhaps the products have to share that momentum.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that all four particles A are moving in the same direction, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, maybe two pairs are moving in opposite directions, leading to some cancellation in momentum. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is symmetric, and the products move in such a way that their momenta cancel each other, but that would require the products to have zero net momentum, which would only happen if their momenta are balanced. But the initial system has some momentum from the antiproton, so the products must have a net momentum equal to that.

Wait, but perhaps the initial system's momentum is negligible because the antiproton is moving slowly. So, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v_p, which is much less than c. So, its momentum is m_p v_p. But because v_p is small, m_p v_p is much less than m_p c. So, perhaps the initial momentum is negligible compared to the rest mass.

In that case, the final momentum of the products must also be zero, because the initial momentum is negligible. But that can't be, because the products are moving, so their momentum would add up. Wait, but if the initial momentum is zero, then the products must have a net momentum of zero. So, perhaps the products are moving in opposite directions, in such a way that their momenta cancel each other.

But wait, the products are two A+ and two A-. So perhaps two are moving in one direction, and the other two in the opposite direction. So, for their momentum to cancel, each pair would have equal and opposite momentum.

Alternatively, maybe each A+ and A- are moving in opposite directions with the same speed, so their momenta cancel. But wait, if all four are moving in pairs, then their total momentum could cancel.

Alternatively, perhaps each A has the same speed but opposite directions. So, for each A⁺, there's an A⁻ moving in the opposite direction. Then, the momentum of each A⁺ cancels the A⁻. But that leaves the total momentum as zero. But the initial system has some momentum because the antiproton is moving. Hmm, but the initial momentum is small because the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe the products have a net momentum approximately equal to the initial momentum.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach this using conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me denote the variables.

Let me assume that after the reaction, each of the four A particles has the same speed v, but moving in some direction.

But that might not hold, because the charges are different, so perhaps they have different directions. Alternatively, perhaps the two A⁺ are moving in one direction and the two A⁻ in the opposite, each with speed v. Let's assume that for simplicity.

Wait, but the problem is symmetric. The reaction produces two A⁺ and two A⁻. So, perhaps the A⁺ and A⁻ are moving in opposite directions, each with some speed v, but perhaps we can model it as two pairs moving in opposite directions. Let's try that.

So, let's model the four A particles as two pairs: each pair (A⁺ and A⁻) moving in opposite directions. But perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps all four particles are moving in the same direction. But that would make their total momentum additive. But given that the initial system has the antiproton moving in one direction, and the proton stationary, the products would have to have a net momentum in that direction.

Hmm, this might get messy, but perhaps I can make some approximations.

Let me consider that the initial system (proton + antiproton) has total energy E_initial = E_p + E_pbar. Since the proton is stationary, its energy is m_p c². The antiproton is moving slowly, so its energy is approximately m_p c² plus (1/2) m_p v_p². But since v_p is much less than c, perhaps the kinetic energy is small compared to m_p c². So, E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

But wait, the problem statement says that the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps its kinetic energy is negligible. So E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

But wait, let's calculate that. The proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton is moving with velocity v_p, so its energy is gamma_p m_p c². Since v_p is small, gamma_p ≈ 1. So E_initial ≈ m_p c² + m_p c² = 2 m_p c².

So E_initial = 2 * 938 MeV ≈ 1876 MeV.

The energy of the products is the sum of their rest energies plus their kinetic energies. The rest energy of each A is 300 MeV, so four A particles have a rest energy of 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. So the remaining energy, 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV, is the total kinetic energy of the products.

But wait, this is only considering the rest energies. But because the particles are moving, their kinetic energies add to their energies. So the total energy after annihilation is E_final = 4 * gamma_A m_A c².

Because each A has energy gamma_A m_A c², and four of them, so 4 gamma_A m_A c² = E_initial = 2 m_p c².

So, 4 gamma_A (300 MeV) = 2 * 938 MeV.

Solving for gamma_A:

gamma_A = (2 * 938) / (4 * 300) ) = (1876) / (1200) ≈ 1.5633.

Hmm, so gamma is about 1.5633. Now, we can find the velocity v of each A using the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, let's compute v.

gamma = 1.5633.

So, 1.5633 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Taking reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/1.5633 ≈ 0.640.

Squaring both sides:

1 - v²/c² = (0.640)^2 ≈ 0.4096.

So, v²/c² = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904.

So, v/c = sqrt(0.5904) ≈ 0.768.

So, v ≈ 0.768 c.

But wait, the options are A) 0.77c, which is close. So the answer would be option A, 0.77c.

Wait, but let me double-check the math.

2 * 938 is 1876 MeV. 4 * 300 is 1200. So 1876 / 1200 is 1.563333...

gamma = 1.563333.

Now, gamma = 1.5633.

Compute v:

1/gamma² = 1 - (v²/c²).

So, 1/(1.5633)^2 ≈ 1/(2.443) ≈ 0.4096.

So, v²/c² = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904.

v = sqrt(0.5904) * c ≈ 0.768 c.

So, approximately 0.768c. The closest option is A) 0.77c.

Wait, but wait. Did I make any assumption that's incorrect? I assumed that all four A particles have the same gamma, and that their momenta sum to the initial momentum. But what about the momentum?

Because the initial system's momentum is that of the antiproton. Since the proton is stationary and the antiproton is moving, the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p * m_p * v_p.

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v_p << c, gamma_p ≈ 1. So p_initial ≈ m_p v_p.

In the final state, each A has momentum p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

But wait, if all four A particles are moving in the same direction, then the total momentum would be 4 * p_A. But that can't be, because the initial momentum is in the same direction as the antiproton's motion (assuming the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving towards it). So, the total momentum of the products must equal p_initial.

Wait, but earlier I assumed that the products have zero net momentum, which would be the case if the products' momenta cancel each other. But that's only possible if the initial momentum is zero, which it's not. So that's a mistake in my earlier reasoning.

So, I think I need to correct my approach. Let me reevaluate.

Because the initial system has some momentum, the products must have a net momentum equal to that. So, perhaps the products have their momenta arranged so that their sum equals the initial momentum.

But this complicates things, because I need to consider both energy and momentum conservation.

So, let me write down the conservation equations.

Let me denote:

Initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c². Since the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma_p ≈ 1 + (v_p²)/(2c²), but perhaps for simplicity, since v_p is small, we can take E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v_p². But if v_p is very small, then the kinetic energy is much less than the rest energy, so E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

But for precise calculation, perhaps I should consider the exact energy.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so v_p << c. So, p_initial ≈ m_p v_p.

So, the initial momentum is p_initial = m_p v_p.

In the final state, each A has momentum p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

Assuming all four A's are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum (the direction of the antiproton's velocity), then the total final momentum would be 4 * p_A = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

But this equals p_initial = m_p v_p.

So, 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p v_p.

But wait, since v_p is small, perhaps v_A is not that small, so gamma_A is greater than 1.

But this complicates things because now I have two equations: one for energy and one for momentum.

So, let's write the energy equation:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c^2.

Since the proton is at rest, its energy is m_p c². The antiproton's energy is gamma_p m_p c².

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma_p is approximately 1 + (v_p^2)/(2 c^2), but for better approximation, perhaps we can write gamma_p = 1 + (v_p^2)/(2 c^2) + (v_p^4)/(8 c^4) + ... but perhaps for small v_p, we can approximate gamma_p ≈ 1 + (v_p^2)/(2 c^2).

But perhaps a better approach is to treat the initial energy as approximately 2 m_p c², but I'm not sure.

Wait, but maybe the initial momentum is much less than the rest mass. So, perhaps the products' velocities are such that their momenta sum up to p_initial. So, let's proceed with the equations.

So, let's write:

Equation 1 (Energy conservation):
4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

Equation 2 (Momentum conservation):
4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma_p m_p v_p.

But since v_p is small, and gamma_p ≈ 1, perhaps we can write gamma_p = 1 + (v_p^2)/(2 c²).

Wait, but now I'm getting into a lot of variables. Let me see if I can make some approximations.

Given that the antiproton is moving slowly, v_p << c. So, v_p is much less than c, so gamma_p ≈ 1. So, equation 2 becomes:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A ≈ m_p v_p.

Equation 1 becomes:

4 gamma_A m_A c² ≈ 2 m_p c².

Wait, because E_initial is m_p c² (proton) + m_p c² (antiproton) = 2 m_p c², since gamma_p ≈ 1.

So, equation 1: 4 gamma_A (300 MeV) = 2 * 938 MeV.

So, 4 gamma_A * 300 = 2 * 938 → gamma_A = (2 * 938) / (4 * 300) ) = (1876)/(1200) ≈ 1.5633.

Which is what I got earlier, leading to v ≈ 0.768 c.

But I also have equation 2, which: 4 gamma_A m_A v_A ≈ m_p v_p.

But since v_p is small, and m_p is about 938 MeV/c², and m_A is 300 MeV/c².

Wait, but in equation 2, if I substitute the numbers, let's see.

gamma_A ≈ 1.5633.

So, 4 * 1.5633 * 300 * v_A ≈ 938 * v_p.

But since v_p is small, let's say v_p is much less than c, then v_p = beta_p c, where beta_p is small. So,

4 * 1.5633 * 300 * v_A ≈ 938 * beta_p c.

But from equation 1, we have v_A in terms of c. So, v_A = 0.768 c.

So, substituting v_A = 0.768 c,

Left side: 4 * 1.5633 * 300 * 0.768 c ≈ 4 * 1.5633 * 300 * 0.768 c.

Compute that:

4 * 1.5633 ≈ 6.2532.

6.2532 * 300 ≈ 1875.96.

1875.96 * 0.768 ≈ 1441.44.

So, left side ≈ 1441.44 c.

Right side: 938 * beta_p c.

So, 1441.44 c ≈ 938 beta_p c → beta_p ≈ 1441.44 / 938 ≈ 1.537.

Wait, but beta_p can't be greater than 1, because velocity can't exceed c. So, this implies that our initial assumption that gamma_p ≈ 1 is invalid. So, that's a problem.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that gamma_p is approximately 1. Because if v_p is not that small, then gamma_p would be larger than 1, which could affect the calculation.

Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So, v_p must be much less than c, so beta_p << 1, and gamma_p ≈ 1.

But according to this calculation, when I use v_A ≈ 0.768 c, the resulting beta_p would be greater than 1, which is impossible. So, there's a contradiction, which suggests that our earlier assumption is incorrect.

Hmm, so perhaps the approach of neglecting the initial momentum and assuming that all the energy goes into the rest mass of the products is incorrect. Or perhaps the assumption that all four A particles move in the same direction is incorrect.

Alternative approach: perhaps the products move in such a way that their momenta cancel each other, leading to a net momentum of zero. But that would only be possible if the initial momentum is zero, which isn't the case here. So, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps instead of all four A particles moving in the same direction, they are moving in pairs, so that their momenta in each pair cancel each other, leaving a net momentum equal to the initial momentum.

Wait, let's consider that two of the A's are moving in one direction and the other two in the opposite direction, each with velocity v but opposite directions. Then, the net momentum would be zero for each pair, but since there are two pairs, perhaps their momenta add up in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps the four A's are moving in two opposite directions, each with two particles. So, two move in the same direction and two in the opposite, leading to a net momentum.

But this is getting complicated. Let me try to model it.

Let me assume that two A's are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum (the direction of the antiproton's motion), and the other two are moving in the opposite direction. Let's say that each A has velocity v, but in opposite directions for the two groups.

So, the total momentum of the products would be:

P_final = (2 * gamma_A m_A v) - (2 * gamma_A m_A v) ) = 0.

But that can't be right because the initial momentum is not zero. So, that's not possible.

Hmm, maybe the velocities are different for the two groups. Let me assume that two A's are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum with velocity v, and the other two are moving in the opposite direction with velocity u. Then, the total momentum would be:

P_final = 2 gamma_A m_A v - 2 gamma_A m_A u = 2 gamma_A m_A (v - u).

This should equal the initial momentum, which is m_p v_p.

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v_p is small, so m_p v_p is small compared to m_p c.

But this approach adds more variables, making it more complicated. Maybe it's better to consider a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the initial momentum is negligible, and we can ignore it. So, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the rest frame of the proton-antiproton system. Wait, but the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving; so that's not the center-of-momentum frame. Wait, perhaps I should compute the problem in the center-of-momentum frame, but that might complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is negligible, so we can assume that the products have zero net momentum, but that would only be the case if the initial system's momentum is zero, which it isn't. So that can't be.

Another approach: Let's assume that the products are moving in such a way that their momenta cancel each other, except for a small component that matches the initial momentum. But this might not be the case.

Wait, perhaps the initial momentum is not zero, but the products' momenta are arranged symmetrically except for some adjustments due to the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering the initial momentum, which would be the case if the antiproton's velocity is so small that its contribution to the initial momentum is negligible. But in that case, the products' momenta would have to sum to zero, which would imply that their velocities are arranged in such a way that their momenta cancel each other.

But I'm stuck. Let's try another approach.

Let me think about the situation where the initial system's momentum is zero. That would be the case if the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other with equal and opposite velocities. But in this problem, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly, so initial momentum is not zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved in the rest frame of the proton, where the initial momentum is that of the antiproton. But in that case, the final products would have to have a net momentum equal to the initial antiproton's momentum.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the problem in the center-of-momentum frame, where the total initial momentum is zero. But since the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving, the center-of-momentum frame would have a different velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering the initial momentum, treating the system as if it's at rest, which would not be accurate but perhaps acceptable for the sake of the problem.

But if I proceed under that assumption (ignoring initial momentum), then the products must have zero net momentum, which would require their momenta to cancel each other. So, for example, two A⁺ moving in one direction and two A⁻ moving in the opposite direction, each pair with the same speed, so their momenta cancel each other.

In that case, the total momentum of the products would be zero, which would match the initial momentum if the initial system's momentum is zero. But in reality, the initial system's momentum isn't zero.

Hmm, but perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the initial momentum, considering that the antiproton is moving slowly, so its momentum is negligible. So, the products' total momentum can be considered as zero, leading to the same conclusion as earlier: gamma ≈ 1.5633 and v ≈ 0.768c.

But earlier, when I tried to include the momentum, I ended up with a contradiction because beta_p came out to be greater than 1. So, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the initial momentum, treating the system as if it's at rest, and thus proceed with the earlier calculation, leading to the answer A) 0.77c.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup, and the correct approach is to ignore the initial momentum, leading to the 0.77c answer.

But let me think again. If the initial momentum is negligible, then the products' momenta must cancel each other, leading to a scenario where the products are moving symmetrically, so their velocities are such that their momenta sum to zero. In this case, the energy calculation gives us v ≈ 0.768c, which is option A.

But why did considering the initial momentum lead to a problem? Because when I included the momentum, I got a result that's impossible, which suggests that perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is negligible, and the products' velocities are such that their momenta are symmetric, leading to the same result as before.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 0.77c.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the initial approach by not considering the direction of the momenta. Let me check again.

Wait, considering that the initial momentum is p_initial = m_p v_p (since gamma_p ≈ 1), and the final momentum is 4 gamma_A m_A v_A (assuming all A's move in the same direction), then:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p v_p.

But from the energy equation, 4 gamma_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² → gamma_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) ) = (m_p)/(2 m_A) ) = (938)/(2*300) ≈ 1.5633.

So, gamma_A is about 1.5633, leading to v_A ≈ 0.768c.

But then, substituting into the momentum equation:

4 * 1.5633 * 300 * 0.768 c = m_p v_p.

So, left side: 4 * 1.5633 * 300 * 0.768 ≈ 4 * 1.5633 * 229.8 → 4 * (1.5633 * 229.8) → 4 * 360. → Approximately 1440.

So, 1440 c = 938 v_p → v_p ≈ (1440 /938 ) c ≈ 1.535c → which is impossible.

So, this suggests that the assumption that all A's are moving in the same direction is invalid. Therefore, the initial approach is incorrect.

Hmm, maybe the products move in such a way that their momenta are balanced. Maybe two move in one direction and two in the opposite, leading to a net momentum that equals the initial momentum.

Let me model that.

Let’s say that two A's are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum (the antiproton's direction), each with velocity v, and two are moving in the opposite direction, each with velocity u.

So, the total momentum is:

P_final = 2 * gamma_v m_A v - 2 * gamma_u m_A u.

This should equal the initial momentum, which is m_p v_p.

Energy conservation:

Total energy of the products is 2 * gamma_v m_A c² + 2 * gamma_u m_A c² = E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

But this is getting more complicated, with multiple variables. Perhaps it's better to assume that all four A's have the same speed, but two are moving in the same direction and two in the opposite, leading to a net momentum.

Wait, if two are moving in the same direction, and two in the opposite, their velocities are v and -v (relative to the same frame), then the total momentum is 2 gamma v m_A v + 2 gamma (-v) m_A (-v) → wait, no, that's not right because the directions matter. Let me clarify:

Each A's momentum is gamma m_A v, where v is the velocity. So, for two A's moving in the +x direction, their momenta are +gamma m_A v each. For two moving in the -x direction, their momenta are -gamma m_A u each, where u is their speed. Wait, but if they're moving in opposite directions, their velocities are v and -u. Hmm, perhaps it's better to let both have the same speed magnitude but opposite directions, so v and -v.

So, their momenta would be: 2 * gamma m_A v (for +v) and 2 * gamma m_A (-v) (for -v). So, the total momentum is zero. But that's only possible if the initial momentum is zero, which it's not. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps the two pairs have different speeds. Let me assume that two A's have speed v in the +x direction, and two have speed u in the -x direction. Then, the total momentum is 2 gamma_v m_A v - 2 gamma_u m_A u = m_p v_p.

The energy equation is 2 gamma_v m_A c² + 2 gamma_u m_A c² = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

But this introduces more variables. It's getting too complicated, perhaps beyond the scope of the problem. So, perhaps the problem expects us to neglect the initial momentum, leading to the earlier velocity of 0.77c, option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is negligible, so the products can have symmetric momenta, leading to v ≈ 0.77c.

But earlier, when I included the initial momentum, I got an impossible result, which suggests that the initial approach is invalid.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another angle. Let's assume that the initial system is at rest, which would mean the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other with equal and opposite velocities. But the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, implying that perhaps the system isn't at rest, but the proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving towards it.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total energy and momentum in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v_p.

In that case:

Total initial energy E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

Total initial momentum P_initial = gamma_p m_p v_p.

After annihilation, the four A particles have energies E_A each, and momenta p_A each, in various directions.

But this is getting really complicated, and perhaps beyond the intended approach of the problem.

Given the time I've spent and the options provided, perhaps the intended approach is to ignore the initial momentum and calculate the velocity based on energy conservation alone, leading to v ≈ 0.77c, option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the annihilation process:

\[
p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^-
\]

where the antiproton is moving slowly, and the rest energy of each particle \( A \) is given as \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \). The goal is to determine the velocity of particle \( A \).

### Key Analysis

1. **Initial Energy and Momentum**:
   - The proton is stationary, so its energy is \( m_p c^2 \).
   - The antiproton is moving slowly, so its energy is approximately \( \gamma_p m_p c^2 \), where \( \gamma_p \approx 1 \) because \( v_p \ll c \).
   - Total initial energy: 
     \[
     E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + \gamma_p m_p c^2 \approx 2 m_p c^2
     \]
   - Total initial momentum is small because the antiproton is moving slowly: 
     \[
     P_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_p m_p v_p \approx m_p v_p
     \]

2. **Final Energy and Momentum**:
   - The products are four \( A \)-particles: two \( A^+ \) and two \( A^- \).
   - Rest energy of each \( A \)-particle: \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - Total rest energy of the products: 
     \[
     4 m_A c^2 = 4 \times 300 \, \text{MeV} = 1200 \, \text{MeV}
     \]
   - Total energy of the products: 
     \[
     E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2
     \]
   - Momentum of each \( A \)-particle: \( p_A = \gamma_A m_A v_A \).

3. **Energy Conservation**:
   Using conservation of energy:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}}
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   2 m_p c^2 = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2
   \]
   Solving for \( \gamma_A \):
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}
   \]
   Substituting \( m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \):
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{938}{2 \times 300} \approx 1.5633
   \]

4. **Relating \( \gamma_A \) to Velocity**:
   The relationship between \( \gamma \) and velocity is:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]
   Rearranging for \( v \):
   \[
   v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( \gamma_A \approx 1.5633 \):
   \[
   v \approx c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} \approx c \sqrt{1 - 0.4096} \approx c \sqrt{0.5904} \approx 0.768c
   \]

5. **Matching to Options**:
   The calculated velocity \( v \approx 0.768c \) is closest to option **A) 0.77c**.

### Conclusion

The velocity of particle \( A \) is approximately \( 0.77c \). This result assumes the initial momentum is negligible due to the slow motion of the antiproton and focuses on energy conservation to determine the velocity.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about an annihilation process: p + p̄ → 2A⁺ + 2A⁻. So, a proton and an antiproton annihilate each other and produce two particles of A⁺ and two of A⁻. The mass of A is given as m_A c² = 300 MeV. The question is asking for the velocity of particle A. The options are A to D, with velocities like 0.77c, 0.96c, etc.

Wait, the antiproton is moving slowly. Oh, right, that's important. So the initial setup is that the antiproton is moving at a low speed compared to the speed of light. But wait, protons and antiprotons have the same mass, right? So, when they collide, because the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial energy isn't too high.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the antiproton is "slowly moving." So, its kinetic energy is much less than its rest energy. So, perhaps we can approximate the initial energy as just the rest energy of the proton and antiproton.

Wait, but when particles annihilate, they usually convert their mass into energy. But in this case, they're producing these A particles. So, maybe the total energy available is the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton.

Wait, but wait. The proton and antiproton have the same rest mass. Let's calculate that. The rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c². So each has m_p c² ≈ 938 MeV. So, total rest energy for the system before annihilation is 2 * 938 MeV = around 1876 MeV.

But the products are four particles: two A⁺ and two A⁻. Each A has a mass of 300 MeV. So the total rest mass of the products is 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. So 1200 MeV is less than 1876 MeV. So that means there's energy available to give to the kinetic energy of the products. Hmm, but since the initial particles are at rest (or the antiproton is moving slowly), wait, no. Wait, the initial setup: the antiproton is moving, but slowly. So the system's total energy is higher than their rest masses. But wait, the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, which suggests that its kinetic energy is negligible compared to its rest energy. So perhaps we can approximate the total initial energy as the sum of the rest energies of the proton and antiproton.

Wait, but no. Because the initial scenario is a collision between a proton and antiproton. The proton is probably at rest, and the antiproton is moving towards it, but slowly. So the total energy would be the rest energy of the proton plus the energy of the moving antiproton, which is gamma * m_p c². But since it's moving slowly, gamma is approximately 1. So total initial energy is about 2 * m_p c² ≈ 1876 MeV.

Now, the products are four A particles. Each has rest mass 300 MeV, so the total rest mass of the products is 1200 MeV. So the initial energy (1876 MeV) is greater than the rest energy of the products, so there's kinetic energy available.

But wait, since the initial is moving, perhaps the products will have some kinetic energy as well. But the question is about the velocity of particle A. Assuming all four particles A have the same velocity? Hmm, the question says "the velocity of particle A," so perhaps each A has the same speed. But wait, maybe they are moving in different directions, but perhaps in this scenario, they all have the same speed, just opposite directions or something? Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe each A is moving in opposite directions, so their velocities are opposite. But we'll probably have to make some assumptions.

But wait, the question gives options for the velocity, and the velocities are all a certain fraction of c. So probably, the particles A are moving at high speeds, so relativistic effects are important.

Wait, but let's think about conservation of energy and momentum. Because in the initial state, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. So, the initial momentum is approximately the momentum of the antiproton, which is since it's moving slowly, p ≈ m_p v. But since v is small, p is small compared to m_p c.

Wait, but perhaps if the system is symmetric, the products would move in a certain way. For example, if the products are two A+ and two A-, perhaps they are moving in pairs, like two pairs moving in opposite directions. So, two A+ in one direction and two A- in the opposite? Or maybe each A+ and A- are moving in opposite directions. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the products are all moving in the same direction, but that seems unlikely given the charges; but the question is about their velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, and we can model it as the total energy and momentum are conserved, and the products all have the same velocity. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, perhaps the system is symmetric, so the products are moving in such a way that their momenta add up in a certain direction.

Wait, the initial system has the proton at rest and the antiproton moving with some velocity, but if the antiproton is very slow, then the initial momentum is low. So perhaps the products have to share that momentum.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that all four particles A are moving in the same direction, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, maybe two pairs are moving in opposite directions, leading to some cancellation in momentum. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is symmetric, and the products move in such a way that their momenta cancel each other, but that would require the products to have zero net momentum, which would only happen if their momenta are balanced. But the initial system has some momentum from the antiproton, so the products must have a net momentum equal to that.

Wait, but perhaps the initial system's momentum is negligible because the antiproton is moving slowly. So, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v_p, which is much less than c. So, its momentum is m_p v_p. But because v_p is small, m_p v_p is much less than m_p c. So, perhaps the initial momentum is negligible compared to the rest mass.

In that case, the final momentum of the products must also be zero, because the initial momentum is negligible. But that can't be, because the products are moving, so their momentum would add up. Wait, but if the initial momentum is zero, then the products must have a net momentum of zero. So, perhaps the products are moving in opposite directions, in such a way that their momenta cancel each other.

But wait, the products are two A+ and two A-. So perhaps two are moving in one direction, and the other two in the opposite direction. So, for their momentum to cancel, each pair would have equal and opposite momentum.

Alternatively, maybe each A+ and A- are moving in opposite directions with the same speed, so their momenta cancel. But wait, if all four are moving in pairs, then their total momentum could cancel.

Alternatively, perhaps each A has the same speed but opposite directions. So, for each A⁺, there's an A⁻ moving in the opposite direction. Then, the momentum of each A⁺ cancels the A⁻. But that leaves the total momentum as zero. But the initial system has some momentum because the antiproton is moving. Hmm, but the initial momentum is small because the antiproton is moving slowly. So maybe the products have a net momentum approximately equal to the initial momentum.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I should approach this using conservation of energy and momentum.

Let me denote the variables.

Let me assume that after the reaction, each of the four A particles has the same speed v, but moving in some direction.

But that might not hold, because the charges are different, so perhaps they have different directions. Alternatively, perhaps the two A⁺ are moving in one direction and the two A⁻ in the opposite, each with speed v. Let's assume that for simplicity.

Wait, but the problem is symmetric. The reaction produces two A⁺ and two A⁻. So, perhaps the A⁺ and A⁻ are moving in opposite directions, each with some speed v, but perhaps we can model it as two pairs moving in opposite directions. Let's try that.

So, let's model the four A particles as two pairs: each pair (A⁺ and A⁻) moving in opposite directions. But perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps all four particles are moving in the same direction. But that would make their total momentum additive. But given that the initial system has the antiproton moving in one direction, and the proton stationary, the products would have to have a net momentum in that direction.

Hmm, this might get messy, but perhaps I can make some approximations.

Let me consider that the initial system (proton + antiproton) has total energy E_initial = E_p + E_pbar. Since the proton is stationary, its energy is m_p c². The antiproton is moving slowly, so its energy is approximately m_p c² plus (1/2) m_p v_p². But since v_p is much less than c, perhaps the kinetic energy is small compared to m_p c². So, E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

But wait, the problem statement says that the antiproton is moving slowly, so perhaps its kinetic energy is negligible. So E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

But wait, let's calculate that. The proton is at rest, so its energy is m_p c². The antiproton is moving with velocity v_p, so its energy is gamma_p m_p c². Since v_p is small, gamma_p ≈ 1. So E_initial ≈ m_p c² + m_p c² = 2 m_p c².

So E_initial = 2 * 938 MeV ≈ 1876 MeV.

The energy of the products is the sum of their rest energies plus their kinetic energies. The rest energy of each A is 300 MeV, so four A particles have a rest energy of 4 * 300 = 1200 MeV. So the remaining energy, 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV, is the total kinetic energy of the products.

But wait, this is only considering the rest energies. But because the particles are moving, their kinetic energies add to their energies. So the total energy after annihilation is E_final = 4 * gamma_A m_A c².

Because each A has energy gamma_A m_A c², and four of them, so 4 gamma_A m_A c² = E_initial = 2 m_p c².

So, 4 gamma_A (300 MeV) = 2 * 938 MeV.

Solving for gamma_A:

gamma_A = (2 * 938) / (4 * 300) ) = (1876) / (1200) ≈ 1.5633.

Hmm, so gamma is about 1.5633. Now, we can find the velocity v of each A using the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, let's compute v.

gamma = 1.5633.

So, 1.5633 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

Taking reciprocal:

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/1.5633 ≈ 0.640.

Squaring both sides:

1 - v²/c² = (0.640)^2 ≈ 0.4096.

So, v²/c² = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904.

So, v/c = sqrt(0.5904) ≈ 0.768.

So, v ≈ 0.768 c.

But wait, the options are A) 0.77c, which is close. So the answer would be option A, 0.77c.

Wait, but let me double-check the math.

2 * 938 is 1876 MeV. 4 * 300 is 1200. So 1876 / 1200 is 1.563333...

gamma = 1.563333.

Now, gamma = 1.5633.

Compute v:

1/gamma² = 1 - (v²/c²).

So, 1/(1.5633)^2 ≈ 1/(2.443) ≈ 0.4096.

So, v²/c² = 1 - 0.4096 = 0.5904.

v = sqrt(0.5904) * c ≈ 0.768 c.

So, approximately 0.768c. The closest option is A) 0.77c.

Wait, but wait. Did I make any assumption that's incorrect? I assumed that all four A particles have the same gamma, and that their momenta sum to the initial momentum. But what about the momentum?

Because the initial system's momentum is that of the antiproton. Since the proton is stationary and the antiproton is moving, the initial momentum is p_initial = gamma_p * m_p * v_p.

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v_p << c, gamma_p ≈ 1. So p_initial ≈ m_p v_p.

In the final state, each A has momentum p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

But wait, if all four A particles are moving in the same direction, then the total momentum would be 4 * p_A. But that can't be, because the initial momentum is in the same direction as the antiproton's motion (assuming the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving towards it). So, the total momentum of the products must equal p_initial.

Wait, but earlier I assumed that the products have zero net momentum, which would be the case if the products' momenta cancel each other. But that's only possible if the initial momentum is zero, which it's not. So that's a mistake in my earlier reasoning.

So, I think I need to correct my approach. Let me reevaluate.

Because the initial system has some momentum, the products must have a net momentum equal to that. So, perhaps the products have their momenta arranged so that their sum equals the initial momentum.

But this complicates things, because I need to consider both energy and momentum conservation.

So, let me write down the conservation equations.

Let me denote:

Initial energy: E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c². Since the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma_p ≈ 1 + (v_p²)/(2c²), but perhaps for simplicity, since v_p is small, we can take E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c² + (1/2) m_p v_p². But if v_p is very small, then the kinetic energy is much less than the rest energy, so E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

But for precise calculation, perhaps I should consider the exact energy.

Wait, but the problem says the antiproton is moving slowly, so v_p << c. So, p_initial ≈ m_p v_p.

So, the initial momentum is p_initial = m_p v_p.

In the final state, each A has momentum p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

Assuming all four A's are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum (the direction of the antiproton's velocity), then the total final momentum would be 4 * p_A = 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

But this equals p_initial = m_p v_p.

So, 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p v_p.

But wait, since v_p is small, perhaps v_A is not that small, so gamma_A is greater than 1.

But this complicates things because now I have two equations: one for energy and one for momentum.

So, let's write the energy equation:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c^2.

Since the proton is at rest, its energy is m_p c². The antiproton's energy is gamma_p m_p c².

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma_p is approximately 1 + (v_p^2)/(2 c^2), but for better approximation, perhaps we can write gamma_p = 1 + (v_p^2)/(2 c^2) + (v_p^4)/(8 c^4) + ... but perhaps for small v_p, we can approximate gamma_p ≈ 1 + (v_p^2)/(2 c^2).

But perhaps a better approach is to treat the initial energy as approximately 2 m_p c², but I'm not sure.

Wait, but maybe the initial momentum is much less than the rest mass. So, perhaps the products' velocities are such that their momenta sum up to p_initial. So, let's proceed with the equations.

So, let's write:

Equation 1 (Energy conservation):
4 gamma_A m_A c² = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

Equation 2 (Momentum conservation):
4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma_p m_p v_p.

But since v_p is small, and gamma_p ≈ 1, perhaps we can write gamma_p = 1 + (v_p^2)/(2 c²).

Wait, but now I'm getting into a lot of variables. Let me see if I can make some approximations.

Given that the antiproton is moving slowly, v_p << c. So, v_p is much less than c, so gamma_p ≈ 1. So, equation 2 becomes:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A ≈ m_p v_p.

Equation 1 becomes:

4 gamma_A m_A c² ≈ 2 m_p c².

Wait, because E_initial is m_p c² (proton) + m_p c² (antiproton) = 2 m_p c², since gamma_p ≈ 1.

So, equation 1: 4 gamma_A (300 MeV) = 2 * 938 MeV.

So, 4 gamma_A * 300 = 2 * 938 → gamma_A = (2 * 938) / (4 * 300) ) = (1876)/(1200) ≈ 1.5633.

Which is what I got earlier, leading to v ≈ 0.768 c.

But I also have equation 2, which: 4 gamma_A m_A v_A ≈ m_p v_p.

But since v_p is small, and m_p is about 938 MeV/c², and m_A is 300 MeV/c².

Wait, but in equation 2, if I substitute the numbers, let's see.

gamma_A ≈ 1.5633.

So, 4 * 1.5633 * 300 * v_A ≈ 938 * v_p.

But since v_p is small, let's say v_p is much less than c, then v_p = beta_p c, where beta_p is small. So,

4 * 1.5633 * 300 * v_A ≈ 938 * beta_p c.

But from equation 1, we have v_A in terms of c. So, v_A = 0.768 c.

So, substituting v_A = 0.768 c,

Left side: 4 * 1.5633 * 300 * 0.768 c ≈ 4 * 1.5633 * 300 * 0.768 c.

Compute that:

4 * 1.5633 ≈ 6.2532.

6.2532 * 300 ≈ 1875.96.

1875.96 * 0.768 ≈ 1441.44.

So, left side ≈ 1441.44 c.

Right side: 938 * beta_p c.

So, 1441.44 c ≈ 938 beta_p c → beta_p ≈ 1441.44 / 938 ≈ 1.537.

Wait, but beta_p can't be greater than 1, because velocity can't exceed c. So, this implies that our initial assumption that gamma_p ≈ 1 is invalid. So, that's a problem.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that gamma_p is approximately 1. Because if v_p is not that small, then gamma_p would be larger than 1, which could affect the calculation.

Wait, but the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly. So, v_p must be much less than c, so beta_p << 1, and gamma_p ≈ 1.

But according to this calculation, when I use v_A ≈ 0.768 c, the resulting beta_p would be greater than 1, which is impossible. So, there's a contradiction, which suggests that our earlier assumption is incorrect.

Hmm, so perhaps the approach of neglecting the initial momentum and assuming that all the energy goes into the rest mass of the products is incorrect. Or perhaps the assumption that all four A particles move in the same direction is incorrect.

Alternative approach: perhaps the products move in such a way that their momenta cancel each other, leading to a net momentum of zero. But that would only be possible if the initial momentum is zero, which isn't the case here. So, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps instead of all four A particles moving in the same direction, they are moving in pairs, so that their momenta in each pair cancel each other, leaving a net momentum equal to the initial momentum.

Wait, let's consider that two of the A's are moving in one direction and the other two in the opposite direction, each with velocity v but opposite directions. Then, the net momentum would be zero for each pair, but since there are two pairs, perhaps their momenta add up in a certain way.

Alternatively, perhaps the four A's are moving in two opposite directions, each with two particles. So, two move in the same direction and two in the opposite, leading to a net momentum.

But this is getting complicated. Let me try to model it.

Let me assume that two A's are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum (the direction of the antiproton's motion), and the other two are moving in the opposite direction. Let's say that each A has velocity v, but in opposite directions for the two groups.

So, the total momentum of the products would be:

P_final = (2 * gamma_A m_A v) - (2 * gamma_A m_A v) ) = 0.

But that can't be right because the initial momentum is not zero. So, that's not possible.

Hmm, maybe the velocities are different for the two groups. Let me assume that two A's are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum with velocity v, and the other two are moving in the opposite direction with velocity u. Then, the total momentum would be:

P_final = 2 gamma_A m_A v - 2 gamma_A m_A u = 2 gamma_A m_A (v - u).

This should equal the initial momentum, which is m_p v_p.

But since the antiproton is moving slowly, v_p is small, so m_p v_p is small compared to m_p c.

But this approach adds more variables, making it more complicated. Maybe it's better to consider a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the initial momentum is negligible, and we can ignore it. So, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using the rest frame of the proton-antiproton system. Wait, but the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving; so that's not the center-of-momentum frame. Wait, perhaps I should compute the problem in the center-of-momentum frame, but that might complicate things further.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is negligible, so we can assume that the products have zero net momentum, but that would only be the case if the initial system's momentum is zero, which it isn't. So that can't be.

Another approach: Let's assume that the products are moving in such a way that their momenta cancel each other, except for a small component that matches the initial momentum. But this might not be the case.

Wait, perhaps the initial momentum is not zero, but the products' momenta are arranged symmetrically except for some adjustments due to the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering the initial momentum, which would be the case if the antiproton's velocity is so small that its contribution to the initial momentum is negligible. But in that case, the products' momenta would have to sum to zero, which would imply that their velocities are arranged in such a way that their momenta cancel each other.

But I'm stuck. Let's try another approach.

Let me think about the situation where the initial system's momentum is zero. That would be the case if the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other with equal and opposite velocities. But in this problem, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly, so initial momentum is not zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved in the rest frame of the proton, where the initial momentum is that of the antiproton. But in that case, the final products would have to have a net momentum equal to the initial antiproton's momentum.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the problem in the center-of-momentum frame, where the total initial momentum is zero. But since the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving, the center-of-momentum frame would have a different velocity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved without considering the initial momentum, treating the system as if it's at rest, which would not be accurate but perhaps acceptable for the sake of the problem.

But if I proceed under that assumption (ignoring initial momentum), then the products must have zero net momentum, which would require their momenta to cancel each other. So, for example, two A⁺ moving in one direction and two A⁻ moving in the opposite direction, each pair with the same speed, so their momenta cancel each other.

In that case, the total momentum of the products would be zero, which would match the initial momentum if the initial system's momentum is zero. But in reality, the initial system's momentum isn't zero.

Hmm, but perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the initial momentum, considering that the antiproton is moving slowly, so its momentum is negligible. So, the products' total momentum can be considered as zero, leading to the same conclusion as earlier: gamma ≈ 1.5633 and v ≈ 0.768c.

But earlier, when I tried to include the momentum, I ended up with a contradiction because beta_p came out to be greater than 1. So, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the initial momentum, treating the system as if it's at rest, and thus proceed with the earlier calculation, leading to the answer A) 0.77c.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup, and the correct approach is to ignore the initial momentum, leading to the 0.77c answer.

But let me think again. If the initial momentum is negligible, then the products' momenta must cancel each other, leading to a scenario where the products are moving symmetrically, so their velocities are such that their momenta sum to zero. In this case, the energy calculation gives us v ≈ 0.768c, which is option A.

But why did considering the initial momentum lead to a problem? Because when I included the momentum, I got a result that's impossible, which suggests that perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the initial momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is negligible, and the products' velocities are such that their momenta are symmetric, leading to the same result as before.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 0.77c.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the initial approach by not considering the direction of the momenta. Let me check again.

Wait, considering that the initial momentum is p_initial = m_p v_p (since gamma_p ≈ 1), and the final momentum is 4 gamma_A m_A v_A (assuming all A's move in the same direction), then:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = m_p v_p.

But from the energy equation, 4 gamma_A m_A c² = 2 m_p c² → gamma_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) ) = (m_p)/(2 m_A) ) = (938)/(2*300) ≈ 1.5633.

So, gamma_A is about 1.5633, leading to v_A ≈ 0.768c.

But then, substituting into the momentum equation:

4 * 1.5633 * 300 * 0.768 c = m_p v_p.

So, left side: 4 * 1.5633 * 300 * 0.768 ≈ 4 * 1.5633 * 229.8 → 4 * (1.5633 * 229.8) → 4 * 360. → Approximately 1440.

So, 1440 c = 938 v_p → v_p ≈ (1440 /938 ) c ≈ 1.535c → which is impossible.

So, this suggests that the assumption that all A's are moving in the same direction is invalid. Therefore, the initial approach is incorrect.

Hmm, maybe the products move in such a way that their momenta are balanced. Maybe two move in one direction and two in the opposite, leading to a net momentum that equals the initial momentum.

Let me model that.

Let’s say that two A's are moving in the same direction as the initial momentum (the antiproton's direction), each with velocity v, and two are moving in the opposite direction, each with velocity u.

So, the total momentum is:

P_final = 2 * gamma_v m_A v - 2 * gamma_u m_A u.

This should equal the initial momentum, which is m_p v_p.

Energy conservation:

Total energy of the products is 2 * gamma_v m_A c² + 2 * gamma_u m_A c² = E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

But this is getting more complicated, with multiple variables. Perhaps it's better to assume that all four A's have the same speed, but two are moving in the same direction and two in the opposite, leading to a net momentum.

Wait, if two are moving in the same direction, and two in the opposite, their velocities are v and -v (relative to the same frame), then the total momentum is 2 gamma v m_A v + 2 gamma (-v) m_A (-v) → wait, no, that's not right because the directions matter. Let me clarify:

Each A's momentum is gamma m_A v, where v is the velocity. So, for two A's moving in the +x direction, their momenta are +gamma m_A v each. For two moving in the -x direction, their momenta are -gamma m_A u each, where u is their speed. Wait, but if they're moving in opposite directions, their velocities are v and -u. Hmm, perhaps it's better to let both have the same speed magnitude but opposite directions, so v and -v.

So, their momenta would be: 2 * gamma m_A v (for +v) and 2 * gamma m_A (-v) (for -v). So, the total momentum is zero. But that's only possible if the initial momentum is zero, which it's not. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps the two pairs have different speeds. Let me assume that two A's have speed v in the +x direction, and two have speed u in the -x direction. Then, the total momentum is 2 gamma_v m_A v - 2 gamma_u m_A u = m_p v_p.

The energy equation is 2 gamma_v m_A c² + 2 gamma_u m_A c² = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

But this introduces more variables. It's getting too complicated, perhaps beyond the scope of the problem. So, perhaps the problem expects us to neglect the initial momentum, leading to the earlier velocity of 0.77c, option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial momentum is negligible, so the products can have symmetric momenta, leading to v ≈ 0.77c.

But earlier, when I included the initial momentum, I got an impossible result, which suggests that the initial approach is invalid.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another angle. Let's assume that the initial system is at rest, which would mean the proton and antiproton are moving towards each other with equal and opposite velocities. But the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, implying that perhaps the system isn't at rest, but the proton is stationary, and the antiproton is moving towards it.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total energy and momentum in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v_p.

In that case:

Total initial energy E_initial = m_p c² + gamma_p m_p c².

Total initial momentum P_initial = gamma_p m_p v_p.

After annihilation, the four A particles have energies E_A each, and momenta p_A each, in various directions.

But this is getting really complicated, and perhaps beyond the intended approach of the problem.

Given the time I've spent and the options provided, perhaps the intended approach is to ignore the initial momentum and calculate the velocity based on energy conservation alone, leading to v ≈ 0.77c, option A.


The problem involves the annihilation process:

\[
p + \bar{p} \rightarrow 2A^+ + 2A^-
\]

where the antiproton is moving slowly, and the rest energy of each particle \( A \) is given as \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \). The goal is to determine the velocity of particle \( A \).

### Key Analysis

1. **Initial Energy and Momentum**:
   - The proton is stationary, so its energy is \( m_p c^2 \).
   - The antiproton is moving slowly, so its energy is approximately \( \gamma_p m_p c^2 \), where \( \gamma_p \approx 1 \) because \( v_p \ll c \).
   - Total initial energy: 
     \[
     E_{\text{initial}} = m_p c^2 + \gamma_p m_p c^2 \approx 2 m_p c^2
     \]
   - Total initial momentum is small because the antiproton is moving slowly: 
     \[
     P_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_p m_p v_p \approx m_p v_p
     \]

2. **Final Energy and Momentum**:
   - The products are four \( A \)-particles: two \( A^+ \) and two \( A^- \).
   - Rest energy of each \( A \)-particle: \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \).
   - Total rest energy of the products: 
     \[
     4 m_A c^2 = 4 \times 300 \, \text{MeV} = 1200 \, \text{MeV}
     \]
   - Total energy of the products: 
     \[
     E_{\text{final}} = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2
     \]
   - Momentum of each \( A \)-particle: \( p_A = \gamma_A m_A v_A \).

3. **Energy Conservation**:
   Using conservation of energy:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = E_{\text{final}}
   \]
   Substituting values:
   \[
   2 m_p c^2 = 4 \gamma_A m_A c^2
   \]
   Solving for \( \gamma_A \):
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{2 m_p c^2}{4 m_A c^2} = \frac{m_p}{2 m_A}
   \]
   Substituting \( m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \):
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{938}{2 \times 300} \approx 1.5633
   \]

4. **Relating \( \gamma_A \) to Velocity**:
   The relationship between \( \gamma \) and velocity is:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]
   Rearranging for \( v \):
   \[
   v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( \gamma_A \approx 1.5633 \):
   \[
   v \approx c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(1.5633)^2}} \approx c \sqrt{1 - 0.4096} \approx c \sqrt{0.5904} \approx 0.768c
   \]

5. **Matching to Options**:
   The calculated velocity \( v \approx 0.768c \) is closest to option **A) 0.77c**.

### Conclusion

The velocity of particle \( A \) is approximately \( 0.77c \). This result assumes the initial momentum is negligible due to the slow motion of the antiproton and focuses on energy conservation to determine the velocity.
