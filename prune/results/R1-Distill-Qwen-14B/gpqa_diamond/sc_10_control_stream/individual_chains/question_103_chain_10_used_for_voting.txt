Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down.

The target molecule has a nitro group and a bromine substituent on the benzene ring, and a ketone group attached. The ketone is ethan-1-one, so that's a methyl group attached to the benzene and then a carbonyl. Wait, no—ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO, so it's a benzene ring with a ketone (C=O) attached, right? Oh wait, no, wait. Ethan-1-one is actually (CH3)CO-, so the structure is Ar-C(O)-CH3. Wait, wait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, ethan-1-one is acetone, which is (CH3)2CO. Wait, no: ethan-1-one would be CH3CHO, which is acetaldehyde, but that doesn't make sense as a ketone. Oh, wait no, maybe I'm thinking wrong. Let me correct. Ethan-1-one is actually CH3COCH3, acetone. So the structure is a benzene ring with an acetone group attached. So the benzene is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O), which is connected to two methyl groups? No, wait, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-... No, wait. Structure of ethan-1-one: the carbonyl is at position 1 of ethane. So, it's CH3-C(=O)-CH2-? No, that can't be right because ethane is two carbons. Oh wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the numbering. Ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. So the structure is a benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group that's connected to two methyl groups. So the benzene has a (COCH3) group attached. So the substituents are nitro, bromine, and the ketone.

Wait, but the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the structure is a phenyl group (the phenyl ring) attached to ethan-1-one. Wait, wait, no, the other way around. The ethan-1-one is attached to the benzene. So it's a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5, and a ketone (acetone) group at position 1. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are on the benzene ring, and the ketone is attached as a side chain.

Wait, I think I should draw this mentally. The benzene ring has three substituents:

- At position 1: the ketone group (like an acetophenone group, so a benzene ring with a ketone, like Ar-CO-CH3). Wait, no, wait. Ethan-1-one would be (CH3)2CO, so the structure is (CH3)2CO- attached to the benzene. So the benzene has a substituent which is a ketone: the benzene is attached to a carbonyl group that's connected to two methyl groups. That's called acetophenone. So the target is a substituted acetophenone, where the benzene ring has nitro and bromo groups in specific positions.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the acetophenone group is attached to the benzene ring, which has bromine at position 3 and nitro at position 5. So the benzene has substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and the acetophenone group is at position 1.

So the substituents are in the order: substituents at 1,3,5 positions? Wait, no, because in benzene, numbering starts with the substituent that gives the lowest numbers. But in the target, the substituents are at 3-bromo and 5-nitro, so the acetophenone must be at position 1. So the structure is benzene with substituents at 1 (the ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). No, wait, wait. Wait, when numbering, the substituents should be numbered in such a way that the numbers are as low as possible. So if the acetophenone is at position 1, and Br at 3, and NO2 at 5, that's three substituents. Alternatively, if the acetophenone is at position 2, then Br at 4 and NO2 at 6, but that might complicate things.

But perhaps I should think about the synthesis steps.

The starting material is benzene. We need to introduce substituents in the correct positions.

The target has three substituents on benzene: a ketone group (from acetophenone), a bromine, and a nitro group, all in the 1,3,5 positions (I think). Wait, no. Let me think: the benzene has three substituents. The acetophenone group is in position 1, Br in 3, and nitro in 5. So 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene.

Wait, but how do we get those substituents in the correct positions? Because when introducing substituents, the order matters, as each substitution can direct the next.

So the plan is to first introduce a group that directs the next substituent to the right position.

Let's think about the substituents and their directing effects.

Nitro is a meta director. Bromine can be ortho/para if it's a substituent that's activating (like Br in benzene), but wait, Br is an ortho/para director but deactivating. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta director.

The acetophenone group is an activating group? Wait, acetophenone is an aryl ketone. The ketone is a meta director because it's electron-withdrawing (due to the carbonyl group), so it's a deactivating, meta-directing group.

So the order of substitution is important.

Wait, the target has three substituents: Br, nitro, and the ketone.

So perhaps we can first introduce one substituent, then another, ensuring that each new substituent is added in the correct position relative to the existing ones.

But wait, the ketone is a substituent that's introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group, as it's an electrophilic substitution. If the ring is deactivated, Friedel-Crafts won't work, because the ring is not activated enough.

So maybe the ketone group (the acetophenone) must be introduced early, before any deactivating groups are added.

Alternatively, perhaps nitration and bromination can be done before the acylation.

Wait, but nitration and bromination are both deactivating. Once those groups are present, Friedel-Crafts acylation may not proceed.

Hmm, that suggests that the acetophenone group should be introduced early, before the nitro and bromine groups.

Wait, let me think step by step.

We start with benzene.

Option 1: Introduce the ketone first.

So, benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone.

Now, we have a meta-directing group (the ketone). So the next substituent (say, nitro) would go into the meta position relative to the ketone. Then, the bromine would go into another meta position, but perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, the target has three substituents, but perhaps the acetophenone is in position 1, nitro in 5, and bromine in 3.

Wait, but let me think about the order.

If I start with benzene, and first do Friedel-Crafts acylation to get acetophenone (position 1). Then, nitration. Since the ketone is meta-directing, the nitro group would go into position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3. Then, bromination would occur where?

Wait, perhaps the nitration would go into the meta position relative to the ketone, which is position 3. Then, brominating would be directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director, and it's a strong deactivator. So after adding nitro at position 3, the ring is very deactivating. Then, adding bromine would be difficult because the ring is deactivated. Also, the presence of nitro would direct incoming substituents to the meta position relative to itself.

Alternatively, perhaps I should introduce the nitro group first, then the ketone, but then the ring is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts may not work.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Maybe install the nitro group and the bromine in such a way that they are in the correct positions relative to each other and the ketone.

Wait, perhaps nitration comes first.

Wait, let me think of the target: the substituents are at positions 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So the three substituents are in the 1,3,5 positions, which are all meta to each other. So when adding substituents, each new substituent needs to be placed in the meta position relative to the previously added group.

Wait, but if you have a benzene ring and first add a nitro group, then the next substituent (like Br) would go into the meta position relative to nitro, and the third substituent would go into the meta position relative to both.

Wait, perhaps the order of adding substituents must be such that each new group is added in the correct position relative to the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is added last, but then Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group, which is not present if the ring is already deactivated by nitro and bromine.

So that approach doesn't work. So the ketone must be added early, before any deactivating groups.

So first, add the ketone via Friedel-Crafts.

Then, add nitro group, which would go meta to the ketone.

Then, add bromine, which would go meta to the nitro group, but that position might not be in the desired spot.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added first. Wait, but nitration is a strong deactivator. If I nitrate benzene first, then do Friedel-Crafts acylation.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. Nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't work after nitration. So that won't work.

So, the only possible way is to introduce the ketone first, then nitro in the meta position, then bromine in another position. But wait, after nitration, the ring is deactivating, so bromination would be difficult. Or perhaps, if the bromine is introduced via a different method.

Alternatively, maybe use a directing group approach.

Wait, perhaps another approach: introduce the bromine in a position that will direct the nitro group and the ketone correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the ketone and bromine.

Wait, let me think again. The target has three substituents: ketone (position 1), Br (3), and NO2 (5). So 1,3,5 positions on the benzene.

Each substituent must be added in a way that directs the next substituent to the correct position.

First substituent: perhaps the ketone is added first, as it's a meta director.

So, after adding the ketone (position 1), the next substituent (nitro) would be added in the meta position, which is position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3.

Then, the next substituent (Br) would be added in the meta position relative to the nitro group, which is position 5. So that would place the Br at position 5. Wait, but wait, the nitro is at 3, so meta to that would be positions 6 and 2? No, wait, benzene is a ring. Let me number the ring with ketone at position 1, nitro at 3. Then, positions 5 is meta to position 3? Wait, position 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4. The meta position to 3 would be 6 and 2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the order is to add the ketone, then Br, then nitro, ensuring each is added in the correct position.

Wait, starting with benzene.

Step 1: Friedel-Crafts acylation to introduce ketone (position 1).

Now, the ring has a ketone group, which is meta-directing.

Step 2: Introduce Br. Since the ketone is meta-directing, Br will go into position 3 or 5.

Wait, perhaps position 3. So benzene → acetophenone → bromination at position 3.

Now, the ring has substituents at 1 (ketone) and 3 (Br).

Next, nitration. The directing effects will be from both substituents.

The ketone is at 1, which is meta-directing, so meta is 4. But the Br is at 3, which is ortho/para-directing.

Wait, but Br is deactivating (so meta for nitration?), but wait, Br is an ortho/para director, but deactivating. So when you have multiple substituents, the strongest directing group takes precedence.

Wait, the nitration step: the ring has a ketone (meta director) and Br (ortho/para, but deactivating). Which group is stronger?

The nitration is a meta-directing group (the ketone) is a strong deactivating group, but the Br is also deactivating but ortho/para-directing. Which will dominate?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents' directing effects can be considered in terms of their activating or deactivating nature. The ketone is deactivating, making the ring less reactive, while Br is also deactivating but perhaps less so.

Wait, but I might be getting this wrong. Maybe the nitro group is a stronger deactivator than the ketone.

But in any case, after adding Br, when nitrating, the ring has two substituents: ketone at 1, Br at 3.

Nitration will be directed by both. The ketone is meta, directing to position 4 or 5. The Br at 3 is ortho/para, directing to 2 and 4 (since position 3 has ortho as 2 and 4). So the possible positions for nitration are 4 (since it's meta for ketone and ortho for Br) or perhaps 5 (meta for ketone and para for Br).

Wait, perhaps the nitration occurs at position 5, which is meta to the ketone (1 → 4, 5, 6? Wait, no, meta to 1 is 3 and 5. So if the ketone is at 1, meta positions are 3 and 5.

But the Br is at 3, so position 3 is already occupied. So nitration would occur at position 5, which is meta to ketone and para to Br.

So that would give the substituents at 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Which matches the target.

But then, when would the nitro group be added? After the Br.

So the sequence would be: acetophenone → bromination at 3 → nitration at 5.

But wait, after adding the ketone and Br, can we nitrate the ring?

Because the ring has a ketone (deactivating, meta) and Br (deactivating, ortho/para). So nitration might be possible, but it's a strong acid condition (H2SO4), which could be problematic if the ring is too deactivated.

Alternatively, perhaps the order should be: first nitration, then ketone, then bromine. But wait, that would require Friedel-Crafts after nitration, which is difficult because nitro is deactivating.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to nitrate first, then brominate, and then do Friedel-Crafts. But again, Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups, which wouldn't be present after nitration.

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the target has three substituents. Maybe two of them can be introduced via electrophilic substitution, and the third via a different method.

Alternatively, perhaps use a directing group that allows all substituents to be introduced.

Wait, perhaps first, nitrate the benzene to get nitrobenzene. Then, brominate it. But then, Friedel-Crafts won't work because the ring is deactivating.

Alternatively, perhaps perform the acylation first, then nitrate, then brominate.

Wait, so:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone.

2. Acetophenone → nitration. Since the ketone is meta-directing, the nitro group would go into position 3 or 5.

3. Then, brominate. Since after nitration, the ring has two substituents: ketone (meta) and nitro (meta). So where would Br go?

Wait, after step 2, the ring has ketone at 1 and nitro at, say, 3.

Now, when adding Br, the directing groups are the ketone (meta) and nitro (meta).

Nitro is a strong meta director, and the ketone is also a meta director.

So the Br would be directed to a position that is meta to both. Wait, but the positions available are 5, maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br would go into position 5, which is meta to the ketone (position 1) and meta to nitro (position 3) as well?

Wait, position 5 is meta to position 3 (since benzene is a ring, positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). So from position 3, meta is 6, but wait, maybe position 6 is meta? Or maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group at 3 would direct incoming Br to positions 1 and 5 as ortho and para. But position 1 is already occupied by the ketone, so Br would go to position 5 (para to nitro at 3).

So in that case, the substituents would be at 1 (ketone), 3 (nitro), 5 (Br). But the target has 3 (Br) and 5 (nitro), so this is the reverse. Hmm, so that's not correct.

Wait, the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So perhaps I need to reverse the order of nitration and bromination.

So, after introducing the ketone, first brominate, then nitrate.

So steps:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone (position 1).

2. Acetophenone → bromination. The ketone is meta-directing, so Br would go into position 3 or 5.

Assuming position 3.

3. Then, nitrate. The ring has ketone (1) and Br (3). Both are meta-directing.

So where would the nitro group go? It can go into position 5, which is meta to position 3 (Br) and position 1 (ketone).

So that would give the desired substituents: 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro).

So that's the correct arrangement. So the steps would be: acylation, bromination, nitration.

But wait, nitration is a reaction that requires a strong acid, like H2SO4, and nitric acid. But after bromination, does the ring still have enough reactivity for nitration?

Because the ketone is deactivating, and Br is also deactivating, the ring after two deactivating groups may not react well with nitration. Because nitration is an electrophilic substitution, and deactivating groups make the ring less reactive.

Hmm, so perhaps this approach won't work because the ring is too deactivated after two substituents.

So maybe I need a different approach.

Alternative approach: Introduce substituents in a way that activating groups are present when needed.

Wait, another idea: Maybe use a directing group that's introduced and then removed later.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced last. But then, Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group, which might not be present.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the ketone and bromine groups. But wait, how?

Wait, perhaps the bromine is added last. Let's think:

1. Benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene.

But Friedel-Crafts won't work on nitrobenzene because the ring is deactivating.

So, that's not possible.

Wait, another approach: Maybe use a directing group that becomes a good leaving group. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, thinking about the options given in the multiple-choice.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with a sequence of reactions.

Looking at the options, each has multiple steps. Let me look at each option.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. Since the acetophenone is meta-directing, Br would go into position 3 or 5.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, the ring has substituents at 1 (ketone), and 3 or 5 (Br). Nitration would be directed by both.

Wait, after steps i and ii, the substituents are at 1 (ketone) and 3 (Br). Now, step iii is nitration.

The ketone is meta-directing, and Br is ortho/para-directing.

In this case, the stronger directing group would determine where the nitro group goes. Since the ketone is deactivating, it's a stronger director than Br (which is also deactivating but ortho/para). Wait, but I'm not sure which is stronger.

But perhaps the nitration occurs at position 5, which is meta to the ketone and para to Br.

So after nitration, the substituents would be at 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro). That matches the target.

Then, what's the rest of the steps in option A?

iv) Fe/HCl → this is a reduction, perhaps to reduce nitro to amine? But wait, the target doesn't have an amine. So maybe this isn't the right path.

Wait, that's more steps than needed. Option A has seven steps. Let's see.

After step iii, we have the target, but option A continues.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine: so now substituents are Br, amine, and ketone.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again? But that would add another nitro group, which isn't needed.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, which is for making diazonium salts. But why would that be needed here?

vii) H3PO2 → this is a reagent used for controlled reduction, perhaps for nitro groups to amines without full reduction. Or maybe to reduce ketones? No, H3PO2 is typically for reducing nitro groups to amines under certain conditions.

But in any case, this seems to go beyond what's needed. So option A may not be correct.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination of benzene to bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Bromobenzene is ortho/para-directing. So nitro would go into ortho or para to Br.

Then, iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. But if the ring has Br and nitro, which are deactivating, the Friedel-Crafts may not proceed. So this step may not work.

So option B probably doesn't work because the Friedel-Crafts step (iii) would fail due to deactivating groups.

Option C:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine. So now we have aniline.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. But aniline is highly activating, so the acylation would occur. But wait, when you have an amine group (activating), Friedel-Crafts would substitute. But wait, aniline is a strong activating group, so the acylation would occur at ortho or para to the amine.

Then, iv) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. But the ring now has an amine and ketone. The amine is strongly activating, so Br would go into ortho or para to the amine.

Wait, but this seems to lead away from the desired substitution pattern.

The target has substituents at 1,3,5. So perhaps this option isn't correct.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine, giving aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the amine to form diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2 → this would typically reduce the diazonium salt, but wait, H3PO2 is used for controlled reductions. Alternatively, perhaps it's used in the presence of a diazonium salt under cold conditions to form a phenol? Wait, but I think under certain conditions, H3PO2 can be used to reduce nitro groups to amines without over-reducing.

Wait, perhaps in option D, the steps are: nitrate, reduce to amine, diazotize, then reduce. But I'm not sure how this would lead to the desired product.

Alternatively, perhaps after diazotization, the group is replaced, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think. After i and ii, we have aniline. Step iii would form the diazonium salt. Step iv could be a coupling reaction, but I don't know the details.

Alternatively, perhaps D's steps don't lead to the desired substitution pattern.

So, going back, perhaps the correct sequence is to first acylate, then brominate, then nitrate.

Which would correspond to option A's first three steps, but then why does option A have more steps?

Wait, looking at option A:

Steps i, ii, iii would produce the target structure. But then why steps iv to vii?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Because the initial steps may not be sufficient.

Wait, perhaps the nitration step in option A (iii) doesn't come after the bromination.

Wait, in option A, the steps after iii are:

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → reduce.

That seems to be a way to nitrate twice, which isn't needed. So perhaps option A isn't the correct path.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck because I'm not considering the specific reagents. Let me think about each option thoroughly.

The target requires three substituents: ketone, Br, and nitro in positions 1,3,5.

Option A: 

i) Acylation → ketone at 1.

ii) Bromination → Br at 3 (since ketone is meta-directing).

iii) Nitration → nitro at 5 (meta to ketone and para to Br).

So after three steps, we have the correct substituents. Then, why are there more steps in option A?

The additional steps (iv) to vii) may not be needed, which suggests that option A isn't the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the actual synthesis requires more steps because substituents can't be introduced in the correct order without some intermediate steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro and Br groups are introduced in a different order.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the nitro group is introduced via a different mechanism, like using a diazonium salt.

Wait, perhaps after introducing the Br, the nitro group is introduced via some other method.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, perhaps only one of them correctly orders the acylation, bromination, and nitration in the correct positions.

Option C:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Acylation → acetophenone, which would be at position 3 or 5, being meta to the amine.

But then, after that, iv) Br2/FeBr3 → Br would be added ortho/para to the amine (which is now at position 1), leading to Br at positions 2 or 4.

This doesn't give the correct substitution pattern.

Option D:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Reduce to amine.

iii) Diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps the diazonium group is replaced with a different substituent.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

vi) Acylation.

But that seems unlikely to lead to the correct positions.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to acylate, nitrate, brominate.

But when would that be possible?

Wait, let me think about that.

Benzene → acylation → acetophenone (1).

Then nitrate → nitro at 3 or 5 (meta to ketone).

Then brominate → Br would be directed by both ketone and nitro.

Wait, if nitro is at 3, then when brominating, the Br would be directed to position 5 (meta to ketone, which is at 1, and para to nitro at 3).

That would give the correct substituents.

So the steps would be:

i) Acylation.

ii) Nitration.

iii) Bromination.

Looking at the options, which option has this order?

Looking at option A: steps i, ii, iii are acylation, bromination, nitration. So that's not the order I want.

Option C: steps i is nitration, which would not work because Friedel-Crafts won't proceed afterward.

Option D: steps i is nitration, which again, not useful.

So perhaps none of the options directly follow this order, but perhaps one of them does.

Wait, option C:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces to amine.

iii) Acylation → acetophenone at position 3 (meta to amine).

iv) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate, which would go ortho/para to the amine, so positions 2 or 4.

But that would place the Br in the wrong position.

So perhaps this isn't the correct path.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to acylate, nitrate, brominate, as I thought earlier.

Looking back at the options, perhaps none of the options A-D have that order, but perhaps another way.

Wait, perhaps the bromine is introduced via a different method, such as using a directing group.

Alternatively, perhaps after acylation and nitration, the bromine can be introduced via a benzyne intermediate or via some other method.

But I'm not sure if that's covered in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, despite the extra steps, because the initial steps (i, ii, iii) are correct.

But why would the remaining steps be present? Maybe they're a distraction.

Looking at option A, steps iv to vii involve reduction and nitration, which might be superfluous. So perhaps the first three steps are sufficient, but the option includes more steps because perhaps the nitration isn't in the correct position.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently.

The target requires the substituents in the 1,3,5 positions. So the ketone is at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5.

The correct sequence would be:

1. Acylate benzene → ketone at 1.

2. Brominate → Br at 3 (meta to ketone).

3. Nitrate → nitro at 5 (meta to ketone, para to Br).

Which would give the correct structure.

Looking at the options, does any option have these three steps in order?

Option A: steps i, ii, iii are acylation, bromination, nitration → which would give the correct substituents.

So after step iii, the molecule is the target.

But why does option A have more steps?

Looking at the option A steps:

i) Acylation → correct.

ii) Bromination → correct.

iii) Nitration → correct.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine. But the target doesn't have an amine.

So perhaps the option A is incorrect because steps iv onward would change the substituents.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but only the first three steps are needed, and the rest are extra.

But the question states that the sequence of reactions should lead to the target, so all steps must be part of the correct synthesis.

Alternatively, perhaps the given options have an error, but assuming the options are correct, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nitration in step iii doesn't occur as intended because the ring is too deactivated by the ketone and Br.

In that case, the nitration may not proceed, so the synthesis wouldn't work.

So, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, maybe the nitro group is introduced first, but that requires activating groups, which aren't present.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is introduced via a benzyne mechanism, but that's probably beyond the scope of this question.

Wait, I think I've spent too much time on this. Given the options, the only sequence that correctly adds the substituents in the right order (acylate, brominate, then nitrate) is option A.

But wait, let me check the steps in option A.

Option A:

i) Acylation → acetophenone.

ii) Bromination → Br at 3.

iii) Nitration → nitro at 5.

Then, steps iv) to vii) involve Fe/HCl, nitration again, diazotization, and H3PO2.

These steps don't make sense for the target structure because they would add more nitro groups or change substituents.

So perhaps option A isn't correct.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option B?

Wait, let me check option B.

Option B:

i) Bromination → bromobenzene.

ii) Nitration → nitro at para to Br (position 4, assuming bromine at position 1).

But that's assuming Br is at position 1, which it would be after bromination of benzene.

Then, step iii is acylation → acetophenone, which would go meta to the nitro group (position 4 → meta would be position 1 and 7? Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So position 4's meta would be 1 and 6.

But position 1 is already occupied by Br (if bromine is at 1), so acylation would go to position 6.

But then, substituents are at 1 (Br), 4 (nitro), 6 (ketone).

Which doesn't match the target.

So option B's steps don't lead to the desired product.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order of nitration and bromination.

Wait, another approach: introduce the nitro group first, then the ketone, but then how to get the bromine in the correct position.

Wait, as I thought earlier, nitration first is problematic because Friedel-Crafts won't proceed afterward.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced, then nitro, then bromine.

But that would require that after nitro and ketone, the bromine can be added.

But if the ring has both nitro and ketone, which are deactivating, adding bromine via electrophilic substitution may not be feasible.

So perhaps this isn't the right path.

At this point, I think the correct option is A, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, looking back at the target, it's 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.

Which corresponds to the substituents at 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), 5 (NO2). So the correct order of substitution is ketone first, then bromine (meta to ketone), then nitro (meta to ketone and para to bromine).

So the steps would be:

1. Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone.

2. Bromination → Br at 3.

3. Nitration → nitro at 5.

Looking at the options, only option A has these three steps in order.

So option A's steps i, ii, iii would lead to the target.

But then, why does option A have additional steps? Maybe the other steps are not part of the correct synthesis, but perhaps the question asks for the entire sequence, including some work-up steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial steps are correct, but then the other steps modify the substituents, which isn't desired.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, because the first three steps suffice, but the rest are incorrect, so the entire option isn't the correct path. So perhaps the correct answer is not A.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a diazonium salt.

So, steps:

1. Acetophenone.

2. Introduce an amino group in a position that would allow nitration in the correct position.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I don't see how.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a nitration after the ketone and bromine are in place.

But as I thought earlier, after two deactivating groups, nitration is difficult.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but that's the only option where the substituents are added in the right order.

So, after step iii of option A, the target is achieved. But perhaps the other steps don't affect the substituents, or maybe they're just distractors.

Alternatively, perhaps the other steps are necessary for some other reason.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the bromine is introduced via a different method that doesn't rely on electrophilic substitution.

But the options only show bromination with FeBr3, which is electrophilic.

Hmm.

I think I've spent a lot of time on this. Based on the earlier reasoning, the correct sequence is acylation, bromination, nitration, which corresponds to option A's steps i, ii, iii. So the correct answer is option A.

To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the target molecule has three substituents: a ketone group at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5. These substituents must be introduced in a specific order to achieve the desired 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene structure.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group at position 1.
   - **Step ii**: Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the ketone, as the ketone is a meta-directing group).
   - **Step iii**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group at position 5 (meta to the ketone and para to the bromine).
   - After these three steps, the target molecule is formed. However, the additional steps (iv–vii) in this option involve reducing the nitro group to an amine, re-nitrating, diazotizing, and reducing again, which are unnecessary and would alter the desired product. Despite this, the first three steps are correct.

2. **Option B**:
   - **Step i**: Bromination introduces bromine at position 1.
   - **Step ii**: Nitration adds the nitro group at position 4 (ortho/para to bromine).
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone at position 6 (meta to the nitro group and para to bromine).
   - This results in the substituents being at positions 1 (bromine), 4 (nitro), and 6 (ketone), which does not match the target structure.

3. **Option C**:
   - **Step i**: Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 1.
   - **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone at position 3 (meta to the amine).
   - **Step iv**: Bromination adds bromine at position 2 or 4 (ortho/para to the amine).
   - This does not result in the correct substitution pattern for the target molecule.

4. **Option D**:
   - **Step i**: Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 1.
   - **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
   - **Step iii**: Diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl forms a diazonium salt.
   - **Step iv**: Reduction with H₃PO₂ modifies the diazonium salt, but this sequence does not lead to the correct substitution pattern for the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions to synthesize the target molecule is acylation, bromination, and nitration, which corresponds to the first three steps of **Option A**. While the additional steps in Option A are unnecessary, this option is the only one that correctly introduces the substituents in the required order.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. Hmm, let's break this down.

The target molecule has a nitro group and a bromine substituent on the benzene ring, and a ketone group attached. The ketone is ethan-1-one, so that's a methyl group attached to the benzene and then a carbonyl. Wait, no—ethan-1-one is (CH3)CO, so it's a benzene ring with a ketone (C=O) attached, right? Oh wait, no, wait. Ethan-1-one is actually (CH3)CO-, so the structure is Ar-C(O)-CH3. Wait, wait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, ethan-1-one is acetone, which is (CH3)2CO. Wait, no: ethan-1-one would be CH3CHO, which is acetaldehyde, but that doesn't make sense as a ketone. Oh, wait no, maybe I'm thinking wrong. Let me correct. Ethan-1-one is actually CH3COCH3, acetone. So the structure is a benzene ring with an acetone group attached. So the benzene is connected to a carbonyl group (C=O), which is connected to two methyl groups? No, wait, wait. Wait, ethan-1-one is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-... No, wait. Structure of ethan-1-one: the carbonyl is at position 1 of ethane. So, it's CH3-C(=O)-CH2-? No, that can't be right because ethane is two carbons. Oh wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the numbering. Ethan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, which is acetone. So the structure is a benzene ring connected to a carbonyl group that's connected to two methyl groups. So the benzene has a (COCH3) group attached. So the substituents are nitro, bromine, and the ketone.

Wait, but the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the structure is a phenyl group (the phenyl ring) attached to ethan-1-one. Wait, wait, no, the other way around. The ethan-1-one is attached to the benzene. So it's a benzene ring with substituents at positions 3 and 5, and a ketone (acetone) group at position 1. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are on the benzene ring, and the ketone is attached as a side chain.

Wait, I think I should draw this mentally. The benzene ring has three substituents:

- At position 1: the ketone group (like an acetophenone group, so a benzene ring with a ketone, like Ar-CO-CH3). Wait, no, wait. Ethan-1-one would be (CH3)2CO, so the structure is (CH3)2CO- attached to the benzene. So the benzene has a substituent which is a ketone: the benzene is attached to a carbonyl group that's connected to two methyl groups. That's called acetophenone. So the target is a substituted acetophenone, where the benzene ring has nitro and bromo groups in specific positions.

Wait, the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So the acetophenone group is attached to the benzene ring, which has bromine at position 3 and nitro at position 5. So the benzene has substituents at positions 3 (Br) and 5 (NO2), and the acetophenone group is at position 1.

So the substituents are in the order: substituents at 1,3,5 positions? Wait, no, because in benzene, numbering starts with the substituent that gives the lowest numbers. But in the target, the substituents are at 3-bromo and 5-nitro, so the acetophenone must be at position 1. So the structure is benzene with substituents at 1 (the ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). No, wait, wait. Wait, when numbering, the substituents should be numbered in such a way that the numbers are as low as possible. So if the acetophenone is at position 1, and Br at 3, and NO2 at 5, that's three substituents. Alternatively, if the acetophenone is at position 2, then Br at 4 and NO2 at 6, but that might complicate things.

But perhaps I should think about the synthesis steps.

The starting material is benzene. We need to introduce substituents in the correct positions.

The target has three substituents on benzene: a ketone group (from acetophenone), a bromine, and a nitro group, all in the 1,3,5 positions (I think). Wait, no. Let me think: the benzene has three substituents. The acetophenone group is in position 1, Br in 3, and nitro in 5. So 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene.

Wait, but how do we get those substituents in the correct positions? Because when introducing substituents, the order matters, as each substitution can direct the next.

So the plan is to first introduce a group that directs the next substituent to the right position.

Let's think about the substituents and their directing effects.

Nitro is a meta director. Bromine can be ortho/para if it's a substituent that's activating (like Br in benzene), but wait, Br is an ortho/para director but deactivating. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta director.

The acetophenone group is an activating group? Wait, acetophenone is an aryl ketone. The ketone is a meta director because it's electron-withdrawing (due to the carbonyl group), so it's a deactivating, meta-directing group.

So the order of substitution is important.

Wait, the target has three substituents: Br, nitro, and the ketone.

So perhaps we can first introduce one substituent, then another, ensuring that each new substituent is added in the correct position relative to the existing ones.

But wait, the ketone is a substituent that's introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group, as it's an electrophilic substitution. If the ring is deactivated, Friedel-Crafts won't work, because the ring is not activated enough.

So maybe the ketone group (the acetophenone) must be introduced early, before any deactivating groups are added.

Alternatively, perhaps nitration and bromination can be done before the acylation.

Wait, but nitration and bromination are both deactivating. Once those groups are present, Friedel-Crafts acylation may not proceed.

Hmm, that suggests that the acetophenone group should be introduced early, before the nitro and bromine groups.

Wait, let me think step by step.

We start with benzene.

Option 1: Introduce the ketone first.

So, benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone.

Now, we have a meta-directing group (the ketone). So the next substituent (say, nitro) would go into the meta position relative to the ketone. Then, the bromine would go into another meta position, but perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, the target has three substituents, but perhaps the acetophenone is in position 1, nitro in 5, and bromine in 3.

Wait, but let me think about the order.

If I start with benzene, and first do Friedel-Crafts acylation to get acetophenone (position 1). Then, nitration. Since the ketone is meta-directing, the nitro group would go into position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3. Then, bromination would occur where?

Wait, perhaps the nitration would go into the meta position relative to the ketone, which is position 3. Then, brominating would be directed by the existing substituents.

Wait, but nitro is a meta director, and it's a strong deactivator. So after adding nitro at position 3, the ring is very deactivating. Then, adding bromine would be difficult because the ring is deactivated. Also, the presence of nitro would direct incoming substituents to the meta position relative to itself.

Alternatively, perhaps I should introduce the nitro group first, then the ketone, but then the ring is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts may not work.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Maybe install the nitro group and the bromine in such a way that they are in the correct positions relative to each other and the ketone.

Wait, perhaps nitration comes first.

Wait, let me think of the target: the substituents are at positions 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So the three substituents are in the 1,3,5 positions, which are all meta to each other. So when adding substituents, each new substituent needs to be placed in the meta position relative to the previously added group.

Wait, but if you have a benzene ring and first add a nitro group, then the next substituent (like Br) would go into the meta position relative to nitro, and the third substituent would go into the meta position relative to both.

Wait, perhaps the order of adding substituents must be such that each new group is added in the correct position relative to the existing substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is added last, but then Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group, which is not present if the ring is already deactivated by nitro and bromine.

So that approach doesn't work. So the ketone must be added early, before any deactivating groups.

So first, add the ketone via Friedel-Crafts.

Then, add nitro group, which would go meta to the ketone.

Then, add bromine, which would go meta to the nitro group, but that position might not be in the desired spot.

Wait, perhaps the nitro group is added first. Wait, but nitration is a strong deactivator. If I nitrate benzene first, then do Friedel-Crafts acylation.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. Nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't work after nitration. So that won't work.

So, the only possible way is to introduce the ketone first, then nitro in the meta position, then bromine in another position. But wait, after nitration, the ring is deactivating, so bromination would be difficult. Or perhaps, if the bromine is introduced via a different method.

Alternatively, maybe use a directing group approach.

Wait, perhaps another approach: introduce the bromine in a position that will direct the nitro group and the ketone correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the ketone and bromine.

Wait, let me think again. The target has three substituents: ketone (position 1), Br (3), and NO2 (5). So 1,3,5 positions on the benzene.

Each substituent must be added in a way that directs the next substituent to the correct position.

First substituent: perhaps the ketone is added first, as it's a meta director.

So, after adding the ketone (position 1), the next substituent (nitro) would be added in the meta position, which is position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3.

Then, the next substituent (Br) would be added in the meta position relative to the nitro group, which is position 5. So that would place the Br at position 5. Wait, but wait, the nitro is at 3, so meta to that would be positions 6 and 2? No, wait, benzene is a ring. Let me number the ring with ketone at position 1, nitro at 3. Then, positions 5 is meta to position 3? Wait, position 3 is adjacent to 2 and 4. The meta position to 3 would be 6 and 2? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the order is to add the ketone, then Br, then nitro, ensuring each is added in the correct position.

Wait, starting with benzene.

Step 1: Friedel-Crafts acylation to introduce ketone (position 1).

Now, the ring has a ketone group, which is meta-directing.

Step 2: Introduce Br. Since the ketone is meta-directing, Br will go into position 3 or 5.

Wait, perhaps position 3. So benzene → acetophenone → bromination at position 3.

Now, the ring has substituents at 1 (ketone) and 3 (Br).

Next, nitration. The directing effects will be from both substituents.

The ketone is at 1, which is meta-directing, so meta is 4. But the Br is at 3, which is ortho/para-directing.

Wait, but Br is deactivating (so meta for nitration?), but wait, Br is an ortho/para director, but deactivating. So when you have multiple substituents, the strongest directing group takes precedence.

Wait, the nitration step: the ring has a ketone (meta director) and Br (ortho/para, but deactivating). Which group is stronger?

The nitration is a meta-directing group (the ketone) is a strong deactivating group, but the Br is also deactivating but ortho/para-directing. Which will dominate?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents' directing effects can be considered in terms of their activating or deactivating nature. The ketone is deactivating, making the ring less reactive, while Br is also deactivating but perhaps less so.

Wait, but I might be getting this wrong. Maybe the nitro group is a stronger deactivator than the ketone.

But in any case, after adding Br, when nitrating, the ring has two substituents: ketone at 1, Br at 3.

Nitration will be directed by both. The ketone is meta, directing to position 4 or 5. The Br at 3 is ortho/para, directing to 2 and 4 (since position 3 has ortho as 2 and 4). So the possible positions for nitration are 4 (since it's meta for ketone and ortho for Br) or perhaps 5 (meta for ketone and para for Br).

Wait, perhaps the nitration occurs at position 5, which is meta to the ketone (1 → 4, 5, 6? Wait, no, meta to 1 is 3 and 5. So if the ketone is at 1, meta positions are 3 and 5.

But the Br is at 3, so position 3 is already occupied. So nitration would occur at position 5, which is meta to ketone and para to Br.

So that would give the substituents at 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). Which matches the target.

But then, when would the nitro group be added? After the Br.

So the sequence would be: acetophenone → bromination at 3 → nitration at 5.

But wait, after adding the ketone and Br, can we nitrate the ring?

Because the ring has a ketone (deactivating, meta) and Br (deactivating, ortho/para). So nitration might be possible, but it's a strong acid condition (H2SO4), which could be problematic if the ring is too deactivated.

Alternatively, perhaps the order should be: first nitration, then ketone, then bromine. But wait, that would require Friedel-Crafts after nitration, which is difficult because nitro is deactivating.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to nitrate first, then brominate, and then do Friedel-Crafts. But again, Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups, which wouldn't be present after nitration.

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the target has three substituents. Maybe two of them can be introduced via electrophilic substitution, and the third via a different method.

Alternatively, perhaps use a directing group that allows all substituents to be introduced.

Wait, perhaps first, nitrate the benzene to get nitrobenzene. Then, brominate it. But then, Friedel-Crafts won't work because the ring is deactivating.

Alternatively, perhaps perform the acylation first, then nitrate, then brominate.

Wait, so:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone.

2. Acetophenone → nitration. Since the ketone is meta-directing, the nitro group would go into position 3 or 5.

3. Then, brominate. Since after nitration, the ring has two substituents: ketone (meta) and nitro (meta). So where would Br go?

Wait, after step 2, the ring has ketone at 1 and nitro at, say, 3.

Now, when adding Br, the directing groups are the ketone (meta) and nitro (meta).

Nitro is a strong meta director, and the ketone is also a meta director.

So the Br would be directed to a position that is meta to both. Wait, but the positions available are 5, maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps the Br would go into position 5, which is meta to the ketone (position 1) and meta to nitro (position 3) as well?

Wait, position 5 is meta to position 3 (since benzene is a ring, positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). So from position 3, meta is 6, but wait, maybe position 6 is meta? Or maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group at 3 would direct incoming Br to positions 1 and 5 as ortho and para. But position 1 is already occupied by the ketone, so Br would go to position 5 (para to nitro at 3).

So in that case, the substituents would be at 1 (ketone), 3 (nitro), 5 (Br). But the target has 3 (Br) and 5 (nitro), so this is the reverse. Hmm, so that's not correct.

Wait, the target has Br at 3 and nitro at 5. So perhaps I need to reverse the order of nitration and bromination.

So, after introducing the ketone, first brominate, then nitrate.

So steps:

1. Benzene → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone (position 1).

2. Acetophenone → bromination. The ketone is meta-directing, so Br would go into position 3 or 5.

Assuming position 3.

3. Then, nitrate. The ring has ketone (1) and Br (3). Both are meta-directing.

So where would the nitro group go? It can go into position 5, which is meta to position 3 (Br) and position 1 (ketone).

So that would give the desired substituents: 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro).

So that's the correct arrangement. So the steps would be: acylation, bromination, nitration.

But wait, nitration is a reaction that requires a strong acid, like H2SO4, and nitric acid. But after bromination, does the ring still have enough reactivity for nitration?

Because the ketone is deactivating, and Br is also deactivating, the ring after two deactivating groups may not react well with nitration. Because nitration is an electrophilic substitution, and deactivating groups make the ring less reactive.

Hmm, so perhaps this approach won't work because the ring is too deactivated after two substituents.

So maybe I need a different approach.

Alternative approach: Introduce substituents in a way that activating groups are present when needed.

Wait, another idea: Maybe use a directing group that's introduced and then removed later.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced last. But then, Friedel-Crafts requires an activating group, which might not be present.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro group is introduced after the ketone and bromine groups. But wait, how?

Wait, perhaps the bromine is added last. Let's think:

1. Benzene → nitration → nitrobenzene.

But Friedel-Crafts won't work on nitrobenzene because the ring is deactivating.

So, that's not possible.

Wait, another approach: Maybe use a directing group that becomes a good leaving group. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, thinking about the options given in the multiple-choice.

The options are A, B, C, D, each with a sequence of reactions.

Looking at the options, each has multiple steps. Let me look at each option.

Option A:

i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. Since the acetophenone is meta-directing, Br would go into position 3 or 5.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, the ring has substituents at 1 (ketone), and 3 or 5 (Br). Nitration would be directed by both.

Wait, after steps i and ii, the substituents are at 1 (ketone) and 3 (Br). Now, step iii is nitration.

The ketone is meta-directing, and Br is ortho/para-directing.

In this case, the stronger directing group would determine where the nitro group goes. Since the ketone is deactivating, it's a stronger director than Br (which is also deactivating but ortho/para). Wait, but I'm not sure which is stronger.

But perhaps the nitration occurs at position 5, which is meta to the ketone and para to Br.

So after nitration, the substituents would be at 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), 5 (nitro). That matches the target.

Then, what's the rest of the steps in option A?

iv) Fe/HCl → this is a reduction, perhaps to reduce nitro to amine? But wait, the target doesn't have an amine. So maybe this isn't the right path.

Wait, that's more steps than needed. Option A has seven steps. Let's see.

After step iii, we have the target, but option A continues.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine: so now substituents are Br, amine, and ketone.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration again? But that would add another nitro group, which isn't needed.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization, which is for making diazonium salts. But why would that be needed here?

vii) H3PO2 → this is a reagent used for controlled reduction, perhaps for nitro groups to amines without full reduction. Or maybe to reduce ketones? No, H3PO2 is typically for reducing nitro groups to amines under certain conditions.

But in any case, this seems to go beyond what's needed. So option A may not be correct.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination of benzene to bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Bromobenzene is ortho/para-directing. So nitro would go into ortho or para to Br.

Then, iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. But if the ring has Br and nitro, which are deactivating, the Friedel-Crafts may not proceed. So this step may not work.

So option B probably doesn't work because the Friedel-Crafts step (iii) would fail due to deactivating groups.

Option C:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine. So now we have aniline.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. But aniline is highly activating, so the acylation would occur. But wait, when you have an amine group (activating), Friedel-Crafts would substitute. But wait, aniline is a strong activating group, so the acylation would occur at ortho or para to the amine.

Then, iv) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. But the ring now has an amine and ketone. The amine is strongly activating, so Br would go into ortho or para to the amine.

Wait, but this seems to lead away from the desired substitution pattern.

The target has substituents at 1,3,5. So perhaps this option isn't correct.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene to nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine, giving aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the amine to form diazonium chloride.

iv) H3PO2 → this would typically reduce the diazonium salt, but wait, H3PO2 is used for controlled reductions. Alternatively, perhaps it's used in the presence of a diazonium salt under cold conditions to form a phenol? Wait, but I think under certain conditions, H3PO2 can be used to reduce nitro groups to amines without over-reducing.

Wait, perhaps in option D, the steps are: nitrate, reduce to amine, diazotize, then reduce. But I'm not sure how this would lead to the desired product.

Alternatively, perhaps after diazotization, the group is replaced, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think. After i and ii, we have aniline. Step iii would form the diazonium salt. Step iv could be a coupling reaction, but I don't know the details.

Alternatively, perhaps D's steps don't lead to the desired substitution pattern.

So, going back, perhaps the correct sequence is to first acylate, then brominate, then nitrate.

Which would correspond to option A's first three steps, but then why does option A have more steps?

Wait, looking at option A:

Steps i, ii, iii would produce the target structure. But then why steps iv to vii?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Because the initial steps may not be sufficient.

Wait, perhaps the nitration step in option A (iii) doesn't come after the bromination.

Wait, in option A, the steps after iii are:

iv) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

v) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate again.

vi) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

vii) H3PO2 → reduce.

That seems to be a way to nitrate twice, which isn't needed. So perhaps option A isn't the correct path.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck because I'm not considering the specific reagents. Let me think about each option thoroughly.

The target requires three substituents: ketone, Br, and nitro in positions 1,3,5.

Option A: 

i) Acylation → ketone at 1.

ii) Bromination → Br at 3 (since ketone is meta-directing).

iii) Nitration → nitro at 5 (meta to ketone and para to Br).

So after three steps, we have the correct substituents. Then, why are there more steps in option A?

The additional steps (iv) to vii) may not be needed, which suggests that option A isn't the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the actual synthesis requires more steps because substituents can't be introduced in the correct order without some intermediate steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro and Br groups are introduced in a different order.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the nitro group is introduced via a different mechanism, like using a diazonium salt.

Wait, perhaps after introducing the Br, the nitro group is introduced via some other method.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, perhaps only one of them correctly orders the acylation, bromination, and nitration in the correct positions.

Option C:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduce nitro to amine.

iii) Acylation → acetophenone, which would be at position 3 or 5, being meta to the amine.

But then, after that, iv) Br2/FeBr3 → Br would be added ortho/para to the amine (which is now at position 1), leading to Br at positions 2 or 4.

This doesn't give the correct substitution pattern.

Option D:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Reduce to amine.

iii) Diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps the diazonium group is replaced with a different substituent.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

vi) Acylation.

But that seems unlikely to lead to the correct positions.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to acylate, nitrate, brominate.

But when would that be possible?

Wait, let me think about that.

Benzene → acylation → acetophenone (1).

Then nitrate → nitro at 3 or 5 (meta to ketone).

Then brominate → Br would be directed by both ketone and nitro.

Wait, if nitro is at 3, then when brominating, the Br would be directed to position 5 (meta to ketone, which is at 1, and para to nitro at 3).

That would give the correct substituents.

So the steps would be:

i) Acylation.

ii) Nitration.

iii) Bromination.

Looking at the options, which option has this order?

Looking at option A: steps i, ii, iii are acylation, bromination, nitration. So that's not the order I want.

Option C: steps i is nitration, which would not work because Friedel-Crafts won't proceed afterward.

Option D: steps i is nitration, which again, not useful.

So perhaps none of the options directly follow this order, but perhaps one of them does.

Wait, option C:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → reduces to amine.

iii) Acylation → acetophenone at position 3 (meta to amine).

iv) Br2/FeBr3 → brominate, which would go ortho/para to the amine, so positions 2 or 4.

But that would place the Br in the wrong position.

So perhaps this isn't the correct path.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to acylate, nitrate, brominate, as I thought earlier.

Looking back at the options, perhaps none of the options A-D have that order, but perhaps another way.

Wait, perhaps the bromine is introduced via a different method, such as using a directing group.

Alternatively, perhaps after acylation and nitration, the bromine can be introduced via a benzyne intermediate or via some other method.

But I'm not sure if that's covered in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, despite the extra steps, because the initial steps (i, ii, iii) are correct.

But why would the remaining steps be present? Maybe they're a distraction.

Looking at option A, steps iv to vii involve reduction and nitration, which might be superfluous. So perhaps the first three steps are sufficient, but the option includes more steps because perhaps the nitration isn't in the correct position.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently.

The target requires the substituents in the 1,3,5 positions. So the ketone is at 1, Br at 3, nitro at 5.

The correct sequence would be:

1. Acylate benzene → ketone at 1.

2. Brominate → Br at 3 (meta to ketone).

3. Nitrate → nitro at 5 (meta to ketone, para to Br).

Which would give the correct structure.

Looking at the options, does any option have these three steps in order?

Option A: steps i, ii, iii are acylation, bromination, nitration → which would give the correct substituents.

So after step iii, the molecule is the target.

But why does option A have more steps?

Looking at the option A steps:

i) Acylation → correct.

ii) Bromination → correct.

iii) Nitration → correct.

iv) Fe/HCl → reduces nitro to amine. But the target doesn't have an amine.

So perhaps the option A is incorrect because steps iv onward would change the substituents.

So perhaps the correct answer is option A, but only the first three steps are needed, and the rest are extra.

But the question states that the sequence of reactions should lead to the target, so all steps must be part of the correct synthesis.

Alternatively, perhaps the given options have an error, but assuming the options are correct, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the nitration in step iii doesn't occur as intended because the ring is too deactivated by the ketone and Br.

In that case, the nitration may not proceed, so the synthesis wouldn't work.

So, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, maybe the nitro group is introduced first, but that requires activating groups, which aren't present.

Alternatively, perhaps the bromine is introduced via a benzyne mechanism, but that's probably beyond the scope of this question.

Wait, I think I've spent too much time on this. Given the options, the only sequence that correctly adds the substituents in the right order (acylate, brominate, then nitrate) is option A.

But wait, let me check the steps in option A.

Option A:

i) Acylation → acetophenone.

ii) Bromination → Br at 3.

iii) Nitration → nitro at 5.

Then, steps iv) to vii) involve Fe/HCl, nitration again, diazotization, and H3PO2.

These steps don't make sense for the target structure because they would add more nitro groups or change substituents.

So perhaps option A isn't correct.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is option B?

Wait, let me check option B.

Option B:

i) Bromination → bromobenzene.

ii) Nitration → nitro at para to Br (position 4, assuming bromine at position 1).

But that's assuming Br is at position 1, which it would be after bromination of benzene.

Then, step iii is acylation → acetophenone, which would go meta to the nitro group (position 4 → meta would be position 1 and 7? Wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So position 4's meta would be 1 and 6.

But position 1 is already occupied by Br (if bromine is at 1), so acylation would go to position 6.

But then, substituents are at 1 (Br), 4 (nitro), 6 (ketone).

Which doesn't match the target.

So option B's steps don't lead to the desired product.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the order of nitration and bromination.

Wait, another approach: introduce the nitro group first, then the ketone, but then how to get the bromine in the correct position.

Wait, as I thought earlier, nitration first is problematic because Friedel-Crafts won't proceed afterward.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced, then nitro, then bromine.

But that would require that after nitro and ketone, the bromine can be added.

But if the ring has both nitro and ketone, which are deactivating, adding bromine via electrophilic substitution may not be feasible.

So perhaps this isn't the right path.

At this point, I think the correct option is A, but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, looking back at the target, it's 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one.

Which corresponds to the substituents at 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), 5 (NO2). So the correct order of substitution is ketone first, then bromine (meta to ketone), then nitro (meta to ketone and para to bromine).

So the steps would be:

1. Friedel-Crafts acylation → acetophenone.

2. Bromination → Br at 3.

3. Nitration → nitro at 5.

Looking at the options, only option A has these three steps in order.

So option A's steps i, ii, iii would lead to the target.

But then, why does option A have additional steps? Maybe the other steps are not part of the correct synthesis, but perhaps the question asks for the entire sequence, including some work-up steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial steps are correct, but then the other steps modify the substituents, which isn't desired.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, because the first three steps suffice, but the rest are incorrect, so the entire option isn't the correct path. So perhaps the correct answer is not A.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a diazonium salt.

So, steps:

1. Acetophenone.

2. Introduce an amino group in a position that would allow nitration in the correct position.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but I don't see how.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the nitro group is introduced via a nitration after the ketone and bromine are in place.

But as I thought earlier, after two deactivating groups, nitration is difficult.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but that's the only option where the substituents are added in the right order.

So, after step iii of option A, the target is achieved. But perhaps the other steps don't affect the substituents, or maybe they're just distractors.

Alternatively, perhaps the other steps are necessary for some other reason.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the bromine is introduced via a different method that doesn't rely on electrophilic substitution.

But the options only show bromination with FeBr3, which is electrophilic.

Hmm.

I think I've spent a lot of time on this. Based on the earlier reasoning, the correct sequence is acylation, bromination, nitration, which corresponds to option A's steps i, ii, iii. So the correct answer is option A.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the target molecule has three substituents: a ketone group at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5. These substituents must be introduced in a specific order to achieve the desired 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene structure.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**:
   - **Step i**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group at position 1.
   - **Step ii**: Bromination with Br₂/FeBr₃ adds bromine at position 3 (meta to the ketone, as the ketone is a meta-directing group).
   - **Step iii**: Nitration with HNO₃/H₂SO₄ adds the nitro group at position 5 (meta to the ketone and para to the bromine).
   - After these three steps, the target molecule is formed. However, the additional steps (iv–vii) in this option involve reducing the nitro group to an amine, re-nitrating, diazotizing, and reducing again, which are unnecessary and would alter the desired product. Despite this, the first three steps are correct.

2. **Option B**:
   - **Step i**: Bromination introduces bromine at position 1.
   - **Step ii**: Nitration adds the nitro group at position 4 (ortho/para to bromine).
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone at position 6 (meta to the nitro group and para to bromine).
   - This results in the substituents being at positions 1 (bromine), 4 (nitro), and 6 (ketone), which does not match the target structure.

3. **Option C**:
   - **Step i**: Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 1.
   - **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
   - **Step iii**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone at position 3 (meta to the amine).
   - **Step iv**: Bromination adds bromine at position 2 or 4 (ortho/para to the amine).
   - This does not result in the correct substitution pattern for the target molecule.

4. **Option D**:
   - **Step i**: Nitration introduces the nitro group at position 1.
   - **Step ii**: Reduction with Fe/HCl converts the nitro group to an amine.
   - **Step iii**: Diazotization with NaNO₂/HCl forms a diazonium salt.
   - **Step iv**: Reduction with H₃PO₂ modifies the diazonium salt, but this sequence does not lead to the correct substitution pattern for the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions to synthesize the target molecule is acylation, bromination, and nitration, which corresponds to the first three steps of **Option A**. While the additional steps in Option A are unnecessary, this option is the only one that correctly introduces the substituents in the required order.

**Answer: A**
