Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think through it carefully.

Alright, the problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest and has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, okay, let me list the given data:

- Initial rest energy: 300 GeV. So Mc² = 300 GeV. But since we're dealing with rest mass, that's M = 300 GeV/c².
- Fission produces two fragments. Let's say the masses are m1 and m2, where m1 = 2 m2.
- m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Because the sum is 99% of the initial mass.

So, let's figure out the masses of the fragments.

We have m1 = 2 m2. So, substituting into the sum:

2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99 M) / 3 = 0.33 M. Wait, no—wait, 0.99 M is the sum? Oh wait, M is the initial mass, so the sum is 0.99 M. So,

m2 = (0.99 M) / 3 = 0.33 M → m1 = 2 * 0.33 M = 0.66 M. So the two fragments have masses 0.66 M and 0.33 M.

But wait, the initial rest mass is M (300 GeV/c²), but the sum of the two is 0.99 M? That implies that some mass was lost—probably converted into kinetic energy or other forms, but in the problem statement, it says "nothing else" is produced, so perhaps binding energy is considered, but I'm not sure. Hmm, but for the kinetic energy part, I think we can proceed.

Wait, the problem says that the sum of the rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass. So the rest mass of the fragments is 0.99 M. That suggests that mass was lost, which is typical in fission because some mass is converted into kinetic energy and possibly other forms.

So, the initial nucleus was at rest. After fission, the two fragments will move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Since the initial momentum is zero, their momenta must cancel each other out. So, the momentum of m1 must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to that of m2.

So, let's denote the velocities as v1 and v2. But wait, since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, maybe their momenta are significant. Hmm, but the problem compares the correct T1 with the non-relativistic approximation. So perhaps in the non-relativistic case, we can use the classical kinetic energy formula, like (1/2)mv², while the correct one would involve relativistic expressions.

Wait, but in any case, the conservation of energy and momentum must be applied.

The initial energy is entirely rest energy: E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV.

After fission, the energy is the sum of the rest energies of the two fragments plus their kinetic energies. So:

E_initial = (m1 c² + K1) + (m2 c² + K2)

But wait, m1 and m2 are rest masses. So, E_initial = (m1 + m2) c² + K1 + K2 + (other forms, but the problem says nothing else is produced, so perhaps only these two fragments' KE plus their rest mass energy).

Wait, but the problem states that the sum of their rest masses is 0.99 M, so (m1 + m2) c² = 0.99 M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So, E_initial = 300 GeV = (m1 + m2) c² + K1 + K2 → 300 GeV = 297 GeV + K1 + K2 → K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

So the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is 3 GeV.

Now, since the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum after fission is also zero. So,

m1 v1 + m2 v2 = 0 → m1 v1 = - m2 v2.

Assuming m1 is the more massive fragment, so m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

So,

0.66 M v1 = -0.33 M v2 → 2 v1 = -v2 → v2 = -2 v1.

Wait, that's the velocity relationship. Hmm, but since we are dealing with momentum, perhaps we should write in terms of relativistic momentum.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about kinetic energy. So perhaps it's better to think in terms of relativistic energies and momenta.

But wait, the question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1, which is K1.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's outline the approach.

Since the system is isolated and initial momentum is zero, the total momentum after fission is zero. So,

p1 + p2 = 0 → p1 = -p2.

In terms of relativistic momentum, p = gamma m v.

But perhaps it's easier to use energy and momentum conservation.

The total energy after fission is (m1 c² + K1) + (m2 c² + K2) = 297 GeV + K1 + K2 = 300 GeV, as before.

So, K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

Momentum conservation:

p1 = gamma1 m1 v1,

p2 = gamma2 m2 v2.

And p1 + p2 = 0 → gamma1 m1 v1 = - gamma2 m2 v2.

But I'm not sure if this is getting me anywhere. Maybe I can express v2 in terms of v1.

Wait, another approach: in the rest frame of the initial nucleus, the two fragments fly apart with velocities v1 and v2 such that their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But since m1 = 2 m2, let's substitute m1 = 2 m2.

So,

gamma1 * 2 m2 * v1 = gamma2 * m2 * v2 → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

But from momentum conservation, we also have v2 = -2 v1. Wait, no, because m1 = 2 m2,

m1 v1 = - m2 v2 → 2 m2 v1 = - m2 v2 → 2 v1 = -v2 → v2 = -2 v1.

So, v2 = -2 v1.

Substituting into the momentum equation,

2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 (-2 v1) → 2 gamma1 = -2 gamma2 → gamma1 = -gamma2.

But gamma is always positive because it's a Lorentz factor, so signs must be handled carefully. Alternatively, perhaps the velocities are in opposite directions, so we can take magnitudes.

Wait, perhaps it's better to take the magnitudes.

So, |p1| = |p2| → gamma1 m1 |v1| = gamma2 m2 |v2|.

And from momentum, we have m1 v1 = - m2 v2 → v2 = (m1/m2) v1 → v2 = 2 v1 (since m1 is twice m2).

Wait, no, because if m1=2 m2, then v2 would be (m1/m2) times v1, but considering the direction, if m1 v1 = - m2 v2, then v2 = -(m1/m2) v1 → v2 = -(2 m2/m2) v1 → v2 = -2 v1.

So, the speed of fragment 2 is twice that of fragment 1, in the opposite direction.

But considering that, the magnitudes are |v1| and |v2|=2 |v1|.

So, the momentum magnitudes are p1 = gamma1 m1 v1, p2 = gamma2 m2 v2. But wait, v2 is negative, but in terms of magnitude, it's 2 v1 in the opposite direction. So I think I should write |p1| = |p2|.

Wait, because p1 and p2 are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 (2 v1) → gamma1 (2 m2) v1 = gamma2 m2 (2 v1).

Wait, let me substitute m1 = 2 m2.

So,

gamma1 * 2 m2 * v1 = gamma2 * m2 * (2 v1).

Simplify:

2 m2 gamma1 v1 = 2 m2 gamma2 v1 → gamma1 = gamma2.

So, gamma1 = gamma2.

Wait, that's interesting. So both fragments have the same Lorentz factor.

Hmm, that can't be right, can it? Because one is more massive than the other, but perhaps for the same gamma, their velocities are different.

But let's proceed. So,

gamma1 = gamma2.

So, gamma is same for both fragments.

Now, the velocities are related by v2 = -2 v1.

But wait, for each fragment, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, since gamma is same for both,

1 / sqrt(1 - (v1)^2/c^2) ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v2)^2/c^2).

Which implies that (v1)^2 = (v2)^2 → v1 = ±v2.

But earlier, we have v2 = -2 v1. So, substituting,

v1 = ± (-2 v1) → v1 = -2 v1 or v1 = 2 v1.

Wait, that would imply 3 v1 = 0 → v1=0, which can't be right because that would mean they aren't moving.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake in the earlier steps?

Wait, let's retrace.

We have m1 = 2 m2.

Momentum conservation: m1 v1 = - m2 v2 → 2 m2 v1 = - m2 v2 → 2 v1 = -v2 → v2 = -2 v1.

From the momentum magnitudes, |p1| = |p2|.

So,

gamma1 m1 |v1| = gamma2 m2 |v2|

Substituting m1=2 m2 and |v2|=2 |v1|,

gamma1 * 2 m2 * |v1| = gamma2 * m2 * 2 |v1|

Divide both sides by 2 m2 |v1|,

gamma1 = gamma2.

So, gamma1 = gamma2.

So, both fragments have the same gamma.

Hmm, this is a key point.

So, their velocities are related by v2 = -2 v1.

But if gamma1 = gamma2, then their speeds must satisfy sqrt(1 - v1²/c²) = sqrt(1 - v2²/c²).

Which implies that v1² = v2² → v1 = ±v2.

But from v2 = -2 v1,

If v1 = v2, then v1 = -2 v1 → 3 v1 = 0 → v1=0 → which is impossible.

If v1 = -v2, then v1 = - (-2 v1) → v1=2 v1 → v1=0 → same problem.

Hmm, so this leads to a contradiction. That suggests that perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps I shouldn't have assumed that the magnitudes of the velocities are in a 1:2 ratio. Maybe that only applies in the non-relativistic case, and in reality, due to the velocity dependence in the Lorentz factor, the velocities aren't in a 1:2 ratio.

Hmm, perhaps I shouldn't make that velocity assumption. Let's try a different approach.

Let me denote the velocity of fragment 1 as v, and fragment 2 as u.

From momentum conservation,

m1 v + m2 u = 0 → m1 v = - m2 u → u = -(m1/m2) v.

Since m1 = 2 m2, this becomes u = -(2 m2/m2) v → u = -2 v.

So, the velocity of fragment 2 is -2v.

Now, the energies:

Total energy of fragment 1: E1 = gamma1 m1 c².

Similarly, E2 = gamma2 m2 c².

The kinetic energy for each is K1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c²,

K2 = (gamma2 -1) m2 c².

We know that K1 + K2 =3 GeV.

We also have:

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV,

Which is E1 + E2 = (gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2) c² = 300 GeV.

But m1 = 2 m2, so,

gamma1 (2 m2) c² + gamma2 m2 c² = 300 GeV → m2 c² (2 gamma1 + gamma2) ) = 300 GeV.

But from earlier, since u = -2v, and using the velocity relation, perhaps we can relate gamma1 and gamma2.

We have u = -2v.

But gamma is a function of velocity, so gamma2 = gamma(u) = gamma(-2v) = gamma(2v), since gamma depends on speed, not direction.

So, gamma2 = gamma(2v) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (2v/c)^2).

Similarly, gamma1 = gamma(v) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

So, now we have variables gamma1 and gamma2 in terms of v.

But this seems complicated. Let me denote beta = v/c. So, beta is a fraction of the speed of light.

So, beta1 = beta,

beta2 = -2 beta.

But since gamma depends only on beta's magnitude, gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²).

gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (2 beta)^2 ) = 1/sqrt(1 -4 beta²).

This might make the equations manageable.

So, now the energy equation becomes:

m2 c² (2 gamma1 + gamma2 ) = 300 GeV.

We can write m2 as (0.33 M) = (0.33)(300 GeV / c²) ) = 99 GeV / c².

Wait, no. Wait, M = initial rest mass = 300 GeV/c².

m1 + m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99 M - m1)/something? Wait no, earlier calculation:

m1 = 0.66 M, m2=0.33 M.

So, m2=0.33 M = 0.33 * 300 GeV/c² = 99 GeV/c².

So, m2 c² = 99 GeV.

So, the energy equation becomes:

(99 GeV) * (2 gamma1 + gamma2 ) = 300 GeV → 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 300 /99 → approximately 3.0303.

So,

2 gamma1 + gamma2 ≈ 3.0303.

But gamma2 = [1 / sqrt(1 - (2 beta)^2 ) ].

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated, but maybe I can solve for beta.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the non-relativistic case first, and then see how it differs from the relativistic scenario.

In the non-relativistic case, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv².

So, let's compute the velocities and KEs using non-relativistic mechanics, and then compare with the correct relativistic values.

In non-relativistic case:

Momentum conservation: m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Wait, no, because in non-relativistic, momentum is m v. Initial momentum is zero, so m1 v1 = - m2 v2.

Wait, but m1 is twice m2, so:

2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = 2 v1.

This is the same as before, but without considering relativistic effects on momentum.

So, the velocities are in a 1:2 ratio. Now, for the kinetic energies:

K1 = (1/2) m1 v1²,

K2 = (1/2) m2 v2².

But v2=2 v1. So,

K2 = (1/2) m2 (4 v1²) = 2 m2 v1².

But:

K1 + K2 = 3 GeV,

(1/2 m1 v1²) + (2 m2 v1²) ) = 3 GeV.

Substituting m1=2 m2,

(1/2 * 2 m2 v1²) + (2 m2 v1²) ) = (m2 v1²) + (2 m2 v1²) ) =3 m2 v1² =3 GeV.

So,

3 m2 v1² =3 GeV → m2 v1²=1 GeV.

But m2 is 0.33 M = 0.33*300 GeV/c² =99 GeV/c².

Wait no, m2 is in GeV/c², so m2 c² is 99 GeV.

Wait, m2 =99 GeV/c², so m2 c² =99 GeV.

So, m2 = 99 GeV/(c²).

So,

m2 v1² =1 GeV → (99 GeV/(c²)) v1² =1 GeV → v1² = (1 GeV * c² ) / 99 GeV ) ) → v1² = c² /99 → v1 = c / sqrt(99) ≈ c/9.9499 ≈ 0.1005 c.

So, v1≈0.1005 c, v2=2 v1≈0.201 c.

Now, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m1) is:

K1_nonrel = (1/2) m1 v1².

m1= 0.66 M = 0.66 *300 GeV/c²=198 GeV/c².

So,

K1_nonrel = (1/2) * 198 GeV/c² * (c² /99) ) → (1/2)*198/99 * GeV → (1/2)*2 GeV → 1 GeV.

So, in the non-relativistic case, the more massive fragment has 1 GeV of kinetic energy.

But earlier, we found that the total KE is 3 GeV. So, K1_nonrel is 1 GeV, K2_nonrel is 2 GeV, summing to 3 GeV.

Now, the problem states that T1 is the correct kinetic energy (relativistic), and we're to find the difference between T1 and K1_nonrel.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the correct relativistic scenario.

In the correct scenario, we have:

K1 + K2 =3 GeV.

And we have the same momentum conservation as before.

But in the relativistic case, the velocities are higher, so the kinetic energies would be larger? Or perhaps not, because the mass is larger?

Wait, perhaps in the relativistic case, the KE is higher than the non-relativistic case because velocity is higher or because of the gamma factor.

But wait, earlier in the non-relativistic case, the KE of fragment 1 is 1 GeV. So, the correct (relativistic) T1 would be higher or lower than that?

Wait, I'm not sure yet, but let's proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the correct gamma1 and gamma2 values.

From earlier, we have:

2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

And,

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 -4 beta^2 ), where beta = v/c.

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2 ).

So, substituting gamma2,

2 [1/sqrt(1 - beta^2)] + [1/sqrt(1 -4 beta^2)] = 3.0303.

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can substitute x = beta^2.

Let me set x = beta^2.

So, the equation becomes:

2/(sqrt(1 -x)) + 1/(sqrt(1-4x)) = 3.0303.

Hmm, this is a single equation in one variable x. Let me try to find x numerically.

Let me guess some x values.

Let me try x=0.01 (beta=0.1c).

Compute each term:

sqrt(1 -0.01)=sqrt(0.99)=~0.99499 → 1/0.99499≈1.005.

So, 2 *1.005≈2.01.

1/sqrt(1 -0.04)=1/sqrt(0.96)=~1.0198.

So, sum is about 2.01 +1.0198=3.0298, which is very close to 3.0303.

So, x≈0.01 → beta=0.1 c.

Wow, that worked out nicely.

So, beta=0.1 c → v=0.1 c.

So, beta=0.1, v=0.1 c.

So, gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 -0.01 )=1/sqrt(0.99)=~1.005034.

gamma2 =1/sqrt(1 -4*(0.01))=1/sqrt(0.96)=~1.0198039.

Now, let's compute the energies.

E1 = gamma1 m1 c² → 1.005034 * 198 GeV → 198 *1.005034≈199.0 GeV.

E2 = gamma2 m2 c² →1.0198039 *99 GeV≈ 100.96 GeV.

So, E1 + E2=199.0 +100.96≈300 GeV, which matches.

Now, the kinetic energies are,

K1 = E1 - m1 c² =199.0 -198=1.0 GeV.

K2=100.96 -99=1.96 GeV.

Wait, adding K1 and K2: 1.0 +1.96=2.96 GeV, which is approximately 3 GeV, considering rounding.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, K1 was exactly 1 GeV. But here, in the relativistic case, K1 is also 1 GeV. So the difference would be zero?

But that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait: if beta is 0.1 c, let me recheck.

gamma1=1/sqrt(1 -0.01)=1.005034.

E1=gamma1 * m1 c²=1.005034 *198 GeV=198 * 1.005034.

198 *1.005034 → 198 *1 =198, 198 *0.005034≈0.996. So E1≈198 +0.996≈198.996 GeV.

So, K1=E1 -m1 c²=198.996 -198=0.996 GeV ≈1 GeV.

Similarly, gamma2=1/sqrt(1-0.04)=1/sqrt(0.96) ≈1.0198.

E2=gamma2 *99 GeV=99 *1.0198≈99 *1.02=100.98 GeV.

K2=100.98 -99=1.98 GeV.

So, K1≈0.996 GeV≈1 GeV,

K2≈1.98 GeV.

Total KE≈3 GeV.

So, in the relativistic case, the more massive fragment has about 1 GeV KE, same as the non-relativistic case.

But wait, that can't be right because the KE in relativity should account for relativistic effects, but here it's the same as the non-relativistic case.

Wait, but in this specific case, the beta is 0.1 c, which is small, so the relativistic effects are minimal. So, the KE in the relativistic case is very close to the non-relativistic case.

So, the difference between T1 (correct) and K1_nonrel is negligible, but the options given are in the 2-20 MeV range.

Wait, but 0.996 GeV is approximately 1 GeV, so the difference is about 0.004 GeV, which is 4 MeV.

Wait, 0.004 GeV is 4 MeV.

But wait, in the relativistic case, K1 is 0.996 GeV → which is 996 MeV. The non-relativistic case is 1 GeV → 1000 MeV.

So, the difference is 1000 MeV -996 MeV =4 MeV.

But the options don't have 4 MeV as an option. The options are A)2, B)5, C)10, D)20.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me check the exact values.

gamma1=1/sqrt(0.99)=1.005033585.

gamma1=1.005033585.

E1=gamma1 * m1 c² = 1.005033585 *198 GeV.

198 *1.005033585 = 198 + (198 *0.005033585).

198 *0.005033585= approx 0.996.

So, E1≈198.996 GeV.

K1=E1 -198=0.996 GeV = 996 MeV.

In non-relativistic case, K1=1 GeV=1000 MeV.

So, the difference is 1000 -996=4 MeV.

But the options don't have 4 MeV. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the velocities and see where I went wrong.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, K1_nonrel=1 GeV.

In the relativistic case, K1 is 0.996 GeV.

So, the difference is 0.004 GeV =4 MeV.

But that's not one of the options. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that beta is 0.1.

Wait, earlier when I computed with beta=0.1, the sum 2 gamma1 +gamma2 was 3.0298, which is very close to the desired 3.0303. So that's correct.

So, the correct calculation gives K1=0.996 GeV=996 MeV.

Non-relativistic is 1000 MeV.

Difference is 4 MeV, but this isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, let me read the problem again.

Wait, the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So, m1 +m2=0.99 M.

But M has rest energy 300 GeV, so m1 c² +m2 c²=0.99 *300 GeV=297 GeV.

So, E_initial=300 GeV= sum of rest masses (297 GeV) + KE (3 GeV).

So, that's correct.

So, the problem states that the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What's the difference between the correct T1 and the non-relativistic T1.

In the non-relativistic case, T1_nonrel=1 GeV.

In the relativistic case, T1_rel=0.996 GeV.

So, the difference is 0.004 GeV =4 MeV.

But the options don't have 4 MeV. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the non-relativistic case.

Wait, wait. Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the total KE is 3 GeV, but in the calculation, the more massive fragment's KE is 1 GeV, the other 2 GeV.

But perhaps in reality, in the relativistic case, the more massive fragment's KE is less than the non-relativistic case, but due to the small beta, the difference is about 4 MeV.

But the options given are A)2, B)5, C)10, D)20.

Hmm, perhaps the question is reversed. Perhaps the correct T1 is larger than the non-relat case?

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm incorrect in assuming that the non-relativistic calculation gives K1=1 GeV.

Wait, let me recheck the non-relativistic part.

In non-relativistic, I have:

m1=198 GeV/c²,

m2=99 GeV/c².

Momentum conservation: m1 v1 = - m2 v2 → 198 v1 = -99 v2 → v2 =-2 v1.

Kinetic energy:

K1 = 1/2 m1 v1²,

K2=1/2 m2 v2²=1/2 m2 (4 v1²)=2 m2 v1².

So, K1 + K2= (1/2 *198 v1^2 ) + (2 *99 v1^2 ) = (99 v1²) + (198 v1² )=297 v1² =3 GeV.

So, v1²=3 GeV /297 → v1²= (3e9 eV) / (297e9 eV) )= 3/297=1/99 → v1=1/sqrt(99) c ≈0.1005 c.

So,

K1_nonrel= (1/2) *198 GeV/c² * (c² /99 ) = (1/2)*198/99 * GeV → (1/2)*2 GeV=1 GeV.

So, that's correct.

In relativistic case, K1 is about 0.996 GeV, so the difference between T1 (correct) and K1_nonrel is 4 MeV.

But the options don't have 4, so perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated gamma2.

Wait, m2=99 GeV/c², v2=2 v1=0.201 c.

So, beta2=0.201.

gamma2=1/sqrt(1 - (0.201)^2 )=1/sqrt(1-0.040401)=1/sqrt(0.959599)=1/0.9796 ≈1.0208.

Wait, earlier I thought beta was 0.1, so beta2 would be 0.2, but I think I messed up the substitution.

Wait, wait, no. Earlier in the relativistic case, we found beta=0.1 c, so v=0.1 c.

Then, v2=-2 v= -0.2 c → beta2=0.2.

So, gamma2=1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 )=1/sqrt(0.96)= approx 1.0198.

Then,

E2=gamma2 * m2 c²=1.0198 *99 GeV=100.96 GeV.

So,

K2=E2 -m2 c²=100.96-99=1.96 GeV.

Similarly, E1=gamma1 * m1 c²=1.005034 *198 GeV=198.996 GeV.

K1=198.996-198=0.996 GeV.

So, sum of KEs=0.996 +1.96=2.956 GeV, which is about 3 GeV.

So, the calculation is correct.

So, the correct T1 is 0.996 GeV, non-relat is 1 GeV.

Difference is 1 -0.996=0.004 GeV=4 MeV.

But the options don't have 4 MeV. So, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the difference in kinetic energies, but the non-relativistic calculation is using a different approach. Or perhaps I swapped the fragments.

Wait, in the problem, the more massive fragment is m1, which in the non-relativistic case has K1=1 GeV.

In the relativistic case, it's 0.996 GeV.

So, the correct T1 is 0.996 GeV, which is 996 MeV.

Non-relat T1 is 1000 MeV.

So, difference is -4 MeV, but the question asks for the difference, perhaps absolute value, 4 MeV.

But the options are 2,5,10,20. So, perhaps the intended answer is B)5 MeV.

But why? I'm not getting 5 MeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the correct approach.

Alternative approach:

Perhaps the rest mass of the system is 0.99 M, so the Q of the reaction is 300 GeV -297 GeV=3 GeV.

In the center of mass frame, the two fragments move with equal and opposite momenta, so the kinetic energy is shared based on their masses.

Wait, but perhaps we can use the formula for two-body decay.

In two-body decay, the velocities can be found using the formula for each mass.

The general formula for the kinetic energy of each fragment in a two-body decay is:

K1 = [ (Q^2) (m2^2) ] / [ (m1 + m2)^2 (m1 + m2 + Q) ] * c^2.

Wait, perhaps I should use that formula.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, for two-body decay, the velocities can be determined based on the masses and the Q value.

The formula for the velocity of each fragment is:

beta1 = ( (m1 + m2 + Q) ) / (2 (m1 + m2) ) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of energy and momentum.

But perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the kinetic energy in terms of the masses and the Q value.

In two-body decay, the kinetic energy of each fragment can be found using:

K1 = [ (Q)^2 m2^2 ] / [4 (m1 + m2)^2 (m1 + m2 + Q) ) ] * c^4.

Wait, perhaps. Let me try to find the correct formula.

Wait, I'm not confident about this approach, but perhaps using the formula would save time.

Given that, let's proceed.

Given:

m1=0.66 M,

m2=0.33 M.

Q=3 GeV.

So,

m1 +m2=0.99 M,

m1+ m2 + Q=0.99 M +3 GeV.

Wait, but M is 300 GeV/c².

Wait, but perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of M.

m1 =0.66 M,

m2=0.33 M,

Q=3 GeV.

But M is 300 GeV/c².

So,

m1 +m2=0.99 M,

m1 +m2 + Q=0.99 M +3 GeV.

Wait, but 3 GeV is much smaller than M*c²=300 GeV.

So, perhaps we can ignore Q compared to M.

Hmm, perhaps the formula for K1 is:

K1 = [ Q² m2^2 ] / [4 (m1 + m2)^2 (m1 + m2 + Q) ) ]

But let me compute this.

Plugging in:

Q=3 GeV,

m2=0.33 M,

m1 +m2=0.99 M,

m1 +m2 + Q=0.99 M +3.

So,

K1 = [ (3)^2 * (0.33 M)^2 ] / [4 (0.99 M)^2 (0.99 M +3) ) ]

But let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 9 * (0.33 M)^2 =9 *0.1089 M²=0.9801 M².

Denominator:4 * (0.99 M)^2 * (0.99 M +3) →4 * (0.9801 M²) * (0.99 M +3).

So,

K1= 0.9801 M² / [4 *0.9801 M² * (0.99 M +3) ) ].

Simplify:

0.9801 cancels,

So,

K1= 1 / [4 (0.99 M +3) ) ].

But M=300 GeV/c².

So,

0.99 M +3=0.99 *300 +3=297 +3=300 GeV/c².

So,

K1= 1/(4 *300) *c².

Wait, but units? Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the units. Because M is in GeV/c², and Q is in GeV.

Wait, perhaps the formula is in terms of energy squared, so I might have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed numerically.

Wait, maybe it's better to not use this formula and instead proceed with the initial approach.

But given that, perhaps the correct K1 is about 0.996 GeV, non-relat is 1 GeV, difference is 0.004 GeV=4 MeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is B)5 MeV.

Wait, perhaps I have a miscalculation in the initial approach.

Wait, let me reevaluate the correct T1 and non-relativistic T1.

In the correct case, K1=0.996 GeV=996 MeV.

In the non-relativistic case, K1=1000 MeV.

Difference is 4 MeV, but the options don't have it.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the relativistic gamma and KE again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I've made an error in calculating the gamma1 and gamma2.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact values.

Let me calculate gamma1 and gamma2 precisely.

gamma1=1/sqrt(1 - 0.1^2 )=1/sqrt(0.99)=1.005033585.

gamma1=1.005033585.

gamma2=1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 )=1/sqrt(0.96)=1.0198039.

So,

E1=gamma1 * m1 c²=1.005033585 *198 GeV=198 + (198 *0.005033585) GeV=198 + (approx 1.0) GeV=199 GeV.

So, K1=E1 -198=1 GeV.

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 198 GeV * 1.005033585 =198 + (198 *0.005033585) → 198 + (approx 1.0 GeV) → 199 GeV.

So, K1=1 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right. So, in the relativistic case, K1 is 1 GeV?

But earlier calculation said 0.996 GeV.

Ah, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation.

Wait, 198 GeV *1.005033585=?

198 *1.005033585 = 198 *1 +198 *0.005033585.

198 *0.005033585= approx 1.0 GeV.

So, 198 +1.0=199 GeV.

So, K1= E1 - m1 c²=199 -198=1 GeV.

Wait, but that's the same as the non-relativistic case.

But how?

Hmm, perhaps this indicates that the relativistic and non-relativistic KEs are the same in this case.

Which would imply that the difference is zero.

But that's conflicting with the earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, maybe the way I calculated the velocities was wrong.

Wait, perhaps the mistake lies in the assumption that beta is 0.1 c.

Wait, from earlier:

The equation 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3.0303,

With beta=0.1 c, gives 2*1.005033585 +1.0198039=2.01006717 +1.0198039=3.02987107, which is approximately 3.0303.

So, it's correct.

But according to that, gamma1 is 1.005033585,

gamma2=1.0198039.

So,

E1=1.005033585 *198=198 + 198 *0.005033585 → 198 + (approx 1.0) → 199 GeV.

So, K1=1 GeV.

Hmm, but from that, K1 is same as non-relativistic case. So the difference is zero.

But the problem states that the sum of rest masses is 99% of M, which implies that the Q is 3 GeV, which is small, leading to small KEs, so relativistic effects are minimal.

So, perhaps the difference is negligible, but the options don't include zero.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the correct answer is a 4 MeV difference, but since that's not an option, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 5 MeV, the closest option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the setup.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial setup is wrong. Let's think about the rest energy and the way KE is calculated.

Wait, the initial nucleus has rest energy 300 GeV. After fission, the rest masses sum to 297 GeV, so the energy released is 3 GeV, which is the total KE of the two fragments.

In the center of mass frame, each fragment's KE is determined by their mass and the total Q.

But perhaps an alternative way to calculate the correct KE is to use the formula for KE in two-body decay.

The formula for the kinetic energy of a fragment in a two-body decay is:

K = (Q^2 m2^2) / [4 (m1 + m2)^2 (m1 + m2 + Q) ) ] *c^2.

Wait, let me try that.

Given:

m1=0.66 M,

m2=0.33 M,

Q=3 GeV.

So,

K1 = (3^2 * (0.33 M)^2 ) / [4*(0.99 M)^2 * (0.99 M +3) ) ] *c^2.

But since M is in GeV/c², let's express everything in GeV.

But perhaps the formula is in terms of energy, so let me plug the numbers in terms of GeV.

But this might get complicated. Let me proceed step by step.

First, compute the numerator:

3^2 * (0.33 M)^2 =9 *0.33^2 M^2=9 *0.1089 M²=0.9801 M².

Denominator:

4*(0.99 M)^2*(0.99 M +3) =4 *0.9801 M² * (0.99 M +3).

So,

K1= (0.9801 M²) / [4 *0.9801 M² (0.99 M +3) ) ] *c^2.

Simplify:

M² cancels,

0.9801 cancels,

So,

K1= 1/(4*(0.99 M +3)) *c^2.

But M is 300 GeV/c², so 0.99 M=297 GeV/c².

So,

0.99 M +3=297 +3=300 GeV/c².

Thus,

K1=1/(4 *300) *c² * GeV.

Wait, but c² is in (GeV^2/(GeV/c^2)^2) → units are getting a bit messy.

Wait, perhaps the formula is better expressed in terms of energy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute:

K1= (Q² m2²) / [4 (m1 +m2)^2 (m1 +m2 + Q) ) ] * c^4.

But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed numerically.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct KE is the same as non-relativistic, so the difference is zero, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the relativistic case, the KE is higher.

Wait, but from the earlier calculation, K1 is same as non-relat.

Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic KEs.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, K1=1 GeV.

In the relativistic case, K1≈1 GeV.

So, the difference is negligible.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option B)5 MeV.

But why?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the velocities and the corresponding KE.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the fact that relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma-1) mc^2.

In the non-relativistic case, K=½ mv².

But perhaps the correct approach is to find the ratio between the two.

Wait, but I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 5 MeV, option B.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires calculating the difference as 5 MeV.

But given the initial calculation, the difference is 4 MeV, which isn't an option.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma1.

Wait, let me use more precise calculations.

With beta=0.1,

gamma1=1/sqrt(1 -0.01)=1.005033585.

E1=gamma1 * m1 c²=1.005033585 *198 GeV=198 + (198 *0.005033585)=198 + 1.0 GeV=199 GeV.

So, K1=1 GeV.

Wait, but m1 c²=198 GeV,

E1=199 GeV,

So, K1=1 GeV.

But wait, that suggests that in the relativistic case, K1 is exactly 1 GeV, same as non-relativistic.

So the difference is zero.

But this can't be right, because in reality, the KE in relativity should be higher or lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, precisely,

gamma1=1/sqrt(1 -0.1^2)=1/sqrt(0.99)=approx 1.005033585.

So,

E1=1.005033585 *198 GeV=198 *1.005033585.

Let me compute 198 * 1.005033585 exactly.

198 *1=198.

198 *0.005033585 = approx 198 *0.005 =0.99, and 198 *0.000033585≈0.00665.

So, total is approx 0.99665.

So, E1≈198 +0.99665=198.99665 GeV.

So, K1=E1 -198=0.99665 GeV=996.65 MeV.

In non-relat, K1=1000 MeV.

So, difference is about 3.35 MeV.

Still, not matching any option.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the difference to be around 5 MeV, so option B.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the non-relativistic calculation gives T1=1 GeV, and the relativistic calculation gives T1=0.996 GeV, so the difference is 0.004 GeV=4 MeV. Since the options don't have this, perhaps the intended answer is B)5 MeV.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A)2 MeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact difference.

In the relativistic case, K1=0.99665 GeV=996.65 MeV.

Non-relat:1000 MeV.

Difference:3.335 MeV.

Approx 3.34 MeV.

So, the closest option is B)5 MeV.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of K1.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using exact values.

gamma1=1/sqrt(1 - (0.1)^2 )=1.005033585091.

So,

E1=gamma1 *198 =1.005033585091 *198=198 *1.005033585091.

Calculating 198 *1.005033585091:

198 *1=198.

198 *0.005033585091= let's compute exactly.

0.005033585091=approx 0.005033585.

198 *0.005033585= (200 *0.005033585) - (2 *0.005033585).

200 *0.005033585=1.006717 GeV.

2 *0.005033585=0.01006717 GeV.

So, 198 *0.005033585=1.006717 -0.01006717=0.9966498 GeV.

So, E1=198 +0.9966498=198.9966498 GeV.

Thus, K1=198.9966498 -198=0.9966498 GeV=996.6498 MeV.

So, the difference is 1000 -996.6498=3.3502 MeV.

Approximately 3.35 MeV.

But the options don't have this.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is B)5 MeV, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the difference to be 5 MeV.

But I'm not confident. Without further information, I'll proceed with the calculation and select the closest option, which is B)5 MeV.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves an atomic nucleus of rest mass \( M = 300 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) undergoing spontaneous fission into two fragments. The more massive fragment (\( m_1 \)) is twice as massive as the less massive fragment (\( m_2 \)), and the sum of their rest masses is \( 99\% \) of the initial mass, i.e., \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \). The total kinetic energy of the two fragments is \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), as the initial rest energy is \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \), and the rest energy of the fragments is \( 297 \, \text{GeV} \). The goal is to find the difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy \( T_1 \) of the more massive fragment and the non-relativistic approximation.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Masses of the fragments**:
   - \( m_1 = 0.66M \), \( m_2 = 0.33M \).

2. **Non-relativistic case**:
   - Using momentum conservation, the velocities are related as \( v_2 = -2v_1 \).
   - Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:
     \[
     K_{1,\text{non-rel}} = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]

3. **Relativistic case**:
   - The total energy of each fragment is \( E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 \) and \( E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).
   - From momentum conservation, \( \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2 \), leading to \( \gamma_1 = \gamma_2 \) for the given mass ratio.
   - Solving for \( \gamma_1 \) and \( \gamma_2 \), the velocities are found to be \( v_1 \approx 0.1c \) and \( v_2 \approx 0.2c \).
   - The relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:
     \[
     K_{1,\text{rel}} = (\gamma_1 - 1)m_1 c^2 = 0.996 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]

4. **Difference between relativistic and non-relativistic kinetic energies**:
   - The difference is:
     \[
     \Delta K = |K_{1,\text{rel}} - K_{1,\text{non-rel}}| = |0.996 \, \text{GeV} - 1.000 \, \text{GeV}| = 0.004 \, \text{GeV} = 4 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The calculated difference is \( 4 \, \text{MeV} \), but this value is not among the provided options. The closest option is \( 5 \, \text{MeV} \), which is likely the intended answer.

**Answer: B**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nuclear fission and kinetic energy. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think through it carefully.

Alright, the problem says that an atomic nucleus of mass M is at rest and has a rest-mass energy of 300 GeV. Then it undergoes spontaneous fission, splitting into two fragments. One fragment is twice as massive as the other in terms of rest mass. The sum of their rest masses is 99% of the initial mass M. I need to find the difference between the correct kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (T1) and the value calculated using the classical (non-relativistic) approximation.

Wait, okay, let me list the given data:

- Initial rest energy: 300 GeV. So Mc² = 300 GeV. But since we're dealing with rest mass, that's M = 300 GeV/c².
- Fission produces two fragments. Let's say the masses are m1 and m2, where m1 = 2 m2.
- m1 + m2 = 0.99 M. Because the sum is 99% of the initial mass.

So, let's figure out the masses of the fragments.

We have m1 = 2 m2. So, substituting into the sum:

2 m2 + m2 = 0.99 M → 3 m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99 M) / 3 = 0.33 M. Wait, no—wait, 0.99 M is the sum? Oh wait, M is the initial mass, so the sum is 0.99 M. So,

m2 = (0.99 M) / 3 = 0.33 M → m1 = 2 * 0.33 M = 0.66 M. So the two fragments have masses 0.66 M and 0.33 M.

But wait, the initial rest mass is M (300 GeV/c²), but the sum of the two is 0.99 M? That implies that some mass was lost—probably converted into kinetic energy or other forms, but in the problem statement, it says "nothing else" is produced, so perhaps binding energy is considered, but I'm not sure. Hmm, but for the kinetic energy part, I think we can proceed.

Wait, the problem says that the sum of the rest-masses is 99% of the initial mass. So the rest mass of the fragments is 0.99 M. That suggests that mass was lost, which is typical in fission because some mass is converted into kinetic energy and possibly other forms.

So, the initial nucleus was at rest. After fission, the two fragments will move in opposite directions to conserve momentum. Since the initial momentum is zero, their momenta must cancel each other out. So, the momentum of m1 must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to that of m2.

So, let's denote the velocities as v1 and v2. But wait, since we're dealing with relativistic speeds, maybe their momenta are significant. Hmm, but the problem compares the correct T1 with the non-relativistic approximation. So perhaps in the non-relativistic case, we can use the classical kinetic energy formula, like (1/2)mv², while the correct one would involve relativistic expressions.

Wait, but in any case, the conservation of energy and momentum must be applied.

The initial energy is entirely rest energy: E_initial = M c² = 300 GeV.

After fission, the energy is the sum of the rest energies of the two fragments plus their kinetic energies. So:

E_initial = (m1 c² + K1) + (m2 c² + K2)

But wait, m1 and m2 are rest masses. So, E_initial = (m1 + m2) c² + K1 + K2 + (other forms, but the problem says nothing else is produced, so perhaps only these two fragments' KE plus their rest mass energy).

Wait, but the problem states that the sum of their rest masses is 0.99 M, so (m1 + m2) c² = 0.99 M c² = 0.99 * 300 GeV = 297 GeV.

So, E_initial = 300 GeV = (m1 + m2) c² + K1 + K2 → 300 GeV = 297 GeV + K1 + K2 → K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

So the total kinetic energy of the two fragments is 3 GeV.

Now, since the initial momentum is zero, the total momentum after fission is also zero. So,

m1 v1 + m2 v2 = 0 → m1 v1 = - m2 v2.

Assuming m1 is the more massive fragment, so m1 = 0.66 M, m2 = 0.33 M.

So,

0.66 M v1 = -0.33 M v2 → 2 v1 = -v2 → v2 = -2 v1.

Wait, that's the velocity relationship. Hmm, but since we are dealing with momentum, perhaps we should write in terms of relativistic momentum.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about kinetic energy. So perhaps it's better to think in terms of relativistic energies and momenta.

But wait, the question is about the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment, T1, which is K1.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let's outline the approach.

Since the system is isolated and initial momentum is zero, the total momentum after fission is zero. So,

p1 + p2 = 0 → p1 = -p2.

In terms of relativistic momentum, p = gamma m v.

But perhaps it's easier to use energy and momentum conservation.

The total energy after fission is (m1 c² + K1) + (m2 c² + K2) = 297 GeV + K1 + K2 = 300 GeV, as before.

So, K1 + K2 = 3 GeV.

Momentum conservation:

p1 = gamma1 m1 v1,

p2 = gamma2 m2 v2.

And p1 + p2 = 0 → gamma1 m1 v1 = - gamma2 m2 v2.

But I'm not sure if this is getting me anywhere. Maybe I can express v2 in terms of v1.

Wait, another approach: in the rest frame of the initial nucleus, the two fragments fly apart with velocities v1 and v2 such that their momenta are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 v2.

But since m1 = 2 m2, let's substitute m1 = 2 m2.

So,

gamma1 * 2 m2 * v1 = gamma2 * m2 * v2 → 2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 v2.

But from momentum conservation, we also have v2 = -2 v1. Wait, no, because m1 = 2 m2,

m1 v1 = - m2 v2 → 2 m2 v1 = - m2 v2 → 2 v1 = -v2 → v2 = -2 v1.

So, v2 = -2 v1.

Substituting into the momentum equation,

2 gamma1 v1 = gamma2 (-2 v1) → 2 gamma1 = -2 gamma2 → gamma1 = -gamma2.

But gamma is always positive because it's a Lorentz factor, so signs must be handled carefully. Alternatively, perhaps the velocities are in opposite directions, so we can take magnitudes.

Wait, perhaps it's better to take the magnitudes.

So, |p1| = |p2| → gamma1 m1 |v1| = gamma2 m2 |v2|.

And from momentum, we have m1 v1 = - m2 v2 → v2 = (m1/m2) v1 → v2 = 2 v1 (since m1 is twice m2).

Wait, no, because if m1=2 m2, then v2 would be (m1/m2) times v1, but considering the direction, if m1 v1 = - m2 v2, then v2 = -(m1/m2) v1 → v2 = -(2 m2/m2) v1 → v2 = -2 v1.

So, the speed of fragment 2 is twice that of fragment 1, in the opposite direction.

But considering that, the magnitudes are |v1| and |v2|=2 |v1|.

So, the momentum magnitudes are p1 = gamma1 m1 v1, p2 = gamma2 m2 v2. But wait, v2 is negative, but in terms of magnitude, it's 2 v1 in the opposite direction. So I think I should write |p1| = |p2|.

Wait, because p1 and p2 are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

So,

gamma1 m1 v1 = gamma2 m2 (2 v1) → gamma1 (2 m2) v1 = gamma2 m2 (2 v1).

Wait, let me substitute m1 = 2 m2.

So,

gamma1 * 2 m2 * v1 = gamma2 * m2 * (2 v1).

Simplify:

2 m2 gamma1 v1 = 2 m2 gamma2 v1 → gamma1 = gamma2.

So, gamma1 = gamma2.

Wait, that's interesting. So both fragments have the same Lorentz factor.

Hmm, that can't be right, can it? Because one is more massive than the other, but perhaps for the same gamma, their velocities are different.

But let's proceed. So,

gamma1 = gamma2.

So, gamma is same for both fragments.

Now, the velocities are related by v2 = -2 v1.

But wait, for each fragment, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So, since gamma is same for both,

1 / sqrt(1 - (v1)^2/c^2) ) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v2)^2/c^2).

Which implies that (v1)^2 = (v2)^2 → v1 = ±v2.

But earlier, we have v2 = -2 v1. So, substituting,

v1 = ± (-2 v1) → v1 = -2 v1 or v1 = 2 v1.

Wait, that would imply 3 v1 = 0 → v1=0, which can't be right because that would mean they aren't moving.

Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake in the earlier steps?

Wait, let's retrace.

We have m1 = 2 m2.

Momentum conservation: m1 v1 = - m2 v2 → 2 m2 v1 = - m2 v2 → 2 v1 = -v2 → v2 = -2 v1.

From the momentum magnitudes, |p1| = |p2|.

So,

gamma1 m1 |v1| = gamma2 m2 |v2|

Substituting m1=2 m2 and |v2|=2 |v1|,

gamma1 * 2 m2 * |v1| = gamma2 * m2 * 2 |v1|

Divide both sides by 2 m2 |v1|,

gamma1 = gamma2.

So, gamma1 = gamma2.

So, both fragments have the same gamma.

Hmm, this is a key point.

So, their velocities are related by v2 = -2 v1.

But if gamma1 = gamma2, then their speeds must satisfy sqrt(1 - v1²/c²) = sqrt(1 - v2²/c²).

Which implies that v1² = v2² → v1 = ±v2.

But from v2 = -2 v1,

If v1 = v2, then v1 = -2 v1 → 3 v1 = 0 → v1=0 → which is impossible.

If v1 = -v2, then v1 = - (-2 v1) → v1=2 v1 → v1=0 → same problem.

Hmm, so this leads to a contradiction. That suggests that perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps I shouldn't have assumed that the magnitudes of the velocities are in a 1:2 ratio. Maybe that only applies in the non-relativistic case, and in reality, due to the velocity dependence in the Lorentz factor, the velocities aren't in a 1:2 ratio.

Hmm, perhaps I shouldn't make that velocity assumption. Let's try a different approach.

Let me denote the velocity of fragment 1 as v, and fragment 2 as u.

From momentum conservation,

m1 v + m2 u = 0 → m1 v = - m2 u → u = -(m1/m2) v.

Since m1 = 2 m2, this becomes u = -(2 m2/m2) v → u = -2 v.

So, the velocity of fragment 2 is -2v.

Now, the energies:

Total energy of fragment 1: E1 = gamma1 m1 c².

Similarly, E2 = gamma2 m2 c².

The kinetic energy for each is K1 = (gamma1 -1) m1 c²,

K2 = (gamma2 -1) m2 c².

We know that K1 + K2 =3 GeV.

We also have:

E1 + E2 = 300 GeV,

Which is E1 + E2 = (gamma1 m1 + gamma2 m2) c² = 300 GeV.

But m1 = 2 m2, so,

gamma1 (2 m2) c² + gamma2 m2 c² = 300 GeV → m2 c² (2 gamma1 + gamma2) ) = 300 GeV.

But from earlier, since u = -2v, and using the velocity relation, perhaps we can relate gamma1 and gamma2.

We have u = -2v.

But gamma is a function of velocity, so gamma2 = gamma(u) = gamma(-2v) = gamma(2v), since gamma depends on speed, not direction.

So, gamma2 = gamma(2v) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (2v/c)^2).

Similarly, gamma1 = gamma(v) = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v^2/c^2)).

So, now we have variables gamma1 and gamma2 in terms of v.

But this seems complicated. Let me denote beta = v/c. So, beta is a fraction of the speed of light.

So, beta1 = beta,

beta2 = -2 beta.

But since gamma depends only on beta's magnitude, gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²).

gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - (2 beta)^2 ) = 1/sqrt(1 -4 beta²).

This might make the equations manageable.

So, now the energy equation becomes:

m2 c² (2 gamma1 + gamma2 ) = 300 GeV.

We can write m2 as (0.33 M) = (0.33)(300 GeV / c²) ) = 99 GeV / c².

Wait, no. Wait, M = initial rest mass = 300 GeV/c².

m1 + m2 = 0.99 M → m2 = (0.99 M - m1)/something? Wait no, earlier calculation:

m1 = 0.66 M, m2=0.33 M.

So, m2=0.33 M = 0.33 * 300 GeV/c² = 99 GeV/c².

So, m2 c² = 99 GeV.

So, the energy equation becomes:

(99 GeV) * (2 gamma1 + gamma2 ) = 300 GeV → 2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 300 /99 → approximately 3.0303.

So,

2 gamma1 + gamma2 ≈ 3.0303.

But gamma2 = [1 / sqrt(1 - (2 beta)^2 ) ].

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated, but maybe I can solve for beta.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider the non-relativistic case first, and then see how it differs from the relativistic scenario.

In the non-relativistic case, kinetic energy is (1/2)mv².

So, let's compute the velocities and KEs using non-relativistic mechanics, and then compare with the correct relativistic values.

In non-relativistic case:

Momentum conservation: m1 v1 = m2 v2.

Wait, no, because in non-relativistic, momentum is m v. Initial momentum is zero, so m1 v1 = - m2 v2.

Wait, but m1 is twice m2, so:

2 m2 v1 = m2 v2 → v2 = 2 v1.

This is the same as before, but without considering relativistic effects on momentum.

So, the velocities are in a 1:2 ratio. Now, for the kinetic energies:

K1 = (1/2) m1 v1²,

K2 = (1/2) m2 v2².

But v2=2 v1. So,

K2 = (1/2) m2 (4 v1²) = 2 m2 v1².

But:

K1 + K2 = 3 GeV,

(1/2 m1 v1²) + (2 m2 v1²) ) = 3 GeV.

Substituting m1=2 m2,

(1/2 * 2 m2 v1²) + (2 m2 v1²) ) = (m2 v1²) + (2 m2 v1²) ) =3 m2 v1² =3 GeV.

So,

3 m2 v1² =3 GeV → m2 v1²=1 GeV.

But m2 is 0.33 M = 0.33*300 GeV/c² =99 GeV/c².

Wait no, m2 is in GeV/c², so m2 c² is 99 GeV.

Wait, m2 =99 GeV/c², so m2 c² =99 GeV.

So, m2 = 99 GeV/(c²).

So,

m2 v1² =1 GeV → (99 GeV/(c²)) v1² =1 GeV → v1² = (1 GeV * c² ) / 99 GeV ) ) → v1² = c² /99 → v1 = c / sqrt(99) ≈ c/9.9499 ≈ 0.1005 c.

So, v1≈0.1005 c, v2=2 v1≈0.201 c.

Now, the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment (m1) is:

K1_nonrel = (1/2) m1 v1².

m1= 0.66 M = 0.66 *300 GeV/c²=198 GeV/c².

So,

K1_nonrel = (1/2) * 198 GeV/c² * (c² /99) ) → (1/2)*198/99 * GeV → (1/2)*2 GeV → 1 GeV.

So, in the non-relativistic case, the more massive fragment has 1 GeV of kinetic energy.

But earlier, we found that the total KE is 3 GeV. So, K1_nonrel is 1 GeV, K2_nonrel is 2 GeV, summing to 3 GeV.

Now, the problem states that T1 is the correct kinetic energy (relativistic), and we're to find the difference between T1 and K1_nonrel.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the correct relativistic scenario.

In the correct scenario, we have:

K1 + K2 =3 GeV.

And we have the same momentum conservation as before.

But in the relativistic case, the velocities are higher, so the kinetic energies would be larger? Or perhaps not, because the mass is larger?

Wait, perhaps in the relativistic case, the KE is higher than the non-relativistic case because velocity is higher or because of the gamma factor.

But wait, earlier in the non-relativistic case, the KE of fragment 1 is 1 GeV. So, the correct (relativistic) T1 would be higher or lower than that?

Wait, I'm not sure yet, but let's proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the correct gamma1 and gamma2 values.

From earlier, we have:

2 gamma1 + gamma2 = 3.0303.

And,

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 -4 beta^2 ), where beta = v/c.

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2 ).

So, substituting gamma2,

2 [1/sqrt(1 - beta^2)] + [1/sqrt(1 -4 beta^2)] = 3.0303.

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can substitute x = beta^2.

Let me set x = beta^2.

So, the equation becomes:

2/(sqrt(1 -x)) + 1/(sqrt(1-4x)) = 3.0303.

Hmm, this is a single equation in one variable x. Let me try to find x numerically.

Let me guess some x values.

Let me try x=0.01 (beta=0.1c).

Compute each term:

sqrt(1 -0.01)=sqrt(0.99)=~0.99499 → 1/0.99499≈1.005.

So, 2 *1.005≈2.01.

1/sqrt(1 -0.04)=1/sqrt(0.96)=~1.0198.

So, sum is about 2.01 +1.0198=3.0298, which is very close to 3.0303.

So, x≈0.01 → beta=0.1 c.

Wow, that worked out nicely.

So, beta=0.1 c → v=0.1 c.

So, beta=0.1, v=0.1 c.

So, gamma1 = 1/sqrt(1 -0.01 )=1/sqrt(0.99)=~1.005034.

gamma2 =1/sqrt(1 -4*(0.01))=1/sqrt(0.96)=~1.0198039.

Now, let's compute the energies.

E1 = gamma1 m1 c² → 1.005034 * 198 GeV → 198 *1.005034≈199.0 GeV.

E2 = gamma2 m2 c² →1.0198039 *99 GeV≈ 100.96 GeV.

So, E1 + E2=199.0 +100.96≈300 GeV, which matches.

Now, the kinetic energies are,

K1 = E1 - m1 c² =199.0 -198=1.0 GeV.

K2=100.96 -99=1.96 GeV.

Wait, adding K1 and K2: 1.0 +1.96=2.96 GeV, which is approximately 3 GeV, considering rounding.

Wait, but in the non-relativistic case, K1 was exactly 1 GeV. But here, in the relativistic case, K1 is also 1 GeV. So the difference would be zero?

But that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait: if beta is 0.1 c, let me recheck.

gamma1=1/sqrt(1 -0.01)=1.005034.

E1=gamma1 * m1 c²=1.005034 *198 GeV=198 * 1.005034.

198 *1.005034 → 198 *1 =198, 198 *0.005034≈0.996. So E1≈198 +0.996≈198.996 GeV.

So, K1=E1 -m1 c²=198.996 -198=0.996 GeV ≈1 GeV.

Similarly, gamma2=1/sqrt(1-0.04)=1/sqrt(0.96) ≈1.0198.

E2=gamma2 *99 GeV=99 *1.0198≈99 *1.02=100.98 GeV.

K2=100.98 -99=1.98 GeV.

So, K1≈0.996 GeV≈1 GeV,

K2≈1.98 GeV.

Total KE≈3 GeV.

So, in the relativistic case, the more massive fragment has about 1 GeV KE, same as the non-relativistic case.

But wait, that can't be right because the KE in relativity should account for relativistic effects, but here it's the same as the non-relativistic case.

Wait, but in this specific case, the beta is 0.1 c, which is small, so the relativistic effects are minimal. So, the KE in the relativistic case is very close to the non-relativistic case.

So, the difference between T1 (correct) and K1_nonrel is negligible, but the options given are in the 2-20 MeV range.

Wait, but 0.996 GeV is approximately 1 GeV, so the difference is about 0.004 GeV, which is 4 MeV.

Wait, 0.004 GeV is 4 MeV.

But wait, in the relativistic case, K1 is 0.996 GeV → which is 996 MeV. The non-relativistic case is 1 GeV → 1000 MeV.

So, the difference is 1000 MeV -996 MeV =4 MeV.

But the options don't have 4 MeV as an option. The options are A)2, B)5, C)10, D)20.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me check the exact values.

gamma1=1/sqrt(0.99)=1.005033585.

gamma1=1.005033585.

E1=gamma1 * m1 c² = 1.005033585 *198 GeV.

198 *1.005033585 = 198 + (198 *0.005033585).

198 *0.005033585= approx 0.996.

So, E1≈198.996 GeV.

K1=E1 -198=0.996 GeV = 996 MeV.

In non-relativistic case, K1=1 GeV=1000 MeV.

So, the difference is 1000 -996=4 MeV.

But the options don't have 4 MeV. So, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the velocities and see where I went wrong.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, K1_nonrel=1 GeV.

In the relativistic case, K1 is 0.996 GeV.

So, the difference is 0.004 GeV =4 MeV.

But that's not one of the options. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption that beta is 0.1.

Wait, earlier when I computed with beta=0.1, the sum 2 gamma1 +gamma2 was 3.0298, which is very close to the desired 3.0303. So that's correct.

So, the correct calculation gives K1=0.996 GeV=996 MeV.

Non-relativistic is 1000 MeV.

Difference is 4 MeV, but this isn't an option.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, let me read the problem again.

Wait, the sum of the rest masses is 99% of M. So, m1 +m2=0.99 M.

But M has rest energy 300 GeV, so m1 c² +m2 c²=0.99 *300 GeV=297 GeV.

So, E_initial=300 GeV= sum of rest masses (297 GeV) + KE (3 GeV).

So, that's correct.

So, the problem states that the kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is T1. What's the difference between the correct T1 and the non-relativistic T1.

In the non-relativistic case, T1_nonrel=1 GeV.

In the relativistic case, T1_rel=0.996 GeV.

So, the difference is 0.004 GeV =4 MeV.

But the options don't have 4 MeV. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the non-relativistic case.

Wait, wait. Wait, in the non-relativistic case, the total KE is 3 GeV, but in the calculation, the more massive fragment's KE is 1 GeV, the other 2 GeV.

But perhaps in reality, in the relativistic case, the more massive fragment's KE is less than the non-relativistic case, but due to the small beta, the difference is about 4 MeV.

But the options given are A)2, B)5, C)10, D)20.

Hmm, perhaps the question is reversed. Perhaps the correct T1 is larger than the non-relat case?

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm incorrect in assuming that the non-relativistic calculation gives K1=1 GeV.

Wait, let me recheck the non-relativistic part.

In non-relativistic, I have:

m1=198 GeV/c²,

m2=99 GeV/c².

Momentum conservation: m1 v1 = - m2 v2 → 198 v1 = -99 v2 → v2 =-2 v1.

Kinetic energy:

K1 = 1/2 m1 v1²,

K2=1/2 m2 v2²=1/2 m2 (4 v1²)=2 m2 v1².

So, K1 + K2= (1/2 *198 v1^2 ) + (2 *99 v1^2 ) = (99 v1²) + (198 v1² )=297 v1² =3 GeV.

So, v1²=3 GeV /297 → v1²= (3e9 eV) / (297e9 eV) )= 3/297=1/99 → v1=1/sqrt(99) c ≈0.1005 c.

So,

K1_nonrel= (1/2) *198 GeV/c² * (c² /99 ) = (1/2)*198/99 * GeV → (1/2)*2 GeV=1 GeV.

So, that's correct.

In relativistic case, K1 is about 0.996 GeV, so the difference between T1 (correct) and K1_nonrel is 4 MeV.

But the options don't have 4, so perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated gamma2.

Wait, m2=99 GeV/c², v2=2 v1=0.201 c.

So, beta2=0.201.

gamma2=1/sqrt(1 - (0.201)^2 )=1/sqrt(1-0.040401)=1/sqrt(0.959599)=1/0.9796 ≈1.0208.

Wait, earlier I thought beta was 0.1, so beta2 would be 0.2, but I think I messed up the substitution.

Wait, wait, no. Earlier in the relativistic case, we found beta=0.1 c, so v=0.1 c.

Then, v2=-2 v= -0.2 c → beta2=0.2.

So, gamma2=1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 )=1/sqrt(0.96)= approx 1.0198.

Then,

E2=gamma2 * m2 c²=1.0198 *99 GeV=100.96 GeV.

So,

K2=E2 -m2 c²=100.96-99=1.96 GeV.

Similarly, E1=gamma1 * m1 c²=1.005034 *198 GeV=198.996 GeV.

K1=198.996-198=0.996 GeV.

So, sum of KEs=0.996 +1.96=2.956 GeV, which is about 3 GeV.

So, the calculation is correct.

So, the correct T1 is 0.996 GeV, non-relat is 1 GeV.

Difference is 1 -0.996=0.004 GeV=4 MeV.

But the options don't have 4 MeV. So, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the difference in kinetic energies, but the non-relativistic calculation is using a different approach. Or perhaps I swapped the fragments.

Wait, in the problem, the more massive fragment is m1, which in the non-relativistic case has K1=1 GeV.

In the relativistic case, it's 0.996 GeV.

So, the correct T1 is 0.996 GeV, which is 996 MeV.

Non-relat T1 is 1000 MeV.

So, difference is -4 MeV, but the question asks for the difference, perhaps absolute value, 4 MeV.

But the options are 2,5,10,20. So, perhaps the intended answer is B)5 MeV.

But why? I'm not getting 5 MeV.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the correct approach.

Alternative approach:

Perhaps the rest mass of the system is 0.99 M, so the Q of the reaction is 300 GeV -297 GeV=3 GeV.

In the center of mass frame, the two fragments move with equal and opposite momenta, so the kinetic energy is shared based on their masses.

Wait, but perhaps we can use the formula for two-body decay.

In two-body decay, the velocities can be found using the formula for each mass.

The general formula for the kinetic energy of each fragment in a two-body decay is:

K1 = [ (Q^2) (m2^2) ] / [ (m1 + m2)^2 (m1 + m2 + Q) ] * c^2.

Wait, perhaps I should use that formula.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Alternatively, for two-body decay, the velocities can be determined based on the masses and the Q value.

The formula for the velocity of each fragment is:

beta1 = ( (m1 + m2 + Q) ) / (2 (m1 + m2) ) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of energy and momentum.

But perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the kinetic energy in terms of the masses and the Q value.

In two-body decay, the kinetic energy of each fragment can be found using:

K1 = [ (Q)^2 m2^2 ] / [4 (m1 + m2)^2 (m1 + m2 + Q) ) ] * c^4.

Wait, perhaps. Let me try to find the correct formula.

Wait, I'm not confident about this approach, but perhaps using the formula would save time.

Given that, let's proceed.

Given:

m1=0.66 M,

m2=0.33 M.

Q=3 GeV.

So,

m1 +m2=0.99 M,

m1+ m2 + Q=0.99 M +3 GeV.

Wait, but M is 300 GeV/c².

Wait, but perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of M.

m1 =0.66 M,

m2=0.33 M,

Q=3 GeV.

But M is 300 GeV/c².

So,

m1 +m2=0.99 M,

m1 +m2 + Q=0.99 M +3 GeV.

Wait, but 3 GeV is much smaller than M*c²=300 GeV.

So, perhaps we can ignore Q compared to M.

Hmm, perhaps the formula for K1 is:

K1 = [ Q² m2^2 ] / [4 (m1 + m2)^2 (m1 + m2 + Q) ) ]

But let me compute this.

Plugging in:

Q=3 GeV,

m2=0.33 M,

m1 +m2=0.99 M,

m1 +m2 + Q=0.99 M +3.

So,

K1 = [ (3)^2 * (0.33 M)^2 ] / [4 (0.99 M)^2 (0.99 M +3) ) ]

But let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 9 * (0.33 M)^2 =9 *0.1089 M²=0.9801 M².

Denominator:4 * (0.99 M)^2 * (0.99 M +3) →4 * (0.9801 M²) * (0.99 M +3).

So,

K1= 0.9801 M² / [4 *0.9801 M² * (0.99 M +3) ) ].

Simplify:

0.9801 cancels,

So,

K1= 1 / [4 (0.99 M +3) ) ].

But M=300 GeV/c².

So,

0.99 M +3=0.99 *300 +3=297 +3=300 GeV/c².

So,

K1= 1/(4 *300) *c².

Wait, but units? Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the units. Because M is in GeV/c², and Q is in GeV.

Wait, perhaps the formula is in terms of energy squared, so I might have made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed numerically.

Wait, maybe it's better to not use this formula and instead proceed with the initial approach.

But given that, perhaps the correct K1 is about 0.996 GeV, non-relat is 1 GeV, difference is 0.004 GeV=4 MeV.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is B)5 MeV.

Wait, perhaps I have a miscalculation in the initial approach.

Wait, let me reevaluate the correct T1 and non-relativistic T1.

In the correct case, K1=0.996 GeV=996 MeV.

In the non-relativistic case, K1=1000 MeV.

Difference is 4 MeV, but the options don't have it.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the relativistic gamma and KE again.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I've made an error in calculating the gamma1 and gamma2.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact values.

Let me calculate gamma1 and gamma2 precisely.

gamma1=1/sqrt(1 - 0.1^2 )=1/sqrt(0.99)=1.005033585.

gamma1=1.005033585.

gamma2=1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 )=1/sqrt(0.96)=1.0198039.

So,

E1=gamma1 * m1 c²=1.005033585 *198 GeV=198 + (198 *0.005033585) GeV=198 + (approx 1.0) GeV=199 GeV.

So, K1=E1 -198=1 GeV.

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 198 GeV * 1.005033585 =198 + (198 *0.005033585) → 198 + (approx 1.0 GeV) → 199 GeV.

So, K1=1 GeV.

Wait, that can't be right. So, in the relativistic case, K1 is 1 GeV?

But earlier calculation said 0.996 GeV.

Ah, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exact calculation.

Wait, 198 GeV *1.005033585=?

198 *1.005033585 = 198 *1 +198 *0.005033585.

198 *0.005033585= approx 1.0 GeV.

So, 198 +1.0=199 GeV.

So, K1= E1 - m1 c²=199 -198=1 GeV.

Wait, but that's the same as the non-relativistic case.

But how?

Hmm, perhaps this indicates that the relativistic and non-relativistic KEs are the same in this case.

Which would imply that the difference is zero.

But that's conflicting with the earlier calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Alternatively, maybe the way I calculated the velocities was wrong.

Wait, perhaps the mistake lies in the assumption that beta is 0.1 c.

Wait, from earlier:

The equation 2 gamma1 + gamma2 =3.0303,

With beta=0.1 c, gives 2*1.005033585 +1.0198039=2.01006717 +1.0198039=3.02987107, which is approximately 3.0303.

So, it's correct.

But according to that, gamma1 is 1.005033585,

gamma2=1.0198039.

So,

E1=1.005033585 *198=198 + 198 *0.005033585 → 198 + (approx 1.0) → 199 GeV.

So, K1=1 GeV.

Hmm, but from that, K1 is same as non-relativistic case. So the difference is zero.

But the problem states that the sum of rest masses is 99% of M, which implies that the Q is 3 GeV, which is small, leading to small KEs, so relativistic effects are minimal.

So, perhaps the difference is negligible, but the options don't include zero.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps the calculation is correct, and the correct answer is a 4 MeV difference, but since that's not an option, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be 5 MeV, the closest option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should reevaluate the setup.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the initial setup is wrong. Let's think about the rest energy and the way KE is calculated.

Wait, the initial nucleus has rest energy 300 GeV. After fission, the rest masses sum to 297 GeV, so the energy released is 3 GeV, which is the total KE of the two fragments.

In the center of mass frame, each fragment's KE is determined by their mass and the total Q.

But perhaps an alternative way to calculate the correct KE is to use the formula for KE in two-body decay.

The formula for the kinetic energy of a fragment in a two-body decay is:

K = (Q^2 m2^2) / [4 (m1 + m2)^2 (m1 + m2 + Q) ) ] *c^2.

Wait, let me try that.

Given:

m1=0.66 M,

m2=0.33 M,

Q=3 GeV.

So,

K1 = (3^2 * (0.33 M)^2 ) / [4*(0.99 M)^2 * (0.99 M +3) ) ] *c^2.

But since M is in GeV/c², let's express everything in GeV.

But perhaps the formula is in terms of energy, so let me plug the numbers in terms of GeV.

But this might get complicated. Let me proceed step by step.

First, compute the numerator:

3^2 * (0.33 M)^2 =9 *0.33^2 M^2=9 *0.1089 M²=0.9801 M².

Denominator:

4*(0.99 M)^2*(0.99 M +3) =4 *0.9801 M² * (0.99 M +3).

So,

K1= (0.9801 M²) / [4 *0.9801 M² (0.99 M +3) ) ] *c^2.

Simplify:

M² cancels,

0.9801 cancels,

So,

K1= 1/(4*(0.99 M +3)) *c^2.

But M is 300 GeV/c², so 0.99 M=297 GeV/c².

So,

0.99 M +3=297 +3=300 GeV/c².

Thus,

K1=1/(4 *300) *c² * GeV.

Wait, but c² is in (GeV^2/(GeV/c^2)^2) → units are getting a bit messy.

Wait, perhaps the formula is better expressed in terms of energy.

Wait, perhaps I should compute:

K1= (Q² m2²) / [4 (m1 +m2)^2 (m1 +m2 + Q) ) ] * c^4.

But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed numerically.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct KE is the same as non-relativistic, so the difference is zero, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the relativistic case, the KE is higher.

Wait, but from the earlier calculation, K1 is same as non-relat.

Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the difference between the relativistic and non-relativistic KEs.

Wait, in the non-relativistic case, K1=1 GeV.

In the relativistic case, K1≈1 GeV.

So, the difference is negligible.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option B)5 MeV.

But why?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the velocities and the corresponding KE.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the fact that relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma-1) mc^2.

In the non-relativistic case, K=½ mv².

But perhaps the correct approach is to find the ratio between the two.

Wait, but I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 5 MeV, option B.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires calculating the difference as 5 MeV.

But given the initial calculation, the difference is 4 MeV, which isn't an option.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma1.

Wait, let me use more precise calculations.

With beta=0.1,

gamma1=1/sqrt(1 -0.01)=1.005033585.

E1=gamma1 * m1 c²=1.005033585 *198 GeV=198 + (198 *0.005033585)=198 + 1.0 GeV=199 GeV.

So, K1=1 GeV.

Wait, but m1 c²=198 GeV,

E1=199 GeV,

So, K1=1 GeV.

But wait, that suggests that in the relativistic case, K1 is exactly 1 GeV, same as non-relativistic.

So the difference is zero.

But this can't be right, because in reality, the KE in relativity should be higher or lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of gamma.

Wait, precisely,

gamma1=1/sqrt(1 -0.1^2)=1/sqrt(0.99)=approx 1.005033585.

So,

E1=1.005033585 *198 GeV=198 *1.005033585.

Let me compute 198 * 1.005033585 exactly.

198 *1=198.

198 *0.005033585 = approx 198 *0.005 =0.99, and 198 *0.000033585≈0.00665.

So, total is approx 0.99665.

So, E1≈198 +0.99665=198.99665 GeV.

So, K1=E1 -198=0.99665 GeV=996.65 MeV.

In non-relat, K1=1000 MeV.

So, difference is about 3.35 MeV.

Still, not matching any option.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the difference to be around 5 MeV, so option B.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the non-relativistic calculation gives T1=1 GeV, and the relativistic calculation gives T1=0.996 GeV, so the difference is 0.004 GeV=4 MeV. Since the options don't have this, perhaps the intended answer is B)5 MeV.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A)2 MeV.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact difference.

In the relativistic case, K1=0.99665 GeV=996.65 MeV.

Non-relat:1000 MeV.

Difference:3.335 MeV.

Approx 3.34 MeV.

So, the closest option is B)5 MeV.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of K1.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using exact values.

gamma1=1/sqrt(1 - (0.1)^2 )=1.005033585091.

So,

E1=gamma1 *198 =1.005033585091 *198=198 *1.005033585091.

Calculating 198 *1.005033585091:

198 *1=198.

198 *0.005033585091= let's compute exactly.

0.005033585091=approx 0.005033585.

198 *0.005033585= (200 *0.005033585) - (2 *0.005033585).

200 *0.005033585=1.006717 GeV.

2 *0.005033585=0.01006717 GeV.

So, 198 *0.005033585=1.006717 -0.01006717=0.9966498 GeV.

So, E1=198 +0.9966498=198.9966498 GeV.

Thus, K1=198.9966498 -198=0.9966498 GeV=996.6498 MeV.

So, the difference is 1000 -996.6498=3.3502 MeV.

Approximately 3.35 MeV.

But the options don't have this.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is B)5 MeV, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the difference to be 5 MeV.

But I'm not confident. Without further information, I'll proceed with the calculation and select the closest option, which is B)5 MeV.


The problem involves an atomic nucleus of rest mass \( M = 300 \, \text{GeV}/c^2 \) undergoing spontaneous fission into two fragments. The more massive fragment (\( m_1 \)) is twice as massive as the less massive fragment (\( m_2 \)), and the sum of their rest masses is \( 99\% \) of the initial mass, i.e., \( m_1 + m_2 = 0.99M \). The total kinetic energy of the two fragments is \( 3 \, \text{GeV} \), as the initial rest energy is \( 300 \, \text{GeV} \), and the rest energy of the fragments is \( 297 \, \text{GeV} \). The goal is to find the difference between the correct relativistic kinetic energy \( T_1 \) of the more massive fragment and the non-relativistic approximation.

### Key Calculations:
1. **Masses of the fragments**:
   - \( m_1 = 0.66M \), \( m_2 = 0.33M \).

2. **Non-relativistic case**:
   - Using momentum conservation, the velocities are related as \( v_2 = -2v_1 \).
   - Kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:
     \[
     K_{1,\text{non-rel}} = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 = 1 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]

3. **Relativistic case**:
   - The total energy of each fragment is \( E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 \) and \( E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \).
   - From momentum conservation, \( \gamma_1 m_1 v_1 = \gamma_2 m_2 v_2 \), leading to \( \gamma_1 = \gamma_2 \) for the given mass ratio.
   - Solving for \( \gamma_1 \) and \( \gamma_2 \), the velocities are found to be \( v_1 \approx 0.1c \) and \( v_2 \approx 0.2c \).
   - The relativistic kinetic energy of the more massive fragment is:
     \[
     K_{1,\text{rel}} = (\gamma_1 - 1)m_1 c^2 = 0.996 \, \text{GeV}.
     \]

4. **Difference between relativistic and non-relativistic kinetic energies**:
   - The difference is:
     \[
     \Delta K = |K_{1,\text{rel}} - K_{1,\text{non-rel}}| = |0.996 \, \text{GeV} - 1.000 \, \text{GeV}| = 0.004 \, \text{GeV} = 4 \, \text{MeV}.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The calculated difference is \( 4 \, \text{MeV} \), but this value is not among the provided options. The closest option is \( 5 \, \text{MeV} \), which is likely the intended answer.

**Answer: B**
