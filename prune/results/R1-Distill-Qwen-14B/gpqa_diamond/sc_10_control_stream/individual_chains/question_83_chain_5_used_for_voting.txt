Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we're titrating that diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options given are A, B, C, D with different pairs of pH values.

Hmm. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So this is a classic acid-base titration scenario. I remember that in such titrations, there are two main points to consider: before the equivalence point (where some of the acid has reacted with the base) and at the equivalence point (where all the acid has reacted with the base).

First, let's think about the initial dilution of the acetic acid. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Wait, no, wait—no, wait, wait, when we add 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of acetic acid, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration will change because we're diluting it.

The initial concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, which is the same volume as the acetic acid, the concentration becomes half, right? Because concentration is moles over volume, so if volume doubles, concentration halves. So the new concentration is 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. The moles of acetic acid before dilution would be Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So moles are still 0.001, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks about two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point.

Let's tackle the 25% titration first. So, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with the NaOH. Wait, no—wait, when you titrate, the NaOH is added until it's 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence. Or is it 25% of the moles required? I think it's the latter. So 25% of the moles of acetic acid are neutralized by the NaOH added.

So first, let's find how many moles of acetic acid we have in the diluted solution. We have 0.025 M in 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L). So moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. So at equivalence, all of these 0.001 moles would react with NaOH.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of acetic acid have reacted. So the reaction would convert some acetic acid (CH3COOH) into its conjugate base (CH3COO^- Na+).

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, the moles after reaction:

Moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.
Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 moles.

Now, the total volume of the solution at this point is the initial 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH added. Wait, but the NaOH is 0.1 M. So let's find out how much NaOH was added. Since 0.00025 moles of NaOH are needed (because it reacts 1:1 with acetic acid), the volume is moles / Molarity = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³. So the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

Wait, but maybe the question is assuming that at 25% titration, it's 25% of the equivalence point volume, not 25% of the moles. Hmm, that's a possibility. Oh wait, no, in titration, the percentage usually refers to the fraction of the moles neutralized. So 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized.

So, the solution at 25% titration is a buffer solution, because we have both the weak acid and its conjugate base present. So we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Given Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that.

log(1.85) is approximately 0.267, so 1.85e-5 is 10^-5 * 1.85, so log(1.85e-5)= log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa = 4.733.

So, [A^-] is the concentration of acetate ions, which is 0.00025 moles / 0.0425 L. [HA] is 0.00075 moles / 0.0425 L.

Wait, let me compute the ratio [A^-]/[HA]. The moles are 0.00025 and 0.00075, so the ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.

So log(1/3) is log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = pKa + (-0.477) → 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Let's approximate to 4.26. Hmm, but looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, option D is 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the moles after reaction: 0.00075 moles of HA and 0.00025 of A^-.

The ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) → the 0.0425 cancels out, so 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.

So the log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, approximately 4.26. So that's the pH at 25% titration. So looking at the options, option A's first value is 4.26. But let's see what else is going on.

Now, moving on to the equivalence point. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So the solution will contain the conjugate base of acetic acid, which is acetate ions (CH3COO^-), dissolved in water. Since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH^- ions, making the solution basic.

So the concentration of acetate ions can be found by looking at the moles and the total volume at equivalence.

The moles of acetic acid initially were 0.001 moles. So at equivalence, all of that has been converted to acetate. The volume of NaOH added to reach equivalence is (moles of NaOH) / (0.1 M). Moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 moles. So volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So the total solution volume is initial 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate ions will hydrolyze in water as follows: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So we can use the approximation for weak bases, where [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C), since Kb is much smaller than C.

So [OH^-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let's compute that. Log(3.288) is about 0.516, so -log(3.288e-6) is 5 - 0.516 = 4.484. So pH is 14 - 4.484 ≈ 9.516. Wait, but none of the options have a pH around 9.5. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me check the calculations again. At equivalence point, the solution is made of NaCH3COO, which is acetate. The moles are 0.001, and the volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M, correct.

Wait, Kb for acetate is 5.405e-10. So Kb*C = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. The square root is sqrt(1.081e-11) = 3.288e-6 M. So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6. pOH is around 5.484? Wait, wait, wait. Log(3.288e-6) is calculated as follows.

Let me compute it more accurately. 3.288e-6 = 3.288 × 10^-6.

Log(3.288) is approximately 0.5168. So log(3.288e-6) = 0.5168 -6 = -5.4832. So pOH is 5.4832. Therefore, pH is 14 - 5.4832 = 8.5168, approximately 8.52. Hmm, that's what I calculated earlier for the equivalence point. So the pH is about 8.52.

But looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So that seems to match the 25% titration pH and the equivalence point pH.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the equivalence point, I thought the pH would be about 8.52, which would match option A. But wait, the options given are A) 4.26; 8.52, B)3.17;6.73, etc.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the solution at equivalence is not just the hydrolysis of acetate. Because when you dilute the solution, perhaps the activity coefficients change, but I think that's beyond the scope here. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the Kb calculation. Ka is 1.85e-5. Kb is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10. Correct.

So [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt( (5.405e-10) * 0.02 ) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6. So pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.484, so pH = 14 -5.484 ≈ 8.516, which rounds to 8.52. So that's correct.

So the equivalence point pH is approximately 8.52, matching option A's second value. But option A's first value is 4.26, which matches our 25% titration calculation.

Wait, but I thought the options might have different answers. Let me look again at the options.

Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the 25% titration?

Let me think again. At 25% titration, the buffer solution is present. The moles of HA are 0.00075, and A- is 0.00025. So the ratio A-/HA is 1/3.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log(1/3) → pKa is 4.733, so pH is 4.733 + log(0.3333) → log(0.3333) is about -0.477, so 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which is 4.26. So that's correct.

So the pH at 25% is 4.26, and at equivalence about 8.52. So option A is 4.26;8.52. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait a minute, but looking at the options again:

Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, where would 4.57 come from?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the pKa. Let me recheck.

Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute this accurately.

Let me compute log(1.85). 10^0.267 is approximately 1.85, because 10^0.267 ≈ 1.85.

Wait, let's compute it more accurately. Let me use natural logarithm to approximate.

Wait, no, perhaps using a calculator is better. But since I can't use a calculator, I'll approximate.

Ka is 1.85e-5 → pKa = 4.733 (as I had earlier). So that part is correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I messed up the dilution. Let me check the initial concentration.

Original volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, so moles are 0.05 * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Correct. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, another thought: when titrating, the NaOH is added, so the total volume increases. So at 25% titration, not only the volume from the diluted acetic acid but also the added NaOH contributes to the total volume. Oh wait, I think I accounted for that. Because I added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, making the total volume 42.5 cm³.

Wait, perhaps I didn't account for the dilution correctly. Let me see: the moles of HA and A- are correct, but when calculating the concentrations, the volume is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333. So that's correct.

So pH = pKa + log(0.3333) → 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256. So 4.26, correct.

So for 25% titration, pH is 4.26, and at equivalence, 8.52. So option A is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. How could that be? Did I miss something in the problem?

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the dilution. Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, then we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³, correct. So the concentration becomes 0.025 M. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the NaOH is 0.1 M, which is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. But I think I accounted for that in calculating the moles.

Wait, another possibility: maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point. Let me recompute.

At equivalence, moles of acetate are 0.001 moles. Volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M, correct.

Kb = 5.405e-10. So Kb * C = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Square root is 3.288e-6. pOH is 5.484, pH is 8.516. So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question is about at 25% of the NaOH volume, not 25% of the moles. Because sometimes, titration percentages can be ambiguous. But in standard titration, the percentage refers to the moles neutralized, not the volume.

Wait, but perhaps the question uses the approach where 25% of the solution has been titrated by volume. No, that's not standard. So I think the calculation is correct.

So the correct answer should be option A: 4.26 at 25% and 8.52 at equivalence.

But looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52, which matches our calculations. But looking at the options, option D is 4.57;6.92. So I'm confident that A is correct.

Wait, but wait: another approach. Maybe the question is about the pH at 25% of the equivalence point in terms of moles. Wait, no, I think I did it correctly.

So the answer should be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the dilution of acetic acid. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ at a concentration of 0.05 M, containing **0.001 moles** of acetic acid. Upon adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³, diluting the concentration to **0.025 M**.

Next, we consider the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The problem asks for the pH at **25% titration** and at the **equivalence point**.

---

### **25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid moles have reacted with NaOH. Since there are 0.001 moles of acetic acid, 0.00025 moles of acetic acid have been neutralized, leaving:

- **Moles of CH₃COOH (HA)**: \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles} \)
- **Moles of CH₃COO⁻ (A⁻)**: \( 0.00025 \, \text{moles} \)

The total volume of the solution is the initial 40.00 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH added. The moles of NaOH added are 0.00025, so the volume of NaOH is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{moles of NaOH}}{\text{concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.00025}{0.1} = 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

Thus, the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}
\]

The concentrations of HA and A⁻ are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} = 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} = 0.00588 \, \text{M}
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right)
\]

The \( \text{pKa} \) is calculated from \( \text{Ka} = 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \):

\[
\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733
\]

The ratio \( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} = \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} = \frac{1}{3} \), so:

\[
\log \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \approx -0.477
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 - 0.477 \approx 4.256 \, \text{(rounded to 4.26)}
\]

---

### **Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid have reacted with NaOH, forming 0.001 moles of acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻). The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0500 \, \text{L}
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH₃COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.0500} = 0.020 \, \text{M}
\]

Acetate ions hydrolyze in water:

\[
\text{CH₃COO}^- + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH}^-
\]

The \( \text{K}_b \) for acetate is calculated from \( \text{K}_a \) and \( \text{K}_w \):

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}
\]

Using the approximation for weak bases:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{\text{K}_b \cdot [\text{CH₃COO}^-]} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.020} = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.484
\]

Thus, the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.484 \approx 8.516 \, \text{(rounded to 8.52)}
\]

---

### **Final Answer**
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we're diluting 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then we're titrating that diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. We need to find the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options given are A, B, C, D with different pairs of pH values.

Hmm. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. So this is a classic acid-base titration scenario. I remember that in such titrations, there are two main points to consider: before the equivalence point (where some of the acid has reacted with the base) and at the equivalence point (where all the acid has reacted with the base).

First, let's think about the initial dilution of the acetic acid. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we add another 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume becomes 40 cm³. Wait, no, wait—no, wait, wait, when we add 20 cm³ of water to 20 cm³ of acetic acid, the total volume becomes 40 cm³. So the concentration will change because we're diluting it.

The initial concentration is 0.05 M. After adding 20 cm³ of water, which is the same volume as the acetic acid, the concentration becomes half, right? Because concentration is moles over volume, so if volume doubles, concentration halves. So the new concentration is 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. The moles of acetic acid before dilution would be Molarity × Volume (in liters). So 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40 cm³, which is 0.04 L. So moles are still 0.001, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Yep, that's correct.

Next, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The question asks about two points: 25% titration and the equivalence point.

Let's tackle the 25% titration first. So, 25% of the acetic acid has reacted with the NaOH. Wait, no—wait, when you titrate, the NaOH is added until it's 25% of the volume needed to reach equivalence. Or is it 25% of the moles required? I think it's the latter. So 25% of the moles of acetic acid are neutralized by the NaOH added.

So first, let's find how many moles of acetic acid we have in the diluted solution. We have 0.025 M in 0.04 L (since 40 cm³ is 0.04 L). So moles = 0.025 * 0.04 = 0.001 moles. So at equivalence, all of these 0.001 moles would react with NaOH.

At 25% titration, 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles of acetic acid have reacted. So the reaction would convert some acetic acid (CH3COOH) into its conjugate base (CH3COO^- Na+).

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

So, the moles after reaction:

Moles of CH3COOH remaining: 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles.
Moles of CH3COO^- formed: 0.00025 moles.

Now, the total volume of the solution at this point is the initial 40 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH added. Wait, but the NaOH is 0.1 M. So let's find out how much NaOH was added. Since 0.00025 moles of NaOH are needed (because it reacts 1:1 with acetic acid), the volume is moles / Molarity = 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L, which is 2.5 cm³. So the total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³, which is 0.0425 L.

Wait, but maybe the question is assuming that at 25% titration, it's 25% of the equivalence point volume, not 25% of the moles. Hmm, that's a possibility. Oh wait, no, in titration, the percentage usually refers to the fraction of the moles neutralized. So 25% of the moles of acetic acid have been neutralized.

So, the solution at 25% titration is a buffer solution, because we have both the weak acid and its conjugate base present. So we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

The pKa is the negative log of Ka. Given Ka is 1.85e-5, so pKa = log(1/(1.85e-5)) = log(1) - log(1.85e-5) → wait, no, pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute that.

log(1.85) is approximately 0.267, so 1.85e-5 is 10^-5 * 1.85, so log(1.85e-5)= log(1.85) + log(1e-5) = 0.267 -5 = -4.733. So pKa = 4.733.

So, [A^-] is the concentration of acetate ions, which is 0.00025 moles / 0.0425 L. [HA] is 0.00075 moles / 0.0425 L.

Wait, let me compute the ratio [A^-]/[HA]. The moles are 0.00025 and 0.00075, so the ratio is 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3 ≈ 0.3333.

So log(1/3) is log(0.3333) ≈ -0.477.

So pH = pKa + (-0.477) → 4.733 - 0.477 ≈ 4.256. Let's approximate to 4.26. Hmm, but looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52, option D is 4.57 and 6.92.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, the moles after reaction: 0.00075 moles of HA and 0.00025 of A^-.

The ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (0.00025 / 0.0425) / (0.00075 / 0.0425) → the 0.0425 cancels out, so 0.00025 / 0.00075 = 1/3.

So the log(1/3) is about -0.477. So pH = 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, approximately 4.26. So that's the pH at 25% titration. So looking at the options, option A's first value is 4.26. But let's see what else is going on.

Now, moving on to the equivalence point. At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has reacted with NaOH. So the solution will contain the conjugate base of acetic acid, which is acetate ions (CH3COO^-), dissolved in water. Since acetate is the conjugate base of a weak acid, it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH^- ions, making the solution basic.

So the concentration of acetate ions can be found by looking at the moles and the total volume at equivalence.

The moles of acetic acid initially were 0.001 moles. So at equivalence, all of that has been converted to acetate. The volume of NaOH added to reach equivalence is (moles of NaOH) / (0.1 M). Moles of NaOH needed is 0.001 moles. So volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L, which is 10 cm³.

So the total solution volume is initial 40 cm³ + 10 cm³ = 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So the concentration of acetate is 0.001 moles / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Now, acetate ions will hydrolyze in water as follows: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction can be found from Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of acetate is 0.02 M. So we can use the approximation for weak bases, where [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C), since Kb is much smaller than C.

So [OH^-] = sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

pOH is -log(3.288e-6). Let's compute that. Log(3.288) is about 0.516, so -log(3.288e-6) is 5 - 0.516 = 4.484. So pH is 14 - 4.484 ≈ 9.516. Wait, but none of the options have a pH around 9.5. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me check the calculations again. At equivalence point, the solution is made of NaCH3COO, which is acetate. The moles are 0.001, and the volume is 50 cm³ (0.05 L). So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M, correct.

Wait, Kb for acetate is 5.405e-10. So Kb*C = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. The square root is sqrt(1.081e-11) = 3.288e-6 M. So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6. pOH is around 5.484? Wait, wait, wait. Log(3.288e-6) is calculated as follows.

Let me compute it more accurately. 3.288e-6 = 3.288 × 10^-6.

Log(3.288) is approximately 0.5168. So log(3.288e-6) = 0.5168 -6 = -5.4832. So pOH is 5.4832. Therefore, pH is 14 - 5.4832 = 8.5168, approximately 8.52. Hmm, that's what I calculated earlier for the equivalence point. So the pH is about 8.52.

But looking at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52. So that seems to match the 25% titration pH and the equivalence point pH.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the equivalence point, I thought the pH would be about 8.52, which would match option A. But wait, the options given are A) 4.26; 8.52, B)3.17;6.73, etc.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the solution at equivalence is not just the hydrolysis of acetate. Because when you dilute the solution, perhaps the activity coefficients change, but I think that's beyond the scope here. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the Kb calculation. Ka is 1.85e-5. Kb is Kw / Ka = (1e-14)/(1.85e-5) = approx 5.405e-10. Correct.

So [OH^-] = sqrt(Kb * C) = sqrt( (5.405e-10) * 0.02 ) = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 3.288e-6. So pOH = -log(3.288e-6) ≈ 5.484, so pH = 14 -5.484 ≈ 8.516, which rounds to 8.52. So that's correct.

So the equivalence point pH is approximately 8.52, matching option A's second value. But option A's first value is 4.26, which matches our 25% titration calculation.

Wait, but I thought the options might have different answers. Let me look again at the options.

Option D says 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm. Did I make a mistake in the 25% titration?

Let me think again. At 25% titration, the buffer solution is present. The moles of HA are 0.00075, and A- is 0.00025. So the ratio A-/HA is 1/3.

Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: pH = pKa + log(1/3) → pKa is 4.733, so pH is 4.733 + log(0.3333) → log(0.3333) is about -0.477, so 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256, which is 4.26. So that's correct.

So the pH at 25% is 4.26, and at equivalence about 8.52. So option A is 4.26;8.52. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait a minute, but looking at the options again:

Option D is 4.57 and 6.92. Hmm, where would 4.57 come from?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the pKa. Let me recheck.

Ka is 1.85e-5. So pKa is -log(1.85e-5). Let me compute this accurately.

Let me compute log(1.85). 10^0.267 is approximately 1.85, because 10^0.267 ≈ 1.85.

Wait, let's compute it more accurately. Let me use natural logarithm to approximate.

Wait, no, perhaps using a calculator is better. But since I can't use a calculator, I'll approximate.

Ka is 1.85e-5 → pKa = 4.733 (as I had earlier). So that part is correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I messed up the dilution. Let me check the initial concentration.

Original volume is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, so moles are 0.05 * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles. Correct. After adding 20 cm³ of water, the volume is 40 cm³, so concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. Correct.

Wait, another thought: when titrating, the NaOH is added, so the total volume increases. So at 25% titration, not only the volume from the diluted acetic acid but also the added NaOH contributes to the total volume. Oh wait, I think I accounted for that. Because I added 2.5 cm³ of NaOH, making the total volume 42.5 cm³.

Wait, perhaps I didn't account for the dilution correctly. Let me see: the moles of HA and A- are correct, but when calculating the concentrations, the volume is 42.5 cm³ (0.0425 L).

So [HA] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = 0.017647 M.

[A-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 = 0.005882 M.

So the ratio [A-]/[HA] is 0.005882 / 0.017647 = 0.3333. So that's correct.

So pH = pKa + log(0.3333) → 4.733 - 0.477 = 4.256. So 4.26, correct.

So for 25% titration, pH is 4.26, and at equivalence, 8.52. So option A is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 4.57 and 6.92. How could that be? Did I miss something in the problem?

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the dilution. Wait, the initial solution is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, then we add 20 cm³ of water. So the total volume is 40 cm³, correct. So the concentration becomes 0.025 M. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the NaOH is 0.1 M, which is a strong base, so it dissociates completely. But I think I accounted for that in calculating the moles.

Wait, another possibility: maybe I made a mistake in the equivalence point. Let me recompute.

At equivalence, moles of acetate are 0.001 moles. Volume is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M, correct.

Kb = 5.405e-10. So Kb * C = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11. Square root is 3.288e-6. pOH is 5.484, pH is 8.516. So that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps the question is about at 25% of the NaOH volume, not 25% of the moles. Because sometimes, titration percentages can be ambiguous. But in standard titration, the percentage refers to the moles neutralized, not the volume.

Wait, but perhaps the question uses the approach where 25% of the solution has been titrated by volume. No, that's not standard. So I think the calculation is correct.

So the correct answer should be option A: 4.26 at 25% and 8.52 at equivalence.

But looking at the options, option A is 4.26;8.52, which matches our calculations. But looking at the options, option D is 4.57;6.92. So I'm confident that A is correct.

Wait, but wait: another approach. Maybe the question is about the pH at 25% of the equivalence point in terms of moles. Wait, no, I think I did it correctly.

So the answer should be option A.


To solve the problem, we begin by analyzing the dilution of acetic acid. The initial volume of acetic acid is 20.00 cm³ at a concentration of 0.05 M, containing **0.001 moles** of acetic acid. Upon adding 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume becomes 40.00 cm³, diluting the concentration to **0.025 M**.

Next, we consider the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. The problem asks for the pH at **25% titration** and at the **equivalence point**.

---

### **25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid moles have reacted with NaOH. Since there are 0.001 moles of acetic acid, 0.00025 moles of acetic acid have been neutralized, leaving:

- **Moles of CH₃COOH (HA)**: \( 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles} \)
- **Moles of CH₃COO⁻ (A⁻)**: \( 0.00025 \, \text{moles} \)

The total volume of the solution is the initial 40.00 cm³ plus the volume of NaOH added. The moles of NaOH added are 0.00025, so the volume of NaOH is:

\[
\text{Volume of NaOH} = \frac{\text{moles of NaOH}}{\text{concentration of NaOH}} = \frac{0.00025}{0.1} = 0.0025 \, \text{L} = 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

Thus, the total volume is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}
\]

The concentrations of HA and A⁻ are:

\[
[\text{HA}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} = 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{A}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} = 0.00588 \, \text{M}
\]

Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

\[
\text{pH} = \text{pKa} + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right)
\]

The \( \text{pKa} \) is calculated from \( \text{Ka} = 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \):

\[
\text{pKa} = -\log(1.85 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.733
\]

The ratio \( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} = \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} = \frac{1}{3} \), so:

\[
\log \left( \frac{1}{3} \right) \approx -0.477
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{pH} = 4.733 - 0.477 \approx 4.256 \, \text{(rounded to 4.26)}
\]

---

### **Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all 0.001 moles of acetic acid have reacted with NaOH, forming 0.001 moles of acetate ions (CH₃COO⁻). The total volume of the solution is:

\[
\text{Total volume} = 40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0500 \, \text{L}
\]

The concentration of acetate ions is:

\[
[\text{CH₃COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.0500} = 0.020 \, \text{M}
\]

Acetate ions hydrolyze in water:

\[
\text{CH₃COO}^- + \text{H₂O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH₃COOH} + \text{OH}^-
\]

The \( \text{K}_b \) for acetate is calculated from \( \text{K}_a \) and \( \text{K}_w \):

\[
\text{K}_b = \frac{\text{K}_w}{\text{K}_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.405 \times 10^{-10}
\]

Using the approximation for weak bases:

\[
[\text{OH}^-] = \sqrt{\text{K}_b \cdot [\text{CH₃COO}^-]} = \sqrt{(5.405 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.020} = \sqrt{1.081 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}
\]

The pOH is:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log(3.288 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 5.484
\]

Thus, the pH is:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 5.484 \approx 8.516 \, \text{(rounded to 8.52)}
\]

---

### **Final Answer**
The pH at 25% titration is approximately **4.26**, and the pH at the equivalence point is approximately **8.52**. Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
