Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants are involved when dealing with complex ions. Let me try to break this down.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. And we're asked about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions attached, right? So that would be the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which I think is the third complex since β3 is 63. Wait, no, maybe the numbering is different. Let me think about the complexes.

The general form for these complexes would be [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n), I guess. So for n=1, it's [CoSCN]^+; n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0; n=3, [Co(SCN)_3]^-; n=4, [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. But wait, I'm not sure about the charges. Alternatively, maybe each SCN- is a -1 charge, so each adds one. The Co is +2, so for each SCN, the charge decreases by one. So [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n). So for n=2, the complex is neutral. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that matters right now.

The problem is about the distribution of the various cobalt species. The stability constants (β) tell us how much each complex is favored. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So β3 is the highest here (63), so the [Co(SCN)_3]^- complex is the most stable, followed by β2 (40), then β4 (16), and β1 is 9.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, the blue one. I remember that the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex is blue. So that's the one with n=2. So we're being asked for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 in the solution.

So how do I calculate that? I think this involves using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions to find the distribution of each complex.

I remember that the fraction of each complex can be found using the formula involving the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. The general approach is to calculate the fraction for each possible complex and then sum them up. Then, the fraction for the desired complex is multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.

The formula for each complex fraction is something like (β_n * [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + sum over all β_k [SCN^-]^k ), where k ranges from 0 to 4 (since β1 to β4 are given, but maybe n can be 0 to 4). Wait, no, because each β corresponds to a certain n. Let me think. Oh wait, the stability constants given are for the complexes [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n). So for each n, βn is the stability constant for that complex.

Wait, I think the general distribution is given by the formation of each complex step by step. For each possible n (1, 2, 3, 4), the fraction fn is (βn * [SCN]^n) / (sum over all m of βm * [SCN]^m), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, wait. The formula for the fraction of a particular species is (βn * [SCN]^n) divided by the sum of (βm * [SCN]^m) for m from 0 to 4. But wait, wait, the [Co] is the total Co concentration. Oh, wait, the Co is present as the free ion and in the complexes. So the sum of all the complex fractions plus the free Co concentration equals the total Co concentration.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach it by considering that the total concentration of Co is the sum of all the complexes plus the free Co^2+ ions. But in this case, since the solution is such that the Co is either in a complex or as Co^2+.

Wait, no, the problem states that the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So the sum of all the species (Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3]^-, [Co(SCN)_4]^2−) must equal 1e-2 M. Hmm, but wait, each complex represents a certain number of Co ions. So each complex has one Co ion. So, the sum of the concentrations of all the complexes and the free Co^2+ equals the total Co concentration.

But perhaps, since the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is relatively high, the majority of Co will be in the complexes. So maybe the free Co^2+ is negligible? Not sure yet. Alternatively, perhaps the [Co] is the sum of all the complexes and the free ion, but the complexes' concentrations are given by their respective fractions.

Wait, the approach I think is correct is to model the distribution of Co species using the stability constants and the concentrations of SCN^-.

The fraction of each complex is given by the formula:

fn = (βn * [SCN]^n) / K_total

where K_total is the sum over all m of (βm * [SCN]^m )

Wait, but β0 would be 1, since that's the free ion. Because for n=0, the complex is just Co^2+ and β0 is 1. But in the given βs, β1 is for n=1, β2 for n=2, etc. So perhaps I'm missing β0, but in reality, β0 is 1, so I can include it.

Wait, no. Wait, the stability constant β for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) is defined as:

βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n^(2−n)] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So for each n, the concentration of the complex is given by βn multiplied by [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

But the problem is that [Co^2+] is part of the expression, which complicates things because the sum of all the complex concentrations plus [Co^2+] equals the total Co concentration.

Wait, perhaps I can express all the concentrations in terms of [Co^2+], and then solve for it.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x. Then, the concentration of each complex would be:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN]^1 = 9 * x * 0.1

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 * x * [SCN]^2 = 40 * x * (0.1)^2

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 * x * [SCN]^3 = 63 * x * (0.1)^3

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- = β4 * x * [SCN]^4 = 16 * x * (0.1)^4

The free Co^2+ is x.

The total Co is the sum of all these, so:

x + (9 x * 0.1) + (40 x * 0.01) + (63 x * 0.001) + (16 x * 0.0001) = 1e-2

Factor out x:

x [1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001) ] = 1e-2

Let me compute each term:

1 is 1.

9 * 0.1 = 0.9

40 * 0.01 = 0.4

63 * 0.001 = 0.063

16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016

Adding them up:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

So the equation becomes:

x * 2.3646 = 1e-2 → x = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 4.225e-3 M.

Wait, so [Co^2+] is about 0.004225 M.

Now, to find the concentration of each complex:

[CoSCN]^+ = 9 * 0.004225 * 0.1 = 9 * 0.0004225 = 0.0038025 M

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = 40 * 0.004225 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.004225 * 0.01 = 40 * 0.00004225 = 0.00169 M

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = 63 * 0.004225 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.004225 * 0.001 = 63 * 0.000004225 ≈ 0.000266 M

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- = 16 * 0.004225 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.004225 * 0.0001 = 16 * 0.0000004225 ≈ 0.00000676 M

Let me check the sum:

x ≈ 0.004225

[CoSCN]^+ ≈ 0.0038025

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 ≈ 0.00169

[Co(SCN)_3]^- ≈ 0.000266

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- ≈ 0.00000676

Adding these:

0.004225 + 0.0038025 = 0.0080275

+ 0.00169 → 0.0097175

+ 0.000266 → 0.0099835

+ 0.00000676 → ~0.00999026

Which is approximately 0.01, which matches the total Co concentration. So that looks okay.

Now, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Its concentration is 0.00169 M.

So the fraction is (0.00169) / (0.01) ) * 100% → 16.9%? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the total Co is 0.01 M, so each complex's concentration divided by 0.01 gives the mole fraction, which multiplied by 100 gives the percentage.

Wait, wait, no, because all the concentrations are already in terms of moles per liter, and the total Co is 0.01 M. So the percentage is ( [Co(SCN)_2]^0 / 0.01 ) * 100.

So [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 0.00169 M. So 0.00169 / 0.01 = 0.169 → 16.9%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check because the problem says "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." So dithiocyanato is two SCN- per Co, correct? So that's [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So yes, my calculation is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because β3 is the largest, so [Co(SCN)_3]^- should be the most abundant, right? But according to the calculation, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 has a concentration of 0.00169 M, which is 16.9% of the total Co.

Wait, but in the sum, [Co^2+] is about 4.225e-3 M, which is 42.25% of the total Co. [CoSCN]^+ is about 38%, and [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 16.9%, [Co(SCN)_3]^- is about 2.66%, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is 0.0676%. So the dominant species is [CoSCN]^+ (38%), then Co^2+ (42%), then [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (16.9%).

But wait, β3 is the largest, so why isn't [Co(SCN)_3]^- the most abundant? Because the [SCN^-] is only 0.1 M. So when [SCN^-] is low, even with a high β, the product [SCN^-]^n might not make the higher complexes dominant. For example, [Co(SCN)_3]^- has β3=63, but [SCN^-]^3 is (0.1)^3=0.001, so the product is 63 * x * 0.001. But for [CoSCN]^+, β1=9, and [SCN^-] is 0.1, so 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x. So when x is 0.004225, 0.9 x is about 0.0038 M, which is larger than 40 x *0.01=0.00169 M for the [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Hmm, makes sense.

So the percentages are as follows:

[Co^2+] → 42.25%

[CoSCN]^+ → 38.025%

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 → 16.9%

[Co(SCN)_3]^- → 2.66%

[Co(SCN)_4]^2− → 0.0676%

So the blue complex is 16.9%, which is option D.

To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β) and the given concentrations of Co(II) and SCN⁻. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and the SCN⁻ concentration is 0.1 M.

### Key Steps:
1. **Stability Constants and Complex Formation**:  
   The stability constants are given as β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16. These correspond to the complexes [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-,[Co(SCN)_4]^2−. The fraction of each complex is determined by the formula:  
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n \cdot [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m \cdot [\text{SCN}]^m}
   \]  
   where β₀ = 1 (representing the free Co²⁺ ion).

2. **Total Co Concentration**:  
   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}]_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}]
   \]  
   Using the stability constants and the given [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, the fractions of all species are calculated, and their sum is normalized to the total cobalt concentration, 10⁻² M.

3. **Calculation of [Co²⁺]**:  
   Let [Co²⁺] = \(x\). The concentrations of the complexes are expressed in terms of \(x\) and [SCN⁻], and the total cobalt concentration is used to solve for \(x\):  
   \[
   x \cdot \left(1 + 9 \cdot 0.1 + 40 \cdot 0.01 + 63 \cdot 0.001 + 16 \cdot 0.0001\right) = 10^{-2}
   \]  
   Simplifying the terms inside the parentheses:  
   \[
   1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]  
   Solving for \(x\):  
   \[
   x = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.225 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
   \]

4. **Concentrations of Complexes**:  
   Using \(x = 4.225 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\), the concentrations of the complexes are calculated as:  
   - [CoSCN]⁺ = \(9 \cdot x \cdot 0.1 = 0.0038025 \, \text{M}\)  
   - [Co(SCN)_2]⁰ = \(40 \cdot x \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.00169 \, \text{M}\)  
   - [Co(SCN)_3]⁻ = \(63 \cdot x \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.000266 \, \text{M}\)  
   - [Co(SCN)_4]²⁻ = \(16 \cdot x \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.00000676 \, \text{M}\)

5. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]⁰**:  
   The percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]⁰ is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0]}{[\text{Co}]_{\text{total}}} \cdot 100 = \frac{0.00169}{0.01} \cdot 100 = 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]⁰, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution is **16.9%**.

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about cobalt complexes and their stability constants. Hmm, I remember that stability constants are involved when dealing with complex ions. Let me try to break this down.

The question says we have a solution with Co(II) ions and thiocyanate (SCN-). The concentration of Co is 1e-2 M, and the [SCN-] is 0.1 M. The stability constants (β) are given as β1=9, β2=40, β3=63, β4=16. And we're asked about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes. Wait, dithiocyanato would mean two SCN- ions attached, right? So that would be the Co(SCN)_2^2+ complex, which I think is the third complex since β3 is 63. Wait, no, maybe the numbering is different. Let me think about the complexes.

The general form for these complexes would be [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n), I guess. So for n=1, it's [CoSCN]^+; n=2, [Co(SCN)_2]^0; n=3, [Co(SCN)_3]^-; n=4, [Co(SCN)_4]^2−. But wait, I'm not sure about the charges. Alternatively, maybe each SCN- is a -1 charge, so each adds one. The Co is +2, so for each SCN, the charge decreases by one. So [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n). So for n=2, the complex is neutral. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that matters right now.

The problem is about the distribution of the various cobalt species. The stability constants (β) tell us how much each complex is favored. The higher the β, the more stable the complex. So β3 is the highest here (63), so the [Co(SCN)_3]^- complex is the most stable, followed by β2 (40), then β4 (16), and β1 is 9.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complexes. Wait, the blue one. I remember that the [Co(SCN)_2]^0 complex is blue. So that's the one with n=2. So we're being asked for the percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]^0 in the solution.

So how do I calculate that? I think this involves using the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions to find the distribution of each complex.

I remember that the fraction of each complex can be found using the formula involving the stability constants and the concentrations of the ions. The general approach is to calculate the fraction for each possible complex and then sum them up. Then, the fraction for the desired complex is multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.

The formula for each complex fraction is something like (β_n * [SCN^-]^n) / (1 + sum over all β_k [SCN^-]^k ), where k ranges from 0 to 4 (since β1 to β4 are given, but maybe n can be 0 to 4). Wait, no, because each β corresponds to a certain n. Let me think. Oh wait, the stability constants given are for the complexes [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n). So for each n, βn is the stability constant for that complex.

Wait, I think the general distribution is given by the formation of each complex step by step. For each possible n (1, 2, 3, 4), the fraction fn is (βn * [SCN]^n) / (sum over all m of βm * [SCN]^m), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, wait. The formula for the fraction of a particular species is (βn * [SCN]^n) divided by the sum of (βm * [SCN]^m) for m from 0 to 4. But wait, wait, the [Co] is the total Co concentration. Oh, wait, the Co is present as the free ion and in the complexes. So the sum of all the complex fractions plus the free Co concentration equals the total Co concentration.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach it by considering that the total concentration of Co is the sum of all the complexes plus the free Co^2+ ions. But in this case, since the solution is such that the Co is either in a complex or as Co^2+.

Wait, no, the problem states that the total cobalt concentration is c(Co) = 1e-2 M. So the sum of all the species (Co^2+, [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2], [Co(SCN)_3]^-, [Co(SCN)_4]^2−) must equal 1e-2 M. Hmm, but wait, each complex represents a certain number of Co ions. So each complex has one Co ion. So, the sum of the concentrations of all the complexes and the free Co^2+ equals the total Co concentration.

But perhaps, since the [SCN^-] is 0.1 M, which is relatively high, the majority of Co will be in the complexes. So maybe the free Co^2+ is negligible? Not sure yet. Alternatively, perhaps the [Co] is the sum of all the complexes and the free ion, but the complexes' concentrations are given by their respective fractions.

Wait, the approach I think is correct is to model the distribution of Co species using the stability constants and the concentrations of SCN^-.

The fraction of each complex is given by the formula:

fn = (βn * [SCN]^n) / K_total

where K_total is the sum over all m of (βm * [SCN]^m )

Wait, but β0 would be 1, since that's the free ion. Because for n=0, the complex is just Co^2+ and β0 is 1. But in the given βs, β1 is for n=1, β2 for n=2, etc. So perhaps I'm missing β0, but in reality, β0 is 1, so I can include it.

Wait, no. Wait, the stability constant β for the complex [Co(SCN)_n]^(2−n) is defined as:

βn = [ [Co(SCN)_n^(2−n)] ] / ( [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n )

So for each n, the concentration of the complex is given by βn multiplied by [Co^2+][SCN^-]^n.

But the problem is that [Co^2+] is part of the expression, which complicates things because the sum of all the complex concentrations plus [Co^2+] equals the total Co concentration.

Wait, perhaps I can express all the concentrations in terms of [Co^2+], and then solve for it.

Let me denote [Co^2+] as x. Then, the concentration of each complex would be:

[CoSCN]^+ = β1 * x * [SCN]^1 = 9 * x * 0.1

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = β2 * x * [SCN]^2 = 40 * x * (0.1)^2

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = β3 * x * [SCN]^3 = 63 * x * (0.1)^3

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- = β4 * x * [SCN]^4 = 16 * x * (0.1)^4

The free Co^2+ is x.

The total Co is the sum of all these, so:

x + (9 x * 0.1) + (40 x * 0.01) + (63 x * 0.001) + (16 x * 0.0001) = 1e-2

Factor out x:

x [1 + (9 * 0.1) + (40 * 0.01) + (63 * 0.001) + (16 * 0.0001) ] = 1e-2

Let me compute each term:

1 is 1.

9 * 0.1 = 0.9

40 * 0.01 = 0.4

63 * 0.001 = 0.063

16 * 0.0001 = 0.0016

Adding them up:

1 + 0.9 = 1.9

1.9 + 0.4 = 2.3

2.3 + 0.063 = 2.363

2.363 + 0.0016 = 2.3646

So the equation becomes:

x * 2.3646 = 1e-2 → x = (1e-2) / 2.3646 ≈ 4.225e-3 M.

Wait, so [Co^2+] is about 0.004225 M.

Now, to find the concentration of each complex:

[CoSCN]^+ = 9 * 0.004225 * 0.1 = 9 * 0.0004225 = 0.0038025 M

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 = 40 * 0.004225 * (0.1)^2 = 40 * 0.004225 * 0.01 = 40 * 0.00004225 = 0.00169 M

[Co(SCN)_3]^- = 63 * 0.004225 * (0.1)^3 = 63 * 0.004225 * 0.001 = 63 * 0.000004225 ≈ 0.000266 M

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- = 16 * 0.004225 * (0.1)^4 = 16 * 0.004225 * 0.0001 = 16 * 0.0000004225 ≈ 0.00000676 M

Let me check the sum:

x ≈ 0.004225

[CoSCN]^+ ≈ 0.0038025

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 ≈ 0.00169

[Co(SCN)_3]^- ≈ 0.000266

[Co(SCN)_4]^2- ≈ 0.00000676

Adding these:

0.004225 + 0.0038025 = 0.0080275

+ 0.00169 → 0.0097175

+ 0.000266 → 0.0099835

+ 0.00000676 → ~0.00999026

Which is approximately 0.01, which matches the total Co concentration. So that looks okay.

Now, the question is about the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato complex, which is [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Its concentration is 0.00169 M.

So the fraction is (0.00169) / (0.01) ) * 100% → 16.9%? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the total Co is 0.01 M, so each complex's concentration divided by 0.01 gives the mole fraction, which multiplied by 100 gives the percentage.

Wait, wait, no, because all the concentrations are already in terms of moles per liter, and the total Co is 0.01 M. So the percentage is ( [Co(SCN)_2]^0 / 0.01 ) * 100.

So [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 0.00169 M. So 0.00169 / 0.01 = 0.169 → 16.9%.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 16.9%. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check because the problem says "the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complexes." So dithiocyanato is two SCN- per Co, correct? So that's [Co(SCN)_2]^0. So yes, my calculation is correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because β3 is the largest, so [Co(SCN)_3]^- should be the most abundant, right? But according to the calculation, [Co(SCN)_2]^0 has a concentration of 0.00169 M, which is 16.9% of the total Co.

Wait, but in the sum, [Co^2+] is about 4.225e-3 M, which is 42.25% of the total Co. [CoSCN]^+ is about 38%, and [Co(SCN)_2]^0 is 16.9%, [Co(SCN)_3]^- is about 2.66%, and [Co(SCN)_4]^2− is 0.0676%. So the dominant species is [CoSCN]^+ (38%), then Co^2+ (42%), then [Co(SCN)_2]^0 (16.9%).

But wait, β3 is the largest, so why isn't [Co(SCN)_3]^- the most abundant? Because the [SCN^-] is only 0.1 M. So when [SCN^-] is low, even with a high β, the product [SCN^-]^n might not make the higher complexes dominant. For example, [Co(SCN)_3]^- has β3=63, but [SCN^-]^3 is (0.1)^3=0.001, so the product is 63 * x * 0.001. But for [CoSCN]^+, β1=9, and [SCN^-] is 0.1, so 9 * x * 0.1 = 0.9 x. So when x is 0.004225, 0.9 x is about 0.0038 M, which is larger than 40 x *0.01=0.00169 M for the [Co(SCN)_2]^0. Hmm, makes sense.

So the percentages are as follows:

[Co^2+] → 42.25%

[CoSCN]^+ → 38.025%

[Co(SCN)_2]^0 → 16.9%

[Co(SCN)_3]^- → 2.66%

[Co(SCN)_4]^2− → 0.0676%

So the blue complex is 16.9%, which is option D.


To determine the percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution, we use the stability constants (β) and the given concentrations of Co(II) and SCN⁻. The total cobalt concentration is 10⁻² M, and the SCN⁻ concentration is 0.1 M.

### Key Steps:
1. **Stability Constants and Complex Formation**:  
   The stability constants are given as β₁ = 9, β₂ = 40, β₃ = 63, and β₄ = 16. These correspond to the complexes [CoSCN]^+, [Co(SCN)_2]^0, [Co(SCN)_3]^-,[Co(SCN)_4]^2−. The fraction of each complex is determined by the formula:  
   \[
   f_n = \frac{\beta_n \cdot [\text{SCN}]^n}{\sum_{m=0}^4 \beta_m \cdot [\text{SCN}]^m}
   \]  
   where β₀ = 1 (representing the free Co²⁺ ion).

2. **Total Co Concentration**:  
   The total cobalt concentration is the sum of all species:  
   \[
   [\text{Co}]_{\text{total}} = [\text{Co}^{2+}] + [\text{CoSCN}^+] + [\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0] + [\text{Co(SCN)_3}^-] + [\text{Co(SCN)_4}^{2-}]
   \]  
   Using the stability constants and the given [SCN⁻] = 0.1 M, the fractions of all species are calculated, and their sum is normalized to the total cobalt concentration, 10⁻² M.

3. **Calculation of [Co²⁺]**:  
   Let [Co²⁺] = \(x\). The concentrations of the complexes are expressed in terms of \(x\) and [SCN⁻], and the total cobalt concentration is used to solve for \(x\):  
   \[
   x \cdot \left(1 + 9 \cdot 0.1 + 40 \cdot 0.01 + 63 \cdot 0.001 + 16 \cdot 0.0001\right) = 10^{-2}
   \]  
   Simplifying the terms inside the parentheses:  
   \[
   1 + 0.9 + 0.4 + 0.063 + 0.0016 = 2.3646
   \]  
   Solving for \(x\):  
   \[
   x = \frac{10^{-2}}{2.3646} \approx 4.225 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}
   \]

4. **Concentrations of Complexes**:  
   Using \(x = 4.225 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}\), the concentrations of the complexes are calculated as:  
   - [CoSCN]⁺ = \(9 \cdot x \cdot 0.1 = 0.0038025 \, \text{M}\)  
   - [Co(SCN)_2]⁰ = \(40 \cdot x \cdot (0.1)^2 = 0.00169 \, \text{M}\)  
   - [Co(SCN)_3]⁻ = \(63 \cdot x \cdot (0.1)^3 = 0.000266 \, \text{M}\)  
   - [Co(SCN)_4]²⁻ = \(16 \cdot x \cdot (0.1)^4 = 0.00000676 \, \text{M}\)

5. **Percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]⁰**:  
   The percentage of [Co(SCN)_2]⁰ is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \frac{[\text{Co(SCN)_2}^0]}{[\text{Co}]_{\text{total}}} \cdot 100 = \frac{0.00169}{0.01} \cdot 100 = 16.9\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The percentage of the blue dithiocyanato cobalt(II) complex, [Co(SCN)_2]⁰, among all cobalt-containing species in the solution is **16.9%**.
