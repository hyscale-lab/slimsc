Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin 1/2 particle in a magnetic field. Hmm, I remember that spin systems can be a bit tricky, but let's see if I can work through this.

The question says the particle has a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. Oh right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and Sz is the spin in the z-direction. So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. The particle's moment is aligned with this field. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. So both fields have the same strength, but they're along different axes.

Wait, when the field is along Z, the particle's spin is in the Sz state, right? So its energy levels are determined by the Zeeman effect. The energy E is proportional to Sz, so for spin 1/2, the states are +1/2 and -1/2 times ħ, but when multiplied by gamma and B, I suppose the energies become gamma*B*(±1/2).

But then the field is switched to Y. So the magnetic field is now along Y. So the Hamiltonian changes from something proportional to Sz to something proportional to Sy. Because the magnetic moment interacts with the field as μ·B. So the Hamiltonian after the switch is H = -μ·B, right? So that would be H = -gamma Sz B_z in the first case, but after switching, it's H = -gamma Sz B_y? Wait, no. Wait, the magnetic field is along Y, so B has components (0, B, 0). So the dot product mu · B would be (gamma Sz) * B_z + ... wait, no, mu is gamma Sz. So mu · B is gamma Sz * B_z, but when B is along Y, B_z is zero, and B_y is B. So actually, mu is in the z direction, so mu · B would be zero? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up. The magnetic moment mu is aligned along the spin direction, which is quantized when the field is along Z. But when the field is turned off and another is applied along Y, the spin is no longer quantized along Z; it can precess around Y. Oh wait, but the problem says that the field is turned off and another one is turned on, so now the particle is subject to a field along Y. So the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy instead of Sz.

Wait, let's think about how the Hamiltonian works. The energy is H = -μ·B. Since μ is gamma Sz (because initially aligned along Z), when B is along Y, μ · B would be gamma Sz * B_y. So H would be -gamma B Sz * (Y-component of B). Wait, no, because B is along Y, so B = (0, B, 0). So component-wise, B_y is B. So H = -gamma B Sz ? No, wait, mu is gamma Sz, so mu · B is gamma Sz * (B · direction). So if B is along Y, then mu · B is gamma Sz * (0, B, 0) · (0, 1, 0) ? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, mu is a vector. If the magnetic field is along Y, then the dot product is mu_y * B_y. So mu is gamma times the spin component, so mu_y would be gamma times S_y. Oh wait, no! Wait, mu is gamma S_z when the field is along Z because the spin is quantized along Z. But when the field is turned to Y, the spin will precess around Y. So the Hamiltonian will be proportional to S_y.

Wait, perhaps I should model the Hamiltonian correctly. When the field is along Y, the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin in Y direction. So H = -gamma B S_y. Because mu is gamma S_z in the initial condition, but I think that's only when the field is along Z. Oh wait, no, mu is generally gamma times the spin component along the direction of the field. So when the field is along Y, mu would align along Y. But in the problem statement, the initial mu is given as gamma S_z, which implies the initial field was along Z. So when the field is switched to Y, the magnetic moment is still mu = gamma S_z? Or does mu change direction because the field is along Y?

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's think again. The problem states that mu = gamma S_z initially because the field was along Z. Then, when the field is switched to Y, the spin is no longer quantized along Z; instead, it's quantized along Y. So the magnetic moment should align with the new field, which is along Y. So perhaps mu becomes gamma S_y? Or wait, the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma S_z regardless of the field direction. That can't be right because the magnetic moment usually aligns with the field. So maybe the initial condition is that mu is gamma S_z because the field was along Z, but when the field changes direction, the magnetic moment would now be in the direction of the field, which is Y. Wait, but the problem says that mu is equal to gamma S_z. So perhaps mu remains gamma S_z, and the field is along Y. Then the interaction is mu · B, which is (gamma S_z) · (B_y direction) = gamma S_z * (B in Y direction's component). But since S_z is along Z, and B is along Y, their dot product is zero. That can't be right. That would imply no energy, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let's think about the problem again.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment after the field changes. So initially, the spin is aligned along Z. The field is along Z, so the spin is in an eigenstate of Sz. Then, the field is turned off and a new field along Y is turned on. So the spin is now subject to a magnetic field along Y, which means the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy.

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem using the time-dependent perturbation theory. But wait, no, because the field is suddenly switched, so it's a sudden change, and perhaps the state doesn't change instantaneously. Hmm, maybe the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, and after the field change, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy. So the state becomes a superposition of Sy eigenstates, leading to oscillations.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a problem about precession. The spin will precess around the new magnetic field direction. The precession frequency is given by the Larmor frequency, which is gamma times the magnetic field strength. But wait, the Larmor frequency is when the magnetic moment is aligned with the field, but in this case, the field is along a different direction.

Wait, the problem says that when the field is turned off (so B=0) and another field along Y is turned on. So the initial state is a spin-up state in Z, |+z>. After the field is changed, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy. So the system evolves under this Hamiltonian.

The energy eigenstates of H would be the eigenstates of Sy. Since the particle is spin-1/2, the eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues ± ħ/2. The initial state is |+z>, which can be expressed as a superposition of |+y> and |-y>.

So the time evolution will cause the state to oscillate between these states, leading to oscillations in the expectation value of Sz.

The expectation value of Sz at time t is given by ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩. Let me compute this.

The initial state is |+z>. Let me express this in terms of |+y> and |-y>:

|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/√2.

Because the eigenstates of Sy are orthogonal and have eigenvalues ±1/2 ħ.

So when the Hamiltonian is H = -(gamma B) Sy, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ).

Substituting H, H = -(gamma B) Sy. So,

U(t) = exp( i (gamma B) Sy t / ħ )

The state at time t is |ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z> = U(t) (|+y> + |-y>)/√2.

But since Sy |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>, and Sy |-y> = -(ħ/2) |-y>, then U(t) acting on |+y> is exp( i (gamma B) (ħ/2) t / ħ ) |+y> = exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y> .

Similarly, U(t) acting on |-y> is exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y>.

So,

|ψ(t)> = [exp(i gamma B t/2) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |-y> ] /√2.

Now, to find the expectation value of Sz, we need to compute ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩.

Expressed in the |+y> and |-y> basis, Sz can be represented as a matrix. The Sz operator in the S_y basis is given by (since Sx, Sy, Sz don't commute), but perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value in the |+y> and |-y> basis.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express Sz in terms of the spin matrices. Since Sx, Sy, Sz are all proportional to the Pauli matrices, and we can express Sz as a matrix.

Alternatively, let's note that [Sy, Sz] = i ħ Sx. Hmm, maybe that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩ directly.

Let me express Sz as (ħ/2) times the Pauli z matrix: Sz = (ħ/2) σ_z.

So, let's compute the expectation value. Since |+y> and |-y> are eigenstates of Sy, and Sz is (ħ/2) σ_z.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to find the matrix elements of Sz in the |+y> and |-y> basis.

The |+y> state can be written as (|+z> + |-z>)/√2. Similarly, |-y> is (|+z> - |-z>)/√2.

So, let me compute the matrix elements of Sz in the |+y>, |-y> basis.

Sz |+y> = (ħ/2) σ_z (|+y>).

Express |+y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/√2.

So,

Sz |+y> = (ħ/2) [ (|+z> + |-z>)/√2 ].

But Sz |+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>, and Sz |-z> = -(ħ/2)|-z>.

So,

Sz |+y> = (ħ/2) [ (|+z> + (-1)|-z> ) /√2 ] = (ħ/2√2) (|+z> - |-z> ) = (ħ/2√2) ( (|+z> + |-z> ) - 2| -z> )? Wait, maybe I should compute it step by step.

Wait, Sz |+y> = (ħ/2) (|+z> - |-z> ) /√2.

Similarly, Sz |-y> = (ħ/2) (|+z> + |-z> ) /√2.

So, the matrix elements of Sz in the |+y>, |-y> basis are:

⟨+y| Sz |+y⟩ = (ħ/2) (⟨+z| + ⟨-z| ) (|+z> - |-z> ) /√2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the matrix elements using the basis vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps an easier approach is to calculate the expectation value of Sz in the state |ψ(t)⟩.

So the state |ψ(t)⟩ is [exp(iω t) |+y> + exp(-iω t) |-y> ] /√2, where ω = gamma B.

Wait, no, ω is gamma B times something? Wait, from earlier, the time evolution factor was exp( i gamma B t / 2 ), so the frequency we're seeing is (gamma B/2) times t.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed.

So, the state is |ψ(t)⟩ = [e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |-y> ] /√2.

Now, compute ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩.

But Sz is diagonal in the |+z>, |-z> basis. To compute this, perhaps I should express everything in that basis.

Alternatively, express the state |ψ(t)⟩ in the |+z>, |-z> basis.

We have:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/√2.

Similarly, |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/√2.

So substituting into |ψ(t)⟩:

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z>)/√2 + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z>)/√2 ] /√2.

Let me factor out 1/√2 from each term:

= [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z>) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z>)) ) ] / (2).

Grouping terms:

= [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |+z> + (e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |-z> ) ] / 2.

Now, using Euler's formula, e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ} = 2 cos θ, and e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} = 2i sin θ.

So,

= [ 2 cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + 2i sin( gamma B t/2 ) |-z> ) ] / 2.

Simplify:

= cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |-z>.

So, the state |ψ(t)⟩ is cos(ω t/2) |+z> + i sin(ω t/2) |-z>, where ω = gamma B.

Now, Sz when acting on |+z> gives (ħ/2)|+z>, and on |-z> gives -(ħ/2)|-z>.

Compute the expectation value ⟨Sz⟩:

⟨Sz⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩.

Compute each part:

⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩ = [ cos(theta)^* - i sin(theta)^* ] [ (ħ/2) cos(theta) |+z> + (ħ/2) (-i) sin(theta) |-z> ] * normalization?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute each term. Let's let theta = gamma B t/2.

So, the state is |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z>.

So, the conjugate is ⟨ψ(t)| = cos(theta) ⟨+z| - i sin(theta) ⟨-z|.

So,

⟨Sz⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩ = [cos(theta) ⟨+z| - i sin(theta) ⟨-z| ] Sz [cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z> ].

Now, Sz|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>, Sz|-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>.

So,

= cos(theta) ⟨+z| (ħ/2 |+z> ) + cos(theta) ⟨+z| (i * (-ħ/2) ) |-z> )

- i sin(theta) ⟨-z| (ħ/2 |+z> ) - i sin(theta) ⟨-z| (i * (-ħ/2 ) ) |-z> )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to multiply out the terms:

= cos(theta) [ (ħ/2) cos(theta) ⟨+z|+z⟩ ] + cos(theta) [ i (-ħ/2) sin(theta) ⟨+z| -z ⟩ ]

- i sin(theta) [ (ħ/2) cos(theta) ⟨-z| +z⟩ ] 

+ (-i sin(theta)) [ i (-ħ/2) sin(theta) ⟨-z| -z⟩ ]

Because Sz acts on the right vector.

Now, evaluate each term:

⟨+z|+z⟩ = 1, ⟨+z| -z⟩=0.

Similarly, ⟨-z| +z⟩=0, ⟨-z| -z⟩=1.

So,

= cos(theta) (ħ/2) cos(theta) * 1 + [ 0 terms ]

- i sin(theta) (ħ/2) cos(theta) * 0 

+ (-i sin(theta)) (i (-ħ/2) sin(theta)) * 1.

Simplify term by term:

Term 1: (ħ/2) cos^2(theta).

Term 4: (-i)(i)(-ħ/2) sin^2(theta) = ( (-i)(i) ) ( -ħ/2 sin^2(theta) ) → since (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1)=1. So term 4 is (1)(-ħ/2 sin^2(theta)) ?

Wait, let me compute term 4:

Term4 = (-i sin(theta)) * (i (-ħ/2) sin(theta)) * ⟨-z|-z⟩.

Which is (-i)(i) * (-ħ/2) sin^2(theta) * 1.

(-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So Term4 = (1) * (-ħ/2) sin^2(theta) → - (ħ/2) sin^2(theta).

Wait, but wait, let's recheck:

Term4 is ( (-i sin(theta)) ) * ( i (-ħ/2) sin(theta) ) ) * ⟨-z| -z⟩.

So,

(-i) * i = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

Multiply by (-ħ/2) sin(theta)^2.

So, the entire Term4 is 1 * (-ħ/2) sin^2(theta) )= (-ħ/2) sin^2(theta).

So putting all together:

⟨Sz⟩ = (ħ/2) cos^2(theta) - (ħ/2) sin^2(theta).

Factor out (ħ/2):

= (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ] = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta).

Because cos(2 theta) = cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta).

So, the expectation value of Sz is (ħ/2) cos(2 theta), where theta is (gamma B t/2).

So,

⟨Sz⟩ = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t ).

Wait, because 2 theta = 2*(gamma B t/2) ) = gamma B t.

So the time dependence is cos(gamma B t). So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average (z-component of the particle’s moment). Wait, the magnetic moment mu is gamma Sz, so ⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma ⟨Sz⟩.

So,

⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Wait, but ħ is Planck's constant over 2 pi, right? Wait, no, in the expression for spin, S is in units of ħ. For spin-1/2, S_z can be ± ħ/2.

Wait, but earlier, when I wrote Sz in terms of Pauli matrices, it was (ħ/2) sigma_z. So, the ⟨Sz⟩ I calculated is (ħ/2) cos(2 theta), which is (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Wait, but the question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the moment, which is mu_z. So,

mu_z = gamma S_z.

So,

⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma * ⟨Sz⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Wait, but wait, no! Because the calculation I did for ⟨Sz⟩ is in terms of ħ/2. But in the problem statement, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. So if S_z is in units of ħ, then mu would be gamma times that. So, perhaps the actual units are:

⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

But for the purpose of the oscillation frequency, the amplitude is gamma ħ/(2) times the cosine function.

However, the problem is about the frequency of oscillation. The cosine function is cos( gamma B t ), so the angular frequency is gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B divided by 2 pi, but when we talk about oscillation frequency in such contexts, it's often given as the angular frequency. But wait, the options are given as gamma B/2, gamma B, etc. So the angular frequency is gamma B.

But wait, in the expression above, the frequency inside the cosine is gamma B, so the period is 2pi/(gamma B), and the frequency is gamma B/(2pi). But in the problem statement, the question is about the oscillation frequency. But in quantum mechanics, when we talk about Rabi oscillations, the frequency is often the angular frequency, which is gamma B. So perhaps in this problem, the answer is gamma B.

Wait, but wait, in my calculation, the expectation value ⟨mu_z⟩ oscillates as cos(gamma B t). So the frequency is gamma B, so the correct answer would be option B) gamma * B.

But wait, looking at the options:

Option A: gamma*B/2

Option B: gamma*B

Option C: sqrt(2) gamma B

Option D: gamma*B/sqrt(2)

So according to my calculation, it's option B.

But wait, let me double-check. Let's go through the steps again.

1. Initial state: |+z>, aligned with B along Z.

2. Field switched to Y. So new Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y.

3. Express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>:

|+z> = 1/sqrt(2) (|+y> + |-y> )

4. Time evolution under H:

H = -gamma B S_y.

The energy eigenstates are |+y> and |-y> with energies E_+ = (-gamma B) (ħ/2) and E_- = (gamma B) (ħ/2).

Wait, no: H = -gamma B S_y.

Since S_y |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>.

So H |+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y>.

Similarly, H |-y> = gamma B (ħ/2) |-y>.

So time evolution of |+y> is exp(-i E_+ t / ħ ) |+y> = exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |+y>.

Similarly, for |-y> it's exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) |-y> = exp( -i (gamma B (ħ/2)) t / ħ ) |-y> )

Wait, E_- is positive? Let me compute E_+ and E_-.

E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2 )

E_- = gamma B (ħ/2 )

So for |+y>:

exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) = exp( i gamma B t/2 )

For |-y>:

exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) = exp( -i gamma B t/2 )

So the state at time t is:

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2)

Expressed in terms of |+z> and |-z>, as done earlier.

Then, the expectation value of Sz is (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

So the oscillation is at frequency gamma B.

So the average of mu_z = gamma S_z oscillates at the same frequency, since ⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma ⟨Sz⟩.

Thus, the frequency is gamma B, which is option B.

The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. The field is suddenly switched off and replaced with a field of the same magnitude $B$ along the $+Y$ direction. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate of $S_z$, corresponding to $|+z\rangle$. When the magnetic field is switched to the $+Y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\gamma B S_y$. This causes the spin to precess around the $Y$-axis.

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$. The initial state $|+z\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$:  
   $$|+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle).$$  
   Under the new Hamiltonian, the time evolution of the state is:  
   $$|\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(e^{i\gamma B t/2} |+y\rangle + e^{-i\gamma B t/2} |-y\rangle\right).$$

3. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The expectation value of $S_z$ is computed as:  
   $$\langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle.$$  
   Substituting the expressions for $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ in terms of $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$, and using the time evolution, the result simplifies to:  
   $$\langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).$$

4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation of $\langle S_z \rangle$ occurs at the angular frequency $\gamma B$. Since the magnetic moment is $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, the oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is also $\gamma B$.

5. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A ($\gamma B / 2$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is $\gamma B$, not $\gamma B / 2$.  
   - **Option B ($\gamma B$)**: Correct. The oscillation frequency matches $\gamma B$.  
   - **Option C ($\sqrt{2} \gamma B$)**: Incorrect. There is no factor of $\sqrt{2}$ in the frequency.  
   - **Option D ($\gamma B / \sqrt{2}$)**: Incorrect. The frequency is not reduced by $\sqrt{2}$.

### Final Answer:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is $\gamma B$.  
**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin 1/2 particle in a magnetic field. Hmm, I remember that spin systems can be a bit tricky, but let's see if I can work through this.

The question says the particle has a magnetic moment mu equal to gamma times Sz. Oh right, gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio, and Sz is the spin in the z-direction. So initially, the magnetic field is along +Z. The particle's moment is aligned with this field. Then, the field is turned off and another one is turned on along +Y, same magnitude B. So both fields have the same strength, but they're along different axes.

Wait, when the field is along Z, the particle's spin is in the Sz state, right? So its energy levels are determined by the Zeeman effect. The energy E is proportional to Sz, so for spin 1/2, the states are +1/2 and -1/2 times ħ, but when multiplied by gamma and B, I suppose the energies become gamma*B*(±1/2).

But then the field is switched to Y. So the magnetic field is now along Y. So the Hamiltonian changes from something proportional to Sz to something proportional to Sy. Because the magnetic moment interacts with the field as μ·B. So the Hamiltonian after the switch is H = -μ·B, right? So that would be H = -gamma Sz B_z in the first case, but after switching, it's H = -gamma Sz B_y? Wait, no. Wait, the magnetic field is along Y, so B has components (0, B, 0). So the dot product mu · B would be (gamma Sz) * B_z + ... wait, no, mu is gamma Sz. So mu · B is gamma Sz * B_z, but when B is along Y, B_z is zero, and B_y is B. So actually, mu is in the z direction, so mu · B would be zero? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up. The magnetic moment mu is aligned along the spin direction, which is quantized when the field is along Z. But when the field is turned off and another is applied along Y, the spin is no longer quantized along Z; it can precess around Y. Oh wait, but the problem says that the field is turned off and another one is turned on, so now the particle is subject to a field along Y. So the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy instead of Sz.

Wait, let's think about how the Hamiltonian works. The energy is H = -μ·B. Since μ is gamma Sz (because initially aligned along Z), when B is along Y, μ · B would be gamma Sz * B_y. So H would be -gamma B Sz * (Y-component of B). Wait, no, because B is along Y, so B = (0, B, 0). So component-wise, B_y is B. So H = -gamma B Sz ? No, wait, mu is gamma Sz, so mu · B is gamma Sz * (B · direction). So if B is along Y, then mu · B is gamma Sz * (0, B, 0) · (0, 1, 0) ? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, mu is a vector. If the magnetic field is along Y, then the dot product is mu_y * B_y. So mu is gamma times the spin component, so mu_y would be gamma times S_y. Oh wait, no! Wait, mu is gamma S_z when the field is along Z because the spin is quantized along Z. But when the field is turned to Y, the spin will precess around Y. So the Hamiltonian will be proportional to S_y.

Wait, perhaps I should model the Hamiltonian correctly. When the field is along Y, the magnetic moment is proportional to the spin in Y direction. So H = -gamma B S_y. Because mu is gamma S_z in the initial condition, but I think that's only when the field is along Z. Oh wait, no, mu is generally gamma times the spin component along the direction of the field. So when the field is along Y, mu would align along Y. But in the problem statement, the initial mu is given as gamma S_z, which implies the initial field was along Z. So when the field is switched to Y, the magnetic moment is still mu = gamma S_z? Or does mu change direction because the field is along Y?

Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let's think again. The problem states that mu = gamma S_z initially because the field was along Z. Then, when the field is switched to Y, the spin is no longer quantized along Z; instead, it's quantized along Y. So the magnetic moment should align with the new field, which is along Y. So perhaps mu becomes gamma S_y? Or wait, the magnetic moment is given as mu = gamma S_z regardless of the field direction. That can't be right because the magnetic moment usually aligns with the field. So maybe the initial condition is that mu is gamma S_z because the field was along Z, but when the field changes direction, the magnetic moment would now be in the direction of the field, which is Y. Wait, but the problem says that mu is equal to gamma S_z. So perhaps mu remains gamma S_z, and the field is along Y. Then the interaction is mu · B, which is (gamma S_z) · (B_y direction) = gamma S_z * (B in Y direction's component). But since S_z is along Z, and B is along Y, their dot product is zero. That can't be right. That would imply no energy, which contradicts the problem statement.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let's think about the problem again.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's magnetic moment after the field changes. So initially, the spin is aligned along Z. The field is along Z, so the spin is in an eigenstate of Sz. Then, the field is turned off and a new field along Y is turned on. So the spin is now subject to a magnetic field along Y, which means the Hamiltonian is proportional to Sy.

Wait, perhaps I should model the problem using the time-dependent perturbation theory. But wait, no, because the field is suddenly switched, so it's a sudden change, and perhaps the state doesn't change instantaneously. Hmm, maybe the initial state is an eigenstate of Sz, and after the field change, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to Sy. So the state becomes a superposition of Sy eigenstates, leading to oscillations.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a problem about precession. The spin will precess around the new magnetic field direction. The precession frequency is given by the Larmor frequency, which is gamma times the magnetic field strength. But wait, the Larmor frequency is when the magnetic moment is aligned with the field, but in this case, the field is along a different direction.

Wait, the problem says that when the field is turned off (so B=0) and another field along Y is turned on. So the initial state is a spin-up state in Z, |+z>. After the field is changed, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B Sy. So the system evolves under this Hamiltonian.

The energy eigenstates of H would be the eigenstates of Sy. Since the particle is spin-1/2, the eigenstates of Sy are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues ± ħ/2. The initial state is |+z>, which can be expressed as a superposition of |+y> and |-y>.

So the time evolution will cause the state to oscillate between these states, leading to oscillations in the expectation value of Sz.

The expectation value of Sz at time t is given by ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩. Let me compute this.

The initial state is |+z>. Let me express this in terms of |+y> and |-y>:

|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/√2.

Because the eigenstates of Sy are orthogonal and have eigenvalues ±1/2 ħ.

So when the Hamiltonian is H = -(gamma B) Sy, the time evolution operator is U(t) = exp(-i H t / ħ).

Substituting H, H = -(gamma B) Sy. So,

U(t) = exp( i (gamma B) Sy t / ħ )

The state at time t is |ψ(t)> = U(t) |+z> = U(t) (|+y> + |-y>)/√2.

But since Sy |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>, and Sy |-y> = -(ħ/2) |-y>, then U(t) acting on |+y> is exp( i (gamma B) (ħ/2) t / ħ ) |+y> = exp( i gamma B t / 2 ) |+y> .

Similarly, U(t) acting on |-y> is exp( -i gamma B t / 2 ) |-y>.

So,

|ψ(t)> = [exp(i gamma B t/2) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |-y> ] /√2.

Now, to find the expectation value of Sz, we need to compute ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩.

Expressed in the |+y> and |-y> basis, Sz can be represented as a matrix. The Sz operator in the S_y basis is given by (since Sx, Sy, Sz don't commute), but perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value in the |+y> and |-y> basis.

Alternatively, perhaps I should express Sz in terms of the spin matrices. Since Sx, Sy, Sz are all proportional to the Pauli matrices, and we can express Sz as a matrix.

Alternatively, let's note that [Sy, Sz] = i ħ Sx. Hmm, maybe that's more complicated.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩ directly.

Let me express Sz as (ħ/2) times the Pauli z matrix: Sz = (ħ/2) σ_z.

So, let's compute the expectation value. Since |+y> and |-y> are eigenstates of Sy, and Sz is (ħ/2) σ_z.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to find the matrix elements of Sz in the |+y> and |-y> basis.

The |+y> state can be written as (|+z> + |-z>)/√2. Similarly, |-y> is (|+z> - |-z>)/√2.

So, let me compute the matrix elements of Sz in the |+y>, |-y> basis.

Sz |+y> = (ħ/2) σ_z (|+y>).

Express |+y> in terms of |+z> and |-z>:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/√2.

So,

Sz |+y> = (ħ/2) [ (|+z> + |-z>)/√2 ].

But Sz |+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>, and Sz |-z> = -(ħ/2)|-z>.

So,

Sz |+y> = (ħ/2) [ (|+z> + (-1)|-z> ) /√2 ] = (ħ/2√2) (|+z> - |-z> ) = (ħ/2√2) ( (|+z> + |-z> ) - 2| -z> )? Wait, maybe I should compute it step by step.

Wait, Sz |+y> = (ħ/2) (|+z> - |-z> ) /√2.

Similarly, Sz |-y> = (ħ/2) (|+z> + |-z> ) /√2.

So, the matrix elements of Sz in the |+y>, |-y> basis are:

⟨+y| Sz |+y⟩ = (ħ/2) (⟨+z| + ⟨-z| ) (|+z> - |-z> ) /√2.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the matrix elements using the basis vectors.

Alternatively, perhaps an easier approach is to calculate the expectation value of Sz in the state |ψ(t)⟩.

So the state |ψ(t)⟩ is [exp(iω t) |+y> + exp(-iω t) |-y> ] /√2, where ω = gamma B.

Wait, no, ω is gamma B times something? Wait, from earlier, the time evolution factor was exp( i gamma B t / 2 ), so the frequency we're seeing is (gamma B/2) times t.

Hmm, perhaps I should proceed.

So, the state is |ψ(t)⟩ = [e^{i gamma B t/2} |+y> + e^{-i gamma B t/2} |-y> ] /√2.

Now, compute ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩.

But Sz is diagonal in the |+z>, |-z> basis. To compute this, perhaps I should express everything in that basis.

Alternatively, express the state |ψ(t)⟩ in the |+z>, |-z> basis.

We have:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z>)/√2.

Similarly, |-y> = (|+z> - |-z>)/√2.

So substituting into |ψ(t)⟩:

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z>)/√2 + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z>)/√2 ] /√2.

Let me factor out 1/√2 from each term:

= [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} (|+z> + |-z>) + e^{-i gamma B t/2} (|+z> - |-z>)) ) ] / (2).

Grouping terms:

= [ (e^{i gamma B t/2} + e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |+z> + (e^{i gamma B t/2} - e^{-i gamma B t/2}) |-z> ) ] / 2.

Now, using Euler's formula, e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ} = 2 cos θ, and e^{iθ} - e^{-iθ} = 2i sin θ.

So,

= [ 2 cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + 2i sin( gamma B t/2 ) |-z> ) ] / 2.

Simplify:

= cos(gamma B t/2) |+z> + i sin(gamma B t/2) |-z>.

So, the state |ψ(t)⟩ is cos(ω t/2) |+z> + i sin(ω t/2) |-z>, where ω = gamma B.

Now, Sz when acting on |+z> gives (ħ/2)|+z>, and on |-z> gives -(ħ/2)|-z>.

Compute the expectation value ⟨Sz⟩:

⟨Sz⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩.

Compute each part:

⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩ = [ cos(theta)^* - i sin(theta)^* ] [ (ħ/2) cos(theta) |+z> + (ħ/2) (-i) sin(theta) |-z> ] * normalization?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute each term. Let's let theta = gamma B t/2.

So, the state is |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z>.

So, the conjugate is ⟨ψ(t)| = cos(theta) ⟨+z| - i sin(theta) ⟨-z|.

So,

⟨Sz⟩ = ⟨ψ(t)| Sz |ψ(t)⟩ = [cos(theta) ⟨+z| - i sin(theta) ⟨-z| ] Sz [cos(theta) |+z> + i sin(theta) |-z> ].

Now, Sz|+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>, Sz|-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>.

So,

= cos(theta) ⟨+z| (ħ/2 |+z> ) + cos(theta) ⟨+z| (i * (-ħ/2) ) |-z> )

- i sin(theta) ⟨-z| (ħ/2 |+z> ) - i sin(theta) ⟨-z| (i * (-ħ/2 ) ) |-z> )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to multiply out the terms:

= cos(theta) [ (ħ/2) cos(theta) ⟨+z|+z⟩ ] + cos(theta) [ i (-ħ/2) sin(theta) ⟨+z| -z ⟩ ]

- i sin(theta) [ (ħ/2) cos(theta) ⟨-z| +z⟩ ] 

+ (-i sin(theta)) [ i (-ħ/2) sin(theta) ⟨-z| -z⟩ ]

Because Sz acts on the right vector.

Now, evaluate each term:

⟨+z|+z⟩ = 1, ⟨+z| -z⟩=0.

Similarly, ⟨-z| +z⟩=0, ⟨-z| -z⟩=1.

So,

= cos(theta) (ħ/2) cos(theta) * 1 + [ 0 terms ]

- i sin(theta) (ħ/2) cos(theta) * 0 

+ (-i sin(theta)) (i (-ħ/2) sin(theta)) * 1.

Simplify term by term:

Term 1: (ħ/2) cos^2(theta).

Term 4: (-i)(i)(-ħ/2) sin^2(theta) = ( (-i)(i) ) ( -ħ/2 sin^2(theta) ) → since (-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1)=1. So term 4 is (1)(-ħ/2 sin^2(theta)) ?

Wait, let me compute term 4:

Term4 = (-i sin(theta)) * (i (-ħ/2) sin(theta)) * ⟨-z|-z⟩.

Which is (-i)(i) * (-ħ/2) sin^2(theta) * 1.

(-i)(i) = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

So Term4 = (1) * (-ħ/2) sin^2(theta) → - (ħ/2) sin^2(theta).

Wait, but wait, let's recheck:

Term4 is ( (-i sin(theta)) ) * ( i (-ħ/2) sin(theta) ) ) * ⟨-z| -z⟩.

So,

(-i) * i = (-i^2) = -(-1) = 1.

Multiply by (-ħ/2) sin(theta)^2.

So, the entire Term4 is 1 * (-ħ/2) sin^2(theta) )= (-ħ/2) sin^2(theta).

So putting all together:

⟨Sz⟩ = (ħ/2) cos^2(theta) - (ħ/2) sin^2(theta).

Factor out (ħ/2):

= (ħ/2) [ cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ] = (ħ/2) cos(2 theta).

Because cos(2 theta) = cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta).

So, the expectation value of Sz is (ħ/2) cos(2 theta), where theta is (gamma B t/2).

So,

⟨Sz⟩ = (ħ/2) cos( gamma B t ).

Wait, because 2 theta = 2*(gamma B t/2) ) = gamma B t.

So the time dependence is cos(gamma B t). So the oscillation frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but the question is about the oscillation frequency of the average (z-component of the particle’s moment). Wait, the magnetic moment mu is gamma Sz, so ⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma ⟨Sz⟩.

So,

⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Wait, but ħ is Planck's constant over 2 pi, right? Wait, no, in the expression for spin, S is in units of ħ. For spin-1/2, S_z can be ± ħ/2.

Wait, but earlier, when I wrote Sz in terms of Pauli matrices, it was (ħ/2) sigma_z. So, the ⟨Sz⟩ I calculated is (ħ/2) cos(2 theta), which is (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Wait, but the question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average of the z-component of the moment, which is mu_z. So,

mu_z = gamma S_z.

So,

⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma * ⟨Sz⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

Wait, but wait, no! Because the calculation I did for ⟨Sz⟩ is in terms of ħ/2. But in the problem statement, the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. So if S_z is in units of ħ, then mu would be gamma times that. So, perhaps the actual units are:

⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma * (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

But for the purpose of the oscillation frequency, the amplitude is gamma ħ/(2) times the cosine function.

However, the problem is about the frequency of oscillation. The cosine function is cos( gamma B t ), so the angular frequency is gamma B. So the frequency is gamma B divided by 2 pi, but when we talk about oscillation frequency in such contexts, it's often given as the angular frequency. But wait, the options are given as gamma B/2, gamma B, etc. So the angular frequency is gamma B.

But wait, in the expression above, the frequency inside the cosine is gamma B, so the period is 2pi/(gamma B), and the frequency is gamma B/(2pi). But in the problem statement, the question is about the oscillation frequency. But in quantum mechanics, when we talk about Rabi oscillations, the frequency is often the angular frequency, which is gamma B. So perhaps in this problem, the answer is gamma B.

Wait, but wait, in my calculation, the expectation value ⟨mu_z⟩ oscillates as cos(gamma B t). So the frequency is gamma B, so the correct answer would be option B) gamma * B.

But wait, looking at the options:

Option A: gamma*B/2

Option B: gamma*B

Option C: sqrt(2) gamma B

Option D: gamma*B/sqrt(2)

So according to my calculation, it's option B.

But wait, let me double-check. Let's go through the steps again.

1. Initial state: |+z>, aligned with B along Z.

2. Field switched to Y. So new Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y.

3. Express |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>:

|+z> = 1/sqrt(2) (|+y> + |-y> )

4. Time evolution under H:

H = -gamma B S_y.

The energy eigenstates are |+y> and |-y> with energies E_+ = (-gamma B) (ħ/2) and E_- = (gamma B) (ħ/2).

Wait, no: H = -gamma B S_y.

Since S_y |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>.

So H |+y> = -gamma B (ħ/2) |+y>.

Similarly, H |-y> = gamma B (ħ/2) |-y>.

So time evolution of |+y> is exp(-i E_+ t / ħ ) |+y> = exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |+y>.

Similarly, for |-y> it's exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) |-y> = exp( -i (gamma B (ħ/2)) t / ħ ) |-y> )

Wait, E_- is positive? Let me compute E_+ and E_-.

E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2 )

E_- = gamma B (ħ/2 )

So for |+y>:

exp( -i E_+ t / ħ ) = exp( i gamma B t/2 )

For |-y>:

exp( -i E_- t / ħ ) = exp( -i gamma B t/2 )

So the state at time t is:

|ψ(t)⟩ = [ exp( i gamma B t/2 ) |+y> + exp( -i gamma B t/2 ) |-y> ] / sqrt(2)

Expressed in terms of |+z> and |-z>, as done earlier.

Then, the expectation value of Sz is (ħ/2) cos(gamma B t).

So the oscillation is at frequency gamma B.

So the average of mu_z = gamma S_z oscillates at the same frequency, since ⟨mu_z⟩ = gamma ⟨Sz⟩.

Thus, the frequency is gamma B, which is option B.


The problem involves a spin-1/2 particle with magnetic moment $\mu = \gamma S_z$, initially aligned with a magnetic field along the $+Z$ direction. The field is suddenly switched off and replaced with a field of the same magnitude $B$ along the $+Y$ direction. The task is to determine the oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, $\langle \mu_z \rangle$.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Initial State and Hamiltonian**:  
   Initially, the particle is in the eigenstate of $S_z$, corresponding to $|+z\rangle$. When the magnetic field is switched to the $+Y$ direction, the Hamiltonian becomes $H = -\gamma B S_y$. This causes the spin to precess around the $Y$-axis.

2. **Time Evolution**:  
   The eigenstates of $S_y$ are $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$, with eigenvalues $\pm \hbar/2$. The initial state $|+z\rangle$ can be expressed as a superposition of $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$:  
   $$|+z\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y\rangle + |-y\rangle).$$  
   Under the new Hamiltonian, the time evolution of the state is:  
   $$|\psi(t)\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left(e^{i\gamma B t/2} |+y\rangle + e^{-i\gamma B t/2} |-y\rangle\right).$$

3. **Expectation Value of $S_z$**:  
   The expectation value of $S_z$ is computed as:  
   $$\langle S_z \rangle = \langle \psi(t) | S_z | \psi(t) \rangle.$$  
   Substituting the expressions for $|+y\rangle$ and $|-y\rangle$ in terms of $|+z\rangle$ and $|-z\rangle$, and using the time evolution, the result simplifies to:  
   $$\langle S_z \rangle = \frac{\hbar}{2} \cos(\gamma B t).$$

4. **Oscillation Frequency**:  
   The oscillation of $\langle S_z \rangle$ occurs at the angular frequency $\gamma B$. Since the magnetic moment is $\mu_z = \gamma S_z$, the oscillation frequency of $\langle \mu_z \rangle$ is also $\gamma B$.

5. **Critical Evaluation of Options**:  
   - **Option A ($\gamma B / 2$)**: Incorrect. The oscillation frequency is $\gamma B$, not $\gamma B / 2$.  
   - **Option B ($\gamma B$)**: Correct. The oscillation frequency matches $\gamma B$.  
   - **Option C ($\sqrt{2} \gamma B$)**: Incorrect. There is no factor of $\sqrt{2}$ in the frequency.  
   - **Option D ($\gamma B / \sqrt{2}$)**: Incorrect. The frequency is not reduced by $\sqrt{2}$.

### Final Answer:
The oscillation frequency of the average $z$-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is $\gamma B$.  
**Answer: B**
