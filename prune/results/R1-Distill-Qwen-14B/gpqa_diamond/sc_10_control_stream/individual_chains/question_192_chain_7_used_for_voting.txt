Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. So, there's an uncharged spherical conductor with radius R, and inside it, there's a small cavity. The cavity is also spherical but has a radius r, which is smaller than R. The center of the cavity is a distance s away from the center of the conductor. Oh wait, and s is less than R because the cavity is inside, right?

Now, they placed a small positive charge +q somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both bigger than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor. The angle between l and s is theta.

I remember from my notes that when a charge is inside a cavity of a conductor, the conductor's charges redistribute. But wait, the conductor was initially uncharged. So, how does the charge distribute?

In the case of a conductor with a cavity, any excess charge resides on the outer surface. But wait, the conductor was uncharged. Oh, but when you put a charge inside the cavity, the conductor's electrons would be attracted to that charge, right? So the inner surface of the conductor would develop an induced charge. Let me think, the charge inside the cavity is positive, so the inner surface of the conductor (the part facing the cavity) would have an induced negative charge. And since the conductor is neutral overall, the outer surface must have a positive charge equal in magnitude to the charge inside the cavity.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the conductor is initially neutral. When you place a charge +q inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface would have an induced -q, and the outer surface would have +q. Because the total charge remains zero, the sum of the inner and outer charges must be zero. Oh wait, no, because the conductor's initial charge is zero. Adding +q inside the cavity would cause the inner surface to have -q, and the outer surface to have +q. That way, the total charge of the conductor remains zero (since -q + q = 0). Is that right? Or is the outer surface +q?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The conductor is uncharged. When you place +q inside the cavity, the conductor's inner surface must have an induced -q to cancel the field inside the conductor material. So the inner surface is -q. Then, since the conductor was neutral, the outer surface must have +q to balance the inner's -q. Because the total conductor's charge is zero, but the outer surface's +q is the excess charge. So the conductor's outer surface has +q, and the inner surface has -q.

Wait, no, wait. The conductor as a whole is neutral. So the net charge on the conductor is zero. So the induced charges on the inner surface (due to the charge inside the cavity) would be -q, and the outer surface would have +q. Because the conductor's inner and outer surface charges must sum to zero. Because the conductor itself is neutral. So that makes sense.

So, from the perspective of a point outside the conductor (like point P), the electric field would be due to the outer surface charge, which is +q. Because the inner charges are screened.

Wait, but how does the arrangement of the charge inside the cavity affect the outer field? The point P is outside, so the charge distribution on the outer surface should be considered.

In the case of a spherical conductor, the outer surface charge would distribute uniformly if the conductor is isolated. But here, the conductor is just a sphere with a cavity, and the charge is placed inside the cavity. So, would the outer surface charge be uniform?

Wait, no, because the point where the charge is placed inside the cavity is not at the center. Because the cavity is offset by distance s from the center of the conductor. So the charge is placed somewhere inside the cavity, which is not at the same center as the conductor.

Oh right, in the problem, the cavity is not at the center. The center of the cavity is a distance s from the center of the conductor. So the charge inside is not at the center of the conductor. Therefore, the induced charge on the inner surface of the conductor won't be uniform. It would be like a dipole or something, but wait, in conductors, induced charges arrange to cancel the internal field.

Wait, for a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside the conductor material (the bulk) is zero. So the charges inside the conductor (free charges) arrange themselves such that the sum of the electric fields from all charges cancel within the conductor.

So, placing a charge +q off-center inside the cavity would cause the inner surface of the conductor to have an induced charge. But because the conductor is a sphere, but the charge inside is off-center, the inner surface's induced charge would not be uniform. It would create a sort of dipole-like distribution.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think about the inner and outer surfaces. The inner surface must have a charge distribution that exactly cancels the field due to the charge +q inside the cavity. Since the conductor's interior (the part between the cavity and the outer surface) must have zero field.

Wait, perhaps the inner surface of the conductor would have a charge distribution that produces a field equal and opposite to the field from the +q charge. So the inner surface would have a charge that's not uniform. But the outer surface must have a uniform charge distribution because the conductor is a sphere. Because the outer surface is a sphere, any excess charge on it would distribute uniformly. Wait, is that right?

Wait, no. The outer surface of a spherical conductor holds charge uniformly regardless of the internal cavity's charge distribution. Because the outer surface is a sphere, any excess charge would distribute uniformly. Wait, but that's only if the conductor is a perfect sphere and the external fields are uniform or something. Hmm, maybe not. But I think the key point is that for a spherical conductor, the outer surface's charge distribution is uniform.

Wait, no, that's only if the conductor is isolated and the charge is placed symmetrically inside the cavity. But in this case, the charge inside is not at the center. So the inner surface would have a non-uniform distribution. But the outer surface, being a sphere, would the charge on it be uniform?

Wait, the conductor as a whole is neutral. The inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, and the charge inside the cavity is +q. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q. But the outer surface is a sphere, so its charge distribution is uniform. Because in a conductor, charges on the surface distribute to cancel any internal fields. So if the outer surface is symmetric, it would have a uniform charge distribution. So the outer surface has +q uniformly distributed.

Wait, but the charge inside the cavity is off-center. So the inner surface's induced charge is not uniform. But the outer surface, as a sphere, would distribute its charge +q uniformly, regardless of the inner configuration. So, from the outside, the field would be as if all the charge were at the center, because the outer surface is a sphere with uniform charge.

Wait, but in this problem, point P is outside the conductor, and the conductor's outer surface is a sphere. So the external field should be the same as if all the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere. Because for a spherical charge distribution, the external field behaves as if the charge were a point charge at the center. So the electric field at P should be (1/(4πε₀)) * (Q_enclosed)/r², where r is the distance from the center of the sphere.

Wait, but in this case, the conductor's outer surface has a charge of +q. So the total enclosed charge is +q. So the field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², where L is the distance from the center of the conductor to P.

But wait, the options don't all have L². Let me look at the options again.

Option B is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L². That seems to fit. But wait, another option is D, which is E = (1/(4πε₀)) * q / l².

Wait, wait a second. Because in the problem, the point P is at a distance l from the center of the cavity, not from the center of the conductor. Or wait, the problem says: the distance of point P from the center of the cavity is l. The center of the cavity is at a distance s from the center of the conductor. So the distance from the center of the conductor to P is L, which is sqrt( l² + s² - 2 l s cosθ ), via the law of cosines.

Wait, but when the conductor is a sphere, the external field depends only on the total enclosed charge and the distance from the center. So regardless of where the charge is inside the cavity (even if it's off-center), the outer surface charge is uniform, and the external field is the same as if the charge were at the center.

Wait, but in this problem, the point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, so the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) q / L². So that would make option B correct.

But wait, why are the other options there? Let me think again. Another approach is to consider Gauss's Law. The Gaussian surface is outside the conductor, so the enclosed charge is the total charge on the outer surface, which is +q. So the electric flux through the Gaussian surface would be E * 4π L² = q/(ε₀), so E = q/(4π ε₀ L²). So that's option B.

Wait, but why are there options with l and l^2? Like option D is 1/(4πε₀) q / l². But l is the distance from the center of the cavity to P, not from the conductor's center. So in that case, perhaps if the charge were at the center of the cavity, then the distance from the conductor center would be L = l - s cosθ? No, wait, because the center of the cavity is s away from the conductor's center. So the distance from the conductor's center is L, which is found by the law of cosines.

Wait, but if the charge is inside the cavity, and the cavity is not at the center, but the conductor's outer surface is uniform, then the electric field outside is as if the charge is at the center of the conductor. So regardless of where the charge is inside, the external field is as if all the charge is at the center of the conductor.

So the correct expression for the electric field at P would be option B, E = (1/(4π ε₀)) q / L².

Wait, but in the problem statement, the charge is inside the cavity but not at its center. Does that affect anything? Because the inner surface would have an induced charge, but the outer surface's charge would be uniform. So the external field depends only on the outer charge, which is +q, and the distance from the conductor's center.

So, yes, option B would be correct.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Setup and Induced Charges**:  
   The conductor is initially uncharged. When a small positive charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, the inner surface of the conductor develops an induced charge $-q$ to cancel the electric field within the conductor's material. The outer surface of the conductor, being a sphere, uniformly distributes a charge $+q$ to maintain the conductor's neutrality.

2. **Electric Field Outside the Conductor**:  
   For a spherical conductor, the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge enclosed within the conductor and the distance from the center of the conductor. The outer surface charge $+q$ is uniformly distributed, and the field outside the conductor is as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the conductor. This follows from the principle of superposition and the symmetry of the spherical charge distribution.

3. **Application of Gauss's Law**:  
   Using Gauss's Law, the electric field at a point $P$ outside the conductor is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2},
   \]
   where $L$ is the distance from the center of the conductor to the point $P$.

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: This expression is incorrect because it introduces an unnecessary dependence on $l$, $s$, and $\theta$, which are irrelevant for the external field.  
   - **Option B**: This matches the derived expression for the electric field outside the conductor and is consistent with the application of Gauss's Law.  
   - **Option C**: This is incorrect as it introduces an additive term involving $l$ and $s$, which does not align with the symmetry of the problem.  
   - **Option D**: This expression incorrectly uses $l$ (the distance from the center of the cavity to $P$) instead of $L$ (the distance from the center of the conductor to $P$).

Thus, the correct electric field at point $P$ is given by **Option B**.

Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and its distance from the center of the cavity is l. Also, l and L are both bigger than R, so P is definitely outside the conductor.
