Okay, so I've got this question about nuclear physics, specifically dealing with the Pauli exclusion principle and quantum numbers. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The problem says we have two nucleons (like a deuteron, maybe) in a 1S0 state, and they emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The question is about figuring out which partial wave isn't allowed based on the conservation laws and the given condition from Pauli statistics.

Wait, the condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Oh wait, no, the equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). But the final state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to use this condition along with conservation of angular momentum and parity.

Let me think about the initial state. The initial state is 1S0. The notation is (2S+1)L(J), so for 1S0: S=0, L=0 (since S is 0, and the state is S, so L is 0?), wait no. Wait, the spectroscopic notation is 2S+1 for the spin multiplicity, L is the orbital angular momentum in letters (S, P, D, F...), and J is the total angular momentum.

Wait, 1S0 would mean 2S+1 = 1, so S=0. Then L is S? Wait, no. Wait, the notation is (2S+1)L, so 1S0 would have S=0, L=S? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me get this straight. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so for 1S0: 2S+1 = 1 → S=0. Then L is S? No, L is given by the letter. S corresponds to L=0, P to L=1, D to L=2, F to L=3, etc. So in 1S0, S=0, L=0, and J=0. So the initial state has spin S=0, L=0, J=0.

Now, the NN system emits a particle X, so the final state is the NN pair and X. The problem states that the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So the isospin of the NN pair is zero.

The Pauli condition says T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, no, the equation is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh wait, the equation is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So let's compute that.

Given T=0, so 0 ≡ S + L + 1 mod 2. So, S + L must be 1 mod 2. That is, S + L is odd.

So in the final state, the NN pair has S and L such that S + L is odd. Also, angular momentum and parity must be conserved.

Wait, the initial state has total angular momentum J=0, and it's emitting a particle X. So the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the initial state is J=0, so the sum of the angular momenta of the final states (NN and X) must be J=0. Also, parity must be conserved.

Wait, the parity of the initial state is the parity of 1S0. The parity of a state is (-1)^(L + S_X), but wait, no. The parity of a two-body system (like the NN pair) is given by (-1)^(L), because their spins don't contribute to parity. Wait, no, the parity of a two-body state is (-1)^L. So the initial state is 1S0, which is L=0, so parity is (+1).

When the NN emits a particle X, the parity of the process must conserve overall parity. So the parity of the initial state is +1. The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN pair and the parity of X.

So, parity_initial = parity_NN_final * parity_X.

So parity_NN_final = [parity of NN state], and parity_X is given as -1.

Wait, the parity of the NN state after emission is determined by their orbital angular momentum. Let me figure this out. The parity of the NN pair in the final state will be (-1)^{L_final}, where L_final is their orbital angular momentum. So the parity_NN_final = (-1)^{L_final}.

And the parity of X is given as -1.

So, parity_initial = (+1) = parity_NN_final * parity_X → (+1) = (-1)^{L_final} * (-1).

Simplify that: (+1) = (-1)^{L_final + 1}.

Which implies that (-1)^{L_final + 1} = 1 → L_final +1 must be even → L_final is odd.

So L_final must be odd. So the orbital angular momentum of the NN pair in the final state must be an odd integer: 1,3,5... but since it's a partial wave, in the options we have L values as S (0), P (1), D (2), F (3), etc. So looking at the options, the options give the angular momentum state of X as p, s, etc., which are the letters for orbital angular momenta.

Wait, each option says something like 3P0 + p. Let me see: for each option, the first part is the NN state after emission, and the second is the particle X.

So the notation is initial state → NN state (after emission) + X.

So for each option, the NN state is something like 7D1, which is (2S +1) L (J). So 7D1 → 2S+1=7→ S=3, L from D=2, J=1.

But wait, the angular momentum of X is determined by the letter. For example, X is a p (P state, L=1), s (S state, L=0), etc.

So the total angular momentum of the system (NN and X) must be conserved, and the initial J is 0. So the sum of the angular momenta of the NN and X must be zero.

Wait, but angular momentum is a vector, so the magnitudes should add in a way that their vector sum is zero. That's only possible if each has zero angular momentum, but that's not possible here. Wait, no, if the initial state is J=0, then the final must have total J=0.

But since the initial state is J=0, the final state's total J (sum of NN's J and X's L) must also be 0. Wait, but orbital angular momentum of X is part of the total angular momentum.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the total angular momentum as the sum of the NN's angular momentum and X's angular momentum. So NN has some J1 and X has Lx (orbital angular momentum). Then total J = J1 + Lx. But since the initial J is 0, J1 + Lx must be 0. So their vector sum is zero. Which implies that J1 = -Lx. But since J and L are magnitudes, this is only possible if J1 and Lx are both zero. But that can't be right because X is emitted, so it must have some angular momentum.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think step by step.

The initial state has J_initial = 0. The final state is the NN pair plus X. The NN pair has some angular momentum, say J_NN, and X has some angular momentum, say L_X.

Wait, but angular momentum is conserved, so the total angular momentum J_initial = J_NN + L_X. But J_initial is 0, so J_NN + L_X must be zero. Since angular momentum is a vector, this would require that J_NN and L_X are opposite vectors and equal in magnitude. But that's only possible if both are zero, which isn't possible because X is emitted and must have some angular momentum.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The initial state's angular momentum is J_initial = 0. So in the final state, the sum of the NN's angular momentum and X's angular momentum must also be zero. But how? Because X is a particle with angular momentum, and the NN pair also has angular momentum. The only way their vector sum is zero is if they are opposite. But their magnitudes must add in a way that their vector sum is zero. So maybe J_NN = L_X, but opposite in direction. So their magnitudes could be the same, but direction opposite. But since we're dealing with quantum numbers, this implies that J_NN and L_X must have the same magnitude but opposite directions. So in terms of quantum numbers, J_NN must equal L_X, and the sum must be zero.

But this seems a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the initial state's total angular momentum is zero, so when X is emitted, the NN's angular momentum and X's angular momentum must have opposite directions and same magnitude. So the magnitudes are the same, but directions opposite, leading to their vector sum being zero.

Alternatively, perhaps each has angular momentum J, and they are opposite, so their sum can be zero. But in terms of quantum numbers, this would require that the individual angular momenta can combine to zero through vector addition. For example, J_NN could be l and X's L could be l, but with opposite directions, leading to a total J of zero.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the possible total angular momenta are determined by the combination of individual angular momenta. So if the NN has L1 and X has L2, their sum must be zero vectorially, which requires that L1 = L2 and they are opposite. But in terms of quantum numbers, that's not straightforward because angular momentum is quantized. So perhaps the total J of the system is zero, which would require that the sum of the individual angular momenta (NN's and X's) is zero. So the only way this can happen is if both have zero angular momentum, but that's not possible here because X is emitted.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the orbital angular momentum of X. Each option gives the angular momentum state of X. Let's see: for example, in option A, X is a p, which is P state, so L_X=1.

So each option gives the state of X as p (L=1), s (L=0), d (L=2), f (L=3), etc.

Now, the initial NN state has J=0. So the sum of the angular momenta of the NN (after emission) and X must be zero. Wait, no, that can't be right because the total must be zero. So the total angular momentum after emission is J_NN + L_X = J_initial = 0.

Wait, but J_NN is the total angular momentum of the NN pair, which includes their orbital angular momentum (L_NN) and their spin (S_NN). But earlier, from Pauli's condition, we have that S_NN + L_NN is odd because T=0.

Wait, maybe I should first figure out the possible values of S_NN and L_NN for the final NN state.

Given T=0, and the condition T = S + L +1 mod 2.

So 0 = (S + L) +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2 → S + L is odd.

So, possible pairs (S, L) where their sum is odd.

S can be 0 or 1 (since for two nucleons, each with spin 1/2, the total spin can be 0 or 1). Wait, wait, no. Each nucleon is a spin-½ particle, so possible S for two nucleons is 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). So S can be 0 or 1.

Similarly, orbital angular momentum L can be 0,1,2,... but the options give L as S (0), P (1), D (2), F (3), etc.

So, for each possible S and L:

If S=0, then L must be odd (since 0 + L must be odd → L is odd).

If S=1, then L must be even (since 1 + L is odd → L is even).

So, the possible (S, L) combinations for the final NN state are:

- S=0, L=1,3,5,...
- S=1, L=0,2,4,...

Now, considering each option's NN state:

Let me look at each option:

Option A: 7D1 + p

The NN state is 7D1. So 7 is 2S+1 → 2S+1=7 → S=3? Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 2S+1=7 ⇒ S=3. But wait, for two nucleons, each with spin ½, the maximum total spin S can be 1. So S=3 is impossible. So this option is invalid. But why is this as an option? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Wait, wait, no. Each nucleon is a spin-½ particle, so the total spin S can be 0 or 1. So any option where 2S+1 >3 would imply S>1, which is impossible. So options with 7D or 5S are impossible because S=3 is not allowed.

So looking at the options:

Option A: 7D1 → 2S+1=7 → S=3 → Impossible, so this option is not allowed because two nucleons can't have S=3.

Hmm, wait, but the problem says which partial wave is not permitted. So if an option's NN state has an impossible S, then that option is invalid.

Wait, but let's check all the options.

Option B: 3S1 + p → 2S+1=3 → S=1.

Option C:3D3 + f → 2S+1=3 → S=1.

Option D:3P0 + s → 2S+1=3 → S=1.

Option A:7D1 → 2S+1=7 → S=3 → impossible.

So if any option has S=3, it's invalid, so Option A is invalid.

Wait, but why is there such an option? Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me double-check.

The initial state is 1S0, which is (2S+1)=1 → S=0. So when they emit a particle, the NN pair's spin can only be 0 or 1. So any option with a higher spin is impossible.

Therefore, option A is not allowed. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Because the question is about which partial wave is not permitted, considering both angular momentum and parity.

Wait, but I think I might have approached this wrong. Because the initial state is 1S0, and the final state's NN has S=3, which is impossible, so option A is invalid. So the answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the NN state's spin is 3, but that's impossible, so the partial wave (which is the orbital angular momentum of X) would make the option invalid. So I think the correct answer is A.

But wait, let's also check parity. The initial parity is +1.

The final parity is parity_NN * parity_X.

Parity_NN is (-1)^L_NN.

Parity_X is given as -1.

So:

parity_initial = (+1) = (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)

Which simplifies to:

(+1) = (-1)^{L_NN + 1}

So, L_NN + 1 must be even → L_NN must be odd.

So L_NN must be odd.

So, for the NN state in the final state, L_NN must be odd.

Looking at each option's NN state:

Option A: 7D1 → L=2. Because D corresponds to L=2. So L_NN=2, which is even. So this violates the parity condition. So this option is not allowed.

Wait, but earlier I thought S=3 is impossible. Now, another violation here.

So, this option is invalid on two counts: S=3 is impossible, and L=2 is even, which would make the parity condition fail.

So, option A can't happen. So the correct answer is A.

To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the given conditions and the options systematically:

### Key Information and Conservation Laws:
1. **Initial State**: The NN system is in the 1S0 state.  
   - Term symbol notation: \( (2S+1)L(J) \).  
   - For 1S0: \( 2S+1 = 1 \implies S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \) (since \( S \) corresponds to \( L = 0 \)), and \( J = 0 \).  
   - Initial parity: \( (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \).

2. **Final State**: The NN system emits a particle \( X \) with intrinsic parity \( -1 \).  
   - The total angular momentum and parity must be conserved.  
   - The Pauli condition: \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \).  
   - Given \( T(NN) = 0 \), this implies \( S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), meaning \( S(NN) + L(NN) \) is odd.

3. **Parity Conservation**:  
   - Initial parity: \( +1 \).  
   - Final parity: \( \text{Parity}(NN) \times \text{Parity}(X) \).  
   - \( \text{Parity}(NN) = (-1)^{L(NN)} \), and \( \text{Parity}(X) = -1 \).  
   - Thus, \( (-1)^{L(NN)} \times (-1) = +1 \implies (-1)^{L(NN) + 1} = +1 \).  
   - This implies \( L(NN) + 1 \) is even, so \( L(NN) \) must be odd.

### Analysis of Each Option:
#### **Option A: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)**
- \( 7D1 \): \( 2S+1 = 7 \implies S = 3 \).  
  - This is impossible because two nucleons (spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) particles) cannot have a total spin \( S = 3 \).  
- \( L(NN) = 2 \) (since \( D \) corresponds to \( L = 2 \)), which is even.  
  - This violates the parity condition (\( L(NN) \) must be odd).  
- **Conclusion**: This option is invalid due to both spin and parity violations.

#### **Option B: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)**
- \( 3S1 \): \( 2S+1 = 3 \implies S = 1 \).  
  - This is valid since \( S = 1 \) is allowed for two nucleons.  
- \( L(NN) = 0 \) (since \( S \) corresponds to \( L = 0 \)), which is even.  
  - This violates the parity condition (\( L(NN) \) must be odd).  
- **Conclusion**: This option is invalid due to parity violation.

#### **Option C: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)**
- \( 3D3 \): \( 2S+1 = 3 \implies S = 1 \).  
  - This is valid since \( S = 1 \) is allowed for two nucleons.  
- \( L(NN) = 2 \) (since \( D \) corresponds to \( L = 2 \)), which is even.  
  - This violates the parity condition (\( L(NN) \) must be odd).  
- **Conclusion**: This option is invalid due to parity violation.

#### **Option D: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)**
- \( 3P0 \): \( 2S+1 = 3 \implies S = 1 \).  
  - This is valid since \( S = 1 \) is allowed for two nucleons.  
- \( L(NN) = 1 \) (since \( P \) corresponds to \( L = 1 \)), which is odd.  
  - This satisfies the parity condition.  
- **Conclusion**: This option is valid.

### Final Answer:
The only option that is invalid due to both spin and parity violations is **Option A**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this question about nuclear physics, specifically dealing with the Pauli exclusion principle and quantum numbers. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

The problem says we have two nucleons (like a deuteron, maybe) in a 1S0 state, and they emit a particle X, which has an intrinsic parity of -1. The question is about figuring out which partial wave isn't allowed based on the conservation laws and the given condition from Pauli statistics.

Wait, the condition given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). Oh wait, no, the equation given is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 (mod 2). But the final state has T(NN) = 0. So I need to use this condition along with conservation of angular momentum and parity.

Let me think about the initial state. The initial state is 1S0. The notation is (2S+1)L(J), so for 1S0: S=0, L=0 (since S is 0, and the state is S, so L is 0?), wait no. Wait, the spectroscopic notation is 2S+1 for the spin multiplicity, L is the orbital angular momentum in letters (S, P, D, F...), and J is the total angular momentum.

Wait, 1S0 would mean 2S+1 = 1, so S=0. Then L is S? Wait, no. Wait, the notation is (2S+1)L, so 1S0 would have S=0, L=S? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me get this straight. The term symbol is (2S+1)L(J), so for 1S0: 2S+1 = 1 → S=0. Then L is S? No, L is given by the letter. S corresponds to L=0, P to L=1, D to L=2, F to L=3, etc. So in 1S0, S=0, L=0, and J=0. So the initial state has spin S=0, L=0, J=0.

Now, the NN system emits a particle X, so the final state is the NN pair and X. The problem states that the final NN state has T(NN)=0. So the isospin of the NN pair is zero.

The Pauli condition says T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Wait, no, the equation is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. Oh wait, the equation is T = S + L +1 mod 2. So let's compute that.

Given T=0, so 0 ≡ S + L + 1 mod 2. So, S + L must be 1 mod 2. That is, S + L is odd.

So in the final state, the NN pair has S and L such that S + L is odd. Also, angular momentum and parity must be conserved.

Wait, the initial state has total angular momentum J=0, and it's emitting a particle X. So the total angular momentum must be conserved. So the initial state is J=0, so the sum of the angular momenta of the final states (NN and X) must be J=0. Also, parity must be conserved.

Wait, the parity of the initial state is the parity of 1S0. The parity of a state is (-1)^(L + S_X), but wait, no. The parity of a two-body system (like the NN pair) is given by (-1)^(L), because their spins don't contribute to parity. Wait, no, the parity of a two-body state is (-1)^L. So the initial state is 1S0, which is L=0, so parity is (+1).

When the NN emits a particle X, the parity of the process must conserve overall parity. So the parity of the initial state is +1. The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN pair and the parity of X.

So, parity_initial = parity_NN_final * parity_X.

So parity_NN_final = [parity of NN state], and parity_X is given as -1.

Wait, the parity of the NN state after emission is determined by their orbital angular momentum. Let me figure this out. The parity of the NN pair in the final state will be (-1)^{L_final}, where L_final is their orbital angular momentum. So the parity_NN_final = (-1)^{L_final}.

And the parity of X is given as -1.

So, parity_initial = (+1) = parity_NN_final * parity_X → (+1) = (-1)^{L_final} * (-1).

Simplify that: (+1) = (-1)^{L_final + 1}.

Which implies that (-1)^{L_final + 1} = 1 → L_final +1 must be even → L_final is odd.

So L_final must be odd. So the orbital angular momentum of the NN pair in the final state must be an odd integer: 1,3,5... but since it's a partial wave, in the options we have L values as S (0), P (1), D (2), F (3), etc. So looking at the options, the options give the angular momentum state of X as p, s, etc., which are the letters for orbital angular momenta.

Wait, each option says something like 3P0 + p. Let me see: for each option, the first part is the NN state after emission, and the second is the particle X.

So the notation is initial state → NN state (after emission) + X.

So for each option, the NN state is something like 7D1, which is (2S +1) L (J). So 7D1 → 2S+1=7→ S=3, L from D=2, J=1.

But wait, the angular momentum of X is determined by the letter. For example, X is a p (P state, L=1), s (S state, L=0), etc.

So the total angular momentum of the system (NN and X) must be conserved, and the initial J is 0. So the sum of the angular momenta of the NN and X must be zero.

Wait, but angular momentum is a vector, so the magnitudes should add in a way that their vector sum is zero. That's only possible if each has zero angular momentum, but that's not possible here. Wait, no, if the initial state is J=0, then the final must have total J=0.

But since the initial state is J=0, the final state's total J (sum of NN's J and X's L) must also be 0. Wait, but orbital angular momentum of X is part of the total angular momentum.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the total angular momentum as the sum of the NN's angular momentum and X's angular momentum. So NN has some J1 and X has Lx (orbital angular momentum). Then total J = J1 + Lx. But since the initial J is 0, J1 + Lx must be 0. So their vector sum is zero. Which implies that J1 = -Lx. But since J and L are magnitudes, this is only possible if J1 and Lx are both zero. But that can't be right because X is emitted, so it must have some angular momentum.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's think step by step.

The initial state has J_initial = 0. The final state is the NN pair plus X. The NN pair has some angular momentum, say J_NN, and X has some angular momentum, say L_X.

Wait, but angular momentum is conserved, so the total angular momentum J_initial = J_NN + L_X. But J_initial is 0, so J_NN + L_X must be zero. Since angular momentum is a vector, this would require that J_NN and L_X are opposite vectors and equal in magnitude. But that's only possible if both are zero, which isn't possible because X is emitted and must have some angular momentum.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The initial state's angular momentum is J_initial = 0. So in the final state, the sum of the NN's angular momentum and X's angular momentum must also be zero. But how? Because X is a particle with angular momentum, and the NN pair also has angular momentum. The only way their vector sum is zero is if they are opposite. But their magnitudes must add in a way that their vector sum is zero. So maybe J_NN = L_X, but opposite in direction. So their magnitudes could be the same, but direction opposite. But since we're dealing with quantum numbers, this implies that J_NN and L_X must have the same magnitude but opposite directions. So in terms of quantum numbers, J_NN must equal L_X, and the sum must be zero.

But this seems a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the initial state's total angular momentum is zero, so when X is emitted, the NN's angular momentum and X's angular momentum must have opposite directions and same magnitude. So the magnitudes are the same, but directions opposite, leading to their vector sum being zero.

Alternatively, perhaps each has angular momentum J, and they are opposite, so their sum can be zero. But in terms of quantum numbers, this would require that the individual angular momenta can combine to zero through vector addition. For example, J_NN could be l and X's L could be l, but with opposite directions, leading to a total J of zero.

Wait, but in quantum mechanics, the possible total angular momenta are determined by the combination of individual angular momenta. So if the NN has L1 and X has L2, their sum must be zero vectorially, which requires that L1 = L2 and they are opposite. But in terms of quantum numbers, that's not straightforward because angular momentum is quantized. So perhaps the total J of the system is zero, which would require that the sum of the individual angular momenta (NN's and X's) is zero. So the only way this can happen is if both have zero angular momentum, but that's not possible here because X is emitted.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try another approach. Let me consider the orbital angular momentum of X. Each option gives the angular momentum state of X. Let's see: for example, in option A, X is a p, which is P state, so L_X=1.

So each option gives the state of X as p (L=1), s (L=0), d (L=2), f (L=3), etc.

Now, the initial NN state has J=0. So the sum of the angular momenta of the NN (after emission) and X must be zero. Wait, no, that can't be right because the total must be zero. So the total angular momentum after emission is J_NN + L_X = J_initial = 0.

Wait, but J_NN is the total angular momentum of the NN pair, which includes their orbital angular momentum (L_NN) and their spin (S_NN). But earlier, from Pauli's condition, we have that S_NN + L_NN is odd because T=0.

Wait, maybe I should first figure out the possible values of S_NN and L_NN for the final NN state.

Given T=0, and the condition T = S + L +1 mod 2.

So 0 = (S + L) +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2 → S + L is odd.

So, possible pairs (S, L) where their sum is odd.

S can be 0 or 1 (since for two nucleons, each with spin 1/2, the total spin can be 0 or 1). Wait, wait, no. Each nucleon is a spin-½ particle, so possible S for two nucleons is 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). So S can be 0 or 1.

Similarly, orbital angular momentum L can be 0,1,2,... but the options give L as S (0), P (1), D (2), F (3), etc.

So, for each possible S and L:

If S=0, then L must be odd (since 0 + L must be odd → L is odd).

If S=1, then L must be even (since 1 + L is odd → L is even).

So, the possible (S, L) combinations for the final NN state are:

- S=0, L=1,3,5,...
- S=1, L=0,2,4,...

Now, considering each option's NN state:

Let me look at each option:

Option A: 7D1 + p

The NN state is 7D1. So 7 is 2S+1 → 2S+1=7 → S=3? Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 2S+1=7 ⇒ S=3. But wait, for two nucleons, each with spin ½, the maximum total spin S can be 1. So S=3 is impossible. So this option is invalid. But why is this as an option? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Wait, wait, no. Each nucleon is a spin-½ particle, so the total spin S can be 0 or 1. So any option where 2S+1 >3 would imply S>1, which is impossible. So options with 7D or 5S are impossible because S=3 is not allowed.

So looking at the options:

Option A: 7D1 → 2S+1=7 → S=3 → Impossible, so this option is not allowed because two nucleons can't have S=3.

Hmm, wait, but the problem says which partial wave is not permitted. So if an option's NN state has an impossible S, then that option is invalid.

Wait, but let's check all the options.

Option B: 3S1 + p → 2S+1=3 → S=1.

Option C:3D3 + f → 2S+1=3 → S=1.

Option D:3P0 + s → 2S+1=3 → S=1.

Option A:7D1 → 2S+1=7 → S=3 → impossible.

So if any option has S=3, it's invalid, so Option A is invalid.

Wait, but why is there such an option? Maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me double-check.

The initial state is 1S0, which is (2S+1)=1 → S=0. So when they emit a particle, the NN pair's spin can only be 0 or 1. So any option with a higher spin is impossible.

Therefore, option A is not allowed. So the answer would be option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not missing something. Because the question is about which partial wave is not permitted, considering both angular momentum and parity.

Wait, but I think I might have approached this wrong. Because the initial state is 1S0, and the final state's NN has S=3, which is impossible, so option A is invalid. So the answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the NN state's spin is 3, but that's impossible, so the partial wave (which is the orbital angular momentum of X) would make the option invalid. So I think the correct answer is A.

But wait, let's also check parity. The initial parity is +1.

The final parity is parity_NN * parity_X.

Parity_NN is (-1)^L_NN.

Parity_X is given as -1.

So:

parity_initial = (+1) = (-1)^{L_NN} * (-1)

Which simplifies to:

(+1) = (-1)^{L_NN + 1}

So, L_NN + 1 must be even → L_NN must be odd.

So L_NN must be odd.

So, for the NN state in the final state, L_NN must be odd.

Looking at each option's NN state:

Option A: 7D1 → L=2. Because D corresponds to L=2. So L_NN=2, which is even. So this violates the parity condition. So this option is not allowed.

Wait, but earlier I thought S=3 is impossible. Now, another violation here.

So, this option is invalid on two counts: S=3 is impossible, and L=2 is even, which would make the parity condition fail.

So, option A can't happen. So the correct answer is A.


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the given conditions and the options systematically:

### Key Information and Conservation Laws:
1. **Initial State**: The NN system is in the 1S0 state.  
   - Term symbol notation: \( (2S+1)L(J) \).  
   - For 1S0: \( 2S+1 = 1 \implies S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \) (since \( S \) corresponds to \( L = 0 \)), and \( J = 0 \).  
   - Initial parity: \( (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \).

2. **Final State**: The NN system emits a particle \( X \) with intrinsic parity \( -1 \).  
   - The total angular momentum and parity must be conserved.  
   - The Pauli condition: \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \).  
   - Given \( T(NN) = 0 \), this implies \( S(NN) + L(NN) = 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \), meaning \( S(NN) + L(NN) \) is odd.

3. **Parity Conservation**:  
   - Initial parity: \( +1 \).  
   - Final parity: \( \text{Parity}(NN) \times \text{Parity}(X) \).  
   - \( \text{Parity}(NN) = (-1)^{L(NN)} \), and \( \text{Parity}(X) = -1 \).  
   - Thus, \( (-1)^{L(NN)} \times (-1) = +1 \implies (-1)^{L(NN) + 1} = +1 \).  
   - This implies \( L(NN) + 1 \) is even, so \( L(NN) \) must be odd.

### Analysis of Each Option:
#### **Option A: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)**
- \( 7D1 \): \( 2S+1 = 7 \implies S = 3 \).  
  - This is impossible because two nucleons (spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) particles) cannot have a total spin \( S = 3 \).  
- \( L(NN) = 2 \) (since \( D \) corresponds to \( L = 2 \)), which is even.  
  - This violates the parity condition (\( L(NN) \) must be odd).  
- **Conclusion**: This option is invalid due to both spin and parity violations.

#### **Option B: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)**
- \( 3S1 \): \( 2S+1 = 3 \implies S = 1 \).  
  - This is valid since \( S = 1 \) is allowed for two nucleons.  
- \( L(NN) = 0 \) (since \( S \) corresponds to \( L = 0 \)), which is even.  
  - This violates the parity condition (\( L(NN) \) must be odd).  
- **Conclusion**: This option is invalid due to parity violation.

#### **Option C: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)**
- \( 3D3 \): \( 2S+1 = 3 \implies S = 1 \).  
  - This is valid since \( S = 1 \) is allowed for two nucleons.  
- \( L(NN) = 2 \) (since \( D \) corresponds to \( L = 2 \)), which is even.  
  - This violates the parity condition (\( L(NN) \) must be odd).  
- **Conclusion**: This option is invalid due to parity violation.

#### **Option D: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)**
- \( 3P0 \): \( 2S+1 = 3 \implies S = 1 \).  
  - This is valid since \( S = 1 \) is allowed for two nucleons.  
- \( L(NN) = 1 \) (since \( P \) corresponds to \( L = 1 \)), which is odd.  
  - This satisfies the parity condition.  
- **Conclusion**: This option is valid.

### Final Answer:
The only option that is invalid due to both spin and parity violations is **Option A**.
