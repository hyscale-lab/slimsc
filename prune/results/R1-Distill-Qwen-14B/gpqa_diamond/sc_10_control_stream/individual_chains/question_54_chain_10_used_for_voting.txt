Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, it's about ring-closing metathesis, which I remember is a reaction where alkenes undergo a redistribution of their substituents. The goal is to find the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene.

Wait, ring-closing metathesis typically forms a ring by connecting two ends of an olefin. So the product is a cycloalkene, which in this case is a cyclohexene. The product structure is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. Let me draw that structure to visualize it better.

So the cyclohexene ring has substituents at positions 3,4, and 5. Position 3 and 4 have methyl groups, and position 5 has an isopropyl group. The double bond is between positions 1 and 2 because it's cyclohex-1-ene.

Now, the starting material must have two alkenes that can undergo metathesis to form this ring. Ring-closing usually requires an alkene at each end, and the two ends will connect to form the ring. So the starting material should be a diene with the appropriate substituents and the right positions for the metathesis.

Looking at the options, all are octadienes, which makes sense because octa means eight carbons, and a diene is two double bonds. Wait, no, octadiene means two double bonds in an eight-carbon chain. Or wait, no, maybe not. Wait, no. Wait, in the options, each is an octa with two double bonds.

Wait, no, actually, each option is an octadiene with one double bond? No, wait, the options are like octa-x-diene, which is a single diene (two double bonds in a row?), or maybe each is a diene with two separate double bonds? Hmm, wait, no, the numbering might imply the positions of the double bonds.

Wait, so for ring-closing metathesis, the starting material is typically a diene (two separate double bonds?) or a dienyne? No, wait, more commonly, it's a diene with two alkenes on either end. But I might be getting confused.

Wait, ring-closing metathesis usually uses a diene, but more accurately, a diene with two terminal alkenes. So the starting material would be a molecule with two alkenes that, when they undergo metathesis, connect to form a ring.

So the product is a cyclohexene. So the ring has six members. That means the starting material's diene must be such that when the two alkenes undergo metathesis, the ends connect to form a six-membered ring.

Wait, the starting material is an octadiene, which is eight carbons. Hmm, wait, because if you have an eight-carbon diene and you form a six-membered ring, that would leave two carbons in the middle as substituents.

Wait, perhaps let me think in terms of the number of atoms. Let's count the number of carbons in the product. The product is cyclohexene with substituents. The substituents are at positions 3,4,5.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about how the starting material would look. Let's say the starting material is a diene with a chain that will form the cyclohexene ring. So the two ends of the diene will connect to form the ring. So the distance between the two double bonds should be such that when they close, they form a six-membered ring.

Wait, the starting material is an octadiene. So let's imagine that the starting material is a molecule where the two double bonds are at positions 1 and 7 (so octa-1,7-diene), or maybe 2 and 6, etc.

Wait, let me think about the structure of the product and how the starting material would form it.

The product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So, in the ring, position 5 is isopropyl, and positions 3 and 4 have methyl groups.

In the starting material, these substituents should be located at positions that, when the ring closes, end up in the correct positions.

So for ring-closing metathesis, the substituents on the double bonds will end up adjacent to each other in the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene where each double bond has substituents that will become the substituents on the ring.

Wait, let me model this. Let's say the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene (Option A). So, the molecule has double bonds at 1 and 7 (so between C1-C2 and C7-C8). The substituents are at C3, C4 (methyl), and C5 (isopropyl).

When the metathesis occurs, the two double bonds will swap partners. So the double bonds would break and reconnect, forming a ring.

Wait, but wait. In ring-closing metathesis, the reaction typically involves a metal catalyst, like Grubbs, which facilitates the breaking and reforming of the double bonds. The mechanism is such that the two alkenes undergo a redistribution of substituents, and the ends connect.

So, for a molecule with double bonds at positions 1 and 7, when they undergo metathesis, the ends (positions 1 and 7) would connect, forming a ring. How many members would that ring have?

The chain between the two double bonds is from C2 to C6 (since 1 and 7 are the ends). That's 6 carbons in between? Wait, from C1 to C7, the chain is 8 carbons, but the double bonds are at 1 and 7. So when they undergo metathesis, the connecting would involve bringing the ends together.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the positions. Let's number the carbons in the starting material.

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, no. Wait, octa-1,7-diene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, wait, octa-1,7-diene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, octa is eight carbons. So octa-1,7-diene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, but that's only two double bonds? No, wait, no. If it's 1,7-diene, that would imply two double bonds? No, wait, no. Diene means two double bonds? Or is it monoene?

No, wait, all the options are dienes. Because they have two double bonds. Wait, no, no. Diene is two double bonds? No, wait, diene is two double bonds? No, wait, diene is a molecule with two double bonds, but in this case, each option is an octadiene, which is a single diene (two double bonds in a row?), or maybe a single double bond between two substituents.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to imagine the starting material.

Option B is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene. So the double bonds are between C2-C3 and C6-C7.

Wait, let me try to imagine how the ring would form.

In ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes exchange substituents and form a new ring. So, the two alkenes are on opposite ends of the chain, or perhaps in positions that allow the formation of the ring.

Assuming that the starting material is a diene (two alkenes) arranged so that the ring can form when the alkenes undergo metathesis.

So, if the product has cyclohexene, the starting material must have a chain that when the two ends are connected, forms a six-membered ring.

Wait, so the starting material is an eight-carbon diene. When it undergoes ring-closing metathesis, the two double bonds will be positioned such that when they close, the ring has six members.

Wait, perhaps the distance between the two double bonds should be four carbons apart, because when they close, the number of ring members would be 4 (from the chain) + 2 (from each double bond) = 6.

Wait, not exactly. Let me think: the number of atoms in the ring is determined by how the chain is connected. For a six-membered ring, the chain between the two double bonds should be four carbons. Because each double bond has two carbons, and the four in between make a total of six.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's think about the product. The product is cyclohexene with substituents at 3,4,5.

So, to form that, the starting material must have substituents that, when the ring forms, end up in positions 3,4,5.

Let me think about substituting numbers. Let's imagine the starting material is a straight chain with substituents at certain positions. When the ends connect, those substituents end up in the positions dictated by the ring structure.

So, the starting material would have substituents at positions that, when the ring is formed, they end up in the correct positions.

Let me take the product structure and count the positions. Product is cyclohexene:

Positions 1 (double bond start) → 2 → 3 (methyl) → 4 (methyl) →5 (isopropyl) →6 →1.

Wait, no, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So the numbering goes 1,2,3,4,5,6. The substituents are at 3,4,5.

So, when the starting material is a straight chain, the substituents would be in a way that when the ends are connected, they're at 3,4,5.

Wait, perhaps in the starting material, the substituents are on carbons that, when the ring is formed, become positions 3,4,5.

Wait, maybe the starting material has substituents on carbons that are at positions that, when the ends of the chain are connected, their positions wrap around to become 3,4,5.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that, when the chain is folded to form the ring, the substituents end up at the correct positions.

Let me try with option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? Wait, no, octa is eight carbons. So the structure would be: CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. Wait, but that's nine carbons. Wait, no, octa is eight, so the double bonds would be at 1 and 7, but for eight carbons, the positions would be from 1-8. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? Wait, no, that's nine carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, an eight-carbon chain with double bonds at positions 1 and 7. So:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? But that can't be right since octa would be 8 carbons, so the double bonds would be at 1 and 7. Wait, octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 7-8. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. But wait, that's actually 1,7-diene in an eight-carbon chain.

Wait, but that's a single diene? No, diene is two double bonds. Oh wait, no. Wait, diene is a molecule with two double bonds. Each diene in the options has two double bonds.

Wait, perhaps each option is a monoene with two double bonds. No, that's not possible. Wait, each option is an octadiene, which is a diene with two double bonds. So the starting material has two double bonds, and upon metathesis, the ends connect to form the ring.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the positions of the substituents. The product has substituents at 3,4,5. So in the starting material, those substituents would be in positions that, when the ring forms, their positions become 3,4,5.

Perhaps the substituents in the starting material are positioned such that when the ends of the chain are joined to form the ring, their positions shift accordingly.

Wait, let's imagine the starting material as a diene with substituents in the middle. So when the metathesis happens, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's substituents are at positions that, when the ring closes, they end up at positions 3,4,5.

Let me think: After the ring closes, the substituents are in the positions corresponding to the product. So, their positions in the starting material would be such that when the ring forms, their positions wrap around.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in the middle of the chain. For example, if the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene, then when the ring closes (from 1 to 8, but wait, octa is 8 carbons; 1 and 7 would be the ends), the substituents would be in positions that, after ring formation, are in positions 3,4,5.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to count the number of carbons between substituents.

The product has substituents at 3,4,5. So in the starting material, which is a straight chain, these substituents would be at positions that, when the ring closes, they end up at 3,4,5.

Assuming the starting material is an octadiene, when it undergoes ring-closing metathesis, the two ends (the double bonds) will connect, forming a ring. The number of carbons in the ring would be the number of carbons between the two double bonds plus the two from each double bond.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has double bonds at positions 1 and 5, so that when it closes, it forms a six-membered ring. Because 1 and 5 would be separated by three carbons, plus the two from the double bonds, making 5? No, wait. Let me think: if the starting material is an eight-carbon diene with double bonds at 1 and 6, then when they close, the ring would have 6 members (because 8 carbons minus 2 for the double bonds gives 6). Wait, perhaps that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diene with double bonds at positions 1 and 6. So, CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. Wait, no, octa is eight carbons, so for 1,6-diene, that would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with another double bond at 6? Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Another approach: the product is a six-membered ring with substituents at 3,4,5. So in the starting material, the substituents are at positions that are three, four, and five carbons away from the ends that will form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's substituents are in the middle of the chain, which will end up as positions 3,4,5 in the ring.

Let me think about the substituent positions in each option.

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

In this structure, substituents are at C3 (methyl), C4 (methyl), and C5 (isopropyl). The double bonds are at 1 and 7.

When the metathesis occurs, the two double bonds (at 1 and 7) will exchange partners, leading to the formation of a ring. The two ends (C1 and C7) will connect. So, the chain between C1 and C7 is C2, C3, C4, C5, C6. So that's five carbons between the two ends. When they connect, the ring would have 5+2=7 members? That can't be right because the product is a six-membered ring.

Hmm, that doesn't add up. The product is cyclohexene, which is six-membered. So perhaps the starting material should have a chain that, when connected, forms six members. So the distance between the two double bonds must be four carbons. Because 4 (between) + 2 (from each double bond) = 6.

So the starting material's double bonds should be positioned such that there are four carbons between them.

Wait, an eight-carbon chain with double bonds at positions 1 and 5. Because 1 and 5 would have three carbons in between (2,3,4), which would make four when counting including the double bond positions.

Wait, no, positions 1 and 5 would be separated by four carbons (positions 2,3,4,5). Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has double bonds at positions 2 and 6, which would give a four-carbon chain between them. Let's see: positions 2 and 6, so the chain between them is 3,4,5 – that's three carbons. Plus the two double bonds, making a total of five, not six. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct starting material has double bonds at positions 1 and 5 in an eight-carbon chain. So, the chain between 1 and 5 is 4 carbons (positions 2,3,4,5). So when the metathesis occurs, the ring formed would have 4 + 2 = 6 members. That makes sense because 4 between plus 2 from each end makes 6.

So the starting material should have double bonds at 1 and 5, but looking at the options, none of them have 1,5-diene. The options are 1,7; 2,6; 1,6; and 1,7 in another option.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: octa-1,7-diene → doubles at 1 and 7 → distance between is 5 carbons (positions 2,3,4,5,6,7?) Wait, no, 1 and 7 in octa would have 5 carbons in between (since 7-1=6, but the number of carbons between is 5). That would make the ring have 5+2=7, which is not the case.

Option B: octa-2,6-diene → doubles at 2 and 6 → the chain between them is 3,4,5 → 3 carbons between. So total ring size would be 3 + 2 = 5, which is less than six.

Hmm, that's not matching.

Option C: octa-1,6-diene → doubles at 1 and 6 → the chain between them is 2,3,4,5 → 4 carbons. So 4 + 2 = 6. That fits.

So option C would form a six-membered ring when the double bonds undergo metathesis.

Now, the substituents in the starting material should end up in the correct positions in the product.

So, the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene (Option C). Let's see:

The structure would be:

1: CH2=CH-

2: CH2-

3: CH(CH3)-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: CH(CH2CH(CH2)) [Wait, no, wait, 5 is isopropyl. So substituent at 5 is isopropyl.

Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)) – but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the substituents in the starting material (option C) are at positions 3,4,5. When the metathesis occurs, the ends (positions 1 and 6) will connect, forming a ring.

So, the substituent at position 5 (isopropyl) would be in the middle of the chain, which when the ring forms, it would end up at position 5 in the product. Similarly, the substituents at 3 and 4 would end up at 3 and 4 in the product.

Wait, but in the product, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5, which would correspond to substituents in the starting material at positions 3,4,5. So when the ring forms, those substituents are on the same positions in the ring.

So, when the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene (option C), upon metathesis, the ring would form between positions 1 and 6, making a six-membered ring. The substituents at 3,4,5 would be placed correctly in the ring.

Therefore, the correct starting material is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, we analyze the structure of the product and the options provided. The product is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). In ring-closing metathesis, the starting material must be a diene (a molecule with two double bonds) where the two alkenes are positioned such that their reconnection forms the six-membered ring.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Structure**: The product has six carbons in the ring, with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5. This indicates that the starting material must have substituents at positions that will align correctly when the ring forms.

2. **Ring Formation**: For a six-membered ring to form, the two double bonds in the starting material must be separated by four carbons. This ensures that the total number of carbons in the ring (including the carbons from the double bonds) sums to six.

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene)**: The double bonds are at positions 1 and 7, leaving five carbons between them. This would form a seven-membered ring, which does not match the product.
   - **Option B (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene)**: The double bonds are at positions 2 and 6, leaving three carbons between them. This would form a five-membered ring, which does not match the product.
   - **Option C (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene)**: The double bonds are at positions 1 and 6, leaving four carbons between them. This forms a six-membered ring, matching the product. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the starting material align correctly in the product.
   - **Option D (4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene)**: The substituents are misplaced, and the double bonds at positions 1 and 7 would form a seven-membered ring, which does not match the product.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene** (Option C), as it has the appropriate substituents and double bond positions to form the desired six-membered ring via ring-closing metathesis.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Hmm, it's about ring-closing metathesis, which I remember is a reaction where alkenes undergo a redistribution of their substituents. The goal is to find the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene.

So the cyclohexene ring has substituents at positions 3,4, and 5. Position 3 and 4 have methyl groups, and position 5 has an isopropyl group. The double bond is between positions 1 and 2 because it's cyclohex-1-ene.

Wait, no, actually, each option is an octadiene with one double bond? No, wait, the options are like octa-x-diene, which is a single diene (two double bonds in a row?), or maybe each is a diene with two separate double bonds? Hmm, wait, no, the numbering might imply the positions of the double bonds.

Wait, let me model this. Let's say the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene (Option A). So, the molecule has double bonds at 1 and 7 (so between C1-C2 and C7-C8). The substituents are at C3, C4 (methyl), and C5 (isopropyl).

The chain between the two double bonds is from C2 to C6 (since 1 and 7 are the ends). That's 6 carbons in between? Wait, from C1 to C7, the chain is 8 carbons, but the double bonds are at 1 and 7. So when they undergo metathesis, the connecting would involve bringing the ends together.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the positions. Let's number the carbons in the starting material.

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2.

Wait, no. Wait, octa-1,7-diene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? No, wait, octa-1,7-diene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, wait, octa is eight carbons. So octa-1,7-diene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2. Wait, but that's only two double bonds? No, wait, no. If it's 1,7-diene, that would imply two double bonds? No, wait, no. Diene means two double bonds? Or is it monoene?

No, wait, all the options are dienes. Because they have two double bonds. Wait, no, no. Diene is two double bonds? No, wait, diene is two double bonds? No, wait, diene is a molecule with two double bonds, but in this case, each option is an octadiene, which is a single diene (two double bonds in a row?), or maybe a single double bond between two substituents.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's try to imagine the starting material.

Option B is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene. So the double bonds are between C2-C3 and C6-C7.

Wait, let me try to imagine how the ring would form.

In ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes exchange substituents and form a new ring. So, the two alkenes are on opposite ends of the chain, or perhaps in positions that allow the formation of the ring.

Assuming that the starting material is a diene (two alkenes) arranged so that the ring can form when the alkenes undergo metathesis.

So, if the product has cyclohexene, the starting material must have a chain that when the two ends are connected, forms a six-membered ring.

Wait, so the starting material is an eight-carbon diene. When it undergoes ring-closing metathesis, the two double bonds will be positioned such that when they close, the ring has six members.

Wait, perhaps the distance between the two double bonds should be four carbons apart, because when they close, the number of ring members would be 4 (from the chain) + 2 (from each double bond) = 6.

Wait, not exactly. Let me think: the number of atoms in the ring is determined by how the chain is connected. For a six-membered ring, the chain between the two double bonds should be four carbons. Because each double bond has two carbons, and the four in between make a total of six.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's think about the product. The product is cyclohexene with substituents at 3,4,5.

So, to form that, the starting material must have substituents that, when the ring forms, end up in positions 3,4,5.

Let me think about substituting numbers. Let's imagine the starting material is a straight chain with substituents at certain positions. When the ends connect, those substituents end up in the positions dictated by the ring structure.

So, the starting material would have substituents at positions that, when the ring is formed, they end up in the correct positions.

Let me take the product structure and count the positions. Product is cyclohexene:

Positions 1 (double bond start) → 2 → 3 (methyl) → 4 (methyl) →5 (isopropyl) →6 →1.

Wait, no, cyclohexene is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So the numbering goes 1,2,3,4,5,6. The substituents are at 3,4,5.

So, when the starting material is a straight chain, the substituents would be in a way that when the ends are connected, they're at 3,4,5.

Wait, perhaps in the starting material, the substituents are on carbons that, when the ring is formed, become positions 3,4,5.

Wait, maybe the starting material has substituents on carbons that are at positions that, when the ends of the chain are connected, their positions wrap around to become 3,4,5.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in positions that, when the chain is folded to form the ring, the substituents end up at the correct positions.

Let me try with option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? Wait, no, octa is eight carbons. So the structure would be: CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. Wait, but that's nine carbons. Wait, no, octa is eight, so the double bonds would be at 1 and 7, but for eight carbons, the positions would be from 1-8. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? Wait, no, that's nine carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting the numbering wrong.

Wait, an eight-carbon chain with double bonds at positions 1 and 7. So:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2? But that can't be right since octa would be 8 carbons, so the double bonds would be at 1 and 7. Wait, octa-1,7-diene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 7-8. So the structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. But wait, that's actually 1,7-diene in an eight-carbon chain.

Wait, but that's a single diene? No, diene is two double bonds. Oh wait, no. Wait, diene is a molecule with two double bonds. Each diene in the options has two double bonds.

Wait, perhaps each option is a monoene with two double bonds. No, that's not possible. Wait, each option is an octadiene, which is a diene with two double bonds. So the starting material has two double bonds, and upon metathesis, the ends connect to form the ring.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the positions of the substituents. The product has substituents at 3,4,5. So in the starting material, those substituents would be in positions that, when the ring forms, their positions become 3,4,5.

Perhaps the substituents in the starting material are positioned such that when the ends of the chain are joined to form the ring, their positions shift accordingly.

Wait, let's imagine the starting material as a diene with substituents in the middle. So when the metathesis happens, the substituents end up in the correct positions.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material's substituents are at positions that, when the ring closes, they end up at positions 3,4,5.

Let me think: After the ring closes, the substituents are in the positions corresponding to the product. So, their positions in the starting material would be such that when the ring forms, their positions wrap around.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are in the middle of the chain. For example, if the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene, then when the ring closes (from 1 to 8, but wait, octa is 8 carbons; 1 and 7 would be the ends), the substituents would be in positions that, after ring formation, are in positions 3,4,5.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to count the number of carbons between substituents.

The product has substituents at 3,4,5. So in the starting material, which is a straight chain, these substituents would be at positions that, when the ring closes, they end up at 3,4,5.

Assuming the starting material is an octadiene, when it undergoes ring-closing metathesis, the two ends (the double bonds) will connect, forming a ring. The number of carbons in the ring would be the number of carbons between the two double bonds plus the two from each double bond.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has double bonds at positions 1 and 5, so that when it closes, it forms a six-membered ring. Because 1 and 5 would be separated by three carbons, plus the two from the double bonds, making 5? No, wait. Let me think: if the starting material is an eight-carbon diene with double bonds at 1 and 6, then when they close, the ring would have 6 members (because 8 carbons minus 2 for the double bonds gives 6). Wait, perhaps that's the case.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a diene with double bonds at positions 1 and 6. So, CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2=CH2. Wait, no, octa is eight carbons, so for 1,6-diene, that would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with another double bond at 6? Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Another approach: the product is a six-membered ring with substituents at 3,4,5. So in the starting material, the substituents are at positions that are three, four, and five carbons away from the ends that will form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material's substituents are in the middle of the chain, which will end up as positions 3,4,5 in the ring.

Let me think about the substituent positions in each option.

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene.

In this structure, substituents are at C3 (methyl), C4 (methyl), and C5 (isopropyl). The double bonds are at 1 and 7.

When the metathesis occurs, the two double bonds (at 1 and 7) will exchange partners, leading to the formation of a ring. The two ends (C1 and C7) will connect. So, the chain between C1 and C7 is C2, C3, C4, C5, C6. So that's five carbons between the two ends. When they connect, the ring would have 5+2=7 members? That can't be right because the product is a six-membered ring.

Hmm, that doesn't add up. The product is cyclohexene, which is six-membered. So perhaps the starting material should have a chain that, when connected, forms six members. So the distance between the two double bonds must be four carbons. Because 4 (between) + 2 (from each double bond) = 6.

So the starting material's double bonds should be positioned such that there are four carbons between them.

Wait, an eight-carbon chain with double bonds at positions 1 and 5. Because 1 and 5 would have three carbons in between (2,3,4), which would make four when counting including the double bond positions.

Wait, no, positions 1 and 5 would be separated by four carbons (positions 2,3,4,5). Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has double bonds at positions 2 and 6, which would give a four-carbon chain between them. Let's see: positions 2 and 6, so the chain between them is 3,4,5 – that's three carbons. Plus the two double bonds, making a total of five, not six. Hmm, that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the correct starting material has double bonds at positions 1 and 5 in an eight-carbon chain. So, the chain between 1 and 5 is 4 carbons (positions 2,3,4,5). So when the metathesis occurs, the ring formed would have 4 + 2 = 6 members. That makes sense because 4 between plus 2 from each end makes 6.

So the starting material should have double bonds at 1 and 5, but looking at the options, none of them have 1,5-diene. The options are 1,7; 2,6; 1,6; and 1,7 in another option.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: octa-1,7-diene → doubles at 1 and 7 → distance between is 5 carbons (positions 2,3,4,5,6,7?) Wait, no, 1 and 7 in octa would have 5 carbons in between (since 7-1=6, but the number of carbons between is 5). That would make the ring have 5+2=7, which is not the case.

Option B: octa-2,6-diene → doubles at 2 and 6 → the chain between them is 3,4,5 → 3 carbons between. So total ring size would be 3 + 2 = 5, which is less than six.

Hmm, that's not matching.

Option C: octa-1,6-diene → doubles at 1 and 6 → the chain between them is 2,3,4,5 → 4 carbons. So 4 + 2 = 6. That fits.

So option C would form a six-membered ring when the double bonds undergo metathesis.

Now, the substituents in the starting material should end up in the correct positions in the product.

So, the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene (Option C). Let's see:

The structure would be:

1: CH2=CH-

2: CH2-

3: CH(CH3)-

4: CH(CH3)-

5: CH(CH2CH(CH2)) [Wait, no, wait, 5 is isopropyl. So substituent at 5 is isopropyl.

Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3)) – but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the substituents in the starting material (option C) are at positions 3,4,5. When the metathesis occurs, the ends (positions 1 and 6) will connect, forming a ring.

So, the substituent at position 5 (isopropyl) would be in the middle of the chain, which when the ring forms, it would end up at position 5 in the product. Similarly, the substituents at 3 and 4 would end up at 3 and 4 in the product.

Wait, but in the product, the substituents are at positions 3,4,5, which would correspond to substituents in the starting material at positions 3,4,5. So when the ring forms, those substituents are on the same positions in the ring.

So, when the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene (option C), upon metathesis, the ring would form between positions 1 and 6, making a six-membered ring. The substituents at 3,4,5 would be placed correctly in the ring.

Therefore, the correct starting material is option C.


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, we analyze the structure of the product and the options provided. The product is a six-membered cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). In ring-closing metathesis, the starting material must be a diene (a molecule with two double bonds) where the two alkenes are positioned such that their reconnection forms the six-membered ring.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Product Structure**: The product has six carbons in the ring, with substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5. This indicates that the starting material must have substituents at positions that will align correctly when the ring forms.

2. **Ring Formation**: For a six-membered ring to form, the two double bonds in the starting material must be separated by four carbons. This ensures that the total number of carbons in the ring (including the carbons from the double bonds) sums to six.

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene)**: The double bonds are at positions 1 and 7, leaving five carbons between them. This would form a seven-membered ring, which does not match the product.
   - **Option B (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene)**: The double bonds are at positions 2 and 6, leaving three carbons between them. This would form a five-membered ring, which does not match the product.
   - **Option C (5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene)**: The double bonds are at positions 1 and 6, leaving four carbons between them. This forms a six-membered ring, matching the product. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the starting material align correctly in the product.
   - **Option D (4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene)**: The substituents are misplaced, and the double bonds at positions 1 and 7 would form a seven-membered ring, which does not match the product.

### Conclusion:
The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene** (Option C), as it has the appropriate substituents and double bond positions to form the desired six-membered ring via ring-closing metathesis.
