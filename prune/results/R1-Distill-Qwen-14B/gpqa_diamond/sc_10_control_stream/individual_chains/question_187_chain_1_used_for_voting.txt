Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and whether it can detect certain stars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT telescopes. It's designed for things like detecting exoplanets and studying the universe's expansion. The question is about the detectability of stars based on signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and exposure time.

The question lists six stars (a to f), each with different properties. I need to figure out which ones meet the S/N ≥10 per binned pixel in a 1-hour exposure.

So, the key factors here are the brightness of the star and its distance from us because that will determine how much light (flux) we receive. The formula I think relates the flux to the apparent magnitude. Absolute magnitude is the brightness at a standard distance (10 pc), so I need to calculate the apparent magnitude for each star.

Wait, how does distance affect the apparent magnitude? Oh right, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d / 10), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs. So, if a star is closer, its apparent magnitude m will be smaller (brighter), and if it's farther, m increases (dimmer).

Once I have the apparent magnitude, I can relate that to the flux. The flux F is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m), but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Oh wait, the flux received from a star depends on its luminosity and distance. But for apparent magnitude, m, the flux F is F = F_0 * 10^(-0.4 * m), where F_0 is the reference flux for m=0.

But how does this relate to the signal-to-noise ratio? I think S/N depends on the flux because higher flux means more photons, which increases the signal. The noise usually scales with the square root of the flux or the time of exposure. Wait, for a given exposure time, the S/N is proportional to the square root of the flux. Or wait, I think the S/N is calculated as (flux) / (noise). The noise is typically proportional to the square root of the flux, because noise increases with the number of photons (which is related to flux). Hmm, so S/N = flux / sqrt(flux) ) = sqrt(flux). Oh wait, that might not be exactly right because other factors like the instrument's efficiency, exposure time, and detector characteristics also come into play.

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula for S/N in terms of magnitudes. I remember that the S/N ratio for a star observed for a certain time can be approximated using a formula that depends on the star's apparent magnitude.

I think the formula is something like S/N = 5 * 10^(-0.5*(m - m0)), where m0 is the magnitude corresponding to a certain S/N. But I'm not exactly sure about the constants. Alternatively, I've heard that for a 1-hour exposure with ESPRESSO, the S/N per pixel is about 10 for a certain magnitude.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the typical S/N provided by ESPRESSO. From what I remember, ESPRESSO can achieve a S/N of around 100 per pixel for very bright stars, but for fainter ones, it goes down. But I'm not sure about the exact numbers here.

Alternatively, the question provides that a star is detectable if S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to determine for each star whether their apparent magnitude would allow this S/N.

But how is the S/N calculated? Let me think. The S/N scales with the flux, and the flux is inversely proportional to the distance squared. Also, apparent magnitude m is related to flux as F = F_0 * 10^(-0.4 m), where F_0 is the reference flux for m=0 (which is a very bright star).

But I'm a bit stuck on how to translate the magnitude into S/N. Maybe I should find the formula that relates m to S/N.

I think there's a formula that S/N ≈ 5 * 10^(-0.4 (m - m_0)) * sqrt(t), where t is the exposure time. Wait, but in our case, the exposure time is fixed at 1 hour, so the sqrt(t) would be a constant factor.

Wait, maybe it's better to look for the relation between S/N and magnitude for ESPRESSO. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the concept of limiting magnitude. The limiting magnitude is the faintest star detectable with a given S/N. So, if I can find the limiting V magnitude for ESPRESSO that would give S/N=10 per binned pixel in 1 hour, then I can compute the apparent magnitude for each star and see if it's brighter than (or equal to) this limiting magnitude.

So, how do I find the limiting magnitude of ESPRESSO? Hmm, I remember that ESPRESSO has a high resolving power, but how does that affect its sensitivity? I think the spectrograph's sensitivity depends on both the telescope's collecting area and the instrument's efficiency.

The VLT telescopes are 8.2m in diameter each. The combined area for one telescope (since ESPRESSO is coupled with a single 8m VLT, not all four) is π*(4.1m)^2 ≈ 53 m². But wait, each VLT unit has a diameter of 8.2 meters, so radius is 4.1 m. Area is π*4.1^2 ≈ 52.8 m².

But wait, actually, when using the telescope, the collecting area is the area of the primary mirror, so for an 8.2m mirror, the area is π*(4.1)^2 ≈ 52.8 m². But I think the formula for the flux received from a star depends on the star's luminosity, distance, and the telescope's area.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think differently. The signal (flux) from the star goes into the spectrograph. The S/N depends on the number of photons collected. So, for a star of a given apparent magnitude, the brighter it is (lower m), the higher the flux, leading to higher S/N.

But I need a way to compute whether each star's apparent V magnitude is bright enough to give S/N ≥10 in 1 hour.

Wait, perhaps I can find the relation between the apparent magnitude and the S/N for ESPRESSO in 1 hour. Let's say that for a star of V magnitude m, the S/N per binned pixel is S/N = k * 10^(-0.4 (m - m0)), where k is a constant that depends on the instrument's sensitivity and exposure time.

Alternatively, perhaps there's an approximate formula or known values. I remember that for high-resolution spectrographs like ESPRESSO, the S/N might be sufficient for stars down to about 20th magnitude or so, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but the ESPRESSO instrument's website might have some info. Oh wait, the user provided a link, but I can't actually click it. But perhaps I can remember that ESPRESSO has a high efficiency and can reach fainter magnitudes than older spectrographs.

Alternatively, another approach: the signal-to-noise ratio per pixel is given by:

S/N = (flux) / (noise)

The flux is proportional to the number of photons, which for a star of apparent magnitude m, is F = F_0 * 10^(-0.4 m), where F_0 is the flux for m=0.

The noise is sqrt(flux), assuming photon noise dominates. So S/N = F / sqrt(F) = sqrt(F) = sqrt(F_0) * 10^(-0.2 m).

So S/N = sqrt(F_0) * 10^(-0.2 m).

We want S/N >=10, so:

10^(-0.2 m) >= 10 / sqrt(F_0)

Taking log base 10:

-0.2 m >= log10(10 / sqrt(F_0)) 

Multiply both sides by -5 (remembering to reverse inequality):

m <= 5 * log10(10 / sqrt(F_0)) )

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let's think in terms of F_0. Suppose F_0 is the flux for m=0, which is a very bright star. Then the flux for m=5 would be F_0 * 10^(-2) (since 0.4 *5=2). Wait, but I'm not sure about F_0.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the standard S/N for a given exposure time. I've heard that for ESPRESSO, the S/N per pixel for a star with V=10 is about 100 per hour. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. If that's the case, then for an hour, V=10 gives S/N=100. So for V=15, which is 5 magnitudes fainter, S/N would be 100 * 10^(-0.5 *5) )= 100 * 10^(-2.5) ≈ 100 / 316 ≈ 0.316, which is way below 10. But that can't be right because that would suggest that even a star with V=15 is way too faint, but I know that ESPRESSO is pretty sensitive.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong reference point. Maybe the S/N scales with 10^(-0.4 (m - m_ref)) * sqrt(t), where m_ref is the reference magnitude.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a formula that relates the S/N to the magnitude and exposure time.

Wait, I think the formula is S/N = 5 * 10^(-0.4 (m - m0)) * sqrt(t), where m0 is the magnitude that gives S/N=5 in 1 second. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, I've heard that for a typical spectrograph, each magnitude change affects the S/N by a factor of about 2.51 (since 10^0.4 ≈ 2.51).

Wait, let's get back to basics. The flux from a star is F = F_0 * 10^(-0.4 m), and the noise is sqrt(F). So S/N = F / noise = F / sqrt(F) ) = sqrt(F) = sqrt(F_0) * 10^(-0.2 m).

We require S/N >=10.

So sqrt(F_0) * 10^(-0.2 m) >=10.

So 10^(-0.2 m) >= 10 / sqrt(F_0).

Take log10: -0.2 m >= log10(10 / sqrt(F_0)).

Which is -0.2 m >= (1 - 0.5 * log10(F_0)).

Wait, not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of F_0.

Let me think about the formula again. The S/N is proportional to the square root of the flux. So, S/N = k * sqrt(F), where k is a proportionality constant that depends on the exposure time and instrument efficiency.

But F is proportional to 10^(-0.4 m), so S/N = k * sqrt(10^(-0.4 m)) ) = k * 10^(-0.2 m).

So S/N = k * 10^(-0.2 m).

We can write this as 10^(-0.2 m) = S/N / k.

We want S/N >=10. So,

10^(-0.2 m) >= 10 / k.

Taking log base 10:

-0.2 m >= log10(10) - log10(k)

Which is:

-0.2 m >= 1 - log10(k)

Multiply both sides by -5:

m <= (log10(k) -1 ) * 5.

So m must be less than or equal to 5( log10(k) -1 )

But I don't know the value of k for ESPRESSO. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the limiting magnitude for ESPRESSO. If I can find that, then I can determine which stars are brighter than that.

But I don't have that data. Maybe I should look for typical S/N values for ESPRESSO. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is very sensitive. In 1 hour, it can reach S/N of 100 for V=15 stars? Or maybe it's a bit fainter.

Wait, I think that ESPRESSO is capable of achieving S/N=100 for stars around V=19 in 1 hour. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe some of the stars in the options are too faint.

Wait, but the options are about whether the S/N is at least 10. So if a star is, say, V=15, and in 1 hour, the S/N is 100, that's way more than enough. But if it's V=20 and the S/N is 10, that would work.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me list the stars and compute their apparent magnitudes.

The stars are:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Star at 10 pc, Mv=15
d) Star at 200 pc, Mv=15
e) Star at 5 pc, Mv=15
f) Star at 50 pc, Mv=15

Wait, for stars c, d, e, f: they all have absolute magnitude Mv=15. The distance varies, so their apparent magnitude will vary.

Let me compute the apparent magnitude for each of these.

The formula is m = M +5 log10(d/10), where d is in parsecs.

So for each star:

c) d=10 pc:
m =15 +5 log10(10/10) =15 +5 log10(1) =15+0=15.

d) d=200 pc:
m=15 +5 log(200/10)=15 +5 log(20)=15 +5*(1.3010)=15 +6.505=21.505.

e) d=5 pc:
m=15 +5 log(5/10)=15 +5 log(0.5)=15 +5*(-0.3010)=15-1.505=13.495.

f) d=50 pc:
m=15 +5 log(50/10)=15 +5 log(5)=15 +5*(0.69897)=15 +3.495=18.495.

Now, for the other stars:

a) Canopus: I think Canopus is a very bright star. Its apparent magnitude is about -0.75, making it one of the brightest stars in the sky.

b) Polaris: It's the North Star, but it's a variable star. I think its apparent magnitude is around 1.9 to 2.1.

So, for each star, their apparent magnitudes:

a) m ≈ -0.75

b) m ≈ 2.0

c) m=15

d) m≈21.5

e) m≈13.5

f) m≈18.5

Now, I need to figure out which of these can provide S/N >=10 in 1 hour with ESPRESSO.

Assuming that the S/N scales with the square root of the flux, and since flux is F = F_0 * 10^(-0.4 m), then S/N is proportional to sqrt(F) = sqrt(F_0) * 10^(-0.2 m).

But without knowing F_0 or the exact relation, perhaps I can make some educated guesses based on typical performance.

From what I remember, ESPRESSO is designed to achieve high S/N for a wide range of stars. For bright stars, the S/N is high, even per pixel.

But perhaps the limiting factor is the faintest magnitude that can achieve S/N=10.

Let me think: if for a star with m=V, the S/N is 10, then for m=V + 5, the S/N would be ~10 / (2.51)^(5/2). Wait, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can refer to the ESPRESSO's design parameters. It's said to have a high efficiency, so maybe it can reach S/N=10 even for stars around m=20 in 1 hour. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the stars in the options have m values up to about 21.5, like star d.

If ESPRESSO can reach S/N=10 for stars up to m=20, then stars a, b, c, e, f would be detectable (since their m is lower than 20), but d would not be. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the opposite. Maybe ESPRESSO's S/N drops off quickly beyond a certain magnitude. For example, maybe it can achieve S/N=10 only for stars with m up to 15.

Wait, that would make star c (m=15) detectable, but stars e (13.5), f(18.5), d(21.5) would be a mix.

Wait, but the question is about per binned pixel. So perhaps the resolution and binning affect the S/N per pixel. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the sensitivity curve of ESPRESSO. If it can obtain S/N=10 for a star with m=15 in 1 hour, then any star brighter than that (lower m) would have higher S/N.

Let me consider each star:

a) m=-0.75: very bright, S/N would be way above 10.

b) m=2.0: bright enough, S/N high.

c) m=15: perhaps exactly at the threshold if the limit is m=15.

d) m=21.5: probably too faint, S/N <10.

e) m=13.5: brighter than 15, so S/N higher than 10.

f) m=18.5: depends on whether the limit is above or below 18.5.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact limit. Let me think again. If I assume that ESPRESSO can achieve S/N=10 for stars up to m=15, then stars a, b, c, and e would be detectable. Star f (m=18.5) would be too faint, and d (21.5) as well.

But then what about the others? How many would that be?

Wait, the options are a, b, c, d, e, f.

If the detectable stars are a, b, c, e, that's 4 stars. But wait, if the limit is m=15, then star c is exactly at 15, so it's included. Star e is brighter (m=13.5), so included. Star f is m=18.5, which is fainter than 15, so not included. So a, b, c, e: four stars. But wait, the options are a, b, c, d, e, f. So that would be 4. But the options given are A)2, B)5, C)4, D)3. So option C is 4, which would imply four detectable stars.

But wait, I'm not sure what the actual limit is. Alternatively, perhaps the limit is higher. Let's say that for m=15, S/N=100, which is way above the required 10. So any star brighter than m=15 would have S/N higher than 10, and stars fainter than 15 would have lower S/N.

Wait, but that would mean that only stars with m ≤15 are detectable. Let's see:

a) m=-0.75: yes.

b) m=2.0: yes.

c) m=15: yes.

e) m=13.5: yes.

f) m=18.5: no.

d) m=21.5: no.

So that's four stars (a, b, c, e) detectable. So the answer would be 4, which is option C.

But wait, wait. What about the star in option f, which is at 50 pc. Its m=18.5. If ESPRESSO can't reach S/N=10 for that, then it's not counted. Similarly, star d (m=21.5) is way too faint.

So, the detectable stars are a, b, c, e. That's four stars.

Wait, but what about star e? It's at 5 pc and Mv=15, so m=13.5. That's brighter than m=15, so it's included.

So that's four stars. So the answer is C) 4.

But wait, another thought. The question says "when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes". ESPRESSO can be used with the four 8m VLTs together to get more light, but if it's coupled with just one, it would have the collecting area of one, not four. So the sensitivity would be lower than if all four were used.

Wait, in the question, it says "coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes", so we're considering the case where only one telescope is used.

So, with one 8m VLT, what's the typical limit for S/N=10? If for one telescope, the limit is say m=15, then stars a, b, c, e, and f (wait, f is m=18.5, which is fainter than 15, so not included). No, wait, e is m=13.5, which is included.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the exposure time. The question specifies 1 hour, which is much longer than typical exposures, so perhaps ESPRESSO can detect stars fainter than this.

Alternatively, maybe the limit is m=20. So stars a, b, c, e, f would be detectable (since 13.5, 15, 2.0, -0.75 are all below 20). Wait, but that would be 5 stars. But in that case, star d (m=21.5) would be too faint, so only 5 stars would be detectable.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to think again.

If the S/N scales with the square root of the exposure time, then longer exposures improve S/N. But the question states a fixed 1-hour exposure.

So, perhaps the number of detectable stars depends on the S/N limit.

Let me try to model this. Let's assume that for a star with m=V, the S/N per binned pixel after 1 hour is S/N = 10^(0.5) * (some constant) * 10^(-0.4 * V), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the S/N as S/N = 5 * 10^(-0.4 (V - V0)) * sqrt(t), where V0 is a reference magnitude, and t is the exposure time in hours.

But without knowing V0 or the exact formula, this is tricky.

Alternatively, I can search my memory for any information on ESPRESSO's performance. I recall that ESPRESSO can achieve a S/N of about 100 per pixel for stars around V=9 in 1 hour. Wait, but that would mean that for a star with V=15, the S/N would be 100 * (10^(-0.4*6)) ≈ 100 * (10^-2.4) ≈ 100 / 25.1 ≈ ~3.98, which is below 10. But that can't be right because that would suggest that only very few stars are detectable.

Wait, but perhaps I'm mixing up the exposure time. Maybe for longer exposures, the S/N goes up. But the question says 1 hour, so perhaps I should stick with that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the formula that relates the S/N as a function of magnitude and exposure time. The formula I found elsewhere is S/N = 5 * 10^(-0.4 (m - m0)) * sqrt(t), where m0 is the magnitude for S/N=5 in 1 second. But without knowing m0, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, if I assume that for m=10, the S/N is 100 in 1 hour, then for m=15, which is 5 magnitudes fainter, the S/N would be 100 * 10^(-2.5) ≈ 100 / 316 ≈ 0.316, which is way below 10. That can't be right because that would mean only very few stars are detectable.

But I know that ESPRESSO is supposed to be a high-precision spectrograph. Maybe it's designed for stars down to around m=19 or so in 1 hour.

Alternatively, perhaps the limit is m=15, which would mean that stars a, b, c, e, and f (m=13.5, 2.0, -0.75, 15, 18.5) are detectable, but d (m=21.5) is not. So that's five stars (a, b, c, e, f), which would make option B (5) the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought the limit is m=15, so only four stars (a, b, c, e) are detectable (since f is m=18.5>15).

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible answers.

The options are:

A) 2

B)5

C)4

D)3

If I think that ESPRESSO can detect up to m≈18 with S/N=10, then stars a, b, c, e, f (m=-0.75, 2.0,15,13.5,18.5) would be detectable. That's five stars, so answer B).

But if the limit is m=15, then a, b, c, e are detectable. That's four, so answer C).

Alternatively, perhaps the limit is m=18, which would include e (13.5), f (18.5). Wait, but 18.5 is above 18, so not included. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the signal depends on the number of photons collected. The number of photons is proportional to the flux, which in turn depends on the star's apparent magnitude.

The formula for the number of photons N is N = N0 * 10^(-0.4 m), where N0 is the number for m=0.

The S/N is sqrt(N), so S/N = sqrt(N0) * 10^(-0.2 m).

So, to get S/N >=10:

10^(-0.2 m) >=10 / sqrt(N0).

Let me compute for when m=15:

10^(-3) >= 10 / sqrt(N0) → 0.001 >= 10/sqrt(N0) → sqrt(N0) >=10,000 → N0 >=1e8.

But I don't know what N0 is for ESPRESSO in 1 hour. Alternatively, perhaps I can make some assumptions.

Assume that for a star of m=10, the S/N is 100. Then, for m=15, it's 100 * (10^(-2.0)) )=100/100=1, which is below 10. That's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps for m=15, the S/N is 10. Then, stars brighter than m=15 will have S/N>10.

So, stars a, b, c, e would be detectable (since their m is ≤15), and f and d are not.

That gives four detectable stars.

So the answer would be C)4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes, we need to assess whether the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel can be achieved during a 1-hour exposure. The detectability depends on the apparent magnitude of the star, which is calculated using the formula:

\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d / 10)
\]

where \( M \) is the absolute magnitude and \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The S/N scales with the square root of the flux, and for a given exposure time, the flux is proportional to \( 10^{-0.4m} \). Thus, fainter stars (higher \( m \)) will have lower S/N, and only stars brighter than a certain limiting magnitude will meet the S/N requirement of 10.

### Apparent Magnitudes of the Stars
1. **Canopus (a):** A very bright star with an apparent magnitude \( m \approx -0.75 \).
2. **Polaris (b):** A bright star with an apparent magnitude \( m \approx 2.0 \).
3. **Star c:** Absolute magnitude \( M = 15 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(10 / 10) = 15 + 0 = 15
   \]
4. **Star d:** Absolute magnitude \( M = 15 \), distance \( d = 200 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(200 / 10) = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(20) \approx 15 + 6.505 = 21.505
   \]
5. **Star e:** Absolute magnitude \( M = 15 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5 / 10) = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(0.5) \approx 15 - 1.505 = 13.495
   \]
6. **Star f:** Absolute magnitude \( M = 15 \), distance \( d = 50 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(50 / 10) = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5) \approx 15 + 3.495 = 18.495
   \]

### Detectability Analysis
The S/N per binned pixel depends on the apparent magnitude \( m \). For ESPRESSO, the S/N scales as \( S/N \propto 10^{-0.2m} \). Assuming the instrument achieves \( S/N = 10 \) for stars with \( m \leq 15 \), the detectability of each star is as follows:

1. **Canopus (a):** \( m \approx -0.75 \) (very bright, S/N >> 10) **- Detectable.**
2. **Polaris (b):** \( m \approx 2.0 \) (bright, S/N >> 10) **- Detectable.**
3. **Star c:** \( m = 15 \) (exactly at the threshold, S/N = 10) **- Detectable.**
4. **Star d:** \( m \approx 21.5 \) (too faint, S/N < 10) **- Not detectable.**
5. **Star e:** \( m \approx 13.5 \) (brighter than \( m = 15 \), S/N > 10) **- Detectable.**
6. **Star f:** \( m \approx 18.5 \) (too faint, S/N < 10) **- Not detectable.**

### Conclusion
The detectable stars are **a, b, c, and e**, making a total of **4 detectable stars**.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the ESPRESSO spectrograph and whether it can detect certain stars. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the VLT telescopes. It's designed for things like detecting exoplanets and studying the universe's expansion. The question is about the detectability of stars based on signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and exposure time.

The question lists six stars (a to f), each with different properties. I need to figure out which ones meet the S/N ≥10 per binned pixel in a 1-hour exposure.

So, the key factors here are the brightness of the star and its distance from us because that will determine how much light (flux) we receive. The formula I think relates the flux to the apparent magnitude. Absolute magnitude is the brightness at a standard distance (10 pc), so I need to calculate the apparent magnitude for each star.

Wait, how does distance affect the apparent magnitude? Oh right, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d / 10), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs. So, if a star is closer, its apparent magnitude m will be smaller (brighter), and if it's farther, m increases (dimmer).

Once I have the apparent magnitude, I can relate that to the flux. The flux F is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m), but I'm not sure about the exact formula. Oh wait, the flux received from a star depends on its luminosity and distance. But for apparent magnitude, m, the flux F is F = F_0 * 10^(-0.4 * m), where F_0 is the reference flux for m=0.

But how does this relate to the signal-to-noise ratio? I think S/N depends on the flux because higher flux means more photons, which increases the signal. The noise usually scales with the square root of the flux or the time of exposure. Wait, for a given exposure time, the S/N is proportional to the square root of the flux. Or wait, I think the S/N is calculated as (flux) / (noise). The noise is typically proportional to the square root of the flux, because noise increases with the number of photons (which is related to flux). Hmm, so S/N = flux / sqrt(flux) ) = sqrt(flux). Oh wait, that might not be exactly right because other factors like the instrument's efficiency, exposure time, and detector characteristics also come into play.

Wait, maybe I should think about the formula for S/N in terms of magnitudes. I remember that the S/N ratio for a star observed for a certain time can be approximated using a formula that depends on the star's apparent magnitude.

I think the formula is something like S/N = 5 * 10^(-0.5*(m - m0)), where m0 is the magnitude corresponding to a certain S/N. But I'm not exactly sure about the constants. Alternatively, I've heard that for a 1-hour exposure with ESPRESSO, the S/N per pixel is about 10 for a certain magnitude.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the typical S/N provided by ESPRESSO. From what I remember, ESPRESSO can achieve a S/N of around 100 per pixel for very bright stars, but for fainter ones, it goes down. But I'm not sure about the exact numbers here.

Alternatively, the question provides that a star is detectable if S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. So I need to determine for each star whether their apparent magnitude would allow this S/N.

But how is the S/N calculated? Let me think. The S/N scales with the flux, and the flux is inversely proportional to the distance squared. Also, apparent magnitude m is related to flux as F = F_0 * 10^(-0.4 m), where F_0 is the reference flux for m=0 (which is a very bright star).

But I'm a bit stuck on how to translate the magnitude into S/N. Maybe I should find the formula that relates m to S/N.

I think there's a formula that S/N ≈ 5 * 10^(-0.4 (m - m_0)) * sqrt(t), where t is the exposure time. Wait, but in our case, the exposure time is fixed at 1 hour, so the sqrt(t) would be a constant factor.

Wait, maybe it's better to look for the relation between S/N and magnitude for ESPRESSO. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the concept of limiting magnitude. The limiting magnitude is the faintest star detectable with a given S/N. So, if I can find the limiting V magnitude for ESPRESSO that would give S/N=10 per binned pixel in 1 hour, then I can compute the apparent magnitude for each star and see if it's brighter than (or equal to) this limiting magnitude.

So, how do I find the limiting magnitude of ESPRESSO? Hmm, I remember that ESPRESSO has a high resolving power, but how does that affect its sensitivity? I think the spectrograph's sensitivity depends on both the telescope's collecting area and the instrument's efficiency.

The VLT telescopes are 8.2m in diameter each. The combined area for one telescope (since ESPRESSO is coupled with a single 8m VLT, not all four) is π*(4.1m)^2 ≈ 53 m². But wait, each VLT unit has a diameter of 8.2 meters, so radius is 4.1 m. Area is π*4.1^2 ≈ 52.8 m².

But wait, actually, when using the telescope, the collecting area is the area of the primary mirror, so for an 8.2m mirror, the area is π*(4.1)^2 ≈ 52.8 m². But I think the formula for the flux received from a star depends on the star's luminosity, distance, and the telescope's area.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think differently. The signal (flux) from the star goes into the spectrograph. The S/N depends on the number of photons collected. So, for a star of a given apparent magnitude, the brighter it is (lower m), the higher the flux, leading to higher S/N.

But I need a way to compute whether each star's apparent V magnitude is bright enough to give S/N ≥10 in 1 hour.

Wait, perhaps I can find the relation between the apparent magnitude and the S/N for ESPRESSO in 1 hour. Let's say that for a star of V magnitude m, the S/N per binned pixel is S/N = k * 10^(-0.4 (m - m0)), where k is a constant that depends on the instrument's sensitivity and exposure time.

Alternatively, perhaps there's an approximate formula or known values. I remember that for high-resolution spectrographs like ESPRESSO, the S/N might be sufficient for stars down to about 20th magnitude or so, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but the ESPRESSO instrument's website might have some info. Oh wait, the user provided a link, but I can't actually click it. But perhaps I can remember that ESPRESSO has a high efficiency and can reach fainter magnitudes than older spectrographs.

Alternatively, another approach: the signal-to-noise ratio per pixel is given by:

S/N = (flux) / (noise)

The flux is proportional to the number of photons, which for a star of apparent magnitude m, is F = F_0 * 10^(-0.4 m), where F_0 is the flux for m=0.

The noise is sqrt(flux), assuming photon noise dominates. So S/N = F / sqrt(F) = sqrt(F) = sqrt(F_0) * 10^(-0.2 m).

So S/N = sqrt(F_0) * 10^(-0.2 m).

We want S/N >=10, so:

10^(-0.2 m) >= 10 / sqrt(F_0)

Taking log base 10:

-0.2 m >= log10(10 / sqrt(F_0)) 

Multiply both sides by -5 (remembering to reverse inequality):

m <= 5 * log10(10 / sqrt(F_0)) )

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let's think in terms of F_0. Suppose F_0 is the flux for m=0, which is a very bright star. Then the flux for m=5 would be F_0 * 10^(-2) (since 0.4 *5=2). Wait, but I'm not sure about F_0.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the standard S/N for a given exposure time. I've heard that for ESPRESSO, the S/N per pixel for a star with V=10 is about 100 per hour. Wait, but I'm not sure about that. If that's the case, then for an hour, V=10 gives S/N=100. So for V=15, which is 5 magnitudes fainter, S/N would be 100 * 10^(-0.5 *5) )= 100 * 10^(-2.5) ≈ 100 / 316 ≈ 0.316, which is way below 10. But that can't be right because that would suggest that even a star with V=15 is way too faint, but I know that ESPRESSO is pretty sensitive.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong reference point. Maybe the S/N scales with 10^(-0.4 (m - m_ref)) * sqrt(t), where m_ref is the reference magnitude.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a formula that relates the S/N to the magnitude and exposure time.

Wait, I think the formula is S/N = 5 * 10^(-0.4 (m - m0)) * sqrt(t), where m0 is the magnitude that gives S/N=5 in 1 second. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, I've heard that for a typical spectrograph, each magnitude change affects the S/N by a factor of about 2.51 (since 10^0.4 ≈ 2.51).

Wait, let's get back to basics. The flux from a star is F = F_0 * 10^(-0.4 m), and the noise is sqrt(F). So S/N = F / noise = F / sqrt(F) ) = sqrt(F) = sqrt(F_0) * 10^(-0.2 m).

We require S/N >=10.

So sqrt(F_0) * 10^(-0.2 m) >=10.

So 10^(-0.2 m) >= 10 / sqrt(F_0).

Take log10: -0.2 m >= log10(10 / sqrt(F_0)).

Which is -0.2 m >= (1 - 0.5 * log10(F_0)).

Wait, not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of F_0.

Let me think about the formula again. The S/N is proportional to the square root of the flux. So, S/N = k * sqrt(F), where k is a proportionality constant that depends on the exposure time and instrument efficiency.

But F is proportional to 10^(-0.4 m), so S/N = k * sqrt(10^(-0.4 m)) ) = k * 10^(-0.2 m).

So S/N = k * 10^(-0.2 m).

We can write this as 10^(-0.2 m) = S/N / k.

We want S/N >=10. So,

10^(-0.2 m) >= 10 / k.

Taking log base 10:

-0.2 m >= log10(10) - log10(k)

Which is:

-0.2 m >= 1 - log10(k)

Multiply both sides by -5:

m <= (log10(k) -1 ) * 5.

So m must be less than or equal to 5( log10(k) -1 )

But I don't know the value of k for ESPRESSO. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the limiting magnitude for ESPRESSO. If I can find that, then I can determine which stars are brighter than that.

But I don't have that data. Maybe I should look for typical S/N values for ESPRESSO. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is very sensitive. In 1 hour, it can reach S/N of 100 for V=15 stars? Or maybe it's a bit fainter.

Wait, I think that ESPRESSO is capable of achieving S/N=100 for stars around V=19 in 1 hour. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe some of the stars in the options are too faint.

Wait, but the options are about whether the S/N is at least 10. So if a star is, say, V=15, and in 1 hour, the S/N is 100, that's way more than enough. But if it's V=20 and the S/N is 10, that would work.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me list the stars and compute their apparent magnitudes.

The stars are:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Star at 10 pc, Mv=15
d) Star at 200 pc, Mv=15
e) Star at 5 pc, Mv=15
f) Star at 50 pc, Mv=15

Wait, for stars c, d, e, f: they all have absolute magnitude Mv=15. The distance varies, so their apparent magnitude will vary.

Let me compute the apparent magnitude for each of these.

The formula is m = M +5 log10(d/10), where d is in parsecs.

So for each star:

c) d=10 pc:
m =15 +5 log10(10/10) =15 +5 log10(1) =15+0=15.

d) d=200 pc:
m=15 +5 log(200/10)=15 +5 log(20)=15 +5*(1.3010)=15 +6.505=21.505.

e) d=5 pc:
m=15 +5 log(5/10)=15 +5 log(0.5)=15 +5*(-0.3010)=15-1.505=13.495.

f) d=50 pc:
m=15 +5 log(50/10)=15 +5 log(5)=15 +5*(0.69897)=15 +3.495=18.495.

Now, for the other stars:

a) Canopus: I think Canopus is a very bright star. Its apparent magnitude is about -0.75, making it one of the brightest stars in the sky.

b) Polaris: It's the North Star, but it's a variable star. I think its apparent magnitude is around 1.9 to 2.1.

So, for each star, their apparent magnitudes:

a) m ≈ -0.75

b) m ≈ 2.0

c) m=15

d) m≈21.5

e) m≈13.5

f) m≈18.5

Now, I need to figure out which of these can provide S/N >=10 in 1 hour with ESPRESSO.

Assuming that the S/N scales with the square root of the flux, and since flux is F = F_0 * 10^(-0.4 m), then S/N is proportional to sqrt(F) = sqrt(F_0) * 10^(-0.2 m).

But without knowing F_0 or the exact relation, perhaps I can make some educated guesses based on typical performance.

From what I remember, ESPRESSO is designed to achieve high S/N for a wide range of stars. For bright stars, the S/N is high, even per pixel.

But perhaps the limiting factor is the faintest magnitude that can achieve S/N=10.

Let me think: if for a star with m=V, the S/N is 10, then for m=V + 5, the S/N would be ~10 / (2.51)^(5/2). Wait, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can refer to the ESPRESSO's design parameters. It's said to have a high efficiency, so maybe it can reach S/N=10 even for stars around m=20 in 1 hour. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the stars in the options have m values up to about 21.5, like star d.

If ESPRESSO can reach S/N=10 for stars up to m=20, then stars a, b, c, e, f would be detectable (since their m is lower than 20), but d would not be. But I'm not certain about that.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the opposite. Maybe ESPRESSO's S/N drops off quickly beyond a certain magnitude. For example, maybe it can achieve S/N=10 only for stars with m up to 15.

Wait, that would make star c (m=15) detectable, but stars e (13.5), f(18.5), d(21.5) would be a mix.

Wait, but the question is about per binned pixel. So perhaps the resolution and binning affect the S/N per pixel. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the sensitivity curve of ESPRESSO. If it can obtain S/N=10 for a star with m=15 in 1 hour, then any star brighter than that (lower m) would have higher S/N.

Let me consider each star:

a) m=-0.75: very bright, S/N would be way above 10.

b) m=2.0: bright enough, S/N high.

c) m=15: perhaps exactly at the threshold if the limit is m=15.

d) m=21.5: probably too faint, S/N <10.

e) m=13.5: brighter than 15, so S/N higher than 10.

f) m=18.5: depends on whether the limit is above or below 18.5.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact limit. Let me think again. If I assume that ESPRESSO can achieve S/N=10 for stars up to m=15, then stars a, b, c, and e would be detectable. Star f (m=18.5) would be too faint, and d (21.5) as well.

But then what about the others? How many would that be?

Wait, the options are a, b, c, d, e, f.

If the detectable stars are a, b, c, e, that's 4 stars. But wait, if the limit is m=15, then star c is exactly at 15, so it's included. Star e is brighter (m=13.5), so included. Star f is m=18.5, which is fainter than 15, so not included. So a, b, c, e: four stars. But wait, the options are a, b, c, d, e, f. So that would be 4. But the options given are A)2, B)5, C)4, D)3. So option C is 4, which would imply four detectable stars.

But wait, I'm not sure what the actual limit is. Alternatively, perhaps the limit is higher. Let's say that for m=15, S/N=100, which is way above the required 10. So any star brighter than m=15 would have S/N higher than 10, and stars fainter than 15 would have lower S/N.

Wait, but that would mean that only stars with m ≤15 are detectable. Let's see:

a) m=-0.75: yes.

b) m=2.0: yes.

c) m=15: yes.

e) m=13.5: yes.

f) m=18.5: no.

d) m=21.5: no.

So that's four stars (a, b, c, e) detectable. So the answer would be 4, which is option C.

But wait, wait. What about the star in option f, which is at 50 pc. Its m=18.5. If ESPRESSO can't reach S/N=10 for that, then it's not counted. Similarly, star d (m=21.5) is way too faint.

So, the detectable stars are a, b, c, e. That's four stars.

Wait, but what about star e? It's at 5 pc and Mv=15, so m=13.5. That's brighter than m=15, so it's included.

So that's four stars. So the answer is C) 4.

But wait, another thought. The question says "when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes". ESPRESSO can be used with the four 8m VLTs together to get more light, but if it's coupled with just one, it would have the collecting area of one, not four. So the sensitivity would be lower than if all four were used.

Wait, in the question, it says "coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes", so we're considering the case where only one telescope is used.

So, with one 8m VLT, what's the typical limit for S/N=10? If for one telescope, the limit is say m=15, then stars a, b, c, e, and f (wait, f is m=18.5, which is fainter than 15, so not included). No, wait, e is m=13.5, which is included.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the exposure time. The question specifies 1 hour, which is much longer than typical exposures, so perhaps ESPRESSO can detect stars fainter than this.

Alternatively, maybe the limit is m=20. So stars a, b, c, e, f would be detectable (since 13.5, 15, 2.0, -0.75 are all below 20). Wait, but that would be 5 stars. But in that case, star d (m=21.5) would be too faint, so only 5 stars would be detectable.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to think again.

If the S/N scales with the square root of the exposure time, then longer exposures improve S/N. But the question states a fixed 1-hour exposure.

So, perhaps the number of detectable stars depends on the S/N limit.

Let me try to model this. Let's assume that for a star with m=V, the S/N per binned pixel after 1 hour is S/N = 10^(0.5) * (some constant) * 10^(-0.4 * V), but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the S/N as S/N = 5 * 10^(-0.4 (V - V0)) * sqrt(t), where V0 is a reference magnitude, and t is the exposure time in hours.

But without knowing V0 or the exact formula, this is tricky.

Alternatively, I can search my memory for any information on ESPRESSO's performance. I recall that ESPRESSO can achieve a S/N of about 100 per pixel for stars around V=9 in 1 hour. Wait, but that would mean that for a star with V=15, the S/N would be 100 * (10^(-0.4*6)) ≈ 100 * (10^-2.4) ≈ 100 / 25.1 ≈ ~3.98, which is below 10. But that can't be right because that would suggest that only very few stars are detectable.

Wait, but perhaps I'm mixing up the exposure time. Maybe for longer exposures, the S/N goes up. But the question says 1 hour, so perhaps I should stick with that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the formula that relates the S/N as a function of magnitude and exposure time. The formula I found elsewhere is S/N = 5 * 10^(-0.4 (m - m0)) * sqrt(t), where m0 is the magnitude for S/N=5 in 1 second. But without knowing m0, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, if I assume that for m=10, the S/N is 100 in 1 hour, then for m=15, which is 5 magnitudes fainter, the S/N would be 100 * 10^(-2.5) ≈ 100 / 316 ≈ 0.316, which is way below 10. That can't be right because that would mean only very few stars are detectable.

But I know that ESPRESSO is supposed to be a high-precision spectrograph. Maybe it's designed for stars down to around m=19 or so in 1 hour.

Alternatively, perhaps the limit is m=15, which would mean that stars a, b, c, e, and f (m=13.5, 2.0, -0.75, 15, 18.5) are detectable, but d (m=21.5) is not. So that's five stars (a, b, c, e, f), which would make option B (5) the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought the limit is m=15, so only four stars (a, b, c, e) are detectable (since f is m=18.5>15).

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of the possible answers.

The options are:

A) 2

B)5

C)4

D)3

If I think that ESPRESSO can detect up to m≈18 with S/N=10, then stars a, b, c, e, f (m=-0.75, 2.0,15,13.5,18.5) would be detectable. That's five stars, so answer B).

But if the limit is m=15, then a, b, c, e are detectable. That's four, so answer C).

Alternatively, perhaps the limit is m=18, which would include e (13.5), f (18.5). Wait, but 18.5 is above 18, so not included. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the signal depends on the number of photons collected. The number of photons is proportional to the flux, which in turn depends on the star's apparent magnitude.

The formula for the number of photons N is N = N0 * 10^(-0.4 m), where N0 is the number for m=0.

The S/N is sqrt(N), so S/N = sqrt(N0) * 10^(-0.2 m).

So, to get S/N >=10:

10^(-0.2 m) >=10 / sqrt(N0).

Let me compute for when m=15:

10^(-3) >= 10 / sqrt(N0) → 0.001 >= 10/sqrt(N0) → sqrt(N0) >=10,000 → N0 >=1e8.

But I don't know what N0 is for ESPRESSO in 1 hour. Alternatively, perhaps I can make some assumptions.

Assume that for a star of m=10, the S/N is 100. Then, for m=15, it's 100 * (10^(-2.0)) )=100/100=1, which is below 10. That's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps for m=15, the S/N is 10. Then, stars brighter than m=15 will have S/N>10.

So, stars a, b, c, e would be detectable (since their m is ≤15), and f and d are not.

That gives four detectable stars.

So the answer would be C)4.


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes, we need to assess whether the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel can be achieved during a 1-hour exposure. The detectability depends on the apparent magnitude of the star, which is calculated using the formula:

\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d / 10)
\]

where \( M \) is the absolute magnitude and \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The S/N scales with the square root of the flux, and for a given exposure time, the flux is proportional to \( 10^{-0.4m} \). Thus, fainter stars (higher \( m \)) will have lower S/N, and only stars brighter than a certain limiting magnitude will meet the S/N requirement of 10.

### Apparent Magnitudes of the Stars
1. **Canopus (a):** A very bright star with an apparent magnitude \( m \approx -0.75 \).
2. **Polaris (b):** A bright star with an apparent magnitude \( m \approx 2.0 \).
3. **Star c:** Absolute magnitude \( M = 15 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(10 / 10) = 15 + 0 = 15
   \]
4. **Star d:** Absolute magnitude \( M = 15 \), distance \( d = 200 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(200 / 10) = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(20) \approx 15 + 6.505 = 21.505
   \]
5. **Star e:** Absolute magnitude \( M = 15 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5 / 10) = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(0.5) \approx 15 - 1.505 = 13.495
   \]
6. **Star f:** Absolute magnitude \( M = 15 \), distance \( d = 50 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(50 / 10) = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5) \approx 15 + 3.495 = 18.495
   \]

### Detectability Analysis
The S/N per binned pixel depends on the apparent magnitude \( m \). For ESPRESSO, the S/N scales as \( S/N \propto 10^{-0.2m} \). Assuming the instrument achieves \( S/N = 10 \) for stars with \( m \leq 15 \), the detectability of each star is as follows:

1. **Canopus (a):** \( m \approx -0.75 \) (very bright, S/N >> 10) **- Detectable.**
2. **Polaris (b):** \( m \approx 2.0 \) (bright, S/N >> 10) **- Detectable.**
3. **Star c:** \( m = 15 \) (exactly at the threshold, S/N = 10) **- Detectable.**
4. **Star d:** \( m \approx 21.5 \) (too faint, S/N < 10) **- Not detectable.**
5. **Star e:** \( m \approx 13.5 \) (brighter than \( m = 15 \), S/N > 10) **- Detectable.**
6. **Star f:** \( m \approx 18.5 \) (too faint, S/N < 10) **- Not detectable.**

### Conclusion
The detectable stars are **a, b, c, and e**, making a total of **4 detectable stars**.

**Answer: C**
