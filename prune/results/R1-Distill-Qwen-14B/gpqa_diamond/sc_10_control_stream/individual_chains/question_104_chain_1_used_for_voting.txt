Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. Hmm, let me think. 

So the question says that there are two stars with the same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet similar to Neptune. The planets are detected using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV method measures the Doppler shift of the star's spectral lines due to the planet's gravitational pull, causing the star to wobble.

Planet #1 causes a shift of 5 milliangstroms, and Planet #2 causes a shift of 7 milliangstroms. Wait, but wait, I remember that in the RV method, the semi-amplitude of the Doppler shift is related to the mass of the planet and the star's properties. Oh right, the formula is something like K = (v) = (G * (M_planet) sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 AU)^0.5 )) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / (2π))^(1/3) ). Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up some terms. Alternatively, I think the formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (G * M_planet * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^0.5 * (1 - e²)^0.5 ) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (P/(2π))^(1/3) ) )

Wait, that seems complicated. Alternatively, I think K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / sqrt(P)), or maybe it's the other way around. Wait, let me think again.

I think the key relation is that the RV semi-amplitude K depends on the planet's mass, the star's mass, the orbital period, and the distance (semi-major axis). Since both stars have the same mass (similar to Sun), and the planets have similar masses (Neptune-like), so M_planet is the same for both. So K is proportional to (M_planet / M_star)^(1/3) * (1 / (P * sqrt(a)) )) or something like that. Wait, maybe another approach.

Wait, the formula I recall is K = ( (G * (M_planet) ) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (P/(2π))^(1/3) )) ) / (c * sqrt(1 - e²)) ), but for circular orbits (e=0), it simplifies a bit. Since both planets have circular orbits, e=0, so the denominator becomes 1. Also, M_planet is much less than M_star, so M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star. So K ≈ ( (G * M_planet ) / ( M_star^(1/3) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (P/(2π))^(1/3) )) ) / c. 

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to use the approximation formula. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = ( (2π G) / (c * P) )^(1/3) * (M_planet sin i) / (M_star^(2/3)) )

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. Maybe I should think in terms of the relationship between K and the orbital period P.

Wait, I remember that Kepler's third law relates the orbital period P to the semi-major axis a and the mass of the star. The formula is P² = (4π²/G M_star) * a³.

So, Kepler's third law: P² = (4π² a³) / (G M_star)

But since both stars have the same mass and the planets have similar masses, which are much smaller than the stars, the M_star is the same for both. So, for each planet, P² is proportional to a³.

But how does this relate to the RV semi-amplitude K?

The RV semi-amplitude formula is K = (v) = ( (G * M_planet) / ( (M_star + M_planet) ) )^(1/3) ) * ( (2π) / (P * c) )^(1/3) ) * ( sin i )

But since M_planet << M_star, M_star + M_planet ≈ M_star, so this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (G * M_planet) / M_star )^(1/3) * (2π/(P c))^(1/3) ) * sin i

Assuming sin i is the same for both planets (like sin i = 1, edge-on orbits), which is a reasonable assumption for maximum signal.

So, rearranging, K is proportional to ( (M_planet) / M_star )^(1/3) * (2π/(P c))^(1/3)

But since both planets have the same M_planet and same M_star, the (M_planet/M_star) term is the same for both. So K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3).

So K ∝ 1 / (P)^(1/3)

Which implies that P ∝ 1 / (K)^(3)

So if K1 is 5 milliangstroms and K2 is 7 milliangstroms, then the ratio of their periods would be P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)^3.

Because P is inversely proportional to K^(3). Since K1 < K2, P2 would be larger than P1.

Wait, let me clarify: since K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), then P is proportional to (1/K)^(3). So if K2 is larger than K1, then P2 is smaller than P1? Wait, that can't be right because if the RV shift is larger, that suggests a higher velocity, which would imply a shorter period. Let me think again.

Wait, when the RV semi-amplitude K is larger, that means the star is moving faster in its orbit. A higher velocity could be due to a more massive planet or a shorter period. Because for the same planet mass, if the period is shorter, the star has to orbit more quickly, leading to a larger K.

So yes, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so if K increases, P decreases.

So, the ratio of the periods would be (K1 / K2)^3.

So P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)^3.

Because P is proportional to (1/K)^(3), so P2 = (K1^3 / K2^3) * P1.

Wait, let me write it correctly. Let's say P1 = C / (K1^3), and P2 = C / (K2^3), where C is a constant. So P2 / P1 = (K1^3) / (K2^3) = (K1/K2)^3.

So, given K1 =5, K2=7, then P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.7143)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.364 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter. Wait, but that's not matching with the previous thought. Wait, no: wait, K2 is larger than K1. So K2 is 7, which is higher than K1=5. So according to the formula, P2 = (5/7)^3 * P1. So P2 is smaller than P1. That would mean planet #2 has a shorter orbital period.

But the question is asking, how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than planet #1? Wait, no: the question says, "How many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?" So P2 is longer if the ratio is greater than 1. But according to our calculation, the ratio is approximately 0.364, so P2 is shorter than P1.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the proportionality.

Let me go back. The relation from K and P: K is proportional to (M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3)) ), assuming other factors are same.

So K = (M_p)^(1/3) * (1/P^(1/3)) * some constants.

So K is proportional to (1/P^(1/3)), so P is proportional to (1/K^3).

So if K increases, P decreases.

So for planet #1, K1=5, planet #2, K2=7.

So P1 = C / (K1^3) = C/(5^3) = C/125.

P2 = C/(7^3) = C/343.

So P2 = (125/343) * P1.

125/343 is approximately 0.364. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's.

Wait, but the question asks how many times longer is P2 than P1. So P2 is 0.364 times P1, meaning it's shorter, not longer. So that would mean that P2 is shorter, so the answer would be approximately 0.36 times as long. But the options have option A as ~0.36, but the question is phrased as how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if P2 is 0.36 times P1, that means P2 is roughly 0.36 times as long as P1. So the orbital period of P2 is 0.36 times that of P1; so it's shorter.

Wait, but the question is, "how many times is the orbital period of planet #2 longer than that of planet #1?"

So if P2 is 0.364 times P1, then it's shorter, so the period is 0.364 times, which is not longer. So the answer would be approximately 0.36 times, but that would be how many times shorter, but the question is about how many times longer. So the period of planet #2 is shorter, so the ratio is less than 1. So the correct answer is 0.36, but that's option A. But wait, let me make sure I did the math right.

Wait, the ratio P2/P1 is (5/7)^3 = (5^3)/(7^3) = 125/343.

What's that approximately? 125 ÷ 343. Let's compute:

343 ÷ 125 is about 2.744. So 125 ÷343 is 1/2.744 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So it's about 0.36 times as long as P1. So the orbital period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1, meaning it's shorter.

But the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1. So if you're asked how many times longer, and the ratio is less than 1, that would mean it's shorter, so the number of times longer is 0.36 times. So the answer is 0.36 times. So option A is ~0.36.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check the setup.

If K is larger, period is smaller. So higher K → shorter period. So Planet#2 has a larger K (7) than Planet#1 (5). So P2 is shorter than P1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1. So we're being asked for P2/P1. Which is 125/343 ≈ 0.364. So P2 is 0.364 times P1. So it's shorter. So the answer is 0.36 times, so the period of P2 is 0.36 times P1, meaning it's shorter. So the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1. The answer is approximately 0.36 times longer, which is the same as being shorter. So the answer is option A.

Wait, but I'm getting a little stuck. Let me try a different approach. Let me imagine some numbers.

Suppose K1 is 5 and K2 is 7.

Since P is inversely proportional to K^3, P1 is proportional to 1/(5^3) = 1/125.

P2 is proportional to 1/(7^3) = 1/343.

So P2 = (125/343) P1 = approx 0.364 P1.

So P2 is about 0.36 times P1. So the period of planet #2 is 0.36 times that of planet #1. So the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1? So 0.364 times, which is shorter, so the answer is 0.36 times, meaning it's shorter. But the options have A as ~0.36, which is the right number.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining how many times the orbital period of planet #2 is longer than that of planet #1, given their respective radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitudes, \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \). Both planets orbit stars with the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar masses to Neptune. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) by the formula:

\[
K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
P \propto \frac{1}{K^3}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the orbital periods \( P_2 / P_1 \) is given by:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{K_1}{K_2} \right)^3
\]

Substituting \( K_1 = 5 \) and \( K_2 = 7 \):

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \left( \frac{5}{7} \right)^3 = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364
\]

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1, indicating that planet #2 has a shorter orbital period. However, the question asks how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1. Since the ratio \( P_2 / P_1 \) is less than 1, this confirms that planet #2's period is shorter. The closest option to the calculated ratio is:

**A) ~0.36**

Assuming sin i is the same for both planets (like sin i = 1, edge-on orbits), which is a reasonable assumption for maximum signal.

So, rearranging, K is proportional to ( (M_planet) / M_star )^(1/3) * (2π/(P c))^(1/3)

But since both planets have the same M_planet and same M_star, the (M_planet/M_star) term is the same for both. So K is inversely proportional to (P)^(1/3).

So K ∝ 1 / (P)^(1/3)

Which implies that P ∝ 1 / (K)^(3)

So if K1 is 5 milliangstroms and K2 is 7 milliangstroms, then the ratio of their periods would be P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)^3.

Because P is inversely proportional to K^(3). Since K1 < K2, P2 would be larger than P1.

So yes, K is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so if K increases, P decreases.

So, the ratio of the periods would be (K1 / K2)^3.

So P2 / P1 = (K1 / K2)^3.

Because P is proportional to (1/K)^(3), so P2 = (K1^3 / K2^3) * P1.

Wait, let me write it correctly. Let's say P1 = C / (K1^3), and P2 = C / (K2^3), where C is a constant. So P2 / P1 = (K1^3) / (K2^3) = (K1/K2)^3.

So, given K1 =5, K2=7, then P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ (0.7143)^3 ≈ 0.364.

So P1 = C / (K1^3) = C/(5^3) = C/125.

P2 = C/(7^3) = C/343.

So P2 = (125/343) * P1.

125/343 is approximately 0.364. So P2 is about 0.364 times P1. So planet #2's period is shorter than planet #1's.

Thus, the ratio of the orbital periods \( P_2 / P_1 \) is given by:

This means the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately 0.36 times that of planet #1, indicating that planet #2 has a shorter orbital period.
