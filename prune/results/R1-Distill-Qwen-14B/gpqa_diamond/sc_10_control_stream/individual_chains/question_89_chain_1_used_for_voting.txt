Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm^-1. 

Hmm, 1720 cm^-1 in IR is usually a carbonyl group. So maybe product 1 is an epoxide or a ketone. Wait, but if it's from dibromoadamantane and KOH, that's probably an elimination reaction. Because KOH is a strong base, and heating with excess would likely lead to dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons? No, wait, adamantane is a cage structure, so positions 1 and 3 might be on different parts. But when KOH is used on a dibromo compound, it usually leads to an elimination, forming a double bond. But since it's a dihalide, maybe it forms an epoxide? Wait, but that would require something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an E2 elimination, forming a cycloalkene or something else.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720, which is more in line with a carbonyl group. So perhaps it's forming a ketone? How? Oh wait, maybe the two bromides are on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a double bond, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but that would have an ether peak. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but that doesn't involve carbonyl.

Wait another thought: if you have two vicinal bromides (like Br on adjacent carbons), KOH could lead to elimination forming a double bond. But how does that give a carbonyl? Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more like a substitution but that would not form a carbonyl either.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation twice? Like, two E2 eliminations, removing two HBr molecules and forming a triple bond. But wait, can a triple bond form in adamantane? I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe it's forming an epoxide, but that's more when you have a diol, not sure.

Wait, the IR indicates a carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Oh wait, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization? No, that's for esters. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution leading to a carbonyl. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: what's the structure after KOH? The NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm, which is about δ4.8. That's usually indicative of an ether or an epoxide, but wait, maybe it's an alcohol? No, because the IR has a carbonyl. Wait, 4.79 for 2H, maybe an OCH2 group? Or perhaps a carbonyl adjacent to an oxygen, like an ester? Or maybe a ketone and adjacent oxygen.

Wait, let me think about the reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Maybe it's a double elimination, forming a ketone. How? So, if the structure is Br-C-C-Br and upon elimination, it becomes C-O-C or a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a peroxide formation. Wait, but KOH is more of a base than a source of oxygen. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where each Br is replaced by hydroxide, but that would give a diol. But then, where's the carbonyl?

Wait another thought: Maybe the reaction is forming an epoxide. Because for epoxide formation, you can have a dihalide react with a base. Oh wait, yes, vicinal dihalides can form epoxides when treated with a base. For example, 1,2-dibromoethane with a base would form ethylene oxide (epoxide). So perhaps in this case, the same happens. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would form an epoxide? But wait, 1,3-dibromo is not vicinal. Vicinal is 1,2. So maybe it's not the case.

Wait, but adamantane is a rigid structure. The 1 and 3 positions are not adjacent, so maybe the elimination forms a bridgehead double bond? Hmm, but I'm not very sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. Oh wait, if both Br atoms are on bridgehead carbons, and elimination occurs, maybe each Br is replaced by a ketone group. Wait, but two eliminations would require two E2 steps. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is in a position where elimination would form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about the NMR of product 1. The peaks are:

4.79 ppm (2H), maybe an OCH2 group.

2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), probably some geminal or adjacent protons, maybe in a ring structure.

1.94 ppm (2H), perhaps some vinyl protons, but I'm not sure.

The IR at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl. So the product is likely an epoxide? No, because epoxide's carbonyl isn't that high. Wait, an epoxide O is around 1200s, maybe. Or maybe a ketone. The peak at 1720 is a strong carbonyl, like a ketone.

So considering that, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two HBr molecules, forming a conjugated diene. But that wouldn't give a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an oxygen, but that would require more than KOH.

Wait, another possibility: It's a ring-opening of an epoxide. But no, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, not an epoxide.

Wait, maybe the product is a diepoxide? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, but with something else. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is acting as a base and leading to a conjugate addition. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, thinking about the IR and NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H). Maybe it's an ethylene glycol type structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH? Perhaps the bromide leaves, and a carbonyl forms through some mechanism.

Wait, maybe it's a Fries rearrangement? No, that's for aryl esters.

Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydration of a diol. But then, the initial product would be a diol, which would then lose water. But the starting material is a dibromide. Wait, perhaps the KOH could deprotonate and eliminate, forming a carbonyl.

Wait, another angle: Suppose that each Br is on a different carbon, and when KOH is added, each Br undergoes elimination. So perhaps each Br leaves, and the adjacent H is abstracted by OH- (or another base), leading to a double bond. But two eliminations would require two double bonds, but that's not possible in adamantane, which is a rigid structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, and elimination forms a double bond. But then, how to get a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe it's a Claisen-like elimination. Wait, let me get back to the problem.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone, so 1,3-diketone adamantane.

But how? Maybe the Br groups are in positions that upon elimination, the carbonyl groups form.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Wait, but that's not a typical reaction. Usually, elimination forms alkenes.

Wait, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead. When KOH is added, each Br leaves, and the base abstracts a proton, leading to formation of a double bond between those two bridgehead carbons. But that would be a bridgehead double bond, which is not allowed due to Bredt's rule. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH might form an epoxide if it's a vicinal dihalide, but 1,3 isn't vicinal. So that's unlikely.

Wait, but adamantane's structure is a diamondoid, so 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgeheads. Maybe the structure allows for a 5-membered ring formation when the two Brs are removed, and oxygen is inserted.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Dieckmann cyclization, but that requires an ester. I don't see how that applies here.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. So when each Br is replaced by a ketone. How? Each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another Br, so elimination of HBr twice, forming two ketone groups. That would fit with the IR peak at 1720, which is for a ketone.

So product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone, a diketone. Let's consider that.

Then, product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, but adamantane is a saturated structure, so if it's a diketone, perhaps it's undergoing some cycloaddition or another reaction.

Wait, or maybe it's a ring-opening or some rearrangement. Another possibility is that the diketone is undergoing a Dieckmann condensation, but that would form a cyclic ester, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the aluminum isopropoxide is acting as a catalyst for some kind of enol ether formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the diketone is undergoing a pinacol-like rearrangement, but that requires vicinal diols, not diketones.

Wait, another idea: The diketone, upon heating, could undergo a ring-opening or some cyclization. But I'm not sure.

Wait, aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid, maybe to induce Friedel-Crafts. But adamantane is already a fully saturated structure, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't apply. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the diketone is undergoing a nucleophilic attack or some kind of alkylation. But without a source of an electrophilic alkyl group, maybe it's not.

Wait, aluminum isopropoxide can also be used in the formation of enol ethers or in other ether-forming reactions. Maybe the diketone is reacting to form an enol ether. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the diketone is reacting with itself, undergoing a condensation reaction. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the product 2 is an enol ether. So product 1 is the diketone, and upon reaction with aluminum isopropoxide, maybe it's forming an enol ether.

Wait, but how would that happen? Enol ethers are formed from ketones through the conjugate addition of alcohols, but I'm not sure about the exact mechanism here.

Alternatively, perhaps the Lewis acid is causing the formation of some kind of acylium ion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Because the IR at 1720 might not be a carbonyl but an epoxide's C-O stretching. Wait, but epoxide's C-O is around 1200-1300 cm^-1, I think, so 1720 is more likely a carbonyl. So probably not an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the next step. So product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, then dimethyl sulfide is added to give product 3.

Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. But if product 2 doesn't have a double bond, maybe it's not ozonolysis. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has an epoxide, which when ozonolyzed would do something else. Or maybe product 2 has a conjugated diene.

Wait, but ozone is used for cleaving alkenes. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So if product 2 has a double bond, then product 1 must have reacted in a way to form a double bond in product 2. So product 1 is 1,3-diketone. When product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes a cyclization or elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, maybe product 1 is 1,3-diketone, and then when treated with a Lewis acid, it undergoes a ring-opening to form an enone (conjugated enol ether or something). Or perhaps it forms an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

If product 2 has a conjugated dienone or an enone, then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond.

Wait, let me think again. So product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, when heated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement occurs, like a Cope rearrangement. But the Cope rearrangement requires 1,5-dienes, which I don't think is present here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is undergoing a Claisen rearrangement, but that requires an allyl vinyl ether, which I don't see here.

Alternatively, maybe the diketone is forming an enol ether, which would then have a double bond. So product 2 would have a double bond, making it reactable with ozone.

So, product 2 is an enol ether with a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that double bond.

Wait, but ozonolysis at low temperatures (like -78°C) usually gives different products. For example, ozonolysis followed by reductive work-up (like with dimethyl sulfide) typically gives aldehydes and ketones.

So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. But since product 3 is formed after ozonolysis and DMS addition, its NMR would show the new protons from the cleavage.

But what is being asked is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in product 3's NMR. The options are various splitting patterns.

Wait, let's try to reconstruct the possible structures step by step.

1) 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid). IR shows 1720 cm-1 (carbonyl), NMR shows 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H).

Assuming product 1 is a diketone, like 1,3-adamantanone.

2) Product 1 heated with excess Al isopropoxide → product 2.

Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid. Common reactions include Friedel-Crafts, but since adamantane is saturated, perhaps it's involved in some kind of acylation. Alternatively, it could be facilitating the formation of an enol ether.

Wait, but how can a diketone form an enol ether? Enol ethers are typically formed from alcohols and ketones under acidic conditions. Maybe the Lewis acid is helping to form an enol from the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the diketone is undergoing some kind of cyclization. Suppose product 2 is an enol ether with a double bond, perhaps part of a ring.

Wait, perhaps product 1 (diketone) is undergoing a [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, like a Cope rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the diketone is forming an enol, which then forms an enol ether with isopropoxide groups. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the aluminum isopropoxide is acting as a base, deprotonating the diketone to form an enolate, which then undergoes some reaction. But what?

Wait, maybe the enolate attacks another ketone group, leading to a ring formation. But in adamantane, the structure is rigid, so forming a new ring might not be feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an annulene or some bridged structure with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a diene. Then, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

But without knowing the exact structure of product 2, it's hard to proceed. Let me think about the ozonolysis part.

When product 2 is ozonolyzed, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. Then, upon work-up with dimethyl sulfide (a reductive work-up), it gives aldehydes or ketones, depending on the substitution of the double bond.

In product 3's NMR, the most deshielded proton would likely be adjacent to the carbonyl groups, perhaps in a CH2 group or a CH group.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of that proton.

Let me think about what kind of splitting would occur. The most deshielded proton is probably near the carbonyl, maybe in a CH2 adjacent to two carbonyls.

Wait, if the ozonolysis breaks a double bond into two carbonyls, then the resulting structure would have two carbonyl groups adjacent to the previously double-bonded carbons.

For example, if the double bond was between C1 and C2, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls, making C1 and C2 each have a carbonyl group. Then, the adjacent CH groups (if any) would have protons that are split based on neighboring protons.

But the exact splitting depends on the neighboring H's.

Wait, let's imagine product 2 has a double bond between two CH2 groups. Upon ozonolysis, each CH2 would be adjacent to a carbonyl. So the CH2 groups would have protons that are possibly split by adjacent groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the protons are in a trans configuration, leading to coupling with two neighboring protons each.

Wait, but the most deshielded proton would be the one closest to the carbonyl, perhaps a methylene (CH2) group next to two carbonyls.

But to get the coupling pattern, I need to think about the neighboring H's.

Assume that the most deshielded H is in a CH2 group next to two carbonyl groups. Let's say, structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. But that's just a simple example.

Wait, but in the NMR of product 3, the peaks would reflect the protons adjacent to carbonyls. The splitting depends on how many neighboring non-equivalent protons each H is coupled with.

Let's say the H is in a CH2 group next to two other CH2 groups. Each H in the CH2 would couple with the H's in adjacent groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is something like a diketone with adjacent CH2 groups. So each CH2's H would be coupled with the H's on the neighboring CH2.

For example, if you have a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2's H would be next to the other CH2. So each H on CH2 would have two neighboring H's on each adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but each CH2 has two H's, and each H would be coupled with the two H's on the adjacent CH2 group. So each H would have two neighboring H's, leading to a triplet. But wait, each H is coupled with two H's, each of which is a doublet. So the splitting would be a triplet.

Wait, but if each H is coupled with two equivalent H's, that would be a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be triplet.

But wait, the options include a triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, and pentet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more complex. Suppose the CH2 is next to a CH group. For example, O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-C=O. Then, the protons on the CH2 would be adjacent to the CH group, which has a single H. So each H on CH2 would couple with that single H on the CH. That would be a doublet. But if the CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2, then each H would have coupling with both the CH and the other CH2's H's.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that each H on the most deshielded CH2 is coupling with two different sets of H's. For example, each CH2 H is coupled with two H's from one side and two from another, but maybe the coupling constants are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is between two CH groups. Then each H on the CH2 would be coupled with two H's on one side and two on the other, but if each has a different coupling constant, the splitting would be more complex.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible options.

Option A: triplet.

Option B: triplet of triplets.

Option C: doublet of triplets.

Option D: pentet.

If the H is between two CH2 groups, each with two H's, then each H would have two neighboring H's on each side. Wait, but each H is on a CH2, so each H would see the two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have four neighboring H's in total, but because they're split into two groups, each with two H's. So the splitting would be a triplet of triplets? Or a quartet?

Wait, no. Let me think of it as each H being split by two neighboring sets of two H's. Let me model it.

Each H in the central CH2 is next to two H's on the left and two on the right. But wait, each H in the central CH2 is next to two H's on each adjacent CH2. So each H in the central CH2 would be split by four H's, but perhaps they are equivalent.

Wait, if the two adjacent CH2 groups are identical, then each H in the central CH2 is coupled with four H's, but since the two groups are equivalent, the splitting might be a triplet. Wait, but four neighboring H's would lead to a quintet (n+1 rule for n=4 → 5 peaks). But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is with two different groups. For example, each H is coupled with two H's from one direction and two from another, but with different coupling constants. Then the splitting would be more complex, like a triplet of triplets.

Wait, if a proton is coupled with two different sets of two protons each, with different J values, then the splitting would be a triplet for each coupling, and the combination would be a triplet of triplets, leading to nine peaks in total.

Alternatively, if each coupling is with one proton and another, but with different J's, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets, but that's not an option. The options include a triplet of triplets (option B), a doublet of triplets (option C), and a pentet (option D).

Alternatively, perhaps the H is adjacent to two different types of protons, each with two H's, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about a simpler scenario. If each H is coupled with two neighboring H's of the same type, the splitting would be a triplet.

Wait, but in the case of two adjacent CH2 groups, each H in the central CH2 is next to two H's on each side (left and right). So each H has four neighboring H's. But if all four are equivalent, the splitting would be a quintet (n=4 → 5 peaks). But that's option D, a pentet.

Wait, but perhaps the two H's on each adjacent CH2 are not equivalent. So each H is coupled with two H's from one CH2 and two from another, but with the same J. Then the splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is with two H's on one side and one on the other, but that might not fit.

Wait, another approach: Considering the NMR data for product 1.

The NMR of product 1 has 2H at 4.79 ppm, which is upfield for a carbonyl group. Maybe it's an OCH2 group. Then, 10H between 2.41-2.23 ppm, which are probably in a ring structure, and 2H at 1.94 ppm, perhaps in a more shielded environment.

If product 1 is an epoxide, the 4.79 ppm would correspond to the OCH2 group. But earlier I thought the IR might not fit, but maybe the IR is wrong? Wait, no, the IR at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl. So it's more likely a ketone.

Wait, maybe the product 1 has an ester group. Esters have carbonyl peaks around 1720. So perhaps product 1 is an ester.

Wait, but how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane react with KOH to form an ester?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether with a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction forms an epoxide, which then undergoes some ring-opening to form a ketone. But that seems a bit convoluted.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a glycol, but again, the IR doesn't fit.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about product 3's NMR.

Product 3 is formed after ozonolysis of product 2, which likely has a double bond. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

The H in question is the most deshielded, which would be near the carbonyl. So perhaps it's in a CH2 group adjacent to two carbonyl groups.

In such a structure, each H in the CH2 would be adjacent to carbonyl groups and perhaps other H's. So for example, the structure could be O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O.

If that's the case, each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, so each H is next to two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H would couple with two H's, leading to a triplet.

But wait, each H in the CH2 is also next to another CH2 group. So each H would have two neighboring H's on each side. So each H is coupled with two H's on the left and two on the right.

If the coupling constants are the same, each H would be split into a triplet from each side, leading to a triplet of triplets. But if the coupling constants are different, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is only with two H's, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if the H's are in a symmetrical environment, perhaps the splitting would simplify. For example, in O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, the two CH2 groups are identical, so each H in the middle would have four equivalent H's around. But that's not the case because each CH2 is attached to a carbonyl and another CH2. So each H would have two H's on each adjacent CH2, which are equivalent. So each H is coupled with two H's on one side and two on the other.

Wait, but for splitting, each coupling is considered separately. So each H is coupled with two H's on the left and two on the right. Since the left and right couplings are separate, the splitting would be a triplet for each, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So each H would be a triplet due to the left coupling, and each of those would be split again into triplets by the right coupling, leading to a total of 3x3=9 peaks, but in practice, it might be observed as a triplet of triplets.

But looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets. So that's a possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two H's on one side and one on the other, leading to a doublet of triplets. But that doesn't fit as well.

Wait, perhaps the structure isn't symmetric. Suppose product 2 has a double bond in a position where ozonolysis creates two different carbonyl groups. So one end is a ketone and the other is an aldehyde. Then, the H's adjacent to the carbonyl would be in different environments.

For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, the CH2 next to the ketone would have two H's adjacent, and the CH2 next to the aldehyde would have two H's adjacent. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, but in any case, the most deshielded H would be next to a carbonyl group. If it's in a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, then each H in the CH2 would be split by the H's in the adjacent CH2.

In a simple case, each H is coupled with two H's, leading to a triplet.

But considering the options, I'm seeing triplet as an option (A). So maybe the coupling is a triplet.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled with three other H's, it would be a quartet, but that's not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH group adjacent to a CH2. Then, each H would couple with two H's from the CH2, leading to a triplet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: after ozonolysis, the product would have carbonyl groups. The H's adjacent to these would likely be in a CH2 group. Let's say, a structure like O=C-CH2-CO-..., but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to two carbonyl groups. So each H in that CH2 is next to two H's on each side. If each H is coupled with two H's on each adjacent group, then each H would have four neighboring H's, leading to a quintet (n=4 → 5 peaks). So that would be a pentet, option D.

But earlier I thought that would be the case if the H's are all equivalent, but maybe they are not.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's are in a propenyl group or something else.

Wait, maybe I should think about the initial product 1.

If product 1 is 1,3-diketone, then product 2 could be an enol ether.

Wait, another thought: The aluminum isopropoxide could be causing the formation of an enol from the ketone. So perhaps each ketone group is converted into an enol, forming a conjugated diene.

Wait, but how? Maybe product 1 is 1,3-diketone, and upon treatment with Al isopropoxide, it forms an enol, leading to a conjugated dienone (like a 1,3-diene with ketones at the ends).

Then, product 2 would have a conjugated diene. Ozonolysis of a conjugated diene at low temperature would give two carbonyl groups. But wait, ozonolysis of a conjugated diene typically gives a diepoxide, but at lower temperatures, it can give different products.

Wait, actually, ozonolysis of a conjugated diene (like 1,3-pentadiene) would give two aldehyde groups. So in product 3, each of the former double bond ends would have a carbonyl group.

So, the structure after ozonolysis might be two carbonyl groups connected by a chain. The NMR would show the H's adjacent to those carbonyls.

The most deshielded H would be in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Each H would be coupled with two H's from the adjacent CH2 group. So each H would be a triplet.

That would make option A (triplet) the correct answer.

But wait, if the CH2 is next to another CH2, each H in the first CH2 would be coupled with two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H would split into a triplet, leading to a triplet coupling pattern.

So the answer would be triplet, option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH.  
   - The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group.  
   - The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41–2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a diketone structure, likely 1,3-adamantanone.

2. **Reaction with Al isopropoxide**:  
   - Product 1 (1,3-adamantanone) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide.  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide, a strong Lewis acid, facilitates the formation of an enol ether or a related structure with a double bond.  
   - Product 2 likely contains a conjugated diene or enol ether structure, setting it up for ozonolysis.

3. **Ozonolysis and Work-Up**:  
   - Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, converting them into carbonyl groups.  
   - Product 3 is formed, and the most deshielded hydrogen in its NMR corresponds to a proton adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Analysis of Coupling Pattern**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely part of a CH₂ group adjacent to two carbonyl groups.  
   - Each hydrogen in this CH₂ group is coupled with two hydrogens from an adjacent CH₂ group.  
   - This results in a triplet coupling pattern due to the splitting caused by the two neighboring hydrogens.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The problem starts with 1,3-dibromoadamantane being heated with excess KOH. The product is a light yellow solid, product 1. The 1H NMR of product 1 shows peaks at 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H). The IR has a characteristic absorbance at 1720 cm^-1. 

Hmm, 1720 cm^-1 in IR is usually a carbonyl group. So maybe product 1 is an epoxide or a ketone. Wait, but if it's from dibromoadamantane and KOH, that's probably an elimination reaction. Because KOH is a strong base, and heating with excess would likely lead to dehydrohalogenation.

Wait, 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Adamantane is a diamondoid structure, so 1,3-dibromo would have two Br atoms on adjacent carbons? No, wait, adamantane is a cage structure, so positions 1 and 3 might be on different parts. But when KOH is used on a dibromo compound, it usually leads to an elimination, forming a double bond. But since it's a dihalide, maybe it forms an epoxide? Wait, but that would require something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an E2 elimination, forming a cycloalkene or something else.

Wait, but the IR has a peak at 1720, which is more in line with a carbonyl group. So perhaps it's forming a ketone? How? Oh wait, maybe the two bromides are on adjacent carbons, so elimination would form a double bond, but that doesn't explain the carbonyl. Alternatively, maybe it's an epoxide, but that would have an ether peak. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene, but that doesn't involve carbonyl.

Wait another thought: if you have two vicinal bromides (like Br on adjacent carbons), KOH could lead to elimination forming a double bond. But how does that give a carbonyl? Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more like a substitution but that would not form a carbonyl either.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation twice? Like, two E2 eliminations, removing two HBr molecules and forming a triple bond. But wait, can a triple bond form in adamantane? I'm not too sure. Alternatively, maybe it's forming an epoxide, but that's more when you have a diol, not sure.

Wait, the IR indicates a carbonyl. So maybe it's a ketone. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane? Oh wait, maybe it's a Dieckmann cyclization? No, that's for esters. Alternatively, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution leading to a carbonyl. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another angle: what's the structure after KOH? The NMR of product 1 shows a peak at 4.79 ppm, which is about δ4.8. That's usually indicative of an ether or an epoxide, but wait, maybe it's an alcohol? No, because the IR has a carbonyl. Wait, 4.79 for 2H, maybe an OCH2 group? Or perhaps a carbonyl adjacent to an oxygen, like an ester? Or maybe a ketone and adjacent oxygen.

Wait, let me think about the reaction. 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH. Maybe it's a double elimination, forming a ketone. How? So, if the structure is Br-C-C-Br and upon elimination, it becomes C-O-C or a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a peroxide formation. Wait, but KOH is more of a base than a source of oxygen. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution where each Br is replaced by hydroxide, but that would give a diol. But then, where's the carbonyl?

Wait another thought: Maybe the reaction is forming an epoxide. Because for epoxide formation, you can have a dihalide react with a base. Oh wait, yes, vicinal dihalides can form epoxides when treated with a base. For example, 1,2-dibromoethane with a base would form ethylene oxide (epoxide). So perhaps in this case, the same happens. So 1,3-dibromoadamantane would form an epoxide? But wait, 1,3-dibromo is not vicinal. Vicinal is 1,2. So maybe it's not the case.

Wait, but adamantane is a rigid structure. The 1 and 3 positions are not adjacent, so maybe the elimination forms a bridgehead double bond? Hmm, but I'm not very sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a diketone. Oh wait, if both Br atoms are on bridgehead carbons, and elimination occurs, maybe each Br is replaced by a ketone group. Wait, but two eliminations would require two E2 steps. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is in a position where elimination would form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think about the NMR of product 1. The peaks are:

4.79 ppm (2H), maybe an OCH2 group.

2.41-2.23 ppm (10H), probably some geminal or adjacent protons, maybe in a ring structure.

1.94 ppm (2H), perhaps some vinyl protons, but I'm not sure.

The IR at 1720 cm^-1 suggests a carbonyl. So the product is likely an epoxide? No, because epoxide's carbonyl isn't that high. Wait, an epoxide O is around 1200s, maybe. Or maybe a ketone. The peak at 1720 is a strong carbonyl, like a ketone.

So considering that, perhaps the reaction is a double elimination. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane would eliminate two HBr molecules, forming a conjugated diene. But that wouldn't give a carbonyl. Alternatively, perhaps each Br is replaced by an oxygen, but that would require more than KOH.

Wait, another possibility: It's a ring-opening of an epoxide. But no, the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, not an epoxide.

Wait, maybe the product is a diepoxide? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution, but with something else. Alternatively, maybe the KOH is acting as a base and leading to a conjugate addition. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, thinking about the IR and NMR: 4.79 ppm (2H). Maybe it's an ethylene glycol type structure, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the product is a diol. But then, the IR wouldn't show a carbonyl. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the product is a ketone. How would that form from 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH? Perhaps the bromide leaves, and a carbonyl forms through some mechanism.

Wait, maybe it's a Fries rearrangement? No, that's for aryl esters.

Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydration of a diol. But then, the initial product would be a diol, which would then lose water. But the starting material is a dibromide. Wait, perhaps the KOH could deprotonate and eliminate, forming a carbonyl.

Wait, another angle: Suppose that each Br is on a different carbon, and when KOH is added, each Br undergoes elimination. So perhaps each Br leaves, and the adjacent H is abstracted by OH- (or another base), leading to a double bond. But two eliminations would require two double bonds, but that's not possible in adamantane, which is a rigid structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the two Brs are on adjacent carbons, and elimination forms a double bond. But then, how to get a carbonyl?

Wait, maybe it's a Claisen-like elimination. Wait, let me get back to the problem.

Wait, perhaps the product is a ketone, so 1,3-diketone adamantane.

But how? Maybe the Br groups are in positions that upon elimination, the carbonyl groups form.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a ketone. Wait, but that's not a typical reaction. Usually, elimination forms alkenes.

Wait, if the starting material is 1,3-dibromoadamantane, perhaps each Br is on a bridgehead. When KOH is added, each Br leaves, and the base abstracts a proton, leading to formation of a double bond between those two bridgehead carbons. But that would be a bridgehead double bond, which is not allowed due to Bredt's rule. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps the product is an epoxide. Let me think: 1,3-dibromoadamantane with KOH might form an epoxide if it's a vicinal dihalide, but 1,3 isn't vicinal. So that's unlikely.

Wait, but adamantane's structure is a diamondoid, so 1 and 3 positions are on adjacent bridgeheads. Maybe the structure allows for a 5-membered ring formation when the two Brs are removed, and oxygen is inserted.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a Dieckmann cyclization, but that requires an ester. I don't see how that applies here.

Wait, maybe the product is a diketone. So when each Br is replaced by a ketone. How? Each Br is on a carbon adjacent to another Br, so elimination of HBr twice, forming two ketone groups. That would fit with the IR peak at 1720, which is for a ketone.

So product 1 is 1,3-adamantanone, a diketone. Let's consider that.

Then, product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, product 1 is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide, forming product 2.

Aluminum isopropoxide is a strong Lewis acid, often used in Friedel-Crafts alkylation or acylation. But wait, but adamantane is a saturated structure, so if it's a diketone, perhaps it's undergoing some cycloaddition or another reaction.

Wait, or maybe it's a ring-opening or some rearrangement. Another possibility is that the diketone is undergoing a Dieckmann condensation, but that would form a cyclic ester, but I don't think that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps the aluminum isopropoxide is acting as a catalyst for some kind of enol ether formation.

Alternatively, perhaps the diketone is undergoing a pinacol-like rearrangement, but that requires vicinal diols, not diketones.

Wait, another idea: The diketone, upon heating, could undergo a ring-opening or some cyclization. But I'm not sure.

Wait, aluminum isopropoxide is often used as a Lewis acid, maybe to induce Friedel-Crafts. But adamantane is already a fully saturated structure, so Friedel-Crafts wouldn't apply. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the diketone is undergoing a nucleophilic attack or some kind of alkylation. But without a source of an electrophilic alkyl group, maybe it's not.

Wait, aluminum isopropoxide can also be used in the formation of enol ethers or in other ether-forming reactions. Maybe the diketone is reacting to form an enol ether. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the diketone is reacting with itself, undergoing a condensation reaction. But I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe the product 2 is an enol ether. So product 1 is the diketone, and upon reaction with aluminum isopropoxide, maybe it's forming an enol ether.

Wait, but how would that happen? Enol ethers are formed from ketones through the conjugate addition of alcohols, but I'm not sure about the exact mechanism here.

Alternatively, perhaps the Lewis acid is causing the formation of some kind of acylium ion, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Maybe product 1 is an epoxide. Because the IR at 1720 might not be a carbonyl but an epoxide's C-O stretching. Wait, but epoxide's C-O is around 1200-1300 cm^-1, I think, so 1720 is more likely a carbonyl. So probably not an epoxide.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the next step. So product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, then dimethyl sulfide is added to give product 3.

Ozone is used for ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. But if product 2 doesn't have a double bond, maybe it's not ozonolysis. Alternatively, perhaps product 2 has an epoxide, which when ozonolyzed would do something else. Or maybe product 2 has a conjugated diene.

Wait, but ozone is used for cleaving alkenes. So product 2 must have a double bond.

So if product 2 has a double bond, then product 1 must have reacted in a way to form a double bond in product 2. So product 1 is 1,3-diketone. When product 1 is heated with aluminum isopropoxide, perhaps it undergoes a cyclization or elimination to form a double bond.

Wait, maybe product 1 is 1,3-diketone, and then when treated with a Lewis acid, it undergoes a ring-opening to form an enone (conjugated enol ether or something). Or perhaps it forms an alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone.

If product 2 has a conjugated dienone or an enone, then ozonolysis would cleave the double bond.

Wait, let me think again. So product 1 is 1,3-diketone adamantane. Then, when heated with Al isopropoxide, perhaps a [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement occurs, like a Cope rearrangement. But the Cope rearrangement requires 1,5-dienes, which I don't think is present here.

Alternatively, perhaps product 1 is undergoing a Claisen rearrangement, but that requires an allyl vinyl ether, which I don't see here.

Alternatively, maybe the diketone is forming an enol ether, which would then have a double bond. So product 2 would have a double bond, making it reactable with ozone.

So, product 2 is an enol ether with a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would cleave that double bond.

Wait, but ozonolysis at low temperatures (like -78°C) usually gives different products. For example, ozonolysis followed by reductive work-up (like with dimethyl sulfide) typically gives aldehydes and ketones.

So if product 2 has a double bond, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. But since product 3 is formed after ozonolysis and DMS addition, its NMR would show the new protons from the cleavage.

But what is being asked is the coupling pattern of the most deshielded proton in product 3's NMR. The options are various splitting patterns.

Wait, let's try to reconstruct the possible structures step by step.

1) 1,3-dibromoadamantane heated with KOH → product 1 (light yellow solid). IR shows 1720 cm-1 (carbonyl), NMR shows 4.79 (2H), 2.41-2.23 (10H), 1.94 (2H).

Assuming product 1 is a diketone, like 1,3-adamantanone.

2) Product 1 heated with excess Al isopropoxide → product 2.

Al isopropoxide is a Lewis acid. Common reactions include Friedel-Crafts, but since adamantane is saturated, perhaps it's involved in some kind of acylation. Alternatively, it could be facilitating the formation of an enol ether.

Wait, but how can a diketone form an enol ether? Enol ethers are typically formed from alcohols and ketones under acidic conditions. Maybe the Lewis acid is helping to form an enol from the ketone.

Alternatively, perhaps the diketone is undergoing some kind of cyclization. Suppose product 2 is an enol ether with a double bond, perhaps part of a ring.

Wait, perhaps product 1 (diketone) is undergoing a [2,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement, like a Cope rearrangement, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the diketone is forming an enol, which then forms an enol ether with isopropoxide groups. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the aluminum isopropoxide is acting as a base, deprotonating the diketone to form an enolate, which then undergoes some reaction. But what?

Wait, maybe the enolate attacks another ketone group, leading to a ring formation. But in adamantane, the structure is rigid, so forming a new ring might not be feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps product 2 is an annulene or some bridged structure with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps product 2 is a diene. Then, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls.

But without knowing the exact structure of product 2, it's hard to proceed. Let me think about the ozonolysis part.

When product 2 is ozonolyzed, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. Then, upon work-up with dimethyl sulfide (a reductive work-up), it gives aldehydes or ketones, depending on the substitution of the double bond.

In product 3's NMR, the most deshielded proton would likely be adjacent to the carbonyl groups, perhaps in a CH2 group or a CH group.

But the question is about the coupling pattern of that proton.

Let me think about what kind of splitting would occur. The most deshielded proton is probably near the carbonyl, maybe in a CH2 adjacent to two carbonyls.

Wait, if the ozonolysis breaks a double bond into two carbonyls, then the resulting structure would have two carbonyl groups adjacent to the previously double-bonded carbons.

For example, if the double bond was between C1 and C2, ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyls, making C1 and C2 each have a carbonyl group. Then, the adjacent CH groups (if any) would have protons that are split based on neighboring protons.

But the exact splitting depends on the neighboring H's.

Wait, let's imagine product 2 has a double bond between two CH2 groups. Upon ozonolysis, each CH2 would be adjacent to a carbonyl. So the CH2 groups would have protons that are possibly split by adjacent groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the protons are in a trans configuration, leading to coupling with two neighboring protons each.

Wait, but the most deshielded proton would be the one closest to the carbonyl, perhaps a methylene (CH2) group next to two carbonyls.

But to get the coupling pattern, I need to think about the neighboring H's.

Assume that the most deshielded H is in a CH2 group next to two carbonyl groups. Let's say, structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O. But that's just a simple example.

Wait, but in the NMR of product 3, the peaks would reflect the protons adjacent to carbonyls. The splitting depends on how many neighboring non-equivalent protons each H is coupled with.

Let's say the H is in a CH2 group next to two other CH2 groups. Each H in the CH2 would couple with the H's in adjacent groups.

Wait, perhaps the structure after ozonolysis is something like a diketone with adjacent CH2 groups. So each CH2's H would be coupled with the H's on the neighboring CH2.

For example, if you have a structure like O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, then each CH2's H would be next to the other CH2. So each H on CH2 would have two neighboring H's on each adjacent CH2 group.

Wait, but each CH2 has two H's, and each H would be coupled with the two H's on the adjacent CH2 group. So each H would have two neighboring H's, leading to a triplet. But wait, each H is coupled with two H's, each of which is a doublet. So the splitting would be a triplet.

Wait, but if each H is coupled with two equivalent H's, that would be a triplet. So the coupling pattern would be triplet.

But wait, the options include a triplet, triplet of triplets, doublet of triplets, and pentet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more complex. Suppose the CH2 is next to a CH group. For example, O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-C=O. Then, the protons on the CH2 would be adjacent to the CH group, which has a single H. So each H on CH2 would couple with that single H on the CH. That would be a doublet. But if the CH2 is also adjacent to another CH2, then each H would have coupling with both the CH and the other CH2's H's.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that each H on the most deshielded CH2 is coupling with two different sets of H's. For example, each CH2 H is coupled with two H's from one side and two from another, but maybe the coupling constants are different.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH2 is between two CH groups. Then each H on the CH2 would be coupled with two H's on one side and two on the other, but if each has a different coupling constant, the splitting would be more complex.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the possible options.

Option A: triplet.

Option B: triplet of triplets.

Option C: doublet of triplets.

Option D: pentet.

If the H is between two CH2 groups, each with two H's, then each H would have two neighboring H's on each side. Wait, but each H is on a CH2, so each H would see the two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H would have four neighboring H's in total, but because they're split into two groups, each with two H's. So the splitting would be a triplet of triplets? Or a quartet?

Wait, no. Let me think of it as each H being split by two neighboring sets of two H's. Let me model it.

Each H in the central CH2 is next to two H's on the left and two on the right. But wait, each H in the central CH2 is next to two H's on each adjacent CH2. So each H in the central CH2 would be split by four H's, but perhaps they are equivalent.

Wait, if the two adjacent CH2 groups are identical, then each H in the central CH2 is coupled with four H's, but since the two groups are equivalent, the splitting might be a triplet. Wait, but four neighboring H's would lead to a quintet (n+1 rule for n=4 → 5 peaks). But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is with two different groups. For example, each H is coupled with two H's from one direction and two from another, but with different coupling constants. Then the splitting would be more complex, like a triplet of triplets.

Wait, if a proton is coupled with two different sets of two protons each, with different J values, then the splitting would be a triplet for each coupling, and the combination would be a triplet of triplets, leading to nine peaks in total.

Alternatively, if each coupling is with one proton and another, but with different J's, the splitting would be a doublet of doublets, but that's not an option. The options include a triplet of triplets (option B), a doublet of triplets (option C), and a pentet (option D).

Alternatively, perhaps the H is adjacent to two different types of protons, each with two H's, leading to a triplet of triplets.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about a simpler scenario. If each H is coupled with two neighboring H's of the same type, the splitting would be a triplet.

Wait, but in the case of two adjacent CH2 groups, each H in the central CH2 is next to two H's on each side (left and right). So each H has four neighboring H's. But if all four are equivalent, the splitting would be a quintet (n=4 → 5 peaks). But that's option D, a pentet.

Wait, but perhaps the two H's on each adjacent CH2 are not equivalent. So each H is coupled with two H's from one CH2 and two from another, but with the same J. Then the splitting would be a triplet of triplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is with two H's on one side and one on the other, but that might not fit.

Wait, another approach: Considering the NMR data for product 1.

The NMR of product 1 has 2H at 4.79 ppm, which is upfield for a carbonyl group. Maybe it's an OCH2 group. Then, 10H between 2.41-2.23 ppm, which are probably in a ring structure, and 2H at 1.94 ppm, perhaps in a more shielded environment.

If product 1 is an epoxide, the 4.79 ppm would correspond to the OCH2 group. But earlier I thought the IR might not fit, but maybe the IR is wrong? Wait, no, the IR at 1720 cm^-1 is a strong carbonyl. So it's more likely a ketone.

Wait, maybe the product 1 has an ester group. Esters have carbonyl peaks around 1720. So perhaps product 1 is an ester.

Wait, but how would 1,3-dibromoadamantane react with KOH to form an ester?

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a cyclic ether with a ketone. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the initial reaction forms an epoxide, which then undergoes some ring-opening to form a ketone. But that seems a bit convoluted.

Alternatively, maybe product 1 is a glycol, but again, the IR doesn't fit.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think about product 3's NMR.

Product 3 is formed after ozonolysis of product 2, which likely has a double bond. Ozonolysis would cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups. So product 3 would have carbonyl groups where the double bond was.

The H in question is the most deshielded, which would be near the carbonyl. So perhaps it's in a CH2 group adjacent to two carbonyl groups.

In such a structure, each H in the CH2 would be adjacent to carbonyl groups and perhaps other H's. So for example, the structure could be O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O.

If that's the case, each CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, so each H is next to two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H would couple with two H's, leading to a triplet.

But wait, each H in the CH2 is also next to another CH2 group. So each H would have two neighboring H's on each side. So each H is coupled with two H's on the left and two on the right.

If the coupling constants are the same, each H would be split into a triplet from each side, leading to a triplet of triplets. But if the coupling constants are different, the splitting would be a doublet of triplets or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling is only with two H's, leading to a triplet.

Wait, but if the H's are in a symmetrical environment, perhaps the splitting would simplify. For example, in O=C-CH2-CH2-C=O, the two CH2 groups are identical, so each H in the middle would have four equivalent H's around. But that's not the case because each CH2 is attached to a carbonyl and another CH2. So each H would have two H's on each adjacent CH2, which are equivalent. So each H is coupled with two H's on one side and two on the other.

Wait, but for splitting, each coupling is considered separately. So each H is coupled with two H's on the left and two on the right. Since the left and right couplings are separate, the splitting would be a triplet for each, leading to a triplet of triplets.

So each H would be a triplet due to the left coupling, and each of those would be split again into triplets by the right coupling, leading to a total of 3x3=9 peaks, but in practice, it might be observed as a triplet of triplets.

But looking at the options, option B is triplet of triplets. So that's a possibility.

Alternatively, perhaps each H is coupled with two H's on one side and one on the other, leading to a doublet of triplets. But that doesn't fit as well.

Wait, perhaps the structure isn't symmetric. Suppose product 2 has a double bond in a position where ozonolysis creates two different carbonyl groups. So one end is a ketone and the other is an aldehyde. Then, the H's adjacent to the carbonyl would be in different environments.

For example, O=C-CH2-CH2-CHO. Then, the CH2 next to the ketone would have two H's adjacent, and the CH2 next to the aldehyde would have two H's adjacent. But I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, but in any case, the most deshielded H would be next to a carbonyl group. If it's in a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2, then each H in the CH2 would be split by the H's in the adjacent CH2.

In a simple case, each H is coupled with two H's, leading to a triplet.

But considering the options, I'm seeing triplet as an option (A). So maybe the coupling is a triplet.

Alternatively, if each H is coupled with three other H's, it would be a quartet, but that's not an option. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the H is part of a CH group adjacent to a CH2. Then, each H would couple with two H's from the CH2, leading to a triplet.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: after ozonolysis, the product would have carbonyl groups. The H's adjacent to these would likely be in a CH2 group. Let's say, a structure like O=C-CH2-CO-..., but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the most deshielded H is part of a CH2 group adjacent to two carbonyl groups. So each H in that CH2 is next to two H's on each side. If each H is coupled with two H's on each adjacent group, then each H would have four neighboring H's, leading to a quintet (n=4 → 5 peaks). So that would be a pentet, option D.

But earlier I thought that would be the case if the H's are all equivalent, but maybe they are not.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's are in a propenyl group or something else.

Wait, maybe I should think about the initial product 1.

If product 1 is 1,3-diketone, then product 2 could be an enol ether.

Wait, another thought: The aluminum isopropoxide could be causing the formation of an enol from the ketone. So perhaps each ketone group is converted into an enol, forming a conjugated diene.

Wait, but how? Maybe product 1 is 1,3-diketone, and upon treatment with Al isopropoxide, it forms an enol, leading to a conjugated dienone (like a 1,3-diene with ketones at the ends).

Then, product 2 would have a conjugated diene. Ozonolysis of a conjugated diene at low temperature would give two carbonyl groups. But wait, ozonolysis of a conjugated diene typically gives a diepoxide, but at lower temperatures, it can give different products.

Wait, actually, ozonolysis of a conjugated diene (like 1,3-pentadiene) would give two aldehyde groups. So in product 3, each of the former double bond ends would have a carbonyl group.

So, the structure after ozonolysis might be two carbonyl groups connected by a chain. The NMR would show the H's adjacent to those carbonyls.

The most deshielded H would be in a CH2 group next to a carbonyl. Each H would be coupled with two H's from the adjacent CH2 group. So each H would be a triplet.

That would make option A (triplet) the correct answer.

But wait, if the CH2 is next to another CH2, each H in the first CH2 would be coupled with two H's on the adjacent CH2. So each H would split into a triplet, leading to a triplet coupling pattern.

So the answer would be triplet, option A.


The problem involves a multi-step reaction sequence starting with 1,3-dibromoadamantane. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction with KOH**:  
   - 1,3-dibromoadamantane is heated with excess KOH.  
   - The IR spectrum of the product (product 1) shows a strong absorbance at 1720 cm⁻¹, indicative of a carbonyl group.  
   - The NMR data (4.79 ppm, 2H; 2.41–2.23 ppm, 10H; 1.94 ppm, 2H) suggests a diketone structure, likely 1,3-adamantanone.

2. **Reaction with Al isopropoxide**:  
   - Product 1 (1,3-adamantanone) is heated with excess aluminum isopropoxide.  
   - Aluminum isopropoxide, a strong Lewis acid, facilitates the formation of an enol ether or a related structure with a double bond.  
   - Product 2 likely contains a conjugated diene or enol ether structure, setting it up for ozonolysis.

3. **Ozonolysis and Work-Up**:  
   - Product 2 is treated with ozone at -78°C, followed by dimethyl sulfide.  
   - Ozonolysis cleaves double bonds, converting them into carbonyl groups.  
   - Product 3 is formed, and the most deshielded hydrogen in its NMR corresponds to a proton adjacent to a carbonyl group.

4. **Analysis of Coupling Pattern**:  
   - The most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is likely part of a CH₂ group adjacent to two carbonyl groups.  
   - Each hydrogen in this CH₂ group is coupled with two hydrogens from an adjacent CH₂ group.  
   - This results in a triplet coupling pattern due to the splitting caused by the two neighboring hydrogens.

Thus, the coupling pattern of the most deshielded hydrogen in product 3 is a **triplet**.

**Answer: A**
