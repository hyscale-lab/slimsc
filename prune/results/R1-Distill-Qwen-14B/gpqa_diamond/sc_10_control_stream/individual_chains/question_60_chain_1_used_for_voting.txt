Okay, so I've got this question here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember from my physics class that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs, right? So the astronaut's own time would pass slower compared to someone back on Earth. But wait, the question is from the astronaut's perspective. Oh, right, the problem says the astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long they experience until reaching Earth.

Wait, the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super fast! So the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud, I'm not exactly sure what that is. Oh, wait, I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. So the distance is approximately 163,000 light-years.

But wait, from the astronaut's frame of reference, the distance would be length-contracted. Because in special relativity, moving objects see distances as shorter. The length contraction formula is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper length (Earth's frame distance) and v is the spaceship's speed.

So let me calculate that. First, what's the gamma factor here? Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.99999987c, which is very close to c, gamma will be quite large.

Let me compute gamma. Let's approximate v as 0.99999987c. So beta (β) is 0.99999987. Let me compute 1 - β². 

β² is (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that. 0.99999987 squared is approximately (1 - 1.3e-7)^2. Wait, 0.99999987 is like 0.99999987 = 1 - 1.3e-7. Squared, that's 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. Since (1.3e-7)^2 is negligible, it's approximately 1 - 2.6e-7. So 1 - β² ≈ 2.6e-7.

So 1 - v²/c² = 2.6e-7. So gamma is 1/sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7). Hmm, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, so sqrt(2.6e-7) is 1.612e-3.5. Wait, no, 2.6e-7 is 2.6 x 10^-7. The square root of that is sqrt(2.6) * 10^(-7/2) = approximately 1.612 * 10^-3.5. Wait, 10^-3.5 is about 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 is approximately 5.08e-4. So gamma is 1 / 5.08e-4, which is approximately 1972. Or perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the exact formula: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). Let me compute 1 - β².

β is 0.99999987, so β² is (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that. Let me compute it as (1 - 1.3e-7)^2. So 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. As before, the last term is negligible. So 1 - β² ≈ 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - β²) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ sqrt(2.6) * (1e-7)^(1/2) = sqrt(2.6) * (1e-3.5) ≈ 1.612 * 3.16e-4. Wait, 1e-3.5 is 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.08e-4. So 1/sqrt(...) is 1/5.08e-4 ≈ 1968. So gamma is approximately 1968.

Now, the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth is about 163,000 light-years. So in Earth's frame, the time taken (t_earth) is distance divided by speed. So t_earth = 163,000 ly / 0.99999987c. Since 1 ly / c is 1 year, so t_earth ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years. Wait, wait, no, 0.99999987c is very close to c, so the time is almost 163,000 years. But wait, 163,000 divided by 0.99999987 is approximately 163,000 * (1.00000013) ≈ 163,000 + 163,000 * 1.3e-6 ≈ 163,000 + 0.2119 ≈ ~163,000.212 years. So t_earth is about 163,000 years.

But from the astronaut's frame, the distance is length-contracted by a factor of gamma. So L = L0 / gamma. So L0 is 163,000 light-years. So L = 163,000 / 1968 ≈ let me compute that. 163,000 divided by 1968. Let's see: 1968 * 80 is 157,440. 163,000 -157,440 is 5,560. 5,560 /1968 ≈ about 2.826. So total is approximately 82.826 light-years. So the proper length for the astronaut is about 82.83 light-years.

Now, the time experienced by the astronaut (t') is the contracted distance divided by speed. So t' = L / v. Since v is 0.99999987c. So L is 82.83 light-years, so t' =82.83 ly / 0.99999987c. Since 1 ly/c is 1 year, t' ≈ 82.83 / 0.99999987 ≈ 82.83 * 1.00000013 ≈ 82.83 + 0.000109 ≈ 82.830109 years. So about 82.83 years.

Wait, but the astronaut is 22 years old when they leave. So their age upon arrival would be 22 + 82.83 ≈ 104.83 years. But the average lifetime is 150 solar years. So they would live long enough, right? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting the frames wrong.

Wait another approach: Alternatively, from the astronaut's perspective, the Earth is moving towards them at velocity v. So the time experienced is the distance (contracted) divided by speed. So same as before, about 82.83 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 83 years of travel time. Looking at the options, the closest is option C) 81 years, or option D) 77 years. Wait, my calculation was approximately 82.8 years. So let me check the exact numbers again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let's recalculate gamma more accurately.

Beta is 0.99999987. So beta squared is (0.99999987)^2.

Let me compute it as:

(1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2.

1.3e-7 is 1.3 * 10^(-7). So 2*(1.3e-7) is 2.6e-7. (1.3e-7)^2 is 1.69e-14, which is negligible.

So 1 - beta squared is 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - beta^2) is sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute this more accurately.

2.6e-7 = 2.6 * 1e-7 = 2.6 * (1e-7) = 2.6e-7.

sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) = approx 1.612 * (1e-3.5) = 1.612 * (3.1623e-4) [since 1e-3.5 is 3.1623e-4].

1.612 * 3.1623e-4 = let's compute 1.612 * 3.1623 = approx 5.083. So 5.083e-4. So sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.083e-4.

So gamma = 1 / 5.083e-4 ≈ 1967.5. Let's say 1967.5.

So the contracted distance is L = L0 / gamma = 163000 / 1967.5 ≈ let me compute that.

163000 ÷ 1967.5.

Let me compute 1967.5 * 80: 1967.5 *80 = 157400.

Subtract from 163000: 163000 -157400 =5600.

Now, 5600 ÷ 1967.5 ≈ 2.843.

So total is 80 + 2.843 ≈ 82.843 light-years. So L ≈ 82.843 ly.

So the time experienced is L / v = 82.843 ly / (0.99999987 c) ≈ 82.843 / 0.99999987 ≈ 82.843 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 82.843 + 1.077e-5 ≈ 82.843001077 years.

So approximately 82.84 years.

Now, the astronaut is 22 when they depart, so the time they experience is 82.84 years. So their age upon arrival would be 22 + 82.84 ≈ 104.84 years.

The average lifetime is 150 years, so they would live long enough. So the astronaut would survive the trip and reach Earth.

But wait, that's from the astronaut's perspective. So in their frame, they live 82.84 years, and are 104.84 years old when they arrive.

But let's look at the options.

Option C is 81 years, option D is 77.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check. Because 82.8 years isn't one of the options. The options are 72, 77, 81, or 81 is the closest. Wait, but perhaps I messed up the distance. Oh, wait, maybe the distance is 160,000 light-years? Because I thought it was 163,000, but perhaps the question uses a different figure. Alternatively, maybe I should use a more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider another approach. Maybe using the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the Earth time divided by gamma. Because from Earth's frame, the time is 163,000 ly / 0.99999987c ≈ 163,000 years. So the Earth time is about 163,000 years.

So the astronaut's time is Earth time / gamma. So t' = t_earth / gamma.

So t_earth is (distance / speed) = 163000 ly / 0.99999987c ≈ 163000 years.

So t' = 163,000 / 1967.5 ≈ let's compute that.

163000 ÷ 1967.5:

1967.5 * 80 = 157400.

163000 -157400 =5600.

5600 /1967.5 ≈ 2.843.

So t' ≈82.843 years. Same as before.

So the astronaut would experience about 83 years. Looking at the options, option C) is 81 years. Hmm, but that's a bit off. Wait, perhaps my initial distance was wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away, but perhaps in the problem it's given as a different number. Wait, the question doesn't provide the distance, so maybe that's a missing piece here. Oh wait, the question doesn't give the distance, but I must have known it from prior knowledge? Or perhaps I'm supposed to compute it based on the time it takes from Earth's perspective.

Wait, the problem says the average lifetime is 150 years. The astronaut is 22, so Earth-based time would have to be less than 150-22=128 years. Wait, no, because from Earth's frame, the time is about 163,000 years, which is way longer than 128. So the astronaut would not survive, but from their frame, the time is about 83 years, so they would survive.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the question.

Question: The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years. Now, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut to reach Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?

Wait, but according to my calculations, from the astronaut's perspective, the trip takes about 83 years, so their age would be 22 +83 =105 years, which is less than 150, so they would survive. But looking at the options, none of them say 83 years. The options are A) die, B) 72, C)81, D)77.

So option C is 81, which is close to 83. But perhaps I miscalculated the gamma factor. Let me check the gamma again.

Wait, 0.99999987c is a very high speed. Let me compute 1 - v^2/c^2 precisely.

v = 0.99999987 c.

v^2 = (0.99999987)^2 = let me compute this more accurately.

0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Let me compute 1 - 0.00000013 * 2 + (0.00000013)^2.

Wait, (a - b)^2 = a² -2ab +b².

Here, a=1, b=1.3e-7.

So (1 -1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2.

Which is 1 - 2.6e-7 + (1.69e-14). The last term is negligible.

So 1 - v^2/c^2 = 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 -v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) = 1.6124 * 1e-3.5.

Wait, 1e-7 is 10^-7, so sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5 ≈ 3.1623e-4.

So sqrt(2.6e-7) = 1.6124 * 3.1623e-4 ≈ 5.083e-4.

Thus, gamma is 1 /5.083e-4 ≈ 1967.5.

So the time experienced by the astronaut is 163000 / gamma = 163000 /1967.5 ≈ approx 82.843 years.

Hmm, that's still 82.84 years. So the closest option is C)81 years. But I'm a bit off.

Wait, perhaps the distance isn't 163,000 light-years. Let me check: the average distance of the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Let's assume 163,000 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the time experienced by the astronaut as (distance in their frame) divided by speed.

Wait, another approach: The proper time (tau) is the shortest time experienced by the astronaut. The proper time is calculated using the Lorentz transformation.

The formula for proper time is tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = t_earth / gamma.

Because t_earth is the time in Earth's frame, which is 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years.

So tau = 163,000 / gamma = 163,000 /1967.5 ≈ 82.843 years.

So the astronaut experiences about 83 years, which is option C if it were 83, but the options don't have that. So the closest option is C)81, but perhaps my calculation is a bit off.

Wait, perhaps the initial distance is 170,000 light-years. Let me try 170,000 instead. Then 170,000 /1967.5 ≈ 86.35 years. Hmm, moving further away.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the spaceship's speed to compute the time in Earth's frame, then calculate the astronaut's time.

Wait, let me compute the time in Earth's frame. t_earth = distance/speed = 163000 ly / 0.99999987c = approximately 163,000 /0.99999987 ≈163,000*(1.00000013) ≈163,000 + 163,000 *1.3e-6 ≈163,000 +0.2119≈163,000.212 years.

So tau = t_earth / gamma = 163000.212 /1967.5 ≈82.843 years.

Still about 83 years.

So the options don't have 83, but option C is 81, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, the problem says "determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed". So the spaceship is moving at 0.99999987c. So from Earth's perspective, the time is 163,000 /0.99999987≈163,000 years. The astronaut's experienced time is 82.84 years, so they'd live 22 +83=105 years, which is less than 150, so they would survive. So the correct answer would be that the time is approximately 83 years from the astronaut's perspective. But since that's not an option, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance. Maybe the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth is about 160,000 light-years. Let me try that.

So distance is 160,000 ly. Then, tau = 160000 / 1967.5 ≈ approx 160000 ÷1967.5.

Let me compute 1967.5 *81 =1967.5 *80=157,400 +1967.5=159,367.5. Close to 160,000. So 160000 -159,367.5=632.5. 632.5/1967.5≈0.321. So 81.321 years. So about 81.3 years.

Ah, so if the distance is 160,000 ly, then tau is approx 81 years, which matches option C)81.

So perhaps the problem assumes the distance is about 160,000 ly, leading to 81 years. That would be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation leads to approximately 81 years.

So the answer should be C)81 years.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how long the astronaut will experience the journey to Earth, we analyze the situation using the principles of special relativity, particularly time dilation and length contraction.

### Key Information:
- The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), where \( c \) is the speed of light.
- The distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth is approximately \( 163,000 \, \text{light-years} \).
- The astronaut is 22 years old at the start of the journey, and the average lifetime of the aliens is 150 years.

### Step 1: Time Dilation and Length Contraction
From the astronaut's perspective, the distance to Earth is length-contracted. The length contraction formula is:

\[
L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

where \( L_0 = 163,000 \, \text{light-years} \) is the proper length (distance in Earth's frame), and \( \frac{v}{c} = 0.99999987 \). First, calculate \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \):

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{1 - (0.99999987)^2} \approx \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 5.083 \times 10^{-4}
\]

Thus, the contracted distance is:

\[
L = 163,000 \times 5.083 \times 10^{-4} \approx 82.84 \, \text{light-years}.
\]

### Step 2: Time Experienced by the Astronaut
The time experienced by the astronaut (\( t' \)) is the contracted distance divided by the spacecraft's speed:

\[
t' = \frac{L}{v} = \frac{82.84}{0.99999987} \approx 82.84 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 3: Age of the Astronaut Upon Arrival
The astronaut is 22 years old at the start of the journey. Adding the experienced travel time:

\[
\text{Age upon arrival} = 22 + 82.84 \approx 104.84 \, \text{years}.
\]

Since the average lifetime of the aliens is 150 years, the astronaut will survive the journey.

### Step 4: Matching the Options
The calculated travel time from the astronaut's perspective is approximately \( 82.84 \, \text{years} \). Among the given options, the closest value is **81 years**.

### Conclusion:
The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years of travel time, and they will survive the journey. 

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this question here about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, I remember from my physics class that when you travel at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs, right? So the astronaut's own time would pass slower compared to someone back on Earth. But wait, the question is from the astronaut's perspective. Oh, right, the problem says the astronaut is 22 years old, and we need to find out how long they experience until reaching Earth.

Wait, the spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light. That's super fast! So the distance to Earth from the Large Magellanic Cloud, I'm not exactly sure what that is. Oh, wait, I think the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. So the distance is approximately 163,000 light-years.

But wait, from the astronaut's frame of reference, the distance would be length-contracted. Because in special relativity, moving objects see distances as shorter. The length contraction formula is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L0 is the proper length (Earth's frame distance) and v is the spaceship's speed.

So let me calculate that. First, what's the gamma factor here? Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v is 0.99999987c, which is very close to c, gamma will be quite large.

Let me compute gamma. Let's approximate v as 0.99999987c. So beta (β) is 0.99999987. Let me compute 1 - β². 

β² is (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that. 0.99999987 squared is approximately (1 - 1.3e-7)^2. Wait, 0.99999987 is like 0.99999987 = 1 - 1.3e-7. Squared, that's 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. Since (1.3e-7)^2 is negligible, it's approximately 1 - 2.6e-7. So 1 - β² ≈ 2.6e-7.

So 1 - v²/c² = 2.6e-7. So gamma is 1/sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute sqrt(2.6e-7). Hmm, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612, so sqrt(2.6e-7) is 1.612e-3.5. Wait, no, 2.6e-7 is 2.6 x 10^-7. The square root of that is sqrt(2.6) * 10^(-7/2) = approximately 1.612 * 10^-3.5. Wait, 10^-3.5 is about 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 is approximately 5.08e-4. So gamma is 1 / 5.08e-4, which is approximately 1972. Or perhaps I should compute it more precisely.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the exact formula: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - β²). Let me compute 1 - β².

β is 0.99999987, so β² is (0.99999987)^2. Let me compute that. Let me compute it as (1 - 1.3e-7)^2. So 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2. As before, the last term is negligible. So 1 - β² ≈ 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - β²) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ sqrt(2.6) * (1e-7)^(1/2) = sqrt(2.6) * (1e-3.5) ≈ 1.612 * 3.16e-4. Wait, 1e-3.5 is 3.16e-4. So 1.612 * 3.16e-4 ≈ 5.08e-4. So 1/sqrt(...) is 1/5.08e-4 ≈ 1968. So gamma is approximately 1968.

Now, the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth is about 163,000 light-years. So in Earth's frame, the time taken (t_earth) is distance divided by speed. So t_earth = 163,000 ly / 0.99999987c. Since 1 ly / c is 1 year, so t_earth ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years. Wait, wait, no, 0.99999987c is very close to c, so the time is almost 163,000 years. But wait, 163,000 divided by 0.99999987 is approximately 163,000 * (1.00000013) ≈ 163,000 + 163,000 * 1.3e-6 ≈ 163,000 + 0.2119 ≈ ~163,000.212 years. So t_earth is about 163,000 years.

But from the astronaut's frame, the distance is length-contracted by a factor of gamma. So L = L0 / gamma. So L0 is 163,000 light-years. So L = 163,000 / 1968 ≈ let me compute that. 163,000 divided by 1968. Let's see: 1968 * 80 is 157,440. 163,000 -157,440 is 5,560. 5,560 /1968 ≈ about 2.826. So total is approximately 82.826 light-years. So the proper length for the astronaut is about 82.83 light-years.

Now, the time experienced by the astronaut (t') is the contracted distance divided by speed. So t' = L / v. Since v is 0.99999987c. So L is 82.83 light-years, so t' =82.83 ly / 0.99999987c. Since 1 ly/c is 1 year, t' ≈ 82.83 / 0.99999987 ≈ 82.83 * 1.00000013 ≈ 82.83 + 0.000109 ≈ 82.830109 years. So about 82.83 years.

Wait, but the astronaut is 22 years old when they leave. So their age upon arrival would be 22 + 82.83 ≈ 104.83 years. But the average lifetime is 150 solar years. So they would live long enough, right? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting the frames wrong.

Wait another approach: Alternatively, from the astronaut's perspective, the Earth is moving towards them at velocity v. So the time experienced is the distance (contracted) divided by speed. So same as before, about 82.83 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 83 years of travel time. Looking at the options, the closest is option C) 81 years, or option D) 77 years. Wait, my calculation was approximately 82.8 years. So let me check the exact numbers again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamma calculation. Let's recalculate gamma more accurately.

Beta is 0.99999987. So beta squared is (0.99999987)^2.

Let me compute it as:

(1 - 1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2.

1.3e-7 is 1.3 * 10^(-7). So 2*(1.3e-7) is 2.6e-7. (1.3e-7)^2 is 1.69e-14, which is negligible.

So 1 - beta squared is 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 - beta^2) is sqrt(2.6e-7). Let me compute this more accurately.

2.6e-7 = 2.6 * 1e-7 = 2.6 * (1e-7) = 2.6e-7.

sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) = approx 1.612 * (1e-3.5) = 1.612 * (3.1623e-4) [since 1e-3.5 is 3.1623e-4].

1.612 * 3.1623e-4 = let's compute 1.612 * 3.1623 = approx 5.083. So 5.083e-4. So sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.083e-4.

So gamma = 1 / 5.083e-4 ≈ 1967.5. Let's say 1967.5.

So the contracted distance is L = L0 / gamma = 163000 / 1967.5 ≈ let me compute that.

163000 ÷ 1967.5.

Let me compute 1967.5 * 80: 1967.5 *80 = 157400.

Subtract from 163000: 163000 -157400 =5600.

Now, 5600 ÷ 1967.5 ≈ 2.843.

So total is 80 + 2.843 ≈ 82.843 light-years. So L ≈ 82.843 ly.

So the time experienced is L / v = 82.843 ly / (0.99999987 c) ≈ 82.843 / 0.99999987 ≈ 82.843 * (1 + 1.3e-7) ≈ 82.843 + 1.077e-5 ≈ 82.843001077 years.

So approximately 82.84 years.

Now, the astronaut is 22 when they depart, so the time they experience is 82.84 years. So their age upon arrival would be 22 + 82.84 ≈ 104.84 years.

The average lifetime is 150 years, so they would live long enough. So the astronaut would survive the trip and reach Earth.

But wait, that's from the astronaut's perspective. So in their frame, they live 82.84 years, and are 104.84 years old when they arrive.

But let's look at the options.

Option C is 81 years, option D is 77.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me double-check. Because 82.8 years isn't one of the options. The options are 72, 77, 81, or 81 is the closest. Wait, but perhaps I messed up the distance. Oh, wait, maybe the distance is 160,000 light-years? Because I thought it was 163,000, but perhaps the question uses a different figure. Alternatively, maybe I should use a more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider another approach. Maybe using the time experienced by the astronaut, which is the Earth time divided by gamma. Because from Earth's frame, the time is 163,000 ly / 0.99999987c ≈ 163,000 years. So the Earth time is about 163,000 years.

So the astronaut's time is Earth time / gamma. So t' = t_earth / gamma.

So t_earth is (distance / speed) = 163000 ly / 0.99999987c ≈ 163000 years.

So t' = 163,000 / 1967.5 ≈ let's compute that.

163000 ÷ 1967.5:

1967.5 * 80 = 157400.

163000 -157400 =5600.

5600 /1967.5 ≈ 2.843.

So t' ≈82.843 years. Same as before.

So the astronaut would experience about 83 years. Looking at the options, option C) is 81 years. Hmm, but that's a bit off. Wait, perhaps my initial distance was wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away, but perhaps in the problem it's given as a different number. Wait, the question doesn't provide the distance, so maybe that's a missing piece here. Oh wait, the question doesn't give the distance, but I must have known it from prior knowledge? Or perhaps I'm supposed to compute it based on the time it takes from Earth's perspective.

Wait, the problem says the average lifetime is 150 years. The astronaut is 22, so Earth-based time would have to be less than 150-22=128 years. Wait, no, because from Earth's frame, the time is about 163,000 years, which is way longer than 128. So the astronaut would not survive, but from their frame, the time is about 83 years, so they would survive.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the question.

Question: The average lifetime of these aliens is roughly 150 solar years. Now, they are determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed of 0.99999987*c. Approximately, how long will it take for their 22 years old astronaut to reach Earth using this incredibly fast spacecraft?

Wait, but according to my calculations, from the astronaut's perspective, the trip takes about 83 years, so their age would be 22 +83 =105 years, which is less than 150, so they would survive. But looking at the options, none of them say 83 years. The options are A) die, B) 72, C)81, D)77.

So option C is 81, which is close to 83. But perhaps I miscalculated the gamma factor. Let me check the gamma again.

Wait, 0.99999987c is a very high speed. Let me compute 1 - v^2/c^2 precisely.

v = 0.99999987 c.

v^2 = (0.99999987)^2 = let me compute this more accurately.

0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Let me compute 1 - 0.00000013 * 2 + (0.00000013)^2.

Wait, (a - b)^2 = a² -2ab +b².

Here, a=1, b=1.3e-7.

So (1 -1.3e-7)^2 = 1 - 2*(1.3e-7) + (1.3e-7)^2.

Which is 1 - 2.6e-7 + (1.69e-14). The last term is negligible.

So 1 - v^2/c^2 = 2.6e-7.

So sqrt(1 -v²/c²) is sqrt(2.6e-7) = sqrt(2.6) * sqrt(1e-7) = 1.6124 * 1e-3.5.

Wait, 1e-7 is 10^-7, so sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5 ≈ 3.1623e-4.

So sqrt(2.6e-7) = 1.6124 * 3.1623e-4 ≈ 5.083e-4.

Thus, gamma is 1 /5.083e-4 ≈ 1967.5.

So the time experienced by the astronaut is 163000 / gamma = 163000 /1967.5 ≈ approx 82.843 years.

Hmm, that's still 82.84 years. So the closest option is C)81 years. But I'm a bit off.

Wait, perhaps the distance isn't 163,000 light-years. Let me check: the average distance of the Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 160,000 to 200,000 light-years away. Let's assume 163,000 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the time experienced by the astronaut as (distance in their frame) divided by speed.

Wait, another approach: The proper time (tau) is the shortest time experienced by the astronaut. The proper time is calculated using the Lorentz transformation.

The formula for proper time is tau = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) = t_earth / gamma.

Because t_earth is the time in Earth's frame, which is 163000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 years.

So tau = 163,000 / gamma = 163,000 /1967.5 ≈ 82.843 years.

So the astronaut experiences about 83 years, which is option C if it were 83, but the options don't have that. So the closest option is C)81, but perhaps my calculation is a bit off.

Wait, perhaps the initial distance is 170,000 light-years. Let me try 170,000 instead. Then 170,000 /1967.5 ≈ 86.35 years. Hmm, moving further away.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the spaceship's speed to compute the time in Earth's frame, then calculate the astronaut's time.

Wait, let me compute the time in Earth's frame. t_earth = distance/speed = 163000 ly / 0.99999987c = approximately 163,000 /0.99999987 ≈163,000*(1.00000013) ≈163,000 + 163,000 *1.3e-6 ≈163,000 +0.2119≈163,000.212 years.

So tau = t_earth / gamma = 163000.212 /1967.5 ≈82.843 years.

Still about 83 years.

So the options don't have 83, but option C is 81, which is close. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, the problem says "determined to travel with this spacecraft at a constant speed". So the spaceship is moving at 0.99999987c. So from Earth's perspective, the time is 163,000 /0.99999987≈163,000 years. The astronaut's experienced time is 82.84 years, so they'd live 22 +83=105 years, which is less than 150, so they would survive. So the correct answer would be that the time is approximately 83 years from the astronaut's perspective. But since that's not an option, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the distance. Maybe the distance from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth is about 160,000 light-years. Let me try that.

So distance is 160,000 ly. Then, tau = 160000 / 1967.5 ≈ approx 160000 ÷1967.5.

Let me compute 1967.5 *81 =1967.5 *80=157,400 +1967.5=159,367.5. Close to 160,000. So 160000 -159,367.5=632.5. 632.5/1967.5≈0.321. So 81.321 years. So about 81.3 years.

Ah, so if the distance is 160,000 ly, then tau is approx 81 years, which matches option C)81.

So perhaps the problem assumes the distance is about 160,000 ly, leading to 81 years. That would be option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation leads to approximately 81 years.

So the answer should be C)81 years.


To determine how long the astronaut will experience the journey to Earth, we analyze the situation using the principles of special relativity, particularly time dilation and length contraction.

### Key Information:
- The spacecraft travels at a speed of \( v = 0.99999987c \), where \( c \) is the speed of light.
- The distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth is approximately \( 163,000 \, \text{light-years} \).
- The astronaut is 22 years old at the start of the journey, and the average lifetime of the aliens is 150 years.

### Step 1: Time Dilation and Length Contraction
From the astronaut's perspective, the distance to Earth is length-contracted. The length contraction formula is:

\[
L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

where \( L_0 = 163,000 \, \text{light-years} \) is the proper length (distance in Earth's frame), and \( \frac{v}{c} = 0.99999987 \). First, calculate \( \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} \):

\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{1 - (0.99999987)^2} \approx \sqrt{2.6 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 5.083 \times 10^{-4}
\]

Thus, the contracted distance is:

\[
L = 163,000 \times 5.083 \times 10^{-4} \approx 82.84 \, \text{light-years}.
\]

### Step 2: Time Experienced by the Astronaut
The time experienced by the astronaut (\( t' \)) is the contracted distance divided by the spacecraft's speed:

\[
t' = \frac{L}{v} = \frac{82.84}{0.99999987} \approx 82.84 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 3: Age of the Astronaut Upon Arrival
The astronaut is 22 years old at the start of the journey. Adding the experienced travel time:

\[
\text{Age upon arrival} = 22 + 82.84 \approx 104.84 \, \text{years}.
\]

Since the average lifetime of the aliens is 150 years, the astronaut will survive the journey.

### Step 4: Matching the Options
The calculated travel time from the astronaut's perspective is approximately \( 82.84 \, \text{years} \). Among the given options, the closest value is **81 years**.

### Conclusion:
The astronaut will experience approximately 81 years of travel time, and they will survive the journey.
