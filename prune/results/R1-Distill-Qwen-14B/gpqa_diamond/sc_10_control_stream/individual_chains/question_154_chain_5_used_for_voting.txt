Okay, so I've got this problem here where a chemist found an unnamed white solid, and we need to figure out what it is using the spectral data provided. Hmm, let's see. The options are A to D, each a different compound. I'll need to analyze the Mass, IR, and NMR data step by step.

First, the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 and it's 100%, so that's the molecular weight. There's also a peak at 158 with 32%, which is probably the molecular ion plus something, maybe a chlorine atom? Because Cl has an atomic weight of about 35.5. Wait, 156 plus 2 would be 158 if there's a Cl involved. Because sometimes you get isotopic peaks, right? Chlorine has two main isotopes, Cl-35 and Cl-37. So the M peak would be the lower one, and the M+2 would be 32% which is typical for a Cl content. So maybe the compound has one Cl atom.

Next, the IR data. A broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 suggests an -OH group or maybe an amine, but more likely an -OH because of the broadness, which is typical for O-H stretching. Then there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That region usually corresponds to carbonyl groups. A strong peak there could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm^-1, but sometimes a bit higher. Alternatively, an ester or acid chloride would be higher. But wait, if the compound is a benzoic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700. Hmm, the peak is at 1720, which is a bit higher, which might suggest an ester, acid chloride, or maybe a ketone. But looking back, the options include benzoic acids and a chloroformate.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Its structure would have a benzene ring with Cl and COOH groups. The -COOH would give a broad peak in IR from O-H (carboxylic acid). The carbonyl would be around 1700 cm^-1, but the given peak is at 1720. Hmm, maybe a bit higher for some reason, but close enough?

Option C is phenyl chloroformate. That's Cl-CO-O-Ph. The carbonyl in an acid chloride is usually higher, around 1800 cm^-1, but wait, that might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe if it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1740-1720. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The carbonyl in an acid chloride is typically higher than in esters. So maybe 1720 isn't right for an acid chloride. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think. Ester carbonyls are around 1720-1750, acid chlorides higher, like 1800. So if the IR is 1720, that's more like an ester or maybe a ketone, but not an acid chloride. So maybe options B and D are more likely, as they're benzoic acids.

Wait, but benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1680-1700. So 1720 would be a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps it's not a carboxylic acid. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a substituted benzoic acid where the substituent affects the carbonyl stretching. Or maybe it's an ester, but looking at the options, the only ester would be option C, which is phenyl chloroformate. But the IR for that would have the acid chloride's carbonyl, which should be higher. So perhaps the IR suggests something else.

Wait, the IR has a broad peak from 3500 to 2700 cm^-1. That's a very broad region, which could be from an -OH group. Alternatively, it could be from an aldehyde's O-H, but aldehydes usually have a peak around 2820 and 2720 for the aldehyde C-H stretch. Wait, but the broad peak here is in the 3500-2700 region. That's a big range. So maybe it's an -OH stretch. For a carboxylic acid, the -OH is broad and strong. So if the IR shows a broad peak there, that supports the presence of -OH, as in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But looking at the options, only options B, D are carboxylic acids, and A and C are different.

Let me look at the NMR data next. The 1H NMR shows:

11.0 ppm (s, 1H) → This is a singlet at around 11 ppm. That's a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton. Because carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm as singlets. So that fits with options B and D, which are benzoic acids.

8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H) → These are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests two sets of aromatic protons, each as a doublet. Let's think about the substitution on the benzene ring.

If it's a para-substituted benzene, like 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the two protons adjacent to the substituents would be equivalent. Wait, but in para substitution, each set would be a doublet. For example, if there's a Cl and COOH in para positions, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H. Wait, but in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring would have Cl and COOH in para positions. So the ring is 1,4-disubstituted.

In that case, the splitting would be as follows: the protons ortho to Cl and COOH would each have two neighboring protons, but wait, no, in para substitution, each of the two ortho positions to Cl would be adjacent to the other substituent. Hmm, perhaps I should draw it.

Benzoic acid has the COOH group in position 1. If Cl is in position 4, then the ring has substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the remaining positions (2,3,5,6) are all H. Wait, no, because the substituents are in 1 and 4. So positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH, and positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's number the benzene ring. Position 1 is COOH. Then, the Cl is in position 4. So the positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH (position 1). Positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl (position 4). So the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH, and their chemical shifts would be downfield due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the COOH group. The protons at 3 and 5 would be ortho to Cl, which is an electron-withdrawing group as well.

Wait, but wait, Cl is an ortho/para director, but in this case, as a substituent on the benzene, when attached to another group, it affects the ring. But in benzoic acid, the COOH is a strong EWG, so the ring is deactivating. So the substitution pattern affects the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling in the NMR can tell me the substitution pattern. The two doublets each with 2H suggest that the two sets of H are each coupled to one other set. So perhaps it's a para-substituted ring. Let's think: in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the two sets of H would each be a doublet. For example, in 1,4-dichlorobenzene, the two H's in each ortho position would be equivalent and each a doublet. But in the case of benzoic acid with Cl in para, the substituents are COOH in 1 and Cl in 4. So the ring would have two sets of H's. The H's ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded and appear downfield. The H's meta to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would be more upfield, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the H's ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would be more deshielded because Cl is an EWG.

Wait, but in any case, the NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that would suggest that the ring is disubstituted, and the substituents are in the para positions. Because if substituents are in meta positions, the splitting would be more complex, perhaps a triplet or more. Alternatively, if substituents are in ortho positions, you might have more splitting.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the coupling constants. The two doublets probably have a coupling constant around 8-9 Hz, typical for aromatic protons. But the question doesn't provide the J values. So, let's focus on the other data.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl and COOH in para positions. So the ring has substituents in 1 and 4. So, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Each of these would have two neighboring H's (since each pair is adjacent to substituents). Wait, but in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the COOH is in position 1, Cl in 4. So, the H in position 2 is adjacent to substituent in 1 and 3. The H in position 6 is adjacent to substituent in 1 and 5. The H in position 3 is adjacent to substituent in 4 and 2. The H in position 5 is adjacent to substituent in 4 and 6.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the NMR peaks. The two doublets each have 2H. So maybe the substituents are in positions that create two sets of equivalent H's, each set being a pair of H's in equivalent positions.

In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are in 1 and 4 positions. So, the H's in positions 2 and 6 are equivalent (they are both ortho to COOH). These H's would be a doublet because each is adjacent to one substituent. Wait, no. Each H in position 2 is adjacent to substituent in 1 and 3. Wait, substituent in 1 is COOH, which is a meta director. So, perhaps the H's in position 2 and 6 would be deshielded and appear as a doublet, each coupling with the adjacent H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's in positions 3 and 5 are equivalent, each being adjacent to the Cl. So, H3 and H5 would be equivalent and each would show a doublet.

Wait, but in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are para, so the H's in positions 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH, and H3 and H5 are meta to Cl.

Wait, maybe I should think about the chemical shifts. The H's ortho to COOH would be more deshielded, so their chemical shifts would be higher (downfield), around 8.02 ppm. The H's meta to Cl (or ortho to Cl) would be more deshielded as well, but perhaps not as much as those ortho to COOH.

Wait, in the NMR, the first doublet is at 8.02 ppm, integrating to 2H, and the second is at 7.72 ppm, 2H. So, the higher ppm (8.02) would be more deshielded, likely ortho to the COOH group, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group. The 7.72 ppm would be the H's near Cl, which is also EWG but perhaps not as strong as COOH.

So that makes sense for 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The H's ortho to COOH are at higher ppm (8.02) as a doublet, and the H's ortho to Cl are lower (7.72) as a doublet.

Looking at the other options:

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So substituents are Cl at position 2 and COOH at position 1. So, the ring would have substituents in 1 and 2 positions, which are adjacent (ortho). Then, the H's in positions 3,4,5,6 would be split into different environments. Let's see. H4 would be between substituents 3 and 5. Wait, no, substituents are at 1 and 2. So, H3 is adjacent to substituent 2 (Cl) and H4. H6 is adjacent to substituent 1 (COOH) and H5. I'm not sure. The NMR might show more splitting than two doublets.

But the NMR data shows only two doublets, each for 2H. So perhaps the structure is para-substituted, like option B. So the H's ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) are a doublet at 8.02, and the H's ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5) are a doublet at 7.72.

That fits.

Now, looking at the mass spectrum again. The molecular ion is at 156. Let's calculate the molecular weight for each option.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Molecular formula is C7H5ClO2.

Carbon:7 *12=84. H:5*1=5. Cl:35.5. O:2*16=32. Total: 84 +5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So the molecular ion would be roughly 156.5. Since the molecular ion is given as 156 (100%), that would be the M+ peak, but considering the exact mass, the isotopic peaks would be at 156, 158, etc. Wait, the molecular weight is approximately 156.5, so the major peak would be at 156, and a peak at 158 (M+2) because of Cl's isotopes (Cl has 35Cl and 37Cl). So the presence of 32% at 158 suggests minor isotopic peaks, which would be typical for a Cl-containing compound. So that fits.

Now, the molecular formula for option B is C7H5ClO2. Let me calculate the exact mass. The exact mass would be: 

C: 12.01 *7 =84.07
H:5 *1.008=5.04
Cl:35.45
O:16.00 *2=32.00

Total: 84.07 +5.04=89.11; 89.11 +35.45=124.56; 124.56 +32=156.56.

So the molecular ion would be at m/z 156.56. But the given molecular ion is at 156, which is close enough. The M+2 peak would be at 158 (35Cl ->37Cl, so +2). So the 32% at 158 makes sense because the natural abundance of chlorine-37 is about 32.9% (wait, actually, natural abundance of Cl-35 is about 75% and Cl-37 is about 25%). Wait, so the M+2 peak would be for Cl-37, which is about 25% of the Cl. So, the M+2 peak would be (75% Cl-35 * 100%) and (25% Cl-37 * 100% plus any other factors). Wait, no, the molecular ion peak is at 156, which is the most abundant (Cl-35). The M+2 would be 158, and the intensity is based on the abundance of Cl-37. So, for a single Cl atom, the M+2 would be about 25% of the M peak. But in the data, the 158 peak is 32% of the M. Hmm, that's higher than 25%. So maybe the molecule has more than one Cl? But looking at the options, only options A and C have more than one Cl? Wait, option A is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let me check its formula.

Option A: C7H5ClO2 as well. Same as option B. So same molecular weight of 156.56. So the M and M+2 would be same for both A and B. So the mass data alone can't distinguish A and B.

But wait, let's look at the NMR again. The singlet at 11 ppm is the COOH proton. So for option A, which is a benzaldehyde derivative, the functional group is an aldehyde. So, in that case, the aldehyde proton would appear around 9-10 ppm, typically as a singlet. But in the NMR data, the singlet is at 11.0 ppm, which is more downfield, suggesting a carboxylic acid proton rather than an aldehyde. So that would point more towards option B.

Wait, but wait, option A is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be Cl at position 3, OH at position 2, and aldehyde at position 1. So, the structure would be:

CO H
|
O H Cl
|
Ph

Wait, the aldehyde is in position 1, so the proton would be at around 9-10 ppm. But in the NMR data, the singlet is at 11.0, which is more like a carboxylic acid. So option A's aldehyde proton would not appear at 11 ppm. So that suggests the singlet is not an aldehyde but a carboxylic acid.

Therefore, option A is less likely. So, the NMR supports option B or D.

Wait, option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So, substituents are Cl at position 2 and COOH at position 1. So the aromatic protons would be in positions 3,4,5,6. Let's think about their NMR.

In 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring has substituents at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So, the H's at position 3 would be adjacent to Cl (position 2) and COOH (position 1). H4 would be meta to Cl and ortho to H3 and H5. H5 would be adjacent to H4 and H6. H6 would be adjacent to COOH and H5.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated, but perhaps the NMR would show more splitting. Let me think about the coupling. In 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring is ortho-substituted with Cl and COOH. So the H's at positions 3,4,5,6 would each have different environments. Let me imagine the structure:

COOH (1)
|
Cl (2)
|
H3 (near Cl)
H4 is between H3 and H5.
H5 is next to H4 and H6.
H6 is next to H5 and COOH.

But the NMR shows two doublets, each for 2H. That suggests that the substituents cause the ring to have two sets of equivalent protons. For 2-chlorobenzoic acid, would that happen?

Hmm, perhaps not. Because substituents are ortho, the symmetry is lower. So the ring might have H3 and H6 as a pair, and H4 and H5 as another pair, but their chemical shifts might differ.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring is not symmetric enough, so the NMR would show more than two sets of peaks. But in our case, the NMR shows only two doublets, each for 2H. So that suggests a higher symmetry, perhaps a para-substituted ring.

So that would more likely be option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, which is para-substituted, leading to two sets of equivalent protons.

Putting it all together:

- Molecular weight is 156, so options A, B, C, D all have molecular formulas that sum to about 156.
- IR shows a broad peak (OH) and strong peak at 1720 (maybe COOH or ester).
- The NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm (COOH), and two doublets, which suggest a para-substituted benzene with substituents in positions 1 and 4.
- The M+2 peak is 32%, which aligns with Cl being present, and the molecular formula of option B matches.

So the correct answer would be option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To identify the compound, we analyze the spectral data provided:

### Mass Spectrometry:
- **Molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)**: This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156.
- **M+2 peak at m/z = 158 (32%)**: The presence of a chlorine atom is suggested, as chlorine has two isotopes (Cl-35 and Cl-37), with Cl-37 contributing to the M+2 peak. The 32% intensity aligns with the natural abundance of Cl-37.

### IR Spectroscopy:
- **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹**: This is characteristic of an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **Strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**: This corresponds to a carbonyl group. The higher wavenumber compared to typical carboxylic acids (1700 cm⁻¹) suggests possible resonance effects or substituent effects.

### ¹H NMR:
- **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: This is a singlet integrating to 1H, consistent with the deshielded proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).
- **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: These are two doublets, each integrating to 2H, indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring. The downfield shift at 8.02 ppm suggests protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the slightly upfield shift at 7.72 ppm corresponds to protons ortho to the chlorine atom.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   - This compound contains an aldehyde group, which would show a proton signal around 9-10 ppm in the NMR spectrum. However, the singlet at 11.0 ppm is more consistent with a carboxylic acid proton, ruling out this option.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - The structure features a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a chlorine atom at position 4.  
   - The NMR data matches this structure: the singlet at 11.0 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton, and the two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons ortho to the carboxylic acid and chlorine, respectively.  
   - The molecular weight (156) and the M+2 peak at 158 align with the presence of one chlorine atom.

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   - This compound contains an acid chloride group (Cl-CO-O-Ph). The carbonyl stretch for an acid chloride typically appears around 1800 cm⁻¹, which is higher than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹, making this option unlikely.

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - This compound features a meta-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a chlorine atom at position 2.  
   - The NMR data for this structure would not show two distinct doublets for 2H each, as the asymmetry of the meta substitution would result in more complex splitting patterns. Thus, this option is inconsistent with the NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, particularly the NMR and IR, strongly support **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**. The para-substitution pattern, molecular weight, and presence of a chlorine atom are consistent with the given data.

**Answer: B**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem here where a chemist found an unnamed white solid, and we need to figure out what it is using the spectral data provided. Hmm, let's see. The options are A to D, each a different compound. I'll need to analyze the Mass, IR, and NMR data step by step.

First, the mass spectrum. The molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 and it's 100%, so that's the molecular weight. There's also a peak at 158 with 32%, which is probably the molecular ion plus something, maybe a chlorine atom? Because Cl has an atomic weight of about 35.5. Wait, 156 plus 2 would be 158 if there's a Cl involved. Because sometimes you get isotopic peaks, right? Chlorine has two main isotopes, Cl-35 and Cl-37. So the M peak would be the lower one, and the M+2 would be 32% which is typical for a Cl content. So maybe the compound has one Cl atom.

Next, the IR data. A broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 suggests an -OH group or maybe an amine, but more likely an -OH because of the broadness, which is typical for O-H stretching. Then there's a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. That region usually corresponds to carbonyl groups. A strong peak there could be a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or maybe a carboxylic acid. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is usually around 1700 cm^-1, but sometimes a bit higher. Alternatively, an ester or acid chloride would be higher. But wait, if the compound is a benzoic acid, the carbonyl would be around 1700. Hmm, the peak is at 1720, which is a bit higher, which might suggest an ester, acid chloride, or maybe a ketone. But looking back, the options include benzoic acids and a chloroformate.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Its structure would have a benzene ring with Cl and COOH groups. The -COOH would give a broad peak in IR from O-H (carboxylic acid). The carbonyl would be around 1700 cm^-1, but the given peak is at 1720. Hmm, maybe a bit higher for some reason, but close enough?

Option C is phenyl chloroformate. That's Cl-CO-O-Ph. The carbonyl in an acid chloride is usually higher, around 1800 cm^-1, but wait, that might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe if it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1740-1720. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The carbonyl in an acid chloride is typically higher than in esters. So maybe 1720 isn't right for an acid chloride. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think. Ester carbonyls are around 1720-1750, acid chlorides higher, like 1800. So if the IR is 1720, that's more like an ester or maybe a ketone, but not an acid chloride. So maybe options B and D are more likely, as they're benzoic acids.

Wait, but benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1680-1700. So 1720 would be a bit higher. Hmm, perhaps it's not a carboxylic acid. Wait, another possibility: maybe it's a substituted benzoic acid where the substituent affects the carbonyl stretching. Or maybe it's an ester, but looking at the options, the only ester would be option C, which is phenyl chloroformate. But the IR for that would have the acid chloride's carbonyl, which should be higher. So perhaps the IR suggests something else.

Wait, the IR has a broad peak from 3500 to 2700 cm^-1. That's a very broad region, which could be from an -OH group. Alternatively, it could be from an aldehyde's O-H, but aldehydes usually have a peak around 2820 and 2720 for the aldehyde C-H stretch. Wait, but the broad peak here is in the 3500-2700 region. That's a big range. So maybe it's an -OH stretch. For a carboxylic acid, the -OH is broad and strong. So if the IR shows a broad peak there, that supports the presence of -OH, as in a carboxylic acid or an alcohol. But looking at the options, only options B, D are carboxylic acids, and A and C are different.

Let me look at the NMR data next. The 1H NMR shows:

11.0 ppm (s, 1H) → This is a singlet at around 11 ppm. That's a strong indication of a carboxylic acid proton. Because carboxylic acid protons are usually around 10-12 ppm as singlets. So that fits with options B and D, which are benzoic acids.

8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H) → These are two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That suggests two sets of aromatic protons, each as a doublet. Let's think about the substitution on the benzene ring.

If it's a para-substituted benzene, like 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the two protons adjacent to the substituents would be equivalent. Wait, but in para substitution, each set would be a doublet. For example, if there's a Cl and COOH in para positions, the aromatic protons would be two doublets, each integrating to 2H. Wait, but in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring would have Cl and COOH in para positions. So the ring is 1,4-disubstituted.

In that case, the splitting would be as follows: the protons ortho to Cl and COOH would each have two neighboring protons, but wait, no, in para substitution, each of the two ortho positions to Cl would be adjacent to the other substituent. Hmm, perhaps I should draw it.

Benzoic acid has the COOH group in position 1. If Cl is in position 4, then the ring has substituents at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the remaining positions (2,3,5,6) are all H. Wait, no, because the substituents are in 1 and 4. So positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH, and positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let's number the benzene ring. Position 1 is COOH. Then, the Cl is in position 4. So the positions 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH (position 1). Positions 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl (position 4). So the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be ortho to COOH, and their chemical shifts would be downfield due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the COOH group. The protons at 3 and 5 would be ortho to Cl, which is an electron-withdrawing group as well.

Wait, but wait, Cl is an ortho/para director, but in this case, as a substituent on the benzene, when attached to another group, it affects the ring. But in benzoic acid, the COOH is a strong EWG, so the ring is deactivating. So the substitution pattern affects the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the coupling in the NMR can tell me the substitution pattern. The two doublets each with 2H suggest that the two sets of H are each coupled to one other set. So perhaps it's a para-substituted ring. Let's think: in para-substituted benzene with two substituents, the two sets of H would each be a doublet. For example, in 1,4-dichlorobenzene, the two H's in each ortho position would be equivalent and each a doublet. But in the case of benzoic acid with Cl in para, the substituents are COOH in 1 and Cl in 4. So the ring would have two sets of H's. The H's ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be more deshielded and appear downfield. The H's meta to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would be more upfield, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the H's ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5) would be more deshielded because Cl is an EWG.

Wait, but in any case, the NMR shows two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that would suggest that the ring is disubstituted, and the substituents are in the para positions. Because if substituents are in meta positions, the splitting would be more complex, perhaps a triplet or more. Alternatively, if substituents are in ortho positions, you might have more splitting.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's think about the coupling constants. The two doublets probably have a coupling constant around 8-9 Hz, typical for aromatic protons. But the question doesn't provide the J values. So, let's focus on the other data.

Looking back at the options:

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl and COOH in para positions. So the ring has substituents in 1 and 4. So, the aromatic protons would be in positions 2,3,5,6. Each of these would have two neighboring H's (since each pair is adjacent to substituents). Wait, but in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the COOH is in position 1, Cl in 4. So, the H in position 2 is adjacent to substituent in 1 and 3. The H in position 6 is adjacent to substituent in 1 and 5. The H in position 3 is adjacent to substituent in 4 and 2. The H in position 5 is adjacent to substituent in 4 and 6.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think about the NMR peaks. The two doublets each have 2H. So maybe the substituents are in positions that create two sets of equivalent H's, each set being a pair of H's in equivalent positions.

In 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are in 1 and 4 positions. So, the H's in positions 2 and 6 are equivalent (they are both ortho to COOH). These H's would be a doublet because each is adjacent to one substituent. Wait, no. Each H in position 2 is adjacent to substituent in 1 and 3. Wait, substituent in 1 is COOH, which is a meta director. So, perhaps the H's in position 2 and 6 would be deshielded and appear as a doublet, each coupling with the adjacent H's.

Alternatively, perhaps the H's in positions 3 and 5 are equivalent, each being adjacent to the Cl. So, H3 and H5 would be equivalent and each would show a doublet.

Wait, but in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are para, so the H's in positions 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH, and H3 and H5 are meta to Cl.

Wait, maybe I should think about the chemical shifts. The H's ortho to COOH would be more deshielded, so their chemical shifts would be higher (downfield), around 8.02 ppm. The H's meta to Cl (or ortho to Cl) would be more deshielded as well, but perhaps not as much as those ortho to COOH.

Wait, in the NMR, the first doublet is at 8.02 ppm, integrating to 2H, and the second is at 7.72 ppm, 2H. So, the higher ppm (8.02) would be more deshielded, likely ortho to the COOH group, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group. The 7.72 ppm would be the H's near Cl, which is also EWG but perhaps not as strong as COOH.

So that makes sense for 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The H's ortho to COOH are at higher ppm (8.02) as a doublet, and the H's ortho to Cl are lower (7.72) as a doublet.

Looking at the other options:

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So substituents are Cl at position 2 and COOH at position 1. So, the ring would have substituents in 1 and 2 positions, which are adjacent (ortho). Then, the H's in positions 3,4,5,6 would be split into different environments. Let's see. H4 would be between substituents 3 and 5. Wait, no, substituents are at 1 and 2. So, H3 is adjacent to substituent 2 (Cl) and H4. H6 is adjacent to substituent 1 (COOH) and H5. I'm not sure. The NMR might show more splitting than two doublets.

But the NMR data shows only two doublets, each for 2H. So perhaps the structure is para-substituted, like option B. So the H's ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) are a doublet at 8.02, and the H's ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5) are a doublet at 7.72.

That fits.

Now, looking at the mass spectrum again. The molecular ion is at 156. Let's calculate the molecular weight for each option.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Molecular formula is C7H5ClO2.

Carbon:7 *12=84. H:5*1=5. Cl:35.5. O:2*16=32. Total: 84 +5=89 +35.5=124.5 +32=156.5. So the molecular ion would be roughly 156.5. Since the molecular ion is given as 156 (100%), that would be the M+ peak, but considering the exact mass, the isotopic peaks would be at 156, 158, etc. Wait, the molecular weight is approximately 156.5, so the major peak would be at 156, and a peak at 158 (M+2) because of Cl's isotopes (Cl has 35Cl and 37Cl). So the presence of 32% at 158 suggests minor isotopic peaks, which would be typical for a Cl-containing compound. So that fits.

Now, the molecular formula for option B is C7H5ClO2. Let me calculate the exact mass. The exact mass would be: 

C: 12.01 *7 =84.07
H:5 *1.008=5.04
Cl:35.45
O:16.00 *2=32.00

Total: 84.07 +5.04=89.11; 89.11 +35.45=124.56; 124.56 +32=156.56.

So the molecular ion would be at m/z 156.56. But the given molecular ion is at 156, which is close enough. The M+2 peak would be at 158 (35Cl ->37Cl, so +2). So the 32% at 158 makes sense because the natural abundance of chlorine-37 is about 32.9% (wait, actually, natural abundance of Cl-35 is about 75% and Cl-37 is about 25%). Wait, so the M+2 peak would be for Cl-37, which is about 25% of the Cl. So, the M+2 peak would be (75% Cl-35 * 100%) and (25% Cl-37 * 100% plus any other factors). Wait, no, the molecular ion peak is at 156, which is the most abundant (Cl-35). The M+2 would be 158, and the intensity is based on the abundance of Cl-37. So, for a single Cl atom, the M+2 would be about 25% of the M peak. But in the data, the 158 peak is 32% of the M. Hmm, that's higher than 25%. So maybe the molecule has more than one Cl? But looking at the options, only options A and C have more than one Cl? Wait, option A is 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Let me check its formula.

Option A: C7H5ClO2 as well. Same as option B. So same molecular weight of 156.56. So the M and M+2 would be same for both A and B. So the mass data alone can't distinguish A and B.

But wait, let's look at the NMR again. The singlet at 11 ppm is the COOH proton. So for option A, which is a benzaldehyde derivative, the functional group is an aldehyde. So, in that case, the aldehyde proton would appear around 9-10 ppm, typically as a singlet. But in the NMR data, the singlet is at 11.0 ppm, which is more downfield, suggesting a carboxylic acid proton rather than an aldehyde. So that would point more towards option B.

Wait, but wait, option A is 3-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure would be Cl at position 3, OH at position 2, and aldehyde at position 1. So, the structure would be:

CO H
|
O H Cl
|
Ph

Wait, the aldehyde is in position 1, so the proton would be at around 9-10 ppm. But in the NMR data, the singlet is at 11.0, which is more like a carboxylic acid. So option A's aldehyde proton would not appear at 11 ppm. So that suggests the singlet is not an aldehyde but a carboxylic acid.

Therefore, option A is less likely. So, the NMR supports option B or D.

Wait, option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So, substituents are Cl at position 2 and COOH at position 1. So the aromatic protons would be in positions 3,4,5,6. Let's think about their NMR.

In 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring has substituents at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). So, the H's at position 3 would be adjacent to Cl (position 2) and COOH (position 1). H4 would be meta to Cl and ortho to H3 and H5. H5 would be adjacent to H4 and H6. H6 would be adjacent to COOH and H5.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated, but perhaps the NMR would show more splitting. Let me think about the coupling. In 2-chlorobenzoic acid, the ring is ortho-substituted with Cl and COOH. So the H's at positions 3,4,5,6 would each have different environments. Let me imagine the structure:

COOH (1)
|
Cl (2)
|
H3 (near Cl)
H4 is between H3 and H5.
H5 is next to H4 and H6.
H6 is next to H5 and COOH.

But the NMR shows two doublets, each for 2H. That suggests that the substituents cause the ring to have two sets of equivalent protons. For 2-chlorobenzoic acid, would that happen?

Hmm, perhaps not. Because substituents are ortho, the symmetry is lower. So the ring might have H3 and H6 as a pair, and H4 and H5 as another pair, but their chemical shifts might differ.

Alternatively, perhaps the ring is not symmetric enough, so the NMR would show more than two sets of peaks. But in our case, the NMR shows only two doublets, each for 2H. So that suggests a higher symmetry, perhaps a para-substituted ring.

So that would more likely be option B, 4-chlorobenzoic acid, which is para-substituted, leading to two sets of equivalent protons.

Putting it all together:

- Molecular weight is 156, so options A, B, C, D all have molecular formulas that sum to about 156.
- IR shows a broad peak (OH) and strong peak at 1720 (maybe COOH or ester).
- The NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm (COOH), and two doublets, which suggest a para-substituted benzene with substituents in positions 1 and 4.
- The M+2 peak is 32%, which aligns with Cl being present, and the molecular formula of option B matches.

So the correct answer would be option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.


To identify the compound, we analyze the spectral data provided:

### Mass Spectrometry:
- **Molecular ion peak at m/z = 156 (100%)**: This indicates the molecular weight of the compound is 156.
- **M+2 peak at m/z = 158 (32%)**: The presence of a chlorine atom is suggested, as chlorine has two isotopes (Cl-35 and Cl-37), with Cl-37 contributing to the M+2 peak. The 32% intensity aligns with the natural abundance of Cl-37.

### IR Spectroscopy:
- **Broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹**: This is characteristic of an -OH group, likely from a carboxylic acid.
- **Strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**: This corresponds to a carbonyl group. The higher wavenumber compared to typical carboxylic acids (1700 cm⁻¹) suggests possible resonance effects or substituent effects.

### ¹H NMR:
- **11.0 ppm (s, 1H)**: This is a singlet integrating to 1H, consistent with the deshielded proton of a carboxylic acid (-COOH).
- **8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 ppm (d, 2H)**: These are two doublets, each integrating to 2H, indicative of a para-substituted benzene ring. The downfield shift at 8.02 ppm suggests protons ortho to the electron-withdrawing carboxylic acid group, while the slightly upfield shift at 7.72 ppm corresponds to protons ortho to the chlorine atom.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   - This compound contains an aldehyde group, which would show a proton signal around 9-10 ppm in the NMR spectrum. However, the singlet at 11.0 ppm is more consistent with a carboxylic acid proton, ruling out this option.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - The structure features a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a chlorine atom at position 4.  
   - The NMR data matches this structure: the singlet at 11.0 ppm corresponds to the carboxylic acid proton, and the two doublets at 8.02 ppm and 7.72 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons ortho to the carboxylic acid and chlorine, respectively.  
   - The molecular weight (156) and the M+2 peak at 158 align with the presence of one chlorine atom.

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   - This compound contains an acid chloride group (Cl-CO-O-Ph). The carbonyl stretch for an acid chloride typically appears around 1800 cm⁻¹, which is higher than the observed 1720 cm⁻¹, making this option unlikely.

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   - This compound features a meta-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group at position 1 and a chlorine atom at position 2.  
   - The NMR data for this structure would not show two distinct doublets for 2H each, as the asymmetry of the meta substitution would result in more complex splitting patterns. Thus, this option is inconsistent with the NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The spectral data, particularly the NMR and IR, strongly support **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**. The para-substitution pattern, molecular weight, and presence of a chlorine atom are consistent with the given data.

**Answer: B**
