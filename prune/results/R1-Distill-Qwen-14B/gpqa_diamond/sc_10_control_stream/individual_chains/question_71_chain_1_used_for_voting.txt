Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says there are five exoplanets in orbital resonance with periods in the ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. They used the TTV method, but I don't think that part matters for calculating the temperatures. All I need to focus on is the orbital periods and the equilibrium temperatures.

The planets have the same albedo, so that simplifies things because albedo affects the energy reflected, but if it's the same, it won't change the ratio of their temperatures.

Equilibrium temperature, right. I remember that the formula for equilibrium temperature is based on the star's luminosity and the distance of the planet from the star. The formula I think is T = T_earth * sqrt(R/(2a)), but wait, maybe it's the other way around. Wait, no, more accurately, the formula is T = T_star * (L / (16πσ a²))^1/4. But since all planets are orbiting the same star, maybe we can consider T proportional to (1/a^0.5), because L and other constants would be same for all.

Wait, let's get the correct formula. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:

T = T_star * ( (L) / (16πσ a²) )^0.25

But since L (luminosity) and σ (Stefan-Boltzmann constant) are the same for the same star, the ratio of temperatures between two planets will depend on the ratio of their distances a.

So, for Planet_4 and Planet_2, their temperatures will be proportional to 1/(a_4^0.5) and 1/(a_2^0.5), respectively. So the ratio T4/T2 would be (a_2 / a_4)^0.5.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The formula is T = T_star * ( (1) / (a²) )^0.25, because the flux from the star goes as 1/a². So when you take the fourth root, it becomes 1/a^0.5. So T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So T is inversely proportional to the square root of the orbital radius.

But wait, since all the planets are in orbital resonance, their orbital periods are in a ratio. So the periods are in the ratios given. So their orbital periods are P1:P2:P3:P4:P5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.

But Kepler's third law says that P² is proportional to a³, right? So for planets, (a1/a2)^3 = (P1/P2)^2.

Wait, no, the exact form is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. So P² is proportional to a³. So that means a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So the orbital radius a of each planet is proportional to the square of their period (since a ~ P^(2/3)). So if I can find the ratio of a4 and a2, I can find the ratio of their distances.

Let me get the periods for Planet 2 and Planet 4.

From the ratio, Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 is P2 = 2*P1, Planet_4 is P4 = 3.5*P1.

So the ratio a4/a2 would be (P4/P2)^(2/3), because a is proportional to P^(2/3).

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. For any two planets, a1/a2 = (P1/P2)^(2/3). Because from P² ∝ a³, so a ∝ P^(2/3).

So a4 = (P4 / P1)^(2/3) * a1. Similarly, a2 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3) * a1.

So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Because when you take (P4/P1)^(2/3) divided by (P2/P1)^(2/3), it's (P4/P2)^(2/3).

So, P4 is 3.5 P1, P2 is 2 P1.

So the ratio (P4/P2) = (3.5)/(2) = 1.75.

Then a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3).

So now, the temperature ratio T4/T2 is (a2/a4)^0.5, because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So:

T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^0.5 = (1/(a4/a2))^0.5 = (1/(1.75^(2/3)))^0.5 = 1 / (1.75^(2/3 * 1/2 )) = 1/ (1.75^(1/3)).

Wait, let's compute that step by step.

First, 1.75 is 7/4. So 1.75 = 7/4.

So (7/4)^(2/3) is (7^2)^(1/3) / (4^2)^(1/3) ) = (49)^(1/3) / (16)^(1/3) ) ≈ (3.659)/(2.5198) ≈ 1.45.

Wait, but alternatively, 1.75^(2/3) is the same as ( (1.75)^(1/3) )^2.

But maybe I should compute it numerically.

Compute 1.75^(2/3):

First, compute 1.75^(1/3):

Cube of 1.2 is 1.728, which is close to 1.75. So 1.75^(1/3) ≈ 1.2. Let me check: 1.2^3 is 1.728, which is a bit less than 1.75. So maybe 1.2^3=1.728, 1.21^3= (1.2+0.01)^3 = 1.2³ + 3*(1.2)^2*(0.01) + 3*(1.2)*(0.01)^2 + (0.01)^3. 1.728 + 3*(1.44)(0.01) = 1.728 + 0.0432 = 1.7712. So 1.21^3 ≈ 1.7712, which is a bit higher than 1.75. So 1.75^(1/3) is about 1.205?

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate it more accurately.

But perhaps I should compute 1.75^(2/3) as (1.75^2)^(1/3) = (3.0625)^(1/3). What's the cube root of 3.0625?

2^3=8, 1.4^3=2.744, 1.45^3= (1.4)^3 + 3*(1.4)^2*(0.05) + 3*(1.4)*(0.05)^2 + (0.05)^3. 2.744 + 3*(1.96)(0.05) = 2.744 + 0.294 = 3.038. Then 1.45^3 ≈ 3.05, which is close to 3.0625. So cube root of 3.0625 is about 1.45.

So a4/a2 is 1.45.

So T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^0.5 = (1/1.45)^0.5 = sqrt(1/1.45).

What's 1/1.45? Approximately 0.6897.

Square root of approximately 0.6897 is about 0.83.

Wait wait, no. Square root of 0.6897: since 0.8^2 is 0.64, 0.83^2 is 0.6889, which is very close to 0.6897. So the square root is approximately 0.83.

So T4/T2 ≈ 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. So the answer should be C.

To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that the equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital radius \( a \), i.e., \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \). Using Kepler's third law, \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), we find that \( a \propto P^{2/3} \). Thus, the ratio of orbital radii \( a_4/a_2 \) is proportional to \( (P_4/P_2)^{2/3} \).

From the given orbital period ratios, \( P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \), we identify \( P_2 = 2P_1 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \). Therefore, \( P_4/P_2 = 3.5/2 = 1.75 \), and \( a_4/a_2 = (1.75)^{2/3} \).

To compute \( (1.75)^{2/3} \), we first approximate \( 1.75^{1/3} \). Testing values, \( 1.2^3 = 1.728 \) and \( 1.21^3 = 1.7712 \), so \( 1.75^{1/3} \approx 1.205 \). Squaring this gives \( (1.75)^{2/3} \approx (1.205)^2 \approx 1.45 \).

The equilibrium temperature ratio \( T_4/T_2 \) is then \( (a_2/a_4)^{1/2} = (1/1.45)^{1/2} \). Calculating \( 1/1.45 \approx 0.6897 \), and taking the square root gives \( \sqrt{0.6897} \approx 0.83 \).

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

So, for Planet_4 and Planet_2, their temperatures will be proportional to 1/(a_4^0.5) and 1/(a_2^0.5), respectively. So the ratio T4/T2 would be (a_2 / a_4)^0.5.

Wait, no, the exact form is P² = (4π²/GM) * a³. So P² is proportional to a³. So that means a is proportional to P^(2/3).

So the orbital radius a of each planet is proportional to the square of their period (since a ~ P^(2/3)). So if I can find the ratio of a4 and a2, I can find the ratio of their distances.

Let me get the periods for Planet 2 and Planet 4.

From the ratio, Planet_1 has period P1, Planet_2 is P2 = 2*P1, Planet_4 is P4 = 3.5*P1.

So the ratio a4/a2 would be (P4/P2)^(2/3), because a is proportional to P^(2/3).

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. For any two planets, a1/a2 = (P1/P2)^(2/3). Because from P² ∝ a³, so a ∝ P^(2/3).

So a4 = (P4 / P1)^(2/3) * a1. Similarly, a2 = (P2 / P1)^(2/3) * a1.

So a4/a2 = (P4/P2)^(2/3).

Because when you take (P4/P1)^(2/3) divided by (P2/P1)^(2/3), it's (P4/P2)^(2/3).

So, P4 is 3.5 P1, P2 is 2 P1.

So the ratio (P4/P2) = (3.5)/(2) = 1.75.

Then a4/a2 = (1.75)^(2/3).

So now, the temperature ratio T4/T2 is (a2/a4)^0.5, because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a). So:

T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^0.5 = (1/(a4/a2))^0.5 = (1/(1.75^(2/3)))^0.5 = 1 / (1.75^(2/3 * 1/2 )) = 1/ (1.75^(1/3)).

Wait, let's compute that step by step.

First, 1.75 is 7/4. So 1.75 = 7/4.

So (7/4)^(2/3) is (7^2)^(1/3) / (4^2)^(1/3) ) = (49)^(1/3) / (16)^(1/3) ) ≈ (3.659)/(2.5198) ≈ 1.45.

Wait, but alternatively, 1.75^(2/3) is the same as ( (1.75)^(1/3) )^2.

But maybe I should compute it numerically.

Compute 1.75^(2/3):

So maybe 1.2^3=1.728, 1.21^3= (1.2+0.01)^3 = 1.2³ + 3*(1.2)^2*(0.01) + 3*(1.2)*(0.01)^2 + (0.01)^3. 1.728 + 3*(1.44)(0.01) = 1.728 + 0.0432 = 1.7712. So 1.21^3 ≈ 1.7712, which is a bit higher than 1.75. So 1.75^(1/3) is about 1.205?

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate it more accurately.

But perhaps I should compute 1.75^(2/3) as (1.75^2)^(1/3) = (3.0625)^(1/3). What's the cube root of 3.0625?

2^3=8, 1.4^3=2.744, 1.45^3= (1.4)^3 + 3*(1.4)^2*(0.05) + 3*(1.4)*(0.05)^2 + (0.05)^3. 2.744 + 3*(1.96)(0.05) = 2.744 + 0.294 = 3.038. Then 1.45^3 ≈ 3.05, which is close to 3.0625. So cube root of 3.0625 is about 1.45.

So a4/a2 is 1.45.

So T4/T2 = (a2/a4)^0.5 = (1/1.45)^0.5 = sqrt(1/1.45).

What's 1/1.45? Approximately 0.6897.

Square root of approximately 0.6897 is about 0.83.

Wait wait, no. Square root of 0.6897: since 0.8^2 is 0.64, 0.83^2 is 0.6889, which is very close to 0.6897. So the square root is approximately 0.83.

So T4/T2 ≈ 0.83.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.83. So the answer should be C.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that the equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital radius \( a \), i.e., \( T \propto 1/\sqrt{a} \).

From the given orbital period ratios, \( P_1:P_2:P_3:P_4:P_5 = 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \), we identify \( P_2 = 2P_1 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \). Therefore, \( P_4/P_2 = 3.5/2 = 1.75 \), and \( a_4/a_2 = (1.75)^{2/3} \).

To compute \( (1.75)^{2/3} \), we first approximate \( 1.75^{1/3} \). Testing values, \( 1.2^3 = 1.728 \) and \( 1.21^3 = 1.7712 \), so \( 1.75^{1/3} \approx 1.205 \). Squaring this gives \( (1.75)^{2/3} \approx (1.205)^2 \approx 1.45 \).

The equilibrium temperature ratio \( T_4/T_2 \) is then \( (a_2/a_4)^{1/2} = (1/1.45)^{1/2} \). Calculating \( 1/1.45 \approx 0.6897 \), and taking the square root gives \( \sqrt{0.6897} \approx 0.83 \).

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:
