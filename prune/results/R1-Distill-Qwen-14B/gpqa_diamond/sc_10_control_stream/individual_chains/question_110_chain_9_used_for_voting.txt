Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, let me think through this.

First, I'll try to understand the problem. The question is asking which stars can be observed by both the ESPRESSO and HIRES spectrographs. From the information given, each spectrograph has a different brightness limit. ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than V magnitude 17, but HIRES can only go down to 16. So for a star to be detected by both, it needs to have an apparent V magnitude that's brighter than 16 (since HIRES is the stricter limit here). Because if it's brighter than 16, then it's definitely brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it too.

Now, let's look at each star one by one. Each star has its own parameters, like absolute magnitude, distance, and sometimes extinction (E(B-V)) which affects the apparent magnitude due to interstellar dust.

Starting with Star1:
- Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, distance 10 pc. Wait, absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So if it's 10 pc away, its apparent magnitude is the same as the absolute. So Star1's apparent V is 15.5. Comparing to the limits: 15.5 is less than 16, so it's brighter than 16 mag. Wait, but wait, no: in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a magnitude of 15.5 is brighter than 16.0. So Star1's apparent V is 15.5, which is within both telescopes' capabilities. So ESPRESSO can see it (as it's brighter than 17) and HIRES can also see it (brighter than 16). So Star1 is a candidate for being detected by both.

Star2:
- Apparent V magnitude is 16.5. Oh, wait, that's higher than 16.0. Wait, higher magnitude means fainter. So 16.5 is fainter than 16. So Star2's apparent V is 16.5. ESPRESSO can handle up to 17, so 16.5 is okay for ESPRESSO. But HIRES only goes to 16. So 16.5 is too faint for HIRES. So Star2 can't be detected by both; only ESPRESSO maybe.

Star3:
- Apparent V magnitude is 15.5. But wait, there's E(B-V) = 0.6. Oh, right, extinction affects apparent magnitude. The formula is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So Av is 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86. So the star's actual apparent magnitude without extinction would be m0 = m - Av. Wait, no, wait: the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + Av. Oh wait, wait. No, I think I got this wrong. Let me think: when there's extinction, the observed apparent magnitude m is the true m (without extinction) plus the extinction Av. So m_observed = m_true + Av. So to get the true m, we subtract Av. Wait no, wait, the formula is m = M +5 log (d/10) + Av. Because M is the absolute magnitude, and m is apparent. So if the star is at distance d, then without extinction, m would be M +5 log (d/10). But extinction adds Av, so the observed m is higher.

Wait, no: M is the absolute magnitude, which is what the apparent magnitude would be at 10 pc with no extinction. So when a star is at distance d, its apparent magnitude without extinction is M +5 log(d/10). But with extinction, the observed m is larger (fainter) by Av. So m_observed = m_true + Av.

So for Star3, the given apparent magnitude is 15.5. But is that the observed m (including extinction) or the true m? The question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" — but I think that's the observed magnitude. But wait, if there's extinction, the apparent magnitude would be higher. So if the given m is 15.5, but the actual m without extinction (if no dust) would be lower. Wait, but the question states that Star3 has E(B-V)=0.6 and gives that Av=3.1*E(B-V)=1.86. So the star's intrinsic apparent magnitude would be m0 = m_observed - Av. Wait, no, the observed m is m0 + Av. So m_observed = m0 + Av → m0 = m_observed - Av.

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:

The formula for extinction in magnitudes is m_observed = m_true + Av. So if the star's true apparent magnitude (without extinction) is m_true, then the observed is m_true plus Av. So if E(B-V) is given, and Av=3.1*E(B-V), then the star's apparent magnitude as observed is m = m_true + Av.

Wait, but in the case of Star3, the given apparent magnitude is 15.5, which I think already includes the extinction. So if m_observed is 15.5, and m_true is m_observed - Av → 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. So the actual m_true is 13.64, but that's not relevant here because the question is about the observed apparent magnitude. Wait, no. Because the spectrographs detect the observed magnitude. So to check if the spectrograph can see it, we use the observed m. 

Wait, no, because if the observed m is 15.5, and the spectrograph's limit is 16.0, then Star3's observed m is 15.5, which is below (brighter than) 16. So the apparent magnitude of 15.5 is within HIRES's limit of 16. So Star3's observed m is 15.5, which is brighter than 16. So HIRES can see it, and ESPRESSO (limit 17) can see it. So Star3 is a candidate for both.

Wait, but wait: some sources say that when you have extinction (Av), the star appears fainter. So the observed magnitude is larger. So if a star's true apparent magnitude is m, the observed is m + Av. So for Star3, if the true m is, say, 15.5 -1.86 = 13.64, but the observed is 15.5. So the observed m is 15.5, which is brighter than 16. So HIRES can see it (since 15.5 <16), and ESPRESSO can see it (15.5 <17). So Star3 is observable by both.

Star4:
- Absolute V magnitude 15.5, distance 10 pc, E(B-V) =0.4. So first, what is the apparent magnitude without extinction? Since distance is 10 pc, the apparent magnitude without extinction is the same as absolute magnitude: 15.5. Now, compute the extinction. Av=3.1 * 0.4 =1.24. So the observed apparent magnitude m_observed is 15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Wait, wait: no, the formula is m = M + 5 log10 (d/10) + Av. Wait, distance is 10 pc, so log(10/10)=0. So m = M + 0 + Av. So M is 15.5, Av is 1.24. So m =15.5 +1.24 =16.74.

So Star4's observed apparent V magnitude is 16.74. Now, comparing to the limits. HIRES can't observe stars brighter than 16. So 16.74 is fainter (higher magnitude), so HIRES can't observe it. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so 16.74 is below 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. But for both, Star4 is only observable by ESPRESSO, so not both.

Star5:
- Absolute V magnitude is 16.5, and distance is 5 pc. So apparent magnitude without extinction is M +5 log(d/10). d=5, so log(5/10)=log(0.5)=-0.3010. So 5 * (-0.3010) = -1.505. So m = M +5 log(d/10) → 16.5 + (-1.505) = 14.995, approximately 15.0. So the apparent magnitude without extinction is 15.0. Now, any extinction? The problem says E(B-V)=0.4 mag, but wait, the question only mentions Star3 and Star4 as having E(B-V). Wait, checking the question again: Star5's description says nothing about E(B-V). So I think Star5 does not have extinction. So m_observed is 15.0.

So Star5's apparent magnitude is 15.0, which is brighter than both 16 and 17. So both HIRES and ESPRESSO can observe it. So Star5 is observable by both.

Wait, but wait: Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5, at 5 pc. So without extinction, m = M +5 log(d/10) → 16.5 +5*(log(5/10)) = 16.5 +5*(-0.3010) = 16.5 -1.505 ≈14.995. So m is about 15.0. So with no extinction, it's 15.0. So yes, Star5's apparent V is 15.0.

So now, let's list which stars are observable by both:

Star1: apparent m 15.5 → brighter than 16, so both can see it.

Star2: m 16.5 → only ESPRESSO can see it.

Star3: m 15.5 → both can see it.

Star4: m 16.74 → only ESPRESSO can.

Star5: m 15.0 → both can.

Wait, wait, no. Because Star5's star is at 5 pc, and its absolute magnitude is 16.5. So when calculating apparent magnitude, it's indeed 15.0. So m=15.0, which is below 16 (so both can observe).

Wait, but let me check Star5's details again. The question says 'Star5 - ... absolute V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.' So correct, m=15.0.

So the stars that can be seen by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but wait: the options are given as choices. Let's look at the options.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5: no, because Star4's m is 16.74, which is too faint for HIRES.

B) Star3 and Star5: both have m below 16. So both can be observed by both spectrographs. So this option would be correct.

C) Star2 and Star3: Star2 has m=16.5 → only ESPRESSO can see it, so this option is wrong.

D) Star1 and Star4: Star1's m=15.5 → both can see, but Star4's m=16.74 → only ESPRESSO. So D is wrong.

Wait, but wait: earlier I thought Star5's m is 15.0, which is seen by both. But in the question, Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5. So m is 15.0, which is within both.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Looking at the options, option B says Star3 and Star5. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait: what about Star1. Let's recheck Star1.

Star1's absolute magnitude is 15.5, at 10 pc. So m =15.5, as M is the apparent at 10 pc. So m=15.5. Which is below 16, so both can observe.

Hmm, but the options don't include an option with Star1, Star3, Star5. The options are:
A) Star4 and Star5
B) Star3 and Star5
C) Star2 and Star3
D) Star1 and Star4

So according to this, only option B includes two stars (3 and 5) that are both within both spectrographs' limits.

Wait, but Star1's m is 15.5, which is within both. So why isn't it in any of the options? Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate Star1's apparent magnitude.

Star1: absolute V magnitude 15.5, located at 10 pc. So m = M +5 log(d/10) → d=10, so log(10/10)=0. So m=15.5 + 0 =15.5. So its apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is brighter than 16. So both can see it.

So the stars that can be seen by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

But the options don't include any option that includes Star1. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, I think the answer should be that Star1 and Star5 are both detected by both. But wait, the options don't have such an option. Let's think.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated Star1's m. Because Star1 is at 10 pc, but perhaps its absolute magnitude is 15.5. So yes, m=15.5.

So the options don't have any that include Star1 and Star5. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-examine the options. The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5
B) Star3 and Star5
C) Star2 and Star3
D) Star1 and Star4

So the only option where both stars are within both's limits is B) Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but Star1's m is 15.5, which is below 16, so it can be observed by both. But in the options, the only option with Star1 is D, which pairs it with Star4 (which can't be observed by HIRES). So why isn't Star1 included in any correct option?

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in considering that Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but with extinction, perhaps Star3's observed m is 15.5, which is acceptable.

Wait, no, let me recheck Star3. Star3's given apparent V is 15.5. But because it has E(B-V) =0.6, which gives Av=1.86. So the observed m is 15.5, which is 15.5. So that's the value to use. So it's acceptable for both.

Wait, another thought: when considering the apparent magnitude, the question says for Star3, the apparent V is 15.5. But that's after extinction? Or before? Because the value given is the apparent which includes extinction.

Wait, the problem says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

So the apparent magnitude given is 15.5, which is what's observed (including extinction). So to determine the intrinsic apparent magnitude, we would subtract Av. But for the purposes of this question, since the spectrograph observes the apparent magnitude, that's what we should use.

So Star3's m is 15.5, which is below 16, so both can see it.

So in the options, B is Star3 and Star5, which are both acceptable.

So the correct answer is B.

To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars, considering the telescopes' brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17, while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤ 16 to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude = 15.5, distance = 10 pc.  
   - At 10 pc, the apparent V magnitude equals the absolute magnitude: \( m = 15.5 \).  
   - \( m = 15.5 \) is brighter than 16, so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.  

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude = 16.5, distance = 5 pc.  
   - \( m = 16.5 \) is fainter than 16, so HIRES cannot detect it. ESPRESSO can detect it.  

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude = 15.5, distance = 15 pc, \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).  
   - Extinction in the V band: \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 1.86 \).  
   - The observed apparent magnitude already includes extinction, so \( m = 15.5 \).  
   - \( m = 15.5 \) is brighter than 16, so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.  

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude = 15.5, distance = 10 pc, \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \).  
   - At 10 pc, the apparent magnitude without extinction is \( m = 15.5 \).  
   - Extinction in the V band: \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 1.24 \).  
   - Observed apparent magnitude: \( m = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \).  
   - \( m = 16.74 \) is fainter than 16, so HIRES cannot detect it. ESPRESSO can detect it.  

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude = 16.5, distance = 5 pc.  
   - Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 - 1.505 \approx 15.0
     \]  
   - \( m = 15.0 \) is brighter than 16, so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.  

### Conclusion:
The stars detectable by both spectrographs are **Star1, Star3, and Star5**. Among the given options, only **Star3 and Star5** are correctly paired.  

**Correct Answer**:  
B) Star3 and Star5  

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. Hmm, let me think through this.

From the information given, each spectrograph has a different brightness limit. ESPRESSO can see stars brighter than V magnitude 17, but HIRES can only go down to 16. So for a star to be detected by both, it needs to have an apparent V magnitude that's brighter than 16 (since HIRES is the stricter limit here). Because if it's brighter than 16, then it's definitely brighter than 17, so ESPRESSO can see it too.

Now, let's look at each star one by one. Each star has its own parameters, like absolute magnitude, distance, and sometimes extinction (E(B-V)) which affects the apparent magnitude due to interstellar dust.

Starting with Star1:
- Absolute V magnitude is 15.5, distance 10 pc. Wait, absolute magnitude is the apparent magnitude at 10 pc. So if it's 10 pc away, its apparent magnitude is the same as the absolute. So Star1's apparent V is 15.5. Comparing to the limits: 15.5 is less than 16, so it's brighter than 16 mag. Wait, but wait, no: in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So a magnitude of 15.5 is brighter than 16.0. So Star1's apparent V is 15.5, which is within both telescopes' capabilities. So ESPRESSO can see it (as it's brighter than 17) and HIRES can also see it (brighter than 16). So Star1 is a candidate for being detected by both.

Star2:
- Apparent V magnitude is 16.5. Oh, wait, that's higher than 16.0. Wait, higher magnitude means fainter. So 16.5 is fainter than 16. So Star2's apparent V is 16.5. ESPRESSO can handle up to 17, so 16.5 is okay for ESPRESSO. But HIRES only goes to 16. So 16.5 is too faint for HIRES. So Star2 can't be detected by both; only ESPRESSO maybe.

Star3:
- Apparent V magnitude is 15.5. But wait, there's E(B-V) = 0.6. Oh, right, extinction affects apparent magnitude. The formula is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So Av is 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86. So the star's actual apparent magnitude without extinction would be m0 = m - Av. Wait, no, wait: the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + Av. Oh wait, wait. No, I think I got this wrong. Let me think: when there's extinction, the observed apparent magnitude m is the true m (without extinction) plus the extinction Av. So m_observed = m_true + Av. So to get the true m, we subtract Av. Wait no, wait, the formula is m = M +5 log (d/10) + Av. Because M is the absolute magnitude, and m is apparent. So if the star is at distance d, then without extinction, m would be M +5 log (d/10). But extinction adds Av, so the observed m is higher.

Wait, no: M is the absolute magnitude, which is what the apparent magnitude would be at 10 pc with no extinction. So when a star is at distance d, its apparent magnitude without extinction is M +5 log(d/10). But with extinction, the observed m is larger (fainter) by Av. So m_observed = m_true + Av.

So for Star3, the given apparent magnitude is 15.5. But is that the observed m (including extinction) or the true m? The question says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag" — but I think that's the observed magnitude. But wait, if there's extinction, the apparent magnitude would be higher. So if the given m is 15.5, but the actual m without extinction (if no dust) would be lower. Wait, but the question states that Star3 has E(B-V)=0.6 and gives that Av=3.1*E(B-V)=1.86. So the star's intrinsic apparent magnitude would be m0 = m_observed - Av. Wait, no, the observed m is m0 + Av. So m_observed = m0 + Av → m0 = m_observed - Av.

Wait, wait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:

The formula for extinction in magnitudes is m_observed = m_true + Av. So if the star's true apparent magnitude (without extinction) is m_true, then the observed is m_true plus Av. So if E(B-V) is given, and Av=3.1*E(B-V), then the star's apparent magnitude as observed is m = m_true + Av.

Wait, but in the case of Star3, the given apparent magnitude is 15.5, which I think already includes the extinction. So if m_observed is 15.5, and m_true is m_observed - Av → 15.5 - 1.86 = 13.64. So the actual m_true is 13.64, but that's not relevant here because the question is about the observed apparent magnitude. Wait, no. Because the spectrographs detect the observed magnitude. So to check if the spectrograph can see it, we use the observed m. 

Wait, no, because if the observed m is 15.5, and the spectrograph's limit is 16.0, then Star3's observed m is 15.5, which is below (brighter than) 16. So the apparent magnitude of 15.5 is within HIRES's limit of 16. So Star3's observed m is 15.5, which is brighter than 16. So HIRES can see it, and ESPRESSO (limit 17) can see it. So Star3 is a candidate for both.

Wait, but wait: some sources say that when you have extinction (Av), the star appears fainter. So the observed magnitude is larger. So if a star's true apparent magnitude is m, the observed is m + Av. So for Star3, if the true m is, say, 15.5 -1.86 = 13.64, but the observed is 15.5. So the observed m is 15.5, which is brighter than 16. So HIRES can see it (since 15.5 <16), and ESPRESSO can see it (15.5 <17). So Star3 is observable by both.

Star4:
- Absolute V magnitude 15.5, distance 10 pc, E(B-V) =0.4. So first, what is the apparent magnitude without extinction? Since distance is 10 pc, the apparent magnitude without extinction is the same as absolute magnitude: 15.5. Now, compute the extinction. Av=3.1 * 0.4 =1.24. So the observed apparent magnitude m_observed is 15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Wait, wait: no, the formula is m = M + 5 log10 (d/10) + Av. Wait, distance is 10 pc, so log(10/10)=0. So m = M + 0 + Av. So M is 15.5, Av is 1.24. So m =15.5 +1.24 =16.74.

So Star4's observed apparent V magnitude is 16.74. Now, comparing to the limits. HIRES can't observe stars brighter than 16. So 16.74 is fainter (higher magnitude), so HIRES can't observe it. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so 16.74 is below 17, so ESPRESSO can see it. But for both, Star4 is only observable by ESPRESSO, so not both.

Star5:
- Absolute V magnitude is 16.5, and distance is 5 pc. So apparent magnitude without extinction is M +5 log(d/10). d=5, so log(5/10)=log(0.5)=-0.3010. So 5 * (-0.3010) = -1.505. So m = M +5 log(d/10) → 16.5 + (-1.505) = 14.995, approximately 15.0. So the apparent magnitude without extinction is 15.0. Now, any extinction? The problem says E(B-V)=0.4 mag, but wait, the question only mentions Star3 and Star4 as having E(B-V). Wait, checking the question again: Star5's description says nothing about E(B-V). So I think Star5 does not have extinction. So m_observed is 15.0.

So Star5's apparent magnitude is 15.0, which is brighter than both 16 and 17. So both HIRES and ESPRESSO can observe it. So Star5 is observable by both.

Wait, but wait: Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5, at 5 pc. So without extinction, m = M +5 log(d/10) → 16.5 +5*(log(5/10)) = 16.5 +5*(-0.3010) = 16.5 -1.505 ≈14.995. So m is about 15.0. So with no extinction, it's 15.0. So yes, Star5's apparent V is 15.0.

So now, let's list which stars are observable by both:

Star1: apparent m 15.5 → brighter than 16, so both can see it.

Star2: m 16.5 → only ESPRESSO can see it.

Star3: m 15.5 → both can see it.

Star4: m 16.74 → only ESPRESSO can.

Star5: m 15.0 → both can.

Wait, wait, no. Because Star5's star is at 5 pc, and its absolute magnitude is 16.5. So when calculating apparent magnitude, it's indeed 15.0. So m=15.0, which is below 16 (so both can observe).

Wait, but let me check Star5's details again. The question says 'Star5 - ... absolute V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us.' So correct, m=15.0.

So the stars that can be seen by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Wait, but wait: the options are given as choices. Let's look at the options.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5: no, because Star4's m is 16.74, which is too faint for HIRES.

B) Star3 and Star5: both have m below 16. So both can be observed by both spectrographs. So this option would be correct.

C) Star2 and Star3: Star2 has m=16.5 → only ESPRESSO can see it, so this option is wrong.

D) Star1 and Star4: Star1's m=15.5 → both can see, but Star4's m=16.74 → only ESPRESSO. So D is wrong.

Wait, but wait: earlier I thought Star5's m is 15.0, which is seen by both. But in the question, Star5's absolute magnitude is 16.5. So m is 15.0, which is within both.

So the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Looking at the options, option B says Star3 and Star5. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait: what about Star1. Let's recheck Star1.

Star1's absolute magnitude is 15.5, at 10 pc. So m =15.5, as M is the apparent at 10 pc. So m=15.5. Which is below 16, so both can observe.

Hmm, but the options don't include an option with Star1, Star3, Star5. The options are:
A) Star4 and Star5
B) Star3 and Star5
C) Star2 and Star3
D) Star1 and Star4

So according to this, only option B includes two stars (3 and 5) that are both within both spectrographs' limits.

Wait, but Star1's m is 15.5, which is within both. So why isn't it in any of the options? Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recalculate Star1's apparent magnitude.

Star1: absolute V magnitude 15.5, located at 10 pc. So m = M +5 log(d/10) → d=10, so log(10/10)=0. So m=15.5 + 0 =15.5. So its apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is brighter than 16. So both can see it.

So the stars that can be seen by both are Star1, Star3, Star5.

But the options don't include any option that includes Star1. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, looking back, I think the answer should be that Star1 and Star5 are both detected by both. But wait, the options don't have such an option. Let's think.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated Star1's m. Because Star1 is at 10 pc, but perhaps its absolute magnitude is 15.5. So yes, m=15.5.

So the options don't have any that include Star1 and Star5. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-examine the options. The options are:

A) Star4 and Star5
B) Star3 and Star5
C) Star2 and Star3
D) Star1 and Star4

So the only option where both stars are within both's limits is B) Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but Star1's m is 15.5, which is below 16, so it can be observed by both. But in the options, the only option with Star1 is D, which pairs it with Star4 (which can't be observed by HIRES). So why isn't Star1 included in any correct option?

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in considering that Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but with extinction, perhaps Star3's observed m is 15.5, which is acceptable.

Wait, no, let me recheck Star3. Star3's given apparent V is 15.5. But because it has E(B-V) =0.6, which gives Av=1.86. So the observed m is 15.5, which is 15.5. So that's the value to use. So it's acceptable for both.

Wait, another thought: when considering the apparent magnitude, the question says for Star3, the apparent V is 15.5. But that's after extinction? Or before? Because the value given is the apparent which includes extinction.

Wait, the problem says: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us. Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1."

So the apparent magnitude given is 15.5, which is what's observed (including extinction). So to determine the intrinsic apparent magnitude, we would subtract Av. But for the purposes of this question, since the spectrograph observes the apparent magnitude, that's what we should use.

So Star3's m is 15.5, which is below 16, so both can see it.

So in the options, B is Star3 and Star5, which are both acceptable.

So the correct answer is B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars, considering the telescopes' brightness limits. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17, while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤ 16 to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude = 15.5, distance = 10 pc.  
   - At 10 pc, the apparent V magnitude equals the absolute magnitude: \( m = 15.5 \).  
   - \( m = 15.5 \) is brighter than 16, so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.  

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude = 16.5, distance = 5 pc.  
   - \( m = 16.5 \) is fainter than 16, so HIRES cannot detect it. ESPRESSO can detect it.  

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude = 15.5, distance = 15 pc, \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \).  
   - Extinction in the V band: \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 1.86 \).  
   - The observed apparent magnitude already includes extinction, so \( m = 15.5 \).  
   - \( m = 15.5 \) is brighter than 16, so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.  

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude = 15.5, distance = 10 pc, \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \).  
   - At 10 pc, the apparent magnitude without extinction is \( m = 15.5 \).  
   - Extinction in the V band: \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 1.24 \).  
   - Observed apparent magnitude: \( m = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \).  
   - \( m = 16.74 \) is fainter than 16, so HIRES cannot detect it. ESPRESSO can detect it.  

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude = 16.5, distance = 5 pc.  
   - Apparent magnitude without extinction:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 - 1.505 \approx 15.0
     \]  
   - \( m = 15.0 \) is brighter than 16, so both ESPRESSO and HIRES can detect it.  

### Conclusion:
The stars detectable by both spectrographs are **Star1, Star3, and Star5**. Among the given options, only **Star3 and Star5** are correctly paired.  

**Correct Answer**:  
B) Star3 and Star5
