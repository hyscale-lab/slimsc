Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem states that the two astronauts have masses 2m and 3m, moving at 0.6c and 0.5c, respectively, in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed and the total energy.

Wait, right. In special relativity, velocities don't just add up normally. If you have two objects moving at speeds v1 and v2 relative to a rest frame, the speed of one relative to the other isn't just v1 - v2. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. The formula is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1*v2)/c²).

But wait, in this case, both are moving in the same direction. So astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, astronaut B at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, how fast is B moving? Let me think. Since they're moving in the same direction, the relative speed should be (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)). Let me compute that.

Wait, the formula is (v1 - v2) / [1 - (v1 v2)/c²]. Plugging in the numbers. v1 is 0.6c, v2 is 0.5c.

So numerator is 0.1c. Denominator is 1 - (0.6c *0.5c)/(c^2) = 1 - (0.3 c²)/(c²) = 1 -0.3 = 0.7.

So v_rel = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. Oh, so approximately 0.14c. Looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as their relative speed. So that's part of it.

Now, the total energy of the system. Wait, energy in relativity is the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut. The relativistic energy formula is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut, mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut, mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding these together: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C has E = 5.96 mc² and v_rel = 0.14c. Option D has E=5mc², which is lower. So the correct energy should be around 5.96 mc².

So the correct answer should be option C: v_rel ≈0.14c and E ≈5.96 mc².

Wait, just double-check the velocity addition. Oh yeah, because both are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (0.6 -0.5) / (1 - (0.6*0.5)/1 ) c. Wait, wait, no, it's (v1 - v2) / (1 - v1 v2/c²). So 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1 /0.7 = ~0.1428c, which is approximately 0.14c. So yes, that's correct.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed of the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed of two objects moving in the same direction at relativistic speeds is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator and denominator:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.1428c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of a relativistic object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]

\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]

\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
