Okay, so I've got this question about an organic chemistry problem, specifically related to NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized peptide. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says that the 1H NMR spectrum of the crude compound is mostly as expected, except for two peaks that correspond to the same alpha-proton. These peaks have similar chemical shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So, it's like the same proton is split into two, but the integrals together are correct. They ruled out spin-spin coupling because of the coupling pattern. Hmm, that's interesting.

Then, looking at the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature, there are two peaks of equal intensity. Both have the same mass spectrum, matching what's expected for the compound. So, it's not a different compound but something else with the same mass.

I remember that in NMR, if you have the same proton environment but two peaks, it could be due to exchange or some sort of splitting. Since coupling is ruled out, maybe it's something else causing the peaks. Wait, but the question says the peaks integrate correctly, so maybe it's a diastereomer or enantiomer. Oh wait, enantiomers would have the same NMR shifts because they're mirror images, so that's probably not it. Unless something is causing splitting.

Wait, the options are A to D. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. But LC-MS would show a different mass, right? Since the question says both peaks have the same mass as expected. So A is probably not the answer.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. But enantiomers would usually have identical NMR spectra because they're mirror images. So why would there be two peaks for the same proton? Maybe if there's some diastereomerism elsewhere, but the NMR shows the same alpha-proton. Hmm. Or maybe the enantiomers have different environments? No, in 1H NMR, enantiomers give the same peaks. So that's unlikely.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Wait, I'm not exactly sure about this. Could it be something to do with the formation of the amide bonds leading to some coupling? Maybe during the reaction, there's a situation where two different coupling partners are present, causing the alpha proton to split into two. But why would that cause two peaks with similar shifts? Also, the question says spin-spin coupling is ruled out, so maybe it's not this.

Option D: Mixture of diastereoisomers. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would differ. But in this case, the same alpha-proton is showing two peaks. Wait, diastereomers would have different chemical shifts. But the problem states the two peaks have similar shifts. Hmm, this seems a bit contradictory. Unless the diastereomers are such that the alpha-proton is in a similar environment but is split due to different neighboring groups.

Wait a minute. The NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. Another possibility is that the compound is a racemic mixture, but that would give one peak because enantiomers have the same NMR. Unless there's some other factor, like the presence of diastereomers.

Wait, but diastereomers would have different chemical shifts, right? So if two diastereomers are present, each with the same alpha-proton, but their shifts are similar enough to be close but separate. But the question says the two peaks have similar shifts, and their integrals add up to 1H. So each is about 0.5H. That could happen if the alpha-proton is split into two due to being in a different environment in each diastereomer.

But how would that happen? Maybe if the molecule has some sort of dynamic effect or if there's a mixture of diastereomers where the alpha-proton is in a different environment. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is in a state of flux, like a rapidly interconverting diastereomer, but that doesn't make much sense in NMR timescales.

Wait another thought: if the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass, that suggests that the two are isomers with the same molecular formula, perhaps diastereomers. Because if they had different masses, it would rule out that. So in the LC-MS, two peaks, same mass, same retention time? Or different retention times? The question says peaks at elevated temperature. Wait, in LC-MS, when you run at higher temps, diastereomers might separate because their retention times differ. Enantiomers would typically have same retention times in normal HPLC, but in chiral columns, they'd separate. But if the LC isn't chiral, then enantiomers would elute together, but diastereomers would split.

So the question says the LC-MS shows two peaks of equal intensity and same mass. So that's consistent with diastereomers, not enantiomers.

So going back to the NMR. If the molecule is a mixture of diastereomers, then each diastereomer would have their own set of NMR signals. But in this case, the same alpha-proton would be split into two different environments, giving two peaks.

Wait, but why are the shifts similar? Diastereomers can have different shifts but maybe in this case, the alpha-proton is in a similar environment, like adjacent groups causing slight shifts. Alternatively, maybe the diastereomers are in a way that the alpha proton's environment is not too different, hence the shifts are similar.

So putting it all together: the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton, same integral, same shift. The LC-MS shows two peaks same mass. So the most likely answer is diastereomers. So option D.

Wait, but let me think about the options again.

Option B is enantiomers. But that would not cause the NMR to split, unless... unless the compound has some sort of impurity that's a diastereomer, but I think that's not the case.

Wait, wait. The NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. So maybe the compound has a diastereomer mixture, which would have the same molecular weight but different physical properties, hence the two peaks in LC-MS.

In the NMR, each diastereomer would have their own set of peaks. But for a specific proton, like the alpha, if in each diastereomer, the alpha proton is in a slightly different environment, you could get two separate peaks. If the diastereomers are in a 1:1 ratio, then the integral would add up to 1H. So that makes sense.

So the correct answer is D: mixture of diastereoisomers.

The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound based on its 1H NMR and LC-MS data. The NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and integrals that add up to 1H. Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the explanation. The LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature reveals two peaks of equal intensity, both with the same mass consistent with the expected molecule.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: The compound is contaminated with a precursor**  
   This is unlikely because the LC-MS data shows two peaks with the same mass as the expected compound. A precursor would have a different mass, which is not observed here.

2. **Option B: The crude compound exists as a mixture of enantiomers**  
   Enantiomers have identical NMR spectra because they are mirror images of each other. Therefore, they would not produce two distinct peaks for the same alpha-proton, making this option inconsistent with the NMR data.

3. **Option C: 'Double coupling' has occurred during an amide-bond forming reaction**  
   The question explicitly states that spin-spin coupling is ruled out as an explanation. Additionally, "double coupling" during amide bond formation is not a common or well-defined phenomenon, making this option less plausible.

4. **Option D: The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers**  
   Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical properties, leading to distinct NMR signals. In this case, the two peaks in the NMR spectrum could arise from the same alpha-proton being in slightly different environments in each diastereomer. The LC-MS data, showing two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, supports the presence of diastereoisomers. This explanation aligns well with both the NMR and LC-MS observations.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation for the observed data is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
