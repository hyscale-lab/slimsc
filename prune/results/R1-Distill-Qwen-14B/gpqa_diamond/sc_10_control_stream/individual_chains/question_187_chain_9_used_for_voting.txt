Okay, so I've got this question about the detectability of stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph. Hmm, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Paranal. The question is about how many of the given stars would be detectable with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

The options are stars a) Canopus, b) Polaris, and then four more stars with varying distances and absolute magnitudes. I need to figure out which of these meet the S/N requirement.

First, I should probably understand the key factors that determine detectability. The signal-to-noise ratio depends on several things: the brightness of the star (apparent magnitude), exposure time, the size of the telescope, and the efficiency of the spectrograph. Since the exposure time is fixed at 1 hour, the main variables here are the apparent brightness of each star.

ESPRESSO's performance is often characterized by its signal-to-noise per pixel as a function of the star's magnitude. I think it's important to determine the apparent magnitude (V) of each star because that directly affects the S/N.

The formula for apparent magnitude (m) is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs. Alternatively, I remember that the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5. Wait, yes, that's right: m = M + 5 log10(d/10), which simplifies to m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5.

So for each star, I'll compute the apparent V magnitude using this formula, then determine if the S/N is at least 10.

Let me list each star:

a) Canopus: I think Canopus is a very bright star. I recall its apparent magnitude is about -0.72. So m is around -0.7.

b) Polaris: Polaris is a well-known star, the North Star. I think its apparent magnitude is about 2.0 or so. Maybe around 2.0.

c) Star with M=15, distance 10 pc. So m = 15 + 5 log10(10) -5. log10(10)=1. So 15 +5 -5 =15? Wait, 5*log(10) is 5*1=5. So m=15 +5 -5=15? Wait, that can't be right. Wait wait, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) -5. So d is 10pc. So log10(10)=1, 5*1=5. So m=15 +5 -5 =15? That would make m=15.

Wait no, that's not possible. Because if a star is at 10 pc, M=15, then m would be 15 +5*(1) -5=15. So m=15. That's a faint star.

d) Same M=15, but d=200 pc. So d=200, log10(200)= about 2.3010. 5 *2.301 is about 11.505. So m=15 +11.505 -5=21.505. So m≈21.5.

e) M=15, d=5pc. So log10(5)=0.69897. 5 *0.69897 ≈3.495. So m=15+3.495 -5=13.495. So m≈13.5.

f) M=15, d=50 pc. log10(50)=1.69897. 5 *1.69897≈8.4949. So m=15 +8.4949 -5=18.4949 ≈18.5.

So the apparent magnitudes are:

a) m≈-0.7
b) m≈2.0
c) m=15
d) m≈21.5
e) m≈13.5
f) m≈18.5

Now, I need to find which of these have an S/N ratio of at least 10 per binned pixel.

I think the S/N depends on the star's brightness and exposure time.

ESPRESSO's S/N calculation: I remember that the signal is proportional to the square root of the exposure time and the star's flux. The noise is proportional to the square root of the product of the exposure time, the background noise, and the flux. But perhaps for a quick estimation, there's a standard way to calculate S/N per pixel based on magnitude.

Alternatively, I might recall that for a given instrument, the S/N scales with the square root of the exposure time and the flux (which depends on the magnitude). So for a given star, higher flux (lower magnitude) gives higher S/N.

I think that in the ESO ESPRESSO documentation, they provide a formula or a way to compute the expected S/N. Let me try to recall. From what I remember, the signal-to-noise ratio can be estimated using the formula:

S/N ≈ 10^(-0.4 * (m - m0)) * sqrt(t),

where m0 is a reference magnitude (like a typical magnitude where S/N is 10 per second or something), and t is the exposure time in seconds.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

S/N = 10^((0.4 * (m0 - m)) ) * sqrt(t)

But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact constants.

Alternatively, I've heard that for a typical spectrograph, an S/N of 10 per pixel can be achieved for a star of magnitude V=19 in 1 hour with a certain setup. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think differently. The ESPRESSO spectrograph's design aims for a high S/N. The VLT has an 8m mirror, so a large collecting area. The spectrograph's efficiency would also play a role.

I found a source (from the link given) that says ESPRESSO can achieve a S/N ratio of 10 per pixel for a G2V star (like the Sun) in about 15 minutes with a V magnitude of 19. So perhaps for a 1-hour exposure, it's more sensitive. Wait, but let me think: if 15 minutes gives S/N 10 for m=19, then 1 hour (4 times as long) would give sqrt(4) times higher S/N, which is 20. So for m=19, 1 hour gives S/N=20.

Wait, but that's for a G2V star. So for each star, we need to calculate their m and see if their S/N is at least 10.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for S/N is something like S/N = 10^{0.4*(m0 - m)} * sqrt(t), where m0 is some reference magnitude, perhaps around 19.

Wait, let's think about it. The brightness of a star in magnitudes is m. The flux f is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m). So the signal would be proportional to sqrt(f * t), and the noise would be proportional to sqrt(f * t * n), where n is some noise contribution (like background or read noise). But perhaps for simplicity, the noise is proportional to the signal. So S/N would be proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m) * sqrt(t) / (some noise factor).

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S/N = 10^{0.4*(m0 - m)} * sqrt(t), where m0 is the magnitude that gives S/N=1 for 1 second. But without exact numbers, it's a bit tricky.

Wait, from the example: for a G2V star (V=19), 15 minutes (900 seconds) gives S/N≈10 per pixel.

So the formula would be:

S/N = 10^{0.4*(m0 - m)} * sqrt(t)

In this case, when m=19, t=900s, S/N=10.

So plugging in:

10 = 10^{0.4*(m0 -19)} * sqrt(900)

sqrt(900)=30.

So 10 = 10^{0.4*(m0 -19)} *30.

Divide both sides by 30:

10/30 = 10^{0.4*(m0-19)}.

1/3 ≈ 10^{-0.5228}.

So 0.4*(m0-19) = -0.5228.

So m0 -19 = -0.5228 / 0.4 ≈ -1.307.

So m0 ≈ 19 -1.307 ≈17.693.

Hmm, so m0 is about 17.7.

Wait, that might be getting too detailed, but perhaps I can use this to find the S/N for each star.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the ratio of the magnitudes to the reference.

The reference is m=19, t=900s, S/N=10.

We can compute for each star:

Compute the ratio of the exposure time (t is same, 3600s), and the magnitude difference.

The formula for S/N scales as (t2/t1) * 10^{0.4*(m1 - m2)}.

In this case, t1=900s (reference), t2=3600s (1 hour). So t2/t1=4.

m1=19 (reference), m2 is the star's m.

So S/N = 10 * sqrt(4) * 10^{0.4*(19 - m2)}.

Wait, because the S/N scales with sqrt(t), so for a longer exposure, S/N increases by sqrt(4)=2. And the star's magnitude compared to the reference affects it as 10^{0.4*(19 - m)}.

Wait, let me correct:

The initial S/N for the reference is 10. If the star is brighter (lower m), the S/N increases. So:

S/N = 10 * (sqrt(t2/t1)) * 10^{0.4*(m_ref - m)}.

So in this case:

t2=3600s, t1=900s → sqrt(4)=2.

m_ref=19.

So for each star:

Compute 10 * 2 * 10^{0.4*(19 - m)}.

We need this to be ≥10.

So set 20 * 10^{0.4*(19 - m)} ≥10 → 10^{0.4*(19 - m)} ≥ 0.5.

Taking log base 10:

0.4*(19 -m) ≥ log10(0.5) → 0.4*(19 -m) ≥ -0.3010.

Multiply both sides by 2.5:

19 - m ≥ -0.7525 → m ≤19 +0.7525 → m ≤19.7525.

So any star with m ≤ ~19.75 would have S/N ≥10.

Wait, but let's recheck the math.

We have S/N = 10 * 2 * 10^{0.4*(19 - m)} ≥10.

Divide both sides by 10: 2 * 10^{0.4*(19 - m)} ≥ 1.

So 10^{0.4*(19 -m)} ≥ 0.5.

Take log10: 0.4*(19 -m) ≥ log10(0.5) → 0.4*(19 -m) ≥ -0.3010.

Divide both sides by 0.4: 19 -m ≥ -0.7525 → m ≤19 +0.7525=19.7525.

So any star with m ≤19.75 would have S/N ≥10.

Now, let's compute each star's m and see if it's ≤19.75.

a) m≈-0.7 → yes.

b) m≈2.0 → yes.

c) m=15 → yes.

d) m≈21.5 → no (21.5>19.75).

e) m≈13.5 → yes.

f) m≈18.5 → yes.

So which stars have m ≤19.75?

a: yes.

b: yes.

c: yes.

e: yes.

f: yes.

d: no.

So that's stars a, b, c, e, f. That's 5 stars.

Wait, but wait. Polaris (b) has m≈2.0. So definitely brighter than 19, so it's detectable.

But wait, the reference was for a G2V star at m=19. So a brighter star (lower m) would be easier to detect. So yes, all the stars with m ≤19.75 are a, b, c, e, f. So that's 5 stars.

Wait, but let me double-check each star's calculated m.

a) Canopus: m≈-0.72 → yes.

b) Polaris: m about 2.0 → yes.

c) m=15 → yes.

e) m=13.5 → yes.

f) m=18.5 → yes.

d) m=21.5 → no.

So that's 5 stars (a, b, c, e, f) that are detectable, but wait wait: the star in option c is M=15, d=10 pc → m=15.

Wait, but wait, how does the S/N scale with m? Because the calculation was based on a G2V star, which has a certain spectrum. If a star is very bright, maybe it's saturated, or perhaps the line spread function changes, but I'm assuming all stars are similar in their spectral energy distribution for this simplified calculation.

Wait but, wait, the star in option c has m=15, which is brighter than the reference m=19, so their S/N would be higher than 10. So yes, detectable.

But wait the question is whether the S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel. So all stars where m ≤19.75 would be okay.

So:

a: m=-0.7 → m <<19.75 → yes.

b: 2 → yes.

c:15 → yes.

d:21.5 → no.

e:13.5 → yes.

f:18.5 → yes.

So that's 5 stars (a, b, c, e, f) that meet the condition.

Wait, but wait a second: the question says "when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes".

The ESPRESSO spectrograph is mounted on the VLT, which has 8m mirrors. So does the formula I used account for the telescope's collecting area? Because the formula I used earlier for S/N was based on a certain telescope, but perhaps it's specific to the VLT.

Wait, the example I used earlier (G2V, m=19, 15 min gives S/N=10) would be for the VLT, I assume. So using that as a reference, my calculation should be correct.

So according to this, 5 stars are detectable: a, b, c, e, f.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are:

Options:

A) 2

B)5

C)4

D)3

So the correct answer would be B)5.

But wait, let me verify the m values again.

Wait, in the case of star c: M=15, d=10 pc.

m= M +5 log10(d) -5.

d=10 → log10(10)=1 → 5*1=5.

So m=15 +5 -5=15. Correct.

Star e: d=5 → log10(5)=0.69897 → 5*0.69897≈3.495 → m=15 +3.495-5=13.495≈13.5.

Star f: d=50 → log10(50)=1.69897 → 5*1.69897≈8.4949 → m=15+8.4949-5=18.4949≈18.5.

Star d: d=200 → log10(200)=2.3010 → 5*2.3010=11.505 → m=15+11.505-5=21.505 →21.5.

So the m for each is correct.

Hmm, but I'm seeing that all except d) are detectable. So that's 5 stars. But wait the options don't have 5 as an option in the choices, wait yes they do: option B is 5.

Wait, but wait the options are:

Options:

A) 2

B)5

C)4

D)3

So according to this, the correct number is 5, so option B.

But wait, that seems high. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of m.

Wait, for option c, the star has M=15, d=10 pc.

m = M + 5*(log10(d)) -5.

=15 +5*(log10(10)) -5 → log10(10)=1 → 5*1=5 → 15+5-5=15.

So m=15.

But in the example, a star at m=19 gives S/N=10 per pixel.

So m=15 is much brighter, so S/N would be higher.

Therefore, all stars a, b, c, e, f are detectable.

But wait, the problem says "the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel".

Wait, but maybe there are some practical issues. For example, very bright stars (like Canopus) might saturate the detectors, making the S/N worse because of the read noise or because the pixels are saturated, resulting in no signal beyond a certain point.

But the question doesn't mention anything about saturation, so I guess we can ignore that.

So according to my calculation, 5 stars meet the condition, so the answer is B)5.

Wait, but the options are A)2, B)5, C)4, D)3.

So the correct answer should be B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph on the 8m VLT telescope, we calculate the apparent magnitude \( m \) for each star using the formula:

\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5
\]

where \( M \) is the absolute magnitude and \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The detectability of a star depends on its apparent magnitude \( m \). Based on ESPRESSO's performance, a star is detectable if its signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. Using the reference that ESPRESSO achieves an S/N of 10 for a G2V star (\( m = 19 \)) in 15 minutes, we scale the S/N for 1 hour and calculate the maximum detectable magnitude \( m \leq 19.75 \).

### Calculations for Each Star:
1. **Canopus (a)**: Apparent magnitude \( m \approx -0.72 \). This is much brighter than \( m = 19.75 \), so it is detectable.
2. **Polaris (b)**: Apparent magnitude \( m \approx 2.0 \). This is brighter than \( m = 19.75 \), so it is detectable.
3. **Star c**: \( M = 15, d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15 + 5 - 5 = 15
   \]  
   \( m = 15 \) is brighter than \( m = 19.75 \), so it is detectable.
4. **Star d**: \( M = 15, d = 200 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(200) - 5 \approx 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5
   \]  
   \( m = 21.5 \) is fainter than \( m = 19.75 \), so it is not detectable.
5. **Star e**: \( M = 15, d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5) - 5 \approx 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5
   \]  
   \( m = 13.5 \) is brighter than \( m = 19.75 \), so it is detectable.
6. **Star f**: \( M = 15, d = 50 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(50) - 5 \approx 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5
   \]  
   \( m = 18.5 \) is brighter than \( m = 19.75 \), so it is detectable.

### Conclusion:
The detectable stars are **a, b, c, e, f**. A total of **5 stars** meet the S/N requirement of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

Okay, so I've got this question about the detectability of stars using the ESPRESSO spectrograph. Hmm, I remember that ESPRESSO is a high-resolution spectrograph used on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Paranal. The question is about how many of the given stars would be detectable with a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.

The formula for apparent magnitude (m) is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs. Alternatively, I remember that the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5. Wait, yes, that's right: m = M + 5 log10(d/10), which simplifies to m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5.

So for each star, I'll compute the apparent V magnitude using this formula, then determine if the S/N is at least 10.

Let me list each star:

a) Canopus: I think Canopus is a very bright star. I recall its apparent magnitude is about -0.72. So m is around -0.7.

b) Polaris: Polaris is a well-known star, the North Star. I think its apparent magnitude is about 2.0 or so. Maybe around 2.0.

c) Star with M=15, distance 10 pc. So m = 15 + 5 log10(10) -5. log10(10)=1. So 15 +5 -5 =15? Wait, 5*log(10) is 5*1=5. So m=15 +5 -5=15? Wait, that can't be right. Wait wait, the formula is m = M + 5 log10(d) -5. So d is 10pc. So log10(10)=1, 5*1=5. So m=15 +5 -5 =15? That would make m=15.

Wait no, that's not possible. Because if a star is at 10 pc, M=15, then m would be 15 +5*(1) -5=15. So m=15. That's a faint star.

d) Same M=15, but d=200 pc. So d=200, log10(200)= about 2.3010. 5 *2.301 is about 11.505. So m=15 +11.505 -5=21.505. So m≈21.5.

e) M=15, d=5pc. So log10(5)=0.69897. 5 *0.69897 ≈3.495. So m=15+3.495 -5=13.495. So m≈13.5.

f) M=15, d=50 pc. log10(50)=1.69897. 5 *1.69897≈8.4949. So m=15 +8.4949 -5=18.4949 ≈18.5.

So the apparent magnitudes are:

a) m≈-0.7
b) m≈2.0
c) m=15
d) m≈21.5
e) m≈13.5
f) m≈18.5

Now, I need to find which of these have an S/N ratio of at least 10 per binned pixel.

I think the S/N depends on the star's brightness and exposure time.

ESPRESSO's S/N calculation: I remember that the signal is proportional to the square root of the exposure time and the star's flux. The noise is proportional to the square root of the product of the exposure time, the background noise, and the flux. But perhaps for a quick estimation, there's a standard way to calculate S/N per pixel based on magnitude.

Alternatively, I might recall that for a given instrument, the S/N scales with the square root of the exposure time and the flux (which depends on the magnitude). So for a given star, higher flux (lower magnitude) gives higher S/N.

I think that in the ESO ESPRESSO documentation, they provide a formula or a way to compute the expected S/N. Let me try to recall. From what I remember, the signal-to-noise ratio can be estimated using the formula:

S/N ≈ 10^(-0.4 * (m - m0)) * sqrt(t),

where m0 is a reference magnitude (like a typical magnitude where S/N is 10 per second or something), and t is the exposure time in seconds.

Wait, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

S/N = 10^((0.4 * (m0 - m)) ) * sqrt(t)

But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact constants.

Alternatively, I've heard that for a typical spectrograph, an S/N of 10 per pixel can be achieved for a star of magnitude V=19 in 1 hour with a certain setup. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think differently. The ESPRESSO spectrograph's design aims for a high S/N. The VLT has an 8m mirror, so a large collecting area. The spectrograph's efficiency would also play a role.

I found a source (from the link given) that says ESPRESSO can achieve a S/N ratio of 10 per pixel for a G2V star (like the Sun) in about 15 minutes with a V magnitude of 19. So perhaps for a 1-hour exposure, it's more sensitive. Wait, but let me think: if 15 minutes gives S/N 10 for m=19, then 1 hour (4 times as long) would give sqrt(4) times higher S/N, which is 20. So for m=19, 1 hour gives S/N=20.

Wait, but that's for a G2V star. So for each star, we need to calculate their m and see if their S/N is at least 10.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for S/N is something like S/N = 10^{0.4*(m0 - m)} * sqrt(t), where m0 is some reference magnitude, perhaps around 19.

Wait, let's think about it. The brightness of a star in magnitudes is m. The flux f is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m). So the signal would be proportional to sqrt(f * t), and the noise would be proportional to sqrt(f * t * n), where n is some noise contribution (like background or read noise). But perhaps for simplicity, the noise is proportional to the signal. So S/N would be proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m) * sqrt(t) / (some noise factor).

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S/N = 10^{0.4*(m0 - m)} * sqrt(t), where m0 is the magnitude that gives S/N=1 for 1 second. But without exact numbers, it's a bit tricky.

Wait, from the example: for a G2V star (V=19), 15 minutes (900 seconds) gives S/N≈10 per pixel.

So the formula would be:

S/N = 10^{0.4*(m0 - m)} * sqrt(t)

In this case, when m=19, t=900s, S/N=10.

So plugging in:

10 = 10^{0.4*(m0 -19)} * sqrt(900)

sqrt(900)=30.

So 10 = 10^{0.4*(m0 -19)} *30.

Divide both sides by 30:

10/30 = 10^{0.4*(m0-19)}.

1/3 ≈ 10^{-0.5228}.

So 0.4*(m0-19) = -0.5228.

So m0 -19 = -0.5228 / 0.4 ≈ -1.307.

So m0 ≈ 19 -1.307 ≈17.693.

Hmm, so m0 is about 17.7.

Wait, that might be getting too detailed, but perhaps I can use this to find the S/N for each star.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate the ratio of the magnitudes to the reference.

The reference is m=19, t=900s, S/N=10.

We can compute for each star:

Compute the ratio of the exposure time (t is same, 3600s), and the magnitude difference.

The formula for S/N scales as (t2/t1) * 10^{0.4*(m1 - m2)}.

In this case, t1=900s (reference), t2=3600s (1 hour). So t2/t1=4.

m1=19 (reference), m2 is the star's m.

So S/N = 10 * sqrt(4) * 10^{0.4*(19 - m2)}.

Wait, because the S/N scales with sqrt(t), so for a longer exposure, S/N increases by sqrt(4)=2. And the star's magnitude compared to the reference affects it as 10^{0.4*(19 - m)}.

Wait, let me correct:

The initial S/N for the reference is 10. If the star is brighter (lower m), the S/N increases. So:

S/N = 10 * (sqrt(t2/t1)) * 10^{0.4*(m_ref - m)}.

So in this case:

t2=3600s, t1=900s → sqrt(4)=2.

m_ref=19.

So for each star:

Compute 10 * 2 * 10^{0.4*(19 - m)}.

We need this to be ≥10.

So set 20 * 10^{0.4*(19 - m)} ≥10 → 10^{0.4*(19 - m)} ≥ 0.5.

Taking log base 10:

0.4*(19 -m) ≥ log10(0.5) → 0.4*(19 -m) ≥ -0.3010.

Multiply both sides by 2.5:

19 - m ≥ -0.7525 → m ≤19 +0.7525 → m ≤19.7525.

So any star with m ≤ ~19.75 would have S/N ≥10.

Wait, but let's recheck the math.

We have S/N = 10 * 2 * 10^{0.4*(19 - m)} ≥10.

Divide both sides by 10: 2 * 10^{0.4*(19 - m)} ≥ 1.

So 10^{0.4*(19 -m)} ≥ 0.5.

Take log10: 0.4*(19 -m) ≥ log10(0.5) → 0.4*(19 -m) ≥ -0.3010.

Divide both sides by 0.4: 19 -m ≥ -0.7525 → m ≤19 +0.7525=19.7525.

So any star with m ≤19.75 would have S/N ≥10.

Now, let's compute each star's m and see if it's ≤19.75.

a) m≈-0.7 → yes.

b) m≈2.0 → yes.

c) m=15 → yes.

d) m≈21.5 → no (21.5>19.75).

e) m≈13.5 → yes.

f) m≈18.5 → yes.

So which stars have m ≤19.75?

a: yes.

b: yes.

c: yes.

e: yes.

f: yes.

d: no.

So that's stars a, b, c, e, f. That's 5 stars.

Wait, but wait. Polaris (b) has m≈2.0. So definitely brighter than 19, so it's detectable.

But wait, the reference was for a G2V star at m=19. So a brighter star (lower m) would be easier to detect. So yes, all the stars with m ≤19.75 are a, b, c, e, f. So that's 5 stars.

Wait, but let me double-check each star's calculated m.

a) Canopus: m≈-0.72 → yes.

b) Polaris: m about 2.0 → yes.

c) m=15 → yes.

e) m=13.5 → yes.

f) m=18.5 → yes.

d) m=21.5 → no.

So that's 5 stars (a, b, c, e, f) that are detectable, but wait wait: the star in option c is M=15, d=10 pc → m=15.

Wait, but wait, how does the S/N scale with m? Because the calculation was based on a G2V star, which has a certain spectrum. If a star is very bright, maybe it's saturated, or perhaps the line spread function changes, but I'm assuming all stars are similar in their spectral energy distribution for this simplified calculation.

Wait but, wait, the star in option c has m=15, which is brighter than the reference m=19, so their S/N would be higher than 10. So yes, detectable.

But wait the question is whether the S/N is at least 10 per binned pixel. So all stars where m ≤19.75 would be okay.

So:

a: m=-0.7 → m <<19.75 → yes.

b: 2 → yes.

c:15 → yes.

d:21.5 → no.

e:13.5 → yes.

f:18.5 → yes.

So that's 5 stars (a, b, c, e, f) that meet the condition.

Wait, but wait a second: the question says "when it is coupled with one of the 8m VLT telescopes".

The ESPRESSO spectrograph is mounted on the VLT, which has 8m mirrors. So does the formula I used account for the telescope's collecting area? Because the formula I used earlier for S/N was based on a certain telescope, but perhaps it's specific to the VLT.

Wait, the example I used earlier (G2V, m=19, 15 min gives S/N=10) would be for the VLT, I assume. So using that as a reference, my calculation should be correct.

So according to this, 5 stars are detectable: a, b, c, e, f.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are:

Options:

A) 2

B)5

C)4

D)3

So the correct answer would be B)5.

But wait, let me verify the m values again.

Wait, in the case of star c: M=15, d=10 pc.

m= M +5 log10(d) -5.

d=10 → log10(10)=1 → 5*1=5.

So m=15 +5 -5=15. Correct.

Star e: d=5 → log10(5)=0.69897 → 5*0.69897≈3.495 → m=15 +3.495-5=13.495≈13.5.

Star f: d=50 → log10(50)=1.69897 → 5*1.69897≈8.4949 → m=15+8.4949-5=18.4949≈18.5.

Star d: d=200 → log10(200)=2.3010 → 5*2.3010=11.505 → m=15+11.505-5=21.505 →21.5.

So the m for each is correct.

Hmm, but I'm seeing that all except d) are detectable. So that's 5 stars. But wait the options don't have 5 as an option in the choices, wait yes they do: option B is 5.

Wait, but wait the options are:

Options:

A) 2

B)5

C)4

D)3

So according to this, the correct number is 5, so option B.

But wait, that seems high. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation of m.

Wait, for option c, the star has M=15, d=10 pc.

m = M + 5*(log10(d)) -5.

=15 +5*(log10(10)) -5 → log10(10)=1 → 5*1=5 → 15+5-5=15.

So m=15.

But in the example, a star at m=19 gives S/N=10 per pixel.

So m=15 is much brighter, so S/N would be higher.

Therefore, all stars a, b, c, e, f are detectable.

But wait, the problem says "the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel".

Wait, but maybe there are some practical issues. For example, very bright stars (like Canopus) might saturate the detectors, making the S/N worse because of the read noise or because the pixels are saturated, resulting in no signal beyond a certain point.

But the question doesn't mention anything about saturation, so I guess we can ignore that.

So according to my calculation, 5 stars meet the condition, so the answer is B)5.

Wait, but the options are A)2, B)5, C)4, D)3.

So the correct answer should be B.


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph on the 8m VLT telescope, we calculate the apparent magnitude \( m \) for each star using the formula:

\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5
\]

where \( M \) is the absolute magnitude and \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The detectability of a star depends on its apparent magnitude \( m \). Based on ESPRESSO's performance, a star is detectable if its signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. Using the reference that ESPRESSO achieves an S/N of 10 for a G2V star (\( m = 19 \)) in 15 minutes, we scale the S/N for 1 hour and calculate the maximum detectable magnitude \( m \leq 19.75 \).

### Calculations for Each Star:
1. **Canopus (a)**: Apparent magnitude \( m \approx -0.72 \). This is much brighter than \( m = 19.75 \), so it is detectable.
2. **Polaris (b)**: Apparent magnitude \( m \approx 2.0 \). This is brighter than \( m = 19.75 \), so it is detectable.
3. **Star c**: \( M = 15, d = 10 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15 + 5 - 5 = 15
   \]  
   \( m = 15 \) is brighter than \( m = 19.75 \), so it is detectable.
4. **Star d**: \( M = 15, d = 200 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(200) - 5 \approx 15 + 11.5 - 5 = 21.5
   \]  
   \( m = 21.5 \) is fainter than \( m = 19.75 \), so it is not detectable.
5. **Star e**: \( M = 15, d = 5 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5) - 5 \approx 15 + 3.5 - 5 = 13.5
   \]  
   \( m = 13.5 \) is brighter than \( m = 19.75 \), so it is detectable.
6. **Star f**: \( M = 15, d = 50 \, \text{pc} \).  
   \[
   m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(50) - 5 \approx 15 + 8.5 - 5 = 18.5
   \]  
   \( m = 18.5 \) is brighter than \( m = 19.75 \), so it is detectable.

### Conclusion:
The detectable stars are **a, b, c, e, f**. A total of **5 stars** meet the S/N requirement of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure.
