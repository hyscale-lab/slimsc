Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process.

The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Here, Pi(+) is at rest. Their rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I don't know the mass of the neutrino, but I remember that in particle physics, neutrinos are often considered to have negligible mass, especially in these types of problems. So I'll proceed under the assumption that the neutrino's mass is zero.

Wait a minute, but neutrinos actually have some mass, right? I think recent experiments showed that, but maybe here they're assuming it's zero for simplicity. Hmm, but if the mass is not zero, that complicates things. Well, perhaps in this problem, it's okay to take the neutrino mass as zero. Let me see.

So, to find the kinetic energies of the products, which are the muon and the neutrino. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me denote the muon's momentum as p and the neutrino's as -p. But wait, if the neutrino has zero mass, its energy would just be equal to its momentum (since for massless particles, E = |p| * c, but since we're using MeV and considering c=1 in these units, E = |p|).

So, for the muon, its total energy is its rest energy plus kinetic energy. The rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu.

For the neutrino, since it's massless, E_nu = |p|.

Now, the total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. So the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino must equal this.

So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

Substituting E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu and E_nu = p (since E depends on p), and knowing that p for the muon is sqrt( (K_mu)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2, but wait, that's in terms of momentum. Let me think again.

Wait, the muon's momentum can be expressed in terms of its kinetic energy. The total energy E_mu is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2, but maybe I'm complicating things. Alternatively, since E_mu = K_mu + m_mu c^2, and E_mu squared is (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2.

Wait, perhaps we can set up energy and momentum conservation equations.

Energy conservation: E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c^2.

Momentum conservation: p_mu = p_nu.

But the neutrino is massless, so E_nu = p_nu c (since E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2, and m=0).

Wait, but units here might be a bit tricky. Let me assume that c=1 in these units, so E_nu = p_nu.

Let me write the equations:

1) Energy: (m_mu + K_mu) / c^2 + p_nu = m_pi / c^2.

Wait, no. Wait, because E is in MeV, and c=1 in these units, so E_mu = m_mu + K_mu, where m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c², and K_mu is the kinetic energy in MeV.

Wait, no, because E = γ m c². So if c=1, E = γ m, where m is in MeV/c², and E in MeV. So for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 c^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the terms. Let me think again.

Let me approach this with units where c=1. Then, E² = p² + m², where E is in MeV, p in MeV/c (but with c=1, p is in MeV). Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, maybe I should better stick with natural units where c=1, so E is in MeV, p is in MeV (since E = pc when m=0), and m is in MeV (as m c²). So, for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), where m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

The neutrino is massless, so E_nu = p_nu = p (since it's moving in the opposite direction to the muon, so p_nu = -p_mu. But since energy is a scalar, E_nu = |p|).

So the energy and momentum conservation equations are:

Energy: E_mu + E_nu = m_pi.

Momentum: p_mu = -p_nu.

Wait, but in the direction of choice, p_mu is positive, p_nu is negative. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

So, substituting E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p.

So:

sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6.

That's the equation I need to solve for p.

Let me write this as:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p.

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p².

So:

p² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6*p + p².

The p² terms on both sides cancel out.

So:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6*p.

Let me calculate the numerical values.

105.7 squared: 105.7 * 105.7. Let's compute that. 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and cross term is 2*100*5.7=1140. So, (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49.

139.6 squared: 139^2 is 19321, 0.6^2 is 0.36, cross term 2*139*0.6 = 166.8. So (139.6)^2 = (139 +0.6)^2 = 139² + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6² = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19488.16.

So substituting:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 * 139.6 * p.

Let me compute 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 * p.

Rearranging:

279.2 * p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49. Let's do this step by step.

19488.16 minus 11172.49:

19488.16
-11172.49
----------
= 8315.67.

So 279.2 * p = 8315.67.

Solving for p:

p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute this division. 279.2 into 8315.67.

First, approximate: 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 30 - (60.33/279.2). Let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

279.2 * 30 = 8376. So 29.8 is 30 - 0.2. So 279.2 * 0.2 = 55.84. So 279.2 *29.8 = 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16.

Wait, 8320.16 is close to 8315.67. So the difference is 8315.67 - 8320.16 = -4.49. So 29.8 is a bit high.

Wait, perhaps 29.78.

279.2 * 29.78 = ?

Hmm, maybe using calculator approach: 279.2 * 29.78.

Wait, perhaps I should do 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute:

279.2 * 29.7 = ?

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 - 279.2 = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

279.2 * 0.7 = 195.44.

So 29.7 → 8096.8 +195.44 = 8292.24.

But 279.2 * 29.7 = 8292.24.

We have 8315.67 - 8292.24 = 23.43.

So 23.43 /279.2 ≈ 0.084.

So p ≈ 29.7 + 0.084 = 29.784.

So p ≈ 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but wait: I thought E_nu is p. So E_nu is approximately 29.78 MeV. But looking at the options, let's check.

Wait, let me go back. The options are for the kinetic energies of the products. So the muon's kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu. Because E_mu = K_mu + m_mu.

E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). So K_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) - m_mu.

So let's compute that.

p is approximately 29.78 MeV.

So p^2 ≈ (29.78)^2 ≈ 886.8.

m_mu^2 is (105.7)^2 = 11172.49.

So p^2 + m_mu^2 ≈ 886.8 + 11172.49 = 12059.29.

sqrt(12059.29) = 109.81 MeV.

So E_mu = 109.81 MeV.

Then, K_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

Wait, that's approximately 4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is p ≈29.78 MeV. Since it's massless, its kinetic energy is the same as its total energy, so K_nu = 29.78 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.11 MeV (muon) and 29.78 MeV (neutrino).

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close to our calculation. So the answer should be D.

Wait a second, but wait. Did I make any mistake in the calculation? Let me check.

Wait, in the initial equation: E_mu + E_nu = m_pi.

We set E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu²), and E_nu = p.

So sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi.

Wait, but m_pi is 139.6, m_mu is 105.7.

So when I rearranged, I had sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = m_pi - p.

Then square both sides: p² + m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p + p².

Yes, that's correct.

Then m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p.

So 2 m_pi p = m_pi² - m_mu².

So p = [m_pi² - m_mu²]/(2 m_pi).

Wait, perhaps I should have used this formula instead of going through the algebra. Let me compute that.

Compute m_pi² = (139.6)^2 = 19488.16.

m_mu² = (105.7)^2 =11172.49.

m_pi² - m_mu² = 19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67.

So p= 8315.67 / (2 *139.6) = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV.

So that's correct.

Then E_mu = sqrt(29.78² +105.7²).

Let me calculate 29.78^2: 29^2 is 841, 0.78^2 is ~0.6, cross term 2*29*0.78=45. So 29.78^2 ≈ 886.8.

So sqrt(886.8 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.29) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So K_mu =109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

So the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV, which is its kinetic energy.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which is very close. So that's the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]  
Here, the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, and the total initial momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the momenta of the muon (\(\mu^+\)) and neutrino (\(\nu\)) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Additionally, the total energy before and after the decay must be conserved.

### Key Equations:
1. **Energy Conservation:**  
   \[
   E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = m_{\pi} c^2
   \]  
   where \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}\) (total energy of the muon), \(E_{\nu} = p\) (neutrino energy, as it is massless), and \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\), \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\).

2. **Momentum Conservation:**  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}
   \]  
   This ensures the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta.

### Solving for \(p\):
From energy conservation:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = m_{\pi}
\]  
Rearranging:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = m_{\pi} - p
\]  
Squaring both sides:  
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = (m_{\pi} - p)^2
\]  
Expanding the right-hand side:  
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p + p^2
\]  
Canceling \(p^2\) and rearranging:  
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p
\]  
Solving for \(p\):  
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 m_{\pi}}
\]  

### Substituting Values:
- \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\), \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\).
- \(m_{\pi}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2\), \(m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2\).
- \(m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 \, \text{MeV}^2\).
- \(p = \frac{8315.67}{2 \times 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\).

### Calculating Kinetic Energies:
1. **Muon's Total Energy:**  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}
   \]  
   Substituting \(p^2 = 29.78^2 \approx 886.8\) and \(m_{\mu}^2 = 11172.49\):  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{886.8 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.29} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   The muon's kinetic energy is:  
   \[
   K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy:**  
   Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy equals its kinetic energy:  
   \[
   K_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.11 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.78 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**Option D:** \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\).

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle physics, and I'm a bit new to this, but let's try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a certain decay process.

The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. Here, Pi(+) is at rest. Their rest masses are given: Pi(+) is 139.6 MeV, and mu(+) is 105.7 MeV. I don't know the mass of the neutrino, but I remember that in particle physics, neutrinos are often considered to have negligible mass, especially in these types of problems. So I'll proceed under the assumption that the neutrino's mass is zero.

Wait a minute, but neutrinos actually have some mass, right? I think recent experiments showed that, but maybe here they're assuming it's zero for simplicity. Hmm, but if the mass is not zero, that complicates things. Well, perhaps in this problem, it's okay to take the neutrino mass as zero. Let me see.

So, to find the kinetic energies of the products, which are the muon and the neutrino. Since the pion is at rest, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.

Let me denote the muon's momentum as p and the neutrino's as -p. But wait, if the neutrino has zero mass, its energy would just be equal to its momentum (since for massless particles, E = |p| * c, but since we're using MeV and considering c=1 in these units, E = |p|).

So, for the muon, its total energy is its rest energy plus kinetic energy. The rest energy is 105.7 MeV, so E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu.

For the neutrino, since it's massless, E_nu = |p|.

Now, the total energy before decay is just the rest mass energy of the pion, which is 139.6 MeV. So the sum of the energies of the muon and neutrino must equal this.

So, E_mu + E_nu = 139.6 MeV.

Substituting E_mu = 105.7 + K_mu and E_nu = p (since E depends on p), and knowing that p for the muon is sqrt( (K_mu)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2, but wait, that's in terms of momentum. Let me think again.

Wait, the muon's momentum can be expressed in terms of its kinetic energy. The total energy E_mu is sqrt( (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2, but maybe I'm complicating things. Alternatively, since E_mu = K_mu + m_mu c^2, and E_mu squared is (p c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2.

Wait, perhaps we can set up energy and momentum conservation equations.

Energy conservation: E_mu + E_nu = m_pi c^2.

Momentum conservation: p_mu = p_nu.

But the neutrino is massless, so E_nu = p_nu c (since E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2, and m=0).

Wait, but units here might be a bit tricky. Let me assume that c=1 in these units, so E_nu = p_nu.

Let me write the equations:

1) Energy: (m_mu + K_mu) / c^2 + p_nu = m_pi / c^2.

Wait, no. Wait, because E is in MeV, and c=1 in these units, so E_mu = m_mu + K_mu, where m_mu is 105.7 MeV/c², and K_mu is the kinetic energy in MeV.

Wait, no, because E = γ m c². So if c=1, E = γ m, where m is in MeV/c², and E in MeV. So for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( p_mu^2 c^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2 ) / c^2? Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the terms. Let me think again.

Let me approach this with units where c=1. Then, E² = p² + m², where E is in MeV, p in MeV/c (but with c=1, p is in MeV). Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, maybe I should better stick with natural units where c=1, so E is in MeV, p is in MeV (since E = pc when m=0), and m is in MeV (as m c²). So, for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), where m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

The neutrino is massless, so E_nu = p_nu = p (since it's moving in the opposite direction to the muon, so p_nu = -p_mu. But since energy is a scalar, E_nu = |p|).

So the energy and momentum conservation equations are:

Energy: E_mu + E_nu = m_pi.

Momentum: p_mu = -p_nu.

Wait, but in the direction of choice, p_mu is positive, p_nu is negative. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

So, substituting E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), and E_nu = p.

So:

sqrt( p^2 + (105.7)^2 ) + p = 139.6.

That's the equation I need to solve for p.

Let me write this as:

sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p.

Now, square both sides to eliminate the square root:

p² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6*p + p².

So:

p² + 105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6*p + p².

The p² terms on both sides cancel out.

So:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6*p.

Let me calculate the numerical values.

105.7 squared: 105.7 * 105.7. Let's compute that. 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and cross term is 2*100*5.7=1140. So, (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 +32.49= 11172.49.

139.6 squared: 139^2 is 19321, 0.6^2 is 0.36, cross term 2*139*0.6 = 166.8. So (139.6)^2 = (139 +0.6)^2 = 139² + 2*139*0.6 + 0.6² = 19321 + 166.8 + 0.36 = 19488.16.

So substituting:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 * 139.6 * p.

Let me compute 2 * 139.6 = 279.2.

So:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 * p.

Rearranging:

279.2 * p = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 - 11172.49. Let's do this step by step.

19488.16 minus 11172.49:

19488.16
-11172.49
----------
= 8315.67.

So 279.2 * p = 8315.67.

Solving for p:

p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute this division. 279.2 into 8315.67.

First, approximate: 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 30 - (60.33/279.2). Let me compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Wait, 279.2 * 29.8 = ?

279.2 * 30 = 8376. So 29.8 is 30 - 0.2. So 279.2 * 0.2 = 55.84. So 279.2 *29.8 = 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16.

Wait, 8320.16 is close to 8315.67. So the difference is 8315.67 - 8320.16 = -4.49. So 29.8 is a bit high.

Wait, perhaps 29.78.

279.2 * 29.78 = ?

Hmm, maybe using calculator approach: 279.2 * 29.78.

Wait, perhaps I should do 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute:

279.2 * 29.7 = ?

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 * 30 - 279.2 = 8376 - 279.2 = 8096.8.

279.2 * 0.7 = 195.44.

So 29.7 → 8096.8 +195.44 = 8292.24.

But 279.2 * 29.7 = 8292.24.

We have 8315.67 - 8292.24 = 23.43.

So 23.43 /279.2 ≈ 0.084.

So p ≈ 29.7 + 0.084 = 29.784.

So p ≈ 29.78 MeV.

Wait, but wait: I thought E_nu is p. So E_nu is approximately 29.78 MeV. But looking at the options, let's check.

Wait, let me go back. The options are for the kinetic energies of the products. So the muon's kinetic energy is E_mu - m_mu. Because E_mu = K_mu + m_mu.

E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2). So K_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) - m_mu.

So let's compute that.

p is approximately 29.78 MeV.

So p^2 ≈ (29.78)^2 ≈ 886.8.

m_mu^2 is (105.7)^2 = 11172.49.

So p^2 + m_mu^2 ≈ 886.8 + 11172.49 = 12059.29.

sqrt(12059.29) = 109.81 MeV.

So E_mu = 109.81 MeV.

Then, K_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

Wait, that's approximately 4.11 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is p ≈29.78 MeV. Since it's massless, its kinetic energy is the same as its total energy, so K_nu = 29.78 MeV.

So the kinetic energies are approximately 4.11 MeV (muon) and 29.78 MeV (neutrino).

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close to our calculation. So the answer should be D.

Wait a second, but wait. Did I make any mistake in the calculation? Let me check.

Wait, in the initial equation: E_mu + E_nu = m_pi.

We set E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu²), and E_nu = p.

So sqrt(p² + m_mu²) + p = m_pi.

Wait, but m_pi is 139.6, m_mu is 105.7.

So when I rearranged, I had sqrt(p² + m_mu²) = m_pi - p.

Then square both sides: p² + m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p + p².

Yes, that's correct.

Then m_mu² = m_pi² - 2 m_pi p.

So 2 m_pi p = m_pi² - m_mu².

So p = [m_pi² - m_mu²]/(2 m_pi).

Wait, perhaps I should have used this formula instead of going through the algebra. Let me compute that.

Compute m_pi² = (139.6)^2 = 19488.16.

m_mu² = (105.7)^2 =11172.49.

m_pi² - m_mu² = 19488.16 -11172.49 = 8315.67.

So p= 8315.67 / (2 *139.6) = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.78 MeV.

So that's correct.

Then E_mu = sqrt(29.78² +105.7²).

Let me calculate 29.78^2: 29^2 is 841, 0.78^2 is ~0.6, cross term 2*29*0.78=45. So 29.78^2 ≈ 886.8.

So sqrt(886.8 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.29) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So K_mu =109.81 -105.7=4.11 MeV.

So the neutrino's energy is 29.78 MeV, which is its kinetic energy.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV, which is very close. So that's the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process:

**Reaction:**  
\[
\pi^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ + \nu
\]  
Here, the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, and the total initial momentum is zero. By conservation of momentum, the momenta of the muon (\(\mu^+\)) and neutrino (\(\nu\)) must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Additionally, the total energy before and after the decay must be conserved.

### Key Equations:
1. **Energy Conservation:**  
   \[
   E_{\mu} + E_{\nu} = m_{\pi} c^2
   \]  
   where \(E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}\) (total energy of the muon), \(E_{\nu} = p\) (neutrino energy, as it is massless), and \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\), \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\).

2. **Momentum Conservation:**  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}
   \]  
   This ensures the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta.

### Solving for \(p\):
From energy conservation:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} + p = m_{\pi}
\]  
Rearranging:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = m_{\pi} - p
\]  
Squaring both sides:  
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = (m_{\pi} - p)^2
\]  
Expanding the right-hand side:  
\[
p^2 + m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p + p^2
\]  
Canceling \(p^2\) and rearranging:  
\[
m_{\mu}^2 = m_{\pi}^2 - 2 m_{\pi} p
\]  
Solving for \(p\):  
\[
p = \frac{m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2}{2 m_{\pi}}
\]  

### Substituting Values:
- \(m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\), \(m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\).
- \(m_{\pi}^2 = 139.6^2 = 19488.16 \, \text{MeV}^2\), \(m_{\mu}^2 = 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \, \text{MeV}^2\).
- \(m_{\pi}^2 - m_{\mu}^2 = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67 \, \text{MeV}^2\).
- \(p = \frac{8315.67}{2 \times 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}\).

### Calculating Kinetic Energies:
1. **Muon's Total Energy:**  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2}
   \]  
   Substituting \(p^2 = 29.78^2 \approx 886.8\) and \(m_{\mu}^2 = 11172.49\):  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{886.8 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.29} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   The muon's kinetic energy is:  
   \[
   K_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

2. **Neutrino's Kinetic Energy:**  
   Since the neutrino is massless, its total energy equals its kinetic energy:  
   \[
   K_{\nu} = E_{\nu} = p \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]

### Final Answer:
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.11 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.78 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**Option D:** \(4.12 \, \text{MeV}, 29.8 \, \text{MeV}\).
