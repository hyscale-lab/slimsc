Okay, so I've got this NMR and LC-MS question here. Hmm, let's try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to piece it together.

The question says that the 1H NMR of a crude peptidic compound looks mostly like what's expected, except there are two peaks for the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar chemical shifts and roughly equal integrals, adding up to 1H. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So, what's causing these two peaks?

Wait, so each alpha proton is usually a triplet or something, but here it's split into two. But why? If it's the same proton, maybe there's some kind of splitting due to something else. The question says coupling is ruled out, so it's not because of neighboring protons. So maybe the issue is with the molecule's structure, not the neighboring groups.

Looking at the LC-MS part: the LC shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. So, same molecular weight. Hmm. So same mass, same retention time? Or same mass but different retention times? Wait, the question says the two peaks have the same mass spectrum. So same molecular weight. But in the same run, they're separate, but same mass. So it's not a different isomer or something with a different mass.

Wait, but the same mass. So maybe they're diastereomers or enantiomers? Because enantiomers have the same molecular weight but different chromatographic behaviors. But wait, in LC, enantiomers can sometimes elute at the same time if the column isn't chiral. But the question says LC-MS at elevated temperature shows two peaks. Oh wait, maybe the column is chiral, so enantiomers would separate. Or maybe it's a different scenario.

Wait, the question says the LC-MS shows two peaks, same mass. So same molecular formula, same exact mass. So they're either enantiomers or diastereomers. Because those would have the same molecular mass.

Now, the NMR shows two peaks for the same proton. So for that proton, there's a splitting into two. But why would that happen? Because in the molecule, the environment of that proton is changing.

If the compound is a mixture of enantiomers, then for each proton, the environment in one enantiomer is the mirror image of the other. But in an enantiomer, each proton's chemical shift is the same as its mirror counterpart. So if the molecule is a racemic mixture, the NMR would show the same signal, because the two enantiomers are mirror images and their protons would have the same shift. Wait, unless the NMR is run on a chiral column or something? No, NMR is in solution, so enantiomers would give the same spectrum. So that can't be it, because the NMR shows two peaks. So option B might not explain the NMR part.

What about diastereomers? Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would split into separate signals. So if you have a mixture of diastereomers, each with the same alpha-proton in a different environment, you'd see separate peaks. But wait, in this case, the two peaks for the same alpha-proton have similar shifts. Diastereomers would have different shifts, perhaps more distinct. So maybe not.

Wait, but the question says the two peaks have similar chemical shifts. Maybe the diastereomers are close in structure, so that the alpha-proton's environment isn't too different, leading to similar shifts. But if that's the case, the integrals would add to 1H, which is what the question says.

But then, what about the LC-MS? Two peaks with same mass. Diastereomers have same molecular weight, so that would fit. So option D says the compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers. That could fit both the NMR and the LC-MS observations.

Wait, but wait, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. Let's think about diastereomers. Suppose you have two diastereomers where the alpha-proton is in the same position but in different configurations. So for each diastereomer, the alpha-proton would give a different shift. But in the mixture, would you see two separate peaks for each? So for each diastereomer, their own set of peaks.

Wait, but the question says "two peaks that both correspond to the same alpha-proton." So in the NMR, same proton in two environments, leading to two separate signals.

So if the molecule is a diastereomeric mixture, each diastereomer would have their own set of protons. So for the alpha-proton in each, you would see two separate signals. Hence, the two peaks in NMR. So that makes sense.

But wait, when you have a diastereomer, each diastereomer is a distinct molecule. So in the NMR, each diastereomer's protons would be represented. So for each diastereomer, you have an alpha-proton, but if the two diastereomers have alpha-protons in slightly different environments (like different dihedral angles or something), you'd see two peaks for that proton.

So, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, but they're from two different diastereomers. The integrals add to 1H because together, they make up the same number of protons as the expected molecule. So that fits.

In the LC-MS, the same mass because they're diastereomers, different retention times because of differing structures, leading to different chromatographic behaviors. So two peaks, same mass. So option D seems plausible.

What about the other options? Option A says the compound is contaminated with a precursor. If that's the case, the NMR would show different shifts, perhaps more than two peaks. Also, the mass would be different, as the precursor would have a different molecular weight. So in LC-MS, the two peaks would have different masses, but the question says same mass. So probably not A.

Option C is 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not too familiar with that term. Maybe it refers to some kind of coupling that leads to two bonds? Or perhaps it's a situation where during the reaction, an additional bond forms, causing a splitting. Not sure. If it's a coupling issue, perhaps in the NMR, you might see more complex splitting patterns. But the question says coupling is ruled out as the cause, so it's not spin-spin coupling. So maybe option C refers to some other type of coupling. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's about the amide bonds leading to different coupling partners, but the question says it's ruled out. So perhaps C isn't the right answer.

So, putting it all together, the presence of two peaks in NMR with same integral and mass, but same alpha-proton, points to a diastereomeric mixture. So the answer should be D.

The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (adding up to 1H). Coupling is ruled out as the cause of the duplicate peaks. Additionally, LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature reveals two peaks of equal intensity, both with the same mass spectrum consistent with the expected molecule.

### Key Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A (Contamination with a precursor):**  
   If the compound were contaminated with a precursor, the NMR would likely show additional peaks corresponding to the precursor's protons, and the LC-MS would reveal peaks with a different mass. Since the LC-MS shows two peaks with the same mass, this option is unlikely.

2. **Option B (Mixture of enantiomers):**  
   Enantiomers have identical physical properties, so their NMR spectra would overlap, resulting in a single peak for each proton. Additionally, LC-MS would not separate enantiomers unless a chiral column is used, which is not mentioned in the question. Therefore, this option does not explain the observations.

3. **Option C ('Double coupling' during amide-bond formation):**  
   The question explicitly rules out spin-spin coupling as the cause of the duplicate peaks. While "double coupling" might refer to an alternative reaction-related phenomenon, the term is unclear and does not align well with the observations. This makes this option less plausible.

4. **Option D (Mixture of diastereoisomers):**  
   Diastereoisomers have different physical properties, leading to distinct NMR signals. In this case, the two peaks in the NMR correspond to the same alpha-proton in two different environments, consistent with a mixture of diastereoisomers. The LC-MS showing two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass further supports this explanation, as diastereoisomers have the same molecular weight but different chromatographic behaviors. This option aligns well with both the NMR and LC-MS data.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation for the observations is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.
