Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different parameters. I need to determine which of them can be observed by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The key information is about their apparent magnitudes because both instruments have different brightness limits.

Wait, the problem says ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag. So that means apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So anything with V mag ≤17 is detectable by ESPRESSO.

HIRES, on the other hand, can handle stars brighter than 16 V mag. Oh wait, no—the way the question is phrased, it says "brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO, brighter than 16 for HIRES." Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO", and "brighter than 16 V mag for HIRES." Wait, no, let me check again.

No, the question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." Oh wait, that's the opposite. So, if a star has an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17, it's observable by ESPRESSO. Since lower magnitudes are brighter, that means for ESPRESSO, apparent V magnitude should be less than or equal to 17. Similarly, for HIRES, apparent V mag must be ≤16, because "brighter than 16" means V mag <16, right? Wait, no. Wait, the magnitude scale is confusing. Let me clarify.

In the V magnitude system, lower numbers mean brighter. So when they say "brighter than 17 mag", that means V mag less than 17. So for a star to be observed by ESPRESSO, its apparent V must be ≤17. For HIRES, it has to be ≤16. So a star must have apparent V mag ≤16 to be seen by HIRES, and ≤17 to be seen by ESPRESSO.

So any star that can be observed by both needs to have apparent V ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Wait, no. Wait, no. Because if a star is ≤17, then for ESPRESSO it's okay, and if it's ≤16, then it's okay for HIRES. So the star must have apparent V ≤16 to be observable by both. Because both can't have V mag higher than 16 or 17. Wait, no. Because ESPRESSO's limit is higher (17), so any star with V ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. But HIRES can only see up to V=16. So any star that's observable by HIRES is automatically observable by ESPRESSO, but not vice versa.

So the star must have apparent V ≤16 to be detected by both.

So now I need to look at each star and calculate their apparent V magnitude. Wait, some of them have absolute magnitude given, so I need to calculate their apparent magnitude.

Let's go through each star.

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc.

Apparent V magnitude (m) can be calculated with the formula: m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs.

So m = 15.5 + 5 * log(10/10) = 15.5 +5*0 =15.5.

So apparent V is 15.5 mag. Since 15.5 is less than 16, it can be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES? Wait, because HIRES requires V ≤16, and Star1 is 15.5, which is ≤16. So HIRES can observe it. ESPRESSO can also observe it because 15.5 ≤17. So Star1 can be seen by both. But wait, looking at the options, the possible answers include Star1 and Star4, which is option D.

Wait, but let me check all stars.

Star2: Apparent V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc.

Wait, but does its absolute magnitude matter? Wait, no. The question gives Star2's apparent V as 16.5. So m=16.5. So can ESPRESSO and HIRES see it? ESPRESSO can (since 16.5 <17?), wait, no. Wait, 16.5 is more than 16. So for HIRES, which requires m ≤16, Star2's m is 16.5, which is higher. So HIRES can't see it. ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so 16.5 is okay for ESPRESSO. So Star2 can only be seen by ESPRESSO, not HIRES. So it's not a candidate for being detected by both.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, but there's E(B-V) =0.6 mag and located at 15 pc. Oh wait, but the star's apparent V is already given as 15.5. Wait, no. Oh no, wait, the problem says apparent V mag is 15.5, but there's extinction (E(B-V) = 0.6). Wait, so the observed (apparent) V mag is 15.5, but because of dust extinction, it's actually dimmer. Or wait, no. Wait, E(B-V) is the color excess, which accounts for interstellar reddening. The total absorption in V is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So Av =3.1 *0.6=1.86 mag.

So the star's true (intrinsic) apparent V without extinction would be m = 15.5 - Av? Wait, no. Wait, extinction makes stars appear fainter (higher magnitude). So the observed m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av. So the intrinsic apparent magnitude would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - Av.

So Star3's actual (intrinsic) apparent mag is 15.5 -1.86 =13.64. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because the star's distance is 15 pc. So perhaps I should recalculate the apparent magnitude including extinction.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me re-express.

Wait, the star's apparent magnitude is given as m =15.5, but there's extinction. So the observed magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v, where A_v is the extinction (3.1 * E(B-V)).

So the intrinsic apparent magnitude is m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_v.

So m_observed =15.5, A_v=1.86.

So m_intrinsic =15.5 -1.86 =13.64.

Wait, but m_intrinsic would be the apparent magnitude without extinction, right? But then, since the star is located at 15 pc, perhaps I should calculate its absolute magnitude from the intrinsic apparent magnitude and distance.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem gives Star3's apparent V mag as 15.5, but that's after extinction. So the actual apparent magnitude without extinction would be lower (brighter). But do I need to adjust the apparent magnitude to account for extinction to know if the star is within the instrument's limits?

Wait, because if the star is observed through interstellar medium, its apparent magnitude is higher (fainter) due to extinction. So to calculate whether the star is bright enough, I have to look at the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction), which would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_v.

So for Star3, m_observed is 15.5. A_v=1.86.

So m_intrinsic =15.5 -1.86=13.64.

So the intrinsic apparent magnitude is 13.64, which is well within both 17 and 16. So it's bright enough for both instruments. So Star3 can be detected by both. But wait, the options don't include Star3 and Star5. Let me see.

Wait, Star5's parameters: absolute magnitude 16.5, distance 5 pc. So let's compute its apparent V mag.

m = M +5 log10(d/10) =16.5 +5*log(5/10) =16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995 mag, approximately 15.0.

Wait, but Star5's apparent V mag is 15.0. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can see it, because 15.0 is ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES? No, wait, because 15.0 is less than 16, so HIRES can observe it, and so can ESPRESSO. So Star5 can be observed by both.

Wait, but let's look again at Star3. Its apparent V mag is 15.5, but after correcting for extinction, it's 13.64. So the actual brightness is 13.64, which is within both telescopes' detection limits. So both can observe Star3.

Wait, but what about Star4?

Star4: Absolute V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance 10 pc.

So first, calculate the apparent V mag without extinction. Using the formula:

m = M +5 log10(d/10) =15.5 +5*(log10(10/10))=15.5 +0=15.5.

Then, extinction (A_v) is 3.1 * E(B-V) =3.1 *0.4=1.24 mag.

So the observed apparent magnitude would be m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Ah, wait. So the observed apparent V mag is 16.74. This is higher than HIRES's limit (16) and higher than ESPRESSO's limit (17). Wait, no, because 16.74 is higher than 16 (for HIRES) but lower than 17? Wait, 16.74 is higher than 16, so for HIRES, which requires apparent V ≤16, Star4 can't be detected because 16.74>16.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. The problem says Star4's apparent V is 15.5, but considering extinction, perhaps I should calculate the observed magnitude, which would be m_observed = m_intrinsic +A_v.

Wait, no. Star4's parameters are: absolute V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4.

So first, compute the intrinsic apparent magnitude without extinction: m_intrinsic = M +5 log10(d/10) =15.5 +0=15.5.

Then, the extinction A_v=3.1*0.4=1.24.

So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v =15.5+1.24=16.74.

So Star4's apparent V is 16.74, which is higher than 16. So it's too faint for HIRES (which requires ≤16), but ESPRESSO can handle up to 17, so 16.74 is okay for ESPRESSO. So Star4 can only be seen by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

Wait, but that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So Star4's observed V is 16.74. So it can't be seen by HIRES but can be seen by ESPRESSO.

So which stars can be detected by both instruments?

Let's recap:

Star1: m=15.5. So within both.

Star2: m=16.5. Within ESPRESSO (≤17) but not HIRES (≤16).

Star3: m_observed=15.5, but after correcting for extinction, the intrinsic is 13.64. So the observed is 15.5, which is within both.

Wait, wait—wait a second. I think I messed up. The apparent V given for Star3 is 15.5, but we have to consider whether that's the observed or the intrinsic.

Wait, the problem states for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag."

So the apparent V mag is already the observed (extincted) magnitude. So m_observed =15.5.

But for the detection, do we need to correct for extinction to see if the star is bright enough?

Wait, no. Because the apparent magnitude given is the observed one, which includes extinction. So when the question says whether the star can be detected by the spectrographs, the magnitude used is the observed m. Because the spectrograph's limit is based on what we observe.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if a star is dimmer due to extinction, it's not as bright as it appears. So the apparent magnitude without extinction would be fainter (higher) or brighter (lower)?

Wait, extinction makes stars appear fainter, so higher apparent magnitude. So if a star's intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) is m_intrinsic, then the observed m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v.

So for example, suppose a star has m_intrinsic =10.0, and A_v =1.0. Then m_observed is 11.0.

But when it comes to detection, the telescope's limit is on the observed magnitude. So for a star to be detected, the observed m must be ≤ the limit.

So for Star3, m_observed is 15.5. So for HIRES, which requires m ≤16, 15.5 is okay. For ESPRESSO, m ≤17, also okay. So Star3 can be detected by both.

But wait, wait! Because E(B-V) is given, and the problem says to account for the total absorption in V. So the observed V is 15.5, but the intrinsic is 15.5 -1.86=13.64. Do the spectrographs' limits depend on the intrinsic V or the observed V?

No, the limits are based on the observed apparent V magnitude. Because that's what determines how much light we receive. So even if the star is intrinsically brighter, due to dust, it's dimmer as observed. So the observed magnitude is what matters for detection.

So for Star3, observed V is 15.5, which is within both 17 and 16. So yes, both can detect it.

Wait, but Star4's observed V is 16.74, which is above HIRES's 16 limit. So only ESPRESSO can see it.

Star5: absolute mag 16.5, distance 5 pc. Calculate m.

m =16.5 +5*log(5/10) =16.5 +5*(-0.3010) =16.5 -1.505=14.995, about 15.0.

So Star5's apparent V is 15.0, which is within both limits.

So which stars can be detected by both?

Looking at each:

Star1: m=15.5 → can be detected by both.

Star3: m=15.5 → can be detected by both.

Star5: m=15.0 → can be detected by both.

Wait, that's three stars. But the options don't include more than two. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let's check Star4 again. Star4's absolute V is 15.5, distance 10 pc.

So m_intrinsic =15.5 +5*log(10/10)=15.5.

E(B-V)=0.4 → Av=3.1*0.4=1.24.

So observed m=15.5+1.24=16.74. So higher than HIRES's limit (16) and within ESPRESSO's limit (17). So Star4 cannot be detected by HIRES, only by ESPRESSO.

So which stars are detectable by both:

Star1: m=15.5 → both can detect.

Star3: m=15.5 → both can detect.

Star5: m=15.0 → both can detect.

So the options are:

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES, so this is incorrect.

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES, so no.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → Both have m=15.5 (Star3) and 15.0 (Star5). Both are within both limits.

So Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both.

But wait, the options don't have an option with Star3 and Star5. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Both within limits.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 has m=16.5, which is within ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

So the correct answer would be option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but looking back, Star3's m is 15.5, which is within both. Star5's m is 15.0, also within both.

So option B is correct.

To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars and compare them to the detection limits of the instruments. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤17, while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \)  
   - Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5
     \]  
   - Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 15.5 \)  
   - Since \( 15.5 \leq 16 \), Star1 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 16.5 \)  
   - Since \( 16.5 > 16 \), Star2 cannot be detected by HIRES. It can only be detected by ESPRESSO.  

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 15.5 \)  
   - Extinction: \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \), \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 1.86 \)  
   - The observed apparent V magnitude is already given as \( m = 15.5 \), which includes extinction.  
   - Since \( 15.5 \leq 16 \), Star3 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \)  
   - Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)  
   - Intrinsic apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{intrinsic}} = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5
     \]  
   - Extinction: \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \), \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 1.24 \)  
   - Observed apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{observed}} = m_{\text{intrinsic}} + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - Since \( 16.74 > 16 \), Star4 cannot be detected by HIRES. It can only be detected by ESPRESSO.

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 16.5 \)  
   - Distance: \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \)  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
     \]  
   - Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 15.0 \)  
   - Since \( 15.0 \leq 16 \), Star5 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Conclusion:
- **Star1**: Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.  
- **Star2**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.  
- **Star3**: Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.  
- **Star4**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.  
- **Star5**: Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.  

The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star3 and Star5**.

Okay, so I've got this question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

The question gives me five stars, Star1 to Star5, each with different parameters. I need to determine which of them can be observed by both ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck. The key information is about their apparent magnitudes because both instruments have different brightness limits.

Wait, the problem says ESPRESSO can observe stars brighter than 17 V mag. So that means apparent V magnitude less than or equal to 17. Because in astronomy, lower magnitudes are brighter. So anything with V mag ≤17 is detectable by ESPRESSO.

HIRES, on the other hand, can handle stars brighter than 16 V mag. Oh wait, no—the way the question is phrased, it says "brighter than 17 mag for ESPRESSO, brighter than 16 for HIRES." Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says "stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed with ESPRESSO", and "brighter than 16 V mag for HIRES." Wait, no, let me check again.

No, the question says: "with ESPRESSO, stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag can be observed, while with HIRES, stars brighter than 16 V mag can be observed." Oh wait, that's the opposite. So, if a star has an apparent V magnitude brighter than 17, it's observable by ESPRESSO. Since lower magnitudes are brighter, that means for ESPRESSO, apparent V magnitude should be less than or equal to 17. Similarly, for HIRES, apparent V mag must be ≤16, because "brighter than 16" means V mag <16, right? Wait, no. Wait, the magnitude scale is confusing. Let me clarify.

For HIRES, it has to be ≤16. So a star must have apparent V mag ≤16 to be seen by HIRES, and ≤17 to be seen by ESPRESSO.

So any star that can be observed by both needs to have apparent V ≤16, because that's the stricter condition. Wait, no. Wait, no. Because if a star is ≤17, then for ESPRESSO it's okay, and if it's ≤16, then it's okay for HIRES. So the star must have apparent V ≤16 to be observable by both. Because both can't have V mag higher than 16 or 17. Wait, no. Because ESPRESSO's limit is higher (17), so any star with V ≤17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. But HIRES can only see up to V=16. So any star that's observable by HIRES is automatically observable by ESPRESSO, but not vice versa.

So the star must have apparent V ≤16 to be detected by both.

So now I need to look at each star and calculate their apparent V magnitude. Wait, some of them have absolute magnitude given, so I need to calculate their apparent magnitude.

Let's go through each star.

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc.

Apparent V magnitude (m) can be calculated with the formula: m = M + 5 log10(d/10), where d is distance in parsecs.

So m = 15.5 + 5 * log(10/10) = 15.5 +5*0 =15.5.

So apparent V is 15.5 mag. Since 15.5 is less than 16, it can be observed by both ESPRESSO and HIRES? Wait, because HIRES requires V ≤16, and Star1 is 15.5, which is ≤16. So HIRES can observe it. ESPRESSO can also observe it because 15.5 ≤17. So Star1 can be seen by both. But wait, looking at the options, the possible answers include Star1 and Star4, which is option D.

Wait, but let me check all stars.

Star2: Apparent V mag 16.5, distance 5 pc.

Wait, but does its absolute magnitude matter? Wait, no. The question gives Star2's apparent V as 16.5. So m=16.5. So can ESPRESSO and HIRES see it? ESPRESSO can (since 16.5 <17?), wait, no. Wait, 16.5 is more than 16. So for HIRES, which requires m ≤16, Star2's m is 16.5, which is higher. So HIRES can't see it. ESPRESSO can see up to 17, so 16.5 is okay for ESPRESSO. So Star2 can only be seen by ESPRESSO, not HIRES. So it's not a candidate for being detected by both.

Star3: Apparent V mag is 15.5, but there's E(B-V) =0.6 mag and located at 15 pc. Oh wait, but the star's apparent V is already given as 15.5. Wait, no. Oh no, wait, the problem says apparent V mag is 15.5, but there's extinction (E(B-V) = 0.6). Wait, so the observed (apparent) V mag is 15.5, but because of dust extinction, it's actually dimmer. Or wait, no. Wait, E(B-V) is the color excess, which accounts for interstellar reddening. The total absorption in V is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So Av =3.1 *0.6=1.86 mag.

So the star's true (intrinsic) apparent V without extinction would be m = 15.5 - Av? Wait, no. Wait, extinction makes stars appear fainter (higher magnitude). So the observed m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av. So the intrinsic apparent magnitude would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - Av.

So Star3's actual (intrinsic) apparent mag is 15.5 -1.86 =13.64. But wait, I'm a bit confused. Because the star's distance is 15 pc. So perhaps I should recalculate the apparent magnitude including extinction.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let me re-express.

Wait, the star's apparent magnitude is given as m =15.5, but there's extinction. So the observed magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v, where A_v is the extinction (3.1 * E(B-V)).

So the intrinsic apparent magnitude is m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_v.

So m_observed =15.5, A_v=1.86.

So m_intrinsic =15.5 -1.86 =13.64.

Wait, but m_intrinsic would be the apparent magnitude without extinction, right? But then, since the star is located at 15 pc, perhaps I should calculate its absolute magnitude from the intrinsic apparent magnitude and distance.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem gives Star3's apparent V mag as 15.5, but that's after extinction. So the actual apparent magnitude without extinction would be lower (brighter). But do I need to adjust the apparent magnitude to account for extinction to know if the star is within the instrument's limits?

Wait, because if the star is observed through interstellar medium, its apparent magnitude is higher (fainter) due to extinction. So to calculate whether the star is bright enough, I have to look at the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction), which would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - A_v.

So for Star3, m_observed is 15.5. A_v=1.86.

So m_intrinsic =15.5 -1.86=13.64.

So the intrinsic apparent magnitude is 13.64, which is well within both 17 and 16. So it's bright enough for both instruments. So Star3 can be detected by both. But wait, the options don't include Star3 and Star5. Let me see.

Wait, Star5's parameters: absolute magnitude 16.5, distance 5 pc. So let's compute its apparent V mag.

m = M +5 log10(d/10) =16.5 +5*log(5/10) =16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995 mag, approximately 15.0.

Wait, but Star5's apparent V mag is 15.0. So both ESPRESSO and HIRES can see it, because 15.0 is ≤17 for ESPRESSO and ≤16 for HIRES? No, wait, because 15.0 is less than 16, so HIRES can observe it, and so can ESPRESSO. So Star5 can be observed by both.

Wait, but let's look again at Star3. Its apparent V mag is 15.5, but after correcting for extinction, it's 13.64. So the actual brightness is 13.64, which is within both telescopes' detection limits. So both can observe Star3.

Wait, but what about Star4?

Star4: Absolute V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4, distance 10 pc.

So first, calculate the apparent V mag without extinction. Using the formula:

m = M +5 log10(d/10) =15.5 +5*(log10(10/10))=15.5 +0=15.5.

Then, extinction (A_v) is 3.1 * E(B-V) =3.1 *0.4=1.24 mag.

So the observed apparent magnitude would be m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v =15.5 +1.24=16.74.

Ah, wait. So the observed apparent V mag is 16.74. This is higher than HIRES's limit (16) and higher than ESPRESSO's limit (17). Wait, no, because 16.74 is higher than 16 (for HIRES) but lower than 17? Wait, 16.74 is higher than 16, so for HIRES, which requires apparent V ≤16, Star4 can't be detected because 16.74>16.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. The problem says Star4's apparent V is 15.5, but considering extinction, perhaps I should calculate the observed magnitude, which would be m_observed = m_intrinsic +A_v.

Wait, no. Star4's parameters are: absolute V mag 15.5, E(B-V)=0.4.

So first, compute the intrinsic apparent magnitude without extinction: m_intrinsic = M +5 log10(d/10) =15.5 +0=15.5.

Then, the extinction A_v=3.1*0.4=1.24.

So the observed apparent magnitude is m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v =15.5+1.24=16.74.

So Star4's apparent V is 16.74, which is higher than 16. So it's too faint for HIRES (which requires ≤16), but ESPRESSO can handle up to 17, so 16.74 is okay for ESPRESSO. So Star4 can only be seen by ESPRESSO, not HIRES.

Wait, but that's the opposite of what I thought earlier. So Star4's observed V is 16.74. So it can't be seen by HIRES but can be seen by ESPRESSO.

So which stars can be detected by both instruments?

Let's recap:

Star1: m=15.5. So within both.

Star2: m=16.5. Within ESPRESSO (≤17) but not HIRES (≤16).

Star3: m_observed=15.5, but after correcting for extinction, the intrinsic is 13.64. So the observed is 15.5, which is within both.

Wait, wait—wait a second. I think I messed up. The apparent V given for Star3 is 15.5, but we have to consider whether that's the observed or the intrinsic.

Wait, the problem states for Star3: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag."

So the apparent V mag is already the observed (extincted) magnitude. So m_observed =15.5.

But for the detection, do we need to correct for extinction to see if the star is bright enough?

Wait, no. Because the apparent magnitude given is the observed one, which includes extinction. So when the question says whether the star can be detected by the spectrographs, the magnitude used is the observed m. Because the spectrograph's limit is based on what we observe.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if a star is dimmer due to extinction, it's not as bright as it appears. So the apparent magnitude without extinction would be fainter (higher) or brighter (lower)?

Wait, extinction makes stars appear fainter, so higher apparent magnitude. So if a star's intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) is m_intrinsic, then the observed m_observed = m_intrinsic + A_v.

So for example, suppose a star has m_intrinsic =10.0, and A_v =1.0. Then m_observed is 11.0.

But when it comes to detection, the telescope's limit is on the observed magnitude. So for a star to be detected, the observed m must be ≤ the limit.

So for Star3, m_observed is 15.5. So for HIRES, which requires m ≤16, 15.5 is okay. For ESPRESSO, m ≤17, also okay. So Star3 can be detected by both.

But wait, wait! Because E(B-V) is given, and the problem says to account for the total absorption in V. So the observed V is 15.5, but the intrinsic is 15.5 -1.86=13.64. Do the spectrographs' limits depend on the intrinsic V or the observed V?

No, the limits are based on the observed apparent V magnitude. Because that's what determines how much light we receive. So even if the star is intrinsically brighter, due to dust, it's dimmer as observed. So the observed magnitude is what matters for detection.

So for Star3, observed V is 15.5, which is within both 17 and 16. So yes, both can detect it.

Wait, but Star4's observed V is 16.74, which is above HIRES's 16 limit. So only ESPRESSO can see it.

Star5: absolute mag 16.5, distance 5 pc. Calculate m.

m =16.5 +5*log(5/10) =16.5 +5*(-0.3010) =16.5 -1.505=14.995, about 15.0.

So Star5's apparent V is 15.0, which is within both limits.

So which stars can be detected by both?

Looking at each:

Star1: m=15.5 → can be detected by both.

Star3: m=15.5 → can be detected by both.

Star5: m=15.0 → can be detected by both.

Wait, that's three stars. But the options don't include more than two. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let's check Star4 again. Star4's absolute V is 15.5, distance 10 pc.

So m_intrinsic =15.5 +5*log(10/10)=15.5.

E(B-V)=0.4 → Av=3.1*0.4=1.24.

So observed m=15.5+1.24=16.74. So higher than HIRES's limit (16) and within ESPRESSO's limit (17). So Star4 cannot be detected by HIRES, only by ESPRESSO.

So which stars are detectable by both:

Star1: m=15.5 → both can detect.

Star3: m=15.5 → both can detect.

Star5: m=15.0 → both can detect.

So the options are:

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES, so this is incorrect.

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES, so no.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → Both have m=15.5 (Star3) and 15.0 (Star5). Both are within both limits.

So Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both.

But wait, the options don't have an option with Star3 and Star5. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

B) Star3 and Star5 → Both within limits.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 has m=16.5, which is within ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

So the correct answer would be option B: Star3 and Star5.

Wait, but looking back, Star3's m is 15.5, which is within both. Star5's m is 15.0, also within both.

So option B is correct.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at the Paranal Observatory and the HIRES spectrograph at the Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars and compare them to the detection limits of the instruments. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤17, while HIRES can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes ≤16. Therefore, a star must have an apparent V magnitude ≤16 to be detectable by both instruments.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \)  
   - Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5
     \]  
   - Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 15.5 \)  
   - Since \( 15.5 \leq 16 \), Star1 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

2. **Star2**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 16.5 \)  
   - Since \( 16.5 > 16 \), Star2 cannot be detected by HIRES. It can only be detected by ESPRESSO.  

3. **Star3**:  
   - Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 15.5 \)  
   - Extinction: \( E(B-V) = 0.6 \), \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 1.86 \)  
   - The observed apparent V magnitude is already given as \( m = 15.5 \), which includes extinction.  
   - Since \( 15.5 \leq 16 \), Star3 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

4. **Star4**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \)  
   - Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)  
   - Intrinsic apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{intrinsic}} = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5
     \]  
   - Extinction: \( E(B-V) = 0.4 \), \( A_V = 3.1 \times E(B-V) = 1.24 \)  
   - Observed apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m_{\text{observed}} = m_{\text{intrinsic}} + A_V = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74
     \]  
   - Since \( 16.74 > 16 \), Star4 cannot be detected by HIRES. It can only be detected by ESPRESSO.

5. **Star5**:  
   - Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 16.5 \)  
   - Distance: \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \)  
   - Apparent V magnitude:  
     \[
     m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 - 1.505 = 15.0
     \]  
   - Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 15.0 \)  
   - Since \( 15.0 \leq 16 \), Star5 can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.

### Conclusion:
- **Star1**: Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.  
- **Star2**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.  
- **Star3**: Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.  
- **Star4**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.  
- **Star5**: Detectable by both ESPRESSO and HIRES.  

The stars that can be detected by both ESPRESSO and HIRES are **Star3 and Star5**.
