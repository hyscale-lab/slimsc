Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon to move to the next lowest energy state. The model used is the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, I remember that diatomic molecules can have both rotational and vibrational energy levels. Oh right, the rigid rotor model only considers rotation, but the non-rigid (or vibrationally non-rigid) model allows the bond length to change a bit, which affects the moment of inertia and thus the rotational energy levels.

But wait, the question is about the transition when a photon is absorbed. So I think this involves a change in both rotational and vibrational energy states. But wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which probably means the vibrational ground state and the rotational ground state. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either go to the next vibrational state or a higher rotational state, or a combination of both. But the question says it's switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, so what's the next lowest state after the fundamental?

In quantum mechanics, the states are quantized. For a diatomic molecule, the energy levels have both rotational and vibrational contributions. The total energy is the sum of the rotational (E_rot) and vibrational (E_vib) energies. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (which is J=0 for linear rotors, but wait, J=0 might not be accessible due to selection rules? Or wait, for rigid rotor, J can be 0,1,2,...

Wait, but when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can transition either by changing the vibrational quantum number or the rotational, or both. But the question is about the next lowest state. So let me think: The fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next possible state could be either v=1 (vibrational first excited state) or J=1 (rotational first excited state). But which requires less energy?

I need to calculate the energy differences for both transitions and see which is smaller. The photon's energy should match the smaller one, since it's the next lowest possible state.

Wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Oh, because energy of a photon is E = hν = p*c, where p is momentum. So once I find the required energy, I can find the momentum.

So first, let's compute the energy needed to go from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state. The next state would be the one with the lowest possible energy higher than the fundamental. So I need to find the energy of the next state, which is either the first vibrational state (v=1) or the first rotational state (J=1).

So let's calculate both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot.

Vibrational energy levels: E_vib = (v + 1/2) h ν. So the fundamental state is v=0, E0 = (0 + 1/2) h ν. The first excited vibrational state is v=1, E1 = (1 + 1/2) h ν. So the energy difference ΔE_vib = E1 - E0 = h ν.

Rotational energy levels: E_rot = (J (J + 1) ℏ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. For J=0, E_rot0 = 0. For J=1, E_rot1 = (1*2 ℏ²)/(2I) = (2 ℏ²)/(2I) = ℏ²/(I). So the energy difference ΔE_rot = E_rot1 - E_rot0 = ℏ²/(I).

Wait, but the energy difference for rotation from J=0 to J=1 is ℏ²/(I), which is actually (h/(2π))^2 / I. Because ℏ is h/(2π).

I need to compute both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot to see which one is smaller. The photon with the corresponding energy would cause the transition to the lower one.

Wait, but the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So if ΔE_rot is smaller than ΔE_vib, then the photon's energy would be ΔE_rot. If not, then it's ΔE_vib.

Wait, but some sources say that for diatomic molecules, the rotational transitions are usually in the microwave region, and vibrational in the infrared. Which implies that the vibrational energy spacing is larger than rotational. So perhaps in this case, the rotational transition requires less energy. Hmm, but I need to compute.

Let me calculate I, the moment of inertia. I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Given Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu. So Mx + My =22 amu. μ = (20 *2)/22 =40/22 ≈1.818 amu. But wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So μ ≈1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 m, so r = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = (3.01e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 *4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Now compute ΔE_rot: ℏ² / I. ℏ is h/(2π), h is 6.626e-34 J s.

ℏ = 6.626e-34 / (2 * 3.1416) ≈ 1.054e-34 J s.

ℏ squared is (1.054e-34)^2 ≈1.11e-68 (J s)^2.

ΔE_rot = (1.11e-68) / (1.204e-46) ≈9.22e-23 J.

Wait, 1.11e-68 / 1.204e-46 = (1.11 /1.204) * 1e-22 → approx 0.9218e-22 → 9.218e-23 J.

Now compute ΔE_vib: h ν. Given ν is 4e14 rad/s.

h ν = 6.626e-34 J s *4e14 rad/s = 2.6504e-19 J.

Wait, that's much larger than the rotational energy difference. So ΔE_vib is 2.65e-19 J, while ΔE_rot is ~9.2e-23 J. So clearly, the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the photon's energy should be in the rotational transition.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model. Oh, so it's a non-rigid rotor, which includes both rotational and vibrational aspects. But when transitioning from the fundamental state, which is v=0 and J=0, the next state would be either v=1 (J=0) or J=1 (v=0), whichever has lower energy.

But wait, wait: in some models, when both rotational and vibrational levels are considered, the energy levels are a sum of both. So for a molecule in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next possible state could be J=1, v=0 (rotational) or v=1, J=0 (vibrational). Since the rotational transition requires less energy (as we just calculated), the photon's energy would be that of the rotational transition.

So the photon's energy is ΔE_rot =9.22e-23 J.

But wait, wait! Do I need to consider transitions to higher vibrational states, or can the molecule also have rotational transitions while in the same vibrational state? Because if the molecule is in v=0, it can have J=0,1,2,... So the first excited state would be J=1, which requires less energy than the vibrational transition.

So the photon's energy is the energy needed for the rotational transition.

Wait, but the problem says it's a diatomic molecule modeled using the rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the energy differences are a combination of both rotational and vibrational changes. Or maybe the question is considering the transition to the next state in terms of the total energy, which could be either a pure rotational state or a pure vibrational state.

Wait, but the total energy is E = E_vib + E_rot. The fundamental state is E0 = (0 + 1/2)hν + 0 (since J=0). The next possible states would have either v=1, J=0 (E1) or v=0, J=1 (E2). The lower energy of these two would be the next state.

So if E2 (rotational) is lower than E1 (vibrational), then the photon's energy is E2 - E0.

Wait, but let me compute E1 and E2.

E1 (v=1, J=0) = (1 + 1/2) h ν + 0 = (3/2) h ν ≈ (3/2)*6.626e-34 *4e14 = (3/2)*2.65e-19 = 3.975e-19 J.

E2 (v=0, J=1) = (0 + 1/2) h ν + (1*2)* (ℏ²)/(2I) ) = 0.5 h ν + ℏ²/(I).

We already computed ℏ²/(I)=9.22e-23 J.

0.5 h ν is 0.5 * 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 0.5 *2.65e-19 =1.325e-19 J.

So E2 = 1.325e-19 + 9.22e-23 = approximately 1.325e-19 J (since 9e-23 is much smaller).

So E1 =3.975e-19, E2=1.325e-19. So E2 is much lower than E1. Therefore, the next state with the lowest possible energy is E2, which is the J=1, v=0 state. So the photon's energy is E2 - E0 = (1.325e-19 +9.22e-23) - (0.5 h ν) → Wait, because E0 is (0.5 h ν) +0.

Wait, E0 is E_vib (v=0) plus E_rot (J=0). E_vib is (0 +1/2) h ν, E_rot is 0. So E0 = 0.5 h ν = 0.5 *6.626e-34 *4e14 = 6.626e-34 *2e14 =1.325e-19 J.

E2 is 1.325e-19 (vib part) +9.22e-23 (rot part) ≈ 1.325e-19 J (since 9e-23 is negligible compared to 1e-19).

So the energy difference is E2 - E0 = (1.325e-19 +9.22e-23) - 1.325e-19 =9.22e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, that's the same as the rotational energy difference. Because when you go from J=0 to J=1, the rotational energy increases. So the photon must supply that energy.

So the energy of the photon is E_photon = ΔE_rot =9.22e-23 J.

But wait, the options given are in terms of momentum, not energy. So I need to find the momentum p of the photon.

We know that for a photon, E = p c. So p = E/(c).

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.22e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: 1.9e-28 Ns → which is 1.9e-28 kg m/s.

Option B: 2.3e-27 kg m/s.

Option C: 1.1e-27 kg m/s.

Option D:1.4e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm, my calculation gives p≈3.07e-31 kg m/s, which isn't among the options. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me double-check.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) =40/22≈1.818 amu.

Wait, converting amu to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ =1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.016e-27 kg.

r =2 angstroms =2e-10 meters.

I =μ r² =3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.016e-27 *4e-20 =1.2064e-46 kg m².

Now, ℏ squared is (h/(2π))^2.

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

So h/(2π) ≈6.626e-34 /6.283 ≈1.054e-34 J s.

So (h/(2π))^2 ≈1.11e-68 (J s)^2.

ΔE_rot = (ℏ²)/I =1.11e-68 /1.2064e-46 ≈9.20e-23 J.

Hmm, same as before.

So p = E/c =9.20e-23 J /3e8 m/s = 3.067e-31 kg m/s.

Which is 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But none of the options are close to that. So what am I missing here?

Wait, perhaps I considered only the rotational transition, but the question might require considering both rotational and vibrational transitions, like the combination of a vibrational and rotational change. Or perhaps I'm supposed to consider the transition from the fundamental state (J=0, v=0) to the next state, which could involve a change in both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers.

Wait, another possibility: the non-rigid rotor model might involve both vibrational and rotational energy. So maybe the energy levels are a combination of both, and the next state isn't purely rotational or vibrational, but a combination. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule transitioning from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which would require more energy than the rotational transition, but perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition as the next state.

Wait, but earlier, I found that the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy would be the ΔE_rot, which is about 9e-23 J, but the options don't match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me recalculate I.

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22=20/11≈1.81818 amu.

1 amu=1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ=1.81818 *1.6605e-27 kg.

1.81818 *1.6605 ≈ let's compute:

1.8 *1.6605 ≈2.9889.

0.01818 *1.6605 ≈0.02998.

Total ≈3.01888e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

I = μ r² =3.01888e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.01888e-27 *4e-20 =1.20755e-46 kg m².

Now, ℏ² = (h/(2π))^2.

h=6.62607e-34 J s.

h/(2π)=6.62607e-34 /6.28319 ≈1.05457e-34 J s.

So ℏ² ≈(1.05457e-34)^2 ≈1.112e-68 J² s².

ΔE_rot = ℏ²/I =1.112e-68 /1.20755e-46 = approx 9.21e-23 J.

Same as before. So p = 9.21e-23 J /3e8 m/s =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are way larger, like 1e-27.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

The question says: what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Ah, wait, perhaps the next state is the first excited state of vibration, which is much higher in energy than a rotational transition. But according to my calculations, the rotational transition requires much less energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the state where both v and J increase. But that would require more energy, which is not the next lowest state.

Alternatively, maybe the model being used here is different. Wait, the question states it's the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor). So perhaps the energy levels are quantized differently, and the transitions are calculated considering both vibrations and rotations.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the problem is asking about the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs a photon in a way that it transitions to the next state, which is the first state in the hierarchy, perhaps a vibrational transition, not a rotational one. But earlier calculations showed that the rotational transition is much lower in energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (v=0), but perhaps in the rigid rotor model, the rotational ground state (J=0) is the same as the vibrational state. So when it's in the fundamental state, it's both v=0 and J=0. To go to the next state, it can either increase J or v. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon's energy is that of rotational transition.

But why don't the options match the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the moment of inertia. Let me check the units again.

Wait, wait, bond length is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Correct.

Masses: 20 and 2 amu. So reduced mass is (20 *2)/(22) amu.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule undergoes a transition, but perhaps using the selection rules. Wait, for rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ=±1, but for vibrational transitions, Δv=±1. So the photon would cause a transition that changes either J or v by ±1.

But in the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0, the photon could cause a transition to v=1, J=0 (vibrational) or v=0, J=1 (rotational). As I calculated earlier, the rotational transition requires much less energy, so the photon's energy would be lower.

But the options are way higher than what I calculated. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the calculation again, perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy difference. Let's re-calculate E_rot.

E_rot for J=0 is 0.

E_rot for J=1: (1*(1+1)) * (ℏ²)/(2I) ) = (2) * (ℏ²)/(2I) )= ℏ²/I.

So ΔE_rot = ℏ²/I.

Wait, but ℏ is 1.05457e-34 J s. So (1.05457e-34)^2 = (approx) 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

I is 1.20755e-46 kg m².

So ΔE_rot = 1.112e-68 /1.20755e-46 = approx 9.21e-23 J.

Correct. So p = E/c =9.21e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, let's convert this to Ns, because the options are in Ns. Since 1 Ns = 1 kg m/s.

So 3.07e-31 kg m/s is 3.07e-31 Ns. But the options are all around 1e-27 Ns, which is four orders larger. Hmm.

So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I misread the masses. The masses are given as Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. Did I compute the reduced mass correctly?

Yes, μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22=20/11 ≈1.81818 amu. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moment of inertia calculation. Let me recompute I.

I = μ r².

μ is 3.01888e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

r² =4e-20 m².

So I=3.01888e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.20755e-46 kg m².

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the angular frequency w is given, but the energy is not just h w but something else. Wait, the given w is the angular frequency of vibration, which is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, in the vibrational energy levels, the energy spacing is h ν, where ν is the vibrational frequency. But wait, the given is angular frequency ω=4e14 rad/s. The vibrational frequency ν is ω/(2π).

So ν_vib = ω/(2π) =4e14 /6.283 ≈6.366e13 Hz.

So E_vib = h ν =6.626e-34 *6.366e13 =approx 4.21e-20 J.

Wait, no, earlier I thought ν was given as 4e14, but if ω is 4e14, then ν is ω/(2π). So I think I made an error in calculating ΔE_vib earlier.

Wait, in the problem statement, the given is w =4e14 rad/s, which is the angular frequency of vibration. So the vibrational frequency ν is w/(2π)=4e14/(2pi)≈4e14 /6.283≈6.366e13 Hz.

So E_vib = h * ν =6.626e-34 *6.366e13 ≈4.21e-20 J.

Ah, that's a big mistake! I thought ω was ν, but it's the angular frequency. So the vibrational energy difference is 4.21e-20 J.

Wait, earlier I thought ΔE_vib was 2.65e-19 J, but that's wrong because I used 4e14 as ν. So correct ΔE_vib is 4.21e-20 J.

Now, comparing with ΔE_rot which is 9.21e-23 J, which is about 9e-23 J.

So now, the vibrational transition requires more energy (4.2e-20 J) than the rotational (9.2e-23 J). So the next state would be the rotational transition.

Thus, the photon's energy is 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, but earlier calculation of p was 3.07e-31 Ns, which is 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are way larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the non-rigid rotor model where the bond length is not fixed, so the moment of inertia isn't fixed either. But that complicates things, and I'm not exactly sure how it affects the calculation here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next vibration state, which would require more energy but is the next possible state. But why?

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_rot = (J(J+1)ℏ²)/(2I). So for J=0, E=0; J=1, E=2ℏ²/(2I)= ℏ²/(I).

So the rotational energy difference is much smaller than the vibrational one.

Hmm, let's compute the photon's momentum again.

E_photon =9.21e-23 J.

p = E /c =9.21e-23 /3e8 ≈3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are all 1e-27 and larger. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the photon's energy using angular frequency, not frequency.

Wait, the photon's energy is E = h ν, but in terms of angular frequency ω, E = ℏ ω.

Wait, that's a crucial point! Because sometimes in physics, the energy of a photon is expressed as E = ℏ ω, where ω is the angular frequency.

Wait, in the problem statement, the given is the angular frequency of vibration w=4e14 rad/s. So if the photon's energy is E_photon = ℏ ω, then E_photon = (1.05457e-34 J s) *4e14 rad/s =4.218e-20 J.

Wait, that's the same as the vibrational energy difference. So in that case, the photon's energy would be 4.218e-20 J.

Wait, but earlier I thought the rotational transition is lower energy. So why is the photon's energy matching the vibrational transition?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's clarify.

Photon energy can be expressed as E_photon = h ν = ℏ ω, where ν is the frequency (in Hz) and ω is the angular frequency (rad/s). So if the given w is the vibrational angular frequency, then E_photon for a vibrational transition would be ℏ w.

So E_photon_vib = ℏ *4e14 =1.05457e-34 *4e14 ≈4.218e-20 J.

Which is much larger than the rotational transition's 9.2e-23 J.

So that would imply that the photon's energy is that of the vibrational transition. So why would the molecule transition to the next state, which requires higher energy, instead of the lower rotational transition?

Ah, maybe the question is considering the next state as the first state in the energy level ordering, not the state with the lowest energy. Because in energy level diagrams, often the vibrational levels are split into rotational sublevels. So the next state after the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) would be the first rotational state (v=0, J=1), which is lower in energy than the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0). So the transition would be to the rotational state, requiring less energy.

But why do the options not match the calculated value?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition with the next higher energy state, but perhaps it's a typo in the problem, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the model.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the molecular transition to the next state when considering both rotational and vibrational transitions, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the molecule as a harmonic oscillator plus a rigid rotor, but in the non-rigid rotor, the vibrational and rotational energies are not independent, so the transition might involve both a rotational and vibrational change. But that's more complicated, and I don't remember the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect, but more likely, I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking about the momentum of the photon, which is E/c, and perhaps the energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies for some reason. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, let's think about the options again. They are:

A) 1.9e-28 kg m/s

B)2.3e-27 kg m/s

C)1.1e-27 kg m/s

D)1.4e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass or the moment of inertia.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is given in angstroms, but I used meters. Wait, no, I converted 2 angstroms to 2e-10 meters correctly.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the molecule is diatomic and the moment of inertia is I = μ r², but perhaps the rotational partition function considers something else. No, I think I did it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in the opposite direction: maybe it's the rotational energy that's higher. Let me double-check.

Wait, the vibrational energy difference is E_vib = h ν =6.626e-34 * (4e14/(2pi)) =6.626e-34 *6.366e13 ≈4.21e-20 J.

The rotational energy difference is ~9e-23 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the photon's energy is 9e-23 J, which as momentum is 3e-31 kg m/s. But the options are way larger.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong value for w. Let me recheck: the given w is 4e14 rad/s, which is 4e14. But earlier, I thought it was the vibrational frequency, but perhaps it's the rotational angular frequency. No, the question says it's the angular frequency of vibration.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is not about the energy difference but the product of the rotational and vibrational parts.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the photon's momentum using the rotational energy difference, which is 9.2e-23 J.

p = E/c =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 → 1.9e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm, 3.07e-31 is 3.07e-4 times smaller than option A. So perhaps I missed a factor of 1e4. Where?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units for the bond length. Let me check: 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters, correct.

Wait, maybe I should have used bond length in centimeters? No, because the formula uses SI units.

Another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me calculate it again.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 +2 amu) =40/22 amu = 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

μ =1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.018e-27 kg.

r =2 angstroms =2e-10 m.

I = μ r² =3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.018e-27 *4e-20 =1.207e-46 kg m².

Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the vibrational energy difference as the photon's energy. So E_photon =4.21e-20 J.

Then p =4.21e-20 /3e8 =1.403e-28 kg m/s.

Which is approximately 1.4e-28 Ns. Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 kg m/s. That's matching.

But why would the photon's energy be the vibrational energy difference? Because the rotational transition is lower in energy, why would the photon's energy be higher?

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the fundamental state to the next available state, which is the first vibrational state, not the rotational state. But that doesn't make sense because the rotational state is lower in energy.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. But according to the calculation, the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon's momentum should be ~3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't an option. But if I consider the vibrational transition, the momentum is ~1.4e-28 kg m/s, which is option D.

But wait, perhaps the question is asking about the transition to the next state regardless of which is lower in energy.

Wait, the question says: "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the least energy higher than the current state. So the rotational transition is lower than the vibrational, so the photon's energy should be for the rotational transition.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made an error in computing the rotational energy difference.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy difference is not ℏ²/I, but something else.

Wait, the energy levels for a rigid rotor are E_J = (J (J+1) ℏ²) / (2I).

So the energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is E_1 - E_0 = [ (2 ℏ²)/(2I) ) ] -0 = ℏ²/(I).

Which is correct. So the calculation is right.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor, but the angular frequency given is the rotational frequency, not the vibrational. No, the question says it's the angular frequency of vibration.

Wait, maybe the given angular frequency is for the rotational motion. But no, the question states it's the vibration. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the transition that increases both vibrational and rotational states, but that would require more energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the types of transitions. For example, in electronic transitions, much higher energies are involved, but this is vibrational and rotational.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy to cause a transition to the next energy level, which includes both the rotational and vibrational contributions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference is the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy differences. But that would be even larger than the vibrational alone, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which is a combination of rotational and vibrational changes, but that's more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to compute the momentum using the vibrational energy difference. So, E_photon =4.21e-20 J, p =1.4e-28 kg m/s, which matches option D.

But why would the photon's energy be vibrational when the rotational transition is lower in energy? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the mistake is that in the rigid rotor model, J starts at 0, and the next state is J=1. But the question is about a non-rigid rotor, which may have a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the non-rigid rotor model doesn't include the rigid rotor's rotational states but allows for bond length variation, so the moment of inertia changes, which affects the rotational energy levels. But I'm not sure how that would change the energy difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next energy level in the combined rotational and vibrational spectrum. But that would probably require a more complex calculation.

But given the options, the only one that matches when considering the vibrational energy is option D:1.4e-28 kg m/s.

So perhaps the intended answer is option D, where the photon's energy is the vibrational transition.

But according to my earlier calculations, the rotational transition requires less energy. Therefore, I'm confused. Maybe the given options are wrong, but the problem expects us to compute based on the vibrational energy.

Another angle: perhaps the question is about the transition from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the first possible state, which might involve a vibrational transition, regardless of the rotational possibility.

But the rotational transition is lower in energy, so it should be the next state.

Wait, perhaps the model being used considers that the molecule can't undergo a rotational transition without a vibrational transition. But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the transition to the next vibrational state, not considering the rotational states. But that would contradict the rotational transition being lower.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the question is using a different formula for the rotational energy. For example, sometimes the rotational constant B is used, where B = ℏ²/(2I c), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the rotational energy can be expressed as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant.

B = ℏ²/(2I).

So E_rot for J=1 is 2B.

So ΔE_rot =2B -0=2B.

B = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 *1.207e-46) → (1.11e-68) / (2.414e-46) ≈4.6e-23 J.

Wait, wait, no, B is in Joules per J(J+1). So E_rot for J=1 is 2B.

Wait, let me compute B:

B = ℏ²/(2I) = (1.11e-68) / (2 *1.207e-46) ) =1.11e-68 /2.414e-46 ≈4.6e-23 J.

So E_rot for J=1 is 2 *4.6e-23 =9.2e-23 J. Which matches my earlier calculation.

So photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J.

p = E/c =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are all way larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation.

Ah! Wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

μ = (20 *2 )/(20 +2 ) =40/22=20/11=1.818... amu.

Wait, but wait, 1.818 amu is the reduced mass, but when converting to kg, I should multiply by 1.6605e-27 kg/amu.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the mass as the sum, not the reduced mass. But that would be incorrect because the moment of inertia uses the reduced mass for diatomic molecules. So that shouldn't be the case.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem assumes that the moment of inertia is I = (Mx + My) r², which would be incorrect, but perhaps the question made that mistake.

If I tried that, I= (20 +2 ) amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

22 amu =22 *1.6605e-27 kg =3.653e-26 kg.

I =3.653e-26 kg *4e-20 m² =1.461e-45 kg m².

Then ℏ²/I = (1.11e-68) /1.461e-45 ≈7.6e-24 J.

Then p =7.6e-24 /3e8 =2.53e-32 kg m/s.

Even smaller, not matching options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the bond length in a different unit, like picometers. Wait, 2 angstroms is 200 pm. No, that wouldn't change the result significantly.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the momentum using the vibrational energy, leading to option D.

E_photon =4.21e-20 J.

p =4.21e-20 /3e8 =1.403e-28 kg m/s.

Which is approximately 1.4e-28 Ns. That's option D.

So perhaps the intended answer is D, but I'm not entirely sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the transition to the next vibrational state, which requires a photon with that energy.

But why would the next state be a vibrational one when a rotational transition is possible and lower in energy?

Perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the vibrational transition, not considering the rotational one. Maybe the question is simplified and assumes that the molecule is in a vibrational state only, ignoring rotation.

In that case, the photon's energy would be the vibrational energy difference, leading to option D.

But the question states it's using the rotation-vibration model, so it's considering both.

At this point, I think the intended answer is D) 1.4e-28 Ns, based on the vibrational transition. But I'm not entirely confident because my calculations suggest the rotational transition requires less energy.

The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, where the molecule transitions from its fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The key is to determine the energy difference for the transition and calculate the corresponding photon momentum.

### Key Calculations and Analysis:

1. **Reduced Mass (μ):**
   The reduced mass is calculated as:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \, \text{amu} \times 2 \, \text{amu}}{20 \, \text{amu} + 2 \, \text{amu}} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

2. **Moment of Inertia (I):**
   The moment of inertia is:
   \[
   I = \mu r^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}) \times (2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2.
   \]

3. **Rotational Energy Difference (ΔE_rot):**
   The rotational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_J = \frac{J (J+1) \hbar^2}{2I}.
   \]
   For \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_1 - E_0 = \frac{(1 \cdot 2) \hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}.
   \]
   Using \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.054 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Vibrational Energy Difference (ΔE_vib):**
   The vibrational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_v = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \nu,
   \]
   where \( \nu = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} \). The angular frequency is given as \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \), so:
   \[
   \nu = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2\pi} \approx 6.366 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz}.
   \]
   The energy difference for the vibrational transition (\( v = 0 \to v = 1 \)) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (6.366 \times 10^{13}) \approx 4.21 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]

5. **Comparison of Energy Differences:**
   The rotational transition requires significantly less energy (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)) compared to the vibrational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 4.21 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \)). Therefore, the next state with the lowest possible energy is the rotational state (\( J = 1, v = 0 \)).

6. **Photon Momentum (p):**
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Using \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \):
   \[
   p = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
   \]

7. **Mismatch with Options:**
   The calculated momentum (\( 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} \)) does not match any of the given options. However, if the vibrational transition is considered instead (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 4.21 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \)):
   \[
   p = \frac{4.21 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.40 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
   \]
   This matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
While the rotational transition requires less energy, the problem may intend for the vibrational transition to be considered. Based on the given options, the most reasonable answer is:

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says the molecule is in its fundamental state and absorbs a photon to move to the next lowest energy state. The model used is the quantum rotation-vibration model, also called the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, I remember that diatomic molecules can have both rotational and vibrational energy levels. Oh right, the rigid rotor model only considers rotation, but the non-rigid (or vibrationally non-rigid) model allows the bond length to change a bit, which affects the moment of inertia and thus the rotational energy levels.

But wait, the question is about the transition when a photon is absorbed. So I think this involves a change in both rotational and vibrational energy states. But wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which probably means the vibrational ground state and the rotational ground state. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can either go to the next vibrational state or a higher rotational state, or a combination of both. But the question says it's switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy. Hmm, so what's the next lowest state after the fundamental?

In quantum mechanics, the states are quantized. For a diatomic molecule, the energy levels have both rotational and vibrational contributions. The total energy is the sum of the rotational (E_rot) and vibrational (E_vib) energies. The fundamental state is the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (which is J=0 for linear rotors, but wait, J=0 might not be accessible due to selection rules? Or wait, for rigid rotor, J can be 0,1,2,...

Wait, but when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can transition either by changing the vibrational quantum number or the rotational, or both. But the question is about the next lowest state. So let me think: The fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next possible state could be either v=1 (vibrational first excited state) or J=1 (rotational first excited state). But which requires less energy?

I need to calculate the energy differences for both transitions and see which is smaller. The photon's energy should match the smaller one, since it's the next lowest possible state.

Wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Oh, because energy of a photon is E = hν = p*c, where p is momentum. So once I find the required energy, I can find the momentum.

So first, let's compute the energy needed to go from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state. The next state would be the one with the lowest possible energy higher than the fundamental. So I need to find the energy of the next state, which is either the first vibrational state (v=1) or the first rotational state (J=1).

So let's calculate both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot.

Vibrational energy levels: E_vib = (v + 1/2) h ν. So the fundamental state is v=0, E0 = (0 + 1/2) h ν. The first excited vibrational state is v=1, E1 = (1 + 1/2) h ν. So the energy difference ΔE_vib = E1 - E0 = h ν.

Rotational energy levels: E_rot = (J (J + 1) ℏ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia. For J=0, E_rot0 = 0. For J=1, E_rot1 = (1*2 ℏ²)/(2I) = (2 ℏ²)/(2I) = ℏ²/(I). So the energy difference ΔE_rot = E_rot1 - E_rot0 = ℏ²/(I).

Wait, but the energy difference for rotation from J=0 to J=1 is ℏ²/(I), which is actually (h/(2π))^2 / I. Because ℏ is h/(2π).

I need to compute both ΔE_vib and ΔE_rot to see which one is smaller. The photon with the corresponding energy would cause the transition to the lower one.

Wait, but the problem says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So if ΔE_rot is smaller than ΔE_vib, then the photon's energy would be ΔE_rot. If not, then it's ΔE_vib.

Wait, but some sources say that for diatomic molecules, the rotational transitions are usually in the microwave region, and vibrational in the infrared. Which implies that the vibrational energy spacing is larger than rotational. So perhaps in this case, the rotational transition requires less energy. Hmm, but I need to compute.

Let me calculate I, the moment of inertia. I = μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Given Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu. So Mx + My =22 amu. μ = (20 *2)/22 =40/22 ≈1.818 amu. But wait, 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg. So μ ≈1.818 * 1.66e-27 kg ≈ 3.01e-27 kg.

r is given as 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 m, so r = 2e-10 m.

I = μ r² = (3.01e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 *4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Now compute ΔE_rot: ℏ² / I. ℏ is h/(2π), h is 6.626e-34 J s.

ℏ = 6.626e-34 / (2 * 3.1416) ≈ 1.054e-34 J s.

ℏ squared is (1.054e-34)^2 ≈1.11e-68 (J s)^2.

ΔE_rot = (1.11e-68) / (1.204e-46) ≈9.22e-23 J.

Wait, 1.11e-68 / 1.204e-46 = (1.11 /1.204) * 1e-22 → approx 0.9218e-22 → 9.218e-23 J.

Now compute ΔE_vib: h ν. Given ν is 4e14 rad/s.

h ν = 6.626e-34 J s *4e14 rad/s = 2.6504e-19 J.

Wait, that's much larger than the rotational energy difference. So ΔE_vib is 2.65e-19 J, while ΔE_rot is ~9.2e-23 J. So clearly, the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the photon's energy should be in the rotational transition.

Wait, but wait, the problem states that the molecule is modeled using the rotation-vibration model. Oh, so it's a non-rigid rotor, which includes both rotational and vibrational aspects. But when transitioning from the fundamental state, which is v=0 and J=0, the next state would be either v=1 (J=0) or J=1 (v=0), whichever has lower energy.

But wait, wait: in some models, when both rotational and vibrational levels are considered, the energy levels are a sum of both. So for a molecule in the fundamental state (v=0, J=0), the next possible state could be J=1, v=0 (rotational) or v=1, J=0 (vibrational). Since the rotational transition requires less energy (as we just calculated), the photon's energy would be that of the rotational transition.

So the photon's energy is ΔE_rot =9.22e-23 J.

But wait, wait! Do I need to consider transitions to higher vibrational states, or can the molecule also have rotational transitions while in the same vibrational state? Because if the molecule is in v=0, it can have J=0,1,2,... So the first excited state would be J=1, which requires less energy than the vibrational transition.

So the photon's energy is the energy needed for the rotational transition.

Wait, but the problem says it's a diatomic molecule modeled using the rotation-vibration model. So perhaps the energy differences are a combination of both rotational and vibrational changes. Or maybe the question is considering the transition to the next state in terms of the total energy, which could be either a pure rotational state or a pure vibrational state.

Wait, but the total energy is E = E_vib + E_rot. The fundamental state is E0 = (0 + 1/2)hν + 0 (since J=0). The next possible states would have either v=1, J=0 (E1) or v=0, J=1 (E2). The lower energy of these two would be the next state.

So if E2 (rotational) is lower than E1 (vibrational), then the photon's energy is E2 - E0.

Wait, but let me compute E1 and E2.

E1 (v=1, J=0) = (1 + 1/2) h ν + 0 = (3/2) h ν ≈ (3/2)*6.626e-34 *4e14 = (3/2)*2.65e-19 = 3.975e-19 J.

E2 (v=0, J=1) = (0 + 1/2) h ν + (1*2)* (ℏ²)/(2I) ) = 0.5 h ν + ℏ²/(I).

We already computed ℏ²/(I)=9.22e-23 J.

0.5 h ν is 0.5 * 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 0.5 *2.65e-19 =1.325e-19 J.

So E2 = 1.325e-19 + 9.22e-23 = approximately 1.325e-19 J (since 9e-23 is much smaller).

So E1 =3.975e-19, E2=1.325e-19. So E2 is much lower than E1. Therefore, the next state with the lowest possible energy is E2, which is the J=1, v=0 state. So the photon's energy is E2 - E0 = (1.325e-19 +9.22e-23) - (0.5 h ν) → Wait, because E0 is (0.5 h ν) +0.

Wait, E0 is E_vib (v=0) plus E_rot (J=0). E_vib is (0 +1/2) h ν, E_rot is 0. So E0 = 0.5 h ν = 0.5 *6.626e-34 *4e14 = 6.626e-34 *2e14 =1.325e-19 J.

E2 is 1.325e-19 (vib part) +9.22e-23 (rot part) ≈ 1.325e-19 J (since 9e-23 is negligible compared to 1e-19).

So the energy difference is E2 - E0 = (1.325e-19 +9.22e-23) - 1.325e-19 =9.22e-23 J.

So the photon's energy is 9.22e-23 J.

Wait, but wait, that's the same as the rotational energy difference. Because when you go from J=0 to J=1, the rotational energy increases. So the photon must supply that energy.

So the energy of the photon is E_photon = ΔE_rot =9.22e-23 J.

But wait, the options given are in terms of momentum, not energy. So I need to find the momentum p of the photon.

We know that for a photon, E = p c. So p = E/(c).

c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = 9.22e-23 J / 3e8 m/s ≈3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: 1.9e-28 Ns → which is 1.9e-28 kg m/s.

Option B: 2.3e-27 kg m/s.

Option C: 1.1e-27 kg m/s.

Option D:1.4e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm, my calculation gives p≈3.07e-31 kg m/s, which isn't among the options. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me double-check.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) =40/22≈1.818 amu.

Wait, converting amu to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ =1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.016e-27 kg.

r =2 angstroms =2e-10 meters.

I =μ r² =3.016e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.016e-27 *4e-20 =1.2064e-46 kg m².

Now, ℏ squared is (h/(2π))^2.

h is 6.626e-34 J s.

So h/(2π) ≈6.626e-34 /6.283 ≈1.054e-34 J s.

So (h/(2π))^2 ≈1.11e-68 (J s)^2.

ΔE_rot = (ℏ²)/I =1.11e-68 /1.2064e-46 ≈9.20e-23 J.

Hmm, same as before.

So p = E/c =9.20e-23 J /3e8 m/s = 3.067e-31 kg m/s.

Which is 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

But none of the options are close to that. So what am I missing here?

Wait, perhaps I considered only the rotational transition, but the question might require considering both rotational and vibrational transitions, like the combination of a vibrational and rotational change. Or perhaps I'm supposed to consider the transition from the fundamental state (J=0, v=0) to the next state, which could involve a change in both vibrational and rotational quantum numbers.

Wait, another possibility: the non-rigid rotor model might involve both vibrational and rotational energy. So maybe the energy levels are a combination of both, and the next state isn't purely rotational or vibrational, but a combination. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the molecule transitioning from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first excited vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which would require more energy than the rotational transition, but perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition as the next state.

Wait, but earlier, I found that the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon's energy would be the ΔE_rot, which is about 9e-23 J, but the options don't match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me recalculate I.

μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22=20/11≈1.81818 amu.

1 amu=1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ=1.81818 *1.6605e-27 kg.

1.81818 *1.6605 ≈ let's compute:

1.8 *1.6605 ≈2.9889.

0.01818 *1.6605 ≈0.02998.

Total ≈3.01888e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

I = μ r² =3.01888e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.01888e-27 *4e-20 =1.20755e-46 kg m².

Now, ℏ² = (h/(2π))^2.

h=6.62607e-34 J s.

h/(2π)=6.62607e-34 /6.28319 ≈1.05457e-34 J s.

So ℏ² ≈(1.05457e-34)^2 ≈1.112e-68 J² s².

ΔE_rot = ℏ²/I =1.112e-68 /1.20755e-46 = approx 9.21e-23 J.

Same as before. So p = 9.21e-23 J /3e8 m/s =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are way larger, like 1e-27.

Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again.

The question says: what momentum should an absorbed photon have, in order for the molecule to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Ah, wait, perhaps the next state is the first excited state of vibration, which is much higher in energy than a rotational transition. But according to my calculations, the rotational transition requires much less energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the state where both v and J increase. But that would require more energy, which is not the next lowest state.

Alternatively, maybe the model being used here is different. Wait, the question states it's the quantum rotation-vibration model (non-rigid rotor). So perhaps the energy levels are quantized differently, and the transitions are calculated considering both vibrations and rotations.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the problem is asking about the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs a photon in a way that it transitions to the next state, which is the first state in the hierarchy, perhaps a vibrational transition, not a rotational one. But earlier calculations showed that the rotational transition is much lower in energy.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state, which is the lowest vibrational state (v=0), but perhaps in the rigid rotor model, the rotational ground state (J=0) is the same as the vibrational state. So when it's in the fundamental state, it's both v=0 and J=0. To go to the next state, it can either increase J or v. Since the rotational transition requires less energy, the photon's energy is that of rotational transition.

But why don't the options match the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the moment of inertia. Let me check the units again.

Wait, wait, bond length is given as 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. Correct.

Masses: 20 and 2 amu. So reduced mass is (20 *2)/(22) amu.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule undergoes a transition, but perhaps using the selection rules. Wait, for rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ=±1, but for vibrational transitions, Δv=±1. So the photon would cause a transition that changes either J or v by ±1.

But in the fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0, the photon could cause a transition to v=1, J=0 (vibrational) or v=0, J=1 (rotational). As I calculated earlier, the rotational transition requires much less energy, so the photon's energy would be lower.

But the options are way higher than what I calculated. Hmm.

Wait, let me check the calculation again, perhaps I missed a factor.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy difference. Let's re-calculate E_rot.

E_rot for J=0 is 0.

E_rot for J=1: (1*(1+1)) * (ℏ²)/(2I) ) = (2) * (ℏ²)/(2I) )= ℏ²/I.

So ΔE_rot = ℏ²/I.

Wait, but ℏ is 1.05457e-34 J s. So (1.05457e-34)^2 = (approx) 1.112e-68 (J s)^2.

I is 1.20755e-46 kg m².

So ΔE_rot = 1.112e-68 /1.20755e-46 = approx 9.21e-23 J.

Correct. So p = E/c =9.21e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, let's convert this to Ns, because the options are in Ns. Since 1 Ns = 1 kg m/s.

So 3.07e-31 kg m/s is 3.07e-31 Ns. But the options are all around 1e-27 Ns, which is four orders larger. Hmm.

So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I misread the masses. The masses are given as Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. Did I compute the reduced mass correctly?

Yes, μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22=20/11 ≈1.81818 amu. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moment of inertia calculation. Let me recompute I.

I = μ r².

μ is 3.01888e-27 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

r² =4e-20 m².

So I=3.01888e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.20755e-46 kg m².

That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the angular frequency w is given, but the energy is not just h w but something else. Wait, the given w is the angular frequency of vibration, which is 4e14 rad/s.

Wait, in the vibrational energy levels, the energy spacing is h ν, where ν is the vibrational frequency. But wait, the given is angular frequency ω=4e14 rad/s. The vibrational frequency ν is ω/(2π).

So ν_vib = ω/(2π) =4e14 /6.283 ≈6.366e13 Hz.

So E_vib = h ν =6.626e-34 *6.366e13 =approx 4.21e-20 J.

Wait, no, earlier I thought ν was given as 4e14, but if ω is 4e14, then ν is ω/(2π). So I think I made an error in calculating ΔE_vib earlier.

Wait, in the problem statement, the given is w =4e14 rad/s, which is the angular frequency of vibration. So the vibrational frequency ν is w/(2π)=4e14/(2pi)≈4e14 /6.283≈6.366e13 Hz.

So E_vib = h * ν =6.626e-34 *6.366e13 ≈4.21e-20 J.

Ah, that's a big mistake! I thought ω was ν, but it's the angular frequency. So the vibrational energy difference is 4.21e-20 J.

Wait, earlier I thought ΔE_vib was 2.65e-19 J, but that's wrong because I used 4e14 as ν. So correct ΔE_vib is 4.21e-20 J.

Now, comparing with ΔE_rot which is 9.21e-23 J, which is about 9e-23 J.

So now, the vibrational transition requires more energy (4.2e-20 J) than the rotational (9.2e-23 J). So the next state would be the rotational transition.

Thus, the photon's energy is 9.21e-23 J.

Wait, but earlier calculation of p was 3.07e-31 Ns, which is 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are way larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the non-rigid rotor model where the bond length is not fixed, so the moment of inertia isn't fixed either. But that complicates things, and I'm not exactly sure how it affects the calculation here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next vibration state, which would require more energy but is the next possible state. But why?

Wait, in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_rot = (J(J+1)ℏ²)/(2I). So for J=0, E=0; J=1, E=2ℏ²/(2I)= ℏ²/(I).

So the rotational energy difference is much smaller than the vibrational one.

Hmm, let's compute the photon's momentum again.

E_photon =9.21e-23 J.

p = E /c =9.21e-23 /3e8 ≈3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are all 1e-27 and larger. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the photon's energy using angular frequency, not frequency.

Wait, the photon's energy is E = h ν, but in terms of angular frequency ω, E = ℏ ω.

Wait, that's a crucial point! Because sometimes in physics, the energy of a photon is expressed as E = ℏ ω, where ω is the angular frequency.

Wait, in the problem statement, the given is the angular frequency of vibration w=4e14 rad/s. So if the photon's energy is E_photon = ℏ ω, then E_photon = (1.05457e-34 J s) *4e14 rad/s =4.218e-20 J.

Wait, that's the same as the vibrational energy difference. So in that case, the photon's energy would be 4.218e-20 J.

Wait, but earlier I thought the rotational transition is lower energy. So why is the photon's energy matching the vibrational transition?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's clarify.

Photon energy can be expressed as E_photon = h ν = ℏ ω, where ν is the frequency (in Hz) and ω is the angular frequency (rad/s). So if the given w is the vibrational angular frequency, then E_photon for a vibrational transition would be ℏ w.

So E_photon_vib = ℏ *4e14 =1.05457e-34 *4e14 ≈4.218e-20 J.

Which is much larger than the rotational transition's 9.2e-23 J.

So that would imply that the photon's energy is that of the vibrational transition. So why would the molecule transition to the next state, which requires higher energy, instead of the lower rotational transition?

Ah, maybe the question is considering the next state as the first state in the energy level ordering, not the state with the lowest energy. Because in energy level diagrams, often the vibrational levels are split into rotational sublevels. So the next state after the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) would be the first rotational state (v=0, J=1), which is lower in energy than the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0). So the transition would be to the rotational state, requiring less energy.

But why do the options not match the calculated value?

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition with the next higher energy state, but perhaps it's a typo in the problem, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the model.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the molecular transition to the next state when considering both rotational and vibrational transitions, but I'm not sure.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the molecule as a harmonic oscillator plus a rigid rotor, but in the non-rigid rotor, the vibrational and rotational energies are not independent, so the transition might involve both a rotational and vibrational change. But that's more complicated, and I don't remember the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is incorrect, but more likely, I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is asking about the momentum of the photon, which is E/c, and perhaps the energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational energies for some reason. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, let's think about the options again. They are:

A) 1.9e-28 kg m/s

B)2.3e-27 kg m/s

C)1.1e-27 kg m/s

D)1.4e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the reduced mass or the moment of inertia.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is given in angstroms, but I used meters. Wait, no, I converted 2 angstroms to 2e-10 meters correctly.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the fact that the molecule is diatomic and the moment of inertia is I = μ r², but perhaps the rotational partition function considers something else. No, I think I did it correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is in the opposite direction: maybe it's the rotational energy that's higher. Let me double-check.

Wait, the vibrational energy difference is E_vib = h ν =6.626e-34 * (4e14/(2pi)) =6.626e-34 *6.366e13 ≈4.21e-20 J.

The rotational energy difference is ~9e-23 J. So the rotational transition requires much less energy. So the photon's energy is 9e-23 J, which as momentum is 3e-31 kg m/s. But the options are way larger.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong value for w. Let me recheck: the given w is 4e14 rad/s, which is 4e14. But earlier, I thought it was the vibrational frequency, but perhaps it's the rotational angular frequency. No, the question says it's the angular frequency of vibration.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is not about the energy difference but the product of the rotational and vibrational parts.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the photon's momentum using the rotational energy difference, which is 9.2e-23 J.

p = E/c =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 → 1.9e-28 kg m/s.

Hmm, 3.07e-31 is 3.07e-4 times smaller than option A. So perhaps I missed a factor of 1e4. Where?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units for the bond length. Let me check: 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters, correct.

Wait, maybe I should have used bond length in centimeters? No, because the formula uses SI units.

Another possibility: perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me calculate it again.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu) / (20 +2 amu) =40/22 amu = 1.818 amu.

1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

μ =1.818 *1.6605e-27 kg ≈3.018e-27 kg.

r =2 angstroms =2e-10 m.

I = μ r² =3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.018e-27 *4e-20 =1.207e-46 kg m².

Correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the vibrational energy difference as the photon's energy. So E_photon =4.21e-20 J.

Then p =4.21e-20 /3e8 =1.403e-28 kg m/s.

Which is approximately 1.4e-28 Ns. Looking at the options, option D is 1.4e-28 kg m/s. That's matching.

But why would the photon's energy be the vibrational energy difference? Because the rotational transition is lower in energy, why would the photon's energy be higher?

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the fundamental state to the next available state, which is the first vibrational state, not the rotational state. But that doesn't make sense because the rotational state is lower in energy.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. But according to the calculation, the rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon's momentum should be ~3e-31 kg m/s, which isn't an option. But if I consider the vibrational transition, the momentum is ~1.4e-28 kg m/s, which is option D.

But wait, perhaps the question is asking about the transition to the next state regardless of which is lower in energy.

Wait, the question says: "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So the next state would be the one with the least energy higher than the current state. So the rotational transition is lower than the vibrational, so the photon's energy should be for the rotational transition.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made an error in computing the rotational energy difference.

Wait, perhaps the rotational energy difference is not ℏ²/I, but something else.

Wait, the energy levels for a rigid rotor are E_J = (J (J+1) ℏ²) / (2I).

So the energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is E_1 - E_0 = [ (2 ℏ²)/(2I) ) ] -0 = ℏ²/(I).

Which is correct. So the calculation is right.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule as a rigid rotor, but the angular frequency given is the rotational frequency, not the vibrational. No, the question says it's the angular frequency of vibration.

Wait, maybe the given angular frequency is for the rotational motion. But no, the question states it's the vibration. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking about the transition that increases both vibrational and rotational states, but that would require more energy.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the types of transitions. For example, in electronic transitions, much higher energies are involved, but this is vibrational and rotational.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy to cause a transition to the next energy level, which includes both the rotational and vibrational contributions. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference is the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy differences. But that would be even larger than the vibrational alone, so that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which is a combination of rotational and vibrational changes, but that's more involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to compute the momentum using the vibrational energy difference. So, E_photon =4.21e-20 J, p =1.4e-28 kg m/s, which matches option D.

But why would the photon's energy be vibrational when the rotational transition is lower in energy? That doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe the mistake is that in the rigid rotor model, J starts at 0, and the next state is J=1. But the question is about a non-rigid rotor, which may have a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the non-rigid rotor model doesn't include the rigid rotor's rotational states but allows for bond length variation, so the moment of inertia changes, which affects the rotational energy levels. But I'm not sure how that would change the energy difference.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition to the next energy level in the combined rotational and vibrational spectrum. But that would probably require a more complex calculation.

But given the options, the only one that matches when considering the vibrational energy is option D:1.4e-28 kg m/s.

So perhaps the intended answer is option D, where the photon's energy is the vibrational transition.

But according to my earlier calculations, the rotational transition requires less energy. Therefore, I'm confused. Maybe the given options are wrong, but the problem expects us to compute based on the vibrational energy.

Another angle: perhaps the question is about the transition from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the first possible state, which might involve a vibrational transition, regardless of the rotational possibility.

But the rotational transition is lower in energy, so it should be the next state.

Wait, perhaps the model being used considers that the molecule can't undergo a rotational transition without a vibrational transition. But I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the transition to the next vibrational state, not considering the rotational states. But that would contradict the rotational transition being lower.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the question is using a different formula for the rotational energy. For example, sometimes the rotational constant B is used, where B = ℏ²/(2I c), but I'm not sure.

Wait, the rotational energy can be expressed as E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant.

B = ℏ²/(2I).

So E_rot for J=1 is 2B.

So ΔE_rot =2B -0=2B.

B = (1.05457e-34)^2 / (2 *1.207e-46) → (1.11e-68) / (2.414e-46) ≈4.6e-23 J.

Wait, wait, no, B is in Joules per J(J+1). So E_rot for J=1 is 2B.

Wait, let me compute B:

B = ℏ²/(2I) = (1.11e-68) / (2 *1.207e-46) ) =1.11e-68 /2.414e-46 ≈4.6e-23 J.

So E_rot for J=1 is 2 *4.6e-23 =9.2e-23 J. Which matches my earlier calculation.

So photon's energy is 9.2e-23 J.

p = E/c =9.2e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 kg m/s.

But the options are all way larger.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the reduced mass calculation.

Ah! Wait, Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

μ = (20 *2 )/(20 +2 ) =40/22=20/11=1.818... amu.

Wait, but wait, 1.818 amu is the reduced mass, but when converting to kg, I should multiply by 1.6605e-27 kg/amu.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the mass as the sum, not the reduced mass. But that would be incorrect because the moment of inertia uses the reduced mass for diatomic molecules. So that shouldn't be the case.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem assumes that the moment of inertia is I = (Mx + My) r², which would be incorrect, but perhaps the question made that mistake.

If I tried that, I= (20 +2 ) amu * (2e-10 m)^2.

22 amu =22 *1.6605e-27 kg =3.653e-26 kg.

I =3.653e-26 kg *4e-20 m² =1.461e-45 kg m².

Then ℏ²/I = (1.11e-68) /1.461e-45 ≈7.6e-24 J.

Then p =7.6e-24 /3e8 =2.53e-32 kg m/s.

Even smaller, not matching options.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the bond length in a different unit, like picometers. Wait, 2 angstroms is 200 pm. No, that wouldn't change the result significantly.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the momentum using the vibrational energy, leading to option D.

E_photon =4.21e-20 J.

p =4.21e-20 /3e8 =1.403e-28 kg m/s.

Which is approximately 1.4e-28 Ns. That's option D.

So perhaps the intended answer is D, but I'm not entirely sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the transition to the next vibrational state, which requires a photon with that energy.

But why would the next state be a vibrational one when a rotational transition is possible and lower in energy?

Perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the vibrational transition, not considering the rotational one. Maybe the question is simplified and assumes that the molecule is in a vibrational state only, ignoring rotation.

In that case, the photon's energy would be the vibrational energy difference, leading to option D.

But the question states it's using the rotation-vibration model, so it's considering both.

At this point, I think the intended answer is D) 1.4e-28 Ns, based on the vibrational transition. But I'm not entirely confident because my calculations suggest the rotational transition requires less energy.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, where the molecule transitions from its fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The key is to determine the energy difference for the transition and calculate the corresponding photon momentum.

### Key Calculations and Analysis:

1. **Reduced Mass (μ):**
   The reduced mass is calculated as:
   \[
   \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \, \text{amu} \times 2 \, \text{amu}}{20 \, \text{amu} + 2 \, \text{amu}} = \frac{40}{22} \, \text{amu} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
   \]
   Converting to kilograms:
   \[
   \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
   \]

2. **Moment of Inertia (I):**
   The moment of inertia is:
   \[
   I = \mu r^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}) \times (2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2.
   \]

3. **Rotational Energy Difference (ΔE_rot):**
   The rotational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_J = \frac{J (J+1) \hbar^2}{2I}.
   \]
   For \( J = 0 \) to \( J = 1 \):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E_1 - E_0 = \frac{(1 \cdot 2) \hbar^2}{2I} = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}.
   \]
   Using \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \cdot \text{s} \):
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.054 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.207 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
   \]

4. **Vibrational Energy Difference (ΔE_vib):**
   The vibrational energy levels are given by:
   \[
   E_v = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \nu,
   \]
   where \( \nu = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} \). The angular frequency is given as \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \), so:
   \[
   \nu = \frac{4 \times 10^{14}}{2\pi} \approx 6.366 \times 10^{13} \, \text{Hz}.
   \]
   The energy difference for the vibrational transition (\( v = 0 \to v = 1 \)) is:
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \nu = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (6.366 \times 10^{13}) \approx 4.21 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}.
   \]

5. **Comparison of Energy Differences:**
   The rotational transition requires significantly less energy (\( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \approx 9.21 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \)) compared to the vibrational transition (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 4.21 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \)). Therefore, the next state with the lowest possible energy is the rotational state (\( J = 1, v = 0 \)).

6. **Photon Momentum (p):**
   The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). Using \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} \):
   \[
   p = \frac{9.21 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
   \]

7. **Mismatch with Options:**
   The calculated momentum (\( 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s} \)) does not match any of the given options. However, if the vibrational transition is considered instead (\( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} \approx 4.21 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J} \)):
   \[
   p = \frac{4.21 \times 10^{-20}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 1.40 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{kg} \cdot \text{m/s}.
   \]
   This matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
While the rotational transition requires less energy, the problem may intend for the vibrational transition to be considered. Based on the given options, the most reasonable answer is:

**Answer: D**
