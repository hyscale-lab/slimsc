Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology, specifically about why a protein isn't being overexpressed in a transgenic mouse model. Let's break it down step by step.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They've introduced a coding sequence into a plasmid, modified to include a sequence for the hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and are trying to express the protein, but it's not working as expected. They provided the plus strand sequence, and I need to figure out why it's not working based on that.

First, I'll look at the construct's sequence. The question mentions that the researcher added a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. So the coding sequence should start with that tag. The sequence provided starts with ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). The next few codons would be the hemagglutinin tag.

Wait, let me think. The hemagglutinin (HA) tag is a common epitope tag, usually derived from the influenza HA protein. The HA tag is typically 11 amino acids long: YPYDVPDYA. But the question says they introduced the sequence for a single HA determinant. So perhaps the HA tag is added as a short peptide.

But wait, in the given sequence, after the ATG (start codon, methionine), the next codon is TAC. TAC is tyrosine. Then CCA is proline. CAT is histidine. So the next few codons are TAC CCA CAT... Hmm, that translates to TYR PRO His. Wait, the HA tag starts with YPYD... So the first few amino acids are YPYD. Let's see, in the sequence, the first codons after ATG are TAC (Y), then CCA (P), then CAT (H). So Y-P-H. Hmm, that's not matching the HA tag. Wait, the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. So the first three amino acids are Y-P-Y. So maybe the HA tag is being correctly added, but looking at the sequence, after the ATG, the first codon is TAC (Y), then CCA (P), then CAT (H). That's Y-P-H. But the HA tag after Y should be another Y. So either there's a mistake in the construct or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the HA tag is longer, or perhaps the given sequence is correct but I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the HA tag isn't the issue here. Let's think about the problem. The problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So possible issues could be things like a stop codon in the sequence, causing premature termination. Or maybe the sequences have frame shifts or cause the ribosome to terminate early.

Looking at the sequence, I should check for in-frame stop codons. The sequence provided is the sense strand, so it's the coding (plus) strand. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, and it's followed by more codons. The question is whether there are any TAA, TAG, or TGA codons within the sequence that would cause the ribosome to stop.

Looking for the stop codons in the DNA sequence. Remember that in the mRNA, stop codons are UAA, UAG, and UGA. In the DNA, the coding sense strand has the same sequence as the mRNA (except T instead of U). So the stop codons would be TAA, TAG, or TGA in the DNA. So I need to scan the given DNA sequence for any of these.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I'll read through it:

5' ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA 3'

I'll search the entire sequence for TGA, TAG, or TAA as triplets.

Looking through the sequence:

ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Let me look for any occurrence of TAG, TGA, or TAA.

Looking at the beginning: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Hmm, I spot TGA near the end. Let me see: Looking for the triplet near the end. The last few letters are ...TGA.

Wait, the very end is ...TGA. At the very end of the DNA sequence, it's GAGTGA. The last part is ...GCTGCGAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA.

Wait, in the DNA, the coding strand is written as 5' to 3'. The sequence ends with TGA in the DNA, which corresponds to TGA in the mRNA. So that's a stop codon.

But wait, when the mRNA is made from the DNA, the mRNA is complementary to the DNA. Since the DNA is the coding (sense) strand, the mRNA is the same as the sense strand except T becomes U. So if the DNA has TGA at the end, the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon.

So the construct ends with a stop codon. But wait, the construct should start with the HA tag and then the GADD45G coding sequence. The presence of a stop codon at the end would be normal because all proteins have a termination codon. But wait, if the vector is designed correctly, the stop codon would be after the GADD45G sequence. But in this case, the HA tag is added, so the construct would be: HA tag followed by GADD45G, ending with a stop codon.

But wait, perhaps the stop codon is introduced in the wrong place. Let me see the entire sequence again.

Wait, in the provided DNA sequence, the last part is ...GCGAGTGA. The last codon is TGA. So in the mRNA, this would be UGA, a stop codon. So that's correct for termination. But in the middle of the DNA sequence, is there any other stop codon that could be causing the problem?

Let me scan through the entire sequence for any TAG, TGA, or TAA.

Looking at each triplet:

Starting from the beginning:

ATG (start), TAC (Y), CCA (P), CAT (H), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), TCC (S), AGA (R), TAC (Y), CGC (R), CAA (Q), ATG (M), ACT (T), CTG (L), GGA (G), AGA (R), AGT (S), CCG (P), CGG (R), CCA (P), GAC (D), ACA (N), GGT (G), TCC (S), CGG (R), GAA (E), AGC (S), AGA (R), GCA (A), GGC (G), CGG (R), GAA (E), GCG (A), CTG (L), CAG (Q), ATG (M), CTT (L), TGT (C), GCT (A), TGT (C), GCT (A), TGG (W), GCT (A), GCG (A), GGT (G), AGA (R), GGC (G), GCT (A), CGT (R), GGC (G), GAT (D), GTG (V), CAG (Q), CGG (R), CTG (L), CCA (P), GGC (G), CGC (R), CGG (R), GCG (A), GAG (E), GAG (E), GCG (A), GGG (G), TGC (C), GCC (A), GGC (G), CGC (R), CGG (R), GCG (A), GAG (E), GAG (E), GCG (A), GGG (G), TGG (W), GCC (A), GCC (A), CGG (R), GCC (A), GGC (G), CGT (R), GGC (G), CTG (L), CAG (Q), CAT (H), TCC (S), TCT (S), TCG (S), CGA (R), GCT (A), TTA (L), TCG (S), AGA (R), GCT (A), CGA (R), GCT (A), CGG (R), CTG (L), GAG (E), TCT (S), GCT (A), GCG (A), CTG (L), CTA (L), TTA (L), CGA (R), CCC (P), CCA (P), CGC (R), CTG (L), GAG (E), AGC (S), TGT (C), GGT (G), TCC (S), CGT (R), GAT (D), TGT (C), TCT (S), GTG (V), GCT (A), TGG (W), GCG (A), GAT (D), GTG (V), CGC (R), GGC (G), GCT (A), CGG (R), GGC (G), CGA (R), GGT (G), TAT (Y), CGT (R), GGC (G), GGC (G), CGC (R), CGG (R), CGC (R), CGA (R), GCT (A), CTT (L), CGC (R), CGG (R), CGC (R), CGG (R), GCA (A), CTA (L), TGC (C), ATC (I), CCA (P), GCA (A), TCG (S), AGA (R), GCT (A), CGA (R), GCT (A), CGG (R), CGC (R), CTG (L), CCA (P), CCG (R), CGG (R), GCG (A), GAG (E), GAG (E), AGC (S), TGA (Stop).

Wait, so the only stop codon is at the very end. So the construct includes the HA tag, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence, and ends with a stop codon. So that seems normal.

Wait, but why isn't the protein being overexpressed?

Hmm, let's consider other possibilities. The problem says that the coding sequence for GADD45G is modified to include the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the construct is HA-GADD45G with a stop codon at the end.

But perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate prematurely because it's not followed by the correct stop codon. Wait, no, the HA tag is part of the coding sequence, so the ribosome reads through it until the end.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the HA tag introduces a premature stop codon. Let me check. The HA tag's DNA sequence would be the coding sequence for YPYDVPDYA. Let's see what that translates to. Y is TAC, P is CCA, Y is TAC, D is GAT, V is GTT, P is CCA, D is GAT, Y is TAC. So the HA coding sequence would be TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC. Let me check the given sequence: the first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So that's correct. So the HA tag is correctly added.

Hmm, so that doesn't seem to be the issue.

Another possibility is that the vector used doesn't have a suitable Kozak sequence, which is important for initiation of translation in mammalian cells. But the question doesn't mention anything about that, so maybe it's not the case.

Wait, looking back at the plasmid construction. The person introduced the HA tag at the N-terminus. But if the HA tag's coding sequence is correct, then the ribosome should correctly translate it and proceed.

Wait, perhaps the construct doesn't have a RBS (ribosome binding site) before the HA tag. Without a proper RBS, the ribosome may not initiate translation. But the question doesn't mention this either. Alternatively, maybe the RBS is present but not functional.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is with the presence of a stop codon in the HA tag. But in the sequence, it doesn't seem to have any stop codons.

Wait, but let me recheck the entire DNA sequence for any in-frame stop codons. I already saw the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. Any others?

Looking through the sequence again:

Looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA in triplets.

I see the very end is TGA, which is correct. Let's see elsewhere.

Looking at position around ...ACTGACCCGGGCTGCGGCGGCT...

Wait, I don't see any other TGA, TAG, or TAA in the rest of the sequence. So the only stop codon is at the end, which is correct.

Then why isn't the protein expressed?

Another possibility: Maybe the frame is incorrect. But the question states that the gene's coding sequence was modified by introducing the HA tag. If the HA tag is correctly added in frame, then the rest should be fine. Perhaps the HA tag is in the wrong frame, causing a frameshift. But in the given sequence, the HA tag is in the same reading frame as the GADD45G, so that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the initial ATG is in the wrong place. The construct starts with ATG, which is correct, but perhaps the HA tag was added in a way that the reading frame is shifted.

Wait, the initial part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

So the first few codons after the start are TAC (Y), CCA (P), CAT (H), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), TCC (S), AGA (R), TAC (Y), etc. So no stop codons until the very end.

But wait, the first few codons are part of the HA tag. So perhaps the HA tag is correctly added, but the construct is missing a necessary sequence for expression.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the construct doesn't have a termination codon, but that's not the case here. It does have a TGA at the end.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the issue is with the expression vector. They're using Lipofectamine to transfect CHO cells. Maybe the vector doesn't have a promoter that's functional in CHO cells. But again, the question doesn't mention that, so perhaps that's not the issue.

Wait, looking at the options provided:

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

So the HA tag's sequence is wrong, leading to incorrect epitope. How would that affect expression levels? Well, if the HA tag is mutated, the protein might not be expressed, but more likely, it would affect the detection (like in a Western blot) but not the expression. But the issue here is that the protein isn't being overexpressed at all.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

How would that happen? If there's a stop codon in the middle. But in this construct, the only stop is at the end. Unless there's an in-frame stop codon I'm not seeing. Wait, let me double-check.

Looking again for any TGA, TAG, or TAA in the sequence.

Wait, in the middle, I see 'CTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA'

Looking for triplets:

...ACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, I see 'TGA' again. Wait, in the middle, 'TGAACGTG' — that's TGA followed by ACGT. So the triplet is TGA, which is a stop codon.

Oh! So the sequence has another TGA in the middle, not at the end. Let me check:

Looking at the part: ...GCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAAT...

Wait, the substring is TGAAC, which is part of the triplet TGA. So the triplet is TGA, which is a stop codon.

So that's a problem. The construct has an in-frame stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate early. That would prevent the full-length protein from being expressed.

So the presence of this TGA in the middle would cause the protein to be truncated, but why isn't any protein being expressed? Wait, maybe the stop codon is near the beginning, causing the protein to be very small or not expressed at all.

Wait, where is this TGA located? Let's count the positions.

The main sequence is long, but let me find the exact spot where 'TGA' occurs as a triplet.

Looking for the exact triplet:

In the middle, I see:

...GGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAAT...

So the triplet is TGA at position: ...GTC TAC GAG TCA GCA AAG TCT TGA ACG TGG...

The triplet TGA is at the position where the DNA has TGA. So in the mRNA, it's UGA, which is a stop codon. So this would cause the ribosome to terminate early, producing a truncated protein.

So the presence of this internal stop codon would prevent the full-length HA-GADD45G protein from being expressed. Instead, the ribosome would stop at the TGA, producing a smaller protein, or perhaps the initiation is so early that the protein isn't detected, leading the researcher to think it's not being expressed.

So why is this happening?

Because the researcher modified the gene by adding the HA tag, perhaps they introduced a mutation that created this stop codon. Alternatively, during cloning, an unintended stop codon was introduced.

Looking back at the options:

Option B says the ribosome terminated the translation early. That would be due to a premature stop codon, which in this case is present in the middle.

Option D talks about a missing tRNA for UAA. But the stop codon here is TGA, which is UGA in mRNA. So D might not apply because the mouse's tRNA for UGA is present (though UGA is a stop codon, and generally not read as cysteine unless there's a tRNA with that codon, which is rare).

Option C is about a lack of linker causing proteolysis. If the HA tag were missing a linker, the protein might be degraded, but the expression issue is more about not being expressed, not being unstable after expression.

Option A is about a missense mutation in the HA determinant. But that would affect the epitope, not necessarily the expression level. The protein would still be produced, just not recognized by the antibody.

Wait, but in the construct, the HA tag is correctly added, but there's a premature stop codon in the middle. So the correct answer would be that the construct has an internal stop codon, leading to early termination.

Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would be the case.

But let me check the options again:

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Yes, that's exactly what happened because of the TGA codon in the middle.

But wait, the question says that the protein isn't overexpressed. If the protein is being made but is truncated, perhaps it's not detected because the antibody (anti-HA) can't recognize the small peptide. Alternatively, the truncated protein might be unstable or not functional.

But the researcher is using the HA tag to affinity-purify the protein. If the HA tag is before the stop codon, then the truncated protein would still have the HA tag and could be purified. But perhaps in the construct, the HA tag is followed by a stop codon. No, in this case, the HA tag is at the beginning. The stop codon is in the middle of the GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait, no. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the HA coding is before the GADD45G. So the stop codon is in the middle of the GADD45G coding sequence. So the HA tag is present, followed by the GADD45G, but the stop codon is in the middle of GADD45G. So the resulting protein would be HA-tagged, but only part of GADD45G would be present. So the protein would be shorter than expected but still have the HA tag. But the researcher would still detect it if they use an anti-HA antibody. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the stop codon is causing the mRNA to be subject to nonsense-mediated decay. If the mRNA has a premature stop codon, the cell's quality control mechanisms may degrade the mRNA, leading to less protein production.

But in that case, the construct would produce very little protein, which might be hard to detect. However, the question states that the researcher was unable to overexpress the protein as expected.

Wait, let me think about the reason for the stop codon. The researcher introduced the HA tag. Maybe the cloning process introduced a mutation, like a frameshift, which introduced a stop codon. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence included a stop codon.

Wait, in the given sequence, the HA tag is correctly added. Let me recheck the initial part.

The first few codons after ATG are TAC (Y), CCA (P), CAT (H), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), TCC (S), AGA (R), TAC (Y), CGC (R), CAA (Q), ATG (M), etc. So that's the HA tag (YPYDVPDY) followed by M (ATG) and the rest.

Wait, the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. So the DNA sequence for the HA tag would be TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC.

In the given sequence, the first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the first 18 nucleotides after ATG are TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA. Let me translate that:

TAC = Y

CCA = P

TAC = Y

GAT = D

GTA = V

TCC = S

AGA = R

TTA = L

So the HA tag is YPYD... but the next amino acid after the HA would be V, S, R, L.

Wait, the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. So after YPYD (first four amino acids), the next is VP. So the first few codons after the HA should be GTT (V), CCA (P), etc.

But in the given sequence, after the initial HA tag, the next codons are GTA (V), TCC (S), etc. So after VP (GTT CCA), the next codon is TAC (Y). Wait, that's not matching the HA tag. The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. So the HA coding sequence should be TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC.

Wait, this would translate to Y P Y D V P Y.

In the given DNA, the first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

So the first 18 nucleotides after ATG are TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA.

Which is: Y P Y D V S R L.

Wait, that's not matching the HA tag. The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, which would translate to Y P Y D V P Y.

But in the given sequence, after Y P Y D, we have V S R L.

So perhaps the HA tag is incorrectly cloned. Instead of VP, it has VS. That would mean a substitution in the HA tag, which would make it a missense mutation. So option A is about the HA determinant having a missense mutation.

But wait, the presence of the stop codon in the middle would cause the protein to terminate earlier, leading to no full-length protein. So which issue is causing the lack of expression?

In the given scenario, the researcher can't overexpress the protein. If the HA tag has a mutation (option A), the HA tag would be incorrect, but the rest of the protein might still be expressed. However, if the HA tag is mutated, the researcher might not detect the protein via the HA epitope, thinking it's not expressed. But the question says they couldn't overexpress the protein. So perhaps the problem is that the HA tag is causing expression issues, like improper folding or something else. But more likely, the presence of the stop codon is the main issue.

But wait, the issue is that the HA tag is correctly added, but the GADD45G coding sequence has a premature stop codon. So the construct produces a truncated protein, which is detected if the HA tag is intact, but the researcher may not notice it because they're looking for overexpression. Alternatively, perhaps the truncated protein is not functional, but the question is about expression.

Wait, the problem arises because the HA tag is at the N-terminus, followed by GADD45G. The stop codon is in the middle of GADD45G. So the HA tag is present, and the protein would be produced up to that stop codon. So the researcher should be able to detect a smaller HA-tagged protein. But perhaps they designed the construct expecting a longer protein and didn't check for the smaller band, or the construct isn't producing enough of the truncated protein to be considered overexpression.

But the question states that the researcher couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. So perhaps the presence of the stop codon is causing the mRNA to be targeted for degradation, due to the presence of a premature stop codon. This is known as nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), where the cell degrades mRNA with premature stop codons to prevent the production of faulty proteins.

If the mRNA is degraded, the protein isn't produced in sufficient quantities, leading to the observation that the protein isn't overexpressed.

So the problem is the presence of a premature stop codon in the coding sequence, causing the mRNA to be degraded.

In that case, the reason the protein isn't being expressed is because the construct contains an internal stop codon (TGA) in the middle of the coding sequence, leading to early termination and possibly mRNA degradation.

Looking back at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early, which would be a result of the premature stop codon. However, the initial problem is that the mRNA may be degraded, so the ribosome never even gets to translate it. But the question is about the ribosome's activity, not the mRNA stability.

Alternatively, the presence of the stop codon would cause the ribosome to terminate early, producing a truncated protein. If the HA tag is correctly added, the protein would be expressed but not full-length. But the researcher is looking for overexpression of the full-length protein, which isn't happening because it's either not made or made in small amounts.

So, the correct answer would be that there's a premature stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate early (option B). But wait, the options don't include an option about the premature stop codon. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) Missense mutation in HA determinant.

B) Ribosome terminated early.

C) Lack of linker causing proteolysis.

D) No tRNA for UAA.

Hmm, option B is the ribosome terminating early, which is due to the presence of a stop codon. So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but why is the stop codon present? Because the researcher introduced a mutation or error during cloning that added a TGA in the middle of the coding sequence. So the problem is that the construct has a premature stop codon, leading to early termination.

So the correct answer is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein, modified to include a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus, is not expressing the protein as expected. The provided DNA sequence of the construct was analyzed to determine the cause.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Construct Design**: The construct includes the HA tag at the N-terminus, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence, and ends with a stop codon (TGA). This is consistent with proper protein termination.

2. **Premature Stop Codon**: A critical observation is the presence of an **internal stop codon (TGA)** in the middle of the coding sequence. This stop codon is not at the end but appears earlier in the sequence, specifically in the GADD45G coding region. This stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, preventing the full-length protein from being expressed.

3. **Impact on Expression**: The premature stop codon likely results in the production of a truncated protein. However, the HA tag remains intact at the N-terminus, meaning the truncated protein could still be detectable via anti-HA antibodies. The lack of full-length protein expression aligns with the researcher's observation of failed overexpression.

4. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: A missense mutation in the HA tag would affect the epitope but not necessarily prevent protein expression. The HA tag would still be present, allowing detection of the protein. This does not explain the lack of overexpression.
   - **Option B**: The premature stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, leading to the production of only a truncated protein. This matches the observed issue of failed overexpression of the full-length protein.
   - **Option C**: A lack of linker sequence could lead to proteolysis, but this would not prevent the initial expression of the protein. The issue here is the absence of full-length protein, not post-translational degradation.
   - **Option D**: The absence of a tRNA for UAA (a stop codon) is irrelevant because the stop codon in question is TGA, which is a standard stop codon recognized by the translation machinery.

### Conclusion:
The presence of a premature stop codon (TGA) in the middle of the coding sequence is the primary cause of the issue. This stop codon leads to early termination of translation, preventing the expression of the full-length GADD45G protein. This aligns with **Option B**, which states that the ribosome terminated the translation early.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology, specifically about why a protein isn't being overexpressed in a transgenic mouse model. Let's break it down step by step.

The scenario is that someone is trying to create a transgenic mouse model where the GADD45G protein is overexpressed. They've introduced a coding sequence into a plasmid, modified to include a sequence for the hemagglutinin antigen at the N-terminus. They transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and are trying to express the protein, but it's not working as expected. They provided the plus strand sequence, and I need to figure out why it's not working based on that.

First, I'll look at the construct's sequence. The question mentions that the researcher added a hemagglutinin tag at the N-terminus. So the coding sequence should start with that tag. The sequence provided starts with ATG, which is the start codon (methionine). The next few codons would be the hemagglutinin tag.

Wait, let me think. The hemagglutinin (HA) tag is a common epitope tag, usually derived from the influenza HA protein. The HA tag is typically 11 amino acids long: YPYDVPDYA. But the question says they introduced the sequence for a single HA determinant. So perhaps the HA tag is added as a short peptide.

But wait, in the given sequence, after the ATG (start codon, methionine), the next codon is TAC. TAC is tyrosine. Then CCA is proline. CAT is histidine. So the next few codons are TAC CCA CAT... Hmm, that translates to TYR PRO His. Wait, the HA tag starts with YPYD... So the first few amino acids are YPYD. Let's see, in the sequence, the first codons after ATG are TAC (Y), then CCA (P), then CAT (H). So Y-P-H. Hmm, that's not matching the HA tag. Wait, the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. So the first three amino acids are Y-P-Y. So maybe the HA tag is being correctly added, but looking at the sequence, after the ATG, the first codon is TAC (Y), then CCA (P), then CAT (H). That's Y-P-H. But the HA tag after Y should be another Y. So either there's a mistake in the construct or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the HA tag is longer, or perhaps the given sequence is correct but I'm misinterpreting it. Alternatively, maybe the HA tag isn't the issue here. Let's think about the problem. The problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. So possible issues could be things like a stop codon in the sequence, causing premature termination. Or maybe the sequences have frame shifts or cause the ribosome to terminate early.

Looking at the sequence, I should check for in-frame stop codons. The sequence provided is the sense strand, so it's the coding (plus) strand. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the start codon, and it's followed by more codons. The question is whether there are any TAA, TAG, or TGA codons within the sequence that would cause the ribosome to stop.

Looking for the stop codons in the DNA sequence. Remember that in the mRNA, stop codons are UAA, UAG, and UGA. In the DNA, the coding sense strand has the same sequence as the mRNA (except T instead of U). So the stop codons would be TAA, TAG, or TGA in the DNA. So I need to scan the given DNA sequence for any of these.

Looking at the provided DNA sequence, I'll read through it:

5' ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA 3'

I'll search the entire sequence for TGA, TAG, or TAA as triplets.

Looking through the sequence:

ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Let me look for any occurrence of TAG, TGA, or TAA.

Looking at the beginning: ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

Hmm, I spot TGA near the end. Let me see: Looking for the triplet near the end. The last few letters are ...TGA.

Wait, the very end is ...TGA. At the very end of the DNA sequence, it's GAGTGA. The last part is ...GCTGCGAGTGA. So the last codon is TGA.

Wait, in the DNA, the coding strand is written as 5' to 3'. The sequence ends with TGA in the DNA, which corresponds to TGA in the mRNA. So that's a stop codon.

But wait, when the mRNA is made from the DNA, the mRNA is complementary to the DNA. Since the DNA is the coding (sense) strand, the mRNA is the same as the sense strand except T becomes U. So if the DNA has TGA at the end, the mRNA would have UGA, which is a stop codon.

So the construct ends with a stop codon. But wait, the construct should start with the HA tag and then the GADD45G coding sequence. The presence of a stop codon at the end would be normal because all proteins have a termination codon. But wait, if the vector is designed correctly, the stop codon would be after the GADD45G sequence. But in this case, the HA tag is added, so the construct would be: HA tag followed by GADD45G, ending with a stop codon.

But wait, perhaps the stop codon is introduced in the wrong place. Let me see the entire sequence again.

Wait, in the provided DNA sequence, the last part is ...GCGAGTGA. The last codon is TGA. So in the mRNA, this would be UGA, a stop codon. So that's correct for termination. But in the middle of the DNA sequence, is there any other stop codon that could be causing the problem?

Let me scan through the entire sequence for any TAG, TGA, or TAA.

Looking at each triplet:

Starting from the beginning:

ATG (start), TAC (Y), CCA (P), CAT (H), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), TCC (S), AGA (R), TAC (Y), CGC (R), CAA (Q), ATG (M), ACT (T), CTG (L), GGA (G), AGA (R), AGT (S), CCG (P), CGG (R), CCA (P), GAC (D), ACA (N), GGT (G), TCC (S), CGG (R), GAA (E), AGC (S), AGA (R), GCA (A), GGC (G), CGG (R), GAA (E), GCG (A), CTG (L), CAG (Q), ATG (M), CTT (L), TGT (C), GCT (A), TGT (C), GCT (A), TGG (W), GCT (A), GCG (A), GGT (G), AGA (R), GGC (G), GCT (A), CGT (R), GGC (G), GAT (D), GTG (V), CAG (Q), CGG (R), CTG (L), CCA (P), GGC (G), CGC (R), CGG (R), GCG (A), GAG (E), GAG (E), GCG (A), GGG (G), TGC (C), GCC (A), GGC (G), CGC (R), CGG (R), GCG (A), GAG (E), GAG (E), GCG (A), GGG (G), TGG (W), GCC (A), GCC (A), CGG (R), GCC (A), GGC (G), CGT (R), GGC (G), CTG (L), CAG (Q), CAT (H), TCC (S), TCT (S), TCG (S), CGA (R), GCT (A), TTA (L), TCG (S), AGA (R), GCT (A), CGA (R), GCT (A), CGG (R), CTG (L), GAG (E), TCT (S), GCT (A), GCG (A), CTG (L), CTA (L), TTA (L), CGA (R), CCC (P), CCA (P), CGC (R), CTG (L), GAG (E), AGC (S), TGT (C), GGT (G), TCC (S), CGT (R), GAT (D), TGT (C), TCT (S), GTG (V), GCT (A), TGG (W), GCG (A), GAT (D), GTG (V), CGC (R), GGC (G), GCT (A), CGG (R), GGC (G), CGA (R), GGT (G), TAT (Y), CGT (R), GGC (G), GGC (G), CGC (R), CGG (R), CGC (R), CGA (R), GCT (A), CTT (L), CGC (R), CGG (R), CGC (R), CGG (R), GCA (A), CTA (L), TGC (C), ATC (I), CCA (P), GCA (A), TCG (S), AGA (R), GCT (A), CGA (R), GCT (A), CGG (R), CGC (R), CTG (L), CCA (P), CCG (R), CGG (R), GCG (A), GAG (E), GAG (E), AGC (S), TGA (Stop).

Wait, so the only stop codon is at the very end. So the construct includes the HA tag, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence, and ends with a stop codon. So that seems normal.

Wait, but why isn't the protein being overexpressed?

Hmm, let's consider other possibilities. The problem says that the coding sequence for GADD45G is modified to include the HA tag at the N-terminus. So the construct is HA-GADD45G with a stop codon at the end.

But perhaps the HA tag is causing the ribosome to terminate prematurely because it's not followed by the correct stop codon. Wait, no, the HA tag is part of the coding sequence, so the ribosome reads through it until the end.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the HA tag introduces a premature stop codon. Let me check. The HA tag's DNA sequence would be the coding sequence for YPYDVPDYA. Let's see what that translates to. Y is TAC, P is CCA, Y is TAC, D is GAT, V is GTT, P is CCA, D is GAT, Y is TAC. So the HA coding sequence would be TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC. Let me check the given sequence: the first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT G... So that's correct. So the HA tag is correctly added.

Hmm, so that doesn't seem to be the issue.

Another possibility is that the vector used doesn't have a suitable Kozak sequence, which is important for initiation of translation in mammalian cells. But the question doesn't mention anything about that, so maybe it's not the case.

Wait, looking back at the plasmid construction. The person introduced the HA tag at the N-terminus. But if the HA tag's coding sequence is correct, then the ribosome should correctly translate it and proceed.

Wait, perhaps the construct doesn't have a RBS (ribosome binding site) before the HA tag. Without a proper RBS, the ribosome may not initiate translation. But the question doesn't mention this either. Alternatively, maybe the RBS is present but not functional.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is with the presence of a stop codon in the HA tag. But in the sequence, it doesn't seem to have any stop codons.

Wait, but let me recheck the entire DNA sequence for any in-frame stop codons. I already saw the last codon is TGA, which is a stop. Any others?

Looking through the sequence again:

Looking for TGA, TAG, or TAA in triplets.

I see the very end is TGA, which is correct. Let's see elsewhere.

Looking at position around ...ACTGACCCGGGCTGCGGCGGCT...

Wait, I don't see any other TGA, TAG, or TAA in the rest of the sequence. So the only stop codon is at the end, which is correct.

Then why isn't the protein expressed?

Another possibility: Maybe the frame is incorrect. But the question states that the gene's coding sequence was modified by introducing the HA tag. If the HA tag is correctly added in frame, then the rest should be fine. Perhaps the HA tag is in the wrong frame, causing a frameshift. But in the given sequence, the HA tag is in the same reading frame as the GADD45G, so that's not the issue.

Wait, perhaps the initial ATG is in the wrong place. The construct starts with ATG, which is correct, but perhaps the HA tag was added in a way that the reading frame is shifted.

Wait, the initial part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA

So the first few codons after the start are TAC (Y), CCA (P), CAT (H), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), TCC (S), AGA (R), TAC (Y), etc. So no stop codons until the very end.

But wait, the first few codons are part of the HA tag. So perhaps the HA tag is correctly added, but the construct is missing a necessary sequence for expression.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the construct doesn't have a termination codon, but that's not the case here. It does have a TGA at the end.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the issue is with the expression vector. They're using Lipofectamine to transfect CHO cells. Maybe the vector doesn't have a promoter that's functional in CHO cells. But again, the question doesn't mention that, so perhaps that's not the issue.

Wait, looking at the options provided:

Option A: The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation.

So the HA tag's sequence is wrong, leading to incorrect epitope. How would that affect expression levels? Well, if the HA tag is mutated, the protein might not be expressed, but more likely, it would affect the detection (like in a Western blot) but not the expression. But the issue here is that the protein isn't being overexpressed at all.

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

How would that happen? If there's a stop codon in the middle. But in this construct, the only stop is at the end. Unless there's an in-frame stop codon I'm not seeing. Wait, let me double-check.

Looking again for any TGA, TAG, or TAA in the sequence.

Wait, in the middle, I see 'CTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA'

Looking for triplets:

...ACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, I see 'TGA' again. Wait, in the middle, 'TGAACGTG' — that's TGA followed by ACGT. So the triplet is TGA, which is a stop codon.

Oh! So the sequence has another TGA in the middle, not at the end. Let me check:

Looking at the part: ...GCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAAT...

Wait, the substring is TGAAC, which is part of the triplet TGA. So the triplet is TGA, which is a stop codon.

So that's a problem. The construct has an in-frame stop codon in the middle of the coding sequence, causing the ribosome to terminate early. That would prevent the full-length protein from being expressed.

So the presence of this TGA in the middle would cause the protein to be truncated, but why isn't any protein being expressed? Wait, maybe the stop codon is near the beginning, causing the protein to be very small or not expressed at all.

Wait, where is this TGA located? Let's count the positions.

The main sequence is long, but let me find the exact spot where 'TGA' occurs as a triplet.

Looking for the exact triplet:

In the middle, I see:

...GGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAAT...

So the triplet is TGA at position: ...GTC TAC GAG TCA GCA AAG TCT TGA ACG TGG...

The triplet TGA is at the position where the DNA has TGA. So in the mRNA, it's UGA, which is a stop codon. So this would cause the ribosome to terminate early, producing a truncated protein.

So the presence of this internal stop codon would prevent the full-length HA-GADD45G protein from being expressed. Instead, the ribosome would stop at the TGA, producing a smaller protein, or perhaps the initiation is so early that the protein isn't detected, leading the researcher to think it's not being expressed.

So why is this happening?

Because the researcher modified the gene by adding the HA tag, perhaps they introduced a mutation that created this stop codon. Alternatively, during cloning, an unintended stop codon was introduced.

Looking back at the options:

Option B says the ribosome terminated the translation early. That would be due to a premature stop codon, which in this case is present in the middle.

Option D talks about a missing tRNA for UAA. But the stop codon here is TGA, which is UGA in mRNA. So D might not apply because the mouse's tRNA for UGA is present (though UGA is a stop codon, and generally not read as cysteine unless there's a tRNA with that codon, which is rare).

Option C is about a lack of linker causing proteolysis. If the HA tag were missing a linker, the protein might be degraded, but the expression issue is more about not being expressed, not being unstable after expression.

Option A is about a missense mutation in the HA determinant. But that would affect the epitope, not necessarily the expression level. The protein would still be produced, just not recognized by the antibody.

Wait, but in the construct, the HA tag is correctly added, but there's a premature stop codon in the middle. So the correct answer would be that the construct has an internal stop codon, leading to early termination.

Looking at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early. That would be the case.

But let me check the options again:

Option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.

Yes, that's exactly what happened because of the TGA codon in the middle.

But wait, the question says that the protein isn't overexpressed. If the protein is being made but is truncated, perhaps it's not detected because the antibody (anti-HA) can't recognize the small peptide. Alternatively, the truncated protein might be unstable or not functional.

But the researcher is using the HA tag to affinity-purify the protein. If the HA tag is before the stop codon, then the truncated protein would still have the HA tag and could be purified. But perhaps in the construct, the HA tag is followed by a stop codon. No, in this case, the HA tag is at the beginning. The stop codon is in the middle of the GADD45G coding sequence.

Wait, no. The HA tag is at the N-terminus, so the HA coding is before the GADD45G. So the stop codon is in the middle of the GADD45G coding sequence. So the HA tag is present, followed by the GADD45G, but the stop codon is in the middle of GADD45G. So the resulting protein would be HA-tagged, but only part of GADD45G would be present. So the protein would be shorter than expected but still have the HA tag. But the researcher would still detect it if they use an anti-HA antibody. So why isn't the protein being expressed?

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the stop codon is causing the mRNA to be subject to nonsense-mediated decay. If the mRNA has a premature stop codon, the cell's quality control mechanisms may degrade the mRNA, leading to less protein production.

But in that case, the construct would produce very little protein, which might be hard to detect. However, the question states that the researcher was unable to overexpress the protein as expected.

Wait, let me think about the reason for the stop codon. The researcher introduced the HA tag. Maybe the cloning process introduced a mutation, like a frameshift, which introduced a stop codon. Alternatively, perhaps the HA tag's sequence included a stop codon.

Wait, in the given sequence, the HA tag is correctly added. Let me recheck the initial part.

The first few codons after ATG are TAC (Y), CCA (P), CAT (H), TAC (Y), GAT (D), GTT (V), TCC (S), AGA (R), TAC (Y), CGC (R), CAA (Q), ATG (M), etc. So that's the HA tag (YPYDVPDY) followed by M (ATG) and the rest.

Wait, the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. So the DNA sequence for the HA tag would be TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC.

In the given sequence, the first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

Wait, the first 18 nucleotides after ATG are TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA. Let me translate that:

TAC = Y

CCA = P

TAC = Y

GAT = D

GTA = V

TCC = S

AGA = R

TTA = L

So the HA tag is YPYD... but the next amino acid after the HA would be V, S, R, L.

Wait, the HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. So after YPYD (first four amino acids), the next is VP. So the first few codons after the HA should be GTT (V), CCA (P), etc.

But in the given sequence, after the initial HA tag, the next codons are GTA (V), TCC (S), etc. So after VP (GTT CCA), the next codon is TAC (Y). Wait, that's not matching the HA tag. The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA. So the HA coding sequence should be TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC.

Wait, this would translate to Y P Y D V P Y.

In the given DNA, the first part is ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA CGC CAA ATG ACT CTG GAA GAA GTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA.

So the first 18 nucleotides after ATG are TAC CCA TAC GAT GTA TCC AGA TTA.

Which is: Y P Y D V S R L.

Wait, that's not matching the HA tag. The HA tag is YPYDVPDYA, which would translate to Y P Y D V P Y.

But in the given sequence, after Y P Y D, we have V S R L.

So perhaps the HA tag is incorrectly cloned. Instead of VP, it has VS. That would mean a substitution in the HA tag, which would make it a missense mutation. So option A is about the HA determinant having a missense mutation.

But wait, the presence of the stop codon in the middle would cause the protein to terminate earlier, leading to no full-length protein. So which issue is causing the lack of expression?

In the given scenario, the researcher can't overexpress the protein. If the HA tag has a mutation (option A), the HA tag would be incorrect, but the rest of the protein might still be expressed. However, if the HA tag is mutated, the researcher might not detect the protein via the HA epitope, thinking it's not expressed. But the question says they couldn't overexpress the protein. So perhaps the problem is that the HA tag is causing expression issues, like improper folding or something else. But more likely, the presence of the stop codon is the main issue.

But wait, the issue is that the HA tag is correctly added, but the GADD45G coding sequence has a premature stop codon. So the construct produces a truncated protein, which is detected if the HA tag is intact, but the researcher may not notice it because they're looking for overexpression. Alternatively, perhaps the truncated protein is not functional, but the question is about expression.

Wait, the problem arises because the HA tag is at the N-terminus, followed by GADD45G. The stop codon is in the middle of GADD45G. So the HA tag is present, and the protein would be produced up to that stop codon. So the researcher should be able to detect a smaller HA-tagged protein. But perhaps they designed the construct expecting a longer protein and didn't check for the smaller band, or the construct isn't producing enough of the truncated protein to be considered overexpression.

But the question states that the researcher couldn't overexpress the protein as expected. So perhaps the presence of the stop codon is causing the mRNA to be targeted for degradation, due to the presence of a premature stop codon. This is known as nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), where the cell degrades mRNA with premature stop codons to prevent the production of faulty proteins.

If the mRNA is degraded, the protein isn't produced in sufficient quantities, leading to the observation that the protein isn't overexpressed.

So the problem is the presence of a premature stop codon in the coding sequence, causing the mRNA to be degraded.

In that case, the reason the protein isn't being expressed is because the construct contains an internal stop codon (TGA) in the middle of the coding sequence, leading to early termination and possibly mRNA degradation.

Looking back at the options, option B says the ribosome terminated early, which would be a result of the premature stop codon. However, the initial problem is that the mRNA may be degraded, so the ribosome never even gets to translate it. But the question is about the ribosome's activity, not the mRNA stability.

Alternatively, the presence of the stop codon would cause the ribosome to terminate early, producing a truncated protein. If the HA tag is correctly added, the protein would be expressed but not full-length. But the researcher is looking for overexpression of the full-length protein, which isn't happening because it's either not made or made in small amounts.

So, the correct answer would be that there's a premature stop codon, causing the ribosome to terminate early (option B). But wait, the options don't include an option about the premature stop codon. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) Missense mutation in HA determinant.

B) Ribosome terminated early.

C) Lack of linker causing proteolysis.

D) No tRNA for UAA.

Hmm, option B is the ribosome terminating early, which is due to the presence of a stop codon. So the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but why is the stop codon present? Because the researcher introduced a mutation or error during cloning that added a TGA in the middle of the coding sequence. So the problem is that the construct has a premature stop codon, leading to early termination.

So the correct answer is B.


The question involves identifying why a transgenic mouse model with inducible overexpression of the GADD45G protein, modified to include a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the N-terminus, is not expressing the protein as expected. The provided DNA sequence of the construct was analyzed to determine the cause.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Construct Design**: The construct includes the HA tag at the N-terminus, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence, and ends with a stop codon (TGA). This is consistent with proper protein termination.

2. **Premature Stop Codon**: A critical observation is the presence of an **internal stop codon (TGA)** in the middle of the coding sequence. This stop codon is not at the end but appears earlier in the sequence, specifically in the GADD45G coding region. This stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation prematurely, preventing the full-length protein from being expressed.

3. **Impact on Expression**: The premature stop codon likely results in the production of a truncated protein. However, the HA tag remains intact at the N-terminus, meaning the truncated protein could still be detectable via anti-HA antibodies. The lack of full-length protein expression aligns with the researcher's observation of failed overexpression.

4. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: A missense mutation in the HA tag would affect the epitope but not necessarily prevent protein expression. The HA tag would still be present, allowing detection of the protein. This does not explain the lack of overexpression.
   - **Option B**: The premature stop codon causes the ribosome to terminate translation early, leading to the production of only a truncated protein. This matches the observed issue of failed overexpression of the full-length protein.
   - **Option C**: A lack of linker sequence could lead to proteolysis, but this would not prevent the initial expression of the protein. The issue here is the absence of full-length protein, not post-translational degradation.
   - **Option D**: The absence of a tRNA for UAA (a stop codon) is irrelevant because the stop codon in question is TGA, which is a standard stop codon recognized by the translation machinery.

### Conclusion:
The presence of a premature stop codon (TGA) in the middle of the coding sequence is the primary cause of the issue. This stop codon leads to early termination of translation, preventing the expression of the full-length GADD45G protein. This aligns with **Option B**, which states that the ribosome terminated the translation early.
