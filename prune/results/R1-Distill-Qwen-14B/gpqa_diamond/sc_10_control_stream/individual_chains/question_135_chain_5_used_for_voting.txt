Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Hmm, let's try to work through it. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about the possible decay modes of a boson X. The Lagrangian is given, and some other info is provided. Let me parse what I know.

The Lagrangian is L(y) = -λ f ψ_f(y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). Wait, that looks a bit confusing. I think it's a Yukawa-type interaction term. Oh right, Yukawa couplings are between fermions and bosons, like in the Higgs mechanism. So the interaction is between the boson X and some fermions.

The mass of X is 6 GeV. So when X decays, it has to produce particles whose combined mass is less than 6 GeV, right? Because in decay processes, the rest mass of the parent must be greater than the sum of the rest masses of the decay products.

Wait, but wait. The mass of the boson is 6 GeV. So the decay products' rest mass must be less than 6 GeV. So any fermion pair that X can decay into must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV.

Now, the problem is about which fermion pairs are kinematically allowed. Let's look at the options given.

Options A, B, C, D list various decay channels. Each option includes different fermion-antifermion pairs. I need to figure out which of these pairs have a combined mass below 6 GeV.

First, let's recall the masses of the known fermions.

Let's list the quarks and leptons:

Leptons:
- Electron (e^-): mass ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ^-): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ^-): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: negligible mass, but in pair production, like νν̄, but since neutrinos are light, their decay products won't affect the mass much. But the problem is about X → f f̄, so for charged leptons.

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~0.003 GeV
- Down (d): ~0.005 GeV
- Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.275 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV. But X is only 6 GeV, so top quark pairs are out.

So when X decays into a fermion-antifermion pair, the sum of their masses must be less than 6 GeV.

Let me go through each of the possible fermion pairs in the options:

Option A: b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, e+ e−.

Wait, but the bottom quark is about 4 GeV. So if X is 6 GeV, then the pair b b̄ would have a mass of about 8.26 GeV (each 4.13, so 2*4.13 = 8.26). That's way above 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄ because the sum is higher than X's mass. So option A is out because it includes b and s. Wait, s is strange, which is about 0.095 GeV each. So s s̄ would be 0.19 GeV, which is allowed. But if the option includes b, which is not allowed, then it's incorrect.

Wait, but looking at the options again. Let me check each option.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, e+e−. So including b and s. But b's mass is about 4 GeV. So each b is 4 GeV, so 2*4=8, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄. So any option that includes b as a decay product is incorrect.

So option A is out because it includes b.

Option B: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

The charm quark is about 1.275 GeV each, so 2.55 GeV total. That's less than 6 GeV, so that's allowed. The other pairs in option B: s is 0.095, so 0.19 GeV. u is negligible, same with d. tau is about 1.78 GeV each, so 3.56 GeV. All are below 6.

So option B's decay products are all allowed.

Option C: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, τ+τ−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. But wait, top quark is 173 GeV. So t t̄ would be 346 GeV, way above 6 GeV. So option C is invalid because it includes t. So C is out.

Option D: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. Again, b is too heavy. So D is out.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So the only options that have possible decay channels are B and possibly others. But let's recheck.

Wait, the problem states that the interaction is given by the Lagrangian. Let me look at the Lagrangian again.

The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (v + X) ψ_f. Hmm, maybe I should parse this correctly.

Wait, I think the correct way to interpret the Lagrangian is that it's a Yukawa interaction term. The general form is L = - g ψ ψ X, where ψ is a fermion field, and X is the boson. So the interaction term would be something like L = -λ f ψ_f X ψ_f.

Wait, the given Lagrangian is -λ f ψ_f (v + X) ψ_f. So perhaps it's written as -λ f ψ_f X ψ_f, with v being a constant, possibly the vacuum expectation value (VEV). So in this term, the interaction between X and the fermion ψ_f is present. So the fermions that X can interact with are the ones present in this term.

Wait, so the fermion ψ_f could be any of the possible fermions, but the problem is about which particles X can decay into. So only the fermions that are present in the interaction term can be decay products.

Wait, but in the given Lagrangian, ψ_f is a specific fermion, right? Because the term is written as ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So perhaps ψ_f is a specific fermion, maybe a charged lepton or a quark.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify what ψ_f is. So perhaps the interaction is with all possible fermions f. Hmm, but the problem doesn't give more info, so maybe we can assume that the interaction is possible for all fermions, but in reality, the decay depends on whether the fermion mass is allowed.

Wait, but the problem states that the interaction is given, and the mass of X is 6 GeV, so the possible decay products are those whose combined mass is less than 6 GeV.

Wait, but maybe the fermions ψ_f are all the possible fermions, but the decay is possible only if the pair's mass is less than X's mass.

So the possible decays would be any fermion-antifermion pair where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

So m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's list the fermion masses again:

Leptons:
- e: 0.0005 GeV → 2m_e ≈ 0.001 GeV. Allowed.
- mu: 0.105 GeV → 0.21 GeV. Allowed.
- tau: 1.78 GeV → 3.56 GeV. Allowed.

Quarks:
- u: 0.003 → 0.006 GeV. Allowed.
- d: 0.005 → 0.01 GeV. Allowed.
- s: 0.095 → 0.19 GeV. Allowed.
- c: 1.275 → 2.55 GeV. Allowed.
- b: 4.13 → 8.26 GeV. Not allowed.
- t: way too heavy. Not allowed.

So possible fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Now, the possible decay products are f f̄, where f is e, mu, tau, u, d, s, or c.

So the possible decay channels are:

e+ e−,
mu+ mu−,
tau+ tau−,
u ū,
d d̄,
s s̄,
c c̄.

So looking at the options, which option includes all of these?

Option B: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. So yes, all are present.

Option C includes t, which is not allowed, so no.

Option D includes b, which is too heavy, so no.

Option A includes b, which is invalid. So option B is the correct one.

Wait, but looking again at the options:

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+ e−. So all possible decay channels except for any that require higher masses.

So the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction between \( X \) and fermions is described by the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) \left(\upsilon + X(y)\right) \psi_f(y),
\]

where \( \psi_f(y) \) represents fermion fields. The decay of \( X \) into fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f \bar{f} \)) is allowed if the total mass of the decay products is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Fermion Masses
The masses of known fermions are approximately:
- Electron (\( e^- \)): \( 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Muon (\( \mu^- \)): \( 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Tau (\( \tau^- \)): \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 0.006 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Down quark (\( d \)): \( 0.005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_d \approx 0.01 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Strange quark (\( s \)): \( 0.095 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_s \approx 0.19 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Charm quark (\( c \)): \( 1.275 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_c \approx 2.55 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Bottom quark (\( b \)): \( 4.13 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_b \approx 8.26 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).
- Top quark (\( t \)): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).

Thus, the allowed fermion-antifermion pairs are \( e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^-, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c} \).

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which has a total mass of \( 8.26 \, \text{GeV} \), exceeding \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This is not allowed. Hence, Option A is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \). All these pairs have total masses less than or equal to \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which has a total mass of \( 346 \, \text{GeV} \), far exceeding \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This is not allowed. Hence, Option C is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which has a total mass of \( 8.26 \, \text{GeV} \), exceeding \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This is not allowed. Hence, Option D is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The only kinematically allowed decay channels are listed in **Option B**.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particle decays. Hmm, let's try to work through it. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

The question is about the possible decay modes of a boson X. The Lagrangian is given, and some other info is provided. Let me parse what I know.

Wait, but wait. The mass of the boson is 6 GeV. So the decay products' rest mass must be less than 6 GeV. So any fermion pair that X can decay into must have a combined mass less than 6 GeV.

Now, the problem is about which fermion pairs are kinematically allowed. Let's look at the options given.

Options A, B, C, D list various decay channels. Each option includes different fermion-antifermion pairs. I need to figure out which of these pairs have a combined mass below 6 GeV.

First, let's recall the masses of the known fermions.

Let's list the quarks and leptons:

Leptons:
- Electron (e^-): mass ~0.0005 GeV
- Muon (μ^-): ~0.105 GeV
- Tau (τ^-): ~1.78 GeV
- Neutrinos: negligible mass, but in pair production, like νν̄, but since neutrinos are light, their decay products won't affect the mass much. But the problem is about X → f f̄, so for charged leptons.

Quarks:
- Up (u): ~0.003 GeV
- Down (d): ~0.005 GeV
- Strange (s): ~0.095 GeV
- Charm (c): ~1.275 GeV
- Bottom (b): ~4.13 GeV
- Top (t): way too heavy, ~173 GeV. But X is only 6 GeV, so top quark pairs are out.

So when X decays into a fermion-antifermion pair, the sum of their masses must be less than 6 GeV.

Let me go through each of the possible fermion pairs in the options:

Option A: b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+ τ−, e+ e−.

Wait, but the bottom quark is about 4 GeV. So if X is 6 GeV, then the pair b b̄ would have a mass of about 8.26 GeV (each 4.13, so 2*4.13 = 8.26). That's way above 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄ because the sum is higher than X's mass. So option A is out because it includes b and s. Wait, s is strange, which is about 0.095 GeV each. So s s̄ would be 0.19 GeV, which is allowed. But if the option includes b, which is not allowed, then it's incorrect.

Wait, but looking at the options again. Let me check each option.

Looking at the options:

Option A: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, e+e−. So including b and s. But b's mass is about 4 GeV. So each b is 4 GeV, so 2*4=8, which is more than 6 GeV. So X can't decay into b b̄. So any option that includes b as a decay product is incorrect.

So option A is out because it includes b.

Option B: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, μ+ μ−, e+ e−.

The charm quark is about 1.275 GeV each, so 2.55 GeV total. That's less than 6 GeV, so that's allowed. The other pairs in option B: s is 0.095, so 0.19 GeV. u is negligible, same with d. tau is about 1.78 GeV each, so 3.56 GeV. All are below 6.

So option B's decay products are all allowed.

Option C: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, t t̄, τ+τ−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. But wait, top quark is 173 GeV. So t t̄ would be 346 GeV, way above 6 GeV. So option C is invalid because it includes t. So C is out.

Option D: X → b b̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. Again, b is too heavy. So D is out.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. So the only options that have possible decay channels are B and possibly others. But let's recheck.

Wait, the problem states that the interaction is given by the Lagrangian. Let me look at the Lagrangian again.

The Lagrangian is written as L(y) = -λ f ψ_f (v + X) ψ_f. Hmm, maybe I should parse this correctly.

Wait, I think the correct way to interpret the Lagrangian is that it's a Yukawa interaction term. The general form is L = - g ψ ψ X, where ψ is a fermion field, and X is the boson. So the interaction term would be something like L = -λ f ψ_f X ψ_f.

Wait, the given Lagrangian is -λ f ψ_f (v + X) ψ_f. So perhaps it's written as -λ f ψ_f X ψ_f, with v being a constant, possibly the vacuum expectation value (VEV). So in this term, the interaction between X and the fermion ψ_f is present. So the fermions that X can interact with are the ones present in this term.

Wait, so the fermion ψ_f could be any of the possible fermions, but the problem is about which particles X can decay into. So only the fermions that are present in the interaction term can be decay products.

Wait, but in the given Lagrangian, ψ_f is a specific fermion, right? Because the term is written as ψ_f (y) (v + X(y)) ψ_f(y). So perhaps ψ_f is a specific fermion, maybe a charged lepton or a quark.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify what ψ_f is. So perhaps the interaction is with all possible fermions f. Hmm, but the problem doesn't give more info, so maybe we can assume that the interaction is possible for all fermions, but in reality, the decay depends on whether the fermion mass is allowed.

Wait, but the problem states that the interaction is given, and the mass of X is 6 GeV, so the possible decay products are those whose combined mass is less than 6 GeV.

Wait, but maybe the fermions ψ_f are all the possible fermions, but the decay is possible only if the pair's mass is less than X's mass.

So the possible decays would be any fermion-antifermion pair where 2m_f ≤ 6 GeV.

So m_f ≤ 3 GeV.

So let's list the fermion masses again:

Leptons:
- e: 0.0005 GeV → 2m_e ≈ 0.001 GeV. Allowed.
- mu: 0.105 GeV → 0.21 GeV. Allowed.
- tau: 1.78 GeV → 3.56 GeV. Allowed.

Quarks:
- u: 0.003 → 0.006 GeV. Allowed.
- d: 0.005 → 0.01 GeV. Allowed.
- s: 0.095 → 0.19 GeV. Allowed.
- c: 1.275 → 2.55 GeV. Allowed.
- b: 4.13 → 8.26 GeV. Not allowed.
- t: way too heavy. Not allowed.

So possible fermions are e, mu, tau, u, d, s, c.

Now, the possible decay products are f f̄, where f is e, mu, tau, u, d, s, or c.

So the possible decay channels are:

e+ e−,
mu+ mu−,
tau+ tau−,
u ū,
d d̄,
s s̄,
c c̄.

So looking at the options, which option includes all of these?

Option B: c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, tau+ tau−, mu+ mu−, e+ e−. So yes, all are present.

Option C includes t, which is not allowed, so no.

Option D includes b, which is too heavy, so no.

Option A includes b, which is invalid. So option B is the correct one.

Wait, but looking again at the options:

Option B: X → c c̄, s s̄, u ū, d d̄, τ+τ−, μ+μ−, e+ e−. So all possible decay channels except for any that require higher masses.

So the correct answer is option B.


The problem involves determining the kinematically allowed decays of a boson \( X \) with a mass of 6 GeV. The interaction between \( X \) and fermions is described by the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(y) = -\lambda f \bar{\psi}_f(y) \left(\upsilon + X(y)\right) \psi_f(y),
\]

where \( \psi_f(y) \) represents fermion fields. The decay of \( X \) into fermion-antifermion pairs (\( f \bar{f} \)) is allowed if the total mass of the decay products is less than or equal to the mass of \( X \), i.e., \( 2m_f \leq 6 \, \text{GeV} \).

### Analysis of Fermion Masses
The masses of known fermions are approximately:
- Electron (\( e^- \)): \( 0.0005 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_e \approx 0.001 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Muon (\( \mu^- \)): \( 0.105 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\mu \approx 0.21 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Tau (\( \tau^- \)): \( 1.78 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_\tau \approx 3.56 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).
- Up quark (\( u \)): \( 0.003 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_u \approx 0.006 \, \text{GeV} \) (allowed).

- Top quark (\( t \)): \( 173 \, \text{GeV} \), \( 2m_t \approx 346 \, \text{GeV} \) (not allowed).

Thus, the allowed fermion-antifermion pairs are \( e^+e^-, \mu^+\mu^-, \tau^+\tau^-, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, s\bar{s}, c\bar{c} \).

### Evaluation of Options
- **Option A**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which has a total mass of \( 8.26 \, \text{GeV} \), exceeding \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This is not allowed. Hence, Option A is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Includes \( c\bar{c}, s\bar{s}, u\bar{u}, d\bar{d}, \tau^+\tau^-, \mu^+\mu^-, e^+e^- \). All these pairs have total masses less than or equal to \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This is correct.
- **Option C**: Includes \( t\bar{t} \), which has a total mass of \( 346 \, \text{GeV} \), far exceeding \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This is not allowed. Hence, Option C is incorrect.
- **Option D**: Includes \( b\bar{b} \), which has a total mass of \( 8.26 \, \text{GeV} \), exceeding \( 6 \, \text{GeV} \). This is not allowed. Hence, Option D is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The only kinematically allowed decay channels are listed in **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
