Okay, so I've got this question about molecular biology, specifically about a ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll go through it step by step.

Alright, the setup: They've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Bicistronic means it has two ORFs, right? So two genes are being expressed from a single vector. The ligand's ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. The receptor is at the 3', fused to eGFP. Wait, but how are the stop cassettes arranged?

Oh, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember that the CBA promoter is a strong, constitutive promoter. The receptor is after an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, so the receptor can be expressed as a separate mRNA from the same transcript. So the vector is probably set up such that the ligand is first, then IRES, then the receptor.

But wait, there's a stop cassette with loxP between ligand and mCherry. Similarly, the receptor has a stop cassette with lox2272 before eGFP. So without Cre, these stops would prevent expression of the fluorescent proteins. Because Cre would recombine the lox sites, removing the stop so the fluorescent proteins can be expressed.

So in the mice, they have a homozygous construct in a wild-type background. Then they cross them with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is a transcription factor important in neural crest development, so the Cre would be expressed in neural crest cells. The Cre would excise the stop cassettes, allowing expression of mCherry and eGFP in those cells.

But in the experiment, when they look under the confocal, they don't see a green signal. Wait, the eGFP is on the receptor. So why no green?

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are paracrine. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But if both are expressed, the construct should be allowing expression. Not sure how this would prevent eGFP from being expressed.

B) Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If the fusion is in the ER or Golgi, maybe it doesn't get secreted or doesn't reach the cell surface. But why would the construct cause this? Unless the eGFP is causing misfolding. But the question states that the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, and they did a Western blot. So if the proteins are expressed, they would show up on the blot. If it's stuck in Golgi, maybe not properly processed, but the Western would detect the protein, I think.

C) Enhancer missing. The ligand and receptor are under the CBA promoter, which is constitutive. So an enhancer might not be needed. Unless the expression is tissue-specific. Wait, but the vector uses CBA, which is strong, so maybe if the enhancer is missing, but I'm not too sure. Or perhaps the IRES is not working, so the receptor isn't expressed.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. Oh, that's an important point. If the eGFP is inserted without being in frame, the protein won't be translated correctly. So the receptor might have a premature stop codon or produce a nonfunctional fusion protein. But the Western blot uses antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So if the eGFP is not in frame, the receptor's eGFP fusion won't be made. So when they do the Western, they wouldn't see the receptor-eGFP band. But the question says the blot shows signals proportional to actin, which suggests the blot is working—so the ligand and receptor might be expressed, but if eGFP isn't present, maybe the Western didn't pick that up because the antibody was against the overexpressed eGFP. Hmm, but the question says the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, so maybe the Western would detect the receptor-eGFP if it's expressed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not in frame. So when Cre is recombined, the stop is removed, but the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, leading to a truncated, nonfunctional protein. So when they look under the microscope, there's no green because the eGFP isn't properly expressed.

Alternatively, if the IRES is not working, the receptor might not be expressed. Wait, the vector has the ligand under CBA, and the receptor under IRES. SOX10-Cre would activate both the ligand and the receptor, because both are under the same promoter but separated by IRES. Unless the IRES is not working correctly.

Wait, but the IRES is a way to have two separate proteins expressed from the same transcript. So when the loxP and lox2272 stops are removed, both the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

But why no green signal? Let's think about the expression. If the eGFP is not in frame, then the receptor-eGFP would not be a proper fusion. So the eGFP wouldn't fluoresce, because the GFP isn't made correctly. So in the confocal, the cells wouldn't light up green.

Alternatively, maybe the Cre isn't working properly. But the question states that they crossed to SOX10-Cre, which should activate Cre in neural crest derivatives, like astrocytes. So the Cre should have recombined the stop cassettes, allowing expression.

Wait the vector is bicistronic and uses loxP and lox2272. So the ligand is flanked by loxP-stop-loxP, and the receptor is flanked by lox2272-stop-lox2272. So for the ligand, when Cre is present, it will excise the loxP sites, allowing the ligand-mCherry to be expressed. For the receptor, since it's flanked by lox2272, which is a variant of loxP, Cre can also excise that, allowing the receptor-eGFP to be expressed.

Wait, but perhaps the issue is that the ligand and receptor are on the same transcript, and the stop cassettes prevent their expression unless Cre is present. But in the mouse, the Cre is present (from SOX10-Cre), so both should be expressed.

Now, the question is why the eGFP isn't showing up. Possible options are D) receptor and eGFP not in frame, which would mean the eGFP isn't expressed correctly. So when they look under the confocal, no green.

Another possibility: the eGFP is not being expressed because of a frameshift. So the Western blot would not detect the eGFP-receptor fusion, but the blot uses total protein. Wait, but if the receptor is expressed without eGFP, then the blot would show the receptor (as the eGFP is only at the C-terminus). Unless the Western is looking for eGFP specifically.

But the question states that the antibodies are against the overexpressed proteins. So perhaps the eGFP is not expressed, so the eGFP antibody wouldn't detect anything. But the question says the blot has a signal proportional to actin—so the blot is working. But the eGFP might be a fusion, so if the frames are wrong, perhaps the antibody can't detect.

Wait, perhaps the problem is with the expression of the eGFP. If the eGFP is not in frame, the fusion protein would be truncated, so anti-receptor antibodies would detect the receptor part, but anti-GFP wouldn't detect anything.

But the question mentions that they raised antibodies against the overexpressed proteins, which would be the ligand and receptor. So when they look for the receptor, they'd see it, but if the eGFP is not expressed, that wouldn't affect the Western blot using receptor antibodies. But the question says that the Western blot was done to test construct expression. So they probably used the fluorescent proteins as markers, but in the Western, they might have used the mCherry and eGFP as markers.

Wait, no, the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor to eGFP. So the Western probably uses anti-mCherry or anti-eGFP to check expression. If the eGFP isn't expressed, the Western would show the ligand-mCherry but not the receptor-eGFP.

But in this question, after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocytes, the Western blot shows a signal proportional to actin. That suggests that the target proteins are being expressed. So in the mice, the expression should be present as well.

Wait, but in the mouse model, they're using a transgenic construct, so the expression is under the control of the CBA promoter, which is strong. So both ligand and receptor should be expressed, along with their fluorescent tags.

But when they look under the confocal, they don't see the green signal (eGFP). So the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So the eGFP would not be expressed as a fusion protein. Thus, no green fluorescence. The Western blot, if it's using an eGFP antibody, would not detect it. But the question says the blot shows a signal proportional to actin—so perhaps it's not the eGFP that's the issue, but maybe the expression of the proteins in general. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working as expected, so the receptor isn't being expressed. But the IRES is upstream of the receptor. Wait, the vector has the ligand under CBA, then IRES, then receptor. So the IRES should allow the receptor to be expressed as a separate protein from the same transcript. But if the IRES isn't functional, the receptor wouldn't be expressed.

But I'm not sure about this.

Another possibility: the Cre isn't effectively excising the stop cassettes. If the Cre isn't active, then the stops remain, and the fluorescent proteins aren't expressed. But since they used SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells, that shouldn't be the issue.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic vector, and the lox sites are used for Cre-mediated recombination. If the Cre isn't present, the stops remain. But in the mouse model, the Cre is present, so the stops should be excised.

So why isn't eGFP being expressed? If the eGFP is not in frame, then the fusion protein isn't made correctly. So when you look for eGFP fluorescence, nothing shows up.

But the Western blot would show the receptor if it's expressed without the eGFP. Wait, no, the eGFP is at the C-terminus. So if it's not in frame, the receptor might be expressed but without eGFP, so the Western blot would show the receptor but no eGFP.

But the question says that the Western blot shows a signal proportional to actin—so perhaps the actin is a loading control, and the blot detected the target proteins. So maybe the eGFP is not expressed, but the receptor is. But why would the Western detect it?

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not being translated because of the stop cassette not being removed. But the question states that the Western blot was done after transfecting the plasmid into primary astrocytes—so perhaps that's a separate experiment. But the main issue is in the mouse model.

Wait, the mouse is homozygous for the construct. They cross to SOX10-Cre, which is a hemizygous line. So the offspring would have the construct and SOX10-Cre. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so Cre would be active there. So the stops should be excised.

If the eGFP is not in frame, the fusion is not made. So the eGFP wouldn't fluoresce.

But the Western blot in the initial plasmid transfection showed a signal. So perhaps in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed, but the receptor is. So the Western would detect the receptor, but the eGFP wouldn't be there.

Wait, but the question says after plasmid transfection to primary astrocytes, the blot shows signals proportional to actin. So the expression is working. So in the mouse, the same would be true. So why no green?

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me consider each option again.

Option A: Paracrine relationship. That means ligand is secreted and acts on neighboring cells. But the vector is for both ligand and receptor. So in that case, the ligand would be expressed by some cells and the receptor by others. But the construct is in the same vector, so both should be expressed in the same cells where Cre is active. So in the same cell, perhaps. But in that case, the eGFP should be expressed.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in Golgi. If the protein isn't trafficked properly, it might not fluoresce. But the Western blot would still detect the protein. So the blot would show a band. But if the eGFP is stuck, maybe it's not fluorescent, but the blot would detect it. So why wouldn't the blot show it?

Option C: Enhancer missing. The CBA promoter is constitutive, so enhancers might not be needed. Unless the construct requires an enhancer for proper expression. But if the enhancer is missing, both ligand and receptor expression would be low or absent. But the Western blot after transfection showed a signal, which suggests expression is happening. So maybe the enhancer is present or not an issue.

Option D: Receptor and eGFP not in frame. So the eGFP isn't expressed as a fusion. So the eGFP isn't made. Hence, no green signal. The Western blot might detect the receptor (if it's expressed) but not the eGFP.

Wait, but the eGFP is at the C-terminus. If it's not in frame, the receptor might be expressed as a truncated protein without the eGFP. So the Western blot would show the receptor (as the antibody targets the receptor), but eGFP wouldn't be expressed, so the blot wouldn't detect it. But if the question says the blot shows a signal proportional to actin, perhaps the signal is from the ligand and receptor.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the eGFP is not expressed because the stop cassette isn't being removed. No, because the Cre is present and should remove the stops.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the lox sites are in the wrong orientation. For example, if the lox2272 sites aren't correctly placed, the Cre might not excise the stop cassette properly. But that's more about the construct design.

But the question is about the possible options given.

So, looking back, the most likely reason for no green signal is that the eGFP isn't being expressed, which could be due to the fusion being out of frame. So option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector expressing a ligand fused to mCherry and a receptor fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is downstream of an IRES element. Stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 sites flank the mCherry and eGFP, respectively. SOX10-Cre mice are used to excise these stops, enabling expression of the fluorescent proteins in neural crest-derived cells. However, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under the confocal microscope.

### Key Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   A paracrine relationship implies the ligand acts on neighboring cells. However, the construct is designed to co-express both ligand and receptor in the same cells where Cre is active (e.g., neural crest cells). This does not explain the lack of eGFP fluorescence.

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP fusion protein were mis trafficked to the Golgi, it might not fluoresce. However, the Western blot would still detect the protein, as it measures total protein levels regardless of localization. The question does not provide evidence for improper trafficking, making this less likely.

3. **Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The CBA promoter is a strong, constitutive promoter, so an enhancer is not strictly required for expression. The Western blot after transfection showed a signal proportional to actin, indicating that the construct is functional and expression is occurring. This makes this option unlikely.

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   If the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, the fusion protein would not be expressed correctly. This would result in a truncated or nonfunctional receptor-eGFP fusion, leading to no green fluorescence under the confocal microscope. The Western blot might detect the receptor protein, but the eGFP would not fluoresce, consistent with the observed results.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, preventing proper expression of the eGFP fusion protein and resulting in no green signal under the confocal microscope.
