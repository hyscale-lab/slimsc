Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a pion decay. Hmm, I remember from my studies that pions can decay into other particles, and I think this involves some conservation laws, like conservation of energy and momentum. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The reaction given is Pi(+) → mu(+) + nu. The pion is at rest, so its initial momentum is zero. The rest masses are given: the pion is 139.6 MeV/c², and the muon is 105.7 MeV/c². Wait, and what about the neutrino? I think neutrinos are nearly massless, so maybe we can approximate their mass as zero. Or maybe the problem neglects it. I'll keep that in mind.

So, since the pion is stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. Therefore, the total momentum of the products must also be zero. That means the momenta of the muon and the neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So, p_mu = -p_nu. But wait, if the neutrino's mass is negligible, its energy would be just pc. Hmm, but the muon has a significant mass, so its energy will be more than just its momentum.

Conservation of energy says that the total energy before should equal the total after. The initial energy is just the rest mass of the pion, because it's at rest. So E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. E_total = E_mu + E_nu.

But since the neutrino is massless, E_nu = |p_nu| c. And because p_mu = -p_nu, the magnitudes are the same. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Wait, but the muon's energy is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c² ? Hmm, wait no, units might not be right. Let me think in terms of units where c=1 for simplicity. So E = sqrt( p^2 + m^2 ). So for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu² ), and for the neutrino, E_nu = p, since m_nu is zero.

So the total energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu²) + p = m_pi.

So the equation to solve is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu²) + p = m_pi.

Let me plug in the numbers. m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

So sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, let me call p as x for simplicity. So equation becomes sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6.

I can rearrange this: sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x.

Then square both sides: x² + 105.7² = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

So left side is x² + (105.7)^2, which equals right side x² + (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x.

Subtract x² from both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 x.

Let me compute 139.6² and 105.7².

139.6^2: Well, 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

105.7^2: Let's compute 100^2=10000, plus (5.7)^2=32.49, plus 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000+1140+32.49=11172.49 MeV².

So putting numbers in: 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x.

Subtract 19488.16 from both sides: 11172.49 -19488.16 = -2*139.6 x.

Which is -8315.67 = -279.2 x.

Divide both sides by -279.2: x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let's see, 279.2 * 30 is 8376. Oh, wait, 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 279.2 * 29.76 ≈ 8315.67? Let me compute 279.2 * 29.76.

Wait, maybe I can compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me do 279.2 * 30 = 8376.0, which is 8376-8315.67=60.33 too high. So 30 - (60.33 / 279.2) ≈ 30 - 0.216 ≈ 29.784.

So x ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but x is the magnitude of the muon's momentum. So p_mu = 29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, wait. Because in the equation, x is p_mu, which is equal in magnitude to p_nu, but opposite in direction. So the neutrino's momentum is -29.784 MeV/c, but since I'm taking magnitude, it's 29.784.

Now, the muon's energy is sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), so E_mu = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) MeV.

Let me compute (29.784)^2: 29.784 squared is approximately 886. So 29.784^2 ≈ 886.86. 

105.7^2 is 11172.49 as before.

So adding them: 886.86 + 11172.49 = 12059.35. The square root is sqrt(12059.35) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's energy is about 109.81 MeV? That leaves the neutrino's energy to be (139.6 - 109.81) ≈ 29.79 MeV. But since E_nu = p, which is 29.784 MeV, that makes sense. So E_nu is about 29.784 MeV.

But wait, the problem is asking for the kinetic energy of the product particles. Kinetic energy is (Total energy) - (Rest mass energy). So for the muon, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu c². Wait, but in our units, we've set c=1, so m_mu is 105.7 MeV, so KE_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

And for the neutrino, KE_nu = E_nu - m_nu c². But m_nu is approximately zero, so KE_nu = E_nu = 29.784 MeV.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That seems to match. But let me check my calculations again, perhaps I made a mistake.

Let me recompute the momentum p.

Original equation:

sqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2) + p = 139.6.

Let me solve this equation accurately.

Let me denote m = 105.7, M = 139.6.

So equation: sqrt(p^2 + m²) = M - p.

Square both sides: p² + m² = M² - 2 M p + p².

Subtract p²: m² = M² - 2 M p.

So 2 M p = M² - m².

p = (M² - m²)/(2 M).

Yes, that's a better way to compute it. So let me compute M² = (139.6)^2 = 19488.16, m² = (105.7)^2 = 11172.49.

M² - m² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Then p = (8315.67) / (2 * 139.6) ) = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

So p ≈ 29.784.

Then, E_mu = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt(886.86 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.35) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So KE_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

KE_nu = E_nu = 29.784 MeV.

So the KEs are approximately 4.11 MeV (mu) and 29.78 MeV (nu).

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close.

So the correct answer should be D.

To determine the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay reaction:

\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, we use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\). The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed to be massless (\(m_\nu \approx 0\)).

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon (\(\mu^+\)) and the neutrino (\(\nu\)):
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu.
\]

For the muon, the energy is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2},
\]
where \(p\) is the magnitude of the muon's momentum. For the neutrino, since it is massless:
\[
E_\nu = p.
\]

Thus, the energy conservation equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p = m_{\pi^+}.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum of the products must be zero. This means the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta:
\[
p_{\mu^+} = -p_\nu \quad \Rightarrow \quad |p_{\mu^+}| = |p_\nu| = p.
\]

### Solving for Momentum \(p\)
Substitute \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) and \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) into the energy conservation equation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p = 139.6.
\]

Rearrange:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - p.
\]

Square both sides:
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]

Expand the right-hand side:
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p + p^2.
\]

Cancel \(p^2\) from both sides:
\[
105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p.
\]

Solve for \(p\):
\[
2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 139.6^2 - 105.7^2.
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49, \quad \text{so:}
\]
\[
2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]

\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

### Energy of the Muon
The muon's energy is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{29.784^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]

Compute:
\[
29.784^2 \approx 886.86, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49, \quad \text{so:}
\]
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{886.86 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.35} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Muon
The kinetic energy of the muon is:
\[
KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} c^2 = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Energy of the Neutrino
The neutrino's energy is:
\[
E_\nu = p = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino
Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy:
\[
KE_\nu = E_\nu = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.11 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.78 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**

Conservation of energy says that the total energy before should equal the total after. The initial energy is just the rest mass of the pion, because it's at rest. So E_initial = m_pi c² = 139.6 MeV.

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. E_total = E_mu + E_nu.

But since the neutrino is massless, E_nu = |p_nu| c. And because p_mu = -p_nu, the magnitudes are the same. So |p_mu| = |p_nu|.

Wait, but the muon's energy is sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ) / c² ? Hmm, wait no, units might not be right. Let me think in terms of units where c=1 for simplicity. So E = sqrt( p^2 + m^2 ). So for the muon, E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu² ), and for the neutrino, E_nu = p, since m_nu is zero.

So the total energy is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu²) + p = m_pi.

So the equation to solve is sqrt(p^2 + m_mu²) + p = m_pi.

Let me plug in the numbers. m_pi is 139.6 MeV, m_mu is 105.7 MeV.

So sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Hmm, let me call p as x for simplicity. So equation becomes sqrt(x² + (105.7)^2) + x = 139.6.

I can rearrange this: sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x.

Then square both sides: x² + 105.7² = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side: (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

So left side is x² + (105.7)^2, which equals right side x² + (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x.

Subtract x² from both sides:

105.7² = 139.6² - 2*139.6 x.

Let me compute 139.6² and 105.7².

139.6^2: Well, 140^2 is 19600, so 139.6 is 0.4 less. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

105.7^2: Let's compute 100^2=10000, plus (5.7)^2=32.49, plus 2*100*5.7=1140. So 10000+1140+32.49=11172.49 MeV².

So putting numbers in: 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2*139.6 x.

Subtract 19488.16 from both sides: 11172.49 -19488.16 = -2*139.6 x.

Which is -8315.67 = -279.2 x.

Divide both sides by -279.2: x = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ Let's see, 279.2 * 30 is 8376. Oh, wait, 279.2 * 30 is 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67. So 279.2 * 29.76 ≈ 8315.67? Let me compute 279.2 * 29.76.

Wait, maybe I can compute 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me do 279.2 * 30 = 8376.0, which is 8376-8315.67=60.33 too high. So 30 - (60.33 / 279.2) ≈ 30 - 0.216 ≈ 29.784.

So x ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but x is the magnitude of the muon's momentum. So p_mu = 29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but wait, wait. Because in the equation, x is p_mu, which is equal in magnitude to p_nu, but opposite in direction. So the neutrino's momentum is -29.784 MeV/c, but since I'm taking magnitude, it's 29.784.

Now, the muon's energy is sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ), so E_mu = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) MeV.

Let me compute (29.784)^2: 29.784 squared is approximately 886. So 29.784^2 ≈ 886.86. 

105.7^2 is 11172.49 as before.

So adding them: 886.86 + 11172.49 = 12059.35. The square root is sqrt(12059.35) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, but wait, no, wait. Wait, the pion's rest mass is 139.6 MeV, and the muon's energy is about 109.81 MeV? That leaves the neutrino's energy to be (139.6 - 109.81) ≈ 29.79 MeV. But since E_nu = p, which is 29.784 MeV, that makes sense. So E_nu is about 29.784 MeV.

And for the neutrino, KE_nu = E_nu - m_nu c². But m_nu is approximately zero, so KE_nu = E_nu = 29.784 MeV.

Let me recompute the momentum p.

Original equation:

sqrt(p^2 + 105.7^2) + p = 139.6.

Let me solve this equation accurately.

Let me denote m = 105.7, M = 139.6.

So equation: sqrt(p^2 + m²) = M - p.

Square both sides: p² + m² = M² - 2 M p + p².

Subtract p²: m² = M² - 2 M p.

So 2 M p = M² - m².

p = (M² - m²)/(2 M).

Yes, that's a better way to compute it. So let me compute M² = (139.6)^2 = 19488.16, m² = (105.7)^2 = 11172.49.

M² - m² = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.

Then p = (8315.67) / (2 * 139.6) ) = 8315.67 / 279.2 ≈ 29.784 MeV/c.

So p ≈ 29.784.

Then, E_mu = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 ) = sqrt(886.86 + 11172.49) = sqrt(12059.35) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

So KE_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

KE_nu = E_nu = 29.784 MeV.

So the KEs are approximately 4.11 MeV (mu) and 29.78 MeV (nu).

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That's very close.

So the correct answer should be D.


To determine the kinetic energy of the product particles in the decay reaction:

\[
\pi^+ \to \mu^+ + \nu
\]

where the pion (\(\pi^+\)) is stationary, we use the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. The rest masses are given as \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) and \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\). The neutrino (\(\nu\)) is assumed to be massless (\(m_\nu \approx 0\)).

### Conservation of Energy
The total energy before decay is the rest energy of the pion:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = m_{\pi^+} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

After decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon (\(\mu^+\)) and the neutrino (\(\nu\)):
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_{\mu^+} + E_\nu.
\]

For the muon, the energy is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2},
\]
where \(p\) is the magnitude of the muon's momentum. For the neutrino, since it is massless:
\[
E_\nu = p.
\]

Thus, the energy conservation equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p = m_{\pi^+}.
\]

### Conservation of Momentum
Since the pion is stationary, the total momentum of the products must be zero. This means the muon and neutrino have equal and opposite momenta:
\[
p_{\mu^+} = -p_\nu \quad \Rightarrow \quad |p_{\mu^+}| = |p_\nu| = p.
\]

### Solving for Momentum \(p\)
Substitute \(m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) and \(m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}/c^2\) into the energy conservation equation:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p = 139.6.
\]

Rearrange:
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - p.
\]

Square both sides:
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]

Expand the right-hand side:
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p + p^2.
\]

Cancel \(p^2\) from both sides:
\[
105.7^2 = 139.6^2 - 2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p.
\]

Solve for \(p\):
\[
2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 139.6^2 - 105.7^2.
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
139.6^2 = 19488.16, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49, \quad \text{so:}
\]
\[
2 \cdot 139.6 \cdot p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]

\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{2 \cdot 139.6} = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV}/c.
\]

### Energy of the Muon
The muon's energy is:
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{29.784^2 + 105.7^2}.
\]

Compute:
\[
29.784^2 \approx 886.86, \quad 105.7^2 = 11172.49, \quad \text{so:}
\]
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{886.86 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.35} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Muon
The kinetic energy of the muon is:
\[
KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} c^2 = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Energy of the Neutrino
The neutrino's energy is:
\[
E_\nu = p = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Kinetic Energy of the Neutrino
Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its total energy:
\[
KE_\nu = E_\nu = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
\]

### Final Answer
The kinetic energies of the muon and neutrino are approximately \(4.11 \, \text{MeV}\) and \(29.78 \, \text{MeV}\), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:

**Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**

Answer: D
