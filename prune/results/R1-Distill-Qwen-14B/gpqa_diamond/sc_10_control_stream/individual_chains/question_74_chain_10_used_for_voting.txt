Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay is a random process, but the probability follows some kind of exponential law. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that an atom has a decay probability of 32% within 100 minutes. So, after 100 minutes, there's a 32% chance it has decayed. Wait, that implies that the probability of it not decaying in 100 minutes is 68%, right? Because 100% minus 32% is 68%. 

But wait, no, actually the decay probability being 32% in a certain time usually refers to the probability that it decays within that time, not the exact probability at a specific moment. So, starting from time zero, the probability of decaying by time T is given as 32% when T is 100 minutes.

The problem says that 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed. Now, we're to find the probability it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, is that 150 minutes from now, making the total 50 + 150 = 200 minutes, or just in the next 150 regardless of the time passed? Oh, the way it's phrased, "the next 150 minutes," so from now on, 150 more minutes. So, the total time from the start would be 200 minutes. But we need the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed by 50.

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the decay probability formula. The decay follows an exponential distribution, right? So the probability that the atom has not decayed by time t is given by e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant.

The decay probability P(t) is 1 minus the survival probability. So P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).

In the question, P(100) = 32% or 0.32. So,

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)
=> e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
Take natural log on both sides:
-100λ = ln(0.68)
=> λ = - ln(0.68) / 100

Let me compute that. ln(0.68) is approximately, well, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, and ln(0.68) would be a bit lower. Let's approximate ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3857.

So λ ≈ 0.3857 / 100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

Wait, but let me get a more accurate value. Let me calculate ln(0.68) precisely. Using a calculator approach:

0.68 is e^x = 0.68. Let me compute x.

Using the Taylor series for ln(x) around 1: ln(1 - y) ≈ -y - y^2/2 - y^3/3 ... but maybe another approach. Alternatively, I remember that ln(0.5) is about -0.693, ln(2/3) is around -0.405, so 0.68 is between 0.7 and 0.6, so perhaps around -0.385. Alternatively, using calculator-like steps:

But perhaps I can just proceed symbolically.

Given that, we can find the probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50. So, it's about the conditional probability.

The probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200 (so 150 minutes later) is the integral from 50 to 200 of λ e^(-λ t) dt.

Alternatively, since the process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute interval, regardless of how much time has already passed. Wait, but that's only if the time already passed is part of the condition. Hmm.

Wait, no. The probability of decaying in the next T minutes, given that it hasn't decayed for t minutes, is P(T) = 1 - e^(-λ T).

Wait, let me think. The probability that it decays in the next T minutes is the same as the probability that it hasn't decayed after t minutes, and then decays in the next T. But because the decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next T minutes is the same as if it was starting fresh. So, the probability is 1 - e^(-λ T), regardless of t.

Wait, but wait, no. Because after t minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. So the survival probability after t minutes is e^(-λ t). So the conditional probability of decaying in the next T minutes is [1 - e^(-λ (T + t)) ] / [e^(-λ t)].

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

The probability that the atom decays between t and t + T is the same as the probability that it decays after t minutes and before t + T.

The survival probability up to time t is S(t) = e^(-λ t).

The survival probability up to time t+T is S(t+T) = e^(-λ (t + T)).

The probability of decaying between t and t+T is S(t) - S(t+T) = e^(-λ t) - e^(-λ (t+T)) ) = e^(-λ t) (1 - e^(-λ T)).

But wait, given that the atom hasn't decayed by time t, that is, given that it's still around at time t, the conditional probability is [e^(-λ t) (1 - e^(-λ T)) ] / e^(-λ t) ) = 1 - e^(-λ T).

So the conditional probability is indeed 1 - e^(-λ T).

Wait, that's interesting. So the probability of decaying in the next T minutes after time t is 1 - e^(-λ T), regardless of how much time has already passed (t). Because the exponential distribution is memoryless.

So in this problem, T is 150 minutes. So the probability is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

We have λ from earlier, which is ln(0.68)/100, but wait, no, earlier I wrote λ = - ln(0.68)/100. Let me recast that.

Wait, earlier equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). So e^(-100λ) = 0.68 → -100λ = ln(0.68) → λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

So λ = (− ln(0.68)) / 100.

Wait, better to compute λ as (ln(1/0.68))/100, which is the same as ln( (1/0.68) ) / 100.

Let me compute ln(1/0.68): 1/0.68 ≈ 1.470588. ln(1.470588) is approximately 0.3857.

So λ ≈ 0.3857 / 100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

So now, substituting into the next part: the probability is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Compute e^(-150 * 0.003857) = e^(-0.57855).

Hmm, what's e^(-0.57855)? Approximately, e^(-0.57) is about 0.563, but let me get more precise.

Wait, e^(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065, e^(-0.6) ≈ 0.5488. 0.57855 is between 0.5 and 0.6, closer to 0.58. Let's see, perhaps using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, using e^x ≈ 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 for small x. But 0.578 isn't that small. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate e^0.57855 as e^(0.57855) ≈ 1.783. So e^-0.57855 ≈ 1/1.783 ≈ 0.559.

Wait, but let me calculate more accurately. Let me compute 0.57855.

Wait, 0.57855 is approximately 0.57855.

We can use a Taylor expansion around 0.5 or another point. Alternatively, knowing that:

e^0.5 = 1.64872, e^0.57 = approx 1.768? e^0.57855 ≈ ?

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a calculator approximation. Let me think: 0.57855 is about 0.58.

But without exact calculation, perhaps I can say that e^(-0.57855) ≈ 0.56. Let me think: 0.57855 is approximately 0.58, so e^(-0.58) ≈ 0.56. So 1 - 0.56 = 0.44. So the probability is about 44%, which would correspond to option A.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use exact calculation.

Let me compute λ = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100.

ln(1/0.68) = ln(1.470588) ≈ 0.385662.

So λ ≈ 0.385662 / 100 ≈ 0.00385662 per minute.

Then, λ * 150 = 0.00385662 * 150 ≈ 0.578493.

So e^(-0.578493) ≈ ?

Let me compute e^(-0.578493):

I know that e^(-0.578493) = 1 / e^(0.578493).

Compute e^0.578493:

We can use the Taylor series to approximate e^x around x=0.5.

But alternatively, perhaps use known values.

e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872.

e^0.6 ≈ 1.82211880039.

0.578493 is 0.5 + 0.078493.

Using the expansion around x=0.5:

e^0.578493 = e^{0.5 + 0.078493} = e^0.5 * e^{0.078493}.

e^0.5 is about 1.64872.

e^0.078493 ≈ 1 + 0.078493 + (0.078493)^2/2 + (0.078493)^3/6.

Compute each term:

0.078493^2 = approx 0.0061614

0.0061614 / 2 = 0.0030807

0.078493^3 ≈ 0.078493 * 0.0061614 ≈ 0.0004836.

0.0004836 / 6 ≈ 0.0000806.

So e^0.078493 ≈ 1 + 0.078493 + 0.0030807 + 0.0000806 ≈ 1.0816543.

So e^0.578493 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.0816543.

Multiply 1.64872 * 1.0816543.

1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872

1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976

1.64872 * 0.0016543 ≈ approx 0.0027254.

Adding them all: 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176 + 0.0027254 ≈ 1.783343.

So e^0.578493 ≈ 1.783343.

Thus, e^(-0.578493) ≈ 1/1.783343 ≈ 0.559.

So 1 - 0.559 ≈ 0.441, or 44.1%.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%, which would be the closest.

Wait, but in the question, the time given is 150 minutes. So the probability is 44%, so the answer is A.

Another way to think: since the decay is memoryless, the probability doesn't depend on the time already elapsed. So, to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes, it's the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute period. So why not compute it directly?

But wait, let me double-check. The initial information was that in 100 minutes, the probability is 32%. So we have λ = (ln(1/(1 - 0.32)))/100.

Wait, 1 - 0.32 is 0.68, so ln(1/0.68)= ln(1.470588)≈ 0.38566.

So λ = 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.

Thus, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ*150) = 1 - e^(-0.0038566 * 150) = 1 - e^(-0.57849).

As before, e^(-0.57849) ≈ 0.559, so the probability is 44.1%.

So the correct answer is A) 44%.

To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential distribution. The probability of an atom decaying within a given time \( t \) is expressed as:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, i.e., \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using this, we can calculate \( \lambda \):

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.3857 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.3857}{100} \approx 0.003857 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes. Since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is independent of the time already elapsed (50 minutes). The probability is given by:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.003857 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 \approx 0.003857 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57855
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.57855}
\]

To approximate \( e^{-0.57855} \), we use known values and approximations. For \( e^{-0.57855} \), we find:

\[
e^{-0.57855} \approx 0.559
\]

Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.559 \approx 0.441 \, \text{or} \, 44.1\%.
\]

From the given options, the closest value is **44%**, corresponding to option A.

**Answer: A**

Wait, is that 150 minutes from now, making the total 50 + 150 = 200 minutes, or just in the next 150 regardless of the time passed? Oh, the way it's phrased, "the next 150 minutes," so from now on, 150 more minutes. So, the total time from the start would be 200 minutes.

The decay probability P(t) is 1 minus the survival probability. So P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt).

In the question, P(100) = 32% or 0.32. So,

0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100)
=> e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
Take natural log on both sides:
-100λ = ln(0.68)
=> λ = - ln(0.68) / 100

Let me compute that. ln(0.68) is approximately, well, ln(0.7) is about -0.3567, and ln(0.68) would be a bit lower. Let's approximate ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3857.

Wait, but wait, no. Because after t minutes, the atom hasn't decayed. So the survival probability after t minutes is e^(-λ t). So the conditional probability of decaying in the next T minutes is [1 - e^(-λ (T + t)) ] / [e^(-λ t)].

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

The probability that the atom decays between t and t + T is the same as the probability that it decays after t minutes and before t + T.

The survival probability up to time t is S(t) = e^(-λ t).

The survival probability up to time t+T is S(t+T) = e^(-λ (t + T)).

The probability of decaying between t and t+T is S(t) - S(t+T) = e^(-λ t) - e^(-λ (t+T)) ) = e^(-λ t) (1 - e^(-λ T)).

But wait, given that the atom hasn't decayed by time t, that is, given that it's still around at time t, the conditional probability is [e^(-λ t) (1 - e^(-λ T)) ] / e^(-λ t) ) = 1 - e^(-λ T).

So the conditional probability is indeed 1 - e^(-λ T).

Wait, that's interesting. So the probability of decaying in the next T minutes after time t is 1 - e^(-λ T), regardless of how much time has already passed (t). Because the exponential distribution is memoryless.

So in this problem, T is 150 minutes. So the probability is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

We have λ from earlier, which is ln(0.68)/100, but wait, no, earlier I wrote λ = - ln(0.68)/100. Let me recast that.

Wait, earlier equation: 0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ). So e^(-100λ) = 0.68 → -100λ = ln(0.68) → λ = - ln(0.68)/100.

So λ = (− ln(0.68)) / 100.

Wait, better to compute λ as (ln(1/0.68))/100, which is the same as ln( (1/0.68) ) / 100.

Let me compute ln(1/0.68): 1/0.68 ≈ 1.470588. ln(1.470588) is approximately 0.3857.

So λ ≈ 0.3857 / 100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

So now, substituting into the next part: the probability is 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Compute e^(-150 * 0.003857) = e^(-0.57855).

Hmm, what's e^(-0.57855)? Approximately, e^(-0.57) is about 0.563, but let me get more precise.

Wait, e^(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065, e^(-0.6) ≈ 0.5488. 0.57855 is between 0.5 and 0.6, closer to 0.58. Let's see, perhaps using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, using e^x ≈ 1 + x + x^2/2 + x^3/6 for small x. But 0.578 isn't that small. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate e^0.57855 as e^(0.57855) ≈ 1.783. So e^-0.57855 ≈ 1/1.783 ≈ 0.559.

Wait, but let me calculate more accurately. Let me compute 0.57855.

Wait, 0.57855 is approximately 0.57855.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use a calculator approximation. Let me think: 0.57855 is about 0.58.

But without exact calculation, perhaps I can say that e^(-0.57855) ≈ 0.56. Let me think: 0.57855 is approximately 0.58, so e^(-0.58) ≈ 0.56. So 1 - 0.56 = 0.44. So the probability is about 44%, which would correspond to option A.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use exact calculation.

Let me compute λ = (ln(1/0.68)) / 100.

ln(1/0.68) = ln(1.470588) ≈ 0.385662.

So λ ≈ 0.385662 / 100 ≈ 0.00385662 per minute.

Then, λ * 150 = 0.00385662 * 150 ≈ 0.578493.

So e^(-0.578493) ≈ ?

Let me compute e^(-0.578493):

I know that e^(-0.578493) = 1 / e^(0.578493).

Compute e^0.578493:

We can use the Taylor series to approximate e^x around x=0.5.

But alternatively, perhaps use known values.

e^0.5 ≈ 1.64872.

e^0.6 ≈ 1.82211880039.

0.578493 is 0.5 + 0.078493.

Using the expansion around x=0.5:

e^0.578493 = e^{0.5 + 0.078493} = e^0.5 * e^{0.078493}.

e^0.5 is about 1.64872.

e^0.078493 ≈ 1 + 0.078493 + (0.078493)^2/2 + (0.078493)^3/6.

Compute each term:

0.078493^2 = approx 0.0061614

0.0061614 / 2 = 0.0030807

0.078493^3 ≈ 0.078493 * 0.0061614 ≈ 0.0004836.

0.0004836 / 6 ≈ 0.0000806.

So e^0.078493 ≈ 1 + 0.078493 + 0.0030807 + 0.0000806 ≈ 1.0816543.

So e^0.578493 ≈ 1.64872 * 1.0816543.

Multiply 1.64872 * 1.0816543.

1.64872 * 1 = 1.64872

1.64872 * 0.08 = 0.1318976

1.64872 * 0.0016543 ≈ approx 0.0027254.

Adding them all: 1.64872 + 0.1318976 = 1.7806176 + 0.0027254 ≈ 1.783343.

So e^0.578493 ≈ 1.783343.

Thus, e^(-0.578493) ≈ 1/1.783343 ≈ 0.559.

So 1 - 0.559 ≈ 0.441, or 44.1%.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%, which would be the closest.

Wait, but in the question, the time given is 150 minutes. So the probability is 44%, so the answer is A.

Another way to think: since the decay is memoryless, the probability doesn't depend on the time already elapsed. So, to find the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes after 50 minutes, it's the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute period. So why not compute it directly?

But wait, let me double-check. The initial information was that in 100 minutes, the probability is 32%. So we have λ = (ln(1/(1 - 0.32)))/100.

Wait, 1 - 0.32 is 0.68, so ln(1/0.68)= ln(1.470588)≈ 0.38566.

So λ = 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.

Thus, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is 1 - e^(-λ*150) = 1 - e^(-0.0038566 * 150) = 1 - e^(-0.57849).

As before, e^(-0.57849) ≈ 0.559, so the probability is 44.1%.

So the correct answer is A) 44%.


To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential distribution. The probability of an atom decaying within a given time \( t \) is expressed as:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. The problem states that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, i.e., \( P(100) = 0.32 \). Using this, we can calculate \( \lambda \):

\[
0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging:

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100}
\]

Using \( \ln(0.68) \approx -0.3857 \), we find:

\[
\lambda \approx \frac{0.3857}{100} \approx 0.003857 \, \text{per minute}.
\]

Next, we calculate the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes. Since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is independent of the time already elapsed (50 minutes). The probability is given by:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.003857 \) and \( t = 150 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 \approx 0.003857 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57855
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-0.57855}
\]

To approximate \( e^{-0.57855} \), we use known values and approximations. For \( e^{-0.57855} \), we find:

\[
e^{-0.57855} \approx 0.559
\]

Thus:

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.559 \approx 0.441 \, \text{or} \, 44.1\%.
\]

From the given options, the closest value is **44%**, corresponding to option A.
