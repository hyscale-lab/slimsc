Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the GADD45G protein isn't being overexpressed in the transgenic mouse model. Let's break this down step by step.

The setup is that I created a transgenic mouse model where I want to overexpress the GADD45G protein. To do this, I modified the gene's coding sequence by adding the sequence for a single influenza hemagglutinin antigenic determinant at the N-terminus. Then, I transfected the plasmid into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine. After that, I selected antibiotic-resistant colonies and tested the expression, but it didn't work as expected.

So, the problem is that the protein isn't being overexpressed. Let's look at the construct's plus strand sequence provided. I need to analyze this DNA sequence to see if there's an issue in the coding region that would prevent proper translation.

First, I'll scan through the sequence to see if there are any obvious issues. Looking for start codons and stop codons. The sequence starts with ATG, which is the standard start codon (methionine), so that's correct.

Wait, I should check for any premature stop codons. The presence of a stop codon (TAA, TAG, or TGA) in the middle would terminate translation early, leading to a truncated protein or no protein at all.

Let me go through the sequence. Hmm, I'll look for any occurrence of TAA, TAG, or TGA.

Looking at the sequence:

5'ATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

I'll scan each codon. Let me look for the stop codons.

Wait, I can look for any occurrence of TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Looking for TGA: Let's see, in the sequence, is there a TGA anywhere?

Looking through: Let me check the end. The last part is ...AGTGA3'. So the last few bases are ...GTTGA3'. Wait, that's not a stop codon. Let me see the exact end: ...CGAGTGA3'. So the ending is CGA GTG A. Wait, that's CGA (Arg), GTG (Val), G A. Hmm, maybe I'm looking at it wrong.

Wait, the entire sequence is the plus strand, so the 5' to 3' direction. Let me break it into triplets to see the codons:

Looking for the end: ...GGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, the last part is ...GCGGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, the very end is ...GAGTGA. So the last codon is GAG (glutamic acid) followed by TGA, which is a stop codon. Oh wait, no, the triplet is the last three: ...GAGTGA. So the actual stop codon is TGA.

Wait, no. Let me think: the DNA is read as a coding sequence, so each codon is determined by three bases. The end is ...GAGTGA3'. So the last codon is TGA, which is a stop codon. So the sequence includes a TGA in the middle, before the actual end?

Wait, let me see. Let me parse the entire sequence into triplets, starting from the beginning.

The sequence starts with ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA ... Hmm, wait, no. Let me do this properly.

Breaking it into triplets:

ATG TAC CCA TAC GAT GTT CCA GAT TAC GCC AAA TGA CAG GAC TCT GGA AGA AGT CCG CGG CCA GGAC ACA GTT CCG GAA AGC AAG CCA GGA TGC AGG GTG CCG GAA AGC GCT GCA TGA GTT GCT GCT GTC GGC GCC AGC GTC AGG GCT GGC TCA CTG CCG GCG TCT ACG AGT CAG CCA AAG TCT TGA ACG GTG ACC CCC GAC AAT GTG ACC TTCTGT GTG CTG GCT GCG GGT GAG GAG GAC GAG GGC GAC ATC GCG CTG CAG ATC CAT TTT TAC GCT GAT CCA GGC TTT CTG CTG C GAG AAC GAC ATC GAC ATA GTG CGC GTG GGC GAT GTG CAG CGG CTG GCG GCT ATC GTG GGC GCC GGC GAG GAG GCG GGT GCG CC GGC GAC CTG CAC TGC ATC CTC ATT TCG AAC CCC CAC GAG TGA.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's look for the TGA in the middle. So anywhere in the sequence, is there a TGA?

Looking through:

I see a part that's ...TACGCCAAATGACTCTGGAAGAAGTCCGCGGCCAGGACACAGTTCCGGAAAGCACAGCCAGGATGCAGGGTGCCGGGAAAGCGCTGCATGAGTTGCTGCTGTCGGCGCAGCGTCAGGGCTGCCTCACTGCCGGCGTCTACGAGTCAGCCAAAGTCTTGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA3'

Wait, looking for TGA. Let me scan the sequence for that exact triplet.

Hmm, I see 'TGA' appearing in 'TGAACGTGGAC'. Wait, no, that's TGA as part of a longer stretch. Let me look for the exact triplet.

Wait, in the sequence, there's a part that says 'TGAACGTGGACCCCGACAATGTGACCTTCTGTGTGCTGGCTGCGGGTGAGGAGGACGAGGGCGACATCGCGCTGCAGATCCATTTTACGCTGATCCAGGCTTTCTGCTGCGAGAACGACATCGACATAGTGCGCGTGGGCGATGTGCAGCGGCTGGCGGCTATCGTGGGCGCCGGCGAGGAGGCGGGTGCGCCGGGCGACCTGCACTGCATCCTCATTTCGAACCCCAACGAGGACGCCTGGAAGGATCCCGCCTTGGAGAAGCTCAGCCTGTTTTGCGAGGAGAGCCGCAGCGTTAACGACTGGGTGCCCAGCATCACCCTCCCCGAGTGA'.

Wait, so the part before 'TGAACG' is 'TGA' as in the triplet T-G-A. So that's a TGA codon. That's a stop codon. So in the middle of the coding sequence, there's a TGA, which would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early.

So that would explain why the protein isn't being expressed. The presence of a TGA in the middle would result in the mRNA being translated only up to that point, producing a truncated protein, or perhaps not producing any because the ribosome stops and the mRNA isn't fully translated.

Wait, but the plasmid was designed to have the HA tag at the N-terminus. So, the original construct is intended to have the HA sequence followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. If the TGA is present in the middle, that would cause the premature stop, leading to a much smaller protein than expected, or no protein if the frame is messed up.

So why is the TGA present? Maybe during cloning, a mutation occurred. The question says the user introduced the HA tag at the N-terminus. So perhaps the HA tag is correctly added, but then there's an error in the rest of the sequence.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the ribosome terminated the translation early. That would happen if there's a stop codon in the mRNA. So if the construct has a TGA in the coding sequence, the mRNA would have a stop codon, leading to early termination.

So the problem is that the construct has a stop codon (TGA) in the middle, causing the ribosome to stop early. That would prevent the full-length protein from being expressed.

So looking at the options, option B is the correct answer.

Wait, but why is there a TGA in the middle? Maybe the cloning process introduced an error. The user intended to clone the HA tag followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. But if the HA tag was added correctly, why is there a TGA?

Alternatively, perhaps the cloning process inserted an extra TGA. Let me think: the HA tag is probably a short peptide, perhaps just a few amino acids. The sequence for HA is from the influenza virus. So, in the construct, the HA sequence is at the beginning, followed by the GADD45G coding sequence. So the presence of a TGA in the middle suggests that either the GADD45G sequence is mutated, including an early stop, or that the HA tag was incorrectly cloned, leading to a frameshift or an inserted stop codon.

But according to the given sequence, the TGA is in the middle of what is presumably the coding sequence for GADD45G. So the construct includes a TGA stop codon, which would cause the problem.

So the problem is that the construct includes a premature TGA, making the mRNA terminate early. Hence, the protein isn't overexpressed because it's not being fully translated.

So the correct answer is option B: The ribosome terminated the translation early.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine why the GADD45G protein is not being overexpressed, the provided DNA sequence of the plus strand was analyzed for potential issues. The sequence starts with the correct start codon (ATG) but contains a premature stop codon, TGA, in the middle of the coding region. This stop codon would cause the ribosome to terminate translation early, resulting in a truncated or non-functional protein. 

The presence of the TGA codon suggests that the construct may have been altered during cloning, potentially introducing an unintended stop codon. This issue aligns with the observation that the protein is not being expressed as expected. Among the options provided, the most plausible explanation is that the ribosome terminated translation prematurely due to the presence of the TGA codon.

**Option Analysis:**
- **A) The sequence for the antigenic determinant has a missense mutation:** This is unlikely because the issue lies in the presence of a premature stop codon, not in the antigenic determinant itself.
- **B) The ribosome terminated the translation early:** This is correct, as the TGA codon in the middle of the sequence would cause premature termination of translation.
- **C) The lack of the linker sequence is triggering proteolysis of the nascent chain:** There is no evidence in the sequence to suggest proteolysis is occurring.
- **D) The tRNA for the UAA codon does not exist in the mouse:** This is irrelevant because the issue is a premature TGA codon, not a UAA codon.

The correct answer is **B**, as the premature stop codon (TGA) is the primary cause of the failed overexpression of the GADD45G protein.
