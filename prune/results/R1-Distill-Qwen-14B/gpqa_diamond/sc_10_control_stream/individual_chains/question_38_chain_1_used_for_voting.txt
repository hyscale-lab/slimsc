Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about enamine reactions. Hmm, I remember that enamines are usually formed from a ketone or aldehyde and a secondary amine. The process involves deprotonation, alkylation, and then hydrolysis. But wait, the question is about the product B and the reagents A used to get there.

The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. Let me try to visualize that. So, the structure has a positive charge because it's an ethanaminium. The substituents are N-methyl and pentan-2-ylidene. The pentan-2-ylidene group is like a CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond starting at position 2, maybe? Or wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- but with a double bond between C2 and C1? Hmm, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2- but attached to the nitrogen.

Wait, no, wait. Pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-. So the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the pentyl chain. So the structure is something like N-methyl attached to a CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 group but with a double bond starting at the second position. Wait, maybe the structure is more like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N-(CH3)+ ?

Wait, the starting material is an enamine. Enamines are typically formed from amines and carbonyl compounds. The process usually starts with deprotonation of the amine, then alkylation, then another step. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is already an enamine, so I'm not sure what reaction is happening here.

The question is about what happens when this starting material reacts with reagent A to form product B. The options are about the sequence of reagents and what B is.

Looking at the options, the choices involve sequences with LDA, DME, and then maybe an iodide like CH3CH2I, followed by H3O+.

Wait, I think the starting material is an iminium ion. Because it's an ethanaminium. Iminium ions are positively charged, formed by the reaction of an amine with a carbonyl compound under certain conditions, often involving deprotonation.

So, let me think about the steps. If I have an iminium ion (like from a ketone and an amine), what do I do next? Typically, you deprotonate it with a strong base, which would be a base like LDA. Then, you might perform an alkylation. Maybe adding an alkyl halide like CH3CH2I. Then, perhaps quenching the reaction with acid (like H3O+) to hydrolyze it back.

Wait, but what's the product in this case? Let's see. The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the structure is something like:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N+=CH2 with a methyl group attached to the N. Wait, no, wait: N-methyl and pentan-2-ylidene. So, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between the first and second C? No, wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with the double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me just think of the starting material as an iminium ion.

So, the starting material is an enamine, which is a conjugated system of a C=N. The reaction would involve deprotonation to form a more stabilized structure. Wait, but if the starting material is already an enamine, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis to regenerate the carbonyl compound and the amine.

Wait, but looking at the options, some of the products are ketones. For example, option C says B is heptan-4-one. Hmm, heptan-4-one is (CH2)3CO(CH2)2CH3.

Wait, let me think about the process. When you have an enamine, adding an acid would hydrolyze it back to the carbonyl and the amine. So, if you have an enamine, and you treat it with acid, you get the ketone or aldehyde and the amine.

Wait, but the starting material is an enamine (imium ion). So, perhaps the reaction involves opening it. Maybe the reagents A are a base, a solvent, and then something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an iminium ion, which is part of the enamine formation process. So, the steps might be: deprotonation with a strong base like LDA, then alkylation with an iodide, and then hydrolysis.

Wait, let me think about the steps. So, the process is:

1. Start with a secondary amine and a ketone. The amine attacks the carbonyl, forming an iminium ion. Then, you deprotonate it with a base (like LDA), which deprotonates the alpha position to the iminium, forming an enamine. Then, you alkylate that with an alkyl halide, and then upon hydrolysis, you get a larger ketone.

Wait, but the starting material here is already an enamine (the iminium ion), so perhaps the steps involve something else.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an enamine, and the reaction is adding another group. Or perhaps it's a case where the enamine is being used to form a ketone via hydrolysis.

Wait, but the options for product B include things like pentan-2-one and heptan-4-one. So, perhaps the reaction is hydrolysis of the enamine to get back the carbonyl and the amine.

Wait, the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. If we hydrolyze this, what would happen? Let's see. The enamine would break down into a carbonyl compound and an amine.

So, the structure is N-methyl attached to a pentan-2-ylidene group. Breaking the C=N bond would give a ketone or aldehyde. Since the starting material is an enamine, the carbonyl would be on the same carbon as the double bond.

Wait, the starting enamine is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N+=CH2 with a methyl attached to N. Wait, no, that's not right. Maybe the structure is better written as (E)-N-methyl-N-(CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2) with a double bond.

Wait, perhaps it's better to draw it. Let's see: the enamine is something like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2 attached to N, which is also attached to CH3 and the other substituent. So, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N+=CH2, but with a methyl group on N.

Wait, maybe the enamine is (E)-configured, so the substituents on either side of the C=N are opposite each other.

So, when you hydrolyze this enamine, you'd break the C=N bond. The C would become a carbonyl group (since it's an enamine, so the alpha carbon is attached to the carbonyl), and the amine would come off.

Wait, the enamine is derived from a ketone and a secondary amine. So, when you hydrolyze, you'd get back the ketone and the amine.

In this case, the starting enamine is made from a certain amine and ketone. Let's see: the amine in the enamine is N-methyl and another group. So, perhaps the amine is N-methyl and the other part is pentyl or something.

Wait, the enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, ethanaminium implies a two-carbon chain for the amine. So, the amine is ethylamine, but N-methyl and substituted with the pentan-2-ylidene group.

So, the enamine is formed from an aldehyde or ketone. Let's say the carbonyl is pentan-2-one. Then, the enamine would be formed by reacting pentan-2-one with an amine.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options.

Option C says the product B is heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one is (CH2)3CO(CH2)2CH3. So, that's a seven-carbon chain with a ketone in the middle.

If the reaction adds a new group, perhaps via alkylation, then hydrolysis gives a longer ketone.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C: A is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+ ; product is heptan-4-one.

So, perhaps the process is:

1. Start with the enamine.

2. Deprotonate with LDA (a strong base) in DME (a solvent). LDA is a strong, non-nucleophilic base.

3. Alkylation with CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide). The base would deprotonate the enamine, making it a better nucleophile. Then, the ethyl iodide would add an ethyl group somewhere.

4. Then, acid work-up (H3O+) would hydrolyse the enamine to the ketone.

So, let's model this. Suppose the starting enamine is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N+=CH2 (with a methyl group on N). Wait, no, I'm a bit confused about the structure. Alternatively, the enamine is N-methyl and attached to a pentan-2-ylidene group.

Wait, another approach: the enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N+=CH(CH3).

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The enamine is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N+=CH2, and the N is also attached to a methyl group. So, the amine is N-methyl, and the other substituent is the pentan-2-ylidene group.

So, when you deprotonate with LDA, which is a strong base, you would abstract a proton alpha to the iminium ion. That would form an enolate-like species. Then, adding ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I) would alkylate the enolate, adding an ethyl group.

Then, upon acid hydrolysis (H3O+), the enamine would break down into a ketone and an amine.

Wait, but how does the alkylation affect the structure? Let's say the enamine is:

R2C=NR+ 

After deprotonation, the alpha position becomes a carbanion, which can attack an alkyl halide, adding an R' group.

So, in this case, the enamine is (E)-, so the substituents on the double bond are trans.

After deprotonation and alkylation, the structure would have an additional ethyl group.

Then, upon hydrolysis, the C=N breaks, and a carbonyl is formed where the N was, and the amine is released.

Let me try to count the carbons. The starting enamine's carbonyl part (the ketone part before enamine formation) would be pentan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. But the enamine is formed from a secondary amine and a ketone.

Wait, the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N+=CH2 (with a methyl group on N). Wait, that's not quite right.

Wait, ethanaminium implies a two-carbon chain for the amine. So, the amine is CH3NH2, but here it's N-methyl and substituted with a pentan-2-ylidene group.

So, perhaps the structure is more like (CH2)4CH2 with the double bond starting at position 2 (pentan-2-ylidene).

Wait, perhaps the enamine structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N+=CH2 with the N having a methyl group.

So, the enamine is:

(CH2)4CH2-N+=CH2 (with N also attached to CH3).

Wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N+=CH(CH3), but that seems like a three-carbon chain.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me think about the reaction steps again.

The starting material is an enamine. The reagents A involve LDA, DME, then CH3CH2I, then H3O+.

So, step 1: LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) is a strong base, used to deprotonate alpha to the iminium.

Deprotonation forms an enolate, which is a strong base and can attack an alkyl halide.

So, step 2: add CH3CH2I. The enolate would attack the ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to the alpha position.

Step 3: acid work-up (H3O+). This hydrolyzes the enamine, breaking the C=N bond, forming a ketone and releasing the amine.

So, the product would be the ketone, and the amine would be N,N-dimethylethanamine, perhaps.

Wait, looking at the options, option C says product B is heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one has seven carbons, with the ketone at position 4.

If the starting enamine is pentan-2-ylidene, adding an ethyl group would make it longer.

Wait, let's see: perhaps the starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine. So, when you form the enamine, the structure is R2C=CR'N+.

After alkylation, adding an ethyl group would increase the chain length.

Then, hydrolysis would give a longer ketone.

Wait, the original ketone was pentan-2-one (five carbons, ketone at position 2). If we add an ethyl group to the alpha position, that would give a seven-carbon chain when hydrolyzed.

Wait, let me imagine:

Original enamine: derived from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine (maybe dimethylamine?).

After alkylation, the enamine would have an ethyl group added, so the chain becomes longer.

Upon hydrolysis, the ketone would be formed. So, if the starting material's ketone was pentan-2-one, adding ethyl would make it heptan-4-one.

Wait, let's model it:

The enamine is from pentan-2-one and an amine. When you alkylate the enamine's alpha position, you add an ethyl group. Then, when you hydrolyse, the ketone is formed in a way that the chain is extended.

So, the original ketone is (CH2)3CO (pentan-2-one), but after adding an ethyl group, perhaps the carbonyl is now at position 4 in a seven-carbon chain.

So, heptan-4-one is (CH2)3COCH2CH2CH3, which is seven carbons with ketone at position 4.

So, the product would be heptan-4-one, and the amine would be N,N-dimethylethanamine (since the starting amine was N-methyl attached to another group, but perhaps after hydrolysis, it becomes dimethylamine? Or N,N-dimethyl something).

Looking at the options, option C says product B is heptan-4-one, and the reagent sequence is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

So, that matches the steps I was thinking: deprotonate with LDA, alkylate with ethyl iodide, then acid hydrolysis.

But looking at the options, option C has this sequence, and product B is heptan-4-one.

Another option is option D: reagents are (i) LDA, then DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+; product is heptan-4-one.

Wait, no, option D's reagents are (i) LDA, then (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. So, perhaps that's a different sequence.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

First, use LDA as the base in DME. Then, add CH3CH2I as the alkylating agent. Then, add H3O+ for work-up.

So, that would correspond to option C's A: (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

So, option C's product is heptan-4-one.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is pentan-2-one plus an amine, as in option B.

Wait, no, option B's product is pentan-2-one plus N,N-dimethylethanamine.

So, if the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, after hydrolysis, you get pentan-2-one (the original ketone) and the amine, which would be N,N-dimethyl something.

Wait, but in the steps, we're adding an ethyl group via alkylation. So, hydrolysis would give a larger ketone.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the number of carbons.

The starting enamine's carbonyl part is pentan-2-one (five carbons). Adding an ethyl group via alkylation would add two carbons, but where?

Wait, the enamine formation process:

Typically, you have R2C=O + R'NH2 → R2C=N-R' + H2O.

Then, when you form the enamine, you have R2C=CR'NH2. So, the enamine is R2C=CR'NH2.

When you deprotonate and alkylate, you add R'' to the alpha position. Then hydrolysis gives R2C(O)R'' and R'NH2.

Wait, perhaps in this reaction, the enamine already has the R' group as the pentan-2-ylidene. Then, adding R'' as ethyl would make the ketone R2C(O)R''.

So, for example, the starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine (like dimethylamine). So, the enamine is (CH3)2C=C(NR'') where R'' is the pentylidene part.

Wait, I'm getting a bit lost. Let me think about the product.

If the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, which is an iminium ion, then upon hydrolysis, it would form pentan-2-one and a secondary amine.

Wait, but the reagents involve LDA, DME, and ethyl iodide before hydrolysis. So, in this case, the enamine is first deprotonated, then alkylated, then hydrolyzed.

So, initial enamine is:

(CH2)4CH2-N+=CH2 (with a methyl on N). No, perhaps the structure is more like (CH2)3CH2-CH2-N+=CH2.

Wait, maybe the starting material is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N+=CH(CH3)

So, when you deprotonate (with LDA), you take a proton from the carbon adjacent to the iminium. Then, the enolate attacks ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group. Then, upon hydrolysis, you break the C=N bond, forming a ketone.

So, the structure after alkylation would have an additional ethyl group on the carbon that was deprotonated.

So, the original enamine is from pentan-2-one and N-methylamine. Let's say the enamine's structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N+=CH2 with a methyl group on N.

Wait, after deprotonation at the alpha position (the CH2 next to the N), you get a carbanion, which attacks CH3CH2I, adding an ethyl group to that position.

So, the structure becomes:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CHEt-N+=CH2 (with Et being ethyl and methyl on N).

Wait, no, maybe the ethyl is added to the same carbon that was deprotonated. So, the alpha carbon gets an ethyl group.

Then, during hydrolysis, the C=N breaks, and the carbonyl forms on the carbon that was part of the enamine.

Wait, perhaps the product is:

(CH2)3-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is heptan-4-one.

So, the product would have seven carbons, with the ketone at position 4.

Looking back at the options, option C's product is heptan-4-one, and the reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

So, that's option C.

Alternatively, looking at the reagent sequences in the options:

Option C: (i) LDA, DME → (ii) CH3CH2I → (iii) H3O+ → product is heptan-4-one.

So, that's the correct sequence.

Therefore, the answer should be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction involves an enamine, specifically (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, reacting with reagents A to form product B. The analysis of the reaction steps and the options provided is as follows:

1. **Understanding the Starting Material**: The starting material is an enamine, which is a conjugated system of a C=N bond formed from a secondary amine and a carbonyl compound. The structure of the enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine, with the enamine configuration being (E).

2. **Reaction Steps**:
   - **Step 1**: Deprotonation of the enamine using LDA (a strong, non-nucleophilic base) in DME (a solvent). This forms an enolate-like species, making the alpha carbon nucleophilic.
   - **Step 2**: Alkylation with CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide). The enolate attacks the ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to the alpha position of the enamine.
   - **Step 3**: Acidic work-up with H3O+. This hydrolyzes the enamine, breaking the C=N bond and forming a ketone.

3. **Product Analysis**:
   - The starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one. After alkylation, the chain length is extended by two carbons (from the ethyl group). Upon hydrolysis, the ketone is formed at the new position, resulting in heptan-4-one (a seven-carbon chain with a ketone at position 4).

4. **Option Evaluation**:
   - **Option C**: The sequence of reagents is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+, and the product is heptan-4-one. This matches the reaction steps and the expected product.
   - Other options either describe incorrect reagent sequences or incorrect products (e.g., pentan-2-one instead of heptan-4-one).

Thus, the correct sequence of reagents and the product are as described in **Option C**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here about enamine reactions. Hmm, I remember that enamines are usually formed from a ketone or aldehyde and a secondary amine.

The substituents are N-methyl and pentan-2-ylidene. The pentan-2-ylidene group is like a CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond starting at position 2, maybe? Or wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2- but with a double bond between C2 and C1? Hmm, maybe it's CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2- but attached to the nitrogen.

Wait, no, wait. Pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-. So the double bond is between C1 and C2 of the pentyl chain. So the structure is something like N-methyl attached to a CH2CH2CH2CH2CH2 group but with a double bond starting at the second position. Wait, maybe the structure is more like CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N-(CH3)+ ?

Wait, the starting material is an enamine. Enamines are typically formed from amines and carbonyl compounds. The process usually starts with deprotonation of the amine, then alkylation, then another step. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is already an enamine, so I'm not sure what reaction is happening here.

The question is about what happens when this starting material reacts with reagent A to form product B. The options are about the sequence of reagents and what B is.

Looking at the options, the choices involve sequences with LDA, DME, and then maybe an iodide like CH3CH2I, followed by H3O+.

Then, you might perform an alkylation. Maybe adding an alkyl halide like CH3CH2I. Then, perhaps quenching the reaction with acid (like H3O+) to hydrolyze it back.

Wait, but what's the product in this case? Let's see. The starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the structure is something like:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N+=CH2 with a methyl group attached to the N. Wait, no, wait: N-methyl and pentan-2-ylidene. So, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between the first and second C? No, wait, pentan-2-ylidene would be CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with the double bond between C2 and C3? Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me just think of the starting material as an iminium ion.

So, the starting material is an enamine, which is a conjugated system of a C=N. The reaction would involve deprotonation to form a more stabilized structure. Wait, but if the starting material is already an enamine, perhaps the reaction is a hydrolysis to regenerate the carbonyl compound and the amine.

Wait, but looking at the options, some of the products are ketones. For example, option C says B is heptan-4-one. Hmm, heptan-4-one is (CH2)3CO(CH2)2CH3.

Wait, let me think about the process. When you have an enamine, adding an acid would hydrolyze it back to the carbonyl and the amine. So, if you have an enamine, and you treat it with acid, you get the ketone or aldehyde and the amine.

Wait, but the starting material is an enamine (imium ion). So, perhaps the reaction involves opening it. Maybe the reagents A are a base, a solvent, and then something else.

Wait, but the options for product B include things like pentan-2-one and heptan-4-one. So, perhaps the reaction is hydrolysis of the enamine to get back the carbonyl and the amine.

Wait, the starting material is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. If we hydrolyze this, what would happen? Let's see. The enamine would break down into a carbonyl compound and an amine.

So, the structure is N-methyl attached to a pentan-2-ylidene group. Breaking the C=N bond would give a ketone or aldehyde. Since the starting material is an enamine, the carbonyl would be on the same carbon as the double bond.

So, the enamine is formed from an aldehyde or ketone. Let's say the carbonyl is pentan-2-one. Then, the enamine would be formed by reacting pentan-2-one with an amine.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options.

Option C says the product B is heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one is (CH2)3CO(CH2)2CH3. So, that's a seven-carbon chain with a ketone in the middle.

If the reaction adds a new group, perhaps via alkylation, then hydrolysis gives a longer ketone.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C: A is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+ ; product is heptan-4-one.

Wait, another approach: the enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N+=CH(CH3).

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The enamine is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N+=CH2, and the N is also attached to a methyl group. So, the amine is N-methyl, and the other substituent is the pentan-2-ylidene group.

So, when you deprotonate with LDA, which is a strong base, you would abstract a proton alpha to the iminium ion. That would form an enolate-like species. Then, adding ethyl iodide (CH3CH2I) would alkylate the enolate, adding an ethyl group.

Then, upon acid hydrolysis (H3O+), the enamine would break down into a ketone and an amine.

Wait, but how does the alkylation affect the structure? Let's say the enamine is:

R2C=NR+ 

After deprotonation, the alpha position becomes a carbanion, which can attack an alkyl halide, adding an R' group.

So, in this case, the enamine is (E)-, so the substituents on the double bond are trans.

After deprotonation and alkylation, the structure would have an additional ethyl group.

Then, upon hydrolysis, the C=N breaks, and a carbonyl is formed where the N was, and the amine is released.

Let me try to count the carbons. The starting enamine's carbonyl part (the ketone part before enamine formation) would be pentan-2-one, which is (CH3)2CO. But the enamine is formed from a secondary amine and a ketone.

Wait, the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium. So, the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N+=CH2 (with a methyl group on N). Wait, that's not quite right.

Wait, ethanaminium implies a two-carbon chain for the amine. So, the amine is CH3NH2, but here it's N-methyl and substituted with a pentan-2-ylidene group.

So, perhaps the structure is more like (CH2)4CH2 with the double bond starting at position 2 (pentan-2-ylidene).

Wait, perhaps the enamine structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N+=CH2 with the N having a methyl group.

So, the enamine is:

(CH2)4CH2-N+=CH2 (with N also attached to CH3).

Wait, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N+=CH(CH3), but that seems like a three-carbon chain.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me think about the reaction steps again.

The starting material is an enamine. The reagents A involve LDA, DME, then CH3CH2I, then H3O+.

So, step 1: LDA (lithium diisopropylamide) is a strong base, used to deprotonate alpha to the iminium.

Deprotonation forms an enolate, which is a strong base and can attack an alkyl halide.

So, step 2: add CH3CH2I. The enolate would attack the ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to the alpha position.

Step 3: acid work-up (H3O+). This hydrolyzes the enamine, breaking the C=N bond, forming a ketone and releasing the amine.

So, the product would be the ketone, and the amine would be N,N-dimethylethanamine, perhaps.

Wait, looking at the options, option C says product B is heptan-4-one. Heptan-4-one has seven carbons, with the ketone at position 4.

If the starting enamine is pentan-2-ylidene, adding an ethyl group would make it longer.

Wait, let's see: perhaps the starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine. So, when you form the enamine, the structure is R2C=CR'N+.

After alkylation, adding an ethyl group would increase the chain length.

Then, hydrolysis would give a longer ketone.

Wait, the original ketone was pentan-2-one (five carbons, ketone at position 2). If we add an ethyl group to the alpha position, that would give a seven-carbon chain when hydrolyzed.

Wait, let me imagine:

Original enamine: derived from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine (maybe dimethylamine?).

After alkylation, the enamine would have an ethyl group added, so the chain becomes longer.

Upon hydrolysis, the ketone would be formed. So, if the starting material's ketone was pentan-2-one, adding ethyl would make it heptan-4-one.

Wait, let's model it:

The enamine is from pentan-2-one and an amine. When you alkylate the enamine's alpha position, you add an ethyl group. Then, when you hydrolyse, the ketone is formed in a way that the chain is extended.

So, the original ketone is (CH2)3CO (pentan-2-one), but after adding an ethyl group, perhaps the carbonyl is now at position 4 in a seven-carbon chain.

So, heptan-4-one is (CH2)3COCH2CH2CH3, which is seven carbons with ketone at position 4.

So, the product would be heptan-4-one, and the amine would be N,N-dimethylethanamine (since the starting amine was N-methyl attached to another group, but perhaps after hydrolysis, it becomes dimethylamine? Or N,N-dimethyl something).

Looking at the options, option C says product B is heptan-4-one, and the reagent sequence is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

So, that matches the steps I was thinking: deprotonate with LDA, alkylate with ethyl iodide, then acid hydrolysis.

But looking at the options, option C has this sequence, and product B is heptan-4-one.

Another option is option D: reagents are (i) LDA, then DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+; product is heptan-4-one.

Wait, no, option D's reagents are (i) LDA, then (ii) DME, CH3CH2I, H3O+. So, perhaps that's a different sequence.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is:

First, use LDA as the base in DME. Then, add CH3CH2I as the alkylating agent. Then, add H3O+ for work-up.

So, that would correspond to option C's A: (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

So, option C's product is heptan-4-one.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is pentan-2-one plus an amine, as in option B.

Wait, no, option B's product is pentan-2-one plus N,N-dimethylethanamine.

So, if the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, after hydrolysis, you get pentan-2-one (the original ketone) and the amine, which would be N,N-dimethyl something.

Wait, but in the steps, we're adding an ethyl group via alkylation. So, hydrolysis would give a larger ketone.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the number of carbons.

The starting enamine's carbonyl part is pentan-2-one (five carbons). Adding an ethyl group via alkylation would add two carbons, but where?

Wait, the enamine formation process:

Typically, you have R2C=O + R'NH2 → R2C=N-R' + H2O.

Then, when you form the enamine, you have R2C=CR'NH2. So, the enamine is R2C=CR'NH2.

When you deprotonate and alkylate, you add R'' to the alpha position. Then hydrolysis gives R2C(O)R'' and R'NH2.

Wait, perhaps in this reaction, the enamine already has the R' group as the pentan-2-ylidene. Then, adding R'' as ethyl would make the ketone R2C(O)R''.

So, for example, the starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine (like dimethylamine). So, the enamine is (CH3)2C=C(NR'') where R'' is the pentylidene part.

Wait, I'm getting a bit lost. Let me think about the product.

If the starting enamine is (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, which is an iminium ion, then upon hydrolysis, it would form pentan-2-one and a secondary amine.

Wait, but the reagents involve LDA, DME, and ethyl iodide before hydrolysis. So, in this case, the enamine is first deprotonated, then alkylated, then hydrolyzed.

So, initial enamine is:

(CH2)4CH2-N+=CH2 (with a methyl on N). No, perhaps the structure is more like (CH2)3CH2-CH2-N+=CH2.

Wait, maybe the starting material is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N+=CH(CH3)

So, when you deprotonate (with LDA), you take a proton from the carbon adjacent to the iminium. Then, the enolate attacks ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group. Then, upon hydrolysis, you break the C=N bond, forming a ketone.

So, the structure after alkylation would have an additional ethyl group on the carbon that was deprotonated.

So, the original enamine is from pentan-2-one and N-methylamine. Let's say the enamine's structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-N+=CH2 with a methyl group on N.

Wait, after deprotonation at the alpha position (the CH2 next to the N), you get a carbanion, which attacks CH3CH2I, adding an ethyl group to that position.

So, the structure becomes:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CHEt-N+=CH2 (with Et being ethyl and methyl on N).

Wait, no, maybe the ethyl is added to the same carbon that was deprotonated. So, the alpha carbon gets an ethyl group.

Then, during hydrolysis, the C=N breaks, and the carbonyl forms on the carbon that was part of the enamine.

Wait, perhaps the product is:

(CH2)3-CO-CH2-CH2-CH3, which is heptan-4-one.

So, the product would have seven carbons, with the ketone at position 4.

Looking back at the options, option C's product is heptan-4-one, and the reagents are (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+.

So, that's option C.

Alternatively, looking at the reagent sequences in the options:

Option C: (i) LDA, DME → (ii) CH3CH2I → (iii) H3O+ → product is heptan-4-one.

So, that's the correct sequence.

Therefore, the answer should be option C.


The reaction involves an enamine, specifically (E)-N-methyl-N-(pentan-2-ylidene)ethanaminium, reacting with reagents A to form product B. The analysis of the reaction steps and the options provided is as follows:

1. **Understanding the Starting Material**: The starting material is an enamine, which is a conjugated system of a C=N bond formed from a secondary amine and a carbonyl compound. The structure of the enamine is derived from pentan-2-one and a secondary amine, with the enamine configuration being (E).

2. **Reaction Steps**:
   - **Step 1**: Deprotonation of the enamine using LDA (a strong, non-nucleophilic base) in DME (a solvent). This forms an enolate-like species, making the alpha carbon nucleophilic.
   - **Step 2**: Alkylation with CH3CH2I (ethyl iodide). The enolate attacks the ethyl iodide, adding an ethyl group to the alpha position of the enamine.
   - **Step 3**: Acidic work-up with H3O+. This hydrolyzes the enamine, breaking the C=N bond and forming a ketone.

3. **Product Analysis**:
   - The starting enamine is derived from pentan-2-one. After alkylation, the chain length is extended by two carbons (from the ethyl group). Upon hydrolysis, the ketone is formed at the new position, resulting in heptan-4-one (a seven-carbon chain with a ketone at position 4).

4. **Option Evaluation**:
   - **Option C**: The sequence of reagents is (i) LDA, DME; (ii) CH3CH2I; (iii) H3O+, and the product is heptan-4-one. This matches the reaction steps and the expected product.
   - Other options either describe incorrect reagent sequences or incorrect products (e.g., pentan-2-one instead of heptan-4-one).

Thus, the correct sequence of reagents and the product are as described in **Option C**.
