Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck Observatory. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the basics. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations. The question is about which stars are bright enough to be detected by both. The key here is the apparent magnitude of the stars because each spectrograph has a different brightness limit.

From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, that means any star with V mag less than or equal to 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. On the other hand, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, HIRES needs stars to be at most 16 mag or brighter.

Wait, no, wait. I think I got that backwards. Because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter. So, if a telescope can observe up to 17 mag, that includes all stars brighter than 17 mag. So, the brighter the star (lower mag), the better. So, if a star is 15 mag, both can see it. But if a star is 16.5, ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES can't because HIRES only goes up to 16 mag. Wait, but no, wait the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO, and "brighter than 16" for HIRES. So wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The apparent magnitude scale is such that lower numbers mean brighter objects. So, a magnitude of 6 is brighter than 10. So, when a telescope can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes "brighter than 17 mag", that means any star with V mag less than 17 is visible. So, a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17, so it's within both's capabilities. But a star that's V=17 can only be seen by ESPRESSO, not by HIRES, because HIRES can only go up to 16.

Wait no, because the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. Wait, that's confusing. If a star is brighter than 17 mag, that would be V <17. Because if a star is brighter, then a lower magnitude. So, for example, a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So, if a spectrograph can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, that would mean stars with V ≤17? Or perhaps the description is the other way.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of magnitude limits. Let me rephrase: For ESPRESSO, the limit is V ≤17. Because if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means V is less than 17. So, any star with V ≤17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, the limit is V ≤16, because stars brighter than 16 mag (V <16) can be seen.

So, for a star to be detectable by both, it must have V ≤16, because HIRES can't go beyond 16. So, any star with V mag ≤16 can be observed by both.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. If HIRES can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 16, that means V <16. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so V <17. So, the overlapping range is V <16. So, any star with V magnitude less than or equal to 16 can be seen by both. Wait, no. Because the way it's phrased is "brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO, which would be V <17. Similarly, "brighter than 16" for HIRES, so V <16. So, for a star to be detected by both, it must have V <16. Because if a star is V=16.5, it's brighter than 17? No, wait. Wait, 16 is brighter than 17. So, a star with V=16.5 is dimmer than 16 and brighter than 17. So, for HIRES, it can't observe that, because HIRES's limit is brighter than 16, which is V <16. So, a star with V=16.5 is fainter than 16, so it's 16.5, which is dimmer than the limit. So, not observable by HIRES. But ESPRESSO can observe it because 16.5 <17.

So, to be detected by both, the star's V must be ≤16 mag.

So now, I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star and see which are ≤16. But wait, for some stars, the apparent magnitude isn't given; their absolute magnitude is given. So, I need to calculate the apparent magnitude for those.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Star1:
- Absolute V magnitude: 15.5 mag
- Distance: 10 pc

Apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated using the distance modulus formula:
m = M + 5 log10(d/10)
Where M is absolute magnitude, d is distance in parsecs.

So, for Star1: m = 15.5 + 5 * log(10/10) → log(1) is 0. So m=15.5. So, 15.5 mag. That's less than 16, so it's within both's limits. So, Star1 can be detected by both.

Star2:
- Apparent V magnitude: 16.5 mag
- Distance: 5 pc

Wait, wait, but Star2's apparent magnitude is given as 16.5. So, that's already the m. So, m=16.5.

Since 16.5 >16, it's fainter than what HIRES can detect (which requires m <16). But ESPRESSO can detect it because m=16.5 <17. So, Star2 can be detected by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES.

Star3:
- Apparent V magnitude: 15.5 mag
- E(B-V) = 0.6 mag
- Distance: 15 pc

Wait, but the apparent V magnitude given is 15.5. But wait, wait, the star's light is affected by interstellar extinction (dust), which is accounted by E(B-V). So, the observed apparent magnitude isn't the same as the intrinsic. Hmm, do I need to correct for extinction?

The question says: For the sake of simplicity, let's disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes (such as maximum and minimum elevations) as well as the altitudes of the telescopes. But it doesn't mention anything about interstellar extinction. So, perhaps I should assume that the given apparent magnitudes are already corrected for extinction? Or do I have to calculate the extinction and adjust the apparent magnitude?

Wait, looking back, the question says: "Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1." Hmm, so perhaps the given apparent V magnitudes are already the observed, and the extinction (absorption) isn't considered? Wait, no, the note is probably about how to calculate the extinction effect.

Wait, let me re-examine Star3's data. The question says: Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag. But E(B-V) is 0.6 mag. The note says that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess with a coefficient of 3.1. So, perhaps the observed magnitude is m_obs = m_true + extinction.

The formula for extinction in V is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So, Av = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag.

So, the observed V magnitude is m_obs = m_intrinsic + Av.

Wait, but wait: if the star's apparent magnitude m is given before extinction, then the observed m would be higher (since extinction makes it dimmer). So, if Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but with extinction of 1.86 mag, what's the observed m?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: The star's light is affected by dust, which makes it appear dimmer (higher m). So, if the star emits a certain amount of light, when it passes through dust, it loses some photons, making it appear fainter. So, if you measure its apparent magnitude, it's higher than it would be without dust.

So, m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The formula is:

Apparent magnitude with extinction: m + Av = m_observed.

Wait, no, the formula is m_observed (after extinction) = m_true (without extinction) + Av. Because higher Av means dimmer, so higher m.

So, if Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is after correcting for extinction, or before? Hmm, the question states that Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but also gives E(B-V)=0.6. So, perhaps the 15.5 is the observed magnitude, which includes extinction. So, to find the intrinsic m, it would be m_observed - Av.

Wait, but the question says that with HIRES and ESPRESSO, we're considering their detection limits based on apparent magnitude. So, if the apparent magnitude is affected by extinction, that determines whether the star is bright enough for the spectrograph.

So, perhaps to get the correct apparent magnitude, we need to subtract the extinction? Because the extinction makes the star appear fainter. Wait, no. Let's think about this.

Extinction (Av) makes the star appear dimmer, so it increases the apparent magnitude. For example, if a star has m_true =15, and Av=1, then m_observed =16.

So, if a star is observed with m_obs=15.5, but it's actually suffering from Av=1.86, what would the true (intrinsic) m be?

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think: The question is about whether the star can be detected by the spectrographs. The spectrographs' detection limits are based on the observed apparent magnitude. So, if the star's apparent magnitude (as observed through the telescope) is m, and if m is less than 17 (for ESPRESSO) or less than 16 (for HIRES), then it can be detected.

But if the star's light is dimmed by extinction, its observed m would be higher, making it dimmer. So, if Star3's apparent magnitude without extinction is 15.5, but due to extinction, its observed m is 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36? Wait, that can't be right because that would make it brighter than 17? Wait, no, adding makes it dimmer.

Wait, let me clarify: The formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av. So, if the star's true m is 15.5, and Av=1.86, then m_observed is 15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Wait, but if a star's true apparent magnitude is 15.5, but due to dust, its observed magnitude is 17.36. So, the observed magnitude is higher, meaning the star appears dimmer than it actually is. So, the spectrograph's detection limit is based on the observed magnitude.

So, for Star3, the apparent magnitude is 15.5, but after correcting for extinction, the observed m would be higher. Wait, no, I think that the apparent magnitude given (15.5) is what is observed. So, including extinction. Because in astronomy, when you measure an apparent magnitude, you're measuring it through the dust, so the extinction is already accounted for.

Wait, but sometimes data might give the "intrinsic" magnitude, and you have to correct for extinction to find the observed. But the way the question is phrased, Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5. So, perhaps that's before extinction. Or is it after?

Wait, the question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag". So, that's m. But then, E(B-V) is given as 0.6. So, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the observed (including extinction), and the E(B-V) is the color excess. In that case, the extinction in V band is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 1.86 mag. So, the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - Av = 15.5 -1.86 = 13.64 mag.

Wait, but now I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The star's light is absorbed by dust, so when we observe it, it's dimmer. So, the observed apparent magnitude is higher than the intrinsic (without dust) magnitude. So, m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av.

So, if the question gives Star3's apparent magnitude as 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6 (so Av=1.86), then the intrinsic m is 15.5 -1.86 =13.64. So, without extinction, the star would appear at 13.64 mag. But wait, that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the 15.5 mag is the observed magnitude, which is after extinction. So, the intrinsic (absolute) magnitude is M, and the apparent magnitude (m) would be M + distance modulus + Av.

Wait, no. Absolute magnitude is a measure of the star's intrinsic brightness, while apparent magnitude is what we observe, which includes distance and extinction.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me reorganize.

The formula for apparent magnitude (including extinction) is:

m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + Av

Where:
- M is absolute magnitude
- d is distance in parsecs
- Av is the extinction in V band (which is 3.1 * E(B-V))

So, for Star3:

M is not given. Wait, wait, looking back: Star3 has apparent V magnitude of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So, m observed is 15.5. So, perhaps the formula is:

15.5 = M + 5 log10(15/10) + Av.

Wait, but that would require knowing M. Alternatively, perhaps Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but considering extinction, what is the intrinsic apparent magnitude?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see what the question is asking. It's asking which stars can be detected by both spectrographs. So, I need to find which stars have apparent V magnitudes ≤16 (since HIRES can't go beyond 16) and ≤17 (ESPRESSO can go up to 17). So, the overlapping is ≤16.

But to find the apparent magnitude observed, which includes extinction, we have to correct for Av. Because the spectrograph's limit is based on the observed apparent magnitude.

So, for Star3, if the apparent magnitude is 15.5, but after extinction, m_observed is higher. Wait, no, I think the given 15.5 is the observed m, including extinction. So, perhaps the star's actual m (without extinction) would be 15.5 minus Av.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the true m, and I have to calculate the observed m by adding Av.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is as follows:

When a star has some interstellar extinction (Av), the observed apparent magnitude is m_obs = m_true + Av.

So, if the question gives the star's apparent magnitude as m_true, then m_obs = m_true + Av.

But in the case of Star3, the question gives "apparent V magnitude of 15.5", but then gives E(B-V)=0.6. So, perhaps the 15.5 is the observed magnitude, and the extinction is causing it to be dimmer. Alternatively, perhaps the 15.5 is the true apparent magnitude, and the extinction makes it dimmer.

Wait, this is getting really complicated. Let me try to find another approach.

Another approach: for each star, calculate the apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction, and then check if m ≤16 (for both spectrographs).

Let's go through each star:

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc.

m = M + 5 log(d/10) → 15.5 + 5 log(10/10) =15.5 +0=15.5.

No extinction mentioned, so m=15.5. So, it's within both's limits (since 15.5 ≤16).

Star2: apparent V mag 16.5, no E(B-V) given, so no extinction. So, m=16.5. HIRES can't detect (needs m ≤16), so Star2 can't be detected by HIRES.

Star3: apparent V mag 15.5 (but wait, this is the observed m?), E(B-V)=0.6.

Wait, but in the data, Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but E(B-V) is 0.6, implying extinction. So, perhaps the 15.5 is the true apparent magnitude, and the observed m is higher.

Wait, no. If E(B-V) is given, and the star is affected by extinction, the observed m is higher. So, Star3's observed m would be 15.5 + Av.

Av =3.1 * 0.6=1.86.

So, m_obs =15.5 +1.86=17.36. That's higher than 17. So, it's beyond ESPRESSO's limit (which is V ≤17). So, Star3 can't be detected by either spectrograph.

Wait, but that can't be right, because Star3's m_obs would be 17.36, which is beyond both limits. So, Star3 can't be detected by either.

But wait, perhaps the given apparent magnitude already accounts for extinction. If the 15.5 is the observed magnitude, then the extinction is already included. So, m_obs=15.5. Then, since 15.5 ≤16, it can be detected by both.

But the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing. Star3's description says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag".

In standard terms, the observed apparent magnitude would be higher than the intrinsic (without extinction) magnitude. So, perhaps the 15.5 is the intrinsic apparent magnitude, and the observed m is 15.5 +1.86=17.36.

But that would make it too faint for both.

But wait, maybe the opposite: the given apparent magnitude is the observed (including extinction), so to find the intrinsic m, it's 15.5 -1.86=13.64. But that doesn't affect the detection, because detection is based on observed m.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think: the question is about whether the star's apparent magnitude (as observed) is ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES). So, if Star3's apparent V is 15.5, and that's the observed (meaning it's already been corrected for extinction), then m=15.5 is within both's limits.

But if the 15.5 is the intrinsic (without extinction) apparent magnitude, then the observed would be 17.36, which is too faint for both.

So, what's the correct approach here?

I think the key is to determine whether the given apparent magnitude (m) includes the effect of extinction (Av) or not. If the given m is the observed (which includes Av), then we don't need to adjust it. If the given m is the true (without Av), then we have to add Av to get the observed m.

In the question, Star3's data includes E(B-V), so it's likely that the given m is the true (intrinsic) value, and we need to calculate the observed m by adding Av.

But let me see: the way the question is phrased for Star3 is:

"apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us."

Hmm, but E(B-V) is a measure of extinction. So, the apparent magnitude given is before extinction is applied. Or is it after?

Wait, perhaps the apparent magnitude given is the observed, which includes extinction. Because the apparent magnitude is what you measure. So, if the star's light is dimmed by extinction, the observed m is higher. So, if the given m is 15.5, that's the observed. So, no need to adjust.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because then the E(B-V) wouldn't affect anything. So, perhaps the given m is the intrinsic, and we need to calculate the observed by adding Av.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the observed m for Star3 and Star4, considering extinction.

Let me proceed:

Star3:

Given:
- M = 15.5 (but wait, no, Star3's absolute magnitude might not be given. Wait, Star3's data: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us."

Wait, so Star3's data:

- Apparent V mag, m =15.5 (without extinction? Or including?)

But E(B-V)=0.6, which affects the V band as Av=3.1*0.6=1.86.

So, if the given m is the observed m, then the star's true brightness is m - Av =15.5 -1.86 =13.64. But that doesn't matter for the detection because detection is based on observed m.

Wait, but the question is about which stars can be detected. So, if Star3's observed m is 15.5 (which is including extinction), then it's within both's limits.

Alternatively, perhaps the given m is the true (without extinction), so the observed m is 15.5+1.86=17.36, which is too faint for both.

But how can that be? Because Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but with that extinction, the observed is 17.36, which is beyond both's limits.

Wait, but that would mean Star3 can't be detected by either, which would affect the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the given m is the true (without extinction), and I have to calculate the observed m.

So, for Star3:

m_obs = m_true + Av.

m_true =15.5.

Av=1.86.

m_obs=15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Which is above both limits. So, Star3 can't be detected by either.

But wait, Star3's distance is 15 pc, which might affect its m. Wait, no. Because absolute magnitude is M, and m is calculated from M and distance. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between absolute and apparent magnitudes.

Wait, Star3's absolute magnitude isn't given. Wait, no, the data for Star3 is:

- RA = 11h, DEC=48 deg.

- apparent V mag=15.5.

- E(B-V)=0.6.

- distance=15 pc.

So, perhaps to calculate the true apparent magnitude, I can use the distance modulus formula, but also include extinction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps I should proceed to the other stars and see.

Star4:

- Absolute V mag=15.5.

- E(B-V)=0.4.

- Distance=10 pc.

So, first, compute the apparent magnitude without extinction.

m = M +5 log(d/10) =15.5 +5 log(10/10)=15.5 +0=15.5.

Now, add extinction. Av=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So, the observed m =15.5 +1.24=16.74 mag.

Which is above both limits. Because HIRES requires m ≤16, and ESPRESSO requires m ≤17.

So, m=16.74 is above 17? No, 16.74 is less than 17. So, 16.74 is below 17. So, ESPRESSO can detect it (since m <17), but HIRES requires m <16, which is not the case. So, Star4 can be detected by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Star5:

- Absolute V mag=16.5.

- Distance=5 pc.

So, compute apparent magnitude without extinction.

m = M +5 log(d/10) =16.5 +5 log(5/10)=16.5 +5 log(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995 ≈15.0 mag.

Assume no extinction (since E(B-V) isn't given), so m=15.0.

Which is ≤16, so detectable by both.

So, Star5's m is about 15.0, which is within both's limits.

Wait, but wait, the question says Star5 has E(B-V) =0.4 mag? No, wait, looking back: Star5's description: "absolute V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us." So, no E(B-V) given. So, no extinction.

So, m=15.0, which is within both.

So, now, let's summarize each star's m_obs (apparent magnitude including extinction, if applicable):

Star1: m=15.5 (no extinction) → detectable by both.

Star2: m=16.5 → detectable by ESPRESSO only.

Star3: If the given m is the observed (including extinction), then m=15.5 → detectable by both. Else, if it's the intrinsic, then m_obs=17.36 → detectable by neither.

Star4: m_obs=16.74 → detectable by ESPRESSO only.

Star5: m=15.0 → detectable by both.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Star4 and Star5. Star4 can be detected by ESPRESSO only. Star5 can be detected by both. So, this option includes Star5, which is correct, but Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO. So, the two stars in option A can't both be detected by both spectrographs.

Option B: Star3 and Star5. If Star3's m_obs=15.5, then both can be detected. But earlier analysis is conflicting. If given m is observed, then Star3 is detectable by both. So, Star3 and Star5 would both be detectable by both. But no, Star5 is detectable by both, Star3's m is 15.5, which is ≤16, so detectable by both. So option B could be correct if Star3 is detectable.

Option C: Star2 and Star3. Star2's m=16.5 → detectable by ESPRESSO only. Star3, if m_obs=15.5, detectable by both. So, only Star3 is detectable by both, Star2 only by ESPRESSO. So, no.

Option D: Star1 and Star4. Star1 is detectable by both. Star4 is detectable only by ESPRESSO. So, only Star1 is correct.

Wait, but earlier analysis of Star4: m_obs=16.74. Which is brighter than 16.74 >16 → HIRES can't detect (since needs m ≤16). So, Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

So, which stars can be detected by both:

Star1: yes.

Star3: depends on whether the given m is observed or not. If the given m includes extinction, then yes. If not, then m_obs is 17.36 → no.

Star5: yes.

So, which of the options include both Star1 and Star5? Let's check the options:

Looking at the options:

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 isn't detected by both.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → depends on Star3.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 isn't detected by both.

Wait, the correct stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3 (if m_obs=15.5), and Star5.

But looking at the options, none of them include all three. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is about whether Star3's m includes extinction. Let me think again.

The question says Star3 has apparent V magnitude of 15.5. So, that's the observed m. Because in astronomy, when someone gives you the apparent magnitude, it's what you observe, which includes extinction and distance.

So, for Star3, m_obs=15.5. So, it's within both's limits. So, Star3 can be detected by both.

Similarly, Star1: m=15.5 → yes.

Star5: m=15.0 → yes.

So, the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

But looking at the options, which pairs are given?

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both. So, option B would be correct.

But wait, Star3's data includes E(B-V), which would affect the observed m. Wait, but if the given m is already the observed (after extinction), then the E(B-V) is extra information, perhaps for another purpose.

But in that case, for Star3, m_obs=15.5 → yes.

So, the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → yes.

So, the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but let me double-check each star:

- Star1: m=15.5 → detect by both → yes.

- Star3: m=15.5 → detect by both → yes.

- Star5: m=15.0 → detect by both → yes.

But the options don't include a trio, only pairs.

Wait, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by both.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't be detected by both.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by both.

So, the correct answer would be option B: Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, but what about Star1? It can also be detected by both. So, why isn't option D (Star1 and Star4) correct? Because Star4 can't be detected by both.

Wait, but if the question is which stars can be detected by both, Star1 is one, Star3 another, Star5 another. But since the options are pairs, the option that includes two correct stars would be B (Star3 and Star5) and possibly another pair.

Wait, but in the options, option B is the only one where both stars can be detected by both spectrographs.

So, the correct answer is option B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars and compare them to the detection limits of the two instruments. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., \( m \leq 17 \)), while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag (i.e., \( m \leq 16 \)). Therefore, a star must have \( m \leq 16 \) to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:
   - Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \)
   - Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)
   - Apparent magnitude: \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5 \)
   - \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \), so Star1 can be detected by both spectrographs.

2. **Star2**:
   - Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 16.5 \)
   - \( m = 16.5 > 16 \), so Star2 cannot be detected by HIRES, but it can be detected by ESPRESSO.

3. **Star3**:
   - Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 15.5 \)
   - E(B-V): \( 0.6 \), so extinction in the V band: \( A_V = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \)
   - The question does not explicitly state whether the given \( m = 15.5 \) includes extinction. If \( m = 15.5 \) is the observed magnitude (already accounting for extinction), then \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \), and Star3 can be detected by both spectrographs. If \( m = 15.5 \) is the intrinsic magnitude (before extinction), the observed magnitude would be \( m_{\text{obs}} = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36 \), which is too faint for both spectrographs. However, the question likely assumes the given \( m \) is the observed magnitude, so Star3 can be detected by both spectrographs.

4. **Star4**:
   - Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \)
   - Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)
   - Apparent magnitude: \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5 \)
   - E(B-V): \( 0.4 \), so extinction in the V band: \( A_V = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \)
   - Observed magnitude: \( m_{\text{obs}} = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \)
   - \( m_{\text{obs}} = 16.74 > 16 \), so Star4 cannot be detected by HIRES, but it can be detected by ESPRESSO.

5. **Star5**:
   - Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 16.5 \)
   - Distance: \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \)
   - Apparent magnitude: \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 - 1.5 = 15.0 \)
   - \( m = 15.0 \leq 16 \), so Star5 can be detected by both spectrographs.

### Conclusion:
- **Star1**: Detectable by both.
- **Star2**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.
- **Star3**: Detectable by both (assuming \( m = 15.5 \) is the observed magnitude).
- **Star4**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.
- **Star5**: Detectable by both.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) Star4 and Star5**: Star4 is not detectable by both spectrographs, so this option is incorrect.

- **C) Star2 and Star3**: Star2 is not detectable by both spectrographs, so this option is incorrect.
- **D) Star1 and Star4**: Star4 is not detectable by both spectrographs, so this option is incorrect.

**Correct Answer**: B

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about stars and which ones can be detected by two different spectrographs: ESPRESSO at Paranal and HIRES at Keck Observatory. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the basics. Both ESPRESSO and HIRES are high-resolution spectrographs used for various astronomical observations. The question is about which stars are bright enough to be detected by both. The key here is the apparent magnitude of the stars because each spectrograph has a different brightness limit.

From the question, ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag. So, that means any star with V mag less than or equal to 17 can be seen by ESPRESSO. On the other hand, HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 V mag. So, HIRES needs stars to be at most 16 mag or brighter.

Wait, no, wait. I think I got that backwards. Because lower magnitude numbers mean brighter. So, if a telescope can observe up to 17 mag, that includes all stars brighter than 17 mag. So, the brighter the star (lower mag), the better. So, if a star is 15 mag, both can see it. But if a star is 16.5, ESPRESSO can see it, but HIRES can't because HIRES only goes up to 16 mag. Wait, but no, wait the question says "brighter than 17 mag" for ESPRESSO, and "brighter than 16" for HIRES. So wait, no, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The apparent magnitude scale is such that lower numbers mean brighter objects. So, a magnitude of 6 is brighter than 10. So, when a telescope can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes "brighter than 17 mag", that means any star with V mag less than 17 is visible. So, a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17, so it's within both's capabilities. But a star that's V=17 can only be seen by ESPRESSO, not by HIRES, because HIRES can only go up to 16.

Wait no, because the question says that with ESPRESSO, stars with V mag brighter than 17 can be observed. Wait, that's confusing. If a star is brighter than 17 mag, that would be V <17. Because if a star is brighter, then a lower magnitude. So, for example, a star with V=16 is brighter than V=17. So, if a spectrograph can observe stars with V mag brighter than 17, that would mean stars with V ≤17? Or perhaps the description is the other way.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of magnitude limits. Let me rephrase: For ESPRESSO, the limit is V ≤17. Because if a star is brighter than 17 mag, that means V is less than 17. So, any star with V ≤17 can be observed by ESPRESSO. Similarly, for HIRES, the limit is V ≤16, because stars brighter than 16 mag (V <16) can be seen.

So, for a star to be detectable by both, it must have V ≤16, because HIRES can't go beyond 16. So, any star with V mag ≤16 can be observed by both.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. If HIRES can observe stars with V magnitudes brighter than 16, that means V <16. ESPRESSO can go up to 17, so V <17. So, the overlapping range is V <16. So, any star with V magnitude less than or equal to 16 can be seen by both. Wait, no. Because the way it's phrased is "brighter than 17" for ESPRESSO, which would be V <17. Similarly, "brighter than 16" for HIRES, so V <16. So, for a star to be detected by both, it must have V <16. Because if a star is V=16.5, it's brighter than 17? No, wait. Wait, 16 is brighter than 17. So, a star with V=16.5 is dimmer than 16 and brighter than 17. So, for HIRES, it can't observe that, because HIRES's limit is brighter than 16, which is V <16. So, a star with V=16.5 is fainter than 16, so it's 16.5, which is dimmer than the limit. So, not observable by HIRES. But ESPRESSO can observe it because 16.5 <17.

So, to be detected by both, the star's V must be ≤16 mag.

So now, I need to calculate the apparent V magnitude for each star and see which are ≤16. But wait, for some stars, the apparent magnitude isn't given; their absolute magnitude is given. So, I need to calculate the apparent magnitude for those.

Let me go through each star one by one.

Star1:
- Absolute V magnitude: 15.5 mag
- Distance: 10 pc

Apparent magnitude (m) can be calculated using the distance modulus formula:
m = M + 5 log10(d/10)
Where M is absolute magnitude, d is distance in parsecs.

So, for Star1: m = 15.5 + 5 * log(10/10) → log(1) is 0. So m=15.5. So, 15.5 mag. That's less than 16, so it's within both's limits. So, Star1 can be detected by both.

Star2:
- Apparent V magnitude: 16.5 mag
- Distance: 5 pc

Wait, wait, but Star2's apparent magnitude is given as 16.5. So, that's already the m. So, m=16.5.

Since 16.5 >16, it's fainter than what HIRES can detect (which requires m <16). But ESPRESSO can detect it because m=16.5 <17. So, Star2 can be detected by ESPRESSO but not by HIRES.

Star3:
- Apparent V magnitude: 15.5 mag
- E(B-V) = 0.6 mag
- Distance: 15 pc

Wait, but the apparent V magnitude given is 15.5. But wait, wait, the star's light is affected by interstellar extinction (dust), which is accounted by E(B-V). So, the observed apparent magnitude isn't the same as the intrinsic. Hmm, do I need to correct for extinction?

The question says: For the sake of simplicity, let's disregard the pointing limits of the telescopes (such as maximum and minimum elevations) as well as the altitudes of the telescopes. But it doesn't mention anything about interstellar extinction. So, perhaps I should assume that the given apparent magnitudes are already corrected for extinction? Or do I have to calculate the extinction and adjust the apparent magnitude?

Wait, looking back, the question says: "Note that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess in B-V with a coefficient equal to 3.1." Hmm, so perhaps the given apparent V magnitudes are already the observed, and the extinction (absorption) isn't considered? Wait, no, the note is probably about how to calculate the extinction effect.

Wait, let me re-examine Star3's data. The question says: Star3 has an apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag. But E(B-V) is 0.6 mag. The note says that the total absorption in the V band is related to the color excess with a coefficient of 3.1. So, perhaps the observed magnitude is m_obs = m_true + extinction.

The formula for extinction in V is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V). So, Av = 3.1 * 0.6 = 1.86 mag.

So, the observed V magnitude is m_obs = m_intrinsic + Av.

Wait, but wait: if the star's apparent magnitude m is given before extinction, then the observed m would be higher (since extinction makes it dimmer). So, if Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but with extinction of 1.86 mag, what's the observed m?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify: The star's light is affected by dust, which makes it appear dimmer (higher m). So, if the star emits a certain amount of light, when it passes through dust, it loses some photons, making it appear fainter. So, if you measure its apparent magnitude, it's higher than it would be without dust.

So, m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The formula is:

Apparent magnitude with extinction: m + Av = m_observed.

Wait, no, the formula is m_observed (after extinction) = m_true (without extinction) + Av. Because higher Av means dimmer, so higher m.

So, if Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, which is after correcting for extinction, or before? Hmm, the question states that Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but also gives E(B-V)=0.6. So, perhaps the 15.5 is the observed magnitude, which includes extinction. So, to find the intrinsic m, it would be m_observed - Av.

Wait, but the question says that with HIRES and ESPRESSO, we're considering their detection limits based on apparent magnitude. So, if the apparent magnitude is affected by extinction, that determines whether the star is bright enough for the spectrograph.

So, perhaps to get the correct apparent magnitude, we need to subtract the extinction? Because the extinction makes the star appear fainter. Wait, no. Let's think about this.

Extinction (Av) makes the star appear dimmer, so it increases the apparent magnitude. For example, if a star has m_true =15, and Av=1, then m_observed =16.

So, if a star is observed with m_obs=15.5, but it's actually suffering from Av=1.86, what would the true (intrinsic) m be?

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think: The question is about whether the star can be detected by the spectrographs. The spectrographs' detection limits are based on the observed apparent magnitude. So, if the star's apparent magnitude (as observed through the telescope) is m, and if m is less than 17 (for ESPRESSO) or less than 16 (for HIRES), then it can be detected.

But if the star's light is dimmed by extinction, its observed m would be higher, making it dimmer. So, if Star3's apparent magnitude without extinction is 15.5, but due to extinction, its observed m is 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36? Wait, that can't be right because that would make it brighter than 17? Wait, no, adding makes it dimmer.

Wait, let me clarify: The formula is m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av. So, if the star's true m is 15.5, and Av=1.86, then m_observed is 15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Wait, but if a star's true apparent magnitude is 15.5, but due to dust, its observed magnitude is 17.36. So, the observed magnitude is higher, meaning the star appears dimmer than it actually is. So, the spectrograph's detection limit is based on the observed magnitude.

So, for Star3, the apparent magnitude is 15.5, but after correcting for extinction, the observed m would be higher. Wait, no, I think that the apparent magnitude given (15.5) is what is observed. So, including extinction. Because in astronomy, when you measure an apparent magnitude, you're measuring it through the dust, so the extinction is already accounted for.

Wait, but sometimes data might give the "intrinsic" magnitude, and you have to correct for extinction to find the observed. But the way the question is phrased, Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5. So, perhaps that's before extinction. Or is it after?

Wait, the question says, "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag". So, that's m. But then, E(B-V) is given as 0.6. So, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the observed (including extinction), and the E(B-V) is the color excess. In that case, the extinction in V band is Av = 3.1 * E(B-V) = 1.86 mag. So, the intrinsic apparent magnitude (without extinction) would be m_intrinsic = m_observed - Av = 15.5 -1.86 = 13.64 mag.

Wait, but now I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The star's light is absorbed by dust, so when we observe it, it's dimmer. So, the observed apparent magnitude is higher than the intrinsic (without dust) magnitude. So, m_observed = m_intrinsic + Av.

So, if the question gives Star3's apparent magnitude as 15.5, and E(B-V)=0.6 (so Av=1.86), then the intrinsic m is 15.5 -1.86 =13.64. So, without extinction, the star would appear at 13.64 mag. But wait, that's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the 15.5 mag is the observed magnitude, which is after extinction. So, the intrinsic (absolute) magnitude is M, and the apparent magnitude (m) would be M + distance modulus + Av.

Wait, no. Absolute magnitude is a measure of the star's intrinsic brightness, while apparent magnitude is what we observe, which includes distance and extinction.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me reorganize.

The formula for apparent magnitude (including extinction) is:

m = M + 5 log10(d/10) + Av

Where:
- M is absolute magnitude
- d is distance in parsecs
- Av is the extinction in V band (which is 3.1 * E(B-V))

So, for Star3:

M is not given. Wait, wait, looking back: Star3 has apparent V magnitude of 15.5, E(B-V)=0.6. So, m observed is 15.5. So, perhaps the formula is:

15.5 = M + 5 log10(15/10) + Av.

Wait, but that would require knowing M. Alternatively, perhaps Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but considering extinction, what is the intrinsic apparent magnitude?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see what the question is asking. It's asking which stars can be detected by both spectrographs. So, I need to find which stars have apparent V magnitudes ≤16 (since HIRES can't go beyond 16) and ≤17 (ESPRESSO can go up to 17). So, the overlapping is ≤16.

But to find the apparent magnitude observed, which includes extinction, we have to correct for Av. Because the spectrograph's limit is based on the observed apparent magnitude.

So, for Star3, if the apparent magnitude is 15.5, but after extinction, m_observed is higher. Wait, no, I think the given 15.5 is the observed m, including extinction. So, perhaps the star's actual m (without extinction) would be 15.5 minus Av.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the given apparent magnitude is the true m, and I have to calculate the observed m by adding Av.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is as follows:

When a star has some interstellar extinction (Av), the observed apparent magnitude is m_obs = m_true + Av.

So, if the question gives the star's apparent magnitude as m_true, then m_obs = m_true + Av.

But in the case of Star3, the question gives "apparent V magnitude of 15.5", but then gives E(B-V)=0.6. So, perhaps the 15.5 is the observed magnitude, and the extinction is causing it to be dimmer. Alternatively, perhaps the 15.5 is the true apparent magnitude, and the extinction makes it dimmer.

Wait, this is getting really complicated. Let me try to find another approach.

Another approach: for each star, calculate the apparent V magnitude, considering any extinction, and then check if m ≤16 (for both spectrographs).

Let's go through each star:

Star1: Absolute V mag 15.5, distance 10 pc.

m = M + 5 log(d/10) → 15.5 + 5 log(10/10) =15.5 +0=15.5.

No extinction mentioned, so m=15.5. So, it's within both's limits (since 15.5 ≤16).

Star2: apparent V mag 16.5, no E(B-V) given, so no extinction. So, m=16.5. HIRES can't detect (needs m ≤16), so Star2 can't be detected by HIRES.

Star3: apparent V mag 15.5 (but wait, this is the observed m?), E(B-V)=0.6.

Wait, but in the data, Star3's apparent V magnitude is 15.5, but E(B-V) is 0.6, implying extinction. So, perhaps the 15.5 is the true apparent magnitude, and the observed m is higher.

Wait, no. If E(B-V) is given, and the star is affected by extinction, the observed m is higher. So, Star3's observed m would be 15.5 + Av.

Av =3.1 * 0.6=1.86.

So, m_obs =15.5 +1.86=17.36. That's higher than 17. So, it's beyond ESPRESSO's limit (which is V ≤17). So, Star3 can't be detected by either spectrograph.

Wait, but that can't be right, because Star3's m_obs would be 17.36, which is beyond both limits. So, Star3 can't be detected by either.

But wait, perhaps the given apparent magnitude already accounts for extinction. If the 15.5 is the observed magnitude, then the extinction is already included. So, m_obs=15.5. Then, since 15.5 ≤16, it can be detected by both.

But the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing. Star3's description says "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag".

In standard terms, the observed apparent magnitude would be higher than the intrinsic (without extinction) magnitude. So, perhaps the 15.5 is the intrinsic apparent magnitude, and the observed m is 15.5 +1.86=17.36.

But that would make it too faint for both.

But wait, maybe the opposite: the given apparent magnitude is the observed (including extinction), so to find the intrinsic m, it's 15.5 -1.86=13.64. But that doesn't affect the detection, because detection is based on observed m.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think: the question is about whether the star's apparent magnitude (as observed) is ≤17 (for ESPRESSO) and ≤16 (for HIRES). So, if Star3's apparent V is 15.5, and that's the observed (meaning it's already been corrected for extinction), then m=15.5 is within both's limits.

But if the 15.5 is the intrinsic (without extinction) apparent magnitude, then the observed would be 17.36, which is too faint for both.

So, what's the correct approach here?

I think the key is to determine whether the given apparent magnitude (m) includes the effect of extinction (Av) or not. If the given m is the observed (which includes Av), then we don't need to adjust it. If the given m is the true (without Av), then we have to add Av to get the observed m.

In the question, Star3's data includes E(B-V), so it's likely that the given m is the true (intrinsic) value, and we need to calculate the observed m by adding Av.

But let me see: the way the question is phrased for Star3 is:

"apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us."

Hmm, but E(B-V) is a measure of extinction. So, the apparent magnitude given is before extinction is applied. Or is it after?

Wait, perhaps the apparent magnitude given is the observed, which includes extinction. Because the apparent magnitude is what you measure. So, if the star's light is dimmed by extinction, the observed m is higher. So, if the given m is 15.5, that's the observed. So, no need to adjust.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because then the E(B-V) wouldn't affect anything. So, perhaps the given m is the intrinsic, and we need to calculate the observed by adding Av.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to calculate the observed m for Star3 and Star4, considering extinction.

Let me proceed:

Star3:

Given:
- M = 15.5 (but wait, no, Star3's absolute magnitude might not be given. Wait, Star3's data: "apparent V magnitude of 15.5 mag, E(B-V) = 0.6 mag and located at 15 pc distance from us."

Wait, so Star3's data:

- Apparent V mag, m =15.5 (without extinction? Or including?)

But E(B-V)=0.6, which affects the V band as Av=3.1*0.6=1.86.

So, if the given m is the observed m, then the star's true brightness is m - Av =15.5 -1.86 =13.64. But that doesn't matter for the detection because detection is based on observed m.

Wait, but the question is about which stars can be detected. So, if Star3's observed m is 15.5 (which is including extinction), then it's within both's limits.

Alternatively, perhaps the given m is the true (without extinction), so the observed m is 15.5+1.86=17.36, which is too faint for both.

But how can that be? Because Star3's apparent magnitude is 15.5, but with that extinction, the observed is 17.36, which is beyond both's limits.

Wait, but that would mean Star3 can't be detected by either, which would affect the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the given m is the true (without extinction), and I have to calculate the observed m.

So, for Star3:

m_obs = m_true + Av.

m_true =15.5.

Av=1.86.

m_obs=15.5 +1.86=17.36.

Which is above both limits. So, Star3 can't be detected by either.

But wait, Star3's distance is 15 pc, which might affect its m. Wait, no. Because absolute magnitude is M, and m is calculated from M and distance. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused between absolute and apparent magnitudes.

Wait, Star3's absolute magnitude isn't given. Wait, no, the data for Star3 is:

- RA = 11h, DEC=48 deg.

- apparent V mag=15.5.

- E(B-V)=0.6.

- distance=15 pc.

So, perhaps to calculate the true apparent magnitude, I can use the distance modulus formula, but also include extinction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here, but perhaps I should proceed to the other stars and see.

Star4:

- Absolute V mag=15.5.

- E(B-V)=0.4.

- Distance=10 pc.

So, first, compute the apparent magnitude without extinction.

m = M +5 log(d/10) =15.5 +5 log(10/10)=15.5 +0=15.5.

Now, add extinction. Av=3.1 *0.4=1.24.

So, the observed m =15.5 +1.24=16.74 mag.

Which is above both limits. Because HIRES requires m ≤16, and ESPRESSO requires m ≤17.

So, m=16.74 is above 17? No, 16.74 is less than 17. So, 16.74 is below 17. So, ESPRESSO can detect it (since m <17), but HIRES requires m <16, which is not the case. So, Star4 can be detected by ESPRESSO but not HIRES.

Star5:

- Absolute V mag=16.5.

- Distance=5 pc.

So, compute apparent magnitude without extinction.

m = M +5 log(d/10) =16.5 +5 log(5/10)=16.5 +5 log(0.5)=16.5 +5*(-0.3010)=16.5 -1.505=14.995 ≈15.0 mag.

Assume no extinction (since E(B-V) isn't given), so m=15.0.

Which is ≤16, so detectable by both.

So, Star5's m is about 15.0, which is within both's limits.

Wait, but wait, the question says Star5 has E(B-V) =0.4 mag? No, wait, looking back: Star5's description: "absolute V magnitude of 16.5 mag and located at 5 pc distance from us." So, no E(B-V) given. So, no extinction.

So, m=15.0, which is within both.

So, now, let's summarize each star's m_obs (apparent magnitude including extinction, if applicable):

Star1: m=15.5 (no extinction) → detectable by both.

Star2: m=16.5 → detectable by ESPRESSO only.

Star3: If the given m is the observed (including extinction), then m=15.5 → detectable by both. Else, if it's the intrinsic, then m_obs=17.36 → detectable by neither.

Star4: m_obs=16.74 → detectable by ESPRESSO only.

Star5: m=15.0 → detectable by both.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Star4 and Star5. Star4 can be detected by ESPRESSO only. Star5 can be detected by both. So, this option includes Star5, which is correct, but Star4 is only detectable by ESPRESSO. So, the two stars in option A can't both be detected by both spectrographs.

Option B: Star3 and Star5. If Star3's m_obs=15.5, then both can be detected. But earlier analysis is conflicting. If given m is observed, then Star3 is detectable by both. So, Star3 and Star5 would both be detectable by both. But no, Star5 is detectable by both, Star3's m is 15.5, which is ≤16, so detectable by both. So option B could be correct if Star3 is detectable.

Option C: Star2 and Star3. Star2's m=16.5 → detectable by ESPRESSO only. Star3, if m_obs=15.5, detectable by both. So, only Star3 is detectable by both, Star2 only by ESPRESSO. So, no.

Option D: Star1 and Star4. Star1 is detectable by both. Star4 is detectable only by ESPRESSO. So, only Star1 is correct.

Wait, but earlier analysis of Star4: m_obs=16.74. Which is brighter than 16.74 >16 → HIRES can't detect (since needs m ≤16). So, Star4 can't be detected by HIRES.

So, which stars can be detected by both:

Star1: yes.

Star3: depends on whether the given m is observed or not. If the given m includes extinction, then yes. If not, then m_obs is 17.36 → no.

Star5: yes.

So, which of the options include both Star1 and Star5? Let's check the options:

Looking at the options:

Option A: Star4 and Star5 → Star4 isn't detected by both.

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → depends on Star3.

Option D: Star1 and Star4 → Star4 isn't detected by both.

Wait, the correct stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3 (if m_obs=15.5), and Star5.

But looking at the options, none of them include all three. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is about whether Star3's m includes extinction. Let me think again.

The question says Star3 has apparent V magnitude of 15.5. So, that's the observed m. Because in astronomy, when someone gives you the apparent magnitude, it's what you observe, which includes extinction and distance.

So, for Star3, m_obs=15.5. So, it's within both's limits. So, Star3 can be detected by both.

Similarly, Star1: m=15.5 → yes.

Star5: m=15.0 → yes.

So, the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

But looking at the options, which pairs are given?

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected by both. So, option B would be correct.

But wait, Star3's data includes E(B-V), which would affect the observed m. Wait, but if the given m is already the observed (after extinction), then the E(B-V) is extra information, perhaps for another purpose.

But in that case, for Star3, m_obs=15.5 → yes.

So, the stars that can be detected by both are Star1, Star3, and Star5.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Star3 and Star5 → yes.

So, the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but let me double-check each star:

- Star1: m=15.5 → detect by both → yes.

- Star3: m=15.5 → detect by both → yes.

- Star5: m=15.0 → detect by both → yes.

But the options don't include a trio, only pairs.

Wait, the options are:

A) Star4 and Star5 → Star4 can't be detected by both.

B) Star3 and Star5 → both can be detected.

C) Star2 and Star3 → Star2 can't be detected by both.

D) Star1 and Star4 → Star4 can't be detected by both.

So, the correct answer would be option B: Star3 and Star5 can be detected by both.

Wait, but what about Star1? It can also be detected by both. So, why isn't option D (Star1 and Star4) correct? Because Star4 can't be detected by both.

Wait, but if the question is which stars can be detected by both, Star1 is one, Star3 another, Star5 another. But since the options are pairs, the option that includes two correct stars would be B (Star3 and Star5) and possibly another pair.

Wait, but in the options, option B is the only one where both stars can be detected by both spectrographs.

So, the correct answer is option B.


To determine which stars can be detected by both the ESPRESSO spectrograph at Paranal and the HIRES spectrograph at Keck Observatory, we analyze the apparent V magnitudes of the stars and compare them to the detection limits of the two instruments. ESPRESSO can observe stars with apparent V magnitudes brighter than 17 mag (i.e., \( m \leq 17 \)), while HIRES can observe stars brighter than 16 mag (i.e., \( m \leq 16 \)). Therefore, a star must have \( m \leq 16 \) to be detectable by both spectrographs.

### Analysis of Each Star:

1. **Star1**:
   - Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \)
   - Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)
   - Apparent magnitude: \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5 \)
   - \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \), so Star1 can be detected by both spectrographs.

2. **Star2**:
   - Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 16.5 \)
   - \( m = 16.5 > 16 \), so Star2 cannot be detected by HIRES, but it can be detected by ESPRESSO.

3. **Star3**:
   - Apparent V magnitude: \( m = 15.5 \)
   - E(B-V): \( 0.6 \), so extinction in the V band: \( A_V = 3.1 \times 0.6 = 1.86 \)
   - The question does not explicitly state whether the given \( m = 15.5 \) includes extinction. If \( m = 15.5 \) is the observed magnitude (already accounting for extinction), then \( m = 15.5 \leq 16 \), and Star3 can be detected by both spectrographs. If \( m = 15.5 \) is the intrinsic magnitude (before extinction), the observed magnitude would be \( m_{\text{obs}} = 15.5 + 1.86 = 17.36 \), which is too faint for both spectrographs. However, the question likely assumes the given \( m \) is the observed magnitude, so Star3 can be detected by both spectrographs.

4. **Star4**:
   - Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 15.5 \)
   - Distance: \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \)
   - Apparent magnitude: \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 15.5 + 5 \log_{10}(10/10) = 15.5 \)
   - E(B-V): \( 0.4 \), so extinction in the V band: \( A_V = 3.1 \times 0.4 = 1.24 \)
   - Observed magnitude: \( m_{\text{obs}} = 15.5 + 1.24 = 16.74 \)
   - \( m_{\text{obs}} = 16.74 > 16 \), so Star4 cannot be detected by HIRES, but it can be detected by ESPRESSO.

5. **Star5**:
   - Absolute V magnitude: \( M = 16.5 \)
   - Distance: \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \)
   - Apparent magnitude: \( m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d/10) = 16.5 + 5 \log_{10}(5/10) = 16.5 - 1.5 = 15.0 \)
   - \( m = 15.0 \leq 16 \), so Star5 can be detected by both spectrographs.

### Conclusion:
- **Star1**: Detectable by both.
- **Star2**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.
- **Star3**: Detectable by both (assuming \( m = 15.5 \) is the observed magnitude).
- **Star4**: Detectable only by ESPRESSO.
- **Star5**: Detectable by both.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) Star4 and Star5**: Star4 is not detectable by both spectrographs, so this option is incorrect.
- **B) Star3 and Star5**: Both stars are detectable by both spectrographs, so this option is correct.
- **C) Star2 and Star3**: Star2 is not detectable by both spectrographs, so this option is incorrect.
- **D) Star1 and Star4**: Star4 is not detectable by both spectrographs, so this option is incorrect.

**Correct Answer**: B
