Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The problem says that there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. Their orbits are circular, and they were discovered using the TTV method. I remember TTV stands for Transit Timing Variations, which is a method used to detect exoplanets by observing changes in the timing of a planet's transit as it passes in front of its star. But I'm not entirely sure how that affects the problem here, maybe it's just background info.

The key data given is about the equilibrium temperatures and the mass ratios between the planets. So, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. That means Planet2 is hotter than Planet1 by that factor. Then, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3, so Planet3 is even hotter than Planet2. Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh, right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ (L*(1 - a) ) / (16 * π² * D² * σ) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the distance from the star, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But wait, the problem says the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3, which is the same as Earth's. So a is the same for all three. So the equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets would depend on the distance from the star. Because L is the same for all planets (assuming they orbit the same star), the temperature ratio squared would be inversely proportional to the square of the distance ratio. Wait, because T is proportional to (L/(16π²σ D²))^(1/4), so T is proportional to 1/ D^(1/2). So if T1 is the temperature of Planet1, T2 of Planet2, then T2/T1 = sqrt( D1/D2 ). Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). So if T2 is 1.4 times T1, then (T2/T1)^2 = D1/D2. Wait, let me think again.

The formula: T = (L/(16π²σ D²(1 - a)))^(1/4) → T^4 ∝ L/(D²). Since L and (1 - a) are the same for all, T^4 ∝ 1/D² → T ∝ 1/(D^(1/2)). So the ratio T2/T1 = (D1/D2)^(1/2). So:

T2/T1 = sqrt(D1/D2)
=> (T2/T1)^2 = D1/D2
So D1/D2 = (T2/T1)^2

Wait, no, wait. Let me do it step by step. Let's consider two planets, 1 and 2.

T1 = [ L (1 - a) / (16 π² D1² σ) ]^(1/4)
T2 = [ L (1 - a) / (16 π² D2² σ) ]^(1/4)

Divide T2 by T1:

T2/T1 = [ (D1^2) / (D2^2) ]^(1/4)
= (D1/D2)^(1/2)

So square both sides: (T2/T1)^2 = D1/D2.

So D1 = D2 * (T2/T1)^2.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). So if Planet2 is hotter than Planet1, then Planet2 must be closer to the star. So the ratio T2/T1 is greater than 1, which implies D2 < D1. So if D1 is the distance of Planet1, D2 is less than D1. So D1 = D2 * (T2/T1)^2.

But in the problem, the ratio T1/T2 is 1/1.4, but the given ratio is T2/T1 ≈1.4. So D1 = D2*(1.4)^2. So D1 is about 1.96 times D2.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. If Planet2 is hotter, it must be closer to the star. So D2 < D1. So D1 is larger. So from T2/T1 = sqrt(D1/D2), which would be greater than 1, so D1 must be larger than D2. Wait, no, wait. Because if D2 is smaller, the denominator is smaller, so sqrt(D1/D2) is greater than 1, which makes T2/T1 greater than 1. That's correct.

So, for the first ratio, T2/T1 = 1.4 → (T2/T1)^2 = (1.4)^2 ≈1.96. So D1/D2 =1.96 → D1 =1.96 D2.

So Planet1 is about 1.96 times farther from the star than Planet2.

Wait, but wait, the problem says T1 and T2's ratio is 1.4. Let me make sure: the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So is that T1/T2=1.4 or T2/T1=1.4? The wording says, "the ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4" — so I think it's T2/T1=1.4, because the question is about the ratio between them. So what's the exact wording? It says, "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." Hmm, this is ambiguous. It could be T1/T2 or T2/T1. Let me think about the problem again.

Wait, in the problem, the ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So for the first case: Planet1 to Planet2, the ratio is 1.4. So if it's T1/T2=1.4, that would mean Planet1 is hotter, so it's closer to the star. But that can't be right because Planet2 would have a longer period if it's farther. But I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, if the ratio is T2/T1=1.4, then Planet2 is hotter, meaning it's closer.

Wait, the problem says "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2." So I think that refers to T2 / T1 =1.4. Because when you say the ratio between A and B, I think it's A/B. So T2/T1=1.4.

So with that, the first step is to find the distances between the planets. Let me write down the data:

T ratios:

T2 / T1 = 1.4 → (T2/T1)^2 = (1.4)^2 =1.96 → D1 = D2 * (T2/T1)^2 → D1 = D2 *1.96

Similarly, T3 / T2 =2.3 → (T3/T2)^2= (2.3)^2≈5.29 → D2 = D3 * (T3/T2)^2 → D2 = D3 *5.29.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The formula says (T2/T1)^2 = D1/D2 → D1 = D2 * (T2/T1)^2.

Similarly, (T3/T2)^2 = D2/D3 → D2 = D3 * (T3/T2)^2.

Wait, no. Let me make sure. For Planet2 and Planet3: T2 and T3. So the ratio T3 / T2 =2.3.

Using the same formula as before: (T3/T2)^2 = D2/D3 → D3 = D2 * (T3/T2)^(-2) = D2 / (T3/T2)^2.

Wait, because if T3 is hotter than T2, then D3 must be smaller than D2. Because Planet3 is hotter, so it's closer to the star. So D3 < D2.

So, D3 = D2 / ( (T3/T2)^2 )

Which is D3 = D2 / (5.29) ≈ D2 * 0.189.

So putting it together, let's express all distances in terms of D1.

We have D1 =1.96 D2.

And D2 =5.29 D3 → Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, for the second ratio (T3/T2)=2.3, which implies (T3/T2)^2 = D2/D3 → D3 = D2 / (T3/T2)^2 → D3 = D2 /5.29 ≈ D2 * 0.189.

So, D3 = D2 * 0.189.

Now, D1 =1.96 D2.

But we also have D2 in terms of D3: D2 =5.29 D3 → D2 =5.29 * D3.

Wait, no: D3 = D2 /5.29 → D2 =5.29 * D3.

So substitute D2 into D1:

D1 =1.96 * D2 → D1 =1.96 *5.29 * D3 → Let's compute 1.96 *5.29.

1.96 *5 =9.8, 1.96 *0.29≈0.5684 → total ≈10.3684 → Approximately 10.37.

So D1 =10.37 D3.

So the distance of Planet1 is about 10.37 times the distance of Planet3.

Wait, no, wait: D3 is the distance of Planet3. So D1 is 10.37 times D3. So D1 is much farther than D3.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem is asking about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. So we need to find the factor by which Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's.

Wait, no, wait. Orbital period is longer when the planet is farther from the star because of Kepler's third law. So, the planet that's farther has a longer period.

So, the further away the planet, the longer the period.

So, since D1 is 10.37 times D3, Planet1 is much farther away, so its orbital period is longer. But the question is asking by what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If Planet1 is farther, its period is longer. So Planet3's period would be shorter. But the options are all numbers greater than 1, so maybe I made a mistake in the ratios.

Wait, perhaps I got the direction wrong. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, the question says, "By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1."

Ah, so the question is, P3 / P1 = ?

If Planet3 is farther, then P3 would be larger than P1. But based on our earlier calculation, D1 is 10.37 D3, so Planet1 is farther, so P1 should be larger than P3. Then, P3/P1 would be less than 1, but all options are greater than 1. Hmm, that suggests I must have messed up the ratios.

Wait, let me go back. Maybe I got the temperature ratios backward.

The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So which is hotter? If it's T1/T2=1.4, then Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, so Planet1 is closer to the star. Because hotter planets are closer. So then, D1 < D2.

But earlier I assumed T2/T1=1.4, which would mean D1 is larger than D2.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is T1/T2=1.4. So let's reevaluate.

If T1/T2=1.4, then using the same formula:

(T1/T2)^2 = D2/D1 → D2 = D1 * (T1/T2)^2.

So T1 is hotter, so it's closer. So D1 < D2 → Planet1 is closer than Planet2.

Then, for the second ratio, T2/T3=2.3. So T2 is hotter than Planet3. So Planet2 is closer than Planet3: D2 < D3.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if Planet2 is hotter than Planet3, D2 is smaller than D3. So Planet3 is farther than Planet2. So the order of distances is D1 < D2 < D3? No, wait, because Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 (T1=1.4 T2), so D1 (distance of Planet1) is smaller than D2.

Wait, I'm getting tangled here. Let's make a table.

Case 1: T2/T1=1.4 → Planet2 hotter → closer → D2 < D1.

Case 2: T3/T2=2.3 → Planet3 hotter → closer → D3 < D2.

So the distances would be: D3 < D2 < D1.

So Planet1 is the farthest, Planet3 the closest.

So, for Kepler's law, the period depends on distance.

Kepler's third law states that P^2 ∝ D^3 / M, where M is the mass of the star. But wait, in this problem, the planets' masses are given, but the star's mass isn't. Hmm, but the problem says the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, 1.35. So M2 =1.15 M1, M3=1.35 M2= 1.35*1.15 M1=1.5525 M1.

But wait, Kepler's third law is about the star's mass, not the planet's. So the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star, so the period depends only on the star's mass and the planet's distance.

So, the formula is P^2 = (4π²/G M_star) * D^3.

So P is proportional to sqrt( D^3 / M ), assuming M is the star's mass.

But since we don't know the star's mass, perhaps we can relate the periods of the planets using their distances.

Because we can write P1^2/P3^2 = (D1^3)/(D3^3).

So (P1/P3)^2 = (D1/D3)^3 → (P3/P1)^2 = (D3/D1)^3 → P3/P1 = sqrt( (D3/D1)^3 )

So if we can find D3/D1, we can find the ratio of periods.

Earlier, I tried to find D1 and D3 in terms of each other.

Wait, let's correct the earlier approach.

We have:

From T2/T1=1.4 → (T2/T1)^2 = D1/D2 → D1 = D2*(1.4)^2 = D2 *1.96.

From T3/T2=2.3 → (T3/T2)^2 = D2/D3 → D3 = D2/(2.3)^2 = D2/5.29 ≈0.1897 D2.

So D3 =0.1897 D2.

But D2 = D1 /1.96.

So D3 = 0.1897 * (D1 /1.96) → D3 = D1 * (0.1897 /1.96) → 0.1897 ÷1.96 ≈0.0968.

So D3 ≈0.0968 D1.

So D3/D1 ≈0.0968.

Now, let's compute (D3/D1)^3 → (0.0968)^3 ≈(approx 0.0968 is ~0.097) → 0.097^3= approx 0.0009126.

Then (D3/D1)^3 ≈ 0.0009126.

So (P3/P1)^2 = 0.0009126 → P3/P1 = sqrt(0.0009126) → approx 0.0302.

Wait, that would imply P3 is about 3% of P1. But the options given are all much larger than 1. So this can't be right. Because according to this, Planet3's period is shorter than Planet1's, which would make the factor P3/P1 <1, but the options are all >1.

Wait, that's a problem. But according to the question, the ratio is T2/T1=1.4, so Planet2 is hotter, so closer. Then, T3/T2=2.3 → Planet3 is even hotter, so even closer. So D3 < D2 < D1. So Planet3 is the closest, Planet1 the farthest. So Planet3 has a shorter orbital period than Planet1. So P3 is less than P1. So P3/P1 would be less than 1. But the options are all greater than 1, which suggests I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the mass ratios affect the orbital period. Because Kepler's law includes the sum of the masses, but in reality, for exoplanets, the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star. So the period depends only on the star's mass and the orbital distance. But the problem says the masses between the planets are given, but we don't know the star's mass. So perhaps the mass ratios are a red herring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem does mention the masses between the planets. The ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15. So M2=1.15 M1. Similarly, M3=1.35 M2=1.35 *1.15=1.5525 M1.

But I thought that the planet's mass doesn't significantly affect the orbital period because the star's mass is much larger. So perhaps the mass ratios are irrelevant here. Unless the problem is considering the Hill sphere or something else, but I don't think so.

So perhaps the mass data is a distraction. So I should proceed with the distance ratios and Kepler's law.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, P3/P1 = sqrt( (D3/D1)^3 ) )= sqrt( (0.0968)^3 )= sqrt( around 0.0009126 )= ~0.0302. So P3 is about 3% of P1. So P3 is much shorter than P1. So the factor by which P3 is larger than P1 is 0.0302, but that's less than 1, which isn't any of the options.

Hmm, but the options are all greater than 1. So perhaps I messed up the temperature ratios.

Wait, maybe I have the temperature ratios inverted. Let me try the other way.

Suppose the problem says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is T1/T2=1.4. So Planet1 is hotter, so closer. Then, T2/T3=2.3, so Planet2 is hotter than Planet3, so Planet2 is closer.

Wait, but if Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, and Planet2 is hotter than Planet3, then the distances would be D1 < D2 < D3. Because the closer a planet is, the hotter it is.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, then Planet1 is closer. If Planet2 is hotter than Planet3, Planet2 is closer, so Planet3 is farther than Planet2. So D1 < D2 < D3. So Planet3 is the farthest, so has the longest period.

Wait, that makes sense. Because each next planet is hotter than the one after it, so each is closer than the next. So D1 < D2 < D3.

So then, let's recalculate with this scenario.

From T1/T2=1.4 → (T1/T2)^2 = D2/D1 → D2 = D1 * (T1/T2)^2 = D1 * (1.4)^2= D1 *1.96.

Similarly, T2/T3=2.3 → (T2/T3)^2 = D3/D2 → D3= D2*(T2/T3)^2= D2*(2.3)^2= D2 *5.29.

So D3 = D2 *5.29.

But D2=1.96 D1 → D3=1.96 D1 *5.29 → Let's compute 1.96 *5.29.

1.96 *5 =9.8, 1.96 *0.29≈0.5684 → total ≈10.3684.

So D3=10.3684 D1.

So now, the distance of Planet3 is about 10.37 times that of Planet1.

Now, applying Kepler's third law: P^2 ∝ D^3. So P3^2 / P1^2 = (D3/D1)^3.

So (P3/P1)^2 = (10.3684)^3 → (10.3684)^3 is approximately 10^3=1000, but let's calculate more precisely.

10.3684^3 = (10.3684)^3.

Let me compute 10^3=1000, 10.3684 is about 10.368.

So 10.368^3 = (10 + 0.368)^3.

Using binomial expansion:

=10^3 + 3*(10^2)*(0.368) + 3*(10)*(0.368)^2 + (0.368)^3.

=1000 + 3*100*0.368 + 3*10*(0.135424) + 0.04998.

=1000 + 110.4 + 4.06272 + 0.04998.

Adding them up: 1000 +110.4=1110.4; +4.06272=1114.46272; +0.04998≈1114.5127.

So approximately 1114.51.

So (P3/P1)^2=1114.51 → P3/P1= sqrt(1114.51) → sqrt(1114.51) is about 33.38, so approximately 33.4.

So the orbital period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times longer than that of Planet1.

Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4.

So the answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply Kepler's third law. The equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets depends on their distances from the star, as the equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance \( D \) from the star. The relationship is given by:

\[
T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}}
\]

### Step 1: Relating Temperature Ratios to Distances
The problem provides the following temperature ratios:
1. \( \frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1.4 \)
2. \( \frac{T_3}{T_2} = 2.3 \)

Using the proportionality \( T^2 \propto \frac{1}{D} \), we can relate the temperature ratios to the distance ratios:
1. \( \left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^2 = \frac{D_1}{D_2} \implies D_1 = D_2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^2 = D_2 \cdot (1.4)^2 = D_2 \cdot 1.96 \)
2. \( \left(\frac{T_3}{T_2}\right)^2 = \frac{D_2}{D_3} \implies D_3 = D_2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_3}{T_2}\right)^{-2} = D_2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2.3}\right)^2 = D_2 \cdot \frac{1}{5.29} \approx D_2 \cdot 0.1897 \)

Substituting \( D_2 = \frac{D_1}{1.96} \) into the expression for \( D_3 \):
\[
D_3 = \frac{D_1}{1.96} \cdot 0.1897 \approx D_1 \cdot \frac{0.1897}{1.96} \approx D_1 \cdot 0.0968
\]

Thus, the distance of Planet3 is approximately \( D_3 \approx 0.0968 \cdot D_1 \).

### Step 2: Applying Kepler's Third Law
Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance \( D \):
\[
P^2 \propto D^3
\]

Taking the ratio of the periods:
\[
\left(\frac{P_3}{P_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( \frac{D_3}{D_1} \approx 0.0968 \):
\[
\left(\frac{P_3}{P_1}\right)^2 = (0.0968)^3 \approx 0.000912
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} \approx \sqrt{0.000912} \approx 0.0302
\]

This result implies that Planet3's orbital period is much shorter than Planet1's, which contradicts the given options (all greater than 1). To resolve this, we re-evaluate the temperature ratios and distances.

### Step 3: Correcting the Temperature Ratios
If the temperature ratios are inverted (\( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \) and \( \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \)), the distances would instead follow:
1. \( D_1 < D_2 < D_3 \), meaning Planet3 is the farthest.
2. Recalculating the distances:
   - \( D_2 = D_1 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^2 = D_1 \cdot (1.4)^2 = D_1 \cdot 1.96 \)
   - \( D_3 = D_2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_2}{T_3}\right)^2 = D_2 \cdot (2.3)^2 = D_2 \cdot 5.29 \)

Substituting \( D_2 = 1.96 \cdot D_1 \):
\[
D_3 = 1.96 \cdot D_1 \cdot 5.29 \approx 10.37 \cdot D_1
\]

Thus, \( D_3 \approx 10.37 \cdot D_1 \).

### Step 4: Recalculating the Period Ratio
Using Kepler's law again:
\[
\left(\frac{P_3}{P_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^3 = (10.37)^3 \approx 1114.5
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} \approx \sqrt{1114.5} \approx 33.4
\]

### Final Answer
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. 

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I'm trying to solve this astronomy problem about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The problem says that there are three exoplanets: Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. Their orbits are circular, and they were discovered using the TTV method. I remember TTV stands for Transit Timing Variations, which is a method used to detect exoplanets by observing changes in the timing of a planet's transit as it passes in front of its star. But I'm not entirely sure how that affects the problem here, maybe it's just background info.

The key data given is about the equilibrium temperatures and the mass ratios between the planets. So, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. That means Planet2 is hotter than Planet1 by that factor. Then, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3, so Planet3 is even hotter than Planet2. Wait, equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo. Oh, right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = [ (L*(1 - a) ) / (16 * π² * D² * σ) ]^(1/4), where L is the star's luminosity, a is albedo, D is the distance from the star, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

But wait, the problem says the albedo for all three planets is equal to 0.3, which is the same as Earth's. So a is the same for all three. So the equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets would depend on the distance from the star. Because L is the same for all planets (assuming they orbit the same star), the temperature ratio squared would be inversely proportional to the square of the distance ratio. Wait, because T is proportional to (L/(16π²σ D²))^(1/4), so T is proportional to 1/ D^(1/2). So if T1 is the temperature of Planet1, T2 of Planet2, then T2/T1 = sqrt( D1/D2 ). Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). So if T2 is 1.4 times T1, then (T2/T1)^2 = D1/D2. Wait, let me think again.

The formula: T = (L/(16π²σ D²(1 - a)))^(1/4) → T^4 ∝ L/(D²). Since L and (1 - a) are the same for all, T^4 ∝ 1/D² → T ∝ 1/(D^(1/2)). So the ratio T2/T1 = (D1/D2)^(1/2). So:

T2/T1 = sqrt(D1/D2)
=> (T2/T1)^2 = D1/D2
So D1/D2 = (T2/T1)^2

Wait, no, wait. Let me do it step by step. Let's consider two planets, 1 and 2.

T1 = [ L (1 - a) / (16 π² D1² σ) ]^(1/4)
T2 = [ L (1 - a) / (16 π² D2² σ) ]^(1/4)

Divide T2 by T1:

T2/T1 = [ (D1^2) / (D2^2) ]^(1/4)
= (D1/D2)^(1/2)

So square both sides: (T2/T1)^2 = D1/D2.

So D1 = D2 * (T2/T1)^2.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(D). So if Planet2 is hotter than Planet1, then Planet2 must be closer to the star. So the ratio T2/T1 is greater than 1, which implies D2 < D1. So if D1 is the distance of Planet1, D2 is less than D1. So D1 = D2 * (T2/T1)^2.

But in the problem, the ratio T1/T2 is 1/1.4, but the given ratio is T2/T1 ≈1.4. So D1 = D2*(1.4)^2. So D1 is about 1.96 times D2.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. If Planet2 is hotter, it must be closer to the star. So D2 < D1. So D1 is larger. So from T2/T1 = sqrt(D1/D2), which would be greater than 1, so D1 must be larger than D2. Wait, no, wait. Because if D2 is smaller, the denominator is smaller, so sqrt(D1/D2) is greater than 1, which makes T2/T1 greater than 1. That's correct.

So, for the first ratio, T2/T1 = 1.4 → (T2/T1)^2 = (1.4)^2 ≈1.96. So D1/D2 =1.96 → D1 =1.96 D2.

So Planet1 is about 1.96 times farther from the star than Planet2.

Wait, but wait, the problem says T1 and T2's ratio is 1.4. Let me make sure: the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So is that T1/T2=1.4 or T2/T1=1.4? The wording says, "the ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4" — so I think it's T2/T1=1.4, because the question is about the ratio between them. So what's the exact wording? It says, "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4." Hmm, this is ambiguous. It could be T1/T2 or T2/T1. Let me think about the problem again.

Wait, in the problem, the ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So for the first case: Planet1 to Planet2, the ratio is 1.4. So if it's T1/T2=1.4, that would mean Planet1 is hotter, so it's closer to the star. But that can't be right because Planet2 would have a longer period if it's farther. But I'm getting confused here. Alternatively, if the ratio is T2/T1=1.4, then Planet2 is hotter, meaning it's closer.

Wait, the problem says "the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2." So I think that refers to T2 / T1 =1.4. Because when you say the ratio between A and B, I think it's A/B. So T2/T1=1.4.

So with that, the first step is to find the distances between the planets. Let me write down the data:

T ratios:

T2 / T1 = 1.4 → (T2/T1)^2 = (1.4)^2 =1.96 → D1 = D2 * (T2/T1)^2 → D1 = D2 *1.96

Similarly, T3 / T2 =2.3 → (T3/T2)^2= (2.3)^2≈5.29 → D2 = D3 * (T3/T2)^2 → D2 = D3 *5.29.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The formula says (T2/T1)^2 = D1/D2 → D1 = D2 * (T2/T1)^2.

Similarly, (T3/T2)^2 = D2/D3 → D2 = D3 * (T3/T2)^2.

Wait, no. Let me make sure. For Planet2 and Planet3: T2 and T3. So the ratio T3 / T2 =2.3.

Using the same formula as before: (T3/T2)^2 = D2/D3 → D3 = D2 * (T3/T2)^(-2) = D2 / (T3/T2)^2.

Wait, because if T3 is hotter than T2, then D3 must be smaller than D2. Because Planet3 is hotter, so it's closer to the star. So D3 < D2.

So, D3 = D2 / ( (T3/T2)^2 )

Which is D3 = D2 / (5.29) ≈ D2 * 0.189.

So putting it together, let's express all distances in terms of D1.

We have D1 =1.96 D2.

And D2 =5.29 D3 → Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, for the second ratio (T3/T2)=2.3, which implies (T3/T2)^2 = D2/D3 → D3 = D2 / (T3/T2)^2 → D3 = D2 /5.29 ≈ D2 * 0.189.

So, D3 = D2 * 0.189.

Now, D1 =1.96 D2.

But we also have D2 in terms of D3: D2 =5.29 D3 → D2 =5.29 * D3.

Wait, no: D3 = D2 /5.29 → D2 =5.29 * D3.

So substitute D2 into D1:

D1 =1.96 * D2 → D1 =1.96 *5.29 * D3 → Let's compute 1.96 *5.29.

1.96 *5 =9.8, 1.96 *0.29≈0.5684 → total ≈10.3684 → Approximately 10.37.

So D1 =10.37 D3.

So the distance of Planet1 is about 10.37 times the distance of Planet3.

Wait, no, wait: D3 is the distance of Planet3. So D1 is 10.37 times D3. So D1 is much farther than D3.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem is asking about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. So we need to find the factor by which Planet3's orbital period is larger than Planet1's.

Wait, no, wait. Orbital period is longer when the planet is farther from the star because of Kepler's third law. So, the planet that's farther has a longer period.

So, the further away the planet, the longer the period.

So, since D1 is 10.37 times D3, Planet1 is much farther away, so its orbital period is longer. But the question is asking by what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If Planet1 is farther, its period is longer. So Planet3's period would be shorter. But the options are all numbers greater than 1, so maybe I made a mistake in the ratios.

Wait, perhaps I got the direction wrong. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, the question says, "By what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than that of Planet1."

Ah, so the question is, P3 / P1 = ?

If Planet3 is farther, then P3 would be larger than P1. But based on our earlier calculation, D1 is 10.37 D3, so Planet1 is farther, so P1 should be larger than P3. Then, P3/P1 would be less than 1, but all options are greater than 1. Hmm, that suggests I must have messed up the ratios.

Wait, let me go back. Maybe I got the temperature ratios backward.

The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.4. So which is hotter? If it's T1/T2=1.4, then Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, so Planet1 is closer to the star. Because hotter planets are closer. So then, D1 < D2.

But earlier I assumed T2/T1=1.4, which would mean D1 is larger than D2.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is T1/T2=1.4. So let's reevaluate.

If T1/T2=1.4, then using the same formula:

(T1/T2)^2 = D2/D1 → D2 = D1 * (T1/T2)^2.

So T1 is hotter, so it's closer. So D1 < D2 → Planet1 is closer than Planet2.

Then, for the second ratio, T2/T3=2.3. So T2 is hotter than Planet3. So Planet2 is closer than Planet3: D2 < D3.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if Planet2 is hotter than Planet3, D2 is smaller than D3. So Planet3 is farther than Planet2. So the order of distances is D1 < D2 < D3? No, wait, because Planet1 is hotter than Planet2 (T1=1.4 T2), so D1 (distance of Planet1) is smaller than D2.

Wait, I'm getting tangled here. Let's make a table.

Case 1: T2/T1=1.4 → Planet2 hotter → closer → D2 < D1.

Case 2: T3/T2=2.3 → Planet3 hotter → closer → D3 < D2.

So the distances would be: D3 < D2 < D1.

So Planet1 is the farthest, Planet3 the closest.

So, for Kepler's law, the period depends on distance.

Kepler's third law states that P^2 ∝ D^3 / M, where M is the mass of the star. But wait, in this problem, the planets' masses are given, but the star's mass isn't. Hmm, but the problem says the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15, and between Planet2 and Planet3, 1.35. So M2 =1.15 M1, M3=1.35 M2= 1.35*1.15 M1=1.5525 M1.

But wait, Kepler's third law is about the star's mass, not the planet's. So the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star, so the period depends only on the star's mass and the planet's distance.

So, the formula is P^2 = (4π²/G M_star) * D^3.

So P is proportional to sqrt( D^3 / M ), assuming M is the star's mass.

But since we don't know the star's mass, perhaps we can relate the periods of the planets using their distances.

Because we can write P1^2/P3^2 = (D1^3)/(D3^3).

So (P1/P3)^2 = (D1/D3)^3 → (P3/P1)^2 = (D3/D1)^3 → P3/P1 = sqrt( (D3/D1)^3 )

So if we can find D3/D1, we can find the ratio of periods.

Earlier, I tried to find D1 and D3 in terms of each other.

Wait, let's correct the earlier approach.

We have:

From T2/T1=1.4 → (T2/T1)^2 = D1/D2 → D1 = D2*(1.4)^2 = D2 *1.96.

From T3/T2=2.3 → (T3/T2)^2 = D2/D3 → D3 = D2/(2.3)^2 = D2/5.29 ≈0.1897 D2.

So D3 =0.1897 D2.

But D2 = D1 /1.96.

So D3 = 0.1897 * (D1 /1.96) → D3 = D1 * (0.1897 /1.96) → 0.1897 ÷1.96 ≈0.0968.

So D3 ≈0.0968 D1.

So D3/D1 ≈0.0968.

Now, let's compute (D3/D1)^3 → (0.0968)^3 ≈(approx 0.0968 is ~0.097) → 0.097^3= approx 0.0009126.

Then (D3/D1)^3 ≈ 0.0009126.

So (P3/P1)^2 = 0.0009126 → P3/P1 = sqrt(0.0009126) → approx 0.0302.

Wait, that would imply P3 is about 3% of P1. But the options given are all much larger than 1. So this can't be right. Because according to this, Planet3's period is shorter than Planet1's, which would make the factor P3/P1 <1, but the options are all >1.

Wait, that's a problem. But according to the question, the ratio is T2/T1=1.4, so Planet2 is hotter, so closer. Then, T3/T2=2.3 → Planet3 is even hotter, so even closer. So D3 < D2 < D1. So Planet3 is the closest, Planet1 the farthest. So Planet3 has a shorter orbital period than Planet1. So P3 is less than P1. So P3/P1 would be less than 1. But the options are all greater than 1, which suggests I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the mass ratios affect the orbital period. Because Kepler's law includes the sum of the masses, but in reality, for exoplanets, the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star. So the period depends only on the star's mass and the orbital distance. But the problem says the masses between the planets are given, but we don't know the star's mass. So perhaps the mass ratios are a red herring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem does mention the masses between the planets. The ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15. So M2=1.15 M1. Similarly, M3=1.35 M2=1.35 *1.15=1.5525 M1.

But I thought that the planet's mass doesn't significantly affect the orbital period because the star's mass is much larger. So perhaps the mass ratios are irrelevant here. Unless the problem is considering the Hill sphere or something else, but I don't think so.

So perhaps the mass data is a distraction. So I should proceed with the distance ratios and Kepler's law.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculation, P3/P1 = sqrt( (D3/D1)^3 ) )= sqrt( (0.0968)^3 )= sqrt( around 0.0009126 )= ~0.0302. So P3 is about 3% of P1. So P3 is much shorter than P1. So the factor by which P3 is larger than P1 is 0.0302, but that's less than 1, which isn't any of the options.

Hmm, but the options are all greater than 1. So perhaps I messed up the temperature ratios.

Wait, maybe I have the temperature ratios inverted. Let me try the other way.

Suppose the problem says the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is T1/T2=1.4. So Planet1 is hotter, so closer. Then, T2/T3=2.3, so Planet2 is hotter than Planet3, so Planet2 is closer.

Wait, but if Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, and Planet2 is hotter than Planet3, then the distances would be D1 < D2 < D3. Because the closer a planet is, the hotter it is.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if Planet1 is hotter than Planet2, then Planet1 is closer. If Planet2 is hotter than Planet3, Planet2 is closer, so Planet3 is farther than Planet2. So D1 < D2 < D3. So Planet3 is the farthest, so has the longest period.

Wait, that makes sense. Because each next planet is hotter than the one after it, so each is closer than the next. So D1 < D2 < D3.

So then, let's recalculate with this scenario.

From T1/T2=1.4 → (T1/T2)^2 = D2/D1 → D2 = D1 * (T1/T2)^2 = D1 * (1.4)^2= D1 *1.96.

Similarly, T2/T3=2.3 → (T2/T3)^2 = D3/D2 → D3= D2*(T2/T3)^2= D2*(2.3)^2= D2 *5.29.

So D3 = D2 *5.29.

But D2=1.96 D1 → D3=1.96 D1 *5.29 → Let's compute 1.96 *5.29.

1.96 *5 =9.8, 1.96 *0.29≈0.5684 → total ≈10.3684.

So D3=10.3684 D1.

So now, the distance of Planet3 is about 10.37 times that of Planet1.

Now, applying Kepler's third law: P^2 ∝ D^3. So P3^2 / P1^2 = (D3/D1)^3.

So (P3/P1)^2 = (10.3684)^3 → (10.3684)^3 is approximately 10^3=1000, but let's calculate more precisely.

10.3684^3 = (10.3684)^3.

Let me compute 10^3=1000, 10.3684 is about 10.368.

So 10.368^3 = (10 + 0.368)^3.

Using binomial expansion:

=10^3 + 3*(10^2)*(0.368) + 3*(10)*(0.368)^2 + (0.368)^3.

=1000 + 3*100*0.368 + 3*10*(0.135424) + 0.04998.

=1000 + 110.4 + 4.06272 + 0.04998.

Adding them up: 1000 +110.4=1110.4; +4.06272=1114.46272; +0.04998≈1114.5127.

So approximately 1114.51.

So (P3/P1)^2=1114.51 → P3/P1= sqrt(1114.51) → sqrt(1114.51) is about 33.38, so approximately 33.4.

So the orbital period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times longer than that of Planet1.

Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4.

So the answer should be D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply Kepler's third law. The equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets depends on their distances from the star, as the equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance \( D \) from the star. The relationship is given by:

\[
T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{D}}
\]

### Step 1: Relating Temperature Ratios to Distances
The problem provides the following temperature ratios:
1. \( \frac{T_2}{T_1} = 1.4 \)
2. \( \frac{T_3}{T_2} = 2.3 \)

Using the proportionality \( T^2 \propto \frac{1}{D} \), we can relate the temperature ratios to the distance ratios:
1. \( \left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^2 = \frac{D_1}{D_2} \implies D_1 = D_2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right)^2 = D_2 \cdot (1.4)^2 = D_2 \cdot 1.96 \)
2. \( \left(\frac{T_3}{T_2}\right)^2 = \frac{D_2}{D_3} \implies D_3 = D_2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_3}{T_2}\right)^{-2} = D_2 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2.3}\right)^2 = D_2 \cdot \frac{1}{5.29} \approx D_2 \cdot 0.1897 \)

Substituting \( D_2 = \frac{D_1}{1.96} \) into the expression for \( D_3 \):
\[
D_3 = \frac{D_1}{1.96} \cdot 0.1897 \approx D_1 \cdot \frac{0.1897}{1.96} \approx D_1 \cdot 0.0968
\]

Thus, the distance of Planet3 is approximately \( D_3 \approx 0.0968 \cdot D_1 \).

### Step 2: Applying Kepler's Third Law
Kepler's third law states that the square of the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to the cube of the orbital distance \( D \):
\[
P^2 \propto D^3
\]

Taking the ratio of the periods:
\[
\left(\frac{P_3}{P_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^3
\]

Substituting \( \frac{D_3}{D_1} \approx 0.0968 \):
\[
\left(\frac{P_3}{P_1}\right)^2 = (0.0968)^3 \approx 0.000912
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} \approx \sqrt{0.000912} \approx 0.0302
\]

This result implies that Planet3's orbital period is much shorter than Planet1's, which contradicts the given options (all greater than 1). To resolve this, we re-evaluate the temperature ratios and distances.

### Step 3: Correcting the Temperature Ratios
If the temperature ratios are inverted (\( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \) and \( \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \)), the distances would instead follow:
1. \( D_1 < D_2 < D_3 \), meaning Planet3 is the farthest.
2. Recalculating the distances:
   - \( D_2 = D_1 \cdot \left(\frac{T_1}{T_2}\right)^2 = D_1 \cdot (1.4)^2 = D_1 \cdot 1.96 \)
   - \( D_3 = D_2 \cdot \left(\frac{T_2}{T_3}\right)^2 = D_2 \cdot (2.3)^2 = D_2 \cdot 5.29 \)

Substituting \( D_2 = 1.96 \cdot D_1 \):
\[
D_3 = 1.96 \cdot D_1 \cdot 5.29 \approx 10.37 \cdot D_1
\]

Thus, \( D_3 \approx 10.37 \cdot D_1 \).

### Step 4: Recalculating the Period Ratio
Using Kepler's law again:
\[
\left(\frac{P_3}{P_1}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^3 = (10.37)^3 \approx 1114.5
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} \approx \sqrt{1114.5} \approx 33.4
\]

### Final Answer
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. 

ANSWER: D
