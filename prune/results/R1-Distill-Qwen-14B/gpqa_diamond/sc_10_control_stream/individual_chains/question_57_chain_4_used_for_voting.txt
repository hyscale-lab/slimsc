Okay, so I have this physics problem about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Hmm, I remember from my studies that in electron scattering experiments, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. But wait, I need to think about how exactly.

The problem gives me phase shifts δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, and δ₄ as 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. Also, it says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. Oh right, because higher orders beyond l=4 might not contribute significantly or maybe they're not given here.

The question is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh wait, the incident beam direction is the same as the initial direction of the electrons, so that's the forward direction. I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) for electrons is given by a specific formula involving the phase shifts.

I recall the formula for the scattering amplitude f(s, θ) which involves a sum over the angular momentum states. Specifically, the formula is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ].

Wait, but wait: when θ is 0 degrees, which is the forward direction, sin(lθ + δ_l) becomes sin(δ_l), right? Because θ is 0, so lθ is zero. So each term becomes (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l) multiplied by 1/(2ik). 

But wait, the problem is about the imaginary part. So I need to compute the imaginary part of f(0), I think. Because θ is zero, the forward direction.

Let me write this down. The imaginary part of f(0) would be Im[ (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l) ) ].

Hmm, but 1/(2ik) can be written as -i/(2k), since 1/i = -i. So that factor is -i/(2k). So when I take the imaginary part of the entire expression, I need to consider this as well.

Wait, more precisely, f(0) is (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l). Because for each l, the term is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin(l*0 + δ_l) = (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l).

Wait, but sin(δ_l) is a real number. So each term is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} * sin(δ_l). So the entire sum is a sum of complex numbers, each with magnitude (2l+1) sin(δ_l) and phase δ_l.

So the overall expression for f(0) is (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l} (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l).

I can factor out the e^{i δ_l} as cos(δ_l) + i sin(δ_l). So each term is (2l+1) sin(δ_l) [ cos(δ_l) + i sin(δ_l) ].

But let's compute the entire expression step by step.

Let me compute the sum S = sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l).

But since e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l, when I multiply by sin δ_l, each term becomes (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l ].

But wait, when I take the entire sum, it's a complex number. So S = sum (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l ].

Wait, but each term is a complex number with real part (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l and imaginary part (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

So S = S_real + i S_imag, where S_real is sum (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l, and S_imag is sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

But then f(0) is (1/(2ik)) * (S_real + i S_imag).

So f(0) = (S_real + i S_imag) / (2ik).

Now, 2ik is in the denominator. Let me write 2ik as 2i k. So 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k), because 1/i = -i.

So f(0) = (S_real + i S_imag) * (-i)/(2k).

Multiplying out, the numerator becomes (-i S_real) - i^2 S_imag. Since i^2 is -1, this is (-i S_real) + S_imag.

So f(0) = [ S_imag - i S_real ] / (2k).

Therefore, the imaginary part of f(0) is [ - S_real ] / (2k).

Because the expression is (S_imag - i S_real)/(2k), which has real part S_imag/(2k) and imaginary part (- S_real)/(2k).

So Im[f(0)] = (- S_real)/(2k).

Wait, but wait: the denominator is 2k, and the numerator is - S_real. So Im(f(0)) = (- S_real)/(2k).

Hmm, okay. Now I need to compute S_real, which is the sum over l=0 to 4 of (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l.

Let me calculate each term for l=0 to l=4.

Given the phase shifts:

l=0: δ₀=90° → 90 degrees
l=1: δ₁=67°
l=2: δ₂=55°
l=3: δ₃=30°
l=4: δ₄=13°

Compute each (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l.

Let me compute each term:

l=0:

(2*0+1) = 1

cos(90°) = 0.

So term = 1 * 0 * sin(90°) = 0.

l=1:

(2*1+1)=3

cos(67°) ≈ cos(67°) ≈ 0.3907

sin(67°) ≈ 0.9205

Term = 3 * 0.3907 * 0.9205 ≈ 3 * 0.3907 * 0.9205.

Compute that: 0.3907 * 0.9205 ≈ 0.3907 * 0.9205 ≈ let's see, 0.3907 *0.9=0.3516, 0.3907 *0.0205≈0.0080. So total ≈ 0.3596. Multiply by 3: ≈1.0788.

l=2:

(2*2+1)=5

cos(55°)≈0.5736

sin(55°)≈0.8192

Term =5 * 0.5736 *0.8192.

Compute 0.5736 *0.8192 ≈ approximately:

0.5 *0.8=0.4, 0.0736*0.8=0.05888; 0.5*0.0192=0.0096, 0.0736*0.0192≈0.00141.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 0.5736 *0.8192:

Multiply 5736 *8192 (but only two decimal digits each, so maybe approximate.

Alternatively, 0.5736 *0.8 = 0.4589, 0.5736 *0.0192 ≈ 0.01105. So total ≈ 0.4589 + 0.01105 ≈ 0.46995. Multiply by 5: 5 *0.46995 ≈ 2.34975.

So term ≈2.34975.

l=3:

(2*3+1)=7

cos(30°)=√3/2 ≈0.8660

sin(30°)=0.5.

Term=7 * 0.8660 *0.5=7 *0.4330=3.031.

l=4:

(2*4+1)=9

cos(13°)≈0.9744

sin(13°)≈0.22495.

Term=9 * 0.9744 * 0.22495.

Compute 0.9744 *0.22495 ≈approx: 0.9744 *0.2=0.1949, 0.9744*0.02495≈0.0243.

Total ≈ 0.2192. Multiply by 9: ≈1.9728.

Now, sum all these terms:

l=0: 0.

l=1: ~1.0788

l=2: ~2.3498

l=3: 3.031

l=4: ~1.9728

Sum:

1.0788 +2.3498 =3.4286

3.4286 +3.031=6.4596

6.4596 +1.9728=8.4324.

So S_real ≈8.4324.

Now, the imaginary part of f(0) is (- S_real)/(2k) = (-8.4324)/(2k).

Wait, but what is k? Because in the denominator, we have 2k. I think k is the wave number.

The electrons have energy 50 MeV. But electrons are light, so we probably need to compute their momentum and then the wave number.

Wait, the formula for the wave number k is k = (sqrt(2mE))/ħ, but I need to use the correct units. Let me think.

Wait, in electron scattering, the electrons are treated relativistically, but since the energy here is 50 MeV, which is much larger than the rest mass of the electron (about 0.511 MeV), so relativistic effects are significant. Hmm, but I'm not sure if this affects the calculation of k. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the non-relativistic formula for k, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the relativistic expression for the momentum p is sqrt( (E c)^2 - (m c^2)^2 ), but since E is given as 50 MeV, and m c^2 is ~0.511 MeV, E is much larger than m c^2, so p is approximately E/c.

But for the wave number k, which is p/(ħ c) perhaps? Let me think.

Wait, the wave number k in scattering is given by k = (sqrt(2 m E))/ħ for non-relativistic, but when E is high, the relativistic formula comes into play.

Alternatively, the formula for the wave number k is p/(ħ c), but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that in electron scattering, the wave number k is given by (E)/(ħ c), but wait, no, because E is the kinetic energy? Or is it the total energy? Hmm.

Wait, the standard formula for the wave number is k = (p)/(ħ), where p is the momentum. But p is given by sqrt(2 m E)} for non-relativistic, but for relativistic, E = sqrt( (pc c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), so p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) .

So for non-relativistic, E << m c^2, but in our case, E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than m c^2 (0.511 MeV), so we must use the relativistic formula.

So p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ). So E is 50 MeV, m c^2 is 0.511 MeV.

So (m c^2)^2 is negligible compared to E^2. So p c ≈ E.

Thus, p c ≈50 MeV.

But k is p/(ħ c), so k = p/(ħ c) = (p c) / (ħ c^2 ) = (50 MeV) / (ħ c^2 ) * something? Wait, perhaps I'm getting units wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in terms of inverse femtometers (fm^-1), since the options are in fm.

Let me think about the units. The Planck constant ħ has units of J·s. But when dealing with particle physics, it's often given in units of MeV·fm. So ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, ħ c ≈197.33 MeV·fm. So 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1/(197.33 MeV fm) → but perhaps I should compute k as p/(ħ c), which would give me 1/fm.

Wait, because p has units of MeV/c (momentum in units where c=1?), or perhaps not. Let me get this straight.

Wait, E has units of MeV. p is in MeV/c (since E = pc for massless particles). So, p = E / c for high energies. But when E is 50 MeV, p is 50 MeV/c.

So, k = p/(ħ) → but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of units.

We know that k (wave number) has units of 1/fm. We also know that ħ has units of MeV·fm. So ħ c has units of MeV·fm * (velocity of light in fm/s) → but velocity of light is c ≈ 3e8 m/s. To get units right, perhaps it's better to use natural units where c=1.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach is better. The wave number k is given by k = p/(ħ c). Let's compute p as E/c for high energy.

Wait, no, wait. For high energies, E ≈ pc → p ≈ E/c. So p = E/(c).

But units wise, E is in MeV, and c is in fm per femtosecond? Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute k in terms of E.

Wait, perhaps using the relation k = (E)/(ħ c). Let me see.

Wait, if E is in MeV, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm. So k = E/(ħ c) → (50 MeV) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) = 50/(197.33) fm^-1.

Compute that: 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

Wait, but wait. Because E is the kinetic energy or the total energy? Wait, in the relativistic case, E is the total energy, which is much larger than m c², so E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ) ≈ pc → p ≈ E/(c).

So, perhaps k = p/(ħ c) = (E/(c)) / (ħ c) ) = E/( ħ c^2 )? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps k = ( E ) / ( ħ c ), because p = E/c, and k = p/(ħ) → (E/(c)) / ħ = E/( ħ c ). Which would make k in units of 1/(fm), since ħ c is in MeV fm.

So, E=50 MeV. Therefore, k = 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) ) = 50 /197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

So, k ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

But wait, perhaps I should double-check this.

Wait, let's compute pc: E = 50 MeV. For relativistic particles, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). Since m c^2 is 0.511 MeV, and E=50 MeV >> m c^2, so E ≈ pc → pc ≈50 MeV.

So p = (50 MeV) / c.

Then, k = p/(ħ) → (50 MeV/c) / ħ.

But ħ is in J·s, so perhaps I need to convert units.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find the expression for k in terms of E using natural units. In natural units where ħ = c =1, then E (in MeV) equals the momentum p (in MeV), and the wave number k is p/(ħ) → but with ħ=1, so k = p = E.

But in actual units, k is p/(ħ c) → because in natural units, ħ c =1, so k (in 1/fm) would be E (MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → the same as 50/197.33 ≈0.253 fm^-1.

So, k ≈0.253 fm^-1.

Now, back to the imaginary part of f(0):

Im(f(0))= (- S_real) / (2k).

We have S_real≈8.4324.

So Im(f(0))= (-8.4324)/(2 * 0.253).

Compute denominator: 2 *0.253=0.506.

So 8.4324 / 0.506 ≈ let's compute that.

8.4324 ÷ 0.506 → let's see, 0.506 * 16 = 8.096. 8.4324-8.096=0.3364.

0.506 * 0.664 ≈ 0.336. So approximately 16.664.

But since it's negative, Im(f(0))≈-16.664 fm.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are in the hundreds. Did I make a miscalculation somewhere?

Wait, wait. Hold on, perhaps the calculation of S_real is wrong. Let me recalculate each term.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in computing the term for l=1. Let me recheck each term.

Recomputing each term:

l=0: (2l+1)=1, δ=90°.

cos(90)=0. sin(90)=1. So term is 1 *0 *1=0.

l=1:

(2*1+1)=3.

cos(67)= approx 0.3907.

sin(67)=0.9205.

So term=3 * 0.3907 * 0.9205.

Compute 0.3907 *0.9205.

0.39 *0.92 = 0.359. 0.0007 *0.92=0.000644. 0.39 *0.0005=0.000195. 0.0007 *0.0005≈0.00000035.

So sum: 0.359 + 0.000644 + 0.000195 + 0.00000035 ≈0.35984.

Multiply by 3: ~1.0795.

l=2: (2*2+1)=5; δ=55°.

cos(55)=~0.5736.

sin(55)=~0.8192.

Term=5 *0.5736 *0.8192.

Compute 0.5736 *0.8192.

0.5 *0.8=0.4; 0.5 *0.0192=0.0096. 0.0736 *0.8=0.05888. 0.0736 *0.0192=0.00141.

So adding up: 0.4 +0.0096=0.4096; +0.05888=0.46848; +0.00141=0.46989.

Multiply by 5: ~2.34945.

l=3: (2*3+1)=7; δ=30°.

cos(30)=√3/2≈0.8660.

sin(30)=0.5.

Term=7 *0.8660 *0.5 =7 *0.433 =3.031.

l=4: (2*4+1)=9; δ=13°.

cos(13)=~0.9744.

sin(13)=~0.22495.

Term=9 *0.9744 *0.22495.

Compute 0.9744 *0.22495.

0.9 *0.22495=0.202455. 0.0744 *0.22495≈0.01674. So total ≈0.202455 +0.01674≈0.219195.

Multiply by9: ≈1.972755.

Now summing all terms:

0 (l=0) +1.0795 (l=1)=1.0795.

+2.34945 (l=2)=3.42895.

+3.031 (l=3)=6.45995.

+1.972755 (l=4)=8.432705.

So S_real≈8.4327.

Now, the denominator is 2k = 2*0.253 fm⁻¹ = 0.506 fm⁻¹.

So Im(f(0)) = (-8.4327) / (0.506) ≈ -16.66 (approx).

Wait, but the options are in the range of hundreds. So something's wrong. Maybe I messed up the formula for the scattering amplitude.

Wait, maybe I should have considered that the formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l). At θ=0, this becomes (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l).

But earlier I thought that the imaginary part would be ( - S_real )/(2k ), but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me go back to the expression for f(0):

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * [ sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ].

Let me write e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l.

So each term is (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l ].

Therefore, summing over l, the sum S is S_real + i S_imag, where S_real = sum (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l and S_imag = sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

So f(0) = [ S_real + i S_imag ] / (2ik ).

But 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k), so:

f(0) = [ S_real + i S_imag ] * (-i)/(2k) )

Multiply numerator:

= [ -i S_real - i^2 S_imag ] / (2k )

i^2 is -1, so:

= [ -i S_real + S_imag ] / (2k )

So,

f(0) = [ S_imag - i S_real ] / (2k )

Which means the real part is S_imag/(2k ), and the imaginary part is (- S_real )/(2k ).

Wait, so the imaginary part is Im(f(0)) = (- S_real )/(2k ).

But in my calculation, S_real is about 8.4327. So Im(f(0)) would be -8.4327/(2k ), which with k=0.253 fm⁻¹, is -8.4327/(0.506 ) ≈ -16.66 fm.

But the options are in the hundreds. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for the scattering amplitude. Another possibility is that the phase shifts are given in degrees, but perhaps I should have converted them to radians.

Wait, right! The phase shifts are in degrees, but when calculating trigonometric functions, they must be converted to radians.

So I should have converted each δ_l from degrees to radians before computing cos and sin.

Ah, I see. That's a crucial mistake. So let me redo the calculations with δ_l in radians.

So, step by step: convert each δ_l to radians.

l=0: 90° → π/2 radians ≈1.5708 rad.

l=1:67° → 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 rad.

l=2:55° →55 * π/180 ≈0.95993 rad.

l=3:30°→π/6≈0.5236 rad.

l=4:13° →13 * π/180≈0.2269 rad.

Now, compute each term again with these radian values.

l=0:

cos(1.5708)=0, sin(1.5708)=1.

Term: 1 * 0 * 1=0.

l=1:

cos(1.16937)= approximately: cos(67°) as 0.3907.

But let me compute more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator.

Wait, but I have to proceed mentally. Well, 67 degrees is 1.16937 radians.

cos(1.16937) ≈0.3907.

sin(1.16937)= approximately 0.9205.

So term=3 * 0.3907 * 0.9205 ≈1.0795.

l=2: 55°=0.95993 rad.

cos(0.95993) ≈0.5736.

sin(0.95993)≈0.8192.

Term=5 *0.5736 *0.8192≈2.34945.

l=3:30°=0.5236 rad.

cos=0.8660, sin=0.5.

Term=7 *0.8660 *0.5=3.031.

l=4:13°=0.2269 rad.

cos≈0.9744, sin≈0.22495.

Term=9 *0.9744 *0.22495≈1.97275.

So summing all terms: 0 +1.0795 +2.34945 +3.031 +1.97275 ≈8.4327.

So S_real remains the same, about 8.4327.

But wait, why? Because the trigonometric functions are the same whether in degrees or radians? No, that's not correct. The functions have different values when computed in different units.

Wait, no, the functions' values are different. Wait, I'm confused. Because in the earlier steps, I used degrees when computing the cos and sin. But if I use radians, the values change.

Wait, wait! That's the mistake. I should have converted the angles to radians before calculating cos and sin.

So, let's recompute the terms using radians.

Because for l=1, for example, 67 degrees is about 1.16937 radians, and cos(1.16937) is approximately 0.3907. Wait, but wait, no, cos(1.16937) is actually cos(67 degrees)=0.3907, so it's the same value. Wait, that's correct because in both cases, the angle is the same; it's just that in trigonometric functions, the argument is in radians when using functions like math.cos in Python. So whether I compute cos(67 degrees) as cos(1.16937 radians), the value is the same. So perhaps I didn't make a mistake in the earlier calculation, but perhaps the issue is elsewhere.

Wait, but why am I getting a value that's way off compared to the options?

Looking back, the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm.

Hmm, my calculation gives Im(f(0))= -16.66 fm, which is not among the options. So where's the mistake?

Ah, perhaps I was supposed to use the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, not considering the product with cos δ_l. Wait, no, because the formula for S_real is sum (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is different.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should have taken the imaginary part of f(0) as (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) / (2k).

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivation of Im(f(0)).

Wait, let's go back.

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l )

= (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l+1) (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ) sin δ_l ]

= (1/(2ik)) sum [ (2l+1) ( cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l ) ]

= (1/(2ik)) [ sum (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ]

= (1/(2ik)) [ S_real + i S_imag ]

Now, 1/(2ik) can be written as (-i)/(2k) because 1/(i) = -i.

So,

f(0) = [ S_real + i S_imag ] * (-i)/(2k )

= [ -i S_real - i^2 S_imag ] / (2k )

= [ -i S_real + S_imag ] / (2k )

So, f(0) = ( S_imag - i S_real ) / (2k )

So, the real part is S_imag/(2k ), and the imaginary part is (- S_real )/(2k )

So, Im(f(0))= (- S_real )/(2k )

But in our calculation, S_real is approximately 8.4327.

So, Im(f(0))= -8.4327/(2 * 0.253 )

Wait, denominator 2*0.253 is 0.506.

So 8.4327 / 0.506 ≈ 16.66.

But the options are in the hundreds, so this suggests that perhaps the phase shifts were supposed to be summed differently, or perhaps I made a mistake in computing the sum.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing S_real.

Wait, let me recompute each term accurately.

Compute each term (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l, with δ_l in radians.

l=0:

δ=90°= π/2 → cos=0, so term=1 *0 *1=0.

l=1:

δ=67°=1.16937 rad.

cos(1.16937)= approx 0.3907.

sin(1.16937)= approx 0.9205.

term=3 * 0.3907 * 0.9205.

Compute 0.3907 *0.9205.

0.3907 *0.9=0.35163, 0.3907 *0.0205=0.00800485.

Sum: 0.35163 +0.00800485 ≈0.3596.

Multiply by 3: 1.0788.

l=2:

δ=55°=0.95993 rad.

cos≈0.5736, sin≈0.8192.

term=5 * 0.5736 *0.8192.

0.5736 *0.8192=0.4698.

Multiply by5=2.349.

l=3:

30°=0.5236 rad.

cos≈0.8660, sin=0.5.

term=7 *0.8660 *0.5=7 *0.433=3.031.

l=4:

13°=0.2269 rad.

cos≈0.9744, sin≈0.22495.

term=9 *0.9744 *0.22495.

0.9744 *0.22495≈0.21919.

Multiply by9=1.9727.

Sum all terms:

0 +1.0788 +2.349 +3.031 +1.9727=8.4315.

Hmm, same as before. So S_real≈8.4315.

Now, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k. Let me recompute k.

Given E=50 MeV.

k= E/(ħ c).

But ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

So, k=50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) = 50/197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So, denominator 2k=0.506 fm⁻¹.

Im(f(0))= -8.4315 / 0.506 ≈-16.66 fm.

But this doesn't match any options. So I'm clearly missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, which is S_imag.

Wait, S_imag = sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Let's compute S_imag.

l=0: 1 * sin^2(90°) =1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67°)=3*(0.9205)^2=3*(0.847)=2.541.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55°)=5*(0.8192)^2=5*(0.671)=3.355.

l=3:7 * sin^2(30°)=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin^2(13°)=9*(0.22495)^2=9*(0.0506)=4.554.

Sum:

1 +2.541=3.541.

+3.355=6.896.

+1.75=8.646.

+4.554=13.2.

So S_imag=13.2.

So f(0) = [ S_imag - i S_real ] / (2k ) → [13.2 -i 8.43 ] / (0.506 )

Which gives real part 13.2/0.506 ≈26.07 fm.

Imaginary part: -8.43/0.506≈-16.66 fm.

But the question is about the imaginary part, which is -16.66 fm. But the options are much larger. So perhaps the formula isn't right.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(s,θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ sin(δ_l) e^{i δ_l} - δ_l ].

Wait, no, that's the optical theorem or something else. I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l).

Wait, but that's what I used earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the electrons are spin-1/2 particles, so the phase shifts are different. But the problem states it's an experiment of elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons, so maybe the formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the sum of the phase shifts, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by the sum of the phase shifts.

Wait, that seems unlikely, but let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the formula for the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k).

So sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Compute this sum:

l=0: 1 * sin(90)=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum: 1 +2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455≈13.382.

So sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ≈13.382.

If the formula is Im(f(0))= sum/(2k ), then Im(f(0))=13.382/(2*0.253 )=13.382/0.506 ≈26.45 fm.

But the options are much larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, but multiplied by another factor.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the amplitude is f(θ)= sum_{l} (2l+1) [ (e^{i δ_l} -1) ] P_l (cosθ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial.

But when θ=0, cosθ=1, and P_l(1)=1 for all l.

So f(0)= sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1).

But e^{i δ_l} -1 = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l -1 = [cos δ_l -1 ] + i sin δ_l.

So f(0) = sum [ (2l+1) ( [cos δ_l -1 ] + i sin δ_l ) ].

So the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which for l=0 to4 is 1*1 +3*0.9205 +5*0.8192 +7*0.5 +9*0.22495.

Which is 1 +2.7615 +4.096 +3.5 +2.02455=1+2.7615=3.7615+4.096=7.8575+3.5=11.3575+2.02455=13.382.

So Im(f(0))=13.382.

But the options are in hundreds, so this can't be right. So maybe I'm missing a factor of k.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l ), which I originally used.

So, perhaps the mistake is that the wave number k isn't 0.253 fm⁻¹, but something else.

Wait, let's recalculate k.

k is given by (E)/(ħ c ). But what's the value of ħ c in appropriate units?

I think ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

So, k = E / (ħ c ) = 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) = 50 / 197.33 ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l ), not divided by 2ik.

Wait, let me think.

In the Born approximation, the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = ( (2m / ħ² )^{1/2} ) ( (e^2)/(4π ε_0 r) ) ) ... but perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the partial wave expansion.

The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ) ] / (k (2ik) )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me look up the correct formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin( lθ + δ_l )

Which is what I used earlier.

So I think the mistake must be elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but I used degrees. Wait, no, the question says δo=90 degrees, etc., so they are in degrees, so I correctly converted to radians for the trigonometric functions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of f(0) is sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k ), without considering the cos δ_l term.

Wait, in that case, sum (2l+1) sin δ_l=13.382.

Then, Im(f(0))=13.382 / (2*0.253 )=13.382 /0.506≈26.45 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should have taken the sum of (2l+1) (sin δ_l ), then multiply by (1/(2ik)).

Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, and then calculate that as the imaginary part multiplied by a factor.

Wait, 13.382 * (something) to get to the options.

Looking at the options, C is 177.675 fm.

Hmm, 13.382 multiplied by 13.26 is about 177.675.

13.382 *13.26 ≈ 177.675.

But I don't know where 13.26 would come from.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k differently, considering relativistic effects.

Wait, the relativistic energy is E = gamma m c^2. So for E=50 MeV, gamma is E/(m c² )=50/(0.511)≈97.827.

Thus, the momentum p is gamma m v. But perhaps for electrons, the relation is p = gamma m v, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, using the relativistic relation, p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 )

So p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈50 MeV.

So p ≈50 MeV / c.

Thus, k = p/(ħ c )= (50 MeV/c ) / ( ħ c )=50/( ħ c^2 ) [MeV/c ] / [ MeV fm ].

Wait, ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm.

So, k=50/(197.33 ) ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

Same as before.

So I'm back to the same value.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is different, involving the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, and the imaginary part is that sum multiplied by something.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part of f(θ) at θ=0 is the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l divided by (2k).

Which would be 13.382/(2*0.253)=13.382/0.506≈26.45 fm.

But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the imaginary part is the sum of (2l+1) times (1 - cos δ_l ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the imaginary part of f(0) is the sum of (2l+1) times (1 - cos δ_l ), but no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to multiply the sum by 1/(2ik), but I'm not considering the units correctly.

Wait, perhaps k is in inverse fermis, but the options are in fm, which is the same as fermi.

Wait, no, k is in fm⁻¹, and the amplitude is in fm.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/(2k) )

Which gives:

sum (2l+1) sin δ_l =13.382.

Im(f(0))=13.382/(2 *0.253 )=26.45 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the answer is option D:251.271 fm.

But that's about ten times larger than 26.45.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the phase shifts for higher l beyond 4 are being ignored, but the problem states to ignore the rest, so I think I accounted for that.

Another thought: perhaps the formula is f(θ)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l ), without the 2i in the denominator.

If that's the case, then f(0)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l )

= (1/k) [ sum (2l+1)( cos δ_l sin δ_l +i sin^2 δ_l ) ]

So the imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l /k.

From earlier, sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l =13.2.

k=0.253 fm⁻¹.

So, Im(f(0))=13.2/0.253 ≈52.17 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin( lθ + δ_l )

Which is the same as earlier.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps ħ c is actually 197.33 MeV fm, but in this calculation, since E=50 MeV, and k= E/(ħ c ), which is 50/197.33=0.253 fm⁻¹.

But maybe the correct calculation is k= (2mE)^{1/2}/ħ.

Wait, but that's the non-relativistic formula. For high energy electrons (E=50 MeV), the non-relativistic formula isn't applicable. So this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relativistic formula for the wave number k.

The relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2 )^2 )

So, p = sqrt( E² - (m c² )² ) / c.

So, p ≈ E/c for E >> m c².

Then, k = p/(ħ c ) → (E/(c)) / (ħ c ) → E/( ħ c² )

But ħ c≈197 MeV fm.

Wait, so:

k = E/( ħ c² ) → (50 MeV ) / (197.33 MeV fm * c² )

Wait, but c is the speed of light, which in fm units is c ≈ 3e8 m/s. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing units here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take ħ c as 197.33 MeV fm, so:

k = E/( ħ c ) → 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) = 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Same result.

So, I'm stuck. All the calculations lead me to Im(f(0))≈-16.66 fm or around 26 fm, but the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians instead of degrees. Let me try that.

If the phase shifts are in radians, which would be a mistake because the question states degrees, but let me see.

For example, δ₀=90 radians is about 5156 degrees, which is impossible. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should have kept everything in degrees, but that's incorrect because trigonometric functions in math expect radians.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) (1 - cos δ_l) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, sum (2l+1) (1 - cos δ_l ) for l=0 to4.

l=0:1*(1-0)=1.

l=1:3*(1-0.3907)=3*0.6093≈1.8279.

l=2:5*(1-0.5736)=5*0.4264=2.132.

l=3:7*(1-0.8660)=7*0.134≈0.938.

l=4:9*(1-0.9744)=9*0.0256≈0.2304.

Sum:1+1.8279=2.8279+2.132=4.9599+0.938=5.8979+0.2304≈6.1283.

If the formula is Im(f(0))= 6.1283/(2k )=6.1283/(0.506 )≈12.11 fm.

Still not matching options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute all the terms again, but considering that the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l )/(2ik ), and then take the imaginary part.

Wait, let me compute the sum more accurately.

The sum S = sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Each term is (2l+1) [ cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ] sin δ_l = (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ]

So the sum S is S_real + i S_imag.

S_real is sum (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l → 8.4327.

S_imag is sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l →13.2.

Then, f(0) = (S_real + i S_imag )/(2ik )

= (8.4327 + i 13.2 ) / ( 2i *0.253 )

Denominator: 2i *0.253 → 0.506 i.

So, f(0) = (8.4327 + i 13.2 ) / (0.506 i )

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to rationalize:

= [ (8.4327 + i 13.2 ) * (-i) ] / (0.506 * i * (-i) )

Denominator: i*(-i)= -i² =1.

So denominator is 0.506 *1 =0.506.

Numerator:

8.4327*(-i ) + i 13.2 * (-i )

= -8.4327 i -13.2 i².

i²= -1, so:

= -8.4327 i +13.2.

So, f(0) = (13.2 -8.4327 i ) /0.506.

Which can be written as 13.2/0.506 - i (8.4327/0.506 )

So, real part is 13.2/0.506 ≈26.08 fm.

Imaginary part is -8.4327/0.506 ≈-16.66 fm.

But the options are in the hundreds, so this is frustrating.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin( lθ + δ_l ), without the 2i in the denominator.

In that case, f(0) = (1/k ) (S_real +i S_imag )

So Im(f(0))= S_imag /k.

S_imag=13.2.

k=0.253 fm⁻¹.

Im(f(0))=13.2/0.253≈52.17 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, the options are much larger, but perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are in units of π/2?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by 1000 or something, but that's arbitrary.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by (ħ c )/(2m_e c^2 ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, which is approximately 13.382, and multiply by (ħ c )/(2m_e c^2 ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c )/(2m_e c² )

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, then multiply by (ħ c )/(2m_e c² ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's compute m_e c² in MeV. m_e c² is approximately 0.511 MeV.

So if I compute (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c )/(2 m_e c² ), I get 13.382 * (197.33 MeV fm )/( 2 *0.511 MeV )

=13.382 * (197.33 / (2 *0.511 )) fm.

Compute denominator 2 *0.511=1.022.

197.33/1.022≈193.13.

So 13.382 *193.13≈2584.6 fm.

But that's way larger than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 13.382 * (197.33 ) / (2 *0.511 ) fm → same as above.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c )/(2m_e c^2 ).

So, 13.382 * (197.33 )/( 2 *0.511 ) → same as above.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to accept that the calculation leads to Im(f(0))≈-16.66 fm, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Another thought: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] sin(lθ + δ_l )

In that case, e^{2i δ_l} -1 = cos(2 δ_l ) + i sin(2 δ_l ) -1.

But at θ=0, sin(lθ + δ_l ) = sin(δ_l ), so f(0)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ cos(2 δ_l ) + i sin(2 δ_l ) -1 ] sin δ_l.

But this complicates the calculation further, leading me to think that perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct approach is to look for a standard formula or example.

Wait, I recall that in the case of the scattering amplitude, the imaginary part at θ=0 is given by the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l divided by (2k).

Which would be 13.382/(2*0.253 )=26.45 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are given as δ_l, and the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin( lθ + δ_l )

So, at θ=0, f(0)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Which is what I did earlier.

But the result doesn't match the options.

Another thought: perhaps the phase shifts given are in units where k=1.

But that's not the case here.

Wait, maybe the problem is to calculate the imaginary part of f(0), which is Im(f(0))= sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k )

Which would be 13.382/(2*0.253 )=26.45 fm.

But again, not matching options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ)= sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1 ) P_l (cosθ )

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0)= sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1 )

The imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which is 13.382.

But the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = [ (e^{i δ} -1 ) ] / (something )

But I'm not getting anywhere.

Perhaps it's time to look for alternative approaches.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the imaginary part is given by the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by (2l+1) and divided by k.

Wait, but that leads to the same value as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by (2l+1), and then multiplied by (ħ c )/(2m_e c^2 ).

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the differential cross-section, which is |f(θ)|², but the problem specifically asks for the imaginary part.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the unit conversion for k. Let me double-check.

k is given by (E)/(ħ c )

E=50 MeV.

ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

k=50/197.33 ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

But what if I used E=50 MeV, but in a different unit system? I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate k in terms of inverse meters instead of inverse femtometers, but that would make k extremely small, which doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave number k is given by the relativistic formula k= sqrt( (E/(ħ c ))^2 - (m c/(ħ ))^2 )

Wait, but that's the same as p/(ħ )=k, where p=E/c.

Wait, no, that's the same as before.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I've exhausted all possibilities and can't reconcile the calculated value with the given options. But since the options are much larger, perhaps I missed a factor of 1000 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (ħ c )/(2m_e c^2 )

Which would give:

13.382 * (197.33 ) / (2 *0.511 ) → 13.382 * 197.33 ≈2644.6; 2644.6 /1.022≈2588 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor is (ħ c )/(m_e c^2 ), which is 197.33 /0.511≈386.2.

So 13.382 *386.2≈5155 fm.

No.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (ħ c )/(m_e c^2 )

Which would be 13.382 * (197.33 )/0.511 ≈13.382 *386.2≈5155 fm.

But the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (ħ c )/(2 m_e c^2 )

Which is 13.382 * (197.33 )/(2 *0.511 ) → same as earlier.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c )/(2 m_e c^2 )

Which would be 13.382 * (197.33 )/(2 *0.511 ) → same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c )/(m_e c^2 )

Which is 13.382 * (197.33 )/0.511 →13.382 *386.2≈5155 fm.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the non-relativistic formula for k.

Non-relativistic k= sqrt(2 m E )/ ħ.

But E=50 MeV.

Convert E into Joules: 50 MeV =50e6 eV =50e6 *1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.

m_e=9.109e-31 kg.

k= sqrt(2 * m_e * E ) / ħ.

Compute numerator: sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-13 J )

= sqrt( 2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 ) = sqrt(1.458e-43 ) ≈1.207e-21 m⁻¹.

Denominator: ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k=1.207e-21 /1.0545718e-34 ≈1.144e13 m⁻¹=1.144e7 fm⁻¹.

Hmm, this would make Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l /k → 13.382/(1.144e7 )≈1.17e-6 fm.

Which is way too small.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Hmm.

I think I've tried all the possible approaches I can think of, but none lead me to the options given. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking at the options, the closest I have to 26 fm is not present. The options are around 177 fm (option C), 251 fm (option D), etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of S_real.

Wait, let me recalculate S_real with more accurate trigonometric values.

Compute each term precisely:

l=0: 1 * cos(90) * sin(90)=0.

l=1:3 * cos(67°)* sin(67°)

cos(67°)=0.3907311284892737.

sin(67°)=0.9205048534524406.

So term=3 *0.390731128 *0.920504853=3*(0.390731128 *0.920504853 )=3*(0.359586226 )=1.07875868.

l=2:5 * cos(55°)* sin(55°)

cos(55)=0.5735764363510587.

sin(55)=0.8191520442790231.

term=5 *0.573576436 *0.819152044=5*(0.469844234 )=2.34922117.

l=3:7 * cos(30°)* sin(30°)

cos(30)=√3/2=0.8660254037844386.

sin(30)=0.5.

term=7 *0.86602540378 *0.5=7 *0.43301270189=3.031088913.

l=4:9 * cos(13°)* sin(13°)

cos(13°)=0.9743700647852352.

sin(13°)=0.2249510543538656.

term=9 *0.97437006478 *0.22495105435=9*(0.219215943 )=1.972943487.

Now, sum all terms:

0 +1.07875868=1.07875868 +2.34922117=3.42797985 +3.031088913=6.45906876 +1.972943487=8.431912247.

So S_real=8.431912247.

Then, Im(f(0))= -8.431912247/(2k )= -8.431912247/(2 *0.253 )= -8.431912247/0.506≈-16.66 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) →13.382, and multiplied by (ħ c )/(2 m_e c^2 ) →13.382 * (197.33 )/(2 *0.511 )≈13.382 *193.13 →13.382 *193=2588 fm.

But that's option A:87163 fm? No, it's much larger.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by (ħ c )/( m_e c^2 ) →13.382 * (197.33 )/0.511≈13.382 *386.2 →13.382 *386≈5155 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (ħ c )/( m_e c^2 ) → same as above.

Hmm.

Given that I can't reconcile my calculation with the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. But since I'm stuck, I'll have to make an educated guess. The option closest to my calculation of Im(f(0))= -16.66 fm isn't present. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is approximately 10 times 17.7675, which could be a miscalculation factor.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recalculate k.

E=50 MeV.

ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

k= E/(ħ c )=50/197.33≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, perhaps the correct k is (E/(ħ c )) * (1e3 ), but that would be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct k is 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) =0.253 fm⁻¹, which is correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different, and the imaginary part is the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by (ħ c )/( m_e c^2 )

Which is 13.382 * (197.33 )/0.511=13.382 *386.2≈5155 fm.

But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c )/(2 m_e c^2 )

Which is 13.382 *193.13≈2588 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 251.271 fm, which is approximately 2588/10.3≈251.

Ah, perhaps I missed a factor of 1/10 somewhere. Maybe because I used MeV instead of eV somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm, but perhaps it's 197.33 ×1e6 eV fm.

But I'm not sure how that would affect the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is 50 MeV, but I should have used 50 keV or another unit. But that's unlikely.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent and the options available, I think the intended answer is option D:251.271 fm. But I can't see how to arrive at that value from the calculations. Perhaps there's an error in the phase shift approach I took.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( f(0) \), for elastic electron scattering at the incident beam direction (\( \theta = 0^\circ \)). The scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts \( \delta_l \) through the formula:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i\delta_l} \sin(\delta_l),
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number, given by \( k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} \), with \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm} \). The imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is extracted as:

\[
\text{Im}\,f(0) = \frac{-S_{\text{real}}}{2k},
\]

where \( S_{\text{real}} = \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \cos(\delta_l) \sin(\delta_l) \).

### Key Steps:
1. **Phase Shifts and Trigonometric Values**: The phase shifts are given as \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). These are converted to radians for accurate computation of \( \cos(\delta_l) \) and \( \sin(\delta_l) \).

2. **Calculation of \( S_{\text{real}} \)**:
   - For each \( l \), compute \( (2l+1) \cos(\delta_l) \sin(\delta_l) \).
   - Sum these values for \( l = 0 \) to \( l = 4 \):
     \[
     S_{\text{real}} = 0 + 1.0788 + 2.3495 + 3.031 + 1.9728 = 8.4329.
     \]

3. **Wave Number \( k \)**:
   - Using \( k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} \), with \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( \hbar c = 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm} \):
     \[
     k = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
     \]

4. **Imaginary Part of \( f(0) \)**:
   - Substitute \( S_{\text{real}} \) and \( k \) into \( \text{Im}\,f(0) = \frac{-S_{\text{real}}}{2k} \):
     \[
     \text{Im}\,f(0) = \frac{-8.4329}{2 \times 0.253} \approx -16.66 \, \text{fm}.
     \]

5. **Mismatch with Options**: The calculated value of \( \text{Im}\,f(0) \approx -16.66 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. This suggests either a missing factor or an error in the interpretation of the formula.

6. **Final Guess**: Based on the options, the closest plausible answer is **D) 251.271 fm**, though the reasoning to reach this value remains unclear.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this physics problem about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Hmm, I remember from my studies that in electron scattering experiments, the scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts. But wait, I need to think about how exactly.

The problem gives me phase shifts δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, and δ₄ as 90°, 67°, 55°, 30°, and 13° respectively. Also, it says to ignore the rest of the phase shifts beyond δ₄. Oh right, because higher orders beyond l=4 might not contribute significantly or maybe they're not given here.

The question is asking for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Oh wait, the incident beam direction is the same as the initial direction of the electrons, so that's the forward direction. I think the scattering amplitude f(θ) for electrons is given by a specific formula involving the phase shifts.

I recall the formula for the scattering amplitude f(s, θ) which involves a sum over the angular momentum states. Specifically, the formula is something like f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^∞ [ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l) ].

Wait, but wait: when θ is 0 degrees, which is the forward direction, sin(lθ + δ_l) becomes sin(δ_l), right? Because θ is 0, so lθ is zero. So each term becomes (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin(δ_l) multiplied by 1/(2ik). 

But wait, the problem is about the imaginary part. So I need to compute the imaginary part of f(0), I think. Because θ is zero, the forward direction.

Let me write this down. The imaginary part of f(0) would be Im[ (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l) ) ].

Hmm, but 1/(2ik) can be written as -i/(2k), since 1/i = -i. So that factor is -i/(2k). So when I take the imaginary part of the entire expression, I need to consider this as well.

Wait, more precisely, f(0) is (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l). Because for each l, the term is (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin(l*0 + δ_l) = (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l).

Wait, but sin(δ_l) is a real number. So each term is (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} * sin(δ_l). So the entire sum is a sum of complex numbers, each with magnitude (2l+1) sin(δ_l) and phase δ_l.

So the overall expression for f(0) is (1/(2ik)) * sum_{l} (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l).

I can factor out the e^{i δ_l} as cos(δ_l) + i sin(δ_l). So each term is (2l+1) sin(δ_l) [ cos(δ_l) + i sin(δ_l) ].

But let's compute the entire expression step by step.

Let me compute the sum S = sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l).

But since e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l, when I multiply by sin δ_l, each term becomes (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l ].

But wait, when I take the entire sum, it's a complex number. So S = sum (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l ].

Wait, but each term is a complex number with real part (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l and imaginary part (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

So S = S_real + i S_imag, where S_real is sum (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l, and S_imag is sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

But then f(0) is (1/(2ik)) * (S_real + i S_imag).

So f(0) = (S_real + i S_imag) / (2ik).

Now, 2ik is in the denominator. Let me write 2ik as 2i k. So 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k), because 1/i = -i.

So f(0) = (S_real + i S_imag) * (-i)/(2k).

Multiplying out, the numerator becomes (-i S_real) - i^2 S_imag. Since i^2 is -1, this is (-i S_real) + S_imag.

So f(0) = [ S_imag - i S_real ] / (2k).

Therefore, the imaginary part of f(0) is [ - S_real ] / (2k).

Because the expression is (S_imag - i S_real)/(2k), which has real part S_imag/(2k) and imaginary part (- S_real)/(2k).

So Im[f(0)] = (- S_real)/(2k).

Wait, but wait: the denominator is 2k, and the numerator is - S_real. So Im(f(0)) = (- S_real)/(2k).

Hmm, okay. Now I need to compute S_real, which is the sum over l=0 to 4 of (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l.

Let me calculate each term for l=0 to l=4.

Given the phase shifts:

l=0: δ₀=90° → 90 degrees
l=1: δ₁=67°
l=2: δ₂=55°
l=3: δ₃=30°
l=4: δ₄=13°

Compute each (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l.

Let me compute each term:

l=0:

(2*0+1) = 1

cos(90°) = 0.

So term = 1 * 0 * sin(90°) = 0.

l=1:

(2*1+1)=3

cos(67°) ≈ cos(67°) ≈ 0.3907

sin(67°) ≈ 0.9205

Term = 3 * 0.3907 * 0.9205 ≈ 3 * 0.3907 * 0.9205.

Compute that: 0.3907 * 0.9205 ≈ 0.3907 * 0.9205 ≈ let's see, 0.3907 *0.9=0.3516, 0.3907 *0.0205≈0.0080. So total ≈ 0.3596. Multiply by 3: ≈1.0788.

l=2:

(2*2+1)=5

cos(55°)≈0.5736

sin(55°)≈0.8192

Term =5 * 0.5736 *0.8192.

Compute 0.5736 *0.8192 ≈ approximately:

0.5 *0.8=0.4, 0.0736*0.8=0.05888; 0.5*0.0192=0.0096, 0.0736*0.0192≈0.00141.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 0.5736 *0.8192:

Multiply 5736 *8192 (but only two decimal digits each, so maybe approximate.

Alternatively, 0.5736 *0.8 = 0.4589, 0.5736 *0.0192 ≈ 0.01105. So total ≈ 0.4589 + 0.01105 ≈ 0.46995. Multiply by 5: 5 *0.46995 ≈ 2.34975.

So term ≈2.34975.

l=3:

(2*3+1)=7

cos(30°)=√3/2 ≈0.8660

sin(30°)=0.5.

Term=7 * 0.8660 *0.5=7 *0.4330=3.031.

l=4:

(2*4+1)=9

cos(13°)≈0.9744

sin(13°)≈0.22495.

Term=9 * 0.9744 * 0.22495.

Compute 0.9744 *0.22495 ≈approx: 0.9744 *0.2=0.1949, 0.9744*0.02495≈0.0243.

Total ≈ 0.2192. Multiply by 9: ≈1.9728.

Now, sum all these terms:

l=0: 0.

l=1: ~1.0788

l=2: ~2.3498

l=3: 3.031

l=4: ~1.9728

Sum:

1.0788 +2.3498 =3.4286

3.4286 +3.031=6.4596

6.4596 +1.9728=8.4324.

So S_real ≈8.4324.

Now, the imaginary part of f(0) is (- S_real)/(2k) = (-8.4324)/(2k).

Wait, but what is k? Because in the denominator, we have 2k. I think k is the wave number.

The electrons have energy 50 MeV. But electrons are light, so we probably need to compute their momentum and then the wave number.

Wait, the formula for the wave number k is k = (sqrt(2mE))/ħ, but I need to use the correct units. Let me think.

Wait, in electron scattering, the electrons are treated relativistically, but since the energy here is 50 MeV, which is much larger than the rest mass of the electron (about 0.511 MeV), so relativistic effects are significant. Hmm, but I'm not sure if this affects the calculation of k. Alternatively, perhaps we can use the non-relativistic formula for k, but I'm not certain.

Wait, the relativistic expression for the momentum p is sqrt( (E c)^2 - (m c^2)^2 ), but since E is given as 50 MeV, and m c^2 is ~0.511 MeV, E is much larger than m c^2, so p is approximately E/c.

But for the wave number k, which is p/(ħ c) perhaps? Let me think.

Wait, the wave number k in scattering is given by k = (sqrt(2 m E))/ħ for non-relativistic, but when E is high, the relativistic formula comes into play.

Alternatively, the formula for the wave number k is p/(ħ c), but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that in electron scattering, the wave number k is given by (E)/(ħ c), but wait, no, because E is the kinetic energy? Or is it the total energy? Hmm.

Wait, the standard formula for the wave number is k = (p)/(ħ), where p is the momentum. But p is given by sqrt(2 m E)} for non-relativistic, but for relativistic, E = sqrt( (pc c)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ), so p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) .

So for non-relativistic, E << m c^2, but in our case, E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than m c^2 (0.511 MeV), so we must use the relativistic formula.

So p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ). So E is 50 MeV, m c^2 is 0.511 MeV.

So (m c^2)^2 is negligible compared to E^2. So p c ≈ E.

Thus, p c ≈50 MeV.

But k is p/(ħ c), so k = p/(ħ c) = (p c) / (ħ c^2 ) = (50 MeV) / (ħ c^2 ) * something? Wait, perhaps I'm getting units wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k in terms of inverse femtometers (fm^-1), since the options are in fm.

Let me think about the units. The Planck constant ħ has units of J·s. But when dealing with particle physics, it's often given in units of MeV·fm. So ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So, ħ c ≈197.33 MeV·fm. So 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1/(197.33 MeV fm) → but perhaps I should compute k as p/(ħ c), which would give me 1/fm.

Wait, because p has units of MeV/c (momentum in units where c=1?), or perhaps not. Let me get this straight.

Wait, E has units of MeV. p is in MeV/c (since E = pc for massless particles). So, p = E / c for high energies. But when E is 50 MeV, p is 50 MeV/c.

So, k = p/(ħ) → but wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think in terms of units.

We know that k (wave number) has units of 1/fm. We also know that ħ has units of MeV·fm. So ħ c has units of MeV·fm * (velocity of light in fm/s) → but velocity of light is c ≈ 3e8 m/s. To get units right, perhaps it's better to use natural units where c=1.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach is better. The wave number k is given by k = p/(ħ c). Let's compute p as E/c for high energy.

Wait, no, wait. For high energies, E ≈ pc → p ≈ E/c. So p = E/(c).

But units wise, E is in MeV, and c is in fm per femtosecond? Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute k in terms of E.

Wait, perhaps using the relation k = (E)/(ħ c). Let me see.

Wait, if E is in MeV, ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm. So k = E/(ħ c) → (50 MeV) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) = 50/(197.33) fm^-1.

Compute that: 50 / 197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

Wait, but wait. Because E is the kinetic energy or the total energy? Wait, in the relativistic case, E is the total energy, which is much larger than m c², so E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ) ≈ pc → p ≈ E/(c).

So, perhaps k = p/(ħ c) = (E/(c)) / (ħ c) ) = E/( ħ c^2 )? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps k = ( E ) / ( ħ c ), because p = E/c, and k = p/(ħ) → (E/(c)) / ħ = E/( ħ c ). Which would make k in units of 1/(fm), since ħ c is in MeV fm.

So, E=50 MeV. Therefore, k = 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) ) = 50 /197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

So, k ≈ 0.253 fm^-1.

But wait, perhaps I should double-check this.

Wait, let's compute pc: E = 50 MeV. For relativistic particles, E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). Since m c^2 is 0.511 MeV, and E=50 MeV >> m c^2, so E ≈ pc → pc ≈50 MeV.

So p = (50 MeV) / c.

Then, k = p/(ħ) → (50 MeV/c) / ħ.

But ħ is in J·s, so perhaps I need to convert units.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find the expression for k in terms of E using natural units. In natural units where ħ = c =1, then E (in MeV) equals the momentum p (in MeV), and the wave number k is p/(ħ) → but with ħ=1, so k = p = E.

But in actual units, k is p/(ħ c) → because in natural units, ħ c =1, so k (in 1/fm) would be E (MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → the same as 50/197.33 ≈0.253 fm^-1.

So, k ≈0.253 fm^-1.

Now, back to the imaginary part of f(0):

Im(f(0))= (- S_real) / (2k).

We have S_real≈8.4324.

So Im(f(0))= (-8.4324)/(2 * 0.253).

Compute denominator: 2 *0.253=0.506.

So 8.4324 / 0.506 ≈ let's compute that.

8.4324 ÷ 0.506 → let's see, 0.506 * 16 = 8.096. 8.4324-8.096=0.3364.

0.506 * 0.664 ≈ 0.336. So approximately 16.664.

But since it's negative, Im(f(0))≈-16.664 fm.

Wait, that can't be right because the options are in the hundreds. Did I make a miscalculation somewhere?

Wait, wait. Hold on, perhaps the calculation of S_real is wrong. Let me recalculate each term.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in computing the term for l=1. Let me recheck each term.

Recomputing each term:

l=0: (2l+1)=1, δ=90°.

cos(90)=0. sin(90)=1. So term is 1 *0 *1=0.

l=1:

(2*1+1)=3.

cos(67)= approx 0.3907.

sin(67)=0.9205.

So term=3 * 0.3907 * 0.9205.

Compute 0.3907 *0.9205.

0.39 *0.92 = 0.359. 0.0007 *0.92=0.000644. 0.39 *0.0005=0.000195. 0.0007 *0.0005≈0.00000035.

So sum: 0.359 + 0.000644 + 0.000195 + 0.00000035 ≈0.35984.

Multiply by 3: ~1.0795.

l=2: (2*2+1)=5; δ=55°.

cos(55)=~0.5736.

sin(55)=~0.8192.

Term=5 *0.5736 *0.8192.

Compute 0.5736 *0.8192.

0.5 *0.8=0.4; 0.5 *0.0192=0.0096. 0.0736 *0.8=0.05888. 0.0736 *0.0192=0.00141.

So adding up: 0.4 +0.0096=0.4096; +0.05888=0.46848; +0.00141=0.46989.

Multiply by 5: ~2.34945.

l=3: (2*3+1)=7; δ=30°.

cos(30)=√3/2≈0.8660.

sin(30)=0.5.

Term=7 *0.8660 *0.5 =7 *0.433 =3.031.

l=4: (2*4+1)=9; δ=13°.

cos(13)=~0.9744.

sin(13)=~0.22495.

Term=9 *0.9744 *0.22495.

Compute 0.9744 *0.22495.

0.9 *0.22495=0.202455. 0.0744 *0.22495≈0.01674. So total ≈0.202455 +0.01674≈0.219195.

Multiply by9: ≈1.972755.

Now summing all terms:

0 (l=0) +1.0795 (l=1)=1.0795.

+2.34945 (l=2)=3.42895.

+3.031 (l=3)=6.45995.

+1.972755 (l=4)=8.432705.

So S_real≈8.4327.

Now, the denominator is 2k = 2*0.253 fm⁻¹ = 0.506 fm⁻¹.

So Im(f(0)) = (-8.4327) / (0.506) ≈ -16.66 (approx).

Wait, but the options are in the range of hundreds. So something's wrong. Maybe I messed up the formula for the scattering amplitude.

Wait, maybe I should have considered that the formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l). At θ=0, this becomes (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l).

But earlier I thought that the imaginary part would be ( - S_real )/(2k ), but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me go back to the expression for f(0):

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * [ sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l ].

Let me write e^{i δ_l} = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l.

So each term is (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l ].

Therefore, summing over l, the sum S is S_real + i S_imag, where S_real = sum (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l and S_imag = sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

So f(0) = [ S_real + i S_imag ] / (2ik ).

But 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k), so:

f(0) = [ S_real + i S_imag ] * (-i)/(2k) )

Multiply numerator:

= [ -i S_real - i^2 S_imag ] / (2k )

i^2 is -1, so:

= [ -i S_real + S_imag ] / (2k )

So,

f(0) = [ S_imag - i S_real ] / (2k )

Which means the real part is S_imag/(2k ), and the imaginary part is (- S_real )/(2k ).

Wait, so the imaginary part is Im(f(0)) = (- S_real )/(2k ).

But in my calculation, S_real is about 8.4327. So Im(f(0)) would be -8.4327/(2k ), which with k=0.253 fm⁻¹, is -8.4327/(0.506 ) ≈ -16.66 fm.

But the options are in the hundreds. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for the scattering amplitude. Another possibility is that the phase shifts are given in degrees, but perhaps I should have converted them to radians.

Wait, right! The phase shifts are in degrees, but when calculating trigonometric functions, they must be converted to radians.

So I should have converted each δ_l from degrees to radians before computing cos and sin.

Ah, I see. That's a crucial mistake. So let me redo the calculations with δ_l in radians.

So, step by step: convert each δ_l to radians.

l=0: 90° → π/2 radians ≈1.5708 rad.

l=1:67° → 67 * π/180 ≈1.16937 rad.

l=2:55° →55 * π/180 ≈0.95993 rad.

l=3:30°→π/6≈0.5236 rad.

l=4:13° →13 * π/180≈0.2269 rad.

Now, compute each term again with these radian values.

l=0:

cos(1.5708)=0, sin(1.5708)=1.

Term: 1 * 0 * 1=0.

l=1:

cos(1.16937)= approximately: cos(67°) as 0.3907.

But let me compute more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator.

Wait, but I have to proceed mentally. Well, 67 degrees is 1.16937 radians.

cos(1.16937) ≈0.3907.

sin(1.16937)= approximately 0.9205.

So term=3 * 0.3907 * 0.9205 ≈1.0795.

l=2: 55°=0.95993 rad.

cos(0.95993) ≈0.5736.

sin(0.95993)≈0.8192.

Term=5 *0.5736 *0.8192≈2.34945.

l=3:30°=0.5236 rad.

cos=0.8660, sin=0.5.

Term=7 *0.8660 *0.5=3.031.

l=4:13°=0.2269 rad.

cos≈0.9744, sin≈0.22495.

Term=9 *0.9744 *0.22495≈1.97275.

So summing all terms: 0 +1.0795 +2.34945 +3.031 +1.97275 ≈8.4327.

So S_real remains the same, about 8.4327.

But wait, why? Because the trigonometric functions are the same whether in degrees or radians? No, that's not correct. The functions have different values when computed in different units.

Wait, no, the functions' values are different. Wait, I'm confused. Because in the earlier steps, I used degrees when computing the cos and sin. But if I use radians, the values change.

Wait, wait! That's the mistake. I should have converted the angles to radians before calculating cos and sin.

So, let's recompute the terms using radians.

Because for l=1, for example, 67 degrees is about 1.16937 radians, and cos(1.16937) is approximately 0.3907. Wait, but wait, no, cos(1.16937) is actually cos(67 degrees)=0.3907, so it's the same value. Wait, that's correct because in both cases, the angle is the same; it's just that in trigonometric functions, the argument is in radians when using functions like math.cos in Python. So whether I compute cos(67 degrees) as cos(1.16937 radians), the value is the same. So perhaps I didn't make a mistake in the earlier calculation, but perhaps the issue is elsewhere.

Wait, but why am I getting a value that's way off compared to the options?

Looking back, the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm.

Hmm, my calculation gives Im(f(0))= -16.66 fm, which is not among the options. So where's the mistake?

Ah, perhaps I was supposed to use the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, not considering the product with cos δ_l. Wait, no, because the formula for S_real is sum (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is different.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should have taken the imaginary part of f(0) as (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) / (2k).

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivation of Im(f(0)).

Wait, let's go back.

f(0) = (1/(2ik)) * sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l )

= (1/(2ik)) * sum [ (2l+1) (cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ) sin δ_l ]

= (1/(2ik)) sum [ (2l+1) ( cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin^2 δ_l ) ]

= (1/(2ik)) [ sum (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ]

= (1/(2ik)) [ S_real + i S_imag ]

Now, 1/(2ik) can be written as (-i)/(2k) because 1/(i) = -i.

So,

f(0) = [ S_real + i S_imag ] * (-i)/(2k )

= [ -i S_real - i^2 S_imag ] / (2k )

= [ -i S_real + S_imag ] / (2k )

So, f(0) = ( S_imag - i S_real ) / (2k )

So, the real part is S_imag/(2k ), and the imaginary part is (- S_real )/(2k )

So, Im(f(0))= (- S_real )/(2k )

But in our calculation, S_real is approximately 8.4327.

So, Im(f(0))= -8.4327/(2 * 0.253 )

Wait, denominator 2*0.253 is 0.506.

So 8.4327 / 0.506 ≈ 16.66.

But the options are in the hundreds, so this suggests that perhaps the phase shifts were supposed to be summed differently, or perhaps I made a mistake in computing the sum.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing S_real.

Wait, let me recompute each term accurately.

Compute each term (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l, with δ_l in radians.

l=0:

δ=90°= π/2 → cos=0, so term=1 *0 *1=0.

l=1:

δ=67°=1.16937 rad.

cos(1.16937)= approx 0.3907.

sin(1.16937)= approx 0.9205.

term=3 * 0.3907 * 0.9205.

Compute 0.3907 *0.9205.

0.3907 *0.9=0.35163, 0.3907 *0.0205=0.00800485.

Sum: 0.35163 +0.00800485 ≈0.3596.

Multiply by 3: 1.0788.

l=2:

δ=55°=0.95993 rad.

cos≈0.5736, sin≈0.8192.

term=5 * 0.5736 *0.8192.

0.5736 *0.8192=0.4698.

Multiply by5=2.349.

l=3:

30°=0.5236 rad.

cos≈0.8660, sin=0.5.

term=7 *0.8660 *0.5=7 *0.433=3.031.

l=4:

13°=0.2269 rad.

cos≈0.9744, sin≈0.22495.

term=9 *0.9744 *0.22495.

0.9744 *0.22495≈0.21919.

Multiply by9=1.9727.

Sum all terms:

0 +1.0788 +2.349 +3.031 +1.9727=8.4315.

Hmm, same as before. So S_real≈8.4315.

Now, perhaps I messed up the calculation of k. Let me recompute k.

Given E=50 MeV.

k= E/(ħ c).

But ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

So, k=50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) = 50/197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm⁻¹.

So, denominator 2k=0.506 fm⁻¹.

Im(f(0))= -8.4315 / 0.506 ≈-16.66 fm.

But this doesn't match any options. So I'm clearly missing something.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, which is S_imag.

Wait, S_imag = sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Let's compute S_imag.

l=0: 1 * sin^2(90°) =1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67°)=3*(0.9205)^2=3*(0.847)=2.541.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55°)=5*(0.8192)^2=5*(0.671)=3.355.

l=3:7 * sin^2(30°)=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin^2(13°)=9*(0.22495)^2=9*(0.0506)=4.554.

Sum:

1 +2.541=3.541.

+3.355=6.896.

+1.75=8.646.

+4.554=13.2.

So S_imag=13.2.

So f(0) = [ S_imag - i S_real ] / (2k ) → [13.2 -i 8.43 ] / (0.506 )

Which gives real part 13.2/0.506 ≈26.07 fm.

Imaginary part: -8.43/0.506≈-16.66 fm.

But the question is about the imaginary part, which is -16.66 fm. But the options are much larger. So perhaps the formula isn't right.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(s,θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ sin(δ_l) e^{i δ_l} - δ_l ].

Wait, no, that's the optical theorem or something else. I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l).

Wait, but that's what I used earlier.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the electrons are spin-1/2 particles, so the phase shifts are different. But the problem states it's an experiment of elastic scattering of 50 MeV electrons, so maybe the formula is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the sum of the phase shifts, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by the sum of the phase shifts.

Wait, that seems unlikely, but let me think.

Alternatively, maybe the formula for the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k).

So sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Compute this sum:

l=0: 1 * sin(90)=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3*0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

Sum: 1 +2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.02455≈13.382.

So sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ≈13.382.

If the formula is Im(f(0))= sum/(2k ), then Im(f(0))=13.382/(2*0.253 )=13.382/0.506 ≈26.45 fm.

But the options are much larger. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, but multiplied by another factor.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the amplitude is f(θ)= sum_{l} (2l+1) [ (e^{i δ_l} -1) ] P_l (cosθ), where P_l is the Legendre polynomial.

But when θ=0, cosθ=1, and P_l(1)=1 for all l.

So f(0)= sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1).

But e^{i δ_l} -1 = cos δ_l + i sin δ_l -1 = [cos δ_l -1 ] + i sin δ_l.

So f(0) = sum [ (2l+1) ( [cos δ_l -1 ] + i sin δ_l ) ].

So the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which for l=0 to4 is 1*1 +3*0.9205 +5*0.8192 +7*0.5 +9*0.22495.

Which is 1 +2.7615 +4.096 +3.5 +2.02455=1+2.7615=3.7615+4.096=7.8575+3.5=11.3575+2.02455=13.382.

So Im(f(0))=13.382.

But the options are in hundreds, so this can't be right. So maybe I'm missing a factor of k.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l ), which I originally used.

So, perhaps the mistake is that the wave number k isn't 0.253 fm⁻¹, but something else.

Wait, let's recalculate k.

k is given by (E)/(ħ c ). But what's the value of ħ c in appropriate units?

I think ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV fm.

So, k = E / (ħ c ) = 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) = 50 / 197.33 ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l ), not divided by 2ik.

Wait, let me think.

In the Born approximation, the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = ( (2m / ħ² )^{1/2} ) ( (e^2)/(4π ε_0 r) ) ) ... but perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the partial wave expansion.

The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) [ (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l(cosθ) ] / (k (2ik) )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me look up the correct formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin( lθ + δ_l )

Which is what I used earlier.

So I think the mistake must be elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but I used degrees. Wait, no, the question says δo=90 degrees, etc., so they are in degrees, so I correctly converted to radians for the trigonometric functions.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of f(0) is sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k ), without considering the cos δ_l term.

Wait, in that case, sum (2l+1) sin δ_l=13.382.

Then, Im(f(0))=13.382 / (2*0.253 )=13.382 /0.506≈26.45 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should have taken the sum of (2l+1) (sin δ_l ), then multiply by (1/(2ik)).

Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, and then calculate that as the imaginary part multiplied by a factor.

Wait, 13.382 * (something) to get to the options.

Looking at the options, C is 177.675 fm.

Hmm, 13.382 multiplied by 13.26 is about 177.675.

13.382 *13.26 ≈ 177.675.

But I don't know where 13.26 would come from.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k differently, considering relativistic effects.

Wait, the relativistic energy is E = gamma m c^2. So for E=50 MeV, gamma is E/(m c² )=50/(0.511)≈97.827.

Thus, the momentum p is gamma m v. But perhaps for electrons, the relation is p = gamma m v, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, using the relativistic relation, p c = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 )

So p c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) ≈50 MeV.

So p ≈50 MeV / c.

Thus, k = p/(ħ c )= (50 MeV/c ) / ( ħ c )=50/( ħ c^2 ) [MeV/c ] / [ MeV fm ].

Wait, ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm.

So, k=50/(197.33 ) ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

Same as before.

So I'm back to the same value.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is different, involving the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, and the imaginary part is that sum multiplied by something.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the imaginary part of f(θ) at θ=0 is the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l divided by (2k).

Which would be 13.382/(2*0.253)=13.382/0.506≈26.45 fm.

But none of the options match that.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by something else.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the imaginary part is the sum of (2l+1) times (1 - cos δ_l ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the imaginary part of f(0) is the sum of (2l+1) times (1 - cos δ_l ), but no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that I'm supposed to multiply the sum by 1/(2ik), but I'm not considering the units correctly.

Wait, perhaps k is in inverse fermis, but the options are in fm, which is the same as fermi.

Wait, no, k is in fm⁻¹, and the amplitude is in fm.

Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (1/(2k) )

Which gives:

sum (2l+1) sin δ_l =13.382.

Im(f(0))=13.382/(2 *0.253 )=26.45 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, looking at the options, perhaps the answer is option D:251.271 fm.

But that's about ten times larger than 26.45.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the phase shifts for higher l beyond 4 are being ignored, but the problem states to ignore the rest, so I think I accounted for that.

Another thought: perhaps the formula is f(θ)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(lθ + δ_l ), without the 2i in the denominator.

If that's the case, then f(0)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin(δ_l )

= (1/k) [ sum (2l+1)( cos δ_l sin δ_l +i sin^2 δ_l ) ]

So the imaginary part is (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l /k.

From earlier, sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l =13.2.

k=0.253 fm⁻¹.

So, Im(f(0))=13.2/0.253 ≈52.17 fm.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin( lθ + δ_l )

Which is the same as earlier.

So, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps ħ c is actually 197.33 MeV fm, but in this calculation, since E=50 MeV, and k= E/(ħ c ), which is 50/197.33=0.253 fm⁻¹.

But maybe the correct calculation is k= (2mE)^{1/2}/ħ.

Wait, but that's the non-relativistic formula. For high energy electrons (E=50 MeV), the non-relativistic formula isn't applicable. So this approach is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I should use the relativistic formula for the wave number k.

The relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2 )^2 )

So, p = sqrt( E² - (m c² )² ) / c.

So, p ≈ E/c for E >> m c².

Then, k = p/(ħ c ) → (E/(c)) / (ħ c ) → E/( ħ c² )

But ħ c≈197 MeV fm.

Wait, so:

k = E/( ħ c² ) → (50 MeV ) / (197.33 MeV fm * c² )

Wait, but c is the speed of light, which in fm units is c ≈ 3e8 m/s. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing units here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take ħ c as 197.33 MeV fm, so:

k = E/( ħ c ) → 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) = 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Same result.

So, I'm stuck. All the calculations lead me to Im(f(0))≈-16.66 fm or around 26 fm, but the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians instead of degrees. Let me try that.

If the phase shifts are in radians, which would be a mistake because the question states degrees, but let me see.

For example, δ₀=90 radians is about 5156 degrees, which is impossible. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I should have kept everything in degrees, but that's incorrect because trigonometric functions in math expect radians.

Hmm.

Another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) (1 - cos δ_l) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, sum (2l+1) (1 - cos δ_l ) for l=0 to4.

l=0:1*(1-0)=1.

l=1:3*(1-0.3907)=3*0.6093≈1.8279.

l=2:5*(1-0.5736)=5*0.4264=2.132.

l=3:7*(1-0.8660)=7*0.134≈0.938.

l=4:9*(1-0.9744)=9*0.0256≈0.2304.

Sum:1+1.8279=2.8279+2.132=4.9599+0.938=5.8979+0.2304≈6.1283.

If the formula is Im(f(0))= 6.1283/(2k )=6.1283/(0.506 )≈12.11 fm.

Still not matching options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute all the terms again, but considering that the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l )/(2ik ), and then take the imaginary part.

Wait, let me compute the sum more accurately.

The sum S = sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Each term is (2l+1) [ cos δ_l + i sin δ_l ] sin δ_l = (2l+1) [ cos δ_l sin δ_l + i sin² δ_l ]

So the sum S is S_real + i S_imag.

S_real is sum (2l+1) cos δ_l sin δ_l → 8.4327.

S_imag is sum (2l+1) sin² δ_l →13.2.

Then, f(0) = (S_real + i S_imag )/(2ik )

= (8.4327 + i 13.2 ) / ( 2i *0.253 )

Denominator: 2i *0.253 → 0.506 i.

So, f(0) = (8.4327 + i 13.2 ) / (0.506 i )

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i to rationalize:

= [ (8.4327 + i 13.2 ) * (-i) ] / (0.506 * i * (-i) )

Denominator: i*(-i)= -i² =1.

So denominator is 0.506 *1 =0.506.

Numerator:

8.4327*(-i ) + i 13.2 * (-i )

= -8.4327 i -13.2 i².

i²= -1, so:

= -8.4327 i +13.2.

So, f(0) = (13.2 -8.4327 i ) /0.506.

Which can be written as 13.2/0.506 - i (8.4327/0.506 )

So, real part is 13.2/0.506 ≈26.08 fm.

Imaginary part is -8.4327/0.506 ≈-16.66 fm.

But the options are in the hundreds, so this is frustrating.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ)= (1/k) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin( lθ + δ_l ), without the 2i in the denominator.

In that case, f(0) = (1/k ) (S_real +i S_imag )

So Im(f(0))= S_imag /k.

S_imag=13.2.

k=0.253 fm⁻¹.

Im(f(0))=13.2/0.253≈52.17 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, the options are much larger, but perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are in units of π/2?

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by 1000 or something, but that's arbitrary.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by (ħ c )/(2m_e c^2 ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, which is approximately 13.382, and multiply by (ħ c )/(2m_e c^2 ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c )/(2m_e c² )

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, then multiply by (ħ c )/(2m_e c² ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, let's compute m_e c² in MeV. m_e c² is approximately 0.511 MeV.

So if I compute (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c )/(2 m_e c² ), I get 13.382 * (197.33 MeV fm )/( 2 *0.511 MeV )

=13.382 * (197.33 / (2 *0.511 )) fm.

Compute denominator 2 *0.511=1.022.

197.33/1.022≈193.13.

So 13.382 *193.13≈2584.6 fm.

But that's way larger than the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 13.382 * (197.33 ) / (2 *0.511 ) fm → same as above.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c )/(2m_e c^2 ).

So, 13.382 * (197.33 )/( 2 *0.511 ) → same as above.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to accept that the calculation leads to Im(f(0))≈-16.66 fm, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Another thought: perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] sin(lθ + δ_l )

In that case, e^{2i δ_l} -1 = cos(2 δ_l ) + i sin(2 δ_l ) -1.

But at θ=0, sin(lθ + δ_l ) = sin(δ_l ), so f(0)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ cos(2 δ_l ) + i sin(2 δ_l ) -1 ] sin δ_l.

But this complicates the calculation further, leading me to think that perhaps I'm not on the right track.

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct approach is to look for a standard formula or example.

Wait, I recall that in the case of the scattering amplitude, the imaginary part at θ=0 is given by the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l divided by (2k).

Which would be 13.382/(2*0.253 )=26.45 fm.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are given as δ_l, and the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin( lθ + δ_l )

So, at θ=0, f(0)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{i δ_l} sin δ_l.

Which is what I did earlier.

But the result doesn't match the options.

Another thought: perhaps the phase shifts given are in units where k=1.

But that's not the case here.

Wait, maybe the problem is to calculate the imaginary part of f(0), which is Im(f(0))= sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l )/(2k )

Which would be 13.382/(2*0.253 )=26.45 fm.

But again, not matching options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ)= sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1 ) P_l (cosθ )

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0)= sum (2l+1) (e^{i δ_l} -1 )

The imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which is 13.382.

But the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps the formula is f(θ) = [ (e^{i δ} -1 ) ] / (something )

But I'm not getting anywhere.

Perhaps it's time to look for alternative approaches.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the imaginary part is given by the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by (2l+1) and divided by k.

Wait, but that leads to the same value as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the sum of the phase shifts multiplied by (2l+1), and then multiplied by (ħ c )/(2m_e c^2 ).

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the differential cross-section, which is |f(θ)|², but the problem specifically asks for the imaginary part.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the unit conversion for k. Let me double-check.

k is given by (E)/(ħ c )

E=50 MeV.

ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

k=50/197.33 ≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

But what if I used E=50 MeV, but in a different unit system? I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate k in terms of inverse meters instead of inverse femtometers, but that would make k extremely small, which doesn't help.

Alternatively, perhaps the wave number k is given by the relativistic formula k= sqrt( (E/(ħ c ))^2 - (m c/(ħ ))^2 )

Wait, but that's the same as p/(ħ )=k, where p=E/c.

Wait, no, that's the same as before.

Hmm.

At this point, I think I've exhausted all possibilities and can't reconcile the calculated value with the given options. But since the options are much larger, perhaps I missed a factor of 1000 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (ħ c )/(2m_e c^2 )

Which would give:

13.382 * (197.33 ) / (2 *0.511 ) → 13.382 * 197.33 ≈2644.6; 2644.6 /1.022≈2588 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the factor is (ħ c )/(m_e c^2 ), which is 197.33 /0.511≈386.2.

So 13.382 *386.2≈5155 fm.

No.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (ħ c )/(m_e c^2 )

Which would be 13.382 * (197.33 )/0.511 ≈13.382 *386.2≈5155 fm.

But the options don't have this.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (ħ c )/(2 m_e c^2 )

Which is 13.382 * (197.33 )/(2 *0.511 ) → same as earlier.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c )/(2 m_e c^2 )

Which would be 13.382 * (197.33 )/(2 *0.511 ) → same as before.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c )/(m_e c^2 )

Which is 13.382 * (197.33 )/0.511 →13.382 *386.2≈5155 fm.

No.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the non-relativistic formula for k.

Non-relativistic k= sqrt(2 m E )/ ħ.

But E=50 MeV.

Convert E into Joules: 50 MeV =50e6 eV =50e6 *1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.

m_e=9.109e-31 kg.

k= sqrt(2 * m_e * E ) / ħ.

Compute numerator: sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-13 J )

= sqrt( 2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 ) = sqrt(1.458e-43 ) ≈1.207e-21 m⁻¹.

Denominator: ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k=1.207e-21 /1.0545718e-34 ≈1.144e13 m⁻¹=1.144e7 fm⁻¹.

Hmm, this would make Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l /k → 13.382/(1.144e7 )≈1.17e-6 fm.

Which is way too small.

So, this approach is incorrect.

Hmm.

I think I've tried all the possible approaches I can think of, but none lead me to the options given. Perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Looking at the options, the closest I have to 26 fm is not present. The options are around 177 fm (option C), 251 fm (option D), etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of S_real.

Wait, let me recalculate S_real with more accurate trigonometric values.

Compute each term precisely:

l=0: 1 * cos(90) * sin(90)=0.

l=1:3 * cos(67°)* sin(67°)

cos(67°)=0.3907311284892737.

sin(67°)=0.9205048534524406.

So term=3 *0.390731128 *0.920504853=3*(0.390731128 *0.920504853 )=3*(0.359586226 )=1.07875868.

l=2:5 * cos(55°)* sin(55°)

cos(55)=0.5735764363510587.

sin(55)=0.8191520442790231.

term=5 *0.573576436 *0.819152044=5*(0.469844234 )=2.34922117.

l=3:7 * cos(30°)* sin(30°)

cos(30)=√3/2=0.8660254037844386.

sin(30)=0.5.

term=7 *0.86602540378 *0.5=7 *0.43301270189=3.031088913.

l=4:9 * cos(13°)* sin(13°)

cos(13°)=0.9743700647852352.

sin(13°)=0.2249510543538656.

term=9 *0.97437006478 *0.22495105435=9*(0.219215943 )=1.972943487.

Now, sum all terms:

0 +1.07875868=1.07875868 +2.34922117=3.42797985 +3.031088913=6.45906876 +1.972943487=8.431912247.

So S_real=8.431912247.

Then, Im(f(0))= -8.431912247/(2k )= -8.431912247/(2 *0.253 )= -8.431912247/0.506≈-16.66 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum ( (2l+1) sin δ_l ) →13.382, and multiplied by (ħ c )/(2 m_e c^2 ) →13.382 * (197.33 )/(2 *0.511 )≈13.382 *193.13 →13.382 *193=2588 fm.

But that's option A:87163 fm? No, it's much larger.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by (ħ c )/( m_e c^2 ) →13.382 * (197.33 )/0.511≈13.382 *386.2 →13.382 *386≈5155 fm.

But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (ħ c )/( m_e c^2 ) → same as above.

Hmm.

Given that I can't reconcile my calculation with the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. But since I'm stuck, I'll have to make an educated guess. The option closest to my calculation of Im(f(0))= -16.66 fm isn't present. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is approximately 10 times 17.7675, which could be a miscalculation factor.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recalculate k.

E=50 MeV.

ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

k= E/(ħ c )=50/197.33≈0.253 fm⁻¹.

Wait, perhaps the correct k is (E/(ħ c )) * (1e3 ), but that would be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct k is 50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) =0.253 fm⁻¹, which is correct.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different, and the imaginary part is the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l multiplied by (ħ c )/( m_e c^2 )

Which is 13.382 * (197.33 )/0.511=13.382 *386.2≈5155 fm.

But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (ħ c )/(2 m_e c^2 )

Which is 13.382 *193.13≈2588 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, looking at the options, option D is 251.271 fm, which is approximately 2588/10.3≈251.

Ah, perhaps I missed a factor of 1/10 somewhere. Maybe because I used MeV instead of eV somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm, but perhaps it's 197.33 ×1e6 eV fm.

But I'm not sure how that would affect the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is 50 MeV, but I should have used 50 keV or another unit. But that's unlikely.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent and the options available, I think the intended answer is option D:251.271 fm. But I can't see how to arrive at that value from the calculations. Perhaps there's an error in the phase shift approach I took.


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( f(0) \), for elastic electron scattering at the incident beam direction (\( \theta = 0^\circ \)). The scattering amplitude is related to the phase shifts \( \delta_l \) through the formula:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2ik} \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) e^{i\delta_l} \sin(\delta_l),
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number, given by \( k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} \), with \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm} \). The imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is extracted as:

\[
\text{Im}\,f(0) = \frac{-S_{\text{real}}}{2k},
\]

where \( S_{\text{real}} = \sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l+1) \cos(\delta_l) \sin(\delta_l) \).

### Key Steps:
1. **Phase Shifts and Trigonometric Values**: The phase shifts are given as \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). These are converted to radians for accurate computation of \( \cos(\delta_l) \) and \( \sin(\delta_l) \).

2. **Calculation of \( S_{\text{real}} \)**:
   - For each \( l \), compute \( (2l+1) \cos(\delta_l) \sin(\delta_l) \).
   - Sum these values for \( l = 0 \) to \( l = 4 \):
     \[
     S_{\text{real}} = 0 + 1.0788 + 2.3495 + 3.031 + 1.9728 = 8.4329.
     \]

3. **Wave Number \( k \)**:
   - Using \( k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} \), with \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( \hbar c = 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm} \):
     \[
     k = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
     \]

4. **Imaginary Part of \( f(0) \)**:
   - Substitute \( S_{\text{real}} \) and \( k \) into \( \text{Im}\,f(0) = \frac{-S_{\text{real}}}{2k} \):
     \[
     \text{Im}\,f(0) = \frac{-8.4329}{2 \times 0.253} \approx -16.66 \, \text{fm}.
     \]

5. **Mismatch with Options**: The calculated value of \( \text{Im}\,f(0) \approx -16.66 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. This suggests either a missing factor or an error in the interpretation of the formula.

6. **Final Guess**: Based on the options, the closest plausible answer is **D) 251.271 fm**, though the reasoning to reach this value remains unclear.

ANSWER: D
