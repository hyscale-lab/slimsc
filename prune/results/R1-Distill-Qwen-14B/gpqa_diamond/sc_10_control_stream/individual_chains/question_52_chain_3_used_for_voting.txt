Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I should recall some concepts from stellar atmospheres and atomic physics. The photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), which means I can use the Boltzmann equation for the population of energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, what's the wavelength given here? The transition between the two levels is about 1448 Å. That's in the near ultraviolet range. So the energy difference between the two levels would be related to this photon's energy.

Let me calculate the energy difference. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-6 meters. The energy E is hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s) and c is speed of light (3e8 m/s).

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-6) = Let me compute that.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 1.448e-6 m:

E ≈ 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-6 ≈ approximately 1.373e-19 J.

Hmm, but that's a very small energy. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of eV or another unit. Alternatively, perhaps using the relation E = 12400 Å·K / T, but wait, no, that's for the Wien's law. Wait, no, the energy in eV is E (eV) = 12400 / λ (in Å). So 12400 / 1448 ≈ let me compute that.

12400 ÷ 1448. Let me see, 1448 *8 is 11584, close to 12400. 1448*8.55= 1448*(8+0.55)=11584 + 801.4= approx 12385.4. So the energy is about 8.55 eV when the temperature is 1 K? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the formula is E (eV) ≈ 12400 / λ (Å) when λ is in Angstroms. So my calculation gives about 8.55 eV for 1448 Å. But wait, that can't be right because 1448 Å is longer than 1000 Å, which is 1 nm, and E would be 12.4 eV then. Oh no, wait, 12400 divided by 1448 is about 8.55 eV? That seems high. Wait, 12400 / 1000 is 12.4 eV, yes. So 1448 is larger, so E is lower. So 12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.55 eV is correct.

Wait, but wait. The energy of the photon emitted when transitioning between two levels would be E2 - E1 = h c / λ. So the energy difference is about 8.55 eV? That's a big jump. Hmm, but maybe that's correct because Ti has many energy levels.

But wait, in the Boltzmann equation, what's important is the ratio (E2 - E1)/(k T), sometimes called the excitation potential. Because for each energy level, the population depends exponentially on that term.

So the ratio n2/n1 is (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). But wait, wait, actually, it's exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), assuming E2 > E1, so that the exponent is negative, which would mean that higher energy levels have fewer atoms unless T is high.

But wait, for the ratio n2/n1, if E2 > E1, then if T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases. So if the temperature goes up, the ratio n2/n1 would increase, because higher T makes more atoms have enough energy to populate the higher level.

In this problem, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature decreases from 6000 K to 5500 K. The ratio of Ti neutral atoms in levels 1 and 2 (n1/n2) is observed to decrease when the star has spots. Wait, wait, the question says that the ratio of n1/n2 (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the photospheric temperature is lower, and the ratio n1/n2 is lower. Which suggests that the ratio is lower when T is lower.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, if T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio n2/n1 would decrease. Because exp(-x) decreases as x increases. So if T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponent is more negative, so n2/n1 decreases. So n2/n1 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)), so when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases.

But in the problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K), and the ratio (n1/n2) is observed to decrease. So n1/n2 = (n1)/(n2) = [g1/g2] exp(ΔE/(k T)), assuming E2 > E1. Because if E2 > E1, then n2 is lower than n1 if T is not high enough. So if T decreases, the exponent ΔE/(k T) increases, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, wait, if E2 > E1, then the energy difference is positive, so the ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T) ). So when T decreases, the exponent ΔE/(k T) increases, so exp(...) increases, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. That's conflicting. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-express this. Let me define the ratio as R = n1/n2. So R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Because E1 < E2, so (E1-E2) is negative. So R = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp(-x) increases. Because when you have a negative x, increasing T makes x less negative, so exp(-x) is larger. So R increases with higher T.

In the problem, when the star has spots, T drops to 5500 K. So R would decrease because T is lower. But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio R (n1/n2) decreases. So the statement is correct—when T drops, R decreases. So when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000 K), R is higher. The question is asking for the factor by which R changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. So the factor is R_spotless / R_spots.

Wait, no, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So R is lower when there are spots. So R_spotless is higher than R_spots. So the factor is R_spotless / R_spots.

So to find this factor, I can model R as (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), but wait, actually, I think I have to compute the ratio of R when T is 6000 K to when T is 5500 K.

Wait, but wait. Wait the star's overall effective temperature changes when spots are present. But the question says that the photosphere is in LTE, so the temperature in the photosphere where the Ti lines are formed is what matters. But when spots are present, the overall Teff is lower, but I'm not sure whether the local temperature is uniform. But the problem probably treats it as the overall photosphere's temperature being 5500 K when spots are present. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

So the ratio R = (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

So the ratio when no spots (T1 = 6000 K) is R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

And the ratio when there are spots (T2 =5500 K) is R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the factor by which R changes is R1/R2 = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Because (R1/R2) = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, no. Because (R1/R2) = exp( (ΔE/k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] )

Wait, because:

R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( [ΔE/(k T1)] - [ΔE/(k T2)] ) )

Which is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T1) - 1/(T2)) )

Wait, no, wait: [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] = ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Yes, correct: because R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ]) = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So I can compute that exponent.

So to find the factor, I need to compute ΔE/(k) multiplied by (1/(5500) - 1/(6000) ), and then take the exponential.

But wait, what's ΔE? I can compute it using the wavelength of the transition.

ΔE = h c / λ

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Angstroms = 1448e-10 m.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) )

Let me compute this:

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.373e-18 J.

But to make this manageable, perhaps convert it to eV. Because 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So ΔE in eV is 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.57 eV.

So ΔE ≈ 8.57 eV.

Now, k is Boltzmann's constant, which is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So ΔE/(k) = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 8.57 * 1.16e4 ≈ let me compute that.

8.57 * 11600 ≈ 8 * 11600 = 92,800; 0.57 * 11600 ≈ 6,612 → total approx 99,412 K.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 99,412 K.

Now, the term (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) K^-1.

Calculate that:

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818, 1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667 → difference is 0.000015151.

So 0.000015151 K^-1.

Multiply by ΔE/(k):

99,412 K * 0.000015151 ≈ Let me compute that.

99,412 * 0.000015151 ≈ approximately 99,412 * 1.5151e-5.

Let me compute 1e5 * 1.5151e-5 = 1.5151.

But 99,412 is approx 1e5 * 0.99412.

So 0.99412 * 1.5151 ≈ approximately 1.505.

So the exponent is approximately 1.505.

So the factor R1/R2 = exp(1.505) ≈ e^1.505.

e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, but let's be more precise.

Wait, 1.505 is close to 1.504, which is ln(4.5). Because ln(4) is about 1.386, ln(4.5)=1.504. So e^1.505 is approximately 4.5.

Wait, let me compute e^1.505 accurately.

We know that ln(4.5) is approximately 1.504077.

So exp(1.505) ≈ 4.503.

Wait, but wait, the exponent is 1.505, which is just a bit over ln(4.5). So exp(1.505) ≈ 4.503.

Alternatively, using a calculator:

e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^1.505 is a little higher, say 4.5.

So the factor R_spotless / R_spots ≈ 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the sign. Let's go back.

The factor is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Which is exp( (99412 K) * ( (1/5500) - (1/6000) ) )

Wait, (1/5500 -1/6000) is positive? Because 1/5500 is about 0.0001818, 1/6000 is about 0.00016667. So 0.0001818 - 0.00016667 = 0.00001515, which is positive.

So the exponent is positive, so exp(positive) is greater than 1. So the factor is about 4.5. So R1/R2 = 4.5.

But wait, the problem states that the ratio R (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So R is lower when there are spots, so the factor is higher when there are no spots. So the factor is 4.5, which is option C.

But wait, another thought: when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases? Wait, no, earlier analysis said that R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, no, earlier I thought that R is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), but that depends on E2 > E1.

Wait, I think I might have gotten confused about the ratio. Let me re-express R.

Let me define R = n1/n2.

n1 is the number in level 1, which is lower in energy (E1 < E2).

So, according to Boltzmann, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So when T increases, the denominator in the exponent becomes larger, so the exponent becomes less negative. So the exponential increases.

Which means R = n1/n2 increases as T increases. So when T drops from 6000 to 5500 K, R decreases, which matches the problem's statement that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases.

So when T increases, R increases. So when the star is spotless (higher T), R is higher.

So the factor is R_spotless / R_spots = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, no, wait. Let's plug in the numbers correctly.

Wait, when there are no spots, T1 = 6000 K.

When there are spots, T2 = 5500 K.

So R1 is at T1, R2 is at T2.

So the factor is R1/R2 = [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, but wait, the exponent would be:

(ΔE/(k T1)) - (ΔE/(k T2)) ) = ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Wait, because:

exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b) = exp( (a) - (b) )

So a = -ΔE/(k T1), b = -ΔE/(k T2)

So a - b = (-ΔE/(k T1)) - (-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = ΔE/(k) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, that can't be. Let me compute a - b:

a = -ΔE/(k T1)

b = -ΔE/(k T2)

a - b = (-ΔE/(k T1)) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

So the exponent is (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Earlier calculation: (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500)/(5500 * 6000 ) = 500/(3.3e7) ) → 500 /33,000,000 ≈ 1.515e-5.

Multiply by ΔE/(k) ≈ 99412 K:

99412 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 1.505.

So exponent is 1.505 → exp(1.505) ≈4.5.

So factor R1/R2 ≈4.5.

Which is option C.

So the answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations in energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

### Key Steps:
1. **Energy Difference (\( \Delta E \)):**  
   The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Temperature Dependence:**  
   The ratio \( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \) depends on the temperature \( T \). When the star has no spots, \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and when it has spots, \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \). The factor by which the ratio changes is:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
   \]
   where \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \).

3. **Exponent Calculation:**  
   Compute \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.00001515 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
   \]
   Multiply by \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \):
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99412 \, \text{K}.
   \]
   \[
   \text{Exponent} = 99412 \times 0.00001515 \approx 1.505.
   \]

4. **Final Factor:**  
   The factor is:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp(1.505) \approx 4.5.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels increases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. This corresponds to **Option C**.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question is about a star whose surface is sometimes covered by dark spots. When there are no spots, the effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The problem is about the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels, level 1 and level 2. When the star has spots, this ratio decreases. I need to find the factor by which this ratio changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots.

Hmm, okay. So first, I think I should recall some concepts from stellar atmospheres and atomic physics. The photosphere is in LTE (Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium), which means I can use the Boltzmann equation for the population of energy levels.

The Boltzmann equation says that the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k*T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights, E2 and E1 are the energies, k is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the temperature.

But wait, what's the wavelength given here? The transition between the two levels is about 1448 Å. That's in the near ultraviolet range. So the energy difference between the two levels would be related to this photon's energy.

Let me calculate the energy difference. The wavelength λ is 1448 Å, which is 1.448e-6 meters. The energy E is hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant (6.626e-34 J·s) and c is speed of light (3e8 m/s).

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-6) = Let me compute that.

Wait, 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 1.448e-6 m:

E ≈ 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-6 ≈ approximately 1.373e-19 J.

Hmm, but that's a very small energy. Maybe it's easier to think in terms of eV or another unit. Alternatively, perhaps using the relation E = 12400 Å·K / T, but wait, no, that's for the Wien's law. Wait, no, the energy in eV is E (eV) = 12400 / λ (in Å). So 12400 / 1448 ≈ let me compute that.

12400 ÷ 1448. Let me see, 1448 *8 is 11584, close to 12400. 1448*8.55= 1448*(8+0.55)=11584 + 801.4= approx 12385.4. So the energy is about 8.55 eV when the temperature is 1 K? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the formula is E (eV) ≈ 12400 / λ (Å) when λ is in Angstroms. So my calculation gives about 8.55 eV for 1448 Å. But wait, that can't be right because 1448 Å is longer than 1000 Å, which is 1 nm, and E would be 12.4 eV then. Oh no, wait, 12400 divided by 1448 is about 8.55 eV? That seems high. Wait, 12400 / 1000 is 12.4 eV, yes. So 1448 is larger, so E is lower. So 12400 / 1448 ≈ 8.55 eV is correct.

Wait, but wait. The energy of the photon emitted when transitioning between two levels would be E2 - E1 = h c / λ. So the energy difference is about 8.55 eV? That's a big jump. Hmm, but maybe that's correct because Ti has many energy levels.

But wait, in the Boltzmann equation, what's important is the ratio (E2 - E1)/(k T), sometimes called the excitation potential. Because for each energy level, the population depends exponentially on that term.

So the ratio n2/n1 is (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) ). But wait, wait, actually, it's exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) ), assuming E2 > E1, so that the exponent is negative, which would mean that higher energy levels have fewer atoms unless T is high.

But wait, for the ratio n2/n1, if E2 > E1, then if T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so the ratio increases. So if the temperature goes up, the ratio n2/n1 would increase, because higher T makes more atoms have enough energy to populate the higher level.

In this problem, when the star has spots, the overall photospheric temperature decreases from 6000 K to 5500 K. The ratio of Ti neutral atoms in levels 1 and 2 (n1/n2) is observed to decrease when the star has spots. Wait, wait, the question says that the ratio of n1/n2 (level 1 and level 2) decreases when the star has spots. So when the star has spots, the photospheric temperature is lower, and the ratio n1/n2 is lower. Which suggests that the ratio is lower when T is lower.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, if T decreases, the exponent becomes more negative, so the ratio n2/n1 would decrease. Because exp(-x) decreases as x increases. So if T decreases, (E2-E1)/(k T) increases, so the exponent is more negative, so n2/n1 decreases. So n2/n1 is proportional to exp(-ΔE/(k T)), so when T decreases, n2/n1 decreases.

But in the problem, when the star has spots, the overall Teff is lower (5500 K), and the ratio (n1/n2) is observed to decrease. So n1/n2 = (n1)/(n2) = [g1/g2] exp(ΔE/(k T)), assuming E2 > E1. Because if E2 > E1, then n2 is lower than n1 if T is not high enough. So if T decreases, the exponent ΔE/(k T) increases, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases. So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, wait, if E2 > E1, then the energy difference is positive, so the ratio is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ). So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T) ). So when T decreases, the exponent ΔE/(k T) increases, so exp(...) increases, so n1/n2 increases. But the problem says that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio n1/n2 decreases. That's conflicting. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, let me re-express this. Let me define the ratio as R = n1/n2. So R = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ). Because E1 < E2, so (E1-E2) is negative. So R = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

So when T increases, the exponent becomes less negative, so exp(-x) increases. Because when you have a negative x, increasing T makes x less negative, so exp(-x) is larger. So R increases with higher T.

In the problem, when the star has spots, T drops to 5500 K. So R would decrease because T is lower. But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio R (n1/n2) decreases. So the statement is correct—when T drops, R decreases. So when the star doesn't have spots (T=6000 K), R is higher. The question is asking for the factor by which R changes when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. So the factor is R_spotless / R_spots.

Wait, no, the question says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So R is lower when there are spots. So R_spotless is higher than R_spots. So the factor is R_spotless / R_spots.

So to find this factor, I can model R as (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), but wait, actually, I think I have to compute the ratio of R when T is 6000 K to when T is 5500 K.

Wait, but wait. Wait the star's overall effective temperature changes when spots are present. But the question says that the photosphere is in LTE, so the temperature in the photosphere where the Ti lines are formed is what matters. But when spots are present, the overall Teff is lower, but I'm not sure whether the local temperature is uniform. But the problem probably treats it as the overall photosphere's temperature being 5500 K when spots are present. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

So the ratio R = (n1)/(n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), where ΔE = E2 - E1.

So the ratio when no spots (T1 = 6000 K) is R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

And the ratio when there are spots (T2 =5500 K) is R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So the factor by which R changes is R1/R2 = exp( [ΔE/(k)] (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Because (R1/R2) = [exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ] = exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, no. Because (R1/R2) = exp( (ΔE/k) [ (1/T2) - (1/T1) ] )

Wait, because:

R1 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T1) )

R2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T2) )

So R1/R2 = exp( [ΔE/(k T1)] - [ΔE/(k T2)] ) )

Which is exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T1) - 1/(T2)) )

Wait, no, wait: [ -ΔE/(k T1) ] - [ -ΔE/(k T2) ] = ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

Yes, correct: because R1/R2 = exp( [ -ΔE/(k T1) + ΔE/(k T2) ]) = exp(ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

So I can compute that exponent.

So to find the factor, I need to compute ΔE/(k) multiplied by (1/(5500) - 1/(6000) ), and then take the exponential.

But wait, what's ΔE? I can compute it using the wavelength of the transition.

ΔE = h c / λ

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Angstroms = 1448e-10 m.

So ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) )

Let me compute this:

6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1448e-10 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.373e-18 J.

But to make this manageable, perhaps convert it to eV. Because 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

So ΔE in eV is 1.373e-18 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 8.57 eV.

So ΔE ≈ 8.57 eV.

Now, k is Boltzmann's constant, which is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So ΔE/(k) = 8.57 eV / (8.617e-5 eV/K) ≈ 8.57 / 8.617e-5 ≈ 8.57 * 1.16e4 ≈ let me compute that.

8.57 * 11600 ≈ 8 * 11600 = 92,800; 0.57 * 11600 ≈ 6,612 → total approx 99,412 K.

So ΔE/(k) ≈ 99,412 K.

Now, the term (1/T2 - 1/T1) = (1/5500 - 1/6000) K^-1.

Calculate that:

1/5500 ≈ 0.000181818, 1/6000 ≈ 0.000166667 → difference is 0.000015151.

So 0.000015151 K^-1.

Multiply by ΔE/(k):

99,412 K * 0.000015151 ≈ Let me compute that.

99,412 * 0.000015151 ≈ approximately 99,412 * 1.5151e-5.

Let me compute 1e5 * 1.5151e-5 = 1.5151.

But 99,412 is approx 1e5 * 0.99412.

So 0.99412 * 1.5151 ≈ approximately 1.505.

So the exponent is approximately 1.505.

So the factor R1/R2 = exp(1.505) ≈ e^1.505.

e^1 is about 2.718, e^1.5 is about 4.4817, but let's be more precise.

Wait, 1.505 is close to 1.504, which is ln(4.5). Because ln(4) is about 1.386, ln(4.5)=1.504. So e^1.505 is approximately 4.5.

Wait, let me compute e^1.505 accurately.

We know that ln(4.5) is approximately 1.504077.

So exp(1.505) ≈ 4.503.

Wait, but wait, the exponent is 1.505, which is just a bit over ln(4.5). So exp(1.505) ≈ 4.503.

Alternatively, using a calculator:

e^1.5 is about 4.4817, e^1.505 is a little higher, say 4.5.

So the factor R_spotless / R_spots ≈ 4.5.

Looking at the options, option C is ~4.5.

But wait, wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the sign. Let's go back.

The factor is exp( ΔE/(k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Which is exp( (99412 K) * ( (1/5500) - (1/6000) ) )

Wait, (1/5500 -1/6000) is positive? Because 1/5500 is about 0.0001818, 1/6000 is about 0.00016667. So 0.0001818 - 0.00016667 = 0.00001515, which is positive.

So the exponent is positive, so exp(positive) is greater than 1. So the factor is about 4.5. So R1/R2 = 4.5.

But wait, the problem states that the ratio R (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So R is lower when there are spots, so the factor is higher when there are no spots. So the factor is 4.5, which is option C.

But wait, another thought: when T decreases, n1/n2 decreases? Wait, no, earlier analysis said that R = n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, no, earlier I thought that R is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), but that depends on E2 > E1.

Wait, I think I might have gotten confused about the ratio. Let me re-express R.

Let me define R = n1/n2.

n1 is the number in level 1, which is lower in energy (E1 < E2).

So, according to Boltzmann, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So when T increases, the denominator in the exponent becomes larger, so the exponent becomes less negative. So the exponential increases.

Which means R = n1/n2 increases as T increases. So when T drops from 6000 to 5500 K, R decreases, which matches the problem's statement that when the star has spots (lower T), the ratio decreases.

So when T increases, R increases. So when the star is spotless (higher T), R is higher.

So the factor is R_spotless / R_spots = exp( (ΔE/k) (1/T2 - 1/T1) )

Wait, no, wait. Let's plug in the numbers correctly.

Wait, when there are no spots, T1 = 6000 K.

When there are spots, T2 = 5500 K.

So R1 is at T1, R2 is at T2.

So the factor is R1/R2 = [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T1) ) ] / [ (g1/g2) exp( -ΔE/(k T2) ) ]

Which simplifies to exp( (ΔE/(k)) (1/(T2) - 1/(T1)) )

Wait, but wait, the exponent would be:

(ΔE/(k T1)) - (ΔE/(k T2)) ) = ΔE/(k) (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Wait, because:

exp(a) / exp(b) = exp(a - b) = exp( (a) - (b) )

So a = -ΔE/(k T1), b = -ΔE/(k T2)

So a - b = (-ΔE/(k T1)) - (-ΔE/(k T2)) ) = ΔE/(k) ( 1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Wait, that can't be. Let me compute a - b:

a = -ΔE/(k T1)

b = -ΔE/(k T2)

a - b = (-ΔE/(k T1)) + ΔE/(k T2) ) = ΔE/(k) ( 1/(T2) - 1/(T1) )

So the exponent is (ΔE/(k)) (1/T2 - 1/T1 )

Earlier calculation: (1/5500 - 1/6000) = (6000 - 5500)/(5500 * 6000 ) = 500/(3.3e7) ) → 500 /33,000,000 ≈ 1.515e-5.

Multiply by ΔE/(k) ≈ 99412 K:

99412 * 1.515e-5 ≈ 1.505.

So exponent is 1.505 → exp(1.505) ≈4.5.

So factor R1/R2 ≈4.5.

Which is option C.

So the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the ratio of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels (level 1 and level 2) under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The ratio of populations in energy levels is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where \( g_1 \) and \( g_2 \) are the statistical weights, \( \Delta E \) is the energy difference between the levels, \( k \) is Boltzmann's constant, and \( T \) is the temperature.

### Key Steps:
1. **Energy Difference (\( \Delta E \)):**  
   The transition corresponds to a wavelength of \( \lambda = 1448 \, \text{Å} \). Using the relation \( \Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \), where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), we calculate:
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.373 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
   \]
   Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):
   \[
   \Delta E \approx 8.57 \, \text{eV}.
   \]

2. **Temperature Dependence:**  
   The ratio \( \frac{n_1}{n_2} \) depends on the temperature \( T \). When the star has no spots, \( T_1 = 6000 \, \text{K} \), and when it has spots, \( T_2 = 5500 \, \text{K} \). The factor by which the ratio changes is:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp\left(\frac{\Delta E}{k} \left(\frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1}\right)\right),
   \]
   where \( k = 8.617 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV/K} \).

3. **Exponent Calculation:**  
   Compute \( \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{T_2} - \frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{5500} - \frac{1}{6000} \approx 0.0001818 - 0.0001667 = 0.00001515 \, \text{K}^{-1}.
   \]
   Multiply by \( \frac{\Delta E}{k} \):
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k} = \frac{8.57}{8.617 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 99412 \, \text{K}.
   \]
   \[
   \text{Exponent} = 99412 \times 0.00001515 \approx 1.505.
   \]

4. **Final Factor:**  
   The factor is:
   \[
   \frac{R_1}{R_2} = \exp(1.505) \approx 4.5.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of neutral Ti atoms in the two energy levels increases by a factor of approximately 4.5 when the star is spotless compared to when it has spots. This corresponds to **Option C**.
