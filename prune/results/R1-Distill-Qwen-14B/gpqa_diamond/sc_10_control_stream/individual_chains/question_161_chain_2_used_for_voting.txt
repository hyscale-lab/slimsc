Okay, so I've got this electron microscopy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Mike is working on a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a really high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. Vacuum pumps are connected to create an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment. The pressure is less than 10^-9 Torr. He's doing this to minimize gas molecules because, in electron microscopy, having gas around can cause problems with the electrons—like scattering, right?

But even with all that pumping, some gas particles are still there. They detected them with a mass spectrometer. So Mike calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules in that vacuum state, which is λ1. The mean free path (MFP) is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions. It depends on things like pressure, temperature, and the size of the compartment.

Then, when he starts the electron beam, something interesting happens. The mean free path changes. Instead of λ1, it becomes λ2. But the temperature is the same, so that can't be the reason for the change. The question is: what can we conclude about λ2 compared to λ1?

Hmm, I remember that mean free path is given by the formula λ = (k*T)/(√2 * π * d² * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the molecular diameter, and P is pressure. Or wait, maybe another way to write it is λ = (1)/(√2 * π * n * d²), where n is the number density. Because pressure P is related to n via the ideal gas law, n = P/(k*T).

Wait, another formula I remember is the mean free path λ = (1)/(√2 π n d²), where n is the number of molecules per unit volume. So if n decreases, λ increases, right? Because fewer molecules mean less chance of collisions, so each molecule can travel further on average.

In Mike's case, when the electron beam is initiated, what's happening? The beam is a high-energy electron beam. High-energy electrons can cause various effects in the vacuum. Oh, wait, maybe the electrons are causing gas molecules to ionize or even eject electrons, leading to more charged particles in the compartment. Or perhaps the presence of the electron beam is causing some gas to be excited or even pumped out more?

Wait, but in this scenario, the pressure is already ultra-high vacuum. But when the electron beam is turned on, the gas molecules that are present might interact more with the beam. Wait, but the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules. So how would the electron beam affect that?

Wait, perhaps when the electron beam is on, it's adding more particles into the compartment. Because the electrons could be hitting the gas molecules and causing them to break apart, or perhaps the electrons are causing secondary electron emission from the walls or the sample, adding more charged particles into the compartment. More particles would increase the number density n, which would decrease the mean free path λ.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam doesn't change the number of gas molecules but affects their motion. For example, the beam could heat the gas molecules, but the question states that the temperature remains the same, so that's not it.

Wait no, the temperature of the compartment is the same, so T is the same. Then, λ depends on n and d, and T. Since T is same, but if n increases, λ decreases.

But why would n increase when the electron beam is on? Because the beam is producing more ions or electrons that could cause more gas molecules to be present? Or perhaps the beam is causing molecules to be released from the walls or other surfaces in the compartment, increasing n.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the beam leads to a different situation. For example, in the initial state (before beam), the gas is in thermal equilibrium. But once the beam is on, the gas molecules could be getting excited or even pumped out more efficiently.

Wait, wait, another angle: the mean free path is calculated based on the gas molecules' collisions with each other. But when the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are also being bombarded by electrons. Each time a gas molecule is hit by an electron, it might undergo a collision, which would effectively count as an additional collision event. So from the gas molecule's perspective, in addition to their collisions with each other, they're now also colliding with electrons.

So the presence of the electron beam adds more "scatterers". If the electron beam is on, the gas molecules are not only colliding with each other but also with the electrons. So the effective number of targets for collisions increases. So the mean free path would be shorter than before because now each gas molecule has more things to collide with.

So before the beam, the MFP is λ1, which is based purely on gas-gas collisions. When the beam is on, gas molecules also collide with electrons. So the MFP λ2 would be shorter than λ1. Because each molecule now has more opportunities to collide, so on average, it doesn't go as far before another collision.

So in the scenario, λ2 is less than λ1. So looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but is there a more precise way to model this? Like, can we think of the electron beam as contributing an effective pressure? I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam doesn't contribute much because the electrons are moving so fast, but that's probably not the case.

In electron microscopy, the electron beam can cause various effects, including gas desorption from the sample or from the chamber walls. If gas molecules are being released because the beam hits the walls or the sample, that would increase the number of gas molecules in the compartment, which would decrease λ. So that would also support λ2 < λ1.

Another possibility: perhaps the electron beam causes the gas molecules to ionize, leading to charged particles. These charged particles might be more likely to stick to the walls or the sample, effectively removing them from the gas phase. So n would decrease, leading to increased λ. But in that case, λ2 would be larger than λ1, which contradicts the scenario. Because Mike found that the mean free path was no longer λ1, but λ2. So if it's shorter, the scenario makes sense as the beam is causing more collisions.

Wait, but if the gas molecules are ionized and pumped away, that would lower the pressure, increasing MFP. So I'm getting conflicting possibilities. Hmm.

Wait, the scenario says that the mass spectrometer detected the presence of gas particles, so their presence is due to some residual gas despite the ultra-high vacuum. But when the beam is on, Mike observed that the mean free path decreased. So it's not the MFP increasing, which would be the case if the pressure decreased (since MFP is inversely proportional to pressure). So pressure must have increased or the effective collisions increased.

Wait, no. The mean free path is λ = 1/(√2 π n d²). If n increases, λ decreases. So if the beam causes the density n to increase (maybe because of more gas molecules being released), then λ2 would be smaller than λ1. So that aligns with option C.

So I think the correct answer is C) λ2 < λ1.

When designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope, Mike created an ultra-high vacuum in the sample compartment to minimize gas molecules, as their presence can interfere with electron microscopy by scattering electrons. Despite this, some gas molecules remained, and Mike calculated their mean free path (MFP) as λ1 based on factors like pressure, temperature, and compartment volume. However, upon initiating the electron beam, he observed a change in the MFP to λ2, even though the temperature remained constant.

The mean free path of gas molecules is given by the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \pi n d^2}
\]

where \(n\) is the number density of gas molecules, \(d\) is the molecular diameter, and \(T\) is the temperature. Since the temperature is constant, the MFP depends on \(n\). If \(n\) increases, \(\lambda\) decreases, and vice versa.

When the electron beam is turned on, several effects could occur. The beam may cause gas molecules to collide not only with each other but also with the electrons, effectively increasing the number of collision events. This would reduce the mean free path, as the gas molecules are more likely to collide sooner. Additionally, the electron beam could lead to gas desorption from the sample or chamber walls, increasing the number of gas molecules in the compartment and further reducing the MFP. Thus, the observed MFP (\(\lambda_2\)) would be shorter than the initial MFP (\(\lambda_1\)).

Analyzing the options:

- **A)** \(\lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1\): This is incorrect because the MFP decreases when the electron beam is on, not increases.
- **B)** \(\lambda_2 = \lambda_1\): This is incorrect because Mike explicitly observed a change in the MFP.
- **C)** \(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\): This is correct, as the electron beam introduces additional collisions or increases gas density, reducing the MFP.
- **D)** \(\lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1\): This is incorrect because the MFP does not increase; it decreases.

The correct conclusion is that \(\lambda_2 < \lambda_1\).
