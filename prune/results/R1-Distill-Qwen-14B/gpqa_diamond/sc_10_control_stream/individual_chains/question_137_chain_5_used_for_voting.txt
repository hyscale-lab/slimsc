Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I need to find out how many revolutions a proton makes as it accelerates from negligible kinetic energy to 950 MeV. The question gives me some data: the phase constant Phi_0 is pi/4, and the voltage U0 is 190 kV. The options are A to D, and I need to pick the right number of revolutions.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on synchrocyclotrons. I remember they're a type of cyclotron used for accelerating particles to high energies. The key thing about cyclotrons is that they use a magnetic field and an electric field that alternates to push the particles, making them spiral out and gain energy. But wait, synchrocyclotrons have a different approach because they account for relativistic effects, right? Because at high energies, the mass increases, so the cyclotron frequency changes.

The proton is injected at t=0 with T≈0, so initial energy is almost zero. It undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? I think that might mean each time it goes through the electric field, it gets a kick. Or maybe it's about two acceleration regions? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps each revolution provides a certain amount of energy gain.

The voltage given is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α)t + Phi_0]. The phase is pi/4, so it's a cosine wave shifted by 45 degrees. But I'm not sure how that plays into the problem right now.

So, the key here is probably to find how many times the proton goes around the synchrocyclotron before reaching the desired energy. I remember that in cyclotrons, the time for each revolution is related to the magnetic field and the mass. But since this is a synchrocyclotron, the frequency changes because of relativistic effects.

The main formula I think I need is the energy gained per revolution. In a cyclotron, each time the particle passes through the electric field, it gains energy equal to the voltage applied. But wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the voltage is adjusted to match the changing frequency as the particle's speed increases.

Wait, but the voltage here is given as a function of time. The frequency nu is probably the operating frequency of the electric field, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe nu is the rotation frequency of the proton's orbit.

Wait, the energy gained each time the proton goes through the electric field is approximately equal to the voltage multiplied by the charge. But since the magnetic field is constant, the cyclotron frequency changes as the particle's mass increases relativistically.

The energy of the proton is given as T1 = 950 MeV. Let me think about the rest mass of a proton. The rest energy is about 938 MeV. So this proton is being accelerated to 950 MeV, which is just about 12 MeV above its rest mass. So it's not ultra-relativistic, but still, relativistic effects might be significant enough that the synchrocyclotron's approach is necessary.

Wait, but maybe the problem is designed to ignore some of the complexities. Maybe we can model it using the formula for the number of revolutions, which in a regular cyclotron is E/(q*U), where E is the energy gained, q is the charge, and U is the voltage. But I'm not sure if that applies here directly.

Wait, let me think about the energy gain. Each time the proton goes through a half-cycle of the electric field, it gains energy. In a synchrocyclotron, the voltage is applied in such a way that each time the proton passes through the gap, it receives a kick. But the frequency of the electric field is adjusted to match the proton's changing orbital frequency due to relativistic effects.

Hmm, but the problem gives me a specific U(t) function. The voltage oscillates at a frequency nu, which is probably the same as the proton's angular frequency at each step. So perhaps the number of revolutions is related to the energy gained and the voltage.

Wait, the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach 950 MeV. So maybe each acceleration corresponds to one revolution? No, that might not be right. Or perhaps "two accelerations" is a mistranslation or misunderstanding. Maybe it's that each time the proton goes through the accelerating gap, it gains a certain amount of energy, and each time it does so, it's one acceleration.

Wait, the question says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. Wait, that part is confusing. Oh, perhaps the total number of accelerations (i.e., the number of times it goes through the electric field) is two. But that would give a very small number of revolutions. Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of times the voltage is applied. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is calculated by the total energy gained divided by the energy per revolution. So, number of revolutions N = T1/(q * U0), but considering relativistic effects.

Wait, let me get the units right. T1 is 950 MeV. The voltage U0 is 190 kV. Remember that 1 eV is 1.6e-19 joules, but in terms of energy for a proton, 1 eV is the energy gained when accelerated through a 1 volt potential. So, a voltage of 190 kV would give a proton an energy of 190 keV each time it's accelerated.

But wait, in a synchrocyclotron, the energy per revolution isn't a fixed amount because as the proton's speed increases, the magnetic rigidity changes, so the radius of curvature increases, and the number of times it passes through the electric field per orbit decreases. Or maybe the energy gained per revolution increases? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, each time it goes through the accelerating gap, it gains energy. So if the voltage is fixed, each acceleration (each time it passes through the gap) gives it a fixed energy. But in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage is adjusted so that the protons are always in the correct phase to receive the maximum energy transfer each time.

Wait, but in this problem, the voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos[2π ν (α) t + Phi_0]. The nu here is a function of alpha, which I'm not sure about. Maybe alpha is the angle, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the frequency nu is the same as the cyclotron frequency, which depends on the relativistic mass. But perhaps that's getting too deep into the weeds.

Let me think about the energy gained. The total energy T1 is 950 MeV. Each time the proton is accelerated, it gains some energy. If each acceleration gives an energy increase of e*U0, where e is the proton charge, then the number of accelerations N is T1/(e U0). But wait, e U0 is 1.6e-19 C * 190e3 V = 190e3 eV = 190 keV. So T1 is 950,000 keV, so N = 950,000 / 190 ≈ 5000. But that's a rough estimate.

Wait, but the options don't have 5000. Wait, option B is 5300, which is close. But that's under the assumption that each acceleration gives 190 keV. But wait, wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Because in reality, in the synchrocyclotron, the number of revolutions would be different. Because as the proton gains energy, the radius increases, so the time for each revolution increases, but the frequency of the electric field is adjusted so that each time the proton comes into the gap, the voltage is at the correct phase to accelerate it.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is given by the ratio of the total energy to the energy per revolution. But I'm not sure how the energy per revolution is calculated.

Wait, another approach. The phase of the voltage is given as Phi_0 = pi/4. I'm not sure how that plays in here. Maybe it affects the initial conditions but not the total number of revolutions.

Alternatively, perhaps the time taken for the proton to reach the desired energy can be found, and then the number of revolutions is the time divided by the period of revolution.

But to find the time, I might need to model the energy as a function of time, which could get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can model the energy as a function of the number of revolutions.

In a synchrocyclotron, the time for each orbit is T = (2 pi m)/(q B gamma), where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But as the particle gains energy, gamma increases, so the time per orbit increases. However, the magnetic field B and charge q are constant.

Wait, but the applied voltage's frequency must match the proton's angular frequency for each orbit. The angular frequency omega is (q B)/(m gamma). So, the frequency nu is omega/(2 pi) = (q B)/(2 pi m gamma). As gamma increases, the frequency decreases, so the electric field's frequency must decrease as well, which is why the synchrocyclotron can accelerate particles to higher energies than a conventional cyclotron.

But how does this relate to the number of revolutions?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy gained per revolution can be considered. Each time the proton makes a revolution, it gains energy equal to e*U0, assuming the voltage is applied once per revolution. So if each revolution gives 190 keV, then the number of revolutions N would be T1 / (e U0) = 950e6 eV / 190e3 eV = 950e6 / 190e3 = 5000. Hmm, but that gives 5000, which isn't an option. Wait, the options are A) 1864, B)5300, C)3536, D)2500.

Wait, option B is 5300, which is close to 5000. So perhaps the initial approach is correct, but I'm missing something.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Oh wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me read it again: "undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950MeV." Wait, that's confusing. Does it mean the acceleration happens twice, or that each acceleration step contributes to the energy?

Wait, perhaps it's a translation issue. Maybe it's saying the proton undergoes two acceleration processes—perhaps each acceleration process gives a certain amount of energy. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps "two accelerations" refers to the fact that in each revolution, the proton is accelerated twice, once for each half-cycle of the electric field. So each revolution provides two energy kicks.

If that's the case, then the total number of accelerations would be twice the number of revolutions. Hmm, but then the total energy is 950 MeV, each acceleration gives 190 keV, so the number of accelerations N_acc would be 950e6 eV / 190e3 eV = 5000. If each revolution gives two accelerations, then the number of revolutions N_rev is N_acc / 2 = 2500. Which is option D. But wait, that's a possible path.

Alternatively, maybe "two accelerations" refers to two acceleration gaps in the synchrocyclotron. So the proton passes through two gaps per revolution. So per revolution, it gets two energy kicks. So each revolution gives 2 * 190 keV = 380 keV. Then the number of revolutions would be 950e6 / (380e3) = 950e6 / 380e3 = (950 / 380) * 1000 ≈ 2.5 * 1000 = 2500. Again, option D is 2500.

But wait, why would it have two accelerations per revolution? I think in a cyclotron, the electric field is applied across two gaps, so each time the proton goes around, it passes through each gap once, gaining energy each time. So each revolution would have two acceleration events. So if each acceleration gives 190 keV, then each revolution gives 380 keV. So the number of revolutions N would be 950e6 / (380e3) ≈ 2500. So that would be option D.

But wait, the problem says "the proton undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950MeV." Oh, so perhaps each time it goes through the accelerator, it is accelerated twice. So maybe each revolution involves two accelerations, each of 190 keV, so each rev gives 380 keV.

Alternatively, perhaps the two accelerations are per cycle of the voltage. The voltage is a cosine function, so it goes positive and negative. So each full cycle (2π) might involve two acceleration events. So each cycle, the proton gets two kicks. So the number of cycles (which equals the number of revolutions) would be N = total energy / (2 * U0 * e). So 950e6 eV / (2 * 190e3 eV) = 950e6 / (380e3) ≈ 2500. So that's option D again.

But wait, the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1. So maybe the number of accelerations is two, which would mean N_acc = 2. Then, each acceleration is 190 keV, so 2 * 190e3 = 380e3 eV, which is 380 keV. But that would only give 380 keV, nowhere near 950 MeV. So that can't be right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the problem is saying that the proton undergoes two acceleration steps, each contributing to the energy. So maybe each step gives a certain amount of energy. But I'm not getting the right approach here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the phase and how it affects the number of revolutions. The phase is pi/4, so perhaps that affects the timing of when the voltage is applied, but I'm not sure how that affects the total count.

Wait, another approach: the total phase shift after time t is 2πν(α)t + Phi_0. The number of revolutions would be the number of times the proton goes around, which is the time divided by the orbital period. But I don't know the time yet.

Alternatively, maybe the number of revolutions is related to the energy and the voltage via the formula involving the relativistic gamma factor.

Wait, perhaps the cyclotron equation for the number of revolutions is N = (gamma - 1)/(something). Hmm, but I can't recall the exact formula.

Wait, another thought: In a cyclotron, the number of times a particle is accelerated is equal to the number of times it passes through the gaps, which is roughly twice the number of revolutions (since each revolution has two gaps). But maybe in a synchrocyclotron, this is different.

Wait, let me think of the energy gained. Each time the proton passes through the electric field, it gains energy eU0. So the total number of times it's accelerated is N_acc = T1 / (e U0). Since T1 is 950 MeV, which is 950e6 eV, and U0 is 190e3 V, so eU0 is 190e3 eV.

So N_acc = 950e6 / 190e3 = (950 / 190)*1e3 = 5 * 1e3 = 5000. So 5000 accelerations.

If each revolution leads to two accelerations (as in, two half-cycles), then the number of revolutions N = 5000 / 2 = 2500. That's option D.

But wait, why would each revolution lead to two accelerations? Because in a typical cyclotron, the electric field alternates, so each half-cycle provides an acceleration. So each full revolution, the proton goes through two acceleration events.

So in this case, each revolution gives two 190 keV kicks, so 380 keV per revolution. Then, the number of revolutions is 950 MeV / 0.380 MeV = 950 / 0.380 ≈ 2500. Which matches option D.

But wait, another way: the total number of acceleration events is 950e6 eV / 190e3 eV = 5000. Since each revolution has two acceleration events, the number of revolutions is 5000 / 2 = 2500. So option D is the answer.

But wait, the options don't have 5000 as a choice. Option B is 5300, which is close to 5000. So maybe my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the voltage is applied once per revolution, not twice. Then the number of revolutions would be 5000, but that's not an option. So perhaps each revolution provides one acceleration, hence 5000 revolutions, but that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the voltage is applied once per half-revolution. So each full revolution would have two accelerations, but each acceleration is 190 keV. So total per rev: 380 keV. So 950e6 / 380e3 ≈ 2500.

So, the correct answer would be D) 2500.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in the synchrocyclotron, we analyze the problem as follows:

The proton is accelerated from negligible kinetic energy to a final energy of \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} \). The voltage applied in the accelerator is \( U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi\nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0] \), where \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \) and \( \Phi_0 = \pi/4 \). The goal is to calculate the number of revolutions the proton makes during this process.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Gain per Acceleration**:  
   Each time the proton passes through the electric field, it gains energy equal to the voltage applied, \( eU_0 \), where \( e \) is the proton's charge. Since \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \), the energy gained per acceleration is \( 190 \, \text{keV} \).

2. **Total Number of Accelerations**:  
   The total energy gained by the proton is \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} = 950,000 \, \text{keV} \). The total number of accelerations required to reach this energy is:  
   \[
   N_{\text{acc}} = \frac{T_1}{eU_0} = \frac{950,000 \, \text{keV}}{190 \, \text{keV}} = 5000.
   \]

3. **Number of Revolutions**:  
   In a synchrocyclotron, the proton passes through the electric field twice per revolution (once for each half-cycle of the voltage). Therefore, each revolution corresponds to two accelerations. The total number of revolutions is:  
   \[
   N_{\text{rev}} = \frac{N_{\text{acc}}}{2} = \frac{5000}{2} = 2500.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The proton makes **2500 revolutions** in the synchrocyclotron to reach the desired energy of \( 950 \, \text{MeV} \). This corresponds to option D.

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a synchrocyclotron. Hmm, I need to find out how many revolutions a proton makes as it accelerates from negligible kinetic energy to 950 MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of times the voltage is applied. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is calculated by the total energy gained divided by the energy per revolution. So, number of revolutions N = T1/(q * U0), but considering relativistic effects.

Wait, let me get the units right. T1 is 950 MeV. The voltage U0 is 190 kV. Remember that 1 eV is 1.6e-19 joules, but in terms of energy for a proton, 1 eV is the energy gained when accelerated through a 1 volt potential.

Or maybe the energy gained per revolution increases? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, each time it goes through the accelerating gap, it gains energy. So if the voltage is fixed, each acceleration (each time it passes through the gap) gives it a fixed energy. But in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage is adjusted so that the protons are always in the correct phase to receive the maximum energy transfer each time.

Wait, but in this problem, the voltage is given as U(t) = U0 cos[2π ν (α) t + Phi_0]. The nu here is a function of alpha, which I'm not sure about. Maybe alpha is the angle, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the frequency nu is the same as the cyclotron frequency, which depends on the relativistic mass. But perhaps that's getting too deep into the weeds.

If each acceleration gives an energy increase of e*U0, where e is the proton charge, then the number of accelerations N is T1/(e U0). But wait, e U0 is 1.6e-19 C * 190e3 V = 190e3 eV = 190 keV. So T1 is 950,000 keV, so N = 950,000 / 190 ≈ 5000. But that's a rough estimate.

Wait, but the options don't have 5000. Wait, option B is 5300, which is close. But that's under the assumption that each acceleration gives 190 keV. But wait, wait, I think I'm making a mistake here. Because in reality, in the synchrocyclotron, the number of revolutions would be different. Because as the proton gains energy, the radius increases, so the time for each revolution increases, but the frequency of the electric field is adjusted so that each time the proton comes into the gap, the voltage is at the correct phase to accelerate it.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is given by the ratio of the total energy to the energy per revolution. But I'm not sure how the energy per revolution is calculated.

Wait, another approach. The phase of the voltage is given as Phi_0 = pi/4. I'm not sure how that plays in here. Maybe it affects the initial conditions but not the total number of revolutions.

Alternatively, perhaps the time taken for the proton to reach the desired energy can be found, and then the number of revolutions is the time divided by the period of revolution.

But to find the time, I might need to model the energy as a function of time, which could get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can model the energy as a function of the number of revolutions.

In a synchrocyclotron, the time for each orbit is T = (2 pi m)/(q B gamma), where gamma is the Lorentz factor. But as the particle gains energy, gamma increases, so the time per orbit increases. However, the magnetic field B and charge q are constant.

Wait, but the applied voltage's frequency must match the proton's angular frequency for each orbit. The angular frequency omega is (q B)/(m gamma). So, the frequency nu is omega/(2 pi) = (q B)/(2 pi m gamma). As gamma increases, the frequency decreases, so the electric field's frequency must decrease as well, which is why the synchrocyclotron can accelerate particles to higher energies than a conventional cyclotron.

But how does this relate to the number of revolutions?

Alternatively, perhaps the energy gained per revolution can be considered. Each time the proton makes a revolution, it gains energy equal to e*U0, assuming the voltage is applied once per revolution. So if each revolution gives 190 keV, then the number of revolutions N would be T1 / (e U0) = 950e6 eV / 190e3 eV = 950e6 / 190e3 = 5000. Hmm, but that gives 5000, which isn't an option. Wait, the options are A) 1864, B)5300, C)3536, D)2500.

Wait, option B is 5300, which is close to 5000. So perhaps the initial approach is correct, but I'm missing something.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations. Oh wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me read it again: "undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950MeV." Wait, that's confusing. Does it mean the acceleration happens twice, or that each acceleration step contributes to the energy?

Wait, perhaps it's a translation issue. Maybe it's saying the proton undergoes two acceleration processes—perhaps each acceleration process gives a certain amount of energy. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps "two accelerations" refers to the fact that in each revolution, the proton is accelerated twice, once for each half-cycle of the electric field. So each revolution provides two energy kicks.

If that's the case, then the total number of accelerations would be twice the number of revolutions. Hmm, but then the total energy is 950 MeV, each acceleration gives 190 keV, so the number of accelerations N_acc would be 950e6 eV / 190e3 eV = 5000. If each revolution gives two accelerations, then the number of revolutions N_rev is N_acc / 2 = 2500. Which is option D. But wait, that's a possible path.

Alternatively, maybe "two accelerations" refers to two acceleration gaps in the synchrocyclotron. So the proton passes through two gaps per revolution. So per revolution, it gets two energy kicks. So each revolution gives 2 * 190 keV = 380 keV. Then the number of revolutions would be 950e6 / (380e3) = 950e6 / 380e3 = (950 / 380) * 1000 ≈ 2.5 * 1000 = 2500. Again, option D is 2500.

But wait, why would it have two accelerations per revolution? I think in a cyclotron, the electric field is applied across two gaps, so each time the proton goes around, it passes through each gap once, gaining energy each time. So each revolution would have two acceleration events. So if each acceleration gives 190 keV, then each revolution gives 380 keV. So the number of revolutions N would be 950e6 / (380e3) ≈ 2500. So that would be option D.

But wait, the problem says "the proton undergoes two accelerations in the accelerator to reach the kinetic energy T1=950MeV." Oh, so perhaps each time it goes through the accelerator, it is accelerated twice. So maybe each revolution involves two accelerations, each of 190 keV, so each rev gives 380 keV.

Alternatively, perhaps the two accelerations are per cycle of the voltage. The voltage is a cosine function, so it goes positive and negative. So each full cycle (2π) might involve two acceleration events. So each cycle, the proton gets two kicks. So the number of cycles (which equals the number of revolutions) would be N = total energy / (2 * U0 * e). So 950e6 eV / (2 * 190e3 eV) = 950e6 / (380e3) ≈ 2500. So that's option D again.

But wait, the problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1. So maybe the number of accelerations is two, which would mean N_acc = 2. Then, each acceleration is 190 keV, so 2 * 190e3 = 380e3 eV, which is 380 keV. But that would only give 380 keV, nowhere near 950 MeV. So that can't be right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, perhaps the problem is saying that the proton undergoes two acceleration steps, each contributing to the energy. So maybe each step gives a certain amount of energy. But I'm not getting the right approach here.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the phase and how it affects the number of revolutions. The phase is pi/4, so perhaps that affects the timing of when the voltage is applied, but I'm not sure how that affects the total count.

Wait, another approach: the total phase shift after time t is 2πν(α)t + Phi_0. The number of revolutions would be the number of times the proton goes around, which is the time divided by the orbital period. But I don't know the time yet.

Alternatively, maybe the number of revolutions is related to the energy and the voltage via the formula involving the relativistic gamma factor.

Wait, perhaps the cyclotron equation for the number of revolutions is N = (gamma - 1)/(something). Hmm, but I can't recall the exact formula.

Wait, another thought: In a cyclotron, the number of times a particle is accelerated is equal to the number of times it passes through the gaps, which is roughly twice the number of revolutions (since each revolution has two gaps). But maybe in a synchrocyclotron, this is different.

Wait, let me think of the energy gained. Each time the proton passes through the electric field, it gains energy eU0. So the total number of times it's accelerated is N_acc = T1 / (e U0). Since T1 is 950 MeV, which is 950e6 eV, and U0 is 190e3 V, so eU0 is 190e3 eV.

So N_acc = 950e6 / 190e3 = (950 / 190)*1e3 = 5 * 1e3 = 5000. So 5000 accelerations.

If each revolution leads to two accelerations (as in, two half-cycles), then the number of revolutions N = 5000 / 2 = 2500. That's option D.

But wait, why would each revolution lead to two accelerations? Because in a typical cyclotron, the electric field alternates, so each half-cycle provides an acceleration. So each full revolution, the proton goes through two acceleration events.

So in this case, each revolution gives two 190 keV kicks, so 380 keV per revolution. Then, the number of revolutions is 950 MeV / 0.380 MeV = 950 / 0.380 ≈ 2500. Which matches option D.

But wait, another way: the total number of acceleration events is 950e6 eV / 190e3 eV = 5000. Since each revolution has two acceleration events, the number of revolutions is 5000 / 2 = 2500. So option D is the answer.

But wait, the options don't have 5000 as a choice. Option B is 5300, which is close to 5000. So maybe my assumption is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the voltage is applied once per revolution, not twice. Then the number of revolutions would be 5000, but that's not an option. So perhaps each revolution provides one acceleration, hence 5000 revolutions, but that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the voltage is applied once per half-revolution. So each full revolution would have two accelerations, but each acceleration is 190 keV. So total per rev: 380 keV. So 950e6 / 380e3 ≈ 2500.

So, the correct answer would be D) 2500.


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in the synchrocyclotron, we analyze the problem as follows:

The proton is accelerated from negligible kinetic energy to a final energy of \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} \). The voltage applied in the accelerator is \( U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi\nu(\alpha)t + \Phi_0] \), where \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \) and \( \Phi_0 = \pi/4 \). The goal is to calculate the number of revolutions the proton makes during this process.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Gain per Acceleration**:  
   Each time the proton passes through the electric field, it gains energy equal to the voltage applied, \( eU_0 \), where \( e \) is the proton's charge. Since \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \), the energy gained per acceleration is \( 190 \, \text{keV} \).

2. **Total Number of Accelerations**:  
   The total energy gained by the proton is \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} = 950,000 \, \text{keV} \). The total number of accelerations required to reach this energy is:  
   \[
   N_{\text{acc}} = \frac{T_1}{eU_0} = \frac{950,000 \, \text{keV}}{190 \, \text{keV}} = 5000.
   \]

3. **Number of Revolutions**:  
   In a synchrocyclotron, the proton passes through the electric field twice per revolution (once for each half-cycle of the voltage). Therefore, each revolution corresponds to two accelerations. The total number of revolutions is:  
   \[
   N_{\text{rev}} = \frac{N_{\text{acc}}}{2} = \frac{5000}{2} = 2500.
   \]

### Conclusion:
The proton makes **2500 revolutions** in the synchrocyclotron to reach the desired energy of \( 950 \, \text{MeV} \). This corresponds to option D.
