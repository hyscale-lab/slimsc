Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my special relativity, but let's try to think this through.

Alright, the problem says there are two astronauts. One has a mass of 2m and is moving at 0.6c, and the other is 3m moving at 0.5c, both in the positive x-direction. The question is asking for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system.

Wait, so the first thing I need to figure out is the relative speed. I remember that when dealing with velocities in relativity, you can't just subtract them like you would in classical mechanics. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. The formula is (u - v)/(1 - (uv/c²)), right? But wait, I think I got that a bit mixed up. Let me think. Oh wait, no, the formula is (u' - v)/(1 - (u'v)/(c²)), but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, no, the correct formula is (u + v)/(1 + (uv/c²)) if they're moving in the same direction. Wait, no, no. Wait, if both are moving in the same direction, let's say astronaut 1 is moving at u = 0.6c, and astronaut 2 is moving at v = 0.5c. But from astronaut 1's frame, what is the speed of astronaut 2? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, the question is about the relative speed. So I think astronaut A is moving at 0.6c in the positive direction, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from A's perspective, what speed is B moving at? So A would see B moving slower than him. But relativity complicates that.

So the formula for relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction is (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/(c²)). So u is 0.6c (A's speed), and v is 0.5c (B's speed). Plugging in:

Relative speed = (0.6c - 0.5c)/(1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c²) = (0.1c)/(1 - (0.3c²)/c²) → (0.1c)/(1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.142857c. So about 0.14c. That makes sense. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c.

Now, looking at the options, let's check the first parts. Option C and D have v_rel = 0.14c. So that's our first step.

Next, the total energy of the system. Each astronaut's energy would be their relativistic energy, which is gamma times mc². So I need to compute the energy for each and add them together.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c. Gamma for him is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) → 1/sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So energy E1 = gamma * m_rest * c² → 1.25 * 2m * c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c. Gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 * 3m * c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

Adding E1 and E2: 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². Approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking back at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc² and relative speed 0.14c. Option D's E is 5 mc², which is less. So the correct option would be C.

Wait, but wait a second. Am I adding their energies correctly? Because I used their individual energies correctly. Let me double-check. First astronaut: 2m * gamma. Gamma is 1.25, so 2m * 1.25 = 2.5 m. Multiply by c² gives 2.5 mc². Correct. Second astronaut: 3m * gamma. Gamma is sqrt(1/(1 - 0.25))=sqrt(1/0.75)=≈1.1547. So 3m * 1.1547 ≈ 3.464 m. Multiply by c² gives 3.464 mc². Sum is 5.964, which rounds to about 5.96. So option C is correct.

So the answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system.

### Step 1: Relative Speed
The relative speed between two objects moving in the same direction in special relativity is given by the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \( u = 0.6c \) (speed of the first astronaut) and \( v = 0.5c \) (speed of the second astronaut). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \( 0.14c \).

### Step 2: Total Energy of the System
The total energy of each astronaut is calculated using the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut:
- Mass \( m_1 = 2m \)
- Speed \( v_1 = 0.6c \)
- \( \gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25 \)
- Energy \( E_1 = \gamma_1 m_1 c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m \cdot c^2 = 2.5mc^2 \)

#### For the second astronaut:
- Mass \( m_2 = 3m \)
- Speed \( v_2 = 0.5c \)
- \( \gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547 \)
- Energy \( E_2 = \gamma_2 m_2 c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m \cdot c^2 \approx 3.464mc^2 \)

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5mc^2 + 3.464mc^2 \approx 5.96mc^2
\]

### Step 3: Matching with Options
From the calculations:
- The relative speed is \( v_{\text{rel}} \approx 0.14c \).
- The total energy is \( E_{\text{total}} \approx 5.96mc^2 \).

Comparing with the options:
- **Option C** matches both the relative speed and the total energy.
