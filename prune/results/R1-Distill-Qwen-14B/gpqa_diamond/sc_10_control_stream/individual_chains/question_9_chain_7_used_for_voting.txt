Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about symmetry in molecules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. The options are A, B, C, D, each representing a different compound. I remember that symmetry elements are crucial in determining a molecule's point group, which affects its properties like spectroscopy and reactions.

First, I need to recall what C3h symmetry means. C3h is a type of molecular symmetry that includes a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒh). So, the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation around the C3 axis and also when reflected across a mirror plane that's perpendicular to the main axis.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. I think this molecule has three isopropyl groups attached to a boron atom. Isopropyl groups are symmetrical themselves, with two methyl groups attached to a central carbon. So triisopropyl borate should have a trigonal planar structure around boron. Wait, wait, no, the boron is probably in a trigonal planar arrangement because each isopropyl is a substituent. So the molecule would look something like B with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is identical, so the molecule should have three-fold rotational symmetry. But what about the mirror planes? For C3h symmetry, there needs to be a horizontal mirror plane. Let me visualize this: the molecule is symmetric when rotated 120 degrees, but would it also have a mirror plane that's horizontal?

Wait, the structure of triisopropyl borate is [B(CH(CH3)2)3], right? The molecule is symmetric with a trigonal planar arrangement. So looking from the top (the plane where the boron is), each isopropyl is the same. So a rotation of 120 degrees brings the molecule back to itself. Now, for the mirror plane: if I imagine a horizontal plane cutting through the boron, would that be a mirror plane? Each isopropyl is in a plane, so yes, each substituent is symmetric across that plane. So the molecule should have C3h symmetry. Hmm, but wait, I might be mixing this up. Another possibility is that the molecule is in a trigonal planar arrangement with a center of inversion or other symmetry elements. Alternatively, maybe it's in the C3v point group instead. C3h has a horizontal mirror plane, which might not be present here. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: point groups. The point group for triisopropyl borate. B has three identical substituents in a trigonal planar arrangement. So the point group would be D3h, perhaps, but I'm getting confused. Or maybe it's only C3h, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's in a lower symmetry group. Maybe I should move on and come back.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule. The structure is a norbornane derivative, with a bridge. I think it's a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure. So, does quinuclidine have C3h symmetry? Let me think about its structure. Quinuclidine has a bridge connecting two carbons, and the molecule is symmetric. It has a three-fold axis? Not sure. Wait, from what I recall, quinuclidine has a C3 axis. Because the molecule has three equivalent positions around the bridge. So, if you rotate it 120 degrees, it looks the same. Does it also have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, maybe. If the molecule is symmetric across a plane that includes the bridge and is perpendicular to the three-fold axis, then yes. So perhaps quinuclidine has C3h symmetry. Alternatively, it might have a higher symmetry point group. Wait, my notes say that norbornane (which is similar) has a C2h symmetry, but I'm not certain about quinuclidine. Alternatively, maybe it's in a different group. I'm a bit unsure here.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a mouthful. Let me parse the name. It's a trifuran system, which is three fused furan rings, I think. The substituents are phenyl groups attached at certain positions. The numbering indicates the positions where the substituents are attached. Now, symmetry-wise, if the molecule has three phenyl groups in symmetric positions, perhaps it's C3h. But I'm not so sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a higher symmetry, like D3h, which includes more symmetry elements. But C3h is a subset of D3h. So if the molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would fit.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Similar structure but with different substituents. Benzo groups attached to the trifuran. How symmetric is this? Let's see: the substituents are in positions 1,2; 3,4; and 5,6. Wait, that might mean each benzene is attached to adjacent positions. So the molecule would have a three-fold axis, but are the substituents arranged symmetrically? If each of the three benzene rings is in a position that's symmetric with the others, then maybe there's a C3 axis. But would there be a mirror plane? Alternatively, perhaps each benzene is in a position that allows for a mirror plane. Not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about each structure's symmetry elements.

Triisopropyl borate: three identical substituents around a central atom. So trigonal planar. The point group here is probably D3h, which has a C3 axis, three C2 axes perpendicular to C3, a horizontal mirror plane, and others. So if it's D3h, then it has C3h as a subset. So the molecule would have C3h symmetry. So option C would be a candidate.

Wait, but wait. D3h has more symmetry elements than just C3h. So the question is whether the molecule has at least C3h symmetry. So yes, if it's in D3h, it would have C3h. So option C could be correct.

Quinuclidine: I thought it might have a C3 axis. Let me think about the structure. Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derivative. The structure has a bridge, with two carbons in the bridge. So, when looking down the three-fold axis, are the substituents symmetric? Alternatively, maybe the molecule is similar to adamantane, but I'm not sure about the symmetry. Wait, adamantane has a Td symmetry, which is higher. Quinuclidine might have a lower symmetry. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it doesn't have a mirror plane, so maybe it's only C3, not C3h.

Now, looking back at the options, the question is which has C3h symmetry. So among the options, if triisopropyl borate (option C) has D3h symmetry, then it definitely has C3h. Alternatively, maybe it's even higher symmetry. But regardless, it would have C3h.

Option A is a triphenylene attached to a trifuran. So three phenyl groups attached to the trifuran system. If the substituents are symmetrically placed, then perhaps the molecule has a three-fold rotation and a mirror plane. So maybe it's C3h.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the structure. Let me try to imagine it. The molecule is a trifuran, which is a tricyclic system of three furan rings. Attached to this are three phenyl groups. The numbering suggests that each phenyl is attached to adjacent positions on each ring. So, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold axis, and each phenyl is arranged symmetrically. So, when you rotate 120 degrees, each phenyl rotates into the position of another. If that's the case, then the molecule might have a C3 axis. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is flat and each phenyl is in a plane, then a mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis (horizontal) would exist. So yes, that would make it C3h.

Similarly, for option B: the benzo substituents might be arranged in a symmetric fashion, but perhaps without a mirror plane. Alternatively, their arrangement might not allow for a horizontal mirror plane. For example, if the substituents are in positions that don't mirror each other across a plane, then the symmetry might be lower.

So, which of these options has both a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane?

From what I remember, triphenylene derivatives can have high symmetry. Option A's compound is a triphenyleno attached to a trifuran. So each phenyl is attached in positions that are symmetric, so the molecule would have a three-fold axis perpendicular to the plane of the trifuran. And a horizontal mirror plane that runs through the center of the trifuran. So this molecule would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but wait again. Another point: the presence of a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane would imply that for each substituent, reflecting across the mirror plane would map it onto itself. So each substituent (like the phenyl groups) should be symmetric across that plane.

Alternatively, if the substituents are all the same and arranged symmetrically, then the molecule would have C3h.

So, which option is correct?

Looking back, triisopropyl borate (Option C) is a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents. So it should have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h. So that's a candidate.

Wait, but wait another thing. The point group for a molecule with three identical groups in a trigonal planar arrangement is D3h. Because it has a C3 axis, three C2 axes, a horizontal mirror plane, and others. So any molecule in D3h has C3h symmetry as a subset. So triisopropyl borate (C) would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, option A's structure might have a higher symmetry, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but the question is asking which has C3h symmetry. So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it also has C3h. So at least one of the options is correct.

But wait, the options are the four compounds. The options are labeled A, B, C, D as the answer options, each being one of the four compounds.

Wait, the question's options are given as:

A) triphenyleno...trifuran...

B) benzo...trifuran...

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So the answer would be the one with C3h symmetry.

So, from the analysis:

Triisopropyl borate (C) has D3h, which includes C3h.

Option A is a more complex structure. If it's a triphenyleno group attached to trifuran, perhaps it's more symmetric. Alternatively, maybe the substituents don't allow a mirror plane.

Wait, but if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then perhaps the molecule has C3h. Alternatively, it could have a higher symmetry, but the question only asks for C3h.

So, considering all options, which ones have C3h.

Another approach: look at the options and see which ones are known to have C3h symmetry.

Wait, I remember that triisopropyl borate has a D3h symmetry, so it definitely has C3h.

Quinuclidine has a C2h symmetry as per some sources. Wait, no, maybe it's more accurate to say that it has a C3 axis and a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, I might be confusing it with norbornene. Let me think: quinuclidine has a bicyclo structure, and its symmetry is such that it has a C3 axis. But does it have a mirror plane? I think quinuclidine does have a plane of symmetry. So perhaps it's in the C3h point group.

Wait, quinuclidine has a structure with a bridge. Imagine looking down the three-fold axis. If there's a mirror plane that bisects the molecule, then yes, it would have a mirror plane. So it would have C3h.

Hmm, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think differently. Another way is to look for the presence of a horizontal mirror plane. For a molecule to have a horizontal mirror plane, the molecule must be symmetric when reflected across that plane.

Triisopropyl borate (C) has three identical isopropyl groups arranged around boron. So, each isopropyl is in a plane, and a mirror plane cutting through the boron would reflect each isopropyl onto itself, as they are all identical. So yes, that would be a horizontal mirror plane. So C3h is present.

Quinuclidine: If you have a three-fold axis, and a mirror plane that's perpendicular to that axis (horizontal), then it would have C3h. But if the mirror plane is vertical, then it's a different symmetry.

Wait, perhaps quinuclidine has a C3 axis but no mirror plane. Or perhaps it has a mirror plane, making it C3h.

Another approach: the point group for quinuclidine. I think quinuclidine has a point group of C3h. Because it has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So quinuclidine (option D) would have C3h symmetry.

So now I'm a bit stuck because both options C and D could have C3h symmetry.

Wait, let me think about the structure of quinuclidine. It has a bridge structure, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. So, when looking along the three-fold axis, the molecule has three identical positions. So, a rotation of 120 degrees would bring the molecule onto itself, indicating a C3 axis. Now, does a mirror plane exist perpendicular to this axis, i.e., a horizontal plane? So if you imagine slicing the molecule along that plane, each part would mirror the other. So yes, if the molecule is symmetric across that plane, then it has a mirror plane, making it C3h.

So, both triisopropyl borate (C) and quinuclidine (D) have C3h symmetry. But wait, that can't be, because the question says only one is correct.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps only one of them actually has C3h.

Wait, perhaps triisopropyl borate doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Because when you think about the molecule, each isopropyl group is attached to boron. The molecule is planar, but a mirror plane cutting through the boron would have each isopropyl as its mirror image. Wait, no. Each isopropyl is a chiral group? No, isopropyl groups are not chiral. They're symmetric. So a mirror plane through the boron would reflect each isopropyl onto itself. So yes, that should be a mirror plane.

So, if both C and D have C3h symmetry, but the answer options are four, perhaps the question is referring to a different kind of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate has a higher symmetry, like D3h, but the question is only about the presence of C3h. So, any of those would fit.

Wait, perhaps the question is which has C3h symmetry, so more than one could have it, but looking at the options, maybe only one is correct.

Let me check the options again:

The options are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So the correct answer is either C or D, or perhaps another option.

Wait, perhaps triphenyleno...trifuran (option A) has a C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Let me think again: the molecule has three phenyl groups attached to the trifuran in symmetric positions. So, the trifuran has three substituents, each phenyl in a position that's 120 degrees apart.

So, rotating 120 degrees would bring each phenyl into the position of another. So, a C3 axis exists. Now, does a horizontal mirror plane exist? The mirror plane would have to cut through the trifuran system, reflecting each phenyl into itself. Since each phenyl is symmetric, this should be the case. So, the molecule would have C3h symmetry.

So, now I'm confused because both options A, C, and D could have C3h symmetry.

But wait, perhaps the correct answer is A. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, I should think about the actual structures.

Triisopropyl borate: trigonal planar, three isopropyl groups. The C3 axis is through the boron. A horizontal mirror plane through the boron would reflect each isopropyl onto itself.

Quinuclidine: bicyclo structure with a three-fold axis. The mirror plane would be perpendicular to the three-fold axis, so yes, C3h.

So, if both C and D have C3h, but the question is asking which one of the four options is correct, perhaps the answer is D) quinuclidine.

Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach: perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because it's a more complex structure with three phenyl groups attached in a symmetric fashion, which would give it C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C.

Wait, another angle: the presence of a horizontal mirror plane. For a molecule to have a horizontal mirror plane, the molecule must be flat. Triisopropyl borate is planar, so the mirror plane is through the central atom. Quinuclidine is a bridged bicyclic structure, so perhaps it's not flat, but still, the mirror plane can exist.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because the other options don't have the necessary symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the structures.

Wait, I can't look up, but I can think.

Option C: triisopropylborate. Structure is B with three isopropyl groups. The molecule is trigonal planar. Each isopropyl is symmetric, so the molecule is symmetric across the mirror plane through B. So yes, C3h symmetry.

Option D: quinuclidine. The structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. It has a three-fold axis, and a plane of symmetry. So yes, it would have C3h.

Hmm, but the question is which of the four has C3h. So if both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow for multiple correct answers, then perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should check the number of symmetry elements. For C3h, the molecule must have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, if a molecule has a three-fold axis but no mirror plane, it's only C3. But if it has both, it's C3h.

Another thought: perhaps triisopropyl borate has a higher symmetry, like D3h, which includes C3h. So, it definitely has C3h.

Quinuclidine: I think it's C3h symmetry.

So, given that, the answer would be both options C and D. But the options are given as A, B, C, D, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituents. For example, in triisopropyl borate, all substituents are the same. So, it's highly symmetric.

In quinuclidine, the substituents are all the same (it's a hydrocarbon), so it's symmetric as well.

But perhaps the point group for quinuclidine is C3h, and for triisopropyl borate is D3h.

So the question is which has C3h. Both would have C3h as a subset, but perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the point group of each.

D3h: has a C3 axis, three C2 axes, a horizontal mirror plane, and others.

C3h: has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

So, any molecule with D3h symmetry also has C3h. So, if a molecule is in D3h, it definitely has C3h symmetry.

So, if triisopropyl borate is D3h, then it has C3h.

Quinuclidine: if it's in C3h, then it has C3h.

So, which of the options is correct?

The question is which of the following has C3h symmetry. So, any of them with C3h would be correct.

But the options are four, so only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option A.

Wait, option A is a triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Let me think about the structure. It's a trifuran (three fused furan rings) with three phenyl substituents. The substituents are at positions that are symmetric. Each phenyl is attached to a different part of the trifuran, but arranged symmetrically.

So, if the substituents are arranged every 120 degrees around the trifuran, then a three-fold rotation would bring the substituents into each other's positions, implying a C3 axis. Also, a horizontal mirror plane would reflect the substituents onto themselves, so yes, C3h.

So, option A would have C3h.

But again, this is getting complicated. Perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, another approach: think about the mirror plane. In triisopropyl borate, the mirror plane is through the boron atom. So that's a horizontal mirror plane. The molecule has a C3 axis through the boron and three C2 axes perpendicular to it.

In quinuclidine, the three-fold axis is along the bridge. The mirror plane is perpendicular to that, so a horizontal plane. So, yes, C3h.

So, if both have C3h, but the question is which one, perhaps another factor is the substituents. For example, triisopropyl borate is a borane, which is more likely to have D3h symmetry, thus also having C3h.

But the question is which molecule has C3h, so both C and D would be correct. But since the options are given, perhaps only one is correct and I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual symmetry elements.

Another thought: molecules with C3h symmetry have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, any molecule that has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane that is perpendicular to the three-fold axis would have C3h.

So, triisopropyl borate definitely has that.

Quinuclidine: yes, because the three-fold axis is along the bridge, and the mirror plane is perpendicular to that.

So, if both have C3h, then the question must have only one correct option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual point groups. Triisopropyl borate is known to have D3h symmetry. Quinuclidine is known to have C3h symmetry.

So, if the question is which has C3h, then option D would be correct. Because D3h includes C3h, but the question is only about C3h.

Wait, but the question is which has C3h. So, any molecule that has C3h would be correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to make a decision.

I think triisopropyl borate (option C) has D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. So it qualifies.

Quinuclidine (option D) has C3h symmetry.

So, the correct options would be both C and D. But the question only allows one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the highest symmetry. Or perhaps only quinuclidine has C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate's point group is C3v, which is different. Wait, why? Because in D3h, there are multiple mirror planes, but perhaps in C3v, there's a vertical mirror plane.

Hmm, perhaps another mistake. Let me think: C3v has a three-fold axis and three vertical mirror planes. No horizontal mirror plane. So, if triisopropyl borate has C3v, then it doesn't have C3h.

Wait, but earlier I thought it has D3h. Now I'm confused.

Wait, I think I should recall that when the substituents are in a trigonal planar arrangement, and all are the same, the point group is D3h. Because there are multiple symmetry elements, including a horizontal mirror plane.

So, if triisopropyl borate is D3h, then it would have C3h symmetry. So option C would have C3h.

But quinuclidine: if it's C3h, then it would also have C3h.

So, perhaps the question allows multiple correct answers, but the options are single letters.

Wait, but the question says which of the following molecules has C3h symmetry. So, perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow that.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option D, quinuclidine.

I think I'm stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, no, I think I should make a decision.

I think the correct answer is option D, quinuclidine.

To determine which molecule has **Câ‚ƒh** symmetry, we analyze each option based on the definition of **Câ‚ƒh** symmetry, which requires the presence of a three-fold rotational axis (Câ‚ƒ) and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒâ‚•). Here's the analysis for each option:

---

### **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**

- This molecule also features a trifuran system with benzo substituents at positions 1,2; 3,4; and 5,6.
- However, the arrangement of the benzo groups is not symmetric with respect to a horizontal mirror plane.
- While a **Câ‚ƒ axis** may exist, the lack of a horizontal mirror plane means this molecule does **not** have **Câ‚ƒh symmetry**.

---

- It has a **Câ‚ƒ axis** along the bridge of the molecule.
- A **horizontal mirror plane** exists perpendicular to the Câ‚ƒ axis, reflecting the molecule onto itself.
- Therefore, this molecule has **Câ‚ƒh symmetry**.

---

### **Conclusion**
Both **Option C (triisopropyl borate)** and **Option D (quinuclidine)** have **Câ‚ƒh symmetry**. However, since the question asks for a single correct answer, **Option D (quinuclidine)** is selected as the final answer based on the reasoning provided.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry question about symmetry in molecules. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see. The question is asking which of the given molecules has C3h symmetry. The options are A, B, C, D, each representing a different compound. I remember that symmetry elements are crucial in determining a molecule's point group, which affects its properties like spectroscopy and reactions.

First, I need to recall what C3h symmetry means. C3h is a type of molecular symmetry that includes a three-fold rotational axis (C3) and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒh). So, the molecule should look the same after a 120-degree rotation around the C3 axis and also when reflected across a mirror plane that's perpendicular to the main axis.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. I think this molecule has three isopropyl groups attached to a boron atom. Isopropyl groups are symmetrical themselves, with two methyl groups attached to a central carbon. So triisopropyl borate should have a trigonal planar structure around boron. Wait, wait, no, the boron is probably in a trigonal planar arrangement because each isopropyl is a substituent. So the molecule would look something like B with three isopropyl groups. Each isopropyl group is identical, so the molecule should have three-fold rotational symmetry. But what about the mirror planes? For C3h symmetry, there needs to be a horizontal mirror plane. Let me visualize this: the molecule is symmetric when rotated 120 degrees, but would it also have a mirror plane that's horizontal?

Wait, the structure of triisopropyl borate is [B(CH(CH3)2)3], right? The molecule is symmetric with a trigonal planar arrangement. So looking from the top (the plane where the boron is), each isopropyl is the same. So a rotation of 120 degrees brings the molecule back to itself. Now, for the mirror plane: if I imagine a horizontal plane cutting through the boron, would that be a mirror plane? Each isopropyl is in a plane, so yes, each substituent is symmetric across that plane. So the molecule should have C3h symmetry. Hmm, but wait, I might be mixing this up. Another possibility is that the molecule is in a trigonal planar arrangement with a center of inversion or other symmetry elements. Alternatively, maybe it's in the C3v point group instead. C3h has a horizontal mirror plane, which might not be present here. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: point groups. The point group for triisopropyl borate. B has three identical substituents in a trigonal planar arrangement. So the point group would be D3h, perhaps, but I'm getting confused. Or maybe it's only C3h, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's in a lower symmetry group. Maybe I should move on and come back.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule. The structure is a norbornane derivative, with a bridge. I think it's a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure. So, does quinuclidine have C3h symmetry? Let me think about its structure. Quinuclidine has a bridge connecting two carbons, and the molecule is symmetric. It has a three-fold axis? Not sure. Wait, from what I recall, quinuclidine has a C3 axis. Because the molecule has three equivalent positions around the bridge. So, if you rotate it 120 degrees, it looks the same. Does it also have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, maybe. If the molecule is symmetric across a plane that includes the bridge and is perpendicular to the three-fold axis, then yes. So perhaps quinuclidine has C3h symmetry. Alternatively, it might have a higher symmetry point group. Wait, my notes say that norbornane (which is similar) has a C2h symmetry, but I'm not certain about quinuclidine. Alternatively, maybe it's in a different group. I'm a bit unsure here.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. That's a mouthful. Let me parse the name. It's a trifuran system, which is three fused furan rings, I think. The substituents are phenyl groups attached at certain positions. The numbering indicates the positions where the substituents are attached. Now, symmetry-wise, if the molecule has three phenyl groups in symmetric positions, perhaps it's C3h. But I'm not so sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has a higher symmetry, like D3h, which includes more symmetry elements. But C3h is a subset of D3h. So if the molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it would fit.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Similar structure but with different substituents. Benzo groups attached to the trifuran. How symmetric is this? Let's see: the substituents are in positions 1,2; 3,4; and 5,6. Wait, that might mean each benzene is attached to adjacent positions. So the molecule would have a three-fold axis, but are the substituents arranged symmetrically? If each of the three benzene rings is in a position that's symmetric with the others, then maybe there's a C3 axis. But would there be a mirror plane? Alternatively, perhaps each benzene is in a position that allows for a mirror plane. Not entirely sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about each structure's symmetry elements.

Triisopropyl borate: three identical substituents around a central atom. So trigonal planar. The point group here is probably D3h, which has a C3 axis, three C2 axes perpendicular to C3, a horizontal mirror plane, and others. So if it's D3h, then it has C3h as a subset. So the molecule would have C3h symmetry. So option C would be a candidate.

Wait, but wait. D3h has more symmetry elements than just C3h. So the question is whether the molecule has at least C3h symmetry. So yes, if it's in D3h, it would have C3h. So option C could be correct.

Quinuclidine: I thought it might have a C3 axis. Let me think about the structure. Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derivative. The structure has a bridge, with two carbons in the bridge. So, when looking down the three-fold axis, are the substituents symmetric? Alternatively, maybe the molecule is similar to adamantane, but I'm not sure about the symmetry. Wait, adamantane has a Td symmetry, which is higher. Quinuclidine might have a lower symmetry. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it doesn't have a mirror plane, so maybe it's only C3, not C3h.

Now, looking back at the options, the question is which has C3h symmetry. So among the options, if triisopropyl borate (option C) has D3h symmetry, then it definitely has C3h. Alternatively, maybe it's even higher symmetry. But regardless, it would have C3h.

Option A is a triphenylene attached to a trifuran. So three phenyl groups attached to the trifuran system. If the substituents are symmetrically placed, then perhaps the molecule has a three-fold rotation and a mirror plane. So maybe it's C3h.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the structure. Let me try to imagine it. The molecule is a trifuran, which is a tricyclic system of three furan rings. Attached to this are three phenyl groups. The numbering suggests that each phenyl is attached to adjacent positions on each ring. So, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold axis, and each phenyl is arranged symmetrically. So, when you rotate 120 degrees, each phenyl rotates into the position of another. If that's the case, then the molecule might have a C3 axis. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? If the molecule is flat and each phenyl is in a plane, then a mirror plane perpendicular to the C3 axis (horizontal) would exist. So yes, that would make it C3h.

Similarly, for option B: the benzo substituents might be arranged in a symmetric fashion, but perhaps without a mirror plane. Alternatively, their arrangement might not allow for a horizontal mirror plane. For example, if the substituents are in positions that don't mirror each other across a plane, then the symmetry might be lower.

So, which of these options has both a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane?

From what I remember, triphenylene derivatives can have high symmetry. Option A's compound is a triphenyleno attached to a trifuran. So each phenyl is attached in positions that are symmetric, so the molecule would have a three-fold axis perpendicular to the plane of the trifuran. And a horizontal mirror plane that runs through the center of the trifuran. So this molecule would have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but wait again. Another point: the presence of a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane would imply that for each substituent, reflecting across the mirror plane would map it onto itself. So each substituent (like the phenyl groups) should be symmetric across that plane.

Alternatively, if the substituents are all the same and arranged symmetrically, then the molecule would have C3h.

So, which option is correct?

Looking back, triisopropyl borate (Option C) is a trigonal planar molecule with three identical substituents. So it should have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h. So that's a candidate.

Wait, but wait another thing. The point group for a molecule with three identical groups in a trigonal planar arrangement is D3h. Because it has a C3 axis, three C2 axes, a horizontal mirror plane, and others. So any molecule in D3h has C3h symmetry as a subset. So triisopropyl borate (C) would have C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, option A's structure might have a higher symmetry, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but the question is asking which has C3h symmetry. So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, it also has C3h. So at least one of the options is correct.

But wait, the options are the four compounds. The options are labeled A, B, C, D as the answer options, each being one of the four compounds.

Wait, the question's options are given as:

A) triphenyleno...trifuran...

B) benzo...trifuran...

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So the answer would be the one with C3h symmetry.

So, from the analysis:

Triisopropyl borate (C) has D3h, which includes C3h.

Option A is a more complex structure. If it's a triphenyleno group attached to trifuran, perhaps it's more symmetric. Alternatively, maybe the substituents don't allow a mirror plane.

Wait, but if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, then perhaps the molecule has C3h. Alternatively, it could have a higher symmetry, but the question only asks for C3h.

So, considering all options, which ones have C3h.

Another approach: look at the options and see which ones are known to have C3h symmetry.

Wait, I remember that triisopropyl borate has a D3h symmetry, so it definitely has C3h.

Quinuclidine has a C2h symmetry as per some sources. Wait, no, maybe it's more accurate to say that it has a C3 axis and a plane of symmetry. Alternatively, I might be confusing it with norbornene. Let me think: quinuclidine has a bicyclo structure, and its symmetry is such that it has a C3 axis. But does it have a mirror plane? I think quinuclidine does have a plane of symmetry. So perhaps it's in the C3h point group.

Wait, quinuclidine has a structure with a bridge. Imagine looking down the three-fold axis. If there's a mirror plane that bisects the molecule, then yes, it would have a mirror plane. So it would have C3h.

Hmm, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think differently. Another way is to look for the presence of a horizontal mirror plane. For a molecule to have a horizontal mirror plane, the molecule must be symmetric when reflected across that plane.

Triisopropyl borate (C) has three identical isopropyl groups arranged around boron. So, each isopropyl is in a plane, and a mirror plane cutting through the boron would reflect each isopropyl onto itself, as they are all identical. So yes, that would be a horizontal mirror plane. So C3h is present.

Quinuclidine: If you have a three-fold axis, and a mirror plane that's perpendicular to that axis (horizontal), then it would have C3h. But if the mirror plane is vertical, then it's a different symmetry.

Wait, perhaps quinuclidine has a C3 axis but no mirror plane. Or perhaps it has a mirror plane, making it C3h.

Another approach: the point group for quinuclidine. I think quinuclidine has a point group of C3h. Because it has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So quinuclidine (option D) would have C3h symmetry.

So now I'm a bit stuck because both options C and D could have C3h symmetry.

Wait, let me think about the structure of quinuclidine. It has a bridge structure, bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. So, when looking along the three-fold axis, the molecule has three identical positions. So, a rotation of 120 degrees would bring the molecule onto itself, indicating a C3 axis. Now, does a mirror plane exist perpendicular to this axis, i.e., a horizontal plane? So if you imagine slicing the molecule along that plane, each part would mirror the other. So yes, if the molecule is symmetric across that plane, then it has a mirror plane, making it C3h.

So, both triisopropyl borate (C) and quinuclidine (D) have C3h symmetry. But wait, that can't be, because the question says only one is correct.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps only one of them actually has C3h.

Wait, perhaps triisopropyl borate doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane. Because when you think about the molecule, each isopropyl group is attached to boron. The molecule is planar, but a mirror plane cutting through the boron would have each isopropyl as its mirror image. Wait, no. Each isopropyl is a chiral group? No, isopropyl groups are not chiral. They're symmetric. So a mirror plane through the boron would reflect each isopropyl onto itself. So yes, that should be a mirror plane.

So, if both C and D have C3h symmetry, but the answer options are four, perhaps the question is referring to a different kind of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate has a higher symmetry, like D3h, but the question is only about the presence of C3h. So, any of those would fit.

Wait, perhaps the question is which has C3h symmetry, so more than one could have it, but looking at the options, maybe only one is correct.

Let me check the options again:

The options are:

A) triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone

B) benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

So the correct answer is either C or D, or perhaps another option.

Wait, perhaps triphenyleno...trifuran (option A) has a C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Let me think again: the molecule has three phenyl groups attached to the trifuran in symmetric positions. So, the trifuran has three substituents, each phenyl in a position that's 120 degrees apart.

So, rotating 120 degrees would bring each phenyl into the position of another. So, a C3 axis exists. Now, does a horizontal mirror plane exist? The mirror plane would have to cut through the trifuran system, reflecting each phenyl into itself. Since each phenyl is symmetric, this should be the case. So, the molecule would have C3h symmetry.

So, now I'm confused because both options A, C, and D could have C3h symmetry.

But wait, perhaps the correct answer is A. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, I should think about the actual structures.

Triisopropyl borate: trigonal planar, three isopropyl groups. The C3 axis is through the boron. A horizontal mirror plane through the boron would reflect each isopropyl onto itself.

Quinuclidine: bicyclo structure with a three-fold axis. The mirror plane would be perpendicular to the three-fold axis, so yes, C3h.

So, if both C and D have C3h, but the question is asking which one of the four options is correct, perhaps the answer is D) quinuclidine.

Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach: perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because it's a more complex structure with three phenyl groups attached in a symmetric fashion, which would give it C3h symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option C.

Wait, another angle: the presence of a horizontal mirror plane. For a molecule to have a horizontal mirror plane, the molecule must be flat. Triisopropyl borate is planar, so the mirror plane is through the central atom. Quinuclidine is a bridged bicyclic structure, so perhaps it's not flat, but still, the mirror plane can exist.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A. Because the other options don't have the necessary symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the structures.

Wait, I can't look up, but I can think.

Option C: triisopropylborate. Structure is B with three isopropyl groups. The molecule is trigonal planar. Each isopropyl is symmetric, so the molecule is symmetric across the mirror plane through B. So yes, C3h symmetry.

Option D: quinuclidine. The structure is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane. It has a three-fold axis, and a plane of symmetry. So yes, it would have C3h.

Hmm, but the question is which of the four has C3h. So if both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow for multiple correct answers, then perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should check the number of symmetry elements. For C3h, the molecule must have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, if a molecule has a three-fold axis but no mirror plane, it's only C3. But if it has both, it's C3h.

Another thought: perhaps triisopropyl borate has a higher symmetry, like D3h, which includes C3h. So, it definitely has C3h.

Quinuclidine: I think it's C3h symmetry.

So, given that, the answer would be both options C and D. But the options are given as A, B, C, D, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituents. For example, in triisopropyl borate, all substituents are the same. So, it's highly symmetric.

In quinuclidine, the substituents are all the same (it's a hydrocarbon), so it's symmetric as well.

But perhaps the point group for quinuclidine is C3h, and for triisopropyl borate is D3h.

So the question is which has C3h. Both would have C3h as a subset, but perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the point group of each.

D3h: has a C3 axis, three C2 axes, a horizontal mirror plane, and others.

C3h: has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

So, any molecule with D3h symmetry also has C3h. So, if a molecule is in D3h, it definitely has C3h symmetry.

So, if triisopropyl borate is D3h, then it has C3h.

Quinuclidine: if it's in C3h, then it has C3h.

So, which of the options is correct?

The question is which of the following has C3h symmetry. So, any of them with C3h would be correct.

But the options are four, so only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option A.

Wait, option A is a triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone.

Let me think about the structure. It's a trifuran (three fused furan rings) with three phenyl substituents. The substituents are at positions that are symmetric. Each phenyl is attached to a different part of the trifuran, but arranged symmetrically.

So, if the substituents are arranged every 120 degrees around the trifuran, then a three-fold rotation would bring the substituents into each other's positions, implying a C3 axis. Also, a horizontal mirror plane would reflect the substituents onto themselves, so yes, C3h.

So, option A would have C3h.

But again, this is getting complicated. Perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, another approach: think about the mirror plane. In triisopropyl borate, the mirror plane is through the boron atom. So that's a horizontal mirror plane. The molecule has a C3 axis through the boron and three C2 axes perpendicular to it.

In quinuclidine, the three-fold axis is along the bridge. The mirror plane is perpendicular to that, so a horizontal plane. So, yes, C3h.

So, if both have C3h, but the question is which one, perhaps another factor is the substituents. For example, triisopropyl borate is a borane, which is more likely to have D3h symmetry, thus also having C3h.

But the question is which molecule has C3h, so both C and D would be correct. But since the options are given, perhaps only one is correct and I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual symmetry elements.

Another thought: molecules with C3h symmetry have a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, any molecule that has a three-fold axis and a mirror plane that is perpendicular to the three-fold axis would have C3h.

So, triisopropyl borate definitely has that.

Quinuclidine: yes, because the three-fold axis is along the bridge, and the mirror plane is perpendicular to that.

So, if both have C3h, then the question must have only one correct option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the actual point groups. Triisopropyl borate is known to have D3h symmetry. Quinuclidine is known to have C3h symmetry.

So, if the question is which has C3h, then option D would be correct. Because D3h includes C3h, but the question is only about C3h.

Wait, but the question is which has C3h. So, any molecule that has C3h would be correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to make a decision.

I think triisopropyl borate (option C) has D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. So it qualifies.

Quinuclidine (option D) has C3h symmetry.

So, the correct options would be both C and D. But the question only allows one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the highest symmetry. Or perhaps only quinuclidine has C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate's point group is C3v, which is different. Wait, why? Because in D3h, there are multiple mirror planes, but perhaps in C3v, there's a vertical mirror plane.

Hmm, perhaps another mistake. Let me think: C3v has a three-fold axis and three vertical mirror planes. No horizontal mirror plane. So, if triisopropyl borate has C3v, then it doesn't have C3h.

Wait, but earlier I thought it has D3h. Now I'm confused.

Wait, I think I should recall that when the substituents are in a trigonal planar arrangement, and all are the same, the point group is D3h. Because there are multiple symmetry elements, including a horizontal mirror plane.

So, if triisopropyl borate is D3h, then it would have C3h symmetry. So option C would have C3h.

But quinuclidine: if it's C3h, then it would also have C3h.

So, perhaps the question allows multiple correct answers, but the options are single letters.

Wait, but the question says which of the following molecules has C3h symmetry. So, perhaps both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow that.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option D, quinuclidine.

I think I'm stuck, but perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, no, I think I should make a decision.

I think the correct answer is option D, quinuclidine.


To determine which molecule has **Câ‚ƒh** symmetry, we analyze each option based on the definition of **Câ‚ƒh** symmetry, which requires the presence of a three-fold rotational axis (Câ‚ƒ) and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒâ‚•). Here's the analysis for each option:

---

### **Option A: Triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone**
- This molecule consists of a trifuran system (three fused furan rings) with three phenyl groups attached symmetrically at positions 1,2; 5,6; and 9,10.
- The phenyl groups are arranged at 120Â° intervals, providing a **Câ‚ƒ axis**.
- A **horizontal mirror plane** exists perpendicular to the Câ‚ƒ axis, reflecting each phenyl group onto itself.
- Therefore, this molecule has **Câ‚ƒh symmetry**.

---

### **Option B: Benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone**
- This molecule also features a trifuran system with benzo substituents at positions 1,2; 3,4; and 5,6.
- However, the arrangement of the benzo groups is not symmetric with respect to a horizontal mirror plane.
- While a **Câ‚ƒ axis** may exist, the lack of a horizontal mirror plane means this molecule does **not** have **Câ‚ƒh symmetry**.

---

### **Option C: Triisopropyl borate**
- This molecule has a trigonal planar geometry with three identical isopropyl groups attached to a central boron atom.
- The molecule has a **Câ‚ƒ axis** through the boron atom and a **horizontal mirror plane** that reflects each isopropyl group onto itself.
- This molecule has **Câ‚ƒh symmetry**.

---

### **Option D: Quinuclidine**
- Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule with a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure.
- It has a **Câ‚ƒ axis** along the bridge of the molecule.
- A **horizontal mirror plane** exists perpendicular to the Câ‚ƒ axis, reflecting the molecule onto itself.
- Therefore, this molecule has **Câ‚ƒh symmetry**.

---

### **Conclusion**
Both **Option C (triisopropyl borate)** and **Option D (quinuclidine)** have **Câ‚ƒh symmetry**. However, since the question asks for a single correct answer, **Option D (quinuclidine)** is selected as the final answer based on the reasoning provided.

**Answer: D**
