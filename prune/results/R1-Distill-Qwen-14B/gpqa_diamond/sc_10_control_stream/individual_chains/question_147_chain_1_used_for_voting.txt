Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says: p + bar{p} → 2A^+ + 2A^-. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass energy of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Wait, wait. So this is a particle physics question. Proton and antiproton annihilate into these particles A+ and A-. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can assume that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

First, let me recall conservation laws. In any reaction, both energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial momentum is low. Wait, but the initial setup is p + bar{p}. The proton is probably at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. Or maybe both are moving, but the antiproton's speed is low. Hmm, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the initial momentum is small compared to their rest masses.

Wait, the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², so the antiproton has the same mass. So the initial system is a proton (maybe at rest) and a moving antiproton. When they annihilate, they produce four particles: two A+ and two A-. So it's a symmetric production.

Wait, but conservation of momentum. The initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton, since the proton is at rest. So the final momentum must equal that. So the total momentum of the four particles after annihilation must equal the initial momentum.

But how to calculate the velocity of A? Since all the A particles are produced symmetrically, maybe they have the same magnitude of velocity but different directions. Alternatively, perhaps each pair (A+ and A-) move in opposite directions to conserve momentum.

Wait, let me think about the process. The initial system has a certain energy and momentum. The final system must have the same.

Assuming the proton is at rest, the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton, which is moving slowly — so maybe we can approximate its momentum as much less than its rest mass times c. But wait, the rest mass energy is 938 MeV for the proton, and the antiproton is moving slowly. So its kinetic energy is small, maybe we can treat it as non-relativistic. But I'm not sure if that's allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use conservation of energy and momentum, but considering relativistic effects. Hmm.

Another approach: Because the problem gives the mass of A as 300 MeV/c², which is less than the proton mass. So each A is lighter than a proton.

Wait, the annihilation process p + bar{p} → 2A+ + 2A-. So four particles in the final state. Let me think about the possible energy and momentum.

Assuming the proton is at rest, the initial four-momentum is (E_p + E_pbar, p_pbar), since the proton has no momentum. E_p is m_p c², and E_pbar is also m_p c² (since they're same mass). So initial energy is 2 m_p c².

But wait, the antiproton is moving, so its energy isn't just its rest mass. So E_pbar = gamma m_p c², and p_pbar = gamma m_p v. But since it's moving slowly, v << c, so gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2c²). But maybe it's not that slow, because the mass of A is 300 MeV, which is about a third of the proton mass. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but perhaps the initial energy is equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products plus kinetic energy. Or wait, in annihilation, the rest masses of the products are important. The initial rest mass of proton and antiproton is 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. The total rest mass of the final products is 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. So that's less than the initial rest mass. But that suggests that the initial kinetic energy (since the antiproton is moving) must be converted into the kinetic energy of the products.

Wait, but the initial system's total energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy (which is rest plus kinetic). So E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

Hmm, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma is about 1, so E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

Wait, but the rest energy of the products is 4 * m_A c² = 1200 MeV, which is less than 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. So the initial kinetic energy is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. So that goes into the kinetic energy of the products.

But how to relate this to the velocity of the A particles.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the concept of invariant mass. The invariant mass squared is (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2.

Wait, in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. So invariant mass would be the sum of the energies in that frame.

But wait, the initial system is not necessarily in the center-of-momentum frame because the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving. So initial momentum is p_pbar, so the initial frame is moving.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to work in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. Then, we can calculate the energy and momentum of the system, and set that equal to the energy and momentum of the products.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the initial momentum is p_pbar = gamma m_p v (since the antiproton is moving with velocity v, which is small). The initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

The final state has four particles, each with energy E_A and momentum p_A. But wait, the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving, so its gamma is about 1, perhaps. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but the process is p + bar{p} → 2A+ + 2A-.

Assuming that the final particles are all moving in the same direction? Or maybe in opposite directions to conserve momentum.

But four particles... could they be moving in pairs, like two pairs moving in opposite directions?

Wait, perhaps the two A+ and two A- form two pairs moving in opposite directions each. So each pair has equal and opposite momentum, making the total momentum zero? But that would only be the case if the initial system had zero momentum. But the initial system has momentum from the antiproton, so the final system must have that same momentum. So perhaps the final particles don't have zero momentum.

Alternatively, maybe the four particles are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about energy and momentum conservation separately.

Let me denote the initial momentum as p_initial = gamma m_p v, where v is the velocity of the antiproton. The initial energy E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

In the final state, we have four particles each with energy E_A and momentum p_A. But their directions could be such that the total momentum is p_initial.

Wait, but given the symmetry, perhaps the two A+ and two A- are arranged symmetrically. For example, maybe two particles are moving in one direction, and the other two in the opposite direction. Or maybe each A+ and A- are moving in opposite directions, but then each pair would contribute to the momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps only two of the four particles are moving, and the other two are at rest. No, that can't be because then the momentum wouldn't add up.

Wait, perhaps it's more productive to consider that each A has the same speed, so same magnitude of momentum, but their directions are arranged such that the total momentum equals p_initial.

Wait, maybe all four are moving in the same direction. But that would make the total momentum 4 p_A. But that would require p_initial = 4 p_A. That might not be the case, but perhaps it's possible.

Alternatively, maybe two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, but with a net momentum equal to p_initial.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the conservation equations.

Let me denote:

The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

The initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

The final state has four particles, each with energy E_A and momentum p_A. Because of symmetry, perhaps each pair (A+ and A-) are moving in opposite directions. So maybe for each pair, their momenta cancel each other, but since there are two pairs, the net momentum might be zero. But wait, that can't be, because the initial momentum isn't zero.

Hmm, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps each A+ and A- are moving in the same direction. But that would complicate their momentum sum.

Alternatively, perhaps all four particles are moving in the same direction, each with the same velocity. Then their total momentum would be 4 p_A, and their total energy would be 4 E_A.

So setting:

4 p_A = gamma m_p v. (Momentum conservation)
4 E_A = 2 m_p c² + gamma m_p c². (Energy conservation)

Wait, no. Because the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² (proton) + gamma m_p c² (antiproton). So total initial energy is (1 + gamma) m_p c².

So the final energy is 4 E_A = (1 + gamma) m_p c².

And the final momentum is 4 p_A = gamma m_p v.

So from these two equations, we can find E_A and p_A in terms of gamma and v.

But each A has energy E_A = gamma_A m_A c², where gamma_A is the Lorentz factor for the A particles, and momentum p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

Wait, no. Momentum is p = gamma m v, where v is the velocity. So for each A particle, p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A, and E_A = gamma_A m_A c².

So substituting into the conservation equations:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v. --- (1)

4 gamma_A m_A c² = (1 + gamma) m_p c². --- (2)

Wait, but we have two equations and variables gamma_A, v_A, and gamma (which depends on v, the antiproton's speed).

Hmm, but the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, so v << c. So gamma for the antiproton is approximately 1, because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²). So if v is small, gamma ≈ 1.

So let's approximate gamma ≈ 1.

Then, equation (2) becomes:

4 gamma_A m_A c² ≈ (1 + 1) m_p c² = 2 m_p c².

So gamma_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) ) = (m_p) / (2 m_A).

Given that m_A c² = 300 MeV, and m_p c² is about 938 MeV.

So m_p / (2 m_A) = 938 / (2*300) ≈ 938 / 600 ≈ 1.563.

So gamma_A ≈ 1.563.

Now, with gamma_A known, we can find the velocity v_A of the A particles using gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So gamma_A = 1.563 → 1.563 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_A²/c²)).

Let me compute that.

1 / (1.563)^2 = 1 - (v_A²/c²)

1/( (1.563)^2 ) ≈ 1/(2.443) ≈ 0.409.

So:

1 - (v_A²/c²) ≈ 0.409 → v_A²/c² ≈ 0.591 → v_A ≈ sqrt(0.591) c ≈ 0.769 c.

So approximately 0.77c, which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Did I make a mistake in assuming that all four A particles are moving in the same direction? Because in reality, it's more likely that they move symmetrically. So maybe the initial assumption that all four are moving in the same direction isn't correct.

Ah, okay, perhaps I oversimplified. Let me think again.

If the final particles are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the momentum vectors cancel out for some pairs. For instance, if each A+ and A- move in opposite directions, their momenta cancel each other. So if there are two such pairs, the total momentum would be zero. But that can't be, because the initial momentum isn't zero.

So perhaps the four particles don't all move in the same direction. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe two of the A particles are moving in the same direction, and the other two are at rest. But that can't be, because they have to carry momentum.

Wait, perhaps the two A+ move in one direction and the two A- in the opposite direction. Let me consider that:

Let me assume that the two A+ have momentum p each in the same direction, and the two A- have momentum q each in the opposite direction.

Then, the total momentum is 2p - 2q = gamma m_p v.

But if the system is symmetric, perhaps p = q, but that would make the total momentum zero. But that's not possible unless the initial momentum is zero, which it isn't.

So that approach doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps all four particles move in the same direction, each with the same speed. Then, the total momentum would be 4 p_A = gamma m_p v.

But earlier, with this assumption, I got v_A ≈ 0.77c, which is option A. But one of the options is C) 0.91c, which is higher. So maybe the assumption is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the exact expressions without approximating gamma as 1. Because earlier, I assumed that the antiproton's gamma is approximately 1 because it's moving slowly. But wait, in that approach, I used gamma ≈ 1, which is only valid if v is much less than c. But if the resulting v_A is about 0.77c, which is a significant fraction of c, maybe I shouldn't have made that approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach isn't the right way. Let me think about the rest frame of the proton.

Wait, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. The total energy is E_initial = m_p c² (proton's rest energy) + gamma m_p c² (antiproton's energy).

The total momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

After annihilation, four particles are produced. Assuming that they are all moving in the same direction, their total momentum is 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

But perhaps it's more accurate to model this using conservation of four-momentum.

Wait, the four-momentum of the initial system is (E_initial, p_initial c), where E_initial = (1 + gamma) m_p c², and p_initial = gamma m_p v.

The four-momentum of the final system is the sum of the four-momenta of the four A particles.

Assuming each A has four-momentum (E_A, p_A c), then the total is (4 E_A, 4 p_A c).

So equate the two four-vectors:

4 E_A = (1 + gamma) m_p c²,

4 p_A c = gamma m_p v.

Each A's four-momentum is (gamma_A m_A c², gamma_A m_A v_A c).

So E_A = gamma_A m_A c²,

p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

So substituting into the equations:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = (1 + gamma) m_p c²,

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v.

Dividing the two equations to eliminate gamma_A:

(4 gamma_A m_A v_A) / (4 gamma_A m_A c² ) ) = (gamma m_p v) / [ (1 + gamma) m_p c² ]

Simplify left side: v_A / c².

Right side: gamma v / [ (1 + gamma) c² ]

So:

v_A / c² = (gamma v) / [ (1 + gamma) c² ]

Multiply both sides by c²:

v_A = gamma v / (1 + gamma)

Hmm, interesting. So v_A is (gamma v)/(1+gamma).

But wait, gamma for the antiproton is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can find gamma_A in terms of gamma.

From the first equation:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = (1 + gamma) m_p c².

So gamma_A = [ (1 + gamma) m_p ] / (4 m_A )

We have m_p c² = 938 MeV, m_A c² =300 MeV.

So gamma_A = [ (1 + gamma) * 938 ] / (4 * 300 )

= [ (1 + gamma) * 938 ] / 1200

But we also have from the second equation:

gamma_A = (gamma m_p v) / (4 m_A v_A )

But I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe I can combine the two equations.

Wait, let's express gamma_A from the first equation:

gamma_A = [ (1 + gamma) m_p ] / (4 m_A )

So:

gamma_A = [ (1 + gamma) * 938 ] / 1200 ≈ [ (1 + gamma) * 0.782 ] since 938/1200 ≈ 0.782.

So gamma_A ≈ 0.782 (1 + gamma).

And from the earlier expression, v_A = [ gamma v ] / (1 + gamma )

We can also write gamma in terms of v: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But this seems messy. Let me make some substitutions.

Let me denote beta = v/c, so v = beta c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²)

So, beta = v/c.

So v_A = (gamma beta c ) / (1 + gamma )

= (gamma beta) c / (1 + gamma )

But gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), so let me write v_A in terms of beta.

Alternatively, let's write everything in terms of beta.

Given:

gamma_A = 0.782 (1 + gamma )

And:

v_A = (gamma beta) c / (1 + gamma )

But also, gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_A^2/c^2)).

So substituting v_A:

gamma_A = 1 / sqrt( 1 - [ (gamma^2 beta^2)/( (1 + gamma)^2 ) ] )

Let me square both sides:

gamma_A^2 = 1 / [ 1 - (gamma^2 beta^2)/(1 + gamma)^2 ]

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's substitute the expression for gamma_A.

gamma_A^2 = [ (0.782)^2 (1 + gamma)^2 ] = 1.62 [ (1 + gamma)^2 ]

So:

1.62 (1 + gamma )^2 = 1 / [ 1 - (gamma^2 beta^2)/(1 + gamma )^2 ]

Let me compute the denominator:

Denominator D = 1 - (gamma^2 beta²)/(1 + gamma )^2.

But from gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta² ), so beta² = 1 - (1/gamma² )

So beta² = (gamma^2 -1)/gamma^2.

Plugging into D:

D = 1 - (gamma² * (gamma² - 1)/gamma² ) / (1 + gamma )^2 )

= 1 - ( (gamma² -1 ) ) / (1 + gamma )^2 )

= [ (1 + gamma )^2 - (gamma² - 1) ] / (1 + gamma )^2 )

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 gamma + gamma² ) - gamma² +1 = 2 + 2 gamma.

So D = (2 (1 + gamma )) / (1 + gamma )^2 ) = 2 / (1 + gamma )

Thus:

gamma_A^2 = 1.62 (1 + gamma )^2 = 1 / [ D ]

But D is 2/(1 + gamma ), so 1/D = (1 + gamma )/2.

So,

gamma_A^2 = 1.62 (1 + gamma )^2 = (1 + gamma )/2

Divide both sides by (1 + gamma )^2:

1.62 = (1 + gamma )/2 (1 + gamma )² / (1+gamma )^2 )

Wait, no. Let me write:

gamma_A^2 = [ (1 + gamma ) / 2 ] 

But wait, no. From earlier steps: gamma_A^2 = 1.62 (1 + gamma )^2 = (1 + gamma ) / 2.

So:

1.62 (1 + gamma )^2 = (1 + gamma ) / 2.

Divide both sides by (1 + gamma ), assuming it's non-zero.

1.62 (1 + gamma ) = 1/2

Then,

1 + gamma = (1/2) / 1.62 ≈ 0.3086.

So 1 + gamma ≈ 0.3086 → gamma ≈ -0.6914.

Wait, that can't be right, because gamma is always greater than or equal to 1 for a moving particle.

So somewhere, I must have made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let me retrace:

We have gamma_A^2 = 1.62 (1 + gamma )^2

And from the denominator calculation, we found that 1/D = (1 + gamma ) / 2.

So gamma_A^2 = 1 / D = (1 + gamma ) / 2.

So,

1.62 (1 + gamma )^2 = (1 + gamma ) / 2.

Divide both sides by (1 + gamma ), which is positive, so:

1.62 (1 + gamma ) = 1/2 → 1 + gamma = (1/2)/1.62 ≈ 0.3086.

Which gives gamma ≈ -0.6914. But that's impossible. Gamma is at least 1.

Hmm, that can't be right. So perhaps my earlier approach is flawed. Maybe the assumption that all four particles are moving in the same direction isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approximation (gamma ≈ 1) leads to errors because the resulting velocity is significant (0.77c). Maybe I should instead not approximate and work through the exact equations.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let's consider that the four particles are moving such that their total momentum is equal to the initial momentum, which is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

And their total energy is E_initial = (1 + gamma) m_p c².

But the four particles would each have energy E_A = gamma_A m_A c² and momentum p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

So the total momentum is 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v.

The total energy is 4 gamma_A m_A c² = (1 + gamma) m_p c².

If I take the ratio of these two equations:

(4 gamma_A m_A v_A ) / (4 gamma_A m_A c²) ) = (gamma m_p v) / ( (1 + gamma) m_p c² )

Simplify:

v_A / c² = (gamma v ) / [ (1 + gamma ) c² ]

Multiply both sides by c²:

v_A = (gamma v ) / (1 + gamma )

But from the energy equation,

gamma_A = [ (1 + gamma) m_p c² ] / [4 m_A c² ] = (1 + gamma ) m_p / (4 m_A )

Since m_p c² = 938 MeV, m_A c² = 300 MeV,

gamma_A = (1 + gamma ) * 938 / (4 * 300 ) ≈ (1 + gamma ) * (938)/(1200 ) ≈ (1 + gamma ) * 0.7817.

So,

gamma_A ≈ 0.7817 (1 + gamma )

But gamma_A is also given by gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_A^2/c^2)).

We can substitute v_A from earlier:

v_A = (gamma v ) / (1 + gamma )

Which can be rewritten as v_A = ( gamma / (1 + gamma )) v.

Thus,

v_A^2 = (gamma² v² ) / (1 + gamma )^2.

So,

1 - (v_A^2/c^2 ) = 1 - [ gamma² v² ] / [ c² (1 + gamma )^2 ]

= [ (1 + gamma )^2 c² - gamma² v² ] / [ c² (1 + gamma )^2 ]

But not sure if that helps. Let me express v in terms of gamma.

Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2 ), beta = v/c.

So,

v = beta c.

So,

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2 )

gamma² = 1/(1 - beta^2 )

So,

gamma² v² = gamma² beta² c² = [ beta² c² ] / (1 - beta^2 )

Now, let's compute 1 - (v_A^2/c² ):

= 1 - [ gamma² beta² c² ] / [ c² (1 + gamma )^2 ]

= 1 - [ gamma² beta^2 ] / (1 + gamma )^2.

But I'm not sure how to proceed. Let's try to plug in gamma_A expression.

gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_A^2/c^2 )) 

= 1 / sqrt( [ (1 + gamma )^2 - gamma² beta^2 ] / (1 + gamma )^2 ) )

= (1 + gamma ) / sqrt( (1 + gamma )^2 - gamma² beta^2 )

Wait, maybe substitute beta in terms of gamma.

beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma² )) = sqrt( (gamma² - 1)/gamma² ) ) = sqrt(gamma² - 1 ) / gamma.

So,

beta = sqrt(gamma² -1 ) / gamma.

So,

beta^2 = (gamma² -1 ) / gamma².

Substituting back:

(1 + gamma )^2 - gamma² beta^2 = (1 + 2 gamma + gamma² ) - gamma^2 ( (gamma² -1 ) / gamma^2 )

= (1 + 2 gamma + gamma² ) - (gamma² -1 )

= 1 + 2 gamma + gamma² - gamma² +1 

= 2 (1 + gamma )

So,

gamma_A = (1 + gamma ) / sqrt( 2 (1 + gamma ) )

= sqrt( (1 + gamma ) / 2 )

So,

gamma_A = sqrt( (1 + gamma ) / 2 )

But earlier, we have gamma_A = 0.7817 (1 + gamma )

So,

sqrt( (1 + gamma ) / 2 ) = 0.7817 (1 + gamma )

Square both sides:

(1 + gamma ) / 2 = (0.7817)^2 (1 + gamma )^2.

Assuming (1 + gamma ) ≠ 0, divide both sides by (1 + gamma ):

1/2 = (0.611) (1 + gamma )

So,

1 + gamma = (1/2 ) / 0.611 ≈ 0.8187.

So,

gamma ≈ 0.8187 -1 = -0.1813.

Which is negative, which is impossible because gamma is always >= 1.

Hmm, something's wrong here. I must have made an error in the algebra somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that all four particles move in the same direction is incorrect, and that's why the equations are leading to an impossible solution.

Maybe a better approach is to consider that the four particles are moving in pairs, such that two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, but with some net momentum.

Wait, but that would complicate the momentum conservation equation. Let's think about this.

Suppose two of the A particles move with velocity v and the other two with velocity u in the opposite direction.

Then, the total momentum is 2 gamma m_A v - 2 gamma' m_A u.

Wait, but each has their own gamma factors, which complicates things further. Maybe that's not the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is symmetric, and each pair of A particles (A+ and A-) move in opposite directions, but all with the same speed.

Wait, but that would make the total momentum zero if each pair cancels, which can't be because the initial momentum isn't zero.

Hmm, maybe I need to model it more carefully.

Let me try a different approach. The initial system's four-momentum is (E_initial, p_initial).

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

p_initial = gamma m_p v.

The final four-momentum is the sum of four particles, each with four-momentum (E_A, p_A c), (E_A, p_A c), (E_A, -p_A c), (E_A, -p_A c).

Wait, no. If two are moving in the +x direction and two in the -x direction, their momenta would add as p_A + p_A - p_A - p_A = 0. So that can't be.

Wait, no. Let me model it as two A+ moving in +x and two A- moving in -x. Each A+ has momentum p, each A- has momentum p (but in the opposite direction).

Wait, no, because the A+ and A- have opposite charges, but their masses are the same. So their momenta would have the same magnitude but opposite directions.

So the total momentum would be 2 p (from A+ ) + 2 (-p ) (from A- ) = 0.

Wait, that would mean the total momentum is zero, which can't match the initial momentum, which is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

So that can't be the case; the initial system has momentum, so the final system must have the same.

Hmm, maybe the particles don't move symmetrically. Perhaps all four are moving in the same direction, but that brings us back to the earlier problem of getting a negative gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps two are moving in the same direction and the other two are at rest. But that would make the total momentum 2 p, which would have to equal the initial momentum.

Wait, but if two are moving and two are at rest, their total energy would be 2 E_A + 2 m_A c².

But the initial energy is (1 + gamma ) m_p c².

This might complicate things a lot, but let me try.

So:

Momentum: 2 p_A = gamma m_p v.

Energy: 2 E_A + 2 m_A c² = (1 + gamma ) m_p c².

Express E_A = gamma_A m_A c², p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

So,

2 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v.

and,

2 gamma_A m_A c² + 2 m_A c² = (1 + gamma ) m_p c².

Divide the second equation by 2 m_A c²:

gamma_A + 1 = [ (1 + gamma ) m_p c² ] / ( 2 m_A c² )

= (1 + gamma ) m_p / ( 2 m_A )

Again, m_p c² = 938 MeV, m_A c² = 300 MeV.

So,

gamma_A + 1 = (1 + gamma ) * 938 / ( 2 * 300 ) ≈ (1 + gamma ) * 1.563.

So,

gamma_A = (1.563)(1 + gamma ) - 1.

But from the first equation:

gamma_A = [ gamma m_p v ] / [ 2 m_A v_A ].

Hmm, but this still leaves variables in terms of gamma and v_A.

I think I'm stuck in circles here. Maybe I should try to find the velocity using the earlier approach where I took all four particles moving in the same direction and got a velocity of 0.77c, which is option A.

But I'm not confident because symmetry might not allow all four to move in the same direction.

Wait, another approach: Using the fact that in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. So perhaps in that frame, the particles are produced symmetrically. But in the lab frame, where the initial system has momentum, the particles would have to move in a way that their total momentum matches.

But perhaps I should calculate the velocity of each A particle using the invariant mass.

Wait, the invariant mass squared s is (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2.

In the initial frame, s is (E_initial )^2 - (p_initial c )^2.

Which is [ (1 + gamma ) m_p c² ]^2 - [ gamma m_p v c ]^2.

Compute this:

= (1 + gamma )² m_p² c^4 - gamma² m_p^2 v² c².

= m_p² c^4 [ (1 + gamma )² - gamma² (v²/c² ) ].

But v = beta c, so v²/c² = beta^2.

= m_p² c^4 [ (1 + 2 gamma + gamma² ) - gamma^2 beta^2 ].

But gamma² = 1/(1 - beta^2 ), so beta^2 = 1 - 1/gamma².

So,

= m_p² c^4 [ 1 + 2 gamma + gamma² - gamma^2 (1 -1/gamma² ) ]

= m_p² c^4 [ 1 + 2 gamma + gamma² - gamma^2 + 1 ]

= m_p² c^4 [ 2 + 2 gamma ].

= 2 m_p c² (1 + gamma ) * m_p c².

Wait, maybe I messed up the expansion. Let me compute it again.

Wait, let me expand (1 + gamma )^2 = 1 + 2 gamma + gamma².

Gamma^2 beta^2 = gamma^2 (1 - 1/gamma^2 ) = gamma^2 - 1.

So,

(1 + gamma )^2 - gamma^2 beta^2 = 1 + 2 gamma + gamma² - (gamma^2 - 1 ) = 1 + 2 gamma + gamma² - gamma^2 +1 = 2 (1 + gamma )

So,

s = m_p² c^4 * 2 (1 + gamma ) / m_p² c^4 ?

Wait, no, the expression is:

s = m_p² c^4 * [ (1 + gamma )^2 - (gamma^2 beta^2 ) ]

Which equals m_p² c^4 * [2(1 + gamma ) ]

So,

s = 2 (1 + gamma ) m_p² c^4.

But in the final state, the invariant mass squared is also s = (sum E )^2 - (sum p c )^2.

In the final state, sum E = 4 E_A, sum p c = 4 p_A c.

So,

s = (4 E_A )^2 - (4 p_A c )^2 = 16 ( E_A^2 - (p_A c )^2 ) = 16 ( (gamma_A m_A c^2 )^2 - (gamma_A m_A v_A c )^2 )

= 16 gamma_A² m_A^2 c^4 [ 1 - (v_A^2/c^2 ) ].

But 1 - (v_A^2/c^2 ) = 1 / gamma_A^2.

So,

s = 16 gamma_A^2 m_A^2 c^4 * (1/gamma_A^2 ) ) = 16 m_A^2 c^4.

So,

16 m_A^2 c^4 = 2 (1 + gamma ) m_p^2 c^4.

Simplify:

16 m_A^2 = 2 (1 + gamma ) m_p^2.

So,

8 m_A^2 = (1 + gamma ) m_p^2.

Thus,

(1 + gamma ) = 8 m_A^2 / m_p^2.

Substituting m_A c^2 =300 MeV, m_p c^2=938 MeV.

So,

m_A = 300 / c²,

m_p = 938 / c².

So,

(1 + gamma ) = 8 ( (300)^2 ) / (938^2 ) ) 

= 8 * (90000) / (880,  I think 938^2 is approximately 938*938= let's compute.

938 * 938.

= (900 +38)^2 = 900^2 + 2*900*38 + 38^2.

= 810000 + 68,400 + 1,444 = 810,000 + 68,400= 878,400 + 1,444= 879,844.

So,

(1 + gamma ) = 8 * 90000 / 879,844 ≈ (720,000) / 879,844 ≈ approximately 0.818.

Wait,

720,000 / 879,844 ≈ 0.818.

So,

1 + gamma ≈ 0.818 → gamma ≈ -0.182.

Again, this can't be right because gamma is always ≥1.

Hmm, so this approach leads to a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake in the invariant mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the invariant mass calculation. Let me double-check.

The invariant mass squared for the initial system is s = (E_initial )^2 - (p_initial c )^2.

E_initial is (1 + gamma ) m_p c²,

p_initial is gamma m_p v.

So,

s = [ (1 + gamma ) m_p c² ]^2 - [ gamma m_p v c ]^2.

= m_p² c^4 (1 + gamma )^2 - gamma² m_p^2 v² c^2.

But v = beta c, so v² c² = beta² c^4.

So,

s = m_p^2 c^4 [ (1 + gamma )^2 - gamma^2 beta^2 ].

Again, beta^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2.

So,

= m_p^2 c^4 [ (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) - gamma^2 (1 -1/gamma^2 ) ]

= m_p^2 c^4 [ 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 - gamma^2 + 1 ]

= m_p^2 c^4 [ 2(1 + gamma ) ].

So, s = 2 (1 + gamma ) m_p^2 c^4.

In the final state, the invariant mass s is also:

s = (4 E_A )^2 - (4 p_A c )^2.

Which is 16 ( E_A^2 - p_A^2 c^2 ).

Each A has E_A = gamma_A m_A c²,

p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

So,

E_A^2 - p_A^2 c^2 = (gamma_A^2 m_A^2 c^4 ) - (gamma_A^2 m_A^2 v_A^2 c^2 )

= gamma_A^2 m_A^2 c^4 ( 1 - v_A^2/c^2 )

= gamma_A^2 m_A^2 c^4 * ( 1/gamma_A^2 )

= m_A^2 c^4.

So,

s = 16 m_A^2 c^4.

But earlier, s = 2 (1 + gamma ) m_p^2 c^4.

Thus,

16 m_A^2 c^4 = 2 (1 + gamma ) m_p^2 c^4.

Divide both sides by c^4:

16 m_A^2 = 2 (1 + gamma ) m_p^2.

So,

8 m_A^2 = (1 + gamma ) m_p^2.

So,

(1 + gamma ) = 8 m_A^2 / m_p^2.

Substituting m_A c^2 =300 MeV, m_p c^2=938 MeV.

Wait, m_A = 300 MeV/c², m_p=938 MeV/c².

So,

(1 + gamma ) = 8 (300)^2 / (938)^2.

Compute 300^2 =90,000.

938^2 ≈ 879,844.

So,

(1 + gamma ) = 8 * 90000 / 879,844 ≈ 720,000 / 879,844 ≈ 0.818.

Again, this gives gamma ≈ -0.182, which is impossible.

Wait, but I'm getting the same result again, which can't be correct. So there must be a mistake in the setup.

Perhaps the error is in the assumption about how the particles are moving. Maybe the four particles don't all have the same energy. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the initial system's invariant mass is higher, leading to higher energies in the products.

Wait a minute, perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the answer is approximately 0.77c, which is option A. But I'm not certain because the invariant mass approach leads to an impossible gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption that the antiproton is moving slowly is a hint to use non-relativistic approaches.

Wait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is small, so the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c².

The rest mass of the products is 4 m_A c² = 1200 MeV, which is less than 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. So the initial kinetic energy is about 676 MeV, which must be shared among the four particles.

Assuming all four A particles are moving in the same direction, each would have an energy of (2 m_p c^2 + K_initial ) /4.

Wait, but perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, if all four particles are moving at the same speed, their kinetic energy would be 4*(gamma -1 ) m_A c².

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: Using conservation of momentum.

Assuming the proton is at rest and the antiproton has velocity v, the initial momentum is gamma m_p v.

After annihilation, the four particles have a total momentum of 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

So,

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v.

Energy conservation:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = (1 + gamma ) m_p c².

Divide the two equations:

[4 gamma_A m_A v_A ] / [4 gamma_A m_A c² ] = [ gamma m_p v ] / [ (1 + gamma ) m_p c² ]

Simplify:

v_A / c² = gamma v / [ (1 + gamma ) c² ]

Multiply both sides by c²:

v_A = gamma v / (1 + gamma )

But from energy conservation,

gamma_A = (1 + gamma ) m_p / (4 m_A )

So,

gamma_A = (1 + gamma ) * 938 / (4 * 300 )

= (1 + gamma ) * 0.7817.

But gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_A^2/c^2 )).

Substituting v_A from earlier,

v_A = gamma v / (1 + gamma )

But v = beta c,

v_A = gamma beta c / (1 + gamma )

So,

v_A^2 = gamma^2 beta^2 c^2 / (1 + gamma )^2.

Thus,

1 - (v_A^2/c^2 ) = 1 - [ gamma^2 beta^2 ] / (1 + gamma )^2.

But beta^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2,

so,

= 1 - [ gamma^2 (1 - 1/gamma^2 ) ] / (1 + gamma )^2.

= 1 - [ gamma^2 -1 ) / (1 + gamma )^2 ]

= [ (1 + gamma )^2 - (gamma^2 - 1 ) ] / (1 + gamma )^2.

Expanding numerator:

1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 - gamma^2 + 1 = 2 + 2 gamma.

So,

1 - (v_A^2/c^2 ) = (2 (1 + gamma )) / (1 + gamma )^2 ) = 2 / (1 + gamma ).

Thus,

gamma_A = 1 / sqrt( 2/(1 + gamma )) ) = sqrt( (1 + gamma ) / 2 )

But earlier, gamma_A = 0.7817 (1 + gamma )

So,

sqrt( (1 + gamma ) / 2 ) = 0.7817 (1 + gamma )

Square both sides:

(1 + gamma ) / 2 = (0.7817)^2 (1 + gamma )^2.

= 0.611 (1 + gamma )^2.

Multiply both sides by 2:

1 + gamma = 1.222 (1 + gamma )^2.

Rearrange:

1.222 (1 + gamma )^2 - (1 + gamma ) =0.

Factor:

(1 + gamma ) [ 1.222 (1 + gamma ) -1 ] =0.

So,

1 + gamma =0 → gamma=-1 (invalid),

or,

1.222 (1 + gamma ) -1 =0 → 1 + gamma = 1/1.222 ≈ 0.818.

So,

gamma ≈ 0.818 -1 = -0.182.

Again, impossible. So it's leading to the same contradiction.

I must be missing something. Maybe the assumption that all four particles are moving in the same direction is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic Breit-Wigner distribution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the antiproton is moving very slowly, so gamma is approximately 1.

If gamma ≈1, then from the energy equation,

4 gamma_A m_A c² ≈ (1 +1 ) m_p c² → 4 gamma_A *300 = 2 *938 → gamma_A ≈ (2 *938 )/(4 *300 )= (1876)/(1200 )≈ 1.563.

Then, from gamma_A,

gamma_A =1.563 → v_A = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_A^2 ) ≈ c * sqrt(1 - 1/(2.44 )) ≈ sqrt( 1 -0.409 )= sqrt(0.591 )≈ 0.769 c.

So approximately 0.77c, which is option A.

But earlier, the invariant mass approach gave a negative gamma, which suggests that the assumption of all four particles moving in the same direction is incorrect.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 0.91c.

Wait, let me compute gamma_A for 0.91c.

v =0.91c,

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.91)^2 ) =1/sqrt(1 -0.8281 )=1/sqrt(0.1719 )≈1/0.414≈2.414.

So,

gamma_A=2.414.

Then,

v_A=0.91c.

So,

gamma_A =2.414 → E_A=2.414 *300=724.2 MeV.

Total energy from four A's:4 *724.2=2,896.8 MeV.

Initial energy: (1 + gamma ) m_p c² = (1 +2.414 ) *938 ≈3.414 *938≈3,192 MeV.

Hmm, so 2,896 MeV < 3,192 MeV. So energy isn't conserved. So that's a problem.

So this can't be the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the initial approximation, leading to v_A=0.77c, option A.

But earlier, the invariant mass approach leads to a contradiction, which suggests that the initial assumption is incorrect.

Given the time I have, I think I'll proceed with the initial approach, where v_A≈0.77c, which is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process:

### Key Equations and Assumptions
1. **Conservation of Momentum**:  
   The initial momentum is carried by the moving antiproton, and the final momentum is shared by the four particles \( A^\pm \). Assuming symmetry, all four particles are moving in the same direction with the same velocity \( v_A \).  
   \[
   4 \gamma_A m_A v_A = \gamma m_p v
   \]

2. **Conservation of Energy**:  
   The total energy of the initial system is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy. The final energy is the sum of the energies of the four \( A^\pm \) particles.  
   \[
   4 \gamma_A m_A c^2 = (1 + \gamma) m_p c^2
   \]

3. **Relating \( \gamma_A \) and \( v_A \)**:  
   The Lorentz factor for the \( A^\pm \) particles is given by:  
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2}}
   \]

4. **Simplification**:  
   Dividing the momentum equation by the energy equation eliminates \( \gamma_A \):  
   \[
   \frac{v_A}{c^2} = \frac{\gamma v}{(1 + \gamma) c^2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:  
   \[
   v_A = \frac{\gamma v}{1 + \gamma}
   \]

5. **Energy Relation for \( \gamma_A \)**:  
   From the energy equation:  
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{(1 + \gamma) m_p}{4 m_A}
   \]
   Substituting \( m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \):  
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{(1 + \gamma) \cdot 938}{4 \cdot 300} \approx 0.7817 (1 + \gamma)
   \]

6. **Relating \( \gamma_A \) and \( v_A \)**:  
   Using \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2}} \), substitute \( v_A \) from earlier:  
   \[
   \gamma_A = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \gamma}{2}}
   \]
   Equating the two expressions for \( \gamma_A \):  
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{1 + \gamma}{2}} = 0.7817 (1 + \gamma)
   \]
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   \frac{1 + \gamma}{2} = 0.611 (1 + \gamma)^2
   \]
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   1 + \gamma = \frac{1}{1.222}
   \]
   Solving gives:  
   \[
   1 + \gamma \approx 0.818 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \gamma \approx -0.182
   \]
   This result is unphysical, indicating an inconsistency in the assumptions.

### Approximation for Slow Antiproton
Given the antiproton is moving slowly, \( \gamma \approx 1 \). Substituting \( \gamma = 1 \) into \( \gamma_A \):  
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{2 m_p}{4 m_A} = \frac{938}{2 \cdot 300} \approx 1.563
\]
Using \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2}} \):  
\[
1.563 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2}}
\]
Squaring:  
\[
1.563^2 = \frac{1}{1 - v_A^2/c^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 - v_A^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{2.443} \approx 0.409
\]
\[
v_A^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.409 = 0.591 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_A \approx \sqrt{0.591} c \approx 0.77c
\]

### Conclusion
The velocity of particle \( A \) is approximately \( 0.77c \), corresponding to **Option A**.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about annihilation processes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The problem says: p + bar{p} → 2A^+ + 2A^-. The antiproton is moving slowly, and the mass energy of A is 300 MeV. I need to find the velocity of particle A. The options are A) 0.77c, B) 0.96c, C) 0.91c, D) 0.86c.

Wait, wait. So this is a particle physics question. Proton and antiproton annihilate into these particles A+ and A-. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, maybe we can assume that its kinetic energy is much less than its rest mass energy. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

First, let me recall conservation laws. In any reaction, both energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the antiproton is moving slowly, perhaps the initial momentum is low. Wait, but the initial setup is p + bar{p}. The proton is probably at rest, and the antiproton is moving slowly. Or maybe both are moving, but the antiproton's speed is low. Hmm, the problem says the antiproton is slowly moving, so maybe the initial momentum is small compared to their rest masses.

Wait, the rest mass of a proton is about 938 MeV/c², so the antiproton has the same mass. So the initial system is a proton (maybe at rest) and a moving antiproton. When they annihilate, they produce four particles: two A+ and two A-. So it's a symmetric production.

Wait, but conservation of momentum. The initial momentum is just the momentum of the antiproton, since the proton is at rest. So the final momentum must equal that. So the total momentum of the four particles after annihilation must equal the initial momentum.

But how to calculate the velocity of A? Since all the A particles are produced symmetrically, maybe they have the same magnitude of velocity but different directions. Alternatively, perhaps each pair (A+ and A-) move in opposite directions to conserve momentum.

Wait, let me think about the process. The initial system has a certain energy and momentum. The final system must have the same.

Assuming the proton is at rest, the initial momentum is just that of the antiproton, which is moving slowly — so maybe we can approximate its momentum as much less than its rest mass times c. But wait, the rest mass energy is 938 MeV for the proton, and the antiproton is moving slowly. So its kinetic energy is small, maybe we can treat it as non-relativistic. But I'm not sure if that's allowed.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use conservation of energy and momentum, but considering relativistic effects. Hmm.

Another approach: Because the problem gives the mass of A as 300 MeV/c², which is less than the proton mass. So each A is lighter than a proton.

Wait, the annihilation process p + bar{p} → 2A+ + 2A-. So four particles in the final state. Let me think about the possible energy and momentum.

Assuming the proton is at rest, the initial four-momentum is (E_p + E_pbar, p_pbar), since the proton has no momentum. E_p is m_p c², and E_pbar is also m_p c² (since they're same mass). So initial energy is 2 m_p c².

But wait, the antiproton is moving, so its energy isn't just its rest mass. So E_pbar = gamma m_p c², and p_pbar = gamma m_p v. But since it's moving slowly, v << c, so gamma is approximately 1 + (v²)/(2c²). But maybe it's not that slow, because the mass of A is 300 MeV, which is about a third of the proton mass. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but perhaps the initial energy is equal to the sum of the rest masses of the products plus kinetic energy. Or wait, in annihilation, the rest masses of the products are important. The initial rest mass of proton and antiproton is 2 * 938 MeV = 1876 MeV. The total rest mass of the final products is 4 * 300 MeV = 1200 MeV. So that's less than the initial rest mass. But that suggests that the initial kinetic energy (since the antiproton is moving) must be converted into the kinetic energy of the products.

Wait, but the initial system's total energy is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy (which is rest plus kinetic). So E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

Hmm, but if the antiproton is moving slowly, gamma is about 1, so E_initial ≈ 2 m_p c².

Wait, but the rest energy of the products is 4 * m_A c² = 1200 MeV, which is less than 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. So the initial kinetic energy is 1876 - 1200 = 676 MeV. So that goes into the kinetic energy of the products.

But how to relate this to the velocity of the A particles.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the concept of invariant mass. The invariant mass squared is (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2.

Wait, in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. So invariant mass would be the sum of the energies in that frame.

But wait, the initial system is not necessarily in the center-of-momentum frame because the proton is at rest and the antiproton is moving. So initial momentum is p_pbar, so the initial frame is moving.

Hmm, perhaps it's better to work in the lab frame where the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. Then, we can calculate the energy and momentum of the system, and set that equal to the energy and momentum of the products.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the initial momentum is p_pbar = gamma m_p v (since the antiproton is moving with velocity v, which is small). The initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

The final state has four particles, each with energy E_A and momentum p_A. But wait, the problem states that the antiproton is slowly moving, so its gamma is about 1, perhaps. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, but the process is p + bar{p} → 2A+ + 2A-.

Assuming that the final particles are all moving in the same direction? Or maybe in opposite directions to conserve momentum.

But four particles... could they be moving in pairs, like two pairs moving in opposite directions?

Wait, perhaps the two A+ and two A- form two pairs moving in opposite directions each. So each pair has equal and opposite momentum, making the total momentum zero? But that would only be the case if the initial system had zero momentum. But the initial system has momentum from the antiproton, so the final system must have that same momentum. So perhaps the final particles don't have zero momentum.

Alternatively, maybe the four particles are moving in such a way that their momenta add up to the initial momentum.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about energy and momentum conservation separately.

Let me denote the initial momentum as p_initial = gamma m_p v, where v is the velocity of the antiproton. The initial energy E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

In the final state, we have four particles each with energy E_A and momentum p_A. But their directions could be such that the total momentum is p_initial.

Wait, but given the symmetry, perhaps the two A+ and two A- are arranged symmetrically. For example, maybe two particles are moving in one direction, and the other two in the opposite direction. Or maybe each A+ and A- are moving in opposite directions, but then each pair would contribute to the momentum.

Alternatively, perhaps only two of the four particles are moving, and the other two are at rest. No, that can't be because then the momentum wouldn't add up.

Wait, perhaps it's more productive to consider that each A has the same speed, so same magnitude of momentum, but their directions are arranged such that the total momentum equals p_initial.

Wait, maybe all four are moving in the same direction. But that would make the total momentum 4 p_A. But that would require p_initial = 4 p_A. That might not be the case, but perhaps it's possible.

Alternatively, maybe two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, but with a net momentum equal to p_initial.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the conservation equations.

Let me denote:

The initial momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

The initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

The final state has four particles, each with energy E_A and momentum p_A. Because of symmetry, perhaps each pair (A+ and A-) are moving in opposite directions. So maybe for each pair, their momenta cancel each other, but since there are two pairs, the net momentum might be zero. But wait, that can't be, because the initial momentum isn't zero.

Hmm, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps each A+ and A- are moving in the same direction. But that would complicate their momentum sum.

Alternatively, perhaps all four particles are moving in the same direction, each with the same velocity. Then their total momentum would be 4 p_A, and their total energy would be 4 E_A.

So setting:

4 p_A = gamma m_p v. (Momentum conservation)
4 E_A = 2 m_p c² + gamma m_p c². (Energy conservation)

Wait, no. Because the initial energy is E_initial = m_p c² (proton) + gamma m_p c² (antiproton). So total initial energy is (1 + gamma) m_p c².

So the final energy is 4 E_A = (1 + gamma) m_p c².

And the final momentum is 4 p_A = gamma m_p v.

So from these two equations, we can find E_A and p_A in terms of gamma and v.

But each A has energy E_A = gamma_A m_A c², where gamma_A is the Lorentz factor for the A particles, and momentum p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

Wait, no. Momentum is p = gamma m v, where v is the velocity. So for each A particle, p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A, and E_A = gamma_A m_A c².

So substituting into the conservation equations:

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v. --- (1)

4 gamma_A m_A c² = (1 + gamma) m_p c². --- (2)

Wait, but we have two equations and variables gamma_A, v_A, and gamma (which depends on v, the antiproton's speed).

Hmm, but the problem states that the antiproton is moving slowly, so v << c. So gamma for the antiproton is approximately 1, because gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²). So if v is small, gamma ≈ 1.

So let's approximate gamma ≈ 1.

Then, equation (2) becomes:

4 gamma_A m_A c² ≈ (1 + 1) m_p c² = 2 m_p c².

So gamma_A = (2 m_p c²) / (4 m_A c²) ) = (m_p) / (2 m_A).

Given that m_A c² = 300 MeV, and m_p c² is about 938 MeV.

So m_p / (2 m_A) = 938 / (2*300) ≈ 938 / 600 ≈ 1.563.

So gamma_A ≈ 1.563.

Now, with gamma_A known, we can find the velocity v_A of the A particles using gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

So gamma_A = 1.563 → 1.563 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_A²/c²)).

Let me compute that.

1 / (1.563)^2 = 1 - (v_A²/c²)

1/( (1.563)^2 ) ≈ 1/(2.443) ≈ 0.409.

So:

1 - (v_A²/c²) ≈ 0.409 → v_A²/c² ≈ 0.591 → v_A ≈ sqrt(0.591) c ≈ 0.769 c.

So approximately 0.77c, which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Did I make a mistake in assuming that all four A particles are moving in the same direction? Because in reality, it's more likely that they move symmetrically. So maybe the initial assumption that all four are moving in the same direction isn't correct.

Ah, okay, perhaps I oversimplified. Let me think again.

If the final particles are arranged symmetrically, perhaps the momentum vectors cancel out for some pairs. For instance, if each A+ and A- move in opposite directions, their momenta cancel each other. So if there are two such pairs, the total momentum would be zero. But that can't be, because the initial momentum isn't zero.

So perhaps the four particles don't all move in the same direction. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe two of the A particles are moving in the same direction, and the other two are at rest. But that can't be, because they have to carry momentum.

Wait, perhaps the two A+ move in one direction and the two A- in the opposite direction. Let me consider that:

Let me assume that the two A+ have momentum p each in the same direction, and the two A- have momentum q each in the opposite direction.

Then, the total momentum is 2p - 2q = gamma m_p v.

But if the system is symmetric, perhaps p = q, but that would make the total momentum zero. But that's not possible unless the initial momentum is zero, which it isn't.

So that approach doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, perhaps all four particles move in the same direction, each with the same speed. Then, the total momentum would be 4 p_A = gamma m_p v.

But earlier, with this assumption, I got v_A ≈ 0.77c, which is option A. But one of the options is C) 0.91c, which is higher. So maybe the assumption is incorrect.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the exact expressions without approximating gamma as 1. Because earlier, I assumed that the antiproton's gamma is approximately 1 because it's moving slowly. But wait, in that approach, I used gamma ≈ 1, which is only valid if v is much less than c. But if the resulting v_A is about 0.77c, which is a significant fraction of c, maybe I shouldn't have made that approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach isn't the right way. Let me think about the rest frame of the proton.

Wait, the proton is at rest, and the antiproton is moving with velocity v. The total energy is E_initial = m_p c² (proton's rest energy) + gamma m_p c² (antiproton's energy).

The total momentum is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

After annihilation, four particles are produced. Assuming that they are all moving in the same direction, their total momentum is 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

But perhaps it's more accurate to model this using conservation of four-momentum.

Wait, the four-momentum of the initial system is (E_initial, p_initial c), where E_initial = (1 + gamma) m_p c², and p_initial = gamma m_p v.

The four-momentum of the final system is the sum of the four-momenta of the four A particles.

Assuming each A has four-momentum (E_A, p_A c), then the total is (4 E_A, 4 p_A c).

So equate the two four-vectors:

4 E_A = (1 + gamma) m_p c²,

4 p_A c = gamma m_p v.

Each A's four-momentum is (gamma_A m_A c², gamma_A m_A v_A c).

So E_A = gamma_A m_A c²,

p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

So substituting into the equations:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = (1 + gamma) m_p c²,

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v.

Dividing the two equations to eliminate gamma_A:

(4 gamma_A m_A v_A) / (4 gamma_A m_A c² ) ) = (gamma m_p v) / [ (1 + gamma) m_p c² ]

Simplify left side: v_A / c².

Right side: gamma v / [ (1 + gamma) c² ]

So:

v_A / c² = (gamma v) / [ (1 + gamma) c² ]

Multiply both sides by c²:

v_A = gamma v / (1 + gamma)

Hmm, interesting. So v_A is (gamma v)/(1+gamma).

But wait, gamma for the antiproton is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe I can find gamma_A in terms of gamma.

From the first equation:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = (1 + gamma) m_p c².

So gamma_A = [ (1 + gamma) m_p ] / (4 m_A )

We have m_p c² = 938 MeV, m_A c² =300 MeV.

So gamma_A = [ (1 + gamma) * 938 ] / (4 * 300 )

= [ (1 + gamma) * 938 ] / 1200

But we also have from the second equation:

gamma_A = (gamma m_p v) / (4 m_A v_A )

But I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe I can combine the two equations.

Wait, let's express gamma_A from the first equation:

gamma_A = [ (1 + gamma) m_p ] / (4 m_A )

So:

gamma_A = [ (1 + gamma) * 938 ] / 1200 ≈ [ (1 + gamma) * 0.782 ] since 938/1200 ≈ 0.782.

So gamma_A ≈ 0.782 (1 + gamma).

And from the earlier expression, v_A = [ gamma v ] / (1 + gamma )

We can also write gamma in terms of v: gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

But this seems messy. Let me make some substitutions.

Let me denote beta = v/c, so v = beta c.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²)

So, beta = v/c.

So v_A = (gamma beta c ) / (1 + gamma )

= (gamma beta) c / (1 + gamma )

But gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta²), so let me write v_A in terms of beta.

Alternatively, let's write everything in terms of beta.

Given:

gamma_A = 0.782 (1 + gamma )

And:

v_A = (gamma beta) c / (1 + gamma )

But also, gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_A^2/c^2)).

So substituting v_A:

gamma_A = 1 / sqrt( 1 - [ (gamma^2 beta^2)/( (1 + gamma)^2 ) ] )

Let me square both sides:

gamma_A^2 = 1 / [ 1 - (gamma^2 beta^2)/(1 + gamma)^2 ]

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let's substitute the expression for gamma_A.

gamma_A^2 = [ (0.782)^2 (1 + gamma)^2 ] = 1.62 [ (1 + gamma)^2 ]

So:

1.62 (1 + gamma )^2 = 1 / [ 1 - (gamma^2 beta^2)/(1 + gamma )^2 ]

Let me compute the denominator:

Denominator D = 1 - (gamma^2 beta²)/(1 + gamma )^2.

But from gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta² ), so beta² = 1 - (1/gamma² )

So beta² = (gamma^2 -1)/gamma^2.

Plugging into D:

D = 1 - (gamma² * (gamma² - 1)/gamma² ) / (1 + gamma )^2 )

= 1 - ( (gamma² -1 ) ) / (1 + gamma )^2 )

= [ (1 + gamma )^2 - (gamma² - 1) ] / (1 + gamma )^2 )

Expanding numerator:

(1 + 2 gamma + gamma² ) - gamma² +1 = 2 + 2 gamma.

So D = (2 (1 + gamma )) / (1 + gamma )^2 ) = 2 / (1 + gamma )

Thus:

gamma_A^2 = 1.62 (1 + gamma )^2 = 1 / [ D ]

But D is 2/(1 + gamma ), so 1/D = (1 + gamma )/2.

So,

gamma_A^2 = 1.62 (1 + gamma )^2 = (1 + gamma )/2

Divide both sides by (1 + gamma )^2:

1.62 = (1 + gamma )/2 (1 + gamma )² / (1+gamma )^2 )

Wait, no. Let me write:

gamma_A^2 = [ (1 + gamma ) / 2 ] 

But wait, no. From earlier steps: gamma_A^2 = 1.62 (1 + gamma )^2 = (1 + gamma ) / 2.

So:

1.62 (1 + gamma )^2 = (1 + gamma ) / 2.

Divide both sides by (1 + gamma ), assuming it's non-zero.

1.62 (1 + gamma ) = 1/2

Then,

1 + gamma = (1/2) / 1.62 ≈ 0.3086.

So 1 + gamma ≈ 0.3086 → gamma ≈ -0.6914.

Wait, that can't be right, because gamma is always greater than or equal to 1 for a moving particle.

So somewhere, I must have made a mistake in the algebra.

Wait, let me retrace:

We have gamma_A^2 = 1.62 (1 + gamma )^2

And from the denominator calculation, we found that 1/D = (1 + gamma ) / 2.

So gamma_A^2 = 1 / D = (1 + gamma ) / 2.

So,

1.62 (1 + gamma )^2 = (1 + gamma ) / 2.

Divide both sides by (1 + gamma ), which is positive, so:

1.62 (1 + gamma ) = 1/2 → 1 + gamma = (1/2)/1.62 ≈ 0.3086.

Which gives gamma ≈ -0.6914. But that's impossible. Gamma is at least 1.

Hmm, that can't be right. So perhaps my earlier approach is flawed. Maybe the assumption that all four particles are moving in the same direction isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial approximation (gamma ≈ 1) leads to errors because the resulting velocity is significant (0.77c). Maybe I should instead not approximate and work through the exact equations.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let's consider that the four particles are moving such that their total momentum is equal to the initial momentum, which is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

And their total energy is E_initial = (1 + gamma) m_p c².

But the four particles would each have energy E_A = gamma_A m_A c² and momentum p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

So the total momentum is 4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v.

The total energy is 4 gamma_A m_A c² = (1 + gamma) m_p c².

If I take the ratio of these two equations:

(4 gamma_A m_A v_A ) / (4 gamma_A m_A c²) ) = (gamma m_p v) / ( (1 + gamma) m_p c² )

Simplify:

v_A / c² = (gamma v ) / [ (1 + gamma ) c² ]

Multiply both sides by c²:

v_A = (gamma v ) / (1 + gamma )

But from the energy equation,

gamma_A = [ (1 + gamma) m_p c² ] / [4 m_A c² ] = (1 + gamma ) m_p / (4 m_A )

Since m_p c² = 938 MeV, m_A c² = 300 MeV,

gamma_A = (1 + gamma ) * 938 / (4 * 300 ) ≈ (1 + gamma ) * (938)/(1200 ) ≈ (1 + gamma ) * 0.7817.

So,

gamma_A ≈ 0.7817 (1 + gamma )

But gamma_A is also given by gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_A^2/c^2)).

We can substitute v_A from earlier:

v_A = (gamma v ) / (1 + gamma )

Which can be rewritten as v_A = ( gamma / (1 + gamma )) v.

Thus,

v_A^2 = (gamma² v² ) / (1 + gamma )^2.

So,

1 - (v_A^2/c^2 ) = 1 - [ gamma² v² ] / [ c² (1 + gamma )^2 ]

= [ (1 + gamma )^2 c² - gamma² v² ] / [ c² (1 + gamma )^2 ]

But not sure if that helps. Let me express v in terms of gamma.

Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2 ), beta = v/c.

So,

v = beta c.

So,

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2 )

gamma² = 1/(1 - beta^2 )

So,

gamma² v² = gamma² beta² c² = [ beta² c² ] / (1 - beta^2 )

Now, let's compute 1 - (v_A^2/c² ):

= 1 - [ gamma² beta² c² ] / [ c² (1 + gamma )^2 ]

= 1 - [ gamma² beta^2 ] / (1 + gamma )^2.

But I'm not sure how to proceed. Let's try to plug in gamma_A expression.

gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_A^2/c^2 )) 

= 1 / sqrt( [ (1 + gamma )^2 - gamma² beta^2 ] / (1 + gamma )^2 ) )

= (1 + gamma ) / sqrt( (1 + gamma )^2 - gamma² beta^2 )

Wait, maybe substitute beta in terms of gamma.

beta = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma² )) = sqrt( (gamma² - 1)/gamma² ) ) = sqrt(gamma² - 1 ) / gamma.

So,

beta = sqrt(gamma² -1 ) / gamma.

So,

beta^2 = (gamma² -1 ) / gamma².

Substituting back:

(1 + gamma )^2 - gamma² beta^2 = (1 + 2 gamma + gamma² ) - gamma^2 ( (gamma² -1 ) / gamma^2 )

= (1 + 2 gamma + gamma² ) - (gamma² -1 )

= 1 + 2 gamma + gamma² - gamma² +1 

= 2 (1 + gamma )

So,

gamma_A = (1 + gamma ) / sqrt( 2 (1 + gamma ) )

= sqrt( (1 + gamma ) / 2 )

So,

gamma_A = sqrt( (1 + gamma ) / 2 )

But earlier, we have gamma_A = 0.7817 (1 + gamma )

So,

sqrt( (1 + gamma ) / 2 ) = 0.7817 (1 + gamma )

Square both sides:

(1 + gamma ) / 2 = (0.7817)^2 (1 + gamma )^2.

Assuming (1 + gamma ) ≠ 0, divide both sides by (1 + gamma ):

1/2 = (0.611) (1 + gamma )

So,

1 + gamma = (1/2 ) / 0.611 ≈ 0.8187.

So,

gamma ≈ 0.8187 -1 = -0.1813.

Which is negative, which is impossible because gamma is always >= 1.

Hmm, something's wrong here. I must have made an error in the algebra somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that all four particles move in the same direction is incorrect, and that's why the equations are leading to an impossible solution.

Maybe a better approach is to consider that the four particles are moving in pairs, such that two are moving in one direction and two in the opposite, but with some net momentum.

Wait, but that would complicate the momentum conservation equation. Let's think about this.

Suppose two of the A particles move with velocity v and the other two with velocity u in the opposite direction.

Then, the total momentum is 2 gamma m_A v - 2 gamma' m_A u.

Wait, but each has their own gamma factors, which complicates things further. Maybe that's not the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is symmetric, and each pair of A particles (A+ and A-) move in opposite directions, but all with the same speed.

Wait, but that would make the total momentum zero if each pair cancels, which can't be because the initial momentum isn't zero.

Hmm, maybe I need to model it more carefully.

Let me try a different approach. The initial system's four-momentum is (E_initial, p_initial).

E_initial = m_p c² + gamma m_p c².

p_initial = gamma m_p v.

The final four-momentum is the sum of four particles, each with four-momentum (E_A, p_A c), (E_A, p_A c), (E_A, -p_A c), (E_A, -p_A c).

Wait, no. If two are moving in the +x direction and two in the -x direction, their momenta would add as p_A + p_A - p_A - p_A = 0. So that can't be.

Wait, no. Let me model it as two A+ moving in +x and two A- moving in -x. Each A+ has momentum p, each A- has momentum p (but in the opposite direction).

Wait, no, because the A+ and A- have opposite charges, but their masses are the same. So their momenta would have the same magnitude but opposite directions.

So the total momentum would be 2 p (from A+ ) + 2 (-p ) (from A- ) = 0.

Wait, that would mean the total momentum is zero, which can't match the initial momentum, which is p_initial = gamma m_p v.

So that can't be the case; the initial system has momentum, so the final system must have the same.

Hmm, maybe the particles don't move symmetrically. Perhaps all four are moving in the same direction, but that brings us back to the earlier problem of getting a negative gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps two are moving in the same direction and the other two are at rest. But that would make the total momentum 2 p, which would have to equal the initial momentum.

Wait, but if two are moving and two are at rest, their total energy would be 2 E_A + 2 m_A c².

But the initial energy is (1 + gamma ) m_p c².

This might complicate things a lot, but let me try.

So:

Momentum: 2 p_A = gamma m_p v.

Energy: 2 E_A + 2 m_A c² = (1 + gamma ) m_p c².

Express E_A = gamma_A m_A c², p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

So,

2 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v.

and,

2 gamma_A m_A c² + 2 m_A c² = (1 + gamma ) m_p c².

Divide the second equation by 2 m_A c²:

gamma_A + 1 = [ (1 + gamma ) m_p c² ] / ( 2 m_A c² )

= (1 + gamma ) m_p / ( 2 m_A )

Again, m_p c² = 938 MeV, m_A c² = 300 MeV.

So,

gamma_A + 1 = (1 + gamma ) * 938 / ( 2 * 300 ) ≈ (1 + gamma ) * 1.563.

So,

gamma_A = (1.563)(1 + gamma ) - 1.

But from the first equation:

gamma_A = [ gamma m_p v ] / [ 2 m_A v_A ].

Hmm, but this still leaves variables in terms of gamma and v_A.

I think I'm stuck in circles here. Maybe I should try to find the velocity using the earlier approach where I took all four particles moving in the same direction and got a velocity of 0.77c, which is option A.

But I'm not confident because symmetry might not allow all four to move in the same direction.

Wait, another approach: Using the fact that in the center-of-momentum frame, the total momentum is zero. So perhaps in that frame, the particles are produced symmetrically. But in the lab frame, where the initial system has momentum, the particles would have to move in a way that their total momentum matches.

But perhaps I should calculate the velocity of each A particle using the invariant mass.

Wait, the invariant mass squared s is (sum E)^2 - (sum p c)^2.

In the initial frame, s is (E_initial )^2 - (p_initial c )^2.

Which is [ (1 + gamma ) m_p c² ]^2 - [ gamma m_p v c ]^2.

Compute this:

= (1 + gamma )² m_p² c^4 - gamma² m_p^2 v² c².

= m_p² c^4 [ (1 + gamma )² - gamma² (v²/c² ) ].

But v = beta c, so v²/c² = beta^2.

= m_p² c^4 [ (1 + 2 gamma + gamma² ) - gamma^2 beta^2 ].

But gamma² = 1/(1 - beta^2 ), so beta^2 = 1 - 1/gamma².

So,

= m_p² c^4 [ 1 + 2 gamma + gamma² - gamma^2 (1 -1/gamma² ) ]

= m_p² c^4 [ 1 + 2 gamma + gamma² - gamma^2 + 1 ]

= m_p² c^4 [ 2 + 2 gamma ].

= 2 m_p c² (1 + gamma ) * m_p c².

Wait, maybe I messed up the expansion. Let me compute it again.

Wait, let me expand (1 + gamma )^2 = 1 + 2 gamma + gamma².

Gamma^2 beta^2 = gamma^2 (1 - 1/gamma^2 ) = gamma^2 - 1.

So,

(1 + gamma )^2 - gamma^2 beta^2 = 1 + 2 gamma + gamma² - (gamma^2 - 1 ) = 1 + 2 gamma + gamma² - gamma^2 +1 = 2 (1 + gamma )

So,

s = m_p² c^4 * 2 (1 + gamma ) / m_p² c^4 ?

Wait, no, the expression is:

s = m_p² c^4 * [ (1 + gamma )^2 - (gamma^2 beta^2 ) ]

Which equals m_p² c^4 * [2(1 + gamma ) ]

So,

s = 2 (1 + gamma ) m_p² c^4.

But in the final state, the invariant mass squared is also s = (sum E )^2 - (sum p c )^2.

In the final state, sum E = 4 E_A, sum p c = 4 p_A c.

So,

s = (4 E_A )^2 - (4 p_A c )^2 = 16 ( E_A^2 - (p_A c )^2 ) = 16 ( (gamma_A m_A c^2 )^2 - (gamma_A m_A v_A c )^2 )

= 16 gamma_A² m_A^2 c^4 [ 1 - (v_A^2/c^2 ) ].

But 1 - (v_A^2/c^2 ) = 1 / gamma_A^2.

So,

s = 16 gamma_A^2 m_A^2 c^4 * (1/gamma_A^2 ) ) = 16 m_A^2 c^4.

So,

16 m_A^2 c^4 = 2 (1 + gamma ) m_p^2 c^4.

Simplify:

16 m_A^2 = 2 (1 + gamma ) m_p^2.

So,

8 m_A^2 = (1 + gamma ) m_p^2.

Thus,

(1 + gamma ) = 8 m_A^2 / m_p^2.

Substituting m_A c^2 =300 MeV, m_p c^2=938 MeV.

So,

m_A = 300 / c²,

m_p = 938 / c².

So,

(1 + gamma ) = 8 ( (300)^2 ) / (938^2 ) ) 

= 8 * (90000) / (880,  I think 938^2 is approximately 938*938= let's compute.

938 * 938.

= (900 +38)^2 = 900^2 + 2*900*38 + 38^2.

= 810000 + 68,400 + 1,444 = 810,000 + 68,400= 878,400 + 1,444= 879,844.

So,

(1 + gamma ) = 8 * 90000 / 879,844 ≈ (720,000) / 879,844 ≈ approximately 0.818.

Wait,

720,000 / 879,844 ≈ 0.818.

So,

1 + gamma ≈ 0.818 → gamma ≈ -0.182.

Again, this can't be right because gamma is always ≥1.

Hmm, so this approach leads to a contradiction. So I must have made a mistake in the invariant mass calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the invariant mass calculation. Let me double-check.

The invariant mass squared for the initial system is s = (E_initial )^2 - (p_initial c )^2.

E_initial is (1 + gamma ) m_p c²,

p_initial is gamma m_p v.

So,

s = [ (1 + gamma ) m_p c² ]^2 - [ gamma m_p v c ]^2.

= m_p² c^4 (1 + gamma )^2 - gamma² m_p^2 v² c^2.

But v = beta c, so v² c² = beta² c^4.

So,

s = m_p^2 c^4 [ (1 + gamma )^2 - gamma^2 beta^2 ].

Again, beta^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2.

So,

= m_p^2 c^4 [ (1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 ) - gamma^2 (1 -1/gamma^2 ) ]

= m_p^2 c^4 [ 1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 - gamma^2 + 1 ]

= m_p^2 c^4 [ 2(1 + gamma ) ].

So, s = 2 (1 + gamma ) m_p^2 c^4.

In the final state, the invariant mass s is also:

s = (4 E_A )^2 - (4 p_A c )^2.

Which is 16 ( E_A^2 - p_A^2 c^2 ).

Each A has E_A = gamma_A m_A c²,

p_A = gamma_A m_A v_A.

So,

E_A^2 - p_A^2 c^2 = (gamma_A^2 m_A^2 c^4 ) - (gamma_A^2 m_A^2 v_A^2 c^2 )

= gamma_A^2 m_A^2 c^4 ( 1 - v_A^2/c^2 )

= gamma_A^2 m_A^2 c^4 * ( 1/gamma_A^2 )

= m_A^2 c^4.

So,

s = 16 m_A^2 c^4.

But earlier, s = 2 (1 + gamma ) m_p^2 c^4.

Thus,

16 m_A^2 c^4 = 2 (1 + gamma ) m_p^2 c^4.

Divide both sides by c^4:

16 m_A^2 = 2 (1 + gamma ) m_p^2.

So,

8 m_A^2 = (1 + gamma ) m_p^2.

So,

(1 + gamma ) = 8 m_A^2 / m_p^2.

Substituting m_A c^2 =300 MeV, m_p c^2=938 MeV.

Wait, m_A = 300 MeV/c², m_p=938 MeV/c².

So,

(1 + gamma ) = 8 (300)^2 / (938)^2.

Compute 300^2 =90,000.

938^2 ≈ 879,844.

So,

(1 + gamma ) = 8 * 90000 / 879,844 ≈ 720,000 / 879,844 ≈ 0.818.

Again, this gives gamma ≈ -0.182, which is impossible.

Wait, but I'm getting the same result again, which can't be correct. So there must be a mistake in the setup.

Perhaps the error is in the assumption about how the particles are moving. Maybe the four particles don't all have the same energy. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the initial system's invariant mass is higher, leading to higher energies in the products.

Wait a minute, perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the answer is approximately 0.77c, which is option A. But I'm not certain because the invariant mass approach leads to an impossible gamma.

Alternatively, perhaps the assumption that the antiproton is moving slowly is a hint to use non-relativistic approaches.

Wait, if the antiproton is moving slowly, its kinetic energy is small, so the total energy is approximately 2 m_p c².

The rest mass of the products is 4 m_A c² = 1200 MeV, which is less than 2 * 938 = 1876 MeV. So the initial kinetic energy is about 676 MeV, which must be shared among the four particles.

Assuming all four A particles are moving in the same direction, each would have an energy of (2 m_p c^2 + K_initial ) /4.

Wait, but perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, if all four particles are moving at the same speed, their kinetic energy would be 4*(gamma -1 ) m_A c².

But I'm not sure.

Another approach: Using conservation of momentum.

Assuming the proton is at rest and the antiproton has velocity v, the initial momentum is gamma m_p v.

After annihilation, the four particles have a total momentum of 4 gamma_A m_A v_A.

So,

4 gamma_A m_A v_A = gamma m_p v.

Energy conservation:

4 gamma_A m_A c² = (1 + gamma ) m_p c².

Divide the two equations:

[4 gamma_A m_A v_A ] / [4 gamma_A m_A c² ] = [ gamma m_p v ] / [ (1 + gamma ) m_p c² ]

Simplify:

v_A / c² = gamma v / [ (1 + gamma ) c² ]

Multiply both sides by c²:

v_A = gamma v / (1 + gamma )

But from energy conservation,

gamma_A = (1 + gamma ) m_p / (4 m_A )

So,

gamma_A = (1 + gamma ) * 938 / (4 * 300 )

= (1 + gamma ) * 0.7817.

But gamma_A = 1 / sqrt(1 - (v_A^2/c^2 )).

Substituting v_A from earlier,

v_A = gamma v / (1 + gamma )

But v = beta c,

v_A = gamma beta c / (1 + gamma )

So,

v_A^2 = gamma^2 beta^2 c^2 / (1 + gamma )^2.

Thus,

1 - (v_A^2/c^2 ) = 1 - [ gamma^2 beta^2 ] / (1 + gamma )^2.

But beta^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2,

so,

= 1 - [ gamma^2 (1 - 1/gamma^2 ) ] / (1 + gamma )^2.

= 1 - [ gamma^2 -1 ) / (1 + gamma )^2 ]

= [ (1 + gamma )^2 - (gamma^2 - 1 ) ] / (1 + gamma )^2.

Expanding numerator:

1 + 2 gamma + gamma^2 - gamma^2 + 1 = 2 + 2 gamma.

So,

1 - (v_A^2/c^2 ) = (2 (1 + gamma )) / (1 + gamma )^2 ) = 2 / (1 + gamma ).

Thus,

gamma_A = 1 / sqrt( 2/(1 + gamma )) ) = sqrt( (1 + gamma ) / 2 )

But earlier, gamma_A = 0.7817 (1 + gamma )

So,

sqrt( (1 + gamma ) / 2 ) = 0.7817 (1 + gamma )

Square both sides:

(1 + gamma ) / 2 = (0.7817)^2 (1 + gamma )^2.

= 0.611 (1 + gamma )^2.

Multiply both sides by 2:

1 + gamma = 1.222 (1 + gamma )^2.

Rearrange:

1.222 (1 + gamma )^2 - (1 + gamma ) =0.

Factor:

(1 + gamma ) [ 1.222 (1 + gamma ) -1 ] =0.

So,

1 + gamma =0 → gamma=-1 (invalid),

or,

1.222 (1 + gamma ) -1 =0 → 1 + gamma = 1/1.222 ≈ 0.818.

So,

gamma ≈ 0.818 -1 = -0.182.

Again, impossible. So it's leading to the same contradiction.

I must be missing something. Maybe the assumption that all four particles are moving in the same direction is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic Breit-Wigner distribution, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the antiproton is moving very slowly, so gamma is approximately 1.

If gamma ≈1, then from the energy equation,

4 gamma_A m_A c² ≈ (1 +1 ) m_p c² → 4 gamma_A *300 = 2 *938 → gamma_A ≈ (2 *938 )/(4 *300 )= (1876)/(1200 )≈ 1.563.

Then, from gamma_A,

gamma_A =1.563 → v_A = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_A^2 ) ≈ c * sqrt(1 - 1/(2.44 )) ≈ sqrt( 1 -0.409 )= sqrt(0.591 )≈ 0.769 c.

So approximately 0.77c, which is option A.

But earlier, the invariant mass approach gave a negative gamma, which suggests that the assumption of all four particles moving in the same direction is incorrect.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, 0.91c.

Wait, let me compute gamma_A for 0.91c.

v =0.91c,

gamma =1/sqrt(1 - (0.91)^2 ) =1/sqrt(1 -0.8281 )=1/sqrt(0.1719 )≈1/0.414≈2.414.

So,

gamma_A=2.414.

Then,

v_A=0.91c.

So,

gamma_A =2.414 → E_A=2.414 *300=724.2 MeV.

Total energy from four A's:4 *724.2=2,896.8 MeV.

Initial energy: (1 + gamma ) m_p c² = (1 +2.414 ) *938 ≈3.414 *938≈3,192 MeV.

Hmm, so 2,896 MeV < 3,192 MeV. So energy isn't conserved. So that's a problem.

So this can't be the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the initial approximation, leading to v_A=0.77c, option A.

But earlier, the invariant mass approach leads to a contradiction, which suggests that the initial assumption is incorrect.

Given the time I have, I think I'll proceed with the initial approach, where v_A≈0.77c, which is option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the annihilation process:

### Key Equations and Assumptions
1. **Conservation of Momentum**:  
   The initial momentum is carried by the moving antiproton, and the final momentum is shared by the four particles \( A^\pm \). Assuming symmetry, all four particles are moving in the same direction with the same velocity \( v_A \).  
   \[
   4 \gamma_A m_A v_A = \gamma m_p v
   \]

2. **Conservation of Energy**:  
   The total energy of the initial system is the sum of the proton's rest energy and the antiproton's total energy. The final energy is the sum of the energies of the four \( A^\pm \) particles.  
   \[
   4 \gamma_A m_A c^2 = (1 + \gamma) m_p c^2
   \]

3. **Relating \( \gamma_A \) and \( v_A \)**:  
   The Lorentz factor for the \( A^\pm \) particles is given by:  
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2}}
   \]

4. **Simplification**:  
   Dividing the momentum equation by the energy equation eliminates \( \gamma_A \):  
   \[
   \frac{v_A}{c^2} = \frac{\gamma v}{(1 + \gamma) c^2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:  
   \[
   v_A = \frac{\gamma v}{1 + \gamma}
   \]

5. **Energy Relation for \( \gamma_A \)**:  
   From the energy equation:  
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{(1 + \gamma) m_p}{4 m_A}
   \]
   Substituting \( m_p c^2 = 938 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m_A c^2 = 300 \, \text{MeV} \):  
   \[
   \gamma_A = \frac{(1 + \gamma) \cdot 938}{4 \cdot 300} \approx 0.7817 (1 + \gamma)
   \]

6. **Relating \( \gamma_A \) and \( v_A \)**:  
   Using \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2}} \), substitute \( v_A \) from earlier:  
   \[
   \gamma_A = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \gamma}{2}}
   \]
   Equating the two expressions for \( \gamma_A \):  
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{1 + \gamma}{2}} = 0.7817 (1 + \gamma)
   \]
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   \frac{1 + \gamma}{2} = 0.611 (1 + \gamma)^2
   \]
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   1 + \gamma = \frac{1}{1.222}
   \]
   Solving gives:  
   \[
   1 + \gamma \approx 0.818 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \gamma \approx -0.182
   \]
   This result is unphysical, indicating an inconsistency in the assumptions.

### Approximation for Slow Antiproton
Given the antiproton is moving slowly, \( \gamma \approx 1 \). Substituting \( \gamma = 1 \) into \( \gamma_A \):  
\[
\gamma_A = \frac{2 m_p}{4 m_A} = \frac{938}{2 \cdot 300} \approx 1.563
\]
Using \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2}} \):  
\[
1.563 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v_A^2/c^2}}
\]
Squaring:  
\[
1.563^2 = \frac{1}{1 - v_A^2/c^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 - v_A^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{2.443} \approx 0.409
\]
\[
v_A^2/c^2 = 1 - 0.409 = 0.591 \quad \Rightarrow \quad v_A \approx \sqrt{0.591} c \approx 0.77c
\]

### Conclusion
The velocity of particle \( A \) is approximately \( 0.77c \), corresponding to **Option A**.
