Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. It's about an oscillating charge distribution that's spheroidal, and I'm supposed to figure out some radiation properties. Hmm, I remember from my electromagnetism class that oscillating charges can radiate energy, and the radiation has certain characteristics depending on the setup.

The question says the charge distribution is spheroid-shaped with the symmetry axis along the z-axis. So I'm picturing something like a prolate spheroid or an oblate spheroid, but the exact shape might not matter right now. The key is that it's oscillating, so it's a time-varying charge distribution that will radiate electromagnetic waves.

The radiation zone is where the fields have settled into their asymptotic forms, right? In that region, the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function f of lambda and theta, the angle from the z-axis. So f(λ, θ) gives the power per unit solid angle.

The maximum power is A. The question is asking for two things: the fraction of A radiated at θ=30 degrees and the form of f. The options give possibilities for both.

Let me break it down. First, the power radiated at a particular angle should relate to the radiation pattern of the dipole. Wait, because a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating along the z-axis would behave similarly to a dipole radiator, but perhaps more symmetric than a simple electric dipole.

Wait, no. Wait, a dipole's radiation pattern varies with cos(theta), but for higher multipoles, it can have different angular dependencies. But if the charge distribution is oscillating, the dominant term might be the dipole term. So the radiation pattern for a dipole is proportional to (1 + cos^2(theta))/2, right? So the maximum occurs when cos(theta) is +/-1, meaning theta=0 or 180 degrees. Wait, but the question is about theta=30 degrees, which is 30 degrees from the z-axis.

But wait, the problem says it's a spheroidal charge distribution. So maybe it's not exactly a dipole. Alternatively, perhaps the radiation pattern is different. I'm a bit confused.

Wait, but in the case of a dipole, the radiation pattern is maximum at the equator, which is 90 degrees. Oh wait no, no. Wait, for a dipole, the radiation pattern in the far field is (1 + cos²θ)/2. So when θ is 0, cosθ is 1, so the pattern is (1+1)/2=1. When θ is 90, cosθ is 0, so it's 0.5. So the maximum is at θ=0 and 180. So if the dipole is aligned along the z-axis, the maximum radiation is along the axis, wait no! Wait, I think I'm confusing the orientation. Wait, no, for a dipole moment p along z, the radiation pattern is maximum when θ=90 degrees, right? Because the dipole radiates perpendicular to its axis. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Wait, for a dipole, the electric field in the far zone is E = (something) * (e^{ikr}/r) * ( (p0 cosθ) / r ) ), but actually, the radiation pattern typically depends on sinθ for some terms. Wait, let me think again. The dipole's radiation is strongest in the equatorial plane. So θ=90 degrees would have maximum radiation. So when θ=0, the radiation is minimal, because the dipole's field along its axis is zero in the far field. Hmm, that seems correct. So for a dipole, the radiation pattern is maximum at θ=90 degrees.

Wait, but in this problem, the charge distribution is oscillating, and it's spheroid-shaped along the z-axis. So perhaps it's a dipole, but maybe it's a quadrupole or higher order? Well, I'm not sure, but let's think.

Wait, the problem says it's spheroidal, which suggests that it's not exactly a dipole. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dipole-like spheroid, so maybe it's a prolate spheroid, which is like a stretched dipole. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the radiation pattern for a spheroidal charge distribution has a certain form. I'm not recalling exactly, but maybe I can think about the angular dependence. 

Wait, the problem says that the power radiated per unit solid angle is a function f(λ, θ). The maximum power is A. So I need to find f(λ, θ) and the fraction of A when θ=30 degrees.

Let me think about the form of f. The power radiated per unit solid angle for an oscillating charge distribution—like an antenna—has a certain angular dependence. For a dipole, the power is proportional to sin^2(theta), but wait, no. Wait, for a dipole, the power per unit solid angle is proportional to (1 + cos^2(theta)), but I might be mixing up the exact form.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on this. Let me try to recall. The radiation pattern for a dipole is given by the electric field in the far zone. The electric field of a dipole is E = (1/(4πε0)) * (p0 ω² sinωt e^{ikr} (e_r cosθ - e_θ sinθ)) / r². But for the power, which is the Poynting vector, the average power is proportional to |E|^2. So the intensity (power per unit area) is proportional to sin²(theta). Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the intensity for a dipole is proportional to (1 + cos²(theta)).

Wait, no. Wait, the Poynting vector for dipole radiation is (1/(4π)) * (p0^2 ω^4) sin^2(theta) (e_r × e_θ) / (r^3 c), something like that. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach. The power radiated by a dipole is given by P = ( (μ0 p0^2 ω^4 ) / (12π c^3 )) ), but that's the total power. But when considering the angular dependence, the distribution would have a maximum at θ=90 degrees. So the radiation pattern is maximum at the equator.

So if the maximum power is A, then the fraction at θ=30 degrees would be a certain value. Let me think about that.

Wait, but to find the fraction, I need to compute f(λ) at θ=30 degrees and then divide by A. So f is the power per solid angle, and A is the maximum value of f. So the fraction would be f(theta)/ A.

Hmm. So what's the form of f? The options give possible dependencies on lambda. So the question is whether f depends on lambda as lambda^(-3), lambda^(-4), etc.

Wait, the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to (1/lambda^4), since power is energy per unit time, and energy scales with 1/lambda, and frequency scales with 1/lambda, so power would be 1/lambda^4? Or wait, let's think.

Wait, the power radiated by a dipole is given by P = ( (μ0 p0^2 ω^4 ) / (12π c^3 )) ). So ω is 2π c / lambda, because the speed of light is c = f lambda → f = c/lambda → ω=2π f = 2π c / lambda. So ω^4 is (2π c / lambda)^4. So substituting that into P gives:

P = μ0/(12 π c^3) * p0^2 * ( (2 π c)^4 ) / lambda^4 )

Simplify that: 2^4 is 16, (pi)^4 / (12 pi) would be pi^3/12 ... but the exact scaling is that P is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

So if the maximum power A is proportional to 1/lambda^4, then f, which is power per unit solid angle, would also have this dependence, unless the angular part introduces another scaling.

Wait, but f is the function per unit solid angle, so the scaling of f with lambda would be the same as A, since f is A times some angular function. So for each theta, f = A * (angular dependence). So the lambda dependence is the same for f as for A, which is 1/lambda^4. Looking at the options, option C and A have lambda^(-4). Option C has 1/4 as the fraction, and lambda^(-4). Option A has 1/2, lambda^-4.

Wait, but the question is about the form of f. So f would depend on lambda as 1/lambda^4, so the options C and A are possible.

Now, the angular part. The maximum of f is A. So f(theta) is A multiplied by the angular function. So for the fraction, f(theta)/A = angular function.

So, if the angular function is (something), like (1 + cos^2(theta))/2 for a dipole, then at theta=30 degrees, what's the value?

Wait, let's compute (1 + cos^2(theta))/2 when theta is 30 degrees. Cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866. So cos^2(theta) is 3/4. So 1 + 3/4 = 7/4. Divide by 2: 7/8. So the fraction would be 7/8 of the maximum power. But wait, that can't be right because the maximum of the dipole pattern is at theta=90 degrees, where cos(theta)=0. So wait, the maximum is at theta=90, where the pattern is (1+0)/2 = 1/2? No, wait, that can't be. Maybe I'm getting the pattern wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. The dipole radiation pattern is symmetric in theta. The maximum occurs at theta=90 degrees. The formula for the intensity (or the power per unit solid angle) is proportional to (1 + cos^2(theta))/2. So the maximum is when cos(theta)=0 (theta=90), which gives (1 +0)/2 = 1/2. Wait, but that can't be the maximum. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm mixing the terms.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (3 cos^2(theta) ) / (4), which would have a maximum at theta=0. No, that doesn't make sense either. Alternatively, perhaps it's (sin^2(theta)) which peaks at theta=90.

Wait, let's think about the radiation from a dipole. The far-field electric field for a dipole is given by E = ( (p0 ω² e^{ikr} ) / (4πε0 c² r ) ) (e_θ sinθ). Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the electric field in the far zone is:

E = ( (p0 ω²) / (4π ε0 c² r) ) (e_r cosθ - e_θ sinθ) e^{iωt}.

But the intensity (Poynting vector) is proportional to E². So the intensity would be proportional to (e_r cosθ - e_θ sinθ)².

Expanding that, cos²θ + sin²θ - 2 cosθ sinθ e_r · e_θ. But e_r and e_θ are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. So the intensity is proportional to cos²θ + sin²θ = 1? That can't be right because that would imply isotropic radiation, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the cross product in the Poynting vector. Wait, the Poynting vector S is E × H. For a dipole, H is in the opposite direction of E, perhaps, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I should refer to the standard radiation pattern for a dipole. From what I remember, the radiation pattern for a dipole is given by (2/3) (1 + cos²θ) in terms of the intensity, which is the power per unit area per unit solid angle. So the maximum occurs when cosθ=1 or -1, i.e., theta=0 or 180 degrees. Wait, no, that would imply maximum along the axis. But I thought earlier that dipoles radiated more in the equatorial plane.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The dipole's radiation is strongest in the plane perpendicular to its axis, so theta=90 degrees. So the maximum in the intensity occurs at theta=90 degrees.

Wait, let's compute the expression (1 + cos^2(theta))/2. At theta=0, this is (1+1)/2=1. At theta=90, (1+0)/2=0.5. Wait, that would mean the maximum is at theta=0, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the correct radiation pattern is (3/4) sin^2(theta), which peaks at theta=90 degrees. Alternatively, perhaps the correct factor is (3/8) (1 + cos^2(theta)), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the radiation pattern is proportional to sin^2(theta), which would peak at theta=90 degrees. That makes more sense for a dipole. So if the intensity is proportional to sin^2(theta), then at theta=30 degrees, sin(theta)=0.5, so sin^2(theta)=0.25. So the fraction of the maximum A would be 0.25.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact angular dependence. Let's see. The dipole's radiation pattern is usually given as a function that has maximum at theta=90 degrees. So if the function is (3/4) sin²(theta), then at theta=30, sin(theta)=0.5, so sin²(theta)=0.25. The maximum would be 3/4, so the fraction would be (3/4 * 0.25) / (3/4) ) = 0.25, so 25% of A. So the fraction is 1/4, and the form of f is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/4 with lambda^(-4). So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but why is the form of f lambda^(-4)? Because the power radiated scales as 1/lambda^4, as we discussed earlier. So f would have the same scaling.

So the fraction is 1/4, and f ∝ lambda^(-4). So the correct option is C.

The problem involves an oscillating spheroidal charge distribution with its symmetry axis along the z-axis. This system radiates power, and the radiated power per unit solid angle is a function \( f(\lambda, \theta) \), where \( \lambda \) is the wavelength and \( \theta \) is the angle from the z-axis. The goal is to determine the fraction of the maximum power \( A \) radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) and the form of \( f \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Radiation Pattern and Angular Dependence**:  
   For a spheroidal charge distribution oscillating along the z-axis, the radiation pattern is analogous to a dipole radiator. The power radiated per unit solid angle is proportional to \( \sin^2(\theta) \), which peaks at \( \theta = 90^\circ \) (equatorial plane). At \( \theta = 30^\circ \), \( \sin(30^\circ) = 0.5 \), so \( \sin^2(30^\circ) = 0.25 \). This means the fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 0.25 \), or \( 1/4 \).

2. **Dependence on Wavelength**:  
   The total radiated power \( P \) for an oscillating dipole scales as \( P \propto 1/\lambda^4 \). Since \( f(\lambda, \theta) \) represents the power per unit solid angle, it inherits the same wavelength dependence. Thus, \( f(\lambda, \theta) \propto 1/\lambda^4 \).

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Among the given options, only **Option C** matches both the angular fraction \( 1/4 \) and the wavelength dependence \( \lambda^{-4} \).

### Conclusion:
The fraction of the maximum power radiated at \( \theta = 30^\circ \) is \( 1/4 \), and the form of \( f \) is proportional to \( \lambda^{-4} \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

So the intensity (power per unit area) is proportional to sin²(theta). Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the intensity for a dipole is proportional to (1 + cos²(theta)).

Wait, another approach. The power radiated by a dipole is given by P = ( (μ0 p0^2 ω^4 ) / (12π c^3 )) ), but that's the total power. But when considering the angular dependence, the distribution would have a maximum at θ=90 degrees. So the radiation pattern is maximum at the equator.

So if the maximum power is A, then the fraction at θ=30 degrees would be a certain value. Let me think about that.

Hmm. So what's the form of f? The options give possible dependencies on lambda. So the question is whether f depends on lambda as lambda^(-3), lambda^(-4), etc.

Wait, the power radiated by an oscillating dipole is proportional to (1/lambda^4), since power is energy per unit time, and energy scales with 1/lambda, and frequency scales with 1/lambda, so power would be 1/lambda^4? Or wait, let's think.

Wait, the power radiated by a dipole is given by P = ( (μ0 p0^2 ω^4 ) / (12π c^3 )) ). So ω is 2π c / lambda, because the speed of light is c = f lambda → f = c/lambda → ω=2π f = 2π c / lambda. So ω^4 is (2π c / lambda)^4. So substituting that into P gives:

P = μ0/(12 π c^3) * p0^2 * ( (2 π c)^4 ) / lambda^4 )

Simplify that: 2^4 is 16, (pi)^4 / (12 pi) would be pi^3/12 ... but the exact scaling is that P is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

So if the maximum power A is proportional to 1/lambda^4, then f, which is power per unit solid angle, would also have this dependence, unless the angular part introduces another scaling.

Wait, but f is the function per unit solid angle, so the scaling of f with lambda would be the same as A, since f is A times some angular function. So for each theta, f = A * (angular dependence). So the lambda dependence is the same for f as for A, which is 1/lambda^4. Looking at the options, option C and A have lambda^(-4). Option C has 1/4 as the fraction, and lambda^(-4). Option A has 1/2, lambda^-4.

Wait, but the question is about the form of f. So f would depend on lambda as 1/lambda^4, so the options C and A are possible.

Now, the angular part. The maximum of f is A. So f(theta) is A multiplied by the angular function. So for the fraction, f(theta)/A = angular function.

So, if the angular function is (something), like (1 + cos^2(theta))/2 for a dipole, then at theta=30 degrees, what's the value?

Wait, let's compute (1 + cos^2(theta))/2 when theta is 30 degrees. Cos(30) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866. So cos^2(theta) is 3/4. So 1 + 3/4 = 7/4. Divide by 2: 7/8. So the fraction would be 7/8 of the maximum power. But wait, that can't be right because the maximum of the dipole pattern is at theta=90 degrees, where cos(theta)=0. So wait, the maximum is at theta=90, where the pattern is (1+0)/2 = 1/2? No, wait, that can't be. Maybe I'm getting the pattern wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think again. The dipole radiation pattern is symmetric in theta. The maximum occurs at theta=90 degrees. The formula for the intensity (or the power per unit solid angle) is proportional to (1 + cos^2(theta))/2. So the maximum is when cos(theta)=0 (theta=90), which gives (1 +0)/2 = 1/2. Wait, but that can't be the maximum. Wait, wait, perhaps I'm mixing the terms.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (3 cos^2(theta) ) / (4), which would have a maximum at theta=0. No, that doesn't make sense either. Alternatively, perhaps it's (sin^2(theta)) which peaks at theta=90.

Wait, let's think about the radiation from a dipole. The far-field electric field for a dipole is given by E = ( (p0 ω² e^{ikr} ) / (4πε0 c² r ) ) (e_θ sinθ). Wait, no, perhaps more accurately, the electric field in the far zone is:

E = ( (p0 ω²) / (4π ε0 c² r) ) (e_r cosθ - e_θ sinθ) e^{iωt}.

But the intensity (Poynting vector) is proportional to E². So the intensity would be proportional to (e_r cosθ - e_θ sinθ)².

Expanding that, cos²θ + sin²θ - 2 cosθ sinθ e_r · e_θ. But e_r and e_θ are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. So the intensity is proportional to cos²θ + sin²θ = 1? That can't be right because that would imply isotropic radiation, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Alternatively, maybe I should consider the cross product in the Poynting vector. Wait, the Poynting vector S is E × H. For a dipole, H is in the opposite direction of E, perhaps, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the radiation pattern is proportional to sin^2(theta), which would peak at theta=90 degrees. That makes more sense for a dipole. So if the intensity is proportional to sin^2(theta), then at theta=30 degrees, sin(theta)=0.5, so sin^2(theta)=0.25. So the fraction of the maximum A would be 0.25.

Wait, but I'm not certain about the exact angular dependence. Let's see. The dipole's radiation pattern is usually given as a function that has maximum at theta=90 degrees. So if the function is (3/4) sin²(theta), then at theta=30, sin(theta)=0.5, so sin²(theta)=0.25. The maximum would be 3/4, so the fraction would be (3/4 * 0.25) / (3/4) ) = 0.25, so 25% of A. So the fraction is 1/4, and the form of f is proportional to 1/lambda^4.

Looking at the options, option C is 1/4 with lambda^(-4). So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but why is the form of f lambda^(-4)? Because the power radiated scales as 1/lambda^4, as we discussed earlier. So f would have the same scaling.

So the fraction is 1/4, and f ∝ lambda^(-4). So the correct option is C.
