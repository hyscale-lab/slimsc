Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that has to do with particles bouncing off without losing energy, right?

The given data are phase shifts: δ₀ is 90 degrees, δ₁ is 67, δ₂ is 55, δ₃ is 30, and δ₄ is 13 degrees. Oh wait, phase shifts are part of scattering theory, like in partial wave analysis. Each phase shift corresponds to a different angular momentum state, I think. 

The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by something involving the phase shifts. Oh right! The formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) e^{2iδ_l} sin(2δ_l), summed over all l. But wait, the question is specifically along the incident beam direction, which I think corresponds to θ=0 degrees. So maybe the formula simplifies at θ=0.

Wait another thing, in the case of θ=0, the scattering is along the same direction as the incident beam. For that, the formula might involve just the sum of (2l +1) sin δ_l times something. Let me think. Oh, right! The formula for f(θ) for θ=0 is f(0) = (1/(2ik)) [ -2i Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l ].

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the terms. Let me recall. The general formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ), where P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But at θ=0, P_l(1) is 1 for l=0 and 0 otherwise. So only the l=0 term contributes? Wait no, because P_0 is 1, but higher l terms have P_l(1)=0? Wait, for l=0, P_0=1; l=1, P_1(x)=x, so at x=1, that's 1; wait no, wait, P_1(1) is 1, but higher l terms like P_l(1) is 1 for all l, isn't that right? Wait, no, that's not correct. The Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is always 1 for any l. Because P_l(1) = 1 for all l. So, for θ=0, all terms contribute. Oh, so f(0) would be (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ].

Wait, but the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So I'm interested in Im[f(0)]. Let's calculate that.

So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ].

Let me expand e^{2iδ_l} -1. Using Euler's formula, e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ. So e^{2iδ_l} = cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l). Subtract 1: [cos(2δ_l) -1 ] + i sin(2δ_l).

So [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] = 2i sin(δ_l) e^{iδ_l} }? Wait, wait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ].

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the imaginary part of f(0).

Let me write f(0) as (1/(2ik)) times the sum. Let's compute the sum first.

Sum = Σ (2l +1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ]

Each term in the sum is (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) = (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l) ]

So the sum has real and imaginary parts. Since f(0) is multiplied by 1/(2ik), which is -i/(2k), because 1/(ik) = -i/k.

So f(0) = [1/(2ik)] * Sum = [1/(2ik)] [ Sum_real + i Sum_imaginary ]

Let me compute it step by step. The sum can be written as (A + i B), where A is the real part and B is the imaginary part.

So,

f(0) = (A + iB) / (2ik) = [A/(2ik)] + [iB/(2ik)] = [A/(2ik)] + [B/(2k)]

But 1/k = 1/(2πħ c), but maybe I don't need the units yet.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of f(0). Let's compute Im[f(0)].

So f(0) = [A/(2ik)] + [B/(2k)]

Expressed as:

A/(2ik) = A/(2i k) = [A/(2k)] * (1/i) = [A/(2k)] (-i)

So f(0) = [ -i A/(2k) ) ] + [ B/(2k) ]

Which is (B/(2k)) - i (A/(2k)).

So the imaginary part is -A/(2k). 

Alternatively, I can write Im(f(0)) = -A/(2k), where A is the real part of the sum.

But A is the sum of the real parts of each (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) term. 

Wait, but maybe I should calculate the sum differently. Let me think again.

Each term in the sum is (2l+1)( e^{2iδ_l} -1 )

= (2l+1) [ cos(2δ_l) -1 + i sin(2δ_l) ]

So the real part is (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) -1 ), and the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

So the sum over l of [real parts] is Σ (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) -1 ), and the sum of [imaginary parts] is Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

So f(0) = [Sum_real + i Sum_imag ] / (2ik)

= [Sum_real + i Sum_imag ] / (2ik )

Which can be written as [Sum_real/(2ik)] + [i Sum_imag/(2ik) ]

Simplify each term:

Sum_real/(2ik) = (Sum_real) * (1/(2ik)) = (Sum_real) * (-i)/(2k)

Similarly, i Sum_imag/(2ik) = Sum_imag/(2k)

So f(0) = [ Sum_imag/(2k) ) ] - i (Sum_real)/(2k )

So the imaginary part of f(0) is [ - Sum_real/(2k) ]

So Im(f(0)) = - Sum_real / (2k )

Wait, but let's make sure. The imaginary part of f(0) is the coefficient of i in the expression.

So f(0) is (Sum_real + i Sum_imag)/(2ik) = [ Sum_real/(2ik) ) + (i Sum_imag)/(2ik) ]

Simplify each term:

Sum_real/(2ik) = Sum_real/(2i k) = (Sum_real / k ) * (1/(2i)) 

Which is (Sum_real / k )*( -i/2 )

Because 1/(2i) = -i/(2)

Similarly, (i Sum_imag)/(2ik ) = (i Sum_imag)/(2ik ) = Sum_imag/(2k )

So f(0) = [ Sum_imag/(2k) ) ] - i ( Sum_real )/(2k )

Therefore, the imaginary part of f(0) is Im(f(0)) = - Sum_real/(2k )

So, yes, Im(f(0)) = - Sum_real/(2k )

But I'm probably making a mistake somewhere, but let's proceed.

So Sum_real is Σ (2l +1) [ cos(2 δ_l ) -1 ]

Wait, wait. Because each term is (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) -1 ), so that's the real part.

But wait, all the phase shifts given are for specific l values. Let's see, the phase shifts given are δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, δ₄. So l=0,1,2,3,4.

So our sum will be over l=0 to l=4.

So Sum_real = Σ_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) [ cos(2δ_l) -1 ]

Let me compute each term.

Let me compute each (2l+1) [ cos(2δ_l) -1 ] term.

For l=0: δ₀ =90 degrees, which is π/2 radians.

cos(2*90 degrees) = cos(180 degrees) = -1.

So [cos(2δ_0) -1 ] = (-1) -1 = -2.

Multiply by (2l+1) =1. So term is 1 * (-2 )= -2.

For l=1: δ₁=67 degrees. 2δ₁=134 degrees. cos(134 degrees) is approximately cos(180−46) = -cos(46 degrees). Cos(46) ≈ 0.6947. So cos(134)≈ -0.6947.

So [cos(2δ₁) -1 ] ≈ (-0.6947) -1 ≈ -1.6947.

Multiply by (2*1 +1)=3. So 3*(-1.6947)≈ -5.0841.

For l=2: δ₂=55 degrees. 2δ₂=110 degrees. Cos(110) is cos(90+20) = -sin(20) ≈-0.3420.

So [cos(2δ₂) -1 ]≈ (-0.3420) -1= -1.3420.

Multiply by (2*2+1)=5: 5*(-1.3420)= -6.71.

l=3: δ₃=30 degrees. 2δ=60 degrees. Cos(60)=0.5.

[0.5 -1 ]= -0.5. Multiply by (2*3+1)=7: 7*(-0.5)=-3.5.

l=4: δ₄=13 degrees. 2δ=26 degrees. Cos(26)≈0.8988.

[0.8988 -1 ]= -0.1012. Multiply by (2*4 +1)=9: 9*(-0.1012)= -0.9108.

Now sum all these terms:

l=0: -2
l=1: -5.0841 → total so far: -7.0841
l=2: -6.71 → total: -13.7941
l=3: -3.5 → total: -17.2941
l=4: -0.9108 → total: -18.2049

So Sum_real ≈ -18.2049.

Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure about the precision here. Maybe I should compute more accurately.

Wait, for l=1: 2δ₁=134 degrees. Let me compute cos(134 degrees) more accurately.

134 degrees is in the second quadrant. Cos(134) = -cos(46). Cos(46) is approximately 0.69465837. So cos(134)= -0.69465837.

So [cos(2δ₁) -1 ] = (-0.69465837) -1 = -1.69465837. Multiply by 3: 3*(-1.69465837 )= -5.0839751.

For l=2: 2δ=110 degrees. Cos(110) = cos(90+20)= -sin(20). Sin(20)=0.3420201433. So cos(110)= -0.3420201433.

So [cos(2δ₂) -1 ]= (-0.3420201433) -1 = -1.3420201433. Multiply by 5: 5*(-1.3420201433 )= -6.7101007165.

For l=3: 2δ=60 degrees. cos(60)= 0.5. So [0.5 -1 ]= -0.5. Multiply by 7: 7*(-0.5)= -3.5.

For l=4: 2δ=26 degrees. Cos(26)= approximately 0.8987940463. So [0.8987940463 -1 ]= -0.1012059537. Multiply by 9: 9*(-0.1012059537 )= -0.9108535833.

Adding all these:

l=0: -2

l=1: -5.0839751 → sum -7.0839751

l=2: -6.7101007165 → sum -13.79407582

l=3: -3.5 → sum -17.29407582

l=4: -0.9108535833 → sum -18.2049294033.

So Sum_real ≈ -18.2049.

So Im(f(0)) = - Sum_real / (2k )

Wait, but what is k here? k is the wave number. Wait, the electrons have 50 MeV energy. So I need to find k in terms of the given energy.

Electron mass is about 0.511 MeV/c², so 50 MeV is much higher, so relativistic effects are important. But maybe the formula for k uses the non-relativistic expression? Or perhaps it's given in terms of the wavelength.

Wait, the wave number k is given by k = sqrt( (2mE) ) / ħ, but wait, that's for the non-relativistic case. But for high energies, we might need to use relativistic expressions.

Alternatively, maybe the problem provides a way to compute k. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the relation k = (E/(ħ²))^(1/2) * something. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the momentum p, where k = p/ħ.

Wait, for an electron of energy E, the momentum p is given by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

But given that E is 50 MeV and m c² is 0.511 MeV, E is much larger, so E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E / c.

But let me compute it more accurately.

E =50 MeV.

m c² = 0.511 MeV.

So p = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / c ≈ (50 ) / c.

But for high E, the sqrt(E² - m² c^4 ) ≈ E - (m² c^4 )/(2 E )

So p ≈ E/c * [1 - (m² c^4)/(2 E²) ) ]

But since E is 50 MeV, much larger than m c², so p ≈ E/c.

But perhaps the formula for k uses E/(ħ c) ?

Wait, let me think in terms of units. The scattering amplitude f has units of length (in fm, for example). So when I compute Im(f(0)), I need to ensure that the units come out right.

The formula for Im(f(0)) is Im(f) = [ Sum_real ]/(2 k ) ?

Wait, no, earlier I thought Im(f(0)) = - Sum_real/(2k ). But wait, let me recheck.

Wait, in the earlier steps, I have Im(f(0)) = - Sum_real/(2k )

Sum_real is a dimensionless quantity because each term is (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) -1 ), which is dimensionless.

So k must have units of 1/length, so 1/k has units of length.

So the imaginary part of f(0) is Sum_real/(2k ), which would have units of length, which makes sense.

So I need to compute k.

k is the wave number, which is given by k = p/(ħ), where p is the momentum.

But p = gamma m v, but perhaps using E = sqrt( (pc )^2 + (m c^2 )^2 )

So solving for p: p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 ) / c

Hmm, but energy is given in MeV, and I need to express k in units that would give f in fm.

Wait, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm (since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, I think). So perhaps I can express k in terms of E.

Wait, let me compute k in terms of E.

p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 ) / c

But E =50 MeV, m c²=0.511 MeV.

So p ≈ E/c, because E >> m c².

p ≈ 50 MeV / c

But ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, so p = 50 / c (MeV) ) = (50 / 197.33 MeV·fm/c ) ) * (ħ c) ) ?

Wait, perhaps using p = (E ) / (ħ c )

Because p = E/(ħ c ) * ħ c² /c ?

Wait, not sure. Let me think about units.

E has units MeV.

ħ has units MeV·fm / (c), because ħ c is about 197 MeV·fm.

Wait, ħ has units J·s, but in terms of energy and length, J = MeV, s = fm (since c=3e8 m/s, 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so s = (fm c)/c ), but perhaps getting confused.

Alternatively, let's compute k.

k = p / ħ.

p is in units of MeV/c.

So p = (E )/(c) when E >> m c².

So p = E/(c) = (50 MeV )/(c )

But ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So 1/(c ) = ħ / ( ħ c )

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Alternatively, perhaps k can be written as:

k = (E )/( ħ c )

Because p = E/c, so k = p/ħ = (E/(c )) / ħ = E/( ħ c )

So k = E/( ħ c )

Given that ħ c ≈ 197 MeV·fm, so for E=50 MeV,

k = 50 / (197.33 ) ≈ 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

Wait, so k ≈ 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

But wait, wait. Let me compute more accurately.

ħ c = 197.327 MeV·fm.

So for E=50 MeV,

k = (50 MeV ) / (197.327 MeV·fm ) ) = 50 / 197.327 ≈ 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈ 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So Sum_real is approximately -18.2049, and 2k is about 0.5066 fm^{-1}.

Wait, no. 2k is 2*0.2533 ≈ 0.5066 fm^{-1}.

So the imaginary part of f(0) is Im(f(0)) = - Sum_real/(2k )

So Sum_real is -18.2049.

So:

Im(f(0)) = - ( -18.2049 ) / ( 2 * 0.2533 )

= 18.2049 / (0.5066 )

Compute that: 18.2049 / 0.5066 ≈ ?

Let's compute 18.2049 ÷ 0.5066.

0.5066 × 36 = about 18.2376, which is just a bit higher than 18.2049.

So 36 × 0.5066 is 18.2376.

So 18.2049 is a bit less than 36 × 0.5066. Let's get more precise.

Compute 0.5066 * 35.9 = ?

0.5066 * 35 = 17.731

0.5066 * 0.9 = 0.45594 → total 17.731 + 0.45594 = 18.18694.

Difference from 18.2049: 18.2049 -18.18694 = 0.01796.

How much more than 35.9? Each 0.1 gives 0.05066. So 0.01796 / 0.05066 ≈ 0.3545. So 35.9 + 0.3545 = 36.2545? Wait, no, wait. Hmm, let me think better.

Wait, 0.5066 × x = 18.2049.

x = 18.2049 / 0.5066 ≈ 

Let me compute 18.2049 ÷ 0.5066.

0.5066 * 36 = 18.2376 (as before). The actual value is 18.2049, which is 18.2376 - 0.0327 less.

So, the value is 36 - (0.0327 / 0.5066 ) ≈ 36 - 0.0645 ≈ 35.9355.

So approximately 35.9355.

Wait, but let's compute 18.2049 / 0.5066 accurately.

Let me compute 18.2049 ÷ 0.5066.

Let me set it up as 182049 ÷ 5066 → because 18.2049 is 182049 × 1e-4, and 0.5066 is 5066 × 1e-4.

So 182049 ÷ 5066.

Compute 5066 × 35 = 5066 *30=151,980; 5066*5=25,330 → total 177,310.

5066 *36 = 177,310 +5066 =182,376.

But 182,049 is less than that.

182,049 - 177,310 = 4,739.

So 35 + (4739 /5066 ) → 35 + approx 0.9354 → 35.9354.

So 35.9354 ≈35.935.

So Im(f(0)) ≈35.935.

But wait, the options given are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Wait, my calculation gives around 35.9 fm, which isn't among the options. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, what's the problem? Did I make a mistake somewhere in the steps? Let me check.

First, the approach: I used the formula for Im(f(0)) = - Sum_real/(2k )

Sum_real ≈-18.2049, k≈0.2533 fm^{-1}, so 2k ≈0.5066 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f(0)) = 18.2049 / 0.5066 ≈35.9 fm.

But the options are all around 177 fm or so. Hmm, that's a big discrepancy.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for Im(f(0)).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = Sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) / (2k )

Wait, where did I go wrong earlier? Let me re-express the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of the phase shifts.

The general expression is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} (sin δ_l)^2 [ 1 - cosθ ] / [ 1 + ... ] ?

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the correct formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by Im(f(θ))= (1/(2k )) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l [ 1 - cosθ ].

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, let me refer to the partial wave expansion.

The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} P_l(cosθ )

The imaginary part of f(θ) is Im(f(θ)) = (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) P_l(cosθ )

Wait, but for θ=0, P_l(1)=1 for all l, so:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l )

Wait, this is different from what I had before. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach.

So if this is the case, then Im(f(0)) = [1/(2k)] Σ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l )

So for each l, compute (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l )

Let me compute each term again with this correct formula.

So for l=0: δ_0=90 degrees. 2δ_0=180 degrees. sin(180)=0. So term is (1)*0=0.

l=1: δ=67 degrees. 2δ=134 degrees. sin(134)=sin(180-46)= sin(46)≈0.7193.

Multiply by (2*1+1)=3 → 3*0.7193 ≈2.1579.

l=2: δ=55 degrees. 2δ=110 degrees. sin(110)=sin(70)≈0.9397.

Multiply by 5 →5*0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3: δ=30 degrees. 2δ=60. sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660.

Multiply by7 →7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4: δ=13 degrees. 2δ=26. sin(26)≈0.4384.

Multiply by9 →9*0.4384≈3.9456.

Now sum these terms:

l=0: 0

l=1: ~2.1579 → total 2.1579

l=2: ~4.6985 → total 6.8564

l=3: ~6.062 → total 12.9184

l=4: ~3.9456 → total ~16.864.

So Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ≈16.864.

So Im(f(0)) = [1/(2k)] * 16.864.

Now, k is E/(ħ c ), E=50 MeV.

We have ħ c≈197.33 MeV fm.

So k=50 / 197.33 ≈0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So 2k≈0.5066 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f(0)) = 16.864 / (2 * 0.2533 )

Wait, no. Wait, Im(f(0))= [ Σ ... ]/(2k )

Which is 16.864 / (2 * 0.2533 )

So 2*0.2533=0.5066.

16.864 / 0.5066 ≈ ?

Compute 16.864 ÷ 0.5066.

0.5066 *33= 16.7178 → 33 *0.5066=16.7178.

16.864 -16.7178=0.1462.

0.1462 /0.5066 ≈0.2886.

So 33 +0.2886≈33.2886.

So Im(f(0))≈33.2886 fm.

Wait, but the options are way higher (like 177 fm). Hmm, this suggests that either my approach is wrong or I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps I forgot a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, the formula for Im(f) is (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

Wait, but perhaps the correct formula is (1/(2ik)) Σ ... which when you take the imaginary part, gives a different factor.

Wait, another approach: let me refer to the partial wave expansion. The general expression for f(θ) is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^infty (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ )

But I'm interested in Im(f(0)).

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1 for all l.

So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ]

= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ cos(2δ_l) -1 + i sin(2δ_l) ]

= (1/(2ik)) [ sum (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) -1 ) + i sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ]

So, f(0) = [ sum_real + i sum_imag ] / (2ik )

The imaginary part of f(0) is the imaginary component of this expression.

So f(0) = [ sum_real/(2ik) ) + sum_imag/(2k) ) ]

Because i/(2ik) = 1/(2k ).

Thus, the imaginary part is sum_imag/(2k )

Wait, earlier I thought it was -sum_real/(2k ), but perhaps I made a mistake there. Let me re-express.

The expression is [ sum_real + i sum_imag ] / (2ik )

= sum_real/(2ik) + i sum_imag/(2ik )

= sum_real/(2ik) + sum_imag/(2k )

So, f(0) = [ sum_real/(2ik) ) ] + [ sum_imag/(2k ) ]

The imaginary part is the coefficient of i, which is [ sum_imag/(2k ) ]

Wait, but in this case, the imaginary part is sum_imag/(2k )

Because the first term is sum_real/(2ik ), which is real times 1/(2ik ). So,

sum_real/(2ik ) = sum_real/(2i k ) → which is a purely imaginary term with coefficient sum_real/(2k ) * ( -i )

So the imaginary part of f(0) is [ sum_imag/(2k ) ] + [ sum_real/(2k ) ] * (-1 )

Wait, that complicates things. So perhaps I should compute Im(f(0)) as:

Im(f(0)) = ( sum_imag )/(2k ) + ( sum_real )/(2k ) * (-1 )

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me compute it properly.

Let me express f(0) as A + i B, where A is the real part and B is the imaginary part.

f(0) = ( sum_real + i sum_imag ) / (2ik )

Express denominator: 2ik = 2i k

So,

f(0) = [ sum_real + i sum_imag ] / ( 2i k )

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

= [ (sum_real + i sum_imag ) (-i) ] / ( 2 i k (-i) )

Denominator: 2i k (-i)= 2i*(-i) k = 2 (1) k = 2k.

Numerator: 

- i sum_real + sum_imag.

So,

f(0) = [ (-i sum_real + sum_imag ) ] / ( 2k )

Which can be written as:

f(0) = [ sum_imag / (2k) ) ] + [ (-i sum_real ) / (2k) ]

So the imaginary part is the coefficient of i, which is (- sum_real )/(2k )

Wait, because the term is ( -i sum_real ) / (2k ), which is i multiplied by ( - sum_real )/(2k )

So the imaginary part of f(0) is Im(f(0)) = ( sum_imag )/(2k ) ?

No, wait. Wait, f(0) is sum_imag/(2k ) - i ( sum_real )/(2k )

So, the imaginary part is [ - sum_real ]/(2k )

Wait, no. The imaginary part is the coefficient of i. So f(0) is (sum_imag/(2k )) + ( - sum_real/(2k ) ) * i.

So the imaginary part is (- sum_real )/(2k )

Wait, so that would give Im(f(0)) = - sum_real/(2k )

But earlier, in the alternative approach, I got Im(f(0)) = sum_imag/(2k )

Which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct formula.

I remember that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

But I'm getting conflicting results from two different approaches. Let me think about a reference.

Wait, from scattering theory, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l +1) sin(2δ_l )

Because, as per the partial wave expansion, f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} P_l (cosθ )

So when θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l }

Taking the imaginary part:

Im f(0) = (1/(2k )) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

Which aligns with the previous calculation of 16.864/(2k )

Wait, but earlier I thought another formula where Im f(0) is - sum_real/(2k )

But according to the reference approach, it's (1/(2k )) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

So perhaps my initial approach was incorrect, and the correct formula is the latter.

So, with the correct formula, Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ) ] / (2k )

So I should compute sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

As I did earlier, which was 16.864.

Then, Im(f(0)) =16.864 / (2 * 0.2533 )

Which is 16.864 / 0.5066 ≈33.28 fm.

Hmm, but the options are much larger. Did I make a mistake in calculating k?

Wait, let's re-examine the calculation of k.

k= p/ħ, where p= sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

E=50 MeV, m c²=0.511 MeV.

So p= sqrt(50² -0.511² ) / c ≈50 / c.

But ħ c= 197.33 MeV fm.

Thus, p=50 MeV / c.

So k=p / ħ = [50 MeV / c ] / ħ = (50 ) / ( ħ c ) ) MeV fm.

Because ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So k=50 /197.33 ≈0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So that part is correct.

Hmm, but the options are in the hundreds of fm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k )

Wait, but that would give a smaller sum.

Wait, let's see:

sum (2l+1) sin δ_l for l=0 to4.

l=0: 1 * sin(90)=1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67) ≈3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)≈5 *0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)≈9 *0.2249=2.0241.

Sum: 1 +2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.0241≈13.3816.

So sum≈13.38.

Im(f(0))= 13.38/(2k )

k=0.2533 → 2k=0.5066.

13.38/0.5066≈26.42 fm.

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (1/(k)) without the 2 in denominator.

Wait, let me think about the correct formula.

The correct formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k )) sum (2l +1) sin(2 δ_l )

Which gives around 33 fm, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the formula Im(f(0)) = sum (2l +1) sin δ_l / (k )

Then, sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ≈13.38, k=0.2533 → 13.38 /0.2533 ≈52.8 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units of k.

Wait, k is in fm^{-1}, so 1/k is in fm.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong expression for k.

Wait, the momentum p is given by E = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m^2 c^4 ) → p c = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 ) where E and m are in units where c=1 (e.g., MeV).

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the units. Let me try a different approach.

The Compton wavelength is ħ/(m c ), but perhaps that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, let me compute the wavelength λ.

The de Broglie wavelength λ = h / p.

But in terms of k, k = 2π / λ.

So λ = 2π / k.

But for relativistic particles, E=pc.

So p= E/c.

So λ= h/( E/c )= (h c )/E.

But h=2 π ħ, so λ= (2 π ħ c ) / E.

So k=2π / λ= (2 π E )/( ħ c )

So k= (2 π E )/( ħ c )

With E=50 MeV, ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So k= (2 π *50 )/ (197.33 )

Compute numerator: 2 *3.1416 *50≈314.16.

Denominator:197.33.

k≈314.16 / 197.33 ≈1.589 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that's a different value of k. So earlier I thought k=0.2533, but perhaps that's wrong.

Wait, because I think I mixed up the formulas.

Let me clarify.

k = p / ħ.

p = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c.

But E=50 MeV, m c²=0.511 MeV.

So E^2 = (50)^2 =2500 (MeV)^2.

(m c²)^2= (0.511)^2≈0.261 (MeV)^2.

So E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 ≈2500 -0.261≈2499.739.

p c= sqrt(2499.739 )≈49.997 MeV.

So p= (49.997 MeV ) / c.

So now, k= p / ħ = (49.997 MeV / c ) / ( ħ )

But ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So 1/ħ c= 1/(197.33 MeV fm ) *c

Wait, perhaps better to express p in terms of ħ c.

p = (49.997 MeV ) / c.

So p= (49.997 )/(197.33 ) * ħ c / c = (49.997 )/(197.33 ) * ħ.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me compute k.

k= p / ħ.

p= (49.997 MeV ) / c.

So,

k= (49.997 MeV )/(c ) * (1/ħ )

= (49.997 MeV )/( c * ħ )

But c * ħ = 197.33 MeV fm.

So,

k= 49.997 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) = (49.997 ) / 197.33 fm^{-1} → ~0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So earlier calculation of k=0.2533 fm^{-1} is correct.

Hmm. So why are the options so much larger?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts. The given phase shifts are δ_0=90, δ_1=67, δ_2=55, δ_3=30, δ_4=13 degrees. So l goes from 0 to4.

Wait, another possibility is that the problem is asking for the imaginary part multiplied by something else, like 2ik.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for Im(f) multiplied by k or something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin(δ_l ), not multiplied by anything else.

Wait, let me try that.

sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

l=0: 1 * sin(90)=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)≈3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)≈5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)≈9 *0.2249≈2.0241.

Sum: 1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0241=13.3816.

So sum≈13.3816.

Hmm, if I multiply this by something, maybe I get the right answer.

Wait, the correct formula for Im(f(0)) is [sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ) ]/(2k )

Which was 16.864 / (2 *0.2533 )=16.864/0.5066≈33.28 fm.

But the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, 33 is not close to any of these. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is that the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (2k )

So use sum≈13.38.

Im(f)=13.38/(2*0.2533 )=13.38/(0.5066 )≈26.41 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, maybe the formula is Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) (1 - cos(2δ_l )) ]/(2k )

Which is the same as sum_real/(2k )

Which earlier was sum_real≈-18.2049.

So Im(f)= - sum_real/(2k ) =18.2049/(2*0.2533 )=18.2049/0.5066≈35.93 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) * 2.

So 2 *13.3816=26.763.

Then 26.763/(2k )=26.763/(0.5066 )≈52.8 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the phase shifts are in radians, not degrees. Did I make a mistake there?

Wait, the given phase shifts are in degrees: δ_0=90°, etc. So I converted correctly.

But in the calculation of sin(2 δ_l ), perhaps I should compute in radians.

Let me recompute the sum using radians.

Compute for each l:

l=0: δ=90°= π/2 →2δ= π radians.

sin(2δ)=sin(π)=0. So term=1 *0=0.

l=1: δ=67° → radians: 67*(pi/180)= approx 1.16937 radians.

2δ= 2.33874 radians.

sin(2.33874 )= sin(2.33874 ) ≈0.7193.

Multiply by3 →3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2: δ=55°=0.95993 radians. 2δ=1.91986 radians.

sin(1.91986 )=approx 0.9397.

Multiply by5 →5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3: δ=30°=0.5236 radians. 2δ=1.0472 radians.

sin(1.0472 )=0.8660.

Multiply by7 →7*0.8660=6.062.

l=4: δ=13°=0.22689 radians. 2δ=0.45378 radians.

sin(0.45378 )≈0.4384.

Multiply by9 →9*0.4384=3.9456.

So sum is 0 +2.1579 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456=16.864.

So same as before. So I didn't make a mistake in the conversion.

Hmm. Not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the imaginary part multiplied by k, not divided. Let me see.

If Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ) →16.864.

Multiply by k: 16.864 *0.2533≈4.273 fm.

No, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the real part, but that's less likely.

Wait, perhaps I should use the absolute value of the sum, but that doesn't change anything.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (2l+1) sin δ_l, not 2 delta.

Earlier, when I used sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, I got sum≈13.38.

Then, Im(f(0))=13.38/(2k )=26.41 fm.

No, still not matching options.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are not given for l=0 to4, but for l=1 to4, and l=0 is ignored. But the problem states to ignore the rest, implying that only the given phase shifts are considered. So l=0 to l=4.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using E in a different unit.

Wait, E=50 MeV. Did I compute k correctly?

Wait, another approach: the wavelength λ is given by λ= 2π/(k).

But earlier, I have k=0.2533 fm^{-1}, so λ=2π/(0.2533 )≈25.29 fm.

Which seems correct for a 50 MeV electron.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part multiplied by something else, like 1/k.

Wait, but no, the options are in fm.

Hmm, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (k )

Which would give 13.38 /0.2533≈52.85 fm.

Still not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ]

Which when considering the imaginary part would give Im(f)= [sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ) ]/(2k )

Which is 16.864/(2*0.2533 )=33.28 fm.

But none of the options is close.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is ~177 fm, which is roughly 5.3 times larger than 33.28.

Wait, 33.28 *5=166.4, close to option C (177.675 fm).

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k using E in eV.

Wait, no, because everything is in MeV, and the calculation should be okay.

Another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but I treated them as degrees.

Wait, no, the problem states the phase shifts are in degrees, e.g., δ_0=90°, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, not sin(2δ_l )

So let's compute sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which was 13.38 as before.

Im(f)=13.38/(2k )=26.41 fm.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l /k.

Which is 13.38 /0.2533≈52.85 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, and then multiply by 2.

Which gives 26.76 / (2k )=26.76 /0.5066≈52.85 fm.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) [1 - cos(2δ_l ) ].

Which is sum_real.

Which was -18.2049.

So Im(f)= - sum_real/(2k )=18.2049/(2 *0.2533 )=35.93 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the imaginary part of the differential cross-section, but no, the question is about the scattering amplitude.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the Born approximation, but the question doesn't specify that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct Im(f(0)) is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (k ).

Which is 13.38 /0.2533≈52.85 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the non-relativistic expression for k.

In non-relativistic, k = sqrt(2mE )/ħ.

E=50 MeV, m_e c²=0.511 MeV.

But units would have to be consistent. Let me compute in natural units where ħ=c=1.

In natural units, E=50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV.

k = sqrt( 2m E ) ) = sqrt(2 *0.511 *50 ) = sqrt(51.1 )≈7.15 MeV.

So k=7.15 MeV.

But in natural units, ħ c=197.33 MeV fm → 1 MeV^{-1} = 197.33 fm.

So k=7.15 MeV → k^{-1}=197.33 /7.15 ≈27.6 fm^{-1}.

So k≈27.6 fm^{-1}.

But earlier relativistic approach gave k≈0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So perhaps in the non-relativistic approach, which for 50 MeV electrons is not appropriate, but perhaps this is the intended approach.

Let me proceed.

Using non-relativistic k=27.6 fm^{-1}.

Now, using the formula Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )/(2k )

Sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )=16.864.

Hmm, 16.864/(2*27.6 )=16.864/(55.2 )≈0.3055 fm.

No, that's not matching options.

Alternatively, using sum (2l+1) sin δ_l=13.38.

Then 13.38/(2*27.6 )=13.38/(55.2 )≈0.2423 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-relativistic approach isn't correct for 50 MeV electrons.

Wait, this is tricky. I'm not seeing where the mistake is, but perhaps I should look for a pattern in the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm. Which is approximately two times 88.8375.

Hmm, wait, 50 MeV is given. The options involve numbers like 177, which is about 50 *3.54.

Wait, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

Earlier, when I used the formula Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ) ]/(2k ), I obtained ~33.28 fm. But the options are much larger.

Wait, option B is 355.35 fm. Which is about 10 times larger than 35.53.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator. If k was 0.05066 fm^{-1}, then 33.28 / (2*0.05066 )= 33.28/0.1013≈328.6 fm. Close to option B (355.35), but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, if in non-relativistic approach, k= sqrt(2mE ) / ħ.

But 2mE in non-relativistic is in units of MeV^2.

Wait, let me recompute k using non-relativistic approach.

In non-relativistic, E = p²/(2m ), so p= sqrt(2m E )

But in units where ħ= c=1,

E in MeV, m in MeV/c².

So p = sqrt( 2 * 0.511 MeV *50 MeV ) = sqrt(51.1 )≈7.15 MeV.

Then, k= p / ħ c → p in MeV/c, ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So,

k= (7.15 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm ) = 7.15 /197.33 fm^{-1} ≈0.0362 fm^{-1}.

So 2k=0.0724 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f)=16.864 /0.0724≈232.9 fm.

Close to option B (355.35) but not quite.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given for l=0 to4, but only the l=0 term contributes because higher terms are zero.

Wait, but l=0 phase shift is 90°, so e^{2iδ_0}= e^{i π}= -1.

So (2l+1)(e^{2iδ}-1 )=1*(-2)= -2.

So f(0)= (1/(2ik ))*(-2 )= (-1)/(ik )

Im(f(0))= Im( (-1)/(ik ) )

But 1/(ik )= -i/(k ), so (-1)/(ik )= i/(k ), whose imaginary part is 1/(k )

So Im(f(0))=1/k.

k=0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f(0))=1/0.2533 ≈3.946 fm.

But that's not matching any options.

Hmm, this is getting me nowhere. Perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option C, 177.675 fm, but I can't see how.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem is using a different formula where Im(f)= (sum (2l+1) ) / (k )

Sum (2l+1) from l=0 to4 is 1+3+5+7+9=25.

So 25 /k=25/0.2533 ≈98.68 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the sum is sum (2l+1) [1 - cos(2δ_l ) ]

Which is sum_real= -18.2049.

So Im(f)= - sum_real/(2k ) =18.2049/(2*0.2533 )=35.93 fm.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not listed. But the options suggest that the correct approach leads to an answer around 177 fm.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (k )

Sum=13.38, k=0.2533.

13.38 /0.2533≈52.85 fm.

Still not matching.

Another thought: perhaps I should multiply by 2π in some step.

Wait, if I have Im(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ) ]/( 2k )

Which is 16.864/(2 *0.2533 )=33.28 fm.

But to get to 177 fm, perhaps I should multiply by 5.33, which is 16/3.

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, let me recompute the sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

l=0: 1 * sin(180)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)=3 * sin(134 degrees )=3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5*0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Sum: 0 +2.1579+4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

Yes, that's correct.

So, I think I've exhausted all possibilities and can't find a way to match the options. Perhaps the correct answer is option C, 177.675 fm, but I'm not sure how to reach it.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) ] × [ 1/(k ) ]

Which gives 13.38 /0.2533 ≈52.85 fm.

But option C is 177.675 fm, which is 3.36 times larger. Hmm, 52.85 *3.36≈177.6.

Ah! Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by 2. So 52.85 *3.36=177.6.

But why multiply by 3.36?

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \), for elastic scattering of \( 50~\text{MeV} \) electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts provided are \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), and the task is to compute \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \) along the incident beam direction (\( \theta = 0^\circ \)).

### Key Formula
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at \( \theta = 0^\circ \) is given by:
\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l),
\]
where \( k \) is the wave number, calculated as \( k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} \), with \( E = 50~\text{MeV} \) and \( \hbar c \approx 197.33~\text{MeV·fm} \).

### Calculation of \( k \)
\[
k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.2533~\text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

### Sum of \( (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \)
For each \( l \), compute \( (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \):
- \( l = 0 \): \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_0) = \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \), term = \( 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \).
- \( l = 1 \): \( \delta_1 = 67^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_1) = \sin(134^\circ) \approx 0.7193 \), term = \( 3 \cdot 0.7193 \approx 2.1579 \).
- \( l = 2 \): \( \delta_2 = 55^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_2) = \sin(110^\circ) \approx 0.9397 \), term = \( 5 \cdot 0.9397 \approx 4.6985 \).
- \( l = 3 \): \( \delta_3 = 30^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_3) = \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.8660 \), term = \( 7 \cdot 0.8660 \approx 6.062 \).
- \( l = 4 \): \( \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_4) = \sin(26^\circ) \approx 0.4384 \), term = \( 9 \cdot 0.4384 \approx 3.9456 \).

Summing these terms:
\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \approx 0 + 2.1579 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 \approx 16.864.
\]

### Final Calculation of \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \)
Substitute into the formula:
\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{16.864}{2k} = \frac{16.864}{2 \cdot 0.2533} \approx \frac{16.864}{0.5066} \approx 33.28~\text{fm}.
\]

### Discrepancy with Options
The calculated value (\( \approx 33.28~\text{fm} \)) does not match any of the provided options. However, option \( C \) (\( 177.675~\text{fm} \)) is approximately \( 5.33 \) times larger than the computed result. This suggests a possible missing factor in the calculation, such as an error in interpreting the formula or the given phase shifts. Based on the options, the most reasonable choice is:

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question is asking about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, elastic scattering... I remember that has to do with particles bouncing off without losing energy, right?

The given data are phase shifts: δ₀ is 90 degrees, δ₁ is 67, δ₂ is 55, δ₃ is 30, and δ₄ is 13 degrees. Oh wait, phase shifts are part of scattering theory, like in partial wave analysis. Each phase shift corresponds to a different angular momentum state, I think. 

The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by something involving the phase shifts. Oh right! The formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) e^{2iδ_l} sin(2δ_l), summed over all l. But wait, the question is specifically along the incident beam direction, which I think corresponds to θ=0 degrees. So maybe the formula simplifies at θ=0.

Wait another thing, in the case of θ=0, the scattering is along the same direction as the incident beam. For that, the formula might involve just the sum of (2l +1) sin δ_l times something. Let me think. Oh, right! The formula for f(θ) for θ=0 is f(0) = (1/(2ik)) [ -2i Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l ].

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the terms. Let me recall. The general formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l + 1) [ e^{2iδ_l} - 1 ] P_l(cosθ), where P_l are the Legendre polynomials. But at θ=0, P_l(1) is 1 for l=0 and 0 otherwise. So only the l=0 term contributes? Wait no, because P_0 is 1, but higher l terms have P_l(1)=0? Wait, for l=0, P_0=1; l=1, P_1(x)=x, so at x=1, that's 1; wait no, wait, P_1(1) is 1, but higher l terms like P_l(1) is 1 for all l, isn't that right? Wait, no, that's not correct. The Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is always 1 for any l. Because P_l(1) = 1 for all l. So, for θ=0, all terms contribute. Oh, so f(0) would be (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ].

Wait, but the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So I'm interested in Im[f(0)]. Let's calculate that.

So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ].

Let me expand e^{2iδ_l} -1. Using Euler's formula, e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ. So e^{2iδ_l} = cos(2δ_l) + i sin(2δ_l). Subtract 1: [cos(2δ_l) -1 ] + i sin(2δ_l).

So [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] = 2i sin(δ_l) e^{iδ_l} }? Wait, wait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ].

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the imaginary part of f(0).

Let me write f(0) as (1/(2ik)) times the sum. Let's compute the sum first.

Sum = Σ (2l +1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ]

Each term in the sum is (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1) = (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ_l) -1) + i sin(2δ_l) ]

So the sum has real and imaginary parts. Since f(0) is multiplied by 1/(2ik), which is -i/(2k), because 1/(ik) = -i/k.

So f(0) = [1/(2ik)] * Sum = [1/(2ik)] [ Sum_real + i Sum_imaginary ]

Let me compute it step by step. The sum can be written as (A + i B), where A is the real part and B is the imaginary part.

So,

f(0) = (A + iB) / (2ik) = [A/(2ik)] + [iB/(2ik)] = [A/(2ik)] + [B/(2k)]

But 1/k = 1/(2πħ c), but maybe I don't need the units yet.

Wait, but I'm supposed to find the imaginary part of f(0). Let's compute Im[f(0)].

So f(0) = [A/(2ik)] + [B/(2k)]

Expressed as:

A/(2ik) = A/(2i k) = [A/(2k)] * (1/i) = [A/(2k)] (-i)

So f(0) = [ -i A/(2k) ) ] + [ B/(2k) ]

Which is (B/(2k)) - i (A/(2k)).

So the imaginary part is -A/(2k). 

Alternatively, I can write Im(f(0)) = -A/(2k), where A is the real part of the sum.

But A is the sum of the real parts of each (2l+1)(e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) term. 

Wait, but maybe I should calculate the sum differently. Let me think again.

Each term in the sum is (2l+1)( e^{2iδ_l} -1 )

= (2l+1) [ cos(2δ_l) -1 + i sin(2δ_l) ]

So the real part is (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) -1 ), and the imaginary part is (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

So the sum over l of [real parts] is Σ (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) -1 ), and the sum of [imaginary parts] is Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l).

So f(0) = [Sum_real + i Sum_imag ] / (2ik)

= [Sum_real + i Sum_imag ] / (2ik )

Which can be written as [Sum_real/(2ik)] + [i Sum_imag/(2ik) ]

Simplify each term:

Sum_real/(2ik) = (Sum_real) * (1/(2ik)) = (Sum_real) * (-i)/(2k)

Similarly, i Sum_imag/(2ik) = Sum_imag/(2k)

So f(0) = [ Sum_imag/(2k) ) ] - i (Sum_real)/(2k )

So the imaginary part of f(0) is [ - Sum_real/(2k) ]

So Im(f(0)) = - Sum_real / (2k )

Wait, but let's make sure. The imaginary part of f(0) is the coefficient of i in the expression.

So f(0) is (Sum_real + i Sum_imag)/(2ik) = [ Sum_real/(2ik) ) + (i Sum_imag)/(2ik) ]

Simplify each term:

Sum_real/(2ik) = Sum_real/(2i k) = (Sum_real / k ) * (1/(2i)) 

Which is (Sum_real / k )*( -i/2 )

Because 1/(2i) = -i/(2)

Similarly, (i Sum_imag)/(2ik ) = (i Sum_imag)/(2ik ) = Sum_imag/(2k )

So f(0) = [ Sum_imag/(2k) ) ] - i ( Sum_real )/(2k )

Therefore, the imaginary part of f(0) is Im(f(0)) = - Sum_real/(2k )

So, yes, Im(f(0)) = - Sum_real/(2k )

But I'm probably making a mistake somewhere, but let's proceed.

So Sum_real is Σ (2l +1) [ cos(2 δ_l ) -1 ]

Wait, wait. Because each term is (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) -1 ), so that's the real part.

But wait, all the phase shifts given are for specific l values. Let's see, the phase shifts given are δ₀, δ₁, δ₂, δ₃, δ₄. So l=0,1,2,3,4.

So our sum will be over l=0 to l=4.

So Sum_real = Σ_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) [ cos(2δ_l) -1 ]

Let me compute each term.

Let me compute each (2l+1) [ cos(2δ_l) -1 ] term.

For l=0: δ₀ =90 degrees, which is π/2 radians.

cos(2*90 degrees) = cos(180 degrees) = -1.

So [cos(2δ_0) -1 ] = (-1) -1 = -2.

Multiply by (2l+1) =1. So term is 1 * (-2 )= -2.

For l=1: δ₁=67 degrees. 2δ₁=134 degrees. cos(134 degrees) is approximately cos(180−46) = -cos(46 degrees). Cos(46) ≈ 0.6947. So cos(134)≈ -0.6947.

So [cos(2δ₁) -1 ] ≈ (-0.6947) -1 ≈ -1.6947.

Multiply by (2*1 +1)=3. So 3*(-1.6947)≈ -5.0841.

For l=2: δ₂=55 degrees. 2δ₂=110 degrees. Cos(110) is cos(90+20) = -sin(20) ≈-0.3420.

So [cos(2δ₂) -1 ]≈ (-0.3420) -1= -1.3420.

Multiply by (2*2+1)=5: 5*(-1.3420)= -6.71.

l=3: δ₃=30 degrees. 2δ=60 degrees. Cos(60)=0.5.

[0.5 -1 ]= -0.5. Multiply by (2*3+1)=7: 7*(-0.5)=-3.5.

l=4: δ₄=13 degrees. 2δ=26 degrees. Cos(26)≈0.8988.

[0.8988 -1 ]= -0.1012. Multiply by (2*4 +1)=9: 9*(-0.1012)= -0.9108.

Now sum all these terms:

l=0: -2
l=1: -5.0841 → total so far: -7.0841
l=2: -6.71 → total: -13.7941
l=3: -3.5 → total: -17.2941
l=4: -0.9108 → total: -18.2049

So Sum_real ≈ -18.2049.

Hmm, but wait, I'm not sure about the precision here. Maybe I should compute more accurately.

Wait, for l=1: 2δ₁=134 degrees. Let me compute cos(134 degrees) more accurately.

134 degrees is in the second quadrant. Cos(134) = -cos(46). Cos(46) is approximately 0.69465837. So cos(134)= -0.69465837.

So [cos(2δ₁) -1 ] = (-0.69465837) -1 = -1.69465837. Multiply by 3: 3*(-1.69465837 )= -5.0839751.

For l=2: 2δ=110 degrees. Cos(110) = cos(90+20)= -sin(20). Sin(20)=0.3420201433. So cos(110)= -0.3420201433.

So [cos(2δ₂) -1 ]= (-0.3420201433) -1 = -1.3420201433. Multiply by 5: 5*(-1.3420201433 )= -6.7101007165.

For l=3: 2δ=60 degrees. cos(60)= 0.5. So [0.5 -1 ]= -0.5. Multiply by 7: 7*(-0.5)= -3.5.

For l=4: 2δ=26 degrees. Cos(26)= approximately 0.8987940463. So [0.8987940463 -1 ]= -0.1012059537. Multiply by 9: 9*(-0.1012059537 )= -0.9108535833.

Adding all these:

l=0: -2

l=1: -5.0839751 → sum -7.0839751

l=2: -6.7101007165 → sum -13.79407582

l=3: -3.5 → sum -17.29407582

l=4: -0.9108535833 → sum -18.2049294033.

So Sum_real ≈ -18.2049.

So Im(f(0)) = - Sum_real / (2k )

Wait, but what is k here? k is the wave number. Wait, the electrons have 50 MeV energy. So I need to find k in terms of the given energy.

Electron mass is about 0.511 MeV/c², so 50 MeV is much higher, so relativistic effects are important. But maybe the formula for k uses the non-relativistic expression? Or perhaps it's given in terms of the wavelength.

Wait, the wave number k is given by k = sqrt( (2mE) ) / ħ, but wait, that's for the non-relativistic case. But for high energies, we might need to use relativistic expressions.

Alternatively, maybe the problem provides a way to compute k. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the relation k = (E/(ħ²))^(1/2) * something. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the momentum p, where k = p/ħ.

Wait, for an electron of energy E, the momentum p is given by E² = (pc)² + (m c²)². So p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

But given that E is 50 MeV and m c² is 0.511 MeV, E is much larger, so E ≈ pc. So p ≈ E / c.

But let me compute it more accurately.

E =50 MeV.

m c² = 0.511 MeV.

So p = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) / c ≈ (50 ) / c.

But for high E, the sqrt(E² - m² c^4 ) ≈ E - (m² c^4 )/(2 E )

So p ≈ E/c * [1 - (m² c^4)/(2 E²) ) ]

But since E is 50 MeV, much larger than m c², so p ≈ E/c.

But perhaps the formula for k uses E/(ħ c) ?

Wait, let me think in terms of units. The scattering amplitude f has units of length (in fm, for example). So when I compute Im(f(0)), I need to ensure that the units come out right.

The formula for Im(f(0)) is Im(f) = [ Sum_real ]/(2 k ) ?

Wait, no, earlier I thought Im(f(0)) = - Sum_real/(2k ). But wait, let me recheck.

Wait, in the earlier steps, I have Im(f(0)) = - Sum_real/(2k )

Sum_real is a dimensionless quantity because each term is (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) -1 ), which is dimensionless.

So k must have units of 1/length, so 1/k has units of length.

So the imaginary part of f(0) is Sum_real/(2k ), which would have units of length, which makes sense.

So I need to compute k.

k is the wave number, which is given by k = p/(ħ), where p is the momentum.

But p = gamma m v, but perhaps using E = sqrt( (pc )^2 + (m c^2 )^2 )

So solving for p: p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 ) / c

Hmm, but energy is given in MeV, and I need to express k in units that would give f in fm.

Wait, Planck's constant ħ is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm (since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, I think). So perhaps I can express k in terms of E.

Wait, let me compute k in terms of E.

p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 ) / c

But E =50 MeV, m c²=0.511 MeV.

So p ≈ E/c, because E >> m c².

p ≈ 50 MeV / c

But ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, so p = 50 / c (MeV) ) = (50 / 197.33 MeV·fm/c ) ) * (ħ c) ) ?

Wait, perhaps using p = (E ) / (ħ c )

Because p = E/(ħ c ) * ħ c² /c ?

Wait, not sure. Let me think about units.

E has units MeV.

ħ has units MeV·fm / (c), because ħ c is about 197 MeV·fm.

Wait, ħ has units J·s, but in terms of energy and length, J = MeV, s = fm (since c=3e8 m/s, 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so s = (fm c)/c ), but perhaps getting confused.

Alternatively, let's compute k.

k = p / ħ.

p is in units of MeV/c.

So p = (E )/(c) when E >> m c².

So p = E/(c) = (50 MeV )/(c )

But ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So 1/(c ) = ħ / ( ħ c )

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Alternatively, perhaps k can be written as:

k = (E )/( ħ c )

Because p = E/c, so k = p/ħ = (E/(c )) / ħ = E/( ħ c )

So k = E/( ħ c )

Given that ħ c ≈ 197 MeV·fm, so for E=50 MeV,

k = 50 / (197.33 ) ≈ 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

Wait, so k ≈ 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

But wait, wait. Let me compute more accurately.

ħ c = 197.327 MeV·fm.

So for E=50 MeV,

k = (50 MeV ) / (197.327 MeV·fm ) ) = 50 / 197.327 ≈ 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈ 0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So Sum_real is approximately -18.2049, and 2k is about 0.5066 fm^{-1}.

Wait, no. 2k is 2*0.2533 ≈ 0.5066 fm^{-1}.

So the imaginary part of f(0) is Im(f(0)) = - Sum_real/(2k )

So Sum_real is -18.2049.

So:

Im(f(0)) = - ( -18.2049 ) / ( 2 * 0.2533 )

= 18.2049 / (0.5066 )

Compute that: 18.2049 / 0.5066 ≈ ?

Let's compute 18.2049 ÷ 0.5066.

0.5066 × 36 = about 18.2376, which is just a bit higher than 18.2049.

So 36 × 0.5066 is 18.2376.

So 18.2049 is a bit less than 36 × 0.5066. Let's get more precise.

Compute 0.5066 * 35.9 = ?

0.5066 * 35 = 17.731

0.5066 * 0.9 = 0.45594 → total 17.731 + 0.45594 = 18.18694.

Difference from 18.2049: 18.2049 -18.18694 = 0.01796.

How much more than 35.9? Each 0.1 gives 0.05066. So 0.01796 / 0.05066 ≈ 0.3545. So 35.9 + 0.3545 = 36.2545? Wait, no, wait. Hmm, let me think better.

Wait, 0.5066 × x = 18.2049.

x = 18.2049 / 0.5066 ≈ 

Let me compute 18.2049 ÷ 0.5066.

0.5066 * 36 = 18.2376 (as before). The actual value is 18.2049, which is 18.2376 - 0.0327 less.

So, the value is 36 - (0.0327 / 0.5066 ) ≈ 36 - 0.0645 ≈ 35.9355.

So approximately 35.9355.

Wait, but let's compute 18.2049 / 0.5066 accurately.

Let me compute 18.2049 ÷ 0.5066.

Let me set it up as 182049 ÷ 5066 → because 18.2049 is 182049 × 1e-4, and 0.5066 is 5066 × 1e-4.

So 182049 ÷ 5066.

Compute 5066 × 35 = 5066 *30=151,980; 5066*5=25,330 → total 177,310.

5066 *36 = 177,310 +5066 =182,376.

But 182,049 is less than that.

182,049 - 177,310 = 4,739.

So 35 + (4739 /5066 ) → 35 + approx 0.9354 → 35.9354.

So 35.9354 ≈35.935.

So Im(f(0)) ≈35.935.

But wait, the options given are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Wait, my calculation gives around 35.9 fm, which isn't among the options. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, what's the problem? Did I make a mistake somewhere in the steps? Let me check.

First, the approach: I used the formula for Im(f(0)) = - Sum_real/(2k )

Sum_real ≈-18.2049, k≈0.2533 fm^{-1}, so 2k ≈0.5066 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f(0)) = 18.2049 / 0.5066 ≈35.9 fm.

But the options are all around 177 fm or so. Hmm, that's a big discrepancy.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for Im(f(0)).

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0)) = Sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) / (2k )

Wait, where did I go wrong earlier? Let me re-express the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the formula for the scattering amplitude in terms of the phase shifts.

The general expression is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} (sin δ_l)^2 [ 1 - cosθ ] / [ 1 + ... ] ?

Wait, perhaps I should go back to the correct formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the fact that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is given by Im(f(θ))= (1/(2k )) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l [ 1 - cosθ ].

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, let me refer to the partial wave expansion.

The scattering amplitude f(θ) is given by:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) Σ_{l=0}^∞ (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} P_l(cosθ )

The imaginary part of f(θ) is Im(f(θ)) = (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) P_l(cosθ )

Wait, but for θ=0, P_l(1)=1 for all l, so:

Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l )

Wait, this is different from what I had before. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach.

So if this is the case, then Im(f(0)) = [1/(2k)] Σ (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l )

So for each l, compute (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l )

Let me compute each term again with this correct formula.

So for l=0: δ_0=90 degrees. 2δ_0=180 degrees. sin(180)=0. So term is (1)*0=0.

l=1: δ=67 degrees. 2δ=134 degrees. sin(134)=sin(180-46)= sin(46)≈0.7193.

Multiply by (2*1+1)=3 → 3*0.7193 ≈2.1579.

l=2: δ=55 degrees. 2δ=110 degrees. sin(110)=sin(70)≈0.9397.

Multiply by 5 →5*0.9397≈4.6985.

l=3: δ=30 degrees. 2δ=60. sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660.

Multiply by7 →7 *0.8660≈6.062.

l=4: δ=13 degrees. 2δ=26. sin(26)≈0.4384.

Multiply by9 →9*0.4384≈3.9456.

Now sum these terms:

l=0: 0

l=1: ~2.1579 → total 2.1579

l=2: ~4.6985 → total 6.8564

l=3: ~6.062 → total 12.9184

l=4: ~3.9456 → total ~16.864.

So Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ≈16.864.

So Im(f(0)) = [1/(2k)] * 16.864.

Now, k is E/(ħ c ), E=50 MeV.

We have ħ c≈197.33 MeV fm.

So k=50 / 197.33 ≈0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So 2k≈0.5066 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f(0)) = 16.864 / (2 * 0.2533 )

Wait, no. Wait, Im(f(0))= [ Σ ... ]/(2k )

Which is 16.864 / (2 * 0.2533 )

So 2*0.2533=0.5066.

16.864 / 0.5066 ≈ ?

Compute 16.864 ÷ 0.5066.

0.5066 *33= 16.7178 → 33 *0.5066=16.7178.

16.864 -16.7178=0.1462.

0.1462 /0.5066 ≈0.2886.

So 33 +0.2886≈33.2886.

So Im(f(0))≈33.2886 fm.

Wait, but the options are way higher (like 177 fm). Hmm, this suggests that either my approach is wrong or I'm missing a factor.

Wait, perhaps I forgot a factor of 2 somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, the formula for Im(f) is (1/(2k)) Σ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

Wait, but perhaps the correct formula is (1/(2ik)) Σ ... which when you take the imaginary part, gives a different factor.

Wait, another approach: let me refer to the partial wave expansion. The general expression for f(θ) is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^infty (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l(cosθ )

But I'm interested in Im(f(0)).

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1 for all l.

So f(0) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ]

= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ cos(2δ_l) -1 + i sin(2δ_l) ]

= (1/(2ik)) [ sum (2l+1)(cos(2δ_l) -1 ) + i sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ]

So, f(0) = [ sum_real + i sum_imag ] / (2ik )

The imaginary part of f(0) is the imaginary component of this expression.

So f(0) = [ sum_real/(2ik) ) + sum_imag/(2k) ) ]

Because i/(2ik) = 1/(2k ).

Thus, the imaginary part is sum_imag/(2k )

Wait, earlier I thought it was -sum_real/(2k ), but perhaps I made a mistake there. Let me re-express.

The expression is [ sum_real + i sum_imag ] / (2ik )

= sum_real/(2ik) + i sum_imag/(2ik )

= sum_real/(2ik) + sum_imag/(2k )

So, f(0) = [ sum_real/(2ik) ) ] + [ sum_imag/(2k ) ]

The imaginary part is the coefficient of i, which is [ sum_imag/(2k ) ]

Wait, but in this case, the imaginary part is sum_imag/(2k )

Because the first term is sum_real/(2ik ), which is real times 1/(2ik ). So,

sum_real/(2ik ) = sum_real/(2i k ) → which is a purely imaginary term with coefficient sum_real/(2k ) * ( -i )

So the imaginary part of f(0) is [ sum_imag/(2k ) ] + [ sum_real/(2k ) ] * (-1 )

Wait, that complicates things. So perhaps I should compute Im(f(0)) as:

Im(f(0)) = ( sum_imag )/(2k ) + ( sum_real )/(2k ) * (-1 )

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me compute it properly.

Let me express f(0) as A + i B, where A is the real part and B is the imaginary part.

f(0) = ( sum_real + i sum_imag ) / (2ik )

Express denominator: 2ik = 2i k

So,

f(0) = [ sum_real + i sum_imag ] / ( 2i k )

Multiply numerator and denominator by -i:

= [ (sum_real + i sum_imag ) (-i) ] / ( 2 i k (-i) )

Denominator: 2i k (-i)= 2i*(-i) k = 2 (1) k = 2k.

Numerator: 

- i sum_real + sum_imag.

So,

f(0) = [ (-i sum_real + sum_imag ) ] / ( 2k )

Which can be written as:

f(0) = [ sum_imag / (2k) ) ] + [ (-i sum_real ) / (2k) ]

So the imaginary part is the coefficient of i, which is (- sum_real )/(2k )

Wait, because the term is ( -i sum_real ) / (2k ), which is i multiplied by ( - sum_real )/(2k )

So the imaginary part of f(0) is Im(f(0)) = ( sum_imag )/(2k ) ?

No, wait. Wait, f(0) is sum_imag/(2k ) - i ( sum_real )/(2k )

So, the imaginary part is [ - sum_real ]/(2k )

Wait, no. The imaginary part is the coefficient of i. So f(0) is (sum_imag/(2k )) + ( - sum_real/(2k ) ) * i.

So the imaginary part is (- sum_real )/(2k )

Wait, so that would give Im(f(0)) = - sum_real/(2k )

But earlier, in the alternative approach, I got Im(f(0)) = sum_imag/(2k )

Which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct formula.

I remember that the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

But I'm getting conflicting results from two different approaches. Let me think about a reference.

Wait, from scattering theory, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is given by Im f(0) = (1/(2k)) sum (2l +1) sin(2δ_l )

Because, as per the partial wave expansion, f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l} P_l (cosθ )

So when θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0)= (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) e^{2iδ_l }

Taking the imaginary part:

Im f(0) = (1/(2k )) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

Which aligns with the previous calculation of 16.864/(2k )

Wait, but earlier I thought another formula where Im f(0) is - sum_real/(2k )

But according to the reference approach, it's (1/(2k )) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

So perhaps my initial approach was incorrect, and the correct formula is the latter.

So, with the correct formula, Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ) ] / (2k )

So I should compute sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

As I did earlier, which was 16.864.

Then, Im(f(0)) =16.864 / (2 * 0.2533 )

Which is 16.864 / 0.5066 ≈33.28 fm.

Hmm, but the options are much larger. Did I make a mistake in calculating k?

Wait, let's re-examine the calculation of k.

k= p/ħ, where p= sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

E=50 MeV, m c²=0.511 MeV.

So p= sqrt(50² -0.511² ) / c ≈50 / c.

But ħ c= 197.33 MeV fm.

Thus, p=50 MeV / c.

So k=p / ħ = [50 MeV / c ] / ħ = (50 ) / ( ħ c ) ) MeV fm.

Because ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So k=50 /197.33 ≈0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So that part is correct.

Hmm, but the options are in the hundreds of fm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula for Im(f) is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / (2k )

Wait, but that would give a smaller sum.

Wait, let's see:

sum (2l+1) sin δ_l for l=0 to4.

l=0: 1 * sin(90)=1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67) ≈3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)≈5 *0.8192=4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7*0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)≈9 *0.2249=2.0241.

Sum: 1 +2.7615=3.7615; +4.096=7.8575; +3.5=11.3575; +2.0241≈13.3816.

So sum≈13.38.

Im(f(0))= 13.38/(2k )

k=0.2533 → 2k=0.5066.

13.38/0.5066≈26.42 fm.

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses sum (2l+1) sin δ_l * (1/(k)) without the 2 in denominator.

Wait, let me think about the correct formula.

The correct formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at θ=0 is Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k )) sum (2l +1) sin(2 δ_l )

Which gives around 33 fm, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the formula Im(f(0)) = sum (2l +1) sin δ_l / (k )

Then, sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ≈13.38, k=0.2533 → 13.38 /0.2533 ≈52.8 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units of k.

Wait, k is in fm^{-1}, so 1/k is in fm.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong expression for k.

Wait, the momentum p is given by E = sqrt( p^2 c^4 + m^2 c^4 ) → p c = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 ) where E and m are in units where c=1 (e.g., MeV).

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the units. Let me try a different approach.

The Compton wavelength is ħ/(m c ), but perhaps that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, let me compute the wavelength λ.

The de Broglie wavelength λ = h / p.

But in terms of k, k = 2π / λ.

So λ = 2π / k.

But for relativistic particles, E=pc.

So p= E/c.

So λ= h/( E/c )= (h c )/E.

But h=2 π ħ, so λ= (2 π ħ c ) / E.

So k=2π / λ= (2 π E )/( ħ c )

So k= (2 π E )/( ħ c )

With E=50 MeV, ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So k= (2 π *50 )/ (197.33 )

Compute numerator: 2 *3.1416 *50≈314.16.

Denominator:197.33.

k≈314.16 / 197.33 ≈1.589 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that's a different value of k. So earlier I thought k=0.2533, but perhaps that's wrong.

Wait, because I think I mixed up the formulas.

Let me clarify.

k = p / ħ.

p = sqrt( E^2 - m^2 c^4 ) / c.

But E=50 MeV, m c²=0.511 MeV.

So E^2 = (50)^2 =2500 (MeV)^2.

(m c²)^2= (0.511)^2≈0.261 (MeV)^2.

So E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 ≈2500 -0.261≈2499.739.

p c= sqrt(2499.739 )≈49.997 MeV.

So p= (49.997 MeV ) / c.

So now, k= p / ħ = (49.997 MeV / c ) / ( ħ )

But ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So 1/ħ c= 1/(197.33 MeV fm ) *c

Wait, perhaps better to express p in terms of ħ c.

p = (49.997 MeV ) / c.

So p= (49.997 )/(197.33 ) * ħ c / c = (49.997 )/(197.33 ) * ħ.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me compute k.

k= p / ħ.

p= (49.997 MeV ) / c.

So,

k= (49.997 MeV )/(c ) * (1/ħ )

= (49.997 MeV )/( c * ħ )

But c * ħ = 197.33 MeV fm.

So,

k= 49.997 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) = (49.997 ) / 197.33 fm^{-1} → ~0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So earlier calculation of k=0.2533 fm^{-1} is correct.

Hmm. So why are the options so much larger?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts. The given phase shifts are δ_0=90, δ_1=67, δ_2=55, δ_3=30, δ_4=13 degrees. So l goes from 0 to4.

Wait, another possibility is that the problem is asking for the imaginary part multiplied by something else, like 2ik.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for Im(f) multiplied by k or something.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin(δ_l ), not multiplied by anything else.

Wait, let me try that.

sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

l=0: 1 * sin(90)=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)≈3 *0.9205≈2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)≈5 *0.8192≈4.096.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)≈9 *0.2249≈2.0241.

Sum: 1 +2.7615=3.7615 +4.096=7.8575 +3.5=11.3575 +2.0241=13.3816.

So sum≈13.3816.

Hmm, if I multiply this by something, maybe I get the right answer.

Wait, the correct formula for Im(f(0)) is [sum (2l+1) sin(2 δ_l ) ]/(2k )

Which was 16.864 / (2 *0.2533 )=16.864/0.5066≈33.28 fm.

But the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, 33 is not close to any of these. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is that the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (2k )

So use sum≈13.38.

Im(f)=13.38/(2*0.2533 )=13.38/(0.5066 )≈26.41 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, maybe the formula is Im(f) = [ sum (2l+1) (1 - cos(2δ_l )) ]/(2k )

Which is the same as sum_real/(2k )

Which earlier was sum_real≈-18.2049.

So Im(f)= - sum_real/(2k ) =18.2049/(2*0.2533 )=18.2049/0.5066≈35.93 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) * 2.

So 2 *13.3816=26.763.

Then 26.763/(2k )=26.763/(0.5066 )≈52.8 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the phase shifts are in radians, not degrees. Did I make a mistake there?

Wait, the given phase shifts are in degrees: δ_0=90°, etc. So I converted correctly.

But in the calculation of sin(2 δ_l ), perhaps I should compute in radians.

Let me recompute the sum using radians.

Compute for each l:

l=0: δ=90°= π/2 →2δ= π radians.

sin(2δ)=sin(π)=0. So term=1 *0=0.

l=1: δ=67° → radians: 67*(pi/180)= approx 1.16937 radians.

2δ= 2.33874 radians.

sin(2.33874 )= sin(2.33874 ) ≈0.7193.

Multiply by3 →3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2: δ=55°=0.95993 radians. 2δ=1.91986 radians.

sin(1.91986 )=approx 0.9397.

Multiply by5 →5 *0.9397=4.6985.

l=3: δ=30°=0.5236 radians. 2δ=1.0472 radians.

sin(1.0472 )=0.8660.

Multiply by7 →7*0.8660=6.062.

l=4: δ=13°=0.22689 radians. 2δ=0.45378 radians.

sin(0.45378 )≈0.4384.

Multiply by9 →9*0.4384=3.9456.

So sum is 0 +2.1579 +4.6985 +6.062 +3.9456=16.864.

So same as before. So I didn't make a mistake in the conversion.

Hmm. Not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the imaginary part multiplied by k, not divided. Let me see.

If Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ) →16.864.

Multiply by k: 16.864 *0.2533≈4.273 fm.

No, not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the real part, but that's less likely.

Wait, perhaps I should use the absolute value of the sum, but that doesn't change anything.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses (2l+1) sin δ_l, not 2 delta.

Earlier, when I used sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, I got sum≈13.38.

Then, Im(f(0))=13.38/(2k )=26.41 fm.

No, still not matching options.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are not given for l=0 to4, but for l=1 to4, and l=0 is ignored. But the problem states to ignore the rest, implying that only the given phase shifts are considered. So l=0 to l=4.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using E in a different unit.

Wait, E=50 MeV. Did I compute k correctly?

Wait, another approach: the wavelength λ is given by λ= 2π/(k).

But earlier, I have k=0.2533 fm^{-1}, so λ=2π/(0.2533 )≈25.29 fm.

Which seems correct for a 50 MeV electron.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the imaginary part multiplied by something else, like 1/k.

Wait, but no, the options are in fm.

Hmm, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (k )

Which would give 13.38 /0.2533≈52.85 fm.

Still not matching. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ]

Which when considering the imaginary part would give Im(f)= [sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ) ]/(2k )

Which is 16.864/(2*0.2533 )=33.28 fm.

But none of the options is close.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is ~177 fm, which is roughly 5.3 times larger than 33.28.

Wait, 33.28 *5=166.4, close to option C (177.675 fm).

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k using E in eV.

Wait, no, because everything is in MeV, and the calculation should be okay.

Another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians, but I treated them as degrees.

Wait, no, the problem states the phase shifts are in degrees, e.g., δ_0=90°, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, not sin(2δ_l )

So let's compute sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which was 13.38 as before.

Im(f)=13.38/(2k )=26.41 fm.

Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l /k.

Which is 13.38 /0.2533≈52.85 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, and then multiply by 2.

Which gives 26.76 / (2k )=26.76 /0.5066≈52.85 fm.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) [1 - cos(2δ_l ) ].

Which is sum_real.

Which was -18.2049.

So Im(f)= - sum_real/(2k )=18.2049/(2 *0.2533 )=35.93 fm.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is actually asking for the imaginary part of the differential cross-section, but no, the question is about the scattering amplitude.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the Born approximation, but the question doesn't specify that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula and the correct Im(f(0)) is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (k ).

Which is 13.38 /0.2533≈52.85 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is using the non-relativistic expression for k.

In non-relativistic, k = sqrt(2mE )/ħ.

E=50 MeV, m_e c²=0.511 MeV.

But units would have to be consistent. Let me compute in natural units where ħ=c=1.

In natural units, E=50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV.

k = sqrt( 2m E ) ) = sqrt(2 *0.511 *50 ) = sqrt(51.1 )≈7.15 MeV.

So k=7.15 MeV.

But in natural units, ħ c=197.33 MeV fm → 1 MeV^{-1} = 197.33 fm.

So k=7.15 MeV → k^{-1}=197.33 /7.15 ≈27.6 fm^{-1}.

So k≈27.6 fm^{-1}.

But earlier relativistic approach gave k≈0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So perhaps in the non-relativistic approach, which for 50 MeV electrons is not appropriate, but perhaps this is the intended approach.

Let me proceed.

Using non-relativistic k=27.6 fm^{-1}.

Now, using the formula Im(f(0))= sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )/(2k )

Sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )=16.864.

Hmm, 16.864/(2*27.6 )=16.864/(55.2 )≈0.3055 fm.

No, that's not matching options.

Alternatively, using sum (2l+1) sin δ_l=13.38.

Then 13.38/(2*27.6 )=13.38/(55.2 )≈0.2423 fm.

Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-relativistic approach isn't correct for 50 MeV electrons.

Wait, this is tricky. I'm not seeing where the mistake is, but perhaps I should look for a pattern in the options.

Looking at the options, option C is 177.675 fm. Which is approximately two times 88.8375.

Hmm, wait, 50 MeV is given. The options involve numbers like 177, which is about 50 *3.54.

Wait, I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess.

Earlier, when I used the formula Im(f(0)) = [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ) ]/(2k ), I obtained ~33.28 fm. But the options are much larger.

Wait, option B is 355.35 fm. Which is about 10 times larger than 35.53.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator. If k was 0.05066 fm^{-1}, then 33.28 / (2*0.05066 )= 33.28/0.1013≈328.6 fm. Close to option B (355.35), but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, if in non-relativistic approach, k= sqrt(2mE ) / ħ.

But 2mE in non-relativistic is in units of MeV^2.

Wait, let me recompute k using non-relativistic approach.

In non-relativistic, E = p²/(2m ), so p= sqrt(2m E )

But in units where ħ= c=1,

E in MeV, m in MeV/c².

So p = sqrt( 2 * 0.511 MeV *50 MeV ) = sqrt(51.1 )≈7.15 MeV.

Then, k= p / ħ c → p in MeV/c, ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So,

k= (7.15 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm ) = 7.15 /197.33 fm^{-1} ≈0.0362 fm^{-1}.

So 2k=0.0724 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f)=16.864 /0.0724≈232.9 fm.

Close to option B (355.35) but not quite.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given for l=0 to4, but only the l=0 term contributes because higher terms are zero.

Wait, but l=0 phase shift is 90°, so e^{2iδ_0}= e^{i π}= -1.

So (2l+1)(e^{2iδ}-1 )=1*(-2)= -2.

So f(0)= (1/(2ik ))*(-2 )= (-1)/(ik )

Im(f(0))= Im( (-1)/(ik ) )

But 1/(ik )= -i/(k ), so (-1)/(ik )= i/(k ), whose imaginary part is 1/(k )

So Im(f(0))=1/k.

k=0.2533 fm^{-1}.

So Im(f(0))=1/0.2533 ≈3.946 fm.

But that's not matching any options.

Hmm, this is getting me nowhere. Perhaps I should conclude that the correct answer is option C, 177.675 fm, but I can't see how.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem is using a different formula where Im(f)= (sum (2l+1) ) / (k )

Sum (2l+1) from l=0 to4 is 1+3+5+7+9=25.

So 25 /k=25/0.2533 ≈98.68 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the sum is sum (2l+1) [1 - cos(2δ_l ) ]

Which is sum_real= -18.2049.

So Im(f)= - sum_real/(2k ) =18.2049/(2*0.2533 )=35.93 fm.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is not listed. But the options suggest that the correct approach leads to an answer around 177 fm.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the formula is Im(f)= sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / (k )

Sum=13.38, k=0.2533.

13.38 /0.2533≈52.85 fm.

Still not matching.

Another thought: perhaps I should multiply by 2π in some step.

Wait, if I have Im(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ) ]/( 2k )

Which is 16.864/(2 *0.2533 )=33.28 fm.

But to get to 177 fm, perhaps I should multiply by 5.33, which is 16/3.

Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, let me recompute the sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

l=0: 1 * sin(180)=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134)=3 * sin(134 degrees )=3 *0.7193=2.1579.

l=2:5 * sin(110)=5*0.9397=4.6985.

l=3:7 * sin(60)=7 *0.8660=6.062.

l=4:9 * sin(26)=9 *0.4384=3.9456.

Sum: 0 +2.1579+4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

Yes, that's correct.

So, I think I've exhausted all possibilities and can't find a way to match the options. Perhaps the correct answer is option C, 177.675 fm, but I'm not sure how to reach it.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f(0))= [ sum (2l+1) sin(δ_l ) ] × [ 1/(k ) ]

Which gives 13.38 /0.2533 ≈52.85 fm.

But option C is 177.675 fm, which is 3.36 times larger. Hmm, 52.85 *3.36≈177.6.

Ah! Wait, perhaps I forgot to multiply by 2. So 52.85 *3.36=177.6.

But why multiply by 3.36?

Wait, I think I'm stuck. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess.


The problem involves calculating the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude, \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \), for elastic scattering of \( 50~\text{MeV} \) electrons from a nuclear target. The phase shifts provided are \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), and the task is to compute \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \) along the incident beam direction (\( \theta = 0^\circ \)).

### Key Formula
The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude at \( \theta = 0^\circ \) is given by:
\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{1}{2k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l),
\]
where \( k \) is the wave number, calculated as \( k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} \), with \( E = 50~\text{MeV} \) and \( \hbar c \approx 197.33~\text{MeV·fm} \).

### Calculation of \( k \)
\[
k = \frac{E}{\hbar c} = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.2533~\text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

### Sum of \( (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \)
For each \( l \), compute \( (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \):
- \( l = 0 \): \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_0) = \sin(180^\circ) = 0 \), term = \( 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \).
- \( l = 1 \): \( \delta_1 = 67^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_1) = \sin(134^\circ) \approx 0.7193 \), term = \( 3 \cdot 0.7193 \approx 2.1579 \).
- \( l = 2 \): \( \delta_2 = 55^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_2) = \sin(110^\circ) \approx 0.9397 \), term = \( 5 \cdot 0.9397 \approx 4.6985 \).
- \( l = 3 \): \( \delta_3 = 30^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_3) = \sin(60^\circ) \approx 0.8660 \), term = \( 7 \cdot 0.8660 \approx 6.062 \).
- \( l = 4 \): \( \delta_4 = 13^\circ \), \( \sin(2\delta_4) = \sin(26^\circ) \approx 0.4384 \), term = \( 9 \cdot 0.4384 \approx 3.9456 \).

Summing these terms:
\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l+1) \sin(2\delta_l) \approx 0 + 2.1579 + 4.6985 + 6.062 + 3.9456 \approx 16.864.
\]

### Final Calculation of \( \text{Im}(f(0)) \)
Substitute into the formula:
\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \frac{16.864}{2k} = \frac{16.864}{2 \cdot 0.2533} \approx \frac{16.864}{0.5066} \approx 33.28~\text{fm}.
\]

### Discrepancy with Options
The calculated value (\( \approx 33.28~\text{fm} \)) does not match any of the provided options. However, option \( C \) (\( 177.675~\text{fm} \)) is approximately \( 5.33 \) times larger than the computed result. This suggests a possible missing factor in the calculation, such as an error in interpreting the formula or the given phase shifts. Based on the options, the most reasonable choice is:
