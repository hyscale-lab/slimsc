Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation. I remember that this equation describes the dark current in a semiconductor device when it's in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. Hmm, what's SCLC again? Oh right, it's when the current is limited by the space charge, meaning the charge accumulation is so much that it affects the electric field.

The equation given is J = (9/8) ε μ V² / L³. I think ε is the dielectric constant, μ is the carrier mobility, and L is the length of the device. So the question is about the conditions under which this equation is valid.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Wait, trap-free makes sense because traps would complicate things, maybe leading to more complex current behavior. Single-carrier means it's either electrons or holes, not both. Ohmic contact implies that the contacts don't have any barrier, so carriers can move easily. And negligible drift current—wait, but isn't the equation about the current due to drift? Or maybe it's about which current is dominant. Hmm, I'm a bit confused on that part.

Option B: trap-free, single-carrier, no carrier injection barrier, negligible diffusion current. Oh, no injection barrier would mean that there's no barrier for carriers to enter the device. And negligible diffusion current—so the current is primarily due to drift. Wait, in SCLC, I think the current is due to both drift and field emission, but maybe it's under conditions where diffusion isn't significant. Or perhaps if the current is space-charge limited, diffusion isn't the dominant factor. I'm not sure.

Option C: single-carrier, Schottky contact, negligible diffusion. Schottky contact implies a barrier, so that might affect the current. Wait, Mott-Gurney equation is for when the current is limited by the space charge, which might require certain contact conditions. Not sure about Schottky though.

Option D: two-carrier device, Ohmic contact, negligible diffusion. But Mott-Gurney equation... I've always heard it in the context of single-carrier devices. Two-carrier devices (like p-n junctions) probably follow a different model, like the Shockley equation. So D might not be correct.

So the main choices are between A, B, C, and D. Since I think D is about two carriers, which Mott-Gurney isn't, D is probably wrong.

Now, between A, B, and C.

The Mott-Gurney equation is applicable when the current is due to the space charge, which means the electric field is altered by the charge. This happens in cases where the contacts allow for easy injection—like Ohmic contacts, because that allows for easy movement of carriers. But wait, if it's a Schottky contact (option C), which has a barrier, would that affect the current? Because in a Schottky contact, the carriers have to overcome a barrier to enter, which might mean the current is limited by that barrier, not the space charge. So maybe Mott-Gurney is for when the injection is Ohmic, allowing for easier carrier movement, making the space charge the limiting factor.

So option C's Schottky contact might not be the right condition. So likely, the correct option is either A or B.

Now, the Mott-Gurney equation assumes that the dominant current is due to the space charge, which implies that the electric field is modified by the charge. So the model assumes that the carriers are emitted from the contacts and then accelerated into the bulk. For this, the contacts should not have any significant barrier, so Ohmic contact makes sense.

Now, about the drift vs diffusion. In SCLC, the current is primarily due to the electric field causing drift, since the space charge builds up and creates a strong field. So if the equation is valid when the current is dominated by drift (so diffusion is negligible), that would make sense.

Looking at A: it says negligible drift current, which doesn't make sense because Mott-Gurney is about when drift is the main factor. So option A probably is incorrect because it says negligible drift current—wait, but wait, the option says 'negligible drift current', which would imply that drift isn't important. No, that's confusing. Because if the current is due to drift, then drift can't be negligible. Hmm, perhaps I misread.

Wait, the option says:

A) "... with negligible drift current." That would mean that drift isn't the main factor. But Mott-Gurney is about drift current being dominant, so A can't be right. Oh wait, no, no, maybe I got it wrong.

Wait, in the Mott-Gurney scenario, the current is due to the space charge, which affects the electric field. The current is then primarily due to the drift of carriers accelerated by this field. So the presence of drift is significant. So if an option says 'negligible drift current', that would contradict.

So looking again at options:

Option B: negligible diffusion current. That makes sense because if the space charge is the dominant effect, then the movement is due to drift (electric field), not diffusion (concentration gradients). So in SCLC, the current is space-charge limited, so the dominant term is the drift, and diffusion is not the main factor. So option B's condition about negligible diffusion current would be correct.

Wait, but what's the difference between drift and diffusion current? Drift is due to the electric field, and diffusion is due to concentration gradients. In SCLC, the electric field is strong due to the space charge, so drift is dominant.

So in the Mott-Gurney equation, which applies to SCLC, the current is primarily drift. So if an option says 'negligible diffusion', that makes sense because the dominant effect is drift.

Looking at option B: "negligible diffusion current". So that's correct because in SCLC, the current is dominated by drift, so diffusion is negligible. So B would be a correct condition.

Option A says 'negligible drift current', which would mean that drift isn't significant. That can't be right because Mott-Gurney is about drift being the main thing. So A is wrong.

So, putting it together, the correct statement is option B.

Wait, but let me check:

Option B: trap-free, single-carrier, no injection barrier, negligible diffusion current. So yes, if there's no injection barrier, it's easier for carriers to enter, which fits with the SCLC model. And negligible diffusion so drift is dominant. So yes, B seems correct.

The Mott-Gurney equation describes the dark current (J) versus voltage (V) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. This regime occurs when the current is dominated by the space charge, which modifies the electric field in the device. The equation is given as:

\[
J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3}
\]

where \( \epsilon \) is the dielectric constant, \( \mu \) is the carrier mobility, and \( L \) is the device length. The validity of this equation depends on specific conditions.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: This option states that the equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. However, the Mott-Gurney equation applies to cases where drift current is dominant, not negligible. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: This option specifies a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. In the SCLC regime, the current is primarily due to drift, as the space charge modifies the electric field. Diffusion current becomes negligible under these conditions, making this option correct.

- **Option C**: This option involves a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. A Schottky contact introduces a barrier for carrier injection, which complicates the current behavior and is inconsistent with the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option D**: This option refers to a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. The Mott-Gurney equation is primarily applicable to single-carrier devices, as two-carrier devices typically follow different models (e.g., the Shockley equation). Therefore, this option is also incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current, as described in **Option B**.
