Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll do my best.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The given Hamiltonian is H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, n is an arbitrary unit vector, and ε is an energy constant.

Hmm, right. The Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, and σ_z. So σ · n would be the sum of n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

Wait, eigenvalues of such a Hamiltonian. I remember that for a spin-½ particle, the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues related to their components. Oh wait, the eigenvalues of σ · n are the eigenvalues of each component scaled by their respective n's, but since n is a unit vector, maybe there's a simpler way.

I think that any Pauli matrix, when multiplied by a unit vector component and summed, the eigenvalues are ±1. Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, but when you take their linear combination with coefficients that form a unit vector, the eigenvalues should just be ±1 times some factor.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the Hamiltonian is H = ε (σ · n). So the eigenvalue equation is H |ψ> = E |ψ>.

If σ · n has eigenvalues ±1, then multiplying by ε would give E = ± ε.

Wait, but wait another thing. Are the eigenvalues of σ · n really ±1? Or is there a factor involved? Because σ · n is a Hermitian operator, so its eigenvalues are real.

Each Pauli matrix, like σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, has eigenvalues ±1. If I have a linear combination, such as n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z, then the eigenvalues would be ±sqrt(n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) times something. But since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² =1. So the eigenvalues of σ ·n would be ±1.

Wait, no. Let's think about it more carefully. Suppose I compute the expectation value of σ · n in a state |ψ> which is an eigenstate of σ · n. Then <σ ·n> = ±1. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Because the trace of σ ·n would be zero, because for each component, the trace of σ_i is zero. So the average should be zero. Wait, but the eigenvalues would be ±1? Because the Pauli matrices are traceless, each has eigenvalues +1 and -1, and their sum (when multiplied by n's components) would also have eigenvalues ±1.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because the trace of σ ·n is n_x tr(σ_x) + n_y tr(σ_y) + n_z tr(σ_z) =0, since each tr(σ_i) is zero. So the sum of eigenvalues must be zero. For a 2x2 matrix, if the trace is zero, the sum of the eigenvalues is zero. So the eigenvalues must be +a and -a. Since the trace is zero, a + (-a) =0.

What's the determinant of σ ·n? The Pauli matrices are traceless and have determinant -1. But wait, σ ·n is n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. What's the determinant of this matrix?

The determinant of a 2x2 matrix with eigenvalues a and b is a*b. Since the trace is a + b =0, then b = -a, so determinant is -a².

But wait, each Pauli matrix has determinant -1. So if I have σ ·n, which is a linear combination, what's its determinant? Let me think, perhaps using the fact that if A is a 2x2 matrix, then det(A) = (Tr(A)^2 - Tr(A^2))/(-2). Hmm, maybe not the best approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the square of σ ·n. Let's see: (σ ·n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y +n_z σ_z)^2. Expanding this, each σ_i squared is I (identity matrix), and cross terms are σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i which is 2δ_ij I. So,

(σ ·n)^2 = (n_x^2 σ_x^2 + n_y^2 σ_y^2 + n_z^2 σ_z^2) + 2(n_x n_y (σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x) + n_x n_z (σ_x σ_z + σ_z σ_x) + n_y n_z (σ_y σ_z + σ_z σ_y)) )

Each σ_i^2 is I, so the first part is (n_x^2 +n_y^2 +n_z^2) I = I^2 (since n is unit vector). The cross terms: σ_i σ_j = 2 δ_ij I for the sum, but wait, wait. No, actually, σ_i σ_j = I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σ_k. Wait, no, when you multiply σ_i and σ_j, you get I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σ_k.

But when you have σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i, that's 2 δ_ij I. Because the cross terms involving σ_k (k≠i,j) would cancel out when you add them.

So, (σ ·n)^2 = I + 2 (n_x n_y (σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x) + ... ) 

But since each [σ_i, σ_j] is 2i ε_ijk σ_k, then σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i = 2 δ_ij I. So each cross term is 2 δ_ij.

So, the cross terms contribute 2(n_x n_y δ_xy + n_x n_z δ_xz +n_y n_z δ_yz) ) I. But since δ_xy is 1 when x=y, else 0. So the cross terms become 2(n_x^2 +n_y^2 +n_z^2) I, but wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, n_x n_y δ_xy is n_x^2 when x=y, because δ_xy is 1 when x=y, so for x=y, it's n_x^2 * 2, but wait, no: wait, for each pair (i,j), when i≠j, the term is 2 * n_i n_j * δ_ij which is zero. Only when i=j do we get 2 δ_ij I.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me compute (σ ·n)^2.

(σ ·n)^2 = (n·σ)^2 = n·σ n·σ = n_i σ_i n_j σ_j.

So, this is sum_{i,j} n_i n_j σ_i σ_j.

Now, σ_i σ_j = I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σ_k.

So, sum_{i,j} n_i n_j (I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σ_k ) 

= I sum_{i} n_i^2 + i sum_{i,j,k} n_i n_j ε_ijk σ_k.

But sum_{i} n_i^2 is 1, since n is a unit vector.

The second term: i ε_ijk n_i n_j σ_k. Let me see, the sum over i, j, k of ε_ijk n_i n_j. Wait, but ε_ijk is antisymmetric, and n is a unit vector, so sum_{i,j} n_i n_j ε_ijk =0? Because for each k, the sum is the same as the components of (n × n), which is zero. Because the cross product of a vector with itself is zero.

Wait, that's a good point. So the second term, the sum involving i, j, k, would be zero. Because n ×n =0.

So, (σ ·n)^2 = I * 1 + 0 = I.

So, (σ ·n)^2 = I. Taking square roots, σ ·n would have eigenvalues ±1, because for a matrix M, if M^2 = I, then M has eigenvalues ±1.

Wait, that's a crucial point. So the operator σ ·n has eigenvalues +1 and -1.

Therefore, the Hamiltonian H = ε σ ·n would have eigenvalues ε * (+1) and ε * (-1), so ± ε.

Looking at the options, that's option B: +ε, -ε.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something. Because sometimes Pauli matrices are scaled with factors involving ħ. But in the question, the Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ ·n. The Pauli matrices in their standard form have eigenvalues ±1, so when multiplied by ε, the eigenvalues become ± ε.

So the correct eigenvalues are plus and minus epsilon, which is option B.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is an energy constant. To find the eigenvalues of \( H \), we analyze the operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \).

The operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} = n_x \sigma_x + n_y \sigma_y + n_z \sigma_z \) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices. The eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) can be determined by noting that \( (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. This is because the Pauli matrices satisfy \( \sigma_i^2 = I \) and \( \sigma_i \sigma_j = \delta_{ij} I + i \varepsilon_{ijk} \sigma_k \), and the cross terms vanish due to the unit vector condition \( n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1 \). Thus, \( (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I \), implying that the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \).

Since the Hamiltonian \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) are simply \( \pm \varepsilon \), as the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are scaled by \( \varepsilon \).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: \( +1, -1 \) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \).
- **Option B**: \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \) is correct, as derived above.
- **Option C**: \( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \) is incorrect because the eigenvalues are not scaled by \( \hbar/2 \).
- **Option D**: \( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \) is incorrect because it does not involve \( \varepsilon \).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

What's the determinant of σ ·n? The Pauli matrices are traceless and have determinant -1. But wait, σ ·n is n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. What's the determinant of this matrix?

The determinant of a 2x2 matrix with eigenvalues a and b is a*b. Since the trace is a + b =0, then b = -a, so determinant is -a².

But wait, each Pauli matrix has determinant -1. So if I have σ ·n, which is a linear combination, what's its determinant? Let me think, perhaps using the fact that if A is a 2x2 matrix, then det(A) = (Tr(A)^2 - Tr(A^2))/(-2). Hmm, maybe not the best approach.

(σ ·n)^2 = (n_x^2 σ_x^2 + n_y^2 σ_y^2 + n_z^2 σ_z^2) + 2(n_x n_y (σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x) + n_x n_z (σ_x σ_z + σ_z σ_x) + n_y n_z (σ_y σ_z + σ_z σ_y)) )

Each σ_i^2 is I, so the first part is (n_x^2 +n_y^2 +n_z^2) I = I^2 (since n is unit vector). The cross terms: σ_i σ_j = 2 δ_ij I for the sum, but wait, wait. No, actually, σ_i σ_j = I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σ_k. Wait, no, when you multiply σ_i and σ_j, you get I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σ_k.

But when you have σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i, that's 2 δ_ij I. Because the cross terms involving σ_k (k≠i,j) would cancel out when you add them.

So, (σ ·n)^2 = I + 2 (n_x n_y (σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x) + ... ) 

But since each [σ_i, σ_j] is 2i ε_ijk σ_k, then σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i = 2 δ_ij I. So each cross term is 2 δ_ij.

So, the cross terms contribute 2(n_x n_y δ_xy + n_x n_z δ_xz +n_y n_z δ_yz) ) I. But since δ_xy is 1 when x=y, else 0. So the cross terms become 2(n_x^2 +n_y^2 +n_z^2) I, but wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, n_x n_y δ_xy is n_x^2 when x=y, because δ_xy is 1 when x=y, so for x=y, it's n_x^2 * 2, but wait, no: wait, for each pair (i,j), when i≠j, the term is 2 * n_i n_j * δ_ij which is zero. Only when i=j do we get 2 δ_ij I.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me compute (σ ·n)^2.

(σ ·n)^2 = (n·σ)^2 = n·σ n·σ = n_i σ_i n_j σ_j.

So, this is sum_{i,j} n_i n_j σ_i σ_j.

Now, σ_i σ_j = I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σ_k.

So, sum_{i,j} n_i n_j (I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σ_k ) 

= I sum_{i} n_i^2 + i sum_{i,j,k} n_i n_j ε_ijk σ_k.

But sum_{i} n_i^2 is 1, since n is a unit vector.

The second term: i ε_ijk n_i n_j σ_k. Let me see, the sum over i, j, k of ε_ijk n_i n_j. Wait, but ε_ijk is antisymmetric, and n is a unit vector, so sum_{i,j} n_i n_j ε_ijk =0? Because for each k, the sum is the same as the components of (n × n), which is zero. Because the cross product of a vector with itself is zero.

Wait, that's a good point. So the second term, the sum involving i, j, k, would be zero. Because n ×n =0.

So, (σ ·n)^2 = I * 1 + 0 = I.

So, (σ ·n)^2 = I. Taking square roots, σ ·n would have eigenvalues ±1, because for a matrix M, if M^2 = I, then M has eigenvalues ±1.
