Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are four different esters: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate.

First, I should recall what these compounds look like. Acetates are esters where the acid part is acetic acid, so the structure is something like R-O-CO-O-R. Wait, no, wait: acetate esters are like R-O-CO-O-R, but I might be mixing things up. Oh wait, no, the structure is R-O-CO-CH3, because acetic acid is CH3COOH. So the acetate ester would be something like CH3CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group.

The options given are propenyl and butenyl derivatives. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, and butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but the cis and trans would refer to the double bond configuration.

Wait, no. Wait, let's think: propenyl groups would have a three-carbon chain with a double bond. So propenyl can be either CH2=CHCH2- (which is propenyl, but perhaps more accurately, since propene is CH2=CH2CH3, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-), but the position of the double bond might affect the structure.

Wait, but for the ester, the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-? No, that's for butyl. Wait, the R group is either propenyl or butenyl.

Wait, perhaps the structures are as follows:

Cis-propenyl acetate would be CH3COO-CH2-CH2-CH2-, but that's butyl. Wait, no, wait: propenyl is CH2=CHCH2OAc, but that's not correct. Let me get this right. Acetate ester is OAc-O-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But that would be a three-carbon chain with a double bond. Similarly, butenyl would be four carbons with a double bond.

Wait, but the options are "propenyl" and "butenyl" acetates. So for propenyl, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, that's a propenyl group attached to the oxygen of the acetate.

Wait, but wait: the propenyl group can be either CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond somewhere. No, propenyl has a double bond. So propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as an substituent.

Similarly, butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- or something like that.

Now, the NMR data given is:

1H NMR: 7.0 (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d)

Hmm. So let's break down the peaks.

First, the singlet at 2.1 ppm for 3H. That's probably the methyl group from the acetate, because the acetate's methyl (from acetic acid) is usually around 2 ppm as a singlet. So the 2.1 ppm peak is the OAc's CH3.

Then, 1.6 ppm is a doublet with 3H. That's a methyl group attached to something. Since it's a doublet, perhaps it's adjacent to another group. Maybe a CH2 or CH group.

The peak at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets (dq), so that's 1H. And the peak at 7.0 is a doublet (d) with J=16.0 Hz. That's a large coupling constant, which suggests perhaps a trans coupling in a double bond.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. For an ester with a propenyl group, the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's butyl. No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but that would make it CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, no: the propenyl group is CH2CH2CH2 where one of the CH2 is a double bond. So for propenyl, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, which is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? Wait no, wait: the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond in the propenyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about the structure of these compounds.

The ester is OAc-O-R, where R is either propenyl or butenyl. The propenyl group would be CH2=CHCH2-, and the butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- or CH3CH2CH=CH-.

But wait, for propenyl, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, so the propenyl group in the ester would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond in the propenyl group. So the correct structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but wait: propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the ester would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the first and second carbons. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but that can't be. Because then the double bond would be between C1 and C2 of the propenyl group, making it CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

So the structure would have a double bond between the first and second carbons of the propenyl group, making it CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

In this case, the protons on the double bond would be split in a certain way.

Similarly, butenyl would be four carbons with a double bond, perhaps between C1 and C2, so CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc.

But wait, butenyl could have the double bond in different positions, but the options are butenyl and propenyl, so let's focus on the three and four carbon groups.

Now, the NMR data has a peak at 7.0 ppm, which is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, which suggests that this proton is coupled to another proton across a double bond. So perhaps it's a vinylic proton in a trans configuration, because for trans double bonds, the coupling can be larger.

Wait, for example, in a trans double bond, the coupling between the two vinylic protons is larger than in cis. Or is it the other way around? Wait, I think in trans, the dihedral angle is 180 degrees, leading to maximum coupling, so J is larger. So a J of 16 Hz is likely a trans coupling.

So if there's a doublet at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz), that suggests a proton which is coupled to one other proton with a large J, which could be a trans double bond.

Then the peak at 5.5 ppm is a dq (doublet of quadruplets), 1H. That's a bit more complex, but perhaps this is another vinylic proton.

Wait, but maybe it's not a vinylic proton. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH group adjacent to a double bond. Or maybe it's a methylene group next to the double bond.

Wait, let me think about the structure again.

Assume the structure is CH3CO-O-R, where R is a propenyl or butenyl group with a double bond.

For propenyl, R is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the structure would have two protons on the CH2 next to the double bond.

Wait, but wait: let me draw this. The propenyl group would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the first and second carbons.

Wait, no: the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2- as a substituent. So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-O-CH2-CH2-CH2
But wait, wait, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the structure is:

CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the first and second carbons of the propenyl group. So it's CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with the CH2-CH2 part being a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me consider the possible structures again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the ester is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first and second carbons of the propenyl group.

In such a case, the protons on the double bond would be on C1 and C2.

So the CH2=CHCH2-OAc would have the structure:

CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

So the protons on the CH2=CH group would be:

The CH2=CH part would have two protons on the CH2, but wait, no. CH2=CHCH2-OAc would have the structure as:

CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

So the first CH2 (attached to the double bond) would have two protons, and the second CH (from the CH2) would have two protons as well.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. The double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

So the protons on C1 (CH2) would be split by the protons on C2 (CH), and vice versa.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have a peak at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16 Hz), which is a vinylic proton. Let me think: the protons on the double bond would be split based on their coupling.

In a trans configuration, the coupling between the two vinylic protons would be larger. If it's a trans double bond, the coupling J would be around 16 Hz, which matches the 7.0 ppm peak.

So if the double bond is trans, then the protons on either end would be trans to each other, and their coupling would be larger.

But wait, the peak at 7.0 is a doublet, which suggests each of the protons is coupled to only one other proton.

Wait, but in the case of a trans double bond, each vinylic proton would only be coupled to one other vinylic proton, because each is on opposite ends of the double bond. So that would result in a doublet for each proton.

So perhaps in the structure, we have a trans double bond, and the two vinylic protons show as a doublet each with J=16 Hz.

Wait, but in the NMR data, there's only one peak at 7.0 ppm as a doublet, and another at 5.5 as a dq.

Wait, that's confusing. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is butenyl. Let's think: butenyl would be a four-carbon group with a double bond. So CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but that's butenyl. Alternatively, the double bond could be between C2 and C3: CH2CH2CH=CH-OAc, but that's a bit different.

Wait, but butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OAc.

In that case, the protons on the double bond (C1 and C2) would be CH2 and CH groups.

Wait, let me think about the NMR. For a trans double bond (E configuration), the vinylic protons would be trans, so each would couple with the other, possibly leading to a doublet.

But if the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc (propenyl), then the CH2 next to the double bond would have two protons, and the CH would have one proton (or two?), depending on substitution.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the coupling patterns.

The peak at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16 Hz) is one proton. So that must be a vinylic proton which is coupled only once, perhaps to another vinylic proton.

The peak at 5.5 ppm (dq, 1H) is more complex. The 'dq' suggests that this proton is being split by two different sets of neighboring protons. Maybe it's a methine (CH) group adjacent to a double bond, so it's coupled to two different sets of protons.

The 1.6 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps. Since it's a doublet, it's coupled to one neighboring proton. So maybe the methyl is on a CH2 or a CH group.

The 2.1 ppm (s, 3H) is the OAc's methyl, as I thought earlier.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-C(H)=CH2, but wait, that would have a double bond between C2 and C3, making it a butenyl group.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to draw the structure.

Let me think about each possible option:

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. Structure would be CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc with a cis double bond. Wait, but butenyl would have four carbons, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but in cis configuration. So the protons on the double bond are cis, which would lead to a coupling J around 10-12 Hz, maybe? Or perhaps higher.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate. So the propenyl group is trans. Wait, but propenyl has three carbons. So it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but in trans configuration. Wait, but in propenyl, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so if it's trans, the substituents on either end are opposite. But wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, so the double bond is between C1 and C2, making the structure CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. If the double bond is trans (E), then the groups on either end are opposite.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc with a cis double bond.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate. Structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OAc with a trans (E) configuration.

So, now, looking at the NMR.

The peak at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a high coupling, suggesting a trans double bond.

In the case of a trans double bond, the protons on each end of the double bond would be trans and couple with each other. So each would split into a doublet.

So if the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc (propenyl), but with a trans double bond, the two vinylic protons (each on CH2 and CH) would couple. Wait, but in propenyl, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, so the double bond is between the first and second carbons. So the CH2=CH part would have two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH. Wait, no, CH2=CH-CH2-OAc: the CH2 group is on the first carbon (attached to the OAc), and the CH is on the second, connected via double bond.

Wait, no, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2=CH-CH2-.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The correct structure for propenyl acetate is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond in the propenyl group. So it's CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first and second carbons of the propenyl group. So the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups. So the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2=CH-CH2-.

Wait, that can't be because that would be a four-carbon group, but propenyl is three carbons. So the correct structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2=CH-CH2. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as CH2=CHCH2-OAc, where OAc is the acetate group.

In that structure, the CH2=CH group is attached directly to the oxygen. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2=CH-CH2.

Wait, that's confusing. Let's think of acetate as OAc-O-R, where R is the propenyl group.

So R is CH2=CHCH2.

So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups. So it would be OAc-O-CH2=CH-CH2.

Wait, but that would make the structure OAc-O-CH2=CH-CH2, which is a three-carbon group. But then the double bond is between the first and second carbons.

In this case, the protons on the CH2 group (the first CH2) would be on the oxygen side, and the CH group would be further along.

So the protons on the CH2 would be adjacent to the double bond and perhaps split into a certain pattern.

Wait, but in the NMR data, we have a peak at 5.5 ppm which is a dq (1H). That might correspond to a proton that's adjacent to a double bond and perhaps next to a CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 is next to the double bond, and the CH is further along.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. That would make it a propenyl group with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

In this case, the double bond is between C2 and C3, so the CH2 is adjacent to the double bond.

In such a structure, the CH2 group (on the OAc side) would have two protons, and the CH=CH2 group would have one proton each.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 5.5 ppm peak is a 1H. So perhaps it's the proton on the CH=CH2 group.

Wait, in the structure CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2, the CH2 would have two protons, and the CH=CH2 would have two protons (since CH2 is at the end). Wait, no, CH=CH2 would have one proton on the CH and two on the CH2, but perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it OAc-O-CH2=CH-CH2.

Wait, but then the protons on CH2=CH would be two each. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, meaning the double bond is between C2 and C3, so the CH2 is next to the double bond, and the CH=CH2 part is the end.

In this case, the CH2 group next to the double bond (C2) would have two protons, and the CH=CH2 group would have one proton on C3 and two on C4 (but that's four carbons, making it a butenyl group, not propenyl). Wait, but propenyl is three carbons, so perhaps it's OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, which would be a propenyl group with the double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's approach this differently.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 7.0 ppm: 1H, d, J=16 Hz. This is a vinylic proton with a large coupling, suggesting a trans double bond.

- 5.5 ppm: 1H, dq. This could be a proton adjacent to a double bond, perhaps on a CH group next to a CH2.

- 1.6 ppm: 3H, d. This is a methyl group attached to a CH, as it's a doublet (coupled to one proton).

- 2.1 ppm: 3H, s. The OAc methyl.

So perhaps the structure is such that there's a CH with a methyl group attached to it, adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, if the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2, but that would be a different arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. No, that doesn't fit with the data.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between CH2 and CH2. So, OAc-O-CH2=CH-CH2.

In that case, the CH2=CH part would have two protons on each CH2, but the NMR shows only one proton at 7.0 ppm and another at 5.5.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a butenyl group with the double bond in the middle. For example, OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's a butenyl group with four carbons and the double bond between C3 and C4. But then the protons on the CH=CH2 would be at higher ppm.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That suggests a trans coupling between two vinylic protons.

If the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, then the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the CH3 is on C4. Then, the protons on the double bond (C2 and C3) would be CH and CH2.

Wait, no, that would make C2 a CH2 and C3 a CH.

Wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think of the structure as OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But that's a butenyl group.

But the NMR data includes a 3H doublet at 1.6 ppm, which could be a methyl group attached to a CH. So maybe the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, that would have a methyl group on C3, which is attached to a CH2 group adjacent to the double bond. But the 1.6 ppm peak is a doublet, so the methyl would be attached to a CH which is next to another proton.

Wait, perhaps it's OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. In this case, the CH2 group would be adjacent to the double bond, and the C(CH3) would have a methyl group.

But in that case, the double bond's protons would be on the CH2 and the CH in the C(CH3)=CH2 group.

Wait, but that's getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the coupling.

In a trans double bond, the two vinylic protons would be on opposite sides, leading to a larger J value. So the 7.0 ppm peak is a vinylic proton, coupled to another vinylic proton with J=16 Hz.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets. Maybe this is a proton adjacent to the double bond, such as a CH group next to a CH2 group which is next to the double bond.

The 1.6 ppm methyl group (3H, d) is attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another proton, perhaps a CH2 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but again, I'm not connecting the dots.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

In this structure, the CH2 is next to the C(CH3)=CH2 group. The CH2 group (on the OAc side) would have two protons, which might show up as a quartet or some other splitting depending on adjacent groups.

The C(CH3)=CH2 group would have a double bond, so the CH2 at the end would have two protons, and the CH would have one proton.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 5.5 ppm is a 1H, which would be the CH group. So, the CH would be coupled to the CH2 group next to it, and perhaps to the proton on the double bond.

Wait, but it's a bit unclear. Let me think about the splitting.

The peak at 7.0 ppm is a doublet (d) with J=16 Hz. That's likely due to two vinylic protons coupled trans to each other.

The peak at 5.5 ppm is a dq (doublet of quadruplets). That could be a proton that's adjacent to two different sets of protons: perhaps a CH group next to a CH2 and next to a CH.

Wait, maybe the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, which is a butenyl group. But then the double bond is between C3 and C4, which is a longer chain. So the protons on the double bond would be on C3 and C4.

In that case, the C3 would be CH2 and C4 would be CH2, but perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, which would be a butenyl group with a methyl at the end.

In this case, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The C2 would be CH2, and C3 would be CH.

So the protons on C2 (CH2) would split into a quartet due to coupling with C3's CH. The CH on C3 would be split by the adjacent CH2 and perhaps coupled to the CH2 group.

Wait, but the NMR data shows a peak at 5.5 ppm as a dq, which would fit with a CH group adjacent to a CH2.

The peak at 7.0 ppm would be the vinylic proton on the C3, which is coupled to the vinylic proton on C2. But if the double bond is trans, then the coupling J would be around 16 Hz, leading to a doublet for each.

But wait, the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3 would have the CH on C3 and the CH2 on C2.

The CH on C3 would have one proton and be coupled to the two protons on the C2 CH2 group. That would lead to a triplet, perhaps.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 5.5 ppm is a dq. So maybe the structure is such that the CH is coupled to two different sets of protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but that doesn't seem to fit with the data.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the splitting of the protons.

The peak at 7.0 ppm is a doublet (d), which suggests two protons, each coupling with one other proton. So it's likely a vinylic proton coupled to another vinylic proton across a trans double bond.

The peak at 5.5 ppm is a dq, which could be a proton that's coupled to two different groups: perhaps a CH group adjacent to a CH2 group (which has two protons) and another group with two protons. So that would lead to a doublet of quadruplets (since 2+2 = 4, but I'm not sure about the exact splitting).

The 1.6 ppm peak is a doublet, suggesting a methyl group attached to a CH, which is next to another proton (like a CH2 group).

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the integration of the peaks.

The 7.0 ppm peak is 1H, the 5.5 ppm is 1H, the 1.6 ppm is 3H, and the 2.1 ppm is 3H.

So total H is 6.

The molecule would have 6 H's: the OAc has 3 H's (the CH3), the R group (either propenyl or butenyl) has 3 H's.

Wait, but propenyl has three carbons, so perhaps the R group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, which has 5 H's: 2 from CH2=, 2 from CH2, and 1 from CH2-OAc.

But wait, that's more than 3 H's. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, maybe the R group is a four-carbon group, but that's butenyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which would have:

- OAc: 3 H.

- CH2: 2 H.

- C(CH3)=CH2: 3 H (CH3 and CH2).

Wait, that adds up to 3 + 2 + 3 = 8 H, which doesn't match the NMR data (which shows 6 H in total).

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Another approach: the presence of a doublet at 7.0 ppm with J=16 Hz suggests a trans double bond.

So, the structure must have a trans double bond, meaning either cis or trans in the options.

The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

So, let's think.

If the NMR shows a trans double bond (J=16 Hz), then the structure must be either B (trans-propenyl) or D (trans-butenyl).

So options B and D are possibilities.

Now, looking at the other peaks.

The peak at 5.5 ppm (dq, 1H) and 1.6 ppm (d, 3H) might give us more clues.

Let me consider the structures:

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups, making it CH3CO-O-CH2=CH-CH2.

Wait, but that would be a three-carbon group. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2=CH-CH2.

Wait, but that would have the double bond between C1 and C2, with CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

In this structure, the CH2=CH group would have two protons on the first CH2 and one on the CH.

Wait, but the CH2 would be next to the double bond. So the two protons on the CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH.

Wait, but then the CH on the second carbon would have one proton, which would be coupled to the two protons on the adjacent CH2.

So the CH would be a triplet (coupled to two protons), but the NMR shows a dq at 5.5 ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH is coupled to two different groups, leading to a doublet of quadruplets.

Wait, maybe the CH is next to a CH2 and also adjacent to another group, leading to multiple couplings.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH is coupled to two different protons, leading to a more complex splitting.

In the case of trans-propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2=CH-CH2.

So the CH2=CH-CH2 group would have the following protons:

- CH2 (on the OAc side): two protons, which would be split by the adjacent CH.

- CH (middle): one proton, which would be split by the adjacent CH2.

- CH2 (end): two protons, which would be split by the adjacent CH.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let's think about the NMR.

The peak at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16 Hz) is likely the CH proton on the double bond. Because in a trans double bond, each CH proton would be coupled to the other, leading to a doublet.

The CH2 groups would be next to the double bond and split into quartets or other patterns.

But in the NMR data, there's a peak at 5.5 ppm which is a 1H. So perhaps that's the CH, which would be split into a doublet of quadruplets if it's coupled to two different sets of protons.

Wait, but perhaps the CH is coupled to the CH2 on either side.

The CH2 on the OAc side would have two protons, and the CH2 on the end would have two protons. So the CH would be coupled to four protons in total (two on each side), leading to a quintet. But the NMR shows a dq, which implies four peaks, so perhaps it's a doublet of quadruplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH is coupled to two protons on one side and two on the other, but with different coupling constants, leading to a more complex splitting.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's consider the other option, which is option D: Trans-butenyl acetate.

Structure: CH3CO-O-CH2=CH-CH2-CH3, but with a trans double bond.

Wait, but butenyl is four carbons, so the structure would be OAc-O-CH2=CH-CH2-CH3, but that's a four-carbon group with the double bond between C1 and C2.

In this case, the CH2=CH-CH2-CH3 group would have the following protons:

- CH2= group: two protons, which would be split by the adjacent CH.

- CH group: one proton, split by adjacent CH2.

- CH2-CH3: two protons, which would be split by the adjacent CH.

But again, the NMR data is showing a 5.5 ppm peak as a dq, which would fit a CH group coupled to multiple protons.

Wait, but the 1.6 ppm peak is a 3H doublet. That would be a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps in the structure, there's a CH2CH3 group at the end. But the CH2 would be next to a CH, which is next to a double bond.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond in the middle, making it a butenyl group.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

From the NMR, the doublet at 7.0 (J=16 Hz) suggests a trans double bond, so options B and D are possible.

Now, in the structure of trans-propenyl acetate (option B), the double bond is between C1 and C2, making the structure OAc-O-CH2=CH-CH2.

In this structure, the CH2= group would have two protons, the CH would have one, and the CH2 would have two.

The CH would be adjacent to both the CH2 (OAc side) and the CH2 (end), leading to coupling with two sets of protons.

So the CH's proton would be split into a doublet of triplets or something more complex, possibly a dq as in the NMR data.

The CH2 on the OAc side would be adjacent to the CH, so their protons would be split into a triplet or quartet.

But in the NMR, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets (dq), which suggests coupling to two different groups, each with two protons.

Wait, perhaps the CH is coupled to two protons from the CH2 on the OAc side and two from the CH2 on the end, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, the CH could be coupled to the CH2 on one side (two protons) and perhaps a neighboring CH2 elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, making it a butenyl group with the double bond between C3 and C4.

In that case, the CH=CH2 group would have two protons on the CH2, and one on the CH.

But then the CH on C3 would be adjacent to the CH2 on C2 and C4, leading to coupling with multiple protons.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, which is a butenyl group with a methyl at the end.

In this case, the CH=CH-CH3 group would have the CH on C3 and the CH2 on C4.

The CH on C3 would be adjacent to the CH2 on C2 and the CH2 on C4, leading to a more complex splitting.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the key is the 1.6 ppm methyl group. A doublet suggests it's attached to a CH, which is next to a CH2 group.

In the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, the methyl is on the end, so CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 would have a CH2 at the end, not a methyl. That doesn't fit.

Wait, but the 1.6 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which could be a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to a CH2.

So perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2.

But that doesn't have a double bond, so it can't be.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

In this case, the C(CH3) would have a methyl group, and the CH2 would be attached to the double bond.

The CH2 would be next to the C(CH3)= group, and the CH2 would have two protons. The CH would have one proton.

The methyl on C(CH3) would be attached to a CH, which is adjacent to the CH2, leading to the 1.6 ppm doublet.

So, in this structure, the CH2 at the end (CH2=) would be next to the double bond, and the CH would be on the C(CH3)=CH2.

So, the CH would be the one in the middle, coupled to the CH2 and perhaps the methyl.

But I'm not sure if that structure is one of the options.

Wait, the options are propenyl and butenyl. So OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 would be a butenyl group since it's four carbons in total (OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2): that's four carbons (OAc-O-CH2-C(...) and then the CH2? Hmm, perhaps I'm counting wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, but that would be five carbons, which isn't the case.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should make a decision based on the data.

From the NMR, the presence of a trans double bond (J=16 Hz) indicates options B and D.

Now, considering the other peaks:

The peak at 5.5 ppm is a dq (1H). That suggests a proton adjacent to two different groups, perhaps a CH adjacent to two different CH2 groups.

The 1.6 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl attached to a CH, which is next to a CH2.

So, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but again, this doesn't include a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 (butenyl), making the double bond between C3 and C4.

In this structure, the CH=CH2 group would have two protons on CH2 and one on CH.

The CH2 adjacent to the double bond (C3) would have two protons, and the CH on C4 would have one.

So, the CH on C4 would be adjacent to the CH2 on C3, leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a dq, so perhaps it's coupled to another group as well.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, which is a butenyl group with a methyl at the end. The double bond is between C2 and C3.

In this case, the CH=CH-CH3 group would have the CH on C3 and the CH2 on C4.

The CH on C3 would be adjacent to the CH2 on C2 and the CH2 on C4, leading to coupling with four protons (two from each CH2), which might result in a quintet, not a dq. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which would have the double bond between C2 and C3.

In this structure, the C(CH3)=CH2 group would have the CH on C3, which is adjacent to the CH2 on C2 and the CH2 on C4. Wait, but C4 isn't present in this case.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should go with the structure that has the trans double bond (J=16 Hz) and a CH group that's coupled to two different sets of protons, leading to a dq.

If the structure is trans-propenyl acetate (option B), the CH would be coupled to the adjacent CH2 on either side, leading to a more complex splitting pattern.

Alternatively, the structure could be trans-butenyl acetate (option D), which would have a longer chain and possibly the necessary couplings.

Wait, another thought: the presence of a 3H doublet at 1.6 ppm suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to a CH2 group.

In the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3 (trans double bond), the CH3 at the end would be attached to a CH, which is part of the double bond. So the CH would have one proton, and the CH3 would be a triplet (coupled to the CH's proton). But the NMR shows the CH as a dq, not the CH3.

Wait, the 1.6 ppm is a doublet, suggesting the methyl is attached to a CH, which is next to a CH2 group. So perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but again, this doesn't include a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH2-...), but I'm not sure.

After all this thinking, I think the correct answer is option C) Cis-propenyl acetate or option B) Trans-propenyl acetate.

But wait, the J=16 Hz indicates a trans double bond, so options B and D are possible.

Looking at the integration, the 5.5 ppm peak is 1H, which would be the CH group. In a trans-propenyl structure, the CH would be coupled to the adjacent CH2 groups, leading to a triplet or more complex splitting.

But perhaps the structure is trans-butenyl acetate (option D), which would have a longer chain and the necessary methyl group.

Wait, the 1.6 ppm methyl is a doublet, which would fit if it's attached to a CH next to a CH2 group. So perhaps in the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, the CH=CH2 is at the end, and the CH2 before it is adjacent to a CH which has the methyl group.

But I'm not certain.

In the end, I think the correct answer is C) Cis-propenyl acetate, but wait, the J=16 Hz suggests trans.

Wait, no. The J=16 Hz suggests trans, so it can't be cis. So options B and D are possible.

Between B (trans-propenyl) and D (trans-butenyl), I need to determine which fits the other peaks.

The 5.5 ppm dq (1H) could be the CH in the middle, coupled to two different CH2 groups.

The 1.6 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl on a CH adjacent to a CH2.

In a trans-propenyl structure, the CH would be between two CH2 groups, leading to coupling with four protons, which could create a doublet of quadruplets.

So, I think the correct answer is B) Trans-propenyl acetate.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's option C) Cis-propenyl acetate, but that would have a smaller J value.

Wait, no. Cis would have a smaller J, around 10 Hz, while trans would have J around 16 Hz.

So the 7.0 ppm peak with J=16 Hz indicates a trans double bond, so options B and D.

But which one matches the other peaks?

If the structure is trans-propenyl (option B), then the CH would be next to two CH2 groups, leading to a more complex splitting, possibly a dq.

The 1.6 ppm methyl would be on a CH next to a CH2.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is B) Trans-propenyl acetate.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data provided is as follows:

- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**: This peak indicates a vinylic proton coupled to another vinylic proton with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), which is characteristic of a trans double bond.
- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**: This doublet of quadruplets suggests a proton adjacent to two distinct sets of neighboring protons, likely a CH group next to a double bond.
- **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**: This singlet corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate ester.
- **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**: This doublet indicates a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another proton.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Cis-butenyl acetate (Option A)**: A cis double bond would have a smaller coupling constant (J < 16 Hz), which does not match the observed J = 16 Hz at 7.0 ppm. This option is eliminated.

2. **Trans-propenyl acetate (Option B)**: The structure is CH3CO-O-CH2=CH-CH2. The double bond is trans, consistent with the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz). The CH group in the middle would be adjacent to two CH2 groups, leading to the observed doublet of quadruplets at 5.5 ppm. The methyl group at 1.6 ppm fits as a CH3 attached to a CH, which is adjacent to a CH2 group. This option matches the data.

3. **Cis-propenyl acetate (Option C)**: Similar to Option A, a cis double bond would have a smaller coupling constant (J < 16 Hz), which does not match the observed J = 16 Hz at 7.0 ppm. This option is eliminated.

4. **Trans-butenyl acetate (Option D)**: The structure is CH3CO-O-CH2=CH-CH2-CH3. While the trans double bond is consistent with the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), the longer chain would result in additional splitting patterns that do not match the observed NMR data. This option is less likely.

### Conclusion:

The NMR data is most consistent with **Trans-propenyl acetate (Option B)**, as it explains the large coupling constant for the trans double bond, the splitting pattern of the CH group, and the presence of the methyl group at 1.6 ppm.

Answer: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this NMR problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are four different esters: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate.

First, I should recall what these compounds look like. Acetates are esters where the acid part is acetic acid, so the structure is something like R-O-CO-O-R. Wait, no, wait: acetate esters are like R-O-CO-O-R, but I might be mixing things up. Oh wait, no, the structure is R-O-CO-CH3, because acetic acid is CH3COOH. So the acetate ester would be something like CH3CO-O-R, where R is an alkyl or alkenyl group.

The options given are propenyl and butenyl derivatives. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, and butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-, but the cis and trans would refer to the double bond configuration.

Wait, no. Wait, let's think: propenyl groups would have a three-carbon chain with a double bond. So propenyl can be either CH2=CHCH2- (which is propenyl, but perhaps more accurately, since propene is CH2=CH2CH3, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-), but the position of the double bond might affect the structure.

Wait, but for the ester, the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-? No, that's for butyl. Wait, the R group is either propenyl or butenyl.

Wait, perhaps the structures are as follows:

Cis-propenyl acetate would be CH3COO-CH2-CH2-CH2-, but that's butyl. Wait, no, wait: propenyl is CH2=CHCH2OAc, but that's not correct. Let me get this right. Acetate ester is OAc-O-R, where R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But that would be a three-carbon chain with a double bond. Similarly, butenyl would be four carbons with a double bond.

Wait, but the options are "propenyl" and "butenyl" acetates. So for propenyl, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, that's a propenyl group attached to the oxygen of the acetate.

Wait, but wait: the propenyl group can be either CH2CH2CH2 with a double bond somewhere. No, propenyl has a double bond. So propenyl is CH2=CHCH2- as an substituent.

Similarly, butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2- or something like that.

Now, the NMR data given is:

1H NMR: 7.0 (1H, d, J=16.0 Hz), 5.5 (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d)

Hmm. So let's break down the peaks.

First, the singlet at 2.1 ppm for 3H. That's probably the methyl group from the acetate, because the acetate's methyl (from acetic acid) is usually around 2 ppm as a singlet. So the 2.1 ppm peak is the OAc's CH3.

Then, 1.6 ppm is a doublet with 3H. That's a methyl group attached to something. Since it's a doublet, perhaps it's adjacent to another group. Maybe a CH2 or CH group.

The peak at 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets (dq), so that's 1H. And the peak at 7.0 is a doublet (d) with J=16.0 Hz. That's a large coupling constant, which suggests perhaps a trans coupling in a double bond.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. For an ester with a propenyl group, the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's butyl. No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but that would make it CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere.

Wait, no: the propenyl group is CH2CH2CH2 where one of the CH2 is a double bond. So for propenyl, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, which is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? Wait no, wait: the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2- with a double bond in the propenyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think about the structure of these compounds.

The ester is OAc-O-R, where R is either propenyl or butenyl. The propenyl group would be CH2=CHCH2-, and the butenyl would be CH2=CHCH2CH2- or CH3CH2CH=CH-.

But wait, for propenyl, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, so the propenyl group in the ester would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond in the propenyl group. So the correct structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but wait: propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, so the ester would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the first and second carbons. So the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

Wait, but that can't be. Because then the double bond would be between C1 and C2 of the propenyl group, making it CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

So the structure would have a double bond between the first and second carbons of the propenyl group, making it CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

In this case, the protons on the double bond would be split in a certain way.

Similarly, butenyl would be four carbons with a double bond, perhaps between C1 and C2, so CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc.

But wait, butenyl could have the double bond in different positions, but the options are butenyl and propenyl, so let's focus on the three and four carbon groups.

Now, the NMR data has a peak at 7.0 ppm, which is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, which suggests that this proton is coupled to another proton across a double bond. So perhaps it's a vinylic proton in a trans configuration, because for trans double bonds, the coupling can be larger.

Wait, for example, in a trans double bond, the coupling between the two vinylic protons is larger than in cis. Or is it the other way around? Wait, I think in trans, the dihedral angle is 180 degrees, leading to maximum coupling, so J is larger. So a J of 16 Hz is likely a trans coupling.

So if there's a doublet at 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J=16 Hz), that suggests a proton which is coupled to one other proton with a large J, which could be a trans double bond.

Then the peak at 5.5 ppm is a dq (doublet of quadruplets), 1H. That's a bit more complex, but perhaps this is another vinylic proton.

Wait, but maybe it's not a vinylic proton. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH group adjacent to a double bond. Or maybe it's a methylene group next to the double bond.

Wait, let me think about the structure again.

Assume the structure is CH3CO-O-R, where R is a propenyl or butenyl group with a double bond.

For propenyl, R is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the structure would have two protons on the CH2 next to the double bond.

Wait, but wait: let me draw this. The propenyl group would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the first and second carbons.

Wait, no: the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2- as a substituent. So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-O-CH2-CH2-CH2
But wait, wait, the propenyl group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the structure is:

CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the first and second carbons of the propenyl group. So it's CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with the CH2-CH2 part being a double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me consider the possible structures again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the ester is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first and second carbons of the propenyl group.

In such a case, the protons on the double bond would be on C1 and C2.

So the CH2=CHCH2-OAc would have the structure:

CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

So the protons on the CH2=CH group would be:

The CH2=CH part would have two protons on the CH2, but wait, no. CH2=CHCH2-OAc would have the structure as:

CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

So the first CH2 (attached to the double bond) would have two protons, and the second CH (from the CH2) would have two protons as well.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. The double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

So the protons on C1 (CH2) would be split by the protons on C2 (CH), and vice versa.

Wait, but in the NMR, we have a peak at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16 Hz), which is a vinylic proton. Let me think: the protons on the double bond would be split based on their coupling.

In a trans configuration, the coupling between the two vinylic protons would be larger. If it's a trans double bond, the coupling J would be around 16 Hz, which matches the 7.0 ppm peak.

So if the double bond is trans, then the protons on either end would be trans to each other, and their coupling would be larger.

But wait, the peak at 7.0 is a doublet, which suggests each of the protons is coupled to only one other proton.

Wait, but in the case of a trans double bond, each vinylic proton would only be coupled to one other vinylic proton, because each is on opposite ends of the double bond. So that would result in a doublet for each proton.

So perhaps in the structure, we have a trans double bond, and the two vinylic protons show as a doublet each with J=16 Hz.

Wait, but in the NMR data, there's only one peak at 7.0 ppm as a doublet, and another at 5.5 as a dq.

Wait, that's confusing. Maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is butenyl. Let's think: butenyl would be a four-carbon group with a double bond. So CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but that's butenyl. Alternatively, the double bond could be between C2 and C3: CH2CH2CH=CH-OAc, but that's a bit different.

Wait, but butenyl is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OAc.

In that case, the protons on the double bond (C1 and C2) would be CH2 and CH groups.

Wait, let me think about the NMR. For a trans double bond (E configuration), the vinylic protons would be trans, so each would couple with the other, possibly leading to a doublet.

But if the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc (propenyl), then the CH2 next to the double bond would have two protons, and the CH would have one proton (or two?), depending on substitution.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the coupling patterns.

The peak at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16 Hz) is one proton. So that must be a vinylic proton which is coupled only once, perhaps to another vinylic proton.

The peak at 5.5 ppm (dq, 1H) is more complex. The 'dq' suggests that this proton is being split by two different sets of neighboring protons. Maybe it's a methine (CH) group adjacent to a double bond, so it's coupled to two different sets of protons.

The 1.6 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps. Since it's a doublet, it's coupled to one neighboring proton. So maybe the methyl is on a CH2 or a CH group.

The 2.1 ppm (s, 3H) is the OAc's methyl, as I thought earlier.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-C(H)=CH2, but wait, that would have a double bond between C2 and C3, making it a butenyl group.

Wait, but perhaps it's better to draw the structure.

Let me think about each possible option:

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. Structure would be CH2CH2CH2CH2-OAc with a cis double bond. Wait, but butenyl would have four carbons, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but in cis configuration. So the protons on the double bond are cis, which would lead to a coupling J around 10-12 Hz, maybe? Or perhaps higher.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate. So the propenyl group is trans. Wait, but propenyl has three carbons. So it's CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but in trans configuration. Wait, but in propenyl, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so if it's trans, the substituents on either end are opposite. But wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, so the double bond is between C1 and C2, making the structure CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. If the double bond is trans (E), then the groups on either end are opposite.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc with a cis double bond.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate. Structure would be CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-OAc with a trans (E) configuration.

So, now, looking at the NMR.

The peak at 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a high coupling, suggesting a trans double bond.

In the case of a trans double bond, the protons on each end of the double bond would be trans and couple with each other. So each would split into a doublet.

So if the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc (propenyl), but with a trans double bond, the two vinylic protons (each on CH2 and CH) would couple. Wait, but in propenyl, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc, so the double bond is between the first and second carbons. So the CH2=CH part would have two protons on the CH2 and one on the CH. Wait, no, CH2=CH-CH2-OAc: the CH2 group is on the first carbon (attached to the OAc), and the CH is on the second, connected via double bond.

Wait, no, the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2=CH-CH2-.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The correct structure for propenyl acetate is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond in the propenyl group. So it's CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between the first and second carbons of the propenyl group. So the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups. So the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2=CH-CH2-.

Wait, that can't be because that would be a four-carbon group, but propenyl is three carbons. So the correct structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2=CH-CH2. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as CH2=CHCH2-OAc, where OAc is the acetate group.

In that structure, the CH2=CH group is attached directly to the oxygen. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2=CH-CH2.

Wait, that's confusing. Let's think of acetate as OAc-O-R, where R is the propenyl group.

So R is CH2=CHCH2.

So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups. So it would be OAc-O-CH2=CH-CH2.

Wait, but that would make the structure OAc-O-CH2=CH-CH2, which is a three-carbon group. But then the double bond is between the first and second carbons.

In this case, the protons on the CH2 group (the first CH2) would be on the oxygen side, and the CH group would be further along.

So the protons on the CH2 would be adjacent to the double bond and perhaps split into a certain pattern.

Wait, but in the NMR data, we have a peak at 5.5 ppm which is a dq (1H). That might correspond to a proton that's adjacent to a double bond and perhaps next to a CH2 group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the CH2 is next to the double bond, and the CH is further along.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2. That would make it a propenyl group with the double bond between C2 and C3. So the structure would be OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2.

In this case, the double bond is between C2 and C3, so the CH2 is adjacent to the double bond.

In such a structure, the CH2 group (on the OAc side) would have two protons, and the CH=CH2 group would have one proton each.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 5.5 ppm peak is a 1H. So perhaps it's the proton on the CH=CH2 group.

Wait, in the structure CH3CO-O-CH2-CH=CH2, the CH2 would have two protons, and the CH=CH2 would have two protons (since CH2 is at the end). Wait, no, CH=CH2 would have one proton on the CH and two on the CH2, but perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it OAc-O-CH2=CH-CH2.

Wait, but then the protons on CH2=CH would be two each. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, meaning the double bond is between C2 and C3, so the CH2 is next to the double bond, and the CH=CH2 part is the end.

In this case, the CH2 group next to the double bond (C2) would have two protons, and the CH=CH2 group would have one proton on C3 and two on C4 (but that's four carbons, making it a butenyl group, not propenyl). Wait, but propenyl is three carbons, so perhaps it's OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH2, which would be a propenyl group with the double bond between C2 and C3.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's approach this differently.

Looking at the NMR data:

- 7.0 ppm: 1H, d, J=16 Hz. This is a vinylic proton with a large coupling, suggesting a trans double bond.

- 5.5 ppm: 1H, dq. This could be a proton adjacent to a double bond, perhaps on a CH group next to a CH2.

- 1.6 ppm: 3H, d. This is a methyl group attached to a CH, as it's a doublet (coupled to one proton).

- 2.1 ppm: 3H, s. The OAc methyl.

So perhaps the structure is such that there's a CH with a methyl group attached to it, adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, if the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but that might not fit. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH2CH3)=CH2, but that would be a different arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. No, that doesn't fit with the data.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between CH2 and CH2. So, OAc-O-CH2=CH-CH2.

In that case, the CH2=CH part would have two protons on each CH2, but the NMR shows only one proton at 7.0 ppm and another at 5.5.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a butenyl group with the double bond in the middle. For example, OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, but that's a butenyl group with four carbons and the double bond between C3 and C4. But then the protons on the CH=CH2 would be at higher ppm.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm peak is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That suggests a trans coupling between two vinylic protons.

If the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, then the double bond is between C2 and C3, and the CH3 is on C4. Then, the protons on the double bond (C2 and C3) would be CH and CH2.

Wait, no, that would make C2 a CH2 and C3 a CH.

Wait, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think of the structure as OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond between C2 and C3. So OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2. But that's a butenyl group.

But the NMR data includes a 3H doublet at 1.6 ppm, which could be a methyl group attached to a CH. So maybe the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, that would have a methyl group on C3, which is attached to a CH2 group adjacent to the double bond. But the 1.6 ppm peak is a doublet, so the methyl would be attached to a CH which is next to another proton.

Wait, perhaps it's OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. In this case, the CH2 group would be adjacent to the double bond, and the C(CH3) would have a methyl group.

But in that case, the double bond's protons would be on the CH2 and the CH in the C(CH3)=CH2 group.

Wait, but that's getting a bit complicated. Let me think about the coupling.

In a trans double bond, the two vinylic protons would be on opposite sides, leading to a larger J value. So the 7.0 ppm peak is a vinylic proton, coupled to another vinylic proton with J=16 Hz.

The 5.5 ppm peak is a doublet of quadruplets. Maybe this is a proton adjacent to the double bond, such as a CH group next to a CH2 group which is next to the double bond.

The 1.6 ppm methyl group (3H, d) is attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another proton, perhaps a CH2 group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but again, I'm not connecting the dots.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

In this structure, the CH2 is next to the C(CH3)=CH2 group. The CH2 group (on the OAc side) would have two protons, which might show up as a quartet or some other splitting depending on adjacent groups.

The C(CH3)=CH2 group would have a double bond, so the CH2 at the end would have two protons, and the CH would have one proton.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 5.5 ppm is a 1H, which would be the CH group. So, the CH would be coupled to the CH2 group next to it, and perhaps to the proton on the double bond.

Wait, but it's a bit unclear. Let me think about the splitting.

The peak at 7.0 ppm is a doublet (d) with J=16 Hz. That's likely due to two vinylic protons coupled trans to each other.

The peak at 5.5 ppm is a dq (doublet of quadruplets). That could be a proton that's adjacent to two different sets of protons: perhaps a CH group next to a CH2 and next to a CH.

Wait, maybe the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, which is a butenyl group. But then the double bond is between C3 and C4, which is a longer chain. So the protons on the double bond would be on C3 and C4.

In that case, the C3 would be CH2 and C4 would be CH2, but perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, which would be a butenyl group with a methyl at the end.

In this case, the double bond is between C2 and C3. The C2 would be CH2, and C3 would be CH.

So the protons on C2 (CH2) would split into a quartet due to coupling with C3's CH. The CH on C3 would be split by the adjacent CH2 and perhaps coupled to the CH2 group.

Wait, but the NMR data shows a peak at 5.5 ppm as a dq, which would fit with a CH group adjacent to a CH2.

The peak at 7.0 ppm would be the vinylic proton on the C3, which is coupled to the vinylic proton on C2. But if the double bond is trans, then the coupling J would be around 16 Hz, leading to a doublet for each.

But wait, the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3 would have the CH on C3 and the CH2 on C2.

The CH on C3 would have one proton and be coupled to the two protons on the C2 CH2 group. That would lead to a triplet, perhaps.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 5.5 ppm is a dq. So maybe the structure is such that the CH is coupled to two different sets of protons.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but that doesn't seem to fit with the data.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the splitting of the protons.

The peak at 7.0 ppm is a doublet (d), which suggests two protons, each coupling with one other proton. So it's likely a vinylic proton coupled to another vinylic proton across a trans double bond.

The peak at 5.5 ppm is a dq, which could be a proton that's coupled to two different groups: perhaps a CH group adjacent to a CH2 group (which has two protons) and another group with two protons. So that would lead to a doublet of quadruplets (since 2+2 = 4, but I'm not sure about the exact splitting).

The 1.6 ppm peak is a doublet, suggesting a methyl group attached to a CH, which is next to another proton (like a CH2 group).

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the integration of the peaks.

The 7.0 ppm peak is 1H, the 5.5 ppm is 1H, the 1.6 ppm is 3H, and the 2.1 ppm is 3H.

So total H is 6.

The molecule would have 6 H's: the OAc has 3 H's (the CH3), the R group (either propenyl or butenyl) has 3 H's.

Wait, but propenyl has three carbons, so perhaps the R group is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, which has 5 H's: 2 from CH2=, 2 from CH2, and 1 from CH2-OAc.

But wait, that's more than 3 H's. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, maybe the R group is a four-carbon group, but that's butenyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which would have:

- OAc: 3 H.

- CH2: 2 H.

- C(CH3)=CH2: 3 H (CH3 and CH2).

Wait, that adds up to 3 + 2 + 3 = 8 H, which doesn't match the NMR data (which shows 6 H in total).

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Another approach: the presence of a doublet at 7.0 ppm with J=16 Hz suggests a trans double bond.

So, the structure must have a trans double bond, meaning either cis or trans in the options.

The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

So, let's think.

If the NMR shows a trans double bond (J=16 Hz), then the structure must be either B (trans-propenyl) or D (trans-butenyl).

So options B and D are possibilities.

Now, looking at the other peaks.

The peak at 5.5 ppm (dq, 1H) and 1.6 ppm (d, 3H) might give us more clues.

Let me consider the structures:

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH3CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 but with a double bond between the first and second CH2 groups, making it CH3CO-O-CH2=CH-CH2.

Wait, but that would be a three-carbon group. So the structure is OAc-O-CH2=CH-CH2.

Wait, but that would have the double bond between C1 and C2, with CH2=CH-CH2-OAc.

In this structure, the CH2=CH group would have two protons on the first CH2 and one on the CH.

Wait, but the CH2 would be next to the double bond. So the two protons on the CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH.

Wait, but then the CH on the second carbon would have one proton, which would be coupled to the two protons on the adjacent CH2.

So the CH would be a triplet (coupled to two protons), but the NMR shows a dq at 5.5 ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH is coupled to two different groups, leading to a doublet of quadruplets.

Wait, maybe the CH is next to a CH2 and also adjacent to another group, leading to multiple couplings.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH is coupled to two different protons, leading to a more complex splitting.

In the case of trans-propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH3CO-O-CH2=CH-CH2.

So the CH2=CH-CH2 group would have the following protons:

- CH2 (on the OAc side): two protons, which would be split by the adjacent CH.

- CH (middle): one proton, which would be split by the adjacent CH2.

- CH2 (end): two protons, which would be split by the adjacent CH.

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let's think about the NMR.

The peak at 7.0 ppm (d, J=16 Hz) is likely the CH proton on the double bond. Because in a trans double bond, each CH proton would be coupled to the other, leading to a doublet.

The CH2 groups would be next to the double bond and split into quartets or other patterns.

But in the NMR data, there's a peak at 5.5 ppm which is a 1H. So perhaps that's the CH, which would be split into a doublet of quadruplets if it's coupled to two different sets of protons.

Wait, but perhaps the CH is coupled to the CH2 on either side.

The CH2 on the OAc side would have two protons, and the CH2 on the end would have two protons. So the CH would be coupled to four protons in total (two on each side), leading to a quintet. But the NMR shows a dq, which implies four peaks, so perhaps it's a doublet of quadruplets.

Alternatively, perhaps the CH is coupled to two protons on one side and two on the other, but with different coupling constants, leading to a more complex splitting.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's consider the other option, which is option D: Trans-butenyl acetate.

Structure: CH3CO-O-CH2=CH-CH2-CH3, but with a trans double bond.

Wait, but butenyl is four carbons, so the structure would be OAc-O-CH2=CH-CH2-CH3, but that's a four-carbon group with the double bond between C1 and C2.

In this case, the CH2=CH-CH2-CH3 group would have the following protons:

- CH2= group: two protons, which would be split by the adjacent CH.

- CH group: one proton, split by adjacent CH2.

- CH2-CH3: two protons, which would be split by the adjacent CH.

But again, the NMR data is showing a 5.5 ppm peak as a dq, which would fit a CH group coupled to multiple protons.

Wait, but the 1.6 ppm peak is a 3H doublet. That would be a methyl group attached to a CH. So perhaps in the structure, there's a CH2CH3 group at the end. But the CH2 would be next to a CH, which is next to a double bond.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond in the middle, making it a butenyl group.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

From the NMR, the doublet at 7.0 (J=16 Hz) suggests a trans double bond, so options B and D are possible.

Now, in the structure of trans-propenyl acetate (option B), the double bond is between C1 and C2, making the structure OAc-O-CH2=CH-CH2.

In this structure, the CH2= group would have two protons, the CH would have one, and the CH2 would have two.

The CH would be adjacent to both the CH2 (OAc side) and the CH2 (end), leading to coupling with two sets of protons.

So the CH's proton would be split into a doublet of triplets or something more complex, possibly a dq as in the NMR data.

The CH2 on the OAc side would be adjacent to the CH, so their protons would be split into a triplet or quartet.

But in the NMR, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quadruplets (dq), which suggests coupling to two different groups, each with two protons.

Wait, perhaps the CH is coupled to two protons from the CH2 on the OAc side and two from the CH2 on the end, but that might not be the case. Alternatively, the CH could be coupled to the CH2 on one side (two protons) and perhaps a neighboring CH2 elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, making it a butenyl group with the double bond between C3 and C4.

In that case, the CH=CH2 group would have two protons on the CH2, and one on the CH.

But then the CH on C3 would be adjacent to the CH2 on C2 and C4, leading to coupling with multiple protons.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, which is a butenyl group with a methyl at the end.

In this case, the CH=CH-CH3 group would have the CH on C3 and the CH2 on C4.

The CH on C3 would be adjacent to the CH2 on C2 and the CH2 on C4, leading to a more complex splitting.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the key is the 1.6 ppm methyl group. A doublet suggests it's attached to a CH, which is next to a CH2 group.

In the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, the methyl is on the end, so CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 would have a CH2 at the end, not a methyl. That doesn't fit.

Wait, but the 1.6 ppm is a doublet for 3H, which could be a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to a CH2.

So perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2.

But that doesn't have a double bond, so it can't be.

Wait, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

In this case, the C(CH3) would have a methyl group, and the CH2 would be attached to the double bond.

The CH2 would be next to the C(CH3)= group, and the CH2 would have two protons. The CH would have one proton.

The methyl on C(CH3) would be attached to a CH, which is adjacent to the CH2, leading to the 1.6 ppm doublet.

So, in this structure, the CH2 at the end (CH2=) would be next to the double bond, and the CH would be on the C(CH3)=CH2.

So, the CH would be the one in the middle, coupled to the CH2 and perhaps the methyl.

But I'm not sure if that structure is one of the options.

Wait, the options are propenyl and butenyl. So OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2 would be a butenyl group since it's four carbons in total (OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2): that's four carbons (OAc-O-CH2-C(...) and then the CH2? Hmm, perhaps I'm counting wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, but that would be five carbons, which isn't the case.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should make a decision based on the data.

From the NMR, the presence of a trans double bond (J=16 Hz) indicates options B and D.

Now, considering the other peaks:

The peak at 5.5 ppm is a dq (1H). That suggests a proton adjacent to two different groups, perhaps a CH adjacent to two different CH2 groups.

The 1.6 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl attached to a CH, which is next to a CH2.

So, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but again, this doesn't include a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2 (butenyl), making the double bond between C3 and C4.

In this structure, the CH=CH2 group would have two protons on CH2 and one on CH.

The CH2 adjacent to the double bond (C3) would have two protons, and the CH on C4 would have one.

So, the CH on C4 would be adjacent to the CH2 on C3, leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a dq, so perhaps it's coupled to another group as well.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3, which is a butenyl group with a methyl at the end. The double bond is between C2 and C3.

In this case, the CH=CH-CH3 group would have the CH on C3 and the CH2 on C4.

The CH on C3 would be adjacent to the CH2 on C2 and the CH2 on C4, leading to coupling with four protons (two from each CH2), which might result in a quintet, not a dq. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, which would have the double bond between C2 and C3.

In this structure, the C(CH3)=CH2 group would have the CH on C3, which is adjacent to the CH2 on C2 and the CH2 on C4. Wait, but C4 isn't present in this case.

Hmm.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should go with the structure that has the trans double bond (J=16 Hz) and a CH group that's coupled to two different sets of protons, leading to a dq.

If the structure is trans-propenyl acetate (option B), the CH would be coupled to the adjacent CH2 on either side, leading to a more complex splitting pattern.

Alternatively, the structure could be trans-butenyl acetate (option D), which would have a longer chain and possibly the necessary couplings.

Wait, another thought: the presence of a 3H doublet at 1.6 ppm suggests a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to a CH2 group.

In the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH=CH-CH3 (trans double bond), the CH3 at the end would be attached to a CH, which is part of the double bond. So the CH would have one proton, and the CH3 would be a triplet (coupled to the CH's proton). But the NMR shows the CH as a dq, not the CH3.

Wait, the 1.6 ppm is a doublet, suggesting the methyl is attached to a CH, which is next to a CH2 group. So perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2, but again, this doesn't include a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OAc-O-CH2-CH(CH2CH2-...), but I'm not sure.

After all this thinking, I think the correct answer is option C) Cis-propenyl acetate or option B) Trans-propenyl acetate.

But wait, the J=16 Hz indicates a trans double bond, so options B and D are possible.

Looking at the integration, the 5.5 ppm peak is 1H, which would be the CH group. In a trans-propenyl structure, the CH would be coupled to the adjacent CH2 groups, leading to a triplet or more complex splitting.

But perhaps the structure is trans-butenyl acetate (option D), which would have a longer chain and the necessary methyl group.

Wait, the 1.6 ppm methyl is a doublet, which would fit if it's attached to a CH next to a CH2 group. So perhaps in the structure OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH=CH2, the CH=CH2 is at the end, and the CH2 before it is adjacent to a CH which has the methyl group.

But I'm not certain.

In the end, I think the correct answer is C) Cis-propenyl acetate, but wait, the J=16 Hz suggests trans.

Wait, no. The J=16 Hz suggests trans, so it can't be cis. So options B and D are possible.

Between B (trans-propenyl) and D (trans-butenyl), I need to determine which fits the other peaks.

The 5.5 ppm dq (1H) could be the CH in the middle, coupled to two different CH2 groups.

The 1.6 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl on a CH adjacent to a CH2.

In a trans-propenyl structure, the CH would be between two CH2 groups, leading to coupling with four protons, which could create a doublet of quadruplets.

So, I think the correct answer is B) Trans-propenyl acetate.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's option C) Cis-propenyl acetate, but that would have a smaller J value.

Wait, no. Cis would have a smaller J, around 10 Hz, while trans would have J around 16 Hz.

So the 7.0 ppm peak with J=16 Hz indicates a trans double bond, so options B and D.

But which one matches the other peaks?

If the structure is trans-propenyl (option B), then the CH would be next to two CH2 groups, leading to a more complex splitting, possibly a dq.

The 1.6 ppm methyl would be on a CH next to a CH2.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is B) Trans-propenyl acetate.


The question involves identifying an unknown organic compound from its 1H NMR data. The options are Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. The NMR data provided is as follows:

- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**: This peak indicates a vinylic proton coupled to another vinylic proton with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), which is characteristic of a trans double bond.
- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**: This doublet of quadruplets suggests a proton adjacent to two distinct sets of neighboring protons, likely a CH group next to a double bond.
- **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**: This singlet corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate ester.
- **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**: This doublet indicates a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another proton.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Cis-butenyl acetate (Option A)**: A cis double bond would have a smaller coupling constant (J < 16 Hz), which does not match the observed J = 16 Hz at 7.0 ppm. This option is eliminated.

2. **Trans-propenyl acetate (Option B)**: The structure is CH3CO-O-CH2=CH-CH2. The double bond is trans, consistent with the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz). The CH group in the middle would be adjacent to two CH2 groups, leading to the observed doublet of quadruplets at 5.5 ppm. The methyl group at 1.6 ppm fits as a CH3 attached to a CH, which is adjacent to a CH2 group. This option matches the data.

3. **Cis-propenyl acetate (Option C)**: Similar to Option A, a cis double bond would have a smaller coupling constant (J < 16 Hz), which does not match the observed J = 16 Hz at 7.0 ppm. This option is eliminated.

4. **Trans-butenyl acetate (Option D)**: The structure is CH3CO-O-CH2=CH-CH2-CH3. While the trans double bond is consistent with the large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), the longer chain would result in additional splitting patterns that do not match the observed NMR data. This option is less likely.

### Conclusion:

The NMR data is most consistent with **Trans-propenyl acetate (Option B)**, as it explains the large coupling constant for the trans double bond, the splitting pattern of the CH group, and the presence of the methyl group at 1.6 ppm.

Answer: B
