Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to remember what I learned.

The problem states that the Hamiltonian is H = εσ·n, where σ is the Pauli vector (which are the Pauli matrices), and n is an arbitrary unit vector. Oh right, the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, and they're each 2x2 matrices. So σ·n would be the sum of each component multiplied by the corresponding component of n.

Wait, but wait—since n is a unit vector, its magnitude is 1. So σ·n would just be a sum like n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. And each of those σ matrices is multiplied by the respective component of n.

Now, to find the eigenvalues of H. I remember that for any Pauli matrix, say σ_x, the eigenvalues are ±1. But this is a linear combination of them multiplied by ε. So H is ε times this combination. I think the eigenvalues would relate to the magnitude of this operator. Because when you have a vector multiplied by the Pauli matrices, the eigenvalues should be ± the magnitude of that vector multiplied by ε.

Wait, but the Pauli matrices are traceless and have eigenvalues ±1. So if I have a combination like a·σ where a is a vector (like a unit vector multiplied by some constant), then the eigenvalues of a·σ should be ±|a|. Because when you take a vector in spin space, the eigenvalues are the magnitude of that vector times the Pauli matrices.

So in this case, H is ε times (σ·n). Since n is a unit vector, the operator inside (σ·n) has eigenvalues ±1. Because σ·n would be a 2x2 matrix whose eigenvalues are 1 and -1. Hmm, wait no—actually, for any direction n, the eigenvalues of σ·n are ±1. Because the trace of σ·n is zero, and the determinant is -1, so the eigenvalues must satisfy λ² =1, so λ is ±1.

Wait, but wait—σ·n is a matrix. Let me think about this. Suppose I have σ·n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, but when you combine them, the resulting matrix's eigenvalues are ±√(n_x² + n_y² + n_z²). But since n is a unit vector, that sum is 1. So the eigenvalues of σ·n are ±1. Therefore, when multiplied by ε, the eigenvalues become ±ε.

Oh wait, no. Because H is ε times σ·n. So if σ·n's eigenvalues are ±1, then H's eigenvalues would be ε multiplied by those, so ±ε.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the general case. If I have a matrix like a·σ where a is a vector, then the eigenvalues of a·σ are ±|a|. Because the eigenvalues are the magnitude of the vector a, right? Because when a is a unit vector, the magnitude is 1, leading to eigenvalues ±1. So in this problem, H is ε times (σ·n), and since n is a unit vector, |n|=1. So the operator σ·n has magnitude 1, so its eigenvalues are ±1. Therefore, H = ε (σ·n) has eigenvalues ±ε.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check. The Pauli matrices are Hermitian, so σ·n is also Hermitian. So its eigenvalues must be real. And for a 2x2 Hermitian matrix with trace zero (since the trace of σ·n is n_x Tr(σ_x) + ... but each σ_i has Tr zero), the eigenvalues must be symmetric around zero. So they are +λ and -λ. The trace is zero, so the sum is zero. The determinant is (λ)(-λ) = -λ². But the determinant of σ·n is -1, because the determinant of each σ_i is -1, and since n is a unit vector, the determinant of σ·n is determinant(n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z) = -(n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) = -1. So the determinant is -1. So λ² = 1, so λ is ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of σ·n are +1 and -1. Thus, when multiplied by ε, the eigenvalues are ε and -ε.

So the correct eigenvalues are +ε and -ε. Looking at the options, option B is +ε, -ε.

Wait, but I thought earlier that a·σ's eigenvalues are ±|a|. In this case, a is ε times n, but H is ε times (σ·n). So the magnitude of a would be ε * |n|= ε * 1= ε. So the eigenvalues would be ±ε. That matches.

Alternatively, another approach: the Pauli matrices are 2x2, so their trace is zero. The eigenvalues of any 2x2 traceless Hermitian matrix are λ and -λ. The trace is 0, so λ + (-λ) =0. The determinant is λ*(-λ) = -λ². But the determinant of H, which is ε σ·n, is (ε)^2 times determinant(σ·n). Wait, no, determinant is multiplicative for matrices, but σ·n is a matrix and determinant is a scalar. So determinant(ε σ·n) is ε² determinant(σ·n). What's determinant(σ·n)?

Wait, let me compute determinant(σ·n). Since σ·n is a 2x2 matrix, each Pauli matrix has determinant -1 (since σ_x is [[0,1],[1,0]], determinant is (0)(0) - (1)(1) = -1. Similarly for σ_y and σ_z. For a general a·σ = a_x σ_x + a_y σ_y + a_z σ_z, the determinant is -(a_x² + a_y² + a_z²). Because the determinant of a·σ is -(a·a) when a is a vector and a·σ is the sum.

So in our case, n is a unit vector, so n·n =1. Therefore, determinant(σ·n) = - (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) = -1. So determinant(H) = determinant(ε σ·n) = ε² * determinant(σ·n) = ε² * (-1) = -ε².

But for a 2x2 matrix with eigenvalues ±ε, the determinant would be (ε)(-ε) = -ε². Which matches. So that's correct.

So the eigenvalues are +ε and -ε. So the answer should be option B.

The Hamiltonian operator is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{n} \) is an arbitrary unit vector, \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with the dimension of energy, and \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices. To find the eigenvalues of \( H \), we analyze the structure of the operator.

The term \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices weighted by the components of the unit vector \( \vec{n} \). For any unit vector \( \vec{n} \), the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \). This is because \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a traceless Hermitian matrix, and its eigenvalues must satisfy the conditions of being real, symmetric, and having a magnitude equal to the square root of the determinant. Since \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector, the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( +1 \) and \( -1 \).

When \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is multiplied by \( \varepsilon \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) become \( \pm \varepsilon \). This follows directly from the fact that scaling a matrix by a constant scales its eigenvalues by the same constant.

To confirm, we note that \( H \) is a \( 2 \times 2 \) traceless Hermitian matrix, so its eigenvalues must be \( \lambda \) and \( -\lambda \). The determinant of \( H \) is \( -\varepsilon^2 \), which matches the product of the eigenvalues \( (+\varepsilon)(-\varepsilon) = -\varepsilon^2 \). Thus, the eigenvalues of \( H \) are indeed \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A)** \( +1, -1 \): Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \).  
**B)** \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \): Correct, as shown by the analysis.  
**C)** \( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \): Incorrect, as there is no factor of \( \hbar/2 \) in the eigenvalues.  
**D)** \( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \): Incorrect, as this does not involve \( \varepsilon \).

Answer: B

So the determinant is -1. So λ² = 1, so λ is ±1. Therefore, the eigenvalues of σ·n are +1 and -1. Thus, when multiplied by ε, the eigenvalues are ε and -ε.

So the correct eigenvalues are +ε and -ε. Looking at the options, option B is +ε, -ε.

For a general a·σ = a_x σ_x + a_y σ_y + a_z σ_z, the determinant is -(a_x² + a_y² + a_z²). Because the determinant of a·σ is -(a·a) when a is a vector and a·σ is the sum.

So in our case, n is a unit vector, so n·n =1. Therefore, determinant(σ·n) = - (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) = -1. So determinant(H) = determinant(ε σ·n) = ε² * determinant(σ·n) = ε² * (-1) = -ε².

But for a 2x2 matrix with eigenvalues ±ε, the determinant would be (ε)(-ε) = -ε². Which matches. So that's correct.

So the eigenvalues are +ε and -ε. So the answer should be option B.
