Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question says we have two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that T(NN) equals S(NN) plus L(NN) plus 1, all mod 2. Oh right, T is isospin, S is spin, and L is orbital angular momentum. 

The final state has T(NN) = 0. So I think I need to find out what the spin and orbital angular momentum must be for the NN state after emission. Wait, but the initial state is 1S0. Let me recall what that notation means. The term symbol is written as (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would mean 2S+1 =1, so S=0. And L is S in spectroscopic notation? Wait, S is the spin here, but the letter is L. So 1S0 would have L=0 and S=0. Because 1S0 → 2*0+1=1, so the term is ¹S₀. So initial state is spin 0, orbital angular momentum 0, and total angular momentum J=0.

Now, the NN emits a particle X. So the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is NN plus X. Wait no, the problem says the final NN state has T=0. So maybe the particle X is emitted, and the NN pair is in a different state. Oh, the options are about the partial waves of X. So each option shows the initial state (1S0) going to some state plus a particle (like p, f, etc.)

Wait, the problem mentions that the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So each option shows the NN state after emission. Like option A: 7D1 + p. So 7D1 would be the NN state's term symbol, with 7 being 2S+1, D is L=2, and J=1.

But wait, the initial state is 1S0. So the initial state has J=0, and the final state must have J equal to something that allows for the emission of X, which has its own quantum numbers.

Wait, I think I need to consider conservation of angular momentum and parity. Also, the Pauli requirement given: T = S + L +1 mod 2. Since T is 0, that implies S + L +1 must be even, so S + L must be odd.

Wait, the Pauli exclusion principle applies to identical particles. Since the NN are identical fermions, their combined wavefunction must be antisymmetric. So the overall state includes spin, spatial, and any other quantum numbers.

Wait, the problem says the final state has T(NN)=0. So the isospin part must be considered. But I'm not super confident about how isospin works here. Let me focus on angular momentum and parity first.

Each option shows the NN final state and the emitted particle. So for each choice, I need to check if the angular momentum and parity are conserved.

The initial state is 1S0, which is spin S=0, L=0, J=0. So the total angular momentum is J=0.

After emitting X, the NN state will have some L', S', and J', and X will have its own angular momentum l and spin s. Because angular momentum must be conserved, the total J of the system before emission (which is 0) must equal the total J after emission.

Wait, but the initial and final states must have the same total angular momentum? Because in the center of mass frame, angular momentum is conserved. So the initial J=0, so the final total J must be 0 as well.

But when X is emitted, the NN and X have their own angular momenta. So the total angular momentum is the sum of the NN's J' and X's j.

Wait, but X is a boson or fermion? The problem says X has intrinsic parity -1, but I'm not sure if that helps with being a boson or fermion. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a meson, given that it's emitted by two nucleons (like a pion or something). Let's assume X is a boson, so its spin is integer. But I'm not certain.

But maybe I don't need to know the spin of X. Let me think: the initial state is J=0. So when the NN emit X, the total angular momentum must still be J=0. So the sum of the angular momenta of NN' and X must be zero.

So, for each option:

The final NN state has a certain J'. X has some l and s (orbital angular momentum and spin). So the total angular momentum would be the vector sum of J' (of NN') and the angular momentum of X.

But wait, the angular momentum of X would be the sum of its orbital angular momentum (l) and its spin (s). But in the emission process, the orbital angular momentum of X is part of the system's orbital angular momentum. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the initial state's angular momentum is zero. So the final state's total angular momentum (NN' + X) must also be zero. So the angular momentum carried away by X must be equal and opposite to that of NN'.

So, the total angular momentum after emission is J_final = J_NN' + J_X. Since J_initial = 0, J_final must also be 0. So J_NN' and J_X must be such that their vector sum is zero. This implies that J_NN' and J_X are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So J_NN' must equal J_X, but opposite in direction. But I think this is only possible if both have zero angular momentum, which can't be the case here. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as the initial J=0, so when the NN emit X, the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN is L'. Plus their spins... This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should instead look at the parity and angular momentum conservation.

The parity of the initial state is given by (-1)^L. Since the initial state is 1S0, L=0, so parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

When the particle X is emitted, the parity of the final state must also be considered. The parity of the system after emission is the product of the parity of the NN' state and the parity of X.

The parity of the NN' state is (-1)^L', where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' pair. The parity of X is given as -1. So the total parity after emission is (-1)^L' * (-1)^l_X, where l_X is the orbital angular momentum of X.

Since parity is conserved, the initial parity must equal the final parity. So:

Initial parity = +1 = (-1)^L' * (-1)^l_X.

So, (-1)^(L' + l_X) =1 → L' + l_X must be even. Because (-1)^even =1.

Therefore, L' and l_X must have the same parity. So L' + l_X is even → L' and l_X are both even or both odd.

Additionally, the problem states that the Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Since T=0, that equation becomes 0 ≡ S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2.

So S and L must be of opposite parity. One even, the other odd.

Now, each option gives the NN state after emission. Let's parse each option.

Option A: 7D1 + p.

The NN state is 7D1. 7 is 2S+1, so S=(7-1)/2=3. So S=3. D is L=2. So L=2.

From the condition S+L must be odd: 3+2=5 → odd. So yes, that's allowed. Now, the parity condition: L' is 2, and the emitted particle X is p. What's the orbital angular momentum of X? The initial state is 1S0 (L=0), and the outgoing X has some orbital angular momentum. The orbital angular momentum of X is the l in the term. So in option A, the X is emitted with l=p? Wait, the options denote the particle as p, s, f, etc., which are the orbital angular momentum letters. So in option A, the particle has l= p → l=1.

So L' is 2, l_X is 1. L' + l_X = 3, which is odd. But earlier, we needed L' + l_X to be even. So this combination would give parity (-1)^(2+1)= (-1)^3 = -1, but initial parity is +1. So this would violate parity conservation, right? So this option is not allowed. But wait, let me confirm.

Wait, the parity after emission is (-1)^L' * (-1)^l_X. For option A: (-1)^2 * (-1)^1 = (1)*(-1) = -1. Which doesn't match the initial parity of +1. So this is not allowed. So option A is not permitted.

But wait, I should check all options to make sure. 

Option B: 1S0 → 3S1 + p.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0, and the final NN state is 3S1. So the NN state's term is 3S1. So 3=2S+1 → S=1. L is S in this case? Wait, the term is written as (2S+1)L(J). So for 3S1, 2S+1=3 → S=1. L is S, which is in spectroscopic notation, so L=0 (since S is the letter for L=0). Wait, no, the letters go S(0), P(1), D(2), F(3), etc. So 3S1: L=0, S=1, J=1.

So the NN state has L' =0, S=1. From the condition, S + L =1 +0=1 → satisfies the condition.

Now, X is p. So l_X=1.

So L' is 0, l_X=1. L' + l_X =1. Which is odd. So parity after emission is (-1)^0 * (-1)^1= 1*(-1)= -1. Which again doesn't match the initial parity of +1. So this would violate parity conservation. So option B is also not allowed.

Wait, but we're looking for which partial wave is not permitted. So if both A and B are invalid, perhaps I made a mistake. Because the question says only one option is not permitted.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the parity. Let me recheck.

In option B: NN state is 3S1. So L'=0. X is p, which is l=1.

Parity after emission: (-1)^(L') * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^0 * (-1)^1 = 1 * (-1) = -1.

Initial parity is +1. So this is a mismatch. Hence, this is not allowed. So option B is invalid. But the question says which partial wave is not permitted. So either A or B might be invalid. Let's proceed.

Option C: 1S0 →3D3 +f.

The NN state is 3D3. 3=2S+1 → S=1. D is L=2. So L'=2.

So S=1, L'=2. S+L=3 → odd. So condition is satisfied.

Particle X is f. So l_X=3 (since f is L=3).

L' + l_X =2+3=5 → odd. So parity is (-1)^2 * (-1)^3 = (1)*(-1) = -1. Doesn't match initial parity. So this is invalid. But wait, what about the spin part? Hmm, I think I'm missing something. Because the orbital angular momentum of X is l, but the total angular momentum j of X would be l plus its spin. But I'm not sure if that affects the parity. Because parity is only dependent on orbital angular momentum. So the spin of X doesn't contribute to parity.

So in this option, the parity is -1, which doesn't match, so it's invalid. Hmm, so C is also invalid.

Option D: 1S0 →3P0 + s.

The NN state is 3P0. 3=2S+1 → S=1. P is L=1. So L'=1.

S=1, L'=1. S+L=2 → even. So condition is 0 ≡ 2 mod 2 → no, because 2 mod2 is 0. Wait, the condition says S + L must be 1 mod2. So 1+1=2 → 0 mod2. So the condition is not met. So this option's Pauli condition is not satisfied. So T=0 would require S + L +1 to be even → (S+L) must be odd. So in D, S+L=2, which is even. So this violates the Pauli condition.

Wait, but wait: T(NN) is 0. The equation is T = S + L +1 mod2. So 0 = S + L +1 mod2 → S+L =1 mod2. So in D, S=1, L=1. 1+1=2 → mod2 is 0. So 0 ≠1. So this condition is not satisfied. So option D is invalid.

Now, let me recap:

Option A: L'=2, l_X=1. L' + l_X=3 → parity -1. Bad.

Option B: L'=0, l_X=1 → parity -1. Bad.

Option C: L'=2, l_X=3 → parity -1. Bad.

Option D: Pauli condition violated.

Wait, but the question says which partial wave is not permitted. So which one is not allowed.

Wait, but the Pauli condition is only about the NN state's S and L. So for Option D, the Pauli condition is not met, so that's not allowed. But also, the parity condition for option D: let's compute.

Option D: X is s, which is l=0.

NN state is 3P0 → L'=1.

X has l=0.

Parity after emission: (-1)^1 * (-1)^0 = (-1)*1 = -1. Again, doesn't match initial parity of +1.

So for option D, both the Pauli condition and parity are violated. So it's not allowed.

Wait, but the options are about the partial waves. Each option gives the partial wave of X as p, s, f, etc. So the allowed partial waves are those for X that satisfy both parity and angular momentum conservation.

Wait, the initial state has J=0. So the final state's total J must be zero. How does that affect the options?

The total J after emission is the sum of the NN's J' and X's j. But the vector sum must be zero.

But for each option, let's think about the possible J'.

For option A: NN state is 7D1 → S=3, L=2, J=1.

So NN' has J'=1.

X has orbital angular momentum l=1 (p) and spin s. Let's say X is a spin-0 particle. So j_X=1 (since j = l + s → 1+0=1).

But then, the total J is J_NN' + J_X. 1 +1 =2, which doesn't give zero. So this can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps X has spin 1/2, but that's a fermion. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let's see: for each option, I need to check whether the angular momentum can be conserved, i.e., whether the total J after is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum and spin add up to J=0.

But this is getting a bit too involved. Maybe I should focus on just the parity and Pauli condition.

So going back, each option must satisfy:

1. Parity conservation: (-1)^L' * (-1)^l_X = 1.

2. Pauli condition: S' + L' ≡1 mod2.

Let's reevaluate each option with this in mind.

Option A:

NN state: S=3, L'=2.

Pauli: 3+2=5 → 1 mod2 → okay.

l_X =1.

Parity: (-1)^2 * (-1)^1 = 1 * (-1) = -1. Doesn't match initial parity of +1. So parity violated. Hence, not allowed.

Option B:

NN state: S=1, L'=0.

Pauli: 1+0=1 → okay.

l_X=1.

Parity: (-1)^0 * (-1)^1 = 1*(-1)= -1. Doesn't match. So parity violated. Not allowed.

Option C:

S=1, L'=2.

Pauli: 1+2=3 →1 mod2 → okay.

l_X=3.

Parity: (-1)^2 * (-1)^3= 1*(-1) =-1 → parity violated. Not allowed.

Option D:

NN state: S=1, L'=1.

Pauli: 1+1=2 →0 mod2. Doesn't satisfy the condition (needs 1). So Pauli condition violated. Plus, parity:

l_X=0.

Parity: (-1)^1 * (-1)^0= (-1)*1=-1 → parity violated. So this is invalid for both reasons.

So all options except one have parity violation. But looking at the options, let's see which one could have parity matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with one of the options.

Wait, let's recheck parity for each.

Option A: L'=2, l_X=1 → 2+1=3 → parity (-1)^3= -1. No.

Option B: L'=0, l=1 → 0+1=1 → (-1)^1 =-1. No.

Option C: L'=2, l=3 → 2+3=5 → (-1)^5= -1. No.

Option D: L'=1, l=0 →1+0=1 → (-1)^1= -1. No.

Wait a minute! So all options have parity not conserved. That can't be right, because the question says one is not allowed.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the parity formula.

The parity of the final state is (-1)^{L'} * (-1)^{l_X}.

Wait, no. Because when the particle X is emitted, the system's orbital angular momentum is L' and X's orbital angular momentum is l.

But wait, the parity of the entire system is the product of the parity of the NN' state and the parity of X.

The parity of the NN' state is (-1)^L'. The parity of X is (-1)^l_X.

So the total parity is (-1)^L' * (-1)^l_X.

Which must equal the initial parity of +1.

So equation: (-1)^{L' + l_X} = 1 → L' + l_X must be even.

So for each option:

Option A: L' =2, l_X=1 → 3 → odd. No.

Option B: L'=0, l=1 →1 → odd. No.

Option C: L'=2, l=3 →5→ odd. No.

Option D: L'=1, l=0 →1→ odd. No.

Hmm, this suggests all options have L' + l_X odd, which would make the parity -1. But the initial parity is +1. So none would be allowed, which contradicts the question.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I determine l_X. Maybe the particle X's orbital angular momentum is not the same as the emitted l. Because X is emitted, perhaps its orbital angular momentum is considered in the relative motion of the NN pair.

Wait, another approach: when two particles (A and B) emit a third particle (X), the orbital angular momentum of X is the relative orbital angular momentum between the NN pair and X.

So the initial NN state has L=0. After emitting X, the NN pair has L' and X has l. The total angular momentum (which must be zero) is the sum of NN's J' and X's j. But this might not directly help with parity.

Wait, perhaps the parity of the NN' state is (-1)^L', and the parity of X is (-1)^l_X. So the total parity is their product, which must equal the initial parity (+1).

So (-1)^{L'} * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L' + l_X} =1 → L' + l_X must be even.

So for each option:

A: L'=2; l_X=1 → 3 → odd. No.

B: L'=0; l=1 →1 → odd. No.

C: L'=2; l=3 →5 → odd. No.

D: L'=1; l=0 →1→ odd. No.

So all options have L' + l_X odd, which can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial state.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0, which means L=0, S=0, J=0. So the parity is (-1)^0= +1. So the parity of the initial state is +1.

So for the options to be allowed, their parity must be +1. Hence, their L' + l_X must be even.

But looking at the options, none of them have L' + l_X even. So all options would violate parity, but the question states that one is not permitted. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the emitted particle X's parity is considered as part of the NN system. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the parity calculation.

Wait, perhaps the parity of the entire system is the product of parities of each part. So the parity of the NN' state is (-1)^L', and the parity of X is (-1)^{l_X}.

So the total parity is (-1)^{L'} * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L' + l_X}.

This must be equal to the initial parity of +1. So L' + l_X must be even.

So for each option:

Option A: L'=2, l_X=1 → 3 → odd → parity is -1. No.

Option B: L'=0, l=1 →1 → odd. No.

Option C: L'=2, l=3 →5→ odd. No.

Option D: L'=1, l=0 →1→ odd. No.

Hmm, all options have parity not conserved. So perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, what if the particle X is in a state with orbital angular momentum l, but the parity also includes the spin of X? No, parity is purely a function of orbital angular momentum, not spin.

Another thought: perhaps the emitted X carries away angular momentum, but the orbital angular momentum of X is part of the NN system.

Wait, perhaps the parity of the entire system (NN' and X) is the product of their individual parities. But the initial system (just NN) has parity (+1). The final system has NN' and X. So their combined parity must be (+1)*[parity of NN'] * [parity of X].

Wait, no, the combined parity is the product of their individual parities. So the initial parity is +1. The final parity is [parity of NN'] * [parity of X] = (-1)^{L'} * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L' + l_X}.

Which must equal +1. So L' + l_X must be even.

But all the options have L' + l_X odd. So none would be allowed? That can't be right because the question says one is not permitted. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the initial state's parity is not just (-1)^L. Because when the initial state is 1S0, which is (2S+1)L(J) → S=0, L=0, so parity is (-1)^0= +1. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating l_X for each option. Let me check what each option's particle corresponds to:

Looking at the options:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p.

p is the letter for orbital angular momentum l=1. So l_X=1.

B) 1S0 →3S1 + p. l=1.

C) 1S0 →3D3 +f. f is l=3.

D) 1S0 →3P0 + s. s is l=0.

So that's correct. So for each option, l_X is as I thought.

Wait, but what about the spin of X? Does that affect parity? No, because parity is determined by orbital angular momentum.

So perhaps I'm stuck. All options have parity violation, but the question says only one is not permitted. So perhaps I should reevaluate the Pauli condition.

The Pauli condition is T = S + L + 1 mod2. So for the final NN state, T=0.

So 0 = S' + L' +1 mod2 → S' + L' =1 mod2.

So S' and L' must be of opposite parity.

So for each option:

Option A: S'=3, L'=2 →3+2=5 →1 mod2 → yes.

Option B: S'=1, L'=0 →1 → yes.

Option C: S'=1, L'=2 →3 →1 mod2 → yes.

Option D: S'=1, L'=1 →2 →0 mod2 → no. So Pauli condition not met.

So option D violates the Pauli condition, but also the parity condition.

But the question is about which partial wave is not permitted, considering both conditions.

So for each option, I need to check both conditions.

Let me list:

Option A:

Pauli: yes.

Parity: no.

So not allowed.

Option B:

Pauli: yes.

Parity: no.

Not allowed.

Option C:

Pauli: yes.

Parity: no.

Not allowed.

Option D:

Pauli: no.

Parity: no.

Not allowed.

Wait, but this suggests all options are not permitted. Which can't be right. So perhaps I made an error in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps for option D, the parity is:

L'=1 (for NN'), l_X=0.

So L' + l_X=1. So (-1)^1 =-1. Which doesn't match initial parity.

But perhaps the parity is calculated differently. For example, maybe the orbital angular momentum of X is reversed?

Alternatively, perhaps X's orbital angular momentum is considered opposite to that in the NN' state. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm considering the wrong parity for X.

Wait, the problem says that X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X is -1. So regardless of its orbital angular momentum, its parity is -1. Because parity includes the orbital part and any intrinsic parity.

Wait, no. Parity is a product of the orbital part and the intrinsic parity. So the intrinsic parity of X is given as -1. So the parity of X is (-1)^l_X * intrinsic_parity.

So the parity of X is (-1)^l_X * (-1) = (-1)^(l_X +1).

Wait, that's a different way to look at it. So the parity of X is (-1)^(l_X +1).

So when combining, the total parity is:

parity_NN' * parity_X = [ (-1)^L' ] * [ (-1)^{l_X +1} ] = (-1)^{L' + l_X +1}.

This must equal the initial parity of +1.

So (-1)^{L' + l_X +1} =1 → L' + l_X +1 must be even → L' + l_X must be odd.

Ah! So I think I made a mistake earlier. X's parity isn't just (-1)^l_X, it's (-1)^l_X multiplied by its intrinsic parity, which is -1. So the parity of X is (-1)^l_X * (-1) = (-1)^{l_X +1}.

So the total parity after emission is (-1)^{L'} * (-1)^{l_X +1} = (-1)^{L' + l_X +1}.

Setting this equal to initial parity of +1:

(-1)^{L' + l_X +1} =1 → exponent must be even → L' + l_X +1 = even → L' + l_X must be odd.

So now, the condition is L' + l_X is odd.

So let's recheck each option.

Option A: L'=2, l_X=1 → 2+1=3 → odd. So condition met.

Parity: (-1)^{3+1} = (-1)^4=1. So yes, parity conserved. So option A is allowed.

Option B: L'=0, l_X=1 →0+1=1→ odd. So condition met.

Parity: (-1)^{0+1 +1}= (-1)^2=1. So yes. So option B is allowed.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate this correctly.

Wait, the total parity after emission is (-1)^{L' + l_X +1}.

So for option A:

L' + l_X +1 = 2+1+1=4 → (-1)^4=1 → okay.

Option B:

0+1+1=2 → (-1)^2=1 → okay.

Option C:

L'=2, l_X=3 →2+3+1=6 → (-1)^6=1 → okay.

Option D:

L'=1, l_X=0 →1+0+1=2 → (-1)^2=1→ okay.

So all options have parity conserved. Wait, but this is the opposite of what I thought earlier. So I must have made a mistake in the initial parity calculation.

Wait, the key was that the parity of X is (-1)^l_X multiplied by its intrinsic parity. So the total parity is [ (-1)^L' ] * [ (-1)^l_X * (-1) ] = (-1)^{L' + l_X +1}.

So for each option:

Option A: L'=2, l=1. 2+1+1=4 → even → parity +1. Correct.

Option B: L'=0, l=1. 0+1+1=2 → even → parity +1. Correct.

Option C: L'=2, l=3 →2+3+1=6 → even → parity +1. Correct.

Option D: L'=1, l=0 →1+0+1=2 → even → parity +1. Correct.

So parity is conserved in all options.

But what about the Pauli condition?

The Pauli condition is T= S' + L' +1 mod2.

T=0 → S' + L' +1 must be even → S' + L' must be odd.

So checking each option.

Option A: S'=3, L'=2 →3+2=5 → odd → condition met.

Option B: S'=1, L'=0 →1+0=1 → odd → condition met.

Option C: S'=1, L'=2 →3 → odd → condition met.

Option D: S'=1, L'=1 →2 → even → condition not met.

So the only option that violates the Pauli condition is option D.

But the question is which partial wave is not permitted, considering both angular momentum and parity conservation.

Wait, but all options have parity conserved, but some have Pauli condition not met. So the problem says which partial wave is not permitted.

In the question, the options are about the emitted particle's partial wave (l of X). So for each option, the partial wave is l=1(p), l=1(p), l=3(f), l=0(s).

But the Pauli condition is about the NN' state's S and L. So the question is, which option violates either the parity or the Pauli condition.

But in the initial analysis, all options have parity conserved. So the only option that violates any condition is option D, which violates the Pauli condition.

Wait, but the problem says the question is about which partial wave is not permitted, considering both conservation of angular momentum and parity.

In this case, all options have parity conserved. So the Pauli condition is the only consideration. So the only option that violates the Pauli condition is option D, which has S'=1, L'=1 → sum even, which violates T=0.

So the partial wave in option D is s (l=0). So that's the one not permitted.

Wait, but the question says which partial wave is not permitted. So the one that doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition.

So the answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:

1. **Initial State**: The NN system is in the 1S0 state, which corresponds to \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The parity of the initial state is \( (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \).

2. **Final State**: After emitting a particle \( X \), the NN system transitions to a new state with quantum numbers \( S' \), \( L' \), and \( J' \). The emitted particle \( X \) has an intrinsic parity of \( -1 \) and an orbital angular momentum \( l_X \). The total parity of the system after emission must conserve parity, and the Pauli condition \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \) must also be satisfied.

3. **Parity Conservation**: The total parity after emission is given by:
   \[
   (-1)^{L'} \cdot (-1)^{l_X + 1} = (-1)^{L' + l_X + 1}.
   \]
   This must equal the initial parity of \( +1 \), so:
   \[
   (-1)^{L' + l_X + 1} = 1 \implies L' + l_X + 1 \text{ is even} \implies L' + l_X \text{ is odd}.
   \]

4. **Pauli Condition**: Since \( T(NN) = 0 \), the condition becomes:
   \[
   0 = S' + L' + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \implies S' + L' \text{ is odd}.
   \]

### Final Answer
The partial wave not permitted is **Option D**, as it violates the Pauli condition. 

Answer: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons emitting a particle, and I need to figure out which partial wave isn't allowed. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question says we have two nucleons (NN) in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X which has an intrinsic parity of -1. Pauli statistics require that T(NN) equals S(NN) plus L(NN) plus 1, all mod 2. Oh right, T is isospin, S is spin, and L is orbital angular momentum. 

The final state has T(NN) = 0. So I think I need to find out what the spin and orbital angular momentum must be for the NN state after emission. Wait, but the initial state is 1S0. Let me recall what that notation means. The term symbol is written as (2S+1)L(J). So 1S0 would mean 2S+1 =1, so S=0. And L is S in spectroscopic notation? Wait, S is the spin here, but the letter is L. So 1S0 would have L=0 and S=0. Because 1S0 → 2*0+1=1, so the term is ¹S₀. So initial state is spin 0, orbital angular momentum 0, and total angular momentum J=0.

Now, the NN emits a particle X. So the initial state is 1S0, and the final state is NN plus X. Wait no, the problem says the final NN state has T=0. So maybe the particle X is emitted, and the NN pair is in a different state. Oh, the options are about the partial waves of X. So each option shows the initial state (1S0) going to some state plus a particle (like p, f, etc.)

Wait, the problem mentions that the term symbol is (2S+1)L(J). So each option shows the NN state after emission. Like option A: 7D1 + p. So 7D1 would be the NN state's term symbol, with 7 being 2S+1, D is L=2, and J=1.

But wait, the initial state is 1S0. So the initial state has J=0, and the final state must have J equal to something that allows for the emission of X, which has its own quantum numbers.

Wait, I think I need to consider conservation of angular momentum and parity. Also, the Pauli requirement given: T = S + L +1 mod 2. Since T is 0, that implies S + L +1 must be even, so S + L must be odd.

Wait, the Pauli exclusion principle applies to identical particles. Since the NN are identical fermions, their combined wavefunction must be antisymmetric. So the overall state includes spin, spatial, and any other quantum numbers.

Wait, the problem says the final state has T(NN)=0. So the isospin part must be considered. But I'm not super confident about how isospin works here. Let me focus on angular momentum and parity first.

Each option shows the NN final state and the emitted particle. So for each choice, I need to check if the angular momentum and parity are conserved.

The initial state is 1S0, which is spin S=0, L=0, J=0. So the total angular momentum is J=0.

After emitting X, the NN state will have some L', S', and J', and X will have its own angular momentum l and spin s. Because angular momentum must be conserved, the total J of the system before emission (which is 0) must equal the total J after emission.

Wait, but the initial and final states must have the same total angular momentum? Because in the center of mass frame, angular momentum is conserved. So the initial J=0, so the final total J must be 0 as well.

But when X is emitted, the NN and X have their own angular momenta. So the total angular momentum is the sum of the NN's J' and X's j.

Wait, but X is a boson or fermion? The problem says X has intrinsic parity -1, but I'm not sure if that helps with being a boson or fermion. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps X is a meson, given that it's emitted by two nucleons (like a pion or something). Let's assume X is a boson, so its spin is integer. But I'm not certain.

But maybe I don't need to know the spin of X. Let me think: the initial state is J=0. So when the NN emit X, the total angular momentum must still be J=0. So the sum of the angular momenta of NN' and X must be zero.

So, for each option:

The final NN state has a certain J'. X has some l and s (orbital angular momentum and spin). So the total angular momentum would be the vector sum of J' (of NN') and the angular momentum of X.

But wait, the angular momentum of X would be the sum of its orbital angular momentum (l) and its spin (s). But in the emission process, the orbital angular momentum of X is part of the system's orbital angular momentum. Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the initial state's angular momentum is zero. So the final state's total angular momentum (NN' + X) must also be zero. So the angular momentum carried away by X must be equal and opposite to that of NN'.

So, the total angular momentum after emission is J_final = J_NN' + J_X. Since J_initial = 0, J_final must also be 0. So J_NN' and J_X must be such that their vector sum is zero. This implies that J_NN' and J_X are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So J_NN' must equal J_X, but opposite in direction. But I think this is only possible if both have zero angular momentum, which can't be the case here. Wait, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as the initial J=0, so when the NN emit X, the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN is L'. Plus their spins... This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should instead look at the parity and angular momentum conservation.

The parity of the initial state is given by (-1)^L. Since the initial state is 1S0, L=0, so parity is (-1)^0 = +1.

When the particle X is emitted, the parity of the final state must also be considered. The parity of the system after emission is the product of the parity of the NN' state and the parity of X.

The parity of the NN' state is (-1)^L', where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN' pair. The parity of X is given as -1. So the total parity after emission is (-1)^L' * (-1)^l_X, where l_X is the orbital angular momentum of X.

Since parity is conserved, the initial parity must equal the final parity. So:

Initial parity = +1 = (-1)^L' * (-1)^l_X.

So, (-1)^(L' + l_X) =1 → L' + l_X must be even. Because (-1)^even =1.

Therefore, L' and l_X must have the same parity. So L' + l_X is even → L' and l_X are both even or both odd.

Additionally, the problem states that the Pauli statistics require T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 mod 2. Since T=0, that equation becomes 0 ≡ S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2.

So S and L must be of opposite parity. One even, the other odd.

Now, each option gives the NN state after emission. Let's parse each option.

Option A: 7D1 + p.

The NN state is 7D1. 7 is 2S+1, so S=(7-1)/2=3. So S=3. D is L=2. So L=2.

From the condition S+L must be odd: 3+2=5 → odd. So yes, that's allowed. Now, the parity condition: L' is 2, and the emitted particle X is p. What's the orbital angular momentum of X? The initial state is 1S0 (L=0), and the outgoing X has some orbital angular momentum. The orbital angular momentum of X is the l in the term. So in option A, the X is emitted with l=p? Wait, the options denote the particle as p, s, f, etc., which are the orbital angular momentum letters. So in option A, the particle has l= p → l=1.

So L' is 2, l_X is 1. L' + l_X = 3, which is odd. But earlier, we needed L' + l_X to be even. So this combination would give parity (-1)^(2+1)= (-1)^3 = -1, but initial parity is +1. So this would violate parity conservation, right? So this option is not allowed. But wait, let me confirm.

Wait, the parity after emission is (-1)^L' * (-1)^l_X. For option A: (-1)^2 * (-1)^1 = (1)*(-1) = -1. Which doesn't match the initial parity of +1. So this is not allowed. So option A is not permitted.

But wait, I should check all options to make sure. 

Option B: 1S0 → 3S1 + p.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0, and the final NN state is 3S1. So the NN state's term is 3S1. So 3=2S+1 → S=1. L is S in this case? Wait, the term is written as (2S+1)L(J). So for 3S1, 2S+1=3 → S=1. L is S, which is in spectroscopic notation, so L=0 (since S is the letter for L=0). Wait, no, the letters go S(0), P(1), D(2), F(3), etc. So 3S1: L=0, S=1, J=1.

So the NN state has L' =0, S=1. From the condition, S + L =1 +0=1 → satisfies the condition.

Now, X is p. So l_X=1.

So L' is 0, l_X=1. L' + l_X =1. Which is odd. So parity after emission is (-1)^0 * (-1)^1= 1*(-1)= -1. Which again doesn't match the initial parity of +1. So this would violate parity conservation. So option B is also not allowed.

Wait, but we're looking for which partial wave is not permitted. So if both A and B are invalid, perhaps I made a mistake. Because the question says only one option is not permitted.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the parity. Let me recheck.

In option B: NN state is 3S1. So L'=0. X is p, which is l=1.

Parity after emission: (-1)^(L') * (-1)^l_X = (-1)^0 * (-1)^1 = 1 * (-1) = -1.

Initial parity is +1. So this is a mismatch. Hence, this is not allowed. So option B is invalid. But the question says which partial wave is not permitted. So either A or B might be invalid. Let's proceed.

Option C: 1S0 →3D3 +f.

The NN state is 3D3. 3=2S+1 → S=1. D is L=2. So L'=2.

So S=1, L'=2. S+L=3 → odd. So condition is satisfied.

Particle X is f. So l_X=3 (since f is L=3).

L' + l_X =2+3=5 → odd. So parity is (-1)^2 * (-1)^3 = (1)*(-1) = -1. Doesn't match initial parity. So this is invalid. But wait, what about the spin part? Hmm, I think I'm missing something. Because the orbital angular momentum of X is l, but the total angular momentum j of X would be l plus its spin. But I'm not sure if that affects the parity. Because parity is only dependent on orbital angular momentum. So the spin of X doesn't contribute to parity.

So in this option, the parity is -1, which doesn't match, so it's invalid. Hmm, so C is also invalid.

Option D: 1S0 →3P0 + s.

The NN state is 3P0. 3=2S+1 → S=1. P is L=1. So L'=1.

S=1, L'=1. S+L=2 → even. So condition is 0 ≡ 2 mod 2 → no, because 2 mod2 is 0. Wait, the condition says S + L must be 1 mod2. So 1+1=2 → 0 mod2. So the condition is not met. So this option's Pauli condition is not satisfied. So T=0 would require S + L +1 to be even → (S+L) must be odd. So in D, S+L=2, which is even. So this violates the Pauli condition.

Wait, but wait: T(NN) is 0. The equation is T = S + L +1 mod2. So 0 = S + L +1 mod2 → S+L =1 mod2. So in D, S=1, L=1. 1+1=2 → mod2 is 0. So 0 ≠1. So this condition is not satisfied. So option D is invalid.

Now, let me recap:

Option A: L'=2, l_X=1. L' + l_X=3 → parity -1. Bad.

Option B: L'=0, l_X=1 → parity -1. Bad.

Option C: L'=2, l_X=3 → parity -1. Bad.

Option D: Pauli condition violated.

Wait, but the question says which partial wave is not permitted. So which one is not allowed.

Wait, but the Pauli condition is only about the NN state's S and L. So for Option D, the Pauli condition is not met, so that's not allowed. But also, the parity condition for option D: let's compute.

Option D: X is s, which is l=0.

NN state is 3P0 → L'=1.

X has l=0.

Parity after emission: (-1)^1 * (-1)^0 = (-1)*1 = -1. Again, doesn't match initial parity of +1.

So for option D, both the Pauli condition and parity are violated. So it's not allowed.

Wait, but the options are about the partial waves. Each option gives the partial wave of X as p, s, f, etc. So the allowed partial waves are those for X that satisfy both parity and angular momentum conservation.

Wait, the initial state has J=0. So the final state's total J must be zero. How does that affect the options?

The total J after emission is the sum of the NN's J' and X's j. But the vector sum must be zero.

But for each option, let's think about the possible J'.

For option A: NN state is 7D1 → S=3, L=2, J=1.

So NN' has J'=1.

X has orbital angular momentum l=1 (p) and spin s. Let's say X is a spin-0 particle. So j_X=1 (since j = l + s → 1+0=1).

But then, the total J is J_NN' + J_X. 1 +1 =2, which doesn't give zero. So this can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps X has spin 1/2, but that's a fermion. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating this. Let's see: for each option, I need to check whether the angular momentum can be conserved, i.e., whether the total J after is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum and spin add up to J=0.

But this is getting a bit too involved. Maybe I should focus on just the parity and Pauli condition.

So going back, each option must satisfy:

1. Parity conservation: (-1)^L' * (-1)^l_X = 1.

2. Pauli condition: S' + L' ≡1 mod2.

Let's reevaluate each option with this in mind.

Option A:

NN state: S=3, L'=2.

Pauli: 3+2=5 → 1 mod2 → okay.

l_X =1.

Parity: (-1)^2 * (-1)^1 = 1 * (-1) = -1. Doesn't match initial parity of +1. So parity violated. Hence, not allowed.

Option B:

NN state: S=1, L'=0.

Pauli: 1+0=1 → okay.

l_X=1.

Parity: (-1)^0 * (-1)^1 = 1*(-1)= -1. Doesn't match. So parity violated. Not allowed.

Option C:

S=1, L'=2.

Pauli: 1+2=3 →1 mod2 → okay.

l_X=3.

Parity: (-1)^2 * (-1)^3= 1*(-1) =-1 → parity violated. Not allowed.

Option D:

NN state: S=1, L'=1.

Pauli: 1+1=2 →0 mod2. Doesn't satisfy the condition (needs 1). So Pauli condition violated. Plus, parity:

l_X=0.

Parity: (-1)^1 * (-1)^0= (-1)*1=-1 → parity violated. So this is invalid for both reasons.

So all options except one have parity violation. But looking at the options, let's see which one could have parity matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with one of the options.

Wait, let's recheck parity for each.

Option A: L'=2, l_X=1 → 2+1=3 → parity (-1)^3= -1. No.

Option B: L'=0, l=1 → 0+1=1 → (-1)^1 =-1. No.

Option C: L'=2, l=3 → 2+3=5 → (-1)^5= -1. No.

Option D: L'=1, l=0 →1+0=1 → (-1)^1= -1. No.

Wait a minute! So all options have parity not conserved. That can't be right, because the question says one is not allowed.

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the parity formula.

The parity of the final state is (-1)^{L'} * (-1)^{l_X}.

Wait, no. Because when the particle X is emitted, the system's orbital angular momentum is L' and X's orbital angular momentum is l.

But wait, the parity of the entire system is the product of the parity of the NN' state and the parity of X.

The parity of the NN' state is (-1)^L'. The parity of X is (-1)^l_X.

So the total parity is (-1)^L' * (-1)^l_X.

Which must equal the initial parity of +1.

So equation: (-1)^{L' + l_X} = 1 → L' + l_X must be even.

So for each option:

Option A: L' =2, l_X=1 → 3 → odd. No.

Option B: L'=0, l=1 →1 → odd. No.

Option C: L'=2, l=3 →5→ odd. No.

Option D: L'=1, l=0 →1→ odd. No.

Hmm, this suggests all options have L' + l_X odd, which would make the parity -1. But the initial parity is +1. So none would be allowed, which contradicts the question.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I determine l_X. Maybe the particle X's orbital angular momentum is not the same as the emitted l. Because X is emitted, perhaps its orbital angular momentum is considered in the relative motion of the NN pair.

Wait, another approach: when two particles (A and B) emit a third particle (X), the orbital angular momentum of X is the relative orbital angular momentum between the NN pair and X.

So the initial NN state has L=0. After emitting X, the NN pair has L' and X has l. The total angular momentum (which must be zero) is the sum of NN's J' and X's j. But this might not directly help with parity.

Wait, perhaps the parity of the NN' state is (-1)^L', and the parity of X is (-1)^l_X. So the total parity is their product, which must equal the initial parity (+1).

So (-1)^{L'} * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L' + l_X} =1 → L' + l_X must be even.

So for each option:

A: L'=2; l_X=1 → 3 → odd. No.

B: L'=0; l=1 →1 → odd. No.

C: L'=2; l=3 →5 → odd. No.

D: L'=1; l=0 →1→ odd. No.

So all options have L' + l_X odd, which can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial state.

Wait, the initial state is 1S0, which means L=0, S=0, J=0. So the parity is (-1)^0= +1. So the parity of the initial state is +1.

So for the options to be allowed, their parity must be +1. Hence, their L' + l_X must be even.

But looking at the options, none of them have L' + l_X even. So all options would violate parity, but the question states that one is not permitted. Therefore, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the emitted particle X's parity is considered as part of the NN system. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I've misapplied the parity calculation.

Wait, perhaps the parity of the entire system is the product of parities of each part. So the parity of the NN' state is (-1)^L', and the parity of X is (-1)^{l_X}.

So the total parity is (-1)^{L'} * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L' + l_X}.

This must be equal to the initial parity of +1. So L' + l_X must be even.

So for each option:

Option A: L'=2, l_X=1 → 3 → odd → parity is -1. No.

Option B: L'=0, l=1 →1 → odd. No.

Option C: L'=2, l=3 →5→ odd. No.

Option D: L'=1, l=0 →1→ odd. No.

Hmm, all options have parity not conserved. So perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, what if the particle X is in a state with orbital angular momentum l, but the parity also includes the spin of X? No, parity is purely a function of orbital angular momentum, not spin.

Another thought: perhaps the emitted X carries away angular momentum, but the orbital angular momentum of X is part of the NN system.

Wait, perhaps the parity of the entire system (NN' and X) is the product of their individual parities. But the initial system (just NN) has parity (+1). The final system has NN' and X. So their combined parity must be (+1)*[parity of NN'] * [parity of X].

Wait, no, the combined parity is the product of their individual parities. So the initial parity is +1. The final parity is [parity of NN'] * [parity of X] = (-1)^{L'} * (-1)^{l_X} = (-1)^{L' + l_X}.

Which must equal +1. So L' + l_X must be even.

But all the options have L' + l_X odd. So none would be allowed? That can't be right because the question says one is not permitted. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the initial state's parity is not just (-1)^L. Because when the initial state is 1S0, which is (2S+1)L(J) → S=0, L=0, so parity is (-1)^0= +1. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating l_X for each option. Let me check what each option's particle corresponds to:

Looking at the options:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p.

p is the letter for orbital angular momentum l=1. So l_X=1.

B) 1S0 →3S1 + p. l=1.

C) 1S0 →3D3 +f. f is l=3.

D) 1S0 →3P0 + s. s is l=0.

So that's correct. So for each option, l_X is as I thought.

Wait, but what about the spin of X? Does that affect parity? No, because parity is determined by orbital angular momentum.

So perhaps I'm stuck. All options have parity violation, but the question says only one is not permitted. So perhaps I should reevaluate the Pauli condition.

The Pauli condition is T = S + L + 1 mod2. So for the final NN state, T=0.

So 0 = S' + L' +1 mod2 → S' + L' =1 mod2.

So S' and L' must be of opposite parity.

So for each option:

Option A: S'=3, L'=2 →3+2=5 →1 mod2 → yes.

Option B: S'=1, L'=0 →1 → yes.

Option C: S'=1, L'=2 →3 →1 mod2 → yes.

Option D: S'=1, L'=1 →2 →0 mod2 → no. So Pauli condition not met.

So option D violates the Pauli condition, but also the parity condition.

But the question is about which partial wave is not permitted, considering both conditions.

So for each option, I need to check both conditions.

Let me list:

Option A:

Pauli: yes.

Parity: no.

So not allowed.

Option B:

Pauli: yes.

Parity: no.

Not allowed.

Option C:

Pauli: yes.

Parity: no.

Not allowed.

Option D:

Pauli: no.

Parity: no.

Not allowed.

Wait, but this suggests all options are not permitted. Which can't be right. So perhaps I made an error in the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps for option D, the parity is:

L'=1 (for NN'), l_X=0.

So L' + l_X=1. So (-1)^1 =-1. Which doesn't match initial parity.

But perhaps the parity is calculated differently. For example, maybe the orbital angular momentum of X is reversed?

Alternatively, perhaps X's orbital angular momentum is considered opposite to that in the NN' state. Hmm, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm considering the wrong parity for X.

Wait, the problem says that X has intrinsic parity -1. So the parity of X is -1. So regardless of its orbital angular momentum, its parity is -1. Because parity includes the orbital part and any intrinsic parity.

Wait, no. Parity is a product of the orbital part and the intrinsic parity. So the intrinsic parity of X is given as -1. So the parity of X is (-1)^l_X * intrinsic_parity.

So the parity of X is (-1)^l_X * (-1) = (-1)^(l_X +1).

Wait, that's a different way to look at it. So the parity of X is (-1)^(l_X +1).

So when combining, the total parity is:

parity_NN' * parity_X = [ (-1)^L' ] * [ (-1)^{l_X +1} ] = (-1)^{L' + l_X +1}.

This must equal the initial parity of +1.

So (-1)^{L' + l_X +1} =1 → L' + l_X +1 must be even → L' + l_X must be odd.

Ah! So I think I made a mistake earlier. X's parity isn't just (-1)^l_X, it's (-1)^l_X multiplied by its intrinsic parity, which is -1. So the parity of X is (-1)^l_X * (-1) = (-1)^{l_X +1}.

So the total parity after emission is (-1)^{L'} * (-1)^{l_X +1} = (-1)^{L' + l_X +1}.

Setting this equal to initial parity of +1:

(-1)^{L' + l_X +1} =1 → exponent must be even → L' + l_X +1 = even → L' + l_X must be odd.

So now, the condition is L' + l_X is odd.

So let's recheck each option.

Option A: L'=2, l_X=1 → 2+1=3 → odd. So condition met.

Parity: (-1)^{3+1} = (-1)^4=1. So yes, parity conserved. So option A is allowed.

Option B: L'=0, l_X=1 →0+1=1→ odd. So condition met.

Parity: (-1)^{0+1 +1}= (-1)^2=1. So yes. So option B is allowed.

Wait, wait. Let me calculate this correctly.

Wait, the total parity after emission is (-1)^{L' + l_X +1}.

So for option A:

L' + l_X +1 = 2+1+1=4 → (-1)^4=1 → okay.

Option B:

0+1+1=2 → (-1)^2=1 → okay.

Option C:

L'=2, l_X=3 →2+3+1=6 → (-1)^6=1 → okay.

Option D:

L'=1, l_X=0 →1+0+1=2 → (-1)^2=1→ okay.

So all options have parity conserved. Wait, but this is the opposite of what I thought earlier. So I must have made a mistake in the initial parity calculation.

Wait, the key was that the parity of X is (-1)^l_X multiplied by its intrinsic parity. So the total parity is [ (-1)^L' ] * [ (-1)^l_X * (-1) ] = (-1)^{L' + l_X +1}.

So for each option:

Option A: L'=2, l=1. 2+1+1=4 → even → parity +1. Correct.

Option B: L'=0, l=1. 0+1+1=2 → even → parity +1. Correct.

Option C: L'=2, l=3 →2+3+1=6 → even → parity +1. Correct.

Option D: L'=1, l=0 →1+0+1=2 → even → parity +1. Correct.

So parity is conserved in all options.

But what about the Pauli condition?

The Pauli condition is T= S' + L' +1 mod2.

T=0 → S' + L' +1 must be even → S' + L' must be odd.

So checking each option.

Option A: S'=3, L'=2 →3+2=5 → odd → condition met.

Option B: S'=1, L'=0 →1+0=1 → odd → condition met.

Option C: S'=1, L'=2 →3 → odd → condition met.

Option D: S'=1, L'=1 →2 → even → condition not met.

So the only option that violates the Pauli condition is option D.

But the question is which partial wave is not permitted, considering both angular momentum and parity conservation.

Wait, but all options have parity conserved, but some have Pauli condition not met. So the problem says which partial wave is not permitted.

In the question, the options are about the emitted particle's partial wave (l of X). So for each option, the partial wave is l=1(p), l=1(p), l=3(f), l=0(s).

But the Pauli condition is about the NN' state's S and L. So the question is, which option violates either the parity or the Pauli condition.

But in the initial analysis, all options have parity conserved. So the only option that violates any condition is option D, which violates the Pauli condition.

Wait, but the problem says the question is about which partial wave is not permitted, considering both conservation of angular momentum and parity.

In this case, all options have parity conserved. So the Pauli condition is the only consideration. So the only option that violates the Pauli condition is option D, which has S'=1, L'=1 → sum even, which violates T=0.

So the partial wave in option D is s (l=0). So that's the one not permitted.

Wait, but the question says which partial wave is not permitted. So the one that doesn't satisfy the Pauli condition.

So the answer is option D.


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the problem using the given conditions:

1. **Initial State**: The NN system is in the 1S0 state, which corresponds to \( S = 0 \), \( L = 0 \), and \( J = 0 \). The parity of the initial state is \( (-1)^L = (-1)^0 = +1 \).

2. **Final State**: After emitting a particle \( X \), the NN system transitions to a new state with quantum numbers \( S' \), \( L' \), and \( J' \). The emitted particle \( X \) has an intrinsic parity of \( -1 \) and an orbital angular momentum \( l_X \). The total parity of the system after emission must conserve parity, and the Pauli condition \( T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \) must also be satisfied.

3. **Parity Conservation**: The total parity after emission is given by:
   \[
   (-1)^{L'} \cdot (-1)^{l_X + 1} = (-1)^{L' + l_X + 1}.
   \]
   This must equal the initial parity of \( +1 \), so:
   \[
   (-1)^{L' + l_X + 1} = 1 \implies L' + l_X + 1 \text{ is even} \implies L' + l_X \text{ is odd}.
   \]

4. **Pauli Condition**: Since \( T(NN) = 0 \), the condition becomes:
   \[
   0 = S' + L' + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2) \implies S' + L' \text{ is odd}.
   \]
