Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about molecular energy states and photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a diatomic molecule, made of atoms X and Y. They're using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is a more accurate model than the simple rigid rotor because it accounts for some flexibility in the bond. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, the fundamental state is the ground state, right? So, in terms of energy levels, the molecule can have various vibrational and rotational energy states. For the quantum rotation-vibration model, I think the energy levels are a combination of both vibrations and rotations. But wait, the question says it's the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, no, I think the non-rigid rotor is a different model, perhaps the vibration is considered as part of the rotation? Or maybe it's the Morse potential for vibrations combined with rotational motion.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The question specifies the quantum rotation-vibration model, which probably treats the molecule as having both vibrational and rotational energy states. So the energy levels are a combination of both.

The molecule is in the fundamental state. So that would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0 or maybe J=1? Wait, for a diatomic, the rotational states start at J=0? Or is it J=1? Wait, no, I think J can be zero, but for a diatomic with a certain symmetry, maybe J=0 is allowed. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Wait, for a rigid rotor, the energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. So J starts at 0, but for a diatomic, maybe J=0 is allowed.

Wait, but the question refers to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can transition to the next energy state. Now, since energy states are quantized, the photon needs to provide the exact energy difference between the initial and final states.

But what's the initial state? If the molecule is in the fundamental state, that's v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be either increasing J or increasing v. But which transition would require the least energy?

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) h ν, where ν is the vibrational frequency. The rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1). The total energy is the sum of these.

In the ground state, v=0, so E_vib = (1/2) h ν. For J=0, E_rot = 0. So the next possible state could be either v=1 (so (3/2) h ν) with J=0, or J=1 with v=0 (so (1/2) h ν + B * 1 * 2 = (1/2) h ν + 2B). Which of these two has a lower energy difference?

Wait, the energy difference for v=1 from v=0 is h ν. For J=1 from J=0, it's 2B. So which is smaller? That depends on the values of ν and B.

Given the data: R (bond length) is 2 angstroms. The angular frequency, ω, is 4e14 rad/s. The masses are Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu.

Wait, the moment of inertia I for a diatomic is I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass. So the rotational constant B is ħ²/(2 I), but I think in terms of B, it's usually expressed as B = h/(8π² c I), but wait, no, that's for microwave transitions when considering energy in terms of cm⁻¹. Alternatively, the rotational energy is given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is in cm⁻¹. But perhaps I'm getting the units confused.

Wait, another approach. Let me recall that the rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia I by B = ħ² / (2 I k), where k is the Boltzmann constant? Or maybe B is h/(8 π² c I), I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I should calculate the vibrational and rotational energies to see which transition (v=1 or J=1) requires less energy.

Wait, the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. So that would be v=0 and J=0. The next possible transition would be to either v=1 (which would have higher energy) or J=1 (which also has higher energy). But which of these transitions requires a lower energy photon? Because the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy, implying the smallest possible energy jump.

So the idea is to compute the energy difference between the initial state (v=0, J=0) and the two possible next states: (v=1, J=0) and (v=0, J=1), and see which one has a smaller ΔE. Then, the photon's energy must match the smaller ΔE.

Alternatively, maybe the next state is a combination of both, but I think in the quantum model, transitions are either vibrational or rotational, but perhaps the problem wants the minimal energy. So I need to compute ΔE for both possibilities.

So first, let me compute the vibrational energy difference. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) h ω. So from v=0 to v=1, the energy change is (1 + 1/2 - 0 - 1/2) h ω = h ω. So ΔE_vib = h ω.

Next, the rotational energy. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J +1). For J=0 to J=1, the energy change is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = B * 1 * 2 - 0 = 2 B. So ΔE_rot = 2 B.

Which of these is smaller? So I need to compute both and compare.

To compute B, I need the moment of inertia I. The moment of inertia I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass of the two atoms.

The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Let's compute that.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, we need to convert that into kilograms for SI units. Because the moment of inertia is in kg·m².

1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (22) amu → 20/11 amu → 20/(11) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Wait, 20/(11) is approximately 1.818. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me calculate that: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = ?

Well, 1.8 * 1.6605 = approx 2.9889, so 2.9889e-27 kg. But maybe I should be more precise.

Alternatively, I can compute 20/(22) = 10/11 ≈ 0.9091. So 0.9091 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

0.9091 * 1.6605e-27 = approximately 1.508e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, 10/11 is about 0.90909. So 0.90909 * 1.6605e-27.

Let me compute 0.90909 * 1.6605 = 1.508 (exactly: 0.90909 * 1.6605)

0.90909 * 1.6605 = Let's compute 90909 * 16605 = but that's too detailed. Alternatively, using calculator:

0.90909 * 1.6605 ≈ 1.508.

So μ ≈ 1.508e-27 kg.

Now, the bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = (1.508e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Calculating (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

I = 1.508e-27 * 4e-20 = 6.032e-47 kg·m².

Now, the rotational constant B is given by B = ħ²/(2 I), where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, no. Let me think. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), and B is given by (h²)/(8 π² I), but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look up the formula.

In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_J = (h²/(8 π² I)) J (J + 1). So B is h²/(8 π² I). So B = (h/(2 π))² / (8 π² I) )? Wait, perhaps better to write it as B = (h²)/(8 π² I).

Alternatively, sometimes B is expressed in terms of frequency in wavenumbers (cm⁻¹), but perhaps for this problem, we can compute B in joules.

So let's compute B.

h is Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

I is 6.032e-47 kg·m².

So B = (h^2) / (8 π² I)

Plugging in the numbers:

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J²·s².

8 π² ≈ 8 * (9.8696) ≈ 78.9568.

So denominator: 8 π² I = 78.9568 * 6.032e-47 ≈ 78.9568 * 6.032e-47.

Wait, 78.9568 * 6 ≈ 473.74, 78.9568 * 6.032 ≈ let's compute:

6.032e-47 * 78.9568:

Wait, 6.032 * 78.9568 ≈ 6 * 78 = 468, 0.032 *78≈ 2.5, so around 470.5. So 470.5e-47 → 4.705e-45.

So denominator is ≈4.705e-45.

So B ≈ (4.39e-67) / (4.705e-45) ) ≈ (4.39 /4.705) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.932e-22 ≈ 9.32e-23 J.

Wait, let me compute 4.39e-67 / 4.705e-45. 

That's (4.39 / 4.705) ) * 1e-67+45 → 0.932 * 1e-22 → 9.32e-23 J.

So each rotational level E_J is B * J (J+1). So from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is 2B.

So ΔE_rot = 2B = 2 * 9.32e-23 J ≈ 1.864e-22 J.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute B in terms of angular frequency. Hmm, maybe that's a better approach. Wait, the rotational energy is quantized, and the transition between states relates to the photon's energy.

Wait, but the vibrational frequency is given as ω = 4e14 rad/s. So the vibrational energy difference is h ω.

So let's compute ΔE_vib = h ω.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s. ω is 4e14 rad/s.

h ω = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

So ΔE_vib is 2.65e-19 J.

Now, the rotational energy difference is 1.86e-22 J.

Which is smaller: 1.86e-22 J is much smaller than 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition would require a much lower energy photon.

Wait, but wait a minute. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. The next higher state is either J=1 or v=1. Since the ΔE_rot is about 1.86e-22 J and ΔE_vib is about 2.65e-19 J, the rotational transition requires less energy. But wait, the question says to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule would preferentially absorb the photon that causes the smallest energy jump. Therefore, the photon would need to have energy equal to ΔE_rot, which is the smaller of the two.

Wait, but wait another thing: the question says, 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.' That implies the next state should have the smallest possible increase in energy. So between the two options (v=1, J=0 and J=1, v=0), which requires a smaller photon energy? The rotational transition requires much less energy, so that's the one.

But wait, what about the possibility of a transition that involves both a vibrational and rotational change? Like, for example, a photon could cause a transition to a state where both v and J change. But I think in the rigid rotor model, transitions can only change either v or J, but not both. Or wait, no, that's for selection rules. For example, in rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1, and for vibrational transitions, Δv = ±1. But in the problem statement, it's about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy, which I think is the first excited state, which is the one with the minimal increase in energy.

So, the photon must provide energy ΔE = lower of ΔE_rot and ΔE_vib. In this case, ΔE_rot is smaller.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next possible states are J=1 and v=1. But is v=1 with J=0 lower in energy than J=1 with v=0?

Let's compute both.

E_J=0 v=1: (1 + 1/2) h ω = (3/2) h ω.

E_J=1 v=0: (0 + 1/2) h ω + B * 1 * 2 = (1/2 h ω) + 2 B.

Which is lower?

We have E1 = (3/2) h ω and E2 = (1/2) h ω + 2B.

Compute both:

E1 = (3/2) * 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = (3/2) * 2.65e-19 = 3.975e-19 J.

E2 = (0.5 * 6.626e-34 *4e14 ) + 2 * 9.32e-23.

Compute each term:

0.5 * 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 0.5 * 2.65e-19 = 1.325e-19 J.

2 * 9.32e-23 = 1.864e-22 J.

So E2 = 1.325e-19 + 1.864e-22 ≈ 1.325e-19 J (since 1.86e-22 is much smaller than 1.325e-19).

So E2 is approximately 1.325e-19 J, which is less than E1 (3.975e-19 J). So the state with J=1 and v=0 has lower energy than the state with J=0 and v=1.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because for E2, the rotational part is only adding 2B, which is 1.86e-22 J, but the vibrational part is (1/2) h ω which is 1.325e-19 J. So E2 is 1.325e-19 + 1.86e-22 ≈ 1.325e-19 J. Meanwhile, E1 is 3.975e-19 J. So E2 is lower. So the next state with the lowest energy is J=1, v=0.

Wait, but wait, that can't be because the molecule is in the ground state with J=0, v=0. So the next states would be J=0, v=1 or J=1, v=0. The energies are E1 = 3/2 h ω and E2 = 1/2 h ω + 2B.

Which one is lower? Let's compute numerically.

We have h ω ≈ 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So E1 = 3/2 * 2.65e-19 ≈ 3.975e-19 J.

E2 = (1/2 * 2.65e-19) + 1.86e-22 ≈ 1.325e-19 + 0.000186e-19 ≈ 1.325e-19 J.

So E2 is much lower than E1. Therefore, the state J=1, v=0 is lower in energy than J=0, v=1. So the next state with the lowest possible energy is J=1, v=0.

Wait, but how does that make sense? Because the vibrational energy is much larger than the rotational energy. So E2 is in the vibrational ground state (v=0) but with J=1, which is a bit higher in energy than v=0, J=0. But E2 is 1.325e-19 J, while E1 is 3.975e-19 J.

Wait, but the initial state is v=0, J=0. So the energy of the initial state is E_initial = (1/2) h ω + 0 = 1.325e-19 J.

Wait no, wait: the initial state is v=0, J=0. So the initial energy is (0 + 1/2) h ω + 0 = 1/2 h ω = 1.325e-19 J.

The state J=1, v=0 has E = (1/2) h ω + 2B ≈ 1.325e-19 + 1.86e-22 ≈ 1.325e-19 J. So the energy is higher than the initial state by 1.86e-22 J.

The state J=0, v=1 has E = (1 + 1/2) h ω = 3/2 h ω ≈ 3.975e-19 J, which is much higher.

So the next state with the lowest energy is J=1, v=0. So the energy required for the transition is 1.86e-22 J.

But wait, the question is about the photon's momentum. Because energy is related to photon momentum via E = p c, where p is the momentum and c is the speed of light.

So the momentum p would be E divided by c.

Wait, E = p c → p = E / c.

So E is 1.86e-22 J.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (1.86e-22 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (1.86e-22) / 3e8 = 6.2e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but let me compute that again.

1.86e-22 / 3e8 = (1.86 / 3) * 1e-30 = 0.62 * 1e-30 = 6.2e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are close to 6.2e-31. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns
B) 2.3e-27 Ns
C) 1.1e-27 Ns
D) 1.4e-28 Ns.

Wait, Ns is equivalent to kg·m/s, since N = kg·m/s². So 1 Ns = 1 kg·m/s.

So 6.2e-31 kg·m/s is 6.2e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are in that ballpark. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps the error is in the assumption that the next state is J=1, v=0. Because the energy of J=1, v=0 is higher than the initial state by 1.86e-22 J, but perhaps the question allows for transitioning to the next state regardless of whether it's vibrational or rotational, but the minimal energy required. Alternatively, perhaps I've confused the energy levels.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the model being used is the non-rigid rotor, but in this model, the vibrational energy is incorporated into the rotational model. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering only the rotational transition, and the vibrational part is neglected.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is treated as a non-rigid rotor, which accounts for bond vibrations, and the energy levels are a combination of both. But I'm not sure, so perhaps I should think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition. But the photon's energy must match the lower of the two possible transitions.

Wait, but earlier, when I computed the energy of the J=1 state, the energy change was 1.86e-22 J, which is much smaller than the vibrational transition's 2.65e-19 J. So the photon's energy would need to be around 1.86e-22 J.

But the options are all in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. So my calculation must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B.

Let me recalculate B.

B = h²/(8 π² I)

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

I = μ R²

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Converting μ to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = (20/11) * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ (1.818) * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, this is different from what I thought earlier. So earlier I thought μ was 1.5e-27 kg, but that's incorrect. Let me recompute.

Ah, I see where I messed up earlier. I think I miscalculated μ.

Because Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 20 + 2 is 22. So 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. So μ = 1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

Oh, I see. Earlier, I thought μ was around 1.5e-27 kg, but that's wrong. It should be 3.017e-27 kg.

Now, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ R² = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

So I = 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

Now, B = h²/(8 π² I).

Compute h²: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J²s².

8 π² ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

So denominator 8 π² I = 78.9568 * 1.2068e-46 ≈ let's compute 78.9568 * 1.2068e-46.

78.9568 * 1.2068 ≈ 78 * 1.2 = 93.6, but precise calculation:

78.9568 * 1.2068 ≈ ?

Let me approximate:

78.9568 * 1.2 = 94.748

78.9568 * 0.0068 ≈ 0.537

Total ≈ 95.285.

So 95.285e-46 → 9.5285e-45.

So denominator is 9.5285e-45.

B = (4.39e-67) / (9.5285e-45) ) = (4.39 /9.5285) ) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.4606 * 1e-22 ≈ 4.606e-23 J.

So B ≈ 4.606e-23 J.

So the rotational energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is 2B = 9.212e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is h ω = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So 9.212e-23 J is much less than 2.65e-19 J.

So the photon must have energy E_photon = 9.212e-23 J.

Now, the momentum p is E_photon / c.

c = 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.212e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Which is 3.07e-31 Ns.

But looking at the options again:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns → 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27 → 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27 → 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28 → 1.4e-28.

Wait, 3.07e-31 Ns is way smaller than any of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the energy with the photon momentum. Because E = p c.

Wait, E = h f = p c → p = E/(c).

So my calculation of E was 9.212e-23 J, so p = 9.212e-23 / (3e8) = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options don't have anything near that. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, maybe the moment of inertia was miscalculated.

Wait, let me check the moment of inertia again.

I = μ R².

μ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = (3.017e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

Correct.

B = h²/(8 π² I) → (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 * π² * 1.2068e-46 )

Calculate numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 * (π^2) ≈ 78.96 → 78.96 * 1.2068e-46 ≈ 95.28e-46 → 9.528e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.528e-45 = approx 4.606e-23 J.

So from J=0 to J=1, ΔE = 2B = 9.212e-23 J.

E_photon = 9.212e-23 J.

p_photon = E_photon / c = 9.212e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

Hmm, but the options are much larger. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the model.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, which is higher in energy than the rotational state. But that would require a higher energy photon, which the options don't have either.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state regardless of whether it's vibrational or rotational, but the photon's energy must be the sum, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule is treated as a rigid rotor, and we're considering the fundamental rotational state (J=1) and the vibrational transition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the model considered here is the non-rigid rotor, which allows the bond to stretch, and the energy levels are a combination of both.

Wait, but I'm not familiar enough with that. Maybe I should think in terms of the energy of the photon matching the energy of the transition.

Wait, alternative approach: Perhaps the photon's energy must match the fundamental vibrational state, which is the first possible state, but then how does that fit with the rotational energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition, and the rotational state is ignored, but that doesn't make sense because the problem mentions the rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the energy levels. Maybe the molecule is in the ground vibrational state but the ground rotational state (J=0), and the next state is J=1, which is a rotational transition. So the photon's energy is 2B.

But earlier, when I computed B correctly, the momentum comes out to be 3.07e-31 Ns, which isn't an option.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. The problem gives the angular frequency ω of vibration as 4e14 rad/s. So the vibrational energy difference is h ω = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

If the photon's energy is this, then the momentum p = E/c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-30 kg·m/s = 8.83e-30 Ns.

Still, this isn't matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule's transition to the next state, which is the first excited vibrational state, and the photon's energy is h ω. So the momentum is h ω / c.

But that would be (6.626e-34 *4e14) / 3e8 = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-30 Ns.

But again, not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the first vibrational state and the first rotational state, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy using the reduced mass and bond length to find the vibrational frequency, but that's another approach.

Wait, the vibrational frequency ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. So the energy difference for a vibrational transition is h ω, as I computed earlier.

But perhaps the question is asking about the transition when the molecule absorbs a photon that causes it to move to the next vibrational state, which would require a higher energy, but the options don't have such a high value.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state with the next higher energy, which is J=1, v=0, which requires a photon with energy 2B. But that gives us a momentum of 3.07e-31 Ns, which is not one of the options.

So perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns.

Wait, these are all on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28, which is three orders of magnitude larger than what I calculated.

Hmm. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, B is h^2/(8 pi^2 I).

But h is 6.626e-34 J s. So h^2 is (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 J^2 s^2.

I is 1.2068e-46 kg m^2.

So 8 pi^2 I is 8 * (9.8696) * 1.2068e-46 = approx 8 * 10 * 1.2e-46 = 9.6e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.6e-45 = approx 4.57e-23 J.

So 2B = 9.14e-23 J.

E_photon = 9.14e-23 J.

p = E_photon / c = 9.14e-23 / 3e8 = 3.05e-31 Ns.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for B.

Another approach: The rotational constant B is often expressed in terms of cm⁻¹. The formula for B is (h/(8 pi^2 c I)).

Wait, wait, perhaps that's the case. Let me think: the rotational energy levels can be expressed in terms of wavenumbers (cm⁻¹) as E_J = B J (J+1), where B is in cm⁻¹.

So B (cm⁻¹) = h/(8 pi^2 c I).

So then, B (in cm⁻¹) = (6.626e-34 J s) / (8 * pi^2 * 3e8 m/s * I).

Wait, but I is in kg m². So let me compute B in cm⁻¹.

Let me compute B using this formula.

Compute denominator: 8 * pi^2 * c * I.

c = 3e8 m/s.

I = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

So 8 pi^2 = 78.9568.

So denominator = 78.9568 * 3e8 m/s * 1.2068e-46 kg m².

Calculate denominator:

78.9568 *3e8 = 2.3687e10.

Multiply by 1.2068e-46: 2.3687e10 * 1.2068e-46 = 2.86e-36.

So denominator is 2.86e-36.

B (cm⁻¹) = 6.626e-34 / 2.86e-36 = approx 2317 cm⁻¹.

Hmm, but how does that help? Because I'm trying to find the energy difference in Joules.

Wait, when B is in cm⁻¹, the energy E_J (in Joules) would be E = B (cm⁻¹) * h c.

Because 1 cm⁻¹ corresponds to h c ergs, or h c * 1e7 ergs/J? Wait, perhaps better to compute it.

E_J = B (cm⁻¹) * h c.

But wait, h c is 1240 eV·nm ≈ 1.24e-4 J·m.

Wait, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 1240 eV·nm = 1240 * 1.602e-19 J * 1e-9 m = 2.0e-25 J·m.

Wait, but E_J = B (cm⁻¹) * h c.

Wait, cm⁻¹ is 1/cm = 100 m⁻¹.

So E_J = B (m⁻¹) * h c.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me compute B in m⁻¹.

Wait, 1 cm⁻¹ = 100 m⁻¹.

So B = 2317 cm⁻¹ = 2317 * 100 m⁻¹ = 2.317e5 m⁻¹.

Then, E_J = B * h c.

h c = 6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So E_J = 2.317e5 m⁻¹ * 1.9878e-25 J·m = 2.317e5 * 1.9878e-25 J ≈ 4.61e-20 J.

But wait, that's the energy for J=1, which would be E= B J (J+1) = 2.317e5 cm⁻¹ * hc.

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting me nowhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that I'm not getting the correct option and think about what I'm missing.

Wait a moment. Oh! Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state usually refers to the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state, which is either J=1 (rotational) or v=1 (vibrational). But from earlier calculations, the rotational transition requires much less energy.

But the problem is that the options don't match the calculated momentum. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia.

Wait, perhaps I should use the reduced mass in atomic mass units. Let me think again: the moment of inertia I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass in kg, and R is in meters.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in converting amu to kg.

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) * 1 amu = (40/22) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818.

So 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approximately 3.017e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

So B = h²/(8 pi² I) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 pi² *1.2068e-46).

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 8 pi² *1.2068e-46 = 78.9568 * 1.2068e-46 ≈ 95.28e-46 = 9.528e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.528e-45 ≈ 4.606e-23 J.

So the rotational energy difference is 2B = 9.212e-23 J.

E_photon = 9.212e-23 J.

p_photon = E/c = 9.212e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Which is 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options don't match this. So perhaps I'm miscalculating B.

Wait, another approach. Let's compute B in terms of angular frequency for rotation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of frequency.

Wait, another formula: for a rigid rotor, the energy levels are E_J = ħ ω_r J (J+1), where ω_r is the rotational angular frequency.

So ω_r = sqrt( k / (μ R²) ), but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, ω_r is related to the moment of inertia: I = μ R² = ħ²/(m ω_r²), where m is some factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the rotational angular frequency ω_r:

ω_r = sqrt( (k)/(I) ), but I don't have the value of k (force constant) here. Alternatively, perhaps knowing that the rotational energy is quantized, and the spacing between J levels is 2B per J step.

But perhaps I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting me to calculate the momentum based on the vibrational transition, not the rotational one. Let's try that.

E_photon_vibrational = h ω =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p_photon = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-30 Ns.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, maybe the question has a typo, and the answer is not among the options. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, maybe the photon's energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy differences.

But that would be 2B + h ω = 9.2e-23 + 2.65e-19 = approx 2.65e-19 J, which brings us back to the same problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state as the first excited vibrational state, but that would require a much higher energy, which doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), and the next state is the first vibrational excited state (v=1, J=0), which requires a photon with energy h ω. But the momentum is 8.83e-30 Ns, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for the bond length. The bond length is given as 2 angstroms. Did I use that correctly?

Yes, R = 2e-10 meters.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Let me try to see if any of the options match the calculated value of 3.07e-31 Ns. But none of the options are anywhere near that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recheck.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared is 6.626e-34 *6.626e-34 = (6.626)^2 * 1e-68 → 43.9 * 1e-68 → 4.39e-67 J² s².

I = μ R² = (3.017e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

8 pi^2 = 78.9568.

So denominator = 78.9568 *1.2068e-46 = 95.28e-46 = 9.528e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 /9.528e-45 = approx 4.606e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct.

Another thought: perhaps the question is asking about the transition to the next state with the lowest energy, which is the first excited vibrational state, and the rotational state is considered as well, but I think that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the transition where both J and v change. But that's probably not allowed by selection rules.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a diatomic molecule where the rotational state J=0 isn't allowed, so the next state is J=1, which would require a photon with energy 2B.

But again, the momentum comes to 3.07e-31 Ns.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me compute B again.

Wait, I have I = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

So h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

8 pi² I = 78.9568 * 1.2068e-46 = 95.28e-46 = 9.528e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.528e-45 = 4.606e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct.

So the photon's energy is 9.212e-23 J.

Momentum p = E / c = 9.212e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Hmm, perhaps the options have a typo and the correct answer is not present. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the denominator.

Wait, 8 pi^2 I = 78.9568 * I.

I is 1.2068e-46.

So 78.9568 * 1.2068e-46 = 78.9568 *1.2068 = approx 95.28, so 95.28e-46 → 9.528e-45.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state with the next higher energy, which is the vibrational state, and the rotational state is not considered. But that doesn't make sense because the rotational transition requires less energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which requires a photon of energy h ω. But as calculated earlier, that gives a momentum of 8.83e-30 Ns, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the molecule being modeled by the non-rigid rotor model, which combines both vibrations and rotations, and the energy levels are a combination. But I don't know the exact formula for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula for the vibrational energy, and the rotational part is ignored. But then, the photon's momentum would be 8.83e-30 Ns, which is still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the bond length in picometers instead of angstroms? No, the bond length is given as 2 angstroms, which is 200 pm. So R is 2e-10 m.

Hmm. Perhaps the answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: the reduced mass μ is (Mx My)/(Mx + My). But Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But perhaps I should have used the sum of the atomic masses instead of the reduced mass? No, because I is μ R², and μ is indeed the reduced mass.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the moment of inertia using the individual masses, not the reduced mass. But that's incorrect.

Wait, no, the moment of inertia for a diatomic is definitely μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I'll have to go with the calculation and see if any of the options are close to 3.07e-31 Ns. But none of them are. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the 'fundamental state' refers to the first vibrational state, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the first state beyond the ground state, which is the next available state, regardless of being rotational or vibrational.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state as the first vibrational state, which requires a higher energy, but that would require a photon with momentum around 8.83e-30 Ns, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the transition to the next state with the lowest energy, which is the rotational state, but the calculation doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps I should try computing the momentum for the vibrational transition again.

E_photon = h ω = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p_photon = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-30 Ns.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, looking at the options, the smallest option is D) 1.4e-28 Ns, which is four orders of magnitude larger than my calculated 3e-31.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that the question refers to the transition to the next vibrational and rotational state combined, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different model or different constants.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy difference is given by the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy differences. But that's unlikely because that would be a higher energy transition.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state as the first allowed state, which is the first vibrational state, and the rotational transition is not allowed due to selection rules. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the rotational constant B in terms of wavenumbers (cm⁻¹) and then converting that to energy.

Wait, earlier, I calculated B in cm⁻¹ as approximately 2317 cm⁻¹.

So the energy for J=1 would be E = B * hc.

h c = 1240 eV nm → 1240 * 1e7 erg → but perhaps better to compute E in Joules.

E = 2317 cm⁻¹ * h c.

h c = 6.626e-34 J s * 3e8 m/s = 1.9878e-25 J m.

But 1 cm⁻¹ corresponds to h c * 1 cm = 1.9878e-25 J m * 0.01 m = 1.9878e-27 J.

So E = 2317 cm⁻¹ * 1.9878e-27 J = 2317 * 1.9878e-27 ≈ 4.61e-24 J.

So the energy difference for J=1 would be 4.61e-24 J.

p_photon = E / c = 4.61e-24 /3e8 = 1.537e-32 kg m/s.

Still, that's not matching any options.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option C) 1.1e-27 Ns. But how?

Wait, let's compute the momentum p for the rotational transition again.

E = 2B = 9.212e-23 J.

p = E / c = 9.212e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different value for Planck's constant, like h=6.62e-34 instead of 6.626e-34. Let me try that.

h=6.62e-34.

Then, E_photon = 2B = (6.62e-34)^2/(8 pi² I) * 2.

Wait, but that would still give a result close to 3e-31 Ns.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a different approach, such as the photon's momentum being related to the change in angular momentum. But that's not the case because photon momentum is E/c.

Another thought: perhaps I should have used the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational frequency ω. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula p = h/(2 pi) for the photon's momentum, but that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering relativistic effects, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the photon's momentum as the change in the molecule's angular momentum. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the question is expecting the photon's momentum to be the same as the rotational energy divided by c, but I think that's what I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the momentum is calculated using the reduced mass and bond length for the vibrational energy, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the vibrational energy is (1/2) h ω for the ground state. The next state would be v=1, which is (3/2) h ω. So the energy difference is h ω.

So E_photon = h ω =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p_photon = 2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-30 Ns.

Still not matching any options.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should pick the closest option, but I don't see any that are close to 3e-31 or 8e-30. Since all options are larger than my calculated values, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Let me compute B again.

B = h²/(8 pi² I).

h =6.626e-34.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

8 pi² I = 8 * (pi^2) * I.

I =1.2068e-46 kg m².

So 8 pi² I = 8 * (9.8696) * 1.2068e-46 = 78.9568 *1.2068e-46 = 95.28e-46 =9.528e-45.

So B =4.39e-67 /9.528e-45 =4.606e-23 J.

Yes, correct.

So, I think the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the question's interpretation.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is v=0 and J=0. The next state could be either J=1 or v=1. The energy required for J=1 is 2B, which is much smaller than the vibrational transition. So the photon's energy is 2B, and the momentum is E/c.

But according to my calculations, the momentum is 3.07e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. So perhaps I should reevaluate the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the bond length R is given in angstroms, but I used it in meters. No, R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m, which is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model, which includes a vibrationally induced change in the bond length, thereby affecting the moment of inertia. But I'm not familiar enough with that model to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the photon to have the same momentum as the rotational energy difference divided by c, but I think that's what I did.

Given that none of the options match, I'm unsure. But perhaps the intended answer is option C) 1.1e-27 Ns, but I can't see how that would come about.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recompute B.

Wait, perhaps I should use the rotational constant B = h²/(8 pi² I c), but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps I should use B = ħ²/(2 I).

Wait, ħ is h/(2 pi). So ħ = 6.626e-34 / (2 pi) ≈ 1.054e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (1.054e-34)^2 ≈ 1.11e-68 J² s².

B = ħ²/(2 I) = 1.11e-68 / (2 *1.2068e-46) ) = 1.11e-68 / 2.4136e-46 ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

Same result as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Energy Levels**: The total energy of the molecule is the sum of vibrational and rotational energies:
   - Vibrational energy: \( E_{\text{vib}} = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \omega \)
   - Rotational energy: \( E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J+1) \), where \( B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} \) and \( I = \mu R^2 \) is the moment of inertia.

2. **Initial State**: The molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), with total energy:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} h \omega + 0 = \frac{1}{2} h \omega
   \]

3. **Next State**: The next state with the lowest energy is either:
   - \( v=1, J=0 \): Total energy \( E_{\text{vib}} = \frac{3}{2} h \omega \)
   - \( v=0, J=1 \): Total energy \( E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} h \omega + 2B \)

   The energy difference for these transitions is:
   - For \( v=1, J=0 \): \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega \)
   - For \( v=0, J=1 \): \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \)

4. **Comparison of Transitions**:
   - The vibrational energy difference is \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 4 \times 10^{14} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).
   - The rotational energy difference requires calculating \( B \). The reduced mass \( \mu \) is:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
     \]
     Converting to kilograms: \( \mu = 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \approx 3.017 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \).  
     The bond length \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), so:
     \[
     I = \mu R^2 = 3.017 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2068 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
     \]
     The rotational constant \( B \) is:
     \[
     B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 \cdot 1.2068 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.606 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]
     Thus, \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 9.212 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).

   Comparing \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \) and \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.212 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), the rotational transition requires significantly less energy.

5. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The photon's momentum is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \). For the rotational transition:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.212 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}
     \]
   - For the vibrational transition:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{Ns}
     \]

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about molecular energy states and photons. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is about a diatomic molecule, made of atoms X and Y. They're using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is a more accurate model than the simple rigid rotor because it accounts for some flexibility in the bond. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy.

Wait, the fundamental state is the ground state, right? So, in terms of energy levels, the molecule can have various vibrational and rotational energy states. For the quantum rotation-vibration model, I think the energy levels are a combination of both vibrations and rotations. But wait, the question says it's the non-rigid rotor model. Oh wait, no, I think the non-rigid rotor is a different model, perhaps the vibration is considered as part of the rotation? Or maybe it's the Morse potential for vibrations combined with rotational motion.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The question specifies the quantum rotation-vibration model, which probably treats the molecule as having both vibrational and rotational energy states. So the energy levels are a combination of both.

The molecule is in the fundamental state. So that would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0 or maybe J=1? Wait, for a diatomic, the rotational states start at J=0? Or is it J=1? Wait, no, I think J can be zero, but for a diatomic with a certain symmetry, maybe J=0 is allowed. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Wait, for a rigid rotor, the energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is the rotational constant. So J starts at 0, but for a diatomic, maybe J=0 is allowed.

Wait, but the question refers to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So when the molecule absorbs a photon, it can transition to the next energy state. Now, since energy states are quantized, the photon needs to provide the exact energy difference between the initial and final states.

But what's the initial state? If the molecule is in the fundamental state, that's v=0, J=0. The next state with the lowest energy would be either increasing J or increasing v. But which transition would require the least energy?

Wait, the vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_vib = (v + 1/2) h ν, where ν is the vibrational frequency. The rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1). The total energy is the sum of these.

In the ground state, v=0, so E_vib = (1/2) h ν. For J=0, E_rot = 0. So the next possible state could be either v=1 (so (3/2) h ν) with J=0, or J=1 with v=0 (so (1/2) h ν + B * 1 * 2 = (1/2) h ν + 2B). Which of these two has a lower energy difference?

Wait, the energy difference for v=1 from v=0 is h ν. For J=1 from J=0, it's 2B. So which is smaller? That depends on the values of ν and B.

Given the data: R (bond length) is 2 angstroms. The angular frequency, ω, is 4e14 rad/s. The masses are Mx = 20 amu and My = 2 amu.

Wait, the moment of inertia I for a diatomic is I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass. So the rotational constant B is ħ²/(2 I), but I think in terms of B, it's usually expressed as B = h/(8π² c I), but wait, no, that's for microwave transitions when considering energy in terms of cm⁻¹. Alternatively, the rotational energy is given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B is in cm⁻¹. But perhaps I'm getting the units confused.

Wait, another approach. Let me recall that the rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia I by B = ħ² / (2 I k), where k is the Boltzmann constant? Or maybe B is h/(8 π² c I), I'm not sure. Wait, perhaps I should calculate the vibrational and rotational energies to see which transition (v=1 or J=1) requires less energy.

Wait, the problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which is the lowest energy state. So that would be v=0 and J=0. The next possible transition would be to either v=1 (which would have higher energy) or J=1 (which also has higher energy). But which of these transitions requires a lower energy photon? Because the question says the next state with the lowest possible energy, implying the smallest possible energy jump.

So the idea is to compute the energy difference between the initial state (v=0, J=0) and the two possible next states: (v=1, J=0) and (v=0, J=1), and see which one has a smaller ΔE. Then, the photon's energy must match the smaller ΔE.

Alternatively, maybe the next state is a combination of both, but I think in the quantum model, transitions are either vibrational or rotational, but perhaps the problem wants the minimal energy. So I need to compute ΔE for both possibilities.

So first, let me compute the vibrational energy difference. The vibrational energy levels are E_vib = (v + 1/2) h ω. So from v=0 to v=1, the energy change is (1 + 1/2 - 0 - 1/2) h ω = h ω. So ΔE_vib = h ω.

Next, the rotational energy. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J +1). For J=0 to J=1, the energy change is E_rot(1) - E_rot(0) = B * 1 * 2 - 0 = 2 B. So ΔE_rot = 2 B.

Which of these is smaller? So I need to compute both and compare.

To compute B, I need the moment of inertia I. The moment of inertia I = μ R², where μ is the reduced mass of the two atoms.

The reduced mass μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My). Let's compute that.

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But wait, we need to convert that into kilograms for SI units. Because the moment of inertia is in kg·m².

1 amu is approximately 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (22) amu → 20/11 amu → 20/(11) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Wait, 20/(11) is approximately 1.818. So μ ≈ 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

Let me calculate that: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

1.818 * 1.6605e-27 = ?

Well, 1.8 * 1.6605 = approx 2.9889, so 2.9889e-27 kg. But maybe I should be more precise.

Alternatively, I can compute 20/(22) = 10/11 ≈ 0.9091. So 0.9091 * 1.6605e-27 kg.

0.9091 * 1.6605e-27 = approximately 1.508e-27 kg.

Wait, wait, 10/11 is about 0.90909. So 0.90909 * 1.6605e-27.

Let me compute 0.90909 * 1.6605 = 1.508 (exactly: 0.90909 * 1.6605)

0.90909 * 1.6605 = Let's compute 90909 * 16605 = but that's too detailed. Alternatively, using calculator:

0.90909 * 1.6605 ≈ 1.508.

So μ ≈ 1.508e-27 kg.

Now, the bond length R is 2 angstroms. 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so R = 2e-10 m.

So I = μ R² = (1.508e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2.

Calculating (2e-10)^2 = 4e-20 m².

I = 1.508e-27 * 4e-20 = 6.032e-47 kg·m².

Now, the rotational constant B is given by B = ħ²/(2 I), where ħ is the reduced Planck's constant.

Wait, no. Let me think. The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), and B is given by (h²)/(8 π² I), but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look up the formula.

In the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are E_J = (h²/(8 π² I)) J (J + 1). So B is h²/(8 π² I). So B = (h/(2 π))² / (8 π² I) )? Wait, perhaps better to write it as B = (h²)/(8 π² I).

Alternatively, sometimes B is expressed in terms of frequency in wavenumbers (cm⁻¹), but perhaps for this problem, we can compute B in joules.

So let's compute B.

h is Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

I is 6.032e-47 kg·m².

So B = (h^2) / (8 π² I)

Plugging in the numbers:

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J²·s².

8 π² ≈ 8 * (9.8696) ≈ 78.9568.

So denominator: 8 π² I = 78.9568 * 6.032e-47 ≈ 78.9568 * 6.032e-47.

Wait, 78.9568 * 6 ≈ 473.74, 78.9568 * 6.032 ≈ let's compute:

6.032e-47 * 78.9568:

Wait, 6.032 * 78.9568 ≈ 6 * 78 = 468, 0.032 *78≈ 2.5, so around 470.5. So 470.5e-47 → 4.705e-45.

So denominator is ≈4.705e-45.

So B ≈ (4.39e-67) / (4.705e-45) ) ≈ (4.39 /4.705) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.932e-22 ≈ 9.32e-23 J.

Wait, let me compute 4.39e-67 / 4.705e-45. 

That's (4.39 / 4.705) ) * 1e-67+45 → 0.932 * 1e-22 → 9.32e-23 J.

So each rotational level E_J is B * J (J+1). So from J=0 to J=1, the energy difference is 2B.

So ΔE_rot = 2B = 2 * 9.32e-23 J ≈ 1.864e-22 J.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute B in terms of angular frequency. Hmm, maybe that's a better approach. Wait, the rotational energy is quantized, and the transition between states relates to the photon's energy.

Wait, but the vibrational frequency is given as ω = 4e14 rad/s. So the vibrational energy difference is h ω.

So let's compute ΔE_vib = h ω.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s. ω is 4e14 rad/s.

h ω = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

So ΔE_vib is 2.65e-19 J.

Now, the rotational energy difference is 1.86e-22 J.

Which is smaller: 1.86e-22 J is much smaller than 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition would require a much lower energy photon.

Wait, but wait a minute. The molecule is in its fundamental state, which is v=0, J=0. The next higher state is either J=1 or v=1. Since the ΔE_rot is about 1.86e-22 J and ΔE_vib is about 2.65e-19 J, the rotational transition requires less energy. But wait, the question says to switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the molecule would preferentially absorb the photon that causes the smallest energy jump. Therefore, the photon would need to have energy equal to ΔE_rot, which is the smaller of the two.

Wait, but wait another thing: the question says, 'switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy.' That implies the next state should have the smallest possible increase in energy. So between the two options (v=1, J=0 and J=1, v=0), which requires a smaller photon energy? The rotational transition requires much less energy, so that's the one.

But wait, what about the possibility of a transition that involves both a vibrational and rotational change? Like, for example, a photon could cause a transition to a state where both v and J change. But I think in the rigid rotor model, transitions can only change either v or J, but not both. Or wait, no, that's for selection rules. For example, in rotational transitions, the selection rule is ΔJ = ±1, and for vibrational transitions, Δv = ±1. But in the problem statement, it's about the molecule switching to the next state with the lowest possible energy, which I think is the first excited state, which is the one with the minimal increase in energy.

So, the photon must provide energy ΔE = lower of ΔE_rot and ΔE_vib. In this case, ΔE_rot is smaller.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next possible states are J=1 and v=1. But is v=1 with J=0 lower in energy than J=1 with v=0?

Let's compute both.

E_J=0 v=1: (1 + 1/2) h ω = (3/2) h ω.

E_J=1 v=0: (0 + 1/2) h ω + B * 1 * 2 = (1/2 h ω) + 2 B.

Which is lower?

We have E1 = (3/2) h ω and E2 = (1/2) h ω + 2B.

Compute both:

E1 = (3/2) * 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = (3/2) * 2.65e-19 = 3.975e-19 J.

E2 = (0.5 * 6.626e-34 *4e14 ) + 2 * 9.32e-23.

Compute each term:

0.5 * 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 0.5 * 2.65e-19 = 1.325e-19 J.

2 * 9.32e-23 = 1.864e-22 J.

So E2 = 1.325e-19 + 1.864e-22 ≈ 1.325e-19 J (since 1.86e-22 is much smaller than 1.325e-19).

So E2 is approximately 1.325e-19 J, which is less than E1 (3.975e-19 J). So the state with J=1 and v=0 has lower energy than the state with J=0 and v=1.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because for E2, the rotational part is only adding 2B, which is 1.86e-22 J, but the vibrational part is (1/2) h ω which is 1.325e-19 J. So E2 is 1.325e-19 + 1.86e-22 ≈ 1.325e-19 J. Meanwhile, E1 is 3.975e-19 J. So E2 is lower. So the next state with the lowest energy is J=1, v=0.

Wait, but wait, that can't be because the molecule is in the ground state with J=0, v=0. So the next states would be J=0, v=1 or J=1, v=0. The energies are E1 = 3/2 h ω and E2 = 1/2 h ω + 2B.

Which one is lower? Let's compute numerically.

We have h ω ≈ 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So E1 = 3/2 * 2.65e-19 ≈ 3.975e-19 J.

E2 = (1/2 * 2.65e-19) + 1.86e-22 ≈ 1.325e-19 + 0.000186e-19 ≈ 1.325e-19 J.

So E2 is much lower than E1. Therefore, the state J=1, v=0 is lower in energy than J=0, v=1. So the next state with the lowest possible energy is J=1, v=0.

Wait, but how does that make sense? Because the vibrational energy is much larger than the rotational energy. So E2 is in the vibrational ground state (v=0) but with J=1, which is a bit higher in energy than v=0, J=0. But E2 is 1.325e-19 J, while E1 is 3.975e-19 J.

Wait, but the initial state is v=0, J=0. So the energy of the initial state is E_initial = (1/2) h ω + 0 = 1.325e-19 J.

Wait no, wait: the initial state is v=0, J=0. So the initial energy is (0 + 1/2) h ω + 0 = 1/2 h ω = 1.325e-19 J.

The state J=1, v=0 has E = (1/2) h ω + 2B ≈ 1.325e-19 + 1.86e-22 ≈ 1.325e-19 J. So the energy is higher than the initial state by 1.86e-22 J.

The state J=0, v=1 has E = (1 + 1/2) h ω = 3/2 h ω ≈ 3.975e-19 J, which is much higher.

So the next state with the lowest energy is J=1, v=0. So the energy required for the transition is 1.86e-22 J.

But wait, the question is about the photon's momentum. Because energy is related to photon momentum via E = p c, where p is the momentum and c is the speed of light.

So the momentum p would be E divided by c.

Wait, E = p c → p = E / c.

So E is 1.86e-22 J.

c is approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (1.86e-22 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (1.86e-22) / 3e8 = 6.2e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but let me compute that again.

1.86e-22 / 3e8 = (1.86 / 3) * 1e-30 = 0.62 * 1e-30 = 6.2e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are close to 6.2e-31. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns
B) 2.3e-27 Ns
C) 1.1e-27 Ns
D) 1.4e-28 Ns.

Wait, Ns is equivalent to kg·m/s, since N = kg·m/s². So 1 Ns = 1 kg·m/s.

So 6.2e-31 kg·m/s is 6.2e-31 Ns.

But none of the options are in that ballpark. So I must have made a mistake in my reasoning somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps the error is in the assumption that the next state is J=1, v=0. Because the energy of J=1, v=0 is higher than the initial state by 1.86e-22 J, but perhaps the question allows for transitioning to the next state regardless of whether it's vibrational or rotational, but the minimal energy required. Alternatively, perhaps I've confused the energy levels.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the model being used is the non-rigid rotor, but in this model, the vibrational energy is incorporated into the rotational model. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering only the rotational transition, and the vibrational part is neglected.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is treated as a non-rigid rotor, which accounts for bond vibrations, and the energy levels are a combination of both. But I'm not sure, so perhaps I should think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition. But the photon's energy must match the lower of the two possible transitions.

Wait, but earlier, when I computed the energy of the J=1 state, the energy change was 1.86e-22 J, which is much smaller than the vibrational transition's 2.65e-19 J. So the photon's energy would need to be around 1.86e-22 J.

But the options are all in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range. So my calculation must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B.

Let me recalculate B.

B = h²/(8 π² I)

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

I = μ R²

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My) = (20 * 2) / (22) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Converting μ to kg: 1 amu = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So μ = (20/11) * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ (1.818) * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

Wait, this is different from what I thought earlier. So earlier I thought μ was 1.5e-27 kg, but that's incorrect. Let me recompute.

Ah, I see where I messed up earlier. I think I miscalculated μ.

Because Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) = 40 / 22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

Wait, 20 + 2 is 22. So 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu. So μ = 1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

Oh, I see. Earlier, I thought μ was around 1.5e-27 kg, but that's wrong. It should be 3.017e-27 kg.

Now, R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ R² = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

So I = 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

Now, B = h²/(8 π² I).

Compute h²: (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J²s².

8 π² ≈ 8 * 9.8696 ≈ 78.9568.

So denominator 8 π² I = 78.9568 * 1.2068e-46 ≈ let's compute 78.9568 * 1.2068e-46.

78.9568 * 1.2068 ≈ 78 * 1.2 = 93.6, but precise calculation:

78.9568 * 1.2068 ≈ ?

Let me approximate:

78.9568 * 1.2 = 94.748

78.9568 * 0.0068 ≈ 0.537

Total ≈ 95.285.

So 95.285e-46 → 9.5285e-45.

So denominator is 9.5285e-45.

B = (4.39e-67) / (9.5285e-45) ) = (4.39 /9.5285) ) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.4606 * 1e-22 ≈ 4.606e-23 J.

So B ≈ 4.606e-23 J.

So the rotational energy difference from J=0 to J=1 is 2B = 9.212e-23 J.

Now, the vibrational energy difference is h ω = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So 9.212e-23 J is much less than 2.65e-19 J.

So the photon must have energy E_photon = 9.212e-23 J.

Now, the momentum p is E_photon / c.

c = 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.212e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s.

Which is 3.07e-31 Ns.

But looking at the options again:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns → 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27 → 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27 → 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28 → 1.4e-28.

Wait, 3.07e-31 Ns is way smaller than any of the options. So I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I mixed up the energy with the photon momentum. Because E = p c.

Wait, E = h f = p c → p = E/(c).

So my calculation of E was 9.212e-23 J, so p = 9.212e-23 / (3e8) = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options don't have anything near that. So perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Wait, maybe the moment of inertia was miscalculated.

Wait, let me check the moment of inertia again.

I = μ R².

μ = (20*2)/(20+2) amu = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

1.818 amu * 1.6605e-27 kg/amu = 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.017e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = (3.017e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg·m².

Correct.

B = h²/(8 π² I) → (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 * π² * 1.2068e-46 )

Calculate numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 * (π^2) ≈ 78.96 → 78.96 * 1.2068e-46 ≈ 95.28e-46 → 9.528e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.528e-45 = approx 4.606e-23 J.

So from J=0 to J=1, ΔE = 2B = 9.212e-23 J.

E_photon = 9.212e-23 J.

p_photon = E_photon / c = 9.212e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg·m/s = 3.07e-31 Ns.

Hmm, but the options are much larger. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the model.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the transition from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, which is higher in energy than the rotational state. But that would require a higher energy photon, which the options don't have either.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state regardless of whether it's vibrational or rotational, but the photon's energy must be the sum, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule is treated as a rigid rotor, and we're considering the fundamental rotational state (J=1) and the vibrational transition, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the model considered here is the non-rigid rotor, which allows the bond to stretch, and the energy levels are a combination of both.

Wait, but I'm not familiar enough with that. Maybe I should think in terms of the energy of the photon matching the energy of the transition.

Wait, alternative approach: Perhaps the photon's energy must match the fundamental vibrational state, which is the first possible state, but then how does that fit with the rotational energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering the vibrational transition, and the rotational state is ignored, but that doesn't make sense because the problem mentions the rotation-vibration model.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the energy levels. Maybe the molecule is in the ground vibrational state but the ground rotational state (J=0), and the next state is J=1, which is a rotational transition. So the photon's energy is 2B.

But earlier, when I computed B correctly, the momentum comes out to be 3.07e-31 Ns, which isn't an option.

I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. The problem gives the angular frequency ω of vibration as 4e14 rad/s. So the vibrational energy difference is h ω = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

If the photon's energy is this, then the momentum p = E/c = 2.65e-19 / 3e8 = 8.83e-30 kg·m/s = 8.83e-30 Ns.

Still, this isn't matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule's transition to the next state, which is the first excited vibrational state, and the photon's energy is h ω. So the momentum is h ω / c.

But that would be (6.626e-34 *4e14) / 3e8 = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-30 Ns.

But again, not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the first vibrational state and the first rotational state, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy using the reduced mass and bond length to find the vibrational frequency, but that's another approach.

Wait, the vibrational frequency ω is given as 4e14 rad/s. So the energy difference for a vibrational transition is h ω, as I computed earlier.

But perhaps the question is asking about the transition when the molecule absorbs a photon that causes it to move to the next vibrational state, which would require a higher energy, but the options don't have such a high value.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state with the next higher energy, which is J=1, v=0, which requires a photon with energy 2B. But that gives us a momentum of 3.07e-31 Ns, which is not one of the options.

So perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27 Ns

C) 1.1e-27 Ns

D) 1.4e-28 Ns.

Wait, these are all on the order of 1e-27 to 1e-28, which is three orders of magnitude larger than what I calculated.

Hmm. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Wait, B is h^2/(8 pi^2 I).

But h is 6.626e-34 J s. So h^2 is (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 J^2 s^2.

I is 1.2068e-46 kg m^2.

So 8 pi^2 I is 8 * (9.8696) * 1.2068e-46 = approx 8 * 10 * 1.2e-46 = 9.6e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.6e-45 = approx 4.57e-23 J.

So 2B = 9.14e-23 J.

E_photon = 9.14e-23 J.

p = E_photon / c = 9.14e-23 / 3e8 = 3.05e-31 Ns.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for B.

Another approach: The rotational constant B is often expressed in terms of cm⁻¹. The formula for B is (h/(8 pi^2 c I)).

Wait, wait, perhaps that's the case. Let me think: the rotational energy levels can be expressed in terms of wavenumbers (cm⁻¹) as E_J = B J (J+1), where B is in cm⁻¹.

So B (cm⁻¹) = h/(8 pi^2 c I).

So then, B (in cm⁻¹) = (6.626e-34 J s) / (8 * pi^2 * 3e8 m/s * I).

Wait, but I is in kg m². So let me compute B in cm⁻¹.

Let me compute B using this formula.

Compute denominator: 8 * pi^2 * c * I.

c = 3e8 m/s.

I = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

So 8 pi^2 = 78.9568.

So denominator = 78.9568 * 3e8 m/s * 1.2068e-46 kg m².

Calculate denominator:

78.9568 *3e8 = 2.3687e10.

Multiply by 1.2068e-46: 2.3687e10 * 1.2068e-46 = 2.86e-36.

So denominator is 2.86e-36.

B (cm⁻¹) = 6.626e-34 / 2.86e-36 = approx 2317 cm⁻¹.

Hmm, but how does that help? Because I'm trying to find the energy difference in Joules.

Wait, when B is in cm⁻¹, the energy E_J (in Joules) would be E = B (cm⁻¹) * h c.

Because 1 cm⁻¹ corresponds to h c ergs, or h c * 1e7 ergs/J? Wait, perhaps better to compute it.

E_J = B (cm⁻¹) * h c.

But wait, h c is 1240 eV·nm ≈ 1.24e-4 J·m.

Wait, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 1240 eV·nm = 1240 * 1.602e-19 J * 1e-9 m = 2.0e-25 J·m.

Wait, but E_J = B (cm⁻¹) * h c.

Wait, cm⁻¹ is 1/cm = 100 m⁻¹.

So E_J = B (m⁻¹) * h c.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me compute B in m⁻¹.

Wait, 1 cm⁻¹ = 100 m⁻¹.

So B = 2317 cm⁻¹ = 2317 * 100 m⁻¹ = 2.317e5 m⁻¹.

Then, E_J = B * h c.

h c = 6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So E_J = 2.317e5 m⁻¹ * 1.9878e-25 J·m = 2.317e5 * 1.9878e-25 J ≈ 4.61e-20 J.

But wait, that's the energy for J=1, which would be E= B J (J+1) = 2.317e5 cm⁻¹ * hc.

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting me nowhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that I'm not getting the correct option and think about what I'm missing.

Wait a moment. Oh! Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. Fundamental state usually refers to the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state with the lowest possible energy would be the first excited state, which is either J=1 (rotational) or v=1 (vibrational). But from earlier calculations, the rotational transition requires much less energy.

But the problem is that the options don't match the calculated momentum. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the moment of inertia.

Wait, perhaps I should use the reduced mass in atomic mass units. Let me think again: the moment of inertia I is μ R², where μ is the reduced mass in kg, and R is in meters.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in converting amu to kg.

1 amu = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) * 1 amu = (40/22) * 1.6605e-27 kg.

40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.81818.

So 1.81818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = approximately 3.017e-27 kg.

R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters.

I = 3.017e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 * 4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

So B = h²/(8 pi² I) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 pi² *1.2068e-46).

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

Denominator: 8 pi² *1.2068e-46 = 78.9568 * 1.2068e-46 ≈ 95.28e-46 = 9.528e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.528e-45 ≈ 4.606e-23 J.

So the rotational energy difference is 2B = 9.212e-23 J.

E_photon = 9.212e-23 J.

p_photon = E/c = 9.212e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Which is 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options don't match this. So perhaps I'm miscalculating B.

Wait, another approach. Let's compute B in terms of angular frequency for rotation, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the rotational energy in terms of frequency.

Wait, another formula: for a rigid rotor, the energy levels are E_J = ħ ω_r J (J+1), where ω_r is the rotational angular frequency.

So ω_r = sqrt( k / (μ R²) ), but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, ω_r is related to the moment of inertia: I = μ R² = ħ²/(m ω_r²), where m is some factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the rotational angular frequency ω_r:

ω_r = sqrt( (k)/(I) ), but I don't have the value of k (force constant) here. Alternatively, perhaps knowing that the rotational energy is quantized, and the spacing between J levels is 2B per J step.

But perhaps I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting me to calculate the momentum based on the vibrational transition, not the rotational one. Let's try that.

E_photon_vibrational = h ω =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p_photon = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-30 Ns.

Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, maybe the question has a typo, and the answer is not among the options. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, maybe the photon's energy is the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy differences.

But that would be 2B + h ω = 9.2e-23 + 2.65e-19 = approx 2.65e-19 J, which brings us back to the same problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state as the first excited vibrational state, but that would require a much higher energy, which doesn't match the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), and the next state is the first vibrational excited state (v=1, J=0), which requires a photon with energy h ω. But the momentum is 8.83e-30 Ns, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for the bond length. The bond length is given as 2 angstroms. Did I use that correctly?

Yes, R = 2e-10 meters.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Let me try to see if any of the options match the calculated value of 3.07e-31 Ns. But none of the options are anywhere near that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recheck.

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

h squared is 6.626e-34 *6.626e-34 = (6.626)^2 * 1e-68 → 43.9 * 1e-68 → 4.39e-67 J² s².

I = μ R² = (3.017e-27 kg) * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.017e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

8 pi^2 = 78.9568.

So denominator = 78.9568 *1.2068e-46 = 95.28e-46 = 9.528e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 /9.528e-45 = approx 4.606e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct.

Another thought: perhaps the question is asking about the transition to the next state with the lowest energy, which is the first excited vibrational state, and the rotational state is considered as well, but I think that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the transition where both J and v change. But that's probably not allowed by selection rules.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a diatomic molecule where the rotational state J=0 isn't allowed, so the next state is J=1, which would require a photon with energy 2B.

But again, the momentum comes to 3.07e-31 Ns.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me compute B again.

Wait, I have I = 1.2068e-46 kg m².

h = 6.626e-34 J s.

So h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

8 pi² I = 78.9568 * 1.2068e-46 = 95.28e-46 = 9.528e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.528e-45 = 4.606e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct.

So the photon's energy is 9.212e-23 J.

Momentum p = E / c = 9.212e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 kg m/s.

Hmm, perhaps the options have a typo and the correct answer is not present. But that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the denominator.

Wait, 8 pi^2 I = 78.9568 * I.

I is 1.2068e-46.

So 78.9568 * 1.2068e-46 = 78.9568 *1.2068 = approx 95.28, so 95.28e-46 → 9.528e-45.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the transition to the next state with the next higher energy, which is the vibrational state, and the rotational state is not considered. But that doesn't make sense because the rotational transition requires less energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the first vibrational state (v=1, J=0), which requires a photon of energy h ω. But as calculated earlier, that gives a momentum of 8.83e-30 Ns, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the question refers to the molecule being modeled by the non-rigid rotor model, which combines both vibrations and rotations, and the energy levels are a combination. But I don't know the exact formula for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula for the vibrational energy, and the rotational part is ignored. But then, the photon's momentum would be 8.83e-30 Ns, which is still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the bond length in picometers instead of angstroms? No, the bond length is given as 2 angstroms, which is 200 pm. So R is 2e-10 m.

Hmm. Perhaps the answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, another thought: the reduced mass μ is (Mx My)/(Mx + My). But Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu. So μ = (20 *2)/(20+2) = 40/22 = 20/11 ≈ 1.818 amu.

But perhaps I should have used the sum of the atomic masses instead of the reduced mass? No, because I is μ R², and μ is indeed the reduced mass.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the moment of inertia using the individual masses, not the reduced mass. But that's incorrect.

Wait, no, the moment of inertia for a diatomic is definitely μ R², where μ is the reduced mass.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I'll have to go with the calculation and see if any of the options are close to 3.07e-31 Ns. But none of them are. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the 'fundamental state' refers to the first vibrational state, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the first state beyond the ground state, which is the next available state, regardless of being rotational or vibrational.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state as the first vibrational state, which requires a higher energy, but that would require a photon with momentum around 8.83e-30 Ns, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking about the transition to the next state with the lowest energy, which is the rotational state, but the calculation doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps I should try computing the momentum for the vibrational transition again.

E_photon = h ω = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p_photon = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-30 Ns.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, looking at the options, the smallest option is D) 1.4e-28 Ns, which is four orders of magnitude larger than my calculated 3e-31.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider that the question refers to the transition to the next vibrational and rotational state combined, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using a different model or different constants.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy difference is given by the sum of the rotational and vibrational energy differences. But that's unlikely because that would be a higher energy transition.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state as the first allowed state, which is the first vibrational state, and the rotational transition is not allowed due to selection rules. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the rotational constant B in terms of wavenumbers (cm⁻¹) and then converting that to energy.

Wait, earlier, I calculated B in cm⁻¹ as approximately 2317 cm⁻¹.

So the energy for J=1 would be E = B * hc.

h c = 1240 eV nm → 1240 * 1e7 erg → but perhaps better to compute E in Joules.

E = 2317 cm⁻¹ * h c.

h c = 6.626e-34 J s * 3e8 m/s = 1.9878e-25 J m.

But 1 cm⁻¹ corresponds to h c * 1 cm = 1.9878e-25 J m * 0.01 m = 1.9878e-27 J.

So E = 2317 cm⁻¹ * 1.9878e-27 J = 2317 * 1.9878e-27 ≈ 4.61e-24 J.

So the energy difference for J=1 would be 4.61e-24 J.

p_photon = E / c = 4.61e-24 /3e8 = 1.537e-32 kg m/s.

Still, that's not matching any options.

I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should consider that the correct answer is option C) 1.1e-27 Ns. But how?

Wait, let's compute the momentum p for the rotational transition again.

E = 2B = 9.212e-23 J.

p = E / c = 9.212e-23 /3e8 = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is using a different value for Planck's constant, like h=6.62e-34 instead of 6.626e-34. Let me try that.

h=6.62e-34.

Then, E_photon = 2B = (6.62e-34)^2/(8 pi² I) * 2.

Wait, but that would still give a result close to 3e-31 Ns.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a different approach, such as the photon's momentum being related to the change in angular momentum. But that's not the case because photon momentum is E/c.

Another thought: perhaps I should have used the rotational energy in terms of the vibrational frequency ω. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the formula p = h/(2 pi) for the photon's momentum, but that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering relativistic effects, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the photon's momentum as the change in the molecule's angular momentum. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the question is expecting the photon's momentum to be the same as the rotational energy divided by c, but I think that's what I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the momentum is calculated using the reduced mass and bond length for the vibrational energy, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the vibrational energy is (1/2) h ω for the ground state. The next state would be v=1, which is (3/2) h ω. So the energy difference is h ω.

So E_photon = h ω =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p_photon = 2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-30 Ns.

Still not matching any options.

I'm really stuck. Maybe I should pick the closest option, but I don't see any that are close to 3e-31 or 8e-30. Since all options are larger than my calculated values, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B.

Let me compute B again.

B = h²/(8 pi² I).

h =6.626e-34.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = 4.39e-67 J² s².

8 pi² I = 8 * (pi^2) * I.

I =1.2068e-46 kg m².

So 8 pi² I = 8 * (9.8696) * 1.2068e-46 = 78.9568 *1.2068e-46 = 95.28e-46 =9.528e-45.

So B =4.39e-67 /9.528e-45 =4.606e-23 J.

Yes, correct.

So, I think the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in the question's interpretation.

Wait, the question says the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is v=0 and J=0. The next state could be either J=1 or v=1. The energy required for J=1 is 2B, which is much smaller than the vibrational transition. So the photon's energy is 2B, and the momentum is E/c.

But according to my calculations, the momentum is 3.07e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. So perhaps I should reevaluate the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the bond length R is given in angstroms, but I used it in meters. No, R is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 m, which is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is using the non-rigid rotor model, which includes a vibrationally induced change in the bond length, thereby affecting the moment of inertia. But I'm not familiar enough with that model to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the photon to have the same momentum as the rotational energy difference divided by c, but I think that's what I did.

Given that none of the options match, I'm unsure. But perhaps the intended answer is option C) 1.1e-27 Ns, but I can't see how that would come about.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of B. Let me recompute B.

Wait, perhaps I should use the rotational constant B = h²/(8 pi² I c), but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps I should use B = ħ²/(2 I).

Wait, ħ is h/(2 pi). So ħ = 6.626e-34 / (2 pi) ≈ 1.054e-34 J s.

So ħ² = (1.054e-34)^2 ≈ 1.11e-68 J² s².

B = ħ²/(2 I) = 1.11e-68 / (2 *1.2068e-46) ) = 1.11e-68 / 2.4136e-46 ≈ 4.6e-23 J.

Same result as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer isn't among the options, but perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.


The problem involves a diatomic molecule modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is in its fundamental state (v=0, J=0), and the goal is to determine the momentum of a photon required to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Energy Levels**: The total energy of the molecule is the sum of vibrational and rotational energies:
   - Vibrational energy: \( E_{\text{vib}} = \left(v + \frac{1}{2}\right) h \omega \)
   - Rotational energy: \( E_{\text{rot}} = B J (J+1) \), where \( B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} \) and \( I = \mu R^2 \) is the moment of inertia.

2. **Initial State**: The molecule is in the ground state (v=0, J=0), with total energy:
   \[
   E_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} h \omega + 0 = \frac{1}{2} h \omega
   \]

3. **Next State**: The next state with the lowest energy is either:
   - \( v=1, J=0 \): Total energy \( E_{\text{vib}} = \frac{3}{2} h \omega \)
   - \( v=0, J=1 \): Total energy \( E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{1}{2} h \omega + 2B \)

   The energy difference for these transitions is:
   - For \( v=1, J=0 \): \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega \)
   - For \( v=0, J=1 \): \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \)

4. **Comparison of Transitions**:
   - The vibrational energy difference is \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 4 \times 10^{14} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).
   - The rotational energy difference requires calculating \( B \). The reduced mass \( \mu \) is:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
     \]
     Converting to kilograms: \( \mu = 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \approx 3.017 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \).  
     The bond length \( R = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \), so:
     \[
     I = \mu R^2 = 3.017 \times 10^{-27} \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2068 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
     \]
     The rotational constant \( B \) is:
     \[
     B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 \cdot 1.2068 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 4.606 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
     \]
     Thus, \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 9.212 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \).

   Comparing \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \) and \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 9.212 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \), the rotational transition requires significantly less energy.

5. **Photon Momentum**:
   - The photon's momentum is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \). For the rotational transition:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.212 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}
     \]
   - For the vibrational transition:
     \[
     p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-30} \, \text{Ns}

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The rotational transition requires less energy, so the photon's momentum is \( p \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns} \). However, none of the provided options match this value. The closest option is **C) \( 1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{Ns} \)**, though it is three orders of magnitude larger than the calculated value. Given the mismatch, the correct answer is likely not listed.
