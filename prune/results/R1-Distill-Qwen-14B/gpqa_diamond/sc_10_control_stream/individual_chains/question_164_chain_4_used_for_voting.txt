Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully. Let's read the question again and try to understand what it's asking.

The question is about binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses, with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are between two primary eclipses. Then, from spectroscopic observations, we get radial velocity (RV) variations. System_1 has amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. We need to find by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The options given are A to D.

Hmm. I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity curves give us information about the masses of the stars. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity amplitude because it's less massive stars that orbit more quickly. So, the velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the mass.

Wait, right. The formula I think is something like (mass star 2) / (mass star 1) = (velocity amplitude star 1) / (velocity amplitude star 2). Oh wait, more precisely, the ratio of the masses is inversely proportional to the ratio of their velocity amplitudes. So, M1/M2 = (K2)/(K1), where K is the velocity semi-amplitude.

But wait, in this problem, system_1 has two stars with K1 =10 and K2=5. So their mass ratio is M1/M2 = (5)/(10) = 0.5. Similarly, system_2 has K1=15 and K2=10, so their mass ratio is M1/M2=10/15=2/3≈0.6667.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me get that right. Let me think: in a binary system, both stars orbit a common center of mass. The more massive star is closer to the center of mass and thus has a smaller orbit (so lower velocity). So the velocity amplitude (K) is inversely proportional to the mass.

So for each system, we can find the mass ratio, then find the total mass of each system and compare.

Let's break it down step by step.

For system_1:
Star A has K_A = 10 km/s
Star B has K_B =5 km/s
The mass ratio M_A / M_B = (K_B)/(K_A) = 5/10 = 0.5 → M_A = 0.5*M_B
So total mass of system_1 is M_A + M_B = 0.5*M_B + M_B = 1.5*M_B

For system_2:
Star A has K_A =15 km/s
Star B has K_B=10 km/s
Mass ratio M_A/M_B = (10)/(15)= 2/3 ≈0.6667 → M_A= (2/3) * M_B
Total mass is M_A + M_B = (2/3) M_B + M_B = (5/3) M_B = approx 1.6667 M_B

But wait, wait. Wait, I think I may have mixed up the notation. Let me clarify. For each system, star 1 and star 2 have velocities K1 and K2. The mass ratio is M1/M2 = (K2)/(K1).

So in system_1:

M1 / M2 = K2 / K1 =5/10=0.5 → M1=0.5 M2.

So the masses are M1=0.5 M2, and M2 is M2. So total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

For system_2:

M1 has K=15, M2 has K=10. So M1/M2 = 10/15=2/3. So M1 = (2/3) M2.

Total mass = (2/3 M2) + M2 = (5/3) M2 ≈ 1.6667 M2.

Wait, but I'm comparing the total mass of system_1 to system_2. So system_1 has 1.5 M2 (but wait, wait, in system_2, the M2 would be different. Oh wait, no. Because each system's M2 is the mass of each star, but I think I might have a confusion here.

Wait, perhaps I should denote the stars in each system with different letters to avoid confusion.

Let me approach it differently.

Let me denote for system_1:

Star A and Star B. Their velocities are K_A =10, K_B=5.

Mass ratio M_A / M_B = K_B / K_A =5/10=0.5 → M_A = 0.5 M_B.

Total mass of system_1: M_A + M_B = 0.5 M_B + M_B =1.5 M_B.

For system_2:

Star X and Star Y. Their velocities are K_X=15, K_Y=10.

Mass ratio M_X/M_Y = K_Y / K_X =10/15=2/3 ≈0.6667 → M_X = (2/3) M_Y.

Total mass of system_2: M_X + M_Y = (2/3 M_Y) + M_Y = (5/3) M_Y ≈1.6667 M_Y.

Wait, but what's the relation between M_B (system_1's M_B) and M_Y (system_2's M_Y)? Hmm, I think I'm complicating it. Maybe each system's masses are independent, but we need to find a way to compare their total masses.

Wait, but perhaps the periods are the same? No, system_1 has a period of 2 years, system_2 has 1 year. So their periods are different.

Wait, I think I need to use Kepler's third law for binary systems. The formula is (M1 + M2) * P^2 = (4π²/G) a³, where a is the separation between the stars. Alternatively, for binary stars, the formula is often written as (M1 + M2) = (4π² a³) / (G P²) ), but I might be getting the exact form wrong.

Alternatively, I recall that for a binary system, the sum of the masses can be calculated using the radial velocities and the orbital period. The formula is:

(M1 + M2) = ( (K1 + K2) * P ) / (2π G) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^0.5 )) )

But since both systems are assumed to be circular (e=0), that simplifies to:

M_total = ( (K1 + K2) * P ) / (2 π G )

Wait, but units can be tricky. Alternatively, another approach is to use the fact that the velocity amplitude K is related to the mass.

Wait, another approach: each star's velocity is given by K, and the total velocity is K1 + K2. The orbital period is P. The circumference is 2πa, where a is the distance each star moves in their orbit. But wait, the two stars orbit their common center of mass, so their orbits are a1 and a2, respectively.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think of the formula for the mass function, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here. Alternatively, perhaps I can model each system's total mass using their velocity amplitudes and the period.

Wait, I think the formula for the mass of the system is as follows: M = ( (K1 + K2) * P ) / (2π G ) ) * ( (1 + mass_ratio) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the reduced mass. Hmm, maybe it's better to use the formula for the mass function, which is:

f(M) = ( (K * P )^3 ) / (2 π G )

But wait, the mass function only gives the mass of the companion relative to the primary, but if the inclination is 90 degrees (edge-on, which is the case for eclipsing binaries), then the mass function equals the true mass. So in that case, the mass can be calculated as:

M_total = M1 + M2 = ( (K1 + K2) * P ) / (2 π G )

Wait, but maybe I'm mixing up the exact formula. Let's think again. The formula for the sum of the masses is:

M1 + M2 = ( (4 π²) / (G P²) ) * (a1 + a2)^3 )

But a1 + a2 is the separation between the two stars, a = a1 + a2. Also, the relation between the velocities and the separation is that K1 = (2π a1) / P, and K2 = (2π a2) / P.

Since a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) a, and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) a. So a1 + a2 = a.

But perhaps a better approach is to note that K1 = (2 π a1) / P, and K2 = (2 π a2) / P.

So a1 = (K1 P) / (2 π), a2 = (K2 P)/(2 π).

The total separation a = a1 + a2 = ( (K1 + K2) P )/(2 π )

Then, applying Kepler's third law:

P² = (4 π² / G (M1 + M2)) ) a³ → M1 + M2 = (4 π² a³ )/( G P² )

Substituting a from earlier:

M1 + M2 = (4 π² [ ( (K1 + K2) P )/(2 π ) ]^3 ) / ( G P² )

Simplify that:

= (4 π² * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π³) ) ) / ( G P^2 )

= (4 π² * (K1+K2)^3 P^3 ) ) / (8 π³ G P² )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4 π² / 8 π³ = 4/(8 π) = 1/(2 π).

P^3 / P² = P.

So:

= ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) ) / ( 2 π G )

So, M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 π G )

But wait, this gives the total mass in terms of K and P. So for each system, we can compute M_total.

But wait, the units here are important. Let me think about the units to make sure.

The formula is:

M_total (kg) = [ ( (K1 + K2) in m/s )^3 * P (in seconds) ] / (2 * π * G )

But let's not get bogged down in units; since we are comparing two systems, the constants (like G and 2π) will cancel out when taking the ratio.

So, the mass ratio between system_1 and system_2 is:

(M1_total) / (M2_total) = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 ]

Because when you take M1/M2, the G and 2π cancel.

So let's compute the numerator and denominator.

For system_1:

K1_1 =10, K2_1=5 → sum=15 km/s. P1=2 years.

For system_2:

K1_2=15, K2_2=10 → sum=25 km/s. P2=1 year.

So,

M1_total/M2_total = [ (15)^3 * 2 ] / [ (25)^3 * 1 ]

Compute each part:

15^3 = 3375

25^3 =15625

Putting it together:

(3375 * 2) / (15625 * 1 ) = (6750) / (15625 ) = 6750 / 15625.

Let me compute that:

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 6750/25=270, 15625/25=625.

So 270/625. Let's compute that as a decimal.

270 ÷625. 625 goes into 270 zero times. 625 *0.432=270 (since 625*0.4=250, 625*0.032=20 → 250+20=270). So 0.432.

So M1_total/M2_total = ~0.432.

Wait, but wait. That would mean system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So if system_1 is 0.43 times as massive, then it's about 0.43 times as massive, which is less than system_2. But the question says, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So perhaps I got the ratio backward.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck.

M1_total is the total mass of system_1, and M2_total is the total mass of system_2.

So the ratio is M1_total / M2_total = 0.432.

But the question is: by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? If the ratio is less than 1, it implies system_1 is less massive.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the formula I used.

Earlier, I had:

M_total = ( (K1+K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 π G )

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, in Kepler's third law for a binary system, the sum of the masses is given by:

M1 + M2 = (4 π² / G) * (a1 + a2)^3 / P²

But a1 + a2 = a, the semi-major axis (assuming circular orbits).

And from the velocity amplitudes, K1 = 2 π a1 / P, K2 = 2 π a2 / P.

So a1 = (K1 P) / (2 π ), a2 = (K2 P) / (2 π )

So a = a1 + a2 = ( (K1 + K2) P ) / (2 π )

Substituting into Kepler's law:

M_total = (4 π² / G) * ( a^3 ) / P²

= (4 π²)/(G) * ( ( (K1+K2) P )/(2 π ) )^3 / P^2

= (4 π² )/(G) * ( (K1+K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3) ) ) / P^2

Simplify:

= (4 π² * (K1+K2)^3 P^3) ) / (8 π^3 G P^2 )

= ( (4/8) π² / π^3 ) * (K1+K2)^3 * P^3 / (G P^2 )

Simplify 4/8 → 1/2.

And π²/π^3 → 1/π.

So:

= ( (1/2) * (1/π) ) * (K1+K2)^3 * P )

= ( (K1+K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 π G )

Ah, so the formula I used earlier is correct. So the mass ratio is as I calculated: 0.432.

So system_1's mass is approximately 0.43 times that of system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.43.

But the question is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So if it's 0.43 times, then system_1 is less massive. But the options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7.

So the ratio M1/M2 is ~0.43, which is option A) ~0.4.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the exact value to be precise.

15^3 is 3375, and 25^3 is 15625.

So (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1 )= (3375 *2 ) / (15625 * 1 )=6750 / 15625.

Compute 6750 ÷15625.

Let me compute 15625 × 0.432 = 15625 * 0.4 = 6250; 15625 × 0.032 = 500 → total 6250+500=6750. Yes, so 15625 × 0.432 =6750 → so 6750/15625=0.432.

So the ratio is 0.432, approximately 0.43. So the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is 0.43, which is about 0.4. So the answer would be option A) ~0.4.

But wait, let me think again. Because the problem states that the periods are the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. For eclipsing binaries, the period is the orbital period. So that's correct.

Wait, but another point: The formula I used gives the sum of the masses. So each system's total mass is calculated correctly. So system_1 has a total mass of 0.43 * system_2's mass.

Therefore, system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2.

But the question is: By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?

So the factor would be 0.43, which is approximately 0.4. So answer A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between radial velocity amplitudes, orbital periods, and total system mass. The total mass of a binary system can be expressed as:

\[
M_{\text{total}} = \frac{(K_1 + K_2)^3 \cdot P}{2 \pi G}
\]

where \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars, \(P\) is the orbital period, and \(G\) is the gravitational constant. Since the ratio of the masses depends only on the relative values of \((K_1 + K_2)^3 \cdot P\), the constants \(G\) and \(2\pi\) cancel out when comparing the two systems.

### System_1:
- \(K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s}, K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s}\)
- \(K_1 + K_2 = 15 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Orbital period \(P_1 = 2 \, \text{years}\)

### System_2:
- \(K_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s}, K_2 = 10 \, \text{km/s}\)
- \(K_1 + K_2 = 25 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Orbital period \(P_2 = 1 \, \text{year}\)

The ratio of the total masses is:

\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{(K_{1,1} + K_{2,1})^3 \cdot P_1}{(K_{1,2} + K_{2,2})^3 \cdot P_2}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{(15)^3 \cdot 2}{(25)^3 \cdot 1}
\]

\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{3375 \cdot 2}{15625 \cdot 1} = \frac{6750}{15625} \approx 0.432
\]

Thus, system_1 is approximately \(0.43\) times as massive as system_2. Since the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, the answer is approximately \(0.4\).

### Final Answer:
The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately **0.4**.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully. Let's read the question again and try to understand what it's asking.

The question is about binary star systems: system_1 and system_2. Both have eclipses, with periods of 2 years and 1 year respectively. The periods are between two primary eclipses. Then, from spectroscopic observations, we get radial velocity (RV) variations. System_1 has amplitudes of 10 km/s and 5 km/s. System_2 has 15 and 10 km/s. We need to find by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. The options given are A to D.

Hmm. I remember that in binary star systems, the radial velocity curves give us information about the masses of the stars. The more massive star would have a smaller velocity amplitude because it's less massive stars that orbit more quickly. So, the velocity amplitude is inversely proportional to the mass.

Wait, right. The formula I think is something like (mass star 2) / (mass star 1) = (velocity amplitude star 1) / (velocity amplitude star 2). Oh wait, more precisely, the ratio of the masses is inversely proportional to the ratio of their velocity amplitudes. So, M1/M2 = (K2)/(K1), where K is the velocity semi-amplitude.

But wait, in this problem, system_1 has two stars with K1 =10 and K2=5. So their mass ratio is M1/M2 = (5)/(10) = 0.5. Similarly, system_2 has K1=15 and K2=10, so their mass ratio is M1/M2=10/15=2/3≈0.6667.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me get that right. Let me think: in a binary system, both stars orbit a common center of mass. The more massive star is closer to the center of mass and thus has a smaller orbit (so lower velocity). So the velocity amplitude (K) is inversely proportional to the mass.

So for each system, we can find the mass ratio, then find the total mass of each system and compare.

Let's break it down step by step.

For system_1:
Star A has K_A = 10 km/s
Star B has K_B =5 km/s
The mass ratio M_A / M_B = (K_B)/(K_A) = 5/10 = 0.5 → M_A = 0.5*M_B
So total mass of system_1 is M_A + M_B = 0.5*M_B + M_B = 1.5*M_B

For system_2:
Star A has K_A =15 km/s
Star B has K_B=10 km/s
Mass ratio M_A/M_B = (10)/(15)= 2/3 ≈0.6667 → M_A= (2/3) * M_B
Total mass is M_A + M_B = (2/3) M_B + M_B = (5/3) M_B = approx 1.6667 M_B

But wait, wait. Wait, I think I may have mixed up the notation. Let me clarify. For each system, star 1 and star 2 have velocities K1 and K2. The mass ratio is M1/M2 = (K2)/(K1).

So in system_1:

M1 / M2 = K2 / K1 =5/10=0.5 → M1=0.5 M2.

So the masses are M1=0.5 M2, and M2 is M2. So total mass of system_1 is M1 + M2 = 0.5 M2 + M2 = 1.5 M2.

For system_2:

M1 has K=15, M2 has K=10. So M1/M2 = 10/15=2/3. So M1 = (2/3) M2.

Total mass = (2/3 M2) + M2 = (5/3) M2 ≈ 1.6667 M2.

Wait, but I'm comparing the total mass of system_1 to system_2. So system_1 has 1.5 M2 (but wait, wait, in system_2, the M2 would be different. Oh wait, no. Because each system's M2 is the mass of each star, but I think I might have a confusion here.

Wait, perhaps I should denote the stars in each system with different letters to avoid confusion.

Let me approach it differently.

Let me denote for system_1:

Star A and Star B. Their velocities are K_A =10, K_B=5.

Mass ratio M_A / M_B = K_B / K_A =5/10=0.5 → M_A = 0.5 M_B.

Total mass of system_1: M_A + M_B = 0.5 M_B + M_B =1.5 M_B.

For system_2:

Star X and Star Y. Their velocities are K_X=15, K_Y=10.

Mass ratio M_X/M_Y = K_Y / K_X =10/15=2/3 ≈0.6667 → M_X = (2/3) M_Y.

Total mass of system_2: M_X + M_Y = (2/3 M_Y) + M_Y = (5/3) M_Y ≈1.6667 M_Y.

Wait, but what's the relation between M_B (system_1's M_B) and M_Y (system_2's M_Y)? Hmm, I think I'm complicating it. Maybe each system's masses are independent, but we need to find a way to compare their total masses.

Wait, but perhaps the periods are the same? No, system_1 has a period of 2 years, system_2 has 1 year. So their periods are different.

Wait, I think I need to use Kepler's third law for binary systems. The formula is (M1 + M2) * P^2 = (4π²/G) a³, where a is the separation between the stars. Alternatively, for binary stars, the formula is often written as (M1 + M2) = (4π² a³) / (G P²) ), but I might be getting the exact form wrong.

Alternatively, I recall that for a binary system, the sum of the masses can be calculated using the radial velocities and the orbital period. The formula is:

(M1 + M2) = ( (K1 + K2) * P ) / (2π G) ) * (1/( (1 - e²)^0.5 )) )

But since both systems are assumed to be circular (e=0), that simplifies to:

M_total = ( (K1 + K2) * P ) / (2 π G )

Wait, but units can be tricky. Alternatively, another approach is to use the fact that the velocity amplitude K is related to the mass.

Wait, another approach: each star's velocity is given by K, and the total velocity is K1 + K2. The orbital period is P. The circumference is 2πa, where a is the distance each star moves in their orbit. But wait, the two stars orbit their common center of mass, so their orbits are a1 and a2, respectively.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think of the formula for the mass function, but I'm not sure if that's necessary here. Alternatively, perhaps I can model each system's total mass using their velocity amplitudes and the period.

Wait, I think the formula for the mass of the system is as follows: M = ( (K1 + K2) * P ) / (2π G ) ) * ( (1 + mass_ratio) )

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the reduced mass. Hmm, maybe it's better to use the formula for the mass function, which is:

f(M) = ( (K * P )^3 ) / (2 π G )

But wait, the mass function only gives the mass of the companion relative to the primary, but if the inclination is 90 degrees (edge-on, which is the case for eclipsing binaries), then the mass function equals the true mass. So in that case, the mass can be calculated as:

M_total = M1 + M2 = ( (K1 + K2) * P ) / (2 π G )

Wait, but maybe I'm mixing up the exact formula. Let's think again. The formula for the sum of the masses is:

M1 + M2 = ( (4 π²) / (G P²) ) * (a1 + a2)^3 )

But a1 + a2 is the separation between the two stars, a = a1 + a2. Also, the relation between the velocities and the separation is that K1 = (2π a1) / P, and K2 = (2π a2) / P.

Since a1 = (M2/(M1+M2)) a, and a2 = (M1/(M1 + M2)) a. So a1 + a2 = a.

But perhaps a better approach is to note that K1 = (2 π a1) / P, and K2 = (2 π a2) / P.

So a1 = (K1 P) / (2 π), a2 = (K2 P)/(2 π).

The total separation a = a1 + a2 = ( (K1 + K2) P )/(2 π )

Then, applying Kepler's third law:

P² = (4 π² / G (M1 + M2)) ) a³ → M1 + M2 = (4 π² a³ )/( G P² )

Substituting a from earlier:

M1 + M2 = (4 π² [ ( (K1 + K2) P )/(2 π ) ]^3 ) / ( G P² )

Simplify that:

= (4 π² * ( (K1 + K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π³) ) ) / ( G P^2 )

= (4 π² * (K1+K2)^3 P^3 ) ) / (8 π³ G P² )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

4 π² / 8 π³ = 4/(8 π) = 1/(2 π).

P^3 / P² = P.

So:

= ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) ) / ( 2 π G )

So, M_total = ( (K1 + K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 π G )

But wait, this gives the total mass in terms of K and P. So for each system, we can compute M_total.

But wait, the units here are important. Let me think about the units to make sure.

The formula is:

M_total (kg) = [ ( (K1 + K2) in m/s )^3 * P (in seconds) ] / (2 * π * G )

But let's not get bogged down in units; since we are comparing two systems, the constants (like G and 2π) will cancel out when taking the ratio.

So, the mass ratio between system_1 and system_2 is:

(M1_total) / (M2_total) = [ (K1_1 + K2_1)^3 * P1 ] / [ (K1_2 + K2_2)^3 * P2 ]

Because when you take M1/M2, the G and 2π cancel.

So let's compute the numerator and denominator.

For system_1:

K1_1 =10, K2_1=5 → sum=15 km/s. P1=2 years.

For system_2:

K1_2=15, K2_2=10 → sum=25 km/s. P2=1 year.

So,

M1_total/M2_total = [ (15)^3 * 2 ] / [ (25)^3 * 1 ]

Compute each part:

15^3 = 3375

25^3 =15625

Putting it together:

(3375 * 2) / (15625 * 1 ) = (6750) / (15625 ) = 6750 / 15625.

Let me compute that:

Divide numerator and denominator by 25: 6750/25=270, 15625/25=625.

So 270/625. Let's compute that as a decimal.

270 ÷625. 625 goes into 270 zero times. 625 *0.432=270 (since 625*0.4=250, 625*0.032=20 → 250+20=270). So 0.432.

So M1_total/M2_total = ~0.432.

Wait, but wait. That would mean system_1 is about 0.43 times as massive as system_2. So the question is asking by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2. So if system_1 is 0.43 times as massive, then it's about 0.43 times as massive, which is less than system_2. But the question says, by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So perhaps I got the ratio backward.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck.

M1_total is the total mass of system_1, and M2_total is the total mass of system_2.

So the ratio is M1_total / M2_total = 0.432.

But the question is: by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2? If the ratio is less than 1, it implies system_1 is less massive.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the formula I used.

Earlier, I had:

M_total = ( (K1+K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 π G )

Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, in Kepler's third law for a binary system, the sum of the masses is given by:

M1 + M2 = (4 π² / G) * (a1 + a2)^3 / P²

But a1 + a2 = a, the semi-major axis (assuming circular orbits).

And from the velocity amplitudes, K1 = 2 π a1 / P, K2 = 2 π a2 / P.

So a1 = (K1 P) / (2 π ), a2 = (K2 P) / (2 π )

So a = a1 + a2 = ( (K1 + K2) P ) / (2 π )

Substituting into Kepler's law:

M_total = (4 π² / G) * ( a^3 ) / P²

= (4 π²)/(G) * ( ( (K1+K2) P )/(2 π ) )^3 / P^2

= (4 π² )/(G) * ( (K1+K2)^3 P^3 ) / (8 π^3) ) ) / P^2

Simplify:

= (4 π² * (K1+K2)^3 P^3) ) / (8 π^3 G P^2 )

= ( (4/8) π² / π^3 ) * (K1+K2)^3 * P^3 / (G P^2 )

Simplify 4/8 → 1/2.

And π²/π^3 → 1/π.

So:

= ( (1/2) * (1/π) ) * (K1+K2)^3 * P )

= ( (K1+K2)^3 * P ) / ( 2 π G )

Ah, so the formula I used earlier is correct. So the mass ratio is as I calculated: 0.432.

So system_1's mass is approximately 0.43 times that of system_2. So system_1 is less massive than system_2 by a factor of ~0.43.

But the question is asking by what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2. So if it's 0.43 times, then system_1 is less massive. But the options are A) ~0.4, B) ~0.6, C) ~1.2, D) ~0.7.

So the ratio M1/M2 is ~0.43, which is option A) ~0.4.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute the exact value to be precise.

15^3 is 3375, and 25^3 is 15625.

So (15^3 * 2) / (25^3 * 1 )= (3375 *2 ) / (15625 * 1 )=6750 / 15625.

Compute 6750 ÷15625.

Let me compute 15625 × 0.432 = 15625 * 0.4 = 6250; 15625 × 0.032 = 500 → total 6250+500=6750. Yes, so 15625 × 0.432 =6750 → so 6750/15625=0.432.

So the ratio is 0.432, approximately 0.43. So the factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is 0.43, which is about 0.4. So the answer would be option A) ~0.4.

But wait, let me think again. Because the problem states that the periods are the time between two consecutive primary eclipses. For eclipsing binaries, the period is the orbital period. So that's correct.

Wait, but another point: The formula I used gives the sum of the masses. So each system's total mass is calculated correctly. So system_1 has a total mass of 0.43 * system_2's mass.

Therefore, system_1 is about 0.4 times as massive as system_2.

But the question is: By what factor is system_1 more massive than system_2?

So the factor would be 0.43, which is approximately 0.4. So answer A.


To determine by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, we analyze the given data using the relationship between radial velocity amplitudes, orbital periods, and total system mass. The total mass of a binary system can be expressed as:

\[
M_{\text{total}} = \frac{(K_1 + K_2)^3 \cdot P}{2 \pi G}
\]

where \(K_1\) and \(K_2\) are the radial velocity amplitudes of the two stars, \(P\) is the orbital period, and \(G\) is the gravitational constant. Since the ratio of the masses depends only on the relative values of \((K_1 + K_2)^3 \cdot P\), the constants \(G\) and \(2\pi\) cancel out when comparing the two systems.

### System_1:
- \(K_1 = 10 \, \text{km/s}, K_2 = 5 \, \text{km/s}\)
- \(K_1 + K_2 = 15 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Orbital period \(P_1 = 2 \, \text{years}\)

### System_2:
- \(K_1 = 15 \, \text{km/s}, K_2 = 10 \, \text{km/s}\)
- \(K_1 + K_2 = 25 \, \text{km/s}\)
- Orbital period \(P_2 = 1 \, \text{year}\)

The ratio of the total masses is:

\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{(K_{1,1} + K_{2,1})^3 \cdot P_1}{(K_{1,2} + K_{2,2})^3 \cdot P_2}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{(15)^3 \cdot 2}{(25)^3 \cdot 1}
\]

\[
\frac{M_{\text{total,1}}}{M_{\text{total,2}}} = \frac{3375 \cdot 2}{15625 \cdot 1} = \frac{6750}{15625} \approx 0.432
\]

Thus, system_1 is approximately \(0.43\) times as massive as system_2. Since the question asks by what factor system_1 is more massive than system_2, the answer is approximately \(0.4\).

### Final Answer:
The factor by which system_1 is more massive than system_2 is approximately **0.4**.
