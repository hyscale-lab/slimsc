Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about a star that has some dark spots on one hemisphere. The star's radius is the same as the Sun's, and the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The situation is causing brightness variations that look similar to an exoplanet transit. The question is, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet to produce the same amplitude in the light curve if there were no spots?

Hmm, so the key here is to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to the variation caused by an exoplanet transit. Then, find the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius.

I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The depth of the dip in brightness is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. The formula is usually delta F = (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (F_star / F_planet), but wait, no, actually, for a transit, the flux dip is (R_p / R_s)^2, because it's the area blocked. But wait, in this case, the star is spotted, so the spots cause a dip in brightness as well.

Wait, let me think. The star's overall brightness isn't uniform because of the spots. The spots are cooler, so when the spotted hemisphere comes into view, the total brightness drops a bit. The problem says that the observed brightness variation is similar to an exoplanet transit. So the amplitude of the variation caused by the spots must be the same as the variation caused by a planet.

So I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots and set that equal to the amplitude caused by the planet. Then solve for R_planet / R_star.

Let me break it down. The star's total flux without spots is F = 4πR²σT_eff^4. But when spots are present, part of the surface is emitting less flux.

The filling factor here is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere area is covered by spots. Wait, no: the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So if the hemisphere is the area being considered, and the filling factor is 20%, then the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Wait, but each hemisphere of the star is a sphere, so the total area is 4πR², so each hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR² area.

Each spot is cooler: Teff of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K.

The flux from the star without spots would be F0 = σT_eff^4 * (4πR²) / (4π) )? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of flux per unit area. The star emits flux F0 = σ T_eff^4, and the spots emit F_spot = σ (T_eff - 1000)^4? Wait, no: the problem says the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spot temperature is T_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K.

So the total flux from the star when spots are visible is F = (F0 * (1 - f) ) + (F_spot * f), where f is the filling factor, 0.2.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The star's surface without spots emits F0 = σ T_eff^4. The spots, which have a smaller area (f times the hemisphere), emit F_spot = σ (T_spot)^4.

So the total flux from the star when the hemisphere with spots is facing us is:

F_spotty = F0 * (1 - f) + F_spot * f.

And when the other hemisphere is facing us, which has no spots, the flux is F0.

But wait, when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view and goes away, causing a dip in brightness. So the maximum brightness is F0, and the minimum is F_spotty.

The change in flux ΔF is F0 - F_spotty. Let me compute that.

Compute F_spotty:

F_spotty = F0 * (1 - f) + (F0_spot) * f.

Wait, F0 is the flux per unit area for the star's surface. The spots have a lower flux per unit area. So F0_spot = σ (5000)^4, while F0 = σ (6000)^4.

So F_spotty = F0 * [ (1 - f) + (F0_spot / F0) * f ].

Let me compute F0_spot / F0 = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

Calculating that: 5^4 is 625, 6^4 is 1296. So 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So F_spotty = F0 * [ (1 - 0.2) + 0.48225 * 0.2 ].

Compute that:

1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

0.48225 * 0.2 = 0.09645.

Adding 0.8 and 0.09645 gives 0.89645.

So F_spotty = F0 * 0.89645.

Then, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is 0.89645 F0.

When the star rotates and the other hemisphere comes into view, the flux is F0.

Wait, no: the star's total flux is the sum of all the surface. When one hemisphere is spotted, and the other isn't, but only one hemisphere is spotty. So are we considering the situation where the star's rotation causes the spotty hemisphere to face us (so the spots are visible) or not? Wait, the star is observed as it rotates, so the spotty hemisphere comes into view and then goes away, causing a dip in brightness.

But perhaps the question is considering the maximum and minimum flux from this. Wait, the problem says that the photometric observations show periodic variations because of rotational modulation. So when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the star's brightness is lower, and when it's not, it's higher.

But I think the way to model it is that the star's brightness varies between F0 (when the spotty hemisphere is not visible) and F_spotty (when it is visible). The amplitude of the variation is the difference between these two.

Wait, no. Wait, when the star is viewed such that one hemisphere is visible, and the other is not. If the star is a perfect sphere, then when you're looking at it, you see half of it (the hemisphere facing you). So if the other hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere comes into view, replacing the previously visible hemisphere. So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is lower, and when it's not, it's higher.

Wait, but the star's entire surface isn't spotty. Only one hemisphere is partially spotty, with 20% filling. So when the spotty hemisphere is the one we're seeing, the flux is F_spotty = F0 * (1 - f) + F_spot * f. When the other hemisphere (unspotted) comes into view, the flux is F0 (since it's 100% unspotted).

Wait, no. Because each hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface. So when the spotty hemisphere is in view, the flux contribution is 0.5 * F_spotty + 0.5 * F_unspotted. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each hemisphere is half the star. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the star's surface is divided into two hemispheres. One hemisphere has spots covering 20% of its area. The other hemisphere is completely unspotted. So when the spotty hemisphere is the one we're looking at, the flux is (0.2 * F_spot + 0.8 * F0) for that hemisphere, and 0 for the other hemisphere? No, no, because each hemisphere contributes half of the star's light.

Wait, perhaps I should model the star as being made up of two regions: the spotty hemisphere and the unspotted hemisphere. When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is the sum of the flux from the spotty hemisphere and the flux from the unspotted hemisphere.

Wait, no, because the star is a sphere, and when you look at it, you see only one hemisphere. So when the spotty hemisphere is the one we see, we get the flux of that hemisphere. When the star rotates, the other hemisphere comes into view, which is unspotted.

Wait, no, the star is a sphere. Each point on the surface contributes to the flux. So the total flux when viewing a hemisphere is the sum of the flux from all the points in that hemisphere.

So the star's total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is the sum of the flux from the spotty hemisphere and the flux from the other hemisphere (which is unspotted). Wait, no. No, because as you look at the star, you can only see one hemisphere at a time. So when the spotty hemisphere is the one you're viewing, you see the flux from that hemisphere (which has spots), and when it's the other hemisphere, you don't. So the total flux when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is F_spotty_hemisphere, and when the other hemisphere is facing us, it's F_unspotted_hemisphere.

Wait, but each hemisphere has an area of 2π R². The spotty hemisphere has spots covering 20% of its area, so the flux from that hemisphere is F_hemi = [ (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot ] * (2π R²) ?

Wait, perhaps the star's flux when the spotty hemisphere is in view is F1 = [ (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot ] * (Area of hemisphere) / (Area of entire star) ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this differently.

The star's total flux without any spots would be F0_total = 4π R² * σ T_eff^4.

When part of the star is spotted, the flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F1.

The spotty hemisphere has an area of 2π R². Of this, 20% (f=0.2) is covered by spots. So the area of the spots on that hemisphere is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

The flux from the spotty hemisphere is:

F1 = [ (1-f) * F0 + f * F_spot ] * (2π R²) / (4π R²) ) ?

Wait, no. Because the star's total flux is proportional to the sum of all the areas multiplied by their respective fluxes per unit area.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute it as:

The star's flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is the sum of the flux from the spotty part and the flux from the unspotted part.

But the unspotted part would be the rest of the star. Wait, no. Because when you're looking at the star, you're only seeing one hemisphere. So the spotty hemisphere's flux is F_spotty_hemi, and the other hemisphere is not visible, so it doesn't contribute. Wait, no, because the other hemisphere is the part of the star that's on the opposite side. So when you look at the star, you only see the hemisphere facing you. So if that hemisphere is spotty, you get its flux. If it's the other hemisphere that's spotty, but you're looking at the unspotted one, then you don't see the spots.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think about it this way: when the star is viewed from Earth, the hemisphere that's facing us can be either the spotty one or the unspotted one. So when the spotty hemisphere is in view, the flux is lower because some of the surface is cooler. When the unspotted hemisphere is in view, the flux is higher.

So the brightness variation would be the difference between these two fluxes.

So the maximum flux is F_max = F_unspotted_hemi = 2π R² * F0. Because the unspotted hemisphere is entirely at T_eff.

The minimum flux is F_min = [ (1-f) * F0 + f * F_spot ] * 2π R².

Because the spotty hemisphere's flux is (1-f) F0 (unspotted part) plus f F_spot (spotted part), and we multiply by the area of the hemisphere (2π R²) and then divide by the total area (4π R²) to get the fraction? Wait, perhaps not. Hmm.

Wait, the entire star's surface is 4π R². When the spotty hemisphere is in view, you're seeing 2π R² of it. The spotty hemisphere has some spots. So the flux from the spotty hemisphere is:

F_spotty_hemi = ( (1-f) * F0 + f * F_spot ) * (2π R²) / (4π R²) ) * F0_total ?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of fractions.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = 4π R² σ T_eff^4.

When a hemisphere is spotty, with 20% of its area covered by spots, the flux when that hemisphere is in view is:

F1 = [ (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot ] * (1/2)

Because the hemisphere is half the star's surface. Let me compute this.

F0 = σ (6000)^4.

F_spot = σ (5000)^4.

So F_spot / F0 = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So f = 0.2.

So F1 = [ (1 - 0.2) * 1 + 0.2 * 0.48225 ] * 0.5 * F0.

Wait, no. Let me compute the flux when the spotty hemisphere is in view.

The flux from the spotty hemisphere is:

F_spotty_hemi = (0.8 * F0 + 0.2 * F_spot) * (area of hemisphere / area of star).

Wait, the area of the hemisphere is 2π R², the area of the star is 4π R². So the fraction is 0.5.

So F_spotty_hemi = [0.8 F0 + 0.2 F_spot] * 0.5.

Similarly, when the unspotted hemisphere is in view, the flux is F_unspotty_hemi = F0 * 0.5.

So the maximum flux is F_unspotty_hemi = F0 * 0.5.

The minimum flux is F_spotty_hemi = [0.8 F0 + 0.2 F_spot] * 0.5.

The amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between maximum and minimum divided by the maximum, I think. Or the change in flux.

Wait, the amplitude is the depth of the dip, which is (F_max - F_min) / F_max.

Wait, let's compute F_max and F_min.

F_max = F_unspotty_hemi = 0.5 F0.

F_min = [0.8 F0 + 0.2 (0.48225 F0) ] * 0.5.

Compute the expression inside:

0.8 F0 + 0.2 * 0.48225 F0 = F0 [ 0.8 + 0.09645 ] = F0 (0.89645).

Multiply by 0.5: F_min = 0.5 * 0.89645 F0 = 0.448225 F0.

So the amplitude (depth) of the dip is F_max - F_min = 0.5 F0 - 0.448225 F0 = 0.051775 F0.

Wait, but the amplitude is usually expressed as the relative change. So the fractional change is (F_max - F_min) / F_max.

So fractional amplitude = (0.051775 F0) / (0.5 F0) ) = 0.051775 / 0.5 ≈ 0.10355, or about 10.355%.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the scenario is that the brightness variation due to spots is similar to that of an exoplanet transit. So the amplitude of the spot-induced variation is 10.355% of F0.

Now, the same amplitude should be produced by a planet transit.

When a planet transits in front of the star, the flux dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2, assuming the planet's albedo is zero and it doesn't emit light. The dip is because the planet blocks some starlight.

Wait, no. The dip is (R_p / R_s)^2, because the area blocked is the area of the planet.

So the amplitude (depth) of the transit is (R_p / R_s)^2.

Wait, but in this problem, the star's flux variation from spots is 10.355% of F0, so the amplitude is about 0.10355 in relative terms.

So if the planet's transit causes the same relative amplitude, then (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.10355.

So R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, which is approximately 0.32.

Wait, let me compute the square root of 0.10355.

Square of 0.32 is 0.1024. 0.32^2 = 0.1024. 0.322^2 = (0.32 + 0.002)^2 = 0.32^2 + 2*0.32*0.002 + 0.002^2 = 0.1024 + 0.00128 + 0.000004 = 0.103684. Oh, which is just over 0.10355. So sqrt(0.10355) is approximately 0.3218, so about 0.322, which is ~0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation of the flux variation.

Wait, F_max is when the unspotty hemisphere is in view, so F_max =0.5 F0.

F_min when the spotty hemisphere is in view is [0.8 F0 + 0.2 * 0.48225 F0 ] * 0.5.

Which is [0.8 + 0.09645 ] * 0.5 F0 = 0.89645 * 0.5 F0 = 0.448225 F0.

F_max - F_min = 0.5 F0 - 0.448225 F0 = 0.051775 F0.

The dip is (0.051775 F0) / (0.5 F0) ) * 100% = 10.355% dip.

So the amplitude is 10.355% of F0, which is the same as (R_p / R_s)^2.

So R_p/Rs = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.322.

So the closest option is D) ~0.32.

To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the observed star with dark spots, we analyze the flux changes caused by the spots and equate them to the flux change caused by a planet transit.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is spotty, with a filling factor \( f = 0.2 \).
   - Spots are cooler, with \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Flux Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The star's total flux without spots is \( F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).
   - The flux from the spots is \( F_{\text{spot}} = \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 \).
   - The flux ratio is \( \frac{F_{\text{spot}}}{F_0} = \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 \approx 0.48225 \).

   When the spotty hemisphere is visible:
   \[
   F_{\text{min}} = \left[(1 - f) F_0 + f F_{\text{spot}}\right] \cdot 0.5
   \]
   Substituting \( f = 0.2 \) and \( \frac{F_{\text{spot}}}{F_0} \approx 0.48225 \):
   \[
   F_{\text{min}} = \left[0.8 F_0 + 0.2 \cdot 0.48225 F_0\right] \cdot 0.5 = \left[0.89645 F_0\right] \cdot 0.5 = 0.448225 F_0
   \]

   When the unspotted hemisphere is visible:
   \[
   F_{\text{max}} = 0.5 F_0
   \]

   The amplitude of the brightness variation is:
   \[
   \Delta F = F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}} = 0.5 F_0 - 0.448225 F_0 = 0.051775 F_0
   \]

   The relative amplitude is:
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{max}}} = \frac{0.051775 F_0}{0.5 F_0} = 0.10355 \, \text{(or 10.355%)}.
   \]

3. **Flux Variation Due to a Planet Transit**:
   The flux dip caused by a planet transit is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2
   \]

   Setting the amplitude of the planet transit equal to the amplitude caused by the spots:
   \[
   \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.10355
   \]

   Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
   \[
   \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.322
   \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately \( 0.32 \). The closest option is:

Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

So, the question is about a star that has some dark spots on one hemisphere. The star's radius is the same as the Sun's, and the spots cover 20% of that hemisphere. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. The situation is causing brightness variations that look similar to an exoplanet transit. The question is, what would be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet to produce the same amplitude in the light curve if there were no spots?

Hmm, so the key here is to compare the brightness variation caused by the spots to the variation caused by an exoplanet transit. Then, find the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius.

I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light. The depth of the dip in brightness is proportional to the square of the ratio of the planet's radius to the star's radius. The formula is usually delta F = (R_planet / R_star)^2 * (F_star / F_planet), but wait, no, actually, for a transit, the flux dip is (R_p / R_s)^2, because it's the area blocked. But wait, in this case, the star is spotted, so the spots cause a dip in brightness as well.

Wait, let me think. The star's overall brightness isn't uniform because of the spots. The spots are cooler, so when the spotted hemisphere comes into view, the total brightness drops a bit. The problem says that the observed brightness variation is similar to an exoplanet transit. So the amplitude of the variation caused by the spots must be the same as the variation caused by a planet.

So I need to calculate the amplitude of the brightness variation caused by the spots and set that equal to the amplitude caused by the planet. Then solve for R_planet / R_star.

Let me break it down. The star's total flux without spots is F = 4πR²σT_eff^4. But when spots are present, part of the surface is emitting less flux.

The filling factor here is 20%, which I think means that 20% of the hemisphere area is covered by spots. Wait, no: the problem says "one hemisphere is covered in dark spots with a filling factor of 20%." Wait, filling factor is the fraction of the surface covered by spots. So if the hemisphere is the area being considered, and the filling factor is 20%, then the spots cover 20% of the hemisphere's area.

Wait, but each hemisphere of the star is a sphere, so the total area is 4πR², so each hemisphere is 2πR². The spots cover 20% of that, so 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4πR² area.

Each spot is cooler: Teff of the star is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so 5000 K.

The flux from the star without spots would be F0 = σT_eff^4 * (4πR²) / (4π) )? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of flux per unit area. The star emits flux F0 = σ T_eff^4, and the spots emit F_spot = σ (T_eff - 1000)^4? Wait, no: the problem says the spots exhibit a temperature difference of 1000 K. So the spot temperature is T_spot = 6000 - 1000 = 5000 K.

So the total flux from the star when spots are visible is F = (F0 * (1 - f) ) + (F_spot * f), where f is the filling factor, 0.2.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. The star's surface without spots emits F0 = σ T_eff^4. The spots, which have a smaller area (f times the hemisphere), emit F_spot = σ (T_spot)^4.

So the total flux from the star when the hemisphere with spots is facing us is:

F_spotty = F0 * (1 - f) + F_spot * f.

And when the other hemisphere is facing us, which has no spots, the flux is F0.

But wait, when the star rotates, the hemisphere with spots comes into view and goes away, causing a dip in brightness. So the maximum brightness is F0, and the minimum is F_spotty.

The change in flux ΔF is F0 - F_spotty. Let me compute that.

Compute F_spotty:

F_spotty = F0 * (1 - f) + (F0_spot) * f.

Wait, F0 is the flux per unit area for the star's surface. The spots have a lower flux per unit area. So F0_spot = σ (5000)^4, while F0 = σ (6000)^4.

So F_spotty = F0 * [ (1 - f) + (F0_spot / F0) * f ].

Let me compute F0_spot / F0 = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4.

Calculating that: 5^4 is 625, 6^4 is 1296. So 625/1296 ≈ 0.48225.

So F_spotty = F0 * [ (1 - 0.2) + 0.48225 * 0.2 ].

Compute that:

1 - 0.2 = 0.8.

0.48225 * 0.2 = 0.09645.

Adding 0.8 and 0.09645 gives 0.89645.

So F_spotty = F0 * 0.89645.

Then, when the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the flux is 0.89645 F0.

When the star rotates and the other hemisphere comes into view, the flux is F0.

Wait, no: the star's total flux is the sum of all the surface. When one hemisphere is spotted, and the other isn't, but only one hemisphere is spotty. So are we considering the situation where the star's rotation causes the spotty hemisphere to face us (so the spots are visible) or not?

If the star is a perfect sphere, then when you're looking at it, you see half of it (the hemisphere facing you). So if the other hemisphere is spotty, when the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere comes into view, replacing the previously visible hemisphere. So when the spotty hemisphere is visible, the flux is lower, and when it's not, it's higher.

So when the spotty hemisphere is the one we're seeing, the flux is F_spotty = F0 * (1 - f) + F_spot * f. When the other hemisphere (unspotted) comes into view, the flux is F0 (since it's 100% unspotted).

Wait, no. Because each hemisphere is 50% of the star's surface. So when the spotty hemisphere is in view, the flux contribution is 0.5 * F_spotty + 0.5 * F_unspotted. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each hemisphere is half the star. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the star's surface is divided into two hemispheres. One hemisphere has spots covering 20% of its area. The other hemisphere is completely unspotted. So when the spotty hemisphere is the one we're looking at, the flux is (0.2 * F_spot + 0.8 * F0) for that hemisphere, and 0 for the other hemisphere? No, no, because each hemisphere contributes half of the star's light.

Wait, perhaps I should model the star as being made up of two regions: the spotty hemisphere and the unspotted hemisphere. When the spotty hemisphere is facing us, the total flux is the sum of the flux from the spotty hemisphere and the flux from the unspotted hemisphere.

Wait, no, because the star is a sphere, and when you look at it, you see only one hemisphere. So when the spotty hemisphere is the one we see, we get the flux of that hemisphere. When the star rotates, the other hemisphere comes into view, which is unspotted.

Wait, no, the star is a sphere. Each point on the surface contributes to the flux. So the total flux when viewing a hemisphere is the sum of the flux from all the points in that hemisphere.

So the star's total flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is the sum of the flux from the spotty hemisphere and the flux from the other hemisphere (which is unspotted). Wait, no. No, because as you look at the star, you can only see one hemisphere at a time. So when the spotty hemisphere is the one you're viewing, you see the flux from that hemisphere (which has spots), and when it's the other hemisphere, you don't. So the total flux when the spotty hemisphere is facing us is F_spotty_hemisphere, and when the other hemisphere is facing us, it's F_unspotted_hemisphere.

Wait, but each hemisphere has an area of 2π R². The spotty hemisphere has spots covering 20% of its area, so the flux from that hemisphere is F_hemi = [ (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot ] * (2π R²) ?

Wait, perhaps the star's flux when the spotty hemisphere is in view is F1 = [ (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot ] * (Area of hemisphere) / (Area of entire star) ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this differently.

The star's total flux without any spots would be F0_total = 4π R² * σ T_eff^4.

When part of the star is spotted, the flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is F1.

The spotty hemisphere has an area of 2π R². Of this, 20% (f=0.2) is covered by spots. So the area of the spots on that hemisphere is 0.2 * 2π R² = 0.4 π R².

The flux from the spotty hemisphere is:

F1 = [ (1-f) * F0 + f * F_spot ] * (2π R²) / (4π R²) ) ?

Wait, no. Because the star's total flux is proportional to the sum of all the areas multiplied by their respective fluxes per unit area.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute it as:

The star's flux when the spotty hemisphere is visible is the sum of the flux from the spotty part and the flux from the unspotted part.

But the unspotted part would be the rest of the star. Wait, no. Because when you're looking at the star, you're only seeing one hemisphere. So the spotty hemisphere's flux is F_spotty_hemi, and the other hemisphere is not visible, so it doesn't contribute. Wait, no, because the other hemisphere is the part of the star that's on the opposite side. So when you look at the star, you only see the hemisphere facing you. So if that hemisphere is spotty, you get its flux. If it's the other hemisphere that's spotty, but you're looking at the unspotted one, then you don't see the spots.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me think about it this way: when the star is viewed from Earth, the hemisphere that's facing us can be either the spotty one or the unspotted one. So when the spotty hemisphere is in view, the flux is lower because some of the surface is cooler. When the unspotted hemisphere is in view, the flux is higher.

So the brightness variation would be the difference between these two fluxes.

So the maximum flux is F_max = F_unspotted_hemi = 2π R² * F0. Because the unspotted hemisphere is entirely at T_eff.

The minimum flux is F_min = [ (1-f) * F0 + f * F_spot ] * 2π R².

Because the spotty hemisphere's flux is (1-f) F0 (unspotted part) plus f F_spot (spotted part), and we multiply by the area of the hemisphere (2π R²) and then divide by the total area (4π R²) to get the fraction? Wait, perhaps not. Hmm.

Wait, the entire star's surface is 4π R². When the spotty hemisphere is in view, you're seeing 2π R² of it. The spotty hemisphere has some spots. So the flux from the spotty hemisphere is:

F_spotty_hemi = ( (1-f) * F0 + f * F_spot ) * (2π R²) / (4π R²) ) * F0_total ?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of fractions.

The star's total flux without any spots is F0 = 4π R² σ T_eff^4.

When a hemisphere is spotty, with 20% of its area covered by spots, the flux when that hemisphere is in view is:

F1 = [ (1 - f) * F0 + f * F_spot ] * (1/2)

Because the hemisphere is half the star's surface. Let me compute this.

F0 = σ (6000)^4.

F_spot = σ (5000)^4.

So F_spot / F0 = (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈ 0.48225.

So f = 0.2.

So F1 = [ (1 - 0.2) * 1 + 0.2 * 0.48225 ] * 0.5 * F0.

Wait, no. Let me compute the flux when the spotty hemisphere is in view.

The flux from the spotty hemisphere is:

F_spotty_hemi = (0.8 * F0 + 0.2 * F_spot) * (area of hemisphere / area of star).

Wait, the area of the hemisphere is 2π R², the area of the star is 4π R². So the fraction is 0.5.

So F_spotty_hemi = [0.8 F0 + 0.2 F_spot] * 0.5.

Similarly, when the unspotted hemisphere is in view, the flux is F_unspotty_hemi = F0 * 0.5.

So the maximum flux is F_unspotty_hemi = F0 * 0.5.

The minimum flux is F_spotty_hemi = [0.8 F0 + 0.2 F_spot] * 0.5.

The amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference between maximum and minimum divided by the maximum, I think. Or the change in flux.

Wait, the amplitude is the depth of the dip, which is (F_max - F_min) / F_max.

Wait, let's compute F_max and F_min.

F_max = F_unspotty_hemi = 0.5 F0.

F_min = [0.8 F0 + 0.2 (0.48225 F0) ] * 0.5.

Compute the expression inside:

0.8 F0 + 0.2 * 0.48225 F0 = F0 [ 0.8 + 0.09645 ] = F0 (0.89645).

Multiply by 0.5: F_min = 0.5 * 0.89645 F0 = 0.448225 F0.

So the amplitude (depth) of the dip is F_max - F_min = 0.5 F0 - 0.448225 F0 = 0.051775 F0.

Wait, but the amplitude is usually expressed as the relative change. So the fractional change is (F_max - F_min) / F_max.

So fractional amplitude = (0.051775 F0) / (0.5 F0) ) = 0.051775 / 0.5 ≈ 0.10355, or about 10.355%.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the scenario is that the brightness variation due to spots is similar to that of an exoplanet transit. So the amplitude of the spot-induced variation is 10.355% of F0.

Now, the same amplitude should be produced by a planet transit.

When a planet transits in front of the star, the flux dip is (R_planet / R_star)^2, assuming the planet's albedo is zero and it doesn't emit light. The dip is because the planet blocks some starlight.

Wait, no. The dip is (R_p / R_s)^2, because the area blocked is the area of the planet.

So the amplitude (depth) of the transit is (R_p / R_s)^2.

Wait, but in this problem, the star's flux variation from spots is 10.355% of F0, so the amplitude is about 0.10355 in relative terms.

So if the planet's transit causes the same relative amplitude, then (R_p / R_s)^2 = 0.10355.

So R_p / R_s = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.3218, which is approximately 0.32.

Wait, let me compute the square root of 0.10355.

Square of 0.32 is 0.1024. 0.32^2 = 0.1024. 0.322^2 = (0.32 + 0.002)^2 = 0.32^2 + 2*0.32*0.002 + 0.002^2 = 0.1024 + 0.00128 + 0.000004 = 0.103684. Oh, which is just over 0.10355. So sqrt(0.10355) is approximately 0.3218, so about 0.322, which is ~0.32.

Looking at the options, option D is ~0.32. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculation of the flux variation.

Wait, F_max is when the unspotty hemisphere is in view, so F_max =0.5 F0.

F_min when the spotty hemisphere is in view is [0.8 F0 + 0.2 * 0.48225 F0 ] * 0.5.

Which is [0.8 + 0.09645 ] * 0.5 F0 = 0.89645 * 0.5 F0 = 0.448225 F0.

F_max - F_min = 0.5 F0 - 0.448225 F0 = 0.051775 F0.

The dip is (0.051775 F0) / (0.5 F0) ) * 100% = 10.355% dip.

So the amplitude is 10.355% of F0, which is the same as (R_p / R_s)^2.

So R_p/Rs = sqrt(0.10355) ≈ 0.322.

So the closest option is D) ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same brightness variation as the observed star with dark spots, we analyze the flux changes caused by the spots and equate them to the flux change caused by a planet transit.

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:
   - Radius: \( R_{\text{star}} = R_{\odot} \) (same as the Sun).
   - Effective temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).
   - One hemisphere is spotty, with a filling factor \( f = 0.2 \).
   - Spots are cooler, with \( T_{\text{spot}} = T_{\text{eff}} - 1000 = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Flux Variation Due to Spots**:
   - The star's total flux without spots is \( F_0 = \sigma T_{\text{eff}}^4 \).
   - The flux from the spots is \( F_{\text{spot}} = \sigma T_{\text{spot}}^4 \).
   - The flux ratio is \( \frac{F_{\text{spot}}}{F_0} = \left(\frac{T_{\text{spot}}}{T_{\text{eff}}}\right)^4 = \left(\frac{5000}{6000}\right)^4 \approx 0.48225 \).

   When the spotty hemisphere is visible:
   \[
   F_{\text{min}} = \left[(1 - f) F_0 + f F_{\text{spot}}\right] \cdot 0.5
   \]
   Substituting \( f = 0.2 \) and \( \frac{F_{\text{spot}}}{F_0} \approx 0.48225 \):
   \[
   F_{\text{min}} = \left[0.8 F_0 + 0.2 \cdot 0.48225 F_0\right] \cdot 0.5 = \left[0.89645 F_0\right] \cdot 0.5 = 0.448225 F_0
   \]

   When the unspotted hemisphere is visible:
   \[
   F_{\text{max}} = 0.5 F_0
   \]

   The amplitude of the brightness variation is:
   \[
   \Delta F = F_{\text{max}} - F_{\text{min}} = 0.5 F_0 - 0.448225 F_0 = 0.051775 F_0
   \]

   The relative amplitude is:
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{max}}} = \frac{0.051775 F_0}{0.5 F_0} = 0.10355 \, \text{(or 10.355%)}.
   \]

3. **Flux Variation Due to a Planet Transit**:
   The flux dip caused by a planet transit is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:
   \[
   \text{Amplitude} = \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2
   \]

   Setting the amplitude of the planet transit equal to the amplitude caused by the spots:
   \[
   \left(\frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}}\right)^2 = 0.10355
   \]

   Solving for \( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \):
   \[
   \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} = \sqrt{0.10355} \approx 0.322
   \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet relative to the host star is approximately \( 0.32 \). The closest option is:
