Okay, so I've got this vector calculus problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I think I can figure it out by breaking it down step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The problem is about evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field f(r) within a sphere of radius R. The field falls off radially as 1/r², and it only has a radial component. So, the setup is in spherical coordinates, I suppose.

First, I remember that the divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates is a bit different from Cartesian. Since the field here only has a radial component, maybe that simplifies things. Let me recall the formula for divergence in spherical coordinates. Oh right, for a vector field A with components A_r, A_θ, A_φ, the divergence is (1/r²) d(r² A_r)/dr + (1/(r sinθ)) d(A_θ sinθ)/dθ + (1/(r sinθ)) (1/φ) dA_φ/dφ. But in this case, the field only has a radial component, so the other terms (A_θ and A_φ) are zero. So the divergence simplifies to (1/r²) d(r² A_r)/dr.

Wait, but in this problem, the vector field f(r) is given. Let me be precise. So f(r) is a vector field whose magnitude is 1/r² and it's only along the radial direction. That means f(r) can be written as (F_r) r_hat, where F_r is the radial component. So F_r is 1/r², because the magnitude is 1/r² and it's along the radial direction. So F_r = 1/r².

So to find the divergence, I plug into the formula. The divergence ∇·f would be (1/r²) d/dr (r² * F_r). Let's calculate that.

F_r is 1/r², so r² * F_r = r² * (1/r²) = 1. Then the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. So ∇·f = (1/r²) * 0 = 0. That's interesting.

Wait, but wait a second. If the divergence is zero everywhere except possibly at the origin, then the volume integral over any volume not including the origin would be zero. But in this case, the sphere includes the origin because R is the radius of the sphere. Oh wait, but wait, does the divergence actually exist at the origin? Because the field is 1/r², which at r=0 would be undefined. So perhaps we're considering the origin as a point where the field is singular.

Hmm, but in terms of the integral, if the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at a single point (the origin), then the integral over the entire volume (including the origin) would be zero? Or is there a Dirac delta function involved here?

Wait, I remember something about Gauss's law and point charges. Oh wait, wait, in the case of electric fields, the divergence is related to the charge density. For a point charge, the divergence of E is rho/epsilon_0, and rho is a delta function at the origin. But in this problem, are we dealing with something analogous?

Wait, our vector field f(r) is similar to an electric field produced by a point charge. Because the electric field of a point charge is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q r_hat)/r². The divergence of E would then be (1/(4πε₀)) q δ³(r), where δ³ is the three-dimensional Dirac delta function. Because when you take the divergence in spherical coordinates for E, you end up with a term that's a delta function at the origin.

So in this problem, the vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) r_hat. So it's similar to the electric field of a charge, but without the constants. In that case, what's the divergence of f(r)?

Let me compute it properly. As I did before, the divergence would be (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)) ) = (1/r²) d/dr (1) ) = 0. But that's only for r not equal to zero. At r=0, the field isn't defined, but in the integral, we have to consider the entire volume, including the origin.

Wait, so when you compute the divergence ∇·f, you get zero everywhere except at r=0. But when you integrate over the volume, you have to consider the behavior at the origin.

In the case of the electric field, the integral of the divergence over a volume enclosing the origin is equal to the charge enclosed. Here, maybe a similar situation applies. But in this problem, the vector field is exactly like the electric field of a charge q = (4πε₀) * something. Wait, let me think about that.

The electric field E is (1/(4πε₀)) (q r_hat)/r². So our f(r) would be equivalent to E if f(r) = (q/(4πε₀ r²)) r_hat. But in our case, the vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) r_hat. So that would correspond to q/(4πε₀) being 1. So q = 4πε₀.

Wait, but this is probably a stretch because the problem doesn't mention any charge or electric field context. So perhaps the divergence is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's a delta function.

But wait, when I calculated the divergence, I got zero everywhere except at r=0. So in reality, the divergence is a delta function at the origin. So, ∇·f = 0 for r≠0, and it's (something) δ(r) at r=0.

Wait, but how do I find the coefficient for the delta function?

Let me think. The divergence of f(r) is zero except at the origin. But when integrating ∇·f over a volume that includes the origin, the integral becomes the flux through the surface of the volume. Wait, but another approach is to compute the integral using Gauss's law. So if I take a sphere of radius R, the integral of ∇·f over the volume is equal to the flux of f through the surface of the sphere.

Wait, Gauss's theorem (divergence theorem) says that the volume integral of the divergence is equal to the flux through the surface. So I can compute it either way.

Let me compute the flux of f through the surface of the sphere. The flux is the integral over the sphere's surface of f(r) · dA. Since f(r) is radial and the surface element dA is also radial, the dot product is just f(r) times the area element.

So f(r) at radius R is (1/R²) r_hat. The surface area of a sphere is 4πR², so the flux is (1/R²) multiplied by 4πR². That gives 4π.

So the flux is 4π. Therefore, according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral of ∇·f over the sphere is equal to this flux, which is 4π.

But wait, earlier when I computed the divergence as (1/r²) d/dr(r² (1/r²)), I got zero. So that would imply that the volume integral is zero, but that contradicts the flux approach.

Ah, I see. The mistake was in assuming that the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin. But mathematically, the divergence as computed is zero except at r=0, but in reality, the divergence has a delta function contribution at the origin.

So the divergence of f(r) is zero everywhere except at r=0, where it's a delta function scaled by some factor.

Let me compute the divergence properly. Let me write it again:

∇·f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r )

F_r = 1/r², so r² F_r = 1.

d/dr (1) = 0. So it's zero everywhere except at r=0, where the function isn't differentiable. So, mathematically, the divergence is zero for r≠0, but the integral over any volume enclosing the origin gives the flux, which is 4π.

So, what's the divergence in this case? It's that the divergence is zero except at the origin, but the integral over a volume enclosing the origin is 4π. So when integrating, the volume integral equals the flux, which is 4π.

But wait, the options given are A) 4π, B) 1, etc. So the integral equals 4π.

Wait, but wait another thought: The divergence theorem is applicable here. The integral of the divergence over the volume is equal to the flux through the surface. The flux I just calculated is 4π, so the volume integral equals 4π. So the correct answer is A) 4π.

But wait, earlier I thought the divergence is zero except at the origin, which is a point of zero volume, so the integral would be zero. But that's only true if the divergence is zero everywhere in the volume, including the origin. But in reality, the divergence isn't zero—it has a delta function at the origin.

So the correct approach is to use the divergence theorem, calculating the flux, which gives 4π. Hence, the volume integral is 4π.

Alternatively, if I were to compute the divergence in a more rigorous way, I would get that ∇·f = 4π δ³(r). Because when you integrate ∇·f over all space, it's the same as the flux through a sphere at radius R, which would be 4π for each shell, but for R approaching infinity, the flux approaches zero. Wait, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the divergence of f(r) is 4π δ³(r). Because when you integrate that over any volume that includes the origin, you get 4π times 1 (since the integral of δ³(r) is 1). So the volume integral would be 4π.

But wait, let me think about the general case. For a vector field F(r) = (f(r) r_hat) where f(r) is radial and depends only on r, the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² f(r)). So for f(r) = 1/r², r² f(r) = 1. So d/dr of 1 is zero, so divergence is zero except at r=0.

But the integral of the divergence over a volume that includes the origin is equal to the flux, which is 4π. So in reality, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin where it's a delta function. So ∇·f = 4π δ³(r). Therefore, the integral over any volume that includes the origin is 4π.

So the answer should be A) 4π.

To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field \( \mathbf{f}(r) \) inside a sphere of radius \( R \), we start by analyzing the given vector field. The field is radial, with a magnitude \( f(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \), and it has no components in the angular directions (\( \theta \) or \( \phi \)) in spherical coordinates. Thus, the vector field can be expressed as:

\[
\mathbf{f}(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \hat{r}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute the divergence of \( \mathbf{f}(r) \)
The divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates is given by:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 f_r \right),
\]

where \( f_r \) is the radial component of the field. Substituting \( f_r = \frac{1}{r^2} \), we find:

\[
r^2 f_r = r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} = 1.
\]

Taking the derivative of 1 with respect to \( r \), we get:

\[
\frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 f_r \right) = 0.
\]

Thus, the divergence is:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \cdot 0 = 0, \quad \text{for } r \neq 0.
\]

However, at \( r = 0 \), the field is singular, and the divergence has a contribution proportional to the Dirac delta function \( \delta^3(r) \). Specifically, the divergence can be expressed as:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 4\pi \delta^3(r).
\]

### Step 2: Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence
The volume integral of \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \) over the sphere of radius \( R \) is:

\[
\int_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \, dV.
\]

Since \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 4\pi \delta^3(r) \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_V 4\pi \delta^3(r) \, dV = 4\pi \int_V \delta^3(r) \, dV.
\]

The integral of the delta function over all space is 1, so:

\[
\int_V \delta^3(r) \, dV = 1.
\]

Thus, the volume integral evaluates to:

\[
\int_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \, dV = 4\pi.
\]

### Step 3: Verify using Gauss's law (divergence theorem)
The divergence theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the flux of the field through the surface of the volume. For the given vector field \( \mathbf{f}(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \hat{r} \), the flux through the surface of the sphere of radius \( R \) is:

\[
\text{Flux} = \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A}.
\]

The surface element in spherical coordinates is \( d\mathbf{A} = R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi \, \hat{r} \), and since \( \mathbf{f} \) is radial, the dot product simplifies to:

\[
\mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi = \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi.
\]

The flux becomes:

\[
\text{Flux} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi = 4\pi.
\]

This matches the result from the volume integral, confirming that the volume integral of \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \) is indeed \( 4\pi \).

### Final Answer:
The volume integral of the divergence of the vector field \( \mathbf{f}(r) \) inside the sphere of radius \( R \) is \( 4\pi \).

But the integral of the divergence over a volume that includes the origin is equal to the flux, which is 4π. So in reality, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin where it's a delta function. So ∇·f = 4π δ³(r). Therefore, the integral over any volume that includes the origin is 4π.

So the answer should be A) 4π.


To evaluate the volume integral of the divergence of the vector field \( \mathbf{f}(r) \) inside a sphere of radius \( R \), we start by analyzing the given vector field. The field is radial, with a magnitude \( f(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \), and it has no components in the angular directions (\( \theta \) or \( \phi \)) in spherical coordinates. Thus, the vector field can be expressed as:

\[
\mathbf{f}(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \hat{r}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute the divergence of \( \mathbf{f}(r) \)
The divergence of a vector field in spherical coordinates is given by:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 f_r \right),
\]

where \( f_r \) is the radial component of the field. Substituting \( f_r = \frac{1}{r^2} \), we find:

\[
r^2 f_r = r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} = 1.
\]

Taking the derivative of 1 with respect to \( r \), we get:

\[
\frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 f_r \right) = 0.
\]

Thus, the divergence is:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{r^2} \cdot 0 = 0, \quad \text{for } r \neq 0.
\]

However, at \( r = 0 \), the field is singular, and the divergence has a contribution proportional to the Dirac delta function \( \delta^3(r) \). Specifically, the divergence can be expressed as:

\[
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 4\pi \delta^3(r).
\]

### Step 2: Evaluate the volume integral of the divergence
The volume integral of \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \) over the sphere of radius \( R \) is:

\[
\int_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \, dV.
\]

Since \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} = 4\pi \delta^3(r) \), the integral becomes:

\[
\int_V 4\pi \delta^3(r) \, dV = 4\pi \int_V \delta^3(r) \, dV.
\]

The integral of the delta function over all space is 1, so:

\[
\int_V \delta^3(r) \, dV = 1.
\]

Thus, the volume integral evaluates to:

\[
\int_V \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \, dV = 4\pi.
\]

### Step 3: Verify using Gauss's law (divergence theorem)
The divergence theorem states that the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field is equal to the flux of the field through the surface of the volume. For the given vector field \( \mathbf{f}(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} \hat{r} \), the flux through the surface of the sphere of radius \( R \) is:

\[
\text{Flux} = \int_S \mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A}.
\]

The surface element in spherical coordinates is \( d\mathbf{A} = R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi \, \hat{r} \), and since \( \mathbf{f} \) is radial, the dot product simplifies to:

\[
\mathbf{f} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot R^2 \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi = \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi.
\]

The flux becomes:

\[
\text{Flux} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi = 4\pi.
\]

This matches the result from the volume integral, confirming that the volume integral of \( \nabla \cdot \mathbf{f} \) is indeed \( 4\pi \).

### Final Answer:
The volume integral of the divergence of the vector field \( \mathbf{f}(r) \) inside the sphere of radius \( R \) is \( 4\pi \).
