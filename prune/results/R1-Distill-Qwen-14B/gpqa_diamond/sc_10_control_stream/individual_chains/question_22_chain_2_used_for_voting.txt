Okay, so I have this electrochemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about the behavior of oxygen as an oxidant in different solutions and how it reacts kinetically. The statement is incomplete, and I need to fill in the blanks. The options are about whether oxygen is a stronger or weaker oxidant thermodynamically and whether it reacts faster or slower kinetically.

Hmm. I remember that thermodynamic factors are about the spontaneity of a reaction, like whether a reaction is favorable based on Gibbs free energy. Kinetic factors have to do with the rate, like activation energy and how fast the reaction actually proceeds.

So the question is split into two parts: thermodynamic and kinetic aspects.

First part: Thermodynamically, oxygen is a …… oxidant in basic solutions. I think about the standard reduction potentials. In basic solutions, the concentration of H+ is lower because OH- is present. The standard reduction potential for O2 in basic solution is higher than in acidic. Oh wait, in acidic solution, the reaction is O2 + 4H+ + 4e- → 2H2O, which has a certain E°. In basic, it's O2 + 2H2O + 4e- → 4OH- with a higher E°. So higher E° means it's a stronger oxidizing agent. So in basic solutions, oxygen is a stronger oxidant than in acidic. So thermodynamically, in basic, oxygen is a stronger oxidant.

Second part: Kinetically, oxygen reacts …… in acidic solutions. Kinetics often depend on the reaction conditions and activation energy. O2 is a molecule that's not very reactive. But in acidic solutions, maybe there are protons involved which could make the reaction proceed faster? Or wait, in basic solutions, OH- might be more involved. I'm a bit fuzzy here.

Wait, I remember that O2 has lower solubility in water, but when it's in solution, how does the medium affect its reaction rate? Maybe in acidic solutions, the reaction is faster because of higher concentration of H+ ions that can participate in the reaction. Or perhaps because in acidic conditions, the reaction is more favorable, but that's thermodynamics again. No, kinetics is about the speed, not whether it's favorable.

Alternatively, maybe the activation energy is lower in acidic conditions. Let's think about the reaction in acidic. The O2 reduction in acid: O2 + 4H+ +4e- → 2H2O. The H+ ions might help in stabilizing the transition state. Whereas in basic, you have OH- which might not provide as much stabilization. So perhaps the reaction is faster in acidic solutions.

Wait, but I also remember that in basic solutions, the reaction might involve more steps or maybe the presence of OH- could act as a catalyst. Alternatively, maybe in acidic solutions, the reaction is more kinetically favorable because of the presence of H+ which helps in the electron transfer process.

Wait, another thought: The oxygen reduction reaction is more kinetically active in acidic conditions because the H+ can stabilize the transition state. I think in some cases, like the oxygen evolution reaction, the presence of H+ can lower the activation energy, making the reaction proceed faster. So in acidic solutions, the reaction would be faster.

Putting this together, the first blank is 'stronger' because basic solutions make O2 a stronger oxidant. The second blank is 'faster' because acidic solutions make the reaction proceed at a quicker rate.

Looking at the options:

A) stronger – faster → Both blanks filled with the correct terms.

Wait, the options are in pairs. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A) stronger – faster

B) stronger – slower

C) weaker – faster

D) weaker - slower

So if thermodynamically, O2 is a stronger oxidant in basic, and kinetically reacts faster in acidic, then the correct combination is stronger and faster, which is option A.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Another way to think: When the solution is basic, the oxidizing power of O2 is higher. So thermodynamically, it's a stronger oxidant. So the first part is correct as stronger.

For the kinetic part, in acidic solutions, the reaction is faster. So the second part is faster. So the combination is stronger and faster, which is option A.

But wait, another angle: Kinetics can sometimes be influenced by the concentration of ions. For example, in acidic solution, H+ is high. The reduction of O2 may involve H+ in the reaction mechanism, so higher H+ would make the reaction proceed faster. So yes, in acidic conditions, the reaction is faster.

So the correct answer should be A: stronger – faster.


--- Final Answer Content ---


Thermodynamically, the strength of oxygen as an oxidant depends on the solution's pH. In basic solutions, the standard reduction potential for oxygen is higher than in acidic solutions, making oxygen a stronger oxidant in basic conditions. This is because the reaction in basic solutions, \( \text{O}_2 + 2\text{H}_2\text{O} + 4e^- \rightarrow 4\text{OH}^- \), has a higher \( E^\circ \) compared to the reaction in acidic solutions, \( \text{O}_2 + 4\text{H}^+ + 4e^- \rightarrow 2\text{H}_2\text{O} \).

Kinetically, the reaction rate of oxygen depends on the reaction medium. In acidic solutions, the presence of \( \text{H}^+ \) ions can stabilize the transition state and lower the activation energy, making the reaction proceed faster. In contrast, in basic solutions, the reaction may proceed more slowly due to the absence of \( \text{H}^+ \) ions and the involvement of \( \text{OH}^- \), which may not stabilize the transition state as effectively.

Combining these observations, oxygen is thermodynamically a stronger oxidant in basic solutions and kinetically reacts faster in acidic solutions. The correct combination is **stronger – faster**, which corresponds to option A.
