Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The compound is an organic one, and I have to choose between four options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. 

First, I remember that NMR spectroscopy gives information about the structure based on the environment of the protons. The 1H NMR data provided is: 
- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

Let me break this down.

The 2.1 ppm singlet (3H) is probably an acetyl group (OAc), since acetates typically have a singlet around 2 ppm for the methyl group attached to the oxygen. So the compound is an acetate ester.

Next, the two other signals: the doublet at 7.0 and the doublet of quartets at 5.5. I'm thinking these are from the propenyl or butenyl group. 

Let me consider the structures. 

Propenyl groups have two carbons with a double bond. For example, propenyl acetate would have an ester group (OAc) attached to a propenyl chain. Similarly for butenyl, it's a four-carbon chain with a double bond.

Wait, wait. The options are propenyl and butenyl. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2OAc, but wait, no, wait. Wait, propenyl would be CH2CH2CH2... No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but the position of the double bond depends on whether it's 1-propenyl or 2-propenyl. Oh wait, in the case of propenyl acetate, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, wait, acetate ester is R-O-CO-O-R, no, wait, no. Acetate esters are like R-O-CO-O-R? Wait no, wait, the ester functional group is R-O-CO-R. So for propenyl acetate, it would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? Wait no, wait, no. Wait, acetate is OAc, which is O-CO-OCH3. So the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3. So in propenyl acetate, R is propenyl. So R is CH2=CHCH2- group. Hmm, wait, but where is the double bond?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like CH3COO-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The structure of propenyl acetate would be CH2CH2CH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Because acetate is OAc, so the ester would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2CH2CH2-O-CO-OCH3, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the NMR data. The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling constant, which suggests a trans coupling, perhaps between two protons on adjacent carbons in a double bond. Because in a trans configuration, the coupling is larger than in cis. Wait, but wait, in a double bond, adjacent protons (on either end) would have a coupling. So if it's a trans double bond, the coupling would be larger because the protons are on opposite sides, leading to a trans coupling. Alternatively, in a cis arrangement, the coupling might be smaller, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact values.

So the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, which integrates to one proton. That suggests that this proton is adjacent to another proton that's coupled to it, with J=16 Hz. So maybe this is a vinyl proton adjacent to another in a trans configuration.

The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets. Hmm, a doublet of quartets (dq). That could mean that the proton is coupled to two different sets of protons. The quartet part comes from coupling with a triplet or another quartet? Wait, maybe it's coupled to two different protons. Let me think about the splitting. A doublet of quartets would imply that each proton is split into two sets of couplings. For example, if the proton is adjacent to two different types of protons, each with different J values. Alternatively, perhaps it's a multiplet due to coupling with adjacent groups.

Wait, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets. Let me think about possible structures. Suppose we have a double bond. If the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2-OAc, then the protons on the double bond would be adjacent to each other. But wait, the doublet at 7 ppm has J=16 Hz, which is a large value, typical of trans coupling in double bonds. So perhaps the structure has a trans configuration across the double bond.

Wait, but then, the propenyl group would have a trans configuration. So for example, in trans-propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents on either side are on opposite sides.

Alternatively, wait, perhaps the 7.0 ppm signal is a vinylic proton. So, in a structure where there's a double bond, the adjacent protons would be split.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but that doesn't make sense because acetate would be OAc-O- attached to something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the acetate ester structure: R-O-CO-OCH3. So the R group is attached to the oxygen, and the ester is O-CO-OCH3. So R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (E)- or (Z)- propenyl acetate. So for propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3. Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2-O-CO-OCH3, but with a double bond.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the possible structures for each option:

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. Butenyl is four carbons, with a double bond. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-OCH3, but the substituents on the double bond would determine if it's cis or trans.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate. Propenyl is three carbons with a double bond. So structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3, with the substituents across the double bond in a trans arrangement.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. So the substituents on either side of the double bond are on the same side.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate. So four carbons, double bond, substituents on opposite sides.

Wait, but the NMR signals don't seem to have enough protons for a butenyl group. Let me think again about the number of protons. The signals are:

7.0: 1H, d, J=16 Hz.

5.5: 1H, dq.

2.1: 3H, s.

1.6: 3H, d.

So, the 2.1 and 1.6 are each 3H, which suggests two methyl groups. The 1.6 ppm is a doublet, so perhaps it's adjacent to a CH2 group. The 2.1 is a singlet, so it's attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, like an OAc group.

So the structure likely has an OAc group (from 2.1 ppm) and a propenyl or butenyl group attached to the oxygen.

In propenyl groups, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the protons on the double bond would be the vinylic protons. Let's think about their NMR signals.

In propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. The protons on the double bond are the two CH2 groups. Wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. So the protons on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH) would be vinylic.

Wait, maybe it's more precise to think that the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. So the vinylic protons would be on C1 and C2. Wait, but C1 is CH2, so each CH2 has two protons. Hmm, but in the NMR, we see only one proton as a doublet. That doesn't add up. Maybe I'm not considering the correct structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like CH3-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. No, wait, that's more about the ester group.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility of the structure being CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, that's a different ester. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about how the coupling would look in the NMR.

In a trans configuration across the double bond, the two vinylic protons would be trans, leading to a larger J value. For example, in trans configuration, the coupling between protons on each end of the double bond would be larger, around 16 Hz.

So the 7.0 ppm signal is a doublet with J=16, which suggests a trans coupling. That proton is coupled to another proton on the adjacent carbon, leading to a doublet. 

The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets. That's more complex. Maybe this proton is coupled to two different sets of protons. Perhaps it's a methylene group adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the number of signals. The propenyl group in the ester would have three carbons: the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C3 is a CH2 group attached to the ester oxygen.

Wait, for propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Then the vinylic protons would be on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH). Wait, but C1 is CH2, which would have two protons. But in the NMR, we have a single peak for 1H. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but that would be allyl acetate, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the coupling patterns. The 7.0 ppm is a doublet (d), which implies each proton is split by one neighboring proton. The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets (dq), which could mean that each proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, each with a different J value.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. In that case, the protons on the CH2 (C1) would be a triplet, perhaps, due to coupling with the adjacent CH group. But let me think about the splitting.

Wait, in CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the CH2 group (C3) attached to the ester oxygen would be next to the CH (C2) group. The CH2 (C3) would be a triplet, perhaps, but in the NMR, I'm seeing a singlet for 3H (2.1 ppm, the OAc group). So perhaps the C3 is a CH2 group adjacent to the C2, which is a CH group.

Wait, so the C3 is a CH2, so its protons would be split by the adjacent CH. So if the C2 has one proton, then the C3's CH2 would be a triplet (n+1, where n=2 from two adjacent H's). But in the data, I don't see a triplet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH=CH-OAc. Wait, but that might not be a standard structure. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is between C2 and C3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2-OAc with a double bond between C2 and C3, making it CH2CH=CH-OAc. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, with the ester group on C3. In that case, the vinylic protons would be on C2 and C3.

But wait, in that case, the C2 would have a CH2 group, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm complicating this.

Let me try to draw the possible structures for each option and see how their NMR would look.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

The double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents on both ends are in a cis configuration. So the CH2 group on C1 and the CH2 group on C3.

Wait, but in this structure, the C1 is CH2, so two protons. The C2 is CH. Hmm.

The vinylic protons would be on C1 and C2. But wait, the C1 is CH2, so two protons, and C2 is CH, one proton.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet (1H), which suggests a single proton. So perhaps that's the CH on C2. Then the CH2 on C1 would have two protons, perhaps as a triplet or a quartet.

But in the data, the 5.5 ppm is a 1H signal. So perhaps the 5.5 is another vinylic proton, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the double bond is between C2 and C3, making it CH2CH=CH-OAc. Then, the vinylic protons would be on C2 and C3. C2 would have two protons (CH2) and C3 would have one proton (CH).

Wait, but then the C3's CH would be split by the C2's CH2. So the C3 proton would be a triplet, perhaps, and the C2's protons would be split by the C1 (if any) and the C3.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try another approach.

Looking at the NMR signals:

- The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16. So this proton is coupled to one other proton with a large coupling. That suggests that it's a trans coupling across a double bond. So the two protons are on opposite sides of the double bond, so they're trans and have a large J.

- The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets. So this proton is coupled to two different sets of protons. Each coupling has a different J value, leading to a doublet of quartets.

So maybe the structure has two double bonds or a double bond with adjacent groups that have multiple protons.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, and the 7.0 ppm is the CH (C2) proton, which is coupled to the CH2 (C1) protons. But wait, the coupling between a CH and a CH2 would lead to a triplet for the CH2, not a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but that would have less carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere, but that's more about butenyl acetate.

Wait, but let's consider the butenyl options. Butenyl is four carbons, so the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (butenyl). The double bond would be between C1 and C2, or C2 and C3.

If the double bond is between C2 and C3, then the structure is CH2CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the vinylic protons would be on C2 and C3.

But in the NMR, the 7.0 and 5.5 ppm signals are for a single proton each. So perhaps for a butenyl group, the vinylic positions have one proton each.

Wait, that can't be. Because for a double bond between C2 and C3, each would have two protons, unless there's a substituent like a methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (Z)- or (E)-butenyl acetate, such as CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but again, the protons on the double bond would be two each.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to match the NMR signals with the structures.

Another approach: The presence of a singlet at 2.1 ppm (3H) is likely the OAc group. The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl group adjacent to a CH group. Because in a doublet, each proton is coupled with one neighbor. So the 1.6 ppm methyl is attached to a CH group, which is next to another group.

So the structure might have a methyl group attached to a CH, which is part of a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH3. No, that would be a branching, but perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-OAc, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl acetate). So the double bond is between C1 and C2, then C3 is CH2-OAc.

In that structure, the vinylic protons would be on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH). So the C2 has one proton, which would be the 7.0 ppm doublet (because it's coupled to the C1's two protons). But wait, C2 has one proton, and C1 has two. So the C2 proton would couple with the two protons on C1, leading to a triplet. But in the NMR, we have a doublet at 7.0 ppm. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CH2CH=CH-OAc. Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain, so butenyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc. So the ester group is on the third carbon, which is a CH2 group. The double bond is between C1 and C2.

In that case, the C1 is CH2, which has two protons. The C2 is CH, which has one proton.

The C2's proton (7.0 ppm) would be coupled to the two protons on C1. So it would be a triplet, but in the NMR, it's a doublet. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=C-OAc. No, that can't be because OAc is an ester group attached to an oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc. But then, the ester would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the double bond is between the ester oxygen and another carbon. No, that's not possible because ester groups are O-CO-O-R, so the double bond is in the R group.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but the configuration is cis or trans.

So, in the trans configuration, the double bond would have substituents on opposite sides. The two vinylic protons would be on C1 and C2. Thus, the C2's proton would be trans to the ester group.

In the NMR, the C2's proton would be a doublet because it's coupled to the C1's two protons, but that would be a triplet. Hmm, because each H on C1 would split the C2's signal into a triplet. But the data shows a doublet at 7.0.

So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure is not propenyl but butenyl, and the double bond is between C3 and C4.

So, structure is CH2CH2CH=CH-OAc. So the double bond is between C3 and C4.

Wait, that would make the vinylic protons on C3 and C4. So C3 would be CH2 and C4 would be CH.

So the C4's proton would be coupled to the C3's two protons, leading to a triplet. But the data shows a doublet at 7.0, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the coupling constants. The J=16 Hz is quite large, so it's more likely a trans coupling in a double bond.

So, the 7.0 ppm is a vinylic proton that's trans to another, leading to a doublet with J=16 Hz.

The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets, which could be due to coupling with two different groups, say, one from the adjacent CH2 and another from a methyl group.

Wait, considering the 1.6 ppm (3H, d), that's a methyl group attached to a CH group. So maybe the structure has a CH(CH2OAc)CH2CH3 group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (E)- or (Z)- propenyl acetate.

In (E)-propenyl acetate, the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite, so the configuration is trans. The structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc, with the ester group on C3.

Wait, perhaps the C2's proton is the one at 7.0 ppm, coupled with the C1's two protons. But as I thought earlier, that would produce a triplet, not a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ester is on C2. In that case, the C2 has a CH group attached to the ester.

But then, the vinylic protons would be on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH). The C2's proton would be coupled to the two protons on C1, leading again to a triplet, not a doublet.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the number of signals. The 7.0 and 5.5 are for 1H each, so perhaps the structure has two vinylic protons. But in propenyl, there are more protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something else. Let me think of the possible structures again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C2 has a CH2OAc group. But then, the C1's protons would be CH2, which would be two protons, and C2 would have one proton (CH). That might lead to a doublet for the C2's proton, as it's coupled to the C1's two protons, but that would be a triplet, not a doublet.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for key features.

The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets. That could mean that the proton is coupled to two different groups. For example, if it's a CH group that's adjacent to a CH2 and a CH3. So, perhaps the structure is something like CH2-CH(CH2OAc)-CH2-CH3, but that's just a guess.

Wait, the 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), which is a methyl group. So perhaps it's attached to a CH, which is next to a CH2. So the structure could be CH2-CH(CH2-OAc)-CH2-CH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but then the protons on the double bond would split differently.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, with the double bond in the middle. So, the C3 is attached to the OAc.

In this structure, the C2 has a CH group, and the C1 has a CH2.

So, the C2's proton (vinylic) would be split by the two protons on C1, leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a doublet. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, unless the C2's proton is also coupled to another group, like the OAc. But the OAc is on the ester oxygen, which is a few bonds away, so coupling to OAc's protons is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's butyl acetate, not propenyl or butenyl. So that's not matching.

Another thought: perhaps the structure is such that the double bond is between C2 and C3, making the vinylic protons on C2 and C3.

If the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc with a double bond between C2 and C3, then perhaps the C3's proton is the one at 7.0 ppm, coupled to the C2's protons. But the C2 would be CH2, so the C3's proton would be a triplet. But NMR shows a doublet, so that's not matching.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider the possibilities for each option.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, with the substituents on the same side.

In this structure, the vinylic protons are on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH). The C2's proton is adjacent to CH2, so the C2 proton would couple with the two protons on C1, leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a doublet, so perhaps this is not the case.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate. Same structure as option C, but trans configuration. So the substituents are opposite. The C2's proton would still be coupled to the two protons on C1, leading to a triplet, not a doublet.

So perhaps neither B nor C are correct.

Options A and D are butenyl acetates. So let's think about them.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. Structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, with substituents on the same side. The vinylic protons would be on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH). The C2's proton would be coupled to the two on C1, giving a triplet. But NMR shows a doublet. Hmm.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate. Structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, with substituents on opposite sides. Again, the C2's proton would be coupled to two on C1, leading to a triplet. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure of butenyl acetate is different. Let's think of butenyl as CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but the double bond could be between C1 and C2 or C2 and C3.

If the double bond is between C2 and C3, the structure would be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc. Then, the vinylic protons would be on C2 (CH) and C3 (CH). So the C3's proton would be coupled to the C2's CH and perhaps another group.

Wait, in that case, the C3's proton would be coupled to the C2's CH (one proton) and maybe the adjacent C4's CH2 group, leading to a split.

But in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, which suggests coupling to one proton. So perhaps the C3's proton is only coupled to the C2's proton.

So this would give a doublet at 7.0 ppm. That could fit.

Then, the 5.5 ppm would be the C2's proton, which is coupled to the C1's CH2 group and perhaps the C3's CH.

Wait, if C2 is CH, and C3 is CH, then the C2's proton would be coupled to C1's CH2 (two protons) and C3's CH (one proton), leading to a triplet of triplets or a more complex splitting pattern, but the NMR shows a doublet of quartets.

Hmm. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the 5.5 ppm proton is a CH group next to a CH2 and a CH3.

Wait, the 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), which is a CH3 group attached to a CH. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, C3 is CH with a CH2OAc group, and C4 is CH3.

In this case, the C3's CH would be adjacent to the CH2OAc group, and the CH3 is attached to C3.

So the C3's CH would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH2OAc's protons.

Wait, but I'm not sure how that would translate into the NMR signals.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for how the coupling would work.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet (1H), so J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, likely between two vinylic protons in a trans configuration.

The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets (1H), which suggests coupling to two different groups, each with their own J values.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), so a methyl group attached to a CH that is adjacent to another group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a double bond where one vinylic proton is coupled to another with J=16 Hz, and another proton that's coupled to two different groups.

Wait, another approach: the acetate group is OAc, so the structure is R-O-CO-OCH3. So R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

If R is propenyl, then R is CH2=CHCH2-.

In the structure CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the vinylic protons are on CH2 and CH.

If the configuration is trans (option B: Trans-propenyl acetate), then the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite.

The C2's CH would have a proton that's coupled to the two protons on C1 (CH2) and the C3's CH2 group.

Wait, but the C2's proton would be coupled to the two protons on C1, leading to a triplet. But in the NMR, the 7.0 is a doublet. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the C2's proton is only coupled to one other proton, leading to a doublet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C-OAc, but that doesn't seem right.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider the possibility that the 5.5 ppm is from a CH group adjacent to a methyl group and a double bond.

Wait, if the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3, then the CH group (C3) would have a proton that's coupled to the C2's CH and the C4's CH3. So the C3's proton would be a doublet of quartets, perhaps.

Wait, let's break it down:

The C3's proton is adjacent to C2 (CH) and C4 (CH3). So it would couple with the C2's CH (J1) and the C4's CH3 (J2).

Each coupling would split the signal. So if J1 and J2 are different, the splitting would result in a doublet of quartets. But wait, J2 for a methyl group is usually smaller and around 7 Hz or so, while J1 for the CH would be larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the C3's proton is coupled to both the C2's CH and the C4's CH3, leading to a doublet of quartets.

In that case, the 5.5 ppm would be the C3's proton.

The C2's proton (C2 is CH in CH2=CH-) would be coupled to the C1's CH2 (two protons) and the C3's CH (one proton). So it would have a triplet of triplets or a more complex splitting, but in the NMR, it's a doublet at 7.0, which suggests only one coupling. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the C3's proton is coupled only to the C4's CH3 and another group.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere quickly. Maybe I should try to count the number of signals.

The NMR has four signals: 7.0 (d), 5.5 (dq), 2.1 (s), 1.6 (d). So four signals, which implies that the molecule has four distinct proton environments.

The propenyl group would have more protons, so perhaps it's more likely a butenyl group, which would have more carbons and potentially fewer signals if some are equivalent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, and the molecule is in a trans configuration.

In that case, the C2's proton would be coupled to the two protons on C1, leading to a triplet. But the data shows a doublet, so that's not matching.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the integration. Each signal integrates to 1H, 1H, 3H, 3H. So the molecule has 8 protons in total (1+1+3+3=8). But the options are either propenyl (3 carbons) or butenyl (4 carbons).

So propenyl acetate would have 3 carbons in the ester group (excluding the OAc). Let's count the protons:

CH2=CHCH2-OAc:

- C1: CH2 (2H)
- C2: CH (1H)
- C3: CH2 (2H)
OAc: CH3 (3H)
Total: 2 +1 +2 +3 =8 H.

But in the NMR data, the signals are 1H, 1H, 3H, 3H. So the 2H from C1 and 2H from C3 would combine into other signals.

Wait, but in the NMR, the C3's CH2 (OAc attached) would be split by the adjacent C2's CH. So the C3's CH2 would be a triplet. But in the data, the singlet is 3H (OAc), so the C3's CH2 must be split into another signal.

But in the data, the only other 1H signals are 7.0 and 5.5, which are each 1H. So perhaps the structure is such that only two of the C1's protons are accounted for, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the C1's CH2 is split into a doublet or another pattern, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is trans-propenyl acetate. Let me imagine the structure:

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc, trans configuration. So the substituents on the double bond (CH2 and CH2-OAc) are on opposite sides.

The C2's proton would be coupled to the two protons on C1, leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a doublet, so that's conflicting.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the 1.6 ppm signal. It's a doublet of 3H, which is a methyl group attached to a CH that's adjacent to another group.

So, the structure could be something like CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3. So the C3 is a CH group attached to a CH2OAc and a CH3.

In this structure, the C3's CH would have two adjacent groups: a CH2OAc (which is a CH2 group) and a CH3.

So the C3's CH would have a proton that's coupled to the CH2OAc's two protons and the CH3's three protons. But that would lead to a more complex splitting, perhaps a triplet of triplets or a quintet, but the NMR shows a doublet of quartets, which is a dq.

Alternatively, perhaps the C3's CH is coupled to the CH2OAc's protons and the CH2 group adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3. Then, the C3's CH is adjacent to a CH2OAc and a CH3. So the C3's proton would be coupled to the two protons in CH2OAc (J1) and the three protons in CH3 (J2).

But that would lead to a more complex splitting, perhaps a triplet of triplets, but the data shows a doublet of quartets.

Alternatively, perhaps the C3's CH is coupled to two different groups, each with two protons, leading to a quartet for each coupling, hence a doublet of quartets.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, considering the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets (1H). So this proton is split by two different groups, each leading to a quartet and a doublet. Alternatively, perhaps it's coupled to two groups, each with two protons, leading to a quartet each, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the 5.5 ppm is a methylene group adjacent to a double bond and a methyl group. So, the proton would be split by both the double bond and the methyl.

But I'm not making progress quickly, so perhaps I should consider the options again.

Looking at the options:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

We need to choose between these four.

The key points are:

- The 7.0 ppm doublet with J=16 Hz suggests a trans coupling across a double bond.

- The 5.5 ppm doublet of quartets suggests coupling to two different groups.

- The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another group.

So, in the trans configuration (options B and D), the double bond substituents are opposite, leading to larger J values.

So, perhaps the correct structure is a butenyl group with a trans configuration, leading to a large J.

Wait, but butenyl would have more protons, so why are the NMR signals only 8 H in total? Let me recount.

If it's butenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc.

The protons would be:

- C1: CH2 (2H)
- C2: CH (1H)
- C3: CH2 (2H)
- C4: CH2 (2H) attached to OAc.

Wait, no, OAc is on the end. So C4 would be CH2-OAc.

Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc.

So the protons:

- C1: CH2 (2H)
- C2: CH (1H)
- C3: CH2 (2H)
- C4: CH2 (2H) attached to OAc.

Wait, that would be 2+1+2+2=7 H, but the OAc's CH3 is 3H, making 10 H in total. But the NMR data only accounts for 8 H. So perhaps butenyl isn't the right path.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let's recount.

The structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc.

Protons:

- C1: CH2 (2H)
- C2: CH (1H)
- C3: CH2 (2H)
- C4: CH2OAc (2H)
But wait, OAc is an ester group, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-OCH3.

So, the CH2CH2-O-CO-OCH3 would have the CH2 groups on C3 and C4. So, C3: CH2 (2H), C4: CH2 (2H) attached to O-CO-OCH3.

So, the protons are:

C1: 2H
C2: 1H
C3: 2H
C4: 2H
OAc: 3H (CH3)

Total: 2+1+2+2+3=10 H.

But the NMR shows only 8 H. So perhaps butenyl isn't correct.

So, perhaps it's a propenyl group.

But earlier, the propenyl structure didn't seem to fit the NMR data.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH3.

So the structure would be:

CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH3

In this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C2 has a CH2OAc group and a CH3 group.

The vinylic protons would be on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH).

But wait, C2 has a CH group attached to two substituents: CH2OAc and CH3.

So the C1's CH2 protons would be split by the C2's CH proton, leading to a triplet.

The C2's CH proton would be split by the C1's CH2 and perhaps the adjacent CH3.

Wait, but C2's CH is attached to C1's CH2 and C3's CH3. So the C2's proton would be coupled to the C1's two protons and the C3's three protons, leading to a complex splitting pattern.

But in the NMR, we have a 1H doublet at 7.0 ppm and a 1H doublet of quartets at 5.5 ppm.

So, perhaps the C2's proton is the 5.5 ppm signal, coupled to the CH2 and CH3 groups, leading to a doublet of quartets.

The C1's CH2 protons would be split into a triplet by the C2's CH, but in the NMR, we don't see a triplet, so that's conflicting.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc.

But then, the structure would be CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3. That's not correct because the ester should be R-O-CO-O-R. So if R is CH2=CH-, then the structure is CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3.

In this case, the vinylic protons would be on CH2 and CH.

The CH's proton would be coupled to the CH2's two protons, leading to a triplet, but the NMR shows a doublet at 7.0 ppm.

Hmm.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to make a decision based on the available data.

The key points:

- The 7.0 ppm doublet with J=16 Hz suggests a trans coupling in a double bond.

- The 5.5 ppm doublet of quartets suggests coupling to two different groups.

- The 1.6 ppm doublet implies a methyl attached to a CH group adjacent to another group.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate. Structure would be (E)-butenyl acetate: CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc.

In this case, the C2's proton is coupled to the C1's CH2 (two protons) and perhaps the C3's CH2.

But the C2's proton would be a triplet, not a doublet, which doesn't match.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate: CH2=CHCH2-OAc, trans configuration.

In this case, the C2's proton is coupled to the C1's CH2 (two protons), leading to a triplet, but the NMR shows a doublet. So this doesn't fit.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Same structure as B but cis. Again, the C2's proton would be a triplet, not a doublet.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. Structure would be (Z)-butenyl acetate.

Again, the C2's proton would be coupled to C1's CH2, leading to a triplet, which doesn't match.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps the structure isn't propenyl or butenyl but has a different arrangement. Or perhaps the vinylic protons are not on the same carbon as I thought.

Another thought: perhaps the structure has a conjugated diene, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl group (1.6 ppm) is attached to the oxygen, but that would be an ethyl group, not a methyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, making the ester group OAc attached directly to the CH2.

But then, the vinylic protons would be on CH2 and CH, leading to the same issues as before.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about which option best fits the NMR data.

The 7.0 ppm doublet suggests a trans coupling of 16 Hz, so the correct structure must have a trans double bond.

Looking at the options, options B (trans-propenyl) and D (trans-butenyl) have trans configurations.

Now, considering the 5.5 ppm doublet of quartets. Perhaps this comes from a CH group adjacent to a CH2 and a methyl group.

In the case of propenyl, the CH group (C2) would be adjacent to CH2 (C1) and the OAc group (C3). But the OAc is a CH3, so perhaps the C2's CH is coupled to the C1's CH2 and the OAc's CH3.

Wait, but the OAc's CH3 is a singlet, so the C2's CH would couple to the OAc's CH3, leading to a quartet. But the C2's CH is also coupled to the C1's CH2, leading to another split.

So, the C2's CH would be a doublet of quartets, which matches the 5.5 ppm signal.

But earlier, I thought that C2's CH would be coupled to C1's CH2, leading to a triplet, but if it's also coupled to the OAc's CH3, that would add another split.

Wait, but the OAc's CH3 is attached to oxygen, so it's a singlet. So the C2's CH wouldn't couple to the OAc's CH3 because they're not adjacent. Only adjacent protons couple.

Ah! That's a key point. Protons couple with adjacent (vicinal) protons, not across the molecule.

So, the C2's CH is adjacent to C1's CH2 and C3's CH2 (in propenyl acetate). So the C2's CH is coupled to the two protons on C1's CH2, leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a doublet, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the C2's CH is only coupled to one proton, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the C2's CH is only coupled to the C3's CH2, but that's possible only if the C1's CH2 is equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the C3's CH2 is split into a singlet, but that's not the case.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck, but given the options, the one that has a trans double bond and fits the coupling would be either B or D.

But the singlet at 2.1 ppm is from OAc, so the R group is attached to oxygen.

Since the 1.6 ppm is a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps the structure is such that the R group is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

But earlier, that didn't fit because of the triplet issue. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is from the CH2 group, but that doesn't make sense because CH2 would have two protons and a singlet or a quartet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the C2's CH is coupled to the C3's CH2, leading to a triplet, but that's not matching the NMR.

I think I'll have to make an educated guess here. The key is the 7.0 ppm doublet with J=16 Hz, which is a trans coupling. So the correct structure must have a trans double bond.

Among the options, the trans options are B and D.

Now, considering the 1.6 ppm signal. It's a doublet, so a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another group.

In propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. The CH2-OAc would be adjacent to the CH group. So the CH2's protons would be split by the CH group.

But the 1.6 ppm is a methyl group. Wait, the CH2-OAc group is CH2, so perhaps the 1.6 ppm is from a methyl group elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the structure isn't propenyl or butenyl but something else entirely. But the options are limited.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another approach: the number of signals. The NMR has four signals, which suggests four distinct proton environments.

If the structure is cis-propenyl acetate (option C), the protons would be:

- C1's CH2 (2H, split into a triplet)
- C2's CH (1H, split into a doublet)
- C3's CH2 (2H, split into a triplet)
- OAc's CH3 (3H, singlet)

But that would lead to more signals than we have. Hmm. Unless some are overlapping or equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the C1's CH2 and C3's CH2 are equivalent, leading to a singlet for one of them. But that's unlikely.

I'm really stuck. I think the best approach is to conclude that the correct answer is option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's option D: Trans-butenyl acetate.

Wait, but the 1.6 ppm is a methyl group, which would be present in butenyl acetate. Hmm.

Another thought: the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets. Quartets suggest coupling with three protons, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the 5.5 ppm is a CH group adjacent to a CH2 and a CH3. So the CH would be coupled to the CH2 (two protons, J1) and the CH3 (three protons, J2). Each coupling would split the signal, leading to a (n+1)(m+1) pattern, which would be (2+1)*(3+1)= 3*4=12 lines, but that's not possible. Instead, it would be a doublet of quartets, which matches the data.

So, the CH group would be adjacent to a CH2 and a CH3.

Which structure fits this? Perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3.

In this case, the CH group (C3) is adjacent to a CH2 (C2) and a CH3 (C4).

So, the C3's proton would be coupled to the C2's CH2 (two protons, J=?) and the C4's CH3 (three protons, J=??), leading to a doublet of quartets.

The C2's CH2 would be coupled to the C1's CH2 and the C3's CH, leading to a triplet.

The C4's CH3 would be a doublet because it's attached to the C3's CH.

So, the NMR signals would be:

- C1's CH2: triplet, integrating to 2H.
- C2's CH: doublet of quartets, integrating to 1H.
- C3's CH: doublet of quartets, integrating to 1H.
- C4's CH3: doublet, integrating to 3H.
- OAc's CH3: singlet, integrating to 3H.

But this doesn't match the given data, which has 7.0 ppm (1H, d), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d).

So, maybe in this structure, the C1's CH2 is the 7.0 ppm doublet. But why would it be a doublet? Because it's coupled to only one proton.

Wait, perhaps the C1's CH2 is only coupled to the C2's CH, leading to a triplet. But the data shows a doublet at 7.0 ppm.

I'm getting too tangled up here. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess that the correct answer is option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are Cis-butenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-propenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. The provided NMR data is:

- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**  
- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**  
- **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**  
- **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**  

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **The 2.1 ppm singlet (3H)** corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate (OAc) ester, confirming the compound is an acetate ester.

2. **The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H)** indicates a methyl group attached to a CH group, which is adjacent to another group.

3. **The 7.0 ppm doublet (1H, J = 16.0 Hz)** suggests a vinylic proton coupled to another proton with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), typical of a trans configuration across a double bond.

4. **The 5.5 ppm doublet of quartets (1H)** indicates a proton coupled to two different sets of protons, likely from adjacent groups.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate**  
  This structure has a double bond between C2 and C3, with substituents on the same side. The vinylic protons would be on C2 and C3. However, the coupling patterns and splitting do not align with the NMR data, as the 7.0 ppm signal would likely be a triplet due to coupling with the CH2 group on C1.

- **Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate**  
  This structure has a double bond between C1 and C2, with substituents on opposite sides. The vinylic protons would be on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH). The C2 proton would be coupled to the two protons on C1, leading to a triplet, which does not match the observed doublet at 7.0 ppm.

- **Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate**  
  This structure has a double bond between C1 and C2, with substituents on the same side. The vinylic protons would be on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH). The C2 proton would be coupled to the two protons on C1, leading to a triplet. However, this does not match the observed doublet at 7.0 ppm, suggesting this option is less likely.

- **Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate**  
  This structure has a double bond between C1 and C2, with substituents on opposite sides. The vinylic protons would be on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH). The C2 proton would be coupled to the two protons on C1, leading to a triplet, which again does not match the observed doublet at 7.0 ppm.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data suggests a trans configuration across the double bond (due to the large J = 16 Hz coupling), but none of the options perfectly match the observed splitting patterns. Based on the reasoning provided, **Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate** is selected as the most plausible answer, despite some inconsistencies in the coupling patterns.

Answer: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this NMR problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The compound is an organic one, and I have to choose between four options: Cis-propenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-butenyl acetate, or Trans-butenyl acetate. 

First, I remember that NMR spectroscopy gives information about the structure based on the environment of the protons. The 1H NMR data provided is: 
- 7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)
- 5.5 ppm (1H, dq)
- 2.1 ppm (3H, s)
- 1.6 ppm (3H, d)

Let me break this down.

The 2.1 ppm singlet (3H) is probably an acetyl group (OAc), since acetates typically have a singlet around 2 ppm for the methyl group attached to the oxygen. So the compound is an acetate ester.

Next, the two other signals: the doublet at 7.0 and the doublet of quartets at 5.5. I'm thinking these are from the propenyl or butenyl group. 

Let me consider the structures. 

Propenyl groups have two carbons with a double bond. For example, propenyl acetate would have an ester group (OAc) attached to a propenyl chain. Similarly for butenyl, it's a four-carbon chain with a double bond.

Wait, wait. The options are propenyl and butenyl. Propenyl is CH2=CHCH2OAc, but wait, no, wait. Wait, propenyl would be CH2CH2CH2... No, wait, propenyl is CH2=CHCH2-, but the position of the double bond depends on whether it's 1-propenyl or 2-propenyl. Oh wait, in the case of propenyl acetate, the double bond is between carbons 1 and 2. So the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc. But wait, wait, acetate ester is R-O-CO-O-R, no, wait, no. Acetate esters are like R-O-CO-O-R? Wait no, wait, the ester functional group is R-O-CO-R. So for propenyl acetate, it would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3? Wait no, wait, no. Wait, acetate is OAc, which is O-CO-OCH3. So the ester would be R-O-CO-OCH3. So in propenyl acetate, R is propenyl. So R is CH2=CHCH2- group. Hmm, wait, but where is the double bond?

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like CH3COO-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The structure of propenyl acetate would be CH2CH2CH2-O-CO-OCH3? No, that doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Because acetate is OAc, so the ester would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2CH2CH2-O-CO-OCH3, but I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the NMR data. The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling constant, which suggests a trans coupling, perhaps between two protons on adjacent carbons in a double bond. Because in a trans configuration, the coupling is larger than in cis. Wait, but wait, in a double bond, adjacent protons (on either end) would have a coupling. So if it's a trans double bond, the coupling would be larger because the protons are on opposite sides, leading to a trans coupling. Alternatively, in a cis arrangement, the coupling might be smaller, but I'm not entirely sure about the exact values.

So the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, which integrates to one proton. That suggests that this proton is adjacent to another proton that's coupled to it, with J=16 Hz. So maybe this is a vinyl proton adjacent to another in a trans configuration.

The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets. Hmm, a doublet of quartets (dq). That could mean that the proton is coupled to two different sets of protons. The quartet part comes from coupling with a triplet or another quartet? Wait, maybe it's coupled to two different protons. Let me think about the splitting. A doublet of quartets would imply that each proton is split into two sets of couplings. For example, if the proton is adjacent to two different types of protons, each with different J values. Alternatively, perhaps it's a multiplet due to coupling with adjacent groups.

Wait, the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets. Let me think about possible structures. Suppose we have a double bond. If the structure is something like CH2=CHCH2-OAc, then the protons on the double bond would be adjacent to each other. But wait, the doublet at 7 ppm has J=16 Hz, which is a large value, typical of trans coupling in double bonds. So perhaps the structure has a trans configuration across the double bond.

Wait, but then, the propenyl group would have a trans configuration. So for example, in trans-propenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents on either side are on opposite sides.

Alternatively, wait, perhaps the 7.0 ppm signal is a vinylic proton. So, in a structure where there's a double bond, the adjacent protons would be split.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but that doesn't make sense because acetate would be OAc-O- attached to something else. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the acetate ester structure: R-O-CO-OCH3. So the R group is attached to the oxygen, and the ester is O-CO-OCH3. So R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (E)- or (Z)- propenyl acetate. So for propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3. Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2-O-CO-OCH3, but with a double bond.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the possible structures for each option:

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. Butenyl is four carbons, with a double bond. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-OCH3, but the substituents on the double bond would determine if it's cis or trans.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate. Propenyl is three carbons with a double bond. So structure would be CH2=CHCH2-O-CO-OCH3, with the substituents across the double bond in a trans arrangement.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. So the substituents on either side of the double bond are on the same side.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate. So four carbons, double bond, substituents on opposite sides.

Wait, but the NMR signals don't seem to have enough protons for a butenyl group. Let me think again about the number of protons. The signals are:

7.0: 1H, d, J=16 Hz.

5.5: 1H, dq.

2.1: 3H, s.

1.6: 3H, d.

So, the 2.1 and 1.6 are each 3H, which suggests two methyl groups. The 1.6 ppm is a doublet, so perhaps it's adjacent to a CH2 group. The 2.1 is a singlet, so it's attached to something that doesn't cause splitting, like an OAc group.

So the structure likely has an OAc group (from 2.1 ppm) and a propenyl or butenyl group attached to the oxygen.

In propenyl groups, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the protons on the double bond would be the vinylic protons. Let's think about their NMR signals.

In propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. The protons on the double bond are the two CH2 groups. Wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. So the protons on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH) would be vinylic.

Wait, maybe it's more precise to think that the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-OAc. So the vinylic protons would be on C1 and C2. Wait, but C1 is CH2, so each CH2 has two protons. Hmm, but in the NMR, we see only one proton as a doublet. That doesn't add up. Maybe I'm not considering the correct structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is more like CH3-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2, but with a double bond. No, wait, that's more about the ester group.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the possibility of the structure being CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH2CH2CH3? No, that's a different ester. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think about how the coupling would look in the NMR.

In a trans configuration across the double bond, the two vinylic protons would be trans, leading to a larger J value. For example, in trans configuration, the coupling between protons on each end of the double bond would be larger, around 16 Hz.

So the 7.0 ppm signal is a doublet with J=16, which suggests a trans coupling. That proton is coupled to another proton on the adjacent carbon, leading to a doublet. 

The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets. That's more complex. Maybe this proton is coupled to two different sets of protons. Perhaps it's a methylene group adjacent to a double bond.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the number of signals. The propenyl group in the ester would have three carbons: the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C3 is a CH2 group attached to the ester oxygen.

Wait, for propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. Then the vinylic protons would be on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH). Wait, but C1 is CH2, which would have two protons. But in the NMR, we have a single peak for 1H. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but that would be allyl acetate, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the coupling patterns. The 7.0 ppm is a doublet (d), which implies each proton is split by one neighboring proton. The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets (dq), which could mean that each proton is coupled to two different sets of protons, each with a different J value.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. In that case, the protons on the CH2 (C1) would be a triplet, perhaps, due to coupling with the adjacent CH group. But let me think about the splitting.

Wait, in CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the CH2 group (C3) attached to the ester oxygen would be next to the CH (C2) group. The CH2 (C3) would be a triplet, perhaps, but in the NMR, I'm seeing a singlet for 3H (2.1 ppm, the OAc group). So perhaps the C3 is a CH2 group adjacent to the C2, which is a CH group.

Wait, so the C3 is a CH2, so its protons would be split by the adjacent CH. So if the C2 has one proton, then the C3's CH2 would be a triplet (n+1, where n=2 from two adjacent H's). But in the data, I don't see a triplet. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH=CH-OAc. Wait, but that might not be a standard structure. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is between C2 and C3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2CH2-OAc with a double bond between C2 and C3, making it CH2CH=CH-OAc. So the double bond is between C2 and C3, with the ester group on C3. In that case, the vinylic protons would be on C2 and C3.

But wait, in that case, the C2 would have a CH2 group, but I'm not sure. Maybe I'm complicating this.

Let me try to draw the possible structures for each option and see how their NMR would look.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc.

The double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents on both ends are in a cis configuration. So the CH2 group on C1 and the CH2 group on C3.

Wait, but in this structure, the C1 is CH2, so two protons. The C2 is CH. Hmm.

The vinylic protons would be on C1 and C2. But wait, the C1 is CH2, so two protons, and C2 is CH, one proton.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet (1H), which suggests a single proton. So perhaps that's the CH on C2. Then the CH2 on C1 would have two protons, perhaps as a triplet or a quartet.

But in the data, the 5.5 ppm is a 1H signal. So perhaps the 5.5 is another vinylic proton, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the double bond is between C2 and C3, making it CH2CH=CH-OAc. Then, the vinylic protons would be on C2 and C3. C2 would have two protons (CH2) and C3 would have one proton (CH).

Wait, but then the C3's CH would be split by the C2's CH2. So the C3 proton would be a triplet, perhaps, and the C2's protons would be split by the C1 (if any) and the C3.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try another approach.

Looking at the NMR signals:

- The 7.0 ppm is a doublet with J=16. So this proton is coupled to one other proton with a large coupling. That suggests that it's a trans coupling across a double bond. So the two protons are on opposite sides of the double bond, so they're trans and have a large J.

- The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets. So this proton is coupled to two different sets of protons. Each coupling has a different J value, leading to a doublet of quartets.

So maybe the structure has two double bonds or a double bond with adjacent groups that have multiple protons.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, and the 7.0 ppm is the CH (C2) proton, which is coupled to the CH2 (C1) protons. But wait, the coupling between a CH and a CH2 would lead to a triplet for the CH2, not a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but that would have less carbons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH3-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2 with a double bond somewhere, but that's more about butenyl acetate.

Wait, but let's consider the butenyl options. Butenyl is four carbons, so the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc (butenyl). The double bond would be between C1 and C2, or C2 and C3.

If the double bond is between C2 and C3, then the structure is CH2CH2=CHCH2-OAc. So the vinylic protons would be on C2 and C3.

But in the NMR, the 7.0 and 5.5 ppm signals are for a single proton each. So perhaps for a butenyl group, the vinylic positions have one proton each.

Wait, that can't be. Because for a double bond between C2 and C3, each would have two protons, unless there's a substituent like a methyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is (Z)- or (E)-butenyl acetate, such as CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but again, the protons on the double bond would be two each.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to match the NMR signals with the structures.

Another approach: The presence of a singlet at 2.1 ppm (3H) is likely the OAc group. The 1.6 ppm (3H, d) is a methyl group adjacent to a CH group. Because in a doublet, each proton is coupled with one neighbor. So the 1.6 ppm methyl is attached to a CH group, which is next to another group.

So the structure might have a methyl group attached to a CH, which is part of a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH3. No, that would be a branching, but perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2CH2-OAc, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc (propenyl acetate). So the double bond is between C1 and C2, then C3 is CH2-OAc.

In that structure, the vinylic protons would be on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH). So the C2 has one proton, which would be the 7.0 ppm doublet (because it's coupled to the C1's two protons). But wait, C2 has one proton, and C1 has two. So the C2 proton would couple with the two protons on C1, leading to a triplet. But in the NMR, we have a doublet at 7.0 ppm. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3CH2CH=CH-OAc. Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain, so butenyl. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2OAc. So the ester group is on the third carbon, which is a CH2 group. The double bond is between C1 and C2.

In that case, the C1 is CH2, which has two protons. The C2 is CH, which has one proton.

The C2's proton (7.0 ppm) would be coupled to the two protons on C1. So it would be a triplet, but in the NMR, it's a doublet. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the structure is CH2=C-OAc. No, that can't be because OAc is an ester group attached to an oxygen.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc. But then, the ester would be OAc-O-CH2-CH2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the double bond is between the ester oxygen and another carbon. No, that's not possible because ester groups are O-CO-O-R, so the double bond is in the R group.

Wait, maybe the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, but the configuration is cis or trans.

So, in the trans configuration, the double bond would have substituents on opposite sides. The two vinylic protons would be on C1 and C2. Thus, the C2's proton would be trans to the ester group.

In the NMR, the C2's proton would be a doublet because it's coupled to the C1's two protons, but that would be a triplet. Hmm, because each H on C1 would split the C2's signal into a triplet. But the data shows a doublet at 7.0.

So that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure is not propenyl but butenyl, and the double bond is between C3 and C4.

So, structure is CH2CH2CH=CH-OAc. So the double bond is between C3 and C4.

Wait, that would make the vinylic protons on C3 and C4. So C3 would be CH2 and C4 would be CH.

So the C4's proton would be coupled to the C3's two protons, leading to a triplet. But the data shows a doublet at 7.0, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the coupling constants. The J=16 Hz is quite large, so it's more likely a trans coupling in a double bond.

So, the 7.0 ppm is a vinylic proton that's trans to another, leading to a doublet with J=16 Hz.

The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets, which could be due to coupling with two different groups, say, one from the adjacent CH2 and another from a methyl group.

Wait, considering the 1.6 ppm (3H, d), that's a methyl group attached to a CH group. So maybe the structure has a CH(CH2OAc)CH2CH3 group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the structure is (E)- or (Z)- propenyl acetate.

In (E)-propenyl acetate, the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite, so the configuration is trans. The structure would be CH2=CHCH2-OAc, with the ester group on C3.

Wait, perhaps the C2's proton is the one at 7.0 ppm, coupled with the C1's two protons. But as I thought earlier, that would produce a triplet, not a doublet.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and the ester is on C2. In that case, the C2 has a CH group attached to the ester.

But then, the vinylic protons would be on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH). The C2's proton would be coupled to the two protons on C1, leading again to a triplet, not a doublet.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's think about the number of signals. The 7.0 and 5.5 are for 1H each, so perhaps the structure has two vinylic protons. But in propenyl, there are more protons.

Wait, perhaps the structure is something else. Let me think of the possible structures again.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C2 has a CH2OAc group. But then, the C1's protons would be CH2, which would be two protons, and C2 would have one proton (CH). That might lead to a doublet for the C2's proton, as it's coupled to the C1's two protons, but that would be a triplet, not a doublet.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for key features.

The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets. That could mean that the proton is coupled to two different groups. For example, if it's a CH group that's adjacent to a CH2 and a CH3. So, perhaps the structure is something like CH2-CH(CH2OAc)-CH2-CH3, but that's just a guess.

Wait, the 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), which is a methyl group. So perhaps it's attached to a CH, which is next to a CH2. So the structure could be CH2-CH(CH2-OAc)-CH2-CH3, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, but then the protons on the double bond would split differently.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, with the double bond in the middle. So, the C3 is attached to the OAc.

In this structure, the C2 has a CH group, and the C1 has a CH2.

So, the C2's proton (vinylic) would be split by the two protons on C1, leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a doublet. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, unless the C2's proton is also coupled to another group, like the OAc. But the OAc is on the ester oxygen, which is a few bonds away, so coupling to OAc's protons is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH3-O-CO-O-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's butyl acetate, not propenyl or butenyl. So that's not matching.

Another thought: perhaps the structure is such that the double bond is between C2 and C3, making the vinylic protons on C2 and C3.

If the structure is CH2-CH2-CH2-OAc with a double bond between C2 and C3, then perhaps the C3's proton is the one at 7.0 ppm, coupled to the C2's protons. But the C2 would be CH2, so the C3's proton would be a triplet. But NMR shows a doublet, so that's not matching.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider the possibilities for each option.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, with the substituents on the same side.

In this structure, the vinylic protons are on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH). The C2's proton is adjacent to CH2, so the C2 proton would couple with the two protons on C1, leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a doublet, so perhaps this is not the case.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate. Same structure as option C, but trans configuration. So the substituents are opposite. The C2's proton would still be coupled to the two protons on C1, leading to a triplet, not a doublet.

So perhaps neither B nor C are correct.

Options A and D are butenyl acetates. So let's think about them.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. Structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, with substituents on the same side. The vinylic protons would be on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH). The C2's proton would be coupled to the two on C1, giving a triplet. But NMR shows a doublet. Hmm.

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate. Structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, with substituents on opposite sides. Again, the C2's proton would be coupled to two on C1, leading to a triplet. Not matching.

Wait, perhaps the structure of butenyl acetate is different. Let's think of butenyl as CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc, but the double bond could be between C1 and C2 or C2 and C3.

If the double bond is between C2 and C3, the structure would be CH2CH=CHCH2-OAc. Then, the vinylic protons would be on C2 (CH) and C3 (CH). So the C3's proton would be coupled to the C2's CH and perhaps another group.

Wait, in that case, the C3's proton would be coupled to the C2's CH (one proton) and maybe the adjacent C4's CH2 group, leading to a split.

But in the NMR, the 7.0 ppm is a doublet, which suggests coupling to one proton. So perhaps the C3's proton is only coupled to the C2's proton.

So this would give a doublet at 7.0 ppm. That could fit.

Then, the 5.5 ppm would be the C2's proton, which is coupled to the C1's CH2 group and perhaps the C3's CH.

Wait, if C2 is CH, and C3 is CH, then the C2's proton would be coupled to C1's CH2 (two protons) and C3's CH (one proton), leading to a triplet of triplets or a more complex splitting pattern, but the NMR shows a doublet of quartets.

Hmm. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the 5.5 ppm proton is a CH group next to a CH2 and a CH3.

Wait, the 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), which is a CH3 group attached to a CH. So perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3. So the double bond is between C1 and C2, C3 is CH with a CH2OAc group, and C4 is CH3.

In this case, the C3's CH would be adjacent to the CH2OAc group, and the CH3 is attached to C3.

So the C3's CH would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH2OAc's protons.

Wait, but I'm not sure how that would translate into the NMR signals.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to look for how the coupling would work.

The 7.0 ppm is a doublet (1H), so J=16 Hz. That's a large coupling, likely between two vinylic protons in a trans configuration.

The 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets (1H), which suggests coupling to two different groups, each with their own J values.

The 1.6 ppm is a doublet (3H), so a methyl group attached to a CH that is adjacent to another group.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure has a double bond where one vinylic proton is coupled to another with J=16 Hz, and another proton that's coupled to two different groups.

Wait, another approach: the acetate group is OAc, so the structure is R-O-CO-OCH3. So R is the propenyl or butenyl group.

If R is propenyl, then R is CH2=CHCH2-.

In the structure CH2=CHCH2-OAc, the vinylic protons are on CH2 and CH.

If the configuration is trans (option B: Trans-propenyl acetate), then the substituents on either side of the double bond are opposite.

The C2's CH would have a proton that's coupled to the two protons on C1 (CH2) and the C3's CH2 group.

Wait, but the C2's proton would be coupled to the two protons on C1, leading to a triplet. But in the NMR, the 7.0 is a doublet. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the C2's proton is only coupled to one other proton, leading to a doublet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=C-OAc, but that doesn't seem right.

Hmm. Maybe I should consider the possibility that the 5.5 ppm is from a CH group adjacent to a methyl group and a double bond.

Wait, if the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3, then the CH group (C3) would have a proton that's coupled to the C2's CH and the C4's CH3. So the C3's proton would be a doublet of quartets, perhaps.

Wait, let's break it down:

The C3's proton is adjacent to C2 (CH) and C4 (CH3). So it would couple with the C2's CH (J1) and the C4's CH3 (J2).

Each coupling would split the signal. So if J1 and J2 are different, the splitting would result in a doublet of quartets. But wait, J2 for a methyl group is usually smaller and around 7 Hz or so, while J1 for the CH would be larger.

Alternatively, perhaps the C3's proton is coupled to both the C2's CH and the C4's CH3, leading to a doublet of quartets.

In that case, the 5.5 ppm would be the C3's proton.

The C2's proton (C2 is CH in CH2=CH-) would be coupled to the C1's CH2 (two protons) and the C3's CH (one proton). So it would have a triplet of triplets or a more complex splitting, but in the NMR, it's a doublet at 7.0, which suggests only one coupling. So that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the C3's proton is coupled only to the C4's CH3 and another group.

Wait, but I'm not getting anywhere quickly. Maybe I should try to count the number of signals.

The NMR has four signals: 7.0 (d), 5.5 (dq), 2.1 (s), 1.6 (d). So four signals, which implies that the molecule has four distinct proton environments.

The propenyl group would have more protons, so perhaps it's more likely a butenyl group, which would have more carbons and potentially fewer signals if some are equivalent.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc, and the molecule is in a trans configuration.

In that case, the C2's proton would be coupled to the two protons on C1, leading to a triplet. But the data shows a doublet, so that's not matching.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the integration. Each signal integrates to 1H, 1H, 3H, 3H. So the molecule has 8 protons in total (1+1+3+3=8). But the options are either propenyl (3 carbons) or butenyl (4 carbons).

So propenyl acetate would have 3 carbons in the ester group (excluding the OAc). Let's count the protons:

CH2=CHCH2-OAc:

- C1: CH2 (2H)
- C2: CH (1H)
- C3: CH2 (2H)
OAc: CH3 (3H)
Total: 2 +1 +2 +3 =8 H.

But in the NMR data, the signals are 1H, 1H, 3H, 3H. So the 2H from C1 and 2H from C3 would combine into other signals.

Wait, but in the NMR, the C3's CH2 (OAc attached) would be split by the adjacent C2's CH. So the C3's CH2 would be a triplet. But in the data, the singlet is 3H (OAc), so the C3's CH2 must be split into another signal.

But in the data, the only other 1H signals are 7.0 and 5.5, which are each 1H. So perhaps the structure is such that only two of the C1's protons are accounted for, but I'm not seeing it.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the C1's CH2 is split into a doublet or another pattern, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is trans-propenyl acetate. Let me imagine the structure:

Structure: CH2=CHCH2-OAc, trans configuration. So the substituents on the double bond (CH2 and CH2-OAc) are on opposite sides.

The C2's proton would be coupled to the two protons on C1, leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a doublet, so that's conflicting.

Hmm. Maybe I should think about the 1.6 ppm signal. It's a doublet of 3H, which is a methyl group attached to a CH that's adjacent to another group.

So, the structure could be something like CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3. So the C3 is a CH group attached to a CH2OAc and a CH3.

In this structure, the C3's CH would have two adjacent groups: a CH2OAc (which is a CH2 group) and a CH3.

So the C3's CH would have a proton that's coupled to the CH2OAc's two protons and the CH3's three protons. But that would lead to a more complex splitting, perhaps a triplet of triplets or a quintet, but the NMR shows a doublet of quartets, which is a dq.

Alternatively, perhaps the C3's CH is coupled to the CH2OAc's protons and the CH2 group adjacent to the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3. Then, the C3's CH is adjacent to a CH2OAc and a CH3. So the C3's proton would be coupled to the two protons in CH2OAc (J1) and the three protons in CH3 (J2).

But that would lead to a more complex splitting, perhaps a triplet of triplets, but the data shows a doublet of quartets.

Alternatively, perhaps the C3's CH is coupled to two different groups, each with two protons, leading to a quartet for each coupling, hence a doublet of quartets.

Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, considering the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets (1H). So this proton is split by two different groups, each leading to a quartet and a doublet. Alternatively, perhaps it's coupled to two groups, each with two protons, leading to a quartet each, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the 5.5 ppm is a methylene group adjacent to a double bond and a methyl group. So, the proton would be split by both the double bond and the methyl.

But I'm not making progress quickly, so perhaps I should consider the options again.

Looking at the options:

A) Cis-butenyl acetate

B) Trans-propenyl acetate

C) Cis-propenyl acetate

D) Trans-butenyl acetate

We need to choose between these four.

The key points are:

- The 7.0 ppm doublet with J=16 Hz suggests a trans coupling across a double bond.

- The 5.5 ppm doublet of quartets suggests coupling to two different groups.

- The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another group.

So, in the trans configuration (options B and D), the double bond substituents are opposite, leading to larger J values.

So, perhaps the correct structure is a butenyl group with a trans configuration, leading to a large J.

Wait, but butenyl would have more protons, so why are the NMR signals only 8 H in total? Let me recount.

If it's butenyl acetate, the structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc.

The protons would be:

- C1: CH2 (2H)
- C2: CH (1H)
- C3: CH2 (2H)
- C4: CH2 (2H) attached to OAc.

Wait, no, OAc is on the end. So C4 would be CH2-OAc.

Wait, no, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc.

So the protons:

- C1: CH2 (2H)
- C2: CH (1H)
- C3: CH2 (2H)
- C4: CH2 (2H) attached to OAc.

Wait, that would be 2+1+2+2=7 H, but the OAc's CH3 is 3H, making 10 H in total. But the NMR data only accounts for 8 H. So perhaps butenyl isn't the right path.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let's recount.

The structure would be CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc.

Protons:

- C1: CH2 (2H)
- C2: CH (1H)
- C3: CH2 (2H)
- C4: CH2OAc (2H)
But wait, OAc is an ester group, so the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH2-O-CO-OCH3.

So, the CH2CH2-O-CO-OCH3 would have the CH2 groups on C3 and C4. So, C3: CH2 (2H), C4: CH2 (2H) attached to O-CO-OCH3.

So, the protons are:

C1: 2H
C2: 1H
C3: 2H
C4: 2H
OAc: 3H (CH3)

Total: 2+1+2+2+3=10 H.

But the NMR shows only 8 H. So perhaps butenyl isn't correct.

So, perhaps it's a propenyl group.

But earlier, the propenyl structure didn't seem to fit the NMR data.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH3.

So the structure would be:

CH2=C(CH2OAc)CH3

In this case, the double bond is between C1 and C2. C2 has a CH2OAc group and a CH3 group.

The vinylic protons would be on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH).

But wait, C2 has a CH group attached to two substituents: CH2OAc and CH3.

So the C1's CH2 protons would be split by the C2's CH proton, leading to a triplet.

The C2's CH proton would be split by the C1's CH2 and perhaps the adjacent CH3.

Wait, but C2's CH is attached to C1's CH2 and C3's CH3. So the C2's proton would be coupled to the C1's two protons and the C3's three protons, leading to a complex splitting pattern.

But in the NMR, we have a 1H doublet at 7.0 ppm and a 1H doublet of quartets at 5.5 ppm.

So, perhaps the C2's proton is the 5.5 ppm signal, coupled to the CH2 and CH3 groups, leading to a doublet of quartets.

The C1's CH2 protons would be split into a triplet by the C2's CH, but in the NMR, we don't see a triplet, so that's conflicting.

Hmm. Another possibility: perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc.

But then, the structure would be CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3. That's not correct because the ester should be R-O-CO-O-R. So if R is CH2=CH-, then the structure is CH2=CH-O-CO-OCH3.

In this case, the vinylic protons would be on CH2 and CH.

The CH's proton would be coupled to the CH2's two protons, leading to a triplet, but the NMR shows a doublet at 7.0 ppm.

Hmm.

I think I'm going in circles here. Let me try to make a decision based on the available data.

The key points:

- The 7.0 ppm doublet with J=16 Hz suggests a trans coupling in a double bond.

- The 5.5 ppm doublet of quartets suggests coupling to two different groups.

- The 1.6 ppm doublet implies a methyl attached to a CH group adjacent to another group.

Looking at the options again:

Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate. Structure would be (E)-butenyl acetate: CH2=CHCH2CH2-OAc.

In this case, the C2's proton is coupled to the C1's CH2 (two protons) and perhaps the C3's CH2.

But the C2's proton would be a triplet, not a doublet, which doesn't match.

Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate: CH2=CHCH2-OAc, trans configuration.

In this case, the C2's proton is coupled to the C1's CH2 (two protons), leading to a triplet, but the NMR shows a doublet. So this doesn't fit.

Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. Same structure as B but cis. Again, the C2's proton would be a triplet, not a doublet.

Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate. Structure would be (Z)-butenyl acetate.

Again, the C2's proton would be coupled to C1's CH2, leading to a triplet, which doesn't match.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps the structure isn't propenyl or butenyl but has a different arrangement. Or perhaps the vinylic protons are not on the same carbon as I thought.

Another thought: perhaps the structure has a conjugated diene, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl group (1.6 ppm) is attached to the oxygen, but that would be an ethyl group, not a methyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2=CH-OAc, making the ester group OAc attached directly to the CH2.

But then, the vinylic protons would be on CH2 and CH, leading to the same issues as before.

I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about which option best fits the NMR data.

The 7.0 ppm doublet suggests a trans coupling of 16 Hz, so the correct structure must have a trans double bond.

Looking at the options, options B (trans-propenyl) and D (trans-butenyl) have trans configurations.

Now, considering the 5.5 ppm doublet of quartets. Perhaps this comes from a CH group adjacent to a CH2 and a methyl group.

In the case of propenyl, the CH group (C2) would be adjacent to CH2 (C1) and the OAc group (C3). But the OAc is a CH3, so perhaps the C2's CH is coupled to the C1's CH2 and the OAc's CH3.

Wait, but the OAc's CH3 is a singlet, so the C2's CH would couple to the OAc's CH3, leading to a quartet. But the C2's CH is also coupled to the C1's CH2, leading to another split.

So, the C2's CH would be a doublet of quartets, which matches the 5.5 ppm signal.

But earlier, I thought that C2's CH would be coupled to C1's CH2, leading to a triplet, but if it's also coupled to the OAc's CH3, that would add another split.

Wait, but the OAc's CH3 is attached to oxygen, so it's a singlet. So the C2's CH wouldn't couple to the OAc's CH3 because they're not adjacent. Only adjacent protons couple.

Ah! That's a key point. Protons couple with adjacent (vicinal) protons, not across the molecule.

So, the C2's CH is adjacent to C1's CH2 and C3's CH2 (in propenyl acetate). So the C2's CH is coupled to the two protons on C1's CH2, leading to a triplet. But the NMR shows a doublet, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the C2's CH is only coupled to one proton, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that the C2's CH is only coupled to the C3's CH2, but that's possible only if the C1's CH2 is equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the C3's CH2 is split into a singlet, but that's not the case.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck, but given the options, the one that has a trans double bond and fits the coupling would be either B or D.

But the singlet at 2.1 ppm is from OAc, so the R group is attached to oxygen.

Since the 1.6 ppm is a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps the structure is such that the R group is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3, but that's not one of the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.

But earlier, that didn't fit because of the triplet issue. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7.0 ppm is from the CH2 group, but that doesn't make sense because CH2 would have two protons and a singlet or a quartet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that the C2's CH is coupled to the C3's CH2, leading to a triplet, but that's not matching the NMR.

I think I'll have to make an educated guess here. The key is the 7.0 ppm doublet with J=16 Hz, which is a trans coupling. So the correct structure must have a trans double bond.

Among the options, the trans options are B and D.

Now, considering the 1.6 ppm signal. It's a doublet, so a methyl group attached to a CH, which is adjacent to another group.

In propenyl acetate, the structure is CH2=CHCH2-OAc. The CH2-OAc would be adjacent to the CH group. So the CH2's protons would be split by the CH group.

But the 1.6 ppm is a methyl group. Wait, the CH2-OAc group is CH2, so perhaps the 1.6 ppm is from a methyl group elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the structure isn't propenyl or butenyl but something else entirely. But the options are limited.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, another approach: the number of signals. The NMR has four signals, which suggests four distinct proton environments.

If the structure is cis-propenyl acetate (option C), the protons would be:

- C1's CH2 (2H, split into a triplet)
- C2's CH (1H, split into a doublet)
- C3's CH2 (2H, split into a triplet)
- OAc's CH3 (3H, singlet)

But that would lead to more signals than we have. Hmm. Unless some are overlapping or equivalent.

Alternatively, perhaps the C1's CH2 and C3's CH2 are equivalent, leading to a singlet for one of them. But that's unlikely.

I'm really stuck. I think the best approach is to conclude that the correct answer is option C: Cis-propenyl acetate. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's option D: Trans-butenyl acetate.

Wait, but the 1.6 ppm is a methyl group, which would be present in butenyl acetate. Hmm.

Another thought: the 5.5 ppm is a doublet of quartets. Quartets suggest coupling with three protons, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the 5.5 ppm is a CH group adjacent to a CH2 and a CH3. So the CH would be coupled to the CH2 (two protons, J1) and the CH3 (three protons, J2). Each coupling would split the signal, leading to a (n+1)(m+1) pattern, which would be (2+1)*(3+1)= 3*4=12 lines, but that's not possible. Instead, it would be a doublet of quartets, which matches the data.

So, the CH group would be adjacent to a CH2 and a CH3.

Which structure fits this? Perhaps the structure is CH2=CHCH(CH2OAc)CH3.

In this case, the CH group (C3) is adjacent to a CH2 (C2) and a CH3 (C4).

So, the C3's proton would be coupled to the C2's CH2 (two protons, J=?) and the C4's CH3 (three protons, J=??), leading to a doublet of quartets.

The C2's CH2 would be coupled to the C1's CH2 and the C3's CH, leading to a triplet.

The C4's CH3 would be a doublet because it's attached to the C3's CH.

So, the NMR signals would be:

- C1's CH2: triplet, integrating to 2H.
- C2's CH: doublet of quartets, integrating to 1H.
- C3's CH: doublet of quartets, integrating to 1H.
- C4's CH3: doublet, integrating to 3H.
- OAc's CH3: singlet, integrating to 3H.

But this doesn't match the given data, which has 7.0 ppm (1H, d), 5.5 ppm (1H, dq), 2.1 (3H, s), 1.6 (3H, d).

So, maybe in this structure, the C1's CH2 is the 7.0 ppm doublet. But why would it be a doublet? Because it's coupled to only one proton.

Wait, perhaps the C1's CH2 is only coupled to the C2's CH, leading to a triplet. But the data shows a doublet at 7.0 ppm.

I'm getting too tangled up here. Given the time I've spent, I'll make an educated guess that the correct answer is option C: Cis-propenyl acetate.


The question involves identifying an unknown organic compound based on its 1H NMR data. The options are Cis-butenyl acetate, Trans-propenyl acetate, Cis-propenyl acetate, and Trans-butenyl acetate. The provided NMR data is:

- **7.0 ppm (1H, d, J = 16.0 Hz)**  
- **5.5 ppm (1H, dq)**  
- **2.1 ppm (3H, s)**  
- **1.6 ppm (3H, d)**  

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **The 2.1 ppm singlet (3H)** corresponds to the methyl group of the acetate (OAc) ester, confirming the compound is an acetate ester.

2. **The 1.6 ppm doublet (3H)** indicates a methyl group attached to a CH group, which is adjacent to another group.

3. **The 7.0 ppm doublet (1H, J = 16.0 Hz)** suggests a vinylic proton coupled to another proton with a large coupling constant (J = 16 Hz), typical of a trans configuration across a double bond.

4. **The 5.5 ppm doublet of quartets (1H)** indicates a proton coupled to two different sets of protons, likely from adjacent groups.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A: Cis-butenyl acetate**  
  This structure has a double bond between C2 and C3, with substituents on the same side. The vinylic protons would be on C2 and C3. However, the coupling patterns and splitting do not align with the NMR data, as the 7.0 ppm signal would likely be a triplet due to coupling with the CH2 group on C1.

- **Option B: Trans-propenyl acetate**  
  This structure has a double bond between C1 and C2, with substituents on opposite sides. The vinylic protons would be on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH). The C2 proton would be coupled to the two protons on C1, leading to a triplet, which does not match the observed doublet at 7.0 ppm.

- **Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate**  
  This structure has a double bond between C1 and C2, with substituents on the same side. The vinylic protons would be on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH). The C2 proton would be coupled to the two protons on C1, leading to a triplet. However, this does not match the observed doublet at 7.0 ppm, suggesting this option is less likely.

- **Option D: Trans-butenyl acetate**  
  This structure has a double bond between C1 and C2, with substituents on opposite sides. The vinylic protons would be on C1 (CH2) and C2 (CH). The C2 proton would be coupled to the two protons on C1, leading to a triplet, which again does not match the observed doublet at 7.0 ppm.

### Conclusion:
The NMR data suggests a trans configuration across the double bond (due to the large J = 16 Hz coupling), but none of the options perfectly match the observed splitting patterns. Based on the reasoning provided, **Option C: Cis-propenyl acetate** is selected as the most plausible answer, despite some inconsistencies in the coupling patterns.
