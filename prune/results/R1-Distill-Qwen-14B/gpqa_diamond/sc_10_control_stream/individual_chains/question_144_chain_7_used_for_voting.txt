Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let's think it through. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving a distance in meters.

Wait, I remember that decay properties often involve the concept of the mean lifetime. But wait, decay distance depends on the lifetime and the velocity of the particle, right? Because the particle moves during its lifetime, so the distance is v multiplied by the lifetime.

So the formula should be something like decay distance = c * τ * v, where c is the speed of light, τ is the mean lifetime, and v is the particle's velocity.

But wait, I think there's another approach using the uncertainty principle or something related to the particle's lifetime. Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that Γ ≈ ħ / τ, which gives τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact relation. Let me get that straight. The uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For an unstable particle, the energy uncertainty ΔE is the width Γ, so Δt ≈ ħ/(2Γ). But I've heard that sometimes the mean lifetime τ is approximated as ħ/(Γ), so maybe I should double-check. Oh, perhaps the exact relation is Γ = ħ/τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. Hmm, wait, no, because the uncertainty principle gives ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2, so ΔE is Γ, so Δt is ~ ħ/(2Γ), but the mean lifetime τ is approximately that. Alternatively, I think in particle physics, the lifetime is often taken as τ ≈ ħ/(Γ), so maybe I should go with that. I'll proceed under that assumption.

So first, I need to compute τ. Let's get the numbers right. Γ is given as 320 MeV. Wait, but ħ has units of GeV·s, so I need to convert Γ into GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. The value of ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32. 0.32 × 20.56 is about 6.575, so roughly 20.56. So τ ≈ 20.56e-25 s. Wait, no, 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.566, so 20.566e-25 seconds. Wait, that's 2.0566e-24 seconds. Hmm, wait no: 6.582 / 0.32 is 20.566, so 20.566e-25 s is 2.0566e-24 s? Wait, no. 20.566 times 1e-25 is 2.0566e-24? Wait, 20.566e-25 = 2.0566e-24, yes. So τ ≈ 2.0566e-24 seconds.

Next, I need to find the velocity v of the meson. For that, I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, and the rest mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. So the energy is much higher than the rest mass, so the meson is moving at a relativistic speed.

The total energy E is given by E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So γ = E / (m c²). But since E is given as 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, E/(m) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So γ ≈ 6.6667.

The velocity v can be found from γ. The relation between γ and v is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Solving for v:

v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Since γ is large, 1/γ² is small, so we can approximate:

v ≈ c * sqrt(1 - (1/(γ²))) ≈ c * sqrt(1 - (1/ (44.444))), since γ is about 6.6667, γ² is about 44.444. Wait, 6.6667 squared is 44.444, yes.

So 1/(γ²) is about 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So v ≈ c * 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887c. 

But perhaps a better approach is to compute it more accurately. Let me compute v more accurately. Let me compute (v/c) = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

γ = 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667. So γ² = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444. So 1/γ² = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 1/γ² = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887, as I thought earlier. So v ≈ 0.9887c.

The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the decay distance is c * τ * (v/c) )? Wait, no: because the distance is v * τ. So decay distance = v * τ.

Wait, no. Decay distance is the velocity multiplied by the lifetime. So L = v * τ.

Wait, but in our case, v is a significant fraction of c, but perhaps I should express v in terms of c and then factor that in. Oh, since I have v = β c, where β = v/c. So L = β c * τ.

Alternatively, since I have β as 0.9887, L = 0.9887 * c * τ.

So let's compute L. c is 3e8 m/s. τ is approximately 2.0566e-24 seconds.

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.0566e-24 s.

Let me compute that.

First, 3e8 * 2.0566e-24 = 3 * 2.0566e-16 = 6.1698e-16 m.

Then, multiply by 0.9887: 6.1698e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.106e-16 m. Wait, that's about 6.106e-16 meters.

But looking at the options, the choices are A:5.02e-16, B:4.06e-15, C:5.02e-15, D:4.06e-16.

Hmm, none match 6e-16. So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back and check.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units when calculating Γ. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So when I compute τ = ħ / Γ, which is 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. That seems right.

Wait, but maybe I should use the full calculation without approximation for v, maybe my approximation was too rough. Alternatively, perhaps the mean decay length formula uses a different approach.

Wait, another approach: sometimes, the mean decay length is given by L = c * τ * β, where β is v/c. But wait, that's the same as what I did before.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me recalculate L.

Compute 3e8 m/s * 2.0566e-24 s = 6.1698e-16 meters. Then multiply by 0.9887, which is approximately 6.106e-16 m.

But the closest option is A:5.02e-16, which is lower than that. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating beta. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So, solving for p:

p = sqrt( (E/(c^2))^2 - (m)^2 ) * c.

Wait, no, because E has units of GeV, and m is GeV/c²? Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Wait, the relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). So, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

But since E is given as 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV. So (pc)^2 = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (GeV)^2.

So pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈ 7.91 GeV. So p = 7.91 GeV / c.

Then, the momentum p is 7.91 GeV / c.

The velocity can be found from p = gamma m v, where v is in units of c. Alternatively, beta = v/c = p c / (E).

Because p c = 7.91 GeV, E =8 GeV. So beta = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) ) = 7.91 /8 = 0.98875. So beta is indeed approximately 0.98875. So my earlier approximation was correct.

So, calculation of L: 0.98875 * c * τ = 0.98875 * (3e8 m/s) * 2.0566e-24 s.

Wait, let me compute 3e8 * 2.0566e-24 first. 3e8 is 3*1e8, and 2.0566e-24 is 2.0566 *1e-24. Multiplying them gives 3 * 2.0566 * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.1698 * 1e-16 = 6.1698e-16 m.

Then multiply by 0.98875: 6.1698e-16 * 0.98875 ≈ ?

Let me compute 6.1698 * 0.98875.

6.1698 * 0.98875 = ?

Let me compute 6 * 0.98875 = 5.9325, 0.1698 * 0.98875 ≈ 0.1681. So total is approximately 5.9325 + 0.1681 ≈ 6.0996e-16 m, so about 6.1e-16 m.

But the options don't have anything close to 6e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of τ, or in the approach.

Wait, is tau the same as the mean lifetime? Or is there another factor to consider, like the particle's speed.

Alternatively, maybe I should have used the relation involving the decay width and the energy.

Wait, another formula I've heard about is the decay length given by L = (E) * τ / m. Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, the mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. So that's 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate L as c * beta gamma tau, because in some sources, the lifetime observed is gamma tau. Oh wait, the lifetime tau is the proper lifetime, the one measured in the particle's rest frame. The lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. So the decay length is v multiplied by gamma tau.

Wait, but wait, because in the particle's rest frame, its lifetime is tau. But in the lab frame, it's gamma tau. So the lifetime observed is gamma tau. So the decay length is v * gamma tau.

Hmm, that's different from what I did earlier. So let me think again.

So, decay length L = v * gamma tau.

Wait, that makes sense because the particle is moving, and from our frame, it's lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So, the correct formula might be L = v * gamma tau.

In that case, I should compute L = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, because in the rest frame, the particle's lifetime is tau, so in the lab frame, it's gamma tau, and during that time, it's moving at velocity v, so the distance is v * gamma tau.

But wait, let me think about it again. The gamma factor comes from time dilation, so the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma. So the decay length is v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime, which is gamma tau. So yes, L = v gamma tau.

So, in that case, I need to compute gamma, which I have as 6.6667.

So let me recompute L.

v is 0.98875 c.

Gamma is 6.6667.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 0.98875 c * gamma * tau.

Wait, no, because v is beta c, so L = beta c * gamma tau.

Which can be written as L = beta gamma c tau.

So substituting the numbers:

beta = 0.98875

gamma = 6.6667

c = 3e8 m/s

tau = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 0.98875 * 6.6667 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute each step.

First, compute 0.98875 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.6114.

Then, multiply by 3e8: 6.6114 * 3e8 = 1.9834e9.

Then, multiply by 2.056875e-24: 1.9834e9 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Let me compute 1.9834e9 * 2.056875e-24.

1.9834e9 = 1.9834 * 1e9.

2.056875e-24 = 2.056875 * 1e-24.

Multiply them: 1.9834 * 2.056875 ≈ 4.08, because 2 * 2 is 4, and 0.056875 is a bit more.

Wait, let's compute it more accurately.

1.9834 * 2.056875.

Let me compute 2 * 1.9834 = 3.9668.

Then, 0.056875 * 1.9834 ≈ 0.113.

So total is approximately 3.9668 + 0.113 = 4.0798.

So 4.0798e(9 -24) = 4.0798e-15 meters.

So L ≈ 4.08e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.02e-15, etc. So 4.08 is close to 4.0655.

So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but why did I get a different result before when I didn't include gamma? Because I had previously considered L = v tau, which is v times the proper lifetime. But the correct approach is to use the dilated lifetime, which is gamma tau. So the decay distance becomes v * gamma tau, which is larger than what I had before.

So, the answer should be option B: 4.0655e-15 m.

To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for decay distance:

\[
L = v \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau
\]

where:
- \( v \) is the velocity of the particle,
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \tau \) is the mean lifetime.

### Step 1: Calculate the mean lifetime \( \tau \)
The mean lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), we compute:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the total energy, and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) is the rest mass. Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) can be expressed as:

\[
v = \beta c = \frac{p c}{E} \cdot c
\]

where \( p \) is the momentum. Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

\[
E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2
\]

we solve for \( p \):

\[
p = \sqrt{\frac{E^2 - (m c^2)^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{8^2 - 1.2^2}{1}} \, \text{GeV}/c \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV}/c.
\]

Thus:

\[
\beta = \frac{p c}{E} = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875,
\]

and:

\[
v = \beta c = 0.98875 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the decay distance \( L \)
Substituting into the formula \( L = v \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau \):

\[
L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot 6.6667 \cdot (2.0569 \times 10^{-24}) \, \text{m}.
\]

First, compute \( 2.966 \times 10^8 \cdot 6.6667 \):

\[
2.966 \times 10^8 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 1.9834 \times 10^9.
\]

Then, multiply by \( 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \):

\[
L = 1.9834 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \approx 4.08 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Match the result to the options
The closest option to \( 4.08 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).**

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about meson decay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on particle physics, but let's think it through. The question is about finding the mean decay distance of a meson resonance X. The given values are production energy E_X = 8 GeV, mass m_X = 1.2 GeV, and width Γ_X = 320 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving a distance in meters.

Wait, I remember that decay properties often involve the concept of the mean lifetime. But wait, decay distance depends on the lifetime and the velocity of the particle, right? Because the particle moves during its lifetime, so the distance is v multiplied by the lifetime.

So the formula should be something like decay distance = c * τ * v, where c is the speed of light, τ is the mean lifetime, and v is the particle's velocity.

But wait, I think there's another approach using the uncertainty principle or something related to the particle's lifetime. Oh right, the mean lifetime τ is related to the width Γ. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle says that Γ ≈ ħ / τ, which gives τ ≈ ħ / Γ. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact relation. Let me get that straight. The uncertainty principle states that ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2. For an unstable particle, the energy uncertainty ΔE is the width Γ, so Δt ≈ ħ/(2Γ). But I've heard that sometimes the mean lifetime τ is approximated as ħ/(Γ), so maybe I should double-check. Oh, perhaps the exact relation is Γ = ħ/τ, so τ = ħ / Γ. Hmm, wait, no, because the uncertainty principle gives ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/2, so ΔE is Γ, so Δt is ~ ħ/(2Γ), but the mean lifetime τ is approximately that. Alternatively, I think in particle physics, the lifetime is often taken as τ ≈ ħ/(Γ), so maybe I should go with that. I'll proceed under that assumption.

So first, I need to compute τ. Let's get the numbers right. Γ is given as 320 MeV. Wait, but ħ has units of GeV·s, so I need to convert Γ into GeV. 320 MeV is 0.32 GeV.

So τ = ħ / Γ. The value of ħ is approximately 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV·s. So τ = (6.582e-25 GeV·s) / (0.32 GeV) = (6.582 / 0.32) * 1e-25 s. Let me compute 6.582 / 0.32. 0.32 × 20.56 is about 6.575, so roughly 20.56. So τ ≈ 20.56e-25 s. Wait, no, 6.582 / 0.32 is approximately 20.566, so 20.566e-25 seconds. Wait, that's 2.0566e-24 seconds. Hmm, wait no: 6.582 / 0.32 is 20.566, so 20.566e-25 s is 2.0566e-24 s? Wait, no. 20.566 times 1e-25 is 2.0566e-24? Wait, 20.566e-25 = 2.0566e-24, yes. So τ ≈ 2.0566e-24 seconds.

Next, I need to find the velocity v of the meson. For that, I can use the relativistic energy-momentum relation. The production energy E_X is given as 8 GeV, and the rest mass m_X is 1.2 GeV. So the energy is much higher than the rest mass, so the meson is moving at a relativistic speed.

The total energy E is given by E = γ m c², where γ is the Lorentz factor. So γ = E / (m c²). But since E is given as 8 GeV and m is 1.2 GeV, E/(m) = 8 / 1.2 ≈ 6.6667. So γ ≈ 6.6667.

The velocity v can be found from γ. The relation between γ and v is γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Solving for v:

v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

Since γ is large, 1/γ² is small, so we can approximate:

v ≈ c * sqrt(1 - (1/(γ²))) ≈ c * sqrt(1 - (1/ (44.444))), since γ is about 6.6667, γ² is about 44.444. Wait, 6.6667 squared is 44.444, yes.

So 1/(γ²) is about 1/44.444 ≈ 0.0225. So 1 - 0.0225 = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887. So v ≈ c * 0.9887. So v ≈ 0.9887c. 

But perhaps a better approach is to compute it more accurately. Let me compute v more accurately. Let me compute (v/c) = sqrt(1 - (1/γ²)).

γ = 8 / 1.2 = 20/3 ≈ 6.6667. So γ² = (20/3)^2 = 400/9 ≈ 44.4444. So 1/γ² = 9/400 = 0.0225.

So 1 - 1/γ² = 0.9775. The square root of 0.9775 is approximately 0.9887, as I thought earlier. So v ≈ 0.9887c.

The speed of light c is approximately 3e8 m/s. So v ≈ 0.9887 * 3e8 ≈ 2.966e8 m/s.

Now, the decay distance is c * τ * (v/c) )? Wait, no: because the distance is v * τ. So decay distance = v * τ.

Wait, no. Decay distance is the velocity multiplied by the lifetime. So L = v * τ.

Wait, but in our case, v is a significant fraction of c, but perhaps I should express v in terms of c and then factor that in. Oh, since I have v = β c, where β = v/c. So L = β c * τ.

Alternatively, since I have β as 0.9887, L = 0.9887 * c * τ.

So let's compute L. c is 3e8 m/s. τ is approximately 2.0566e-24 seconds.

So L = 0.9887 * 3e8 m/s * 2.0566e-24 s.

Let me compute that.

First, 3e8 * 2.0566e-24 = 3 * 2.0566e-16 = 6.1698e-16 m.

Then, multiply by 0.9887: 6.1698e-16 * 0.9887 ≈ 6.106e-16 m. Wait, that's about 6.106e-16 meters.

But looking at the options, the choices are A:5.02e-16, B:4.06e-15, C:5.02e-15, D:4.06e-16.

Hmm, none match 6e-16. So I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me go back and check.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units when calculating Γ. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, Γ is given as 320 MeV, which is 0.32 GeV. So when I compute τ = ħ / Γ, which is 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = approximately 2.056875e-24 seconds. That seems right.

Wait, but maybe I should use the full calculation without approximation for v, maybe my approximation was too rough. Alternatively, perhaps the mean decay length formula uses a different approach.

Wait, another approach: sometimes, the mean decay length is given by L = c * τ * β, where β is v/c. But wait, that's the same as what I did before.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me recalculate L.

Compute 3e8 m/s * 2.0566e-24 s = 6.1698e-16 meters. Then multiply by 0.9887, which is approximately 6.106e-16 m.

But the closest option is A:5.02e-16, which is lower than that. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating beta. Let me compute gamma more accurately.

E is 8 GeV, m is 1.2 GeV. So E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So, solving for p:

p = sqrt( (E/(c^2))^2 - (m)^2 ) * c.

Wait, no, because E has units of GeV, and m is GeV/c²? Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Wait, the relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ). So, E² = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2.

But since E is given as 8 GeV, and m is 1.2 GeV. So (pc)^2 = (8)^2 - (1.2)^2 = 64 - 1.44 = 62.56 (GeV)^2.

So pc = sqrt(62.56) GeV ≈ 7.91 GeV. So p = 7.91 GeV / c.

Then, the momentum p is 7.91 GeV / c.

The velocity can be found from p = gamma m v, where v is in units of c. Alternatively, beta = v/c = p c / (E).

Because p c = 7.91 GeV, E =8 GeV. So beta = (7.91 GeV) / (8 GeV) ) = 7.91 /8 = 0.98875. So beta is indeed approximately 0.98875. So my earlier approximation was correct.

So, calculation of L: 0.98875 * c * τ = 0.98875 * (3e8 m/s) * 2.0566e-24 s.

Wait, let me compute 3e8 * 2.0566e-24 first. 3e8 is 3*1e8, and 2.0566e-24 is 2.0566 *1e-24. Multiplying them gives 3 * 2.0566 * 1e8 * 1e-24 = 6.1698 * 1e-16 = 6.1698e-16 m.

Then multiply by 0.98875: 6.1698e-16 * 0.98875 ≈ ?

Let me compute 6.1698 * 0.98875.

6.1698 * 0.98875 = ?

Let me compute 6 * 0.98875 = 5.9325, 0.1698 * 0.98875 ≈ 0.1681. So total is approximately 5.9325 + 0.1681 ≈ 6.0996e-16 m, so about 6.1e-16 m.

But the options don't have anything close to 6e-16. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of τ, or in the approach.

Wait, is tau the same as the mean lifetime? Or is there another factor to consider, like the particle's speed.

Alternatively, maybe I should have used the relation involving the decay width and the energy.

Wait, another formula I've heard about is the decay length given by L = (E) * τ / m. Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, the mean lifetime τ is given by τ = ħ / Γ. So that's 6.582e-25 GeV·s / 0.32 GeV = 2.056875e-24 s.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate L as c * beta gamma tau, because in some sources, the lifetime observed is gamma tau. Oh wait, the lifetime tau is the proper lifetime, the one measured in the particle's rest frame. The lab frame lifetime is gamma tau. So the decay length is v multiplied by gamma tau.

Wait, but wait, because in the particle's rest frame, its lifetime is tau. But in the lab frame, it's gamma tau. So the lifetime observed is gamma tau. So the decay length is v * gamma tau.

Hmm, that's different from what I did earlier. So let me think again.

So, decay length L = v * gamma tau.

Wait, that makes sense because the particle is moving, and from our frame, it's lifetime is longer due to time dilation. So, the correct formula might be L = v * gamma tau.

In that case, I should compute L = v * gamma * tau.

Wait, because in the rest frame, the particle's lifetime is tau, so in the lab frame, it's gamma tau, and during that time, it's moving at velocity v, so the distance is v * gamma tau.

But wait, let me think about it again. The gamma factor comes from time dilation, so the lifetime in the lab frame is longer by gamma. So the decay length is v multiplied by the lab frame lifetime, which is gamma tau. So yes, L = v gamma tau.

So, in that case, I need to compute gamma, which I have as 6.6667.

So let me recompute L.

v is 0.98875 c.

Gamma is 6.6667.

Tau is 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 0.98875 c * gamma * tau.

Wait, no, because v is beta c, so L = beta c * gamma tau.

Which can be written as L = beta gamma c tau.

So substituting the numbers:

beta = 0.98875

gamma = 6.6667

c = 3e8 m/s

tau = 2.056875e-24 s.

So L = 0.98875 * 6.6667 * 3e8 m/s * 2.056875e-24 s.

Let me compute each step.

First, compute 0.98875 * 6.6667 ≈ 6.6114.

Then, multiply by 3e8: 6.6114 * 3e8 = 1.9834e9.

Then, multiply by 2.056875e-24: 1.9834e9 * 2.056875e-24 = ?

Let me compute 1.9834e9 * 2.056875e-24.

1.9834e9 = 1.9834 * 1e9.

2.056875e-24 = 2.056875 * 1e-24.

Multiply them: 1.9834 * 2.056875 ≈ 4.08, because 2 * 2 is 4, and 0.056875 is a bit more.

Wait, let's compute it more accurately.

1.9834 * 2.056875.

Let me compute 2 * 1.9834 = 3.9668.

Then, 0.056875 * 1.9834 ≈ 0.113.

So total is approximately 3.9668 + 0.113 = 4.0798.

So 4.0798e(9 -24) = 4.0798e-15 meters.

So L ≈ 4.08e-15 meters.

Looking at the options, option B is 4.0655e-15 m, and option C is 5.02e-15, etc. So 4.08 is close to 4.0655.

So the correct answer would be option B.

Wait, but why did I get a different result before when I didn't include gamma? Because I had previously considered L = v tau, which is v times the proper lifetime. But the correct approach is to use the dilated lifetime, which is gamma tau. So the decay distance becomes v * gamma tau, which is larger than what I had before.

So, the answer should be option B: 4.0655e-15 m.


To determine the mean decay distance of the meson resonance \( X \), we use the formula for decay distance:

\[
L = v \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau
\]

where:
- \( v \) is the velocity of the particle,
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \tau \) is the mean lifetime.

### Step 1: Calculate the mean lifetime \( \tau \)
The mean lifetime \( \tau \) is related to the decay width \( \Gamma \) by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle:

\[
\tau = \frac{\hbar}{\Gamma}
\]

Given \( \Gamma = 320 \, \text{MeV} = 0.32 \, \text{GeV} \) and \( \hbar \approx 6.582 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{GeV·s} \), we compute:

\[
\tau = \frac{6.582 \times 10^{-25}}{0.32} \approx 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \)
The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is given by:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{m}
\]

where \( E = 8 \, \text{GeV} \) is the total energy, and \( m = 1.2 \, \text{GeV} \) is the rest mass. Substituting:

\[
\gamma = \frac{8}{1.2} \approx 6.6667.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
The velocity \( v \) can be expressed as:

\[
v = \beta c = \frac{p c}{E} \cdot c
\]

where \( p \) is the momentum. Using the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

\[
E^2 = (p c)^2 + (m c^2)^2
\]

we solve for \( p \):

\[
p = \sqrt{\frac{E^2 - (m c^2)^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{8^2 - 1.2^2}{1}} \, \text{GeV}/c \approx 7.91 \, \text{GeV}/c.
\]

Thus:

\[
\beta = \frac{p c}{E} = \frac{7.91}{8} \approx 0.98875,
\]

and:

\[
v = \beta c = 0.98875 \cdot 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \approx 2.966 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the decay distance \( L \)
Substituting into the formula \( L = v \cdot \gamma \cdot \tau \):

\[
L = (2.966 \times 10^8) \cdot 6.6667 \cdot (2.0569 \times 10^{-24}) \, \text{m}.
\]

First, compute \( 2.966 \times 10^8 \cdot 6.6667 \):

\[
2.966 \times 10^8 \cdot 6.6667 \approx 1.9834 \times 10^9.
\]

Then, multiply by \( 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \):

\[
L = 1.9834 \times 10^9 \cdot 2.0569 \times 10^{-24} \approx 4.08 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 5: Match the result to the options
The closest option to \( 4.08 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \) is:

**B) \( 4.0655 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} \).**
