Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about a chemical reaction involving Substance X and Liquid Y, and there are several clues given. I need to figure out what Substance X is, and then determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in it.

First, let's read the problem again carefully.

The reaction of Substance X with Liquid Y produces Gas W, a precipitate G, and releases heat. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. I remember that 277 K is roughly 4°C, which is the melting point of water (0°C is 273 K). Wait, 277 is about 4°C. Hmm, maybe B is something that freezes around that temperature. Or perhaps B is a gas that condenses? Not sure yet.

Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. That's an important clue. Let me think: a molecule where protons and neutrons are equal. So each atom in W has equal protons and neutrons. Wait, but W is a molecule, so maybe it's a diatomic gas. Let's think of possible gases. For example, H2O has different numbers, but maybe something else. Wait, O2 is O2. Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in the common isotope (O-16). So O2 would have 8 protons and 16 neutrons in each molecule, but that's not equal. Wait, maybe the molecule as a whole has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's see: suppose the molecule is CO2. But CO2 has 12 + 16*2 = 44 g/mol. Wait, but that's a molecule with 1 C and 2 O. The number of protons would be (6) + 2*(8) = 22 protons. Neutrons would be (6) + 2*(8) = 6 + 16 = 22. Oh wait, wait. Each C atom has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's C-12), each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So CO2 would have (6+2*8) protons and (6 + 2*8) neutrons. So 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So the molecule as a whole has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. So W could be CO2. But wait, CO2 is a gas, but under standard conditions it's a gas at room temperature. Hmm, but when Y reacts with X, it's a violent reaction. Another possibility: maybe W is something like CH4? No, because CH4 has 6 (C) + 4 (H) = 10 protons, and 6 (C) +4 (H) = 10 neutrons (if H is 1 each). Wait, but CH4 is a molecule with 5 carbons? No, wait, CH4 has 1 C and 4 H atoms. So protons: 6 +4 =10. Neutrons: 6 (C) + 4*(0) (if H is H1) =6. So 10 protons and 6 neutrons. Not equal. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe H2O. H2O has 2 H (each 1 proton) and 1 O (8 protons). So total protons: 2 +8 =10. Neutrons: 0 (H) +8 (O) =8. Not equal. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: Gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons in total. So, for example, if it's O2, each O-16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So total protons = 16, total neutrons =16. So 16 each. That would fit. So W could be O2, but O2 is diatomic. But wait, in the reaction, when X reacts with Y, the gas W is released. So if X and Y produce O2, what could that be? Maybe a reaction where a peroxide is decomposing? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps W is a noble gas like Ar, but Ar has 18 protons and 22 neutrons (Ar-40 is common). That's not equal. So maybe not. Another possibility: maybe the molecule has each atom contributing equally. Like, each atom has equal protons and neutrons. For example, carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (C-12). So if W is C2, but that's not a common molecule. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the reaction. X reacts with Y violently, producing W as a gas. Also, a precipitate G forms. When G is heated, B is released. B's melting point is around 277 K (about 4°C). Wait, what has a melting point near 4°C? Maybe something like water, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's something else. Oh, wait, maybe B is a solid that's melting around that temperature. Or perhaps B is a solid that's formed when G is heated.

Another clue: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So when X reacts with a keto acid, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Let me think: keto acids are like acetic acid, which is CH3COOH. When they react with something, maybe a base? Or perhaps X is a strong base? Another thought: if the product has two oxygen atoms, perhaps it's a salt with two oxygen-containing groups. For example, if X is a metal, maybe reacting with the acid to form a salt with two O's. Like, maybe sodium hydroxide (NaOH) reacting with acetic acid to form sodium acetate (CH3COO-Na+). Sodium acetate has two O's in the acetate ion. But that product has two O's in the anion. But wait, the question says the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So maybe it's something else.

Wait, another angle: the product of the reaction is a molecule with two O atoms. Or perhaps a salt with two O's. Or maybe it's a dehydration product, but that seems less likely.

The other thing is that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an isotope that's heavier than the common one. So perhaps X is a metal with a heavy isotope, like chlorine, which has a heavy isotope Cl-35 or Cl-37. But I'm not sure yet.

Also, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common reagents include things like Grignard reagents (like Mg-based), or maybe something like LiAlH4. Wait, but Grignard reagents are RMgX, which react with carbonyl groups. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal that's used in some kind of substitution reactions.

Wait, the reaction of X with Y forms a precipitate G. So perhaps Y is water, and X is a metal that reacts violently with water. For example, sodium or potassium reacts with water to form NaOH, H2 gas, and heat. But in this case, Gas W is H2. Let's check: H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons (since H is 1^1H). So protons:2, neutrons:0. Not equal. So that can't be W. Hmm. So maybe Y is not water.

Wait, another possibility: Y could be an acid. If X is a carbonate, perhaps when it reacts with an acid (like HCl), it produces CO2 gas. Let's think: if W is CO2, then the molecule would have 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 44. Protons: 6 (C) + 2*8 (O) = 22. Neutrons: 6 (C) + 2*8 (O) = 22. So 22 each. So that fits. So W is CO2.

So if X is a carbonate, and Y is a strong acid, their reaction would produce CO2 gas, water, and a salt precipitate. But then the precipitate G would form, perhaps a carbonate reacting with an acid to form a soluble salt. Wait, but if it's a carbonate and an acid, the products are CO2, H2O, and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, it would precipitate. But if Y is a strong acid, like HCl, and X is a carbonate (like CaCO3), the reaction would produce CO2, H2O, and CaCl2, which is soluble. So maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfite or another salt.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a base, and X is an acid. Hmm, but the reaction is violent, so maybe it's a metal reacting with an acid.

Wait, another thought: if X is a metal, and Y is an acid, then the reaction produces hydrogen gas. But earlier we saw that H2 doesn't fit W's description. Unless W is another gas.

Wait, let me think about another possibility. Suppose X is a carbonate, Y is an acid, and the reaction produces CO2. Then, when the precipitate G is heated, it releases B. If G is a carbonate, heating it might not release anything unless it's a decomposition reaction. Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide that dehydrates upon heating.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal carbonate, and Y is an acid. The reaction would produce CO2 gas, and the salt would be the corresponding acid's salt. If the salt is insoluble, it would precipitate. For example, if X is CaCO3 and Y is HCl, the reaction would produce CaCl2, H2O, and CO2. But CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Unless Y is something else.

Wait, maybe Y is not an acid. Maybe Y is a solution of a salt that reacts with X to produce a precipitate. For example, Y could be a solution of NaOH, and X is a metal nitrate. Then, the reaction could produce a precipitate of the metal hydroxide. But then, what gas would be released? If X is aluminum nitrate and Y is NaOH, the reaction produces Al(OH)3 precipitate and NaNO3. But no gas is released, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution containing sulfide ions. If X is a metal, then the reaction could produce H2S gas. But H2S has 2 protons and 32 neutrons (each S has 16 neutrons, 2 H have 1 each). So 2 protons, 34 neutrons? Doesn't match. So W wouldn't fit.

Wait, going back to the W idea. If W is CO2, then the reaction must produce CO2. So X and Y reacting to produce CO2. Let's think about what produces CO2 upon reaction. Possible reactions are decomposition of carbonates, bicarbonates, or reactions where carbonate reacts with an acid.

So if X is a carbonate, Y is an acid, then W is CO2. Then, the precipitate G would be the corresponding acid's salt. For example, if X is CaCO3 and Y is HCl, then the products are CaCl2 (which is soluble, so no precipitate). Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps G is a different product. Maybe X is a sulfide, and Y is an acid, producing H2S gas. But earlier that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps X is a hydroxide, and Y is an acid—no, that would produce water and a salt, but no gas.

Wait, another angle: What if X is a metal and Y is a strong base, like NaOH? Then, perhaps the reaction releases H2 gas. But as before, H2 doesn't fit W's condition.

Wait, maybe Y is a carbonate, and X is a metal. No, that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal with a heavy isotope, and Y is a solution that reacts with it to produce H2 gas. But again, H2 doesn't fit.

Wait, let me think about B. B is released when G is heated, and its melting point is about 277 K. 277 K is 4°C. What has a melting point around there? Maybe something like water, but water freezes at 273 K (0°C). Alternatively, perhaps it's a different substance. Wait, another thought: maybe B is a solid form of CO2, but that doesn't make sense since dry ice (solid CO2) sublimates at -78°C. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal. Wait, not sure. Another approach: maybe G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes into something else, releasing B. For example, if G is a carbonate, heating it could release CO2 and form a metal oxide. But earlier, that didn't seem to fit.

Wait, maybe G is a hydroxide. If G is a metal hydroxide, heating it might produce a metal oxide and release water. But water is a liquid, not a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a sulfate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the last clue: the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Let's think about that. If X is a metal, say sodium, and the keto acid is acetic acid, then the reaction would produce sodium acetate. Sodium acetate has the formula CH3COO-Na+. The acetate ion (CH3COO-) has two oxygen atoms. So the product would have two O's. That fits the clue. So if X is sodium, then reacting with a keto acid would give a product with two O's.

So maybe X is sodium metal. But sodium reacts violently with water, producing H2 gas. Earlier, H2 doesn't fit W's condition of equal protons and neutrons. So that might not be right.

Wait, another possibility: X is magnesium. Mg reacts with water (especially under certain conditions) to produce H2 gas. Again, W would be H2, which doesn't fit the condition.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think about other possibilities for X.

Wait, another thought: X could be a heavy isotope-containing compound. For example, chlorine has a heavy isotope, Cl-37. If X is something like CHCl3 (chloroform), but I'm not sure how that fits. Alternatively, perhaps X is a halogen, like Cl2, but then reacting with Y would produce what?

Alternatively, maybe X is something like NaOH, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the clue about the product: a certain keto acid reacts with X to form a product with 2 O atoms. If X is NaOH, then reacting with a keto acid (like acetic acid) would produce sodium acetate, which has two O's in the acetate ion. That fits. So perhaps X is NaOH, but that's a base, not a metal. Hmm.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms. If X is NaOH and Y is a salt, like a nitrate, perhaps the reaction would produce a precipitate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps Substance X is a carbonate, as earlier thought. Let's say X is Na2CO3. Reacting with Y (maybe HCl) would produce CO2 gas, NaCl, and H2O. So W is CO2, which fits the condition of equal protons and neutrons. Then, the precipitate G would be NaCl, which is soluble. Wait, that wouldn't precipitate. Hmm, maybe I'm off.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of BaCl2, and X is Na2SO4. Then the reaction would produce BaSO4 precipitate and NaCl. But then W would be nothing, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the heavy isotope. X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, for example, if X is a compound containing Cl, which has a heavy isotope (Cl-35 or 37), that could be possible.

Wait, another approach: the product of X with a keto acid has 2 O's. Let's think of the keto acid as something like acetic acid, CH3COOH. When it reacts with a base like NaOH, it forms sodium acetate, which has two O's in the acetate ion. So the product has two O's. So X could be NaOH. But then, X (NaOH) reacting with Y (maybe something else) would produce what?

If X is NaOH, what would Y be that reacts violently? Maybe Y is a strong acid, like H2SO4. Then the reaction would produce water and Na2SO4. But no gas would be released, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, Y could be a metal carbonate. If X is NaOH and Y is CO2, then no reaction would occur. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal, and when it reacts with a solution of a carbonate (Y), it displaces the metal, producing CO2 gas. For example, if X is Mg and Y is Na2CO3. The reaction would produce MgCO3 (which might precipitate), CO2 gas, and NaOH. Wait, but MgCO3 is not very soluble, so it would precipitate. Then, when the precipitate is heated, it might decompose into MgO and CO2. But that's just a guess.

But then, the product of X (Mg) reacting with a keto acid (like CH3COOH) would be Mg acetate, which contains Mg(CH3COO)2. Each acetate has two O's, but the entire molecule has more O's. Wait, but the question says the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal with a heavy isotope, like potassium (K has a heavy isotope). So X is K. Reacting K with an acid (like H2O) would produce H2 gas. But as before, H2 doesn't fit W's condition.

Wait, let me think again about Gas W. If W has the same number of protons and neutrons, perhaps it's CO2 as I thought earlier. Then, what produces CO2? A reaction between a carbonate and an acid. So X could be a carbonate, Y an acid. Then, W is CO2, which fits.

So, when X (a carbonate) reacts with Y (an acid), it produces CO2, H2O, and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, it precipitates as G. Then, when G is heated, perhaps it decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. But then B would be the metal oxide. But earlier, B's melting point is about 277 K, which is about 4°C. So a metal oxide that melts at 4°C? Unlikely, as most metal oxides have much higher melting points.

Wait, perhaps B is something else. If G is a carbonate, heating it could decompose into CO2 and the corresponding metal oxide. But then, B would be the metal oxide. But if the metal oxide is something like Na2O, which has a high melting point, that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe G is a hydroxide, and upon heating, it loses water to form an oxide. For example, heating Mg(OH)2 would produce MgO and water vapor. But I'm not sure how that connects to B's melting point.

Wait, another idea: perhaps B is a solid with a low melting point. For example, something like ice. But ice's melting point is 273 K, which is 0°C. The problem says 277 K, which is 4°C. Close but not exact. Maybe B is another compound that's solid at 4°C.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different form of carbon, like graphite or diamond, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the other clues again.

Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. So, perhaps X is a Grignard reagent? Grignard reagents are organometallic compounds, like MgBrCH2CH3. They are used in reactions with carbonyl compounds. But then, what would X be in this context?

Wait, Grignard reagents react with ketones to form secondary alcohols. But in this case, the product would have oxygen. But the clue says the product has 2 atoms of oxygen. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4), which is a strong reducing agent. But I'm not sure how that fits.

Wait, another thought: if X is a heavy isotope-containing compound, like Cl-37 in chloroform (CHCl3), but I'm not sure how that fits the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a transition metal with a heavy isotope. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's try to summarize:

- Gas W has equal protons and neutrons per molecule. CO2 fits this, as each molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons.

- X reacts with Y to produce W (CO2), a precipitate G, and releases heat.

So, X is a carbonate, Y is an acid. Let's say X is Na2CO3, Y is HCl.

Reaction: Na2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + H2O + CO2↑.

The precipitate would form if NaCl is insoluble, but NaCl is highly soluble, so no precipitate. So that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a different acid. Or X is a different carbonate.

Wait, perhaps X is CaCO3 and Y is HCl. Then, reaction produces CaCl2, H2O, and CO2. CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe Y is not an acid but something else. Let's think about other possibilities.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a salt that reacts with X to form a precipitate and release CO2. For example, if X is Na2CO3 and Y is Ba(NO3)2. The reaction would produce BaCO3 precipitate and NaNO3. BaCO3 is insoluble, so it would precipitate. And no gas is released, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution containing AgNO3. Then, X (Na2CO3) would react to form Ag2CO3, which is not very soluble. But again, no gas is released.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution of H2SO4. Then, reacting with Na2CO3 would produce CO2, H2O, and Na2SO4. Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the precipitate G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. So, when G is heated, it releases CO2 (B?), but that would mean B is CO2. But earlier, B's melting point is 277 K, which is about 4°C, which is higher than CO2's melting point (which is way lower). So perhaps that's not right.

Wait, maybe B is the metal oxide. For example, if G is a metal carbonate, heating it decomposes into metal oxide and CO2. The metal oxide (B) would have a melting point around 277 K. Hmm, but most metal oxides have much higher melting points. For example, Na2O has a melting point around 1380°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is the oxide of a metal with a low melting point. Which metals have oxides that melt around 4°C? Hmm, not sure. Maybe something like HgO? No, HgO's melting point is around 1600°C. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is not a metal oxide but another compound. Maybe something organic. For example, if G is a carbonate of a metal that, when heated, releases CO2 and leaves a residue of the metal, but that doesn't make sense.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about the possible answers. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

Wait, the question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X. So, if X is composed of two elements, say A and B, with A being lighter and B heavier, then I need to find their atomic masses and add them.

For example, if X is NaCl, the elements are Na and Cl. Na has atomic mass ~23, Cl ~35.5. So sum is 58.5. But none of the options are close to 58.5. So perhaps X has elements with lower masses.

Wait, if X is something like CH3Cl (chloroform), then elements are C, H, Cl. The lightest would be H (1), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5. The options include 35 (option A) and 31 (option C). Hmm, maybe X is something else.

Wait, if X is NaOH. Na (23), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24. Not an option.

Wait, another thought: if X is a diatomic molecule. For example, if X is O2, but that doesn't have a heavy isotope incorporated. Or X is Cl2, which has Cl-35 and Cl-37. So, Cl has a heavy isotope. So if X is Cl2, the lightest element is Cl (35) and the heaviest is Cl (37). So sum is 35 +37=72. Not an option.

Wait, maybe X is a compound with two elements, one light and one heavy. For example, if X is CHCl3 (chloroform), the elements are C (12), H (1), Cl (35.5). Lightest is H (1), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5. Closest option is A)35.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CCl4. Then, elements are C (12) and Cl (35.5). Sum is 12 +35.5 =47.5. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal with a heavy isotope, like potassium (K). K's common isotope is K-39, but it also has K-41. So if X is K, then the lightest isotope is K-39 (39), the heaviest K-41 (41). Sum is 39+41=80. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with elements that have the lightest and heaviest isotopes. For example, if X is HCl, which has H (1) and Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5. Again, close to option A (35).

Wait, but the question says "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So if X is HCl, the lightest element is H (1), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5.

But none of the options are 36.5. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, another angle: maybe X is a compound containing two elements, one with the lightest atomic mass and one with the heaviest. For example, if X is something like LiCl. Li has atomic mass ~7, Cl ~35.5. Sum is 42.5. Still not matching options.

Wait, maybe X contains elements with lower masses. For example, if X is NaCl, sum is 23+35.5=58.5. Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the answer options again.

Options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

If the sum is 29, possible combinations could be 1 +28 (unlikely, as 28 is silicon), or 15 +14 (but that's nitrogen and carbon). Alternatively, 12 +17 (carbon and chlorine, sum 29). So, 29 would be C + F? Wait, no, F is 19. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, 29 is option D. So if the lightest is 12 (C) and the heaviest is 17 (Cl?), but Cl is 35.5. So that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the elements in X are not two but more, but the question says "lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So, take the lightest and heaviest elements in X, sum their atomic masses.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a diatomic molecule like O2, but that doesn't have a heavy isotope incorporated. Alternatively, maybe X is a heavier element with a heavy isotope, like I (Iodine), but I's atomic mass is around 127.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with elements like H and something else. For example, if X is H2O, but that doesn't have a heavy isotope incorporated. Wait, but if X is H2O where one H is deuterium (heavy isotope), then the elements are H and O. So sum is 1 +16=17. Not an option.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the cumulative atomic masses are of the lightest and heaviest isotopes present in X. For example, if X is Cl2, the lightest isotope is Cl-35 (35) and heaviest is Cl-37 (37). Sum is 72. But that's not an option. Alternatively, if X is something like CHCl3, the isotopes could be Cl-35 and Cl-37. But the question says "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X", which refers to the elements, not isotopes.

Wait, perhaps the elements are C and Cl in CHCl3. So C (12) and Cl (35.5). Sum is 47.5, not an option.

Alternatively, if X is something like NaCl, the elements are Na (23) and Cl (35.5). Sum is 58.5. Not an option.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the answer options again. The options are 35,25,31,29.

If the sum is 35, perhaps the lightest element is O (16) and the heaviest is F (19). 16+19=35. But I don't see how that fits.

Wait, another possibility: maybe X is a compound containing two elements, one of which is hydrogen (1) and the other is something else. For example, if X is CH4, then elements are C (12) and H (1). Sum is 13. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like NH3. Elements are N (14) and H (1). Sum is 15. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound containing the lightest element (H) and another element with atomic mass 34 (like Se, but that's 79). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the sum is 35. So, 35 could be the sum of 16 (O) and 19 (F), but that's 35. Alternatively, 12 (C) + 23 (Na) = 35. So if X is a compound containing C and Na, the sum would be 35. But what would X be then?

If X is something like Na2CO3, the elements are Na, C, O. The lightest is C (12) and heaviest Na (23). Sum is 12+23=35, which is option A.

Wait, that fits! So if X is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), then the lightest element is C (12) and the heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 35, which is option A.

Does this fit with the other clues?

Let me check:

- X is Na2CO3, which reacts with an acid (Y) like HCl. The reaction produces CO2 gas (W), which has 22 protons and 22 neutrons, fitting the condition.

- The precipitate G would be NaCl, but NaCl is soluble. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps Y is a different acid. Or perhaps X is a different carbonate. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution containing something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a different carbonate, like CaCO3. Then, when it reacts with HCl, it produces CO2, H2O, and CaCl2. CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. That doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe Y is not an acid. Another possibility: Y is a solution of AgNO3, and X is Na2CO3. The reaction produces Ag2CO3 precipitate and NaNO3. But NaNO3 is soluble, so precipitate is Ag2CO3. Then, when Ag2CO3 is heated, it decomposes into 2Ag + CO2. So B would be Ag. But the melting point of Ag is about 961°C, which is way higher than 277 K (4°C). So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G is NaCl, which when heated doesn't change. So B would be NaCl, which has a melting point of about 801°C, which is way higher than 277 K.

So that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about X being Na2CO3. Maybe X is something else.

Another thought: if X is NaOH, and Y is something else. For example, Y could be a solution of Al(NO3)3. Then, X (NaOH) reacts with Al(NO3)3 to produce Al(OH)3 precipitate and NaNO3. So W would be nothing, which doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe X is a metal and Y is an acid. Let's say X is Mg and Y is H2SO4. The reaction produces MgSO4, H2O, and H2 gas. But H2 doesn't fit W's condition.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal with a heavy isotope, like potassium (K). K reacts with water to produce H2 gas, but again, H2 doesn't fit.

Wait, another angle: perhaps W is not CO2 but another gas. Let me think of other possibilities.

If W has equal protons and neutrons per molecule, maybe it's O2. O2 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons each atom, so 16 protons and 16 neutrons for O2. That fits. So W could be O2.

Then, what reaction produces O2 gas? Decomposition of a peroxide, like H2O2 → 2H2O + O2. So if X is H2O2, and Y is a catalyst, then O2 is released. But the question says X reacts with Y, which is a liquid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a peroxide, like Na2O2, and Y is water. The reaction would produce O2. So:

2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑.

So W is O2, which fits the condition.

Then, the precipitate G would be NaOH, which is soluble. Hmm, that's not a precipitate. So perhaps that's not right.

Alternatively, if X is a carbonate and Y is something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal peroxide, like K2O2. Reacting with Y (maybe water) to produce O2 and KOH. But KOH is soluble, so no precipitate.

Hmm, not helpful.

Another approach: perhaps W is N2 gas. But N2 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons each atom. So N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That fits the condition. But what reaction produces N2 gas?

Hmm, not sure. Decomposition of nitrates? Not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps W is Ne gas, but Ne has 10 protons and 10 neutrons (Ne-20). So that fits. But what reaction produces Ne? Unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck because I'm not considering all possibilities. Let me try to think differently.

If W is CO2, then X is a carbonate. So when X reacts with Y (an acid), CO2 is released. The precipitate G would form if the salt produced is insoluble. For example, if X is CaCO3 and Y is HNO3, the reaction would produce Ca(NO3)2, H2O, and CO2. Ca(NO3)2 is soluble, so no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate, and X is a carbonate of a metal that forms an insoluble nitrate. That's possible only if the nitrate is insoluble. But most nitrates are soluble. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfide. Then, X (a carbonate) reacting with Y would produce a sulfide, carbonate, and perhaps CO2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the precipitate G comes from another reaction. For example, X is Na2CO3, Y is AgNO3. Reaction produces Ag2CO3 (insoluble) and NaNO3. So W would be nothing, which doesn't fit. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if X is Na2CO3 and Y is H2SO4, the reaction produces Na2SO4, H2O, and CO2. Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think about the other clue: the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.

If X is NaOH, and the keto acid is, say, acetic acid, the product is sodium acetate (CH3COONa), which has two oxygen atoms in the acetate ion. That fits. So X could be NaOH.

But then, what is Y? If X is NaOH and Y is something else, perhaps a carbonate. Let's say Y is CO2. Then, NaOH + CO2 → Na2CO3 + H2O. No gas is released, so W isn't produced. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid. Like HCl. Then, X (NaOH) would react with HCl to produce NaCl and H2O. No gas is released, which doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal carbonate, and Y is an acid. The reaction produces CO2, and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, it precipitates. So, for example, X is PbCO3, Y is HCl. Reaction: PbCO3 + 2 HCl → PbCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O. PbCl2 is slightly soluble, so it might precipitate. Then, W is CO2, which fits.

When G (PbCl2) is heated, perhaps it decomposes. Heating PbCl2 produces PbO, HCl gas, and maybe other products. But I'm not sure about the melting point of B. Alternatively, perhaps B is something else.

Wait, perhaps when G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point of 277 K. So B is solid at 277 K. But earlier, I thought 277 K is about 4°C. So B would be a solid at that temperature.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let me try to proceed with the assumption that X is Na2CO3, even though it doesn't fit the precipitate part.

If X is Na2CO3, then the lightest element is C (12), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 35, which is option A.

So the answer would be A)35.

The problem involves identifying Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, and analyzing its reaction with Liquid Y. The reaction produces Gas W, a precipitate G, and releases heat. Gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons in its molecule. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point of approximately 277 K (4°C). Additionally, the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. The goal is to determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. CO₂ fits this condition, as it has 22 protons and 22 neutrons in total. This suggests that W is likely CO₂, which is produced when a carbonate reacts with an acid.

2. **Substance X**: Since W is CO₂, X is likely a carbonate. When X reacts with an acid (Y), it produces CO₂ gas, water, and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, it forms a precipitate G. For example, if X is sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) and Y is an acid like HCl, the reaction produces CO₂, H₂O, and NaCl. However, NaCl is soluble, so this does not fit the precipitate condition. Other carbonates like CaCO₃ also do not produce insoluble salts in such reactions.

3. **Precipitate G and Heating**: When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point of 277 K (4°C). If G is a carbonate, heating it could decompose into a metal oxide and CO₂. However, most metal oxides have much higher melting points, making this unlikely. The exact identity of G and B remains unclear, but the focus shifts to identifying X based on other clues.

4. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of X reacting with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. For example, if X is sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and the keto acid is acetic acid (CH₃COOH), the product is sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), which contains 2 oxygen atoms in the acetate ion. This suggests X could be NaOH.

5. **Atomic Masses of Elements in X**: If X is NaOH, the elements are Na (23) and O (16). The lightest element is H (1), and the heaviest is Na (23). The cumulative atomic masses are 1 + 23 = 24, which does not match the options. However, if X is sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃), the elements are Na (23), C (12), and O (16). The lightest element is C (12), and the heaviest is Na (23). The cumulative atomic masses are 12 + 23 = 35, which matches option A.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible identity for X is sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃). The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest (C) and heaviest (Na) elements in X are 12 and 23, respectively, giving a total of 35.

**Answer: A**

Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about a chemical reaction involving Substance X and Liquid Y, and there are several clues given. I need to figure out what Substance X is, and then determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in it.

First, let's read the problem again carefully.

The reaction of Substance X with Liquid Y produces Gas W, a precipitate G, and releases heat. When G is heated, it releases B. The melting point of B is close to 277 K. I remember that 277 K is roughly 4°C, which is the melting point of water (0°C is 273 K). Wait, 277 is about 4°C. Hmm, maybe B is something that freezes around that temperature. Or perhaps B is a gas that condenses? Not sure yet.

Gas W's molecule has the same number of neutrons and protons. That's an important clue. Let me think: a molecule where protons and neutrons are equal. So each atom in W has equal protons and neutrons. Wait, but W is a molecule, so maybe it's a diatomic gas. Let's think of possible gases. For example, H2O has different numbers, but maybe something else. Wait, O2 is O2. Each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in the common isotope (O-16). So O2 would have 8 protons and 16 neutrons in each molecule, but that's not equal. Wait, maybe the molecule as a whole has same number of protons and neutrons. Let's see: suppose the molecule is CO2. But CO2 has 12 + 16*2 = 44 g/mol. Wait, but that's a molecule with 1 C and 2 O. The number of protons would be (6) + 2*(8) = 22 protons. Neutrons would be (6) + 2*(8) = 6 + 16 = 22. Oh wait, wait. Each C atom has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (if it's C-12), each O has 8 protons and 8 neutrons (O-16). So CO2 would have (6+2*8) protons and (6 + 2*8) neutrons. So 22 protons and 22 neutrons. So the molecule as a whole has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. So W could be CO2. But wait, CO2 is a gas, but under standard conditions it's a gas at room temperature. Hmm, but when Y reacts with X, it's a violent reaction. Another possibility: maybe W is something like CH4? No, because CH4 has 6 (C) + 4 (H) = 10 protons, and 6 (C) +4 (H) = 10 neutrons (if H is 1 each). Wait, but CH4 is a molecule with 5 carbons? No, wait, CH4 has 1 C and 4 H atoms. So protons: 6 +4 =10. Neutrons: 6 (C) + 4*(0) (if H is H1) =6. So 10 protons and 6 neutrons. Not equal. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe H2O. H2O has 2 H (each 1 proton) and 1 O (8 protons). So total protons: 2 +8 =10. Neutrons: 0 (H) +8 (O) =8. Not equal. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: Gas W's molecule has same number of protons and neutrons in total. So, for example, if it's O2, each O-16 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons. So O2 would have 16 protons and 16 neutrons. So total protons = 16, total neutrons =16. So 16 each. That would fit. So W could be O2, but O2 is diatomic. But wait, in the reaction, when X reacts with Y, the gas W is released. So if X and Y produce O2, what could that be? Maybe a reaction where a peroxide is decomposing? Not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps W is a noble gas like Ar, but Ar has 18 protons and 22 neutrons (Ar-40 is common). That's not equal. So maybe not. Another possibility: maybe the molecule has each atom contributing equally. Like, each atom has equal protons and neutrons. For example, carbon has 6 protons and 6 neutrons (C-12). So if W is C2, but that's not a common molecule. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about the reaction. X reacts with Y violently, producing W as a gas. Also, a precipitate G forms. When G is heated, B is released. B's melting point is around 277 K (about 4°C). Wait, what has a melting point near 4°C? Maybe something like water, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's something else. Oh, wait, maybe B is a solid that's melting around that temperature. Or perhaps B is a solid that's formed when G is heated.

Another clue: The product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with Substance X contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So when X reacts with a keto acid, the product has 2 oxygen atoms. Let me think: keto acids are like acetic acid, which is CH3COOH. When they react with something, maybe a base? Or perhaps X is a strong base? Another thought: if the product has two oxygen atoms, perhaps it's a salt with two oxygen-containing groups. For example, if X is a metal, maybe reacting with the acid to form a salt with two O's. Like, maybe sodium hydroxide (NaOH) reacting with acetic acid to form sodium acetate (CH3COO-Na+). Sodium acetate has two O's in the acetate ion. But that product has two O's in the anion. But wait, the question says the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So maybe it's something else.

Wait, another angle: the product of the reaction is a molecule with two O atoms. Or perhaps a salt with two O's. Or maybe it's a dehydration product, but that seems less likely.

The other thing is that Substance X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements. So X has an isotope that's heavier than the common one. So perhaps X is a metal with a heavy isotope, like chlorine, which has a heavy isotope Cl-35 or Cl-37. But I'm not sure yet.

Also, X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. Common reagents include things like Grignard reagents (like Mg-based), or maybe something like LiAlH4. Wait, but Grignard reagents are RMgX, which react with carbonyl groups. Alternatively, maybe X is a metal that's used in some kind of substitution reactions.

Wait, the reaction of X with Y forms a precipitate G. So perhaps Y is water, and X is a metal that reacts violently with water. For example, sodium or potassium reacts with water to form NaOH, H2 gas, and heat. But in this case, Gas W is H2. Let's check: H2 has 2 protons and 0 neutrons (since H is 1^1H). So protons:2, neutrons:0. Not equal. So that can't be W. Hmm. So maybe Y is not water.

Wait, another possibility: Y could be an acid. If X is a carbonate, perhaps when it reacts with an acid (like HCl), it produces CO2 gas. Let's think: if W is CO2, then the molecule would have 12 (C) + 16*2 (O) = 44. Protons: 6 (C) + 2*8 (O) = 22. Neutrons: 6 (C) + 2*8 (O) = 22. So 22 each. So that fits. So W is CO2.

So if X is a carbonate, and Y is a strong acid, their reaction would produce CO2 gas, water, and a salt precipitate. But then the precipitate G would form, perhaps a carbonate reacting with an acid to form a soluble salt. Wait, but if it's a carbonate and an acid, the products are CO2, H2O, and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, it would precipitate. But if Y is a strong acid, like HCl, and X is a carbonate (like CaCO3), the reaction would produce CO2, H2O, and CaCl2, which is soluble. So maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps X is a sulfite or another salt.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a base, and X is an acid. Hmm, but the reaction is violent, so maybe it's a metal reacting with an acid.

Wait, another thought: if X is a metal, and Y is an acid, then the reaction produces hydrogen gas. But earlier we saw that H2 doesn't fit W's description. Unless W is another gas.

Wait, let me think about another possibility. Suppose X is a carbonate, Y is an acid, and the reaction produces CO2. Then, when the precipitate G is heated, it releases B. If G is a carbonate, heating it might not release anything unless it's a decomposition reaction. Alternatively, perhaps G is a hydroxide that dehydrates upon heating.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal carbonate, and Y is an acid. The reaction would produce CO2 gas, and the salt would be the corresponding acid's salt. If the salt is insoluble, it would precipitate. For example, if X is CaCO3 and Y is HCl, the reaction would produce CaCl2, H2O, and CO2. But CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. Unless Y is something else.

Wait, maybe Y is not an acid. Maybe Y is a solution of a salt that reacts with X to produce a precipitate. For example, Y could be a solution of NaOH, and X is a metal nitrate. Then, the reaction could produce a precipitate of the metal hydroxide. But then, what gas would be released? If X is aluminum nitrate and Y is NaOH, the reaction produces Al(OH)3 precipitate and NaNO3. But no gas is released, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution containing sulfide ions. If X is a metal, then the reaction could produce H2S gas. But H2S has 2 protons and 32 neutrons (each S has 16 neutrons, 2 H have 1 each). So 2 protons, 34 neutrons? Doesn't match. So W wouldn't fit.

Wait, going back to the W idea. If W is CO2, then the reaction must produce CO2. So X and Y reacting to produce CO2. Let's think about what produces CO2 upon reaction. Possible reactions are decomposition of carbonates, bicarbonates, or reactions where carbonate reacts with an acid.

So if X is a carbonate, Y is an acid, then W is CO2. Then, the precipitate G would be the corresponding acid's salt. For example, if X is CaCO3 and Y is HCl, then the products are CaCl2 (which is soluble, so no precipitate). Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps G is a different product. Maybe X is a sulfide, and Y is an acid, producing H2S gas. But earlier that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps X is a hydroxide, and Y is an acid—no, that would produce water and a salt, but no gas.

Wait, another angle: What if X is a metal and Y is a strong base, like NaOH? Then, perhaps the reaction releases H2 gas. But as before, H2 doesn't fit W's condition.

Wait, maybe Y is a carbonate, and X is a metal. No, that doesn't seem to fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal with a heavy isotope, and Y is a solution that reacts with it to produce H2 gas. But again, H2 doesn't fit.

Wait, let me think about B. B is released when G is heated, and its melting point is about 277 K. 277 K is 4°C. What has a melting point around there? Maybe something like water, but water freezes at 273 K (0°C). Alternatively, perhaps it's a different substance. Wait, another thought: maybe B is a solid form of CO2, but that doesn't make sense since dry ice (solid CO2) sublimates at -78°C. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a metal. Wait, not sure. Another approach: maybe G is a carbonate, and upon heating, it decomposes into something else, releasing B. For example, if G is a carbonate, heating it could release CO2 and form a metal oxide. But earlier, that didn't seem to fit.

Wait, maybe G is a hydroxide. If G is a metal hydroxide, heating it might produce a metal oxide and release water. But water is a liquid, not a gas. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps G is a sulfate, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the last clue: the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. Let's think about that. If X is a metal, say sodium, and the keto acid is acetic acid, then the reaction would produce sodium acetate. Sodium acetate has the formula CH3COO-Na+. The acetate ion (CH3COO-) has two oxygen atoms. So the product would have two O's. That fits the clue. So if X is sodium, then reacting with a keto acid would give a product with two O's.

So maybe X is sodium metal. But sodium reacts violently with water, producing H2 gas. Earlier, H2 doesn't fit W's condition of equal protons and neutrons. So that might not be right.

Wait, another possibility: X is magnesium. Mg reacts with water (especially under certain conditions) to produce H2 gas. Again, W would be H2, which doesn't fit the condition.

Hmm, perhaps I'm on the wrong track. Let me think about other possibilities for X.

Wait, another thought: X could be a heavy isotope-containing compound. For example, chlorine has a heavy isotope, Cl-37. If X is something like CHCl3 (chloroform), but I'm not sure how that fits. Alternatively, perhaps X is a halogen, like Cl2, but then reacting with Y would produce what?

Alternatively, maybe X is something like NaOH, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the clue about the product: a certain keto acid reacts with X to form a product with 2 O atoms. If X is NaOH, then reacting with a keto acid (like acetic acid) would produce sodium acetate, which has two O's in the acetate ion. That fits. So perhaps X is NaOH, but that's a base, not a metal. Hmm.

Wait, but earlier I thought that when X reacts with Y, a precipitate forms. If X is NaOH and Y is a salt, like a nitrate, perhaps the reaction would produce a precipitate. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: perhaps Substance X is a carbonate, as earlier thought. Let's say X is Na2CO3. Reacting with Y (maybe HCl) would produce CO2 gas, NaCl, and H2O. So W is CO2, which fits the condition of equal protons and neutrons. Then, the precipitate G would be NaCl, which is soluble. Wait, that wouldn't precipitate. Hmm, maybe I'm off.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of BaCl2, and X is Na2SO4. Then the reaction would produce BaSO4 precipitate and NaCl. But then W would be nothing, which doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the heavy isotope. X incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its elements. So, for example, if X is a compound containing Cl, which has a heavy isotope (Cl-35 or 37), that could be possible.

Wait, another approach: the product of X with a keto acid has 2 O's. Let's think of the keto acid as something like acetic acid, CH3COOH. When it reacts with a base like NaOH, it forms sodium acetate, which has two O's in the acetate ion. So the product has two O's. So X could be NaOH. But then, X (NaOH) reacting with Y (maybe something else) would produce what?

If X is NaOH, what would Y be that reacts violently? Maybe Y is a strong acid, like H2SO4. Then the reaction would produce water and Na2SO4. But no gas would be released, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, Y could be a metal carbonate. If X is NaOH and Y is CO2, then no reaction would occur. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal, and when it reacts with a solution of a carbonate (Y), it displaces the metal, producing CO2 gas. For example, if X is Mg and Y is Na2CO3. The reaction would produce MgCO3 (which might precipitate), CO2 gas, and NaOH. Wait, but MgCO3 is not very soluble, so it would precipitate. Then, when the precipitate is heated, it might decompose into MgO and CO2. But that's just a guess.

But then, the product of X (Mg) reacting with a keto acid (like CH3COOH) would be Mg acetate, which contains Mg(CH3COO)2. Each acetate has two O's, but the entire molecule has more O's. Wait, but the question says the product contains 2 atoms of oxygen. So perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, maybe X is a metal with a heavy isotope, like potassium (K has a heavy isotope). So X is K. Reacting K with an acid (like H2O) would produce H2 gas. But as before, H2 doesn't fit W's condition.

Wait, let me think again about Gas W. If W has the same number of protons and neutrons, perhaps it's CO2 as I thought earlier. Then, what produces CO2? A reaction between a carbonate and an acid. So X could be a carbonate, Y an acid. Then, W is CO2, which fits.

So, when X (a carbonate) reacts with Y (an acid), it produces CO2, H2O, and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, it precipitates as G. Then, when G is heated, perhaps it decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. But then B would be the metal oxide. But earlier, B's melting point is about 277 K, which is about 4°C. So a metal oxide that melts at 4°C? Unlikely, as most metal oxides have much higher melting points.

Wait, perhaps B is something else. If G is a carbonate, heating it could decompose into CO2 and the corresponding metal oxide. But then, B would be the metal oxide. But if the metal oxide is something like Na2O, which has a high melting point, that doesn't fit. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe G is a hydroxide, and upon heating, it loses water to form an oxide. For example, heating Mg(OH)2 would produce MgO and water vapor. But I'm not sure how that connects to B's melting point.

Wait, another idea: perhaps B is a solid with a low melting point. For example, something like ice. But ice's melting point is 273 K, which is 0°C. The problem says 277 K, which is 4°C. Close but not exact. Maybe B is another compound that's solid at 4°C.

Alternatively, perhaps B is a different form of carbon, like graphite or diamond, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think about the other clues again.

Substance X and its analog are used as reagents in organic chemistry. So, perhaps X is a Grignard reagent? Grignard reagents are organometallic compounds, like MgBrCH2CH3. They are used in reactions with carbonyl compounds. But then, what would X be in this context?

Wait, Grignard reagents react with ketones to form secondary alcohols. But in this case, the product would have oxygen. But the clue says the product has 2 atoms of oxygen. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4), which is a strong reducing agent. But I'm not sure how that fits.

Wait, another thought: if X is a heavy isotope-containing compound, like Cl-37 in chloroform (CHCl3), but I'm not sure how that fits the reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a transition metal with a heavy isotope. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let's try to summarize:

- Gas W has equal protons and neutrons per molecule. CO2 fits this, as each molecule has 22 protons and 22 neutrons.

- X reacts with Y to produce W (CO2), a precipitate G, and releases heat.

So, X is a carbonate, Y is an acid. Let's say X is Na2CO3, Y is HCl.

Reaction: Na2CO3 + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + H2O + CO2↑.

The precipitate would form if NaCl is insoluble, but NaCl is highly soluble, so no precipitate. So that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a different acid. Or X is a different carbonate.

Wait, perhaps X is CaCO3 and Y is HCl. Then, reaction produces CaCl2, H2O, and CO2. CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe Y is not an acid but something else. Let's think about other possibilities.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a salt that reacts with X to form a precipitate and release CO2. For example, if X is Na2CO3 and Y is Ba(NO3)2. The reaction would produce BaCO3 precipitate and NaNO3. BaCO3 is insoluble, so it would precipitate. And no gas is released, so that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution containing AgNO3. Then, X (Na2CO3) would react to form Ag2CO3, which is not very soluble. But again, no gas is released.

Wait, maybe Y is a solution of H2SO4. Then, reacting with Na2CO3 would produce CO2, H2O, and Na2SO4. Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate. Hmm.

Another approach: perhaps the precipitate G is a carbonate, and when heated, it decomposes into a metal oxide and CO2. So, when G is heated, it releases CO2 (B?), but that would mean B is CO2. But earlier, B's melting point is 277 K, which is about 4°C, which is higher than CO2's melting point (which is way lower). So perhaps that's not right.

Wait, maybe B is the metal oxide. For example, if G is a metal carbonate, heating it decomposes into metal oxide and CO2. The metal oxide (B) would have a melting point around 277 K. Hmm, but most metal oxides have much higher melting points. For example, Na2O has a melting point around 1380°C, which is way higher than 277 K. So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps B is the oxide of a metal with a low melting point. Which metals have oxides that melt around 4°C? Hmm, not sure. Maybe something like HgO? No, HgO's melting point is around 1600°C. Hmm.

Wait, maybe B is not a metal oxide but another compound. Maybe something organic. For example, if G is a carbonate of a metal that, when heated, releases CO2 and leaves a residue of the metal, but that doesn't make sense.

I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about the possible answers. The options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

Wait, the question asks for the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X. So, if X is composed of two elements, say A and B, with A being lighter and B heavier, then I need to find their atomic masses and add them.

For example, if X is NaCl, the elements are Na and Cl. Na has atomic mass ~23, Cl ~35.5. So sum is 58.5. But none of the options are close to 58.5. So perhaps X has elements with lower masses.

Wait, if X is something like CH3Cl (chloroform), then elements are C, H, Cl. The lightest would be H (1), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5. The options include 35 (option A) and 31 (option C). Hmm, maybe X is something else.

Wait, if X is NaOH. Na (23), O (16), H (1). Lightest is H (1), heaviest Na (23). Sum is 24. Not an option.

Wait, another thought: if X is a diatomic molecule. For example, if X is O2, but that doesn't have a heavy isotope incorporated. Or X is Cl2, which has Cl-35 and Cl-37. So, Cl has a heavy isotope. So if X is Cl2, the lightest element is Cl (35) and the heaviest is Cl (37). So sum is 35 +37=72. Not an option.

Wait, maybe X is a compound with two elements, one light and one heavy. For example, if X is CHCl3 (chloroform), the elements are C (12), H (1), Cl (35.5). Lightest is H (1), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5. Closest option is A)35.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like CCl4. Then, elements are C (12) and Cl (35.5). Sum is 12 +35.5 =47.5. Not an option.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal with a heavy isotope, like potassium (K). K's common isotope is K-39, but it also has K-41. So if X is K, then the lightest isotope is K-39 (39), the heaviest K-41 (41). Sum is 39+41=80. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a compound with elements that have the lightest and heaviest isotopes. For example, if X is HCl, which has H (1) and Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5. Again, close to option A (35).

Wait, but the question says "the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So if X is HCl, the lightest element is H (1), heaviest Cl (35.5). Sum is 36.5.

But none of the options are 36.5. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, another angle: maybe X is a compound containing two elements, one with the lightest atomic mass and one with the heaviest. For example, if X is something like LiCl. Li has atomic mass ~7, Cl ~35.5. Sum is 42.5. Still not matching options.

Wait, maybe X contains elements with lower masses. For example, if X is NaCl, sum is 23+35.5=58.5. Not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the answer options again.

Options are 35, 25, 31, 29.

If the sum is 29, possible combinations could be 1 +28 (unlikely, as 28 is silicon), or 15 +14 (but that's nitrogen and carbon). Alternatively, 12 +17 (carbon and chlorine, sum 29). So, 29 would be C + F? Wait, no, F is 19. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, 29 is option D. So if the lightest is 12 (C) and the heaviest is 17 (Cl?), but Cl is 35.5. So that doesn't add up.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the elements in X are not two but more, but the question says "lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X". So, take the lightest and heaviest elements in X, sum their atomic masses.

Wait, another possibility: if X is a diatomic molecule like O2, but that doesn't have a heavy isotope incorporated. Alternatively, maybe X is a heavier element with a heavy isotope, like I (Iodine), but I's atomic mass is around 127.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound with elements like H and something else. For example, if X is H2O, but that doesn't have a heavy isotope incorporated. Wait, but if X is H2O where one H is deuterium (heavy isotope), then the elements are H and O. So sum is 1 +16=17. Not an option.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the cumulative atomic masses are of the lightest and heaviest isotopes present in X. For example, if X is Cl2, the lightest isotope is Cl-35 (35) and heaviest is Cl-37 (37). Sum is 72. But that's not an option. Alternatively, if X is something like CHCl3, the isotopes could be Cl-35 and Cl-37. But the question says "the lightest and heaviest elements present within Substance X", which refers to the elements, not isotopes.

Wait, perhaps the elements are C and Cl in CHCl3. So C (12) and Cl (35.5). Sum is 47.5, not an option.

Alternatively, if X is something like NaCl, the elements are Na (23) and Cl (35.5). Sum is 58.5. Not an option.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the answer options again. The options are 35,25,31,29.

If the sum is 35, perhaps the lightest element is O (16) and the heaviest is F (19). 16+19=35. But I don't see how that fits.

Wait, another possibility: maybe X is a compound containing two elements, one of which is hydrogen (1) and the other is something else. For example, if X is CH4, then elements are C (12) and H (1). Sum is 13. Not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps X is something like NH3. Elements are N (14) and H (1). Sum is 15. Not an option.

Wait, perhaps X is a compound containing the lightest element (H) and another element with atomic mass 34 (like Se, but that's 79). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the sum is 35. So, 35 could be the sum of 16 (O) and 19 (F), but that's 35. Alternatively, 12 (C) + 23 (Na) = 35. So if X is a compound containing C and Na, the sum would be 35. But what would X be then?

If X is something like Na2CO3, the elements are Na, C, O. The lightest is C (12) and heaviest Na (23). Sum is 12+23=35, which is option A.

Wait, that fits! So if X is sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), then the lightest element is C (12) and the heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 35, which is option A.

Does this fit with the other clues?

Let me check:

- X is Na2CO3, which reacts with an acid (Y) like HCl. The reaction produces CO2 gas (W), which has 22 protons and 22 neutrons, fitting the condition.

- The precipitate G would be NaCl, but NaCl is soluble. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps Y is a different acid. Or perhaps X is a different carbonate. Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution containing something else.

Wait, perhaps X is a different carbonate, like CaCO3. Then, when it reacts with HCl, it produces CO2, H2O, and CaCl2. CaCl2 is soluble, so no precipitate. That doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe Y is not an acid. Another possibility: Y is a solution of AgNO3, and X is Na2CO3. The reaction produces Ag2CO3 precipitate and NaNO3. But NaNO3 is soluble, so precipitate is Ag2CO3. Then, when Ag2CO3 is heated, it decomposes into 2Ag + CO2. So B would be Ag. But the melting point of Ag is about 961°C, which is way higher than 277 K (4°C). So that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps G is NaCl, which when heated doesn't change. So B would be NaCl, which has a melting point of about 801°C, which is way higher than 277 K.

So that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about X being Na2CO3. Maybe X is something else.

Another thought: if X is NaOH, and Y is something else. For example, Y could be a solution of Al(NO3)3. Then, X (NaOH) reacts with Al(NO3)3 to produce Al(OH)3 precipitate and NaNO3. So W would be nothing, which doesn't fit.

Hmm. Maybe X is a metal and Y is an acid. Let's say X is Mg and Y is H2SO4. The reaction produces MgSO4, H2O, and H2 gas. But H2 doesn't fit W's condition.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a metal with a heavy isotope, like potassium (K). K reacts with water to produce H2 gas, but again, H2 doesn't fit.

Wait, another angle: perhaps W is not CO2 but another gas. Let me think of other possibilities.

If W has equal protons and neutrons per molecule, maybe it's O2. O2 has 8 protons and 8 neutrons each atom, so 16 protons and 16 neutrons for O2. That fits. So W could be O2.

Then, what reaction produces O2 gas? Decomposition of a peroxide, like H2O2 → 2H2O + O2. So if X is H2O2, and Y is a catalyst, then O2 is released. But the question says X reacts with Y, which is a liquid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a peroxide, like Na2O2, and Y is water. The reaction would produce O2. So:

2 Na2O2 + 2 H2O → 4 NaOH + O2↑.

So W is O2, which fits the condition.

Then, the precipitate G would be NaOH, which is soluble. Hmm, that's not a precipitate. So perhaps that's not right.

Alternatively, if X is a carbonate and Y is something else. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps X is a metal peroxide, like K2O2. Reacting with Y (maybe water) to produce O2 and KOH. But KOH is soluble, so no precipitate.

Hmm, not helpful.

Another approach: perhaps W is N2 gas. But N2 has 7 protons and 7 neutrons each atom. So N2 would have 14 protons and 14 neutrons. That fits the condition. But what reaction produces N2 gas?

Hmm, not sure. Decomposition of nitrates? Not likely.

Alternatively, perhaps W is Ne gas, but Ne has 10 protons and 10 neutrons (Ne-20). So that fits. But what reaction produces Ne? Unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck because I'm not considering all possibilities. Let me try to think differently.

If W is CO2, then X is a carbonate. So when X reacts with Y (an acid), CO2 is released. The precipitate G would form if the salt produced is insoluble. For example, if X is CaCO3 and Y is HNO3, the reaction would produce Ca(NO3)2, H2O, and CO2. Ca(NO3)2 is soluble, so no precipitate. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps Y is a solution of a nitrate, and X is a carbonate of a metal that forms an insoluble nitrate. That's possible only if the nitrate is insoluble. But most nitrates are soluble. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a solution of a sulfide. Then, X (a carbonate) reacting with Y would produce a sulfide, carbonate, and perhaps CO2. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the precipitate G comes from another reaction. For example, X is Na2CO3, Y is AgNO3. Reaction produces Ag2CO3 (insoluble) and NaNO3. So W would be nothing, which doesn't fit. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, if X is Na2CO3 and Y is H2SO4, the reaction produces Na2SO4, H2O, and CO2. Na2SO4 is soluble, so no precipitate.

Hmm, I'm going in circles here. Let me try to think about the other clue: the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 atoms of oxygen.

If X is NaOH, and the keto acid is, say, acetic acid, the product is sodium acetate (CH3COONa), which has two oxygen atoms in the acetate ion. That fits. So X could be NaOH.

But then, what is Y? If X is NaOH and Y is something else, perhaps a carbonate. Let's say Y is CO2. Then, NaOH + CO2 → Na2CO3 + H2O. No gas is released, so W isn't produced. Doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is an acid. Like HCl. Then, X (NaOH) would react with HCl to produce NaCl and H2O. No gas is released, which doesn't fit.

Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: X is a metal carbonate, and Y is an acid. The reaction produces CO2, and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, it precipitates. So, for example, X is PbCO3, Y is HCl. Reaction: PbCO3 + 2 HCl → PbCl2 + CO2↑ + H2O. PbCl2 is slightly soluble, so it might precipitate. Then, W is CO2, which fits.

When G (PbCl2) is heated, perhaps it decomposes. Heating PbCl2 produces PbO, HCl gas, and maybe other products. But I'm not sure about the melting point of B. Alternatively, perhaps B is something else.

Wait, perhaps when G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point of 277 K. So B is solid at 277 K. But earlier, I thought 277 K is about 4°C. So B would be a solid at that temperature.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let me try to proceed with the assumption that X is Na2CO3, even though it doesn't fit the precipitate part.

If X is Na2CO3, then the lightest element is C (12), heaviest is Na (23). Sum is 35, which is option A.

So the answer would be A)35.


The problem involves identifying Substance X, which incorporates a heavier isotope of one of its constituent elements, and analyzing its reaction with Liquid Y. The reaction produces Gas W, a precipitate G, and releases heat. Gas W has the same number of protons and neutrons in its molecule. When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point of approximately 277 K (4°C). Additionally, the product of the reaction of a certain keto acid with X contains 2 oxygen atoms. The goal is to determine the cumulative atomic masses of the lightest and heaviest elements in X.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gas W**: The molecule of W has equal numbers of protons and neutrons. CO₂ fits this condition, as it has 22 protons and 22 neutrons in total. This suggests that W is likely CO₂, which is produced when a carbonate reacts with an acid.

2. **Substance X**: Since W is CO₂, X is likely a carbonate. When X reacts with an acid (Y), it produces CO₂ gas, water, and a salt. If the salt is insoluble, it forms a precipitate G. For example, if X is sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) and Y is an acid like HCl, the reaction produces CO₂, H₂O, and NaCl. However, NaCl is soluble, so this does not fit the precipitate condition. Other carbonates like CaCO₃ also do not produce insoluble salts in such reactions.

3. **Precipitate G and Heating**: When G is heated, it releases B, which has a melting point of 277 K (4°C). If G is a carbonate, heating it could decompose into a metal oxide and CO₂. However, most metal oxides have much higher melting points, making this unlikely. The exact identity of G and B remains unclear, but the focus shifts to identifying X based on other clues.

4. **Reaction with Keto Acid**: The product of X reacting with a keto acid contains 2 oxygen atoms. For example, if X is sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and the keto acid is acetic acid (CH₃COOH), the product is sodium acetate (CH₃COONa), which contains 2 oxygen atoms in the acetate ion. This suggests X could be NaOH.

5. **Atomic Masses of Elements in X**: If X is NaOH, the elements are Na (23) and O (16). The lightest element is H (1), and the heaviest is Na (23). The cumulative atomic masses are 1 + 23 = 24, which does not match the options. However, if X is sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃), the elements are Na (23), C (12), and O (16). The lightest element is C (12), and the heaviest is Na (23). The cumulative atomic masses are 12 + 23 = 35, which matches option A.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the most plausible identity for X is sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃). The cumulative atomic masses of the lightest (C) and heaviest (Na) elements in X are 12 and 23, respectively, giving a total of 35.
