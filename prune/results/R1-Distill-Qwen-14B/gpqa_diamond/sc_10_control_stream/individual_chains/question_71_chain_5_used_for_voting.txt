Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about exoplanets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. Right, the formula I think is T = [(L/(16πσd²))^0.25] * ( (1 - A)^0.5 )^0.5, where A is the albedo. Wait, or was it a different formula? Oh wait, maybe T is proportional to (L/(d²))^0.25 multiplied by ( (1 - A) )^0.5 all to the 0.5? Wait, no, let me think again. Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature (assuming it's a blackbody) is T = [ ( L (1 - A) ) / (16 π σ d²) ]^(1/4). So that's the formula.

But in this problem, they say all the planets have the same albedo, so A is the same for all. So the ratio of their temperatures depends only on their distances from the star. Because when you take the ratio, the (1 - A) and all the other constants (like L, sigma, pi) will cancel out.

So the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures will be the same as the ratio of their distance factors raised to the 1/4 power. Wait, because if T is proportional to (1/d²)^(1/4), which is same as (1/d^(2))^(1/4) = 1/d^(0.5). So T is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance.

Wait, let me break it down. If T ∝ ( L (1 - A) )^(1/4) / d^(1/2). Since L is the same for all planets (assuming same star), and (1 - A) is the same, the ratio T4 / T2 would be sqrt( d2 / d4 ). Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(d), so T4 = T2 * sqrt(d2/d4). So the ratio T4/T2 = sqrt( d2/d4 ). Hmm, wait, let's double-check.

Wait, T is proportional to (1/d^2 )^(1/4) → which is d^(-0.5). So T ∝ 1 / sqrt(d). So T = k / sqrt(d), where k is a constant. So T4 / T2 = sqrt(d2 / d4). Because T4 = k / sqrt(d4), and T2 = k / sqrt(d2). So ratio is (k/sqrt(d4)) / (k/sqrt(d2)) ) = sqrt(d2) / sqrt(d4) = sqrt( d2/d4 ).

Wait, that's the same as sqrt( (d2)/(d4) ). So yes, the ratio is sqrt( d2 / d4 ).

But wait, the planets are in orbital resonance with periods in a ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So the periods are P1=1, P2=2, P3=2.5, P4=3.5, P5=5. Since the orbits are circular and following Kepler's third law, we can relate the periods to the distances.

Kepler's third law says P² ∝ a³, where a is the semi-major axis (distance from star). So a ∝ P^(2/3). So the distance of each planet is proportional to P^(2/3).

So to find the distances, I can calculate for each planet:

d1 ∝ (1)^(2/3) → 1

d2 ∝ (2)^(2/3) → 2^(2/3)

d3 ∝ (2.5)^(2/3)

d4 ∝ (3.5)^(2/3)

d5 ∝ (5)^(2/3)

But since we're looking for the ratio of d2 and d4, let's compute d2 and d4 in terms of d1.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to express each distance as a multiple of d1. So d2 = (P2/P1)^(2/3) * d1 → (2/1)^(2/3) * d1.

Similarly, d4 = (3.5/1)^(2/3) * d1 → (3.5)^(2/3) * d1.

So the ratio T4/T2 is sqrt( d2 / d4 ) → sqrt( (2^(2/3) ) / (3.5^(2/3)) ) )

Wait, let's compute that. Let me simplify the fraction inside the sqrt.

(2^(2/3)) / (3.5^(2/3)) = (2/3.5)^(2/3) ) → since (a^b)/(c^b) = (a/c)^b.

So, 2/3.5 is the same as 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So (4/7)^(2/3) → let me compute that.

Wait, 4 is 2², 7 is prime. So (4/7) = (2²)/(7^1) → (2/7^(0.5))^2.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute exponents numerically.

Let me compute 4/7 = approx 0.5714.

Taking (0.5714)^(2/3) → So first, take the cube root of 0.5714, and then square it.

Cube root of 0.5714: Let's see. 0.5714 is about 0.57. The cube root of 0.57 is approximately 0.384 (since 0.384^3 ≈ 0.384 * 0.384=0.147, 0.147 *0.384 ≈ 0.0565. Hmm, wait that's not right. Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, 0.384^3 = (approx 0.38^3). 0.38^3 = 0.38 * 0.38 = 0.1444; then 0.1444 * 0.38 ≈ 0.0549. Hmm, that's about 0.055. But 0.57 is larger than that, so perhaps I need a higher cube root.

Wait, maybe I should think of cube roots of numbers around 0.5~0.6.

Wait, 0.8^3 is 0.512, which is close to 0.57. Wait, 0.8^3 = 0.512. So 0.57 is a bit higher than that. Let's see, 0.82^3 is (0.8^3) + (0.02)^3 + 3*(0.8)^2*(0.02) + 3*(0.8)*(0.02)^2.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find x where x^3 =0.57.

We know that 0.8^3=0.512, 0.82^3= (0.8*0.8*0.8) + 3*(0.8^2)*(0.02) + 3*(0.8)*(0.02)^2 + (0.02)^3.

Wait, maybe this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use logarithms or approximate it.

But perhaps I should consider that (0.5714)^(1/3) is approximately 0.828, since 0.828^3 is approx 0.828 *0.828 = 0.685, then 0.685 * 0.828 ≈ 0.568, which is near 0.57. So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.828. So then, (0.5714)^(2/3) = (cube root)^2 → (0.828)^2 ≈ 0.685.

So sqrt( d2 / d4 ) is sqrt( (2^(2/3) ) / (3.5^(2/3)) ) = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3) → which is cube root of 4/7, which is approximately 0.828 as above. Wait, but wait: sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) is same as (4/7)^(1/3), because sqrt is exponent 1/2, so (x^(2/3))^(1/2) = x^(1/3). Yes, so that's correct.

So the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.828. Let me check the options. The options are A: ~0.57, B: ~0.69, C: ~0.83, D: ~0.75.

0.828 is approximately 0.83, which is option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I get the ratio right? Because the formula was T4/T2 = sqrt( d2 / d4 ), but wait, I think I might have confused the ratio.

Let me clarify: the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance. So T ∝ 1/sqrt(d). So T4 = k / sqrt(d4), T2 = k / sqrt(d2). Therefore, T4/T2 = sqrt(d2)/sqrt(d4) = sqrt( d2/d4 ).

Wait, yes, that's correct. So that's where the ratio comes from.

But let me recheck the exponents. So d is proportional to P^(2/3).

So d2 is proportional to (2)^(2/3), and d4 is proportional to (3.5)^(2/3).

So d2/d4 = (2/3.5)^(2/3) → (4/7)^(2/3) → which is 0.5714^(0.666...) as above.

So when I take the square root (since it's sqrt(d2/d4)), that's the cube root of 0.5714, which is about 0.828. So T4/T2 is approximately 0.828, which is about 0.83, so option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because the question is about the ratio of Planet_4 and Planet_2, so it's T4/T2. So in the options, what's the option C? It's ~0.83.

So the answer should be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}
\]

where \(d\) is the distance of the planet from the star. Since the planets are in orbital resonance, their orbital periods are in the ratio \(1:2:2.5:3.5:5\). According to Kepler's third law, the distance \(d\) is proportional to \(P^{2/3}\), where \(P\) is the orbital period. Thus, the distances of Planet_2 and Planet_4 are proportional to:

\[
d_2 \propto 2^{2/3}, \quad d_4 \propto 3.5^{2/3}
\]

The ratio of their distances is:

\[
\frac{d_2}{d_4} = \frac{2^{2/3}}{3.5^{2/3}} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}
\]

Taking the square root of this ratio gives:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{d_2}{d_4}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Approximating \(\frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714\), the cube root of \(0.5714\) is approximately \(0.828\). Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately \(0.83\).

Comparing this result with the given options:

- A) ~0.57  
- B) ~0.69  
- C) ~0.83  
- D) ~0.75  

The closest match is **C) ~0.83**.

Wait, let me break it down. If T ∝ ( L (1 - A) )^(1/4) / d^(1/2). Since L is the same for all planets (assuming same star), and (1 - A) is the same, the ratio T4 / T2 would be sqrt( d2 / d4 ). Because T is inversely proportional to sqrt(d), so T4 = T2 * sqrt(d2/d4). So the ratio T4/T2 = sqrt( d2/d4 ). Hmm, wait, let's double-check.

Wait, T is proportional to (1/d^2 )^(1/4) → which is d^(-0.5). So T ∝ 1 / sqrt(d). So T = k / sqrt(d), where k is a constant. So T4 / T2 = sqrt(d2 / d4). Because T4 = k / sqrt(d4), and T2 = k / sqrt(d2). So ratio is (k/sqrt(d4)) / (k/sqrt(d2)) ) = sqrt(d2) / sqrt(d4) = sqrt( d2/d4 ).

Wait, that's the same as sqrt( (d2)/(d4) ). So yes, the ratio is sqrt( d2 / d4 ).

But wait, the planets are in orbital resonance with periods in a ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So the periods are P1=1, P2=2, P3=2.5, P4=3.5, P5=5. Since the orbits are circular and following Kepler's third law, we can relate the periods to the distances.

d5 ∝ (5)^(2/3)

But since we're looking for the ratio of d2 and d4, let's compute d2 and d4 in terms of d1.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to express each distance as a multiple of d1. So d2 = (P2/P1)^(2/3) * d1 → (2/1)^(2/3) * d1.

Similarly, d4 = (3.5/1)^(2/3) * d1 → (3.5)^(2/3) * d1.

So the ratio T4/T2 is sqrt( d2 / d4 ) → sqrt( (2^(2/3) ) / (3.5^(2/3)) ) )

Wait, let's compute that. Let me simplify the fraction inside the sqrt.

(2^(2/3)) / (3.5^(2/3)) = (2/3.5)^(2/3) ) → since (a^b)/(c^b) = (a/c)^b.

So, 2/3.5 is the same as 4/7 ≈ 0.5714.

So (4/7)^(2/3) → let me compute that.

Wait, 4 is 2², 7 is prime. So (4/7) = (2²)/(7^1) → (2/7^(0.5))^2.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute exponents numerically.

Let me compute 4/7 = approx 0.5714.

Taking (0.5714)^(2/3) → So first, take the cube root of 0.5714, and then square it.

Cube root of 0.5714: Let's see. 0.5714 is about 0.57. The cube root of 0.57 is approximately 0.384 (since 0.384^3 ≈ 0.384 * 0.384=0.147, 0.147 *0.384 ≈ 0.0565. Hmm, wait that's not right. Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, 0.384^3 = (approx 0.38^3). 0.38^3 = 0.38 * 0.38 = 0.1444; then 0.1444 * 0.38 ≈ 0.0549. Hmm, that's about 0.055. But 0.57 is larger than that, so perhaps I need a higher cube root.

Wait, maybe I should think of cube roots of numbers around 0.5~0.6.

Wait, 0.8^3 is 0.512, which is close to 0.57. Wait, 0.8^3 = 0.512. So 0.57 is a bit higher than that. Let's see, 0.82^3 is (0.8^3) + (0.02)^3 + 3*(0.8)^2*(0.02) + 3*(0.8)*(0.02)^2.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find x where x^3 =0.57.

We know that 0.8^3=0.512, 0.82^3= (0.8*0.8*0.8) + 3*(0.8^2)*(0.02) + 3*(0.8)*(0.02)^2 + (0.02)^3.

Wait, maybe this is getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use logarithms or approximate it.

But perhaps I should consider that (0.5714)^(1/3) is approximately 0.828, since 0.828^3 is approx 0.828 *0.828 = 0.685, then 0.685 * 0.828 ≈ 0.568, which is near 0.57. So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.828. So then, (0.5714)^(2/3) = (cube root)^2 → (0.828)^2 ≈ 0.685.

So sqrt( d2 / d4 ) is sqrt( (2^(2/3) ) / (3.5^(2/3)) ) = sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) = (4/7)^(1/3) → which is cube root of 4/7, which is approximately 0.828 as above. Wait, but wait: sqrt( (4/7)^(2/3) ) is same as (4/7)^(1/3), because sqrt is exponent 1/2, so (x^(2/3))^(1/2) = x^(1/3). Yes, so that's correct.

So the ratio T4/T2 is approximately 0.828. Let me check the options. The options are A: ~0.57, B: ~0.69, C: ~0.83, D: ~0.75.

0.828 is approximately 0.83, which is option C.

Wait, yes, that's correct. So that's where the ratio comes from.

But let me recheck the exponents. So d is proportional to P^(2/3).

So d2 is proportional to (2)^(2/3), and d4 is proportional to (3.5)^(2/3).

So d2/d4 = (2/3.5)^(2/3) → (4/7)^(2/3) → which is 0.5714^(0.666...) as above.

So when I take the square root (since it's sqrt(d2/d4)), that's the cube root of 0.5714, which is about 0.828. So T4/T2 is approximately 0.828, which is about 0.83, so option C.

Wait, but wait another thing. Because the question is about the ratio of Planet_4 and Planet_2, so it's T4/T2. So in the options, what's the option C? It's ~0.83.

So the answer should be option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the formula for equilibrium temperature:

\[
T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}
\]

where \(d\) is the distance of the planet from the star. Since the planets are in orbital resonance, their orbital periods are in the ratio \(1:2:2.5:3.5:5\). According to Kepler's third law, the distance \(d\) is proportional to \(P^{2/3}\), where \(P\) is the orbital period. Thus, the distances of Planet_2 and Planet_4 are proportional to:

\[
d_2 \propto 2^{2/3}, \quad d_4 \propto 3.5^{2/3}
\]

The ratio of their distances is:

\[
\frac{d_2}{d_4} = \frac{2^{2/3}}{3.5^{2/3}} = \left(\frac{2}{3.5}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}
\]

Taking the square root of this ratio gives:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{d_2}{d_4}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{2/3}} = \left(\frac{4}{7}\right)^{1/3}
\]

Approximating \(\frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714\), the cube root of \(0.5714\) is approximately \(0.828\). Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures is approximately \(0.83\).

Comparing this result with the given options:

- A) ~0.57  
- B) ~0.69

- D) ~0.75  

The closest match is **C) ~0.83**.
