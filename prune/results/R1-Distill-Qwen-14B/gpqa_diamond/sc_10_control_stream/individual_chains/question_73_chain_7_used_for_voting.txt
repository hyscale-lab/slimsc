Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to tackle this step by step.

The question says there are two astronauts with masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. The problem asks for the relative speed between them and the total energy of the system. The options are A to D, each with a different relative speed and energy.

Wait, so relative speed in relativity isn't just subtracting the two speeds like in classical mechanics, right? Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just do a simple subtraction. I remember the formula for adding velocities relativistically. Oh yes, the velocity addition formula.

The formula is v = (u + v') / (1 + (u v')/c² ), where u and v' are the speeds. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in this case, we have two objects, each moving in the same direction. So to find the relative speed of the second from the first's perspective, it's like finding the speed of the second astronaut in the first's frame.

Wait, no, actually, the first astronaut is moving at 0.6c in our lab frame. The second is moving at 0.5c in the same direction. So from the first astronaut's frame, the second would appear to be moving at a different speed.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. Let's say the first astronaut is A, moving at u = 0.6c in the lab frame. The second astronaut B is moving at v = 0.5c in the same direction.

In A's frame, the speed of B would be (v - u) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)). Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, the formula for relative velocity when both are moving in the same direction. Let me get this straight.

The correct formula when you have two objects moving in the same direction in the lab frame, and you want to find the relative speed from one's perspective. So if A is moving at u and B is moving at v (both same direction), then in A's frame, B's speed is (v - u) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait a second. I think I might have it backwards. Let me think: When you have two objects moving in the same direction, the relative speed is (v - u) / (1 - (u v)/(c²)). Because in A's frame, B's velocity is calculated using the velocity addition formula. So yeah, that seems right.

So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. Wait, but 0.5c is less than 0.6c, so v is behind u in the lab frame? Wait, no, because both are moving in the positive x-direction. So in the lab frame, astronaut A is moving at 0.6c, and astronaut B is moving at 0.5c. So from A's perspective, B is moving backward? No, wait, no, because both are moving in the same direction, but B is slower. So from A's perspective, B is moving backward relative to A? Or forward? Hmm.

Wait, the formula applies regardless. Let me plug the numbers. So u is 0.6c, v is 0.5c. So v - u is 0.5c - 0.6c = -0.1c. Then the denominator is 1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/c² = 1 - (0.3c²)/c² = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7.

So the relative velocity would be (-0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates that B is moving in the opposite direction relative to A, meaning from A's perspective, B is moving backward. But the question just asks for the relative speed, so the magnitude is 0.142857c, approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now, moving on to the total energy. The total energy of the system would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut.

The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² ≈ 5.964 m c². Let's say approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc². So the correct total energy would match option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Yes, for astronaut A: 0.6c, so v²/c²=0.36. 1 - 0.36=0.64, sqrt is 0.8, reciprocal is 1.25. So E1=2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 mc².

Astronaut B: v=0.5c. v²/c²=0.25. 1 - 0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866. So 1/gamma is 0.866, so gamma is 1/0.866≈1.1547.

So E2=3m * 1.1547 c² ≈3.464 m c².

Adding 2.5 and 3.464 gives 5.964, which is about 5.96. So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc², and relative speed 0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², same speed.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system using relativistic formulas.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between the two astronauts is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) and \(v_B = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.142857c
\]

The negative sign indicates that the second astronaut is moving backward relative to the first astronaut. The magnitude of the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but let's try to tackle this step by step.

Oh right, because when objects are moving at significant fractions of the speed of light, you can't just do a simple subtraction. I remember the formula for adding velocities relativistically.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. Let's say the first astronaut is A, moving at u = 0.6c in the lab frame. The second astronaut B is moving at v = 0.5c in the same direction.

So the relative velocity would be (-0.1c) / 0.7 ≈ -0.142857c. The negative sign indicates that B is moving in the opposite direction relative to A, meaning from A's perspective, B is moving backward. But the question just asks for the relative speed, so the magnitude is 0.142857c, approximately 0.14c. So looking at the options, options C and D have 0.14c as the relative speed.

Now, moving on to the total energy. The total energy of the system would be the sum of the relativistic energies of each astronaut.

The relativistic energy is given by E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So for the first astronaut (mass 2m, speed 0.6c):

gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6c)^2 / c²) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.36) = 1 / sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25.

So E1 = gamma1 * 2m c² = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

For the second astronaut (mass 3m, speed 0.5c):

gamma2 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.5)^2) = 1 / sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547.

E2 = gamma2 * 3m c² ≈ 1.1547 * 3m c² ≈ 3.464 m c².

So total energy E = E1 + E2 ≈ 2.5 m c² + 3.464 m c² ≈ 5.964 m c². Let's say approximately 5.96 m c².

Looking at the options, option C says E=5.96 mc², and option D says E=5 mc². So the correct total energy would match option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Yes, for astronaut A: 0.6c, so v²/c²=0.36. 1 - 0.36=0.64, sqrt is 0.8, reciprocal is 1.25. So E1=2m * 1.25 c² = 2.5 mc².

Astronaut B: v=0.5c. v²/c²=0.25. 1 - 0.25=0.75. sqrt(0.75)=sqrt(3/4)=sqrt(3)/2≈0.866. So 1/gamma is 0.866, so gamma is 1/0.866≈1.1547.

So E2=3m * 1.1547 c² ≈3.464 m c².

Adding 2.5 and 3.464 gives 5.964, which is about 5.96. So the total energy is approximately 5.96 mc².

Looking at the options, option C has E=5.96 mc², and relative speed 0.14c. Option D has E=5 mc², same speed.

So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts and the total energy of the system using relativistic formulas.

### Relative Speed
The relative speed between the two astronauts is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_B - v_A}{1 - \frac{v_A v_B}{c^2}}
\]

Here, \(v_A = 0.6c\) and \(v_B = 0.5c\). Substituting these values:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.5c - 0.6c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{-0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{-0.1c}{0.7} \approx -0.142857c
\]

The negative sign indicates that the second astronaut is moving backward relative to the first astronaut. The magnitude of the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

### Total Energy of the System
The total energy of the system is the sum of the relativistic energies of the two astronauts. The relativistic energy of an object is given by:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

#### For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):
\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.6c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.36}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

#### For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):
\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{(0.5c)^2}{c^2}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.25}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

#### Total Energy:
\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.964m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

### Final Answer
The relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\), and the total energy of the system is approximately \(5.96m c^2\). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:
