Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electrons, positrons, and photons. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

So, there's an electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy. One photon is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Wait, Lorentz factors are given as 4 and 2. Lorentz factor gamma is E/(m c²), right? So the electron has gamma_e =4, and positron gamma_p=2.

Electron and positron have the same mass, right? So the electron's energy would be gamma_e * m c², and the positron's energy gamma_p * m c².

But wait, when they annihilate, they produce two photons. The total energy and momentum must be conserved. So I need to apply conservation of energy and momentum here.

First, let's think about the initial momenta. Since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their momenta are in opposite directions.

The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by p = gamma * m v, but also, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), another formula for momentum is p = gamma m v = gamma m (c^2) (v/c²) ) = gamma m v. Alternatively, p can be written as gamma m v = gamma m c² (v/(c²)) = (gamma m c²) (v/(c²)) )? Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute using the relativistic momentum formula: p = gamma m v, but v can be expressed in terms of beta (β = v/c).

Alternatively, for a particle, the total energy E is gamma m c², and momentum p is gamma m v. Since v = β c, so p = gamma m β c. And beta can be found from gamma: gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

Wait, let's compute the velocities or betas for both particles.

For the electron (gamma_e =4):
beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/(4²)) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682 c.

Direction: moving from left to right, so let's say positive x-direction.

Positron (gamma_p =2):
beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/(2²)) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660 c.

Direction: moving from right to left, so negative x-direction. So its velocity is - beta_p c.

Wait, but when they collide, their momenta are opposite in direction. So the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e m beta_e c, and the positron's is p_p = gamma_p m beta_p c, but since it's moving in the opposite direction, its momentum would be negative. So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e - p_p.

Wait, wait. Let me get the directions right. The electron is moving to the right (from left), positron moving to the left (from right). So their velocities are in opposite directions. So the positron's momentum is negative in this coordinate system where the electron's is positive.

So initial momentum is p_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left) = p_e - p_p.

Wait, no. Because if the positron is moving to the left, its momentum vector is negative. So p_initial = p_e (positive) + (-p_p) (since p_p is the magnitude, but direction is negative). So p_initial = (gamma_e m beta_e c) - (gamma_p m beta_p c).

Wait, but let's compute the actual values.

Compute beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c.

gamma_e =4, so p_e =4 m_e beta_e c.

Similarly, p_p = gamma_p m_e beta_p c. gamma_p=2, so p_p=2 m_e beta_p c.

Now, the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so it's -p_p.

So total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e - p_p = (4 m_e beta_e c) - (2 m_e beta_p c).

We can factor out m_e c: m_e c (4 beta_e - 2 beta_p).

Compute 4 beta_e =4*(sqrt(15)/4) = sqrt(15). 2 beta_p = 2*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3).

So p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, let me compute sqrt(15) ≈3.87298, sqrt(3)≈1.73205.

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈2.14093.

So p_initial ≈ m_e c * 2.14093.

Now, what about the energy? The total energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.

E_initial = gamma_e m_e c² + gamma_p m_e c² = (4 + 2) m_e c² =6 m_e c².

After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energy. Let's denote each photon's energy as E_photon. So since there are two photons, E_photon *2 =6 m_e c² → E_photon=3 m_e c².

Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, because each photon's energy is the same, so 2 E_photon =6 m_e c² → E_photon=3 m_e c².

Wait, but each photon is moving in opposite y-directions, but same energy.

Wait no, in the problem statement, both photons have same energy, but the problem says one is moving upper-right, another lower-right. So they are both moving in the right direction, but in different vertical directions.

Wait, but that's confusing. How can both photons be moving to the right? If they're both moving in the same direction (right), but one upward and one downward, would that conserve momentum? Because their horizontal (x) components would add, but the vertical (y) components would cancel? Hmm, maybe.

Wait, but wait: The problem states that one photon is moving upper-right and another lower-right. So their directions are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. So their y-components would be opposite, but same magnitude.

So for each photon, the momentum can be represented as a vector. Photon's momentum magnitude is E/c. So for each photon, the momentum vector is (p_x, p_y), and the magnitude is sqrt(p_x² + p_y²) = E_photon/c.

Since both photons have the same E_photon =3 m_e c².

So E_photon =3 m_e c².

So the magnitude of each photon's momentum is (3 m_e c²)/c =3 m_e c.

So each photon's momentum vector has magnitude 3 m_e c.

Now, we can model each photon's momentum as vectors. Let's denote the directions.

Photon 1: upper-right. So its momentum has positive x and positive y components.

Photon 2: lower-right. So positive x and negative y components.

Since their energies are the same, their momentum magnitudes are same.

Let me denote the angle each photon makes with the x-axis as theta and -theta, because they are symmetric. So photon 1 makes an angle theta above x-axis, photon 2 theta below.

Because their energies are same, and their angles are symmetric, the y-components would be equal in magnitude but opposite.

So for photon 1: p1x =3 m_e c cos(theta), p1y=3 m_e c sin(theta).

Photon 2: p2x=3 m_e c cos(theta), p2y= -3 m_e c sin(theta).

So the total momentum after collision is the sum of the two photon momenta.

p_total_x = p1x + p2x = 3 m_e c cos(theta) *2 =6 m_e c cos(theta).

p_total_y = p1y + p2y= 3 m_e c sin(theta) -3 m_e c sin(theta)=0.

Now, according to conservation of momentum, the total initial momentum must equal the total final momentum.

Initial momentum is p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)) ≈2.14093 m_e c in the x-direction.

So p_initial_x =2.14093 m_e c, p_initial_y=0.

So the final momentum in x must equal initial x, and y must be zero.

Which it is. So the y-components cancel, and x-components sum to 6 m_e c cos(theta) =2.14093 m_e c.

So let's write that equation:

6 m_e c cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

Compute the right-hand side:

sqrt(15)=3.87298, sqrt(3)=1.73205. So their difference is about 2.14093.

So 6 cos(theta)=2.14093 → cos(theta)=2.14093/6 ≈0.35682.

So theta= arccos(0.35682). Let's compute that.

Arccos(0.35682) is about 69 degrees. Because cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)=0.3420. 0.3568 is between, closer to 70 degrees. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps exact expressions can be used. Let's see.

Wait, but the problem is about the angle between the two photons. Since each is at theta above and below the x-axis, the angle between them is 2 theta.

Wait, no. If one is at +theta and the other at -theta, the angle between their directions is 2 theta.

So if theta≈69 degrees, the angle between photons is about 138 degrees.

Wait, but wait, because the electron and positron are annihilating, so the photons should carry off the total momentum. Let me think.

But wait, another approach: since the initial momentum is along the x-axis, and the photons' momenta have components along x and y, but their y-components cancel, so the total y momentum is zero. So the x components must add up to the initial x momentum.

So, the calculation I did earlier holds.

So in this case, 6 cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So theta = arccos( (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6 )

Wait, let me compute (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ≈3.87298 -1.73205=2.14093.

Divided by 6: ≈0.35682.

So theta is arccos(0.35682) ≈69 degrees.

So the angle between the two photons is 2 theta, which would be about 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138, so the answer should be C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, producing two photons with equal energy. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.

### Step 1: Initial Momentum and Energy
The electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis with Lorentz factors $\gamma_e = 4$ and $\gamma_p = 2$, respectively. Their velocities are determined using the relativistic relation $\beta = \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma^2}$:
- For the electron: $\beta_e = \sqrt{1 - 1/16} = \sqrt{15}/4 \approx 0.9682$.
- For the positron: $\beta_p = \sqrt{1 - 1/4} = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.8660$.

The momentum of each particle is given by $p = \gamma m \beta c$. Factoring out $m c$, the total initial momentum is:
\[
p_{\text{initial}} = m c (\gamma_e \beta_e - \gamma_p \beta_p) = m c (4 \cdot \sqrt{15}/4 - 2 \cdot \sqrt{3}/2) = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]
Approximating $\sqrt{15} \approx 3.87298$ and $\sqrt{3} \approx 1.73205$, we find:
\[
p_{\text{initial}} \approx m c (3.87298 - 1.73205) \approx m c (2.14093).
\]

The total initial energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_e m c^2 + \gamma_p m c^2 = (4 + 2) m c^2 = 6 m c^2.
\]

### Step 2: Photon Energies and Momentum
After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energy $E_{\text{photon}}$. Since energy is conserved:
\[
2 E_{\text{photon}} = 6 m c^2 \implies E_{\text{photon}} = 3 m c^2.
\]

The momentum of each photon is $p_{\text{photon}} = E_{\text{photon}} / c = 3 m c$. The photons are moving in symmetric directions: one at an angle $\theta$ above the x-axis (upper-right) and the other at $-\theta$ below the x-axis (lower-right). The momentum components of each photon are:
- Photon 1: $p_{1x} = 3 m c \cos\theta$, $p_{1y} = 3 m c \sin\theta$.
- Photon 2: $p_{2x} = 3 m c \cos\theta$, $p_{2y} = -3 m c \sin\theta$.

The total momentum after annihilation is:
\[
p_{\text{final}} = (p_{1x} + p_{2x}, p_{1y} + p_{2y}) = (6 m c \cos\theta, 0).
\]

### Step 3: Conservation of Momentum
By conservation of momentum, the total initial momentum equals the total final momentum:
\[
p_{\text{initial}} = p_{\text{final}} \implies m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) = 6 m c \cos\theta.
\]
Dividing through by $m c$:
\[
\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} = 6 \cos\theta.
\]
Approximating $\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \approx 2.14093$, we solve for $\cos\theta$:
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{2.14093}{6} \approx 0.35682.
\]
Thus:
\[
\theta = \arccos(0.35682) \approx 69^\circ.
\]

### Step 4: Angle Between the Photons
Since the photons are symmetrically directed at $\pm\theta$, the angle between them is:
\[
\phi = 2\theta \approx 2 \cdot 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
\]

### Final Answer
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about electrons, positrons, and photons. Hmm, let me read the question carefully.

So, there's an electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy. One photon is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. I need to find the angle between their directions.

Wait, Lorentz factors are given as 4 and 2. Lorentz factor gamma is E/(m c²), right? So the electron has gamma_e =4, and positron gamma_p=2.

Electron and positron have the same mass, right? So the electron's energy would be gamma_e * m c², and the positron's energy gamma_p * m c².

But wait, when they annihilate, they produce two photons. The total energy and momentum must be conserved. So I need to apply conservation of energy and momentum here.

First, let's think about the initial momenta. Since the electron and positron are moving towards each other, their momenta are in opposite directions.

The momentum of a relativistic particle is given by p = gamma * m v, but also, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), another formula for momentum is p = gamma m v = gamma m (c^2) (v/c²) ) = gamma m v. Alternatively, p can be written as gamma m v = gamma m c² (v/(c²)) = (gamma m c²) (v/(c²)) )? Hmm, maybe it's easier to compute using the relativistic momentum formula: p = gamma m v, but v can be expressed in terms of beta (β = v/c).

Alternatively, for a particle, the total energy E is gamma m c², and momentum p is gamma m v. Since v = β c, so p = gamma m β c. And beta can be found from gamma: gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - beta²). So beta = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma²).

Wait, let's compute the velocities or betas for both particles.

For the electron (gamma_e =4):
beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/(4²)) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682 c.

Direction: moving from left to right, so let's say positive x-direction.

Positron (gamma_p =2):
beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/(2²)) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660 c.

Direction: moving from right to left, so negative x-direction. So its velocity is - beta_p c.

Wait, but when they collide, their momenta are opposite in direction. So the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e m beta_e c, and the positron's is p_p = gamma_p m beta_p c, but since it's moving in the opposite direction, its momentum would be negative. So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e - p_p.

Wait, wait. Let me get the directions right. The electron is moving to the right (from left), positron moving to the left (from right). So their velocities are in opposite directions. So the positron's momentum is negative in this coordinate system where the electron's is positive.

So initial momentum is p_initial = p_e (right) + p_p (left) = p_e - p_p.

Wait, no. Because if the positron is moving to the left, its momentum vector is negative. So p_initial = p_e (positive) + (-p_p) (since p_p is the magnitude, but direction is negative). So p_initial = (gamma_e m beta_e c) - (gamma_p m beta_p c).

Wait, but let's compute the actual values.

Compute beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682.

beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e * c.

gamma_e =4, so p_e =4 m_e beta_e c.

Similarly, p_p = gamma_p m_e beta_p c. gamma_p=2, so p_p=2 m_e beta_p c.

Now, the positron's momentum is in the opposite direction, so it's -p_p.

So total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e - p_p = (4 m_e beta_e c) - (2 m_e beta_p c).

We can factor out m_e c: m_e c (4 beta_e - 2 beta_p).

Compute 4 beta_e =4*(sqrt(15)/4) = sqrt(15). 2 beta_p = 2*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3).

So p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, let me compute sqrt(15) ≈3.87298, sqrt(3)≈1.73205.

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈2.14093.

So p_initial ≈ m_e c * 2.14093.

Now, what about the energy? The total energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron.

E_initial = gamma_e m_e c² + gamma_p m_e c² = (4 + 2) m_e c² =6 m_e c².

After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energy. Let's denote each photon's energy as E_photon. So since there are two photons, E_photon *2 =6 m_e c² → E_photon=3 m_e c².

Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, because each photon's energy is the same, so 2 E_photon =6 m_e c² → E_photon=3 m_e c².

Wait, but each photon is moving in opposite y-directions, but same energy.

Wait no, in the problem statement, both photons have same energy, but the problem says one is moving upper-right, another lower-right. So they are both moving in the right direction, but in different vertical directions.

Wait, but that's confusing. How can both photons be moving to the right? If they're both moving in the same direction (right), but one upward and one downward, would that conserve momentum? Because their horizontal (x) components would add, but the vertical (y) components would cancel? Hmm, maybe.

Wait, but wait: The problem states that one photon is moving upper-right and another lower-right. So their directions are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. So their y-components would be opposite, but same magnitude.

So for each photon, the momentum can be represented as a vector. Photon's momentum magnitude is E/c. So for each photon, the momentum vector is (p_x, p_y), and the magnitude is sqrt(p_x² + p_y²) = E_photon/c.

Since both photons have the same E_photon =3 m_e c².

So E_photon =3 m_e c².

So the magnitude of each photon's momentum is (3 m_e c²)/c =3 m_e c.

So each photon's momentum vector has magnitude 3 m_e c.

Now, we can model each photon's momentum as vectors. Let's denote the directions.

Photon 1: upper-right. So its momentum has positive x and positive y components.

Photon 2: lower-right. So positive x and negative y components.

Since their energies are the same, their momentum magnitudes are same.

Let me denote the angle each photon makes with the x-axis as theta and -theta, because they are symmetric. So photon 1 makes an angle theta above x-axis, photon 2 theta below.

Because their energies are same, and their angles are symmetric, the y-components would be equal in magnitude but opposite.

So for photon 1: p1x =3 m_e c cos(theta), p1y=3 m_e c sin(theta).

Photon 2: p2x=3 m_e c cos(theta), p2y= -3 m_e c sin(theta).

So the total momentum after collision is the sum of the two photon momenta.

p_total_x = p1x + p2x = 3 m_e c cos(theta) *2 =6 m_e c cos(theta).

p_total_y = p1y + p2y= 3 m_e c sin(theta) -3 m_e c sin(theta)=0.

Now, according to conservation of momentum, the total initial momentum must equal the total final momentum.

Initial momentum is p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15)-sqrt(3)) ≈2.14093 m_e c in the x-direction.

So p_initial_x =2.14093 m_e c, p_initial_y=0.

So the final momentum in x must equal initial x, and y must be zero.

Which it is. So the y-components cancel, and x-components sum to 6 m_e c cos(theta) =2.14093 m_e c.

So let's write that equation:

6 m_e c cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Divide both sides by m_e c:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

Compute the right-hand side:

sqrt(15)=3.87298, sqrt(3)=1.73205. So their difference is about 2.14093.

So 6 cos(theta)=2.14093 → cos(theta)=2.14093/6 ≈0.35682.

So theta= arccos(0.35682). Let's compute that.

Arccos(0.35682) is about 69 degrees. Because cos(60)=0.5, cos(70)=0.3420. 0.3568 is between, closer to 70 degrees. Let me compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps exact expressions can be used. Let's see.

Wait, but the problem is about the angle between the two photons. Since each is at theta above and below the x-axis, the angle between them is 2 theta.

Wait, no. If one is at +theta and the other at -theta, the angle between their directions is 2 theta.

So if theta≈69 degrees, the angle between photons is about 138 degrees.

Wait, but wait, because the electron and positron are annihilating, so the photons should carry off the total momentum. Let me think.

But wait, another approach: since the initial momentum is along the x-axis, and the photons' momenta have components along x and y, but their y-components cancel, so the total y momentum is zero. So the x components must add up to the initial x momentum.

So, the calculation I did earlier holds.

So in this case, 6 cos(theta) = (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So theta = arccos( (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) /6 )

Wait, let me compute (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ≈3.87298 -1.73205=2.14093.

Divided by 6: ≈0.35682.

So theta is arccos(0.35682) ≈69 degrees.

So the angle between the two photons is 2 theta, which would be about 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138, so the answer should be C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of an electron and a positron, producing two photons with equal energy. The goal is to determine the angle between the directions of the photons.

### Step 1: Initial Momentum and Energy
The electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis with Lorentz factors $\gamma_e = 4$ and $\gamma_p = 2$, respectively. Their velocities are determined using the relativistic relation $\beta = \sqrt{1 - 1/\gamma^2}$:
- For the electron: $\beta_e = \sqrt{1 - 1/16} = \sqrt{15}/4 \approx 0.9682$.
- For the positron: $\beta_p = \sqrt{1 - 1/4} = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.8660$.

The momentum of each particle is given by $p = \gamma m \beta c$. Factoring out $m c$, the total initial momentum is:
\[
p_{\text{initial}} = m c (\gamma_e \beta_e - \gamma_p \beta_p) = m c (4 \cdot \sqrt{15}/4 - 2 \cdot \sqrt{3}/2) = m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]
Approximating $\sqrt{15} \approx 3.87298$ and $\sqrt{3} \approx 1.73205$, we find:
\[
p_{\text{initial}} \approx m c (3.87298 - 1.73205) \approx m c (2.14093).
\]

The total initial energy is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_e m c^2 + \gamma_p m c^2 = (4 + 2) m c^2 = 6 m c^2.
\]

### Step 2: Photon Energies and Momentum
After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energy $E_{\text{photon}}$. Since energy is conserved:
\[
2 E_{\text{photon}} = 6 m c^2 \implies E_{\text{photon}} = 3 m c^2.
\]

The momentum of each photon is $p_{\text{photon}} = E_{\text{photon}} / c = 3 m c$. The photons are moving in symmetric directions: one at an angle $\theta$ above the x-axis (upper-right) and the other at $-\theta$ below the x-axis (lower-right). The momentum components of each photon are:
- Photon 1: $p_{1x} = 3 m c \cos\theta$, $p_{1y} = 3 m c \sin\theta$.
- Photon 2: $p_{2x} = 3 m c \cos\theta$, $p_{2y} = -3 m c \sin\theta$.

The total momentum after annihilation is:
\[
p_{\text{final}} = (p_{1x} + p_{2x}, p_{1y} + p_{2y}) = (6 m c \cos\theta, 0).
\]

### Step 3: Conservation of Momentum
By conservation of momentum, the total initial momentum equals the total final momentum:
\[
p_{\text{initial}} = p_{\text{final}} \implies m c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}) = 6 m c \cos\theta.
\]
Dividing through by $m c$:
\[
\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} = 6 \cos\theta.
\]
Approximating $\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3} \approx 2.14093$, we solve for $\cos\theta$:
\[
\cos\theta = \frac{2.14093}{6} \approx 0.35682.
\]
Thus:
\[
\theta = \arccos(0.35682) \approx 69^\circ.
\]

### Step 4: Angle Between the Photons
Since the photons are symmetrically directed at $\pm\theta$, the angle between them is:
\[
\phi = 2\theta \approx 2 \cdot 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
\]

### Final Answer
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.

Answer: C
