Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that a harmonic oscillator is a system that experiences a restoring force proportional to its displacement, like F = -kx. But wait, this is relativistic, so we can't ignore special relativity effects. 

The question is asking for the maximum speed v_max of the mass. The options are A, B, C, D. Let me think about what I know.

In the classical (non-relativistic) case, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator occurs when all the potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. So, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv_max². Solving that, v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m). Looking at the options, option C is exactly that. But wait, the question is about a relativistic scenario, so C can't be the right answer here. Oh, right, because in relativity, the energies are different.

In relativity, the total energy includes rest mass energy. The energy of the oscillator would be the sum of the rest energy and the kinetic plus potential. Wait, but for a harmonic oscillator, potential and kinetic energies are equal at certain points—like at the equilibrium point, kinetic is maximum, potential is zero. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, in the classical case, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the potential energy is maximum, kinetic is zero. As it moves towards equilibrium, potential decreases and kinetic increases.

In the relativistic case, the total energy E is given by gamma times mc². But how does this tie into the potential and kinetic energy?

Wait, perhaps I should consider energy conservation. The total mechanical energy in the oscillator would be the sum of the rest energy and the vibrational energy. Wait, but in the harmonic oscillator, the total energy (kinetic + potential) is constant. But in relativity, the total energy is gamma mc². Wait, maybe that's not the right approach.

Another approach: The potential energy in a harmonic oscillator is (1/2)kx², and the kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m). But in relativity, the momentum p is related to velocity v by gamma m v. So kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². Or wait, maybe I should think in terms of four-momentum or relativistic energy equations.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the energy equation in terms of relativistic mechanics. The total energy E of the oscillator would be the sum of the rest energy and the vibrational energy. But I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, let's consider the point where the oscillator is at maximum displacement, x = A. At that point, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². The kinetic energy is zero in the classical case, but in relativity, the total energy is still gamma mc². But wait, in the classical case, the total energy (mechanical) is (1/2)kA². So in relativity, the mechanical energy would be E_mech = E_total - mc². Because E_total is gamma mc², so E_mech = (gamma mc²) - mc² = (gamma - 1) mc².

Wait, perhaps that's the way to model it. So, the total mechanical energy, which is the sum of kinetic and potential, is (gamma - 1) mc². But wait, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, maybe the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the mechanical energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the oscillator's total energy is gamma mc², which includes both the rest energy and the vibrational energy. So, when the oscillator is at x=0 (equilibrium), all the energy is kinetic. At x=A, all energy is potential.

Wait, but in the classical case, the potential and kinetic energies are equal on average. But perhaps in the relativistic case, that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the rest energy is mc², and the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc². But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. For a relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is still (1/2)k x², but the kinetic energy is not (p²)/(2m), since that's the non-relativistic expression. The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1) mc².

So, the total energy at any point is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy. But wait, the total energy in relativity is gamma mc², which equals the rest energy plus the kinetic energy.

Wait, perhaps the maximum speed occurs when the potential energy is zero, i.e., at x=0. So, the kinetic energy is maximum there. So, the total energy would be gamma mc² = mc² + kinetic energy. But when x=0, the potential energy is zero, so the mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is equal to the kinetic energy.

Wait, but the total energy in relativity is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So, E_total = mc² + K. But K is (gamma - 1) mc². So, E_total = mc² + (gamma - 1) mc² = gamma mc². That makes sense.

So, the mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) is E_mech = K + U. At x = 0, K is maximum, U is zero. So, E_mech = K = (gamma - 1) mc². At x = A, U is (1/2)k A², and K is zero. So, E_mech = (1/2)k A².

Wait, so in that case, (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2) k A². So, we can solve for gamma here.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, substituting, gamma = 1 + (1/2)(k A²)/(m c²) ). Wait, because (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2) k A² → gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) → gamma is (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) → maybe better to write it as (gamma) = [ 2 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c²).

Wait, but let me recheck that. From (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2) k A²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c²).

So, gamma is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, that seems a bit off. Because gamma is greater than 1. So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me write that equation:

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, I need to solve for v_max. Because v_max occurs at x=0, where the velocity is maximum. So, at that point, x=0, so v is maximum.

So, let's solve for v from that equation.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable, say, α = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then, equation becomes:

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + α.

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / (1 + α).

Squaring both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1 / (1 + α)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - [1 / (1 + α)^2 ].

So,

v²/c² = [ (1 + α)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + α)^2.

Let me compute numerator:

(1 + α)^2 - 1 = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 - 1 = 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha^2 ) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Factor numerator: alpha (2 + alpha ) / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha is small, perhaps? Because if k A² is much less than 2 m c², then alpha is small, and we can approximate.

But the question doesn't specify that, so we have to keep it exact.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor this expression.

Wait, (1 + alpha)^2 = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2 = [2 alpha + alpha^2 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v²/c² = alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Substituting back,

v²/c² = [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2.

Hmm, let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ 2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ]

Denominator: [1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 + 2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ] Wait, no, denominator is (1 + alpha)^2, which is [1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))]^2.

Let me compute denominator: [1 + alpha]^2 = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha².

So, v²/c² = [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / [ (1 + alpha)^2 ].

Let me factor this:

= [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

= [ alpha ( (1 + alpha) + 1 ) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find v as a function of alpha.

Wait, let me compute v_max:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2 ) )

Simplify inside the square root:

= sqrt{ [ alpha (2 + alpha) ) ] / (1 + alpha)^2 }.

= sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha).

Hmm.

Let me see what the options are.

Looking back at the options:

Option A) v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m) )^2 )

Wait, that doesn't look like what I have. Let me check the other options.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) )) → inside the sqrt, 1 plus reciprocal of (1 - something), which is not matching.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Hmm, wait. Let's compute 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

Wait, earlier, we have:

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

Wait, no, wait. Let me recap. Earlier, from 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha,

We have sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha),

So 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2,

So v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Which is the same as [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2 → which is [ 2 alpha + alpha² ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

But I think I messed up earlier steps. Let me recheck.

Wait, when we have 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha,

Then,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha),

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/( (1 + alpha)^2 ),

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2],

Which is,

v²/c² = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

As before.

Hmm, but looking at the options, is any option matching this?

Option D says v_max = c*sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Which would be,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + alpha )^2 ] )

Which is exactly what I have for v^2/c^2. So,

v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha )^2 ].

So, v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + alpha )^2 ] )

Which is option D.

Wait, let me check.

Option D is: c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Yes. So, the correct answer is option D.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. The key was that the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) equals (gamma - 1) mc^2. Because in the non-relativistic case, the mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which equals (1/2)mv_max². But in relativity, the mechanical energy is E_mech = (gamma - 1) mc^2.

Wait, but is that correct? Because in relativity, the total energy is gamma mc^2, which includes rest mass energy. So, the mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) would be E_mech = gamma mc^2 - mc² = (gamma - 1 ) mc².

Yes, that makes sense. So, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic is zero, so E_mech = (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1 ) mc^2.

Wait, but wait a second. In the classical case, E_mech is (1/2)kA², which is equal to the kinetic energy at x=0. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1 ) mc², so setting E_mech = (gamma - 1 ) mc², which equals (1/2)kA².

So, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

Thus, the approach was correct, leading to option D.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law (\( F = -kx \)), we analyze the system using relativistic energy considerations.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Framework**:  
   The total energy of the oscillator is given by \( E_{\text{total}} = \gamma mc^2 \), where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \). The mechanical energy, which is the sum of kinetic and potential energy, is \( E_{\text{mechanical}} = E_{\text{total}} - mc^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2 \).

2. **Energy Conservation**:  
   At maximum displacement (\( x = A \)), the potential energy is \( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the kinetic energy is zero. Thus, the mechanical energy is entirely potential:  
   \[
   E_{\text{mechanical}} = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]  
   At the equilibrium point (\( x = 0 \)), the potential energy is zero, and the mechanical energy is entirely kinetic. Therefore:  
   \[
   (\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]

3. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   From the above equation, we solve for \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

4. **Solving for \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   Let \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \alpha.
   \]  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
   \]  
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

5. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is given by:  
\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
\]

Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a relativistic harmonic oscillator.

The kinetic energy is zero in the classical case, but in relativity, the total energy is still gamma mc². But wait, in the classical case, the total energy (mechanical) is (1/2)kA². So in relativity, the mechanical energy would be E_mech = E_total - mc². Because E_total is gamma mc², so E_mech = (gamma mc²) - mc² = (gamma - 1) mc².

Wait, perhaps that's the way to model it. So, the total mechanical energy, which is the sum of kinetic and potential, is (gamma - 1) mc². But wait, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, maybe the total energy is the sum of the rest energy and the mechanical energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the oscillator's total energy is gamma mc², which includes both the rest energy and the vibrational energy. So, when the oscillator is at x=0 (equilibrium), all the energy is kinetic. At x=A, all energy is potential.

So, the total energy at any point is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy. But wait, the total energy in relativity is gamma mc², which equals the rest energy plus the kinetic energy.

Wait, perhaps the maximum speed occurs when the potential energy is zero, i.e., at x=0. So, the kinetic energy is maximum there. So, the total energy would be gamma mc² = mc² + kinetic energy. But when x=0, the potential energy is zero, so the mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) is equal to the kinetic energy.

Wait, but the total energy in relativity is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. So, E_total = mc² + K. But K is (gamma - 1) mc². So, E_total = mc² + (gamma - 1) mc² = gamma mc². That makes sense.

So, the mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) is E_mech = K + U. At x = 0, K is maximum, U is zero. So, E_mech = K = (gamma - 1) mc². At x = A, U is (1/2)k A², and K is zero. So, E_mech = (1/2)k A².

Wait, so in that case, (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2) k A². So, we can solve for gamma here.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So, substituting, gamma = 1 + (1/2)(k A²)/(m c²) ). Wait, because (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2) k A² → gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

So, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) → gamma is (2 m c² + k A²)/(2 m c²) → maybe better to write it as (gamma) = [ 2 m c² + k A² ] / (2 m c²).

Wait, but let me recheck that. From (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2) k A²:

gamma = 1 + (k A²) / (2 m c²).

So, gamma is 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²). Then, gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Wait, that seems a bit off. Because gamma is greater than 1. So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Let me write that equation:

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Hmm, I need to solve for v_max. Because v_max occurs at x=0, where the velocity is maximum. So, at that point, x=0, so v is maximum.

So, let's solve for v from that equation.

Let me denote (k A²)/(2 m c²) as a variable, say, α = (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Then, equation becomes:

1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + α.

So,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 / (1 + α).

Squaring both sides:

1 - v²/c² = 1 / (1 + α)^2.

Then,

v²/c² = 1 - [1 / (1 + α)^2 ].

So,

v²/c² = [ (1 + α)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + α)^2.

Let me compute numerator:

(1 + α)^2 - 1 = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 - 1 = 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

v²/c² = (2 alpha + alpha^2 ) / (1 + alpha)^2.

Factor numerator: alpha (2 + alpha ) / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha is small, perhaps? Because if k A² is much less than 2 m c², then alpha is small, and we can approximate.

But the question doesn't specify that, so we have to keep it exact.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor this expression.

Wait, (1 + alpha)^2 = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

v²/c² = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2 = [2 alpha + alpha^2 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

So,

v²/c² = alpha (2 + alpha) / (1 + alpha)^2.

But alpha is (k A²)/(2 m c²).

Substituting back,

v²/c² = [ (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) * (2 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2.

Hmm, let's compute numerator and denominator.

Numerator: (k A²/(2 m c²)) * [ 2 + (k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ]

Denominator: [1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))^2 + 2*(k A²/(2 m c²)) ) ] Wait, no, denominator is (1 + alpha)^2, which is [1 + (k A²/(2 m c²))]^2.

Let me compute denominator: [1 + alpha]^2 = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha².

So, v²/c² = [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / [ (1 + alpha)^2 ].

Let me factor this:

= [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, perhaps I can write this as:

= [ alpha ( (1 + alpha) + 1 ) ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to find v as a function of alpha.

Wait, let me compute v_max:

v_max = c * sqrt( [ alpha (2 + alpha) ] / (1 + alpha)^2 ) )

Simplify inside the square root:

= sqrt{ [ alpha (2 + alpha) ) ] / (1 + alpha)^2 }.

= sqrt( alpha (2 + alpha) ) / (1 + alpha).

Hmm.

Let me see what the options are.

Looking back at the options:

Option A) v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m) )^2 )

Wait, that doesn't look like what I have. Let me check the other options.

Option B: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c²) )) → inside the sqrt, 1 plus reciprocal of (1 - something), which is not matching.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Hmm, wait. Let's compute 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

Wait, earlier, we have:

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2 ].

Wait, no, wait. Let me recap. Earlier, from 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha,

We have sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha),

So 1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + alpha)^2,

So v²/c² = 1 - 1/(1 + alpha)^2.

Which is the same as [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2 → which is [ 2 alpha + alpha² ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

But I think I messed up earlier steps. Let me recheck.

Wait, when we have 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + alpha,

Then,

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1/(1 + alpha),

So,

1 - v²/c² = 1/( (1 + alpha)^2 ),

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha)^2],

Which is,

v²/c² = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

As before.

Hmm, but looking at the options, is any option matching this?

Option D says v_max = c*sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²) )^2 )

Which would be,

v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - [1/(1 + alpha )^2 ] )

Which is exactly what I have for v^2/c^2. So,

v_max^2/c^2 = 1 - [1/(1 + alpha )^2 ].

So, v_max = c * sqrt(1 - [1/(1 + alpha )^2 ] )

Which is option D.

Wait, let me check.

Option D is: c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA²)/(2 m c^2) )^2 )

Yes. So, the correct answer is option D.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial setup. The key was that the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) equals (gamma - 1) mc^2. Because in the non-relativistic case, the mechanical energy is (1/2)kA², which equals (1/2)mv_max². But in relativity, the mechanical energy is E_mech = (gamma - 1) mc^2.

Wait, but is that correct? Because in relativity, the total energy is gamma mc^2, which includes rest mass energy. So, the mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) would be E_mech = gamma mc^2 - mc² = (gamma - 1 ) mc².

Yes, that makes sense. So, when the oscillator is at maximum displacement, the potential energy is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic is zero, so E_mech = (1/2)kA² = (gamma - 1 ) mc^2.

Wait, but wait a second. In the classical case, E_mech is (1/2)kA², which is equal to the kinetic energy at x=0. But in relativity, the kinetic energy is (gamma - 1 ) mc², so setting E_mech = (gamma - 1 ) mc², which equals (1/2)kA².

So, gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )

Thus, the approach was correct, leading to option D.

2. **Energy Conservation**:  
   At maximum displacement (\( x = A \)), the potential energy is \( U = \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \), and the kinetic energy is zero. Thus, the mechanical energy is entirely potential:  
   \[
   E_{\text{mechanical}} = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]  
   At the equilibrium point (\( x = 0 \)), the potential energy is zero, and the mechanical energy is entirely kinetic. Therefore:  
   \[
   (\gamma - 1)mc^2 = \frac{1}{2}kA^2.
   \]

3. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v \)**:  
   From the above equation, we solve for \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we get:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}.
   \]

4. **Solving for \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   Let \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \). Then:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \alpha.
   \]  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
   \]  
   Rearranging:  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + \alpha)^2}.
   \]  
   Substituting \( \alpha = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}.
   \]  
   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
   \]

5. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) with the given options, we find that it matches **Option D**.

### Conclusion:
The maximum speed of the relativistic harmonic oscillator is given by:  
\[
v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}.
