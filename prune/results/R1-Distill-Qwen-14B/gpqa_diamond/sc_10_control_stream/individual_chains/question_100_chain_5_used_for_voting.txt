Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me take it step by step. The question describes a series of reactions starting from Compound A, which is C3H6, and goes through several reactions to form Compounds B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. Then, I have to determine which statement about the products is incorrect.

First, let me figure out what each compound could be. I know that C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane. But considering the reactions, propene is more likely because cyclopropane is less reactive in such reactions. So, Compound A is propene.

The first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Bromination of alkenes typically adds bromine across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3) reacting with Br2 would add a Br across the double bond. So Compound B is probably 1,2-dibromopropane: Br-CH2-CHBr-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3? Or is it CH2=CHCH3? Oh, yes, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane: BrCH2CH2CH2Br? Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you add Br2 to propene, you get 1,2-dibromopropane as an addition product, right? So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually leads to elimination reactions. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane. Reacting with alcoholic KOH would likely cause an E2 elimination. The Brs are on adjacent carbons, so elimination would lose two Brs and form an alkene again. But wait, which position? 1,2-dibromopropane, when treated with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, would eliminate H and Br to form an alkene. So, the possible product would be propene again, but wait, there might be an issue. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CH2CH2Br) is symmetric, so elimination would form propene either as CH2=CH2CH3 or CH3CH=CH2? Wait, wait, no. Wait, if you have Br on C1 and C2, when you eliminate, you lose H from C3 and Br from C2, or H from C2 and Br from C1? Wait, let me think. The structure is Br-CH2-CH2-Br. Wait no, wait, the initial compound is BrCH2CH2CH2Br? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 across the double bond would give either 1,2-dibromopropane (if the addition is across the double bond) as BrCH2CHBrCH3. So the structure is Br on C1 and C2. So when KOH is added, which dehydrohalogenation occurs.

Elimination of two Brs: from C1 and C2. So the H would be abstracted from C2, and Br from C1, or vice versa? Wait, the structure is Br-CH2-CHBr-CH3. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me correct. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, making 1,2-dibromopropane, which is BrCH2CHBrCH3. Wait, that can't be right because the formula for 1,2-dibromopropane would be C3H6Br2. So in that case, when treated with alcoholic KOH, elimination occurs. The possible products would form either 1-propene or 2-propene? Wait, but wait. 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane as BrCH2CHBrCH3? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 in CCl4 would add Br across the double bond, giving CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So the structure is BrCH2CHBrCH3. So when treated with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two HBr molecules. The possible alkenes formed would be either 1-propene (CH2=CHCH3) or 2-propene (CH2CH2CH2Br eliminated? Wait, but wait, elimination would form either 1 or 2 propene. Wait, wait, for 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3), when eliminating, the hydrogen from which carbon?

Wait, in E2 elimination, the H is abstracted from a carbon adjacent to the one from which the leaving group (Br) departs. So in BrCH2CHBrCH3, each Br is on adjacent carbons. Let's imagine the molecule: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. The possible eliminations:

If H is removed from CH2Br (C1) and Br from C2, then the double bond forms between C1 and C2, giving CH2=CH-CH2Br? No, wait, no. Wait, in E2, the H and Br must be anti-periplanar. Let me think about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination would form either 1-propene or another isomer. Wait, but the di-substituted dibromide can form either 1 or 2 propene. Wait, if the two Brs are on C1 and C2, elimination can form a double bond between C1 and C2 (giving 1-propene, CH2=CHCH3) or between C2 and C3 (giving 2-propene, CH3CH=CH2). But wait, 2-propene is actually CH2=CHCH3 as well, but wait, no. Wait, propene can have the double bond between C1 and C2 (CH2=CHCH3) or between C2 and C3 (CH3CH=CH2). Wait, no, that's not possible because in propane, the carbons are 1, 2, 3. So for 2-propene, it would be CH2CH2CH3, but that's not possible because you can't have a double bond between C2 and C3 in propane. Wait, wait, propane is three carbons, so the double bond can only be between C1 and C2 because C3 is a CH3 group. So elimination of Brs from 1,2-dibromopropane would form 1-propene (CH2=CHCH3) or perhaps 2-propene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's more likely to form 1-propene.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider. If the starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3), when treated with alcoholic KOH, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. Let's consider the possible positions. The Brs are on C1 and C2. So for elimination, if a Br leaves from C1, the H must come from C2. That would form a double bond between C1 and C2. Alternatively, if the Br leaves from C2, the H could come from C1 or C3. Wait, but C3 has a CH3 group, so perhaps H from C3 is possible. If the H is from C3, elimination of Br from C2 and H from C3 would form a double bond between C2 and C3. But wait, in 1,2-dibromopropane, the structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3.

Wait, no, that can't be. If the structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3, then the carbons are 1 (CH2Br), 2 (CHBr), 3 (CH3). So elimination between C1 and C2 would form CH2=CH-CH3 (but wait, CH2Br and CHBr would eliminate to give CH2=CH, but what about the rest). Alternatively, elimination between C2 and C3 would form CH2-CH=CH3? Wait, but that would require the H to be on C3. So perhaps the major product is 1-propene (CH2=CHCH3) because that's more substituted. Wait, but wait, both possibilities would give the same product, right? Because 1-propene is CH2=CHCH3 and 2-propene is CH3CH=CH2, but in this case, perhaps the structure doesn't allow for 2-propene because the central carbon has two Brs. Hmm, maybe I'm making this more complicated than it is. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1-propene, so Compound C is propene.

Wait, but wait. When 1,2-dibromopropane is treated with alcoholic KOH, the product is probably 1-propene (CH2=CHCH3). So Compound C is propene again. But wait, this seems like a loop. Let me think again.

Wait, but another possibility is that the elimination leads to a cyclopropane ring. Because when vicinal dihalides ( adjacent dihalides) undergo elimination, sometimes they can form cyclopropane if the dihalide is of a cyclic structure. But in this case, 1,2-dibromopropane is linear, not cyclic, so elimination would form an alkene, not a cyclopropane.

So C is propene.

Next, Compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube. That's a condition for dehydrohalogenation? Wait, no, when alkenes are passed through red-hot iron, it's usually for the dehydrogenation reaction, which forms an alkynes. Wait, no, that's when you have alkanes. Wait, wait, no, for alkanes, passing through red-hot iron (or catalysts) can cause dehydrogenation to form alkenes. But for alkenes, passing through red-hot iron might be for further dehydrogenation to form alkynes. So propene (C) would react with red-hot iron to form acetylene (D is acetylene, C2H2? Wait, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When dehydrogenated, it would lose H2 and form an alkyne. So CH2=CHCH3 → CH≡CCH3 under such conditions? But wait, wait, the reaction conditions are a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne, but that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: passing alkenes through red-hot iron can sometimes lead to the formation of aromatic compounds, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrogenation reaction, but that would require H2 and a catalyst. Wait, no, in this case, the iron is red-hot, so perhaps it's a dehydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alkyne. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) upon dehydrogenation would form propyne (CH≡CCH3). But wait, that would require the loss of H2. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the formation of a diene, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more about breaking the molecule apart. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. When an alkene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it's a condition for the formation of an alkyne. For example, ethylene (ethene) can be dehydrogenated to acetylene (ethyne). So if C is propene, then D would be propyne (CH≡CCH3). But I'm not entirely confident about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-elimination, leading to a different structure. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the product D. If D is used in the next step to react with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. The two strong acids could be concentrated sulfuric and nitric acid, a mixture used for nitration. Alternatively, maybe it's a different mixture. But wait, if D is an alkyne, reacting with strong acids might not make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps D is benzene, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the steps.

Compound C is formed when B (1,2-dibromopropane) is treated with alcoholic KOH. Wait, another possibility: Could B be 1-bromo-2-methylpropane? No, because propene adding Br2 would add across the double bond, so it's 1,2-dibromopropane.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction between B and alcoholic KOH isn't elimination but substitution. Wait, no, because Br is on adjacent carbons, so elimination is more likely.

Wait, could the product be cyclopropane? Because when vicinal dihalides (adjacent dihalides) are treated with a strong base, sometimes cyclopropane can form via a double elimination. For example, 1,2-dibromopropane could lose two HBr molecules and form cyclopropane. So Compound C would be cyclopropane.

Hmm, that's a possibility. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, and when treated with alcoholic KOH (a strong base), it eliminates two HBr molecules, forming cyclopropane (C is cyclopropane). Then, when cyclopropane is passed through a red-hot iron tube, what happens? Well, cyclopropane is a strained ring and can undergo various reactions. Passing through red-hot iron could cause ring-opening. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrogenation reaction forming an alkyne or another structure.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the ring-opening of cyclopropane. Cyclopropane upon heating can undergo ring-opening to form alkenes. But without specific catalysts, I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me outline the steps again:

A: C3H6 → propene.

B: Bromination adds Br across double bond → 1,2-dibromopropane.

C: B reacts with alcoholic KOH → elimination → forms cyclopropane.

D: C (cyclopropane) passed through red-hot iron → maybe forms something else.

Wait, if cyclopropane is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's a hydrogenation or dehydrogenation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a thermal decomposition. Wait, cyclopropane is known to be unstable upon heating and can decompose into alkenes. But without knowing the exact conditions, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps cyclopropane upon treatment with red-hot iron would undergo some reaction. Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrogenation to form an alkyne. Wait, but cyclopropane has three carbons in a ring, so dehydrogenation would require breaking bonds. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the next steps because maybe that can help.

Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. If D is cyclopropane, what would happen? Alternatively, perhaps D is propyne.

Wait, let me try an alternative approach. Let's assume that when B (1,2-dibromopropane) is treated with alcoholic KOH, the product is cyclopropane. Then, when cyclopropane is treated with red-hot iron, maybe it's heated, causing ring-opening. Cyclopropane upon heating can ring-open to form propene or another alkene. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the heated cyclopropane doesn't change, and D is still cyclopropane. Then, D reacts with two strong acids. Let's say the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, a common mixture for nitration. Cyclopropane isn't typically nitrated because it's not aromatic, but maybe under certain conditions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps D is something else.

Wait, maybe I'm making a wrong assumption about Compound C. Let me go back. When 1,2-dibromopropane (B) is treated with alcoholic KOH, perhaps the product is not an alkene but another di-substituted compound. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a different structure.

Wait, another possibility: When 1,2-dibromopropane reacts with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it might undergo dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne. Wait, that's possible. Wait, usually, elimination of two HX molecules from a dihalide can form an alkyne. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, eliminating two HBr would form propyne (CH≡CCH2Br?), no, wait, elimination would form an alkyne. Wait, eliminating two HBr from 1,2-dibromopropane would form propyne, which is CH≡CCH3. So D would be propyne.

Wait, no. Let me think. The structure of 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, the structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3. Wait, no, that's not correct. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, giving CH2BrCHBrCH3. So 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When treated with alcoholic KOH, the base could abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr. Wait, but for elimination to form an alkyne, two eliminations are needed, each eliminating one HBr. So first elimination would form an alkene, and the second elimination would form an alkyne.

Wait, perhaps the base is strong enough to cause a double elimination. So first, B (1,2-dibromopropane) would lose HBr to form a vinyl bromide, and then another HBr loss would form the alkyne.

Wait, for example, first elimination: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3 → CH2=CH-CH2Br (but wait, that's mono-elimination). Then, the CH2=CH-CH2Br could undergo another elimination, but that would require a strong base. Alternatively, maybe the first elimination forms an alkene, and the second elimination forms an alkyne.

Alternatively, maybe the base is strong enough to cause a single elimination, forming an alkene, but I'm not certain. This part is getting a bit tricky. Let me try to look for another approach.

Another approach: Let's consider the entire reaction sequence and see what each product could be.

A → B → C → D → E → F → G → H.

After A (C3H6) is brominated, B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

C is formed by B + alcoholic KOH. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, then C could be propene (if elimination forms an alkene) or cyclopropane (if it's a double elimination). Alternatively, if it's a single elimination, C is propene again. But then D would be formed from propene passed through a red-hot iron tube. If D is acetylene, then E would be formed from acetylene reacting with two strong acids, perhaps H2SO4 and HNO3. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, if D is acetylene, then reacting with two strong acids (maybe concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3) could lead to some kind of substitution. Alternatively, maybe D is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydration of the alkyne to form a ketone.

Wait, another thought: If D is acetylene, then E could be formed by some acid-catalyzed reaction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction sequence is more about adding functional groups. Let me think about each step again.

A: C3H6 → propene.

B: bromination → 1,2-dibromopropane.

C: B reacts with alcoholic KOH → elimination → forms cyclopropane.

D: cyclopropane passed through red-hot iron → maybe decomposition to form something else. Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne. Wait, but cyclopropane doesn't have halides.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to move forward.

If D is propyne (CH≡CCH3), then E would be formed by reacting with two strong acids. Wait, maybe the mixture is H2SO4 and HNO3, which is a nitrating agent. But I don't think propyne would undergo nitration easily. Alternatively, maybe D is benzene, but that doesn't fit the earlier steps.

Alternatively, perhaps D is benzene. Wait, but how would cyclopropane form benzene? That doesn't seem to make sense. So perhaps I'm wrong in assuming that C is cyclopropane.

Let me try another approach: perhaps the reaction sequence is about the formation of benzyne or something else. But that seems unrelated.

Alternatively, perhaps D is acetylene. Then, E would be formed by some reaction with two strong acids. Alternatively, maybe D is acetylene, which reacts with H2SO4 and HNO3 to form something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction sequence is leading towards the formation of a benzene ring. Let me think: If D is benzene, then E would be formed via nitration, introducing a nitro group. But how would benzene form in this sequence?

Wait, another possibility: If C is propene, and D is formed by dehydrogenation to form acetylene. Then E could be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the final steps to find clues.

Compound E reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. Two strong acids could be H2SO4 and HNO3, used for nitration. So E might have a benzene ring with a substituent that can undergo nitration. Then, when E reacts with iron and HCl, it forms F. Iron and HCl can reduce nitro groups to amines. So if E is nitrotoluene, then F would be toluene amine, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps E is benzene with a nitro group, and F is aniline.

Then, F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Nitrous acid typically converts primary amines to diazonium salts, which can then undergo various reactions. If F is aniline, then G would be the diazonium chloride, which upon heating would decompose to form a compound H, perhaps a phenol.

Wait, but let me try to make this fit.

If H is a phenol, then option B says H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. Phenols can form complexes with ferric ions, giving a yellow or brown color. So option B would be correct if H is phenol.

Let me try to outline the entire sequence with these assumptions.

A: Propene (C3H6).

B: 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3).

C: When B reacts with alcoholic KOH, elimination occurs. If C is cyclopropane, then D is formed by passing through red-hot iron. Wait, but cyclopropane is a ring, so perhaps D is something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is propene again, and D is acetylene.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think of each step and possible products.

1. A → B: Propene + Br2 → 1,2-dibromopropane.

2. B → C: 1,2-dibromopropane + alcoholic KOH → elimination to form cyclopropane.

3. C → D: Cyclopropane passed through red-hot iron. What happens? Maybe it decomposes. Cyclopropane is highly strained and can ring-open under certain conditions. Upon heating, cyclopropane can undergo ring-opening to form alkenes. So D would be propene again. But then, how does D react with two strong acids to form E?

Alternatively, perhaps D is formed by further reaction. Alternatively, maybe D is benzene, but how?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the elimination step. Maybe the product of B is not cyclopropane but another structure.

Wait, another possibility: When 1,2-dibromopropane reacts with alcoholic KOH, perhaps it undergoes substitution instead of elimination. But that's less likely because vicinal dihalides typically undergo elimination in the presence of a strong base.

Alternatively, if the base is not alcoholic but aqueous, perhaps substitution occurs, but the question specifies alcoholic KOH, which promotes elimination.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think about the other steps to see if that helps.

Suppose E is benzene with a nitro group, F is aniline, G is the diazonium salt, which upon reaction with NaOH (H) forms phenol. In that case, H is phenol, which would give a yellow color with ferric chloride. So option B would be correct.

But how would E be benzene with a nitro group? Let's see.

If D is acetylene (propyne, CH≡CCH3), then reacting with H2SO4 and HNO3 (two strong acids) might not form benzene. Alternatively, perhaps D is benzene, but I don't see how.

Wait, maybe D is benzene. How would that happen? Let's see: C is cyclopropane. Then D is formed by passing through red-hot iron. If cyclopropane is heated with iron, maybe it decomposes into ethylene and something else. But that doesn't form benzene. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is toluene. Then, E would be nitrotoluene, F would be toluidine, G would be the diazonium salt, and H would be benzoic acid or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction sequence is leading towards making benzene from cyclopropane. But I'm not sure about the steps involved.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me try to look for the options and see which statement is incorrect.

The options are:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.

B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.

C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.

D) C is a flammable gas.

Let me go through each option.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is aniline, then yes, aniline is used in dye synthesis.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. If H is phenol, then adding ferric chloride would form a complex, giving a yellow color. So this would be correct.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. Let's think about D. If D is acetylene (CH≡CCH3), then the NMR would show two sets of protons: the two CH3 groups? Wait, but in acetylene, the structure is CH≡C-CH3. The protons on the CH3 would be a triplet? Or a singlet? Wait, CH3 in propyne is attached to a carbon that's triple-bonded to another carbon. The CH3 group would have three equivalent protons. So in 1H NMR, that would be a singlet. The other end is CH2, but wait, in propyne, it's CH3-C≡CH. Wait, no, propyne is CH≡C-CH3. So the protons on the CH3 are adjacent to the triple bond. So the NMR would show a singlet for the CH3 group, as all three protons are equivalent and have no neighboring Hs. So D (propyne) would have only one set of protons, which would be a singlet. So option C says D gives two singlets, which would be incorrect. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. If C is cyclopropane, which is a gas but highly flammable. Alternatively, if C is propene, which is also a gas and flammable. So D would be correct.

So if option C is incorrect, because D (propyne) would have only one singlet in NMR, not two.

Wait, but wait. D is propyne (CH≡C-CH3). The CH3 group would be a singlet, but are there any other protons? No, because the other end is a terminal alkyne (HC≡C-). So the structure is CH3-C≡CH. The CH3 group has three Hs, a singlet. The C≡CH end has no Hs attached to that carbon. So the NMR would only show one singlet for the CH3 group. So D (propyne) would have only one singlet. So option C says D gives two singlets, which would be incorrect. Therefore, option C is the incorrect statement.

So the incorrect statement is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The reaction sequence begins with Compound A, identified as propene (C₃H₆), which undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form Compound B, 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH₂CHBrCH₃). When Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, elimination occurs, likely forming cyclopropane (C) as the product. Cyclopropane, being a strained ring, is known to decompose upon heating. When passed through a red-hot iron tube, cyclopropane decomposes to form acetylene (CH≡CCH₃), which is Compound D.

Compound D (acetylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, likely concentrated H₂SO₄ and HNO₃, to form Compound E. This reaction could involve the hydration of acetylene to form a carbonyl compound or another intermediate. Compound E then reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid to form Compound F, which could be a reduced product such as a primary amine. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂) to form Compound G, likely a diazonium salt, and finally reacts with sodium hydroxide to form Compound H, which could be a phenol derivative.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is aniline or a related compound, this statement is correct, as aniline is indeed used in dye synthesis.
2. **Option B**: H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution. If H is a phenol, this statement is correct because phenols form a yellow complex with ferric chloride.
3. **Option C**: D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra. D is acetylene (CH≡CCH₃), which has only one set of protons (the CH₃ group) that appear as a singlet in the NMR spectrum. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.
4. **Option D**: C is a flammable gas. C is cyclopropane, which is a flammable gas. This statement is correct.

### Conclusion:
The incorrect statement is **Option C**, as acetylene (D) does not give two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectrum.

Answer: C

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. Let me take it step by step. The question describes a series of reactions starting from Compound A, which is C3H6, and goes through several reactions to form Compounds B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. Then, I have to determine which statement about the products is incorrect.

First, let me figure out what each compound could be. I know that C3H6 could be either propene or cyclopropane. But considering the reactions, propene is more likely because cyclopropane is less reactive in such reactions. So, Compound A is propene.

The first reaction is bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride. Bromination of alkenes typically adds bromine across the double bond. So propene (CH2=CH2CH3) reacting with Br2 would add a Br across the double bond. So Compound B is probably 1,2-dibromopropane: Br-CH2-CHBr-CH3. Wait, no, wait. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3? Or is it CH2=CHCH3? Oh, yes, propene is CH2=CHCH3. So adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane: BrCH2CH2CH2Br? Wait, no, wait. Wait, when you add Br2 to propene, you get 1,2-dibromopropane as an addition product, right? So B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Next, Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH. Alcoholic KOH usually leads to elimination reactions. So B is 1,2-dibromopropane. Reacting with alcoholic KOH would likely cause an E2 elimination. The Brs are on adjacent carbons, so elimination would lose two Brs and form an alkene again. But wait, which position? 1,2-dibromopropane, when treated with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, would eliminate H and Br to form an alkene. So, the possible product would be propene again, but wait, there might be an issue. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CH2CH2Br) is symmetric, so elimination would form propene either as CH2=CH2CH3 or CH3CH=CH2? Wait, wait, no. Wait, if you have Br on C1 and C2, when you eliminate, you lose H from C3 and Br from C2, or H from C2 and Br from C1? Wait, let me think. The structure is Br-CH2-CH2-Br. Wait no, wait, the initial compound is BrCH2CH2CH2Br? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 across the double bond would give either 1,2-dibromopropane (if the addition is across the double bond) as BrCH2CHBrCH3. So the structure is Br on C1 and C2. So when KOH is added, which dehydrohalogenation occurs.

Elimination of two Brs: from C1 and C2. So the H would be abstracted from C2, and Br from C1, or vice versa? Wait, the structure is Br-CH2-CHBr-CH3. Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me correct. Propene is CH2=CH2CH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, making 1,2-dibromopropane, which is BrCH2CHBrCH3. Wait, that can't be right because the formula for 1,2-dibromopropane would be C3H6Br2. So in that case, when treated with alcoholic KOH, elimination occurs. The possible products would form either 1-propene or 2-propene? Wait, but wait. 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane as BrCH2CHBrCH3? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 in CCl4 would add Br across the double bond, giving CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So the structure is BrCH2CHBrCH3. So when treated with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two HBr molecules. The possible alkenes formed would be either 1-propene (CH2=CHCH3) or 2-propene (CH2CH2CH2Br eliminated? Wait, but wait, elimination would form either 1 or 2 propene. Wait, wait, for 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3), when eliminating, the hydrogen from which carbon?

Wait, in E2 elimination, the H is abstracted from a carbon adjacent to the one from which the leaving group (Br) departs. So in BrCH2CHBrCH3, each Br is on adjacent carbons. Let's imagine the molecule: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. The possible eliminations:

If H is removed from CH2Br (C1) and Br from C2, then the double bond forms between C1 and C2, giving CH2=CH-CH2Br? No, wait, no. Wait, in E2, the H and Br must be anti-periplanar. Let me think about the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination would form either 1-propene or another isomer. Wait, but the di-substituted dibromide can form either 1 or 2 propene. Wait, if the two Brs are on C1 and C2, elimination can form a double bond between C1 and C2 (giving 1-propene, CH2=CHCH3) or between C2 and C3 (giving 2-propene, CH3CH=CH2). But wait, 2-propene is actually CH2=CHCH3 as well, but wait, no. Wait, propene can have the double bond between C1 and C2 (CH2=CHCH3) or between C2 and C3 (CH3CH=CH2). Wait, no, that's not possible because in propane, the carbons are 1, 2, 3. So for 2-propene, it would be CH2CH2CH3, but that's not possible because you can't have a double bond between C2 and C3 in propane. Wait, wait, propane is three carbons, so the double bond can only be between C1 and C2 because C3 is a CH3 group. So elimination of Brs from 1,2-dibromopropane would form 1-propene (CH2=CHCH3) or perhaps 2-propene, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's more likely to form 1-propene.

Wait, perhaps I should reconsider. If the starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3), when treated with alcoholic KOH, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the formation of a double bond. Let's consider the possible positions. The Brs are on C1 and C2. So for elimination, if a Br leaves from C1, the H must come from C2. That would form a double bond between C1 and C2. Alternatively, if the Br leaves from C2, the H could come from C1 or C3. Wait, but C3 has a CH3 group, so perhaps H from C3 is possible. If the H is from C3, elimination of Br from C2 and H from C3 would form a double bond between C2 and C3. But wait, in 1,2-dibromopropane, the structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3.

Wait, no, that can't be. If the structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3, then the carbons are 1 (CH2Br), 2 (CHBr), 3 (CH3). So elimination between C1 and C2 would form CH2=CH-CH3 (but wait, CH2Br and CHBr would eliminate to give CH2=CH, but what about the rest). Alternatively, elimination between C2 and C3 would form CH2-CH=CH3? Wait, but that would require the H to be on C3. So perhaps the major product is 1-propene (CH2=CHCH3) because that's more substituted. Wait, but wait, both possibilities would give the same product, right? Because 1-propene is CH2=CHCH3 and 2-propene is CH3CH=CH2, but in this case, perhaps the structure doesn't allow for 2-propene because the central carbon has two Brs. Hmm, maybe I'm making this more complicated than it is. Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1-propene, so Compound C is propene.

Wait, but wait. When 1,2-dibromopropane is treated with alcoholic KOH, the product is probably 1-propene (CH2=CHCH3). So Compound C is propene again. But wait, this seems like a loop. Let me think again.

Wait, but another possibility is that the elimination leads to a cyclopropane ring. Because when vicinal dihalides ( adjacent dihalides) undergo elimination, sometimes they can form cyclopropane if the dihalide is of a cyclic structure. But in this case, 1,2-dibromopropane is linear, not cyclic, so elimination would form an alkene, not a cyclopropane.

So C is propene.

Next, Compound C is passed through a red-hot iron tube. That's a condition for dehydrohalogenation? Wait, no, when alkenes are passed through red-hot iron, it's usually for the dehydrogenation reaction, which forms an alkynes. Wait, no, that's when you have alkanes. Wait, wait, no, for alkanes, passing through red-hot iron (or catalysts) can cause dehydrogenation to form alkenes. But for alkenes, passing through red-hot iron might be for further dehydrogenation to form alkynes. So propene (C) would react with red-hot iron to form acetylene (D is acetylene, C2H2? Wait, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When dehydrogenated, it would lose H2 and form an alkyne. So CH2=CHCH3 → CH≡CCH3 under such conditions? But wait, wait, the reaction conditions are a bit unclear. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne, but that's not the case.

Wait, another possibility: passing alkenes through red-hot iron can sometimes lead to the formation of aromatic compounds, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrogenation reaction, but that would require H2 and a catalyst. Wait, no, in this case, the iron is red-hot, so perhaps it's a dehydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alkyne. So propene (CH2=CHCH3) upon dehydrogenation would form propyne (CH≡CCH3). But wait, that would require the loss of H2. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the formation of a diene, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is more about breaking the molecule apart. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. When an alkene is passed through a red-hot iron tube, it's a condition for the formation of an alkyne. For example, ethylene (ethene) can be dehydrogenated to acetylene (ethyne). So if C is propene, then D would be propyne (CH≡CCH3). But I'm not entirely confident about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a di-elimination, leading to a different structure. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let me think about the product D. If D is used in the next step to react with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. The two strong acids could be concentrated sulfuric and nitric acid, a mixture used for nitration. Alternatively, maybe it's a different mixture. But wait, if D is an alkyne, reacting with strong acids might not make much sense. Alternatively, perhaps D is benzene, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the steps.

Compound C is formed when B (1,2-dibromopropane) is treated with alcoholic KOH. Wait, another possibility: Could B be 1-bromo-2-methylpropane? No, because propene adding Br2 would add across the double bond, so it's 1,2-dibromopropane.

Wait, but perhaps the reaction between B and alcoholic KOH isn't elimination but substitution. Wait, no, because Br is on adjacent carbons, so elimination is more likely.

Wait, could the product be cyclopropane? Because when vicinal dihalides (adjacent dihalides) are treated with a strong base, sometimes cyclopropane can form via a double elimination. For example, 1,2-dibromopropane could lose two HBr molecules and form cyclopropane. So Compound C would be cyclopropane.

Hmm, that's a possibility. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, and when treated with alcoholic KOH (a strong base), it eliminates two HBr molecules, forming cyclopropane (C is cyclopropane). Then, when cyclopropane is passed through a red-hot iron tube, what happens? Well, cyclopropane is a strained ring and can undergo various reactions. Passing through red-hot iron could cause ring-opening. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrogenation reaction forming an alkyne or another structure.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the ring-opening of cyclopropane. Cyclopropane upon heating can undergo ring-opening to form alkenes. But without specific catalysts, I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let me outline the steps again:

A: C3H6 → propene.

B: Bromination adds Br across double bond → 1,2-dibromopropane.

C: B reacts with alcoholic KOH → elimination → forms cyclopropane.

D: C (cyclopropane) passed through red-hot iron → maybe forms something else.

Wait, if cyclopropane is passed through a red-hot iron tube, perhaps it's a hydrogenation or dehydrogenation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a thermal decomposition. Wait, cyclopropane is known to be unstable upon heating and can decompose into alkenes. But without knowing the exact conditions, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps cyclopropane upon treatment with red-hot iron would undergo some reaction. Wait, perhaps it's a dehydrogenation to form an alkyne. Wait, but cyclopropane has three carbons in a ring, so dehydrogenation would require breaking bonds. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Diels-Alder reaction, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the next steps because maybe that can help.

Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. If D is cyclopropane, what would happen? Alternatively, perhaps D is propyne.

Wait, let me try an alternative approach. Let's assume that when B (1,2-dibromopropane) is treated with alcoholic KOH, the product is cyclopropane. Then, when cyclopropane is treated with red-hot iron, maybe it's heated, causing ring-opening. Cyclopropane upon heating can ring-open to form propene or another alkene. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the heated cyclopropane doesn't change, and D is still cyclopropane. Then, D reacts with two strong acids. Let's say the two strong acids are H2SO4 and HNO3, a common mixture for nitration. Cyclopropane isn't typically nitrated because it's not aromatic, but maybe under certain conditions, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps D is something else.

Wait, maybe I'm making a wrong assumption about Compound C. Let me go back. When 1,2-dibromopropane (B) is treated with alcoholic KOH, perhaps the product is not an alkene but another di-substituted compound. Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a different structure.

Wait, another possibility: When 1,2-dibromopropane reacts with a strong base like alcoholic KOH, it might undergo dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne. Wait, that's possible. Wait, usually, elimination of two HX molecules from a dihalide can form an alkyne. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, eliminating two HBr would form propyne (CH≡CCH2Br?), no, wait, elimination would form an alkyne. Wait, eliminating two HBr from 1,2-dibromopropane would form propyne, which is CH≡CCH3. So D would be propyne.

Wait, no. Let me think. The structure of 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2BrCH2BrCH3? No, wait, the structure is CH2BrCHBrCH3. Wait, no, that's not correct. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would add across the double bond, giving CH2BrCHBrCH3. So 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. When treated with alcoholic KOH, the base could abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to elimination of HBr. Wait, but for elimination to form an alkyne, two eliminations are needed, each eliminating one HBr. So first elimination would form an alkene, and the second elimination would form an alkyne.

Wait, perhaps the base is strong enough to cause a double elimination. So first, B (1,2-dibromopropane) would lose HBr to form a vinyl bromide, and then another HBr loss would form the alkyne.

Wait, for example, first elimination: CH2Br-CHBr-CH3 → CH2=CH-CH2Br (but wait, that's mono-elimination). Then, the CH2=CH-CH2Br could undergo another elimination, but that would require a strong base. Alternatively, maybe the first elimination forms an alkene, and the second elimination forms an alkyne.

Alternatively, maybe the base is strong enough to cause a single elimination, forming an alkene, but I'm not certain. This part is getting a bit tricky. Let me try to look for another approach.

Another approach: Let's consider the entire reaction sequence and see what each product could be.

A → B → C → D → E → F → G → H.

After A (C3H6) is brominated, B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

C is formed by B + alcoholic KOH. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, then C could be propene (if elimination forms an alkene) or cyclopropane (if it's a double elimination). Alternatively, if it's a single elimination, C is propene again. But then D would be formed from propene passed through a red-hot iron tube. If D is acetylene, then E would be formed from acetylene reacting with two strong acids, perhaps H2SO4 and HNO3. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, if D is acetylene, then reacting with two strong acids (maybe concentrated H2SO4 and HNO3) could lead to some kind of substitution. Alternatively, maybe D is something else. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a hydration of the alkyne to form a ketone.

Wait, another thought: If D is acetylene, then E could be formed by some acid-catalyzed reaction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction sequence is more about adding functional groups. Let me think about each step again.

A: C3H6 → propene.

B: bromination → 1,2-dibromopropane.

C: B reacts with alcoholic KOH → elimination → forms cyclopropane.

D: cyclopropane passed through red-hot iron → maybe decomposition to form something else. Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne. Wait, but cyclopropane doesn't have halides.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to move forward.

If D is propyne (CH≡CCH3), then E would be formed by reacting with two strong acids. Wait, maybe the mixture is H2SO4 and HNO3, which is a nitrating agent. But I don't think propyne would undergo nitration easily. Alternatively, maybe D is benzene, but that doesn't fit the earlier steps.

Alternatively, perhaps D is benzene. Wait, but how would cyclopropane form benzene? That doesn't seem to make sense. So perhaps I'm wrong in assuming that C is cyclopropane.

Let me try another approach: perhaps the reaction sequence is about the formation of benzyne or something else. But that seems unrelated.

Alternatively, perhaps D is acetylene. Then, E would be formed by some reaction with two strong acids. Alternatively, maybe D is acetylene, which reacts with H2SO4 and HNO3 to form something else. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction sequence is leading towards the formation of a benzene ring. Let me think: If D is benzene, then E would be formed via nitration, introducing a nitro group. But how would benzene form in this sequence?

Wait, another possibility: If C is propene, and D is formed by dehydrogenation to form acetylene. Then E could be something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look at the final steps to find clues.

Compound E reacts with a mixture of two strong acids. Two strong acids could be H2SO4 and HNO3, used for nitration. So E might have a benzene ring with a substituent that can undergo nitration. Then, when E reacts with iron and HCl, it forms F. Iron and HCl can reduce nitro groups to amines. So if E is nitrotoluene, then F would be toluene amine, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps E is benzene with a nitro group, and F is aniline.

Then, F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO2) to form G. Nitrous acid typically converts primary amines to diazonium salts, which can then undergo various reactions. If F is aniline, then G would be the diazonium chloride, which upon heating would decompose to form a compound H, perhaps a phenol.

Wait, but let me try to make this fit.

If H is a phenol, then option B says H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. Phenols can form complexes with ferric ions, giving a yellow or brown color. So option B would be correct if H is phenol.

Let me try to outline the entire sequence with these assumptions.

A: Propene (C3H6).

B: 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH2CHBrCH3).

C: When B reacts with alcoholic KOH, elimination occurs. If C is cyclopropane, then D is formed by passing through red-hot iron. Wait, but cyclopropane is a ring, so perhaps D is something else. Alternatively, perhaps C is propene again, and D is acetylene.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me think of each step and possible products.

1. A → B: Propene + Br2 → 1,2-dibromopropane.

2. B → C: 1,2-dibromopropane + alcoholic KOH → elimination to form cyclopropane.

3. C → D: Cyclopropane passed through red-hot iron. What happens? Maybe it decomposes. Cyclopropane is highly strained and can ring-open under certain conditions. Upon heating, cyclopropane can undergo ring-opening to form alkenes. So D would be propene again. But then, how does D react with two strong acids to form E?

Alternatively, perhaps D is formed by further reaction. Alternatively, maybe D is benzene, but how?

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the elimination step. Maybe the product of B is not cyclopropane but another structure.

Wait, another possibility: When 1,2-dibromopropane reacts with alcoholic KOH, perhaps it undergoes substitution instead of elimination. But that's less likely because vicinal dihalides typically undergo elimination in the presence of a strong base.

Alternatively, if the base is not alcoholic but aqueous, perhaps substitution occurs, but the question specifies alcoholic KOH, which promotes elimination.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to think about the other steps to see if that helps.

Suppose E is benzene with a nitro group, F is aniline, G is the diazonium salt, which upon reaction with NaOH (H) forms phenol. In that case, H is phenol, which would give a yellow color with ferric chloride. So option B would be correct.

But how would E be benzene with a nitro group? Let's see.

If D is acetylene (propyne, CH≡CCH3), then reacting with H2SO4 and HNO3 (two strong acids) might not form benzene. Alternatively, perhaps D is benzene, but I don't see how.

Wait, maybe D is benzene. How would that happen? Let's see: C is cyclopropane. Then D is formed by passing through red-hot iron. If cyclopropane is heated with iron, maybe it decomposes into ethylene and something else. But that doesn't form benzene. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps D is toluene. Then, E would be nitrotoluene, F would be toluidine, G would be the diazonium salt, and H would be benzoic acid or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction sequence is leading towards making benzene from cyclopropane. But I'm not sure about the steps involved.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me try to look for the options and see which statement is incorrect.

The options are:

A) F is used for the synthesis of dyes.

B) H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.

C) D gives two singlets in the 1H NMR spectra.

D) C is a flammable gas.

Let me go through each option.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is aniline, then yes, aniline is used in dye synthesis.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. If H is phenol, then adding ferric chloride would form a complex, giving a yellow color. So this would be correct.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. Let's think about D. If D is acetylene (CH≡CCH3), then the NMR would show two sets of protons: the two CH3 groups? Wait, but in acetylene, the structure is CH≡C-CH3. The protons on the CH3 would be a triplet? Or a singlet? Wait, CH3 in propyne is attached to a carbon that's triple-bonded to another carbon. The CH3 group would have three equivalent protons. So in 1H NMR, that would be a singlet. The other end is CH2, but wait, in propyne, it's CH3-C≡CH. Wait, no, propyne is CH≡C-CH3. So the protons on the CH3 are adjacent to the triple bond. So the NMR would show a singlet for the CH3 group, as all three protons are equivalent and have no neighboring Hs. So D (propyne) would have only one set of protons, which would be a singlet. So option C says D gives two singlets, which would be incorrect. So option C is incorrect.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. If C is cyclopropane, which is a gas but highly flammable. Alternatively, if C is propene, which is also a gas and flammable. So D would be correct.

So if option C is incorrect, because D (propyne) would have only one singlet in NMR, not two.

Wait, but wait. D is propyne (CH≡C-CH3). The CH3 group would be a singlet, but are there any other protons? No, because the other end is a terminal alkyne (HC≡C-). So the structure is CH3-C≡CH. The CH3 group has three Hs, a singlet. The C≡CH end has no Hs attached to that carbon. So the NMR would only show one singlet for the CH3 group. So D (propyne) would have only one singlet. So option C says D gives two singlets, which would be incorrect. Therefore, option C is the incorrect statement.

So the incorrect statement is option C.


The reaction sequence begins with Compound A, identified as propene (C₃H₆), which undergoes bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride to form Compound B, 1,2-dibromopropane (BrCH₂CHBrCH₃). When Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, elimination occurs, likely forming cyclopropane (C) as the product. Cyclopropane, being a strained ring, is known to decompose upon heating. When passed through a red-hot iron tube, cyclopropane decomposes to form acetylene (CH≡CCH₃), which is Compound D.

Compound D (acetylene) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, likely concentrated H₂SO₄ and HNO₃, to form Compound E. This reaction could involve the hydration of acetylene to form a carbonyl compound or another intermediate. Compound E then reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid to form Compound F, which could be a reduced product such as a primary amine. Compound F reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂) to form Compound G, likely a diazonium salt, and finally reacts with sodium hydroxide to form Compound H, which could be a phenol derivative.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is aniline or a related compound, this statement is correct, as aniline is indeed used in dye synthesis.
2. **Option B**: H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution. If H is a phenol, this statement is correct because phenols form a yellow complex with ferric chloride.
3. **Option C**: D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra. D is acetylene (CH≡CCH₃), which has only one set of protons (the CH₃ group) that appear as a singlet in the NMR spectrum. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.
4. **Option D**: C is a flammable gas. C is cyclopropane, which is a flammable gas. This statement is correct.

### Conclusion:
The incorrect statement is **Option C**, as acetylene (D) does not give two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectrum.

Answer: C
