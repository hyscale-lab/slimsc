Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The problem is a sequence of reactions starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. Let's break it down.

So, first, A undergoes bromination in CCl4 to form B. I remember that bromination of alkenes usually adds bromine across the double bond. Since A is C3H6, that's either propene or cyclopropane. Wait, wait. C3H6 could be propene (which is an alkene) or cyclopropane (a cycloalkane). But bromination in CCl4 is typically an addition reaction, so maybe A is propene. Propene would brominate to form 1,2-dibromopropane. But wait, maybe it's cyclopropane? If A is cyclopropane, bromination with Br2 in CCl4 would add across a ring, leading to ring opening. Hmm, but cyclopropane is more strained, so maybe it's more reactive. Alternatively, if A is propene, the bromination would be an addition reaction.

Next, B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C. Alcoholic KOH is a base and a good condition for elimination. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, then treating with KOH would likely cause elimination, removing two HBr molecules and forming an alkene. So C would be propene again? Wait, but that's the same as A. Or maybe a different position. Alternatively, if B is 1-bromopropane, then elimination would form propene, but wait, initial bromination would depend on the structure.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Compound A is C3H6. If it's propene, then bromination in CCl4 would add Br2, making 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, it would undergo dehydrohalogenation, eliminating HBr. So it would form propene again. But that can't be right because the product would be the same as the starting material. Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is cyclopropane. So cyclopropane plus Br2 in CCl4 would add across the ring, opening it to form 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, elimination would form propene (since removing H and Br from adjacent carbons would form a double bond). So C is propene.

Wait, but wait. If A is cyclopropane, then bromination would add Br to each adjacent carbon, leading to 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, elimination with alcoholic KOH would form propene (since two adjacent Brs would eliminate). So C is propene.

Then, compound C passes through a red-hot iron tube to form D. Red-hot iron is a catalyst for dehydrogenation. So propene would undergo dehydrogenation, losing hydrogen gas and forming propyne (which is HC≡CCH3). Wait, no, wait. Propyne is CH≡C-CH3. Alternatively, propene (CH2=CH2CH3) when dehydrogenated with iron would form propyne or maybe something else. Wait, wait. Wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When you dehydrogenate that, you take away two Hs to form a triple bond. So CH≡CCH3, which is propyne. So D is propyne.

Next, D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Hmm. Propyne is an alkyne. Reacting with two strong acids... Oh, maybe H2SO4 and HgSO4 in a hydration reaction. Or maybe something else. Oh wait, another possibility: oxymercuration? Or perhaps the acid is H2SO4 and another acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydration. So propyne (HC≡CCH3) would react with acid to form ketone. Wait, yes. Hydration of alkynes can form ketones if excess acid is used. Wait, but maybe it's H2SO4 and another acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's oxymercuration, but that uses Hg(OAc)2 and water, with acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a two-step process? Wait, the question says a mixture of two strong acids. Hmm. Let me think. Another possibility is that compound D is propyne, which upon treatment with strong acids like H2SO4 and H2SO4 again? Or perhaps it's a dihydroxylation. Wait, but that's for alkenes. Wait, no. Wait, propyne is an alkyne, so perhaps the strong acids are H2SO4 and HgSO4, leading to hydration. So propyne would add water in acid conditions to form propan-2-one (acetone). So E is acetone.

Then, compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms F. Iron and HCl: perhaps a reducing environment. Acetone (propan-2-one) reacting with HCl and Fe. Hmm, that sounds like a condition for a pinacol rearrangement, but that's more about diols. Alternatively, maybe it's a Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn-Hg and HCl, but the question says iron scrap and HCl. Wait, I'm not too sure. Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes. So if E is acetone, then F would be propane (CH3CH2CH3).

Wait, no. Clemmensen would reduce the ketone to a methylene group. Wait, acetone is (CH3)2CO. Clemmensen would reduce the carbonyl to CH2, so (CH3)2CH2? No, that's not right. Wait, no. Clemmensen is for ketones. It converts ketones to alkanes. So (CH3)2CO → (CH3)2CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, acetone has (CH3)2CO. Clemmensen would reduce the carbonyl to CH2, so it becomes (CH3)2CH2, but that's actually propane. Wait, but (CH3)2CH2 is propane (CH3CH2CH3). So F would be propane.

Then, F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Propane (CH3CH2CH3) reacting with nitrous acid. Nitrous acid typically reacts with alcohols (like in the formation of diazo compounds), but with alkanes, I'm not sure. Wait, but wait, propane is an alkane. Nitrous acid is HNO2. I don't think alkanes react with nitrous acid under normal conditions. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the previous steps.

Alternative approach: Maybe when E is acetone, reacting with Fe and HCl is a different reaction. Oh! Maybe it's the Gattermann–Koch reaction? No, that's for arenes. Alternatively, maybe the conditions are for a Birch reduction. Wait, Birch reduction is for arenes, but the E is a ketone. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different kind of reduction. Maybe it's a hydrogenation? But with Fe and HCl, that doesn't sound like it. Alternatively, perhaps E is acetone, and when treated with HCl and Fe, it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but acetone is not an alkyl halide. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps E is being subjected to some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction. Oh wait, maybe it's a Aldol reaction, but that's between carbonyl compounds. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the conditions are for the reduction of ketones. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, but if it's Fe and HCl, perhaps it's a different catalyst. Alternatively, maybe it's a Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction. Wait, maybe the product F is not propane. Let me think again. Let's go back.

Compound E is formed from D, which is propyne. D (propyne) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. What else could that be? Wait, maybe D is propyne. If we treat an alkyne with strong acid, perhaps it undergoes hydration. Wait, but that would produce a ketone, which is what I thought before. So E is acetone.

Then, E (acetone) reacts with Fe and HCl. Oh wait! Maybe it's the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen typically uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, but perhaps Fe and HCl can act similarly? Or perhaps it's a different reducing agent. Wait, maybe it's the sodium in liquid NH3? No, that's for amide reductions. Wait, maybe it's a radical reaction? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier steps.

Wait, if E is acetone, F could be propane. Then, F is propane, which reacts with nitrous acid. Nitrous acid usually doesn't react with alkanes. So maybe that's not possible. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me check the previous steps again. Let's re-examine from the beginning.

1. Compound A: C3H6 is either propene or cyclopropane.

Bromination in CCl4: if A is propene, then the addition of Br2 would form 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, reaction with alcoholic KOH would eliminate to form propene again. So C is propene. Then, passing through red-hot iron leads to dehydrogenation, forming propyne. So D is propyne.

D reacts with two strong acids: perhaps H2SO4 and another acid, leading to hydration to form acetone (E is acetone).

E (acetone) with Fe and HCl: maybe it's a reduction. Wait, if it's acetone and you use a reducing agent, you would get propane. So F is propane.

F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. Hmm, but I don't think that's possible. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier.

Alternative approach: Maybe when D is propyne, reacting with a mixture of two strong acids doesn't form a ketone but something else. Let's think about other reactions. Propyne (HC≡CCH3) could undergo hydrohalogenation, but that would add H and Br. Wait, but the question says two strong acids, which could be H2SO4 and something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydration to form ketone, which I thought earlier.

But then F is propane, which doesn't react with nitrous acid. So maybe I messed up some steps.

Alternatively, perhaps when E is acetone, the reaction with Fe and HCl isn't a reduction but something else. Wait, another possibility: maybe E is acetone, and when treated with HCl and Fe, it undergoes some kind of substitution. But I don't recall acetone reacting with HCl and Fe. Alternatively, maybe it's a Grignard-type reaction, but I don't think so.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction of D to E. Let me think again. D is propyne (HC≡CCH3). Reacting with two strong acids: perhaps it's H2SO4 and another acid, but maybe it's a dihydroxylation. Wait, but that's for alkenes. Oh wait, no, for alkynes, maybe it's a hydration. So H2SO4 and HgSO4 as catalysts? Yes, that's the typical condition for adding water across a triple bond. So propyne would become propan-2-ol (CH3C(OH)CH3). Wait, no. Wait, the hydration of propyne would form either prop-1-en-2-ol if it's an acid-catalyzed hydration, or perhaps acetone if it's a ketone. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, the hydration of propyne (HC≡CCH3) with H2SO4 and HgSO4 would add water across the triple bond, leading to the formation of an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. So the product would be acetone. So E is acetone.

Hmm, so back to E. So E is acetone. Then, compound E reacts with Fe and HCl to form F. I'm stuck on this part. Let me think about possible reactions of acetone with Fe and HCl.

Wait, I remember the Clemmensen reduction uses HCl and Zn(Hg) to reduce ketones to alkanes. So if E is acetone, F would be propane (CH3CH2CH3). So F is propane.

Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid to form G. But I don't think propane reacts with nitrous acid. Nitrous acid usually reacts with alcohols, amines, or aromatic compounds. So perhaps this step is incorrect, implying that maybe there was a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in step D to E. Let me think: D is propyne. Upon reacting with two strong acids, perhaps it's a hydration to form 2-propanol instead of acetone. So if D is propyne (HC≡CCH3), then acid-catalyzed hydration would form (CH3)2CHOH (2-propanol).

Wait, but that would make E as 2-propanol. Then, E reacts with Fe and HCl. So 2-propanol (CH3CH(OH)CH3) with Fe and HCl. Hmm, perhaps it's a oxidation? Or maybe it's a substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that requires a strong base and heat. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol rearrangement, which requires a base. Hmm.

Wait, 2-propanol with HCl would maybe form some chlorinated compound, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Gattermann reaction, but that's for benzaldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydration to form propene. Using HCl and Fe, perhaps. So 2-propanol (E) → with Fe and HCl, perhaps dehydrated to form propene (C is propene again). Then F would be propene.

But then, propene reacts with nitrous acid. Hmm. Wait, propene plus nitrous acid could lead to formation of a diazo compound, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, propene might not react with nitrous acid under these conditions. So perhaps this is another dead end.

I'm getting stuck here, so maybe I should proceed to the next step and see.

If F is propane, then with nitrous acid, perhaps it doesn't react. So G might not form, which suggests that perhaps the previous steps are incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in compound C. Let's re-examine. When A is C3H6 (propene), bromination would add Br to form 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, it would eliminate. But which product would that form? If you have 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination would form either 1-propene or 2-propene. Wait, wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane as CH2BrCHBrCH3. So when treated with alcoholic KOH, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr and forming a double bond. But in this case, where would the double bond form? Since the Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form either 1-propene or 2-propene. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCH2BrCH3?), no, wait, no. Wait, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 (in CCl4) would add across the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane as CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So when treated with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two HBr molecules to form either 1-propene or 2-propene. Wait, but the structure would be CH2BrCHBrCH3. Eliminating HBr from the two adjacent Brs would form CH2=CHCH3 (propene) or is it another structure? Wait, wait, no. When you have Br on C1 and C2, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, giving CH2=CHCH3 (propene). So C is propene again. So the same as A.

Then, passing through red hot iron gives D, which is propyne. So D is propyne (HC≡CCH3).

Then, D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids to form E. As before, E is acetone.

Then, E (acetone) with Fe and HCl forms F. Perhaps F is propane.

Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. Hmm. I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction that forms F. Let me think again. Maybe when E is acetone, the reaction with Fe and HCl isn't a reduction but something else. Maybe it's a Grignard reaction, but without a Mg, that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a halogenation. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the conditions are for the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that's for ketones to form lactones or ketones, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, another thought: When E is acetone and reacts with Fe and HCl, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. But acetone is (CH3)2CO; I don't see an obvious leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a condensation reaction, but with what?

Maybe I'm going down the wrong path. Let me try to proceed and see what the options are.

The options are statements about the products. Let's look at each option and see which one is incorrect.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes.

F is the product after E (acetone) reacts with Fe and HCl. I thought F was propane, which is an alkane. But propane doesn't seem to be used for dye synthesis. Alternatively, if F is something else, like propene, then propene is used in various reactions but not directly for dye synthesis. Alternatively, if F is a different compound, like acetone, which is used in some dyes, but I'm not sure.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.

H is the product when G reacts with sodium hydroxide. Let me think about G. G is the product of F reacting with nitrous acid. If F is propane, which doesn't react, then G would be the same as F, which can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps F isn't propane. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: Let me list all the compounds step by step, assuming A is cyclopropane.

A: cyclopropane (C3H6).

Bromination in CCl4: cyclopropane would react with Br2 to form 1,2-dibromocyclopropane? Or would it open the ring? Alternatively, cyclopropane is highly strained, so adding Br2 would open the ring. So perhaps A is cyclopropane, and upon bromination, it forms 1,2-dibromopropane (same as if A were propene). Then, B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, reaction with alcoholic KOH would eliminate to form propene (C is propene).

Then, D is propyne after passing through red hot iron.

E is acetone after hydration.

F is propane after reduction.

Then, F is propane, which doesn't react with nitrous acid. So G would be the same as F, which is propane. Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H. But H is just propane and NaOH wouldn't react. So this can't be right.

Hmm. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me go back.

Alternative approach: Maybe the initial compound A is propene, and upon bromination, it's 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, elimination gives back propene. Then, D is propyne. E is acetone. F is propane. Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. Since that doesn't make sense, perhaps F is not propane. So perhaps I'm wrong about step E to F.

Alternatively, perhaps E is 2-propanol. Let me think again. If D is propyne, and E is formed via a different reaction. Let's say D reacts with H2SO4 and another acid, like H2O, in a hydration to form 2-propanol. Then E is 2-propanol.

Then, E (2-propanol) reacts with Fe and HCl. Hmm. 2-propanol with Fe and HCl: maybe it's a substitution reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's an oxidation. Wait, but oxidation of 2-propanol would form acetone, which is E again. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps E is 2-propanol, and with Fe and HCl, it undergoes some elimination. 2-propanol with HCl and heat could form chloropropane, but I'm not sure about the role of Fe here. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydration, producing propene. So F would be propene.

Then, F (propene) reacts with nitrous acid. Hmm, propene with HNO2. I don't think that's a standard reaction. But perhaps it's a dihydroxylation, but that's for alkenes. Alternatively, perhaps it's an addition reaction. Wait, maybe it's a hydroxylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitrosation. Alternatively, I'm not sure. Let's say it forms some compound G.

Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H. Let's say G is a diol or something else that reacts with NaOH.

But I'm not getting much progress here.

Let me look at the options again.

Option D says that C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas at room temperature and is flammable. So D's statement is correct.

Option C says D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. D is propyne (CH≡CCH3). The structure is CH3-C≡C-H. The protons on the triple bond would be a singlet, and the CH3 would be a singlet as well. So in 1H NMR, the CH3 would be a singlet at around δ 1.2 ppm, and the H on the triple bond would be a singlet at δ 2.5 ppm. So two singlets. So option C is correct.

Option B says H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. Ferric chloride is used for testing phenols, which give a red-brown precipitate. So if H is phenol, then it would form a precipitate. Alternatively, if H is something else with a benzene ring, it could show color. But in our sequence, I don't see any benzene rings being formed. So perhaps H isn't a phenol. Hmm.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, which isn't used for dyes. Alternatively, if F is something else, like propene, which is a monomer for polymers, but not directly for dyes. Wait, but maybe if F is acetone, which is used in some dye synthesis steps. So if F is acetone, then A would be correct. But earlier steps lead me to think F is propane.

But perhaps I'm wrong about F. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps when E is acetone, the reaction with Fe and HCl is not a reduction but something else. Wait, maybe it's a Birch reduction, but that's for arenes. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution. Alternatively, perhaps F is acetone itself, which could be used in dye synthesis. But that doesn't make sense because the reaction is supposed to produce F from E.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction with Fe and HCl isn't a reduction but a Grignard reaction, but without Mg, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about the reduction. Let me think: acetone (E) reacts with Fe and HCl. Another possibility: could it be a benzoin condensation? No, that's for aldehydes. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where the carbonyl becomes something else.

Alternatively, maybe E is not acetone. Let me think again. If D is propyne, and E is formed by another reaction. For example, if D is propyne and reacts with H2SO4 and another strong acid, perhaps it's a dihydroxylation. Wait, but dihydroxylation is for alkenes. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps D is propyne and is treated with a mixture of HNO3 and H2SO4, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D reacts with two strong acids to form a different product. Maybe it's a hydration to form 2-propanol. So E is 2-propanol (CH3CH(OH)CH3).

Then, E reacts with Fe and HCl. Hmm. 2-propanol with Fe and HCl: perhaps it's a substitution. If so, the OH could be replaced by Cl, forming CH3CHClCH3. So F would be chloropropane.

Then, F (chloropropane) reacts with nitrous acid. Nitrous acid typically doesn't react with alkyl halides. So perhaps that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe F is chloropropane, which doesn't react with nitrous acid. So G would be the same as F, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think about each option again.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. Possible only if F is something like benzaldehyde or another compound used in dyes. But according to my earlier steps, F is propane, which doesn't fit. So option A would be incorrect if F is propane.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. H would be the product of G reacting with NaOH. If G is a diol, then H would be something else. But without knowing G, it's hard to say.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. D is propyne, which as I thought earlier, gives two singlets. So C is correct.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas and flammable. So D is correct.

So the incorrect statement would be the one that's false. Let's see.

If F is propane, then option A says F is used for dye synthesis, which would be incorrect.

Alternatively, if F is something else, like chloropropane, then option A would still be incorrect because chloropropane isn't used for dye synthesis.

So the incorrect statement is option A.

But wait, another possibility: if F is acetone, then option A would be correct because acetone is sometimes used in organic synthesis, including dyes. But in that case, how would F be acetone? Because E is acetone, and F is formed from E. So you'd need E → F to be the same, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake and F is something else. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps F is formed via a different reaction. Maybe E is acetone, and with Fe and HCl, it undergoes a substitution, forming something like CH3CHClCH3. But I'm not sure about that.

If F is chloroform (CHCl3), then it's a possible reagent in some dye syntheses. But I don't see how E would form that.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options again.

The question asks for the incorrect statement about the products. So, if all the statements are correct except one.

I think option A is incorrect because F as propane isn't used in dye synthesis. Alternatively, option B is incorrect if H isn't a phenol.

Wait, but where would a phenol come into play? Let me think about the steps again.

If H is the product of G and NaOH, and G is from F reacting with nitrous acid, which is a reaction I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, maybe G is an amine, but I don't see how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps, and H is a phenol, making option B correct. But I don't see any step that introduces a benzene ring or a hydroxyl group attached to an aromatic ring.

So, based on the steps, I think the incorrect statement is option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. Because F is propane, which isn't used for that.

The reaction sequence begins with compound A (C₃H₆), which is either propene or cyclopropane. Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) suggests an addition reaction. If A is propene, bromination would yield 1,2-dibromopropane. If A is cyclopropane, bromination would open the ring to form 1,2-dibromopropane as well. Thus, compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, a strong base, leading to elimination of two HBr molecules and the formation of propene (C). This makes compound C propene, which is a flammable gas. When propene passes through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes dehydrogenation to form propyne (HC≡CCH₃), making compound D propyne.

Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, likely undergoing hydration to form acetone (CH₃COCH₃), making compound E acetone. Acetone then reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (HCl). This resembles the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Thus, compound F is propane (CH₃CH₂CH₃).

Propane reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂), but there is no standard reaction between alkanes and nitrous acid. This step is unclear, but assuming no reaction occurs, compound G would remain propane. Finally, compound G reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), but propane does not react with NaOH, leaving compound H as propane.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, this statement is incorrect because propane is not used for dye synthesis. Propane is an alkane used primarily as a fuel or chemical feedstock.
- **Option B**: H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution. Ferric chloride reacts with phenols to form a red-brown precipitate, but no phenol is formed in the sequence. Thus, this statement is incorrect.
- **Option C**: D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra. D is propyne (HC≡CCH₃), which has two types of protons: the CH₃ group (singlet at δ ~1.2 ppm) and the terminal H (singlet at δ ~2.5 ppm). This statement is correct.
- **Option D**: C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a flammable gas. This statement is correct.

The incorrect statements are **A** and **B**, but since only one must be chosen, **A** is the best answer because F (propane) is explicitly not used for dye synthesis.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again.

The problem is a sequence of reactions starting with Compound A, which is C3H6. Let's break it down.

So, first, A undergoes bromination in CCl4 to form B. I remember that bromination of alkenes usually adds bromine across the double bond. Since A is C3H6, that's either propene or cyclopropane. Wait, wait. C3H6 could be propene (which is an alkene) or cyclopropane (a cycloalkane). But bromination in CCl4 is typically an addition reaction, so maybe A is propene. Propene would brominate to form 1,2-dibromopropane. But wait, maybe it's cyclopropane? If A is cyclopropane, bromination with Br2 in CCl4 would add across a ring, leading to ring opening. Hmm, but cyclopropane is more strained, so maybe it's more reactive. Alternatively, if A is propene, the bromination would be an addition reaction.

Next, B reacts with alcoholic KOH to form C. Alcoholic KOH is a base and a good condition for elimination. So if B is 1,2-dibromopropane, then treating with KOH would likely cause elimination, removing two HBr molecules and forming an alkene. So C would be propene again? Wait, but that's the same as A. Or maybe a different position. Alternatively, if B is 1-bromopropane, then elimination would form propene, but wait, initial bromination would depend on the structure.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. Compound A is C3H6. If it's propene, then bromination in CCl4 would add Br2, making 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, it would undergo dehydrohalogenation, eliminating HBr. So it would form propene again. But that can't be right because the product would be the same as the starting material. Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is cyclopropane. So cyclopropane plus Br2 in CCl4 would add across the ring, opening it to form 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, elimination would form propene (since removing H and Br from adjacent carbons would form a double bond). So C is propene.

Wait, but wait. If A is cyclopropane, then bromination would add Br to each adjacent carbon, leading to 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, elimination with alcoholic KOH would form propene (since two adjacent Brs would eliminate). So C is propene.

Then, compound C passes through a red-hot iron tube to form D. Red-hot iron is a catalyst for dehydrogenation. So propene would undergo dehydrogenation, losing hydrogen gas and forming propyne (which is HC≡CCH3). Wait, no, wait. Propyne is CH≡C-CH3. Alternatively, propene (CH2=CH2CH3) when dehydrogenated with iron would form propyne or maybe something else. Wait, wait. Wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? No, wait, propene is CH2=CHCH3. When you dehydrogenate that, you take away two Hs to form a triple bond. So CH≡CCH3, which is propyne. So D is propyne.

Next, D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. Hmm. Propyne is an alkyne. Reacting with two strong acids... Oh, maybe H2SO4 and HgSO4 in a hydration reaction. Or maybe something else. Oh wait, another possibility: oxymercuration? Or perhaps the acid is H2SO4 and another acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydration. So propyne (HC≡CCH3) would react with acid to form ketone. Wait, yes. Hydration of alkynes can form ketones if excess acid is used. Wait, but maybe it's H2SO4 and another acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's oxymercuration, but that uses Hg(OAc)2 and water, with acid. Alternatively, maybe it's a two-step process? Wait, the question says a mixture of two strong acids. Hmm. Let me think. Another possibility is that compound D is propyne, which upon treatment with strong acids like H2SO4 and H2SO4 again? Or perhaps it's a dihydroxylation. Wait, but that's for alkenes. Wait, no. Wait, propyne is an alkyne, so perhaps the strong acids are H2SO4 and HgSO4, leading to hydration. So propyne would add water in acid conditions to form propan-2-one (acetone). So E is acetone.

Then, compound E, in the presence of iron scrap and hydrochloric acid, forms F. Iron and HCl: perhaps a reducing environment. Acetone (propan-2-one) reacting with HCl and Fe. Hmm, that sounds like a condition for a pinacol rearrangement, but that's more about diols. Alternatively, maybe it's a Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen uses Zn-Hg and HCl, but the question says iron scrap and HCl. Wait, I'm not too sure. Clemmensen reduces ketones to alkanes. So if E is acetone, then F would be propane (CH3CH2CH3).

Wait, no. Clemmensen would reduce the ketone to a methylene group. Wait, acetone is (CH3)2CO. Clemmensen would reduce the carbonyl to CH2, so (CH3)2CH2? No, that's not right. Wait, no. Clemmensen is for ketones. It converts ketones to alkanes. So (CH3)2CO → (CH3)2CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, acetone has (CH3)2CO. Clemmensen would reduce the carbonyl to CH2, so it becomes (CH3)2CH2, but that's actually propane. Wait, but (CH3)2CH2 is propane (CH3CH2CH3). So F would be propane.

Then, F reacts with nitrous acid to form G. Propane (CH3CH2CH3) reacting with nitrous acid. Nitrous acid typically reacts with alcohols (like in the formation of diazo compounds), but with alkanes, I'm not sure. Wait, but wait, propane is an alkane. Nitrous acid is HNO2. I don't think alkanes react with nitrous acid under normal conditions. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check the previous steps.

Alternative approach: Maybe when E is acetone, reacting with Fe and HCl is a different reaction. Oh! Maybe it's the Gattermann–Koch reaction? No, that's for arenes. Alternatively, maybe the conditions are for a Birch reduction. Wait, Birch reduction is for arenes, but the E is a ketone. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different kind of reduction. Maybe it's a hydrogenation? But with Fe and HCl, that doesn't sound like it. Alternatively, perhaps E is acetone, and when treated with HCl and Fe, it's a Friedel-Crafts alkylation, but acetone is not an alkyl halide. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a Grignard-like reaction, but I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps E is being subjected to some kind of acid-catalyzed reaction. Oh wait, maybe it's a Aldol reaction, but that's between carbonyl compounds. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the conditions are for the reduction of ketones. Clemmensen uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, but if it's Fe and HCl, perhaps it's a different catalyst. Alternatively, maybe it's a Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction. Wait, maybe the product F is not propane. Let me think again. Let's go back.

Compound E is formed from D, which is propyne. D (propyne) reacts with a mixture of two strong acids to form E. What else could that be? Wait, maybe D is propyne. If we treat an alkyne with strong acid, perhaps it undergoes hydration. Wait, but that would produce a ketone, which is what I thought before. So E is acetone.

Then, E (acetone) reacts with Fe and HCl. Oh wait! Maybe it's the Clemmensen reduction. Clemmensen typically uses Zn(Hg)/HCl, but perhaps Fe and HCl can act similarly? Or perhaps it's a different reducing agent. Wait, maybe it's the sodium in liquid NH3? No, that's for amide reductions. Wait, maybe it's a radical reaction? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier steps.

Wait, if E is acetone, F could be propane. Then, F is propane, which reacts with nitrous acid. Nitrous acid usually doesn't react with alkanes. So maybe that's not possible. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Let me check the previous steps again. Let's re-examine from the beginning.

1. Compound A: C3H6 is either propene or cyclopropane.

Bromination in CCl4: if A is propene, then the addition of Br2 would form 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, reaction with alcoholic KOH would eliminate to form propene again. So C is propene. Then, passing through red-hot iron leads to dehydrogenation, forming propyne. So D is propyne.

D reacts with two strong acids: perhaps H2SO4 and another acid, leading to hydration to form acetone (E is acetone).

E (acetone) with Fe and HCl: maybe it's a reduction. Wait, if it's acetone and you use a reducing agent, you would get propane. So F is propane.

F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. Hmm, but I don't think that's possible. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption earlier.

Alternative approach: Maybe when D is propyne, reacting with a mixture of two strong acids doesn't form a ketone but something else. Let's think about other reactions. Propyne (HC≡CCH3) could undergo hydrohalogenation, but that would add H and Br. Wait, but the question says two strong acids, which could be H2SO4 and something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydration to form ketone, which I thought earlier.

But then F is propane, which doesn't react with nitrous acid. So maybe I messed up some steps.

Alternatively, perhaps when E is acetone, the reaction with Fe and HCl isn't a reduction but something else. Wait, another possibility: maybe E is acetone, and when treated with HCl and Fe, it undergoes some kind of substitution. But I don't recall acetone reacting with HCl and Fe. Alternatively, maybe it's a Grignard-type reaction, but I don't think so.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction of D to E. Let me think again. D is propyne (HC≡CCH3). Reacting with two strong acids: perhaps it's H2SO4 and another acid, but maybe it's a dihydroxylation. Wait, but that's for alkenes. Oh wait, no, for alkynes, maybe it's a hydration. So H2SO4 and HgSO4 as catalysts? Yes, that's the typical condition for adding water across a triple bond. So propyne would become propan-2-ol (CH3C(OH)CH3). Wait, no. Wait, the hydration of propyne would form either prop-1-en-2-ol if it's an acid-catalyzed hydration, or perhaps acetone if it's a ketone. Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, no, the hydration of propyne (HC≡CCH3) with H2SO4 and HgSO4 would add water across the triple bond, leading to the formation of an enol, which then tautomerizes to a ketone. So the product would be acetone. So E is acetone.

Hmm, so back to E. So E is acetone. Then, compound E reacts with Fe and HCl to form F. I'm stuck on this part. Let me think about possible reactions of acetone with Fe and HCl.

Wait, I remember the Clemmensen reduction uses HCl and Zn(Hg) to reduce ketones to alkanes. So if E is acetone, F would be propane (CH3CH2CH3). So F is propane.

Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid to form G. But I don't think propane reacts with nitrous acid. Nitrous acid usually reacts with alcohols, amines, or aromatic compounds. So perhaps this step is incorrect, implying that maybe there was a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in step D to E. Let me think: D is propyne. Upon reacting with two strong acids, perhaps it's a hydration to form 2-propanol instead of acetone. So if D is propyne (HC≡CCH3), then acid-catalyzed hydration would form (CH3)2CHOH (2-propanol).

Wait, but that would make E as 2-propanol. Then, E reacts with Fe and HCl. So 2-propanol (CH3CH(OH)CH3) with Fe and HCl. Hmm, perhaps it's a oxidation? Or maybe it's a substitution. Alternatively, maybe it's a Hofmann elimination, but that requires a strong base and heat. Alternatively, maybe it's a pinacol rearrangement, which requires a base. Hmm.

Wait, 2-propanol with HCl would maybe form some chlorinated compound, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's the Gattermann reaction, but that's for benzaldehyde. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydration to form propene. Using HCl and Fe, perhaps. So 2-propanol (E) → with Fe and HCl, perhaps dehydrated to form propene (C is propene again). Then F would be propene.

But then, propene reacts with nitrous acid. Hmm. Wait, propene plus nitrous acid could lead to formation of a diazo compound, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a different reaction. Alternatively, propene might not react with nitrous acid under these conditions. So perhaps this is another dead end.

I'm getting stuck here, so maybe I should proceed to the next step and see.

If F is propane, then with nitrous acid, perhaps it doesn't react. So G might not form, which suggests that perhaps the previous steps are incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in compound C. Let's re-examine. When A is C3H6 (propene), bromination would add Br to form 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, when treated with alcoholic KOH, which is a strong base, it would eliminate. But which product would that form? If you have 1,2-dibromopropane, elimination would form either 1-propene or 2-propene. Wait, wait, propene is CH2=CH2CH3? Wait, no, propene is CH2=CHCH3. Wait, 1,2-dibromopropane is CH2Br-CH2Br-CH3? No, wait, no. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 would give 1,2-dibromopropane as CH2BrCHBrCH3. So when treated with alcoholic KOH, the base would abstract a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr and forming a double bond. But in this case, where would the double bond form? Since the Brs are on adjacent carbons, elimination would form either 1-propene or 2-propene. Wait, but in this case, the starting material is 1,2-dibromopropane (CH2BrCH2BrCH3?), no, wait, no. Wait, wait. Propene is CH2=CHCH3. Adding Br2 (in CCl4) would add across the double bond, giving 1,2-dibromopropane as CH2Br-CHBr-CH3. So when treated with alcoholic KOH, it would eliminate two HBr molecules to form either 1-propene or 2-propene. Wait, but the structure would be CH2BrCHBrCH3. Eliminating HBr from the two adjacent Brs would form CH2=CHCH3 (propene) or is it another structure? Wait, wait, no. When you have Br on C1 and C2, elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2, giving CH2=CHCH3 (propene). So C is propene again. So the same as A.

Then, passing through red hot iron gives D, which is propyne. So D is propyne (HC≡CCH3).

Then, D (propyne) reacts with two strong acids to form E. As before, E is acetone.

Then, E (acetone) with Fe and HCl forms F. Perhaps F is propane.

Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. Hmm. I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the reaction that forms F. Let me think again. Maybe when E is acetone, the reaction with Fe and HCl isn't a reduction but something else. Maybe it's a Grignard reaction, but without a Mg, that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps it's a halogenation. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the conditions are for the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation? No, that's for ketones to form lactones or ketones, but that's not relevant here.

Wait, another thought: When E is acetone and reacts with Fe and HCl, maybe it's a nucleophilic substitution. But acetone is (CH3)2CO; I don't see an obvious leaving group. Alternatively, perhaps it's a condensation reaction, but with what?

Maybe I'm going down the wrong path. Let me try to proceed and see what the options are.

The options are statements about the products. Let's look at each option and see which one is incorrect.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes.

F is the product after E (acetone) reacts with Fe and HCl. I thought F was propane, which is an alkane. But propane doesn't seem to be used for dye synthesis. Alternatively, if F is something else, like propene, then propene is used in various reactions but not directly for dye synthesis. Alternatively, if F is a different compound, like acetone, which is used in some dyes, but I'm not sure.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution.

H is the product when G reacts with sodium hydroxide. Let me think about G. G is the product of F reacting with nitrous acid. If F is propane, which doesn't react, then G would be the same as F, which can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps F isn't propane. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: Let me list all the compounds step by step, assuming A is cyclopropane.

A: cyclopropane (C3H6).

Bromination in CCl4: cyclopropane would react with Br2 to form 1,2-dibromocyclopropane? Or would it open the ring? Alternatively, cyclopropane is highly strained, so adding Br2 would open the ring. So perhaps A is cyclopropane, and upon bromination, it forms 1,2-dibromopropane (same as if A were propene). Then, B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Then, reaction with alcoholic KOH would eliminate to form propene (C is propene).

Then, D is propyne after passing through red hot iron.

E is acetone after hydration.

F is propane after reduction.

Then, F is propane, which doesn't react with nitrous acid. So G would be the same as F, which is propane. Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H. But H is just propane and NaOH wouldn't react. So this can't be right.

Hmm. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me go back.

Alternative approach: Maybe the initial compound A is propene, and upon bromination, it's 1,2-dibromopropane. Then, elimination gives back propene. Then, D is propyne. E is acetone. F is propane. Then, F (propane) reacts with nitrous acid. Since that doesn't make sense, perhaps F is not propane. So perhaps I'm wrong about step E to F.

Alternatively, perhaps E is 2-propanol. Let me think again. If D is propyne, and E is formed via a different reaction. Let's say D reacts with H2SO4 and another acid, like H2O, in a hydration to form 2-propanol. Then E is 2-propanol.

Then, E (2-propanol) reacts with Fe and HCl. Hmm. 2-propanol with Fe and HCl: maybe it's a substitution reaction. Alternatively, maybe it's an oxidation. Wait, but oxidation of 2-propanol would form acetone, which is E again. So perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, perhaps E is 2-propanol, and with Fe and HCl, it undergoes some elimination. 2-propanol with HCl and heat could form chloropropane, but I'm not sure about the role of Fe here. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydration, producing propene. So F would be propene.

Then, F (propene) reacts with nitrous acid. Hmm, propene with HNO2. I don't think that's a standard reaction. But perhaps it's a dihydroxylation, but that's for alkenes. Alternatively, perhaps it's an addition reaction. Wait, maybe it's a hydroxylation. Alternatively, perhaps it's a nitrosation. Alternatively, I'm not sure. Let's say it forms some compound G.

Then, G reacts with NaOH to form H. Let's say G is a diol or something else that reacts with NaOH.

But I'm not getting much progress here.

Let me look at the options again.

Option D says that C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas at room temperature and is flammable. So D's statement is correct.

Option C says D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. D is propyne (CH≡CCH3). The structure is CH3-C≡C-H. The protons on the triple bond would be a singlet, and the CH3 would be a singlet as well. So in 1H NMR, the CH3 would be a singlet at around δ 1.2 ppm, and the H on the triple bond would be a singlet at δ 2.5 ppm. So two singlets. So option C is correct.

Option B says H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. Ferric chloride is used for testing phenols, which give a red-brown precipitate. So if H is phenol, then it would form a precipitate. Alternatively, if H is something else with a benzene ring, it could show color. But in our sequence, I don't see any benzene rings being formed. So perhaps H isn't a phenol. Hmm.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, which isn't used for dyes. Alternatively, if F is something else, like propene, which is a monomer for polymers, but not directly for dyes. Wait, but maybe if F is acetone, which is used in some dye synthesis steps. So if F is acetone, then A would be correct. But earlier steps lead me to think F is propane.

But perhaps I'm wrong about F. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps when E is acetone, the reaction with Fe and HCl is not a reduction but something else. Wait, maybe it's a Birch reduction, but that's for arenes. Alternatively, maybe it's a substitution. Alternatively, perhaps F is acetone itself, which could be used in dye synthesis. But that doesn't make sense because the reaction is supposed to produce F from E.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction with Fe and HCl isn't a reduction but a Grignard reaction, but without Mg, that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I was wrong about the reduction. Let me think: acetone (E) reacts with Fe and HCl. Another possibility: could it be a benzoin condensation? No, that's for aldehydes. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substitution where the carbonyl becomes something else.

Alternatively, maybe E is not acetone. Let me think again. If D is propyne, and E is formed by another reaction. For example, if D is propyne and reacts with H2SO4 and another strong acid, perhaps it's a dihydroxylation. Wait, but dihydroxylation is for alkenes. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps D is propyne and is treated with a mixture of HNO3 and H2SO4, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D reacts with two strong acids to form a different product. Maybe it's a hydration to form 2-propanol. So E is 2-propanol (CH3CH(OH)CH3).

Then, E reacts with Fe and HCl. Hmm. 2-propanol with Fe and HCl: perhaps it's a substitution. If so, the OH could be replaced by Cl, forming CH3CHClCH3. So F would be chloropropane.

Then, F (chloropropane) reacts with nitrous acid. Nitrous acid typically doesn't react with alkyl halides. So perhaps that's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe F is chloropropane, which doesn't react with nitrous acid. So G would be the same as F, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think about each option again.

Option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. Possible only if F is something like benzaldehyde or another compound used in dyes. But according to my earlier steps, F is propane, which doesn't fit. So option A would be incorrect if F is propane.

Option B: H gives a yellow color with ferric chloride. H would be the product of G reacting with NaOH. If G is a diol, then H would be something else. But without knowing G, it's hard to say.

Option C: D gives two singlets in 1H NMR. D is propyne, which as I thought earlier, gives two singlets. So C is correct.

Option D: C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a gas and flammable. So D is correct.

So the incorrect statement would be the one that's false. Let's see.

If F is propane, then option A says F is used for dye synthesis, which would be incorrect.

Alternatively, if F is something else, like chloropropane, then option A would still be incorrect because chloropropane isn't used for dye synthesis.

So the incorrect statement is option A.

But wait, another possibility: if F is acetone, then option A would be correct because acetone is sometimes used in organic synthesis, including dyes. But in that case, how would F be acetone? Because E is acetone, and F is formed from E. So you'd need E → F to be the same, which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake and F is something else. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps F is formed via a different reaction. Maybe E is acetone, and with Fe and HCl, it undergoes a substitution, forming something like CH3CHClCH3. But I'm not sure about that.

If F is chloroform (CHCl3), then it's a possible reagent in some dye syntheses. But I don't see how E would form that.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options again.

The question asks for the incorrect statement about the products. So, if all the statements are correct except one.

I think option A is incorrect because F as propane isn't used in dye synthesis. Alternatively, option B is incorrect if H isn't a phenol.

Wait, but where would a phenol come into play? Let me think about the steps again.

If H is the product of G and NaOH, and G is from F reacting with nitrous acid, which is a reaction I'm not sure about.

Alternatively, maybe G is an amine, but I don't see how that would happen.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps, and H is a phenol, making option B correct. But I don't see any step that introduces a benzene ring or a hydroxyl group attached to an aromatic ring.

So, based on the steps, I think the incorrect statement is option A: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. Because F is propane, which isn't used for that.


The reaction sequence begins with compound A (C₃H₆), which is either propene or cyclopropane. Bromination in the presence of carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄) suggests an addition reaction. If A is propene, bromination would yield 1,2-dibromopropane. If A is cyclopropane, bromination would open the ring to form 1,2-dibromopropane as well. Thus, compound B is 1,2-dibromopropane.

Compound B reacts with alcoholic KOH, a strong base, leading to elimination of two HBr molecules and the formation of propene (C). This makes compound C propene, which is a flammable gas. When propene passes through a red-hot iron tube, it undergoes dehydrogenation to form propyne (HC≡CCH₃), making compound D propyne.

Compound D reacts with a mixture of two strong acids, likely undergoing hydration to form acetone (CH₃COCH₃), making compound E acetone. Acetone then reacts with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid (HCl). This resembles the Clemmensen reduction, which reduces ketones to alkanes. Thus, compound F is propane (CH₃CH₂CH₃).

Propane reacts with nitrous acid (HNO₂), but there is no standard reaction between alkanes and nitrous acid. This step is unclear, but assuming no reaction occurs, compound G would remain propane. Finally, compound G reacts with sodium hydroxide (NaOH), but propane does not react with NaOH, leaving compound H as propane.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: F is used for the synthesis of dyes. If F is propane, this statement is incorrect because propane is not used for dye synthesis. Propane is an alkane used primarily as a fuel or chemical feedstock.
- **Option B**: H gives a yellow color with the addition of ferric chloride solution. Ferric chloride reacts with phenols to form a red-brown precipitate, but no phenol is formed in the sequence. Thus, this statement is incorrect.
- **Option C**: D gives two singlets in the ¹H NMR spectra. D is propyne (HC≡CCH₃), which has two types of protons: the CH₃ group (singlet at δ ~1.2 ppm) and the terminal H (singlet at δ ~2.5 ppm). This statement is correct.
- **Option D**: C is a flammable gas. C is propene, which is a flammable gas. This statement is correct.

The incorrect statements are **A** and **B**, but since only one must be chosen, **A** is the best answer because F (propane) is explicitly not used for dye synthesis.

Answer: A
