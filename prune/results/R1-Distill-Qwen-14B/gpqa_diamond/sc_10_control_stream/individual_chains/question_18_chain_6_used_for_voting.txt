Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about elemental abundances in stars using the EW method, and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms between two stars. Alright, let's break it down.

First, the problem gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I'm not sure if the mass plays a role here. The question is about elemental abundances, so maybe the mass is just extra info. Or perhaps it's relevant if it's about something like metallicity affecting the star's evolution, but I'll keep that in mind.

The given abundances are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

I also have the solar photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

Wait, what's that? Oh right, the notation [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. So [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) divided by (Fe/H)_sun, but wait no, actually, [Fe/H] is log( (Fe/H) / (Fe/H)_sun ). And since for the Sun, [X/H] is zero, but in this case, they give specific values, so I need to calculate the actual abundances.

Wait no, the given [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means Fe abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log( (Fe/H)_star / (Fe/H)_sun ), right? So if [Fe/H] is 0, then (Fe/H)_star equals (Fe/H)_sun.

Same for [Mg/H]_2 being 0; so Mg/H is the same as in the Sun.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, meaning Fe abundance is solar. [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, which means Si is 10^0.3 times more abundant relative to Fe compared to the Sun. Because [X/Y] = log(R), where R is (X/Y)/(X/Y)_sun. So if [X/Y] = a, R is 10^a.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe] = 0.3 → Si/Fe = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So Si is about twice as abundant relative to Fe as in the Sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si] = 0.3 → Mg/Si = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So Mg is twice as abundant relative to Si as in the Sun.

Wait, but what is the Sun's Mg/Si ratio? Let me think. The solar photosphere data is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5 = 1e-5.

So in the Sun, the ratio of Mg to Fe is (nMg/nH)/(nFe/nH) = (1e-5)/(3.16e-5) ≈ 0.316. So [Mg/Fe]_sun is log(0.316) ≈ log(3.16e-1) ≈ -0.5. Hmm, but maybe I don't need that right now.

But for Star_2, [Mg/Si] is 0.3. So let's model Star_2's composition.

Wait, but first, perhaps I should model both stars' elemental abundances.

Let's start with Star_1.

Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H = solar.
- [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → Si/Fe = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So Si is twice as abundant relative to Fe as in the Sun.

So in Star_1's atmosphere, the ratio nSi/nFe = 2 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

But wait, what's the solar ratio of Si/Fe? Let's compute that.

In the Sun, [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. Wait, no, [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y]_sun is 0. So the Sun's [X/Y] for any element is zero.

But to find the Sun's nSi/nFe, I need to compute it from the given data.

Wait, but the given data is for nFe and nMg, not Si. Hmm. Do I have solar Si abundance?

Wait, the problem gives only nFe and nMg in the Sun. So I don't have the exact solar abundance for Si, but perhaps I can find it relative.

Wait, perhaps I can find the solar [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] from the given data.

Wait, let me think: in the Sun, what's [Si/Fe]? I don't have that. Hmm, maybe I can get it from the elemental abundances for the Sun.

Wait, the Sun's photosphere has certain values. Let's see:

The problem gives:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 3.16e-5.

Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

But what about nSi/nH? I don't have that given. Hmm, maybe I can find [Mg/Si] in the Sun. The problem doesn't give it, but perhaps I can compute it from the given data.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] is log( (nMg/nSi) / (nMg/nSi)_sun ) = log( (nMg/nSi) ) - log( (nMg/nSi)_sun ) = 0 → so [Mg/Si]_sun is 0, meaning nMg/nSi in the Sun is 1 times solar.

But wait, no: [Mg/Si]_sun is zero, which means (Mg/Si)_star = (Mg/Si)_sun × 10^{[Mg/Si]_star}.

Wait, no. The definition is [Mg/Si] = log( (Mg/Si)_star / (Mg/Si)_sun )

So if [Mg/Si]_sun is zero, which it is, because it's the Sun, then [Mg/Si] for any star is log( (Mg/Si)_star / (Mg/Si)_sun )

So in the Sun, [Mg/Si] is zero → (Mg/Si)_sun = (Mg/Si)_sun.

But I don't know the Sun's Mg/Si value. Wait, perhaps I can compute it from the given data.

Wait, the Sun's nMg and nFe are given, but not nSi. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the Sun's [Mg/Si] from the given data.

Wait, maybe I can proceed by assuming that in the Sun, the [Mg/Si] is some value, but perhaps I can get the ratio between the two stars without knowing the Sun's Si.

Wait, maybe I can model the problem in terms of the Sun's abundance ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps I can work out the absolute abundances for each star relative to hydrogen.

Let me try that approach.

For the Sun:

nFe/H = 3.16e-5 (from 10^-4.5)

nMg/H = 1e-5.

But what about nSi/H in the Sun? Since [Si/Fe] is the log of (Si/Fe) / (Si/Fe)_sun.

Wait, for the Sun, [Si/Fe] would be zero, so (Si/Fe)_sun = (Fe/Si)_sun^{-1}.

Wait, no: [X/Y]_sun is zero, so the Sun's (X/Y) is 1 times the solar value, which is itself. So (Si/Fe)_sun = (nSi/nFe)_sun.

Wait, but I don't have (nSi/nH) in the Sun. Hmm. So maybe I can't calculate the absolute number for Si, but perhaps I can find the ratio between Star_1 and Star_2 in terms of their Si/H.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express Si in terms of Fe in each star, and then express Fe in terms of H.

Let me try.

So for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H = (Fe/H)_sun. So nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 × (Si/Fe)_sun.

So nSi_1 = nFe_1 × (10^0.3 × (Si/Fe)_sun )

But (Si/Fe)_sun is (nSi_sun / nFe_sun )

So nSi_1 = nFe_1 × (10^0.3 × (nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) )

But nFe_1 = (Fe/H)_sun × nH_1

Similarly, nFe_sun = (Fe/H)_sun × nH_sun.

Wait, but in the Sun, nH_sun is the number density of hydrogen in the Sun's photosphere. So nH_1 is the H density in Star_1. But I don't know the actual number, but perhaps I can express the ratio of Si in Star_1 and Star_2 in terms of their H densities.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio (nSi_1 / nH_1) divided by (nSi_2 / nH_2), which would give the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

So the ratio is (nSi_1 / nH_1) / (nSi_2 / nH_2) = (nSi_1 / nH_1) × (nH_2 / nSi_2 )

Which is (nSi_1 * nH_2) / (nH_1 * nSi_2 )

But wait, perhaps I can express each star's nSi in terms of their Fe and H.

Let me proceed.

For Star_1:
nSi_1 = nFe_1 × (10^0.3) × (nSi_sun / nFe_sun )

Because [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 × (Si/Fe)_sun.

Similarly, since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, nFe_1 = nFe_sun × (nH_1 / nH_sun )

Wait, no. Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH / (nFe/nH)_sun )

So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (nFe_1 / nH_1) = (nFe_sun / nH_sun )

So nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) × nH_1.

So nSi_1 = (nFe_1) × (10^0.3) × (nSi_sun / nFe_sun )

Substituting nFe_1:

nSi_1 = ( (nFe_sun / nH_sun) × nH_1 ) × 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun / nFe_sun )

Simplify: the (nFe_sun) cancels.

nSi_1 = (nH_1) × 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun / nH_sun )

So nSi_1 / nH_1 = 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun / nH_sun )

Similarly, nSi_sun / nH_sun is [Si/H]_sun. But since I don't have [Si/H]_sun, perhaps I can find it from the Sun's data.

Wait, in the Sun, nFe/nH = 3.16e-5.

So if I can find nSi/nH, that would be helpful.

But I don't have that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio between Star_1 and Star_2 without knowing the exact solar Si.

Let me try the same approach for Star_2.

Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → (Mg/Si)_2 = 10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun.

And [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → (Mg/H)_2 = (Mg/H)_sun.

So nMg_2 = (Mg/H)_sun × nH_2.

So (Mg/Si)_2 = (nMg_2 / nSi_2) = 10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun.

Which can be rearranged to:

nSi_2 = nMg_2 / (10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun )

But nMg_2 = (Mg/H)_sun × nH_2

So nSi_2 = [ (Mg/H)_sun × nH_2 ] / (10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun )

Then, nSi_2 / nH_2 = (Mg/H)_sun / (10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun )

Hmm, now I have expressions for (nSi_1 / nH_1) and (nSi_2 / nH_2). To find the ratio (nSi_1 / nH_1) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ), which is the ratio of silicon in the photospheres, so (nSi_1 /nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) = [ (nSi_1 /nH_1) ] × [ (nH_2) / (nSi_2) ) ]

So plugging in the expressions:

= [10^0.3 × (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ] × [ (nH_2) / ( (Mg/H)_sun / (10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun ) ) ) ]

Wait, wait, let me represent this correctly.

Wait, nSi_1 /nH_1 = 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

nSi_2 /nH_2 = (Mg/H)_sun / [ 10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun ) ]

So the ratio (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) = [10^0.3 × (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ] / [ (Mg/H)_sun / (10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun ) ) ]

Simplify denominator:

(Mg/H)_sun / (10^0.3 (Mg/Si)_sun )

So the ratio is:

[10^0.3 × (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ] × [10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun ) / (Mg/H)_sun ]

Which is:

10^(0.3 +0.3 ) × (nSi_sun / nH_sun ) × (Mg/Si)_sun / (Mg/H)_sun )

= 10^0.6 × [ (nSi_sun / nH_sun ) × (Mg/Si)_sun ) / (Mg/H)_sun ) ]

Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's see if I can express this more simply.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) as [Si/H]_sun, which is 12 + log(nSi/nH) = something. But I don't have that value.

Wait, perhaps (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) = 10^([Si/H]_sun -12 )

But I don't know [Si/H]_sun. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I can find (Mg/Si)_sun from the given solar data.

Because I have (Mg/H)_sun and (Fe/H)_sun, but not (Si/H)_sun.

Wait, perhaps I can find (Mg/Si)_sun = (nMg/nH) / (nSi/nH) = (nMg/nSi) × (nH/nH) = (nMg/nSi) = (Mg/Si)_sun.

So (Mg/Si)_sun = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) / (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ) = (nMg_sun) / (nSi_sun )

But I don't have (nSi_sun ), so perhaps this is a dead end.

Wait, but perhaps I can express the ratio in terms of known solar abundances.

Wait, let's see.

We have (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) = 3.16e-5 → log10(nFe/nH)_sun = log10(3.16e-5 ) = log10(3.16 ) + log10(1e-5 ) → approx 0.5 -5 = -4.5. Which matches the given 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log is -4.5.

Similarly, nMg_sun/nH_sun = 1e-5 → log is -5.

But without Si, I can't proceed numerically. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find (Mg/Si)_sun using the given data.

Wait, [Mg/Fe]_sun is log( (Mg/Fe)_sun ) = log( (nMg/nFe)_sun ) = log( (1e-5 ) / (3.16e-5 ) ) → log( 1 / 3.16 ) → log(≈0.316 ) → ≈ -0.5.

So [Mg/Fe]_sun ≈ -0.5. But that's not directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can express (Mg/Si)_sun in terms of (Mg/Fe)_sun and (Fe/Si)_sun.

Because (Mg/Si) = (Mg/Fe) × (Fe/Si).

Hmm, perhaps. So (Mg/Si)_sun = (Mg/Fe)_sun × (Fe/Si)_sun.

But (Fe/Si)_sun is 1/(Si/Fe)_sun. But I don't know (Si/Fe)_sun.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio (Mg/Si)_sun from the Sun's [Mg/Fe] and [Fe/Si], but I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I can make an assumption that in the Sun, the Mg/Si ratio is solar, but I don't know. Maybe I should think of an alternative approach.

Wait, maybe I can express all the elements in terms of Fe and H, and then see if that helps.

For Star_1:

nFe_1 = (Fe/H)_sun × nH_1.

nSi_1 = nFe_1 × 10^0.3 × (Si/Fe)_sun.

But (Si/Fe)_sun = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

So nSi_1 = (Fe/H)_sun × nH_1 × 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

So nSi_1 /nH_1 = (Fe/H)_sun × 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2:

nMg_2 = (Mg/H)_sun × nH_2.

nSi_2 = nMg_2 / (10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun )

But (Mg/Si)_sun = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

So nSi_2 = (Mg/H)_sun × nH_2 / (10^0.3 × (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) )

Thus, nSi_2 /nH_2 = (Mg/H)_sun / (10^0.3 × (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) )

Now, the ratio of (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) is:

[ (Fe/H)_sun × 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) ] / [ (Mg/H)_sun / (10^0.3 × (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (Fe/H)_sun × 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) ] × [ 10^0.3 × (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) ) / (Mg/H)_sun ]

= (Fe/H)_sun × 10^(0.3 + 0.3) × (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) × (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) × (1/(Mg/H)_sun )

Simplify:

10^0.6 × (Fe/H)_sun × (nMg_sun /nFe_sun ) × (1/(Mg/H)_sun )

Now, (Fe/H)_sun is (nFe_sun /nH_sun ), and (Mg/H)_sun is (nMg_sun /nH_sun )

So (Fe/H)_sun / (Mg/H)_sun = (nFe/nH) / (nMg/nH) ) = (nFe /nMg )

So substituting:

=10^0.6 × (nFe_sun /nMg_sun ) × (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) × (1/(nMg_sun /nH_sun )) )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me substitute:

= 10^0.6 × ( (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) ) × (nMg_sun /nFe_sun ) ) × (1 / (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) )

Wait, because (nMg_sun /nFe_sun ) × (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) × (nH_sun /nMg_sun ) ) → wait, let's compute:

(nFe_sun /nH_sun ) × (nMg_sun /nFe_sun ) = (nMg_sun /nH_sun )

Then, multiply by (1/(nMg_sun /nH_sun )) → that's (nH_sun /nMg_sun )

So overall, (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) × (nH_sun /nMg_sun ) ) = 1.

So the entire expression becomes 10^0.6 × 1 = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98.

Wait, that's 10^0.6, which is approximately 3.98, so about 4. That would correspond to option A (~3.9). Or option D is ~1.2, which is 10^0.079.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, let me retrace the steps.

We have:

Ratio = [ (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) ] / [ (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) ]

Which, after substitutions, becomes:

10^0.6 × ( (Fe/H)_sun / (Mg/H)_sun ) × (nMg_sun /nFe_sun ) )

Wait, no, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the substitution.

Wait, the key step was:

The ratio becomes:

10^0.6 × ( (Fe/H)_sun × (nMg_sun /nFe_sun ) ) × (1/(Mg/H)_sun )

Wait, (Fe/H)_sun is (nFe_sun /nH_sun )

(Mg/H)_sun is (nMg_sun /nH_sun )

So (Fe/H)_sun / (Mg/H)_sun = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) / (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) ) = (nFe_sun /nMg_sun )

So substituting back:

10^0.6 × (nFe_sun /nMg_sun ) × (nMg_sun /nFe_sun )

Wait, that's 10^0.6 × [ (nFe/nMg) × (nMg/nFe) ) ] → 10^0.6 × 1 → 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98.

So the ratio is approximately 4. So the answer is option A, ~3.9.

Wait, but the options don't have 4. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) ~3.9

B) ~12.6

C) ~0.8

D) ~1.2

Yes, option A is ~3.9, which is close to 3.98.

Wait, that's the calculation. So the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is about 3.98, so the answer should be A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar photospheric composition. The key steps are as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H = solar.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → Si/Fe = \(10^{0.3} \approx 2\). Thus, Si is twice as abundant relative to Fe as in the Sun.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → Mg/H = solar.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → Mg/Si = \(10^{0.3} \approx 2\). Thus, Mg is twice as abundant relative to Si as in the Sun.

3. **Solar Photosphere**:
   - \(12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \implies \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \implies n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 3.16 \times 10^{-5}\).
   - \(12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \implies \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \implies n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5}\).

### Analysis:
1. **Star_1**:
   - From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, the Si abundance relative to Fe is \(10^{0.3} \approx 2\). Since Fe/H is solar, the Si/H ratio in Star_1 is proportional to \(2 \times (n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}})_{\text{sun}}\).

2. **Star_2**:
   - From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, the Mg abundance relative to Si is \(10^{0.3} \approx 2\). Since Mg/H is solar, the Si/H ratio in Star_2 is proportional to \((n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\text{sun}} / (2 \times (n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}})_{\text{sun}})\).

3. **Ratio of Silicon Abundances**:
   - The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}}} = 10^{0.6} \times \frac{(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\text{sun}}}{(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\text{sun}}}.
     \]
   - Substituting the solar values:
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}}{n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}} = \frac{3.16 \times 10^{-5}}{10^{-5}} = 3.16.
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}}} = 10^{0.6} \times 3.16 \approx 3.98.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.98**, which corresponds to **Option A (~3.9)**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about elemental abundances in stars using the EW method, and I need to find the ratio of silicon atoms between two stars. Alright, let's break it down.

First, the problem gives me two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Their masses are 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, but I'm not sure if the mass plays a role here. The question is about elemental abundances, so maybe the mass is just extra info. Or perhaps it's relevant if it's about something like metallicity affecting the star's evolution, but I'll keep that in mind.

The given abundances are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

I also have the solar photospheric composition:
- 12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5
- 12 + log10(nMg/nH) = 7

Wait, what's that? Oh right, the notation [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. So [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) divided by (Fe/H)_sun, but wait no, actually, [Fe/H] is log( (Fe/H) / (Fe/H)_sun ). And since for the Sun, [X/H] is zero, but in this case, they give specific values, so I need to calculate the actual abundances.

Wait no, the given [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means Fe abundance relative to H is the same as in the Sun. Because [Fe/H] is log( (Fe/H)_star / (Fe/H)_sun ), right? So if [Fe/H] is 0, then (Fe/H)_star equals (Fe/H)_sun.

Same for [Mg/H]_2 being 0; so Mg/H is the same as in the Sun.

So for Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, meaning Fe abundance is solar. [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3, which means Si is 10^0.3 times more abundant relative to Fe compared to the Sun. Because [X/Y] = log(R), where R is (X/Y)/(X/Y)_sun. So if [X/Y] = a, R is 10^a.

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe] = 0.3 → Si/Fe = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So Si is about twice as abundant relative to Fe as in the Sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si] = 0.3 → Mg/Si = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So Mg is twice as abundant relative to Si as in the Sun.

Wait, but what is the Sun's Mg/Si ratio? Let me think. The solar photosphere data is given: 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for Mg: 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH = 10^-5 = 1e-5.

So in the Sun, the ratio of Mg to Fe is (nMg/nH)/(nFe/nH) = (1e-5)/(3.16e-5) ≈ 0.316. So [Mg/Fe]_sun is log(0.316) ≈ log(3.16e-1) ≈ -0.5. Hmm, but maybe I don't need that right now.

But for Star_2, [Mg/Si] is 0.3. So let's model Star_2's composition.

Wait, but first, perhaps I should model both stars' elemental abundances.

Let's start with Star_1.

Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H = solar.
- [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → Si/Fe = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So Si is twice as abundant relative to Fe as in the Sun.

So in Star_1's atmosphere, the ratio nSi/nFe = 2 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

But wait, what's the solar ratio of Si/Fe? Let's compute that.

In the Sun, [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. Wait, no, [X/Y] is log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun. So [X/Y]_sun is 0. So the Sun's [X/Y] for any element is zero.

But to find the Sun's nSi/nFe, I need to compute it from the given data.

Wait, but the given data is for nFe and nMg, not Si. Hmm. Do I have solar Si abundance?

Wait, the problem gives only nFe and nMg in the Sun. So I don't have the exact solar abundance for Si, but perhaps I can find it relative.

Wait, perhaps I can find the solar [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] from the given data.

Wait, let me think: in the Sun, what's [Si/Fe]? I don't have that. Hmm, maybe I can get it from the elemental abundances for the Sun.

Wait, the Sun's photosphere has certain values. Let's see:

The problem gives:

12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 3.16e-5.

Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)= -5 → nMg/nH = 1e-5.

But what about nSi/nH? I don't have that given. Hmm, maybe I can find [Mg/Si] in the Sun. The problem doesn't give it, but perhaps I can compute it from the given data.

Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] is log( (nMg/nSi) / (nMg/nSi)_sun ) = log( (nMg/nSi) ) - log( (nMg/nSi)_sun ) = 0 → so [Mg/Si]_sun is 0, meaning nMg/nSi in the Sun is 1 times solar.

But wait, no: [Mg/Si]_sun is zero, which means (Mg/Si)_star = (Mg/Si)_sun × 10^{[Mg/Si]_star}.

Wait, no. The definition is [Mg/Si] = log( (Mg/Si)_star / (Mg/Si)_sun )

So if [Mg/Si]_sun is zero, which it is, because it's the Sun, then [Mg/Si] for any star is log( (Mg/Si)_star / (Mg/Si)_sun )

So in the Sun, [Mg/Si] is zero → (Mg/Si)_sun = (Mg/Si)_sun.

But I don't know the Sun's Mg/Si value. Wait, perhaps I can compute it from the given data.

Wait, the Sun's nMg and nFe are given, but not nSi. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the Sun's [Mg/Si] from the given data.

Wait, maybe I can proceed by assuming that in the Sun, the [Mg/Si] is some value, but perhaps I can get the ratio between the two stars without knowing the Sun's Si.

Wait, maybe I can model the problem in terms of the Sun's abundance ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps I can work out the absolute abundances for each star relative to hydrogen.

Let me try that approach.

For the Sun:

nFe/H = 3.16e-5 (from 10^-4.5)

nMg/H = 1e-5.

But what about nSi/H in the Sun? Since [Si/Fe] is the log of (Si/Fe) / (Si/Fe)_sun.

Wait, for the Sun, [Si/Fe] would be zero, so (Si/Fe)_sun = (Fe/Si)_sun^{-1}.

Wait, no: [X/Y]_sun is zero, so the Sun's (X/Y) is 1 times the solar value, which is itself. So (Si/Fe)_sun = (nSi/nFe)_sun.

Wait, but I don't have (nSi/nH) in the Sun. Hmm. So maybe I can't calculate the absolute number for Si, but perhaps I can find the ratio between Star_1 and Star_2 in terms of their Si/H.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express Si in terms of Fe in each star, and then express Fe in terms of H.

Let me try.

So for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H = (Fe/H)_sun. So nFe_1/nH_1 = nFe_sun / nH_sun.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 × (Si/Fe)_sun.

So nSi_1 = nFe_1 × (10^0.3 × (Si/Fe)_sun )

But (Si/Fe)_sun is (nSi_sun / nFe_sun )

So nSi_1 = nFe_1 × (10^0.3 × (nSi_sun / nFe_sun ) )

But nFe_1 = (Fe/H)_sun × nH_1

Similarly, nFe_sun = (Fe/H)_sun × nH_sun.

Wait, but in the Sun, nH_sun is the number density of hydrogen in the Sun's photosphere. So nH_1 is the H density in Star_1. But I don't know the actual number, but perhaps I can express the ratio of Si in Star_1 and Star_2 in terms of their H densities.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio (nSi_1 / nH_1) divided by (nSi_2 / nH_2), which would give the ratio of silicon atoms in their photospheres.

So the ratio is (nSi_1 / nH_1) / (nSi_2 / nH_2) = (nSi_1 / nH_1) × (nH_2 / nSi_2 )

Which is (nSi_1 * nH_2) / (nH_1 * nSi_2 )

But wait, perhaps I can express each star's nSi in terms of their Fe and H.

Let me proceed.

For Star_1:
nSi_1 = nFe_1 × (10^0.3) × (nSi_sun / nFe_sun )

Because [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (Si/Fe)_1 = 10^0.3 × (Si/Fe)_sun.

Similarly, since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, nFe_1 = nFe_sun × (nH_1 / nH_sun )

Wait, no. Because [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH / (nFe/nH)_sun )

So [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → (nFe_1 / nH_1) = (nFe_sun / nH_sun )

So nFe_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) × nH_1.

So nSi_1 = (nFe_1) × (10^0.3) × (nSi_sun / nFe_sun )

Substituting nFe_1:

nSi_1 = ( (nFe_sun / nH_sun) × nH_1 ) × 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun / nFe_sun )

Simplify: the (nFe_sun) cancels.

nSi_1 = (nH_1) × 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun / nH_sun )

So nSi_1 / nH_1 = 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun / nH_sun )

Similarly, nSi_sun / nH_sun is [Si/H]_sun. But since I don't have [Si/H]_sun, perhaps I can find it from the Sun's data.

Wait, in the Sun, nFe/nH = 3.16e-5.

So if I can find nSi/nH, that would be helpful.

But I don't have that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio between Star_1 and Star_2 without knowing the exact solar Si.

Let me try the same approach for Star_2.

Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → (Mg/Si)_2 = 10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun.

And [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → (Mg/H)_2 = (Mg/H)_sun.

So nMg_2 = (Mg/H)_sun × nH_2.

So (Mg/Si)_2 = (nMg_2 / nSi_2) = 10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun.

Which can be rearranged to:

nSi_2 = nMg_2 / (10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun )

But nMg_2 = (Mg/H)_sun × nH_2

So nSi_2 = [ (Mg/H)_sun × nH_2 ] / (10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun )

Then, nSi_2 / nH_2 = (Mg/H)_sun / (10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun )

Hmm, now I have expressions for (nSi_1 / nH_1) and (nSi_2 / nH_2). To find the ratio (nSi_1 / nH_1) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ), which is the ratio of silicon in the photospheres, so (nSi_1 /nH_1) / (nSi_2/nH_2 ) = [ (nSi_1 /nH_1) ] × [ (nH_2) / (nSi_2) ) ]

So plugging in the expressions:

= [10^0.3 × (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ] × [ (nH_2) / ( (Mg/H)_sun / (10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun ) ) ) ]

Wait, wait, let me represent this correctly.

Wait, nSi_1 /nH_1 = 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun /nH_sun )

nSi_2 /nH_2 = (Mg/H)_sun / [ 10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun ) ]

So the ratio (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) = [10^0.3 × (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ] / [ (Mg/H)_sun / (10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun ) ) ]

Simplify denominator:

(Mg/H)_sun / (10^0.3 (Mg/Si)_sun )

So the ratio is:

[10^0.3 × (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ] × [10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun ) / (Mg/H)_sun ]

Which is:

10^(0.3 +0.3 ) × (nSi_sun / nH_sun ) × (Mg/Si)_sun / (Mg/H)_sun )

= 10^0.6 × [ (nSi_sun / nH_sun ) × (Mg/Si)_sun ) / (Mg/H)_sun ) ]

Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's see if I can express this more simply.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) as [Si/H]_sun, which is 12 + log(nSi/nH) = something. But I don't have that value.

Wait, perhaps (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) = 10^([Si/H]_sun -12 )

But I don't know [Si/H]_sun. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps I can find (Mg/Si)_sun from the given solar data.

Because I have (Mg/H)_sun and (Fe/H)_sun, but not (Si/H)_sun.

Wait, perhaps I can find (Mg/Si)_sun = (nMg/nH) / (nSi/nH) = (nMg/nSi) × (nH/nH) = (nMg/nSi) = (Mg/Si)_sun.

So (Mg/Si)_sun = (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) / (nSi_sun /nH_sun ) ) = (nMg_sun) / (nSi_sun )

But I don't have (nSi_sun ), so perhaps this is a dead end.

Wait, but perhaps I can express the ratio in terms of known solar abundances.

Wait, let's see.

We have (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) = 3.16e-5 → log10(nFe/nH)_sun = log10(3.16e-5 ) = log10(3.16 ) + log10(1e-5 ) → approx 0.5 -5 = -4.5. Which matches the given 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log is -4.5.

Similarly, nMg_sun/nH_sun = 1e-5 → log is -5.

But without Si, I can't proceed numerically. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find (Mg/Si)_sun using the given data.

Wait, [Mg/Fe]_sun is log( (Mg/Fe)_sun ) = log( (nMg/nFe)_sun ) = log( (1e-5 ) / (3.16e-5 ) ) → log( 1 / 3.16 ) → log(≈0.316 ) → ≈ -0.5.

So [Mg/Fe]_sun ≈ -0.5. But that's not directly helpful.

Wait, perhaps I can express (Mg/Si)_sun in terms of (Mg/Fe)_sun and (Fe/Si)_sun.

Because (Mg/Si) = (Mg/Fe) × (Fe/Si).

Hmm, perhaps. So (Mg/Si)_sun = (Mg/Fe)_sun × (Fe/Si)_sun.

But (Fe/Si)_sun is 1/(Si/Fe)_sun. But I don't know (Si/Fe)_sun.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio (Mg/Si)_sun from the Sun's [Mg/Fe] and [Fe/Si], but I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I can make an assumption that in the Sun, the Mg/Si ratio is solar, but I don't know. Maybe I should think of an alternative approach.

Wait, maybe I can express all the elements in terms of Fe and H, and then see if that helps.

For Star_1:

nFe_1 = (Fe/H)_sun × nH_1.

nSi_1 = nFe_1 × 10^0.3 × (Si/Fe)_sun.

But (Si/Fe)_sun = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

So nSi_1 = (Fe/H)_sun × nH_1 × 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

So nSi_1 /nH_1 = (Fe/H)_sun × 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun /nFe_sun )

Similarly, for Star_2:

nMg_2 = (Mg/H)_sun × nH_2.

nSi_2 = nMg_2 / (10^0.3 × (Mg/Si)_sun )

But (Mg/Si)_sun = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )

So nSi_2 = (Mg/H)_sun × nH_2 / (10^0.3 × (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) )

Thus, nSi_2 /nH_2 = (Mg/H)_sun / (10^0.3 × (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) )

Now, the ratio of (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) / (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) is:

[ (Fe/H)_sun × 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) ] / [ (Mg/H)_sun / (10^0.3 × (nMg_sun /nSi_sun )) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

= [ (Fe/H)_sun × 10^0.3 × (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) ] × [ 10^0.3 × (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) ) / (Mg/H)_sun ]

= (Fe/H)_sun × 10^(0.3 + 0.3) × (nSi_sun /nFe_sun ) × (nMg_sun /nSi_sun ) × (1/(Mg/H)_sun )

Simplify:

10^0.6 × (Fe/H)_sun × (nMg_sun /nFe_sun ) × (1/(Mg/H)_sun )

Now, (Fe/H)_sun is (nFe_sun /nH_sun ), and (Mg/H)_sun is (nMg_sun /nH_sun )

So (Fe/H)_sun / (Mg/H)_sun = (nFe/nH) / (nMg/nH) ) = (nFe /nMg )

So substituting:

=10^0.6 × (nFe_sun /nMg_sun ) × (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) × (1/(nMg_sun /nH_sun )) )

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me substitute:

= 10^0.6 × ( (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) ) × (nMg_sun /nFe_sun ) ) × (1 / (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) )

Wait, because (nMg_sun /nFe_sun ) × (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) × (nH_sun /nMg_sun ) ) → wait, let's compute:

(nFe_sun /nH_sun ) × (nMg_sun /nFe_sun ) = (nMg_sun /nH_sun )

Then, multiply by (1/(nMg_sun /nH_sun )) → that's (nH_sun /nMg_sun )

So overall, (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) × (nH_sun /nMg_sun ) ) = 1.

So the entire expression becomes 10^0.6 × 1 = 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98.

Wait, that's 10^0.6, which is approximately 3.98, so about 4. That would correspond to option A (~3.9). Or option D is ~1.2, which is 10^0.079.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, let me retrace the steps.

We have:

Ratio = [ (nSi_1 /nH_1 ) ] / [ (nSi_2 /nH_2 ) ]

Which, after substitutions, becomes:

10^0.6 × ( (Fe/H)_sun / (Mg/H)_sun ) × (nMg_sun /nFe_sun ) )

Wait, no, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the substitution.

Wait, the key step was:

The ratio becomes:

10^0.6 × ( (Fe/H)_sun × (nMg_sun /nFe_sun ) ) × (1/(Mg/H)_sun )

Wait, (Fe/H)_sun is (nFe_sun /nH_sun )

(Mg/H)_sun is (nMg_sun /nH_sun )

So (Fe/H)_sun / (Mg/H)_sun = (nFe_sun /nH_sun ) / (nMg_sun /nH_sun ) ) = (nFe_sun /nMg_sun )

So substituting back:

10^0.6 × (nFe_sun /nMg_sun ) × (nMg_sun /nFe_sun )

Wait, that's 10^0.6 × [ (nFe/nMg) × (nMg/nFe) ) ] → 10^0.6 × 1 → 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98.

So the ratio is approximately 4. So the answer is option A, ~3.9.

Wait, but the options don't have 4. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) ~3.9

B) ~12.6

C) ~0.8

D) ~1.2

Yes, option A is ~3.9, which is close to 3.98.

Wait, that's the calculation. So the ratio of silicon atoms in Star_1 to Star_2 is about 3.98, so the answer should be A.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar photospheric composition. The key steps are as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0 → Fe/H = solar.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → Si/Fe = \(10^{0.3} \approx 2\). Thus, Si is twice as abundant relative to Fe as in the Sun.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0 → Mg/H = solar.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 → Mg/Si = \(10^{0.3} \approx 2\). Thus, Mg is twice as abundant relative to Si as in the Sun.

3. **Solar Photosphere**:
   - \(12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7.5 \implies \log_{10}(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -4.5 \implies n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}} = 3.16 \times 10^{-5}\).
   - \(12 + \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = 7 \implies \log_{10}(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}) = -5 \implies n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}} = 10^{-5}\).

### Analysis:
1. **Star_1**:
   - From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, the Si abundance relative to Fe is \(10^{0.3} \approx 2\). Since Fe/H is solar, the Si/H ratio in Star_1 is proportional to \(2 \times (n_{\text{Si}}/n_{\text{Fe}})_{\text{sun}}\).

2. **Star_2**:
   - From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, the Mg abundance relative to Si is \(10^{0.3} \approx 2\). Since Mg/H is solar, the Si/H ratio in Star_2 is proportional to \((n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\text{sun}} / (2 \times (n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{Si}})_{\text{sun}})\).

3. **Ratio of Silicon Abundances**:
   - The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is given by:
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}}} = 10^{0.6} \times \frac{(n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\text{sun}}}{(n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}})_{\text{sun}}}.
     \]
   - Substituting the solar values:
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Fe}}/n_{\text{H}}}{n_{\text{Mg}}/n_{\text{H}}} = \frac{3.16 \times 10^{-5}}{10^{-5}} = 3.16.
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}/n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}/n_{\text{H,2}}} = 10^{0.6} \times 3.16 \approx 3.98.
     \]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.98**, which corresponds to **Option A (~3.9)**.

**Answer: A**
