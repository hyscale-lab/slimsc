Okay, so I've got this question about electron microscopes and gas molecules in a vacuum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but let's think this through.

So, the setup is Mike is designing a high-resolution transmission electron microscope. He's using a very high accelerating voltage, 1000 kV. He connected vacuum pumps to create an ultra-high vacuum, which is less than 10^-9 Torr. The idea is to have almost no gas molecules in the sample compartment because that helps with electron microscopy—like, fewer gas particles means less scattering of electrons, right?

But despite the pumps, some gas particles are still there. The mass spectrometer detects them, so Mike knows they're present. He calculated the mean free path of these gas molecules as λ1. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, I think. So λ1 depends on things like the pressure, temperature, and volume of the compartment.

Then, when he starts the electron beam, something interesting happens. The mean free path changes—it's now λ2, which is different from λ1. And the temperature is the same, so that's not a factor here. So what's going on?

Wait, the mean free path of the gas molecules would be affected by the electron beam somehow. Oh, right! The electron beam is a high-energy beam, which could interact with the gas molecules. Maybe it's causing ionization or some other effect.

When gas molecules are ionized, they become charged. Charged particles in a vacuum might behave differently. Oh, right, in an electric field, charged particles would experience a force. But wait, the electron beam itself is a source of electric fields, but I'm not sure about the specifics here.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to be more likely to scatter electrons. Wait, but the question is about the gas molecules' mean free path. So maybe the electron beam is affecting the mean free path of the gas molecules themselves.

Wait, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to be more likely to collide with each other or with the chamber walls. Or maybe the beam is adding energy to the gas molecules, increasing their kinetic energy, which would change their mean free path.

Wait, the mean free path λ is given by the formula λ = (k*T) / (sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the collision diameter, and P is pressure. But temperature is the same here. But if the pressure changes, λ changes. Or maybe the effective pressure changes because the gas is being influenced by the beam.

Wait, but the pressure in the compartment is already ultra-high vacuum. So perhaps the mean free path is dominated by other factors now.

Wait, when the electron beam is active, maybe the gas molecules are being ionized. In that case, the mean free path for the gas ions would be different. Because ions have a different way of interacting—charged particles are more likely to be affected by electric fields, but also, their collisions might be different.

Alternatively, the presence of the beam could cause the gas to be pumped out more efficiently, but that seems unlikely since the pumps are already running.

Wait, the question says that the mean free path of the gas molecules changed when the electron beam was initiated. So the gas molecules are the same, but their mean free path is now λ2.

So what's the mean free path dependent on? It depends on the pressure, temperature, and the size of the gas molecules. Since the pressure in the chamber is the same as before, but the presence of the electron beam probably affects the gas in some way.

Wait, another thought: the electron beam itself might produce X-rays or cause secondary electron emission. Could that affect the gas? Or maybe the electron beam causes the gas molecules to be excited or ionized, which affects their movement.

Wait, when a gas is ionized, the ions have a different mass and charge, which would change their mean free path. For example, if a gas molecule becomes an ion, its effective diameter might change because it's charged, so the collision cross-section could be larger. Or perhaps the mean free path decreases because the ions are more likely to interact with each other or other surfaces.

Alternatively, in a vacuum system, the presence of charged particles can change the behavior because they can be accelerated by the electric fields. But in this case, the sample compartment is at a high voltage—1000 kV. Wait, no, the accelerating voltage is the voltage applied to the electrons. The sample is in the path of the beam, but the compartment itself might be at a certain potential.

Wait, in a transmission electron microscope, the sample is typically placed between the first and second condenser lenses. The sample itself is often at ground potential, but the electron beam is accelerated to a high voltage (here, 1000 kV). So the sample is at a lower potential, but the electron beam is moving towards it.

So maybe the gas molecules in the compartment are subject to an electric field due to the high voltage. If the gas is partially ionized, the ions would experience a force in the electric field. This could cause them to accelerate and move towards the anode or cathode, depending on their charge.

If the ions are moving, their mean free path might be affected. For instance, if the ions are moving faster, their mean free path would be longer because they're moving more quickly between collisions. But wait, the mean free path formula λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P) assumes that the particles are moving at thermal velocities. If the gas is ionized and accelerated, their velocities would be higher, so T would be higher in that sense, but the actual temperature of the gas remains the same. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, but the question states that the sample compartment temperature remains the same, so T is the same. So back to the main point: the mean free path λ2 is not equal to λ1 when the electron beam is on.

So, possible reasons for λ2 < λ1: perhaps the electron beam is causing more frequent collisions among the gas molecules. Or maybe the gas is being ionized, which leads to more frequent collisions due to increased cross-section.

Wait, when a gas is ionized, the charged particles can have different collision properties. For example, ions might have a larger effective diameter, so the collision cross-section increases. If the collision cross-section d increases, the mean free path λ would decrease because λ is inversely proportional to d squared. So if d becomes larger, λ would be smaller.

Alternatively, ionized gas molecules may interact more with the chamber walls if they are charged, leading to more frequent collisions. But if the chamber is at high vacuum, perhaps the ions are more likely to stick to the walls, thus reducing the mean free path.

Wait, but in an ultra-high vacuum, the mean free path is already very large. So any effect from the electron beam would cause a small change in λ. But the question is, whether λ increases or decreases.

So if the gas molecules are ionized, their mean free path could be shorter because:

1. The collision cross-section increases (d increases) --> λ decreases.

2. The ions might have different behavior in the electric field, possibly causing more frequent collisions.

Alternatively, if the ions are accelerated and thus have higher velocities, the mean free path would increase because λ is proportional to (k*T)^(1/2), and higher velocity would mean higher T in effect. But wait, the actual temperature hasn't changed, so that's not the case.

Wait, but if the ions are accelerated by an electric field, their kinetic energy increases. So their speed increases, leading to a longer mean free path because they can move further before colliding. But wait, in the formula, λ is proportional to sqrt(T), so if the temperature is the same, but the ions have higher speeds, that might not fit.

Wait, but temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy. So if ions are accelerated by the electric field, their kinetic energy increases, which would make it seem like the temperature has gone up, but the actual thermal energy hasn't changed. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the ionized gas molecules are more likely to interact with the electron beam, which leads to more scattering events and thus a shorter mean free path. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, the key point is that when the electron beam is on, the mean free path of the gas molecules (λ) changes from λ1 to λ2. Could the beam cause the gas to have a lower mean free path because the gas is more dense in some way?

Wait, another angle: in the presence of the electron beam, perhaps the gas is being pumped more effectively, reducing the pressure. But the pressure in the sample compartment is already ultra-high vacuum, so a reduction would be minimal. But if the pressure decreases, then the mean free path λ would increase because λ is inversely proportional to pressure.

Wait, but the question states that the temperature remained the same, so if pressure decreased, λ would increase. So λ2 would be greater than λ1. But that doesn't match all the possibilities.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam might cause gas molecules to be excited or ionized, leading to more frequent collisions, thus reducing the mean free path.

Wait, perhaps the ions are more likely to collide because they carry a charge. So maybe in the presence of the beam, the mean free path λ2 becomes shorter than λ1.

So if λ2 < λ1, that would mean the mean free path is shorter. So looking at the options, option C says λ2 < λ1. But wait, the mean free path could also increase if, for example, the effective pressure decreases.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas to expand or move, which would increase the mean free path. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the electron beam has a high energy. Could it cause the gas molecules to be knocked out of the sample compartment, effectively reducing the number of gas molecules present? If so, the pressure would decrease, leading to a longer mean free path. So λ2 would be greater than λ1. That would point towards option A (λ2 >= 1.22 λ1) or D (介于两者之间).

But how likely is that? If the gas molecules are being removed from the compartment, the pressure would drop, so λ increases. But the initial setup already has a very low pressure, so the change might be significant. But the question says that Mike detected gas particles with the mass spectrometer; so perhaps some gas remains.

Wait, but the question says that upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path changes. So perhaps the electron beam is causing gas molecules to be more likely to scatter electrons, but that doesn't directly affect their mean free path among themselves.

Alternatively, perhaps the electron beam is causing the gas molecules to ionize, which would affect their interactions. Since ions have charges, their mutual interactions could lead to more frequent collisions. So the mean free path could be shorter, λ2 < λ1.

Alternatively, maybe the ions are moving faster because they are accelerated by the electric field, so their mean free path increases. Hmm.

Wait, the mean free path is about how far a molecule travels before colliding with another molecule. If the gas molecules are ionized and accelerated, they might move faster, which would increase the mean free path. But if they are more likely to collide because they're charged, that would decrease the mean free path.

So which effect dominates? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if the gas is ionized, the number of collisions might increase. Because the ions have more ways to interact—electrostatic interactions instead of just elastic collisions. So the mean free path could decrease.

Wait, another approach: think about the formula for mean free path.

The mean free path λ is given by:

λ = 1 / (n * σ)

where n is the number density of the gas molecules, and σ is the collision cross-section.

If the electron beam causes some of the gas molecules to be ionized, then the number of neutral molecules (n) would decrease, and the number of ions would increase. But the ions would have a different cross-section. Suppose the cross-section for ions is larger than for neutral molecules. Then, the effective σ would increase, leading to a decrease in λ. Because λ is inversely proportional to σ.

So with higher σ, λ decreases.

Alternatively, if the ionization doesn't change the cross-section, but the number density decreases because some molecules are ionized and perhaps removed from the system (e.g., stuck on the walls), then n would decrease, leading to λ increasing.

But whether n increases or decreases depends on the specifics.

Wait, but in a high vacuum, even a small number of gas molecules can significantly affect the mean free path. If the electron beam causes some of them to be removed, the pressure would drop, so n decreases, λ increases.

So in this case, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But wait, the initial λ1 was calculated under ultra-high vacuum conditions. If the beam causes the gas to be pumped out more, the pressure would be lower, so λ2 > λ1.

But in the question, the initial state already had an ultra-high vacuum. So the change would be a small increase in λ, but perhaps significant.

Wait, but the question says that when the beam is on, the mean free path changes. So perhaps the beam is causing the gas to be more ionized, which affects the mean free path.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam reduces the effective pressure, thus increasing the mean free path.

Wait, another thought: The electron beam has a high current density and high energy. It might produce X-rays or cause secondary electron emission when it hits the sample or the chamber walls. These X-rays can, in turn, cause more ionization of the gas molecules in the compartment.

So, more ionization would lead to an increase in charged particles. Charged particles (ions) are more likely to be affected by the electric fields in the microscope, which could cause them to move towards the anode or cathode. So the ions might be accelerated, and perhaps even pumped out of the system if they reach the walls and are collected.

If more gas molecules are ionized and then removed from the compartment, the number density n would decrease, which would increase the mean free path λ. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

Which would mean λ2 > λ1. Looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22*λ1. Option D is λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 λ1. So if λ2 is bigger than λ1 but less than or equal to 1.22 times, that would fit. Alternatively, if it's significantly larger.

But wait, the problem states that Mike determined λ1 based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. So perhaps under normal conditions, when the beam is off, the mean free path is λ1. When the beam is on, the gas is ionized, and more gas molecules are lost, so the pressure drops, leading to a longer mean free path λ2 > λ1.

So that would suggest option A or C. But since λ2 is longer, it's either option A or D.

Wait, but the question says that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; it was λ2. So it's either longer or shorter.

If the ionized gas is being pumped out, then n decreases, so λ increases.

So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Which option says λ2 is larger? Option A and C don't. Option A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1. Option C says λ2 < λ1, which is opposite.

Wait, the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules. If the gas is being ionized and pumped out, the pressure inside the chamber would decrease. Lower pressure means higher mean free path. So λ2 > λ1.

So in that case, the correct option would be A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 or D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1.

Wait, but why would the mean free path be at least 1.22 times? That seems like a big jump. Alternatively, maybe the mean free path could be either longer or shorter.

Wait, another possibility: when the electron beam is applied, the gas molecules might be excited or ionized, which changes their effective diameter. For example, if the molecules become ionized and thus larger in cross-section (due to electron clouds), then the collision cross-section σ increases. Since λ is inversely proportional to σ, λ would decrease, making λ2 < λ1.

So now I'm confused because there are two possibilities: either λ2 increases or decreases.

What's the driving factor here? I need to think about which effect dominates.

If the gas is ionized, the cross-section for collisions might increase because ions have more extended charge distributions. So, the collision cross-section σ increases. Hence, λ = 1/(n σ) would decrease. So λ2 < λ1.

But another factor is that some ions may be removed from the system, leading to a lower n. If n decreases and σ increases, the effect on λ depends on which change is more significant.

Suppose σ increases by a factor x and n decreases by a factor y. Then λ2 = λ1 * (y/x).

If y is less than x, then λ2 < λ1. If y is greater than x, λ2 increases.

Which effect is more significant? It's hard to say without more data.

But in the scenario, the presence of the electron beam is causing the change. The electron beam's energy is much higher than the thermal energy of the gas molecules, so the ionization effect is probably significant.

When a gas is ionized, the number of particles (n) increases if we consider both ions and neutral molecules. Wait, because ionization breaks a molecule into two charged particles: a positive ion and electrons. So initially, each molecule contributes to n as 1. After ionization, each molecule becomes 2 particles (ion and electron), but wait, no—because the total number of gas particles would increase. So n could actually increase, leading to a shorter mean free path.

Wait, but wait. The initial n is the number density of gas molecules. If ionization occurs, each molecule becomes an ion plus an electron. But since electrons are much lighter and perhaps more mobile, their presence might affect the mean free path. But for the mean free path of the gas molecules (ions), n would be the same as before if the number of gas molecules doesn't change, but their charge does. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps the main effect is that the ions are accelerated by the electric field, which affects their motion. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: think about real-world electron microscopes. In TEMs, the vacuum is crucial because any gas molecules in the vacuum chamber can cause electron scattering, which degrades image resolution. To minimize this, ultra-high vacuum is used. However, sometimes, even in ultra-high vacuum, some gas remains. When the electron beam is incident, it can cause gas molecules to be ionized, and the ions can be repelled by the beam's electric field, moving away from the beam path. This might reduce the number of gas molecules in the beam path, effectively increasing the mean free path elsewhere.

Wait, but the mean free path is a bulk property, so if the ions are moving away, perhaps the density in the sample compartment's main area decreases, leading to a higher mean free path.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the beam, leading to more scattering and thus a shorter mean free path for the gas.

Wait, I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the options again.

If the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more likely to collide with each other (due to increased cross-section), the mean free path λ2 would be less than λ1. So λ2 < λ1 → option C.

Alternatively, if the gas is ionized and the ions are accelerated away, leading to lower density and longer λ, then λ2 > λ1.

Which is more plausible? I'm not sure, but in the context of the question, the presence of the electron beam would increase the ionization, leading to more frequent collisions because the ions have larger cross-sections. So λ2 would be smaller than λ1.

Thus, the correct answer would be option C: λ2 < λ1.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves analyzing the change in the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in the sample compartment of a high-resolution transmission electron microscope when the electron beam is activated. Initially, Mike determines the mean free path as λ1 under ultra-high vacuum conditions. However, upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2. The task is to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Formula**: The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the number density \( n \) and the collision cross-section \( \sigma \):  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1}{n \sigma}
   \]  
   Factors such as temperature, pressure, and molecular size influence \( \lambda \).

2. **Effect of the Electron Beam**: The electron beam introduces several effects:
   - **Ionization**: The gas molecules may become ionized, leading to charged particles (ions and electrons). Ionization can increase the collision cross-section \( \sigma \) because charged particles have extended charge distributions, making them more likely to interact with each other.
   - **Pumping or Removal**: The electron beam can cause ionized particles to be accelerated or removed from the system (e.g., via walls or pumps), potentially reducing the number density \( n \).

3. **Impact on \( \lambda \)**:
   - If ionization increases \( \sigma \), the mean free path \( \lambda \) decreases because \( \lambda \propto 1/\sigma \).
   - If ionized particles are removed, \( n \) decreases, which would increase \( \lambda \). However, the question specifies that the mean free path changes, implying that the dominant effect is not a reduction in \( n \) but rather an increase in \( \sigma \) due to ionization.

4. **Conclusion**: The ionization effect is likely the dominant factor, leading to an increased collision cross-section and a shorter mean free path. Therefore, \( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (\( \lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1 \))**: This implies a significant increase in \( \lambda \), which is inconsistent with the ionization effect that reduces \( \lambda \).
- **Option B (\( \lambda_2 = \lambda_1 \))**: This suggests no change in \( \lambda \), which contradicts the observation that \( \lambda \) changes.
- **Option C (\( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \))**: This aligns with the dominant effect of increased collision cross-section due to ionization, leading to a shorter mean free path.
- **Option D (\( \lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1 \))**: This implies a small increase in \( \lambda \), which is unlikely given the ionization effect.

The most plausible conclusion is that \( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \), making **Option C** the correct answer.

λ = 1 / (n * σ)

where n is the number density of the gas molecules, and σ is the collision cross-section.

If the electron beam causes some of the gas molecules to be ionized, then the number of neutral molecules (n) would decrease, and the number of ions would increase. But the ions would have a different cross-section. Suppose the cross-section for ions is larger than for neutral molecules. Then, the effective σ would increase, leading to a decrease in λ. Because λ is inversely proportional to σ.

So with higher σ, λ decreases.

Alternatively, if the ionization doesn't change the cross-section, but the number density decreases because some molecules are ionized and perhaps removed from the system (e.g., stuck on the walls), then n would decrease, leading to λ increasing.

But whether n increases or decreases depends on the specifics.

Wait, but in a high vacuum, even a small number of gas molecules can significantly affect the mean free path. If the electron beam causes some of them to be removed, the pressure would drop, so n decreases, λ increases.

So in this case, λ2 would be larger than λ1.

But wait, the initial λ1 was calculated under ultra-high vacuum conditions. If the beam causes the gas to be pumped out more, the pressure would be lower, so λ2 > λ1.

But in the question, the initial state already had an ultra-high vacuum. So the change would be a small increase in λ, but perhaps significant.

Wait, but the question says that when the beam is on, the mean free path changes. So perhaps the beam is causing the gas to be more ionized, which affects the mean free path.

Alternatively, maybe the presence of the electron beam reduces the effective pressure, thus increasing the mean free path.

Wait, another thought: The electron beam has a high current density and high energy. It might produce X-rays or cause secondary electron emission when it hits the sample or the chamber walls. These X-rays can, in turn, cause more ionization of the gas molecules in the compartment.

So, more ionization would lead to an increase in charged particles. Charged particles (ions) are more likely to be affected by the electric fields in the microscope, which could cause them to move towards the anode or cathode. So the ions might be accelerated, and perhaps even pumped out of the system if they reach the walls and are collected.

If more gas molecules are ionized and then removed from the compartment, the number density n would decrease, which would increase the mean free path λ. So λ2 would be greater than λ1.

Which would mean λ2 > λ1. Looking at the options, option A says λ2 >= 1.22*λ1. Option D is λ1 < λ2 < 1.22 λ1. So if λ2 is bigger than λ1 but less than or equal to 1.22 times, that would fit. Alternatively, if it's significantly larger.

But wait, the problem states that Mike determined λ1 based on factors such as sample compartment volume, pressure, and temperature. So perhaps under normal conditions, when the beam is off, the mean free path is λ1. When the beam is on, the gas is ionized, and more gas molecules are lost, so the pressure drops, leading to a longer mean free path λ2 > λ1.

So that would suggest option A or C. But since λ2 is longer, it's either option A or D.

Wait, but the question says that the mean free path was no longer equal to λ1; it was λ2. So it's either longer or shorter.

If the ionized gas is being pumped out, then n decreases, so λ increases.

So λ2 would be larger than λ1.

Which option says λ2 is larger? Option A and C don't. Option A says λ2 >= 1.22 λ1. Option C says λ2 < λ1, which is opposite.

Wait, the question is about the mean free path of the gas molecules. If the gas is being ionized and pumped out, the pressure inside the chamber would decrease. Lower pressure means higher mean free path. So λ2 > λ1.

So in that case, the correct option would be A) λ2 >= 1.22*λ1 or D) λ1 < λ2 < 1.22*λ1.

Wait, but why would the mean free path be at least 1.22 times? That seems like a big jump. Alternatively, maybe the mean free path could be either longer or shorter.

Wait, another possibility: when the electron beam is applied, the gas molecules might be excited or ionized, which changes their effective diameter. For example, if the molecules become ionized and thus larger in cross-section (due to electron clouds), then the collision cross-section σ increases. Since λ is inversely proportional to σ, λ would decrease, making λ2 < λ1.

So now I'm confused because there are two possibilities: either λ2 increases or decreases.

What's the driving factor here? I need to think about which effect dominates.

If the gas is ionized, the cross-section for collisions might increase because ions have more extended charge distributions. So, the collision cross-section σ increases. Hence, λ = 1/(n σ) would decrease. So λ2 < λ1.

But another factor is that some ions may be removed from the system, leading to a lower n. If n decreases and σ increases, the effect on λ depends on which change is more significant.

Suppose σ increases by a factor x and n decreases by a factor y. Then λ2 = λ1 * (y/x).

If y is less than x, then λ2 < λ1. If y is greater than x, λ2 increases.

Which effect is more significant? It's hard to say without more data.

But in the scenario, the presence of the electron beam is causing the change. The electron beam's energy is much higher than the thermal energy of the gas molecules, so the ionization effect is probably significant.

When a gas is ionized, the number of particles (n) increases if we consider both ions and neutral molecules. Wait, because ionization breaks a molecule into two charged particles: a positive ion and electrons. So initially, each molecule contributes to n as 1. After ionization, each molecule becomes 2 particles (ion and electron), but wait, no—because the total number of gas particles would increase. So n could actually increase, leading to a shorter mean free path.

Wait, but wait. The initial n is the number density of gas molecules. If ionization occurs, each molecule becomes an ion plus an electron. But since electrons are much lighter and perhaps more mobile, their presence might affect the mean free path. But for the mean free path of the gas molecules (ions), n would be the same as before if the number of gas molecules doesn't change, but their charge does. Hmm, perhaps I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps the main effect is that the ions are accelerated by the electric field, which affects their motion. But I'm not sure.

Another approach: think about real-world electron microscopes. In TEMs, the vacuum is crucial because any gas molecules in the vacuum chamber can cause electron scattering, which degrades image resolution. To minimize this, ultra-high vacuum is used. However, sometimes, even in ultra-high vacuum, some gas remains. When the electron beam is incident, it can cause gas molecules to be ionized, and the ions can be repelled by the beam's electric field, moving away from the beam path. This might reduce the number of gas molecules in the beam path, effectively increasing the mean free path elsewhere.

Wait, but the mean free path is a bulk property, so if the ions are moving away, perhaps the density in the sample compartment's main area decreases, leading to a higher mean free path.

Alternatively, the presence of the electron beam could cause the gas molecules to be more likely to collide with the beam, leading to more scattering and thus a shorter mean free path for the gas.

Wait, I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the options again.

If the electron beam causes gas molecules to be more likely to collide with each other (due to increased cross-section), the mean free path λ2 would be less than λ1. So λ2 < λ1 → option C.

Alternatively, if the gas is ionized and the ions are accelerated away, leading to lower density and longer λ, then λ2 > λ1.

Which is more plausible? I'm not sure, but in the context of the question, the presence of the electron beam would increase the ionization, leading to more frequent collisions because the ions have larger cross-sections. So λ2 would be smaller than λ1.

Thus, the correct answer would be option C: λ2 < λ1.


The question involves analyzing the change in the mean free path (λ) of gas molecules in the sample compartment of a high-resolution transmission electron microscope when the electron beam is activated. Initially, Mike determines the mean free path as λ1 under ultra-high vacuum conditions. However, upon initiating the electron beam, the mean free path changes to λ2. The task is to determine the relationship between λ1 and λ2.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Mean Free Path Formula**: The mean free path λ is inversely proportional to the number density \( n \) and the collision cross-section \( \sigma \):  
   \[
   \lambda = \frac{1}{n \sigma}
   \]  
   Factors such as temperature, pressure, and molecular size influence \( \lambda \).

2. **Effect of the Electron Beam**: The electron beam introduces several effects:
   - **Ionization**: The gas molecules may become ionized, leading to charged particles (ions and electrons). Ionization can increase the collision cross-section \( \sigma \) because charged particles have extended charge distributions, making them more likely to interact with each other.
   - **Pumping or Removal**: The electron beam can cause ionized particles to be accelerated or removed from the system (e.g., via walls or pumps), potentially reducing the number density \( n \).

3. **Impact on \( \lambda \)**:
   - If ionization increases \( \sigma \), the mean free path \( \lambda \) decreases because \( \lambda \propto 1/\sigma \).
   - If ionized particles are removed, \( n \) decreases, which would increase \( \lambda \). However, the question specifies that the mean free path changes, implying that the dominant effect is not a reduction in \( n \) but rather an increase in \( \sigma \) due to ionization.

4. **Conclusion**: The ionization effect is likely the dominant factor, leading to an increased collision cross-section and a shorter mean free path. Therefore, \( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (\( \lambda_2 \geq 1.22 \lambda_1 \))**: This implies a significant increase in \( \lambda \), which is inconsistent with the ionization effect that reduces \( \lambda \).
- **Option B (\( \lambda_2 = \lambda_1 \))**: This suggests no change in \( \lambda \), which contradicts the observation that \( \lambda \) changes.
- **Option C (\( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \))**: This aligns with the dominant effect of increased collision cross-section due to ionization, leading to a shorter mean free path.
- **Option D (\( \lambda_1 < \lambda_2 < 1.22 \lambda_1 \))**: This implies a small increase in \( \lambda \), which is unlikely given the ionization effect.

The most plausible conclusion is that \( \lambda_2 < \lambda_1 \), making **Option C** the correct answer.

Answer: C
