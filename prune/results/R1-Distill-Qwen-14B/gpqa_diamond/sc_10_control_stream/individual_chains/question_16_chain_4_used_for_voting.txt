Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity. There are seven compounds listed, and the options are from A to D, with the answers ranging from 2 to 5. I need to evaluate each compound one by one.

First, let me recall what makes a compound optically active. A compound is optically active if it has chirality, meaning it has a chiral center (a carbon with four different substituents) and isn't a meso compound, which can have identical mirror images and thus not be chiral overall. Also, compounds with plane or center of symmetry might not be chiral, so I should check for that.

Let's list the compounds and analyze each:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
   Structure: The double bond is at position 1-2. Chlorine is on C1, methyl on C2. Wait, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but in this case, it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. But the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Hmm, no, wait: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, and a methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl attached to the double-bonded carbon. Because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one H on C1. So the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is CH2. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons, so positions 1,2,3,4. So 1-chloro is on the first carbon, which is part of the double bond. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, not that. Let me think again. The molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So chloro is on the first carbon, which is part of the double bond. So the structure is Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded to the second. So it's Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's Cl on the first carbon, which is double bonded to CH(CH3). So, perhaps Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, that can't be. Wait, but the position is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2(Cl)-CH2(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that can't be. Actually, wait, but it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's not right because of the double bond. Oh wait, wait, the but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first CH2. So it's ClCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-? No, wait, but 2-methyl would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? But wait, but that can't be because the double bond is between 1 and 2, so it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have Cl on C1 and CH3 on C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or perhaps it's Cl on the first carbon of the double bond, which is CH2Cl. So the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't have a double bond. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl attached to the first carbon, which is part of a double bond. So it's Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would make the double bond between C2 and C3, not C1 and C2. Oh, wait, no. Wait, but if it's but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3 but that's not possible because but-1-ene has a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl on C1, and a methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's not considering the double bond. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about whether this compound has a chiral center.

Wait, if the compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, then the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl, two CH2 groups? Or wait, perhaps the structure is Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded to the second. So the first carbon is CH2Cl, the second is CH(CH3), and the third and fourth are CH2 and CH3. But wait, perhaps it's more like CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would be three carbons, not four. No, but but is four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methyl would be Cl on the first CH2, and CH3 on the second CH. So the structure is ClCH2-CH(CH3)=CH2. But wait, that's only three carbons after the Cl. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The main point is whether this compound has a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But wait, how is that possible? Let me think about the structure. The molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and two CH2 groups? Or wait, perhaps C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and the other substituents are CH2 and CH3 on either side? Maybe the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's four carbons: Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with the double bond between C1 and C2. Hmm, perhaps the molecule is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would be but-1-ene with substituents on C1 and C2. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong, but maybe the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether this compound has a chiral center. For a chiral center, you need four different groups attached to a carbon. In this compound, perhaps the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C2 has a methyl group. But wait, if the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2, then C2 would have CH3, CH2Cl, and two CH2 groups on either side. Wait, no, perhaps C2 is attached to Cl, CH2CH3, CH(CH3), and another substituent? No, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the compound doesn't have a chiral center because the substituents are arranged symmetrically. Wait, but if it's (Z) configuration, maybe there's a plane of symmetry. For the (Z) isomer, the higher priority groups are on the same side. So, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So this compound might not be chiral, hence not optically active. Alternatively, maybe it does have a chiral center, but I'm not seeing it. Hmm. I'll mark this as a possible no for optical activity and come back to it.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione
   Wow, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down. The compound is a bicyclic structure. Methanoisobenzofuran suggests a fused ring system. It's a dione, so two ketone groups. The substituent is a chloromethylene group (CH2Cl) attached at position 8. The stereochemistry is given as (3aR,7aS,E). The E configuration refers to the double bond geometry.

Wait, the substituent is 8-(chloromethylene), which is a methylene group (CH2) with a Cl. So, the substituent is CH2Cl attached via a double bond? Or is it a substituent attached as a substituent in the ring? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the chloromethylene is part of a double bond in the structure. So, if the substituent has a double bond, then perhaps the molecule has a double bond with substituents that could lead to E or Z configuration.

But the key here is whether the molecule has a chiral center. If the ring structure has any stereocenters, then it could be chiral. The substituent might introduce a stereocenter. Alternatively, maybe the bicyclic system itself has symmetry. But given the substituent is chloromethylene and the stereochemistry is specified (R and S configurations), it suggests that the molecule has stereocenters, so it would be chiral. Therefore, this compound is optically active.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
   Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. In the 2 and 3 positions, each has a methyl group. The configuration is R and S.

So the molecule is HOOC-CH2(CH3)-CH2(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, wait, 2 and 3 positions in succinic acid are the two central CH2 groups. So, 2R,3S-dimethylsuccinic acid would have methyl groups on C2 and C3. So each of these carbons has two methyl groups? Or wait, no: each of C2 and C3 would have a methyl substituent.

Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would make it HOOC-CH2(CH3)-CH2(CH3)-COOH? No, wait, wait, 2 and 3 are the CH2 groups. So 2R would be CH(CH3)OH (no, wait, no, succinic acid is a diacid, so the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So the central two carbons are each CH2. When they're substituted with methyl, each becomes CH(CH3). So each of these carbons has two CH3 groups, a COOH group (on one end), and a CH(CH3) on the other. Wait, no. Let me think: each CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So C2 is CH(CH3), and C3 is CH(CH3). So each of these carbons has two methyl groups, so the substituents would be: for C2, the groups are (CH(CH3)), CH2CH2COOH, and perhaps others. Wait, no. Let's look at C2: it's CH(CH3) attached to C1 (which is COOH), and C3 (which is CH(CH3)), and two H's? No, wait, no. Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When we add a methyl to C2 and C3, each CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So each of these carbons (C2 and C3) now has:

C2: attached to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), two methyl groups? No, wait, C2 would have:

- One methyl group (CH3)
- Two CH2 groups (but no, because the other substituents are C1 and C3)

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me structure it:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH?

No, because 2 and 3 are adjacent. So it's HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has a methyl group. Now, each of these carbons has four substituents?

Wait, for C2: groups are:

- HOOC- (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Two CH3 groups?

Wait, no. No, because C2 is now CH(CH3), which has substituents: one methyl, one HOOC-CH2- group (wait, no). Let me think again.

The structure is:

HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)-COOH? No, that's not right because the middle two carbons are each CH(CH3). So, for C2, it's attached to:

- C1: HOOC-CH2- (no, wait, C1 is HOOC-, and C2 is CH(CH3), so C2 is connected to C1 (which is a COOH group), C3 (which is a CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups? Wait, no, because when we add a methyl to C2, it's CH(CH3), so each C2 and C3 has a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps I should count the substituents on C2. C2 is connected to:

- C1: which is a COOH group (so a carboxylic acid)
- C3: which is a CH(CH3)
- Two methyl groups?

No, that can't be right because CH(CH3) has three substituents. Wait, C2 is now CH(CH3)-, so it's connected to:

- C1: which is a CH2 group (since in succinic acid, it's CH2-CH2)
Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think in terms of the actual structure.

Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH.

When we make 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, the structure becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is a CH(CH3).

So for C2:

- One substituent is the adjacent CH(CH3) (C3)
- One substituent is the adjacent COOH group (C1)
- Two substituents are methyl groups?

No, that would make four substituents. Wait, no, a carbon can have four bonds. So C2 is connected to:

- One COOH group (from C1: the group is CH2-COOH if it's not substituted, but wait, no, in succinic acid, each CH2 is between two COOH groups. So when you add a methyl to C2, the structure becomes CH(CH3).

So C2 has:

- One methyl group (CH3)
- One CH(CH3) (from C3)
- One HOOC-CH2- group (from C1)
- One H?

Wait, no, that's four substituents. But in this case, the substituents would be: methyl, CH(CH3), COOH-CH2-, and another group? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 in the middle becomes CH(CH3), making each of those carbons a CH with three substituents. But wait, that can't be because each carbon in the chain must have four bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps each middle carbon is CH2(CH3), but that's not right. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

The main point is whether C2 and C3 are chiral centers. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents.

In this case, each of C2 and C3 has:

- One methyl group (CH3)
- Two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3 for C2; C2 and C4 for C3)
- And another substituent, perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, for C2:

If the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, then C2 is CH(CH3). So substituents are:

- COOH group on one side (from C1: maybe a CH2-COOH? Or is it directly attached?)
Wait, in succinic acid, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So when you add a methyl to C2 and C3, the structure becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of these middle carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to:

- One methyl group (CH3)
- One adjacent carbon (C3 for C2, C2 for C3)
- Two COOH groups? No, because each is only attached to one COOH group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine each of C2 and C3 as being CH(CH3) groups connected to a COOH on one side and another CH(CH3) on the other. So for C2:

- One substituent: methyl (CH3)
- Two substituents: adjacent carbons (C1 is CH2, but wait, no, in this case, C1 is a COOH group. Wait, no, in the modified structure, the CH2 groups are replaced by CH(CH3).

Wait, I'm getting stuck, maybe I should think about whether C2 and C3 are chiral.

In the original succinic acid, the middle CH2 groups are symmetric. Adding methyl groups on both C2 and C3 would make the molecule symmetric if the configurations are the same. But in this case, the configurations are R and S. So the molecule would have two chiral centers, but perhaps it's a meso compound. Because if the two stereocenters are mirror images, the molecule could be achiral.

Wait, let me think: if the two stereocenters are in R and S configurations, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound. So, for example, in tartaric acid, the meso form has two stereocenters with opposite configurations and a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So in (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and thus not chiral, hence not optically active. Alternatively, without a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The two middle carbons are C2 and C3. Let me draw the structure: 

- C1: COOH
- C2: CH(CH3) (R configuration)
- C3: CH(CH3) (S configuration)
- C4: COOH

Wait, but the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3, because the substituents on both are the same. So if C2 is R and C3 is S, but each has the same substituents (CH3 and two CH groups), then the molecule might be a meso compound, making it achiral. So this compound would not be optically active.

Wait, but wait: the substituents on C2 and C3 are the same, but their configurations are R and S. So if the two stereocenters are mirror images, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. For example, in meso-tartaric acid, the two stereocenters are R and S, and the molecule is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry.

In this case, since the substituents on C2 and C3 are both CH(CH3), the same, then if their configurations are R and S, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and thus not chiral. Therefore, this compound is not optically active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
   So here, both C2 and C3 are R configuration. Since the substituents on both carbons are the same (CH3 and the same adjacent groups), and both are R, does this lead to a chiral molecule?

In this case, the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry because both stereocenters are the same. So the two R configurations would make the molecule chiral. Therefore, this compound is optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol
   The structure is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at position 1 and a double bond at position 3. The configuration is R.

Wait, cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have the OH group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. The question is whether this molecule has a chiral center. The OH is on C1, which is connected to the cyclohexene ring. If the substituents on C1 are four different groups, then it's a chiral center.

So C1 is connected to:

- The cyclohexene ring (which is a cyclic structure)
- An OH group
- Two other substituents (like CH2 groups or other carbons)

Wait, in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the structure is a six-membered ring with double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH on C1.

Let me imagine the structure. C1 is attached to the ring, an OH, and two other ring carbons. Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two ring carbons. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6. So the substituents on C1 are:

- OH
- C2 (which is CH2)
- C6 (which is CH2)
- The ring itself (which is a cyclohexene ring, but for the purpose of substituents, perhaps it's considered as part of the structure).

Wait, but in reality, the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (C2 and C6)
- And the rest of the ring (the rest would be a cyclohexene ring, but perhaps that's considered as part of the same structure, so the substituents are OH, CH2-CH2 (from C2), CH2-CH2 (from C6), and the double bond in the ring.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about whether C1 has four different substituents. If C1 has:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6)
- And a bridge to the double bond (C3 and C4), but perhaps that's part of the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (from adjacent carbons)
- And a bridge to the rest of the ring, which is a double bond.

But wait, in that case, perhaps the substituents are not all different. For example, if C1 is connected to two identical groups (like two CH2's), then it wouldn't have four different substituents, making it not a chiral center.

Wait, but in cyclohexene, the ring is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6, each of which is a CH2 group if the double bond is between C3 and C4.

So, the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- C2 (CH2-CH2-)
- C6 (CH2-CH2-)
- And the rest of the ring, which might involve a bridge to C3 and C4 (but I'm not sure).

Alternatively, perhaps there's another substituent. Wait, no, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons in the ring. So C1 is bonded to C2 and C6, each of which is a CH2 group. If the double bond is between C3 and C4, then C3 and C4 are each bonded to each other and to C2 and C5 (for C3) and C4 and C5 and C6 (for C4) or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong, but let me think about whether C1 has four different substituents. If C1 has OH, two CH2 groups, and perhaps another substituent from the ring, maybe the substituents are different enough.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (but perhaps one is on a bridge and the other is on a different bridge, making them different)
- And the ring itself, which might have a different arrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are:

- OH
- CH2-CH2- (from C2)
- CH2-CH2- (from C6)
- And the double bond in the ring, which could be considered as a substituent.

Wait, but if the substituents are not all different, then C1 won't be a chiral center. Suppose C2 and C6 are CH2 groups, then C1's substituents would be OH, two CH2 groups, and the ring. But if the two CH2 groups are identical (same substituents on their other ends), then C1 wouldn't have four different groups. So in that case, it's not a chiral center, and the molecule isn't optically active.

Wait, but in the (R) configuration, the molecule is specified as R, which suggests that there is a chiral center. So perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe C1 does have four different substituents. Let me think again.

If the cyclohexene has the double bond between C3 and C4, then the ring is arranged such that C1 is connected to C2 and C6. If the substituents on C2 and C6 are different, then C1 would have four different groups.

Wait, but in cyclohexene, the substituents on C2 and C6 would be CH2 groups, each connected to C3 and C1 (for C2) and C5 and C1 (for C6). Wait, perhaps that's not the case. Maybe C2 is connected to C1 and C3, and C6 is connected to C1 and C5.

If the substituents on C2 and C6 are different (like one is connected to the double bond and the other isn't), then the CH2 groups would be different, making the substituents on C1 different.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C2 and C6 are the same, making the substituents on C1 not all different.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Since the molecule is (R)-configured, I think it must have a chiral center, so it's optically active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol
   So this is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5, all in the s configuration.

The question is whether this molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, whether it has any chiral centers.

Each of the OH groups is on a carbon that's part of the ring. Let's think about the substituents. For each OH-bearing carbon (C1, C3, C5), are the substituents four different groups?

C1: connected to C6 and C2. The substituents would be:

- OH
- C6
- C2
- And another substituent, perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons and two substituents (like H or OH). So in this case, each OH is on a carbon that's connected to two other ring carbons and an OH and a hydrogen.

Wait, but for a chiral center, you need four different substituents. If the substituents on C1 are OH, C6, C2, and H, then are they all different? If C6 and C2 are different, then yes. But in a cyclohexane ring, C2 and C6 might be equivalent due to symmetry.

Wait, but in a 1,3,5-triol, the three OH groups are positioned every other carbon, creating a sort of trigonal symmetry. So the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, if the configurations are all the same (s), perhaps the molecule has no plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, but the compound is (1s,3s,5s), which could imply that each of these positions has the same configuration, but if the ring is symmetric, the molecule might be achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the arrangement of the OH groups breaks any symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. For example, in a cyclohexane ring with three substituents at 1,3,5 positions, perhaps it's symmetric. So if the substituents are all the same, the molecule might be meso, thus achiral.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps each OH is on a chiral center, leading to a chiral molecule.

Wait, let's imagine the molecule. If the three OH groups are on carbons 1,3,5 of a cyclohexane ring, each with the same configuration (s), then whether the molecule is chiral depends on the symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be achiral. But if the arrangement of substituents doesn't allow for a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is similar to inositol, which has multiple hydroxyl groups. For example, myo-inositol has six OH groups, but it's meso and not chiral. However, this molecule has only three OH groups. If the positions are symmetric, maybe it's a meso compound.

Wait, but with three OH groups at 1,3,5 positions, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, perhaps it's a chiral molecule.

I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe it's better to think about whether the molecule has any chiral centers. If each of C1, C3, and C5 has four different substituents, then they are chiral centers. But if the molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry, it could be a meso compound, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has no plane of symmetry, so it's chiral and thus optically active.

But I'm not entirely confident. I'll tentatively mark this as optically active.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one
   The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of a butan-1-one (which is a four-carbon chain with a ketone at C1). So the structure is (cyclopentyl)C(O)CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, butan-1-one is (CH3)2CHCOCH3? No, wait, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO. Wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO, but more accurately, it's:

O
||
C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. No, correction: butanone can be either 2-butanone (most common) or 1-butanone, which is CH2CH2CH2CO. But 1-butanone is less stable, but for the sake of this problem, let's proceed.

So the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Structure:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH2CH3)(CH(CH3))

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2?

Wait, no, the butanone is four carbons in total, with the ketone on C1. So the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3)

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The structure is:

The ketone is on C1, which is connected to a cyclopentyl group and a CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group? Or perhaps it's:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3)

Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CH2-CO. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH2CH2CH3) ?

No, perhaps it's more like:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, but the key point is whether there's a chiral center in the molecule.

Looking for a carbon with four different substituents. The carbonyl group (C=O) is on C1, which is connected to the cyclopentyl group and a CH2 group (which then leads to CH(CH3) and another CH2). So C2 would be connected to C1 (CO), C3, and two CH2 groups. Hmm, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a branch that introduces a chiral center. For example, the 3-methyl group is on C3, which is connected to C2 and C4. If C3 has four different substituents, then it's a chiral center.

Wait, let's think about the structure:

The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So butan-1-one is:

O
||
C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

But in this case, the C1 is connected to a cyclopentyl group and a CH2 group. Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. So the ketone is at the end.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH2CH(CH3)CH3)

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH2CH(CH3))

Wait, perhaps the molecule is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3)

But I'm not certain. The key is to find if any carbon (other than the carbonyl C) has four different substituents.

The carbonyl carbon (C1) is double-bonded to O and connected to the cyclopentyl group and a CH2 group. But the carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and can't be a chiral center.

The next carbon (C2) is connected to C1 (CO), C3, and two CH2 groups. If those substituents are the same, then C2 isn't a chiral center.

C3 has a methyl group (CH(CH3)), so the substituents would be:

- C2
- C4
- CH3
- And another substituent.

If C4 is a CH3 or another group, perhaps C3 is connected to four different groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's structure is such that C3 (the one with the methyl) has four different substituents, making it a chiral center.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the substituents. Suppose the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

So, the carbonyl is at C1, connected to cyclopentyl and a CH2 group. The CH2 is connected to C2, which is connected to C3 (CH(CH3)), and C4 (CH2CH3).

So C3 is connected to:

- C2 (which is CH2-)
- C4 (which is CH2CH3)
- CH3
- And perhaps another substituent, like a hydrogen.

Wait, no, C3 would have:

- C2 (CH2-)
- C4 (CH2CH3)
- CH3
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, so the substituents on C3 would be:

- CH2- (from C2)
- CH2CH3 (from C4)
- CH3
- H

Are these all different? Yes. So C3 would have four different substituents, making it a chiral center. Therefore, this compound is optically active.

Wait, but wait: in reality, the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1, and the methyl is at position 3. The structure would be:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

So C3 (the CH(CH3)) is connected to:

- C2 (CH2-)
- C4 (CH2CH3)
- CH3
- H

So yes, four different substituents. Therefore, C3 is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and thus optically active.

Now, let's go back and tally each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene → I'm not sure. Earlier, I thought it might not be chiral because of a possible plane of symmetry, but perhaps I was wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate. If the molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, let me think about whether it has a chiral center. The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2-CH3? No, wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons: CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but with a double bond. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, in this structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and then C3 is CH2, and C4 is CH3. But wait, but that's only four carbons. Let me correct:

The structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2-CH3? Or CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, and 2-methyl would be CH(CH3) on C2.

So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, no, that's not possible because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2.

So, C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and C3 is CH2.

Wait, but in that structure, C2 has a double bond to C3. So C2 is CH(CH3)=CH2. Now, does any carbon have four different substituents?

C2 is double bonded, so it's sp² hybridized and can't be a chiral center. C1 has Cl, two CH2 groups, and perhaps a hydrogen. So four substituents, but are they all different? CH2Cl is attached to C1, which is connected to C2 (which is CH(CH3)), and two CH2 groups. So, substituents on C1 would be Cl, CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, and two H's. So maybe C1 has three substituents (Cl, CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, and two H's), which would not make it a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps C1 has Cl, two CH2 groups (but I think they're the same), and a hydrogen. So no, C1 wouldn't be a chiral center.

What about C3? C3 is CH2, so it's connected to C2 (CH(CH3)), C4 (CH3), and two H's. So substituents are CH(CH3), CH3, and two H's. Not four different, so no chiral center.

So this compound doesn't have a chiral center and is not optically active.

So now, let me go back and list each compound's optical activity:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene → No (no chiral center)
2. (3aR,7aS,E)... → Yes (has stereocenters)
3. (2R,3S)-dimethylsuccinic acid → No (meso compound)
4. (2R,3R)-dimethylsuccinic acid → Yes (chiral)
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol → Yes (chiral center)
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol → Not sure; earlier thought was yes, but I'm not confident. Let me think again.

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol with all s configurations. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. Alternatively, perhaps it's chiral. Alternatively, perhaps all three OH groups are on equivalent positions, making the molecule meso and thus achiral.

Wait, in a six-membered ring with OH groups at 1,3,5, and all in the same configuration (s), is the molecule chiral?

Yes, because it lacks a plane of symmetry. Because each OH is in a different position, and all have the same configuration, the molecule would be chiral. So it would exhibit optical activity.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one → Yes (chiral center at C3)

So tallying:

Yes: compounds 2,4,5,6,7 → that's five. But wait, earlier I thought 6 might be a meso compound, but perhaps it's not.

Wait, let me recheck. The (1s,3s,5s) configuration. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound, but perhaps it doesn't.

Alternatively, since the three OH groups are in symmetric positions but with the same configuration, the molecule may not have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

So, the yes count:

2 – yes
4 – yes
5 – yes
6 – yes
7 – yes

That's five, but earlier I thought 6 might be a meso compound, but perhaps it's not. So if 6 is yes, then total is 5.

But wait, let me think again about 6. The molecule is (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. If all three OH groups are in the same configuration, does it lead to a chiral molecule?

In a cyclohexane ring, 1,3,5-triol with all OHs in the same configuration (like all R or all S) would create a chiral molecule because there's no plane of symmetry. Because each OH is in a different position, their arrangement can't be mirrored. So yes, it would be chiral.

So the total number of optically active compounds is:

2: yes → 1
4: yes → 2
5: yes →3
6: yes →4
7: yes →5

Wait, but earlier I thought 6 is yes, leading to five. But looking back, I had:

1. No
2. Yes →1
3. No
4. Yes →2
5. Yes →3
6. Yes →4
7. Yes →5

So five compounds are optically active. But looking back at the options, option A is 5.

But wait, let me recount:

- 2: yes
-4: yes
-5: yes
-6: yes
-7: yes

That's five. So the answer would be 5, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought 6 was a yes, but perhaps I was wrong. Alternatively, perhaps 6 is a meso compound.

Wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's meso and not chiral. So if the (1s,3s,5s) configuration allows for a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound and not chiral.

But I'm not sure. Let me imagine the molecule. If the three OH groups are in positions 1,3,5 and all have the same configuration (s), perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the molecule is symmetric along a plane that passes through the center of the ring and the midpoints of opposite edges.

In such a case, the arrangement of the OH groups would mirror each other across that plane, making the molecule a meso compound and thus achiral.

If that's the case, then compound 6 is not optically active, reducing the count to four.

So let's recount:

1. No
2. Yes →1
3. No
4. Yes →2
5. Yes →3
6. No (meso)
7. Yes →4

So four compounds are optically active: 2,4,5,7. That's four, which is option D.

But wait, earlier I thought 6 was yes, but perhaps I was wrong. So which is it?

Alternatively, perhaps the (1s,3s,5s) configuration doesn't allow a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. So the count would be five.

But I'm not confident. Let me think of a simpler case. For example, if a molecule has three identical groups arranged symmetrically, it may be meso. But if the substituents are different, it may not be.

In this case, the substituents are all OH groups, which are identical. So if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be a meso compound.

For example, consider 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane. If all three methyl groups are on the same face (all R or all S), the molecule would be chiral. But if the configuration allows for a plane of symmetry, it would be meso.

Wait, but if the substituents are all the same (OH, in this case), the molecule may have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

Wait, another approach: the molecule has a center of symmetry. If the configuration around each OH is the same, but the overall molecule has a center of inversion, then it's a meso compound.

In this case, (1s,3s,5s) would imply that each of these positions is mirrored, leading to a meso form.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the arrangement of the OH groups doesn't allow for a plane of symmetry.

Given the confusion, perhaps I should look for another approach. The options given are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

If I consider that compound 6 is not optically active, then the answer would be D)4. But if it is, then it's A)5.

Another way: Let's list which compounds are definitely active.

Compound 2: yes (stereocenters)
Compound4: yes (chiral)
Compound5: yes (chiral)
Compound7: yes (chiral)
Compound6: uncertain

If 6 is no, then 4; if yes, then 5.

Wait, but looking for the correct answer, perhaps the correct count is 5.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again about each compound.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: no chiral center, so no.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)...: yes.
3. (2R,3S)-dimethylsuccinic acid: meso, so no.
4. (2R,3R)-dimethylsuccinic acid: yes.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: yes.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: maybe yes, maybe no.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: yes.

So if 6 is yes, total is 5; if no, 4.

I think I need to make a decision. Based on the analysis, I'll go with 5, so option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it has a chiral center (a carbon atom with four different substituents) and is not a meso compound (a compound with internal symmetry that makes it achiral despite having stereocenters).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound does not have a chiral center because the substituents on the carbons are not all different. The double bond introduces a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This compound contains stereocenters (R and S configurations) and does not have a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is chiral and optically active.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound has two stereocenters at positions 2 and 3. However, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and thus achiral.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound has two stereocenters at positions 2 and 3. Since both centers have the same configuration (R), the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group on carbon 1 is attached to a carbon with four different substituents (OH, two different ring carbons, and a hydrogen). This makes the carbon a chiral center, and the molecule is optically active.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Despite the stereocenters, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and thus achiral.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbon at position 3 has four different substituents (a methyl group, a hydrogen, and two different alkyl chains). This makes it a chiral center, and the molecule is optically active.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

### Final Count of Optically Active Compounds:
- **Optically active compounds:** 2, 4, 5, 7  
- **Total optically active compounds:** 4  

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in different compounds. I'm a bit rusty on my stereochemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity. There are seven compounds listed, and the options are from A to D, with the answers ranging from 2 to 5. I need to evaluate each compound one by one.

First, let me recall what makes a compound optically active. A compound is optically active if it has chirality, meaning it has a chiral center (a carbon with four different substituents) and isn't a meso compound, which can have identical mirror images and thus not be chiral overall. Also, compounds with plane or center of symmetry might not be chiral, so I should check for that.

Let's list the compounds and analyze each:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene
   Structure: The double bond is at position 1-2. Chlorine is on C1, methyl on C2. Wait, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, but in this case, it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure would be Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon. But the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Hmm, no, wait: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, and a methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl attached to the double-bonded carbon. Because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would replace one H on C1. So the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first carbon, which is CH2. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons, so positions 1,2,3,4. So 1-chloro is on the first carbon, which is part of the double bond. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, not that. Let me think again. The molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. The but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So chloro is on the first carbon, which is part of the double bond. So the structure is Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded to the second. So it's Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe it's Cl on the first carbon, which is double bonded to CH(CH3). So, perhaps Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, that can't be. Wait, but the position is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure is CH2(Cl)-CH2(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, wait, that can't be. Actually, wait, but it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, that's not right because of the double bond. Oh wait, wait, the but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl attached to the first CH2. So it's ClCH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-? No, wait, but 2-methyl would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? But wait, but that can't be because the double bond is between 1 and 2, so it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have Cl on C1 and CH3 on C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or perhaps it's Cl on the first carbon of the double bond, which is CH2Cl. So the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that doesn't have a double bond. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl attached to the first carbon, which is part of a double bond. So it's Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would make the double bond between C2 and C3, not C1 and C2. Oh, wait, no. Wait, but if it's but-1-ene, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure would be CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3 but that's not possible because but-1-ene has a double bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl on C1, and a methyl on C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's not considering the double bond. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about whether this compound has a chiral center.

Wait, if the compound is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, then the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl, two CH2 groups? Or wait, perhaps the structure is Cl attached to the first carbon, which is double bonded to the second. So the first carbon is CH2Cl, the second is CH(CH3), and the third and fourth are CH2 and CH3. But wait, perhaps it's more like CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would be three carbons, not four. No, but but is four carbons. So but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methyl would be Cl on the first CH2, and CH3 on the second CH. So the structure is ClCH2-CH(CH3)=CH2. But wait, that's only three carbons after the Cl. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The main point is whether this compound has a chiral center. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. But wait, how is that possible? Let me think about the structure. The molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the double bond is between C1 and C2. C1 has Cl and two CH2 groups? Or wait, perhaps C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and the other substituents are CH2 and CH3 on either side? Maybe the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's four carbons: Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with the double bond between C1 and C2. Hmm, perhaps the molecule is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that would be but-1-ene with substituents on C1 and C2. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong, but maybe the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2-CH3? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether this compound has a chiral center. For a chiral center, you need four different groups attached to a carbon. In this compound, perhaps the double bond is between C1 and C2, and C2 has a methyl group. But wait, if the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2, then C2 would have CH3, CH2Cl, and two CH2 groups on either side. Wait, no, perhaps C2 is attached to Cl, CH2CH3, CH(CH3), and another substituent? No, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the compound doesn't have a chiral center because the substituents are arranged symmetrically. Wait, but if it's (Z) configuration, maybe there's a plane of symmetry. For the (Z) isomer, the higher priority groups are on the same side. So, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So this compound might not be chiral, hence not optically active. Alternatively, maybe it does have a chiral center, but I'm not seeing it. Hmm. I'll mark this as a possible no for optical activity and come back to it.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione
   Wow, that's a mouthful. Let's break it down. The compound is a bicyclic structure. Methanoisobenzofuran suggests a fused ring system. It's a dione, so two ketone groups. The substituent is a chloromethylene group (CH2Cl) attached at position 8. The stereochemistry is given as (3aR,7aS,E). The E configuration refers to the double bond geometry.

Wait, the substituent is 8-(chloromethylene), which is a methylene group (CH2) with a Cl. So, the substituent is CH2Cl attached via a double bond? Or is it a substituent attached as a substituent in the ring? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the chloromethylene is part of a double bond in the structure. So, if the substituent has a double bond, then perhaps the molecule has a double bond with substituents that could lead to E or Z configuration.

But the key here is whether the molecule has a chiral center. If the ring structure has any stereocenters, then it could be chiral. The substituent might introduce a stereocenter. Alternatively, maybe the bicyclic system itself has symmetry. But given the substituent is chloromethylene and the stereochemistry is specified (R and S configurations), it suggests that the molecule has stereocenters, so it would be chiral. Therefore, this compound is optically active.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
   Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. In the 2 and 3 positions, each has a methyl group. The configuration is R and S.

So the molecule is HOOC-CH2(CH3)-CH2(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, wait, 2 and 3 positions in succinic acid are the two central CH2 groups. So, 2R,3S-dimethylsuccinic acid would have methyl groups on C2 and C3. So each of these carbons has two methyl groups? Or wait, no: each of C2 and C3 would have a methyl substituent.

Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would make it HOOC-CH2(CH3)-CH2(CH3)-COOH? No, wait, wait, 2 and 3 are the CH2 groups. So 2R would be CH(CH3)OH (no, wait, no, succinic acid is a diacid, so the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So the central two carbons are each CH2. When they're substituted with methyl, each becomes CH(CH3). So each of these carbons has two CH3 groups, a COOH group (on one end), and a CH(CH3) on the other. Wait, no. Let me think: each CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So C2 is CH(CH3), and C3 is CH(CH3). So each of these carbons has two methyl groups, so the substituents would be: for C2, the groups are (CH(CH3)), CH2CH2COOH, and perhaps others. Wait, no. Let's look at C2: it's CH(CH3) attached to C1 (which is COOH), and C3 (which is CH(CH3)), and two H's? No, wait, no. Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When we add a methyl to C2 and C3, each CH2 becomes CH(CH3). So each of these carbons (C2 and C3) now has:

C2: attached to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), two methyl groups? No, wait, C2 would have:

- One methyl group (CH3)
- Two CH2 groups (but no, because the other substituents are C1 and C3)

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me structure it:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH?

No, because 2 and 3 are adjacent. So it's HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has a methyl group. Now, each of these carbons has four substituents?

Wait, for C2: groups are:

- HOOC- (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Two CH3 groups?

Wait, no. No, because C2 is now CH(CH3), which has substituents: one methyl, one HOOC-CH2- group (wait, no). Let me think again.

The structure is:

HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)-COOH? No, that's not right because the middle two carbons are each CH(CH3). So, for C2, it's attached to:

- C1: HOOC-CH2- (no, wait, C1 is HOOC-, and C2 is CH(CH3), so C2 is connected to C1 (which is a COOH group), C3 (which is a CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups? Wait, no, because when we add a methyl to C2, it's CH(CH3), so each C2 and C3 has a methyl group.

Wait, perhaps I should count the substituents on C2. C2 is connected to:

- C1: which is a COOH group (so a carboxylic acid)
- C3: which is a CH(CH3)
- Two methyl groups?

No, that can't be right because CH(CH3) has three substituents. Wait, C2 is now CH(CH3)-, so it's connected to:

- C1: which is a CH2 group (since in succinic acid, it's CH2-CH2)
Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think in terms of the actual structure.

Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH.

When we make 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, the structure becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is a CH(CH3).

So for C2:

- One substituent is the adjacent CH(CH3) (C3)
- One substituent is the adjacent COOH group (C1)
- Two substituents are methyl groups?

No, that would make four substituents. Wait, no, a carbon can have four bonds. So C2 is connected to:

- One COOH group (from C1: the group is CH2-COOH if it's not substituted, but wait, no, in succinic acid, each CH2 is between two COOH groups. So when you add a methyl to C2, the structure becomes CH(CH3).

So C2 has:

- One methyl group (CH3)
- One CH(CH3) (from C3)
- One HOOC-CH2- group (from C1)
- One H?

Wait, no, that's four substituents. But in this case, the substituents would be: methyl, CH(CH3), COOH-CH2-, and another group? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps each CH2 in the middle becomes CH(CH3), making each of those carbons a CH with three substituents. But wait, that can't be because each carbon in the chain must have four bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps each middle carbon is CH2(CH3), but that's not right. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

The main point is whether C2 and C3 are chiral centers. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents.

In this case, each of C2 and C3 has:

- One methyl group (CH3)
- Two adjacent carbons (C1 and C3 for C2; C2 and C4 for C3)
- And another substituent, perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, for C2:

If the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, then C2 is CH(CH3). So substituents are:

- COOH group on one side (from C1: maybe a CH2-COOH? Or is it directly attached?)
Wait, in succinic acid, the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So when you add a methyl to C2 and C3, the structure becomes HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of these middle carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to:

- One methyl group (CH3)
- One adjacent carbon (C3 for C2, C2 for C3)
- Two COOH groups? No, because each is only attached to one COOH group.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine each of C2 and C3 as being CH(CH3) groups connected to a COOH on one side and another CH(CH3) on the other. So for C2:

- One substituent: methyl (CH3)
- Two substituents: adjacent carbons (C1 is CH2, but wait, no, in this case, C1 is a COOH group. Wait, no, in the modified structure, the CH2 groups are replaced by CH(CH3).

Wait, I'm getting stuck, maybe I should think about whether C2 and C3 are chiral.

In the original succinic acid, the middle CH2 groups are symmetric. Adding methyl groups on both C2 and C3 would make the molecule symmetric if the configurations are the same. But in this case, the configurations are R and S. So the molecule would have two chiral centers, but perhaps it's a meso compound. Because if the two stereocenters are mirror images, the molecule could be achiral.

Wait, let me think: if the two stereocenters are in R and S configurations, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound. So, for example, in tartaric acid, the meso form has two stereocenters with opposite configurations and a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

So in (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and thus not chiral, hence not optically active. Alternatively, without a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

Wait, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. The two middle carbons are C2 and C3. Let me draw the structure: 

- C1: COOH
- C2: CH(CH3) (R configuration)
- C3: CH(CH3) (S configuration)
- C4: COOH

Wait, but the molecule would have a plane of symmetry between C2 and C3, because the substituents on both are the same. So if C2 is R and C3 is S, but each has the same substituents (CH3 and two CH groups), then the molecule might be a meso compound, making it achiral. So this compound would not be optically active.

Wait, but wait: the substituents on C2 and C3 are the same, but their configurations are R and S. So if the two stereocenters are mirror images, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. For example, in meso-tartaric acid, the two stereocenters are R and S, and the molecule is achiral because it has a plane of symmetry.

In this case, since the substituents on C2 and C3 are both CH(CH3), the same, then if their configurations are R and S, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and thus not chiral. Therefore, this compound is not optically active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid
   So here, both C2 and C3 are R configuration. Since the substituents on both carbons are the same (CH3 and the same adjacent groups), and both are R, does this lead to a chiral molecule?

In this case, the molecule would not have a plane of symmetry because both stereocenters are the same. So the two R configurations would make the molecule chiral. Therefore, this compound is optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol
   The structure is a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group at position 1 and a double bond at position 3. The configuration is R.

Wait, cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have the OH group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. The question is whether this molecule has a chiral center. The OH is on C1, which is connected to the cyclohexene ring. If the substituents on C1 are four different groups, then it's a chiral center.

So C1 is connected to:

- The cyclohexene ring (which is a cyclic structure)
- An OH group
- Two other substituents (like CH2 groups or other carbons)

Wait, in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the structure is a six-membered ring with double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH on C1.

Let me imagine the structure. C1 is attached to the ring, an OH, and two other ring carbons. Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two ring carbons. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6. So the substituents on C1 are:

- OH
- C2 (which is CH2)
- C6 (which is CH2)
- The ring itself (which is a cyclohexene ring, but for the purpose of substituents, perhaps it's considered as part of the structure).

Wait, but in reality, the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (C2 and C6)
- And the rest of the ring (the rest would be a cyclohexene ring, but perhaps that's considered as part of the same structure, so the substituents are OH, CH2-CH2 (from C2), CH2-CH2 (from C6), and the double bond in the ring.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about whether C1 has four different substituents. If C1 has:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6)
- And a bridge to the double bond (C3 and C4), but perhaps that's part of the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (from adjacent carbons)
- And a bridge to the rest of the ring, which is a double bond.

But wait, in that case, perhaps the substituents are not all different. For example, if C1 is connected to two identical groups (like two CH2's), then it wouldn't have four different substituents, making it not a chiral center.

Wait, but in cyclohexene, the ring is a six-membered ring with one double bond. So C1 is connected to C2 and C6, each of which is a CH2 group if the double bond is between C3 and C4.

So, the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- C2 (CH2-CH2-)
- C6 (CH2-CH2-)
- And the rest of the ring, which might involve a bridge to C3 and C4 (but I'm not sure).

Alternatively, perhaps there's another substituent. Wait, no, in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons in the ring. So C1 is bonded to C2 and C6, each of which is a CH2 group. If the double bond is between C3 and C4, then C3 and C4 are each bonded to each other and to C2 and C5 (for C3) and C4 and C5 and C6 (for C4) or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong, but let me think about whether C1 has four different substituents. If C1 has OH, two CH2 groups, and perhaps another substituent from the ring, maybe the substituents are different enough.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (but perhaps one is on a bridge and the other is on a different bridge, making them different)
- And the ring itself, which might have a different arrangement.

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are:

- OH
- CH2-CH2- (from C2)
- CH2-CH2- (from C6)
- And the double bond in the ring, which could be considered as a substituent.

Wait, but if the substituents are not all different, then C1 won't be a chiral center. Suppose C2 and C6 are CH2 groups, then C1's substituents would be OH, two CH2 groups, and the ring. But if the two CH2 groups are identical (same substituents on their other ends), then C1 wouldn't have four different groups. So in that case, it's not a chiral center, and the molecule isn't optically active.

Wait, but in the (R) configuration, the molecule is specified as R, which suggests that there is a chiral center. So perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe C1 does have four different substituents. Let me think again.

If the cyclohexene has the double bond between C3 and C4, then the ring is arranged such that C1 is connected to C2 and C6. If the substituents on C2 and C6 are different, then C1 would have four different groups.

Wait, but in cyclohexene, the substituents on C2 and C6 would be CH2 groups, each connected to C3 and C1 (for C2) and C5 and C1 (for C6). Wait, perhaps that's not the case. Maybe C2 is connected to C1 and C3, and C6 is connected to C1 and C5.

If the substituents on C2 and C6 are different (like one is connected to the double bond and the other isn't), then the CH2 groups would be different, making the substituents on C1 different.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on C2 and C6 are the same, making the substituents on C1 not all different.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Since the molecule is (R)-configured, I think it must have a chiral center, so it's optically active.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol
   So this is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5, all in the s configuration.

The question is whether this molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, whether it has any chiral centers.

Each of the OH groups is on a carbon that's part of the ring. Let's think about the substituents. For each OH-bearing carbon (C1, C3, C5), are the substituents four different groups?

C1: connected to C6 and C2. The substituents would be:

- OH
- C6
- C2
- And another substituent, perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, but in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons and two substituents (like H or OH). So in this case, each OH is on a carbon that's connected to two other ring carbons and an OH and a hydrogen.

Wait, but for a chiral center, you need four different substituents. If the substituents on C1 are OH, C6, C2, and H, then are they all different? If C6 and C2 are different, then yes. But in a cyclohexane ring, C2 and C6 might be equivalent due to symmetry.

Wait, but in a 1,3,5-triol, the three OH groups are positioned every other carbon, creating a sort of trigonal symmetry. So the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Alternatively, if the configurations are all the same (s), perhaps the molecule has no plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

Wait, but the compound is (1s,3s,5s), which could imply that each of these positions has the same configuration, but if the ring is symmetric, the molecule might be achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the arrangement of the OH groups breaks any symmetry.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has a center of symmetry. For example, in a cyclohexane ring with three substituents at 1,3,5 positions, perhaps it's symmetric. So if the substituents are all the same, the molecule might be meso, thus achiral.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps each OH is on a chiral center, leading to a chiral molecule.

Wait, let's imagine the molecule. If the three OH groups are on carbons 1,3,5 of a cyclohexane ring, each with the same configuration (s), then whether the molecule is chiral depends on the symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be achiral. But if the arrangement of substituents doesn't allow for a plane of symmetry, it would be chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is similar to inositol, which has multiple hydroxyl groups. For example, myo-inositol has six OH groups, but it's meso and not chiral. However, this molecule has only three OH groups. If the positions are symmetric, maybe it's a meso compound.

Wait, but with three OH groups at 1,3,5 positions, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold symmetry, making it achiral. Alternatively, perhaps it's a chiral molecule.

I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe it's better to think about whether the molecule has any chiral centers. If each of C1, C3, and C5 has four different substituents, then they are chiral centers. But if the molecule as a whole has a plane of symmetry, it could be a meso compound, making it achiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has no plane of symmetry, so it's chiral and thus optically active.

But I'm not entirely confident. I'll tentatively mark this as optically active.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one
   The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of a butan-1-one (which is a four-carbon chain with a ketone at C1). So the structure is (cyclopentyl)C(O)CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, butan-1-one is (CH3)2CHCOCH3? No, wait, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2CO. Wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3CO, but more accurately, it's:

O
||
C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. No, correction: butanone can be either 2-butanone (most common) or 1-butanone, which is CH2CH2CH2CO. But 1-butanone is less stable, but for the sake of this problem, let's proceed.

So the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Structure:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH2CH3)(CH(CH3))

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2?

Wait, no, the butanone is four carbons in total, with the ketone on C1. So the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3)

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The structure is:

The ketone is on C1, which is connected to a cyclopentyl group and a CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group? Or perhaps it's:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3)

Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CH2-CO. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH2CH2CH3) ?

No, perhaps it's more like:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, but the key point is whether there's a chiral center in the molecule.

Looking for a carbon with four different substituents. The carbonyl group (C=O) is on C1, which is connected to the cyclopentyl group and a CH2 group (which then leads to CH(CH3) and another CH2). So C2 would be connected to C1 (CO), C3, and two CH2 groups. Hmm, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a branch that introduces a chiral center. For example, the 3-methyl group is on C3, which is connected to C2 and C4. If C3 has four different substituents, then it's a chiral center.

Wait, let's think about the structure:

The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So butan-1-one is:

O
||
C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

But in this case, the C1 is connected to a cyclopentyl group and a CH2 group. Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. So the ketone is at the end.

So the structure would be:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH2CH(CH3)CH3)

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH2CH(CH3))

Wait, perhaps the molecule is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3)

But I'm not certain. The key is to find if any carbon (other than the carbonyl C) has four different substituents.

The carbonyl carbon (C1) is double-bonded to O and connected to the cyclopentyl group and a CH2 group. But the carbonyl carbon is sp² hybridized and can't be a chiral center.

The next carbon (C2) is connected to C1 (CO), C3, and two CH2 groups. If those substituents are the same, then C2 isn't a chiral center.

C3 has a methyl group (CH(CH3)), so the substituents would be:

- C2
- C4
- CH3
- And another substituent.

If C4 is a CH3 or another group, perhaps C3 is connected to four different groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule's structure is such that C3 (the one with the methyl) has four different substituents, making it a chiral center.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the substituents. Suppose the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

So, the carbonyl is at C1, connected to cyclopentyl and a CH2 group. The CH2 is connected to C2, which is connected to C3 (CH(CH3)), and C4 (CH2CH3).

So C3 is connected to:

- C2 (which is CH2-)
- C4 (which is CH2CH3)
- CH3
- And perhaps another substituent, like a hydrogen.

Wait, no, C3 would have:

- C2 (CH2-)
- C4 (CH2CH3)
- CH3
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, so the substituents on C3 would be:

- CH2- (from C2)
- CH2CH3 (from C4)
- CH3
- H

Are these all different? Yes. So C3 would have four different substituents, making it a chiral center. Therefore, this compound is optically active.

Wait, but wait: in reality, the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the ketone is at position 1, and the methyl is at position 3. The structure would be:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3

So C3 (the CH(CH3)) is connected to:

- C2 (CH2-)
- C4 (CH2CH3)
- CH3
- H

So yes, four different substituents. Therefore, C3 is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and thus optically active.

Now, let's go back and tally each compound:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene → I'm not sure. Earlier, I thought it might not be chiral because of a possible plane of symmetry, but perhaps I was wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should reevaluate. If the molecule is (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, let me think about whether it has a chiral center. The structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2-CH3? No, wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons: CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3, but with a double bond. So the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, in this structure, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and then C3 is CH2, and C4 is CH3. But wait, but that's only four carbons. Let me correct:

The structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2-CH3? Or CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, and 2-methyl would be CH(CH3) on C2.

So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So it's Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, no, that's not possible because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, so 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)=CH2.

So, C1 is CH2Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and C3 is CH2.

Wait, but in that structure, C2 has a double bond to C3. So C2 is CH(CH3)=CH2. Now, does any carbon have four different substituents?

C2 is double bonded, so it's sp² hybridized and can't be a chiral center. C1 has Cl, two CH2 groups, and perhaps a hydrogen. So four substituents, but are they all different? CH2Cl is attached to C1, which is connected to C2 (which is CH(CH3)), and two CH2 groups. So, substituents on C1 would be Cl, CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, and two H's. So maybe C1 has three substituents (Cl, CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, and two H's), which would not make it a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps C1 has Cl, two CH2 groups (but I think they're the same), and a hydrogen. So no, C1 wouldn't be a chiral center.

What about C3? C3 is CH2, so it's connected to C2 (CH(CH3)), C4 (CH3), and two H's. So substituents are CH(CH3), CH3, and two H's. Not four different, so no chiral center.

So this compound doesn't have a chiral center and is not optically active.

So now, let me go back and list each compound's optical activity:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene → No (no chiral center)
2. (3aR,7aS,E)... → Yes (has stereocenters)
3. (2R,3S)-dimethylsuccinic acid → No (meso compound)
4. (2R,3R)-dimethylsuccinic acid → Yes (chiral)
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol → Yes (chiral center)
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol → Not sure; earlier thought was yes, but I'm not confident. Let me think again.

Wait, cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol with all s configurations. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral. Alternatively, perhaps it's chiral. Alternatively, perhaps all three OH groups are on equivalent positions, making the molecule meso and thus achiral.

Wait, in a six-membered ring with OH groups at 1,3,5, and all in the same configuration (s), is the molecule chiral?

Yes, because it lacks a plane of symmetry. Because each OH is in a different position, and all have the same configuration, the molecule would be chiral. So it would exhibit optical activity.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one → Yes (chiral center at C3)

So tallying:

Yes: compounds 2,4,5,6,7 → that's five. But wait, earlier I thought 6 might be a meso compound, but perhaps it's not.

Wait, let me recheck. The (1s,3s,5s) configuration. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound, but perhaps it doesn't.

Alternatively, since the three OH groups are in symmetric positions but with the same configuration, the molecule may not have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral.

So, the yes count:

2 – yes
4 – yes
5 – yes
6 – yes
7 – yes

That's five, but earlier I thought 6 might be a meso compound, but perhaps it's not. So if 6 is yes, then total is 5.

But wait, let me think again about 6. The molecule is (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. If all three OH groups are in the same configuration, does it lead to a chiral molecule?

In a cyclohexane ring, 1,3,5-triol with all OHs in the same configuration (like all R or all S) would create a chiral molecule because there's no plane of symmetry. Because each OH is in a different position, their arrangement can't be mirrored. So yes, it would be chiral.

So the total number of optically active compounds is:

2: yes → 1
4: yes → 2
5: yes →3
6: yes →4
7: yes →5

Wait, but earlier I thought 6 is yes, leading to five. But looking back, I had:

1. No
2. Yes →1
3. No
4. Yes →2
5. Yes →3
6. Yes →4
7. Yes →5

So five compounds are optically active. But looking back at the options, option A is 5.

But wait, let me recount:

- 2: yes
-4: yes
-5: yes
-6: yes
-7: yes

That's five. So the answer would be 5, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought 6 was a yes, but perhaps I was wrong. Alternatively, perhaps 6 is a meso compound.

Wait, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's meso and not chiral. So if the (1s,3s,5s) configuration allows for a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound and not chiral.

But I'm not sure. Let me imagine the molecule. If the three OH groups are in positions 1,3,5 and all have the same configuration (s), perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. For example, if the molecule is symmetric along a plane that passes through the center of the ring and the midpoints of opposite edges.

In such a case, the arrangement of the OH groups would mirror each other across that plane, making the molecule a meso compound and thus achiral.

If that's the case, then compound 6 is not optically active, reducing the count to four.

So let's recount:

1. No
2. Yes →1
3. No
4. Yes →2
5. Yes →3
6. No (meso)
7. Yes →4

So four compounds are optically active: 2,4,5,7. That's four, which is option D.

But wait, earlier I thought 6 was yes, but perhaps I was wrong. So which is it?

Alternatively, perhaps the (1s,3s,5s) configuration doesn't allow a plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. So the count would be five.

But I'm not confident. Let me think of a simpler case. For example, if a molecule has three identical groups arranged symmetrically, it may be meso. But if the substituents are different, it may not be.

In this case, the substituents are all OH groups, which are identical. So if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it would be a meso compound.

For example, consider 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane. If all three methyl groups are on the same face (all R or all S), the molecule would be chiral. But if the configuration allows for a plane of symmetry, it would be meso.

Wait, but if the substituents are all the same (OH, in this case), the molecule may have a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound.

Wait, another approach: the molecule has a center of symmetry. If the configuration around each OH is the same, but the overall molecule has a center of inversion, then it's a meso compound.

In this case, (1s,3s,5s) would imply that each of these positions is mirrored, leading to a meso form.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the arrangement of the OH groups doesn't allow for a plane of symmetry.

Given the confusion, perhaps I should look for another approach. The options given are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

If I consider that compound 6 is not optically active, then the answer would be D)4. But if it is, then it's A)5.

Another way: Let's list which compounds are definitely active.

Compound 2: yes (stereocenters)
Compound4: yes (chiral)
Compound5: yes (chiral)
Compound7: yes (chiral)
Compound6: uncertain

If 6 is no, then 4; if yes, then 5.

Wait, but looking for the correct answer, perhaps the correct count is 5.

But I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again about each compound.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: no chiral center, so no.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)...: yes.
3. (2R,3S)-dimethylsuccinic acid: meso, so no.
4. (2R,3R)-dimethylsuccinic acid: yes.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: yes.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: maybe yes, maybe no.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: yes.

So if 6 is yes, total is 5; if no, 4.

I think I need to make a decision. Based on the analysis, I'll go with 5, so option A.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is optically active if it has a chiral center (a carbon atom with four different substituents) and is not a meso compound (a compound with internal symmetry that makes it achiral despite having stereocenters).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound does not have a chiral center because the substituents on the carbons are not all different. The double bond introduces a plane of symmetry, making the molecule achiral.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This compound contains stereocenters (R and S configurations) and does not have a plane of symmetry. Therefore, it is chiral and optically active.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound has two stereocenters at positions 2 and 3. However, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and thus achiral.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound has two stereocenters at positions 2 and 3. Since both centers have the same configuration (R), the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry and is therefore chiral.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   The hydroxyl group on carbon 1 is attached to a carbon with four different substituents (OH, two different ring carbons, and a hydrogen). This makes the carbon a chiral center, and the molecule is optically active.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has hydroxyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. Despite the stereocenters, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and thus achiral.  
   **Optical activity:** No.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   The carbon at position 3 has four different substituents (a methyl group, a hydrogen, and two different alkyl chains). This makes it a chiral center, and the molecule is optically active.  
   **Optical activity:** Yes.

### Final Count of Optically Active Compounds:
- **Optically active compounds:** 2, 4, 5, 7  
- **Total optically active compounds:** 4
