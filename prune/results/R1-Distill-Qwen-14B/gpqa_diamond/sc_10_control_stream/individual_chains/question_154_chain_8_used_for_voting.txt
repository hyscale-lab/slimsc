Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on its spectral data. Let's go through the information step by step.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. There's also a peak at m/z 158 at 32%. Hmm, so the molecular weight is likely 156. The 158 could be an isotope peak. Chlorine has an atomic weight around 35.5, so if the molecule has a Cl, the molecular ion would have two peaks: one for Cl-35 and another for Cl-37. Wait, but 156 and 158 differ by 2, which makes sense because Cl has two main isotopes, 35Cl and 37Cl, each contributing to the mass. So the M peak is at 156, so the molecular formula probably includes Cl. Let me calculate.

If the molecular weight is 156, and assuming it's C8H5ClO3? Let me check: C is 12, H is 1, Cl is 35, O is 16. So 8*12=96, 5*1=5, 35=35, 3*16=48. Adding them up: 96+5=101, 101+35=136, 136+48=184. No, that's too high. Hmm, maybe a different formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate: 7*12=84, 5=5, Cl=35, 2*16=32. 84+5=89 +35=124 +32=156. Yes, that adds up. So the formula could be C7H5ClO2. Alternatively, maybe something else. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is Cl attached to ring at position 3, hydroxy at 2, and aldehyde at 1. The formula would be C7H5ClO2. That fits.

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid. That's Cl in position 4, COOH group. So formula is C7H5ClO2 as well. Because benzoic acid is C7H6O2, but with Cl replacing a H, so C7H5ClO2.

C) Phenyl chloroformate. That would be OCl-CO-O-Ph. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the formula would be C6H5O2ClCO2? Wait, no. Let me think. The chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-R. So R is phenyl (C6H5O), so the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Wait, no, wait. Let me compute: COOCl attached to phenyl. So the entire molecule is C6H5-O-CO-Cl. So the formula is C7H5ClO2. Yes, same as before.

D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Cl at position 2, benzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as B.

So all options except maybe C have the same formula? Or wait, let me check. Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So the formula is C6H5O2CCl? Wait, no. Let's compute: C6H5-O-CO-Cl. The CO is carbonyl, so the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Because O is in COO: C6H5-O-CO-Cl is C7H5ClO2. So all options have the same formula, which adds up to 156.

Hmm, so the molecular ion is 156. The other peak is 158, which is probably the Cl isotope. So molecular formula is C7H5ClO2.

Next, let's look at the IR data. It shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. But in the options, looking for O-H. But wait, the peak at 1720 cm^-1 is strong and sharp. That suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have strong O-H stretch (broad) and a carbonyl around 1700, but their O-H is usually a broad peak around 2500-3300 cm^-1. Wait, in the IR, the problem states a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That's a wide region. It might be an O-H stretch, but another possibility is an N-H, but since we have Cl and O, perhaps it's an O-H.

Wait, but the other part is a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. So that's a carbonyl, maybe an ester, or acid, or aldehyde. Let me think: a carboxylic acid's carbonyl is around 1700, but sometimes lower? Aromatic esters or aldehydes would be higher, maybe. For example, an aldehyde's carbonyl is around 1720, higher than a ketone or ester perhaps.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The carbonyl (C=O) stretching frequencies in IR:

- Aldehydes: ~1720 cm^-1
- Ketones: ~1715 cm^-1
- Carboxylic acids: ~1700 cm^-1 (but can vary)
- Esters: ~1740-1720 cm^-1
- Amides: lower, like ~1650-1700.

So the 1720 peak here could be an aldehyde or an ester. But the presence of a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 is more consistent with an O-H group, like in a carboxylic acid, phenol, or maybe an aldehyde with some hydrogen bonding.

Wait, but an aldehyde's O-H is usually not present. Wait, no, aldehydes don't have O-H. So the O-H would be in a carboxylic acid, phenol, or maybe an alcohol. But the options:

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: has a hydroxyl group and an aldehyde. So O-H (phenol) and aldehyde.

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), so strong O-H (broad) and a carbonyl.

C) Phenyl chloroformate: structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So it's an ester, but no O-H. Wait, unless it's an acid chloride. Oh, wait, it's a chloroformate, which is an acid chloride derivative. So the structure is Ph-O-CO-Cl. So no O-H groups except perhaps if it's a different structure, but I think it's O connected to COCl. So maybe no O-H. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl-CO-O-Ph, which would have no O-H.

D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: same as B, but Cl is in position 2.

So looking at the IR:

- Broad peak 3500-2700: suggests O-H stretching. So that would be present in A (phenolic O-H), B, and D (carboxylic O-H), but not in C.

Then the 1720 cm^-1 is the carbonyl. For A, the aldehyde would have a strong peak around 1720. For B and D, the carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl around 1700, maybe a bit higher depending on substitution. For C, the ester or acid chloride would have a higher carbonyl, like around 1740-1760, perhaps.

So the 1720 is a bit higher than typical for a carboxylic acid (which is around 1700), so that could suggest an ester or an aldehyde. But in the options, only A is an aldehyde.

Wait, but wait. Benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1700. If it's an ester, perhaps higher. Chloroformate would have a carbonyl higher. So the 1720 peak could fit an ester or an aldehyde.

Now, looking at the NMR data:

The 1H NMR shows:

11.0 ppm (s, 1H): that's a strong deshielded proton. Could be an aldehyde proton (which is usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes up to 10.5). Wait, no, 11 is higher. Alternatively, a phenolic O-H? Or a carboxylic acid O-H? Wait, but carboxylic acids usually have exchange broadened protons, but in the NMR, it's a singlet at 11 ppm. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde, but aldehyde protons are typically around 9-10 ppm. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: an acid chloride. No, because acid chlorides don't have O-H. Alternatively, a phenol? Phenolic O-H protons are usually around 5 ppm, but in DMSO or other solvents, they can be higher. Wait, but 11 ppm for a phenol? That seems high. Alternatively, maybe it's an exchange with the solvent, but that's not matching the singlet. Another thought: could it be an aldehyde proton? But 11 ppm is more upfield than typical aldehydes. Wait, maybe it's something else.

Let's think of the other peaks. 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). These look like two doublets, each integrating for 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, you have two sets of doublets. For example, a benzene ring with two substituents in positions 1 and 4 (but that would require more substituents). Wait, no, wait. Let me think: if the ring has two substituents opposite each other, then the protons on the ring would split into two doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzaldehyde, the protons ortho to the substituent would be as a pair. Alternatively, in a benzoic acid where the substituents are at para positions.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So positions 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and 1 (CHO). So the ring would have substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. That's three substituents, which complicates the NMR. The ring protons would be more split, perhaps, and not just two doublets.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl at position 4 (para to COOH). So the COOH is at position 1, Cl at 4. So in the ring, positions 2 and 6 would have Hs, and 3 and 5 as Hs, with position 4 as Cl. So the ring would have two sets of equivalent Hs: the two Hs adjacent to COOH (positions 2 and 6) which are ortho, and the two Hs adjacent to Cl (positions 3 and 5), which are meta to COOH. Wait, but in this case, would the NMR show two doublets? Or perhaps a triplet and a doublet?

Alternatively, if the substituents are in para positions, then the coupling would be such that the protons are split into two doublets. For example, if the substituents are at 1 and 4, then the protons at 2 and 6 would be one set, and 3 and 5 another.

Wait, but in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the ring would have Hs at 2,3,5,6. Hs at 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH (para to Cl), and Hs at 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl (meta to COOH). So the Hs at 2 and 6 would be deshielded by the electron-withdrawing COOH group, and those at 3 and 5 would be deshielded by Cl as well. But how would their splitting look?

The Hs at 2 and 6 would couple with each other and perhaps with Hs at 3 and 5, but if the substituents are in para positions, the coupling between H2 and H3 would be through the ring. Maybe it results in a doublet of doublets, but in the NMR, it's given as two doublets.

Alternatively, if there are two substituents in para positions, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons, each as a doublet. For example, in para-dichlorobenzene, each set of two equivalent Hs would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent H.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H) would suggest a pair of doublets. So perhaps the ring has two substituents in para positions, leading to two sets of equivalent Hs, each coupling with two neighbors.

Looking at option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure would be Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So the ring is attached through an ester group. So the substituent is O-CO-Cl attached to the benzene ring. So the substituent is at one position, and the para position would have another substituent if any. But in this case, the substituent is in a single position, so the ring would have three substituents? Wait, no, the structure is O-CO-Cl attached as a substituent to the benzene. So the benzene would have a single substituent (the chloroformate group) at position 1, perhaps. So the ring would have Hs at positions 2,3,4,5,6. The Hs adjacent to the substituent (positions 2 and 6) would be one set, and the Hs across (positions 4) would be another, but in reality, the substituent is in one position, so the ring would have ortho (2,6), meta (3,5) and para (4) Hs.

In such a case, the Hs at ortho (2 and 6) would be equivalent, and each would couple with their adjacent Hs (3 and 5). Similarly, the H at para (4) would have a different shift. Alternatively, perhaps there's para substitution, but I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's look at the NMR again. The 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H) suggest that each set is a doublet integrating for 2H. So perhaps it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, where the substituents are at 1 and 4, making the ring have two sets of two equivalent protons each.

Wait, but in the case of benzoic acid with Cl at 4, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the Hs at 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) are one set, and Hs at 3 and 5 (meta to COOH and ortho to Cl) are another set. Each set would have two Hs, so each would appear as a doublet. But would the coupling constants be the same?

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in the 1 and 2 positions, but that would lead to more complex splitting.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in the 1 and 3 positions, but that would complicate the splitting.

Wait, let's consider the NMR signals:

- 8.02 ppm (d, 2H): perhaps the Hs adjacent to the substituent are more deshielded, so higher ppm. The other set is at 7.72 ppm (d, 2H), less deshielded.

In benzoic acid derivatives, the Hs next to the COOH group are usually upfield or downfield depending on the substituents. Electron-withdrawing groups like Cl would deshield the ortho Hs, making their chemical shift downfield (higher ppm).

So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the Hs at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, so these Hs would be deshielded, appearing downfield. The Hs at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. Cl is also electron-withdrawing, so these Hs would also be deshielded, but perhaps less so than the ortho to COOH.

Wait, but let me think about the actual shifts. For benzoic acid, the Hs ortho to the COOH group are typically around 8 ppm. For example, in benzoic acid, the ortho Hs are around 8.0-8.1 ppm. The meta Hs are around 7.5-7.6 ppm. So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the Cl is para to the COOH. Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, so it would deshield the meta Hs (relative to COOH) even more.

Wait, but in the NMR, the two doublets are 8.02 and 7.72. So 8.02 could be the ortho Hs to COOH, and 7.72 the meta Hs, but in this case, the meta Hs are adjacent to Cl.

Alternatively, let's think about option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So structure is benzaldehyde with OH at position 2 and Cl at 3. So positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). The ring has three substituents. So the Hs would be at positions 4,5,6. Hmm, but in this case, the coupling would be more complicated, perhaps. Let's see: position 4 is between Cl (position 3) and another H, position 5 is between position 4 and 6, and position 6 is between position 5 and position 1 (CHO). So the NMR might show more than two doublets, but the data shows two doublets each integrating for 2H. So maybe option A is less likely.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl at position 2 and COOH at position 1. So the ring substituents are at positions 1 and 2. The aromatic Hs would be at 3,4,5,6. Hs at 3 and 6 are adjacent to Cl (position 2), and Hs at 4 and 5 are across from Cl. So the Hs at 3 and 6 might be a set, and 4 and 5 another. But in this case, would they each be a doublet? Or maybe a triplet or more? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the NMR is simpler. Let's think about the other option, phenyl chloroformate (option C). Its structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the substituent is O-CO-Cl attached to the benzene ring. So the substituent is at one position, say position 1. Then the ring has Hs at 2,3,4,5,6. The Hs at 2 and 6 (ortho to substituent) would be one set, and 3,4,5 as another. Wait, but that's three Hs, but the NMR shows two sets of 2H. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps option C isn't the right one.

Wait, unless the substituent is in para position to another substituent? No, because in C, it's a single substituent.

So back to the NMR. The 8.02 and 7.72 doublets suggest two sets of equivalent protons. So perhaps a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. So substituents at 1 and 4. Then, the Hs at 2 and 6 would be ortho to substituent 1, and Hs at 3 and 5 would be ortho to substituent 4.

So if substituent 1 is a strong electron-withdrawing group, like COOH, then the Hs at 2 and 6 would be deshielded, appearing downfield. Substituent 4 could be Cl, which is also electron-withdrawing.

So in this scenario, substituent 1 is COOH (position 1) and substituent 4 is Cl. So the ring would have Hs at 2,3,5,6. Hs at 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) would be downfield, say around 8.0 ppm. Hs at 3 and 5 (ortho to Cl) would be a bit less deshielded, maybe around 7.7 ppm.

This matches the NMR data: 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). So this suggests that the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl), making the structure 4-chlorobenzoic acid, which is option B.

But wait, option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So substituent at position 2 and COOH at 1. Then, the Hs at 3 and 6 would be ortho to Cl, and Hs at 4 and 5 would be para to Cl.

But in that case, the Hs adjacent to Cl (3 and 6) would be more deshielded and appear downfield, while Hs 4 and 5, which are para to Cl and meta to COOH, would be less deshielded.

So in option D, the NMR would have Hs at 3 and 6 as a doublet around 8.0, and Hs 4 and 5 as a doublet around, say, 7.7. Which also matches the NMR data.

Hmm, so how do I differentiate between options B and D?

Looking back at the IR data. If the compound is a benzoic acid (options B and D), the IR would show a broad O-H stretch (carboxylic acid) around 2500-3300 cm^-1. But in the IR data, there's a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Wait, that is a very broad peak, but is it the O-H stretch?

Wait, the problem states the IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1.

If the compound is a benzoic acid, the O-H stretch should appear as a very broad peak around 2500-3300 cm^-1. But here, the broad peak is from 3500-2700, which is a lower wavenumber than usual for O-H. Wait, that might be an issue.

Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is from an aldehyde O-H? No, aldehydes don't have O-H. Wait, no, that's not possible. Unless it's a phenol O-H. Because phenol O-H stretches are usually around 3200-3600 cm^-1, which would fit the 3500-2700 range. Wait, but the range given is 3500-2700, which is a lower end for O-H. Phenol O-H is usually around 3600-3300, but it can vary based on substitution. So maybe the broad peak is from a phenol O-H.

So if the compound is option A (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde), the IR would have a phenol O-H (broad around 3500) and an aldehyde C=O (sharp around 1720). That could fit.

But then, looking at the NMR. The 11.0 ppm peak as a singlet, which would be the phenol O-H. But wait, phenolic O-H protons are usually around 5 ppm, unless in a very deshielded environment, like near an electron-withdrawing group. Alternatively, perhaps in DMSO or another solvent, the O-H can appear downfield. But 11 ppm is extremely high for an O-H. Wait, maybe it's not an O-H. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: the 11 ppm peak is an aldehyde proton. But as I thought earlier, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. 11 is a bit high, but possible. Let me check some references. Wait, I don't have access right now, but I can think: in benzaldehyde, the aldehyde proton is around 10 ppm. If there are strong electron-withdrawing groups nearby, the shift can go upfield or downfield. For example, in chlorobenzaldehyde, the aldehyde proton might be around 10.5 ppm. So 11 is plausible. 

In option A, the structure has both a phenol O-H and an aldehyde. So the NMR would have a singlet at around 10 ppm for the aldehyde and a broad peak for the phenol O-H. But wait, in the NMR data provided, the 11 ppm is a singlet, which could be the aldehyde, and the 11 ppm is a singlet. But if the compound is A, then the phenol O-H would also show up as a broad peak around 5 ppm, but that's not present in the given NMR. The given NMR only shows three signals: 11.0, 8.02, and 7.72 ppm. So if it's option A, why is there no peak around 5 ppm for the phenol O-H?

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is the 11 ppm singlet, and the phenol O-H isn't appearing because of exchange broadening or because it's in a different region. But that seems unlikely because the NMR is probably recorded under conditions that would show the O-H as a broad peak. So if the NMR doesn't show it, perhaps the structure doesn't have a phenol group.

Wait, but let me go back to the IR. The broad peak is from 3500-2700. If it's a phenol O-H, that would make sense. But then the NMR should show a broad peak around 5 ppm, but it doesn't. Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the broad peak in IR is from an aliphatic O-H, like in an alcohol. But the options don't have an alcohol; they're either acids or aldehydes.

Wait, let me think about the other options. Option C is phenyl chloroformate. Its structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the IR would show a strong carbonyl peak (ester or acid chloride), which would be around 1720 cm^-1, which matches. But would it have any O-H? No, because it's an ester. So the IR's broad peak would have to be from something else. But in the options, only C doesn't have an O-H group. So the IR's broad peak would be a problem for option C.

So if the broad peak in IR is O-H, then options B, D, and A have O-H. However, according to the NMR, the 11 ppm is a singlet, which could be an aldehyde or a phenol. But the absence of a peak around 5 ppm in the NMR suggests that it's not a phenol. So perhaps the 11 ppm is an aldehyde, and the O-H is from a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but carboxylic acid O-H would appear as a broad peak around 12 ppm in the NMR, but it's usually around 10-12 ppm, but exchange broadened, so might not be clearly visible unless under specific conditions. Alternatively, in the given NMR, the 11 ppm could be the aldehyde, and the O-H of the acid might be deuterated or not appearing in the spectrum. Hmm, but the problem states the NMR data, so I have to work with what's given.

Alternatively, the 11 ppm is the O-H of the acid. Wait, no, benzoic acid's O-H is usually around 12 ppm, but that's a broad peak, and perhaps not resolved in the NMR. But in the given data, the 11 ppm is a singlet, which suggests a non-exchangeable proton, like an aldehyde.

Wait, but if the 11 ppm is an aldehyde, then the structure must have an aldehyde group. Which would be option A or perhaps another structure. But looking back, the options only include A as having an aldehyde.

So, trying to piece it together:

- Molecular ion at 156, formula C7H5ClO2.
- IR: broad peak 3500-2700 cm^-1 (maybe O-H), strong sharp at 1720 (carbonyl).
- NMR: 11.0 (s, 1H), 8.02 (d,2H), 7.72 (d,2H).

If the 11 ppm is an aldehyde, then the structure should have an aldehyde group. So option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. But then the IR's broad peak would be from the phenol O-H. But the NMR doesn't show a peak for the phenol. Alternatively, perhaps the phenol O-H is exchanging and not showing up as a separate peak, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, the 11 ppm is the O-H of a carboxylic acid. Wait, no, carboxylic O-H is usually a broad peak that's not a singlet. Also, in the NMR, a singlet would suggest no neighboring protons. A carboxylic acid O-H would be a broad peak, not a singlet.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should think about other aspects.

Looking at the molecular formula, C7H5ClO2. Let's compute the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no N or other atoms besides Cl.

C=7, H=5, X=Cl=1.

So (2*7 +2 -5 -1)/2 = (14+2=16; 16-5=11; 11-1=10) /2 =5. So 5 degrees: probably a benzene ring (3 degrees) and two double bonds (like carbonyl and another). So a benzene ring plus a carbonyl group.

Looking at the options:

A: benzene ring, aldehyde (C=O), hydroxyl. So 3+1+1 =5.

B: benzene, COOH: 3+2 (from COOH) =5.

C: benzene, COOCl: 3+2=5.

D: same as B.

So all options fit.

Now, looking at the NMR signals. The 11 ppm is a singlet (1H). If it's an aldehyde, then the aromatic protons would be as in option A. If it's a carboxylic acid, that 11 ppm would be the O-H, but as a broad peak. But the NMR shows a singlet, which implies no coupling. So perhaps it's an aldehyde.

In option A, the aromatic protons would be on a benzene ring with Cl, OH, and CHO substituents. So, the Hs would be at positions 4,5,6. The substituents are at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). So the ring would have Hs at positions 4,5,6.

Hs at 4 and 6 would be meta to OH and para to Cl. Hs at 5 would be ortho to Cl and meta to OH. But this would result in more complex splitting than the two doublets observed. So perhaps option A is less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the integration and the splitting.

The 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H) suggest that each set of Hs is equivalent and each is coupled to one other set, resulting in a doublet. That would happen in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each in the 1 and 4 positions.

So, substituent 1 and substituent 4. Then, the Hs at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to substituent 1) would be one set, and Hs at 3 and 5 (ortho to substituent 4) would be another set. Each set would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent Hs.

If substituent 1 is COOH (benzoic acid) and substituent 4 is Cl (4-chlorobenzoic acid, option B), then the Hs ortho to COOH would be more deshielded (higher ppm) than the Hs ortho to Cl.

In this case, the Hs ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be around 8.0 ppm, and the Hs ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5) around 7.7 ppm. That matches the NMR data. Plus, the IR would show a broad O-H from the carboxylic acid and a sharp carbonyl around 1720 cm^-1.

Wait, but the IR's broad peak is from 3500-2700 cm^-1. For a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually around 2500-3300 cm^-1. So a peak from 3500-2700 might suggest a different O-H, like a phenol, but option B doesn't have a phenol. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the IR's broad peak is not O-H. But the only other possibility is an N-H, but none of the options have that. So I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another point: in the mass spec, the molecular ion is at 156. The other peak is at 158, which is 2 mass units higher. That's consistent with a molecule containing a chlorine atom, as Cl has two main isotopes: 35Cl (75%) and 37Cl (25%). So the M+2 peak is at 32% intensity, which aligns with a single Cl atom: (37Cl is ~25% abundance, so the M+2 peak would be about 25% of M. But in the data it's 32%, which is a bit higher than expected. Hmm, maybe the calculation is approximate.

But back to the NMR. Another thing to note: the 8.02 and 7.72 peaks are each 2H. So perhaps each is a pair of equivalent protons. That fits with a 1,4-disubstituted benzene.

So putting it all together:

- The structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B) or 2-chlorobenzoic acid (option D). Both have the same molecular formula.

But in option D, substituents are at 1 and 2, which would lead to more complex splitting than two doublets. So probably option B is correct.

But wait, the IR's broad peak. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H should be in the 2500-3300 region. The given IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700, which is lower than expected. So that doesn't fit with a carboxylic acid.

Wait, unless it's a different kind of O-H, like an alcohol. But none of the options have an alcohol group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak is from an aliphatic O-H, but again, none of the options have that except option A, which also has an aldehyde.

Wait, but the NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm, which could be the aldehyde. So that would suggest option A.

But if option A is correct, the IR's broad peak would be the phenol O-H. So the IR's broad peak would be around 3500 cm^-1, which matches the given data. The sharp peak at 1720 would be the aldehyde's carbonyl.

In that case, the NMR would have:

- 11.0 ppm: aldehyde proton (s, 1H)
- 8.02 and 7.72: aromatic protons (d, 2H each)

But wait, option A's structure would have a phenol O-H, which usually appears around 5 ppm in NMR. But that's not present in the data. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the phenol O-H is not showing up because the solution is concentrated or in a different solvent, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: the integration. The 11 ppm peak is 1H. If it's an aldehyde, that makes sense. The 8.02 and 7.72 are each 2H, so four aromatic Hs. But option A only has three substituents on the ring, meaning there are three Hs on the ring. Wait, no, wait. Benzaldehyde has a benzene ring with five Hs. If there are substituents at positions 1,2,3, then the ring has three substituents and three Hs left. But the NMR shows four Hs (two in each doublet). So that doesn't fit. So option A's structure would have only three aromatic Hs, but the NMR shows four. So option A is not correct.

Ah, that's a key point. So if option A is considered, the ring would have three substituents (CHO at 1, OH at 2, Cl at 3), leaving Hs at positions 4,5,6. So three Hs. But the NMR shows four Hs (two doublets integrating to 2H each). So that rules out option A.

So, this leaves options B, C, and D. But wait, option C's structure has only a single substituent (the chloroformate group), so the ring would have five Hs, but the NMR shows four. So that's not matching.

So perhaps the correct structure is option B or D, which are 4-chlorobenzoic acid or 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

In that case, the ring has two substituents (COOH and Cl), leaving four Hs. So the NMR would show two doublets each integrating for 2H. That fits. So the structure is either B or D.

Now, how to differentiate between B and D based on NMR.

In option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid), the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). The ortho Hs (2 and 6) to COOH would be more deshielded and appear downfield, while the meta Hs (3 and 5) to COOH (and ortho to Cl) would be less deshielded.

In option D (2-chlorobenzoic acid), the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). The ortho Hs to Cl (3 and 6) would be more deshielded, while the para Hs (4 and 5) would be less deshielded.

So in option B, the downfield (higher ppm) Hs are ortho to COOH, which would be around 8.0 ppm, and the other set around 7.7 ppm.

In option D, the downfield Hs would be ortho to Cl, which would be more deshielded than meta to COOH. So in D, the Hs ortho to Cl would be at higher ppm than the Hs meta to COOH.

So the NMR shows 8.02 and 7.72. So which substituent would cause the Hs to be at those positions.

In option B: Hs ortho to COOH would be at 8.02, and Hs ortho to Cl would be at 7.72.

In option D: Hs ortho to Cl would be more deshielded, so higher ppm, say 8.02, and Hs meta to COOH would be at 7.72.

So both structures could fit the NMR data.

But how to decide between B and D.

Looking at the IR data. If the structure is a benzoic acid, the IR should show a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm^-1, but the IR here shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 2700 is lower than 2500. So the broad peak is from 3500 down to 2700, which seems too low for a carboxylic acid O-H.

Wait, but maybe it's a phenol O-H. So if the structure is option A, which has a phenol O-H, that would fit the IR. But earlier, we ruled out option A because the NMR didn't show the phenol O-H. So this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR's broad peak is not O-H at all. Could it be an aliphatic C-O stretch or something else? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: the peak at 1720 cm^-1 is strong and sharp, which is a carbonyl. For a benzoic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm^-1. So 1720 is a bit higher, which could suggest an ester or aldehyde.

So if the carbonyl is at 1720, perhaps it's an ester or aldehyde.

Option C is phenyl chloroformate, which is an ester. Its carbonyl would be around 1740-1720 cm^-1. So that fits.

In that case, the IR's broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 would have to be something else. But option C doesn't have an O-H group. So where is the broad peak coming from?

Hmm, perhaps it's an impurity or some other functional group. But since the options are given, I'll have to choose based on the data.

Wait, another possibility: the IR's broad peak is from an aliphatic C-O stretch. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a C-H stretch, but that's usually around 3000 cm^-1.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is from an aldehyde C-H stretch, but aldehyde C-H is around 2700-2800 cm^-1. The given IR's broad peak is from 3500-2700, which includes the 2700-2800 region. But aldehyde C-H is usually a medium-strong peak around 2820 and 2720 cm^-1, which could be part of the broad peak. But I'm not sure.

Putting this all together, I'm a bit stuck between options B and C.

Option B's NMR fits the data except for the IR, which may not align with the O-H position. Option C's IR fits the carbonyl but not the O-H.

Wait, what about the singlet at 11 ppm? If it's an aldehyde, then option C doesn't have an aldehyde. So that can't be. So perhaps option C isn't correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

But wait, the IR's O-H peak is a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the IR's broad peak isn't O-H but something else.

Alternatively, maybe the IR's broad peak is from an aliphatic amine or something else, but since none of the options have that, I'm back to square one.

Another approach: think about the molecular formula and possible functional groups.

If the structure is option C: phenyl chloroformate (O-CO-Cl attached to benzene), then the functional group is an acid chloride ester. The IR would show a strong carbonyl around 1720 cm^-1, which matches. But where is the broad peak from 3500-2700? If there's no O-H, then maybe it's an aliphatic C-O stretch, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's due to the Cl in the molecule. But Cl doesn't usually cause such broad peaks.

Wait, maybe the broad peak is from an impurity or the solvent. But that seems unlikely.

So, if the correct structure is option C, then the NMR would have the aromatic protons as a set of two doublets. But the structure of option C has only one substituent, making the ring have five Hs, which would require more complex splitting than the data shows. So that doesn't fit.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

But I'm still a bit unsure about the IR's O-H position. Maybe the broad peak in the IR is from another group, but I can't think of what.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR's broad peak isn't O-H but an aldehyde C-H stretch. But aldehyde C-H is around 2720 cm^-1, which is within the given range. However, the C-H stretch is usually a medium peak, not very broad. But the given peak is broad, which is more typical of O-H.

Hmm. Another angle: looking at the integration of the NMR signals.

The 11 ppm is a singlet of 1H. If it's a COOH O-H, that's not possible because COOH O-H is a broad peak and would be a singlet. But in the NMR, it's a singlet, which suggests no splitting, which fits with an O-H that's not exchanging. But carboxylic O-H is usually a broad peak, not a singlet. So this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the 11 ppm is the aldehyde proton. In that case, the structure must have an aldehyde. But then, looking back, only option A has an aldehyde, but its NMR doesn't fit the data.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount.

Option A's structure: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

The benzene ring would have substituents at 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). So the remaining Hs are at 4,5,6. Let me draw the structure:

Positions:

1: CHO

2: OH

3: Cl

So the Hs are at 4,5,6.

H4 is between Cl (3) and H5.

H5 is between H4 and H6.

H6 is between H5 and CHO (1).

So in this structure, H4 is ortho to Cl, H6 is ortho to CHO, and H5 is meta to both.

So in the NMR, the Hs would be:

H4: ortho to Cl, which is a strong EWG, so downfield.

H5: meta to Cl and ortho to H4.

H6: ortho to CHO, which is an EWG, so downfield.

But the NMR shows two doublets each of 2H, so four Hs. But this structure only has three Hs on the ring. So that's a mismatch. So option A is not correct.

So back to options B and D.

If the structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid (B), the aromatic Hs would be two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72. The 11 ppm peak would be the aldehyde, but option B doesn't have an aldehyde. So this doesn't fit.

Wait, this is getting me more confused. Let me try to think differently.

Another way: the 1H NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm. What functional groups give a singlet? It could be an aldehyde proton, which is usually a singlet because it has no adjacent Hs. Or a proton that's not split by any neighboring Hs, such as in a symmetric environment.

If it's an aldehyde, then the structure must have an aldehyde group, which is option A or perhaps another structure not listed. But according to the options, only A has an aldehyde.

But earlier, I thought option A couldn't be right due to the NMR not matching. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the 11 ppm is not an aldehyde. Another possibility: it's an aromatic proton in a highly deshielded environment. But that's unlikely because aromatic protons are usually between 6.5-8.5 ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl oxygen and not a proton. No, the question says 1H NMR.

Wait, another thought: the singlet at 11 ppm could be an exchangeable proton that's not observed, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone or ester proton, but those don't have protons attached.

Wait, but I'm stuck. Let me try to go back to the options and see which one fits all data.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

- Molecular formula: C7H5ClO2. Fits molecular ion at 156.

- IR: strong peak at 1720 cm^-1 (carbonyl of COOH, which is around 1700, but could be higher). The broad peak at 3500-2700 could be O-H, but it's not in the usual region. However, perhaps the O-H is deprotonated or the measurement conditions shift it.

- NMR: 11 ppm singlet can't be explained by this structure, as it doesn't have an aldehyde. So this is a problem.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

Same molecular formula.

IR: same as B.

NMR: the aromatic Hs would be ortho to Cl and meta to COOH. So Hs ortho to Cl would be more deshielded, appearing at higher ppm. So the 8.02 and 7.72 would correspond to Hs ortho to Cl and meta to COOH. But the 11 ppm singlet still doesn't fit.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate.

- Molecular formula: C7H5ClO2.

- IR: strong carbonyl at 1720 cm^-1 (ester or acid chloride), which fits.

- NMR: should have aromatic protons. But in this structure, the substituent is one, leading to five aromatic Hs. The given NMR shows four, so perhaps this isn't the case. Also, the 11 ppm singlet doesn't fit unless it's something else.

So the only structure that fits most of the data is option B or D, but the 11 ppm is a problem.

Wait, perhaps the 11 ppm is not part of the aromatic protons. Wait, the 11 ppm could be the aldehyde, but in that case, the structure must have an aldehyde, which is only option A. But earlier analysis suggests option A isn't correct because of the NMR.

Wait, another angle: the 11 ppm peak is a singlet. If it's an aldehyde, perhaps the aromatic ring is such that the aldehyde is at position 1, and the substituents are at positions 2 and 4. So the aromatic Hs would be at positions 3,5,6. But I'm not sure how that would split.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is at position 1, and the substituents are at 2 and 4. The Hs would be at 3,5,6. But that would give three Hs, which doesn't fit the NMR data.

Another thought: perhaps the structure isn't a benzoic acid or aldehyde but an ester with an aldehyde group. But none of the options fit that.

Hmmm. Maybe I'm missing something in the IR. The IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Could that be an O-H from a carboxylic acid? It's usually higher. Or perhaps it's an alcohol. But the options don't have an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the broad peak is a combination of O-H and C-H stretches. But that's speculative.

Another possibility: the broad peak is from an aromatic ring's C-H stretch. But that's usually around 3000-3100 cm^-1, not 3500-2700.

Alternatively, maybe it's the stretching of the C-Cl bond, but I don't think that's a broad peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from a conjugated system, but I'm not sure.

Given all this, I'm going to have to make an educated guess. The NMR data points towards a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each causing the aromatic protons to split into two doublets. The 11 ppm singlet suggests an aldehyde proton, which would fit with option A. However, the aromatic substitution in option A doesn't match the NMR's two doublets.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount the substitution pattern for option A.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

The substituents are at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). So the Hs are at 4,5,6.

H4 is between Cl (3) and H5.

H5 is between H4 and H6.

H6 is between H5 and CHO (1).

So the substituents are in positions 1,2,3. The Hs are at 4,5,6.

H4 is ortho to Cl (3), meta to OH (2), and para to CHO (1).

H5 is meta to Cl (3), para to OH (2), and ortho to H4 and H6.

H6 is ortho to CHO (1), meta to OH (2), and ortho to H5.

This would result in three distinct sets of protons, not two doublets. So the NMR for option A would have three signals, not two. So that doesn't match the given data.

So I'm back to options B and D.

Assuming the 11 ppm is not part of the aromatic protons, perhaps it's another group. But I can't think of what.

Wait, maybe the 11 ppm is a carbonyl oxygen and not a proton. No, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake in the data, but I can't assume that.

At this point, I'll have to make a choice based on the available data.

The NMR indicates two sets of aromatic protons, suggesting a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. The IR's carbonyl at 1720 suggests a strong C=O, which fits benzoic acid or an ester. The molecular formula fits both.

But the broad peak in IR is lower than expected for a carboxylic acid. So perhaps it's an ester.

Option C is phenyl chloroformate, which is an ester. Its structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The IR would have a strong carbonyl around 1720, which fits. But the NMR would show more than two sets of aromatic protons unless the substituent is in a specific position.

Wait, phenyl chloroformate has the substituent as O-CO-Cl. So the substituent is in one position. The aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,4,5,6. The Hs at 2 and 6 would be ortho to the substituent, and 3,4,5 would be meta or para. But that would require more than two sets, so the NMR doesn't fit.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C, despite the NMR not matching. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The NMR's two doublets fit the para substitution, and the molecular formula fits. The IR's carbonyl fits, and the broad peak could be an O-H, even if it's a bit lower than expected.

So, given all that, I'll conclude that the correct answer is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** suggests a molecular formula of **C₇H₅ClO₂**. The **m/z = 158** peak indicates the presence of chlorine, as it accounts for the isotopic contribution of chlorine (Cl-37). The IR spectrum shows a **broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹**, likely corresponding to an O-H stretch, and a **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**, indicative of a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR spectrum includes a **singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H)**, and two **doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H)** and **7.72 ppm (2H)**, suggesting a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   This compound contains a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). The aromatic protons at positions 4, 5, and 6 would result in three distinct signals in the NMR spectrum, not two doublets. Additionally, the phenol O-H proton typically appears around 5 ppm, which is absent in the given NMR data. Thus, this option is inconsistent with the NMR data.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound has a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). The aromatic protons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 would split into two doublets, consistent with the NMR data. The carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ aligns with the carboxylic acid group, and the broad peak in the IR spectrum can be attributed to the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid. This option fits the molecular formula, IR, and NMR data.

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   This compound has a benzene ring with a single substituent, **Cl-CO-O-**, leading to five aromatic protons. The NMR data only shows four aromatic protons (two doublets), which does not match. Additionally, this compound lacks an O-H group, making the broad IR peak inconsistent. Thus, this option is not viable.

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound has a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). The aromatic protons at positions 3, 4, 5, and 6 would split into two doublets, similar to option B. However, the substitution pattern would result in different chemical shifts for the aromatic protons compared to the NMR data. Additionally, the IR and NMR data are consistent with a para-substituted benzene, not an ortho-substituted one. Thus, this option is less likely than option B.

### Conclusion:
The molecular formula, IR data, and NMR data are best explained by **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The para-substitution pattern accounts for the two doublets in the NMR spectrum, and the IR data aligns with the functional groups present. 

**Answer: B**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about identifying an unknown white solid based on its spectral data. Let's go through the information step by step.

First, the molecular ion peak is at m/z 156 with 100% intensity. There's also a peak at m/z 158 at 32%. Hmm, so the molecular weight is likely 156. The 158 could be an isotope peak. Chlorine has an atomic weight around 35.5, so if the molecule has a Cl, the molecular ion would have two peaks: one for Cl-35 and another for Cl-37. Wait, but 156 and 158 differ by 2, which makes sense because Cl has two main isotopes, 35Cl and 37Cl, each contributing to the mass. So the M peak is at 156, so the molecular formula probably includes Cl. Let me calculate.

If the molecular weight is 156, and assuming it's C8H5ClO3? Let me check: C is 12, H is 1, Cl is 35, O is 16. So 8*12=96, 5*1=5, 35=35, 3*16=48. Adding them up: 96+5=101, 101+35=136, 136+48=184. No, that's too high. Hmm, maybe a different formula.

Wait, maybe the formula is C7H5ClO2. Let's calculate: 7*12=84, 5=5, Cl=35, 2*16=32. 84+5=89 +35=124 +32=156. Yes, that adds up. So the formula could be C7H5ClO2. Alternatively, maybe something else. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. Structure is Cl attached to ring at position 3, hydroxy at 2, and aldehyde at 1. The formula would be C7H5ClO2. That fits.

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid. That's Cl in position 4, COOH group. So formula is C7H5ClO2 as well. Because benzoic acid is C7H6O2, but with Cl replacing a H, so C7H5ClO2.

C) Phenyl chloroformate. That would be OCl-CO-O-Ph. Wait, phenyl chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the formula would be C6H5O2ClCO2? Wait, no. Let me think. The chloroformate is Cl-CO-O-R. So R is phenyl (C6H5O), so the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Wait, no, wait. Let me compute: COOCl attached to phenyl. So the entire molecule is C6H5-O-CO-Cl. So the formula is C7H5ClO2. Yes, same as before.

D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Cl at position 2, benzoic acid. Formula is C7H5ClO2. Same as B.

So all options except maybe C have the same formula? Or wait, let me check. Option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure is Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So the formula is C6H5O2CCl? Wait, no. Let's compute: C6H5-O-CO-Cl. The CO is carbonyl, so the formula would be C7H5ClO2. Because O is in COO: C6H5-O-CO-Cl is C7H5ClO2. So all options have the same formula, which adds up to 156.

Hmm, so the molecular ion is 156. The other peak is 158, which is probably the Cl isotope. So molecular formula is C7H5ClO2.

Next, let's look at the IR data. It shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Broad peaks in IR usually indicate O-H or N-H stretches. But in the options, looking for O-H. But wait, the peak at 1720 cm^-1 is strong and sharp. That suggests a carbonyl group, like a ketone, aldehyde, ester, or carboxylic acid. Because carboxylic acids have strong O-H stretch (broad) and a carbonyl around 1700, but their O-H is usually a broad peak around 2500-3300 cm^-1. Wait, in the IR, the problem states a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. That's a wide region. It might be an O-H stretch, but another possibility is an N-H, but since we have Cl and O, perhaps it's an O-H.

Wait, but the other part is a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1. So that's a carbonyl, maybe an ester, or acid, or aldehyde. Let me think: a carboxylic acid's carbonyl is around 1700, but sometimes lower? Aromatic esters or aldehydes would be higher, maybe. For example, an aldehyde's carbonyl is around 1720, higher than a ketone or ester perhaps.

Wait, no. Let me get this right. The carbonyl (C=O) stretching frequencies in IR:

- Aldehydes: ~1720 cm^-1
- Ketones: ~1715 cm^-1
- Carboxylic acids: ~1700 cm^-1 (but can vary)
- Esters: ~1740-1720 cm^-1
- Amides: lower, like ~1650-1700.

So the 1720 peak here could be an aldehyde or an ester. But the presence of a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 is more consistent with an O-H group, like in a carboxylic acid, phenol, or maybe an aldehyde with some hydrogen bonding.

Wait, but an aldehyde's O-H is usually not present. Wait, no, aldehydes don't have O-H. So the O-H would be in a carboxylic acid, phenol, or maybe an alcohol. But the options:

Looking at the options:

A) 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde: has a hydroxyl group and an aldehyde. So O-H (phenol) and aldehyde.

B) 4-chlorobenzoic acid: has a carboxylic acid group (-COOH), so strong O-H (broad) and a carbonyl.

C) Phenyl chloroformate: structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So it's an ester, but no O-H. Wait, unless it's an acid chloride. Oh, wait, it's a chloroformate, which is an acid chloride derivative. So the structure is Ph-O-CO-Cl. So no O-H groups except perhaps if it's a different structure, but I think it's O connected to COCl. So maybe no O-H. Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl-CO-O-Ph, which would have no O-H.

D) 2-chlorobenzoic acid: same as B, but Cl is in position 2.

So looking at the IR:

- Broad peak 3500-2700: suggests O-H stretching. So that would be present in A (phenolic O-H), B, and D (carboxylic O-H), but not in C.

Then the 1720 cm^-1 is the carbonyl. For A, the aldehyde would have a strong peak around 1720. For B and D, the carboxylic acid would have a carbonyl around 1700, maybe a bit higher depending on substitution. For C, the ester or acid chloride would have a higher carbonyl, like around 1740-1760, perhaps.

So the 1720 is a bit higher than typical for a carboxylic acid (which is around 1700), so that could suggest an ester or an aldehyde. But in the options, only A is an aldehyde.

Wait, but wait. Benzoic acid's carbonyl is around 1700. If it's an ester, perhaps higher. Chloroformate would have a carbonyl higher. So the 1720 peak could fit an ester or an aldehyde.

Now, looking at the NMR data:

The 1H NMR shows:

11.0 ppm (s, 1H): that's a strong deshielded proton. Could be an aldehyde proton (which is usually around 9-10 ppm, but sometimes up to 10.5). Wait, no, 11 is higher. Alternatively, a phenolic O-H? Or a carboxylic acid O-H? Wait, but carboxylic acids usually have exchange broadened protons, but in the NMR, it's a singlet at 11 ppm. Alternatively, it could be an aldehyde, but aldehyde protons are typically around 9-10 ppm. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: an acid chloride. No, because acid chlorides don't have O-H. Alternatively, a phenol? Phenolic O-H protons are usually around 5 ppm, but in DMSO or other solvents, they can be higher. Wait, but 11 ppm for a phenol? That seems high. Alternatively, maybe it's an exchange with the solvent, but that's not matching the singlet. Another thought: could it be an aldehyde proton? But 11 ppm is more upfield than typical aldehydes. Wait, maybe it's something else.

Let's think of the other peaks. 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). These look like two doublets, each integrating for 2H. This suggests a para-substituted aromatic ring. Because in para substitution, you have two sets of doublets. For example, a benzene ring with two substituents in positions 1 and 4 (but that would require more substituents). Wait, no, wait. Let me think: if the ring has two substituents opposite each other, then the protons on the ring would split into two doublets. For example, in para-substituted benzaldehyde, the protons ortho to the substituent would be as a pair. Alternatively, in a benzoic acid where the substituents are at para positions.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So positions 2 (OH), 3 (Cl), and 1 (CHO). So the ring would have substituents at positions 1, 2, and 3. That's three substituents, which complicates the NMR. The ring protons would be more split, perhaps, and not just two doublets.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl at position 4 (para to COOH). So the COOH is at position 1, Cl at 4. So in the ring, positions 2 and 6 would have Hs, and 3 and 5 as Hs, with position 4 as Cl. So the ring would have two sets of equivalent Hs: the two Hs adjacent to COOH (positions 2 and 6) which are ortho, and the two Hs adjacent to Cl (positions 3 and 5), which are meta to COOH. Wait, but in this case, would the NMR show two doublets? Or perhaps a triplet and a doublet?

Alternatively, if the substituents are in para positions, then the coupling would be such that the protons are split into two doublets. For example, if the substituents are at 1 and 4, then the protons at 2 and 6 would be one set, and 3 and 5 another.

Wait, but in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the ring would have Hs at 2,3,5,6. Hs at 2 and 6 are adjacent to COOH (para to Cl), and Hs at 3 and 5 are adjacent to Cl (meta to COOH). So the Hs at 2 and 6 would be deshielded by the electron-withdrawing COOH group, and those at 3 and 5 would be deshielded by Cl as well. But how would their splitting look?

The Hs at 2 and 6 would couple with each other and perhaps with Hs at 3 and 5, but if the substituents are in para positions, the coupling between H2 and H3 would be through the ring. Maybe it results in a doublet of doublets, but in the NMR, it's given as two doublets.

Alternatively, if there are two substituents in para positions, the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons, each as a doublet. For example, in para-dichlorobenzene, each set of two equivalent Hs would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent H.

Wait, but in the NMR data, the 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H) would suggest a pair of doublets. So perhaps the ring has two substituents in para positions, leading to two sets of equivalent Hs, each coupling with two neighbors.

Looking at option C: Phenyl chloroformate. Structure would be Cl-CO-O-C6H5. So the ring is attached through an ester group. So the substituent is O-CO-Cl attached to the benzene ring. So the substituent is at one position, and the para position would have another substituent if any. But in this case, the substituent is in a single position, so the ring would have three substituents? Wait, no, the structure is O-CO-Cl attached as a substituent to the benzene. So the benzene would have a single substituent (the chloroformate group) at position 1, perhaps. So the ring would have Hs at positions 2,3,4,5,6. The Hs adjacent to the substituent (positions 2 and 6) would be one set, and the Hs across (positions 4) would be another, but in reality, the substituent is in one position, so the ring would have ortho (2,6), meta (3,5) and para (4) Hs.

In such a case, the Hs at ortho (2 and 6) would be equivalent, and each would couple with their adjacent Hs (3 and 5). Similarly, the H at para (4) would have a different shift. Alternatively, perhaps there's para substitution, but I'm not sure.

This is getting a bit complicated. Let's look at the NMR again. The 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H) suggest that each set is a doublet integrating for 2H. So perhaps it's a 1,4-disubstituted benzene, where the substituents are at 1 and 4, making the ring have two sets of two equivalent protons each.

Wait, but in the case of benzoic acid with Cl at 4, the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). So the Hs at 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) are one set, and Hs at 3 and 5 (meta to COOH and ortho to Cl) are another set. Each set would have two Hs, so each would appear as a doublet. But would the coupling constants be the same?

Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in the 1 and 2 positions, but that would lead to more complex splitting.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are in the 1 and 3 positions, but that would complicate the splitting.

Wait, let's consider the NMR signals:

- 8.02 ppm (d, 2H): perhaps the Hs adjacent to the substituent are more deshielded, so higher ppm. The other set is at 7.72 ppm (d, 2H), less deshielded.

In benzoic acid derivatives, the Hs next to the COOH group are usually upfield or downfield depending on the substituents. Electron-withdrawing groups like Cl would deshield the ortho Hs, making their chemical shift downfield (higher ppm).

So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the Hs at 2 and 6 are ortho to COOH and meta to Cl. Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, so these Hs would be deshielded, appearing downfield. The Hs at 3 and 5 are meta to COOH and ortho to Cl. Cl is also electron-withdrawing, so these Hs would also be deshielded, but perhaps less so than the ortho to COOH.

Wait, but let me think about the actual shifts. For benzoic acid, the Hs ortho to the COOH group are typically around 8 ppm. For example, in benzoic acid, the ortho Hs are around 8.0-8.1 ppm. The meta Hs are around 7.5-7.6 ppm. So in 4-chlorobenzoic acid, the Cl is para to the COOH. Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, so it would deshield the meta Hs (relative to COOH) even more.

Wait, but in the NMR, the two doublets are 8.02 and 7.72. So 8.02 could be the ortho Hs to COOH, and 7.72 the meta Hs, but in this case, the meta Hs are adjacent to Cl.

Alternatively, let's think about option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. So structure is benzaldehyde with OH at position 2 and Cl at 3. So positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). The ring has three substituents. So the Hs would be at positions 4,5,6. Hmm, but in this case, the coupling would be more complicated, perhaps. Let's see: position 4 is between Cl (position 3) and another H, position 5 is between position 4 and 6, and position 6 is between position 5 and position 1 (CHO). So the NMR might show more than two doublets, but the data shows two doublets each integrating for 2H. So maybe option A is less likely.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid. Structure is Cl at position 2 and COOH at position 1. So the ring substituents are at positions 1 and 2. The aromatic Hs would be at 3,4,5,6. Hs at 3 and 6 are adjacent to Cl (position 2), and Hs at 4 and 5 are across from Cl. So the Hs at 3 and 6 might be a set, and 4 and 5 another. But in this case, would they each be a doublet? Or maybe a triplet or more? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the NMR is simpler. Let's think about the other option, phenyl chloroformate (option C). Its structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the substituent is O-CO-Cl attached to the benzene ring. So the substituent is at one position, say position 1. Then the ring has Hs at 2,3,4,5,6. The Hs at 2 and 6 (ortho to substituent) would be one set, and 3,4,5 as another. Wait, but that's three Hs, but the NMR shows two sets of 2H. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So perhaps option C isn't the right one.

Wait, unless the substituent is in para position to another substituent? No, because in C, it's a single substituent.

So back to the NMR. The 8.02 and 7.72 doublets suggest two sets of equivalent protons. So perhaps a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. So substituents at 1 and 4. Then, the Hs at 2 and 6 would be ortho to substituent 1, and Hs at 3 and 5 would be ortho to substituent 4.

So if substituent 1 is a strong electron-withdrawing group, like COOH, then the Hs at 2 and 6 would be deshielded, appearing downfield. Substituent 4 could be Cl, which is also electron-withdrawing.

So in this scenario, substituent 1 is COOH (position 1) and substituent 4 is Cl. So the ring would have Hs at 2,3,5,6. Hs at 2 and 6 (ortho to COOH) would be downfield, say around 8.0 ppm. Hs at 3 and 5 (ortho to Cl) would be a bit less deshielded, maybe around 7.7 ppm.

This matches the NMR data: 8.02 (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H). So this suggests that the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl), making the structure 4-chlorobenzoic acid, which is option B.

But wait, option D is 2-chlorobenzoic acid. So substituent at position 2 and COOH at 1. Then, the Hs at 3 and 6 would be ortho to Cl, and Hs at 4 and 5 would be para to Cl.

But in that case, the Hs adjacent to Cl (3 and 6) would be more deshielded and appear downfield, while Hs 4 and 5, which are para to Cl and meta to COOH, would be less deshielded.

So in option D, the NMR would have Hs at 3 and 6 as a doublet around 8.0, and Hs 4 and 5 as a doublet around, say, 7.7. Which also matches the NMR data.

Hmm, so how do I differentiate between options B and D?

Looking back at the IR data. If the compound is a benzoic acid (options B and D), the IR would show a broad O-H stretch (carboxylic acid) around 2500-3300 cm^-1. But in the IR data, there's a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Wait, that is a very broad peak, but is it the O-H stretch?

Wait, the problem states the IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 and a strong sharp peak at 1720 cm^-1.

If the compound is a benzoic acid, the O-H stretch should appear as a very broad peak around 2500-3300 cm^-1. But here, the broad peak is from 3500-2700, which is a lower wavenumber than usual for O-H. Wait, that might be an issue.

Alternatively, maybe the broad peak is from an aldehyde O-H? No, aldehydes don't have O-H. Wait, no, that's not possible. Unless it's a phenol O-H. Because phenol O-H stretches are usually around 3200-3600 cm^-1, which would fit the 3500-2700 range. Wait, but the range given is 3500-2700, which is a lower end for O-H. Phenol O-H is usually around 3600-3300, but it can vary based on substitution. So maybe the broad peak is from a phenol O-H.

So if the compound is option A (3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde), the IR would have a phenol O-H (broad around 3500) and an aldehyde C=O (sharp around 1720). That could fit.

But then, looking at the NMR. The 11.0 ppm peak as a singlet, which would be the phenol O-H. But wait, phenolic O-H protons are usually around 5 ppm, unless in a very deshielded environment, like near an electron-withdrawing group. Alternatively, perhaps in DMSO or another solvent, the O-H can appear downfield. But 11 ppm is extremely high for an O-H. Wait, maybe it's not an O-H. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: the 11 ppm peak is an aldehyde proton. But as I thought earlier, aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. 11 is a bit high, but possible. Let me check some references. Wait, I don't have access right now, but I can think: in benzaldehyde, the aldehyde proton is around 10 ppm. If there are strong electron-withdrawing groups nearby, the shift can go upfield or downfield. For example, in chlorobenzaldehyde, the aldehyde proton might be around 10.5 ppm. So 11 is plausible. 

In option A, the structure has both a phenol O-H and an aldehyde. So the NMR would have a singlet at around 10 ppm for the aldehyde and a broad peak for the phenol O-H. But wait, in the NMR data provided, the 11 ppm is a singlet, which could be the aldehyde, and the 11 ppm is a singlet. But if the compound is A, then the phenol O-H would also show up as a broad peak around 5 ppm, but that's not present in the given NMR. The given NMR only shows three signals: 11.0, 8.02, and 7.72 ppm. So if it's option A, why is there no peak around 5 ppm for the phenol O-H?

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is the 11 ppm singlet, and the phenol O-H isn't appearing because of exchange broadening or because it's in a different region. But that seems unlikely because the NMR is probably recorded under conditions that would show the O-H as a broad peak. So if the NMR doesn't show it, perhaps the structure doesn't have a phenol group.

Wait, but let me go back to the IR. The broad peak is from 3500-2700. If it's a phenol O-H, that would make sense. But then the NMR should show a broad peak around 5 ppm, but it doesn't. Hmm, that's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the broad peak in IR is from an aliphatic O-H, like in an alcohol. But the options don't have an alcohol; they're either acids or aldehydes.

Wait, let me think about the other options. Option C is phenyl chloroformate. Its structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. So the IR would show a strong carbonyl peak (ester or acid chloride), which would be around 1720 cm^-1, which matches. But would it have any O-H? No, because it's an ester. So the IR's broad peak would have to be from something else. But in the options, only C doesn't have an O-H group. So the IR's broad peak would be a problem for option C.

So if the broad peak in IR is O-H, then options B, D, and A have O-H. However, according to the NMR, the 11 ppm is a singlet, which could be an aldehyde or a phenol. But the absence of a peak around 5 ppm in the NMR suggests that it's not a phenol. So perhaps the 11 ppm is an aldehyde, and the O-H is from a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but carboxylic acid O-H would appear as a broad peak around 12 ppm in the NMR, but it's usually around 10-12 ppm, but exchange broadened, so might not be clearly visible unless under specific conditions. Alternatively, in the given NMR, the 11 ppm could be the aldehyde, and the O-H of the acid might be deuterated or not appearing in the spectrum. Hmm, but the problem states the NMR data, so I have to work with what's given.

Alternatively, the 11 ppm is the O-H of the acid. Wait, no, benzoic acid's O-H is usually around 12 ppm, but that's a broad peak, and perhaps not resolved in the NMR. But in the given data, the 11 ppm is a singlet, which suggests a non-exchangeable proton, like an aldehyde.

Wait, but if the 11 ppm is an aldehyde, then the structure must have an aldehyde group. Which would be option A or perhaps another structure. But looking back, the options only include A as having an aldehyde.

So, trying to piece it together:

- Molecular ion at 156, formula C7H5ClO2.
- IR: broad peak 3500-2700 cm^-1 (maybe O-H), strong sharp at 1720 (carbonyl).
- NMR: 11.0 (s, 1H), 8.02 (d,2H), 7.72 (d,2H).

If the 11 ppm is an aldehyde, then the structure should have an aldehyde group. So option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. But then the IR's broad peak would be from the phenol O-H. But the NMR doesn't show a peak for the phenol. Alternatively, perhaps the phenol O-H is exchanging and not showing up as a separate peak, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, the 11 ppm is the O-H of a carboxylic acid. Wait, no, carboxylic O-H is usually a broad peak that's not a singlet. Also, in the NMR, a singlet would suggest no neighboring protons. A carboxylic acid O-H would be a broad peak, not a singlet.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I should think about other aspects.

Looking at the molecular formula, C7H5ClO2. Let's compute the degree of unsaturation. Degrees of unsaturation = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Assuming no N or other atoms besides Cl.

C=7, H=5, X=Cl=1.

So (2*7 +2 -5 -1)/2 = (14+2=16; 16-5=11; 11-1=10) /2 =5. So 5 degrees: probably a benzene ring (3 degrees) and two double bonds (like carbonyl and another). So a benzene ring plus a carbonyl group.

Looking at the options:

A: benzene ring, aldehyde (C=O), hydroxyl. So 3+1+1 =5.

B: benzene, COOH: 3+2 (from COOH) =5.

C: benzene, COOCl: 3+2=5.

D: same as B.

So all options fit.

Now, looking at the NMR signals. The 11 ppm is a singlet (1H). If it's an aldehyde, then the aromatic protons would be as in option A. If it's a carboxylic acid, that 11 ppm would be the O-H, but as a broad peak. But the NMR shows a singlet, which implies no coupling. So perhaps it's an aldehyde.

In option A, the aromatic protons would be on a benzene ring with Cl, OH, and CHO substituents. So, the Hs would be at positions 4,5,6. The substituents are at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). So the ring would have Hs at positions 4,5,6.

Hs at 4 and 6 would be meta to OH and para to Cl. Hs at 5 would be ortho to Cl and meta to OH. But this would result in more complex splitting than the two doublets observed. So perhaps option A is less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the integration and the splitting.

The 8.02 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.72 (d, 2H) suggest that each set of Hs is equivalent and each is coupled to one other set, resulting in a doublet. That would happen in a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each in the 1 and 4 positions.

So, substituent 1 and substituent 4. Then, the Hs at positions 2 and 6 (ortho to substituent 1) would be one set, and Hs at 3 and 5 (ortho to substituent 4) would be another set. Each set would be a doublet due to coupling with the adjacent Hs.

If substituent 1 is COOH (benzoic acid) and substituent 4 is Cl (4-chlorobenzoic acid, option B), then the Hs ortho to COOH would be more deshielded (higher ppm) than the Hs ortho to Cl.

In this case, the Hs ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6) would be around 8.0 ppm, and the Hs ortho to Cl (positions 3 and 5) around 7.7 ppm. That matches the NMR data. Plus, the IR would show a broad O-H from the carboxylic acid and a sharp carbonyl around 1720 cm^-1.

Wait, but the IR's broad peak is from 3500-2700 cm^-1. For a carboxylic acid, the O-H stretch is usually around 2500-3300 cm^-1. So a peak from 3500-2700 might suggest a different O-H, like a phenol, but option B doesn't have a phenol. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the IR's broad peak is not O-H. But the only other possibility is an N-H, but none of the options have that. So I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, another point: in the mass spec, the molecular ion is at 156. The other peak is at 158, which is 2 mass units higher. That's consistent with a molecule containing a chlorine atom, as Cl has two main isotopes: 35Cl (75%) and 37Cl (25%). So the M+2 peak is at 32% intensity, which aligns with a single Cl atom: (37Cl is ~25% abundance, so the M+2 peak would be about 25% of M. But in the data it's 32%, which is a bit higher than expected. Hmm, maybe the calculation is approximate.

But back to the NMR. Another thing to note: the 8.02 and 7.72 peaks are each 2H. So perhaps each is a pair of equivalent protons. That fits with a 1,4-disubstituted benzene.

So putting it all together:

- The structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid (option B) or 2-chlorobenzoic acid (option D). Both have the same molecular formula.

But in option D, substituents are at 1 and 2, which would lead to more complex splitting than two doublets. So probably option B is correct.

But wait, the IR's broad peak. If it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H should be in the 2500-3300 region. The given IR has a broad peak from 3500-2700, which is lower than expected. So that doesn't fit with a carboxylic acid.

Wait, unless it's a different kind of O-H, like an alcohol. But none of the options have an alcohol group. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad peak is from an aliphatic O-H, but again, none of the options have that except option A, which also has an aldehyde.

Wait, but the NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm, which could be the aldehyde. So that would suggest option A.

But if option A is correct, the IR's broad peak would be the phenol O-H. So the IR's broad peak would be around 3500 cm^-1, which matches the given data. The sharp peak at 1720 would be the aldehyde's carbonyl.

In that case, the NMR would have:

- 11.0 ppm: aldehyde proton (s, 1H)
- 8.02 and 7.72: aromatic protons (d, 2H each)

But wait, option A's structure would have a phenol O-H, which usually appears around 5 ppm in NMR. But that's not present in the data. So that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the phenol O-H is not showing up because the solution is concentrated or in a different solvent, but I'm not sure.

Another angle: the integration. The 11 ppm peak is 1H. If it's an aldehyde, that makes sense. The 8.02 and 7.72 are each 2H, so four aromatic Hs. But option A only has three substituents on the ring, meaning there are three Hs on the ring. Wait, no, wait. Benzaldehyde has a benzene ring with five Hs. If there are substituents at positions 1,2,3, then the ring has three substituents and three Hs left. But the NMR shows four Hs (two in each doublet). So that doesn't fit. So option A's structure would have only three aromatic Hs, but the NMR shows four. So option A is not correct.

Ah, that's a key point. So if option A is considered, the ring would have three substituents (CHO at 1, OH at 2, Cl at 3), leaving Hs at positions 4,5,6. So three Hs. But the NMR shows four Hs (two doublets integrating to 2H each). So that rules out option A.

So, this leaves options B, C, and D. But wait, option C's structure has only a single substituent (the chloroformate group), so the ring would have five Hs, but the NMR shows four. So that's not matching.

So perhaps the correct structure is option B or D, which are 4-chlorobenzoic acid or 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

In that case, the ring has two substituents (COOH and Cl), leaving four Hs. So the NMR would show two doublets each integrating for 2H. That fits. So the structure is either B or D.

Now, how to differentiate between B and D based on NMR.

In option B (4-chlorobenzoic acid), the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). The ortho Hs (2 and 6) to COOH would be more deshielded and appear downfield, while the meta Hs (3 and 5) to COOH (and ortho to Cl) would be less deshielded.

In option D (2-chlorobenzoic acid), the substituents are at 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). The ortho Hs to Cl (3 and 6) would be more deshielded, while the para Hs (4 and 5) would be less deshielded.

So in option B, the downfield (higher ppm) Hs are ortho to COOH, which would be around 8.0 ppm, and the other set around 7.7 ppm.

In option D, the downfield Hs would be ortho to Cl, which would be more deshielded than meta to COOH. So in D, the Hs ortho to Cl would be at higher ppm than the Hs meta to COOH.

So the NMR shows 8.02 and 7.72. So which substituent would cause the Hs to be at those positions.

In option B: Hs ortho to COOH would be at 8.02, and Hs ortho to Cl would be at 7.72.

In option D: Hs ortho to Cl would be more deshielded, so higher ppm, say 8.02, and Hs meta to COOH would be at 7.72.

So both structures could fit the NMR data.

But how to decide between B and D.

Looking at the IR data. If the structure is a benzoic acid, the IR should show a broad O-H stretch around 2500-3300 cm^-1, but the IR here shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 2700 is lower than 2500. So the broad peak is from 3500 down to 2700, which seems too low for a carboxylic acid O-H.

Wait, but maybe it's a phenol O-H. So if the structure is option A, which has a phenol O-H, that would fit the IR. But earlier, we ruled out option A because the NMR didn't show the phenol O-H. So this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR's broad peak is not O-H at all. Could it be an aliphatic C-O stretch or something else? Not sure.

Wait, another thought: the peak at 1720 cm^-1 is strong and sharp, which is a carbonyl. For a benzoic acid, the carbonyl is around 1700 cm^-1. So 1720 is a bit higher, which could suggest an ester or aldehyde.

So if the carbonyl is at 1720, perhaps it's an ester or aldehyde.

Option C is phenyl chloroformate, which is an ester. Its carbonyl would be around 1740-1720 cm^-1. So that fits.

In that case, the IR's broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1 would have to be something else. But option C doesn't have an O-H group. So where is the broad peak coming from?

Hmm, perhaps it's an impurity or some other functional group. But since the options are given, I'll have to choose based on the data.

Wait, another possibility: the IR's broad peak is from an aliphatic C-O stretch. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a C-H stretch, but that's usually around 3000 cm^-1.

Alternatively, maybe the peak is from an aldehyde C-H stretch, but aldehyde C-H is around 2700-2800 cm^-1. The given IR's broad peak is from 3500-2700, which includes the 2700-2800 region. But aldehyde C-H is usually a medium-strong peak around 2820 and 2720 cm^-1, which could be part of the broad peak. But I'm not sure.

Putting this all together, I'm a bit stuck between options B and C.

Option B's NMR fits the data except for the IR, which may not align with the O-H position. Option C's IR fits the carbonyl but not the O-H.

Wait, what about the singlet at 11 ppm? If it's an aldehyde, then option C doesn't have an aldehyde. So that can't be. So perhaps option C isn't correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

But wait, the IR's O-H peak is a problem. Alternatively, perhaps the IR's broad peak isn't O-H but something else.

Alternatively, maybe the IR's broad peak is from an aliphatic amine or something else, but since none of the options have that, I'm back to square one.

Another approach: think about the molecular formula and possible functional groups.

If the structure is option C: phenyl chloroformate (O-CO-Cl attached to benzene), then the functional group is an acid chloride ester. The IR would show a strong carbonyl around 1720 cm^-1, which matches. But where is the broad peak from 3500-2700? If there's no O-H, then maybe it's an aliphatic C-O stretch, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's due to the Cl in the molecule. But Cl doesn't usually cause such broad peaks.

Wait, maybe the broad peak is from an impurity or the solvent. But that seems unlikely.

So, if the correct structure is option C, then the NMR would have the aromatic protons as a set of two doublets. But the structure of option C has only one substituent, making the ring have five Hs, which would require more complex splitting than the data shows. So that doesn't fit.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

But I'm still a bit unsure about the IR's O-H position. Maybe the broad peak in the IR is from another group, but I can't think of what.

Alternatively, perhaps the IR's broad peak isn't O-H but an aldehyde C-H stretch. But aldehyde C-H is around 2720 cm^-1, which is within the given range. However, the C-H stretch is usually a medium peak, not very broad. But the given peak is broad, which is more typical of O-H.

Hmm. Another angle: looking at the integration of the NMR signals.

The 11 ppm is a singlet of 1H. If it's a COOH O-H, that's not possible because COOH O-H is a broad peak and would be a singlet. But in the NMR, it's a singlet, which suggests no splitting, which fits with an O-H that's not exchanging. But carboxylic O-H is usually a broad peak, not a singlet. So this is conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the 11 ppm is the aldehyde proton. In that case, the structure must have an aldehyde. But then, looking back, only option A has an aldehyde, but its NMR doesn't fit the data.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount.

Option A's structure: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

The benzene ring would have substituents at 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), 3 (Cl). So the remaining Hs are at 4,5,6. Let me draw the structure:

Positions:

1: CHO

2: OH

3: Cl

So the Hs are at 4,5,6.

H4 is between Cl (3) and H5.

H5 is between H4 and H6.

H6 is between H5 and CHO (1).

So in this structure, H4 is ortho to Cl, H6 is ortho to CHO, and H5 is meta to both.

So in the NMR, the Hs would be:

H4: ortho to Cl, which is a strong EWG, so downfield.

H5: meta to Cl and ortho to H4.

H6: ortho to CHO, which is an EWG, so downfield.

But the NMR shows two doublets each of 2H, so four Hs. But this structure only has three Hs on the ring. So that's a mismatch. So option A is not correct.

So back to options B and D.

If the structure is 4-chlorobenzoic acid (B), the aromatic Hs would be two doublets at 8.02 and 7.72. The 11 ppm peak would be the aldehyde, but option B doesn't have an aldehyde. So this doesn't fit.

Wait, this is getting me more confused. Let me try to think differently.

Another way: the 1H NMR shows a singlet at 11 ppm. What functional groups give a singlet? It could be an aldehyde proton, which is usually a singlet because it has no adjacent Hs. Or a proton that's not split by any neighboring Hs, such as in a symmetric environment.

If it's an aldehyde, then the structure must have an aldehyde group, which is option A or perhaps another structure not listed. But according to the options, only A has an aldehyde.

But earlier, I thought option A couldn't be right due to the NMR not matching. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the 11 ppm is not an aldehyde. Another possibility: it's an aromatic proton in a highly deshielded environment. But that's unlikely because aromatic protons are usually between 6.5-8.5 ppm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a carbonyl oxygen and not a proton. No, the question says 1H NMR.

Wait, another thought: the singlet at 11 ppm could be an exchangeable proton that's not observed, but that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a ketone or ester proton, but those don't have protons attached.

Wait, but I'm stuck. Let me try to go back to the options and see which one fits all data.

Option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.

- Molecular formula: C7H5ClO2. Fits molecular ion at 156.

- IR: strong peak at 1720 cm^-1 (carbonyl of COOH, which is around 1700, but could be higher). The broad peak at 3500-2700 could be O-H, but it's not in the usual region. However, perhaps the O-H is deprotonated or the measurement conditions shift it.

- NMR: 11 ppm singlet can't be explained by this structure, as it doesn't have an aldehyde. So this is a problem.

Option D: 2-chlorobenzoic acid.

Same molecular formula.

IR: same as B.

NMR: the aromatic Hs would be ortho to Cl and meta to COOH. So Hs ortho to Cl would be more deshielded, appearing at higher ppm. So the 8.02 and 7.72 would correspond to Hs ortho to Cl and meta to COOH. But the 11 ppm singlet still doesn't fit.

Option C: Phenyl chloroformate.

- Molecular formula: C7H5ClO2.

- IR: strong carbonyl at 1720 cm^-1 (ester or acid chloride), which fits.

- NMR: should have aromatic protons. But in this structure, the substituent is one, leading to five aromatic Hs. The given NMR shows four, so perhaps this isn't the case. Also, the 11 ppm singlet doesn't fit unless it's something else.

So the only structure that fits most of the data is option B or D, but the 11 ppm is a problem.

Wait, perhaps the 11 ppm is not part of the aromatic protons. Wait, the 11 ppm could be the aldehyde, but in that case, the structure must have an aldehyde, which is only option A. But earlier analysis suggests option A isn't correct because of the NMR.

Wait, another angle: the 11 ppm peak is a singlet. If it's an aldehyde, perhaps the aromatic ring is such that the aldehyde is at position 1, and the substituents are at positions 2 and 4. So the aromatic Hs would be at positions 3,5,6. But I'm not sure how that would split.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde is at position 1, and the substituents are at 2 and 4. The Hs would be at 3,5,6. But that would give three Hs, which doesn't fit the NMR data.

Another thought: perhaps the structure isn't a benzoic acid or aldehyde but an ester with an aldehyde group. But none of the options fit that.

Hmmm. Maybe I'm missing something in the IR. The IR shows a broad peak from 3500-2700 cm^-1. Could that be an O-H from a carboxylic acid? It's usually higher. Or perhaps it's an alcohol. But the options don't have an alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the broad peak is a combination of O-H and C-H stretches. But that's speculative.

Another possibility: the broad peak is from an aromatic ring's C-H stretch. But that's usually around 3000-3100 cm^-1, not 3500-2700.

Alternatively, maybe it's the stretching of the C-Cl bond, but I don't think that's a broad peak.

Alternatively, perhaps the peak is from a conjugated system, but I'm not sure.

Given all this, I'm going to have to make an educated guess. The NMR data points towards a para-substituted benzene with two substituents, each causing the aromatic protons to split into two doublets. The 11 ppm singlet suggests an aldehyde proton, which would fit with option A. However, the aromatic substitution in option A doesn't match the NMR's two doublets.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recount the substitution pattern for option A.

Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

The substituents are at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). So the Hs are at 4,5,6.

H4 is between Cl (3) and H5.

H5 is between H4 and H6.

H6 is between H5 and CHO (1).

So the substituents are in positions 1,2,3. The Hs are at 4,5,6.

H4 is ortho to Cl (3), meta to OH (2), and para to CHO (1).

H5 is meta to Cl (3), para to OH (2), and ortho to H4 and H6.

H6 is ortho to CHO (1), meta to OH (2), and ortho to H5.

This would result in three distinct sets of protons, not two doublets. So the NMR for option A would have three signals, not two. So that doesn't match the given data.

So I'm back to options B and D.

Assuming the 11 ppm is not part of the aromatic protons, perhaps it's another group. But I can't think of what.

Wait, maybe the 11 ppm is a carbonyl oxygen and not a proton. No, that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake in the data, but I can't assume that.

At this point, I'll have to make a choice based on the available data.

The NMR indicates two sets of aromatic protons, suggesting a 1,4-disubstituted benzene. The IR's carbonyl at 1720 suggests a strong C=O, which fits benzoic acid or an ester. The molecular formula fits both.

But the broad peak in IR is lower than expected for a carboxylic acid. So perhaps it's an ester.

Option C is phenyl chloroformate, which is an ester. Its structure is Cl-CO-O-Ph. The IR would have a strong carbonyl around 1720, which fits. But the NMR would show more than two sets of aromatic protons unless the substituent is in a specific position.

Wait, phenyl chloroformate has the substituent as O-CO-Cl. So the substituent is in one position. The aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,4,5,6. The Hs at 2 and 6 would be ortho to the substituent, and 3,4,5 would be meta or para. But that would require more than two sets, so the NMR doesn't fit.

So, perhaps the correct answer is option C, despite the NMR not matching. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid. The NMR's two doublets fit the para substitution, and the molecular formula fits. The IR's carbonyl fits, and the broad peak could be an O-H, even if it's a bit lower than expected.

So, given all that, I'll conclude that the correct answer is option B: 4-chlorobenzoic acid.


The problem involves identifying an unknown compound based on spectral data. The molecular ion peak at **m/z = 156** suggests a molecular formula of **C₇H₅ClO₂**. The **m/z = 158** peak indicates the presence of chlorine, as it accounts for the isotopic contribution of chlorine (Cl-37). The IR spectrum shows a **broad peak from 3500-2700 cm⁻¹**, likely corresponding to an O-H stretch, and a **strong sharp peak at 1720 cm⁻¹**, indicative of a carbonyl group. The ¹H NMR spectrum includes a **singlet at 11.0 ppm (1H)**, and two **doublets at 8.02 ppm (2H)** and **7.72 ppm (2H)**, suggesting a para-substituted aromatic ring.

### Analysis of Options:

1. **Option A: 3-Chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde**  
   This compound contains a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (CHO), 2 (OH), and 3 (Cl). The aromatic protons at positions 4, 5, and 6 would result in three distinct signals in the NMR spectrum, not two doublets. Additionally, the phenol O-H proton typically appears around 5 ppm, which is absent in the given NMR data. Thus, this option is inconsistent with the NMR data.

2. **Option B: 4-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound has a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 4 (Cl). The aromatic protons at positions 2, 3, 5, and 6 would split into two doublets, consistent with the NMR data. The carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ aligns with the carboxylic acid group, and the broad peak in the IR spectrum can be attributed to the O-H stretch of the carboxylic acid. This option fits the molecular formula, IR, and NMR data.

3. **Option C: Phenyl chloroformate**  
   This compound has a benzene ring with a single substituent, **Cl-CO-O-**, leading to five aromatic protons. The NMR data only shows four aromatic protons (two doublets), which does not match. Additionally, this compound lacks an O-H group, making the broad IR peak inconsistent. Thus, this option is not viable.

4. **Option D: 2-Chlorobenzoic acid**  
   This compound has a benzene ring with substituents at positions 1 (COOH) and 2 (Cl). The aromatic protons at positions 3, 4, 5, and 6 would split into two doublets, similar to option B. However, the substitution pattern would result in different chemical shifts for the aromatic protons compared to the NMR data. Additionally, the IR and NMR data are consistent with a para-substituted benzene, not an ortho-substituted one. Thus, this option is less likely than option B.

### Conclusion:
The molecular formula, IR data, and NMR data are best explained by **4-chlorobenzoic acid**. The para-substitution pattern accounts for the two doublets in the NMR spectrum, and the IR data aligns with the functional groups present. 

**Answer: B**
