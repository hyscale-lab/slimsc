Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, molecules can have rotational and vibrational energy levels. The problem says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Right, because rigid rotor models don't account for bond length changes.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So that's the ground state. And the question is about what photon momentum is needed for it to switch to the next lowest energy state. So I guess this is a transition from the ground state to the next higher state. But wait, diatomic molecules have both rotational and vibrational energy states. Oh wait, in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized for rotation, and in the vibrational model, it's quantized for vibration. But the non-rigid rotor model might combine both?

Wait, the question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is a model where both rotation and vibration are considered. So the energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational energies. Hmm, but how do they interact?

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. So for a diatomic, the fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). Wait, for rigid rotor, the rotational ground state is J=0, but for non-rigid rotor, perhaps it's different? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the question says it's in the fundamental state. So the molecular state is the combination of the lowest vibrational and the lowest rotational state. So the current state is the ground state of both vibrations and rotations.

When it absorbs a photon, it must transition to the next higher energy state. But what's the next possible state? It could either increase the vibrational quantum number, the rotational, or both. But since we're looking for the lowest possible energy increment, I think it's the smallest possible energy change, which would be just the vibrational transition. Because rotational transitions might require higher energy.

Wait, but wait. Vibrational transitions usually have higher energy gaps than rotational. So if the molecule is in the ground state, the next possible state with the smallest energy would be the next rotational state. Or maybe the next vibrational state. I'm getting a little confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition is to the next higher energy state, which is either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. The question is about the photon momentum needed for that.

Wait, but the given data includes angular frequency w for vibration. So maybe the photon is absorbed to increase the vibrational state, since the rotational part would have a lower frequency. Or wait, the rotational energy levels have spacing that depends on the moment of inertia. The vibrational energy spacing is given by w.

Wait, so the energy of a photon is E = hν, where ν is the frequency. But for a transition between vibrational states, the energy change is ΔE_vib = h w (v+1 - v). So from v=0 to v=1, ΔE = h w.

But for rotational transitions, the energy change is ΔE_rot = B (J+1 - J), where B is the rotational constant. So from J=0 to J=1, ΔE_rot = B (1 - 0) = B.

Now, which transition requires a smaller photon energy? Because the photon momentum is related to its energy. The photon's momentum p is E/c. So if the rotational transition requires less energy, then that's the answer. But I'm not sure which is smaller between B and w.

Wait, the given w is 4e14 rad/s. Let me compute what that would translate to in terms of frequency, but wait, w is angular frequency, which is 2π times the regular frequency ν. So ν = w/(2π). So the vibrational frequency is about 4e14/(2π) ≈ (4e14)/(6.28) ≈ 6.37e13 Hz.

What about the rotational constant B? B is given by (h/(8π² I c)), but wait, I'm a bit confused about the formula. Alternatively, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = h²/(8 π² I). So I need to calculate B.

Wait, I have to compute the moment of inertia I. I is the moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule, which is I = μ r². Here, μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

The masses are Mx =20 amu and My=2 amu. So the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20*2)/(22) amu = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Since 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg, μ ≈1.818 * 1.66e-27 = approx 3.01e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ r² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 *4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Now, B is h²/(8 π² I). h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s. So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J² s².

So B= (4.39e-67) / (8 π² * 1.204e-46 kg m² )

Let me compute denominator: 8 π² is about 8*(9.87)≈78.96. Multiply by I=1.204e-46: 78.96 *1.204e-46≈95.06e-46 =9.506e-45.

So B =4.39e-67 / 9.506e-45 ≈ 4.617e-23 J.

Now, the energy for the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is ΔE_rot = B (1 - 0) = B ≈4.617e-23 J.

The vibrational transition ΔE_vib is h w. Given w is 4e14 rad/s. So ΔE_vib = h * w. h is 6.626e-34 J s. So 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Comparing the two, the rotational transition requires about 4.6e-23 J, and the vibrational requires 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition is much lower in energy. So the molecule would need to absorb a photon with the energy of the rotational transition.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state, so both vibrational (v=0) and rotational (J=0) states. When it absorbs a photon, it can transition either to a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But which one is the next possible state in terms of the lowest energy?

Because the rotational transition requires much less energy, it's more likely that the photon would cause a rotational transition. So the photon's momentum would correspond to the rotational energy change.

But wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So it's asking for the next possible state which is the minimal energy increment. So the minimal energy transition is the rotational one.

So the photon's energy would be E = ΔE_rot = 4.617e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Momentum p is related to energy E by p = E/(c), since E = pc for a photon. So c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (4.617e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 1.539e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are around 1e-31. Let me check the options:

A) 1.9e-28
B)2.3e-27
C)1.1e-27
D)1.4e-28

Hmm, none of these are close to 1e-31. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the transition in the vibration-rotation coupling, i.e., the energy levels are a combination of both vibrational and rotational. So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. The energy of the first transition (v=1) would be higher than the rotational one, so the minimal energy transition would be the rotational one.

But perhaps the model is such that the rotational state can't change without a vibrational change? I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering a transition from the ground state (J=0, v=0) to the next state, which is (J=1, v=0). That would be a rotational transition. So the energy needed is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a transition to the next vibrational state, which would have much higher energy.

Wait, but the given options are much higher than what I calculated. My calculation for the rotational transition gives p = ~1.5e-31 kg m/s, which is 1.5e-31 Ns (since 1 Ns = 1 kg m/s).

Looking at the options, the smallest is D)1.4e-28, which is about 1000 times larger than my calculated value. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check the moment of inertia calculation. I said μ is 1.818 amu. Each amu is 1.66e-27 kg. So 1.818 * 1.66e-27 = let's compute that. 1.8 *1.66 is about 3. So 1.818*1.66= approx (1.8*1.66)=2.988, plus (0.018 *1.66)=0.03. So total ~3.018e-27 kg.

Bond length r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. Then I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

B = h²/(8 π² I) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 * π² * 1.207e-46)

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = approximately (6.626)^2 =43.9, so 43.9e-68 =4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 pi^2 is about 8*(9.8696) ≈78.9568. Multiply by I: 78.9568 *1.207e-46 ≈95.22e-46 =9.522e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.522e-45 = approximately 4.61e-23 J.

Hmm, that's correct. So the rotational energy for J=0 to J=1 is 4.61e-23 J.

Photon's momentum p = E/c = 4.61e-23 / 3e8 = ~1.537e-31 kg m/s, which is 1.537e-31 Ns.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps my approach is wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the question is not about the rotational transition but about the vibrational transition. So if we calculate the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition.

Energy of the vibrational transition is E = h w. So that's 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Momentum p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = ~8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. So 8.8e-28 is closer to option A or D. But wait, let's compute more precisely.

Wait, w is 4e14 rad/s. So E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p = E_vib / c = 2.6504e-19 / (3e8) = 8.834e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.8e-28 Ns. But the options don't have this value. The closest is option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28). Hmm, so 8.8e-28 is about 6 times larger than option D, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem requires the molecule to make a transition that increases both vibrational and rotational states. But that would require more energy, so it's not the minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the rotation and vibration as separate, and the photon's energy must account for both. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is considering the molecule in a certain state and the next allowed state, but I'm not entirely clear. Alternatively, perhaps the model being considered is the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator, where the energy levels are quantized in both rotation and vibration.

In such a model, the total energy is E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational and rotational states.

Now, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can transition either to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But which transition requires lower energy? 

As calculated earlier, the rotational transition (ΔE_rot ≈4.6e-23 J) is much lower than the vibrational (ΔE_vib≈2.65e-19 J). So the minimal energy transition is the rotational one.

But according to this, the photon's momentum should be around 1.5e-31 Ns, but the options are way higher. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the transition to the next state which is a combination of vibrational and rotational, but that would require more energy. Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is a certain vibration and rotation state, and the next state is the next possible in terms of energy, whether rotation or vibration.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the first excited state, which in the rotation-vibration model is the first state that is higher than the ground state. But what's the energy of the ground state?

In the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator model, the ground state energy is E_ground = (3/2) h w_rot + (1/2) h w_vib. Wait, wait, no, that's not right. The rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), and for J=0, E_rot =0. The vibrational energy is E_vib = (1/2) h w + ... Wait, no, for a harmonic oscillator, the ground state energy is (1/2) h w. So the total energy of the ground state would be (1/2) h w + 0 = (1/2) h w.

If the molecule is in the ground state, to transition to the next possible state, which is the lowest energy state higher than the ground state. The next state could be either the first rotational state (J=1) or the first vibrational state (v=1).

The energy of J=1 is E_rot = B*(1)(2) = 2 B. The energy of v=1 is E_vib = h w (1) [since from v=0 to v=1, ΔE = h w].

So which is smaller? Calculate 2B and compare with h w.

Earlier, B was found to be approximately 4.617e-23 J. So 2 B is ~9.23e-23 J.

h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So 2B is much smaller than h w, so the next state with the lowest energy is the J=1 state. So the photon's energy is 2B.

Wait, so E_photon = 2 B = 9.23e-23 J.

Momentum p = E_photon / c = 9.23e-23 /3e8 = 3.077e-31 kg m/s = 3.08e-31 Ns.

But again, the options are way larger. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, let me recheck the rotational energy. For J=0 to J=1, the change is ΔE_rot = B [J=1 (J+1=2) - J=0 (0)] = 2B.

Wait, yes, correct. So the photon's energy is 2B = 9.23e-23 J.

So p = 9.23e-23 /3e8 = ~3.08e-31 kg m/s.

But the options don't have this. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the initial state or the transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition to the next vibrational state, which requires a photon of higher energy, corresponding to option A (1.9e-28).

But 1e-28 is 1e7 times larger than 1e-35, which is way beyond our earlier calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B.

Wait, let me recalculate B.

B = h²/(8 π² I)

h = 6.626e-34 J s

I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, (2e-10)^2 is 4e-20, so I = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

So B = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 π² *1.207e-46 )

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 =43.9 →43.9e-68 =4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 π² =8*(9.8696)=78.957. 78.957 *1.207e-46 = approximately 78.957 *1.207 = 95.25e-46 →9.525e-45.

So B =4.39e-67 /9.525e-45 = ~4.61e-23 J.

So that's correct. So the energy for J=0→1 is 2B=9.22e-23 J.

So p=9.22e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 Ns.

Hmm, but the options are way larger. So perhaps I'm missing a factor, or the question is about something else.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the molecule in a state with both rotation and vibration. Alternatively, perhaps the model combines rotation and vibration such that the energy levels are a product of both. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs it to transition to the next state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition, but perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition.

Wait, but in that case, the energy is 2.65e-19 J, momentum p=8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 → approx 0.215 times 8.83e-28.

B)2.3e-27 → about 26 times higher.

C)1.1e-27 → about 12.4 times higher.

D)1.4e-28 → about 1.64 times lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute E_vib and p.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E_vib = h * w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p = E_vib / c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.8346e-28 kg m/s →8.8346e-28 Ns.

So p ≈8.8e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is less than 8.8e-28. Option D is 1.4e-28, which is even smaller. So none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition, but the w given is 4e14 rad/s, and the angular frequency in the energy equation for rotation is different. Wait, but the rotational energy is determined by B, which is in terms of the moment of inertia.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the photon's momentum that would cause a transition to the next vibrational state, which would be E = h w. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition as the required next state because the rotational transitions are not allowed in this model.

Wait, sometimes in diatomic molecules, the rotational transitions are only allowed with a change in J by ±2, but that's in the rigid rotor model for pure rotational spectra. But in the case of a vibration-rotation transition, rotational changes of ±1 are allowed when combined with a vibrational change.

Hmm, perhaps the molecule is allowed to transition to a higher vibrational state along with a rotational change. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the minimal energy transition would be the vibrational one, but the rotational one requires less energy.

Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck because the calculated values don't match the options. Let me think about the possible mistake.

Wait, maybe I confused the moment of inertia formula. Wait, I used I = μ r². That's correct for a diatomic molecule. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the photon momentum for the vibrational transition, which is 8.8e-28 Ns. The closest option is option A (1.9e-28) is half of that. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the transition.

Wait, another possibility: in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized but the bond length is variable, so the moment of inertia can change. But I'm not sure how that affects the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying and treating the molecule as a harmonic oscillator, so the energy levels are E = (n + 1/2) h w, where n is the vibrational quantum number. So the fundamental state is n=0. The next state is n=1, so ΔE = h w.

In that case, the photon's energy is h w, and the momentum is E/c = h w /c.

So let me compute that:

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E_photon =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p= E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 Ns.

Again, the same result. But the options don't have this. So maybe the question is about a transition to the next rotational state, but perhaps the initial state is not J=0, but another state.

Wait, the problem states the molecule is in the "fundamental state", which is the lowest vibrational and rotational states. So for rotation, J=0. So the transition is to J=1, which is the next state.

But again, that calculation leads to p of about 1.5e-31 Ns, which isn't in the options.

Hmm, perhaps the question is considering the molecule as a harmonic oscillator, but not the rotational part. So the photon's energy is just h w, and the momentum is E/c.

Wait, but that gives me approximately 8.8e-28 Ns, which isn't exactly any of the options. Wait, looking at option A: 1.9e-28. 8.8e-28 is about 4.63 times larger than option B (2.3e-27 is way bigger). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me double-check the reduced mass.

Masses are Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) =40/22 = 1.818 amu.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the bond length is given in angstroms, but I treated it as meters. Wait, no, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I should express the bond length in meters correctly. 2 angstroms is 0.2 nanometers, which is 2e-10 meters.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the rotational energy calculation. Let me recheck.

The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = h²/(8 π² I). So when J increases by 1, the energy increases by B*(2J +1).

So from J=0 to J=1, ΔE_rot = B*(1)(2) = 2B.

Wait, yes. So that's correct.

Wait another thought: perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy to be the sum of the vibrational and rotational transitions. That would give a higher energy, but that would require a larger photon, which isn't the minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state that includes both a vibrational and rotational change, but that would be more energy than either alone.

Wait, perhaps the model is such that the molecule can't change its vibrational state without also changing its rotational state. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule in the ground state of rotation but the first vibrational state. But the question says it's in the fundamental state, which I think implies the lowest energy state for both.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck because my calculations don't align with the given options. Let me think about the options again. The options are all around 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational transition's momentum again.

Earlier calculation: E_rot = 4.617e-23 J.

p = E_rot / c = 4.617e-23 /3e8 = 1.539e-31 kg m/s →1.539e-31 Ns.

But the options are higher by about 1e6 to 1e7 times. So perhaps I missed a factor of 1e6 or something. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Another approach is to compute the photon's momentum using the angular frequency. Because p = h bar * k, where k is the wave number. And since E = h w, and p = E/c, but also p = h bar *k, where k = w/c.

Wait, h bar is h/(2 pi). So p = (h/(2 pi)) * (w/c) ) → p = h w/(2 pi c).

Let me compute that.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So p = (6.626e-34 *4e14) / (2 pi *3e8).

Compute numerator:6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J s.

Denominator: 2 pi *3e8 ≈6.283 *3e8 =1.885e9.

So p=2.6504e-19 /1.885e9 ≈1.407e-28 kg m/s →1.407e-28 Ns.

Wait, that's approximately option D, which is 1.4e-28.

Wait, but this is for the photon's momentum when E = h w, which is the vibrational transition. So why did I get this approach? Because I used p = h w/(2 pi c) → which simplifies to E/(c) because E = h w = pc, so p= E/(c). So wait, this method gives the same result as before. Hmm.

Wait, but according to this, the momentum is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

Wait, earlier I thought that the vibrational transition requires a photon of momentum 8.8e-28 Ns, but this new approach gives 1.4e-28. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute p = (h w) / (2 pi c).

h=6.626e-34, w=4e14.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

2 pi c = 2 *3.1416 *3e8 ≈1.885e9 m/s.

So p = 2.6504e-19 / 1.885e9 = approximately 1.407e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 1.4e-28 Ns.

So that's option D.

Wait, so perhaps that's the correct approach. But why did I get a different value earlier?

Ah, because I think I confused the formula. When dealing with momentum, p = h bar * k, where k is the wave number. The wave number k is w/c. So p = h bar * (w/c).

h bar = h/(2 pi). So p = (h/(2 pi)) * (w/c) = h w/(2 pi c).

Yes, which gives us 1.4e-28 Ns, matching option D.

But wait, earlier I thought that the rotational transition is much lower in energy. So why are we considering the vibrational transition?

Ah, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule transitions to the next state, which is a vibrational transition. But why would that be the case if the rotational transition requires less energy?

Wait, perhaps the model being used in the question doesn't allow for pure rotational transitions, only vibration-rotation transitions. Or perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state but the ground rotational state, and the next state is the first vibrational state.

But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum to cause a transition to the next state, which would be the first excited vibrational state, which requires a photon of higher energy.

But why is the calculated value using the vibrational transition matching option D?

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So perhaps the next state is the first vibrational state (v=1), which requires a photon of momentum 1.4e-28 Ns.

But why is the rotational transition's momentum not matching any options?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rotational transition's calculation. Let me re-express the rotational transition's photon momentum.

The rotational energy change is ΔE_rot = 2B, which is about 9.23e-23 J.

So p_rot = ΔE_rot / c =9.23e-23 /3e8 =3.077e-31 kg m/s →3.077e-31 Ns.

This is much smaller than the options. So perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, which gives p ≈1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But why? Because the rotational transition requires less energy, so the minimal would be the rotational.

But the options don't have the rotational's value. So perhaps the question is considering the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

But wait, in the calculation using the vibrational transition, p =1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the problem using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The goal is to calculate the photon's momentum needed for the molecule to transition to the next state with the smallest energy increment.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Transitions**:
   - The molecule can transition to either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). The energy required for these transitions is:
     - **Vibrational transition**: \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega \), where \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \).
     - **Rotational transition**: \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \), where \( B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} \) is the rotational constant, and \( I = \mu r^2 \) is the moment of inertia.

2. **Moment of Inertia**:
   - The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \, \text{amu} \times 2 \, \text{amu}}{20 \, \text{amu} + 2 \, \text{amu}} = 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
     \]
     Converting to kilograms (\( 1 \, \text{amu} \approx 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)):
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
     \]
   - The bond length \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Thus, the moment of inertia is:
     \[
     I = \mu r^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \, \text{m}^2.
     \]

3. **Rotational Constant**:
   - The rotational constant \( B \) is:
     \[
     B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I}.
     \]
     Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \, \text{s} \) and \( I = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \, \text{m}^2 \):
     \[
     B = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 (1.207 \times 10^{-46})} \approx 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - The energy required for the rotational transition (J=0 to J=1) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \times 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]

4. **Photon Momentum for Rotational Transition**:
   - The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). For the rotational transition:
     \[
     p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
     \]
     This value is much smaller than any of the given options, suggesting the rotational transition is not the intended focus.

5. **Photon Momentum for Vibrational Transition**:
   - The energy required for the vibrational transition (v=0 to v=1) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - The momentum of the photon for this transition is:
     \[
     p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
     \]
     This value is also not directly listed among the options.

6. **Revisiting the Vibrational Transition**:
   - Using the formula \( p = \frac{h \omega}{2 \pi c} \), where \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \), \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \, \text{s} \), and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):
     \[
     p = \frac{h \omega}{2 \pi c} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (4 \times 10^{14})}{2 \pi \times 3 \times 10^8}.
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     p \approx \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{1.885 \times 10^9} \approx 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
     \]
     This matches option **D**.

### Conclusion:
The question likely focuses on the vibrational transition, as the rotational transition's momentum does not align with the given options. The photon's momentum required for the vibrational transition is approximately \( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \), corresponding to option **D**.

**Answer: D**

Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is about a diatomic molecule switching energy states when it absorbs a photon. Hmm, I remember that in quantum mechanics, molecules can have rotational and vibrational energy levels. The problem says it's modeled using the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is also called the non-rigid rotor model. Right, because rigid rotor models don't account for bond length changes.

The molecule is in its fundamental state. Wait, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, right? So that's the ground state. And the question is about what photon momentum is needed for it to switch to the next lowest energy state. So I guess this is a transition from the ground state to the next higher state. But wait, diatomic molecules have both rotational and vibrational energy states. Oh wait, in the rigid rotor model, the energy levels are quantized for rotation, and in the vibrational model, it's quantized for vibration. But the non-rigid rotor model might combine both?

Wait, the question mentions the quantum rotation-vibration model, which I think is a model where both rotation and vibration are considered. So the energy levels are a combination of both rotational and vibrational energies. Hmm, but how do they interact?

Wait, the molecule is in its fundamental state. So for a diatomic, the fundamental state would be the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (like J=0 or J=1, depending on the model). Wait, for rigid rotor, the rotational ground state is J=0, but for non-rigid rotor, perhaps it's different? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the question says it's in the fundamental state. So the molecular state is the combination of the lowest vibrational and the lowest rotational state. So the current state is the ground state of both vibrations and rotations.

When it absorbs a photon, it must transition to the next higher energy state. But what's the next possible state? It could either increase the vibrational quantum number, the rotational, or both. But since we're looking for the lowest possible energy increment, I think it's the smallest possible energy change, which would be just the vibrational transition. Because rotational transitions might require higher energy.

Wait, but wait. Vibrational transitions usually have higher energy gaps than rotational. So if the molecule is in the ground state, the next possible state with the smallest energy would be the next rotational state. Or maybe the next vibrational state. I'm getting a little confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition is to the next higher energy state, which is either a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. The question is about the photon momentum needed for that.

Wait, but the given data includes angular frequency w for vibration. So maybe the photon is absorbed to increase the vibrational state, since the rotational part would have a lower frequency. Or wait, the rotational energy levels have spacing that depends on the moment of inertia. The vibrational energy spacing is given by w.

Wait, so the energy of a photon is E = hν, where ν is the frequency. But for a transition between vibrational states, the energy change is ΔE_vib = h w (v+1 - v). So from v=0 to v=1, ΔE = h w.

But for rotational transitions, the energy change is ΔE_rot = B (J+1 - J), where B is the rotational constant. So from J=0 to J=1, ΔE_rot = B (1 - 0) = B.

Now, which transition requires a smaller photon energy? Because the photon momentum is related to its energy. The photon's momentum p is E/c. So if the rotational transition requires less energy, then that's the answer. But I'm not sure which is smaller between B and w.

Wait, the given w is 4e14 rad/s. Let me compute what that would translate to in terms of frequency, but wait, w is angular frequency, which is 2π times the regular frequency ν. So ν = w/(2π). So the vibrational frequency is about 4e14/(2π) ≈ (4e14)/(6.28) ≈ 6.37e13 Hz.

What about the rotational constant B? B is given by (h/(8π² I c)), but wait, I'm a bit confused about the formula. Alternatively, the rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = h²/(8 π² I). So I need to calculate B.

Wait, I have to compute the moment of inertia I. I is the moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule, which is I = μ r². Here, μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

The masses are Mx =20 amu and My=2 amu. So the reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) = (20*2)/(22) amu = 40/22 ≈ 1.818 amu. Since 1 amu is approximately 1.66e-27 kg, μ ≈1.818 * 1.66e-27 = approx 3.01e-27 kg.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

So I = μ r² = 3.01e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.01e-27 *4e-20 = 1.204e-46 kg m².

Now, B is h²/(8 π² I). h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J s. So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ 4.39e-67 J² s².

So B= (4.39e-67) / (8 π² * 1.204e-46 kg m² )

Let me compute denominator: 8 π² is about 8*(9.87)≈78.96. Multiply by I=1.204e-46: 78.96 *1.204e-46≈95.06e-46 =9.506e-45.

So B =4.39e-67 / 9.506e-45 ≈ 4.617e-23 J.

Now, the energy for the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 is ΔE_rot = B (1 - 0) = B ≈4.617e-23 J.

The vibrational transition ΔE_vib is h w. Given w is 4e14 rad/s. So ΔE_vib = h * w. h is 6.626e-34 J s. So 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Comparing the two, the rotational transition requires about 4.6e-23 J, and the vibrational requires 2.65e-19 J. So the rotational transition is much lower in energy. So the molecule would need to absorb a photon with the energy of the rotational transition.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state, so both vibrational (v=0) and rotational (J=0) states. When it absorbs a photon, it can transition either to a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). But which one is the next possible state in terms of the lowest energy?

Because the rotational transition requires much less energy, it's more likely that the photon would cause a rotational transition. So the photon's momentum would correspond to the rotational energy change.

But wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So it's asking for the next possible state which is the minimal energy increment. So the minimal energy transition is the rotational one.

So the photon's energy would be E = ΔE_rot = 4.617e-23 J.

But wait, the question is about the momentum of the photon. Momentum p is related to energy E by p = E/(c), since E = pc for a photon. So c is the speed of light, approximately 3e8 m/s.

So p = (4.617e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = 1.539e-31 kg m/s.

Wait, but none of the options are around 1e-31. Let me check the options:

A) 1.9e-28
B)2.3e-27
C)1.1e-27
D)1.4e-28

Hmm, none of these are close to 1e-31. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the transition in the vibration-rotation coupling, i.e., the energy levels are a combination of both vibrational and rotational. So the fundamental state is v=0, J=0. The next state could be either v=1, J=0 or v=0, J=1. The energy of the first transition (v=1) would be higher than the rotational one, so the minimal energy transition would be the rotational one.

But perhaps the model is such that the rotational state can't change without a vibrational change? I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering a transition from the ground state (J=0, v=0) to the next state, which is (J=1, v=0). That would be a rotational transition. So the energy needed is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a transition to the next vibrational state, which would have much higher energy.

Wait, but the given options are much higher than what I calculated. My calculation for the rotational transition gives p = ~1.5e-31 kg m/s, which is 1.5e-31 Ns (since 1 Ns = 1 kg m/s).

Looking at the options, the smallest is D)1.4e-28, which is about 1000 times larger than my calculated value. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me double-check the moment of inertia calculation. I said μ is 1.818 amu. Each amu is 1.66e-27 kg. So 1.818 * 1.66e-27 = let's compute that. 1.8 *1.66 is about 3. So 1.818*1.66= approx (1.8*1.66)=2.988, plus (0.018 *1.66)=0.03. So total ~3.018e-27 kg.

Bond length r is 2 angstroms = 2e-10 meters. Then I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

B = h²/(8 π² I) = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 * π² * 1.207e-46)

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = approximately (6.626)^2 =43.9, so 43.9e-68 =4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 pi^2 is about 8*(9.8696) ≈78.9568. Multiply by I: 78.9568 *1.207e-46 ≈95.22e-46 =9.522e-45.

So B = 4.39e-67 / 9.522e-45 = approximately 4.61e-23 J.

Hmm, that's correct. So the rotational energy for J=0 to J=1 is 4.61e-23 J.

Photon's momentum p = E/c = 4.61e-23 / 3e8 = ~1.537e-31 kg m/s, which is 1.537e-31 Ns.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps my approach is wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the question is not about the rotational transition but about the vibrational transition. So if we calculate the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition.

Energy of the vibrational transition is E = h w. So that's 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

Momentum p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = ~8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, option D is 1.4e-28. So 8.8e-28 is closer to option A or D. But wait, let's compute more precisely.

Wait, w is 4e14 rad/s. So E_vib = h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p = E_vib / c = 2.6504e-19 / (3e8) = 8.834e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.8e-28 Ns. But the options don't have this value. The closest is option A (1.9e-28) and option D (1.4e-28). Hmm, so 8.8e-28 is about 6 times larger than option D, but perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem requires the molecule to make a transition that increases both vibrational and rotational states. But that would require more energy, so it's not the minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the rotation and vibration as separate, and the photon's energy must account for both. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe the question is considering the molecule in a certain state and the next allowed state, but I'm not entirely clear. Alternatively, perhaps the model being considered is the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator, where the energy levels are quantized in both rotation and vibration.

In such a model, the total energy is E = E_vibrational + E_rotational. So the fundamental state is the lowest vibrational and rotational states.

Now, when a photon is absorbed, the molecule can transition either to a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But which transition requires lower energy? 

As calculated earlier, the rotational transition (ΔE_rot ≈4.6e-23 J) is much lower than the vibrational (ΔE_vib≈2.65e-19 J). So the minimal energy transition is the rotational one.

But according to this, the photon's momentum should be around 1.5e-31 Ns, but the options are way higher. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the transition to the next state which is a combination of vibrational and rotational, but that would require more energy. Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is a certain vibration and rotation state, and the next state is the next possible in terms of energy, whether rotation or vibration.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the first excited state, which in the rotation-vibration model is the first state that is higher than the ground state. But what's the energy of the ground state?

In the rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator model, the ground state energy is E_ground = (3/2) h w_rot + (1/2) h w_vib. Wait, wait, no, that's not right. The rotational energy is E_rot = B J (J+1), and for J=0, E_rot =0. The vibrational energy is E_vib = (1/2) h w + ... Wait, no, for a harmonic oscillator, the ground state energy is (1/2) h w. So the total energy of the ground state would be (1/2) h w + 0 = (1/2) h w.

If the molecule is in the ground state, to transition to the next possible state, which is the lowest energy state higher than the ground state. The next state could be either the first rotational state (J=1) or the first vibrational state (v=1).

The energy of J=1 is E_rot = B*(1)(2) = 2 B. The energy of v=1 is E_vib = h w (1) [since from v=0 to v=1, ΔE = h w].

So which is smaller? Calculate 2B and compare with h w.

Earlier, B was found to be approximately 4.617e-23 J. So 2 B is ~9.23e-23 J.

h w = 6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

So 2B is much smaller than h w, so the next state with the lowest energy is the J=1 state. So the photon's energy is 2B.

Wait, so E_photon = 2 B = 9.23e-23 J.

Momentum p = E_photon / c = 9.23e-23 /3e8 = 3.077e-31 kg m/s = 3.08e-31 Ns.

But again, the options are way larger. Hmm. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, let me recheck the rotational energy. For J=0 to J=1, the change is ΔE_rot = B [J=1 (J+1=2) - J=0 (0)] = 2B.

Wait, yes, correct. So the photon's energy is 2B = 9.23e-23 J.

So p = 9.23e-23 /3e8 = ~3.08e-31 kg m/s.

But the options don't have this. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the initial state or the transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering a transition to the next vibrational state, which requires a photon of higher energy, corresponding to option A (1.9e-28).

But 1e-28 is 1e7 times larger than 1e-35, which is way beyond our earlier calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating B.

Wait, let me recalculate B.

B = h²/(8 π² I)

h = 6.626e-34 J s

I = μ r² = 3.018e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

Wait, (2e-10)^2 is 4e-20, so I = 3.018e-27 *4e-20 = 1.207e-46 kg m².

So B = (6.626e-34)^2 / (8 π² *1.207e-46 )

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 =43.9 →43.9e-68 =4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 π² =8*(9.8696)=78.957. 78.957 *1.207e-46 = approximately 78.957 *1.207 = 95.25e-46 →9.525e-45.

So B =4.39e-67 /9.525e-45 = ~4.61e-23 J.

So that's correct. So the energy for J=0→1 is 2B=9.22e-23 J.

So p=9.22e-23 /3e8 =3.07e-31 Ns.

Hmm, but the options are way larger. So perhaps I'm missing a factor, or the question is about something else.

Wait, maybe the question is considering the molecule in a state with both rotation and vibration. Alternatively, perhaps the model combines rotation and vibration such that the energy levels are a product of both. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs it to transition to the next state, which could be either a vibrational or rotational transition, but perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational transition.

Wait, but in that case, the energy is 2.65e-19 J, momentum p=8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options:

A) 1.9e-28 → approx 0.215 times 8.83e-28.

B)2.3e-27 → about 26 times higher.

C)1.1e-27 → about 12.4 times higher.

D)1.4e-28 → about 1.64 times lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute E_vib and p.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E_vib = h * w =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p = E_vib / c =2.6504e-19 /3e8 = 8.8346e-28 kg m/s →8.8346e-28 Ns.

So p ≈8.8e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is less than 8.8e-28. Option D is 1.4e-28, which is even smaller. So none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition, but the w given is 4e14 rad/s, and the angular frequency in the energy equation for rotation is different. Wait, but the rotational energy is determined by B, which is in terms of the moment of inertia.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the photon's momentum that would cause a transition to the next vibrational state, which would be E = h w. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition as the required next state because the rotational transitions are not allowed in this model.

Wait, sometimes in diatomic molecules, the rotational transitions are only allowed with a change in J by ±2, but that's in the rigid rotor model for pure rotational spectra. But in the case of a vibration-rotation transition, rotational changes of ±1 are allowed when combined with a vibrational change.

Hmm, perhaps the molecule is allowed to transition to a higher vibrational state along with a rotational change. But the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the minimal energy transition would be the vibrational one, but the rotational one requires less energy.

Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck because the calculated values don't match the options. Let me think about the possible mistake.

Wait, maybe I confused the moment of inertia formula. Wait, I used I = μ r². That's correct for a diatomic molecule. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the photon momentum for the vibrational transition, which is 8.8e-28 Ns. The closest option is option A (1.9e-28) is half of that. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the transition.

Wait, another possibility: in the quantum rotation-vibration model, the energy levels are quantized but the bond length is variable, so the moment of inertia can change. But I'm not sure how that affects the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is simplifying and treating the molecule as a harmonic oscillator, so the energy levels are E = (n + 1/2) h w, where n is the vibrational quantum number. So the fundamental state is n=0. The next state is n=1, so ΔE = h w.

In that case, the photon's energy is h w, and the momentum is E/c = h w /c.

So let me compute that:

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

E_photon =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p= E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 Ns.

Again, the same result. But the options don't have this. So maybe the question is about a transition to the next rotational state, but perhaps the initial state is not J=0, but another state.

Wait, the problem states the molecule is in the "fundamental state", which is the lowest vibrational and rotational states. So for rotation, J=0. So the transition is to J=1, which is the next state.

But again, that calculation leads to p of about 1.5e-31 Ns, which isn't in the options.

Hmm, perhaps the question is considering the molecule as a harmonic oscillator, but not the rotational part. So the photon's energy is just h w, and the momentum is E/c.

Wait, but that gives me approximately 8.8e-28 Ns, which isn't exactly any of the options. Wait, looking at option A: 1.9e-28. 8.8e-28 is about 4.63 times larger than option B (2.3e-27 is way bigger). Hmm, not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the calculation of the moment of inertia. Let me double-check the reduced mass.

Masses are Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu. So μ = (20*2)/(20+2) =40/22 = 1.818 amu.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the bond length is given in angstroms, but I treated it as meters. Wait, no, 1 angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I should express the bond length in meters correctly. 2 angstroms is 0.2 nanometers, which is 2e-10 meters.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the rotational energy calculation. Let me recheck.

The rotational energy levels are E_rot = B J (J+1), where B = h²/(8 π² I). So when J increases by 1, the energy increases by B*(2J +1).

So from J=0 to J=1, ΔE_rot = B*(1)(2) = 2B.

Wait, yes. So that's correct.

Wait another thought: perhaps the question is considering the photon's energy to be the sum of the vibrational and rotational transitions. That would give a higher energy, but that would require a larger photon, which isn't the minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition to the next state that includes both a vibrational and rotational change, but that would be more energy than either alone.

Wait, perhaps the model is such that the molecule can't change its vibrational state without also changing its rotational state. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the molecule in the ground state of rotation but the first vibrational state. But the question says it's in the fundamental state, which I think implies the lowest energy state for both.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck because my calculations don't align with the given options. Let me think about the options again. The options are all around 1e-27 to 1e-28 Ns.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rotational transition's momentum again.

Earlier calculation: E_rot = 4.617e-23 J.

p = E_rot / c = 4.617e-23 /3e8 = 1.539e-31 kg m/s →1.539e-31 Ns.

But the options are higher by about 1e6 to 1e7 times. So perhaps I missed a factor of 1e6 or something. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Another approach is to compute the photon's momentum using the angular frequency. Because p = h bar * k, where k is the wave number. And since E = h w, and p = E/c, but also p = h bar *k, where k = w/c.

Wait, h bar is h/(2 pi). So p = (h/(2 pi)) * (w/c) ) → p = h w/(2 pi c).

Let me compute that.

h=6.626e-34 J s.

w=4e14 rad/s.

c=3e8 m/s.

So p = (6.626e-34 *4e14) / (2 pi *3e8).

Compute numerator:6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J s.

Denominator: 2 pi *3e8 ≈6.283 *3e8 =1.885e9.

So p=2.6504e-19 /1.885e9 ≈1.407e-28 kg m/s →1.407e-28 Ns.

Wait, that's approximately option D, which is 1.4e-28.

Wait, but this is for the photon's momentum when E = h w, which is the vibrational transition. So why did I get this approach? Because I used p = h w/(2 pi c) → which simplifies to E/(c) because E = h w = pc, so p= E/(c). So wait, this method gives the same result as before. Hmm.

Wait, but according to this, the momentum is 1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

Wait, earlier I thought that the vibrational transition requires a photon of momentum 8.8e-28 Ns, but this new approach gives 1.4e-28. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute p = (h w) / (2 pi c).

h=6.626e-34, w=4e14.

h w =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.6504e-19 J.

2 pi c = 2 *3.1416 *3e8 ≈1.885e9 m/s.

So p = 2.6504e-19 / 1.885e9 = approximately 1.407e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 1.4e-28 Ns.

So that's option D.

Wait, so perhaps that's the correct approach. But why did I get a different value earlier?

Ah, because I think I confused the formula. When dealing with momentum, p = h bar * k, where k is the wave number. The wave number k is w/c. So p = h bar * (w/c).

h bar = h/(2 pi). So p = (h/(2 pi)) * (w/c) = h w/(2 pi c).

Yes, which gives us 1.4e-28 Ns, matching option D.

But wait, earlier I thought that the rotational transition is much lower in energy. So why are we considering the vibrational transition?

Ah, perhaps the question is considering that the molecule transitions to the next state, which is a vibrational transition. But why would that be the case if the rotational transition requires less energy?

Wait, perhaps the model being used in the question doesn't allow for pure rotational transitions, only vibration-rotation transitions. Or perhaps the question is considering that the molecule is in the ground vibrational state but the ground rotational state, and the next state is the first vibrational state.

But I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the photon's momentum to cause a transition to the next state, which would be the first excited vibrational state, which requires a photon of higher energy.

But why is the calculated value using the vibrational transition matching option D?

Wait, the question says "switch to the next state with the lowest possible energy." So perhaps the next state is the first vibrational state (v=1), which requires a photon of momentum 1.4e-28 Ns.

But why is the rotational transition's momentum not matching any options?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the rotational transition's calculation. Let me re-express the rotational transition's photon momentum.

The rotational energy change is ΔE_rot = 2B, which is about 9.23e-23 J.

So p_rot = ΔE_rot / c =9.23e-23 /3e8 =3.077e-31 kg m/s →3.077e-31 Ns.

This is much smaller than the options. So perhaps the question is considering the vibrational transition, which gives p ≈1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.

But why? Because the rotational transition requires less energy, so the minimal would be the rotational.

But the options don't have the rotational's value. So perhaps the question is considering the photon's momentum for the vibrational transition.

Therefore, the correct answer would be option D: 1.4e-28 Ns.

But wait, in the calculation using the vibrational transition, p =1.4e-28 Ns, which is option D.


To determine the momentum of the photon required for the diatomic molecule to transition to the next state with the lowest possible energy, we analyze the problem using the quantum rotation-vibration model. The molecule is initially in the fundamental state, which corresponds to the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The goal is to calculate the photon's momentum needed for the molecule to transition to the next state with the smallest energy increment.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Transitions**:
   - The molecule can transition to either a higher vibrational state (v=1) or a higher rotational state (J=1). The energy required for these transitions is:
     - **Vibrational transition**: \( \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega \), where \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \).
     - **Rotational transition**: \( \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B \), where \( B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I} \) is the rotational constant, and \( I = \mu r^2 \) is the moment of inertia.

2. **Moment of Inertia**:
   - The reduced mass \( \mu \) is calculated as:
     \[
     \mu = \frac{M_x M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \, \text{amu} \times 2 \, \text{amu}}{20 \, \text{amu} + 2 \, \text{amu}} = 1.818 \, \text{amu}.
     \]
     Converting to kilograms (\( 1 \, \text{amu} \approx 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \)):
     \[
     \mu \approx 1.818 \times 1.66 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.018 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}.
     \]
   - The bond length \( r = 2 \, \text{Å} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \). Thus, the moment of inertia is:
     \[
     I = \mu r^2 = (3.018 \times 10^{-27}) \times (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \, \text{m}^2.
     \]

3. **Rotational Constant**:
   - The rotational constant \( B \) is:
     \[
     B = \frac{h^2}{8 \pi^2 I}.
     \]
     Substituting \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \, \text{s} \) and \( I = 1.207 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg} \, \text{m}^2 \):
     \[
     B = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2}{8 \pi^2 (1.207 \times 10^{-46})} \approx 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - The energy required for the rotational transition (J=0 to J=1) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = 2B = 2 \times 4.61 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J} \approx 9.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}.
     \]

4. **Photon Momentum for Rotational Transition**:
   - The momentum of the photon is related to its energy by \( p = \frac{E}{c} \), where \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \). For the rotational transition:
     \[
     p_{\text{rot}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.22 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.07 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}.
     \]
     This value is much smaller than any of the given options, suggesting the rotational transition is not the intended focus.

5. **Photon Momentum for Vibrational Transition**:
   - The energy required for the vibrational transition (v=0 to v=1) is:
     \[
     \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \omega = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (4 \times 10^{14}) \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
     \]
   - The momentum of the photon for this transition is:
     \[
     p_{\text{vib}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
     \]
     This value is also not directly listed among the options.

6. **Revisiting the Vibrational Transition**:
   - Using the formula \( p = \frac{h \omega}{2 \pi c} \), where \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \), \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J} \, \text{s} \), and \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \):
     \[
     p = \frac{h \omega}{2 \pi c} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (4 \times 10^{14})}{2 \pi \times 3 \times 10^8}.
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     p \approx \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{1.885 \times 10^9} \approx 1.41 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}.
     \]
     This matches option **D**.

### Conclusion:
The question likely focuses on the vibrational transition, as the rotational transition's momentum does not align with the given options. The photon's momentum required for the vibrational transition is approximately \( 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \), corresponding to option **D**.
