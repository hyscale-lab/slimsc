Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = (1/2)mω² r². I remember that this is similar to the 3D version of the quantum harmonic oscillator, which is a standard problem in QM.

The question has two parts: first, finding the energy of the third excited state, and second, determining how many linearly independent eigenfunctions correspond to that energy eigenvalue.

I think the first part is about energy levels. For a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator, the energy levels are quantized and depend on the quantum numbers in each dimension. Wait, right! The energy levels are given by E = ħω(n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2), but since it's isotropic, all three dimensions have the same frequency. Or wait, another way I remember is that the energy can be written as E = (n + 3/2) ħω, where n is the sum of the quantum numbers in the three directions. Wait, no, actually, I think it's n = n_x + n_y + n_z. So E = (n + 3/2) ħω.

So each state is characterized by quantum numbers n_x, n_y, n_z, which are non-negative integers. The ground state would be (0,0,0), so n=0. The first excited state would have n=1, the second n=2, third n=3, etc.

Wait, wait, no. Because the question is the third excited state. Wait, the ground state is the lowest, so the first excited is the next, then second, then third. So the third excited state would be n=3? Or wait, no, because if n=0 is ground, then n=1 is first excited, n=2 is second excited, n=3 is third excited. Hmm, that seems right.

So the energy would then be (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. Oh, wait, because E = (n + 3/2) ħω. So yes, n=3 gives E=(3 + 3/2) ħω = 9/2 ħω. That's the first part.

Now, the second part is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy. In other words, the degeneracy: how many different states have the same energy E.

So for a given n, the degeneracy is the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers (n_x, n_y, n_z). So the number of distinct triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) such that n_x + n_y + n_z = n. This is a combinatorial problem.

The formula for the degeneracy (number of states) when the sum is n is (n + 2) choose 2, or (n + 2)(n + 1)/2. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, for n=0: only (0,0,0), so 1 state. With the formula, (0 + 2)(0 +1)/2= 2*1/2=1. Correct.

n=1: possible triplets are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). So 3 states. The formula gives (1+2)(1+1)/2= 3*2/2=3. Correct.

n=2: triplets include (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), and (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). Total of 6 states. The formula: (2+2)(2+1)/2=4*3/2=6. Yep, correct.

n=3: So (3+2)(3+1)/2 =5*4/2=10. So 10 states. So the degeneracy is 10.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, option A says energy (9/2) ħω, and 10 eigenfunctions. So that's the first part and second part matching.

Wait the options: option A is (9/2) ħω, 10; this matches both parts. So that should be the correct option.

Wait, but let me cross-check the other options just to be sure.

Option B: energy is (11 pi^2 ħ^2)/(2 m r^2), which doesn't look like the harmonic oscillator energy form. Because harmonic oscillator energies depend on n and ω, not on r. So B's energy is probably incorrect.

Option C: same energy as A, but only 3 functions. That would be if it's non-degenerate, but for n=3, the degeneracy is 10, so C is wrong.

Option D: energy same as B, and 3 functions, so also wrong.

So the correct answer should be option A.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are given by \( E = (n + \frac{3}{2}) \hbar \omega \), where \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \) is the sum of the quantum numbers in the three spatial dimensions. The degeneracy of each energy level corresponds to the number of distinct ways to write \( n \) as the sum of three non-negative integers \( (n_x, n_y, n_z) \), which is given by the combinatorial formula \( \frac{(n + 2)(n + 1)}{2} \).

### Part 1: Energy of the Third Excited State
The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), the second excited state to \( n = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( n = 3 \). Substituting \( n = 3 \) into the energy formula:
\[
E = (3 + \frac{3}{2}) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega.
\]

### Part 2: Degeneracy of the Third Excited State
For \( n = 3 \), the degeneracy is calculated using the formula \( \frac{(n + 2)(n + 1)}{2} \):
\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(3 + 2)(3 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10.
\]

### Analysis of Options
- **Option A**: \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega, 10 \) matches both the energy and the degeneracy, so it is correct.
- **Option B**: The energy \( \frac{11 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m r^2} \) does not match the harmonic oscillator energy form and is incorrect.
- **Option C**: The energy \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \) is correct, but the degeneracy \( 3 \) is incorrect for \( n = 3 \).
- **Option D**: The energy \( \frac{11 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2 m r^2} \) is incorrect, and the degeneracy \( 3 \) is also incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**.

Now, the second part is about the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions for this energy. In other words, the degeneracy: how many different states have the same energy E.

So for a given n, the degeneracy is the number of ways to write n as the sum of three non-negative integers (n_x, n_y, n_z). So the number of distinct triplets (n_x, n_y, n_z) such that n_x + n_y + n_z = n. This is a combinatorial problem.

n=1: possible triplets are (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1). So 3 states. The formula gives (1+2)(1+1)/2= 3*2/2=3. Correct.

n=2: triplets include (2,0,0), (0,2,0), (0,0,2), and (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1). Total of 6 states. The formula: (2+2)(2+1)/2=4*3/2=6. Yep, correct.

n=3: So (3+2)(3+1)/2 =5*4/2=10. So 10 states. So the degeneracy is 10.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, option A says energy (9/2) ħω, and 10 eigenfunctions. So that's the first part and second part matching.

Wait the options: option A is (9/2) ħω, 10; this matches both parts. So that should be the correct option.

Wait, but let me cross-check the other options just to be sure.

Option B: energy is (11 pi^2 ħ^2)/(2 m r^2), which doesn't look like the harmonic oscillator energy form. Because harmonic oscillator energies depend on n and ω, not on r. So B's energy is probably incorrect.

Option C: same energy as A, but only 3 functions. That would be if it's non-degenerate, but for n=3, the degeneracy is 10, so C is wrong.

Option D: energy same as B, and 3 functions, so also wrong.

So the correct answer should be option A.
