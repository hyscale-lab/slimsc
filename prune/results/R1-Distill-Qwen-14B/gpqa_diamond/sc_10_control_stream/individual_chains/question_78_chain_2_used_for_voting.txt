Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in the electromagnetic field due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a given point r and time t, where t is greater than tr, the time when the charge was at a certain position. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different expressions for V and A.

First, I remember that the scalar potential is usually associated with the electric field, and the vector potential with the magnetic field. The potentials are part of Maxwell's equations and are used in the Lorenz gauge or Coulomb gauge, etc.

Wait, but for a moving charge, I think things get a bit more complicated than the static case. The static case, like when the charge isn't moving, the scalar potential is simply V = q/(4πε₀ r), right? But here, the charge is moving, so there should be more to it.

I recall that when a charge is moving, you have to consider the retarded time. The scalar potential isn't just 1/r anymore because the charge's position is changing. Oh wait, but the problem mentions d is the vector from the field generation point to r. So d would be the vector from where the charge was at time tr to the observation point r.

Wait, the setup says that d is the vector from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to r. So the distance between those two points is |d|.

So the charge was at position s(tr) at time tr, and r is the current observation point. So the vector d is r - s(tr). Hmm, but in terms of potentials, I think the scalar potential might involve some terms related to the velocity of the charge as well.

Wait, no, in the static case (charge not moving), V is q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance between the charge and the point r. But when the charge is moving, the potentials depend on the position and velocity at the retarded time.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about how the potentials are derived for a moving charge. The scalar potential V is given by the retarded potential formula. Similarly, the vector potential A is also based on the retarded charge's velocity.

Wait, in the case of a charge moving with velocity v at time tr, the scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(d c - v·d)), where d is the distance from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the expressions for potentials when considering retarded time.

The scalar potential V(r, t) for a moving charge is given by (q/(4πε₀ c)) * [ (d)/(d²) ] evaluated at t - r/c. Wait, that's a bit vague. Alternatively, the general expression for the scalar potential when you have a charge moving is V = (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/( r' - (v/c)(t - t') ), but maybe that's not exactly right.

Wait, another approach: the potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations. In the Lorenz gauge, the potentials satisfy certain wave equations. But maybe for a point charge, it's easier to use the Liénard potentials.

Ah, right, the Liénard potentials. The scalar potential for a charge moving with velocity v is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( r' - (v/c) (t - t') ) ]

Where r' is the position of the charge at time t', and t' is such that the light travel time from r' to r is (t - t'), so t' = t - |r - r'| / c.

Wait, but in terms of vectors, perhaps d is the vector from the charge's position at t' to the observation point r, so d = r - r'(t'). Then, the scalar potential would be something like V = q/(4πε₀ (d c - v · d)) ) * c or something similar.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options. Let's look at the options and see which makes sense.

Option C: V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d · v)), and A = (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - d · v)).

Option D: V is similar but denominator is (d c + d · v), and A has μ instead of μ₀ and a similar denominator.

Wait, I remember that the potentials for a moving charge involve terms where the denominator is c times the distance minus the projection of velocity times time. Because when the charge is moving, the current position isn't just the distance—it's adjusted by the velocity.

Wait, the expression for the scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/( (d c - (v · d)) ), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form.

Alternatively, I think the denominator might be (d c - v · d), which is the same as d(c) - v⋅d. Wait, but d is a vector, so it's a scalar product. So the denominator would be (d c - (v · d)), but that doesn't make much sense dimensionally because c is a speed, d is a distance, so (d c) is a distance multiplied by a speed, which is meters squared per second? Hmm, not sure. Wait, maybe I should think of it as (d c) - (v · (d / c)) * c², which would give units of (length) * (speed) minus (speed) * (length) * (speed), which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the expressions for the potentials. The scalar potential is V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r - (v/c)(t - t_r))], where t_r is the retarded time. But in vector terms, r is the vector from the origin to the observation point, and r' is the position of the charge at time t_r.

Alternatively, another approach: The potentials can be written as:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(d c - v · d)] * (1/c²) ?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think about the exact expressions.

In the case of a charge moving with velocity v at the retarded time, the scalar potential V is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(d c - v · d)) ) * c ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the vector potential A. The vector potential is usually proportional to the current, but in this case, the current due to a moving charge is the charge times its velocity. So maybe the vector potential would involve terms proportional to v multiplied by the scalar potential.

Looking at the options, option C says A = (μ₀ q c v) / (4π (d c - (v · d))) ), which seems plausible because μ₀ is involved in magnetic terms.

Wait, but the expression for the vector potential is typically (μ₀/(4π)) * (something involving the current). The current for a moving charge is J = ρ v, but in this case, maybe it's simpler.

Alternatively, the vector potential can be written as A = (μ₀/(4π c²)) * (q v) / (something), so looking at the options, perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, let me think about the units to see which option makes sense.

The scalar potential V has units of volts, which is joules per coulomb. So, [V] = [q]/([ε₀][distance]).

Looking at option C:

V = (q c) / (4π ε₀ (d c - (v · d)) )

The denominator is (d c - v · d). Let me think about the units of each term. d is a distance, so [d] = meters. c is m/s, so [d c] = m²/s. The term v · d is (m/s) * m = m²/s. So the denominator has units m²/s. The numerator is q c, with [q] in coulombs, c in m/s. So [q c] = C·m/s.

Putting it together, V has units (C·m/s) / (m²/s) ) = (C) / m. Which matches the expected [V] = J/C = (N·m)/C = (kg·m²/s²)/C = C/(m) because N is kg·m/s². Wait, no, wait. Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so J/C is kg·m²/(s² C). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, 1 volt is 1 J/C, so 1 (J/C) is kg·m²/(s²·C). Let's see option C: numerator is q c (C·m/s), denominator is (m²/s) → so (C·m/s) / (m²/s) ) = C/(m). So V has units C/m. But 1 V is 1 J/C = (kg·m²/s²)/C, which isn't the same as C/m. So perhaps the units don't match, which would mean option C is incorrect.

Hmm, that's confusing. Let me check option B.

Option B: V = q/(4π ε₀ r), A = (v/c²) V. So V is the static case, and A is a term proportional to velocity over c squared times V.

But wait, in the static case (v=0), A would be zero, which makes sense because a stationary charge doesn't produce a magnetic field. So for a moving charge, the scalar potential is still V = q/(4π ε₀ r), and the vector potential would have a term involving v.

Wait, but isn't this only true when the charge isn't moving, or when the motion is such that the retarded time isn't considered? Because the options B has V as the static case, but the problem states that the charge is moving, so perhaps the correct potentials include the effects of motion, which would involve the vector d and velocity v.

So maybe options C and D are the ones to consider for moving charges.

Wait, another thought: The scalar potential for a moving charge is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(d - (v/c) (t - t_r)) )

But wait, d would be the vector from the charge's position at t_r to r. So the denominator becomes d - (v/c) (t - t_r). Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, let's think about the expression in terms of the vector d. The distance between the charge's position at t_r and r is |d|, and if the charge is moving at velocity v, then the light travel time is t - t_r = |d| / c. So the denominator in the potentials would involve terms like d c - v · d, but I'm not certain.

Looking again at option C: The denominator is (d c - (v · d)). Wait, but d is a vector, so (d c) would be a vector multiplied by c, which is a scalar, so that's fine. But then (v · d) is a scalar. So the denominator becomes a vector multiplied by c minus a scalar? That doesn't make sense because you can't subtract a scalar from a vector.

Ah, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. The denominator in option C is (d c - (v · d)), but that would be a vector (d c) minus a scalar (v · d), which isn't possible. So that must be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps it's (d × v), but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (v · d)) times something. Alternatively, perhaps it's (dc - v·d) as a scalar. Wait, but if d is a vector, how can you have dc? Oh, wait, perhaps d is a scalar, the distance. Oh, maybe the problem defines d as the distance, not the vector. So perhaps in the equation, d is the magnitude of the vector from where the charge was to r. So |d| = |r - s(tr)|.

But in that case, the denominator in option C is (d c - (v · d)), which would have units of (m * m/s) - (m/s * m) )= m²/s - m²/s = 0? That can't be right. So perhaps that's a typo.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (v · r)) or something else. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the expressions for the potentials when the charge is moving. The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r' - (v/c) (t - t'))], where t' is the retarded time. So r' is the position of the charge at t', and the denominator is the distance from the charge's position at t' to the observation point r, adjusted by the velocity.

Wait, but in terms of d, which is the vector from the charge's position at t' to r, then d = r - r'(t'). So the denominator becomes d - (v/c) (t - t'), but since (t - t') = |d| / c, because the light takes time |d|/c to reach r, then the denominator is d - (v/c)(|d|/c) = d (1 - (v · d)/(c² |d|) )).

Hmm, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator simplifies to (d c² - (v · d)) / c.

Wait, let me think about the denominator: d - (v/c) (t - t') = d - (v/c) (|d|/c) ) = d - (v · d)/c² * (c) ?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up terms. Let me try to write this correctly.

The denominator is d - (v/c) (t - t'), and t - t' is |d| / c. So substituting, we get:

d - (v/c) * (|d| / c) ) = d - (v |d| ) / (c²) ).

But this would be a vector expression. So the denominator is d - (v |d| )/( c² ), and the scalar potential would be (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/(d - (v |d| )/(c²) ) ].

But none of the options look like this. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is d (c) - (v · d ), but I'm not sure. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option C, the denominator is (d c - (v · d)), which would have units of (m * m/s) - (m/s * m) ) = m²/s - m²/s = 0, which can't be correct. So perhaps option C is not correctly written, or maybe I'm misunderstanding the way d is being used.

Wait, perhaps d is a scalar, the distance between the charge's position at t' and the observation point r. So d = |r - r'(t')|. Then, in that case, the denominator would be d c - (v · d), but that still doesn't make sense because v · d is v multiplied by the projection of d on v's direction, which is a length. So d c is (m) * (m/s) = m²/s. v · d is (m/s) * (m) = m²/s. So the denominator would be (d c - (v · d)) = m²/s - m²/s = 0. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the denominator in option C is written incorrectly, and the correct denominator is (d c - v · (d)). But I'm not sure.

Wait, considering that the vector potential for a point charge moving with velocity v is given by:

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4π c² d) ) where d is the distance from the charge's position at t' to r.

Wait, but that's for static fields. Wait, but when the charge is moving, the vector potential would involve terms of v and the distance d.

Option C's vector potential is (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (d c - (v · d)) ), which seems to have the correct μ₀ and dependence on v.

But I'm not sure if the denominator is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator isn't (d c - (v · d)), but just (d c - (v · d)) is a scalar, but that doesn't make sense if d is a vector.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what each option suggests.

Option A: V is the static case, and A is v squared over c squared times V. But that doesn't seem right because A should be proportional to velocity v, not v squared.

Option B: V is static, A is v/c² * V. That could make sense if the charge is moving, but I'm not sure if that's accurate because when the charge is moving, the potentials should account for the motion more intricately.

Option C: V is (q c) / (4πε₀ (d c - (v · d)) ), and A is (μ₀ q c v) / (4π (d c - (v · d)) ). Hmm, the denominator in V has units of (m * m/s - m²/s) ), which as I thought earlier, gives zero? That can't be correct, so perhaps option C is incorrect.

Option D: V is (q c) / (4πε₀ (d c + (v · d)) ), and A is (μ q c v) / (4π (d c + (v · d)) ). Again, same issue with units.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (d c + v · (d unit vector)) )? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the denominator is (d c + v · d), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The scalar potential for a moving charge in the Lorenz gauge is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/(d - (v/c)(t - t_r)) ]

With d being the distance from the charge's position at t_r to r.

But since t - t_r = |d| / c, the denominator becomes d - (v/c)( |d| / c ) = d - (v |d| )/(c² )

Which is a bit messy. But perhaps the correct expression for V is option C or D, depending on the sign.

Wait, but none of the options seem to match that expression. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think about the vector potential. The vector potential due to a moving charge would be proportional to the charge's velocity. So the vector potential should be A = (something) * v.

Looking at the options, options B, C, D have A proportional to v. Option A has A proportional to v squared, which is unlikely.

So, let's eliminate option A.

Now, between the others, options B, C, D.

Option B: V is static, A is v/c² * V. But if the charge is moving, the scalar potential shouldn't be static anymore because the charge's position is changing, so perhaps option B is wrong.

So it's probably between options C and D.

Now, thinking about the denominator in the scalar potential. The scalar potential involves 1/(d c - v · d), but only if the terms are scalar. But wait, if d is a vector, then how can you multiply it by c and subtract the dot product v · d?

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (v · d)) as a scalar, but that would require d to be a scalar, which it's not. So perhaps the denominator should be (d c - (v · d)) is not correct. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the denominator in option C is written as (d c - v · d), but if d is the vector from the charge's position at t_r to r, then (d c) is a vector multiplied by c, and (v · d) is a scalar. So subtracting a scalar from a vector doesn't make sense, which suggests that the option is written incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake and the denominator is (d c - (v · d)), treating d as a scalar, the magnitude. So perhaps d is the distance, not the vector.

If d is the distance (a scalar), then the denominator (d c - (v · d)) is a scalar, but since v · d is (v)(d cosθ), where θ is the angle between v and d. So (d c - v d cosθ) would be the denominator.

So, in that case, the denominator is (d (c - v cosθ)). So option C's denominator would be d(c) - v·d = d c - (v · d) which, if d is a scalar, would be d (c - v·d/d ), since v·d = v d cosθ, so d (c - v (cosθ)).

So the denominator would be d (c - v cosθ), which makes sense dimensionally. So if that's the case, V would be (q c) / (4π ε₀ d (c - v cosθ) ), which is option C.

Similarly, the vector potential would be (μ₀ q c v )/(4π d (c - v cosθ) ), which matches option C.

Wait, but wait, in the denominator, option C has (d c - v · d), but if d is a scalar, that's d c - v·d = d (c - (v · d)/d ), which is d (c - v cosθ), as earlier.

So then, the denominator is d (c - v cosθ), leading to V = (q c)/(4π ε₀ d (c - v cosθ) ), and A as (μ₀ q c v)/(4π d (c - v cosθ) ).

So option C would be correct.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the scalar potential for a moving charge includes a term like 1/(d - (v/c)(t - t_r)), but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the vector potential.

The vector potential due to a point charge moving with velocity v is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * [ 1 / (d - (v/c)(t - t_r)) ]

Which, using t - t_r = |d| / c, the denominator becomes d - (v |d| )/(c² ) = |d| (1 - (v cosθ)/c ), where θ is the angle between v and d.

So, A would be (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v cosθ)/c )) ) ].

Which can be rewritten as (μ₀ q v )/(4π c²) * 1/(d (c - v cosθ)/c) ) = (μ₀ q v c )/(4π c² d (c - v cosθ) ) ) = (μ₀ q v )/(4π c d (c − v cosθ) )

Wait, but option C's A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - v · d)) ), which, if d is a scalar, becomes (μ₀ q c v)/(4π d (c - (v d cosθ)/d )) ) = (μ₀ q c v )/(4π d (c - v cosθ) ), which matches what I got earlier.

So that suggests option C is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought the denominator in V should involve a term like (d c - v · d), but if d is a scalar (distance), then (d c - v · d) would be d c - v d cosθ, which is d (c - v cosθ), and that's correct.

So option C's V is (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c - v·d)), which is (q c)/(4π ε₀ d (c - v cosθ) ), which matches the expression we derived.

So putting it all together, option C seems to be the correct choice.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving point charge \( q \), we analyze the situation where the charge is moving with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \). The vector \( \vec{d} \) represents the displacement from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \), and \( d = |\vec{d}| \) is the distance between these two points.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - For a moving charge, the scalar potential depends on the retarded time \( t_r \), where \( t > t_r \). The general expression for \( V \) involves the distance \( d \) and the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge.
   - The denominator in \( V \) must account for the motion of the charge, typically involving a term like \( d c - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light. This ensures dimensional consistency and correctly incorporates the effects of the charge's motion.
   - Option C provides \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{q c}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 (d c - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d})} \), which matches the expected form for the scalar potential.

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is proportional to the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge and is typically scaled by the permeability \( \mu_0 \) and the same denominator as in \( V \).
   - Option C provides \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4 \pi (d c - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d})} \), which aligns with the expected dependence on \( \vec{v} \) and the motion of the charge.

3. **Elimination of Other Options:**
   - **Option A:** The vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}^2 \), which is incorrect because \( \vec{A} \) should depend linearly on \( \vec{v} \).
   - **Option B:** While \( V \) is correct for a static charge, it does not account for the motion of the charge, making it unsuitable for this scenario.
   - **Option D:** The denominator in both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) includes a \( + \) sign, which is inconsistent with the correct form \( d c - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} \).

### Conclusion:
Option C correctly incorporates the effects of the moving charge, with both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) depending on the distance \( d \), the velocity \( \vec{v} \), and the speed of light \( c \). The denominator \( d c - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} \) ensures dimensional consistency and accurately reflects the retarded potential formulation.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the potentials in the electromagnetic field due to a moving point charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking for the scalar potential V and the vector potential A at a given point r and time t, where t is greater than tr, the time when the charge was at a certain position. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving different expressions for V and A.

First, I remember that the scalar potential is usually associated with the electric field, and the vector potential with the magnetic field. The potentials are part of Maxwell's equations and are used in the Lorenz gauge or Coulomb gauge, etc.

Wait, but for a moving charge, I think things get a bit more complicated than the static case. The static case, like when the charge isn't moving, the scalar potential is simply V = q/(4πε₀ r), right? But here, the charge is moving, so there should be more to it.

I recall that when a charge is moving, you have to consider the retarded time. The scalar potential isn't just 1/r anymore because the charge's position is changing. Oh wait, but the problem mentions d is the vector from the field generation point to r. So d would be the vector from where the charge was at time tr to the observation point r.

Wait, the setup says that d is the vector from the point where the field was generated (at time tr) to r. So the distance between those two points is |d|.

So the charge was at position s(tr) at time tr, and r is the current observation point. So the vector d is r - s(tr). Hmm, but in terms of potentials, I think the scalar potential might involve some terms related to the velocity of the charge as well.

Wait, no, in the static case (charge not moving), V is q/(4πε₀ r), where r is the distance between the charge and the point r. But when the charge is moving, the potentials depend on the position and velocity at the retarded time.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about how the potentials are derived for a moving charge. The scalar potential V is given by the retarded potential formula. Similarly, the vector potential A is also based on the retarded charge's velocity.

Wait, in the case of a charge moving with velocity v at time tr, the scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(d c - v·d)), where d is the distance from the charge's position at tr to the observation point r. Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the expressions for potentials when considering retarded time.

The scalar potential V(r, t) for a moving charge is given by (q/(4πε₀ c)) * [ (d)/(d²) ] evaluated at t - r/c. Wait, that's a bit vague. Alternatively, the general expression for the scalar potential when you have a charge moving is V = (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/( r' - (v/c)(t - t') ), but maybe that's not exactly right.

Wait, another approach: the potentials are solutions to Maxwell's equations. In the Lorenz gauge, the potentials satisfy certain wave equations. But maybe for a point charge, it's easier to use the Liénard potentials.

Ah, right, the Liénard potentials. The scalar potential for a charge moving with velocity v is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( r' - (v/c) (t - t') ) ]

Where r' is the position of the charge at time t', and t' is such that the light travel time from r' to r is (t - t'), so t' = t - |r - r'| / c.

Wait, but in terms of vectors, perhaps d is the vector from the charge's position at t' to the observation point r, so d = r - r'(t'). Then, the scalar potential would be something like V = q/(4πε₀ (d c - v · d)) ) * c or something similar.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options. Let's look at the options and see which makes sense.

Option C: V = (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d · v)), and A = (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - d · v)).

Option D: V is similar but denominator is (d c + d · v), and A has μ instead of μ₀ and a similar denominator.

Wait, I remember that the potentials for a moving charge involve terms where the denominator is c times the distance minus the projection of velocity times time. Because when the charge is moving, the current position isn't just the distance—it's adjusted by the velocity.

Wait, the expression for the scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/( (d c - (v · d)) ), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact form.

Alternatively, I think the denominator might be (d c - v · d), which is the same as d(c) - v⋅d. Wait, but d is a vector, so it's a scalar product. So the denominator would be (d c - (v · d)), but that doesn't make much sense dimensionally because c is a speed, d is a distance, so (d c) is a distance multiplied by a speed, which is meters squared per second? Hmm, not sure. Wait, maybe I should think of it as (d c) - (v · (d / c)) * c², which would give units of (length) * (speed) minus (speed) * (length) * (speed), which doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the expressions for the potentials. The scalar potential is V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r - (v/c)(t - t_r))], where t_r is the retarded time. But in vector terms, r is the vector from the origin to the observation point, and r' is the position of the charge at time t_r.

Alternatively, another approach: The potentials can be written as:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(d c - v · d)] * (1/c²) ?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think about the exact expressions.

In the case of a charge moving with velocity v at the retarded time, the scalar potential V is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(d c - v · d)) ) * c ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the vector potential A. The vector potential is usually proportional to the current, but in this case, the current due to a moving charge is the charge times its velocity. So maybe the vector potential would involve terms proportional to v multiplied by the scalar potential.

Looking at the options, option C says A = (μ₀ q c v) / (4π (d c - (v · d))) ), which seems plausible because μ₀ is involved in magnetic terms.

Wait, but the expression for the vector potential is typically (μ₀/(4π)) * (something involving the current). The current for a moving charge is J = ρ v, but in this case, maybe it's simpler.

Alternatively, the vector potential can be written as A = (μ₀/(4π c²)) * (q v) / (something), so looking at the options, perhaps option C is correct.

Wait, let me think about the units to see which option makes sense.

The scalar potential V has units of volts, which is joules per coulomb. So, [V] = [q]/([ε₀][distance]).

Looking at option C:

V = (q c) / (4π ε₀ (d c - (v · d)) )

The denominator is (d c - v · d). Let me think about the units of each term. d is a distance, so [d] = meters. c is m/s, so [d c] = m²/s. The term v · d is (m/s) * m = m²/s. So the denominator has units m²/s. The numerator is q c, with [q] in coulombs, c in m/s. So [q c] = C·m/s.

Putting it together, V has units (C·m/s) / (m²/s) ) = (C) / m. Which matches the expected [V] = J/C = (N·m)/C = (kg·m²/s²)/C = C/(m) because N is kg·m/s². Wait, no, wait. Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so J/C is kg·m²/(s² C). Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused. Alternatively, 1 volt is 1 J/C, so 1 (J/C) is kg·m²/(s²·C). Let's see option C: numerator is q c (C·m/s), denominator is (m²/s) → so (C·m/s) / (m²/s) ) = C/(m). So V has units C/m. But 1 V is 1 J/C = (kg·m²/s²)/C, which isn't the same as C/m. So perhaps the units don't match, which would mean option C is incorrect.

Hmm, that's confusing. Let me check option B.

Option B: V = q/(4π ε₀ r), A = (v/c²) V. So V is the static case, and A is a term proportional to velocity over c squared times V.

But wait, in the static case (v=0), A would be zero, which makes sense because a stationary charge doesn't produce a magnetic field. So for a moving charge, the scalar potential is still V = q/(4π ε₀ r), and the vector potential would have a term involving v.

Wait, but isn't this only true when the charge isn't moving, or when the motion is such that the retarded time isn't considered? Because the options B has V as the static case, but the problem states that the charge is moving, so perhaps the correct potentials include the effects of motion, which would involve the vector d and velocity v.

So maybe options C and D are the ones to consider for moving charges.

Wait, another thought: The scalar potential for a moving charge is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * (1/(d - (v/c) (t - t_r)) )

But wait, d would be the vector from the charge's position at t_r to r. So the denominator becomes d - (v/c) (t - t_r). Hmm, but I'm not sure about that.

Wait, let's think about the expression in terms of the vector d. The distance between the charge's position at t_r and r is |d|, and if the charge is moving at velocity v, then the light travel time is t - t_r = |d| / c. So the denominator in the potentials would involve terms like d c - v · d, but I'm not certain.

Looking again at option C: The denominator is (d c - (v · d)). Wait, but d is a vector, so (d c) would be a vector multiplied by c, which is a scalar, so that's fine. But then (v · d) is a scalar. So the denominator becomes a vector multiplied by c minus a scalar? That doesn't make sense because you can't subtract a scalar from a vector.

Ah, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. The denominator in option C is (d c - (v · d)), but that would be a vector (d c) minus a scalar (v · d), which isn't possible. So that must be a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps it's (d × v), but I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (v · d)) times something. Alternatively, perhaps it's (dc - v·d) as a scalar. Wait, but if d is a vector, how can you have dc? Oh, wait, perhaps d is a scalar, the distance. Oh, maybe the problem defines d as the distance, not the vector. So perhaps in the equation, d is the magnitude of the vector from where the charge was to r. So |d| = |r - s(tr)|.

But in that case, the denominator in option C is (d c - (v · d)), which would have units of (m * m/s) - (m/s * m) )= m²/s - m²/s = 0? That can't be right. So perhaps that's a typo.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (v · r)) or something else. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the expressions for the potentials when the charge is moving. The scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r' - (v/c) (t - t'))], where t' is the retarded time. So r' is the position of the charge at t', and the denominator is the distance from the charge's position at t' to the observation point r, adjusted by the velocity.

Wait, but in terms of d, which is the vector from the charge's position at t' to r, then d = r - r'(t'). So the denominator becomes d - (v/c) (t - t'), but since (t - t') = |d| / c, because the light takes time |d|/c to reach r, then the denominator is d - (v/c)(|d|/c) = d (1 - (v · d)/(c² |d|) )).

Hmm, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator simplifies to (d c² - (v · d)) / c.

Wait, let me think about the denominator: d - (v/c) (t - t') = d - (v/c) (|d|/c) ) = d - (v · d)/c² * (c) ?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up terms. Let me try to write this correctly.

The denominator is d - (v/c) (t - t'), and t - t' is |d| / c. So substituting, we get:

d - (v/c) * (|d| / c) ) = d - (v |d| ) / (c²) ).

But this would be a vector expression. So the denominator is d - (v |d| )/( c² ), and the scalar potential would be (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/(d - (v |d| )/(c²) ) ].

But none of the options look like this. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is d (c) - (v · d ), but I'm not sure. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at option C, the denominator is (d c - (v · d)), which would have units of (m * m/s) - (m/s * m) ) = m²/s - m²/s = 0, which can't be correct. So perhaps option C is not correctly written, or maybe I'm misunderstanding the way d is being used.

Wait, perhaps d is a scalar, the distance between the charge's position at t' and the observation point r. So d = |r - r'(t')|. Then, in that case, the denominator would be d c - (v · d), but that still doesn't make sense because v · d is v multiplied by the projection of d on v's direction, which is a length. So d c is (m) * (m/s) = m²/s. v · d is (m/s) * (m) = m²/s. So the denominator would be (d c - (v · d)) = m²/s - m²/s = 0. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the denominator in option C is written incorrectly, and the correct denominator is (d c - v · (d)). But I'm not sure.

Wait, considering that the vector potential for a point charge moving with velocity v is given by:

A = (μ₀ q v )/(4π c² d) ) where d is the distance from the charge's position at t' to r.

Wait, but that's for static fields. Wait, but when the charge is moving, the vector potential would involve terms of v and the distance d.

Option C's vector potential is (μ₀ q c v )/(4π (d c - (v · d)) ), which seems to have the correct μ₀ and dependence on v.

But I'm not sure if the denominator is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator isn't (d c - (v · d)), but just (d c - (v · d)) is a scalar, but that doesn't make sense if d is a vector.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what each option suggests.

Option A: V is the static case, and A is v squared over c squared times V. But that doesn't seem right because A should be proportional to velocity v, not v squared.

Option B: V is static, A is v/c² * V. That could make sense if the charge is moving, but I'm not sure if that's accurate because when the charge is moving, the potentials should account for the motion more intricately.

Option C: V is (q c) / (4πε₀ (d c - (v · d)) ), and A is (μ₀ q c v) / (4π (d c - (v · d)) ). Hmm, the denominator in V has units of (m * m/s - m²/s) ), which as I thought earlier, gives zero? That can't be correct, so perhaps option C is incorrect.

Option D: V is (q c) / (4πε₀ (d c + (v · d)) ), and A is (μ q c v) / (4π (d c + (v · d)) ). Again, same issue with units.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (d c + v · (d unit vector)) )? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the denominator is (d c + v · d), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: The scalar potential for a moving charge in the Lorenz gauge is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/(d - (v/c)(t - t_r)) ]

With d being the distance from the charge's position at t_r to r.

But since t - t_r = |d| / c, the denominator becomes d - (v/c)( |d| / c ) = d - (v |d| )/(c² )

Which is a bit messy. But perhaps the correct expression for V is option C or D, depending on the sign.

Wait, but none of the options seem to match that expression. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think about the vector potential. The vector potential due to a moving charge would be proportional to the charge's velocity. So the vector potential should be A = (something) * v.

Looking at the options, options B, C, D have A proportional to v. Option A has A proportional to v squared, which is unlikely.

So, let's eliminate option A.

Now, between the others, options B, C, D.

Option B: V is static, A is v/c² * V. But if the charge is moving, the scalar potential shouldn't be static anymore because the charge's position is changing, so perhaps option B is wrong.

So it's probably between options C and D.

Now, thinking about the denominator in the scalar potential. The scalar potential involves 1/(d c - v · d), but only if the terms are scalar. But wait, if d is a vector, then how can you multiply it by c and subtract the dot product v · d?

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (v · d)) as a scalar, but that would require d to be a scalar, which it's not. So perhaps the denominator should be (d c - (v · d)) is not correct. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the denominator in option C is written as (d c - v · d), but if d is the vector from the charge's position at t_r to r, then (d c) is a vector multiplied by c, and (v · d) is a scalar. So subtracting a scalar from a vector doesn't make sense, which suggests that the option is written incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake and the denominator is (d c - (v · d)), treating d as a scalar, the magnitude. So perhaps d is the distance, not the vector.

If d is the distance (a scalar), then the denominator (d c - (v · d)) is a scalar, but since v · d is (v)(d cosθ), where θ is the angle between v and d. So (d c - v d cosθ) would be the denominator.

So, in that case, the denominator is (d (c - v cosθ)). So option C's denominator would be d(c) - v·d = d c - (v · d) which, if d is a scalar, would be d (c - v·d/d ), since v·d = v d cosθ, so d (c - v (cosθ)).

So the denominator would be d (c - v cosθ), which makes sense dimensionally. So if that's the case, V would be (q c) / (4π ε₀ d (c - v cosθ) ), which is option C.

Similarly, the vector potential would be (μ₀ q c v )/(4π d (c - v cosθ) ), which matches option C.

Wait, but wait, in the denominator, option C has (d c - v · d), but if d is a scalar, that's d c - v·d = d (c - (v · d)/d ), which is d (c - v cosθ), as earlier.

So then, the denominator is d (c - v cosθ), leading to V = (q c)/(4π ε₀ d (c - v cosθ) ), and A as (μ₀ q c v)/(4π d (c - v cosθ) ).

So option C would be correct.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the scalar potential for a moving charge includes a term like 1/(d - (v/c)(t - t_r)), but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the vector potential.

The vector potential due to a point charge moving with velocity v is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * [ 1 / (d - (v/c)(t - t_r)) ]

Which, using t - t_r = |d| / c, the denominator becomes d - (v |d| )/(c² ) = |d| (1 - (v cosθ)/c ), where θ is the angle between v and d.

So, A would be (μ₀ q v)/(4π c²) * [ 1/( |d| (1 - (v cosθ)/c )) ) ].

Which can be rewritten as (μ₀ q v )/(4π c²) * 1/(d (c - v cosθ)/c) ) = (μ₀ q v c )/(4π c² d (c - v cosθ) ) ) = (μ₀ q v )/(4π c d (c − v cosθ) )

Wait, but option C's A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - v · d)) ), which, if d is a scalar, becomes (μ₀ q c v)/(4π d (c - (v d cosθ)/d )) ) = (μ₀ q c v )/(4π d (c - v cosθ) ), which matches what I got earlier.

So that suggests option C is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought the denominator in V should involve a term like (d c - v · d), but if d is a scalar (distance), then (d c - v · d) would be d c - v d cosθ, which is d (c - v cosθ), and that's correct.

So option C's V is (q c)/(4π ε₀ (d c - v·d)), which is (q c)/(4π ε₀ d (c - v cosθ) ), which matches the expression we derived.

So putting it all together, option C seems to be the correct choice.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving point charge \( q \), we analyze the situation where the charge is moving with velocity \( \vec{v} \) at the retarded time \( t_r \). The vector \( \vec{d} \) represents the displacement from the charge's position at \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \), and \( d = |\vec{d}| \) is the distance between these two points.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - For a moving charge, the scalar potential depends on the retarded time \( t_r \), where \( t > t_r \). The general expression for \( V \) involves the distance \( d \) and the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge.
   - The denominator in \( V \) must account for the motion of the charge, typically involving a term like \( d c - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} \), where \( c \) is the speed of light. This ensures dimensional consistency and correctly incorporates the effects of the charge's motion.
   - Option C provides \( V(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{q c}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 (d c - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d})} \), which matches the expected form for the scalar potential.

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is proportional to the velocity \( \vec{v} \) of the charge and is typically scaled by the permeability \( \mu_0 \) and the same denominator as in \( V \).
   - Option C provides \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) = \dfrac{\mu_0 q c \vec{v}}{4 \pi (d c - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d})} \), which aligns with the expected dependence on \( \vec{v} \) and the motion of the charge.

3. **Elimination of Other Options:**
   - **Option A:** The vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}^2 \), which is incorrect because \( \vec{A} \) should depend linearly on \( \vec{v} \).
   - **Option B:** While \( V \) is correct for a static charge, it does not account for the motion of the charge, making it unsuitable for this scenario.
   - **Option D:** The denominator in both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) includes a \( + \) sign, which is inconsistent with the correct form \( d c - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} \).

### Conclusion:
Option C correctly incorporates the effects of the moving charge, with both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) depending on the distance \( d \), the velocity \( \vec{v} \), and the speed of light \( c \). The denominator \( d c - \vec{v} \cdot \vec{d} \) ensures dimensional consistency and accurately reflects the retarded potential formulation.
