Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully to understand what's going on.

The question describes a series of reactions involving substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. 

Hmm, symmetry groups are related to the shapes of molecules. So, I think I need to figure out the structure of E first. To do that, I need to backtrack through the reactions to identify the possible compounds involved.

Let's break down the reactions step by step.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Alright, let's try to piece this together. Starting with reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). Solvents are often simple molecules. Maybe H is something like water or ethanol. But let's think about common solvents and their reactions. If B and D react in a 1:1 ratio, perhaps B is something like O2 or Cl2, but I'm not sure yet.

Looking at reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong acids could be H2SO4, HCl, HNO3, etc., and weak acids like CH3COOH or H3PO4. But considering the reaction, when C reacts with water, it breaks down into A and two acids. So perhaps C is a salt or a compound that can hydrolyze into acids.

Wait, if F is strong and G is weak, maybe C is a nitrate salt. For example, when nitrates decompose, they can produce nitric acid (strong) and maybe something else. But I'm not sure.

Going back to reaction 1: A and B produce C with 8 equivalents. So the stoichiometry is A + 8B → C. Maybe A is a metal or metal oxide, and B is a diatomic gas like O2 or S. Wait, but if B is a diatomic gas, how many molecules would that be? Let me think about possible reactions.

Another approach: The bright red product C. Bright red solids could be things like iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3·nH2O) which is usually reddish, but I'm not sure if it's bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrate or something else. Or perhaps C is a compound like CuO? No, that's black. Another thought: perhaps C is a chromium compound, like Cr2O3, but I don't remember the color exactly.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reactions leading to E. Reaction 2: C + 2D → E. E is extremely hazardous. Thinking of dangerous chemicals, perhaps E is something like phosgene, or maybe a nerve agent. But more likely, it's a common but dangerous compound.

Wait, another angle: reaction 3 produces two acids when C reacts with water. If F is a strong acid and G a weak one, maybe C is a nitrate (like Ca(NO3)2). When it reacts with water, it could hydrolyze into a weak acid and a strong acid. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite or another salt.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate salt. Let's think: if C is AgNO3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride? Or perhaps it's a compound that when hydrolyzed, produces two different acids. For example, maybe a phosphate salt? Like if C is Ca3(PO4)2, but that doesn't produce two acids. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a metal carbonate. But when a carbonate reacts with water, it would produce carbonic acid, which is weak. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, like NaNO3? No, wait. Or perhaps it's a sulfate. Wait, if C is Al2(SO4)3, reacting with water would give H2SO4 (strong acid) and maybe another acid? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonate ester, but that seems complicated.

Wait, let's think about reaction 4 again. D and B react in 1:1 to form H, a solvent. Solvents are like H2O, ethanol, acetone, etc. Let's say H is water. Then D and B must react to form H2O. So if B is O2, and D is something else. Alternatively, B could be H2 and D could be O2, but their reaction would produce H2O. Or if B is Cl2 and D is something else. Wait, but if B and D combine in 1:1, perhaps H is HCl? No, HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe H is something like ethanol. So if D is CH3CH2OH and B is something else. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is H2O and D is something else. This is getting a bit confusing.

Let me think about reaction 2: C + 2D → E. E is extremely hazardous. Maybe E is a highly toxic gas, like HCN, or something like phosgene. Alternatively, perhaps E is a nerve agent, but I don't know. Alternatively, E could be a highly reactive compound, like ozone.

Wait, another approach: think about possible reactions where C reacts with D to form E. Maybe C is a diatomic molecule, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, considering the first reaction: A + 8B → C. 8 equivalents suggests a high stoichiometric ratio. Suppose A is sodium (Na), and B is oxygen (O2). Then 8 moles of O2 would react with 2 moles of Na to produce NaO2? Wait, but sodium oxide is Na2O. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where B is O2, and A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. For example, lead or another metal forming a dioxide. Wait, but lead(IV) oxide is PbO2, which is dark brown, not bright red.

Wait, maybe A is iron (Fe), and B is sulfur (S). 8 equivalents of S reacting with Fe would form FeS? No, but FeS is black. Alternatively, Fe and S could form FeS2, but I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is another element that forms a compound with a high oxidation state. Alternatively, maybe B is chlorine. 

Wait, perhaps the product C is a chloride. Let's say A is sodium and B is chlorine. 8 equivalents of Cl2 would react with 2 Na to form 2 NaCl. But that product is white, not bright red. So that's probably not it.

Another thought: maybe B is nitrogen gas (N2). But 8 equivalents... Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the fact that C reacts with water to form two different acids. So C must be a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces two different acids. For example, a salt of a diacidic acid. Like, for instance, if C is Mg(NO3)2, but when it reacts with water, it would just dissociate into ions, not form acids. Wait, but maybe C is a nitride. For example, if C is Ca3N2, then reacting with water would produce NH3 and Ca(OH)2. But NH3 is a base, not an acid. So that's not matching.

Wait, what if C is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3. Reacting with water would produce CO2 and H2O, but CO2 is a weak acid (carbonic acid). Hmm, but F and G are acids, so maybe C is a salt of a diprotic acid. Like, for example, NaHCO3. When it reacts with water, would that produce two acids? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite, like CaSO3. Reacting with water might produce H2SO3 (weak acid) but where's the strong acid?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about C reacting with water to produce two acids. One strong and one weak. So F is strong and G is weak.

So, for example, if C is a nitrate salt. Let's say, for instance, it's a nitrate of a metal. But when nitrates decompose, like in the hydrolysis, they can produce nitric acid (HNO3, strong) and maybe another acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different kind of salt.

Wait, maybe C is a phosphate salt. For instance, if C is Mg3(PO4)2. When it reacts with water, maybe it hydrolyzes into H3PO4 (weak acid) and something else. But what about the strong acid? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Wait, another approach: What if C is a nitro compound? Like, maybe nitrobenzene. But when it reacts with water, I'm not sure about the products. Maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a strong acid and another acid. Wait, but metal oxides usually react with water to form metal hydroxides and release H+ ions, but that would be more like the formation of a base.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the first reaction again. A solid reacting with gas B in 8 equivalents to form a bright red product C.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps A is a metal, B is sulfur. 8 equivalents of sulfur reacting with a metal to form a sulfide. For example, FeS is black, but perhaps a different metal. Or maybe it's a metal oxide. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is a diatomic gas like O2, and A is a metal that reacts with O2 in a high ratio to form a compound. For example, Na reacts with O2 to form NaO2? But I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, another thought: Could C be a sulfur-containing compound? For example, if B is S, and A is Fe, forming FeS. FeS is black, not red. Alternatively, maybe it's Fe2O3, which is reddish, but I'm not sure if it's bright red.

Wait, maybe C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but some other chromium compounds are red. Alternatively, perhaps it's a manganese compound, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a transition metal oxide with a red color. Maybe CuO is black, but some other copper compound could be red. Alternatively, maybe it's a vanadium compound, but I don't remember the colors well.

Another angle: when C reacts with D, two equivalents of D are used to produce E. So, for each mole of C, two moles of D are consumed. What if E is something like SO2 or CO2? But those are gases. Alternatively, E could be a diatomic molecule.

Wait, but E is extremely hazardous. Maybe it's chlorine gas? No, chlorine is a gas but not extremely hazardous in the sense of being a war gas; perhaps it's something like phosgene or sarin, but those are more specific.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN or NO.

Wait, considering reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). If H is a common solvent, like ethanol, then perhaps D and B combine to form ethanol. But what would that require? For example, if B is oxygen and D is ethyl something. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe H is water, so D and B combine to form H2O.

If H is water, then D and B are reacting to form H2O. So, perhaps D is H2 and B is O2. Then, 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio of H2 to O2, but in reaction 4, the ratio is 1:1. Hmm, perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe D is HF and B is H2O, but that would produce something else. Alternatively, perhaps D is NH3 and B is H2O, producing something else. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe B is a diatomic gas like Cl2, and D is something else. For example, if D is CH4, then B (Cl2) and D (CH4) react in a 1:1 ratio to form HCl and CH3Cl, but I'm not sure if that's a common solvent.

Wait, perhaps H is a diethyl ether. Then, D and B might be something like ethanol and another molecule, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like H2O, and D is H2O and B is something else. Or, perhaps B is H2O and D is another compound. But this is getting too vague.

Let me try to think about the possible structure of E. Since E is produced from C and D, and it's highly hazardous, perhaps it's a nerve agent. But without knowing its structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like chlorine. But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back at reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. So, A is a solid, F and G are acids. Suppose F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is HNO3 (also strong?), but wait, no, the problem says F is strong and G is weak. So F could be H2SO4, and G could be H3PO4.

But then, C would be a salt that when hydrolyzed produces these acids. So, perhaps C is a sulfate phosphate salt? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate. If C is Ca(NO3)2, then when it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Ca^2+ and NO3^- ions, but that wouldn't produce acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is Mg3N2, then Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to produce C2H2 (acetylene) and Ca(OH)2. Not sure if that's relevant.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps C is a sulfide. If C is FeS, then reacting with water might not produce strong acids. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a superoxide. For example, NaO2. When it reacts with water, it produces O2 and NaOH. But that's a base, not an acid.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Maybe I should think about which of the options for the symmetry group match known molecules.

The options are:

A) C2
B) D4h
C) D∞h
D) C2v

These are symmetry groups of molecules. For example, D4h is the symmetry group of molecules like ozone (O3), which has a certain structure with a center of inversion and other elements. D∞h is the symmetry group of linear molecules like CO2 or H2O (no, wait, H2O has C2v symmetry). Wait, D∞h is for linear molecules with a center of symmetry. For example, CO2 has D∞h symmetry because it's linear with a center of inversion.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. 

- CO2 is linear, has a center of inversion, and has D∞h symmetry.
- H2O has a bent structure and belongs to the C2v point group.
- Ozone (O3) is a nonlinear molecule with a center of inversion and belongs to the D3h group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but I'm not certain about all the point groups. Let's think about the options:

If E has a symmetry group, perhaps it's a molecule like CO2, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry (option C). Or perhaps it's a molecule like H2O, which would have C2v (option D).

But wait, E is a product of C and D. If E is CO2, how would that form?

Alternatively, if E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or Cl2, their symmetry groups would be D∞h (since diatomic molecules have this symmetry).

Wait, but E is produced from C and D. Let's think about possible reactions.

If E is a diatomic molecule like O2, but that's a gas. But in the question, E is extremely hazardous, so perhaps it's something like phosgene (COCl2), but I'm not sure about its symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a triatomic molecule like SO2 or O3. SO2 has a bent structure, which would belong to the D3h group, but I'm not sure if that's one of the options. Alternatively, O3 has a certain symmetry.

Wait, the options given are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

If E is a diatomic molecule, it would have D∞h symmetry. If it's a linear molecule like CO2, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but how would CO2 form? Let's see:

If C is a carbonate salt, like CaCO3, and D is something else. Then reaction 2: CaCO3 + 2D → CO2 + something. But E is CO2, which is a gas. But in the reaction, 2 equivalents of D are used. So, it's possible that D is a carbonate.

Alternatively, maybe C is CaCO3 and D is H2SO4. Then, perhaps the reaction is: CaCO3 + H2SO4 → CaSO4 + CO2 + H2O. But that would produce E as CO2, which is a gas. But the question says E is extremely hazardous, and CO2 isn't that dangerous unless in high concentrations.

Wait, but maybe E is a more dangerous gas, like Cl2 or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2), which is highly toxic. Phosgene is a triatomic molecule with a structure of O=C(Cl)2. Its structure is trigonal planar, but I'm not sure about its symmetry group.

Wait, the symmetry of phosgene: it has a central carbon double-bonded to O and two Cl atoms. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion. Each Cl is opposite the other, so the symmetry group would be D∞h? Or another group.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a linear molecule like O=C=O (CO2), which has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but then, how would CO2 form? From C and D.

But let's think back: if reaction 2 is C + 2D → E. If E is CO2, then perhaps C is a carbonate (like CaCO3) and D is something like HCl (but HCl is a gas, not sure). Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate and D is a hydroxide, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate, and D is a strong acid, which would produce CO2 gas. For example, if C is CaCO3, and D is H2SO4 (but H2SO4 is a liquid, not a gas), but in the question, D is a gas. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about D. If D is a gas, and in reaction 4, D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So D is likely a gas that combines with B (another gas) to form a solvent. One possibility is that H is H2O, so D and B could be H2 and O2. But their reaction would be 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O, which is a 2:1 ratio, but reaction 4 says 1:1. So perhaps H is something else.

Wait, another possibility: H is ethanol (C2H5OH). But to form ethanol from two gases in a 1:1 ratio, what would D and B be? Perhaps D is CO and B is H2, but that would require a reaction like CO + 2H2 → CH3OH (methanol), but that's not 1:1.

Alternatively, maybe H is methanol. Then, D and B could be CO and H2 in a 1:1 ratio. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps H is NH3. Then, D and B could be N2 and H2, but that would require a synthesis reaction like N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3, but that's a 1:3 ratio, not 1:1.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the symmetry groups of the options to see which one aligns with a dangerous gas.

Option C is D∞h, which is the symmetry of CO2 and other linear molecules. If E is CO2, then the symmetry group would be D∞h. But earlier I thought CO2 is not extremely hazardous, but perhaps in the context of the problem, it's considered so.

Alternatively, option B is D4h. Ozone has D3h symmetry, so that's not matching. Another thought: perhaps E is a molecule like SO2, which has a bent structure and a symmetry group of D3h or C2v. Wait, SO2 has a bent structure and a center of inversion; I think its point group is D3h, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is a molecule like H2O, which has C2v symmetry. But H2O isn't extremely hazardous unless in very high concentrations.

Wait, another option: perhaps E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or Cl2. O2 has D∞h symmetry, Cl2 also. If E is O2, but O2 isn't extremely hazardous in normal concentrations, but perhaps in the context of the problem, it is.

Wait, but how would O2 form from C and D? Let me think: if C is an oxide and D is another oxide. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like SO3, which is a trigonal planar molecule with D3h symmetry. But SO3 isn't a diatomic, so D∞h wouldn't be its symmetry group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me try a different approach. The problem asks for the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is a triatomic molecule with a center of inversion, like O3, then its symmetry group would be D3h. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, if E is a diatomic, then D∞h.

Another angle: If E is a molecule like phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), its structure is planar with two Cl atoms opposite each other. So it's a trigonal planar molecule with a center of inversion. The symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C. Because D∞h includes a center of inversion and two-fold axes perpendicular to the main axis (which would be the C=O axis in phosgene).

Alternatively, if E is phosgene, which is a highly toxic gas, that could fit the description of the question. So E would have D∞h symmetry.

But how does E form from C and D? Let's think:

If C is a carbonate (like CaCO3) and D is Cl2, then reaction 2 would be CaCO3 + 2Cl2 → CaCl2 + COCl2 + something. Wait, but phosgene is O=C(Cl)2. So if CaCO3 reacts with Cl2, under certain conditions, perhaps it produces CaCl2, COCl2 (phosgene), and O2. But I'm not sure about the exact reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

CaCO3 + 2Cl2 → CaCl2 + COCl2 + O2.

But I'm not certain about the stoichiometry here. Alternatively, maybe it's a decomposition reaction. Hmm.

Wait, but the reaction uses 2 equivalents of D (Cl2) to produce 1 equivalent of E (phosgene). So perhaps the reaction is something like:

If C is a chlorinated carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene, and C is a chlorinated salt. But I'm not certain.

Putting this all together, I'm leaning towards E being a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, such as CO2 or phosgene. But I'm not entirely sure about the reaction steps.

Alternatively, perhaps E is SO2. But SO2 has a bent structure and C2v symmetry, which is option D.

Wait, the question says that when C reacts with water, it produces A and two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). If F is H2SO4 and G is HNO3, then C would be a sulfate and nitrate salt. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if C is Ca(NO3)2, then it would dissociate into Ca^2+ and NO3^- ions. But that wouldn't produce acids upon hydrolysis. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitro compound, like nitrobenzene, but then reacting with water wouldn't produce acids.

This is getting quite complicated, and I'm not making much progress. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the symmetry groups.

If E is a diatomic molecule, its symmetry group would be D∞h (option C). Diatomic molecules like O2, Cl2, etc., have this symmetry. If E is a diatomic, that would make sense.

But how does E form from C and D? If E is O2, perhaps C is a peroxide and D is something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if E is Cl2, which is a diatomic gas, but how would that form?

Wait, perhaps reaction 2 is the decomposition of C, which is a chlorate, releasing Cl2 gas. For example, if C is KClO3, it can decompose into KCl and O2, but not Cl2. Hmm.

Alternatively, if C is Ca(ClO)2, then upon heating, it might decompose into CaCl2 and O2. But again, not Cl2.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorate that when heated produces Cl2. For example, 2 KClO3 → 2 KCl + 3 O2. But that produces O2, not Cl2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe E is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, so the answer is C) D∞h.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of compound E, based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. While the exact identity of C is unclear, it is likely a compound that forms a bright red solid, possibly a metal oxide or a transition metal compound.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is described as extremely hazardous. This suggests E could be a highly toxic gas or a reactive compound. Possible candidates include diatomic molecules like O₂ or Cl₂, or triatomic molecules like SO₂ or O₃.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This indicates that C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes to form acids. For example, if C were a carbonate or nitrate salt, it could produce strong and weak acids upon hydrolysis.

4. **Reaction 4**: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests that D and B combine to form a common solvent, possibly water (H₂O), ethanol, or another simple molecule.

### Symmetry Group Analysis:
The options for the molecular symmetry group of E are:
- **A) C2**: This is a simple twofold rotation axis, typical of molecules like H₂O (if linear) or certain bent molecules.
- **B) D₄h**: This is a higher-order symmetry group with a fourfold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, common in molecules like ozone (O₃).
- **C) D∞h**: This is the symmetry group of linear molecules with a center of inversion, such as CO₂ or Cl₂.
- **D) C₂v**: This is the symmetry group of bent molecules like H₂O or SO₂.

Given that E is described as extremely hazardous, it is likely a diatomic or triatomic molecule. If E is a diatomic molecule like O₂ or Cl₂, it would have **D∞h** symmetry. If E were a triatomic molecule like SO₂, it would have **C₂v** symmetry. However, the problem's emphasis on E being extremely hazardous and the symmetry group options provided strongly suggests that E is a diatomic molecule with **D∞h** symmetry.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.

Answer: C

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully to understand what's going on.

The question describes a series of reactions involving substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options given are symmetry groups like C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v. 

Hmm, symmetry groups are related to the shapes of molecules. So, I think I need to figure out the structure of E first. To do that, I need to backtrack through the reactions to identify the possible compounds involved.

Let's break down the reactions step by step.

1. Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C.
2. C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is extremely hazardous.
3. C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, and G is a weak acid.
4. D reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is used as a solvent.

Alright, let's try to piece this together. Starting with reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). Solvents are often simple molecules. Maybe H is something like water or ethanol. But let's think about common solvents and their reactions. If B and D react in a 1:1 ratio, perhaps B is something like O2 or Cl2, but I'm not sure yet.

Looking at reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid. Strong acids could be H2SO4, HCl, HNO3, etc., and weak acids like CH3COOH or H3PO4. But considering the reaction, when C reacts with water, it breaks down into A and two acids. So perhaps C is a salt or a compound that can hydrolyze into acids.

Wait, if F is strong and G is weak, maybe C is a nitrate salt. For example, when nitrates decompose, they can produce nitric acid (strong) and maybe something else. But I'm not sure.

Going back to reaction 1: A and B produce C with 8 equivalents. So the stoichiometry is A + 8B → C. Maybe A is a metal or metal oxide, and B is a diatomic gas like O2 or S. Wait, but if B is a diatomic gas, how many molecules would that be? Let me think about possible reactions.

Another approach: The bright red product C. Bright red solids could be things like iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3·nH2O) which is usually reddish, but I'm not sure if it's bright red. Alternatively, maybe it's a nitrate or something else. Or perhaps C is a compound like CuO? No, that's black. Another thought: perhaps C is a chromium compound, like Cr2O3, but I don't remember the color exactly.

Wait, maybe I should think about the reactions leading to E. Reaction 2: C + 2D → E. E is extremely hazardous. Thinking of dangerous chemicals, perhaps E is something like phosgene, or maybe a nerve agent. But more likely, it's a common but dangerous compound.

Wait, another angle: reaction 3 produces two acids when C reacts with water. If F is a strong acid and G a weak one, maybe C is a nitrate (like Ca(NO3)2). When it reacts with water, it could hydrolyze into a weak acid and a strong acid. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite or another salt.

Wait, maybe C is a nitrate salt. Let's think: if C is AgNO3, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride? Or perhaps it's a compound that when hydrolyzed, produces two different acids. For example, maybe a phosphate salt? Like if C is Ca3(PO4)2, but that doesn't produce two acids. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps C is a metal carbonate. But when a carbonate reacts with water, it would produce carbonic acid, which is weak. So maybe that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitride, like NaNO3? No, wait. Or perhaps it's a sulfate. Wait, if C is Al2(SO4)3, reacting with water would give H2SO4 (strong acid) and maybe another acid? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe C is a sulfonate ester, but that seems complicated.

Wait, let's think about reaction 4 again. D and B react in 1:1 to form H, a solvent. Solvents are like H2O, ethanol, acetone, etc. Let's say H is water. Then D and B must react to form H2O. So if B is O2, and D is something else. Alternatively, B could be H2 and D could be O2, but their reaction would produce H2O. Or if B is Cl2 and D is something else. Wait, but if B and D combine in 1:1, perhaps H is HCl? No, HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, maybe H is something like ethanol. So if D is CH3CH2OH and B is something else. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe B is H2O and D is something else. This is getting a bit confusing.

Let me think about reaction 2: C + 2D → E. E is extremely hazardous. Maybe E is a highly toxic gas, like HCN, or something like phosgene. Alternatively, perhaps E is a nerve agent, but I don't know. Alternatively, E could be a highly reactive compound, like ozone.

Wait, another approach: think about possible reactions where C reacts with D to form E. Maybe C is a diatomic molecule, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, considering the first reaction: A + 8B → C. 8 equivalents suggests a high stoichiometric ratio. Suppose A is sodium (Na), and B is oxygen (O2). Then 8 moles of O2 would react with 2 moles of Na to produce NaO2? Wait, but sodium oxide is Na2O. Alternatively, maybe it's a reaction where B is O2, and A is a metal that forms a high oxidation state oxide. For example, lead or another metal forming a dioxide. Wait, but lead(IV) oxide is PbO2, which is dark brown, not bright red.

Wait, maybe A is iron (Fe), and B is sulfur (S). 8 equivalents of S reacting with Fe would form FeS? No, but FeS is black. Alternatively, Fe and S could form FeS2, but I'm not sure about the color. Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal and B is another element that forms a compound with a high oxidation state. Alternatively, maybe B is chlorine. 

Wait, perhaps the product C is a chloride. Let's say A is sodium and B is chlorine. 8 equivalents of Cl2 would react with 2 Na to form 2 NaCl. But that product is white, not bright red. So that's probably not it.

Another thought: maybe B is nitrogen gas (N2). But 8 equivalents... Hmm.

Wait, another angle: the fact that C reacts with water to form two different acids. So C must be a salt that, when hydrolyzed, produces two different acids. For example, a salt of a diacidic acid. Like, for instance, if C is Mg(NO3)2, but when it reacts with water, it would just dissociate into ions, not form acids. Wait, but maybe C is a nitride. For example, if C is Ca3N2, then reacting with water would produce NH3 and Ca(OH)2. But NH3 is a base, not an acid. So that's not matching.

Wait, what if C is a metal carbonate. For example, CaCO3. Reacting with water would produce CO2 and H2O, but CO2 is a weak acid (carbonic acid). Hmm, but F and G are acids, so maybe C is a salt of a diprotic acid. Like, for example, NaHCO3. When it reacts with water, would that produce two acids? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfite, like CaSO3. Reacting with water might produce H2SO3 (weak acid) but where's the strong acid?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about C reacting with water to produce two acids. One strong and one weak. So F is strong and G is weak.

So, for example, if C is a nitrate salt. Let's say, for instance, it's a nitrate of a metal. But when nitrates decompose, like in the hydrolysis, they can produce nitric acid (HNO3, strong) and maybe another acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different kind of salt.

Wait, maybe C is a phosphate salt. For instance, if C is Mg3(PO4)2. When it reacts with water, maybe it hydrolyzes into H3PO4 (weak acid) and something else. But what about the strong acid? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfonate ester, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Wait, another approach: What if C is a nitro compound? Like, maybe nitrobenzene. But when it reacts with water, I'm not sure about the products. Maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal oxide that reacts with water to form a strong acid and another acid. Wait, but metal oxides usually react with water to form metal hydroxides and release H+ ions, but that would be more like the formation of a base.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the first reaction again. A solid reacting with gas B in 8 equivalents to form a bright red product C.

Wait, another idea: Perhaps A is a metal, B is sulfur. 8 equivalents of sulfur reacting with a metal to form a sulfide. For example, FeS is black, but perhaps a different metal. Or maybe it's a metal oxide. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe B is a diatomic gas like O2, and A is a metal that reacts with O2 in a high ratio to form a compound. For example, Na reacts with O2 to form NaO2? But I'm not sure about the color.

Wait, another thought: Could C be a sulfur-containing compound? For example, if B is S, and A is Fe, forming FeS. FeS is black, not red. Alternatively, maybe it's Fe2O3, which is reddish, but I'm not sure if it's bright red.

Wait, maybe C is a chromium compound. Chromium(III) oxide is green, but some other chromium compounds are red. Alternatively, perhaps it's a manganese compound, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a transition metal oxide with a red color. Maybe CuO is black, but some other copper compound could be red. Alternatively, maybe it's a vanadium compound, but I don't remember the colors well.

Another angle: when C reacts with D, two equivalents of D are used to produce E. So, for each mole of C, two moles of D are consumed. What if E is something like SO2 or CO2? But those are gases. Alternatively, E could be a diatomic molecule.

Wait, but E is extremely hazardous. Maybe it's chlorine gas? No, chlorine is a gas but not extremely hazardous in the sense of being a war gas; perhaps it's something like phosgene or sarin, but those are more specific.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like HCN or NO.

Wait, considering reaction 4: D + B → H (solvent). If H is a common solvent, like ethanol, then perhaps D and B combine to form ethanol. But what would that require? For example, if B is oxygen and D is ethyl something. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe H is water, so D and B combine to form H2O.

If H is water, then D and B are reacting to form H2O. So, perhaps D is H2 and B is O2. Then, 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O. But that's a 2:1 ratio of H2 to O2, but in reaction 4, the ratio is 1:1. Hmm, perhaps that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe D is HF and B is H2O, but that would produce something else. Alternatively, perhaps D is NH3 and B is H2O, producing something else. Not sure.

Wait, another thought: Maybe B is a diatomic gas like Cl2, and D is something else. For example, if D is CH4, then B (Cl2) and D (CH4) react in a 1:1 ratio to form HCl and CH3Cl, but I'm not sure if that's a common solvent.

Wait, perhaps H is a diethyl ether. Then, D and B might be something like ethanol and another molecule, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe H is something like H2O, and D is H2O and B is something else. Or, perhaps B is H2O and D is another compound. But this is getting too vague.

Let me try to think about the possible structure of E. Since E is produced from C and D, and it's highly hazardous, perhaps it's a nerve agent. But without knowing its structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like chlorine. But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back at reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F + G. So, A is a solid, F and G are acids. Suppose F is H2SO4 (strong) and G is HNO3 (also strong?), but wait, no, the problem says F is strong and G is weak. So F could be H2SO4, and G could be H3PO4.

But then, C would be a salt that when hydrolyzed produces these acids. So, perhaps C is a sulfate phosphate salt? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is a nitrate. If C is Ca(NO3)2, then when it reacts with water, it would dissociate into Ca^2+ and NO3^- ions, but that wouldn't produce acids. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitride. For example, if C is Mg3N2, then Mg3N2 + H2O → Mg(OH)2 and NH3. But NH3 is a weak base, not an acid. So that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe C is a carbide. For example, CaC2 reacts with water to produce C2H2 (acetylene) and Ca(OH)2. Not sure if that's relevant.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps C is a sulfide. If C is FeS, then reacting with water might not produce strong acids. Hmm.

Wait, maybe C is a superoxide. For example, NaO2. When it reacts with water, it produces O2 and NaOH. But that's a base, not an acid.

Hmm, this is getting tricky. Maybe I should think about which of the options for the symmetry group match known molecules.

The options are:

A) C2
B) D4h
C) D∞h
D) C2v

These are symmetry groups of molecules. For example, D4h is the symmetry group of molecules like ozone (O3), which has a certain structure with a center of inversion and other elements. D∞h is the symmetry group of linear molecules like CO2 or H2O (no, wait, H2O has C2v symmetry). Wait, D∞h is for linear molecules with a center of symmetry. For example, CO2 has D∞h symmetry because it's linear with a center of inversion.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. 

- CO2 is linear, has a center of inversion, and has D∞h symmetry.
- H2O has a bent structure and belongs to the C2v point group.
- Ozone (O3) is a nonlinear molecule with a center of inversion and belongs to the D3h group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but I'm not certain about all the point groups. Let's think about the options:

If E has a symmetry group, perhaps it's a molecule like CO2, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry (option C). Or perhaps it's a molecule like H2O, which would have C2v (option D).

But wait, E is a product of C and D. If E is CO2, how would that form?

Alternatively, if E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or Cl2, their symmetry groups would be D∞h (since diatomic molecules have this symmetry).

Wait, but E is produced from C and D. Let's think about possible reactions.

If E is a diatomic molecule like O2, but that's a gas. But in the question, E is extremely hazardous, so perhaps it's something like phosgene (COCl2), but I'm not sure about its symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a triatomic molecule like SO2 or O3. SO2 has a bent structure, which would belong to the D3h group, but I'm not sure if that's one of the options. Alternatively, O3 has a certain symmetry.

Wait, the options given are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

If E is a diatomic molecule, it would have D∞h symmetry. If it's a linear molecule like CO2, which is linear and has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but how would CO2 form? Let's see:

If C is a carbonate salt, like CaCO3, and D is something else. Then reaction 2: CaCO3 + 2D → CO2 + something. But E is CO2, which is a gas. But in the reaction, 2 equivalents of D are used. So, it's possible that D is a carbonate.

Alternatively, maybe C is CaCO3 and D is H2SO4. Then, perhaps the reaction is: CaCO3 + H2SO4 → CaSO4 + CO2 + H2O. But that would produce E as CO2, which is a gas. But the question says E is extremely hazardous, and CO2 isn't that dangerous unless in high concentrations.

Wait, but maybe E is a more dangerous gas, like Cl2 or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene (COCl2), which is highly toxic. Phosgene is a triatomic molecule with a structure of O=C(Cl)2. Its structure is trigonal planar, but I'm not sure about its symmetry group.

Wait, the symmetry of phosgene: it has a central carbon double-bonded to O and two Cl atoms. The molecule is planar and has a center of inversion. Each Cl is opposite the other, so the symmetry group would be D∞h? Or another group.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a linear molecule like O=C=O (CO2), which has D∞h symmetry.

Wait, but then, how would CO2 form? From C and D.

But let's think back: if reaction 2 is C + 2D → E. If E is CO2, then perhaps C is a carbonate (like CaCO3) and D is something like HCl (but HCl is a gas, not sure). Alternatively, maybe C is a carbonate and D is a hydroxide, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a metal carbonate, and D is a strong acid, which would produce CO2 gas. For example, if C is CaCO3, and D is H2SO4 (but H2SO4 is a liquid, not a gas), but in the question, D is a gas. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about D. If D is a gas, and in reaction 4, D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. So D is likely a gas that combines with B (another gas) to form a solvent. One possibility is that H is H2O, so D and B could be H2 and O2. But their reaction would be 2H2 + O2 → 2H2O, which is a 2:1 ratio, but reaction 4 says 1:1. So perhaps H is something else.

Wait, another possibility: H is ethanol (C2H5OH). But to form ethanol from two gases in a 1:1 ratio, what would D and B be? Perhaps D is CO and B is H2, but that would require a reaction like CO + 2H2 → CH3OH (methanol), but that's not 1:1.

Alternatively, maybe H is methanol. Then, D and B could be CO and H2 in a 1:1 ratio. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps H is NH3. Then, D and B could be N2 and H2, but that would require a synthesis reaction like N2 + 3H2 → 2NH3, but that's a 1:3 ratio, not 1:1.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the symmetry groups of the options to see which one aligns with a dangerous gas.

Option C is D∞h, which is the symmetry of CO2 and other linear molecules. If E is CO2, then the symmetry group would be D∞h. But earlier I thought CO2 is not extremely hazardous, but perhaps in the context of the problem, it's considered so.

Alternatively, option B is D4h. Ozone has D3h symmetry, so that's not matching. Another thought: perhaps E is a molecule like SO2, which has a bent structure and a symmetry group of D3h or C2v. Wait, SO2 has a bent structure and a center of inversion; I think its point group is D3h, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe E is a molecule like H2O, which has C2v symmetry. But H2O isn't extremely hazardous unless in very high concentrations.

Wait, another option: perhaps E is a diatomic molecule like O2 or Cl2. O2 has D∞h symmetry, Cl2 also. If E is O2, but O2 isn't extremely hazardous in normal concentrations, but perhaps in the context of the problem, it is.

Wait, but how would O2 form from C and D? Let me think: if C is an oxide and D is another oxide. But not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like SO3, which is a trigonal planar molecule with D3h symmetry. But SO3 isn't a diatomic, so D∞h wouldn't be its symmetry group.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Let me try a different approach. The problem asks for the molecular symmetry group of E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, C2v.

If E is a triatomic molecule with a center of inversion, like O3, then its symmetry group would be D3h. But that's not one of the options. Alternatively, if E is a diatomic, then D∞h.

Another angle: If E is a molecule like phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), its structure is planar with two Cl atoms opposite each other. So it's a trigonal planar molecule with a center of inversion. The symmetry group would be D∞h, which is option C. Because D∞h includes a center of inversion and two-fold axes perpendicular to the main axis (which would be the C=O axis in phosgene).

Alternatively, if E is phosgene, which is a highly toxic gas, that could fit the description of the question. So E would have D∞h symmetry.

But how does E form from C and D? Let's think:

If C is a carbonate (like CaCO3) and D is Cl2, then reaction 2 would be CaCO3 + 2Cl2 → CaCl2 + COCl2 + something. Wait, but phosgene is O=C(Cl)2. So if CaCO3 reacts with Cl2, under certain conditions, perhaps it produces CaCl2, COCl2 (phosgene), and O2. But I'm not sure about the exact reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is:

CaCO3 + 2Cl2 → CaCl2 + COCl2 + O2.

But I'm not certain about the stoichiometry here. Alternatively, maybe it's a decomposition reaction. Hmm.

Wait, but the reaction uses 2 equivalents of D (Cl2) to produce 1 equivalent of E (phosgene). So perhaps the reaction is something like:

If C is a chlorinated carbonate, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is phosgene, and C is a chlorinated salt. But I'm not certain.

Putting this all together, I'm leaning towards E being a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry, such as CO2 or phosgene. But I'm not entirely sure about the reaction steps.

Alternatively, perhaps E is SO2. But SO2 has a bent structure and C2v symmetry, which is option D.

Wait, the question says that when C reacts with water, it produces A and two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). If F is H2SO4 and G is HNO3, then C would be a sulfate and nitrate salt. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if C is Ca(NO3)2, then it would dissociate into Ca^2+ and NO3^- ions. But that wouldn't produce acids upon hydrolysis. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps C is a nitro compound, like nitrobenzene, but then reacting with water wouldn't produce acids.

This is getting quite complicated, and I'm not making much progress. Let me try to make an educated guess based on the symmetry groups.

If E is a diatomic molecule, its symmetry group would be D∞h (option C). Diatomic molecules like O2, Cl2, etc., have this symmetry. If E is a diatomic, that would make sense.

But how does E form from C and D? If E is O2, perhaps C is a peroxide and D is something else, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if E is Cl2, which is a diatomic gas, but how would that form?

Wait, perhaps reaction 2 is the decomposition of C, which is a chlorate, releasing Cl2 gas. For example, if C is KClO3, it can decompose into KCl and O2, but not Cl2. Hmm.

Alternatively, if C is Ca(ClO)2, then upon heating, it might decompose into CaCl2 and O2. But again, not Cl2.

Alternatively, perhaps C is a chlorate that when heated produces Cl2. For example, 2 KClO3 → 2 KCl + 3 O2. But that produces O2, not Cl2.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe E is a diatomic molecule with D∞h symmetry, so the answer is C) D∞h.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of compound E, based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. While the exact identity of C is unclear, it is likely a compound that forms a bright red solid, possibly a metal oxide or a transition metal compound.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, which is described as extremely hazardous. This suggests E could be a highly toxic gas or a reactive compound. Possible candidates include diatomic molecules like O₂ or Cl₂, or triatomic molecules like SO₂ or O₃.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This indicates that C is likely a salt that hydrolyzes to form acids. For example, if C were a carbonate or nitrate salt, it could produce strong and weak acids upon hydrolysis.

4. **Reaction 4**: D and B react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This suggests that D and B combine to form a common solvent, possibly water (H₂O), ethanol, or another simple molecule.

### Symmetry Group Analysis:
The options for the molecular symmetry group of E are:
- **A) C2**: This is a simple twofold rotation axis, typical of molecules like H₂O (if linear) or certain bent molecules.
- **B) D₄h**: This is a higher-order symmetry group with a fourfold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane, common in molecules like ozone (O₃).
- **C) D∞h**: This is the symmetry group of linear molecules with a center of inversion, such as CO₂ or Cl₂.
- **D) C₂v**: This is the symmetry group of bent molecules like H₂O or SO₂.

Given that E is described as extremely hazardous, it is likely a diatomic or triatomic molecule. If E is a diatomic molecule like O₂ or Cl₂, it would have **D∞h** symmetry. If E were a triatomic molecule like SO₂, it would have **C₂v** symmetry. However, the problem's emphasis on E being extremely hazardous and the symmetry group options provided strongly suggests that E is a diatomic molecule with **D∞h** symmetry.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the molecular symmetry group of E is **D∞h**.

Answer: C
