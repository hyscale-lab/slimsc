Okay, so I've got this genetics question about barley and mutant genes. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some concepts, but I'll do my best.

The question is about a drought-resistant barley cultivar that has an anti-nutritional compound. The gene responsible for making this compound has five exons and four introns. The goal is to eliminate the compound by using EMS mutagenesis. They've sequenced four mutants and are looking for which mutation would likely remove the anti-nutritional compound.

Looking at the options, each mutant has a change in the first exon. I remember that exons are the coding regions of the gene, so any mutation here could potentially change the protein product. But how do these mutations affect the gene function?

The intact gene's sequence is provided, and each mutant has a different change. Let me look at each mutant's sequence and see what kind of mutation it is and where it occurs.

The intact gene starts with ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT...TGA. 

Mutant 1:
ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC...TGA
Hmm, comparing to the intact gene. Let me line them up.
Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant1: ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Wait, so in the third codon, the original is CTC (which is Leu), mutant1 is TAC, which is Tyr. So that's a substitution. Then, looking further, I see the next part has GCT in original and GCT in mutant. Oh wait, maybe I should look for where the difference is. Let me count the nucleotides. The original starts as ATG TTT CTC GCT... So positions 1-3: ATG (start), 4-6: TTT (Phe), 7-9: CTC (Leu), 10-12: GCT (Ala), etc.

Mutant 1's second codon is TCT (Ser) instead of TTT (Phe) at position 4-6. Then, looking a bit ahead, the next codon in original is CTC (Leu), but in mutant1 it's TAC (Tyr). Wait, maybe I should write the sequences:

Original Exon 1: 5' ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... 3'
Mutant1:          5' ATG TCT TAC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA ... 3'

So in the second codon, TTT → TCT? That's a point mutation: Phe → Ser. Then third codon, CTC → TAC? Wait, CTC is Leu, TAC is Tyr. That's a substitution. But then, looking at the next codon, GCT is same as original? Hmm.

Wait, but the question says that the mutation is at the beginning of the sequence in the first exon. So perhaps the mutations are in the early exons, which would affect the start or early parts of the protein.

But wait, the key is to find a mutation that disrupts the gene's function. So perhaps a frameshift or a stop codon would be effective. But looking at the options, I don't see any stop codons early on. Let me check each mutant.

Wait, let me check each mutant's sequence for possible stop codons or frameshifts.

First, the original gene starts with ATG (which is the start codon, methionine). All the mutants start with ATG as well, so the start codon is intact.

Looking for stop codons in the early parts. Stop codons are TAA, TAG, or TGA. Let me look through the sequences for any of these.

Looking at Mutant 1:
The end of the sequence they show is ...TGA. Oh wait, TGA is a stop codon. So in the middle of the sequence, the mutant 1 has TGA. Wait, but the original ends with TGA as well. No, wait, the original was ...TGA, and mutant1 is ...TGA. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the exact point. Let me look more carefully.

In the intact gene, the sequence is ...TGTCGT…TGA. So the last part before the stop is ...TGTCGT and then TGA. In mutant1, it's ...TGTCGC…TGA. So the last part before stop is ...TGTCGC. So, the codon before stop is CGC in mutant1, which is an arginine, I think. No stop codon introduced.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me look again.

Original last part: …GTCGT…TGA
Mutant1: …GTCGC…TGA

So the codons would be ... GTC GT... (no, perhaps I should write them as triplets. Let me see the exact sequences.

Original:
...GTCGT…TGA → So the last part is GTC GT followed by TGA. Hmm, perhaps I'm not seeing a stop codon here.

Wait, perhaps I should look for any introduced stop codons in the middle of the sequence. Let's see.

Mutant 2:
5’-ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’
So the change is in the third codon perhaps. Let me compare:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...
Mutant2: ATG TCT TAA GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA...

So, in the third and fourth codons: CTC → TAA, then GCT → GCT? Wait, no, looking at the sequence:

Original: ...CTC GCT GGT...
Mutant2: ...TAA GCT GGT...
So the third codon is CTC → TAA. CTC is Leu, TAA is stop. Oh! So in mutant2, the third codon is TAA, which is a stop codon. So the protein would be truncated after the second amino acid.

If the gene product is responsible for producing the anti-nutritional compound, a premature stop codon would likely result in a non-functional protein. So mutant2 would produce a truncated protein, possibly making the compound not be produced. That could eliminate the anti-nutritional compound.

Wait, but let me check the other mutants as well.

Mutant3:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Comparing to original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant3's sequence: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Then, the fourth codon is GCT as before.

Wait, but looking further, I see that in the original, after GCT is GGT, then ACT. In mutant3, perhaps after GCT, it's GGT, then GTC instead of ACT?

Wait, perhaps I should line them up:

Original Exon1: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT...

Mutant3: ATG TTT TAC GCT GGT GTC ACT TCT GTG GAT...

So the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). The fourth codon is GCT (Ala) same. Then fifth codon: GGT (original) same. Then sixth codon: ACT (Thr) in original, but in mutant3 it's GTC (Val). So a substitution there.

So in mutant3, two substitutions: third codon Leu→Tyr, sixth codon Thr→Val. Not introducing a stop codon, so the protein would still be made but with altered amino acids. Maybe this would disrupt the compound's synthesis, but perhaps it's not as effective as a stop codon.

Mutant4:
5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’
Original: ...CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant4: ...TAC GCT ACT TCT...

Wait, let's see:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant4: ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So the third codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of CTC (Leu). Fourth codon: GCT (Ala) same. Fifth codon: GCT (Ala) in original, becomes ACT (Thr) in mutant4.

Wait, no, let me check the sequence:

Original (exon1): ...CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant4: ...TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So the third codon is TAC, fourth is GCT, fifth is ACT. Hmm, the original fifth codon is GGT (maybe I'm getting the positions wrong). Let me write them as triplets.

Original: ...CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT...
Mutant4: ...TAC GCT ACT TCT...

So, third codon CTC → TAC (Leu → Tyr), fifth codon GGT → ACT (Glu → Thr?), wait wait, GGT is Gly, ACT is Thr. So two substitutions. No stop codons introduced here either.

So, looking at the options:

Mutant1: two amino acid substitutions (Phe→Ser, Leu→Tyr), no stop codon.

Mutant2: third codon becomes TAA (Leu → stop). So the mRNA would be translated until the stop codon, making a shorter, nonfunctional protein.

Mutant3: two substitutions (Leu→Tyr, Thr→Val).

Mutant4: substitutions in two positions (Leu→Tyr, Gly→Thr).

So, the most likely way to eliminate the compound is to disrupt the gene's function. A frameshift would change the reading frame, but no frameshift is evident here because the mutations are substitutions, not insertions or deletions. So the only way is to introduce a stop codon early, which would truncate the protein.

Mutant2 has a stop codon at the third codon, so the resulting protein would be much shorter. This likely disrupts the function of the gene, preventing the compound from being synthesized.

So the correct answer would be Mutant2, which is option A.

To determine which mutation would most likely eliminate the anti-nutritional compound in the barley cultivar, we analyze the provided sequences of the intact gene and the four mutants. The gene consists of five exons, and the mutations occur in the first exon. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, such as by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein structure.

### Analysis of Each Mutant:
1. **Mutant 1**:  
   - Sequence: `ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA`  
   - Comparison to the intact gene:  
     - Second codon: `TTT` (Phe) → `TCT` (Ser)  
     - Third codon: `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr)  
   - No stop codons introduced. The protein would be altered but likely remain functional.  

2. **Mutant 2**:  
   - Sequence: `ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA`  
   - Comparison to the intact gene:  
     - Second codon: `TTT` (Phe) → `TCT` (Ser)  
     - Third codon: `CTC` (Leu) → `TAA` (Stop)  
   - A premature stop codon (`TAA`) is introduced at the third codon. This truncates the protein, making it nonfunctional and likely preventing the synthesis of the anti-nutritional compound.  

3. **Mutant 3**:  
   - Sequence: `ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA`  
   - Comparison to the intact gene:  
     - Third codon: `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr)  
     - Sixth codon: `ACT` (Thr) → `GTC` (Val)  
   - No stop codons introduced. The protein would have two amino acid substitutions but remain functional.  

4. **Mutant 4**:  
   - Sequence: `ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA`  
   - Comparison to the intact gene:  
     - Third codon: `CTC` (Leu) → `TAC` (Tyr)  
     - Fifth codon: `GGT` (Gly) → `ACT` (Thr)  
   - No stop codons introduced. The protein would have two amino acid substitutions but remain functional.  

### Conclusion:
The most effective way to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound is to disrupt the gene's function. Among the mutants, **Mutant 2** introduces a premature stop codon (`TAA`), which truncates the protein and likely renders it nonfunctional. This makes Mutant 2 the best candidate for eliminating the compound.
