Okay, so I've got this question about quantum field theory and Feynman diagrams. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question says that my colleague has a Feynman diagram and some scribbled terms next to it: alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. They're trying to figure out how many loops the diagram has based on this expression.

Wait, right, in quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram relates to the order of the process in perturbation theory. Each loop typically adds a factor that depends on the coupling constants and maybe some other terms. But how does that tie into the expression given?

I remember that the general form for the amplitude of a Feynman diagram involves factors from loops. Each loop contributes a factor of (something like 1/(16π²)) or so, depending on the theory. Also, each loop adds a power of the coupling constant or maybe a logarithm, but in this case, maybe it's about the overall scaling.

So the expression given is alpha^3 * g^2 * sqrt(2) * 8 * 1/(4pi)^6 * (Q/M)^2. Let me break it down.

Alpha is the fine-structure constant, which is e²/(4πε₀ħc) ≈ 1/137. G-squared, so g is probably a coupling constant, maybe from a non-Abelian gauge theory or something else. The 8 and 4pi terms must come from loop integrals and symmetry factors.

Wait, loop integrals in higher dimensions (like in 4D spacetime) give factors involving 1/(16π²) per loop, but since this is a higher-order term, maybe each loop contributes a certain number of these factors.

Let's count the exponents. The denominator is (4π)^6. Each loop would contribute a 4π factor, perhaps? Because each loop integral in 4D typically gives a 1/(16π²) factor. Wait, 16π² is (4π)^2, so each loop brings a 1/(4π)^2 factor. So if the denominator here is (4π)^6, that would imply three loops. Because 6 divided by 2 is 3. So three loops would give (4π)^6 in the denominator.

But wait, let me think again. Each loop contributes 1/(16π²) = 1/(4π)^2. So one loop gives 1/(4π)^2, two loops give 1/(4π)^4, three loops give 1/(4π)^6. That's exactly what we have here: 1/(4π)^6. So that suggests three loops.

Looking at the other factors: alpha^3 and g^2. Alpha is an electric charge coupling, and g would be another coupling, perhaps from a strong force or something else. The number of loops would be determined by the loop integrals' factors. So the 1/(4pi)^6 suggests three loops, since each loop adds two to the exponent in the denominator.

So the number of loops is 3. Looking at the options, D is 3.

The question involves determining the number of loops in a Feynman diagram based on the given expression: 

\[
\alpha^3 \cdot g^2 \cdot \sqrt{2} \cdot 8 \cdot \frac{1}{(4\pi)^6} \cdot \left(\frac{Q}{M}\right)^2
\]

In quantum field theory, the number of loops in a Feynman diagram is related to the factors involving loop integrals. Each loop typically contributes a factor of \( \frac{1}{(4\pi)^2} \) in 4-dimensional spacetime. For this expression, the denominator contains \( (4\pi)^6 \), which implies that three loops are present, since each loop contributes \( (4\pi)^2 \) to the denominator. This matches the structure of the given expression.

The other terms, such as \( \alpha^3 \), \( g^2 \), and \( \sqrt{2} \cdot 8 \), are related to coupling constants and symmetry factors but do not directly determine the number of loops. The key factor for the number of loops is the \( \frac{1}{(4\pi)^6} \), which corresponds to three loops.

Thus, the Feynman diagram contains **3 loops**.
