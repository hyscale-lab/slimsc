Okay, so I've got this problem here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to work through it.

The metric given is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). I think this is a 2-dimensional metric since there are only dx and dy terms. Wait, no, wait—actually, the metric usually involves time and space coordinates, but here it's in terms of x and y. Maybe it's a 2+1 dimensional space or just a 2D surface embedded somehow? Not sure, but maybe I don't need to worry about that right now.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Pseudosphere—oh right, that's a surface of constant negative curvature, like a tractricoid. The term 'pseudosphere' might be a bit confusing, but I remember that its area relates to hyperbolic geometry.

Wait, but how does this metric relate to a pseudosphere? Let me think. The general form for a metric in 2D can be written as ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²). In this case, g(x,y) is 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

So, the line element is a conformally flat metric, meaning it's scaled by a function of x and y. I recall that for surfaces of constant curvature, the metric can be written in terms of a function that depends on the radius. For a sphere, the metric would have terms like (1/(1 - (r²/R²))) or something similar. But for a pseudosphere, which is hyperbolic, the curvature is negative, so maybe the function behaves differently.

Wait, the pseudosphere's metric in polar coordinates is typically written as ds² = dr² + (a² / cosh²(r/a)) dθ², where a is the curvature radius. Or maybe in isothermal coordinates, which is what this metric might be. Alternatively, perhaps the given metric is in a different coordinate system.

Looking at the denominator (4 - x² - y²), that suggests that the coordinates x and y are constrained such that x² + y² < 4, because otherwise the denominator would be zero or negative, making the metric undefined or with imaginary values. So this space is only defined where x² + y² < 4. Wait, but 4 is (2)^2, so the radius r=2 is probably related to this.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Wait, but pseudospheres don't have a finite area. Or do they? No, I think in hyperbolic space, the area of a sphere (which is a pseudosphere in 2D, like a circle with imaginary radius) would have an infinite area. Wait, no, wait. In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle is 2π a² sinh(r/a), where r is the radius. So as r increases, the area grows exponentially. But if r is 2, and a is the curvature radius, which I think in this problem is 2.

Wait, but the metric given is in terms of (x, y) coordinates. Maybe I can compute the area using this metric.

The area in a 2D metric is computed by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor over the region. But since the metric is conformally flat, the determinant is just (32/(4 - x² - y²)) times (dx dy), so the area element would be [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy.

Wait, no: the determinant of a 2D metric is (g_xx * g_yy - g_xy^2). In this case, since off-diagonal terms are zero, it's g_xx * g_yy. And since here, g_xx = 32/(4 - x² - y²), same as g_yy. So determinant is (32/(4 - ...))^2. So the area element would be sqrt(det) dx dy, which is (32/(4 - ...)) dx dy.

Wait, no, the area element is sqrt(det) dx dy. But since the metric is diagonal, with g_xx = g_yy = g, the determinant is g², so sqrt is g. So yes, area element is (32 / (4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

So the total area would be the integral over all x and y where the metric is defined. But wait, the metric is defined only where 4 - x² - y² is positive, so x² + y² < 4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the (x, y) plane.

So the area integral is ∫∫ (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy over x² + y² <4.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let's switch to polar coordinates, since the integrand and the domain are radially symmetric.

So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, dx dy = r dr dθ.

The integral becomes ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32 / (4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this. First, factor out constants.

32 ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

The θ integral is straightforward: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So 32 * 2π ∫0^2 [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

So 64π ∫0^2 r/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me compute the integral ∫ r/(4 - r²) dr.

Let u = 4 - r², so du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = ∫ (-1/2) du/u.

Which is (-1/2) ln|u| + C.

So evaluating from 0 to 2:

At r=2: u=4-4=0.
At r=0: u=4.

Wait, but when r approaches 2, u approaches zero, which would make ln(u) go to negative infinity. So the integral from 0 to 2 is divergent. That would imply that the area is infinite.

Wait, that's a problem. So the area is infinite? But that doesn't make sense for a pseudosphere of finite radius. Or does it? Because in hyperbolic space, the area of a circle grows exponentially with radius. But in this case, the radius is 2, but our coordinates only go up to x² + y² =4, which is a finite distance.

Wait, but according to the integral, the area is ∫∫ (32/(4 - r²)) r dr dθ. When r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, making the integrand blow up. So the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite.

So the area is infinite. Looking back at the options, option D is +infty.

So the answer should be D.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional surface. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) implies that the metric is defined only where \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), corresponding to a disk of radius 2 in the \((x, y)\)-plane. The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\).

The area element for a conformally flat metric is given by \(\sqrt{\text{det}(g)} \, dx \, dy\), where \(\sqrt{\text{det}(g)} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\). Thus, the area is computed as:

\[
\text{Area} = \int \int \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the integral becomes:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\), so:

\[
\text{Area} = 64\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Let \(u = 4 - r^2\), so \(du = -2r \, dr\), and the integral becomes:

\[
\int \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \ln|u| + C.
\]

Evaluating from \(r = 0\) to \(r = 2\), \(u = 4 - r^2\) approaches 0 as \(r \to 2\), leading to \(\ln(u) \to -\infty\). This indicates that the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.

Okay, so I've got this problem here about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my general relativity, but let's try to work through it.

In hyperbolic geometry, the area of a circle is 2π a² sinh(r/a), where r is the radius. So as r increases, the area grows exponentially.

Wait, no, the area element is sqrt(det) dx dy. But since the metric is diagonal, with g_xx = g_yy = g, the determinant is g², so sqrt is g. So yes, area element is (32 / (4 - x² - y²)) dx dy.

So the total area would be the integral over all x and y where the metric is defined. But wait, the metric is defined only where 4 - x² - y² is positive, so x² + y² < 4. So the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the (x, y) plane.

So the area integral is ∫∫ (32/(4 - x² - y²)) dx dy over x² + y² <4.

Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let's switch to polar coordinates, since the integrand and the domain are radially symmetric.

So x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, dx dy = r dr dθ.

The integral becomes ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (from r=0 to 2) [32 / (4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

Let me compute this. First, factor out constants.

32 ∫0^{2π} dθ ∫0^2 [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

The θ integral is straightforward: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So 32 * 2π ∫0^2 [ r / (4 - r²) ] dr.

So 64π ∫0^2 r/(4 - r²) dr.

Let me compute the integral ∫ r/(4 - r²) dr.

Let u = 4 - r², so du/dr = -2r → (-1/2) du = r dr.

So the integral becomes ∫ (r dr)/(4 - r²) = ∫ (-1/2) du/u.

Which is (-1/2) ln|u| + C.

So evaluating from 0 to 2:

At r=2: u=4-4=0.
At r=0: u=4.

Wait, but when r approaches 2, u approaches zero, which would make ln(u) go to negative infinity. So the integral from 0 to 2 is divergent. That would imply that the area is infinite.

Wait, that's a problem. So the area is infinite? But that doesn't make sense for a pseudosphere of finite radius. Or does it? Because in hyperbolic space, the area of a circle grows exponentially with radius. But in this case, the radius is 2, but our coordinates only go up to x² + y² =4, which is a finite distance.

Wait, but according to the integral, the area is ∫∫ (32/(4 - r²)) r dr dθ. When r approaches 2, the denominator approaches zero, making the integrand blow up. So the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite.

So the area is infinite. Looking back at the options, option D is +infty.

So the answer should be D.


The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which describes a 2-dimensional surface. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) implies that the metric is defined only where \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), corresponding to a disk of radius 2 in the \((x, y)\)-plane. The question asks for the area of the pseudosphere of radius \(r = 2\).

The area element for a conformally flat metric is given by \(\sqrt{\text{det}(g)} \, dx \, dy\), where \(\sqrt{\text{det}(g)} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\). Thus, the area is computed as:

\[
\text{Area} = \int \int \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\(x = r \cos\theta\), \(y = r \sin\theta\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the integral becomes:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\), so:

\[
\text{Area} = 64\pi \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

Let \(u = 4 - r^2\), so \(du = -2r \, dr\), and the integral becomes:

\[
\int \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \ln|u| + C.
\]

Evaluating from \(r = 0\) to \(r = 2\), \(u = 4 - r^2\) approaches 0 as \(r \to 2\), leading to \(\ln(u) \to -\infty\). This indicates that the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite.

Thus, the area of the pseudosphere is infinite.
