Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem here. Let me read it again and understand what's going on.

So, the setup is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds. The Lorentz factor here is about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.

The question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls? The options are A) 54, B) 68, C) 40, D) 28.

Hmm. I think I need to figure out the relationship between the Lorentz factor and the distance the particles travel before decaying. The key here is probably the proper lifetime of the particle and how it dilates due to relativity.

So, first, let's think about how the distance a particle travels before decaying relates to the Lorentz factor. The particles are produced at the center of the detector, so the maximum distance they can travel is the radius, which is 30 meters. If a particle travels enough to reach the inner wall, that's 30 meters. If not, it decays before reaching.

The decay process is governed by the proper lifetime (tau) of the particle. In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

The time it takes for a particle to reach the detector wall is the distance divided by its speed. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately the speed of light, c. So the time is t = distance/speed = 30 m / c.

Wait, but since c is a big number, the time is very small. But the particle's lifetime is gamma * tau. So the probability that the particle doesn't decay before reaching the wall is given by the exponential decay formula. The probability P that the particle hasn't decayed after time t is P = exp(-t/(gamma*tau)).

Wait, no, actually, the decay follows an exponential probability. The probability that the particle decays before time t is 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)). So the survival probability is exp(-t/(gamma tau)), which is the probability that the particle hasn't decayed yet and thus can reach the detector wall.

In the initial case, the Lorentz factor is gamma1 = 20. One third of the particles reach the wall. So the survival probability P1 is 1/3. Therefore, 1/3 = exp(-t/(gamma1 tau)).

But wait, t is the time it takes to reach the wall, which is 30m / c. Let me write that as t = 30 / (3e8) seconds. Wait, but I can keep it symbolic for now.

So, P1 = exp(-t/(gamma1 tau)) = 1/3.

We can take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(1/3) = -t/(gamma1 tau).

Which gives us t/(gamma1 tau) = ln(3). Because ln(1/3) is negative, and multiplying both sides by -1 gives t/(gamma1 tau) = ln(3).

So, t = gamma1 tau ln(3) → Wait, wait, that's not right. Let's be precise.

Wait, ln(1/3) is -ln(3), so:

-t/(gamma1 tau) = ln(1/3) → t/(gamma1 tau) = ln(3).

So, t = gamma1 tau * ln(3).

Wait, no, let me correct that.

From P = exp(-t/(gamma tau)) = 1/3,

Take ln: -t/(gamma tau) = ln(1/3) = -ln(3).

Multiply both sides by -1: t/(gamma tau) = ln(3).

So, t = gamma tau ln(3).

Wait, that's correct.

So from the first scenario, we have t = gamma1 tau ln(3).

But wait, in the first scenario, the Lorentz factor is 20, and the survival probability is 1/3. So t = 20 tau ln(3).

But wait, t is the time it takes to reach the detector wall, which is fixed for a given detector radius. So t is the same in both scenarios. Because the detector radius is 30 meters, so the time to reach the wall is fixed as 30/c.

Wait, but wait, no. The time t is 30/c, which is the same for all particles, right? Because the radius is fixed, so the time it takes to reach the wall is the same, regardless of gamma. So gamma changes, but t is fixed.

Wait, but in the first scenario, with gamma1 = 20, the survival probability is 1/3. So t = (gamma1 tau) * ln(3) → t=20 tau ln(3).

But in the second scenario, when we are to find gamma2, the survival probability P2 is 2/3. So 2/3 = exp(-t/(gamma2 tau)).

Taking natural logs: ln(2/3) = -t/(gamma2 tau).

Multiply both sides by -1: -ln(2/3) = t/(gamma2 tau).

Which is ln(3/2) = t/(gamma2 tau).

So from the first scenario, t is 20 tau ln(3), from the equation t=20 tau ln(3).

In the second scenario, t is gamma2 tau ln(3/2).

Wait, no, because from the second scenario's equation: t = gamma2 tau * ln(3/2).

Wait, no. Let me write again.

In the first case:

t = gamma1 tau ln(3) → because t = gamma1 tau ln(3). Because earlier, t = gamma tau ln(3), right?

In the second case, t = gamma2 tau * ln(3/2).

But wait, no, the equation is t = gamma tau * ln(3) for the first case, and t = gamma tau * ln(3/2) for the second case. But that can't be, because t is the same in both cases.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because t is the same. So let's think again.

Wait, t is a fixed value because it's the time it takes to reach the detector wall. So t = 30 m / c.

So, for the first scenario, when gamma is 20, we have:

t = (gamma1 tau) * ln(3) → because P1 = exp(-t/(gamma tau)) = 1/3 → so t/(gamma tau) = ln(3) → t = gamma tau ln(3).

Similarly, for the second scenario, when gamma is gamma2, and we want P2 = 2/3.

So for the second case:

2/3 = exp(-t/(gamma2 tau)) → ln(2/3) = -t/(gamma2 tau) → t/(gamma2 tau) = ln(3/2).

So t = gamma2 tau ln(3/2).

But t is the same in both scenarios because the detector radius hasn't changed. So from the first case t = gamma1 tau ln(3) and second t = gamma2 tau ln(3/2).

So set them equal:

gamma1 tau ln(3) = gamma2 tau ln(3/2).

The tau cancels out.

So gamma1 ln(3) = gamma2 ln(3/2).

We can solve for gamma2:

gamma2 = gamma1 * ln(3) / ln(3/2).

We know gamma1 is 20, so gamma2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2).

Let me compute that.

First, compute ln(3) and ln(3/2).

ln(3) ≈ 1.0986

ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055

So gamma2 ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055.

Let me calculate that.

First, 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.707.

Then, 20 * 2.707 ≈ 54.14.

Looking at the options, option A is 54, which is close.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 2.707 * 20 is 54.14, yes. So approximately 54. So option A is 54.

But wait, let me think again. Because in the problem statement, 1/3 reach the wall. So the survival probability is 1/3. So when gamma is 20, P is 1/3.

Wait, but when we increase gamma, how does P change? Because P is exp( -t/(gamma tau) ).

If gamma increases, t/(gamma tau) decreases, so the exponent becomes less negative, so P increases. So higher gamma means higher survival probability.

In the first case, gamma1=20 → P=1/3.

We want gamma2 such that P=2/3, which is higher. So gamma2 should be higher than 20. So the options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Wait, but in my calculation, I found that gamma2 is about 54, which is option A. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the probabilities.

Wait, when gamma increases, the exponent t/(gamma tau) decreases, so the argument of exp is smaller, making exp(-x) larger. So for higher gamma, the survival probability increases.

So to get from 1/3 to 2/3, we need a higher gamma.

So my calculation gives gamma2 ≈54.

So the answer is A)54.

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor, the particle's lifetime, and the probability of survival.

The survival probability \( P \) of a particle reaching the detector wall is given by:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}\right),
\]

where:
- \( t \) is the time it takes for the particle to reach the detector wall,
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

The time \( t \) is fixed and determined by the detector's radius \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \) and the speed of light \( c \), so:

\[
t = \frac{R}{c}.
\]

### First Scenario:
For \( \gamma_1 = 20 \), the survival probability is \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} \). Substituting into the survival probability formula:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma_1 \tau}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma_1 \tau}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{t}{\gamma_1 \tau} = \ln(3).
\]

Thus:

\[
t = \gamma_1 \tau \ln(3).
\]

### Second Scenario:
For \( \gamma_2 \), the survival probability is \( P_2 = \frac{2}{3} \). Substituting into the survival probability formula:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma_2 \tau}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma_2 \tau}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{t}{\gamma_2 \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

Thus:

\[
t = \gamma_2 \tau \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

### Relating the Two Scenarios:
Since \( t \) is the same in both scenarios, we equate the two expressions for \( t \):

\[
\gamma_1 \tau \ln(3) = \gamma_2 \tau \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

Canceling \( \tau \) and solving for \( \gamma_2 \):

\[
\gamma_2 = \gamma_1 \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

### Numerical Calculation:
Using approximate values:
- \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \),
- \( \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \),

we calculate:

\[
\gamma_2 = 20 \cdot \frac{1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 20 \cdot 2.707 \approx 54.14.
\]

Thus, \( \gamma_2 \approx 54 \), which corresponds to option **A**.

### Final Answer:
The Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls is approximately **54**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem here. Let me read it again and understand what's going on.

So, the setup is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds. The Lorentz factor here is about 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters.

The question is, what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls? The options are A) 54, B) 68, C) 40, D) 28.

Hmm. I think I need to figure out the relationship between the Lorentz factor and the distance the particles travel before decaying. The key here is probably the proper lifetime of the particle and how it dilates due to relativity.

So, first, let's think about how the distance a particle travels before decaying relates to the Lorentz factor. The particles are produced at the center of the detector, so the maximum distance they can travel is the radius, which is 30 meters. If a particle travels enough to reach the inner wall, that's 30 meters. If not, it decays before reaching.

The decay process is governed by the proper lifetime (tau) of the particle. In the lab frame, the lifetime is gamma multiplied by tau, where gamma is the Lorentz factor. So the lifetime in the lab frame is gamma * tau.

The time it takes for a particle to reach the detector wall is the distance divided by its speed. Since the particles are ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately the speed of light, c. So the time is t = distance/speed = 30 m / c.

Wait, but since c is a big number, the time is very small. But the particle's lifetime is gamma * tau. So the probability that the particle doesn't decay before reaching the wall is given by the exponential decay formula. The probability P that the particle hasn't decayed after time t is P = exp(-t/(gamma*tau)).

Wait, no, actually, the decay follows an exponential probability. The probability that the particle decays before time t is 1 - exp(-t/(gamma tau)). So the survival probability is exp(-t/(gamma tau)), which is the probability that the particle hasn't decayed yet and thus can reach the detector wall.

In the initial case, the Lorentz factor is gamma1 = 20. One third of the particles reach the wall. So the survival probability P1 is 1/3. Therefore, 1/3 = exp(-t/(gamma1 tau)).

But wait, t is the time it takes to reach the wall, which is 30m / c. Let me write that as t = 30 / (3e8) seconds. Wait, but I can keep it symbolic for now.

So, P1 = exp(-t/(gamma1 tau)) = 1/3.

We can take the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(1/3) = -t/(gamma1 tau).

Which gives us t/(gamma1 tau) = ln(3). Because ln(1/3) is negative, and multiplying both sides by -1 gives t/(gamma1 tau) = ln(3).

So, t = gamma1 tau ln(3) → Wait, wait, that's not right. Let's be precise.

Wait, ln(1/3) is -ln(3), so:

-t/(gamma1 tau) = ln(1/3) → t/(gamma1 tau) = ln(3).

So, t = gamma1 tau * ln(3).

Wait, no, let me correct that.

From P = exp(-t/(gamma tau)) = 1/3,

Take ln: -t/(gamma tau) = ln(1/3) = -ln(3).

Multiply both sides by -1: t/(gamma tau) = ln(3).

So, t = gamma tau ln(3).

Wait, that's correct.

So from the first scenario, we have t = gamma1 tau ln(3).

But wait, in the first scenario, the Lorentz factor is 20, and the survival probability is 1/3. So t = 20 tau ln(3).

But wait, t is the time it takes to reach the detector wall, which is fixed for a given detector radius. So t is the same in both scenarios. Because the detector radius is 30 meters, so the time to reach the wall is fixed as 30/c.

Wait, but wait, no. The time t is 30/c, which is the same for all particles, right? Because the radius is fixed, so the time it takes to reach the wall is the same, regardless of gamma. So gamma changes, but t is fixed.

Wait, but in the first scenario, with gamma1 = 20, the survival probability is 1/3. So t = (gamma1 tau) * ln(3) → t=20 tau ln(3).

But in the second scenario, when we are to find gamma2, the survival probability P2 is 2/3. So 2/3 = exp(-t/(gamma2 tau)).

Taking natural logs: ln(2/3) = -t/(gamma2 tau).

Multiply both sides by -1: -ln(2/3) = t/(gamma2 tau).

Which is ln(3/2) = t/(gamma2 tau).

So from the first scenario, t is 20 tau ln(3), from the equation t=20 tau ln(3).

In the second scenario, t is gamma2 tau ln(3/2).

Wait, no, because from the second scenario's equation: t = gamma2 tau * ln(3/2).

Wait, no. Let me write again.

In the first case:

t = gamma1 tau ln(3) → because t = gamma1 tau ln(3). Because earlier, t = gamma tau ln(3), right?

In the second case, t = gamma2 tau * ln(3/2).

But wait, no, the equation is t = gamma tau * ln(3) for the first case, and t = gamma tau * ln(3/2) for the second case. But that can't be, because t is the same in both cases.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because t is the same. So let's think again.

Wait, t is a fixed value because it's the time it takes to reach the detector wall. So t = 30 m / c.

So, for the first scenario, when gamma is 20, we have:

t = (gamma1 tau) * ln(3) → because P1 = exp(-t/(gamma tau)) = 1/3 → so t/(gamma tau) = ln(3) → t = gamma tau ln(3).

Similarly, for the second scenario, when gamma is gamma2, and we want P2 = 2/3.

So for the second case:

2/3 = exp(-t/(gamma2 tau)) → ln(2/3) = -t/(gamma2 tau) → t/(gamma2 tau) = ln(3/2).

So t = gamma2 tau ln(3/2).

But t is the same in both scenarios because the detector radius hasn't changed. So from the first case t = gamma1 tau ln(3) and second t = gamma2 tau ln(3/2).

So set them equal:

gamma1 tau ln(3) = gamma2 tau ln(3/2).

The tau cancels out.

So gamma1 ln(3) = gamma2 ln(3/2).

We can solve for gamma2:

gamma2 = gamma1 * ln(3) / ln(3/2).

We know gamma1 is 20, so gamma2 = 20 * ln(3) / ln(3/2).

Let me compute that.

First, compute ln(3) and ln(3/2).

ln(3) ≈ 1.0986

ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055

So gamma2 ≈ 20 * 1.0986 / 0.4055.

Let me calculate that.

First, 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.707.

Then, 20 * 2.707 ≈ 54.14.

Looking at the options, option A is 54, which is close.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 2.707 * 20 is 54.14, yes. So approximately 54. So option A is 54.

But wait, let me think again. Because in the problem statement, 1/3 reach the wall. So the survival probability is 1/3. So when gamma is 20, P is 1/3.

Wait, but when we increase gamma, how does P change? Because P is exp( -t/(gamma tau) ).

If gamma increases, t/(gamma tau) decreases, so the exponent becomes less negative, so P increases. So higher gamma means higher survival probability.

In the first case, gamma1=20 → P=1/3.

We want gamma2 such that P=2/3, which is higher. So gamma2 should be higher than 20. So the options are A)54, B)68, C)40, D)28.

Wait, but in my calculation, I found that gamma2 is about 54, which is option A. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the probabilities.

Wait, when gamma increases, the exponent t/(gamma tau) decreases, so the argument of exp is smaller, making exp(-x) larger. So for higher gamma, the survival probability increases.

So to get from 1/3 to 2/3, we need a higher gamma.

So my calculation gives gamma2 ≈54.

So the answer is A)54.


To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the Lorentz factor, the particle's lifetime, and the probability of survival.

The survival probability \( P \) of a particle reaching the detector wall is given by:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma \tau}\right),
\]

where:
- \( t \) is the time it takes for the particle to reach the detector wall,
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

The time \( t \) is fixed and determined by the detector's radius \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \) and the speed of light \( c \), so:

\[
t = \frac{R}{c}.
\]

### First Scenario:
For \( \gamma_1 = 20 \), the survival probability is \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} \). Substituting into the survival probability formula:

\[
\frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma_1 \tau}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma_1 \tau}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{t}{\gamma_1 \tau} = \ln(3).
\]

Thus:

\[
t = \gamma_1 \tau \ln(3).
\]

### Second Scenario:
For \( \gamma_2 \), the survival probability is \( P_2 = \frac{2}{3} \). Substituting into the survival probability formula:

\[
\frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{t}{\gamma_2 \tau}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{t}{\gamma_2 \tau}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{t}{\gamma_2 \tau} = \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

Thus:

\[
t = \gamma_2 \tau \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

### Relating the Two Scenarios:
Since \( t \) is the same in both scenarios, we equate the two expressions for \( t \):

\[
\gamma_1 \tau \ln(3) = \gamma_2 \tau \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right).
\]

Canceling \( \tau \) and solving for \( \gamma_2 \):

\[
\gamma_2 = \gamma_1 \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)}.
\]

### Numerical Calculation:
Using approximate values:
- \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \),
- \( \ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right) \approx 0.4055 \),

we calculate:

\[
\gamma_2 = 20 \cdot \frac{1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 20 \cdot 2.707 \approx 54.14.
\]

Thus, \( \gamma_2 \approx 54 \), which corresponds to option **A**.

### Final Answer:
The Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls is approximately **54**.

Answer: A
