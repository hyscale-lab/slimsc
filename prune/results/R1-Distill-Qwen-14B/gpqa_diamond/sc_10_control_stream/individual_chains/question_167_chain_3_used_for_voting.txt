Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. So, phi is the phase, and alpha is the amplitude. The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha²)). 

Wait, the question gives phi as -pi/4 and alpha as 0.5. So first, I need to plug these values into N.

Let me compute sin(2*phi) first. 2*phi is 2*(-pi/4) = -pi/2. The sine of -pi/2 is -1. So sin(2*phi) is -1.

Now, exp(-2*alpha²) with alpha=0.5. Alpha squared is 0.25, multiplied by 2 is 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. 

So N squared is 1 + (-1)*(0.6065) = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935). Let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(0.3935) is around 0.6275.

Wait, but actually, the state is normalized because N is the normalization factor. So the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|, right? Because for a pure state, the density matrix is just the outer product.

The reference state is a Gaussian state, so the density matrix tau would be that of a Gaussian state. But wait, what's a Gaussian state in this context? I think Gaussian states are those whose Wigner functions are Gaussian distributions, like coherent states, squeezed states, thermal states, etc. Here, the given state is a superposition of two coherent states, which makes it a non-Gaussian state. So the reference tau would be the closest Gaussian state to psi, perhaps a coherent state or something else.

But wait, the relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Oh wait, that looks like the relative entropy between rho and tau. Because the von Neumann entropy S(rho) is trace(rho ln rho), so del_b would be S(rho) - S(tau). So to compute del_b, I need to find the entropy of rho and the entropy of the reference Gaussian state tau, then subtract.

But wait, wait. The relative entropy measure is usually defined as S(rho || tau) = trace(rho (ln rho - ln tau)), which is S(rho) - S(tau) only if rho and tau are compatible in some way. Hmm, but the question defines it as del_b = [S(rho) - S(tau)]. So perhaps I'm correct.

But wait, what's the reference Gaussian state tau here? The problem says it's the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. Or perhaps the closest Gaussian state? Hmm, I'm not exactly sure. Oh wait, maybe it's the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as the non-Gaussian state. Because then the relative entropy would measure how non-Gaussian the state is.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the same as the state if it were Gaussian. Wait, but the given state is a superposition of two coherent states, which is not Gaussian. So the reference tau could be the state that is the mixture of the two coherent states, each weighted by |cos(phi)|^2 and |sin(phi)|^2, respectively.

Wait, no, because for a Gaussian state, the density matrix would be a Gaussian, which might be a thermal state or a squeezed state, but perhaps in this case, the reference is the maximum entropy Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the closest Gaussian state to rho. But I'm not exactly sure. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, the problem states that the relative entropy is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So I need to compute S(rho) minus S(tau), where tau is the reference Gaussian state.

But how do I find tau? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting me to not calculate tau's entropy, but perhaps to note that if the state is Gaussian, then del_b would be zero. But wait, the given state is a Schrödinger cat state, which is non-Gaussian. So if phi is such that the state is Gaussian, then del_b would be zero. But in this case, phi is -pi/4, which is not zero or pi/2, so the state is a superposition, hence non-Gaussian. So del_b would not be zero. But wait, looking at the options, option D is zero, but the others are non-zero.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the state is Gaussian for certain parameters. For example, if phi is 0 or pi/2, then the state becomes a single coherent state, which is Gaussian. Because if phi is 0, the state is |alpha>, which is Gaussian. Similarly, phi = pi/2, the state is |-alpha>, also Gaussian. But if phi is something else, like -pi/4, then it's a superposition, making it non-Gaussian.

So, for phi = -pi/4, the state is non-Gaussian, so del_b should be positive. So the answer can't be D) 0.

Wait, but the question is to calculate nG using the relative entropy measure. So perhaps the Gaussian reference state tau is the mixture of the two pure Gaussian states |alpha> and |-alpha>, each with weight |cos(phi)|^2 and |sin(phi)|^2. Because that would be the closest Gaussian state to the non-Gaussian state, perhaps.

Wait, but a superposition state is not the same as a mixed state of the two coherent states. So the reference Gaussian state tau would be the mixed state with density matrix tau = |cos(phi)|^2 |alpha><alpha| + |sin(phi)|^2 |-alpha><-alpha|.

In that case, the entropy of rho is the entropy of the pure state |psi><psi|, which is zero because it's a pure state. Wait, no, because rho is |psi><psi|, which is a pure state, so its entropy is zero. But wait, no. If rho is a pure state, its entropy is zero. But if tau is a mixed state, its entropy would be higher. So then S(rho) is zero, and S(tau) is the entropy of that mixed state.

Wait, but wait! That can't be right because the relative entropy would become negative, which doesn't make sense for relative entropy. Because relative entropy is always non-negative.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The state rho is a pure state, so its entropy S(rho) is zero. The reference state tau is a mixed Gaussian state, so its entropy S(tau) is positive. Then del_b = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But relative entropy is usually S(rho||tau) = S(rho) - S(tau) + ... wait, maybe I'm mixing up the definitions.

Wait, the relative entropy between rho and tau is S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). But in the question, the measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], which is S(rho) - S(tau). So it's not the standard relative entropy, but some other measure.

So if rho is pure, S(rho) is zero. Then del_b = - S(tau). But that would be negative, but the question is about the non-Gaussianity, which should be a positive number. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the reference state tau is not a mixed state but the same state as rho, but treated as a Gaussian. Wait, no, because rho is non-Gaussian. Alternatively, perhaps tau is the Gaussian state that is closest to rho in some sense, like the one with the same first and second moments.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the one that has the same mean (alpha, in phase space) and the same variance as the state rho. But since rho is a superposition, its first moment might be zero. Because the expectation value of position and momentum might be zero.

Wait, let me compute the expectation value of the position operator x for the state |psi>. The coherent state |alpha> has expectation value x = 2 Re(alpha), assuming x is proportional to (a + a†), so if alpha is real, x would be 2 alpha. Wait, but in this case, alpha is given as 0.5, so real. So |alpha> has x=1, and |-alpha> has x=-1.

So when phi is -pi/4, cos(phi) = cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Similarly, sin(phi) is sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. Wait, but in the state |psi>, it's cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>, which for phi = -pi/4 would be [cos(pi/4)|alpha> + sin(pi/4)|-alpha> ] / N. Since cos(pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2, and sin(pi/4) is same. So the state becomes [sqrt(2)/2 |alpha> - sqrt(2)/2 |-alpha> ] / N.

So the expectation value of x for rho would be (sqrt(2)/2)^2 (alpha + (-alpha)) * 2? Wait, no. Let me think again. The expectation value of x in a superposition is the sum of the expectation values of each term, weighted by the square of the coefficients.

Wait, no, expectation value is (psi| x |psi). But for each term, |alpha> and |-alpha>, the expectation of x is alpha and -alpha, respectively. So the expectation for x in rho is [ |cos(phi)|^2 * alpha + |sin(phi)|^2 * (-alpha) ] + [ cross terms ].

Wait, the cross terms involve the overlap between |alpha> and |-alpha>. The overlap is exp(-|alpha - (-alpha)|²/2) = exp(- (2 alpha)^2 / 2) = exp(- 2 alpha²). So the cross terms are 2 Re [ cos(phi) sin(phi) * <alpha| -alpha> ].

So the expectation value <x> = [ |cos(phi)|^2 * alpha + |sin(phi)|^2 * (-alpha) ) ] + 2 Re [ cos(phi) sin(phi) * <alpha| -alpha> * (something) ].

Wait, but x is proportional to (a + a†), so the expectation value <x> would be 2 Re( alpha cos^2(phi) - alpha sin^2(phi) + ... )? Hmm, perhaps it's getting complicated. But in any case, for the state |psi>, the expectation value of x might be zero because the state is a symmetric combination of |alpha> and |-alpha>, especially when phi is -pi/4.

Wait, let me compute it for phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5. cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2.

So, <x> = [ (sqrt(2)/2)^2 * alpha + ( (-sqrt(2)/2)^2 ) * (-alpha) ) ] + cross terms.

Wait, (sqrt(2)/2)^2 is 0.5, same for the other term. So first part is 0.5 * alpha + 0.5 * (-alpha) = 0.

As for the cross terms: cos(phi) sin(phi) is (sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2)/2) )= -0.5. So the cross terms are 2 Re [ (-0.5) * <alpha| -alpha> ].

What is <alpha| -alpha> ? It's e^{-|alpha + alpha|^2/2} = e^{- (2 alpha)^2 / 2} = e^{-2 alpha^2}.

So for alpha=0.5, 2 alpha^2 is 0.5, so e^{-0.5} ≈ 0.6065.

So the cross terms are 2 Re [ (-0.5) * 0.6065 ] = 2 * [ (-0.5 * 0.6065) ] = 2 * (-0.30325) = -0.6065.

But wait, the cross terms in the density matrix contribute to the expectation value, but I'm not sure if I'm calculating it correctly. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> for phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5 is an even state, which would have zero first moments. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is a thermal state with the same first and second moments as rho. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference is a squeezed vacuum state or a coherent state. But I'm not sure how to proceed.

Wait, the problem gives the specific form of the state, and the question is to find the non-Gaussianity. Maybe in this specific case, the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is Gaussian? No, that can't be. Because the state is a superposition of two coherent states, which is non-Gaussian.

Wait, but wait, the density matrix of a coherent state is Gaussian, but a superposition state like a Schrödinger cat is non-Gaussian. So the rho is non-Gaussian, and tau is the Gaussian state.

But how do I compute S(tau)?

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the maximum entropy Gaussian with the same first and second moments as rho. But to find that, I'd need to compute the first and second moments of rho.

Alternatively, perhaps for the given parameters, the state becomes Gaussian, leading to del_b being zero. But for phi=-pi/4, it's a superposition, so not Gaussian.

Wait, let me think about the case when phi=0: the state is |alpha>, which is Gaussian. So del_b would be zero because rho and tau are the same. But in our case, phi is -pi/4, so the state is non-Gaussian, so del_b should be positive.

Wait, the options are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C) 1.38, D) 0.

But if the state is non-Gaussian, del_b should be positive, so D) is probably incorrect.

Wait, but another approach: the non-Gaussianity measure using relative entropy compares the entropy of the non-Gaussian state to the closest Gaussian state. If the non-Gaussian state is a pure state, its entropy is zero. The reference Gaussian state would have a positive entropy. Wait, but then del_b would be negative. But that can't be, because non-Gaussianity is a positive measure.

Alternatively, perhaps the measure is defined as the relative entropy between the Gaussian state and the non-Gaussian state. So del_b = S(tau) - S(rho). If rho is pure, S(rho)=0, so del_b equals S(tau). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for non-Gaussianity is S(rho) - S(tau), but if rho is pure, S(rho) is zero, so del_b equals negative S(tau), which would be negative, but that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the relative entropy measure is defined as S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln rho - rho ln tau), which is equal to S(rho) - S(rho, tau), where S(rho, tau) is the mutual entropy. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula given is actually S(rho) - S(tau), which would be the relative entropy of rho with respect to tau. But if rho is non-Gaussian and tau is the reference Gaussian, then for a pure rho, S(rho) is zero, and tau is a mixed Gaussian state, so S(tau) is positive. So del_b = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau), which is negative, but since relative entropy is always non-negative, this approach must be wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question uses a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the state is actually Gaussian for the given phi and alpha. Let me check.

The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions are non-Gaussian. So unless phi is 0 or pi/2, the state is non-Gaussian.

In our case, phi is -pi/4, which is neither 0 nor pi/2. So the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be positive.

Wait, but the options don't have any negative values. So perhaps the measure is the other way around: S(tau) - S(rho), which would be positive.

Wait, if rho is non-Gaussian (so pure, S(rho)=0), and tau is a Gaussian, which could be a mixed state with some entropy S(tau), then del_b = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But that would be negative, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm mixing up the terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is [trace(tau ln tau) - trace(rho ln rho)], which would be S(tau) - S(rho). So del_b would be S(tau) - S(rho). If rho is pure, S(rho)=0, so del_b = S(tau).

But then, how do I find S(tau)? Because tau is the reference Gaussian state.

But I'm getting stuck on finding tau. Alternatively, perhaps for the given parameters, the state is Gaussian, so del_b is zero.

Wait, let me re-check: when phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5, is the state Gaussian?

No, because a Gaussian state is one that can be written as a displaced squeezed vacuum state. The given state is a superposition of two coherent states, which is a non-Gaussian state.

So del_b should be positive, so options A, B, or C.

But without knowing the exact form of tau, it's hard to compute. Maybe the problem is expecting me to recognize that the state is Gaussian, leading to del_b=0. But that's not the case here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps when the state is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases, and phi is -pi/4, the state might have certain symmetries that make it a squeezed state, which is Gaussian. Wait, is that possible?

Wait, a squeezed state isn't a superposition of coherent states. Squeezed states are Gaussian, yes, but they are generated by squeezing operators acting on coherent states. So a superposition state is not a squeezed state.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the density matrix rho and see if it's Gaussian. But that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is Gaussian. But I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: perhaps for phi = -pi/4, the state |psi> can be written as a product of two coherent states. But no, it's a single superposition.

Wait, let me compute N first. With phi=-pi/4, sin(2*phi) is sin(-pi/2) = -1. So N^2 = 1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = 1 - exp(-0.5).

exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065, so N^2 = 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935, so N ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state |psi> is [ (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

The reference state tau is a Gaussian state. Since rho is a pure non-Gaussian state, the relative entropy would measure how different rho is from the closest Gaussian state.

But without more information on how to compute tau, perhaps the question is trying to trick me into thinking that for certain parameters, the state is Gaussian, leading to del_b=0.

Wait, another angle: the non-Gaussianity measure is the relative entropy between rho and the closest Gaussian state tau. For a Gaussian state, this would be zero. But if the state is non-Gaussian, it's positive.

But in our case, the state is non-Gaussian, so del_b should be positive. So D) 0 is not the answer. So the options must be A, B, or C.

But how to compute it?

Wait, another approach: since the state is a two-term superposition, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the mixture of the two coherent states, each with probability |cos(phi)|^2 and |sin(phi)|^2. So tau would be |cos(phi)|^2 |alpha><alpha| + |sin(phi)|^2 |-alpha><-alpha|.

In that case, the density matrix of tau is a classical mixture of two coherent states. The entropy of tau would be S(tau) = - p ln p - q ln q, where p=|cos(phi)|^2 and q=|sin(phi)|^2.

In this case, phi is -pi/4, so |cos(phi)|^2 = 0.5, same for |sin(phi)|^2. So tau is a completely mixed state with p=q=0.5.

So the entropy S(tau) is -0.5 ln 0.5 - 0.5 ln 0.5 = 1.

But wait, in that case, the state rho is pure (as it's a single state), so S(rho)=0. Then del_b = S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - 1 = -1, which doesn't make sense because relative entropy should be positive. So perhaps the question uses S(tau) - S(rho), which would be 1 - 0 = 1. So del_b is 1.

But the options don't include 1. The closest is option C) 1.38.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me check the actual formula.

Wait, the relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So if rho is pure, its trace(rho ln rho) is zero. Tau is the reference Gaussian, which in this case is a mixed state with S(tau)=1. So del_b = 0 - (1) = -1. But that would mean del_b is negative, which isn't possible for relative entropy. So perhaps I'm still getting something wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln(rho/tau)). That would be S(rho) - S(tau) + ... Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is defined as S(rho) - S(tau), but only when rho is non-Gaussian. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reference Gaussian state is a coherent state with the same expectation value as rho. But earlier, we thought that the expectation value <x> might be zero.

If rho has <x> = 0, then the reference coherent state would be the vacuum state, |0>. The entropy of |0> is zero because it's pure. So del_b would be S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - 0 = 0. But that would mean the non-Gaussianity is zero, which contradicts the state being non-Gaussian.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe the correct approach is to realize that the state is Gaussian when phi is 0 or pi/2, but for other phi values, it's non-Gaussian. So for phi=-pi/4, it's non-Gaussian, so del_b is non-zero.

Wait, but the question gives specific numbers. N= sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)).

With phi=-pi/4, sin(2 phi)= sin(-pi/2)= -1. So N^2=1 - exp(-2*(0.5)^2)=1 - exp(-0.5)= approx 0.3935, so N= sqrt(0.3935)=approx 0.6275.

But perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is actually Gaussian. How? Let me think: perhaps the state can be written as a Gaussian state for some parameters.

Wait, another idea: perhaps when phi = -pi/4, the state |psi> is a squeezed vacuum state, which is Gaussian. But I don't think so because a squeezed vacuum state is |0, r>, which doesn't look like a superposition of two coherent states.

Alternatively, maybe the state |psi> is a coherent state for some other parameter. But I don't think so. Coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator, and a superposition of two coherent states with parameters alpha and -alpha would not be a coherent state unless phi is 0 or pi/2.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the Wigner function of the state and see if it's Gaussian. The Wigner function of a coherent state is Gaussian, but for a superposition state, it's not. So for phi=-pi/4, the state is non-Gaussian, so del_b is positive.

But without knowing the exact calculation method, I'm not sure how to proceed. Maybe the answer is option C) 1.38, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B) 0.25, but I can't be sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of photons. The state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which are coherent states with a certain photon number distribution. The non-Gaussianity could be related to the photon number distribution. But I'm not familiar enough with the exact calculations to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is actually Gaussian. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, wait! Another thought: perhaps when phi is such that cos(phi) + sin(phi) is zero, the state becomes a single coherent state. But with phi = -pi/4, cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2. So cos(phi) + sin(phi) = 0. Hence, the state |psi> is [ (sqrt(2)/2)|alpha> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-alpha> ] / N. Hmm, but that's a superposition, not a single coherent state.

Alternatively, perhaps if alpha is zero, the state is a superposition of |0> and |0>, so it's just |0>, which is Gaussian. But alpha is 0.5, so that's not the case.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think I'll just have to make an educated guess. Since the state is a non-Gaussian state, del_b is non-zero. The options are A)2.48, B)0.25, C)1.38, D)0.

If the reference Gaussian state's entropy is 1, then del_b could be 1, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C)1.38.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \( \phi \) is the phase, \( \alpha \) is the amplitude, and \( N \) is the normalization constant given by:

\[
N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi) \exp(-2\alpha^2)}.
\]

The relative entropy measure is defined as:

\[
\text{del}_b = \text{trace}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{trace}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \( \rho \) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and \( \tau \) is the density matrix of the reference Gaussian state.

### Key Observations:
1. **Gaussian vs. Non-Gaussian States**: Gaussian states include coherent states, squeezed states, and thermal states. A Schrödinger cat state, being a superposition of two coherent states, is non-Gaussian unless the superposition reduces to a single coherent state (e.g., when \( \phi = 0 \) or \( \phi = \pi/2 \)).

2. **Parameters**: For \( \phi = -\pi/4 \) and \( \alpha = 0.5 \), the state is a superposition of \( |\alpha\rangle \) and \( |-\alpha\rangle \), making it non-Gaussian. Thus, \( \text{del}_b \) should be positive.

3. **Reference Gaussian State**: The reference Gaussian state \( \tau \) is likely the closest Gaussian state to \( \rho \), such as a mixture of the two coherent states \( |\alpha\rangle \) and \( |-\alpha\rangle \), weighted by \( |\cos(\phi)|^2 \) and \( |\sin(\phi)|^2 \), respectively. For \( \phi = -\pi/4 \), these weights are both \( 0.5 \), making \( \tau \) a maximally mixed state.

4. **Entropy Calculations**:
   - The entropy of \( \rho \), \( S(\rho) \), is zero because \( \rho \) is a pure state (a single quantum state).
   - The entropy of \( \tau \), \( S(\tau) \), for a maximally mixed state is \( 1 \) (in natural logarithm units).

5. **Relative Entropy**: Using the formula \( \text{del}_b = S(\rho) - S(\tau) \), we find \( \text{del}_b = 0 - 1 = -1 \). However, this result is negative, which is unphysical for relative entropy. This suggests the formula might instead be \( \text{del}_b = S(\tau) - S(\rho) \), giving \( \text{del}_b = 1 \). Since \( 1 \) is not an option, the closest match is \( 1.38 \), likely accounting for additional factors in the calculation.

### Conclusion:
The state is non-Gaussian, and the relative entropy measure \( \text{del}_b \) is positive. Based on the reasoning and the provided options, the most plausible answer is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. So, phi is the phase, and alpha is the amplitude. The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha²)). 

Wait, the question gives phi as -pi/4 and alpha as 0.5. So first, I need to plug these values into N.

Let me compute sin(2*phi) first. 2*phi is 2*(-pi/4) = -pi/2. The sine of -pi/2 is -1. So sin(2*phi) is -1.

Now, exp(-2*alpha²) with alpha=0.5. Alpha squared is 0.25, multiplied by 2 is 0.5. So exp(-0.5) is approximately 0.6065. 

So N squared is 1 + (-1)*(0.6065) = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935. So N is sqrt(0.3935). Let me calculate that. Hmm, sqrt(0.3935) is around 0.6275.

Wait, but actually, the state is normalized because N is the normalization factor. So the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|, right? Because for a pure state, the density matrix is just the outer product.

The reference state is a Gaussian state, so the density matrix tau would be that of a Gaussian state. But wait, what's a Gaussian state in this context? I think Gaussian states are those whose Wigner functions are Gaussian distributions, like coherent states, squeezed states, thermal states, etc. Here, the given state is a superposition of two coherent states, which makes it a non-Gaussian state. So the reference tau would be the closest Gaussian state to psi, perhaps a coherent state or something else.

But wait, the relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. Oh wait, that looks like the relative entropy between rho and tau. Because the von Neumann entropy S(rho) is trace(rho ln rho), so del_b would be S(rho) - S(tau). So to compute del_b, I need to find the entropy of rho and the entropy of the reference Gaussian state tau, then subtract.

But wait, wait. The relative entropy measure is usually defined as S(rho || tau) = trace(rho (ln rho - ln tau)), which is S(rho) - S(tau) only if rho and tau are compatible in some way. Hmm, but the question defines it as del_b = [S(rho) - S(tau)]. So perhaps I'm correct.

But wait, what's the reference Gaussian state tau here? The problem says it's the Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho. Or perhaps the closest Gaussian state? Hmm, I'm not exactly sure. Oh wait, maybe it's the Gaussian state that has the same first and second moments as the non-Gaussian state. Because then the relative entropy would measure how non-Gaussian the state is.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the same as the state if it were Gaussian. Wait, but the given state is a superposition of two coherent states, which is not Gaussian. So the reference tau could be the state that is the mixture of the two coherent states, each weighted by |cos(phi)|^2 and |sin(phi)|^2, respectively.

Wait, no, because for a Gaussian state, the density matrix would be a Gaussian, which might be a thermal state or a squeezed state, but perhaps in this case, the reference is the maximum entropy Gaussian state with the same first and second moments as rho.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the closest Gaussian state to rho. But I'm not exactly sure. This is a bit confusing.

Wait, the problem states that the relative entropy is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So I need to compute S(rho) minus S(tau), where tau is the reference Gaussian state.

But how do I find tau? Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting me to not calculate tau's entropy, but perhaps to note that if the state is Gaussian, then del_b would be zero. But wait, the given state is a Schrödinger cat state, which is non-Gaussian. So if phi is such that the state is Gaussian, then del_b would be zero. But in this case, phi is -pi/4, which is not zero or pi/2, so the state is a superposition, hence non-Gaussian. So del_b would not be zero. But wait, looking at the options, option D is zero, but the others are non-zero.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the state is Gaussian for certain parameters. For example, if phi is 0 or pi/2, then the state becomes a single coherent state, which is Gaussian. Because if phi is 0, the state is |alpha>, which is Gaussian. Similarly, phi = pi/2, the state is |-alpha>, also Gaussian. But if phi is something else, like -pi/4, then it's a superposition, making it non-Gaussian.

So, for phi = -pi/4, the state is non-Gaussian, so del_b should be positive. So the answer can't be D) 0.

Wait, but the question is to calculate nG using the relative entropy measure. So perhaps the Gaussian reference state tau is the mixture of the two pure Gaussian states |alpha> and |-alpha>, each with weight |cos(phi)|^2 and |sin(phi)|^2. Because that would be the closest Gaussian state to the non-Gaussian state, perhaps.

Wait, but a superposition state is not the same as a mixed state of the two coherent states. So the reference Gaussian state tau would be the mixed state with density matrix tau = |cos(phi)|^2 |alpha><alpha| + |sin(phi)|^2 |-alpha><-alpha|.

In that case, the entropy of rho is the entropy of the pure state |psi><psi|, which is zero because it's a pure state. Wait, no, because rho is |psi><psi|, which is a pure state, so its entropy is zero. But wait, no. If rho is a pure state, its entropy is zero. But if tau is a mixed state, its entropy would be higher. So then S(rho) is zero, and S(tau) is the entropy of that mixed state.

Wait, but wait! That can't be right because the relative entropy would become negative, which doesn't make sense for relative entropy. Because relative entropy is always non-negative.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The state rho is a pure state, so its entropy S(rho) is zero. The reference state tau is a mixed Gaussian state, so its entropy S(tau) is positive. Then del_b = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But relative entropy is usually S(rho||tau) = S(rho) - S(tau) + ... wait, maybe I'm mixing up the definitions.

Wait, the relative entropy between rho and tau is S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(rho ln tau). But in the question, the measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)], which is S(rho) - S(tau). So it's not the standard relative entropy, but some other measure.

So if rho is pure, S(rho) is zero. Then del_b = - S(tau). But that would be negative, but the question is about the non-Gaussianity, which should be a positive number. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the reference state tau is not a mixed state but the same state as rho, but treated as a Gaussian. Wait, no, because rho is non-Gaussian. Alternatively, perhaps tau is the Gaussian state that is closest to rho in some sense, like the one with the same first and second moments.

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the one that has the same mean (alpha, in phase space) and the same variance as the state rho. But since rho is a superposition, its first moment might be zero. Because the expectation value of position and momentum might be zero.

Wait, let me compute the expectation value of the position operator x for the state |psi>. The coherent state |alpha> has expectation value x = 2 Re(alpha), assuming x is proportional to (a + a†), so if alpha is real, x would be 2 alpha. Wait, but in this case, alpha is given as 0.5, so real. So |alpha> has x=1, and |-alpha> has x=-1.

So when phi is -pi/4, cos(phi) = cos(-pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Similarly, sin(phi) is sin(-pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071. Wait, but in the state |psi>, it's cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>, which for phi = -pi/4 would be [cos(pi/4)|alpha> + sin(pi/4)|-alpha> ] / N. Since cos(pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2, and sin(pi/4) is same. So the state becomes [sqrt(2)/2 |alpha> - sqrt(2)/2 |-alpha> ] / N.

So the expectation value of x for rho would be (sqrt(2)/2)^2 (alpha + (-alpha)) * 2? Wait, no. Let me think again. The expectation value of x in a superposition is the sum of the expectation values of each term, weighted by the square of the coefficients.

Wait, no, expectation value is (psi| x |psi). But for each term, |alpha> and |-alpha>, the expectation of x is alpha and -alpha, respectively. So the expectation for x in rho is [ |cos(phi)|^2 * alpha + |sin(phi)|^2 * (-alpha) ] + [ cross terms ].

Wait, the cross terms involve the overlap between |alpha> and |-alpha>. The overlap is exp(-|alpha - (-alpha)|²/2) = exp(- (2 alpha)^2 / 2) = exp(- 2 alpha²). So the cross terms are 2 Re [ cos(phi) sin(phi) * <alpha| -alpha> ].

So the expectation value <x> = [ |cos(phi)|^2 * alpha + |sin(phi)|^2 * (-alpha) ) ] + 2 Re [ cos(phi) sin(phi) * <alpha| -alpha> * (something) ].

Wait, but x is proportional to (a + a†), so the expectation value <x> would be 2 Re( alpha cos^2(phi) - alpha sin^2(phi) + ... )? Hmm, perhaps it's getting complicated. But in any case, for the state |psi>, the expectation value of x might be zero because the state is a symmetric combination of |alpha> and |-alpha>, especially when phi is -pi/4.

Wait, let me compute it for phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5. cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2.

So, <x> = [ (sqrt(2)/2)^2 * alpha + ( (-sqrt(2)/2)^2 ) * (-alpha) ) ] + cross terms.

Wait, (sqrt(2)/2)^2 is 0.5, same for the other term. So first part is 0.5 * alpha + 0.5 * (-alpha) = 0.

As for the cross terms: cos(phi) sin(phi) is (sqrt(2)/2)(-sqrt(2)/2) )= -0.5. So the cross terms are 2 Re [ (-0.5) * <alpha| -alpha> ].

What is <alpha| -alpha> ? It's e^{-|alpha + alpha|^2/2} = e^{- (2 alpha)^2 / 2} = e^{-2 alpha^2}.

So for alpha=0.5, 2 alpha^2 is 0.5, so e^{-0.5} ≈ 0.6065.

So the cross terms are 2 Re [ (-0.5) * 0.6065 ] = 2 * [ (-0.5 * 0.6065) ] = 2 * (-0.30325) = -0.6065.

But wait, the cross terms in the density matrix contribute to the expectation value, but I'm not sure if I'm calculating it correctly. Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the state |psi> for phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5 is an even state, which would have zero first moments. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is a thermal state with the same first and second moments as rho. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference is a squeezed vacuum state or a coherent state. But I'm not sure how to proceed.

Wait, the problem gives the specific form of the state, and the question is to find the non-Gaussianity. Maybe in this specific case, the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is Gaussian? No, that can't be. Because the state is a superposition of two coherent states, which is non-Gaussian.

Wait, but wait, the density matrix of a coherent state is Gaussian, but a superposition state like a Schrödinger cat is non-Gaussian. So the rho is non-Gaussian, and tau is the Gaussian state.

But how do I compute S(tau)?

Wait, perhaps the reference Gaussian state tau is the maximum entropy Gaussian with the same first and second moments as rho. But to find that, I'd need to compute the first and second moments of rho.

Alternatively, perhaps for the given parameters, the state becomes Gaussian, leading to del_b being zero. But for phi=-pi/4, it's a superposition, so not Gaussian.

Wait, let me think about the case when phi=0: the state is |alpha>, which is Gaussian. So del_b would be zero because rho and tau are the same. But in our case, phi is -pi/4, so the state is non-Gaussian, so del_b should be positive.

Wait, the options are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C) 1.38, D) 0.

But if the state is non-Gaussian, del_b should be positive, so D) is probably incorrect.

Wait, but another approach: the non-Gaussianity measure using relative entropy compares the entropy of the non-Gaussian state to the closest Gaussian state. If the non-Gaussian state is a pure state, its entropy is zero. The reference Gaussian state would have a positive entropy. Wait, but then del_b would be negative. But that can't be, because non-Gaussianity is a positive measure.

Alternatively, perhaps the measure is defined as the relative entropy between the Gaussian state and the non-Gaussian state. So del_b = S(tau) - S(rho). If rho is pure, S(rho)=0, so del_b equals S(tau). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula for non-Gaussianity is S(rho) - S(tau), but if rho is pure, S(rho) is zero, so del_b equals negative S(tau), which would be negative, but that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, perhaps the relative entropy measure is defined as S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln rho - rho ln tau), which is equal to S(rho) - S(rho, tau), where S(rho, tau) is the mutual entropy. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula given is actually S(rho) - S(tau), which would be the relative entropy of rho with respect to tau. But if rho is non-Gaussian and tau is the reference Gaussian, then for a pure rho, S(rho) is zero, and tau is a mixed Gaussian state, so S(tau) is positive. So del_b = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau), which is negative, but since relative entropy is always non-negative, this approach must be wrong.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question uses a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the state is actually Gaussian for the given phi and alpha. Let me check.

The state |psi> is a superposition of two coherent states. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions are non-Gaussian. So unless phi is 0 or pi/2, the state is non-Gaussian.

In our case, phi is -pi/4, which is neither 0 nor pi/2. So the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be positive.

Wait, but the options don't have any negative values. So perhaps the measure is the other way around: S(tau) - S(rho), which would be positive.

Wait, if rho is non-Gaussian (so pure, S(rho)=0), and tau is a Gaussian, which could be a mixed state with some entropy S(tau), then del_b = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But that would be negative, which isn't an option. So perhaps I'm mixing up the terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is [trace(tau ln tau) - trace(rho ln rho)], which would be S(tau) - S(rho). So del_b would be S(tau) - S(rho). If rho is pure, S(rho)=0, so del_b = S(tau).

But then, how do I find S(tau)? Because tau is the reference Gaussian state.

But I'm getting stuck on finding tau. Alternatively, perhaps for the given parameters, the state is Gaussian, so del_b is zero.

Wait, let me re-check: when phi = -pi/4 and alpha=0.5, is the state Gaussian?

No, because a Gaussian state is one that can be written as a displaced squeezed vacuum state. The given state is a superposition of two coherent states, which is a non-Gaussian state.

So del_b should be positive, so options A, B, or C.

But without knowing the exact form of tau, it's hard to compute. Maybe the problem is expecting me to recognize that the state is Gaussian, leading to del_b=0. But that's not the case here.

Wait, another approach: perhaps when the state is a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases, and phi is -pi/4, the state might have certain symmetries that make it a squeezed state, which is Gaussian. Wait, is that possible?

Wait, a squeezed state isn't a superposition of coherent states. Squeezed states are Gaussian, yes, but they are generated by squeezing operators acting on coherent states. So a superposition state is not a squeezed state.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the density matrix rho and see if it's Gaussian. But that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is Gaussian. But I don't think so.

Wait, another thought: perhaps for phi = -pi/4, the state |psi> can be written as a product of two coherent states. But no, it's a single superposition.

Wait, let me compute N first. With phi=-pi/4, sin(2*phi) is sin(-pi/2) = -1. So N^2 = 1 + (-1)*exp(-2*(0.5)^2) = 1 - exp(-0.5).

exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065, so N^2 = 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935, so N ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state |psi> is [ (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

The density matrix rho is |psi><psi|.

The reference state tau is a Gaussian state. Since rho is a pure non-Gaussian state, the relative entropy would measure how different rho is from the closest Gaussian state.

But without more information on how to compute tau, perhaps the question is trying to trick me into thinking that for certain parameters, the state is Gaussian, leading to del_b=0.

Wait, another angle: the non-Gaussianity measure is the relative entropy between rho and the closest Gaussian state tau. For a Gaussian state, this would be zero. But if the state is non-Gaussian, it's positive.

But in our case, the state is non-Gaussian, so del_b should be positive. So D) 0 is not the answer. So the options must be A, B, or C.

But how to compute it?

Wait, another approach: since the state is a two-term superposition, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the mixture of the two coherent states, each with probability |cos(phi)|^2 and |sin(phi)|^2. So tau would be |cos(phi)|^2 |alpha><alpha| + |sin(phi)|^2 |-alpha><-alpha|.

In that case, the density matrix of tau is a classical mixture of two coherent states. The entropy of tau would be S(tau) = - p ln p - q ln q, where p=|cos(phi)|^2 and q=|sin(phi)|^2.

In this case, phi is -pi/4, so |cos(phi)|^2 = 0.5, same for |sin(phi)|^2. So tau is a completely mixed state with p=q=0.5.

So the entropy S(tau) is -0.5 ln 0.5 - 0.5 ln 0.5 = 1.

But wait, in that case, the state rho is pure (as it's a single state), so S(rho)=0. Then del_b = S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - 1 = -1, which doesn't make sense because relative entropy should be positive. So perhaps the question uses S(tau) - S(rho), which would be 1 - 0 = 1. So del_b is 1.

But the options don't include 1. The closest is option C) 1.38.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing a factor. Let me check the actual formula.

Wait, the relative entropy measure is given as del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So if rho is pure, its trace(rho ln rho) is zero. Tau is the reference Gaussian, which in this case is a mixed state with S(tau)=1. So del_b = 0 - (1) = -1. But that would mean del_b is negative, which isn't possible for relative entropy. So perhaps I'm still getting something wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is S(rho||tau) = trace(rho ln(rho/tau)). That would be S(rho) - S(tau) + ... Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative entropy is defined as S(rho) - S(tau), but only when rho is non-Gaussian. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reference Gaussian state is a coherent state with the same expectation value as rho. But earlier, we thought that the expectation value <x> might be zero.

If rho has <x> = 0, then the reference coherent state would be the vacuum state, |0>. The entropy of |0> is zero because it's pure. So del_b would be S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - 0 = 0. But that would mean the non-Gaussianity is zero, which contradicts the state being non-Gaussian.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe the correct approach is to realize that the state is Gaussian when phi is 0 or pi/2, but for other phi values, it's non-Gaussian. So for phi=-pi/4, it's non-Gaussian, so del_b is non-zero.

Wait, but the question gives specific numbers. N= sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)).

With phi=-pi/4, sin(2 phi)= sin(-pi/2)= -1. So N^2=1 - exp(-2*(0.5)^2)=1 - exp(-0.5)= approx 0.3935, so N= sqrt(0.3935)=approx 0.6275.

But perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is actually Gaussian. How? Let me think: perhaps the state can be written as a Gaussian state for some parameters.

Wait, another idea: perhaps when phi = -pi/4, the state |psi> is a squeezed vacuum state, which is Gaussian. But I don't think so because a squeezed vacuum state is |0, r>, which doesn't look like a superposition of two coherent states.

Alternatively, maybe the state |psi> is a coherent state for some other parameter. But I don't think so. Coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator, and a superposition of two coherent states with parameters alpha and -alpha would not be a coherent state unless phi is 0 or pi/2.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the Wigner function of the state and see if it's Gaussian. The Wigner function of a coherent state is Gaussian, but for a superposition state, it's not. So for phi=-pi/4, the state is non-Gaussian, so del_b is positive.

But without knowing the exact calculation method, I'm not sure how to proceed. Maybe the answer is option C) 1.38, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B) 0.25, but I can't be sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the number of photons. The state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, which are coherent states with a certain photon number distribution. The non-Gaussianity could be related to the photon number distribution. But I'm not familiar enough with the exact calculations to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is actually Gaussian. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, wait! Another thought: perhaps when phi is such that cos(phi) + sin(phi) is zero, the state becomes a single coherent state. But with phi = -pi/4, cos(phi) is sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) is -sqrt(2)/2. So cos(phi) + sin(phi) = 0. Hence, the state |psi> is [ (sqrt(2)/2)|alpha> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-alpha> ] / N. Hmm, but that's a superposition, not a single coherent state.

Alternatively, perhaps if alpha is zero, the state is a superposition of |0> and |0>, so it's just |0>, which is Gaussian. But alpha is 0.5, so that's not the case.

Hmm, I'm stuck. I think I'll just have to make an educated guess. Since the state is a non-Gaussian state, del_b is non-zero. The options are A)2.48, B)0.25, C)1.38, D)0.

If the reference Gaussian state's entropy is 1, then del_b could be 1, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C)1.38.


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \( \phi \) is the phase, \( \alpha \) is the amplitude, and \( N \) is the normalization constant given by:

\[
N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi) \exp(-2\alpha^2)}.
\]

The relative entropy measure is defined as:

\[
\text{del}_b = \text{trace}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{trace}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \( \rho \) is the density matrix of the non-Gaussian state and \( \tau \) is the density matrix of the reference Gaussian state.

### Key Observations:
1. **Gaussian vs. Non-Gaussian States**: Gaussian states include coherent states, squeezed states, and thermal states. A Schrödinger cat state, being a superposition of two coherent states, is non-Gaussian unless the superposition reduces to a single coherent state (e.g., when \( \phi = 0 \) or \( \phi = \pi/2 \)).

2. **Parameters**: For \( \phi = -\pi/4 \) and \( \alpha = 0.5 \), the state is a superposition of \( |\alpha\rangle \) and \( |-\alpha\rangle \), making it non-Gaussian. Thus, \( \text{del}_b \) should be positive.

3. **Reference Gaussian State**: The reference Gaussian state \( \tau \) is likely the closest Gaussian state to \( \rho \), such as a mixture of the two coherent states \( |\alpha\rangle \) and \( |-\alpha\rangle \), weighted by \( |\cos(\phi)|^2 \) and \( |\sin(\phi)|^2 \), respectively. For \( \phi = -\pi/4 \), these weights are both \( 0.5 \), making \( \tau \) a maximally mixed state.

4. **Entropy Calculations**:
   - The entropy of \( \rho \), \( S(\rho) \), is zero because \( \rho \) is a pure state (a single quantum state).
   - The entropy of \( \tau \), \( S(\tau) \), for a maximally mixed state is \( 1 \) (in natural logarithm units).

5. **Relative Entropy**: Using the formula \( \text{del}_b = S(\rho) - S(\tau) \), we find \( \text{del}_b = 0 - 1 = -1 \). However, this result is negative, which is unphysical for relative entropy. This suggests the formula might instead be \( \text{del}_b = S(\tau) - S(\rho) \), giving \( \text{del}_b = 1 \). Since \( 1 \) is not an option, the closest match is \( 1.38 \), likely accounting for additional factors in the calculation.

### Conclusion:
The state is non-Gaussian, and the relative entropy measure \( \text{del}_b \) is positive. Based on the reasoning and the provided options, the most plausible answer is:

**Answer: C**
