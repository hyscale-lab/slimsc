Okay, I'm trying to figure out this NMR and LC-MS question. Let me start by reading the problem carefully.

So, the scenario is that I have a small peptidic compound synthesized chemically. The 1H NMR of the crude sample looks mostly like what's expected except for two peaks that are the same alpha-proton. Both peaks have similar shifts and roughly equal integrals, adding up to 1H. Also, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. Then, the LC-MS analysis at elevated temperature shows two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, matching the expected molecule.

Hmm, what's going on here. Let me think about each part.

First, the NMR issue. Usually, each proton in a molecule gives a peak. But here, for the same alpha-proton, there are two peaks. They have similar shifts but different enough to split into two. Wait, but the integrals add up to 1H. So if two peaks each integrate to about 0.5, that sums to 1H. That suggests maybe the proton is split into two, but why? But coupling is ruled out because the coupling pattern doesn't explain it—so it's not a simple AB system where two protons are coupling.

Wait, another possibility—could it be a diastereomer? No, because diastereomers would have different chemical shifts, but the shifts are similar here. Or maybe a racemic mixture? No, because enantiomers have the same NMR shifts because they're mirror images. So if it's a racemic mix, the NMR would show a single peak. So B) is about enantiomers, but that's probably not it because the shifts would be the same, but in this case, the peaks are split.

Wait, but the question says the two peaks have similar shifts, not the same. So maybe it's a diastereomer. Diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would show different shifts. But the problem is, the two peaks are from the same alpha-proton. So each diastereomer's H would have a slightly different shift. So if the molecule has two possible diastereomers, each with the same alpha proton in a different environment, but in the crude sample, they're present in equal amounts.

Wait, but the integrals add up correctly. So perhaps the molecule is a diastereomeric mixture. Let me think about diastereomers. Suppose the compound has a stereocenter that wasn't fully controlled during synthesis. Then, you might get two diastereomers each with their own shift for the alpha proton. So in the NMR, you'd see two peaks, each integrating to 0.5H. But that would only happen if the two diastereomers are in equal amounts. Because each contributes half the H.

But wait, the problem is in the crude compound. So perhaps during the synthesis, some stereocenters are not formed correctly, leading to a mixture.

Looking at the options, option D is diastereoisomers. So that could fit. But let's also think about the LC-MS part. The LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass. So same m/z, same retention time? No, wait, same mass but different retention times? Or same mass and same retention time?

Wait, the question says "elevated temperature" for LC-MS. Hmm, higher temperature usually reduces retention time. But in this case, the two peaks have same mass. So same molecular weight, so same molecular formula. So the peaks are likely from two different compounds with the same mass. But wait, the same mass and same molecular formula would mean they are either enantiomers or diastereomers. Because enantiomers have same molecular weight but are non-superimposable mirror images.

But in LC-MS, would enantiomers and diastereomers elute at different times? For enantiomers, if the column is achiral, they would elute together. If the column is chiral, they would separate. But the question says "elevated temperature". So maybe the column is not chiral, so enantiomers would co-elute. But the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass. So if the sample is a racemic mix, it would show as one peak because they can't be separated on a regular column. So two peaks suggest something else.

Wait, but the problem says both peaks have same mass. So same molecular weight. So the two compounds have same molecular formula. So same molecular formula, but different structures. So maybe they are isomers. They could be constitutional isomers, enantiomers, or diastereomers.

But the question says that the NMR of the crude compound has peaks for the same alpha-proton. So perhaps the molecule has a stereocenter that leads to two diastereomers. Each diastereomer would have a different alpha-proton environment, hence two peaks. But the NMR integrates to 1H, so each diastereomer contributes 0.5H. So their presence in equal amounts would cause the integrals to add up to 1H.

In the LC-MS, if the two diastereomers are present, and the column can separate them, then you get two peaks. But wait, diastereomers have different physical properties, so they might have different retention times, hence two peaks. But if the column isn't separating them, they'd co-elute. But the question says the LC-MS shows two peaks, so maybe they are separated.

Wait, but the problem says that the crude compound is being analyzed. So perhaps the compound has formed more than one product during synthesis, but the question states that the NMR is consistent with the expected molecule except for the two peaks. So perhaps the main product is the correct one, and some impurity. But the LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass, so same molecular weight. So either it's a racemic mix or diastereomers.

Wait, but the problem states the LC-MS shows two peaks of the same mass. So same molecular weight. So same molecular formula. So possible isomers.

Now, the options. Option A is contaminated with a precursor. Precurors would have a lower mass (since they have lost something to form the product). But the question says the same mass. So that's not A.

Option B: mixture of enantiomers. If it's a racemic mix, the NMR would show a single peak because the alpha protons in each enantiomer are the same. But in this case, the NMR shows two peaks, so B is not correct.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. Hmm, not sure about this term. Double coupling might refer to coupling with two different nuclei, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, could this refer to some kind of side-reaction during the formation of the amide bond? Maybe forming two different diastereomers due to the amide formation (like different stereoisomers). But I'm not sure.

Option D: mixture of diastereoisomers. So in the NMR, each diastereomer would have its own alpha proton shift, leading to two peaks. And in the LC-MS, they are separated because they're diastereomers and have different physical properties.

So the two observations fit diastereomers. Both the NMR and LC-MS would show two separate entities.

Wait, but the problem states that the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of same mass, which are expected. So both have the same molecular weight as the expected product. So perhaps it's a diastereomeric mixture, and the LC-MS can separate them.

So, the most likely explanation is that the crude compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers.

Wait, but another thought. Another possibility is that the compound is a racemic mixture, but then why two NMR peaks? Racemic mixtures don't split the NMR peaks because the two enantiomers have the same environment for each proton. So that would not explain the two peaks. So option B is out.

So between C and D.

Alternatively, could it be that the amide bond formed in such a way that it leads to a doublet due to coupling? But the problem says the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling, so that's not the issue.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond forming. Hmm, not entirely sure. Double coupling could refer to something else, perhaps like a geminal coupling or something else. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the amide bond is formed in a way that creates an additional coupling, but the question says it's ruled out.

Wait, the problem states that the two peaks have similar shifts and roughly equal integrals. So maybe it's a case of a diastereomer with a different configuration, leading to two different shifts.

So, putting it all together, the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton because the compound exists as a mixture of two diastereoisomers. Each diastereomer has a different environment for the alpha proton, leading to different shifts. And since the diastereomers are present in equal amounts, the integrals add up to 1H. The LC-MS, under elevated temperature, separates the diastereomers, showing two peaks of same mass.

So the correct answer is D) The crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers.

The question involves analyzing a small peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (summing to 1H). LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass, consistent with the expected molecule. The task is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **NMR Spectrum**:
   - The presence of two peaks for the same alpha-proton suggests two distinct environments for the proton.
   - The similar chemical shifts and equal integrals (summing to 1H) indicate that the two peaks arise from two species in equal amounts, each contributing 0.5H.
   - Spin-spin coupling is ruled out as the explanation, so the splitting cannot be due to typical coupling between protons.

2. **LC-MS Analysis**:
   - Two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass are observed.
   - This indicates two compounds with the same molecular formula but different physical properties, likely isomers.

3. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A (Contamination with a precursor)**: A precursor would have a lower molecular weight than the expected product. Since the LC-MS shows peaks of the same mass as the expected molecule, this option is ruled out.
   - **Option B (Mixture of enantiomers)**: Enantiomers have identical chemical environments for protons, so their NMR spectra would show a single peak for each proton. Since the NMR shows two distinct peaks, this option is also ruled out.
   - **Option C ('Double coupling' during amide-bond formation)**: The problem explicitly states that spin-spin coupling is ruled out as an explanation. Additionally, "double coupling" is not a standard term in this context, making this option unlikely.
   - **Option D (Mixture of diastereoisomers)**: Diastereoisomers have different physical and chemical environments, leading to distinct NMR shifts. The two peaks in the NMR spectrum can be explained by two diastereoisomers in equal amounts, each contributing 0.5H. The LC-MS separation of the two peaks further supports this explanation, as diastereoisomers often have different retention times due to their differing physical properties.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent explanation for the observations is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers. The NMR spectrum shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton due to the different environments in the two diastereomers, and the LC-MS analysis separates the two isomers, consistent with their differing physical properties.
