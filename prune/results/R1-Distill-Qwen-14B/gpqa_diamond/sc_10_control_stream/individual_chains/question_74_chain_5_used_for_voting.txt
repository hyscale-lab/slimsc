Okay, I'm trying to figure out this physics problem about radioactive decay. So, let's see what the question is asking. 

Alright, the scenario is that there's an atom, and we know that the probability of it decaying within 100 minutes is 32%. Now, 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. We need to find the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. Hmm, wait, wait. Let me think about how radioactive decay works.

I remember that radioactive decay is a random process and follows an exponential decay law. Oh right, the decay probability is described by the equation P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt), where λ is the decay constant and t is the time. But wait, wait, actually, I think it's the probability that the atom has not decayed by time t, so the survival probability is e^(-λt), and the decay probability is 1 minus that.

Wait, the problem says the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So that means P(100) = 0.32. Let me write that down. So, 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Because the probability of decaying by time t is 1 - e^(-λt). So, solving for λ would give us the decay constant.

But wait, 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. So, the question is about the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Wait, does that mean 150 minutes from now, so total time of 50 +150 = 200 minutes? Or is it 150 minutes from the current time, regardless of the initial 50? Hmm, the way the question is phrased says, "the next 150 minutes." So I think it's the next 150 minutes after the current time, which is 50 minutes into the monitoring.

So, the total time from the start would be 50 +150 = 200 minutes. But wait, maybe I should think about it differently. Because the decay process is memoryless. So, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes depends only on the current time, not on how long it's been already. Oh, right! Radioactive decay is a Poisson process, so the probability doesn't depend on the past time. It only depends on the time remaining.

Wait, that's a key point. So, whether 50 minutes have passed or not, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval, regardless of when you start. Because the decay is independent of the time elapsed so far.

So, if that's the case, I don't need to worry about the 50 minutes that have already passed. Because the question is about the next 150 minutes. So the probability is just the probability of decaying in 150 minutes, given the decay constant λ.

But wait, I have to find λ first. From the initial information, the decay probability in 100 minutes is 32%. So, the probability P(100) is 0.32. That means 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ*100). So, solving for λ:

0.32 = 1 - e^(-100λ)
e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
Take natural log of both sides: -100λ = ln(0.68)
λ = - ln(0.68) / 100

Let me compute that. ln(0.68) is approximately ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3857 (since ln(0.7)= ~-0.3567, and 0.68 is a bit less than 0.7, so maybe around -0.3857). So, λ = 0.3857 / 100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

Now, the question is about the next 150 minutes. The probability of decaying in that time is P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ*150).

Let me compute that. Plugging in λ = 0.003857:

P(150) = 1 - e^(-0.003857 * 150)
0.003857 * 150 = 0.57855
So, e^(-0.57855) ≈ ?

I remember that e^-0.5 ≈ 0.6065, e^-0.6 ≈ 0.5488. 0.57855 is between 0.5 and 0.6, closer to 0.6.

Let me approximate: Let's say x = 0.57855. Let me compute e^-x.

Using the Taylor series around x=0.5. Or maybe just using known values:

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator approach mentally.

Wait, maybe I can compute it as follows: 0.57855 is approximately 0.5785.

Let me compute ln(0.56) ≈ -0.5798, which is close to -0.5785. Wait, wait, e^(-0.5798) is 0.56. So, e^(-0.5785) is about 0.56 + a bit. Because as the exponent increases towards 0, e^-x increases. So, since 0.5785 is less than 0.5798, e^-0.5785 is slightly larger than 0.56.

Alternatively, maybe use the approximation: e^x ≈ 1 + x for small x, but that's not applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps interpolation.

Wait, wait, let's think again: we have e^(-0.5785) ≈ 0.561. Because e^-0.57 ≈ 0.563; e^-0.58 ≈ 0.561.

Wait, let me check:

We know that:
ln(0.56) = ln(56/100) = ln(14/25) ≈ -0.5798 (as I thought earlier).
ln(0.561) ≈ approximately the same.

Wait, but e^-0.5785 is 1 / e^0.5785. Let me compute e^0.5785.

e^0.5 is about 1.6487. e^0.57 is around 1.768 (since e^0.57 is e^0.5 * e^0.07 ≈ 1.6487 * 1.0725 ≈ 1.776). Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can use the formula: e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 for small x, but x=0.5785 is not small. Alternatively, use a calculator-like approach.

Alternatively, I can compute the exponent: 0.5785 * 1 ≈ 0.5785. Let me think about known e^0.5785.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute ln(0.561) ≈ -0.5785, so e^-0.5785 is 0.561. Therefore, e^-0.5785 ≈ 0.561.

So, P(150) = 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, which is 43.9%, approximately 44%. So, looking at the options, option A is 44%. 

Wait, but wait another thing. Hmm, the initial calculation: I assumed that the decay in the next 150 minutes is 150 minutes from now, but perhaps I got the formula wrong. Because when you have P(t) as the probability of decaying by time t, then the probability of decaying between time a and a + t is P(a + t) - P(a). 

Wait, that's an important point. Because if I have already waited 50 minutes, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is P(50 +150) - P(50). So, that would be P(200) - P(50). 

Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because initially, I thought the probability was just P(150), but that's only if you start monitoring at t=0. But in this case, since 50 minutes have passed, and the atom hasn't decayed, the next 150 minutes would require calculating the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes.

Hmm, that's a different approach. So I should compute P(200) - P(50).

Wait, but if that's the case, then I need to compute both P(50) and P(200), and subtract.

Let me redo the calculations with this in mind.

First, compute λ, which I already did: λ ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

Compute P(50): 1 - e^(-λ*50)

λ*50 = 0.003857 *50 ≈ 0.19285.

e^(-0.19285) ≈ approximately 0.8247. So P(50) = 1 - 0.8247 ≈ 0.1753, or 17.53%.

Next, compute P(200): 1 - e^(-λ*200).

λ*200 = 0.003857 *200 = 0.7714.

e^(-0.7714) ≈ approximately 0.462. So P(200) = 1 - 0.462 ≈ 0.538, or 53.8%.

So, the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes is P(200) - P(50) = 0.538 - 0.1753 = 0.3627, which is approximately 36.3%. Hmm, wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, the options are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%, so 36% isn't an option. So this approach might be incorrect.

Wait, wait, but wait. The problem states that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed. So, should I condition the probability on the atom not having decayed yet? Because in radioactive decay, the decay process is memoryless, meaning that the probability only depends on the current state, not the past. So, the fact that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes doesn't change the probability for the next 150 minutes. So, the probability of it decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of it decaying in any 150-minute interval, starting from now.

Wait, but that would imply that the probability is P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ*150). Which earlier we calculated as approximately 44%, which is option A.

But earlier, when I considered the time up to 200 minutes and subtracted P(50), I got about 36%, which isn't an option. So, which approach is correct?

I think the confusion arises from the definition of the decay probability. The decay probability within a certain time is the probability that the atom will decay at some point during that time. So, the probability of the atom decaying in the next 150 minutes is P(150), which is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute interval, regardless of when you start. Because the decay is memoryless.

So, the correct approach is to compute P(150) = 1 - e^(-λ*150).

Wait, but why did I get 36% earlier when I considered the time from 50 to 200? Because that's the probability of the atom decaying between 50 and 200 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed before 50 minutes. So, that calculation would require knowing the conditional probability.

Wait, the question is asking for the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have passed and it hasn't decayed yet. So, perhaps it's a conditional probability. So, the probability is P(decaying between 50 and 200) given that it hasn't decayed before 50.

Wait, that's correct. Because the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, so the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is conditioned on it not having decayed yet.

In that case, the probability is [P(200) - P(50)] / [1 - P(50)].

Because the conditional probability P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). Here, A is the event that the atom decays between 50 and 200, and B is the event that it hasn't decayed by 50.

So, since the events are independent, P(A ∩ B) is the same as P(A given B) * P(B). But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, the conditional probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 is equal to [P(200) - P(50)] / [1 - P(50)].

Because P(not decayed by 50) is e^(-λ*50) = e^(-0.003857 *50) ≈ e^(-0.19285) ≈ 0.8247.

So, the conditional probability is (0.538 -0.1753) / (1 -0.1753) ) = 0.3627 / 0.8247 ≈ 0.4398, which is about 44%. So, that matches option A.

Wait, but that seems conflicting. Because when I compute [P(200) - P(50)] / [1 - P(50)], I get approximately 44%, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the memoryless property, the probability should be the same as any 150-minute interval. So, that would imply that the conditional probability is the same as P(150), which is 44%. So, both approaches lead to the same answer. So, the correct answer is 44%, option A.

But wait, in the first approach, I thought the answer would be 44% because the memoryless property says the probability doesn't depend on the time already passed. But when I calculated the conditional probability, I also get 44%. So, both ways, it's 44%, which is option A.

So, the initial mistake was not considering the conditional probability, but once I did that, I still end up with 44%. So, the correct answer is A, 44%.

To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential decay law. The decay probability within a time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. From the problem, we know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so:

\[
P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging for \( \lambda \):

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)
\]

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100} \approx 0.003857 \, \text{per minute}
\]

The question asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed and the atom has not decayed. Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on the decay constant \( \lambda \) and the time interval (150 minutes). Thus, we calculate:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.003857 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.003857 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57855
\]

\[
e^{-0.57855} \approx 0.561
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.561 = 0.439 \, \text{or} \, 43.9\%
\]

This calculation aligns with the memoryless property of radioactive decay, meaning the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the previous 50 minutes. Therefore, the probability is approximately 44%.

e^(-100λ) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68

λ = - ln(0.68) / 100

Let me compute that. ln(0.68) is approximately ln(0.68) ≈ -0.3857 (since ln(0.7)= ~-0.3567, and 0.68 is a bit less than 0.7, so maybe around -0.3857). So, λ = 0.3857 / 100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

Let me compute that. Plugging in λ = 0.003857:

P(150) = 1 - e^(-0.003857 * 150)
0.003857 * 150 = 0.57855
So, e^(-0.57855) ≈ ?

I remember that e^-0.5 ≈ 0.6065, e^-0.6 ≈ 0.5488. 0.57855 is between 0.5 and 0.6, closer to 0.6.

Let me approximate: Let's say x = 0.57855. Let me compute e^-x.

Using the Taylor series around x=0.5. Or maybe just using known values:

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator approach mentally.

Wait, maybe I can compute it as follows: 0.57855 is approximately 0.5785.

Let me compute ln(0.56) ≈ -0.5798, which is close to -0.5785. Wait, wait, e^(-0.5798) is 0.56. So, e^(-0.5785) is about 0.56 + a bit. Because as the exponent increases towards 0, e^-x increases. So, since 0.5785 is less than 0.5798, e^-0.5785 is slightly larger than 0.56.

Alternatively, maybe use the approximation: e^x ≈ 1 + x for small x, but that's not applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps interpolation.

Wait, wait, let's think again: we have e^(-0.5785) ≈ 0.561. Because e^-0.57 ≈ 0.563; e^-0.58 ≈ 0.561.

Wait, let me check:

We know that:
ln(0.56) = ln(56/100) = ln(14/25) ≈ -0.5798 (as I thought earlier).
ln(0.561) ≈ approximately the same.

Wait, but e^-0.5785 is 1 / e^0.5785. Let me compute e^0.5785.

e^0.5 is about 1.6487. e^0.57 is around 1.768 (since e^0.57 is e^0.5 * e^0.07 ≈ 1.6487 * 1.0725 ≈ 1.776). Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Alternatively, I can compute the exponent: 0.5785 * 1 ≈ 0.5785. Let me think about known e^0.5785.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute ln(0.561) ≈ -0.5785, so e^-0.5785 is 0.561. Therefore, e^-0.5785 ≈ 0.561.

So, P(150) = 1 - 0.561 = 0.439, which is 43.9%, approximately 44%. So, looking at the options, option A is 44%.

Because when you have P(t) as the probability of decaying by time t, then the probability of decaying between time a and a + t is P(a + t) - P(a). 

Wait, that's an important point. Because if I have already waited 50 minutes, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is P(50 +150) - P(50). So, that would be P(200) - P(50). 

Oh, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because initially, I thought the probability was just P(150), but that's only if you start monitoring at t=0.

e^(-0.19285) ≈ approximately 0.8247. So P(50) = 1 - 0.8247 ≈ 0.1753, or 17.53%.

Next, compute P(200): 1 - e^(-λ*200).

λ*200 = 0.003857 *200 = 0.7714.

e^(-0.7714) ≈ approximately 0.462. So P(200) = 1 - 0.462 ≈ 0.538, or 53.8%.

So, the probability of decay between 50 and 200 minutes is P(200) - P(50) = 0.538 - 0.1753 = 0.3627, which is approximately 36.3%. Hmm, wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Hmm, the options are 44%, 40%, 52%, 48%, so 36% isn't an option. So this approach might be incorrect.

Because the conditional probability P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B). Here, A is the event that the atom decays between 50 and 200, and B is the event that it hasn't decayed by 50.

So, since the events are independent, P(A ∩ B) is the same as P(A given B) * P(B). But I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, the conditional probability that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 is equal to [P(200) - P(50)] / [1 - P(50)].

Because P(not decayed by 50) is e^(-λ*50) = e^(-0.003857 *50) ≈ e^(-0.19285) ≈ 0.8247.

So, the conditional probability is (0.538 -0.1753) / (1 -0.1753) ) = 0.3627 / 0.8247 ≈ 0.4398, which is about 44%. So, that matches option A.

Wait, but that seems conflicting. Because when I compute [P(200) - P(50)] / [1 - P(50)], I get approximately 44%, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about the memoryless property, the probability should be the same as any 150-minute interval. So, that would imply that the conditional probability is the same as P(150), which is 44%. So, both approaches lead to the same answer. So, the correct answer is 44%, option A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the radioactive decay process, which follows an exponential decay law. The decay probability within a time \( t \) is given by:

\[
P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
\]

where \( \lambda \) is the decay constant. From the problem, we know that the probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%, so:

\[
P(100) = 0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
\]

Rearranging for \( \lambda \):

\[
e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-\lambda \cdot 100 = \ln(0.68)

\[
\lambda = -\frac{\ln(0.68)}{100} \approx 0.003857 \, \text{per minute}
\]

The question asks for the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes, given that 50 minutes have already passed and the atom has not decayed. Since radioactive decay is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on the decay constant \( \lambda \) and the time interval (150 minutes). Thus, we calculate:

\[
P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda \approx 0.003857 \):

\[
\lambda \cdot 150 = 0.003857 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57855
\]

\[
e^{-0.57855} \approx 0.561
\]

\[
P(150) = 1 - 0.561 = 0.439 \, \text{or} \, 43.9\%
\]

This calculation aligns with the memoryless property of radioactive decay, meaning the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the previous 50 minutes. Therefore, the probability is approximately 44%.
