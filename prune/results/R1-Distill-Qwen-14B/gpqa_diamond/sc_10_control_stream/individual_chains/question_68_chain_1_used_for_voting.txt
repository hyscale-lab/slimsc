Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

So the setup is that there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. Oh right, Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction, so the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with that. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after this change.

Wait, so initially, the magnetic field is along Z. The particle's spin is aligned with it because that's the lowest energy state, I think. So the magnetic moment mu is in the same direction as B. But when the field is turned off, the particle is no longer in a magnetic field, so I guess it's in a state of zero magnetic field. Then, another field is applied along Y. Both fields have the same magnitude, so B remains the same in magnitude but changes direction.

The question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the moment. So I need to find how the expectation value of the Sz component changes over time.

Wait a second, when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian changes. Initially, the Hamiltonian was H = -mu·B, which for B along Z would be H_initial = -gamma Sz B. But when the field switches to Y, the new Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -gamma Sz B' perhaps? Or wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, mu is the magnetic moment, which is gamma Sz. So the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. Then, the energy is given by the dot product of mu and B. So when B is along Z, H_initial = -mu · B = -gamma S_z B. But when the field is along Y, H_final would be -gamma (S_x B + S_y B + S_z * 0) because B is along Y, so only S_y component is involved. Wait, no, because B is along Y, the direction of the field is (0,1,0). So the dot product would be mu · B = gamma S_z * 0 (since mu is gamma S_z? Wait, wait. No, no, mu is the magnetic moment vector. Oh, wait, wait, mu is defined as gamma S, not just S_z. Oh wait, the question says mu = gamma S_z. Hmm, but that would mean mu is a vector only along z? That can't be right because if B is along Y, then the dot product would involve other components. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, the problem states mu = gamma S_z. Oh, that's unusual because typically, the magnetic moment is a vector, and mu would be gamma multiplied by the spin vector S. So perhaps that's a typo or a misunderstanding. Because if mu is only along z, then when B is along Y, the interaction would be zero. That can't be right because the problem says the average starts oscillating. So perhaps mu is actually the vector gamma times S, not just S_z. Maybe I should read the question again.

The question says: mu = gamma * S_z. Hmm, that would imply that mu is a vector in the z-direction only. But then, when the magnetic field points along Y, the magnetic moment is along Z, so their dot product is zero. So the energy would be zero, implying no Hamiltonian. That can't be possible because then there would be no time evolution, and the average wouldn't oscillate. Hmm. But the problem states that the average starts oscillating, so that suggests that the Hamiltonian does have non-zero components. Thus, perhaps the question has a typo, and mu is actually the vector gamma times S. Because then, mu would be in the same direction as S, which is a vector with components Sx, Sy, Sz.

Assuming that mu is the vector gamma S, then the initial magnetic field along Z would have the interaction H_initial = -mu · B_initial = -gamma S_z B. Then, when the field is turned off, the particle is in a state that's an eigenstate of S_z, but when the field is turned on along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -mu · B_final = -gamma S_y B.

Wait, but the problem says that the magnetic field is turned off and then another is turned on. So perhaps the initial state is an eigenstate of H_initial, but after the field changes, the state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian.

Wait, let's think about the time evolution. The particle's state after the field change will determine how its expectation values evolve. Suppose the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue ħ/2 (since spin-1/2, so Sz = ħ/2 |+z>). Then, when the field is suddenly changed to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. The state |+z> is not an eigenstate of S_y, so it will evolve in time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment, which is <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>. So when the state evolves, the expectation value of S_z (and thus mu_z) will oscillate.

To find the frequency, I need to find the energy splitting in the new Hamiltonian. Because the oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference between states, which corresponds to the frequency via E = hbar omega.

So the new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Because mu is gamma S, and B is along Y, so mu · B = gamma (S_x*0 + S_y * B + S_z * 0) = gamma B S_y. So H = - (mu · B) = -gamma B S_y. Wait, I think the sign might be important, but perhaps the absolute value will come into play for the frequency.

Wait, the actual form of H is H = - mu · B. So if mu is the magnetic moment vector, and B is the field vector, then H = - mu · B. So if mu = gamma S, then H = -gamma S · B.

So when B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.

Now, the eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively. So the energy eigenvalues are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2), because H = -gamma B S_y. So E_+ = (-gamma B) * (ħ/2), and E_- = (-gamma B) * (-ħ/2) = gamma B ħ/2.

Wait no, wait: S_y |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>, so H |+y> = (-gamma B) * (ħ/2) |+y> = E_+ |+y>. So E_+ is (-gamma B) (ħ/2), and E_- is (+gamma B) (ħ/2).

The energy difference between these two states is E_- - E_+ = [gamma B (ħ/2)] - [ - gamma B (ħ/2) ] = gamma B ħ.

The transition frequency is delta E / hbar. So delta E is gamma B ħ, so frequency is (gamma B ħ ) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, that can't be right because the problem states that the average of the z-component oscillates. Let me think about the time evolution.

The initial state is |+z>. After the field is switched to Y, the state is still |+z> at t=0^+. So we can express |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of H (which are |+y> and |-y>).

The eigenstates of H are |+y> and |-y>, and their corresponding energies are E_+ and E_-.

So |+z> can be written as a combination of |+y> and |-y>.

The time evolution of a state is given by each component evolving with their respective phase factors.

So |psi(t)> = c_+ |+y> e^{-i E_+ t / ħ} + c_- |−y> e^{-i E_- t / ħ}.

The coefficients c_+ and c_- are determined by expanding |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

The expansion coefficients for |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y> are known. Let me recall that:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt{2}
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt{2}

So solving for |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>:

|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>) ) / sqrt{2}.

So c_+ = 1/sqrt(2), c_- = 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, let me check: 

Expressing |+y> as (|+z> + |-z>)/√2, and |-y> as (|+z> - |-z>)/√2.

Then, |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/√2.

Yes, that's correct. So the coefficients are 1/sqrt(2) for both |+y> and |-y>.

So the state becomes:

|psi(t)> = [ |+y> e^{-i E_+ t/ħ } + |−y> e^{-i E_- t/ħ } ] / sqrt(2).

The expectation value of S_z is <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of S_z in the state |psi(t)>, given the expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter approach. The time evolution under the Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y will cause transitions between |+y> and |-y>, which are the eigenstates.

But since the initial state is |+z>, which is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>, the state |psi(t)> will precess in time, leading to oscillations in various observables, including <S_z>.

The oscillation frequency of <S_z> is determined by the energy difference between the eigenstates. The energy difference is E_- - E_+ = [gamma B (ħ/2) ] - [ - gamma B (ħ/2) ] = gamma B ħ (1/2 + 1/2) ) = gamma B ħ.

The frequency is delta E / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but I thought the frequency would relate to the energy splitting. So that suggests that the oscillation frequency is gamma B. Looking at the options, option B is gamma B. But wait the options given are:

A) gamma*B/2

B) gamma*B

C) sqrt(2)*gamma*B

D) gamma*B/sqrt(2}

So option B is gamma B. But wait, let's not jump to conclusions yet.

Wait, but the initial state is |+z>, which is an equal superposition of |+y> and |-y>. So as time evolves, the phases of these components will change.

The phase difference between the two components is (E_- - E_+ ) t / ħ.

Which is [gamma B ħ ] t / ħ = gamma B t.

So the phase difference is gamma B t.

The expectation value of S_z can be found as:

<S_z> = [ < +y | + < -y | ] * [ e^{i E_+ t/ħ } 0 | ... Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to compute <S_z> in terms of the time-dependent state.

Alternatively, perhaps using time-dependent perturbation theory, but I think in this case since the Hamiltonian is time-independent after the switch, we can use the time evolution more directly.

Wait, but perhaps a smarter approach is to note that the oscillation frequency for the expectation value of S_z under a Hamiltonian H proportional to S_y.

In such a case, the oscillation frequency is determined by the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B. Because when you have a magnetic moment in a magnetic field, the precession frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The Larmor frequency is given by omega_L = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency would be omega = gamma B.

So the frequency is gamma B, which would be option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says the average of the z-component starts oscillating. So I'm measuring <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>.

The time dependence of <S_z> would be proportional to cos(omega t), perhaps, so the frequency would be omega = gamma B.

But wait, in the case where the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. So the system precesses around the Y-axis, leading to oscillations in the expectation values of S_x, S_y, and S_z.

Wait, but in the initial state, the expectation value of S_z is ħ/2. After the field is applied along Y, the state is no longer an eigenstate of S_z, so <S_z> will oscillate.

Let me think about the time evolution again.

The state |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2}.

Each component evolves with a phase factor exp( -i E t / ħ ), where E is the energy of the state.

So the state at time t is:

[ |+y> exp(-i E_+ t/ħ) + |−y> exp( -i E_- t/ħ ) ] / sqrt(2).

E_+ = (-gamma B) (ħ/2) = - ( gamma B ħ ) / 2.

E_- = (+gamma B) (ħ/2) = ( gamma B ħ ) / 2.

So the exponents become:

exp( i (gamma B t / 2 ) ) for |+y>

and 

exp( -i (gamma B t / 2 ) ) for |−y>.

So the state becomes:

[ |+y> e^{i (gamma B t / 2)} + |−y> e^{ -i (gamma B t / 2)} ] / sqrt(2).

Now, to compute <S_z>, which is the expectation value of S_z in this state.

Expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>, S_z can be represented. Let me recall that S_z |+y> and S_z |-y> can be found using the properties of spin operators.

The matrix representation of S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis is:

[ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ].

Wait, no. S_z in the |+y> basis.

Wait, let me think about it. Let's compute S_z |+y> and S_z |-y>.

We know that:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2).

So S_z |+y> = ( S_z |+z> + S_z |-z> ) / sqrt(2) 

= ( (ħ/2) |+z> - (ħ/2) |-z> ) / sqrt(2)

= [ (|+z> - |-z> ) ] * (ħ/2) / sqrt(2)

= (ħ/2) * (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2)

= (ħ/2) * ( (|+y> - 2 |−y> ) / sqrt(2) ) ? Wait no, perhaps more accurately:

Wait, |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Similarly, |-z> = (|+y> - |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

So S_z |+y> = [ (|+z> - |-z> ) ] * (ħ/2) / sqrt(2)

Substituting |+z> and |-z>:

= [ ( (|+y> + |-y> )/sqrt(2) ) - ( (|+y> - |-y> )/sqrt(2) ) ) ] * (ħ/2) / sqrt(2)

Simplify inside the brackets:

= [ ( (|+y> + |-y> ) - (|+y> - |-y> )) / sqrt(2) ) ] * (ħ/2) / sqrt(2)

= [ ( 2 |−y> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] * (ħ/2) / sqrt(2)

= [ 2 |−y> ] / sqrt(2) ) * (ħ/2) / sqrt(2)

= (2 / sqrt(2)) ) * |−y> * (ħ/2) / sqrt(2)

= (sqrt(2)) |−y> * (ħ/2) * 1/sqrt(2)

Wait, let me compute each step carefully.

Let me compute the numerator first:

(|+z> - |-z> ) = [ (|+y> + |-y> )/sqrt(2) ) ] - [ (|+y> - |-y> )/sqrt(2) ) ]

= [ (|+y> + |-y> ) - (|+y> - |-y> ) ] / sqrt(2)

= [ ( |+y> + |-y> - |+y> + |-y> ) ] / sqrt(2)

= [ 2 |-y> ] / sqrt(2)

So S_z |+y> = [ 2 |-y> / sqrt(2) ] * (ħ/2) / sqrt(2)

= [ 2 / sqrt(2) ) * (ħ/2) / sqrt(2) ) ] * |-y>

2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2), and (1/2)/sqrt(2) is 1/(2 sqrt(2)).

But let me compute the constants:

[ 2 / sqrt(2) ] = sqrt(2).

[ (ħ/2) / sqrt(2) ) ] = ħ/(2 sqrt(2)).

So multiplying together: sqrt(2) * ħ / (2 sqrt(2)) ) = ħ/2.

So S_z |+y> = (ħ/2) * |−y> ?

Wait, that can't be right because S_z |+y> is expected to have components in both |+y> and |-y>.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the ladder operators or the Pauli matrices.

Alternatively, the matrix representation of S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis can be found as follows.

Let me denote the basis as |+y>, |-y>.

In this basis, the matrix for S_z would have elements:

[S_z]_{ij} = <i| S_z |j>.

So < +y | S_z | +y > = ?

We know that S_z |+y> = (ħ/2) [ |+z> - |-z> ] / sqrt(2) ?

Wait, perhaps a different approach. Let me write the spin matrices in the computational basis.

In the standard basis (|+z>, |-z>), S_z is diagonal with entries ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

The |+y> and |-y> states are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.

So to find S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis, we can write it as:

[ < +y | S_z | +y >  < +y | S_z | -y > ]

[ < -y | S_z | +y >  < -y | S_z | -y > ]

Which is the matrix representation.

We can compute each element:

< +y | S_z | +y > = (⟨+z| + ⟨-z| ) / sqrt(2) ) S_z (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2)

= [ (⟨+z| S_z |+z> ) + (⟨+z| S_z |-z> ) + (⟨-z| S_z |+z> ) + (⟨-z| S_z |-z> ) ] / 2.

But S_z |+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>, S_z |-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>.

So:

⟨+z| S_z |+z> = ħ/2,

⟨+z| S_z |-z> = 0,

⟨-z| S_z |+z> = 0,

⟨-z| S_z |-z> = -ħ/2.

So the sum becomes ( (ħ/2) + 0 + 0 + (-ħ/2) ) / 2 = 0.

So the (1,1) element is 0.

Similarly, < +y | S_z | -y > = (⟨+z| + ⟨-z| ) / sqrt(2) ) S_z (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2).

Which is [ (⟨+z| S_z |+z> ) - (⟨+z| S_z |-z> ) + (⟨-z| S_z |+z> )) - (⟨-z| S_z |-z> ) ] / 2.

Which is ( (ħ/2) - 0 + 0 - (-ħ/2) ) / 2 = ( ħ/2 + ħ/2 ) / 2 = ħ/(2) * 2 / 2 = ħ/2.

So the (1,2) element is ħ/2.

Similarly, < -y | S_z | +y > = same as the (2,1) element.

Which would be the complex conjugate of (1,2), so also ħ/2.

Lastly, the (2,2) element is < -y | S_z | -y >.

Which is similar to (1,1):

⟨-y | S_z | -y > = (⟨+z| - ⟨-z| ) / sqrt(2) ) S_z (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2).

Which would be [ (⟨+z| S_z |+z> ) - (⟨+z| S_z |-z> ) - (⟨-z| S_z |+z> ) + (⟨-z| S_z |-z> ) ] / 2.

Which becomes ( ħ/2 - 0 -0 - ( - ħ/2 )) / 2 = ( ħ/2 + ħ/2 ) / 2 = ħ/2.

Wait, that can't be right because the trace of S_z in this basis should be zero. Because S_z in the standard basis has trace zero. But according to the matrix I've built, the diagonal elements are 0 and ħ/2, which would sum to ħ/2. That's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recompute.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it differently. The standard S_z matrix is [[ħ/2, 0], [0, -ħ/2]].

The transformation from the standard basis (|+z>, |-z>) to the |+y>, |-y> basis requires a rotation by 90 degrees around the x-axis. The rotation matrix for that is:

cos(theta/2) -sin(theta/2)

sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

With theta = 90 degrees, which is pi/2 radians. So cos(pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2.

So the unitary transformation matrix U is:

[ [cos(pi/4), -sin(pi/4) ],
  [sin(pi/4), cos(pi/4) ] ]

Which is:

[ [sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)/2],
  [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ] ]

So the S_z matrix in the new basis is U† S_z U.

Calculating this:

U† = U^T, since U is real and orthogonal.

So U† = U.

Compute U† S_z U.

Let me compute each element.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each element of the transformed matrix.

The transformed S_z matrix S_z' has elements:

S_z'_{i,j} = sum_{k} U_{i,k} (S_z)_{k,l} U_{j,l}.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute each element.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the rotation around x by 90 degrees takes |+z> to |+y> and |-z> to |-y>.

Or perhaps just accept that S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis is [[0, ħ/2], [ - ħ/2, 0 ] ].

Wait, I think that's correct. Because in the |+y> basis, S_z has off-diagonal elements and the diagonal elements are zero.

So the S_z matrix in this basis is:

[ 0,  ħ/2 ]

[ −ħ/2, 0 ]

So when we compute <S_z> in the state |psi(t)>, which is (|+y> e^{i gamma B t / 2} + |−y> e^{ -i gamma B t / 2 } ) / sqrt(2).

Expressed as a vector, the state is (a, b), where a = e^{i gamma B t / 2 } / sqrt(2), and b = e^{ -i gamma B t / 2 } / sqrt(2).

Then, the expectation value of S_z is given by:

< S_z > = [a*, b*] * S_z_matrix * [a; b]

Which is:

a* * [0 * a + (ħ/2) * b ] + b* * [ (-ħ/2) a + 0 * b ]

= a* ( (ħ/2) b ) + b* ( (- ħ/2) a )

= ( ħ/2 ) [ a* b - b* a ]

Let me compute a and b:

a = e^{i theta} / sqrt(2), where theta = (gamma B t )/2.

b = e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2}.

So a* = e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2}, b* = e^{i theta} / sqrt(2}.

So substituting:

( ħ/2 ) [ ( e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2) ) * (e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2}) ) - ( e^{i theta} / sqrt(2} ) * (e^{i theta} / sqrt(2} )) ) ]

Wait, wait:

Wait, a* is e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2), and b is e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2}.

Wait, no, a is e^{i theta} / sqrt(2), so a* is e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2}.

b is e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2}, so b* is e^{i theta} / sqrt(2}.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check:

a is (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i theta}, so a* is (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i theta}.

Similarly, b is (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i theta}, so b* is (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i theta}.

So substituting into the expression:

( ħ/2 ) [ (e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2)) * (e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2)) ) - ( e^{i theta} / sqrt(2} ) * (e^{i theta} / sqrt(2} ) ) ) ]

Wait, that's not correct. Let me re-express.

Wait, the terms are a* b and b* a.

a* b = (e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2)) ) * (e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2) ) = e^{-i 2 theta} / 2.

b* a = (e^{i theta} / sqrt(2)) ) * (e^{i theta} / sqrt(2) ) = e^{i 2 theta} / 2.

So the expression becomes:

( ħ/2 ) [ e^{-i 2 theta} / 2 - e^{i 2 theta} / 2 ]

= ( ħ/2 ) [ ( e^{-i 2 theta} - e^{i 2 theta} ) / 2 ]

= ( ħ/2 ) [ -2i sin(2 theta) / 2 ]

= ( ħ/2 ) ( -i sin(2 theta) )

Wait, but this is giving an imaginary component, which can't be right because <S_z> should be real.

Ah, I must have made a mistake in the matrix representation. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the expectation value using the state in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

The state is:

|psi(t)> = [ |+y> e^{i theta} + |−y> e^{-i theta} ] / sqrt(2),

where theta = (gamma B t) / 2.

So, to compute <S_z>, which is the same as the expectation value of S_z.

Expressed in the |+y>, |-y> basis, S_z is represented as:

[ [0, ħ/2 ], [-ħ/2, 0 ] ]

So, the state vector is [a, b] = [ e^{i theta} / sqrt(2), e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2) ].

The expectation value is:

a* * (0 * a + (ħ/2) * b ) + b* * ( (-ħ/2) a + 0 * b )

= a* ( (ħ/2) b ) + b* ( (- ħ/2) a )

= (ħ/2) [ a* b - b* a ]

= ( ħ/2 ) [ (e^{-i theta}/sqrt(2)) (e^{-i theta}/sqrt(2)) ) - (e^{i theta}/sqrt(2)) (e^{i theta}/sqrt(2)) ) ]

= ( ħ/2 ) [ (e^{-i 2 theta} ) / 2 - (e^{i 2 theta} ) / 2 )

= ( ħ/2 ) [ ( e^{-i 2 theta} - e^{i 2 theta} ) / 2 ]

= ( ħ/2 ) * ( -i sin(2 theta) ) * 2 / 2 ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute e^{-i 2 theta} - e^{i 2 theta} = -2i sin(2 theta).

So:

( ħ/2 ) * ( -2i sin(2 theta) ) / 2 )

= ( ħ/2 ) * ( -i sin(2 theta) ) * (1/2 )

Wait, wait, let's compute it correctly.

e^{-i x} - e^{i x} = -2i sin x.

So, [ e^{-i 2 theta} - e^{i 2 theta} ] = -2i sin(2 theta).

So,

( ħ/2 ) * [ (-2i sin(2 theta)) ) / 2 ]

= ( ħ/2 ) * ( -i sin(2 theta) ) * (1/2 )

Wait, no. Wait,  [ e^{-i 2 theta} - e^{i 2 theta} ] = -2i sin(2 theta).

So,

( ħ/2 ) [ -2i sin(2 theta) ) / 2 ]

= ( ħ/2 ) * (-i sin(2 theta)) )

= ( ħ/2 ) * (-i) sin(2 theta )

But this is imaginary. That's impossible because expectation values of real observables must be real.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in the matrix representation of S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis.

Wait, perhaps the correct S_z matrix in the |+y>, |-y> basis is:

[ [0, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, 0 ] ]

But that would give symmetric elements. Let me recheck.

Wait, earlier I thought the matrix was [[0, ħ/2], [ - ħ/2, 0 ]], but perhaps it's [[0, ħ/2], [ ħ/2, 0 ] ].

Let me re-express < -y | S_z | +y >.

In the standard basis, |+y> = (|+z> + |-z> )/sqrt(2}, |-y> = (|+z> - |-z> )/sqrt(2}.

So < -y | S_z | +y > = [ (⟨+z| - ⟨-z| ) / sqrt(2} ] S_z [ (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2} ]

= [ (⟨+z| S_z |+z> ) + ⟨+z| S_z |-z> - ⟨-z| S_z |+z> - ⟨-z| S_z |-z> ) ] / 2

Which is [ ( ħ/2 ) + 0 - 0 - (-ħ/2 ) ) ] / 2 

= [ ħ/2 + ħ/2 ) ] / 2 = ħ/(2)

So the (2,1) element is ħ/2, not - ħ/2.

So the correct matrix is:

[ [0, ħ/2 ],
  [ ħ/2, 0 ] ]

So with that, recomputing the expectation value.

< S_z > = a* [0 * a + (ħ/2) b ] + b* [ (ħ/2) a + 0 * b ]

= a* ( (ħ/2) b ) + b* ( (ħ/2) a )

= ( ħ/2 ) [ a* b + b* a ]

= ( ħ/2 ) [ 2 Re( a* b ) ]

= ħ Re( a* b )

Now, a = e^{i theta} / sqrt(2}, b = e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2}.

So a* b = [ e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2} ] [ e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2} ]

= e^{-i 2 theta} / 2.

The real part of this is Re( e^{-i 2 theta} ) = cos(2 theta).

So < S_z > = ħ * [ cos(2 theta) ]

Where theta is (gamma B t )/ 2.

So:

< S_z > = ħ cos( 2 * (gamma B t )/ 2 ) 

= ħ cos( gamma B t )

But wait, the magnetic moment mu is gamma S, so <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>.

So <mu_z> = gamma * ( ħ cos(gamma B t) ) / ħ ?

Wait, no, because S_z has eigenvalues in units of ħ/2. Wait, no, S_z is in units of ħ/2 for spin-1/2. Wait, S_z |+z> = ( ħ/2 ) |+z> .

So, <S_z> has units of ħ/2.

Wait, no, in the calculation above, S_z is in units of ħ/2. So when the matrix is expressed in the |+y> and |-y> basis, the elements are [ [0, ħ/2], [ ħ/2, 0 ] ]

So in the calculation above, when I found <S_z> = ħ cos( gamma B t ), that can't be correct because the maximum value of <S_z> would be ħ, but for spin-1/2, <S_z> should be at most ħ/2.

Ah, I see where I made a mistake.

Because the S_z matrix in the |+y>, |-y> basis is actually:

[ [0, (ħ/2) ], [ (ħ/2), 0 ] ]

So, when I compute <S_z>, it should be:

( ħ/2 ) * [ a* b + b* a ] 

Wait, no, wait. Let me recompute everything correctly.

The correct matrix is:

S_z_matrix = [ [0, ħ/2], [ ħ/2, 0 ] ]

So, to compute < S_z >:

< S_z > = a* (0 * a + (ħ/2) * b ) + b* ( (ħ/2) * a + 0 * b )

= a* ( (ħ/2) b ) + b* ( (ħ/2) a )

= ( ħ/2 ) [ a* b + b* a ]

= ( ħ/2 ) [ 2 Re( a* b ) ]

= ( ħ ) Re( a* b )

a = e^{i theta} / sqrt(2}, b = e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2}.

So a* = e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2}, b = e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2}.

So a* b = [ e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2} ] * [ e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2} ] = e^{-i 2 theta} / 2.

The real part of a* b is cos(2 theta).

So,

< S_z> = ( ħ ) * cos(2 theta) * (1/2 )

Wait, because Re(a* b) = Re( e^{-i 2 theta} / 2 ) = (1/2) cos(2 theta).

So,

< S_z> = ( ħ ) * ( 1/2 ) cos( 2 theta )

= ( ħ/2 ) cos(2 theta )

But theta is (gamma B t ) / 2.

So,

< S_z> = ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

The magnetic moment mu_z is gamma S_z, so:

< mu_z > = gamma * < S_z > = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

So the oscillation is at frequency gamma B.

But wait, the amplitude is (gamma * ħ/2 ), but the frequency is gamma B.

So the average z-component oscillates with frequency gamma B.

Looking back at the options, option B is gamma B. So the correct answer would be option B.

To determine the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, we analyze the system’s dynamics under the given conditions.

### Problem Setup
The particle is a spin-1/2 system with magnetic moment **μ = γS**, where **S** is the spin operator. Initially, the magnetic field **B** points along the +z direction, and the particle is in the eigenstate of **S_z** (aligned with the field). When the field is suddenly switched to point along the +y direction, the Hamiltonian changes from **H_initial = -γB S_z** to **H_final = -γB S_y**. The question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the magnetic moment, **⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩**.

### Key Analysis
1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in the eigenstate of **S_z**, specifically **|+z⟩**, which corresponds to **S_z |+z⟩ = (ħ/2)|+z⟩**.

2. **New Hamiltonian**: After the field is switched to the +y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes **H_final = -γB S_y**. The eigenstates of **S_y** are **|+y⟩** and **|-y⟩**, with eigenvalues **+ħ/2** and **-ħ/2**, respectively.

3. **Time Evolution**: The initial state **|+z⟩** is not an eigenstate of **H_final**. Instead, it can be expressed as a superposition of **|+y⟩** and **|-y⟩**:
   \[
   |+z⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y⟩ + |-y⟩).
   \]
   Under the new Hamiltonian, each component evolves with a phase factor determined by its energy:
   \[
   |\psi(t)⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y⟩ e^{-iE_+/ħ} + |-y⟩ e^{-iE_-/ħ} \right),
   \]
   where **E_+ = γBħ/2** and **E_- = -γBħ/2**.

4. **Oscillation of ⟨S_z⟩**: The expectation value of **S_z** in the state **|\psi(t)⟩** oscillates due to the interference between the two components. The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference between the eigenstates:
   \[
   \Delta E = E_- - E_+ = γBħ.
   \]
   The frequency is then:
   \[
   \omega = \frac{\Delta E}{\hbar} = γB.
   \]

5. **Relation to ⟨μ_z⟩**: Since **⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩**, the oscillation frequency of **⟨μ_z⟩** is the same as that of **⟨S_z⟩**, which is **γB**.

### Evaluation of Options
- **A) γB/2**: Incorrect. The frequency is not halved; it matches the energy splitting.
- **B) γB**: Correct. The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference **ΔE = γBħ**, leading to **ω = γB**.
- **C) √2 γB**: Incorrect. There is no factor of √2 in the frequency.
- **D) γB/√2**: Incorrect. The frequency is not reduced by a factor of √2.

### Final Answer
The oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is **γB**.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spin-1/2 particle and its magnetic moment. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see.

So the setup is that there's a spin 1/2 particle with magnetic moment mu, which is given as gamma times Sz. Oh right, Sz is the spin operator in the z-direction. The magnetic field initially points in the +Z direction, so the particle's magnetic moment is aligned with that. Then, suddenly, the magnetic field is turned off, and another one is turned on along the +Y direction. Both fields have the same magnitude, B. The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment after this change.

Wait, so initially, the magnetic field is along Z. The particle's spin is aligned with it because that's the lowest energy state, I think. So the magnetic moment mu is in the same direction as B. But when the field is turned off, the particle is no longer in a magnetic field, so I guess it's in a state of zero magnetic field. Then, another field is applied along Y. Both fields have the same magnitude, so B remains the same in magnitude but changes direction.

The question is about the oscillation of the average z-component of the moment. So I need to find how the expectation value of the Sz component changes over time.

Wait a second, when the magnetic field changes, the Hamiltonian changes. Initially, the Hamiltonian was H = -mu·B, which for B along Z would be H_initial = -gamma Sz B. But when the field switches to Y, the new Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -gamma Sz B' perhaps? Or wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, mu is the magnetic moment, which is gamma Sz. So the magnetic moment is mu = gamma S_z. Then, the energy is given by the dot product of mu and B. So when B is along Z, H_initial = -mu · B = -gamma S_z B. But when the field is along Y, H_final would be -gamma (S_x B + S_y B + S_z * 0) because B is along Y, so only S_y component is involved. Wait, no, because B is along Y, the direction of the field is (0,1,0). So the dot product would be mu · B = gamma S_z * 0 (since mu is gamma S_z? Wait, wait. No, no, mu is the magnetic moment vector. Oh, wait, wait, mu is defined as gamma S, not just S_z. Oh wait, the question says mu = gamma S_z. Hmm, but that would mean mu is a vector only along z? That can't be right because if B is along Y, then the dot product would involve other components. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, the problem states mu = gamma S_z. Oh, that's unusual because typically, the magnetic moment is a vector, and mu would be gamma multiplied by the spin vector S. So perhaps that's a typo or a misunderstanding. Because if mu is only along z, then when B is along Y, the interaction would be zero. That can't be right because the problem says the average starts oscillating. So perhaps mu is actually the vector gamma times S, not just S_z. Maybe I should read the question again.

The question says: mu = gamma * S_z. Hmm, that would imply that mu is a vector in the z-direction only. But then, when the magnetic field points along Y, the magnetic moment is along Z, so their dot product is zero. So the energy would be zero, implying no Hamiltonian. That can't be possible because then there would be no time evolution, and the average wouldn't oscillate. Hmm. But the problem states that the average starts oscillating, so that suggests that the Hamiltonian does have non-zero components. Thus, perhaps the question has a typo, and mu is actually the vector gamma times S. Because then, mu would be in the same direction as S, which is a vector with components Sx, Sy, Sz.

Assuming that mu is the vector gamma S, then the initial magnetic field along Z would have the interaction H_initial = -mu · B_initial = -gamma S_z B. Then, when the field is turned off, the particle is in a state that's an eigenstate of S_z, but when the field is turned on along Y, the Hamiltonian becomes H_final = -mu · B_final = -gamma S_y B.

Wait, but the problem says that the magnetic field is turned off and then another is turned on. So perhaps the initial state is an eigenstate of H_initial, but after the field changes, the state is no longer an eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian.

Wait, let's think about the time evolution. The particle's state after the field change will determine how its expectation values evolve. Suppose the initial state is |+z>, which is an eigenstate of S_z with eigenvalue ħ/2 (since spin-1/2, so Sz = ħ/2 |+z>). Then, when the field is suddenly changed to Y, the Hamiltonian becomes proportional to S_y. The state |+z> is not an eigenstate of S_y, so it will evolve in time, leading to oscillations in expectation values.

The question is about the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle's moment, which is <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>. So when the state evolves, the expectation value of S_z (and thus mu_z) will oscillate.

To find the frequency, I need to find the energy splitting in the new Hamiltonian. Because the oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference between states, which corresponds to the frequency via E = hbar omega.

So the new Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. Because mu is gamma S, and B is along Y, so mu · B = gamma (S_x*0 + S_y * B + S_z * 0) = gamma B S_y. So H = - (mu · B) = -gamma B S_y. Wait, I think the sign might be important, but perhaps the absolute value will come into play for the frequency.

Wait, the actual form of H is H = - mu · B. So if mu is the magnetic moment vector, and B is the field vector, then H = - mu · B. So if mu = gamma S, then H = -gamma S · B.

So when B is along Y, H = -gamma B S_y.

Now, the eigenstates of S_y are |+y> and |-y>, with eigenvalues +ħ/2 and -ħ/2 respectively. So the energy eigenvalues are E_+ = -gamma B (ħ/2), and E_- = gamma B (ħ/2), because H = -gamma B S_y. So E_+ = (-gamma B) * (ħ/2), and E_- = (-gamma B) * (-ħ/2) = gamma B ħ/2.

Wait no, wait: S_y |+y> = (ħ/2) |+y>, so H |+y> = (-gamma B) * (ħ/2) |+y> = E_+ |+y>. So E_+ is (-gamma B) (ħ/2), and E_- is (+gamma B) (ħ/2).

The energy difference between these two states is E_- - E_+ = [gamma B (ħ/2)] - [ - gamma B (ħ/2) ] = gamma B ħ.

The transition frequency is delta E / hbar. So delta E is gamma B ħ, so frequency is (gamma B ħ ) / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, that can't be right because the problem states that the average of the z-component oscillates. Let me think about the time evolution.

The initial state is |+z>. After the field is switched to Y, the state is still |+z> at t=0^+. So we can express |+z> in terms of the eigenstates of H (which are |+y> and |-y>).

The eigenstates of H are |+y> and |-y>, and their corresponding energies are E_+ and E_-.

So |+z> can be written as a combination of |+y> and |-y>.

The time evolution of a state is given by each component evolving with their respective phase factors.

So |psi(t)> = c_+ |+y> e^{-i E_+ t / ħ} + c_- |−y> e^{-i E_- t / ħ}.

The coefficients c_+ and c_- are determined by expanding |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

The expansion coefficients for |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y> are known. Let me recall that:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt{2}
|-y> = (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt{2}

So solving for |+z> in terms of |+y> and |-y>:

|+z> = (|+y> + |-y>) ) / sqrt{2}.

So c_+ = 1/sqrt(2), c_- = 1/sqrt(2).

Wait, let me check: 

Expressing |+y> as (|+z> + |-z>)/√2, and |-y> as (|+z> - |-z>)/√2.

Then, |+z> = (|+y> + |-y>)/√2.

Yes, that's correct. So the coefficients are 1/sqrt(2) for both |+y> and |-y>.

So the state becomes:

|psi(t)> = [ |+y> e^{-i E_+ t/ħ } + |−y> e^{-i E_- t/ħ } ] / sqrt(2).

The expectation value of S_z is <S_z> = <psi(t)| S_z |psi(t)>.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the expectation value of S_z in the state |psi(t)>, given the expansion.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a smarter approach. The time evolution under the Hamiltonian H = -gamma B S_y will cause transitions between |+y> and |-y>, which are the eigenstates.

But since the initial state is |+z>, which is a superposition of |+y> and |-y>, the state |psi(t)> will precess in time, leading to oscillations in various observables, including <S_z>.

The oscillation frequency of <S_z> is determined by the energy difference between the eigenstates. The energy difference is E_- - E_+ = [gamma B (ħ/2) ] - [ - gamma B (ħ/2) ] = gamma B ħ (1/2 + 1/2) ) = gamma B ħ.

The frequency is delta E / ħ = gamma B.

Wait, but I thought the frequency would relate to the energy splitting. So that suggests that the oscillation frequency is gamma B. Looking at the options, option B is gamma B. But wait the options given are:

A) gamma*B/2

B) gamma*B

C) sqrt(2)*gamma*B

D) gamma*B/sqrt(2}

So option B is gamma B. But wait, let's not jump to conclusions yet.

Wait, but the initial state is |+z>, which is an equal superposition of |+y> and |-y>. So as time evolves, the phases of these components will change.

The phase difference between the two components is (E_- - E_+ ) t / ħ.

Which is [gamma B ħ ] t / ħ = gamma B t.

So the phase difference is gamma B t.

The expectation value of S_z can be found as:

<S_z> = [ < +y | + < -y | ] * [ e^{i E_+ t/ħ } 0 | ... Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to compute <S_z> in terms of the time-dependent state.

Alternatively, perhaps using time-dependent perturbation theory, but I think in this case since the Hamiltonian is time-independent after the switch, we can use the time evolution more directly.

Wait, but perhaps a smarter approach is to note that the oscillation frequency for the expectation value of S_z under a Hamiltonian H proportional to S_y.

In such a case, the oscillation frequency is determined by the Larmor frequency, which is gamma B. Because when you have a magnetic moment in a magnetic field, the precession frequency is gamma B.

Wait, but wait. The Larmor frequency is given by omega_L = gamma B. So the oscillation frequency would be omega = gamma B.

So the frequency is gamma B, which would be option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem says the average of the z-component starts oscillating. So I'm measuring <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>.

The time dependence of <S_z> would be proportional to cos(omega t), perhaps, so the frequency would be omega = gamma B.

But wait, in the case where the magnetic field is along Y, the Hamiltonian is H = -gamma B S_y. So the system precesses around the Y-axis, leading to oscillations in the expectation values of S_x, S_y, and S_z.

Wait, but in the initial state, the expectation value of S_z is ħ/2. After the field is applied along Y, the state is no longer an eigenstate of S_z, so <S_z> will oscillate.

Let me think about the time evolution again.

The state |+z> can be written as (|+y> + |-y>)/sqrt(2}.

Each component evolves with a phase factor exp( -i E t / ħ ), where E is the energy of the state.

So the state at time t is:

[ |+y> exp(-i E_+ t/ħ) + |−y> exp( -i E_- t/ħ ) ] / sqrt(2).

E_+ = (-gamma B) (ħ/2) = - ( gamma B ħ ) / 2.

E_- = (+gamma B) (ħ/2) = ( gamma B ħ ) / 2.

So the exponents become:

exp( i (gamma B t / 2 ) ) for |+y>

and 

exp( -i (gamma B t / 2 ) ) for |−y>.

So the state becomes:

[ |+y> e^{i (gamma B t / 2)} + |−y> e^{ -i (gamma B t / 2)} ] / sqrt(2).

Now, to compute <S_z>, which is the expectation value of S_z in this state.

Expressed in terms of |+y> and |-y>, S_z can be represented. Let me recall that S_z |+y> and S_z |-y> can be found using the properties of spin operators.

The matrix representation of S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis is:

[ [0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0] ].

Wait, no. S_z in the |+y> basis.

Wait, let me think about it. Let's compute S_z |+y> and S_z |-y>.

We know that:

|+y> = (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2).

So S_z |+y> = ( S_z |+z> + S_z |-z> ) / sqrt(2) 

= ( (ħ/2) |+z> - (ħ/2) |-z> ) / sqrt(2)

= [ (|+z> - |-z> ) ] * (ħ/2) / sqrt(2)

= (ħ/2) * (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2)

= (ħ/2) * ( (|+y> - 2 |−y> ) / sqrt(2) ) ? Wait no, perhaps more accurately:

Wait, |+z> = (|+y> + |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

Similarly, |-z> = (|+y> - |-y> ) / sqrt(2).

So S_z |+y> = [ (|+z> - |-z> ) ] * (ħ/2) / sqrt(2)

Substituting |+z> and |-z>:

= [ ( (|+y> + |-y> )/sqrt(2) ) - ( (|+y> - |-y> )/sqrt(2) ) ) ] * (ħ/2) / sqrt(2)

Simplify inside the brackets:

= [ ( (|+y> + |-y> ) - (|+y> - |-y> )) / sqrt(2) ) ] * (ħ/2) / sqrt(2)

= [ ( 2 |−y> ) / sqrt(2) ) ] * (ħ/2) / sqrt(2)

= [ 2 |−y> ] / sqrt(2) ) * (ħ/2) / sqrt(2)

= (2 / sqrt(2)) ) * |−y> * (ħ/2) / sqrt(2)

= (sqrt(2)) |−y> * (ħ/2) * 1/sqrt(2)

Wait, let me compute each step carefully.

Let me compute the numerator first:

(|+z> - |-z> ) = [ (|+y> + |-y> )/sqrt(2) ) ] - [ (|+y> - |-y> )/sqrt(2) ) ]

= [ (|+y> + |-y> ) - (|+y> - |-y> ) ] / sqrt(2)

= [ ( |+y> + |-y> - |+y> + |-y> ) ] / sqrt(2)

= [ 2 |-y> ] / sqrt(2)

So S_z |+y> = [ 2 |-y> / sqrt(2) ] * (ħ/2) / sqrt(2)

= [ 2 / sqrt(2) ) * (ħ/2) / sqrt(2) ) ] * |-y>

2/sqrt(2) is sqrt(2), and (1/2)/sqrt(2) is 1/(2 sqrt(2)).

But let me compute the constants:

[ 2 / sqrt(2) ] = sqrt(2).

[ (ħ/2) / sqrt(2) ) ] = ħ/(2 sqrt(2)).

So multiplying together: sqrt(2) * ħ / (2 sqrt(2)) ) = ħ/2.

So S_z |+y> = (ħ/2) * |−y> ?

Wait, that can't be right because S_z |+y> is expected to have components in both |+y> and |-y>.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the ladder operators or the Pauli matrices.

Alternatively, the matrix representation of S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis can be found as follows.

Let me denote the basis as |+y>, |-y>.

In this basis, the matrix for S_z would have elements:

[S_z]_{ij} = <i| S_z |j>.

So < +y | S_z | +y > = ?

We know that S_z |+y> = (ħ/2) [ |+z> - |-z> ] / sqrt(2) ?

Wait, perhaps a different approach. Let me write the spin matrices in the computational basis.

In the standard basis (|+z>, |-z>), S_z is diagonal with entries ħ/2 and -ħ/2.

The |+y> and |-y> states are superpositions of |+z> and |-z>.

So to find S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis, we can write it as:

[ < +y | S_z | +y >  < +y | S_z | -y > ]

[ < -y | S_z | +y >  < -y | S_z | -y > ]

Which is the matrix representation.

We can compute each element:

< +y | S_z | +y > = (⟨+z| + ⟨-z| ) / sqrt(2) ) S_z (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2)

= [ (⟨+z| S_z |+z> ) + (⟨+z| S_z |-z> ) + (⟨-z| S_z |+z> ) + (⟨-z| S_z |-z> ) ] / 2.

But S_z |+z> = (ħ/2)|+z>, S_z |-z> = (-ħ/2)|-z>.

So:

⟨+z| S_z |+z> = ħ/2,

⟨+z| S_z |-z> = 0,

⟨-z| S_z |+z> = 0,

⟨-z| S_z |-z> = -ħ/2.

So the sum becomes ( (ħ/2) + 0 + 0 + (-ħ/2) ) / 2 = 0.

So the (1,1) element is 0.

Similarly, < +y | S_z | -y > = (⟨+z| + ⟨-z| ) / sqrt(2) ) S_z (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2).

Which is [ (⟨+z| S_z |+z> ) - (⟨+z| S_z |-z> ) + (⟨-z| S_z |+z> )) - (⟨-z| S_z |-z> ) ] / 2.

Which is ( (ħ/2) - 0 + 0 - (-ħ/2) ) / 2 = ( ħ/2 + ħ/2 ) / 2 = ħ/(2) * 2 / 2 = ħ/2.

So the (1,2) element is ħ/2.

Similarly, < -y | S_z | +y > = same as the (2,1) element.

Which would be the complex conjugate of (1,2), so also ħ/2.

Lastly, the (2,2) element is < -y | S_z | -y >.

Which is similar to (1,1):

⟨-y | S_z | -y > = (⟨+z| - ⟨-z| ) / sqrt(2) ) S_z (|+z> - |-z> ) / sqrt(2).

Which would be [ (⟨+z| S_z |+z> ) - (⟨+z| S_z |-z> ) - (⟨-z| S_z |+z> ) + (⟨-z| S_z |-z> ) ] / 2.

Which becomes ( ħ/2 - 0 -0 - ( - ħ/2 )) / 2 = ( ħ/2 + ħ/2 ) / 2 = ħ/2.

Wait, that can't be right because the trace of S_z in this basis should be zero. Because S_z in the standard basis has trace zero. But according to the matrix I've built, the diagonal elements are 0 and ħ/2, which would sum to ħ/2. That's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recompute.

Wait, perhaps I should think about it differently. The standard S_z matrix is [[ħ/2, 0], [0, -ħ/2]].

The transformation from the standard basis (|+z>, |-z>) to the |+y>, |-y> basis requires a rotation by 90 degrees around the x-axis. The rotation matrix for that is:

cos(theta/2) -sin(theta/2)

sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

With theta = 90 degrees, which is pi/2 radians. So cos(pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(pi/4) = sqrt(2)/2.

So the unitary transformation matrix U is:

[ [cos(pi/4), -sin(pi/4) ],
  [sin(pi/4), cos(pi/4) ] ]

Which is:

[ [sqrt(2)/2, -sqrt(2)/2],
  [sqrt(2)/2, sqrt(2)/2 ] ]

So the S_z matrix in the new basis is U† S_z U.

Calculating this:

U† = U^T, since U is real and orthogonal.

So U† = U.

Compute U† S_z U.

Let me compute each element.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute each element of the transformed matrix.

The transformed S_z matrix S_z' has elements:

S_z'_{i,j} = sum_{k} U_{i,k} (S_z)_{k,l} U_{j,l}.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute each element.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the rotation around x by 90 degrees takes |+z> to |+y> and |-z> to |-y>.

Or perhaps just accept that S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis is [[0, ħ/2], [ - ħ/2, 0 ] ].

Wait, I think that's correct. Because in the |+y> basis, S_z has off-diagonal elements and the diagonal elements are zero.

So the S_z matrix in this basis is:

[ 0,  ħ/2 ]

[ −ħ/2, 0 ]

So when we compute <S_z> in the state |psi(t)>, which is (|+y> e^{i gamma B t / 2} + |−y> e^{ -i gamma B t / 2 } ) / sqrt(2).

Expressed as a vector, the state is (a, b), where a = e^{i gamma B t / 2 } / sqrt(2), and b = e^{ -i gamma B t / 2 } / sqrt(2).

Then, the expectation value of S_z is given by:

< S_z > = [a*, b*] * S_z_matrix * [a; b]

Which is:

a* * [0 * a + (ħ/2) * b ] + b* * [ (-ħ/2) a + 0 * b ]

= a* ( (ħ/2) b ) + b* ( (- ħ/2) a )

= ( ħ/2 ) [ a* b - b* a ]

Let me compute a and b:

a = e^{i theta} / sqrt(2), where theta = (gamma B t )/2.

b = e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2}.

So a* = e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2}, b* = e^{i theta} / sqrt(2}.

So substituting:

( ħ/2 ) [ ( e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2) ) * (e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2}) ) - ( e^{i theta} / sqrt(2} ) * (e^{i theta} / sqrt(2} )) ) ]

Wait, wait:

Wait, a* is e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2), and b is e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2}.

Wait, no, a is e^{i theta} / sqrt(2), so a* is e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2}.

b is e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2}, so b* is e^{i theta} / sqrt(2}.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check:

a is (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i theta}, so a* is (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i theta}.

Similarly, b is (1/sqrt(2)) e^{-i theta}, so b* is (1/sqrt(2)) e^{i theta}.

So substituting into the expression:

( ħ/2 ) [ (e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2)) * (e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2)) ) - ( e^{i theta} / sqrt(2} ) * (e^{i theta} / sqrt(2} ) ) ) ]

Wait, that's not correct. Let me re-express.

Wait, the terms are a* b and b* a.

a* b = (e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2)) ) * (e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2) ) = e^{-i 2 theta} / 2.

b* a = (e^{i theta} / sqrt(2)) ) * (e^{i theta} / sqrt(2) ) = e^{i 2 theta} / 2.

So the expression becomes:

( ħ/2 ) [ e^{-i 2 theta} / 2 - e^{i 2 theta} / 2 ]

= ( ħ/2 ) [ ( e^{-i 2 theta} - e^{i 2 theta} ) / 2 ]

= ( ħ/2 ) [ -2i sin(2 theta) / 2 ]

= ( ħ/2 ) ( -i sin(2 theta) )

Wait, but this is giving an imaginary component, which can't be right because <S_z> should be real.

Ah, I must have made a mistake in the matrix representation. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps a better way is to compute the expectation value using the state in terms of |+y> and |-y>.

The state is:

|psi(t)> = [ |+y> e^{i theta} + |−y> e^{-i theta} ] / sqrt(2),

where theta = (gamma B t) / 2.

So, to compute <S_z>, which is the same as the expectation value of S_z.

Expressed in the |+y>, |-y> basis, S_z is represented as:

[ [0, ħ/2 ], [-ħ/2, 0 ] ]

So, the state vector is [a, b] = [ e^{i theta} / sqrt(2), e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2) ].

The expectation value is:

a* * (0 * a + (ħ/2) * b ) + b* * ( (-ħ/2) a + 0 * b )

= a* ( (ħ/2) b ) + b* ( (- ħ/2) a )

= (ħ/2) [ a* b - b* a ]

= ( ħ/2 ) [ (e^{-i theta}/sqrt(2)) (e^{-i theta}/sqrt(2)) ) - (e^{i theta}/sqrt(2)) (e^{i theta}/sqrt(2)) ) ]

= ( ħ/2 ) [ (e^{-i 2 theta} ) / 2 - (e^{i 2 theta} ) / 2 )

= ( ħ/2 ) [ ( e^{-i 2 theta} - e^{i 2 theta} ) / 2 ]

= ( ħ/2 ) * ( -i sin(2 theta) ) * 2 / 2 ?

Wait, perhaps I should compute e^{-i 2 theta} - e^{i 2 theta} = -2i sin(2 theta).

So:

( ħ/2 ) * ( -2i sin(2 theta) ) / 2 )

= ( ħ/2 ) * ( -i sin(2 theta) ) * (1/2 )

Wait, wait, let's compute it correctly.

e^{-i x} - e^{i x} = -2i sin x.

So, [ e^{-i 2 theta} - e^{i 2 theta} ] = -2i sin(2 theta).

So,

( ħ/2 ) * [ (-2i sin(2 theta)) ) / 2 ]

= ( ħ/2 ) * ( -i sin(2 theta) ) * (1/2 )

Wait, no. Wait,  [ e^{-i 2 theta} - e^{i 2 theta} ] = -2i sin(2 theta).

So,

( ħ/2 ) [ -2i sin(2 theta) ) / 2 ]

= ( ħ/2 ) * (-i sin(2 theta)) )

= ( ħ/2 ) * (-i) sin(2 theta )

But this is imaginary. That's impossible because expectation values of real observables must be real.

Hmm, that suggests I made a mistake in the matrix representation of S_z in the |+y>, |-y> basis.

Wait, perhaps the correct S_z matrix in the |+y>, |-y> basis is:

[ [0, ħ/2 ], [ ħ/2, 0 ] ]

But that would give symmetric elements. Let me recheck.

Wait, earlier I thought the matrix was [[0, ħ/2], [ - ħ/2, 0 ]], but perhaps it's [[0, ħ/2], [ ħ/2, 0 ] ].

Let me re-express < -y | S_z | +y >.

In the standard basis, |+y> = (|+z> + |-z> )/sqrt(2}, |-y> = (|+z> - |-z> )/sqrt(2}.

So < -y | S_z | +y > = [ (⟨+z| - ⟨-z| ) / sqrt(2} ] S_z [ (|+z> + |-z> ) / sqrt(2} ]

= [ (⟨+z| S_z |+z> ) + ⟨+z| S_z |-z> - ⟨-z| S_z |+z> - ⟨-z| S_z |-z> ) ] / 2

Which is [ ( ħ/2 ) + 0 - 0 - (-ħ/2 ) ) ] / 2 

= [ ħ/2 + ħ/2 ) ] / 2 = ħ/(2)

So the (2,1) element is ħ/2, not - ħ/2.

So the correct matrix is:

[ [0, ħ/2 ],
  [ ħ/2, 0 ] ]

So with that, recomputing the expectation value.

< S_z > = a* [0 * a + (ħ/2) b ] + b* [ (ħ/2) a + 0 * b ]

= a* ( (ħ/2) b ) + b* ( (ħ/2) a )

= ( ħ/2 ) [ a* b + b* a ]

= ( ħ/2 ) [ 2 Re( a* b ) ]

= ħ Re( a* b )

Now, a = e^{i theta} / sqrt(2}, b = e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2}.

So a* b = [ e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2} ] [ e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2} ]

= e^{-i 2 theta} / 2.

The real part of this is Re( e^{-i 2 theta} ) = cos(2 theta).

So < S_z > = ħ * [ cos(2 theta) ]

Where theta is (gamma B t )/ 2.

So:

< S_z > = ħ cos( 2 * (gamma B t )/ 2 ) 

= ħ cos( gamma B t )

But wait, the magnetic moment mu is gamma S, so <mu_z> = gamma <S_z>.

So <mu_z> = gamma * ( ħ cos(gamma B t) ) / ħ ?

Wait, no, because S_z has eigenvalues in units of ħ/2. Wait, no, S_z is in units of ħ/2 for spin-1/2. Wait, S_z |+z> = ( ħ/2 ) |+z> .

So, <S_z> has units of ħ/2.

Wait, no, in the calculation above, S_z is in units of ħ/2. So when the matrix is expressed in the |+y> and |-y> basis, the elements are [ [0, ħ/2], [ ħ/2, 0 ] ]

So in the calculation above, when I found <S_z> = ħ cos( gamma B t ), that can't be correct because the maximum value of <S_z> would be ħ, but for spin-1/2, <S_z> should be at most ħ/2.

Ah, I see where I made a mistake.

Because the S_z matrix in the |+y>, |-y> basis is actually:

[ [0, (ħ/2) ], [ (ħ/2), 0 ] ]

So, when I compute <S_z>, it should be:

( ħ/2 ) * [ a* b + b* a ] 

Wait, no, wait. Let me recompute everything correctly.

The correct matrix is:

S_z_matrix = [ [0, ħ/2], [ ħ/2, 0 ] ]

So, to compute < S_z >:

< S_z > = a* (0 * a + (ħ/2) * b ) + b* ( (ħ/2) * a + 0 * b )

= a* ( (ħ/2) b ) + b* ( (ħ/2) a )

= ( ħ/2 ) [ a* b + b* a ]

= ( ħ/2 ) [ 2 Re( a* b ) ]

= ( ħ ) Re( a* b )

a = e^{i theta} / sqrt(2}, b = e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2}.

So a* = e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2}, b = e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2}.

So a* b = [ e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2} ] * [ e^{-i theta} / sqrt(2} ] = e^{-i 2 theta} / 2.

The real part of a* b is cos(2 theta).

So,

< S_z> = ( ħ ) * cos(2 theta) * (1/2 )

Wait, because Re(a* b) = Re( e^{-i 2 theta} / 2 ) = (1/2) cos(2 theta).

So,

< S_z> = ( ħ ) * ( 1/2 ) cos( 2 theta )

= ( ħ/2 ) cos(2 theta )

But theta is (gamma B t ) / 2.

So,

< S_z> = ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

The magnetic moment mu_z is gamma S_z, so:

< mu_z > = gamma * < S_z > = gamma * ( ħ/2 ) cos( gamma B t )

So the oscillation is at frequency gamma B.

But wait, the amplitude is (gamma * ħ/2 ), but the frequency is gamma B.

So the average z-component oscillates with frequency gamma B.

Looking back at the options, option B is gamma B. So the correct answer would be option B.


To determine the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment, we analyze the system’s dynamics under the given conditions.

### Problem Setup
The particle is a spin-1/2 system with magnetic moment **μ = γS**, where **S** is the spin operator. Initially, the magnetic field **B** points along the +z direction, and the particle is in the eigenstate of **S_z** (aligned with the field). When the field is suddenly switched to point along the +y direction, the Hamiltonian changes from **H_initial = -γB S_z** to **H_final = -γB S_y**. The question asks for the oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the magnetic moment, **⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩**.

### Key Analysis
1. **Initial State**: The particle starts in the eigenstate of **S_z**, specifically **|+z⟩**, which corresponds to **S_z |+z⟩ = (ħ/2)|+z⟩**.

2. **New Hamiltonian**: After the field is switched to the +y direction, the Hamiltonian becomes **H_final = -γB S_y**. The eigenstates of **S_y** are **|+y⟩** and **|-y⟩**, with eigenvalues **+ħ/2** and **-ħ/2**, respectively.

3. **Time Evolution**: The initial state **|+z⟩** is not an eigenstate of **H_final**. Instead, it can be expressed as a superposition of **|+y⟩** and **|-y⟩**:
   \[
   |+z⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|+y⟩ + |-y⟩).
   \]
   Under the new Hamiltonian, each component evolves with a phase factor determined by its energy:
   \[
   |\psi(t)⟩ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |+y⟩ e^{-iE_+/ħ} + |-y⟩ e^{-iE_-/ħ} \right),
   \]
   where **E_+ = γBħ/2** and **E_- = -γBħ/2**.

4. **Oscillation of ⟨S_z⟩**: The expectation value of **S_z** in the state **|\psi(t)⟩** oscillates due to the interference between the two components. The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference between the eigenstates:
   \[
   \Delta E = E_- - E_+ = γBħ.
   \]
   The frequency is then:
   \[
   \omega = \frac{\Delta E}{\hbar} = γB.
   \]

5. **Relation to ⟨μ_z⟩**: Since **⟨μ_z⟩ = γ⟨S_z⟩**, the oscillation frequency of **⟨μ_z⟩** is the same as that of **⟨S_z⟩**, which is **γB**.

### Evaluation of Options
- **A) γB/2**: Incorrect. The frequency is not halved; it matches the energy splitting.
- **B) γB**: Correct. The oscillation frequency is determined by the energy difference **ΔE = γBħ**, leading to **ω = γB**.
- **C) √2 γB**: Incorrect. There is no factor of √2 in the frequency.
- **D) γB/√2**: Incorrect. The frequency is not reduced by a factor of √2.

### Final Answer
The oscillation frequency of the average z-component of the particle’s magnetic moment is **γB**.

**Answer: B**
