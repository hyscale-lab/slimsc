Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let me think. The question says the Hamiltonian is H equals epsilon times the dot product of sigma vector and n vector. Oh wait, right, sigma are the Pauli matrices. 

So, I remember that the Pauli matrices are sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. The dot product with n, which is a unit vector, probably means that n is (n_x, n_y, n_z), and the sigma vector is (sigma_x, sigma_y, sigma_z). So the Hamiltonian would be epsilon times (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z).

Wait, the problem is asking for the eigenvalues of H. I think for any 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues can be found by solving the characteristic equation det(H - λI) = 0.

Alternatively, I remember that the Pauli matrices are Hermitian, and their trace is zero, and determinant is -1. Also, each sigma_i has eigenvalues +1 and -1. But when you take a linear combination, like a sigma_x + b sigma_y + c sigma_z, maybe the eigenvalues are determined by the magnitude of that vector.

Wait, the general form is H = epsilon * (n · sigma). Since n is a unit vector, the expression inside is like a vector in spin space. Oh right, for spin-1/2 particles, the spin component in the direction of n would have eigenvalues ±(ħ/2). But wait, wait. Wait, the Pauli matrices are dimensionless, right? Or wait, no, the Pauli matrices when multiplied by something else might have energy dimensions.

Wait, the Hamiltonian has units of energy. The Pauli matrices are dimensionless because they're matrices, so the scaling factor must have units of energy. Epsilon is given as an energy constant. So H is proportional to the Pauli matrices scaled by epsilon.

Wait, the eigenvalues of a matrix like n · sigma would be ±1, because each sigma_i has eigenvalues ±1, and the linear combination would have the same. So if H is epsilon times that, then the eigenvalues would be ±epsilon.

Wait, but wait another thing. The Pauli matrices have eigenvalues plus and minus 1. So when you have a linear combination like a·σ where a is a 3-vector (like n, a unit vector), the eigenvalues of that matrix are ±|a|. But wait, a is a unit vector, so |a|=1, so the eigenvalues are ±1. So the eigenvalues of H would be epsilon times that, so ±epsilon.

Wait, but the options have some with factors of hbar. Hmm. So am I forgetting Planck's constant here? No, wait, the Pauli matrices are sometimes represented with factors of ħ. Oh wait, in some conventions, the spin matrices are written as sigma = 2s/(ħ), but I'm not sure. Or wait, the spin operator S is ħ/2 times sigma. Oh right, because S = (ħ/2) sigma. So the eigenvalues of S are ±ħ/2. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is H = epsilon sigma · n. So if sigma is the Pauli matrices, then the eigenvalues would be ±epsilon. Because the eigenvalues of sigma · n are ±1.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused because sometimes the spin matrices include a factor of ħ/2. Let me think: the spin operator is S = (ħ/2) sigma. So if the Hamiltonian was proportional to S · n, then the eigenvalues would be ± epsilon (ħ/2). But in this problem, H is given as epsilon sigma · n, so without the ħ/2 factor. So the eigenvalues are ± epsilon.

Looking at the options:

Option A: ±1. That can't be right because the scaling is by epsilon, which is an energy. So the eigenvalues should have units of energy. So A's units wouldn't match because 1 is dimensionless.

Option B: ±epsilon. That seems right based on what I thought.

Option C: ±epsilon hbar/2. Hmm, that would be if the sigma were scaled by hbar/2, but they aren't. So that's probably not it.

Option D: ±hbar/2. No, that would be if the Hamiltonian was (hbar/2) sigma · n, but here it's epsilon times that.

So the correct eigenvalues should be ±epsilon. So the answer is option B.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, \(\varepsilon\) is an energy constant, and \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian can be determined by analyzing the structure of the operator.

The Pauli matrices (\(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), \(\sigma_z\)) are Hermitian and have eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). The dot product \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) represents a linear combination of the Pauli matrices weighted by the components of \(\vec{n}\). Since \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(\pm 1\). When scaled by \(\varepsilon\), the eigenvalues of \(H\) become \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: \(+1, -1\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues must have the dimension of energy, and \(\pm 1\) is dimensionless.
- **Option B**: \(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\) is correct, as the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(\pm 1\), and scaling by \(\varepsilon\) gives \(\pm \varepsilon\).
- **Option C**: \(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\) is incorrect because the Hamiltonian does not include a factor of \(\hbar/2\), which would arise if the Pauli matrices were scaled by \(\hbar/2\) (e.g., in the spin operator \(S = (\hbar/2) \vec{\sigma}\)).
- **Option D**: \(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\) is incorrect because this would correspond to the eigenvalues of the spin operator \(S \cdot \vec{n}\), not the given Hamiltonian.

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian \(H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(+\varepsilon\) and \(-\varepsilon\).

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, \(\varepsilon\) is an energy constant, and \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices. The eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian can be determined by analyzing the structure of the operator.

The Pauli matrices (\(\sigma_x\), \(\sigma_y\), \(\sigma_z\)) are Hermitian and have eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). The dot product \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) represents a linear combination of the Pauli matrices weighted by the components of \(\vec{n}\). Since \(\vec{n}\) is a unit vector, the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(\pm 1\). When scaled by \(\varepsilon\), the eigenvalues of \(H\) become \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: \(+1, -1\) is incorrect because the eigenvalues must have the dimension of energy, and \(\pm 1\) is dimensionless.
- **Option B**: \(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\) is correct, as the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(\pm 1\), and scaling by \(\varepsilon\) gives \(\pm \varepsilon\).
- **Option C**: \(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\) is incorrect because the Hamiltonian does not include a factor of \(\hbar/2\), which would arise if the Pauli matrices were scaled by \(\hbar/2\) (e.g., in the spin operator \(S = (\hbar/2) \vec{\sigma}\)).
- **Option D**: \(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\) is incorrect because this would correspond to the eigenvalues of the spin operator \(S \cdot \vec{n}\), not the given Hamiltonian.

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian \(H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are \(+\varepsilon\) and \(-\varepsilon\).
