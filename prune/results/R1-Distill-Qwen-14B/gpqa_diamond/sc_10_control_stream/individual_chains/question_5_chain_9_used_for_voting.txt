Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

The question says that we're dealing with a muon, but I think the particle type might not matter here since we're dealing with operators. The operator in question is P, and we need the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh wait, the operator P is probably the angular momentum operator because it's being projected along a certain direction. But wait, the problem gives the components P_x, P_y, and P_z as specific 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

So first, I should write down what each component is. Let me see:

- P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. That looks familiar, it's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2.
- P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]]. That's the Pauli Y matrix scaled.
- P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Pauli Z scaled.

So the operator P is a vector operator, meaning it's given as P = x P_x + y P_y + z P_z, but the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. Wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so the direction vector can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

So the operator along direction n is P·n = P_x * (n_x) + P_y * (n_y) + P_z * (n_z). But since n_y is zero, the operator simplifies to P_x * sinθ + P_z * cosθ.

Our goal is to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Because the eigenvalues of these Pauli matrices are ±1 times the scaling factor, which is ħ/2 here. So the possible eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So for the + case, we're looking for the eigenvector when P·n acts on it gives (ħ/2) times the same vector.

So to proceed, I need to construct the matrix for P·n. Let's compute it:

P·n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Breaking that down, let's compute each part:

The sinθ term is (ħ/2) * [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
The cosθ term is (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]
Adding them together, the matrix becomes:

[[ (ħ/2) cosθ , (ħ/2) sinθ ],
 [ (ħ/2) sinθ , -(ħ/2) cosθ ] ]

Wait, wait, no. Let me recalculate. Wait, the matrices are:

P_x matrix: [[0,1],[1,0]]
Multiply by sinθ: sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Similarly, P_z matrix is [[1,0],[0,-1]]
Multiply by cosθ: cosθ* [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So when we sum these, it's:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

But each element is multiplied by ħ/2. So the entire matrix is (ħ/2) times the above.

Wait, no. Because each component is multiplied by (ħ/2). So when we add P_x * sinθ and P_z * cosθ, each element is scaled by (ħ/2). So the matrix is (ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, no, wait. Let's compute each term properly.

P_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], multiplied by sinθ.

So that gives [[0*sinθ, 1*sinθ],[1*sinθ, 0*sinθ]] = [[0, sinθ],[sinθ, 0]]

P_z matrix is [[1,0],[0,-1]], multiplied by cosθ.

So that's [[cosθ, 0],[0,-cosθ]]

Adding these two matrices together:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So the total matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) multiplied by this:

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So the operator matrix is:

(ħ/2) * [[ cosθ, sinθ ],
          [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Now, the eigenvalue equation is:

P·n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2) [[ cosθ, sinθ ],
        [ sinθ, -cosθ ]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can cancel out the (ħ/2) from both sides, so:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So, (cosθ * a + sinθ * b) = a
(sinθ * a - cosθ * b) = b

Let me write these as equations:

1) cosθ a + sinθ b = a
2) sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Rearranging equation 1:

cosθ a + sinθ b - a = 0
a (cosθ - 1) + b sinθ = 0

Similarly, equation 2:

sinθ a - cosθ b - b = 0
sinθ a - b (cosθ + 1) = 0

So now we have two equations:

a (cosθ - 1) = - b sinθ   --> equation A
sinθ a = b (cosθ + 1)     --> equation B

Let me substitute equation A into equation B. From equation A:

a = [ - b sinθ ] / (cosθ - 1 )

Substitute into equation B:

sinθ * [ (-b sinθ) / (cosθ - 1) ) ] = b (cosθ + 1 )

Simplify numerator:

- b sin²θ / (cosθ - 1) = b (cosθ + 1 )

Assuming b is not zero (since if b is zero, then from equation 1, a (cosθ - 1) =0. If a is non-zero, then cosθ =1, which would mean θ=0, but let's check later for that case.)

So divide both sides by b:

- sin²θ / (cosθ -1 ) = (cosθ +1 )

Multiply both sides by (cosθ -1):

- sin²θ = (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1 )

Note that (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1) = cos²θ -1 = - sin²θ

Wait, because cos²θ + sin²θ =1 → cos²θ -1 = - sin²θ.

So right side becomes (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1) = cos²θ -1 = - sin²θ.

So the equation becomes:

- sin²θ = - sin²θ → 0=0, so this is an identity.

Which means that the equations are dependent, and we can find a non-trivial solution.

So, from equation A:

a (cosθ - 1) = -b sinθ → a = [ -b sinθ ] / (cosθ -1 )

Alternatively, factor the denominator:

cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ ) → denominator is negative.

So,

a = [ -b sinθ ] / (- (1 - cosθ) ) → a = [ b sinθ ] / (1 - cosθ )

Hmm, 1 - cosθ is in the denominator.

We can use the identity 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2)
Similarly, sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So substituting:

a = [ b * (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) ] / (2 sin²(theta/2)) )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

a = [ b * 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / ( 2 sin²(theta/2) )

The 2's cancel, sin(theta/2) cancels with one sin in denominator:

a = [ b cos(theta/2) ] / sin(theta/2 )

Which is a = b cot(theta/2)

So a = b cot(theta/2 )

So the eigenvector can be written as:

[a; b] = [ b cot(theta/2) ; b ] = b [ cot(theta/2) ; 1 ]

To make it a unit vector, we need to normalize. So the norm squared is:

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = |b|^2 [ cot²(theta/2 ) + 1 ] = |b|^2 [ (cos²(theta/2)/sin²(theta/2)) + 1 ]

Which is |b|^2 [ (cos² + sin² ) / sin² ] = |b|^2 [ 1 / sin²(theta/2) ]

Wait, wait:

Wait, cot^2 x +1 = csc^2 x = 1/(sin^2 x).

So, yes, the norm is |b| * (1 / sin(theta/2) )

We want the norm to be 1, so:

|b| * (1 / sin(theta/2) ) =1 → |b| = sin(theta/2 )

Assuming b is real, but wait, the option B seems to have a complex component with e^{i phi}, but maybe in our case, phi is zero since the direction is in x-z plane.

Wait, but wait, the original eigenvector could have complex components, but I think in this problem, they're looking for real components or perhaps any complex.

Wait, the operator P·n is Hermitian because it's a component of angular momentum, which is Hermitian. So the eigenvalues are real, and the eigenvectors can be chosen to be real or have a certain phase.

But let's see. Since we can choose the phase, perhaps the eigenvector can be represented as real components.

Wait, let me check. The eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are real, and eigenvectors can be taken as real if the matrix is symmetric.

Wait, the matrix we're dealing with is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Is this matrix Hermitian? Let me check.

The (1,2) element is sinθ, and the (2,1) element is sinθ. So for real theta, yes, it's symmetric, hence Hermitian.

So the eigenvectors can be taken as real.

So, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ a; b ] = [ cot(theta/2 ) * sin(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Simplify:

a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2 ) = [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2 ) = cos(theta/2 )

And b = sin(theta/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Wait, but wait, in option C, it's (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )). That's one of the options. Let me look:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I have here.

But wait, the first component is cos(theta/2), and the second is sin(theta/2). So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, why aren't there any ħ factors? Because the eigenvector is a dimensionless vector in Hilbert space. The operator P has factors of ħ, but the eigenvector's elements are just coefficients, not involving ħ.

So looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I found.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) ), which seems to be a spherical coordinate representation, maybe for spin-1/2 in a different basis.

Option D has sqrt factors multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), but our calculation suggests it's just those terms.

Wait, let me go back. Are there any other factors, like normalization constants?

Wait, in the calculation, I found that a = cos(theta/2), and b = sin(theta/2). So the vector is [ cos, sin ].

Wait, but wait, earlier when I was calculating the normalization, I found that |b| = sin(theta/2) because the norm was [ (a)^2 + (b)^2 ] = 1. So a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2), which is the standard spin-up state in the direction theta.

So the correct eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options, option C is exactly this. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the options.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Does this match what I got? Yes.

Wait, but wait, the question says that the operator is P, which is a vector operator. So perhaps I should have considered the operator as (P_x, P_y, P_z) and constructed the eigenstate for a general direction. But I think the approach I took was correct, because I considered the operator along an arbitrary axis in x-z plane, which I parameterized with theta.

To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is composed of the components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$. The operator along $\vec{n}$ is then:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Substituting the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$, we get:

\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, the eigenvalue equation simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This gives two equations:

1. $\cos\theta \, a + \sin\theta \, b = a$  
2. $\sin\theta \, a - \cos\theta \, b = b$.

Rearranging these equations:

1. $a (\cos\theta - 1) + b \sin\theta = 0$  
2. $a \sin\theta - b (\cos\theta + 1) = 0$.

From equation (1), we solve for $a$ in terms of $b$:

\[
a = \frac{-b \sin\theta}{\cos\theta - 1}.
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $\cos\theta - 1 = -2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, we substitute these into the expression for $a$:

\[
a = \frac{-b (2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2))}{-2\sin^2(\theta/2)} = b \cot(\theta/2).
\]

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = b \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we calculate the norm:

\[
\sqrt{|a|^2 + |b|^2} = \sqrt{b^2 \cot^2(\theta/2) + b^2} = |b| \sqrt{\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1}.
\]

Using the identity $\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1 = \csc^2(\theta/2)$, the norm becomes:

\[
|b| \sqrt{\csc^2(\theta/2)} = |b| \frac{1}{|\sin(\theta/2)|}.
\]

Setting the norm to 1, we find $|b| = \sin(\theta/2)$. Substituting this back, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option **C**, which is:

\[
\boxed{(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))}.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **A**: Incorrect. The components involve $\hbar$, which is not part of the eigenvector coefficients.  
- **B**: Incorrect. This represents a general spherical coordinate form but does not match the derived eigenvector.  
- **C**: Correct. Matches the derived normalized eigenvector.  
- **D**: Incorrect. Includes unnecessary normalization factors and components not present in the solution.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvector of a certain operator. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

The question says that we're dealing with a muon, but I think the particle type might not matter here since we're dealing with operators. The operator in question is P, and we need the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2 along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. Oh wait, the operator P is probably the angular momentum operator because it's being projected along a certain direction. But wait, the problem gives the components P_x, P_y, and P_z as specific 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

So first, I should write down what each component is. Let me see:

- P_x is (ħ/2) times the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]]. That looks familiar, it's the Pauli X matrix scaled by ħ/2.
- P_y is (ħ/2) times [[0,-i],[i,0]]. That's the Pauli Y matrix scaled.
- P_z is (ħ/2) times [[1,0],[0,-1]]. Pauli Z scaled.

So the operator P is a vector operator, meaning it's given as P = x P_x + y P_y + z P_z, but the direction is arbitrary in the x-z plane. Wait, the direction n is in the x-z plane, so the direction vector can be written as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), where θ is the angle from the z-axis. Because in the x-z plane, the y-component is zero.

So the operator along direction n is P·n = P_x * (n_x) + P_y * (n_y) + P_z * (n_z). But since n_y is zero, the operator simplifies to P_x * sinθ + P_z * cosθ.

Our goal is to find the eigenvector of this operator corresponding to the eigenvalue +ħ/2. Because the eigenvalues of these Pauli matrices are ±1 times the scaling factor, which is ħ/2 here. So the possible eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So for the + case, we're looking for the eigenvector when P·n acts on it gives (ħ/2) times the same vector.

So to proceed, I need to construct the matrix for P·n. Let's compute it:

P·n = (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Breaking that down, let's compute each part:

The sinθ term is (ħ/2) * [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
The cosθ term is (ħ/2) * [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]
Adding them together, the matrix becomes:

[[ (ħ/2) cosθ , (ħ/2) sinθ ],
 [ (ħ/2) sinθ , -(ħ/2) cosθ ] ]

Wait, wait, no. Let me recalculate. Wait, the matrices are:

P_x matrix: [[0,1],[1,0]]
Multiply by sinθ: sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]]
Similarly, P_z matrix is [[1,0],[0,-1]]
Multiply by cosθ: cosθ* [[1,0],[0,-1]]

So when we sum these, it's:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

But each element is multiplied by ħ/2. So the entire matrix is (ħ/2) times the above.

Wait, no. Because each component is multiplied by (ħ/2). So when we add P_x * sinθ and P_z * cosθ, each element is scaled by (ħ/2). So the matrix is (ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Wait, no, wait. Let's compute each term properly.

P_x matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], multiplied by sinθ.

So that gives [[0*sinθ, 1*sinθ],[1*sinθ, 0*sinθ]] = [[0, sinθ],[sinθ, 0]]

P_z matrix is [[1,0],[0,-1]], multiplied by cosθ.

So that's [[cosθ, 0],[0,-cosθ]]

Adding these two matrices together:

[[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

So the total matrix for P·n is (ħ/2) multiplied by this:

(ħ/2) * [ [ cosθ, sinθ ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So the operator matrix is:

(ħ/2) * [[ cosθ, sinθ ],
          [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

Now, the eigenvalue equation is:

P·n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>

Because the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

So the matrix equation is:

(ħ/2) [[ cosθ, sinθ ],
        [ sinθ, -cosθ ]] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can cancel out the (ħ/2) from both sides, so:

[ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
  [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So, (cosθ * a + sinθ * b) = a
(sinθ * a - cosθ * b) = b

Let me write these as equations:

1) cosθ a + sinθ b = a
2) sinθ a - cosθ b = b

Rearranging equation 1:

cosθ a + sinθ b - a = 0
a (cosθ - 1) + b sinθ = 0

Similarly, equation 2:

sinθ a - cosθ b - b = 0
sinθ a - b (cosθ + 1) = 0

So now we have two equations:

a (cosθ - 1) = - b sinθ   --> equation A
sinθ a = b (cosθ + 1)     --> equation B

Let me substitute equation A into equation B. From equation A:

a = [ - b sinθ ] / (cosθ - 1 )

Substitute into equation B:

sinθ * [ (-b sinθ) / (cosθ - 1) ) ] = b (cosθ + 1 )

Simplify numerator:

- b sin²θ / (cosθ - 1) = b (cosθ + 1 )

Assuming b is not zero (since if b is zero, then from equation 1, a (cosθ - 1) =0. If a is non-zero, then cosθ =1, which would mean θ=0, but let's check later for that case.)

So divide both sides by b:

- sin²θ / (cosθ -1 ) = (cosθ +1 )

Multiply both sides by (cosθ -1):

- sin²θ = (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1 )

Note that (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1) = cos²θ -1 = - sin²θ

Wait, because cos²θ + sin²θ =1 → cos²θ -1 = - sin²θ.

So right side becomes (cosθ +1)(cosθ -1) = cos²θ -1 = - sin²θ.

So the equation becomes:

- sin²θ = - sin²θ → 0=0, so this is an identity.

Which means that the equations are dependent, and we can find a non-trivial solution.

So, from equation A:

a (cosθ - 1) = -b sinθ → a = [ -b sinθ ] / (cosθ -1 )

Alternatively, factor the denominator:

cosθ -1 = -(1 - cosθ ) → denominator is negative.

So,

a = [ -b sinθ ] / (- (1 - cosθ) ) → a = [ b sinθ ] / (1 - cosθ )

Hmm, 1 - cosθ is in the denominator.

We can use the identity 1 - cosθ = 2 sin²(theta/2)
Similarly, sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So substituting:

a = [ b * (2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)) ) ] / (2 sin²(theta/2)) )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

a = [ b * 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ] / ( 2 sin²(theta/2) )

The 2's cancel, sin(theta/2) cancels with one sin in denominator:

a = [ b cos(theta/2) ] / sin(theta/2 )

Which is a = b cot(theta/2)

So a = b cot(theta/2 )

So the eigenvector can be written as:

[a; b] = [ b cot(theta/2) ; b ] = b [ cot(theta/2) ; 1 ]

To make it a unit vector, we need to normalize. So the norm squared is:

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = |b|^2 [ cot²(theta/2 ) + 1 ] = |b|^2 [ (cos²(theta/2)/sin²(theta/2)) + 1 ]

Which is |b|^2 [ (cos² + sin² ) / sin² ] = |b|^2 [ 1 / sin²(theta/2) ]

Wait, wait:

Wait, cot^2 x +1 = csc^2 x = 1/(sin^2 x).

So, yes, the norm is |b| * (1 / sin(theta/2) )

We want the norm to be 1, so:

|b| * (1 / sin(theta/2) ) =1 → |b| = sin(theta/2 )

Assuming b is real, but wait, the option B seems to have a complex component with e^{i phi}, but maybe in our case, phi is zero since the direction is in x-z plane.

Wait, but wait, the original eigenvector could have complex components, but I think in this problem, they're looking for real components or perhaps any complex.

Wait, the operator P·n is Hermitian because it's a component of angular momentum, which is Hermitian. So the eigenvalues are real, and the eigenvectors can be chosen to be real or have a certain phase.

But let's see. Since we can choose the phase, perhaps the eigenvector can be represented as real components.

Wait, let me check. The eigenvalues of a Hermitian operator are real, and eigenvectors can be taken as real if the matrix is symmetric.

Wait, the matrix we're dealing with is (ħ/2) multiplied by [[cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ]]

Is this matrix Hermitian? Let me check.

The (1,2) element is sinθ, and the (2,1) element is sinθ. So for real theta, yes, it's symmetric, hence Hermitian.

So the eigenvectors can be taken as real.

So, the normalized eigenvector is:

[ a; b ] = [ cot(theta/2 ) * sin(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Simplify:

a = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2 ) = [ cos(theta/2)/sin(theta/2) ] * sin(theta/2 ) = cos(theta/2 )

And b = sin(theta/2 )

So the normalized eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 ) ]

Wait, but wait, in option C, it's (cos(theta/2 ), sin(theta/2 )). That's one of the options. Let me look:

Option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I have here.

But wait, the first component is cos(theta/2), and the second is sin(theta/2). So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

But wait, why aren't there any ħ factors? Because the eigenvector is a dimensionless vector in Hilbert space. The operator P has factors of ħ, but the eigenvector's elements are just coefficients, not involving ħ.

So looking back at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches what I found.

Wait, but let me check the other options.

Option B is (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta) ), which seems to be a spherical coordinate representation, maybe for spin-1/2 in a different basis.

Option D has sqrt factors multiplied by cos(theta/2) and sin(theta/2), but our calculation suggests it's just those terms.

Wait, let me go back. Are there any other factors, like normalization constants?

Wait, in the calculation, I found that a = cos(theta/2), and b = sin(theta/2). So the vector is [ cos, sin ].

Wait, but wait, earlier when I was calculating the normalization, I found that |b| = sin(theta/2) because the norm was [ (a)^2 + (b)^2 ] = 1. So a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2), which is the standard spin-up state in the direction theta.

So the correct eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Looking at the options, option C is exactly this. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but let me double-check the options.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Does this match what I got? Yes.

Wait, but wait, the question says that the operator is P, which is a vector operator. So perhaps I should have considered the operator as (P_x, P_y, P_z) and constructed the eigenstate for a general direction. But I think the approach I took was correct, because I considered the operator along an arbitrary axis in x-z plane, which I parameterized with theta.


To solve the problem, we need to find the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is composed of the components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as:

- $P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{bmatrix}$  
- $P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$  

Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, it can be parameterized as $\vec{n} = (\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$. The operator along $\vec{n}$ is then:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} = P_x \sin\theta + P_z \cos\theta = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalue equation is:

\[
\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Substituting the matrix for $\vec{P} \cdot \vec{n}$, we get:

\[
\frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Dividing through by $\frac{\hbar}{2}$, the eigenvalue equation simplifies to:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This gives two equations:

1. $\cos\theta \, a + \sin\theta \, b = a$  
2. $\sin\theta \, a - \cos\theta \, b = b$.

Rearranging these equations:

1. $a (\cos\theta - 1) + b \sin\theta = 0$  
2. $a \sin\theta - b (\cos\theta + 1) = 0$.

From equation (1), we solve for $a$ in terms of $b$:

\[
a = \frac{-b \sin\theta}{\cos\theta - 1}.
\]

Using trigonometric identities, $\cos\theta - 1 = -2\sin^2(\theta/2)$ and $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$, we substitute these into the expression for $a$:

\[
a = \frac{-b (2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2))}{-2\sin^2(\theta/2)} = b \cot(\theta/2).
\]

Thus, the eigenvector can be written as:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = b \begin{bmatrix} \cot(\theta/2) \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To normalize the eigenvector, we calculate the norm:

\[
\sqrt{|a|^2 + |b|^2} = \sqrt{b^2 \cot^2(\theta/2) + b^2} = |b| \sqrt{\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1}.
\]

Using the identity $\cot^2(\theta/2) + 1 = \csc^2(\theta/2)$, the norm becomes:

\[
|b| \sqrt{\csc^2(\theta/2)} = |b| \frac{1}{|\sin(\theta/2)|}.
\]

Setting the norm to 1, we find $|b| = \sin(\theta/2)$. Substituting this back, the normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This matches option **C**, which is:

\[
\boxed{(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))}.
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **A**: Incorrect. The components involve $\hbar$, which is not part of the eigenvector coefficients.  
- **B**: Incorrect. This represents a general spherical coordinate form but does not match the derived eigenvector.  
- **C**: Correct. Matches the derived normalized eigenvector.  
- **D**: Incorrect. Includes unnecessary normalization factors and components not present in the solution.
