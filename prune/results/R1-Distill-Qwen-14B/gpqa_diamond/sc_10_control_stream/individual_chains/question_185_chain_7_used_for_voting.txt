Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me read it again and think through what I need to do.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, n is an arbitrary unit vector, and ε is an energy constant. Hmm, I remember that Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems, like the spin of an electron or something similar.

Wait, eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian... Right, the eigenvalues represent the possible energy levels of the system. So I need to find the energies when H acts on its eigenstates.

Pauli matrices: Oh right, σ is a vector with components σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So σ · n would be the sum of each Pauli matrix multiplied by the corresponding component of n. Since n is a unit vector, n = (n_x, n_y, n_z), so σ · n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z.

Each Pauli matrix (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) is 2x2, and each has eigenvalues ±1. But wait, when you have a combination like σ · n, what does that sum look like?

Wait a second, the dot product of σ and n is a matrix. Since σ is a vector operator, the Hamiltonian H is a 2x2 matrix. So to find its eigenvalues, I can think about the properties of such matrices.

I recall that for any Pauli matrix σ_i, the eigenvalues are ±1. But when you take a linear combination, perhaps the eigenvalues scale with the coefficients. Oh, but wait, the Pauli matrices are traceless and their squares add up to the identity matrix. Let me think about that.

So, for any unit vector n, (σ · n)^2 would be (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Expanding this, each σ_i squared is the identity matrix (since σ_i^2 = I for each i), and cross terms would be σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i, which I think are proportional to something else.

Wait, let me actually calculate (σ · n)^2. Expanding it:

(σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2
= n_x^2 σ_x^2 + n_y^2 σ_y^2 + n_z^2 σ_z^2 + 2n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + 2n_x n_z σ_x σ_z + 2n_y n_z σ_y σ_z.

Each σ_i^2 is I, the 2x2 identity matrix. And for the cross terms, I remember that σ_i σ_j = i ε_ijk σ_k, where ε is the Levi-Civita symbol. But wait, when you multiply σ_i and σ_j, you get iσ_k for i≠j, but when you compute σ_j σ_i, you get -iσ_k. So σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i = 2 δ_ij I, where δ is the Kronecker delta.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The product σ_i σ_j is equal to δ_ij I + i ε_ijk σ_k, right? So when you have σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i, it would be 2 δ_ij I. Because the cross terms (i≠j) would cancel the i ε terms when adding, leaving only the δ term.

So in our expansion, each cross term like σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x would become 2 δ_xy I. But since x≠y, δ_xy is zero, so those cross terms become zero. Wait, no, actually, wait: the cross terms in our expansion are 2n_x n_y σ_x σ_y, but in the expansion of (σ · n)^2, each cross term is 2n_x n_y σ_x σ_y, and same for others.

Wait, so when you expand (σ · n)^2, you'll have terms like n_x^2 σ_x^2, which is n_x^2 I. The cross terms will be 2n_x n_y σ_x σ_y, which is 2n_x n_y (i σ_z δ_{xy} ?) Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, I can compute the trace of H. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. Since H is ε σ · n, the trace of H would be ε times the trace of σ · n. But each Pauli matrix has a trace of zero, because σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are all [[0,1],[1,0]], [[0,-i],[i,0]], [[1,0],[0,-1]], respectively. So their trace is zero. So the trace of σ · n is n_x Tr(σ_x) + n_y Tr(σ_y) + n_z Tr(σ_z) ) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So Tr(H) = ε * 0 = 0. That means the sum of the eigenvalues is zero.

Moreover, the determinant of H can be found because H is a 2x2 matrix. The determinant is the product of eigenvalues. For a 2x2 matrix, the determinant is (for any 2x2 matrix A) (A_{11} A_{22} - A_{12} A_{21}).

But wait, perhaps there's a better way. Since H is a 2x2 matrix, and it's a spin operator scaled by ε, I think its eigenvalues should be ± ε times some factor. Because spin systems like this typically have eigenvalues ± something.

Wait another approach: the eigenvalues of a matrix A are found by solving det(A - λ I) = 0. Let me consider a general case. Let me suppose that H is a 2x2 matrix. Let's compute H^2.

H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)
H^2 = ε^2 (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2.

As earlier, each σ_i^2 is I, and the cross terms are σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i = 2 δ_ij I. Wait, no, wait: when I expand (σ_x + σ_y + σ_z)^2, it's sigma_x^2 + sigma_y^2 + sigma_z^2 + 2 sigma_x sigma_y + 2 sigma_x sigma_z + 2 sigma_y sigma_z.

But each sigma_i^2 is I, so the sum of those is 3I. The cross terms are 2 times the sum of sigma_i sigma_j. Wait, but sigma_i sigma_j is equal to i epsilon_ijk sigma_k, so when you sum sigma_i sigma_j for i < j, you get terms like sigma_x sigma_y + sigma_y sigma_x = 2i sigma_z? No, wait: sigma_x sigma_y = i sigma_z, and sigma_y sigma_x = -i sigma_z. So their sum is zero. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, when you compute (a + b + c)^2, you get a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc. So in our case, each cross term is 2 sigma_i sigma_j. But when you compute sigma_i sigma_j for i≠j, it's i epsilon_ijk sigma_k. So sigma_i sigma_j + sigma_j sigma_i = 2 delta_ij I, as I thought earlier.

Wait, so for i ≠ j, sigma_i sigma_j + sigma_j sigma_i = 0, because delta_ij is zero when i≠j. So then, in the expansion of (sigma · n)^2, the terms with i≠j (the cross terms) would be 2n_i n_j (sigma_i sigma_j + sigma_j sigma_i)/2? No, wait, the expansion is (sigma · n)^2 = sum_i n_i^2 sigma_i^2 + sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j (sigma_i sigma_j + sigma_j sigma_i). Since sigma_i sigma_j + sigma_j sigma_i = 2 delta_ij I, which is 2I when i=j, but for i≠j, it's zero.

Wait, but in the expansion, when i≠j, the terms are 2n_i n_j sigma_i sigma_j. Wait, no, let's re-calculate the expansion properly.

Let me define S = sigma · n = n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z.

S^2 = (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z)^2.

Expanding this, each term is sigma_i sigma_j multiplied by n_i n_j. So S^2 = sum_i (n_i sigma_i)^2 + sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j sigma_i sigma_j.

But (n_i sigma_i)^2 = n_i^2 sigma_i^2 = n_i^2 I.

And the cross terms are sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j sigma_i sigma_j.

Now, sigma_i sigma_j = i epsilon_ijk sigma_k, so sigma_i sigma_j + sigma_j sigma_i = 2 delta_ij I. Wait, but in the expansion, it's only sigma_i sigma_j, not sigma_i sigma_j plus the reverse.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me compute S^2.

Wait, another approach: each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But when you have S = sigma · n, what's S^2?

Well, S^2 = (sigma · n) · (sigma · n) = sum_i sum_j n_i n_j sigma_i sigma_j.

Now, sigma_i sigma_j = delta_ij I + i epsilon_ijk sigma_k.

So S^2 = sum_i sum_j n_i n_j [delta_ij I + i epsilon_ijk sigma_k ].

The delta_ij term is when i=j, so sum_i n_i^2 (I) = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I. But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So the first part is I.

The second part is i sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j epsilon_ijk sigma_k.

Hmm, but epsilon_ijk is zero unless i,j,k are a cyclic permutation. Let me see, but the sum over i and j, including when i≠j, so for each k, the term would involve sigma_k multiplied by some coefficient.

Wait, perhaps the cross terms sum up to zero. Alternatively, perhaps the cross terms don't contribute anything. Let me think. For each pair i,j where i≠j, n_i n_j epsilon_ijk sigma_k.

Wait, perhaps the sum over i and j of n_i n_j epsilon_ijk sigma_k can be simplified. Let me think about this.

Another approach: think about the vector n. Since it's a unit vector, it can be thought of as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but perhaps that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity that (sigma · n)^2 = I. Because each Pauli matrix squared is I, and their cross terms cancel. Wait, because for any unit vector n, (sigma · n)^2 equals I.

Wait, wait, I think that's the case. Because if I take any unit vector, then (sigma · n)^2 should be equal to the identity matrix multiplied by 1. Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, and when you square any spin component, you get I.

Wait, let me test that with a specific example. Let's take n along the z-axis: n = (0,0,1). Then S = sigma_z. S^2 = sigma_z^2 = I. So when n is along z, S^2 is I.

Another example: n along x: n=(1,0,0). S = sigma_x. S^2 = sigma_x^2 = I.

What about n in the direction (1,1,0) normalized? So n = (1/√2, 1/√2, 0). Then S = (1/√2) sigma_x + (1/√2) sigma_y.

Compute S^2:

= (1/√2)^2 sigma_x^2 + (1/√2)^2 sigma_y^2 + 2*(1/√2)(1/√2) sigma_x sigma_y.

= (1/2) I + (1/2) I + (1/√2 * 1/√2) (sigma_x sigma_y + sigma_y sigma_x) ?

Wait, no, the cross terms are sigma_x sigma_y and sigma_y sigma_x, but when you square S, it's (a + b)^2 = a² + b² + 2ab. So cross term is 2 * (1/√2 sigma_x) * (1/√2 sigma_y) = (2 * 1/√2 * 1/√2) sigma_x sigma_y. So that's (2 * 1/2) sigma_x sigma_y = sigma_x sigma_y.

Wait, but sigma_x sigma_y is equal to i sigma_z, because sigma_x sigma_y = i sigma_z. So sigma_x sigma_y + sigma_y sigma_x would be i sigma_z - i sigma_z = 0. Wait, no, sigma_x sigma_y + sigma_y sigma_x = 2 delta_xy I, which for x≠y is zero. So in this case, the cross terms would be sigma_x sigma_y + sigma_y sigma_x = 0, so the cross terms in S^2 would be zero.

Wait, but when I compute S^2, it's (1/√2 sigma_x + 1/√2 sigma_y)^2 = (1/2) sigma_x^2 + (1/2) sigma_y^2 + 2*(1/√2)(1/√2) sigma_x sigma_y. The first two terms give (1/2 + 1/2) I = I. The cross term is 2*(1/2) sigma_x sigma_y = sigma_x sigma_y. Wait, but sigma_x sigma_y is i sigma_z. So S^2 = I + i sigma_z?

Wait, that can't be right because S^2 should be I, as I thought earlier. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, let me compute it correctly:

Wait, S = (1/√2)(sigma_x + sigma_y). So S^2 would be (1/√2)^2 (sigma_x + sigma_y)^2.

Which is (1/2)(sigma_x^2 + 2 sigma_x sigma_y + sigma_y^2).

We know sigma_x^2 = I, sigma_y^2 = I, so sum is 2I. The cross term is 2 sigma_x sigma_y.

So S^2 = (1/2)(2I + 2 sigma_x sigma_y) = I + sigma_x sigma_y.

But sigma_x sigma_y is i sigma_z, right? So S^2 = I + i sigma_z.

But that's not equal to I. So that seems to contradict the earlier statement that (sigma · n)^2 = I. Hmm, so perhaps my initial assumption was wrong. So what's going on?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me compute S^2 again. Let me take n along (1,1,0), normalized.

So S = (sigma_x + sigma_y)/√2.

S^2 = (sigma_x + sigma_y)^2 / 2.

Expanding the numerator: sigma_x^2 + sigma_y^2 + 2 sigma_x sigma_y.

Each sigma squared is I, so that's 2I. So numerator is 2I + 2 sigma_x sigma_y.

Divide by 2: I + sigma_x sigma_y.

Now, sigma_x sigma_y is equal to i sigma_z. So S^2 = I + i sigma_z. But that doesn't equal I. So my initial thought that (sigma · n)^2 = I is incorrect.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps (sigma · n)^2 isn't I, but rather something else. Then, what is (sigma · n)^2?

Wait, but if (sigma · n)^2 is not I, what is it?

Another approach: let's compute the trace and determinant of H to find its eigenvalues.

H = ε (n · sigma) = ε (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z).

H is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalues λ satisfy the characteristic equation det(H - λ I) = 0.

The trace of H, Tr(H), is the sum of the diagonal elements. But each Pauli matrix has trace zero, so Tr(H) = ε (n_x Tr(sigma_x) + n_y Tr(sigma_y) + n_z Tr(sigma_z)) ) = 0. So the trace is zero, which means the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

The determinant of H is det(H). H is 2x2, so det(H) = (a d - b c) if H is [[a,b],[c,d]].

But since H is ε (n · sigma), let's compute H^2.

Wait, earlier when I tried with n_x = n_y = 1/√2, the square of H (without the epsilon) was I + i sigma_z. But that can't be right. Maybe I should work this out more carefully.

Wait, perhaps instead, I should find the eigenvalues regardless of the specific form of n. Because n is a unit vector, the operator sigma · n is a 2x2 matrix of the form a sigma_x + b sigma_y + c sigma_z, where a^2 + b^2 + c^2 =1. Wait no, n is a unit vector, so a^2 + b^2 + c^2 =1. But sigma · n is a linear combination of Pauli matrices, so the matrix is traceless and has some other properties.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the properties of the Pauli matrices. Since each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, any linear combination would have eigenvalues that depend on the direction of n.

Wait, wait, but the eigenvalues of a spin operator along any direction would be ±1, scaled by something. Hmm, but in this case, H is ε times the spin operator. So perhaps the eigenvalues are ± ε.

Wait, but let's think about it. The Hamiltonian H is ε times the spin component in the direction of n. The eigenvalues of spin in any direction are ± (ħ/2) for spin-1/2 particles. Wait, but wait, in this problem, are the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ? Because usually, spin operators are S = (ħ/2) sigma. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is ε sigma · n, which doesn't have the ħ/2 factor. So perhaps in this problem, the eigenvalues would be ± ε.

Wait, but no, because the Pauli matrices don't include the ħ/2 factor. So the eigenvalues would be ± ε, because when you have a matrix like sigma · n, its eigenvalues are ±1. So when you multiply by ε, the eigenvalues become ± ε.

Wait, but wait, let me confirm. The Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1. So any matrix of the form (a sigma_x + b sigma_y + c sigma_z) where a^2 + b^2 + c^2 =1 (since n is a unit vector) will have eigenvalues ± sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ) ? No, because the eigenvalues of a Pauli vector (sigma · n) are ±1. Because any unit vector in spin space would have eigenvalues ±1. Because the spin matrices have that property.

Wait, let me think again. The eigenvalues of sigma · n are ±1 because sigma ·n is a traceless matrix with determinant -1. Because for a 2x2 matrix with trace zero, the determinant is the product of eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues are m and -m, so their product is -m^2. So determinant would be -m^2.

Wait, but sigma ·n is a traceless matrix, so its trace is zero. The determinant would be (eigenvalue1) * (eigenvalue2) = (m) * (-m) = -m^2.

But what is the determinant of sigma ·n?

The determinant of sigma ·n is the determinant of n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z.

But each sigma_i has determinant -1. But when you have a sum of matrices, the determinant isn't simply the sum of determinants. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, for any 2x2 traceless matrix M with M^2 = I, the eigenvalues are ±1. Because if M^2 = I, then M^2 - I =0, so the minimal polynomial is x^2 -1=0, so eigenvalues are ±1.

Wait, does (sigma ·n)^2 equal I?

Wait earlier when I took n along x, sigma_x^2 is I. So sigma_x^2 is I. So if n is along any axis, (sigma ·n)^2 = I.

Wait but in the previous example with n=(1/√2, 1/√2, 0), I found that S^2 = I + i sigma_z, which is not I. So that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in that calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate S^2 for n=(1/√2, 1/√2, 0):

n_x = 1/√2, n_y = 1/√2, n_z=0.

So S = sigma_x (1/√2) + sigma_y (1/√2).

So S^2 = (1/√2 sigma_x + 1/√2 sigma_y)^2.

Expanding this:

= (1/√2)^2 sigma_x^2 + (1/√2)^2 sigma_y^2 + 2*(1/√2)(1/√2) sigma_x sigma_y.

Each sigma_i^2 is I, so (1/2) I + (1/2) I = I. The cross term is 2*(1/2) sigma_x sigma_y = sigma_x sigma_y.

But sigma_x sigma_y = i sigma_z. So S^2 = I + i sigma_z.

Wait, but I thought (sigma ·n)^2 should be I. So what gives?

Hmm, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe (sigma ·n)^2 is not equal to I. So perhaps the eigenvalues of sigma ·n are not ±1 in all cases.

Wait, but then how do I find the eigenvalues?

Alternatively, perhaps for any n, (sigma ·n)^2 = I. Let me try another example. Let n be (0,0,1), so S = sigma_z.

S^2 = sigma_z^2 = I. That works.

Another example: n = (0,1,0), S = sigma_y.

S^2 = sigma_y^2 = I. So that works.

But the earlier case with n=(1/√2, 1/√2, 0) gives S^2 = I + i sigma_z. Which is not equal to I. So something is wrong. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps when I compute S^2, I should take into account that (sigma_x + sigma_y)^2 = sigma_x^2 + sigma_y^2 + 2 sigma_x sigma_y.

But sigma_x sigma_y is i sigma_z. So S^2 = I + I + 2i sigma_z.

Wait, no, sigma_x^2 is I, sigma_y^2 is I. So the first two terms give 2I. The cross term is 2 * (1/√2)(1/√2) sigma_x sigma_y = 2*(1/2)(i sigma_z) = i sigma_z.

So S^2 = 2I + i sigma_z.

Wait, that's different. So S^2 = 2I + i sigma_z.

But that's a problem because if I'm to find the eigenvalues of H, which is ε S, then H^2 = ε^2 S^2. But if S^2 isn't I, then H^2 isn't ε^2 I either.

Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Let me just assume that the eigenvalues are ±ε, because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 and H is ε times the Pauli vector.

Wait, but in the case where n is along a particular axis, the eigenvalues are ±ε. But in the case where n is pointing in some other direction, would the eigenvalues still be ±ε?

Wait, but perhaps the eigenvalues of sigma ·n are ±1 regardless of the direction of n. Because sigma ·n is a unit vector in spin space, and the eigenvalues are ±1. Because any spin operator in any direction has eigenvalues ±1.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. For example, if I have a spin-1/2 particle, the spin component in any direction has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. But in this case, the Pauli matrices are scaled without the ħ/2 factor. So in the problem, H is ε times the Pauli vector, so the eigenvalues would be ±ε.

Wait, but wait, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1, so any linear combination where the coefficients form a unit vector (like n is unit) would also have eigenvalues ±1.

Wait, here's another approach: for any unit vector n, the operator sigma ·n has eigenvalues ±1 because it's a spin-1/2 operator in direction n. So when you multiply by ε, the eigenvalues become ±ε.

So that would suggest that the eigenvalues of H are ±ε, which is option B.

Looking at the options:

Option B is ±ε.

Option C is ±(ε ħ/2). I don't think ħ is involved here because the problem doesn't mention it. So probably the correct answer is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with the dimension of energy. Here's the analysis:

1. **Structure of the Hamiltonian**:  
   The Hamiltonian is a 2x2 matrix because it involves the Pauli spin matrices \( \vec{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \), which are 2x2 matrices. The term \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) represents a linear combination of the Pauli matrices weighted by the components of \( \vec{n} \), a unit vector.

2. **Eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \)**:  
   For any unit vector \( \vec{n} \), the operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a traceless matrix with eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \). This is a general property of spin operators in quantum mechanics. The eigenvalues arise because the Pauli matrices represent spin-1/2 systems, and their combination in any direction has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \).

3. **Scaling by \( \varepsilon \)**:  
   The Hamiltonian \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) scales the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) by \( \varepsilon \). Since the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) become \( \pm \varepsilon \).

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A (\(+1, -1\))**: Incorrect. The eigenvalues are not \( \pm 1 \) because the Hamiltonian is scaled by \( \varepsilon \).  
   - **Option B (\(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\))**: Correct. The eigenvalues of \( H \) are \( \pm \varepsilon \), as derived above.  
   - **Option C (\(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\))**: Incorrect. The factor \( \hbar/2 \) is not present in the problem, as the Hamiltonian is given in terms of the Pauli matrices without such a scaling.  
   - **Option D (\(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\))**: Incorrect. This option does not involve \( \varepsilon \) and is unrelated to the given Hamiltonian.

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm \varepsilon \).

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me read it again and think through what I need to do.

The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, n is an arbitrary unit vector, and ε is an energy constant. Hmm, I remember that Pauli matrices are involved in spin systems, like the spin of an electron or something similar.

Wait, eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian... Right, the eigenvalues represent the possible energy levels of the system. So I need to find the energies when H acts on its eigenstates.

Pauli matrices: Oh right, σ is a vector with components σ_x, σ_y, σ_z. So σ · n would be the sum of each Pauli matrix multiplied by the corresponding component of n. Since n is a unit vector, n = (n_x, n_y, n_z), so σ · n = n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z.

Each Pauli matrix (σ_x, σ_y, σ_z) is 2x2, and each has eigenvalues ±1. But wait, when you have a combination like σ · n, what does that sum look like?

Wait a second, the dot product of σ and n is a matrix. Since σ is a vector operator, the Hamiltonian H is a 2x2 matrix. So to find its eigenvalues, I can think about the properties of such matrices.

I recall that for any Pauli matrix σ_i, the eigenvalues are ±1. But when you take a linear combination, perhaps the eigenvalues scale with the coefficients. Oh, but wait, the Pauli matrices are traceless and their squares add up to the identity matrix. Let me think about that.

So, for any unit vector n, (σ · n)^2 would be (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Expanding this, each σ_i squared is the identity matrix (since σ_i^2 = I for each i), and cross terms would be σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i, which I think are proportional to something else.

Wait, let me actually calculate (σ · n)^2. Expanding it:

(σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2
= n_x^2 σ_x^2 + n_y^2 σ_y^2 + n_z^2 σ_z^2 + 2n_x n_y σ_x σ_y + 2n_x n_z σ_x σ_z + 2n_y n_z σ_y σ_z.

Each σ_i^2 is I, the 2x2 identity matrix. And for the cross terms, I remember that σ_i σ_j = i ε_ijk σ_k, where ε is the Levi-Civita symbol. But wait, when you multiply σ_i and σ_j, you get iσ_k for i≠j, but when you compute σ_j σ_i, you get -iσ_k. So σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i = 2 δ_ij I, where δ is the Kronecker delta.

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. The product σ_i σ_j is equal to δ_ij I + i ε_ijk σ_k, right? So when you have σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i, it would be 2 δ_ij I. Because the cross terms (i≠j) would cancel the i ε terms when adding, leaving only the δ term.

So in our expansion, each cross term like σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x would become 2 δ_xy I. But since x≠y, δ_xy is zero, so those cross terms become zero. Wait, no, actually, wait: the cross terms in our expansion are 2n_x n_y σ_x σ_y, but in the expansion of (σ · n)^2, each cross term is 2n_x n_y σ_x σ_y, and same for others.

Wait, so when you expand (σ · n)^2, you'll have terms like n_x^2 σ_x^2, which is n_x^2 I. The cross terms will be 2n_x n_y σ_x σ_y, which is 2n_x n_y (i σ_z δ_{xy} ?) Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, I can compute the trace of H. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. Since H is ε σ · n, the trace of H would be ε times the trace of σ · n. But each Pauli matrix has a trace of zero, because σ_x, σ_y, σ_z are all [[0,1],[1,0]], [[0,-i],[i,0]], [[1,0],[0,-1]], respectively. So their trace is zero. So the trace of σ · n is n_x Tr(σ_x) + n_y Tr(σ_y) + n_z Tr(σ_z) ) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. So Tr(H) = ε * 0 = 0. That means the sum of the eigenvalues is zero.

Moreover, the determinant of H can be found because H is a 2x2 matrix. The determinant is the product of eigenvalues. For a 2x2 matrix, the determinant is (for any 2x2 matrix A) (A_{11} A_{22} - A_{12} A_{21}).

But wait, perhaps there's a better way. Since H is a 2x2 matrix, and it's a spin operator scaled by ε, I think its eigenvalues should be ± ε times some factor. Because spin systems like this typically have eigenvalues ± something.

Wait another approach: the eigenvalues of a matrix A are found by solving det(A - λ I) = 0. Let me consider a general case. Let me suppose that H is a 2x2 matrix. Let's compute H^2.

H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)
H^2 = ε^2 (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2.

As earlier, each σ_i^2 is I, and the cross terms are σ_i σ_j + σ_j σ_i = 2 δ_ij I. Wait, no, wait: when I expand (σ_x + σ_y + σ_z)^2, it's sigma_x^2 + sigma_y^2 + sigma_z^2 + 2 sigma_x sigma_y + 2 sigma_x sigma_z + 2 sigma_y sigma_z.

But each sigma_i^2 is I, so the sum of those is 3I. The cross terms are 2 times the sum of sigma_i sigma_j. Wait, but sigma_i sigma_j is equal to i epsilon_ijk sigma_k, so when you sum sigma_i sigma_j for i < j, you get terms like sigma_x sigma_y + sigma_y sigma_x = 2i sigma_z? No, wait: sigma_x sigma_y = i sigma_z, and sigma_y sigma_x = -i sigma_z. So their sum is zero. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, when you compute (a + b + c)^2, you get a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc. So in our case, each cross term is 2 sigma_i sigma_j. But when you compute sigma_i sigma_j for i≠j, it's i epsilon_ijk sigma_k. So sigma_i sigma_j + sigma_j sigma_i = 2 delta_ij I, as I thought earlier.

Wait, so for i ≠ j, sigma_i sigma_j + sigma_j sigma_i = 0, because delta_ij is zero when i≠j. So then, in the expansion of (sigma · n)^2, the terms with i≠j (the cross terms) would be 2n_i n_j (sigma_i sigma_j + sigma_j sigma_i)/2? No, wait, the expansion is (sigma · n)^2 = sum_i n_i^2 sigma_i^2 + sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j (sigma_i sigma_j + sigma_j sigma_i). Since sigma_i sigma_j + sigma_j sigma_i = 2 delta_ij I, which is 2I when i=j, but for i≠j, it's zero.

Wait, but in the expansion, when i≠j, the terms are 2n_i n_j sigma_i sigma_j. Wait, no, let's re-calculate the expansion properly.

Let me define S = sigma · n = n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z.

S^2 = (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z)^2.

Expanding this, each term is sigma_i sigma_j multiplied by n_i n_j. So S^2 = sum_i (n_i sigma_i)^2 + sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j sigma_i sigma_j.

But (n_i sigma_i)^2 = n_i^2 sigma_i^2 = n_i^2 I.

And the cross terms are sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j sigma_i sigma_j.

Now, sigma_i sigma_j = i epsilon_ijk sigma_k, so sigma_i sigma_j + sigma_j sigma_i = 2 delta_ij I. Wait, but in the expansion, it's only sigma_i sigma_j, not sigma_i sigma_j plus the reverse.

Hmm, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let me compute S^2.

Wait, another approach: each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But when you have S = sigma · n, what's S^2?

Well, S^2 = (sigma · n) · (sigma · n) = sum_i sum_j n_i n_j sigma_i sigma_j.

Now, sigma_i sigma_j = delta_ij I + i epsilon_ijk sigma_k.

So S^2 = sum_i sum_j n_i n_j [delta_ij I + i epsilon_ijk sigma_k ].

The delta_ij term is when i=j, so sum_i n_i^2 (I) = (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I. But since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So the first part is I.

The second part is i sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j epsilon_ijk sigma_k.

Hmm, but epsilon_ijk is zero unless i,j,k are a cyclic permutation. Let me see, but the sum over i and j, including when i≠j, so for each k, the term would involve sigma_k multiplied by some coefficient.

Wait, perhaps the cross terms sum up to zero. Alternatively, perhaps the cross terms don't contribute anything. Let me think. For each pair i,j where i≠j, n_i n_j epsilon_ijk sigma_k.

Wait, perhaps the sum over i and j of n_i n_j epsilon_ijk sigma_k can be simplified. Let me think about this.

Another approach: think about the vector n. Since it's a unit vector, it can be thought of as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), but perhaps that complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity that (sigma · n)^2 = I. Because each Pauli matrix squared is I, and their cross terms cancel. Wait, because for any unit vector n, (sigma · n)^2 equals I.

Wait, wait, I think that's the case. Because if I take any unit vector, then (sigma · n)^2 should be equal to the identity matrix multiplied by 1. Because each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, and when you square any spin component, you get I.

Wait, let me test that with a specific example. Let's take n along the z-axis: n = (0,0,1). Then S = sigma_z. S^2 = sigma_z^2 = I. So when n is along z, S^2 is I.

Another example: n along x: n=(1,0,0). S = sigma_x. S^2 = sigma_x^2 = I.

What about n in the direction (1,1,0) normalized? So n = (1/√2, 1/√2, 0). Then S = (1/√2) sigma_x + (1/√2) sigma_y.

Compute S^2:

= (1/√2)^2 sigma_x^2 + (1/√2)^2 sigma_y^2 + 2*(1/√2)(1/√2) sigma_x sigma_y.

= (1/2) I + (1/2) I + (1/√2 * 1/√2) (sigma_x sigma_y + sigma_y sigma_x) ?

Wait, no, the cross terms are sigma_x sigma_y and sigma_y sigma_x, but when you square S, it's (a + b)^2 = a² + b² + 2ab. So cross term is 2 * (1/√2 sigma_x) * (1/√2 sigma_y) = (2 * 1/√2 * 1/√2) sigma_x sigma_y. So that's (2 * 1/2) sigma_x sigma_y = sigma_x sigma_y.

Wait, but sigma_x sigma_y is equal to i sigma_z, because sigma_x sigma_y = i sigma_z. So sigma_x sigma_y + sigma_y sigma_x would be i sigma_z - i sigma_z = 0. Wait, no, sigma_x sigma_y + sigma_y sigma_x = 2 delta_xy I, which for x≠y is zero. So in this case, the cross terms would be sigma_x sigma_y + sigma_y sigma_x = 0, so the cross terms in S^2 would be zero.

Wait, but when I compute S^2, it's (1/√2 sigma_x + 1/√2 sigma_y)^2 = (1/2) sigma_x^2 + (1/2) sigma_y^2 + 2*(1/√2)(1/√2) sigma_x sigma_y. The first two terms give (1/2 + 1/2) I = I. The cross term is 2*(1/2) sigma_x sigma_y = sigma_x sigma_y. Wait, but sigma_x sigma_y is i sigma_z. So S^2 = I + i sigma_z?

Wait, that can't be right because S^2 should be I, as I thought earlier. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, let me compute it correctly:

Wait, S = (1/√2)(sigma_x + sigma_y). So S^2 would be (1/√2)^2 (sigma_x + sigma_y)^2.

Which is (1/2)(sigma_x^2 + 2 sigma_x sigma_y + sigma_y^2).

We know sigma_x^2 = I, sigma_y^2 = I, so sum is 2I. The cross term is 2 sigma_x sigma_y.

So S^2 = (1/2)(2I + 2 sigma_x sigma_y) = I + sigma_x sigma_y.

But sigma_x sigma_y is i sigma_z, right? So S^2 = I + i sigma_z.

But that's not equal to I. So that seems to contradict the earlier statement that (sigma · n)^2 = I. Hmm, so perhaps my initial assumption was wrong. So what's going on?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the expansion. Let me compute S^2 again. Let me take n along (1,1,0), normalized.

So S = (sigma_x + sigma_y)/√2.

S^2 = (sigma_x + sigma_y)^2 / 2.

Expanding the numerator: sigma_x^2 + sigma_y^2 + 2 sigma_x sigma_y.

Each sigma squared is I, so that's 2I. So numerator is 2I + 2 sigma_x sigma_y.

Divide by 2: I + sigma_x sigma_y.

Now, sigma_x sigma_y is equal to i sigma_z. So S^2 = I + i sigma_z. But that doesn't equal I. So my initial thought that (sigma · n)^2 = I is incorrect.

Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps (sigma · n)^2 isn't I, but rather something else. Then, what is (sigma · n)^2?

Wait, but if (sigma · n)^2 is not I, what is it?

Another approach: let's compute the trace and determinant of H to find its eigenvalues.

H = ε (n · sigma) = ε (n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z).

H is a 2x2 matrix. The eigenvalues λ satisfy the characteristic equation det(H - λ I) = 0.

The trace of H, Tr(H), is the sum of the diagonal elements. But each Pauli matrix has trace zero, so Tr(H) = ε (n_x Tr(sigma_x) + n_y Tr(sigma_y) + n_z Tr(sigma_z)) ) = 0. So the trace is zero, which means the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

The determinant of H is det(H). H is 2x2, so det(H) = (a d - b c) if H is [[a,b],[c,d]].

But since H is ε (n · sigma), let's compute H^2.

Wait, earlier when I tried with n_x = n_y = 1/√2, the square of H (without the epsilon) was I + i sigma_z. But that can't be right. Maybe I should work this out more carefully.

Wait, perhaps instead, I should find the eigenvalues regardless of the specific form of n. Because n is a unit vector, the operator sigma · n is a 2x2 matrix of the form a sigma_x + b sigma_y + c sigma_z, where a^2 + b^2 + c^2 =1. Wait no, n is a unit vector, so a^2 + b^2 + c^2 =1. But sigma · n is a linear combination of Pauli matrices, so the matrix is traceless and has some other properties.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the properties of the Pauli matrices. Since each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, any linear combination would have eigenvalues that depend on the direction of n.

Wait, wait, but the eigenvalues of a spin operator along any direction would be ±1, scaled by something. Hmm, but in this case, H is ε times the spin operator. So perhaps the eigenvalues are ± ε.

Wait, but let's think about it. The Hamiltonian H is ε times the spin component in the direction of n. The eigenvalues of spin in any direction are ± (ħ/2) for spin-1/2 particles. Wait, but wait, in this problem, are the Pauli matrices scaled by ħ? Because usually, spin operators are S = (ħ/2) sigma. But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is ε sigma · n, which doesn't have the ħ/2 factor. So perhaps in this problem, the eigenvalues would be ± ε.

Wait, but no, because the Pauli matrices don't include the ħ/2 factor. So the eigenvalues would be ± ε, because when you have a matrix like sigma · n, its eigenvalues are ±1. So when you multiply by ε, the eigenvalues become ± ε.

Wait, but wait, let me confirm. The Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1. So any matrix of the form (a sigma_x + b sigma_y + c sigma_z) where a^2 + b^2 + c^2 =1 (since n is a unit vector) will have eigenvalues ± sqrt(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) ) ? No, because the eigenvalues of a Pauli vector (sigma · n) are ±1. Because any unit vector in spin space would have eigenvalues ±1. Because the spin matrices have that property.

Wait, let me think again. The eigenvalues of sigma · n are ±1 because sigma ·n is a traceless matrix with determinant -1. Because for a 2x2 matrix with trace zero, the determinant is the product of eigenvalues. So the eigenvalues are m and -m, so their product is -m^2. So determinant would be -m^2.

Wait, but sigma ·n is a traceless matrix, so its trace is zero. The determinant would be (eigenvalue1) * (eigenvalue2) = (m) * (-m) = -m^2.

But what is the determinant of sigma ·n?

The determinant of sigma ·n is the determinant of n_x sigma_x + n_y sigma_y + n_z sigma_z.

But each sigma_i has determinant -1. But when you have a sum of matrices, the determinant isn't simply the sum of determinants. Hmm, maybe another approach.

Alternatively, for any 2x2 traceless matrix M with M^2 = I, the eigenvalues are ±1. Because if M^2 = I, then M^2 - I =0, so the minimal polynomial is x^2 -1=0, so eigenvalues are ±1.

Wait, does (sigma ·n)^2 equal I?

Wait earlier when I took n along x, sigma_x^2 is I. So sigma_x^2 is I. So if n is along any axis, (sigma ·n)^2 = I.

Wait but in the previous example with n=(1/√2, 1/√2, 0), I found that S^2 = I + i sigma_z, which is not I. So that's conflicting.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in that calculation.

Wait, let me re-calculate S^2 for n=(1/√2, 1/√2, 0):

n_x = 1/√2, n_y = 1/√2, n_z=0.

So S = sigma_x (1/√2) + sigma_y (1/√2).

So S^2 = (1/√2 sigma_x + 1/√2 sigma_y)^2.

Expanding this:

= (1/√2)^2 sigma_x^2 + (1/√2)^2 sigma_y^2 + 2*(1/√2)(1/√2) sigma_x sigma_y.

Each sigma_i^2 is I, so (1/2) I + (1/2) I = I. The cross term is 2*(1/2) sigma_x sigma_y = sigma_x sigma_y.

But sigma_x sigma_y = i sigma_z. So S^2 = I + i sigma_z.

Wait, but I thought (sigma ·n)^2 should be I. So what gives?

Hmm, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe (sigma ·n)^2 is not equal to I. So perhaps the eigenvalues of sigma ·n are not ±1 in all cases.

Wait, but then how do I find the eigenvalues?

Alternatively, perhaps for any n, (sigma ·n)^2 = I. Let me try another example. Let n be (0,0,1), so S = sigma_z.

S^2 = sigma_z^2 = I. That works.

Another example: n = (0,1,0), S = sigma_y.

S^2 = sigma_y^2 = I. So that works.

But the earlier case with n=(1/√2, 1/√2, 0) gives S^2 = I + i sigma_z. Which is not equal to I. So something is wrong. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps when I compute S^2, I should take into account that (sigma_x + sigma_y)^2 = sigma_x^2 + sigma_y^2 + 2 sigma_x sigma_y.

But sigma_x sigma_y is i sigma_z. So S^2 = I + I + 2i sigma_z.

Wait, no, sigma_x^2 is I, sigma_y^2 is I. So the first two terms give 2I. The cross term is 2 * (1/√2)(1/√2) sigma_x sigma_y = 2*(1/2)(i sigma_z) = i sigma_z.

So S^2 = 2I + i sigma_z.

Wait, that's different. So S^2 = 2I + i sigma_z.

But that's a problem because if I'm to find the eigenvalues of H, which is ε S, then H^2 = ε^2 S^2. But if S^2 isn't I, then H^2 isn't ε^2 I either.

Hmm, maybe I should think differently. Let me just assume that the eigenvalues are ±ε, because the Pauli matrices have eigenvalues ±1 and H is ε times the Pauli vector.

Wait, but in the case where n is along a particular axis, the eigenvalues are ±ε. But in the case where n is pointing in some other direction, would the eigenvalues still be ±ε?

Wait, but perhaps the eigenvalues of sigma ·n are ±1 regardless of the direction of n. Because sigma ·n is a unit vector in spin space, and the eigenvalues are ±1. Because any spin operator in any direction has eigenvalues ±1.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. For example, if I have a spin-1/2 particle, the spin component in any direction has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. But in this case, the Pauli matrices are scaled without the ħ/2 factor. So in the problem, H is ε times the Pauli vector, so the eigenvalues would be ±ε.

Wait, but wait, the Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1, so any linear combination where the coefficients form a unit vector (like n is unit) would also have eigenvalues ±1.

Wait, here's another approach: for any unit vector n, the operator sigma ·n has eigenvalues ±1 because it's a spin-1/2 operator in direction n. So when you multiply by ε, the eigenvalues become ±ε.

So that would suggest that the eigenvalues of H are ±ε, which is option B.

Looking at the options:

Option B is ±ε.

Option C is ±(ε ħ/2). I don't think ħ is involved here because the problem doesn't mention it. So probably the correct answer is B.


The problem involves finding the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian operator \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \( \vec{n} \) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \( \varepsilon \) is a constant with the dimension of energy. Here's the analysis:

1. **Structure of the Hamiltonian**:  
   The Hamiltonian is a 2x2 matrix because it involves the Pauli spin matrices \( \vec{\sigma} = (\sigma_x, \sigma_y, \sigma_z) \), which are 2x2 matrices. The term \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) represents a linear combination of the Pauli matrices weighted by the components of \( \vec{n} \), a unit vector.

2. **Eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \)**:  
   For any unit vector \( \vec{n} \), the operator \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a traceless matrix with eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \). This is a general property of spin operators in quantum mechanics. The eigenvalues arise because the Pauli matrices represent spin-1/2 systems, and their combination in any direction has eigenvalues \( \pm 1 \).

3. **Scaling by \( \varepsilon \)**:  
   The Hamiltonian \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) scales the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) by \( \varepsilon \). Since the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) become \( \pm \varepsilon \).

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A (\(+1, -1\))**: Incorrect. The eigenvalues are not \( \pm 1 \) because the Hamiltonian is scaled by \( \varepsilon \).  
   - **Option B (\(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\))**: Correct. The eigenvalues of \( H \) are \( \pm \varepsilon \), as derived above.  
   - **Option C (\(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\))**: Incorrect. The factor \( \hbar/2 \) is not present in the problem, as the Hamiltonian is given in terms of the Pauli matrices without such a scaling.  
   - **Option D (\(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\))**: Incorrect. This option does not involve \( \varepsilon \) and is unrelated to the given Hamiltonian.

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm \varepsilon \).

Answer: B
