Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about ring-closing metathesis. Hmm, I remember that metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Ring-closing metathesis specifically forms a ring by connecting two alkenes. The product given is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. I need to find the starting material that would form this via metathesis.

Wait, ring-closing metathesis typically uses a Grubbs catalyst, right? The catalyst facilitates the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds. So in this process, two alkenes would exchange their ends, effectively connecting them to form a ring.

The product is a cyclohexene. So the starting material must have two alkenes that can come together to form the six-membered ring. Let me think about the structure. The product has substituents at positions 3,4, and 5. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond in the 1 position, so the ring is probably formed from a diene that's part of a larger molecule.

The starting material is likely an octadiene because the product is a cyclohexene. Let's picture the product. The starting molecule would have two alkenes at positions that, when they undergo metathesis, form the cyclohexene ring. So the diene in the starting material should be positioned such that when the ends connect, the appropriate substituents are in place.

Looking at the product structure: it's cyclohexene with substituents at 3,4 (both methyl) and 5 (isopropyl). So the cyclohexene ring is 1-ene, meaning the double bond is between C1 and C2. The ring structure would have six carbons. The substituents are on C3, C4, and C5.

So the starting material before ring closure would be a diene that, when parts of it are connected, forms the cyclohexene. Let me think about how the diene would look. For a ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes are usually on either end of a chain. So the starting molecule would be an octadiene, maybe in 1,7 positions, or 2,6, etc.

Wait, the product is cyclohexene, which has six carbons. So the starting molecule must have eight carbons, and after forming the ring (losing two carbons as ethylene?), but wait, no, metathesis doesn't lose carbons; it just rearranges the double bonds. Oh right, because in ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst facilitates the exchange of the ends of two alkenes to form a ring, so the number of carbons in the molecule doesn't change, except for the ethylene byproduct which is released.

Wait no, actually, in metathesis, the catalyst transfers the ends, so the two alkenes swap ends. So the starting material would have two alkenes in positions that, when they link, form the six-membered ring.

So the starting material is an octadiene. Let's say the two double bonds are in positions 1,7 and maybe another position? Or perhaps the diene is in the first and sixth positions?

Wait, to form a six-membered ring, the starting molecule must have a chain long enough so that when the ends connect, it forms a six-membered ring. Let's think about it: the molecule is an octadiene. So if the two alkenes are in positions 1 and 6, then the chain length between them would allow for a six-membered ring when they close.

Wait, no, octa means eight carbons. If the two alkenes are at positions 1 and 6, then the chain between them is six carbons. So when the catalyst breaks and reforms the double bonds, the ends connect, making a six-membered ring. So the structure would be octa-1,6-diene.

Wait, but the product is cyclohexene, so the starting material would be an octadiene, and upon closing, forms the ring, releasing ethylene or something.

But let me think about the substituents. The product has methyl groups at 3 and 4, and isopropyl at 5. So the starting material must have these groups in positions that, when the ring forms, they end up at those positions.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an octadiene with substituents in positions that, when the rings form, they end up in the correct positions.

Let me try to draw this out mentally. Suppose the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. So positions 1 and 6 have double bonds. When the ring closes, the double bonds would connect, so the two ends (C1 and C6) would become connected, forming a ring. The substituents at C3 and C4 are both methyl, and at C5 is isopropyl. So when the ring forms, the substituents would be in positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene.

Wait, no. Because in the starting material, the substituents are on the same carbon chain. Let me think about the numbering.

In the starting material, which is an octadiene, say, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, imagine the starting material as 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2

Wait, no, the octadiene would have two double bonds, but in this case, it's an 8-carbon chain with double bonds at 1 and 6. So positions 1 and 6 are double bonds, meaning that the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? But that doesn't have the substituents.

Wait no, the substituents would be at specific positions. So the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. That would mean the double bonds are at positions 1 and 6, and the substituents are at positions 3,4,5.

When the ring forms via metathesis, the double bonds at 1 and 6 would break, and the ends would connect. So the CH2 from position 1 would connect to the CH2 from position 6, but wait, that would form a ring. Let me see:

The starting material is:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2 ?

Wait, no. Wait, the starting material is an octa-1,6-diene, so double bonds between 1-2 and 6-7?

Wait, no. Wait, the diene is 1,7-diene, meaning double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8? Or 1,6-diene, meaning 1-2 and 6-7? Wait, octa-1,6-diene: the first double bond is between C1 and C2, the second between C6 and C7.

Wait, but that's a conjugated diene? No, not necessarily. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's just a single chain. But with substituents at 3,4,5.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is:

Positions 1-8:

1: CH2=
2: CH-
3: CH2-
4: CH(CH3)-
5: CH(CH3)-
6: CH2-
7: CH(CH2CH(CH3))-
8: CH2

Hmm, not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the ring closure.

In a ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes in the starting material are separated by a certain number of carbons such that when they close, they form a ring. For a six-membered ring, the two alkenes should be separated by four carbons. Because when you connect the ends, the number of atoms in the ring is the sum of the carbons between the alkenes plus the two carbons from each double bond. Wait, maybe another approach.

The distance between the two alkenes should be such that when they close, you get a six-membered ring. So the formula is: the number of carbons between the two double bonds plus the two ends equals six carbons.

Wait, for a six-membered ring, the starting material must have two alkenes separated by four carbons. So for example, if the first double bond is at positions 1 and 2, the second at positions 1+5=6 and 7. So the two alkenes are at 1-2 and 6-7. So the molecule is an octa-1,6-diene. But wait, no, octa-1,6-diene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't have substituents.

Wait the product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexene. So the substituents are in positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene. So in the starting material, the substituents would be in positions that, when the ring forms, they end up at 3,4,5.

Wait, when the starting material is octa-1,6-diene, the substituents would be on carbons 3,4,5. So when the ring forms, those substituents are on the cyclohexene ring. Let me visualize:

The starting material would be 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. Structure:

Positions 1-8:

1: CH2=
2: CH-
3: CH(CH3)-
4: CH(CH3)-
5: CH(CH2CH(CH3))-
6: CH2-
7: CH2=
8: CH2

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me try drawing this:

Consider the starting material as octa-1,6-diene with substituents at 3,4,5.

So the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2

But wait, that's an 8-carbon chain. So the two double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7. When the metathesis occurs, the double bonds would redistribute. The catalyst would break the double bonds and reorganize them, connecting the ends.

So, the Grubbs catalyst would facilitate the exchange. The two alkenes (1-2 and 6-7) would exchange their ends. So the CH2 from position 1 would connect to position 7, and the CH2 from position 2 would connect to position 6.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the two alkenes as A-B and C-D. The metathesis would form A-D and B-C.

So, in the starting material, the two alkenes are A-B (positions 1-2) and C-D (positions 6-7). Then, after metathesis, the new alkenes would be A-D and B-C. So the molecule would form a ring by connecting A to D and B to C.

So, the starting material is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the substituent positions wrong. Let me think about the product: cyclohexene with substituents on C3,4,5.

So, in the cyclohexene ring, the substituents come from the middle of the starting chain.

So the starting material's substituents at 3,4,5 would end up in positions 3,4,5 of the ring.

So, in the starting material, positions 1 and 8 are the ends with the double bonds.

Wait, if the starting material is octa-1,7-diene, then the double bonds are at 1-2 and 7-8. That would give a longer chain between the two alkenes. If the starting material is octa-1,7-diene, the distance between the alkenes is 5 carbons (since 7-1=6, but that's the position, the actual chain between would be 6-2=4? Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of atoms between the alkenes.

Wait, for a six-membered ring, the two alkenes need to be separated by four carbons. So if the starting material is an octa-1,6-diene, the two alkenes are at 1-2 and 6-7. So the chain between them is 4 carbons (positions 3,4,5,6? Wait, no, positions 3,4,5: from 2 to 6 is positions 3,4,5,6? That's four carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that when the ring forms, the two ends (from the alkenes) are connected. The number of carbons in the ring would be the sum of the carbons between the two alkenes plus the two ends.

Wait, perhaps the general formula is for the ring size N, the number of atoms between the two alkenes (including the ends) is N. So for a six-membered ring, the two alkenes are separated by four carbons because 4 + 2 =6.

So, starting material is an octa-1,6-diene. So positions 1-2 and 6-7 have double bonds. The substituents are at 3,4,5.

So, when the ring closes, the 1 (CH2=CH-) and 6 (CH2-CH2=) parts would connect. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to number the starting material.

The starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So the structure is:

1  2  3    4    5         6  7 8
CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH=CH2

Wait, no, that can't be right because the substituents at 5 would have an isopropyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent at position 5 in the starting material is an isopropyl group attached to the main chain. So when the ring forms, that isopropyl would end up at position 5 of the cyclohexene.

So, in the starting material, the substituents are at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). The two double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7.

When the metathesis occurs, the double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7 would break, and the ends would connect to form a six-membered ring.

So, the product would have the substituents from positions 3,4,5 in the starting material now at positions 3,4,5 on the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, but the product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So the substituents match up correctly.

So looking at the options, option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. That matches our starting material.

Wait, let me check the options:

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene

Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene

Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene

Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene

So option C is the starting material with two alkenes at 1 and 6, and substituents at 3,4,5.

Upon ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes would form a cyclohexene with substituents in the correct positions.

Wait, but the product is cyclohex-1-ene. So the double bond is at position 1. So, in the starting material, the alkenes are at 1 and 6 (positions 1-2 and 6-7). Upon metathesis, the alkenes would re-form as 1,2 in the ring. So the product would have the double bond at 1.

Yes, that makes sense.

So the correct starting material is option C.

To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, we analyze the reaction mechanism and the structure of the product. Ring-closing metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments to form a ring, typically facilitated by a Grubbs catalyst. The product, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, is a six-membered ring with a double bond at position 1 and substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl).

The starting material must be an octadiene with two alkenes positioned such that, upon metathesis, the ends of the chain connect to form the cyclohexene ring. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the starting material will end up in the same positions in the product. For the reaction to form a six-membered ring, the two alkenes in the starting material must be separated by four carbons, which ensures the correct ring size after closure.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. This structure has double bonds at positions 1 and 7, which are too far apart to form a six-membered ring. This is incorrect.
- **Option B**: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene. The double bonds at positions 2 and 6 are not positioned correctly to form the desired cyclohexene structure. This is incorrect.
- **Option C**: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. This structure has double bonds at positions 1 and 6, which are separated by four carbons. Upon metathesis, these alkenes will form the six-membered ring with the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5. This matches the product structure and is correct.
- **Option D**: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. The substituents are incorrectly positioned, and the double bonds at positions 1 and 7 are too far apart to form the desired ring. This is incorrect.

The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**, as it has the appropriate substituents and double bond positions to yield the desired product via ring-closing metathesis.

Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here about ring-closing metathesis. Hmm, I remember that metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments. Ring-closing metathesis specifically forms a ring by connecting two alkenes. The product given is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene.

Wait, ring-closing metathesis typically uses a Grubbs catalyst, right? The catalyst facilitates the breaking and reforming of carbon-carbon double bonds. So in this process, two alkenes would exchange their ends, effectively connecting them to form a ring.

The product is a cyclohexene. So the starting material must have two alkenes that can come together to form the six-membered ring. Let me think about the structure. The product has substituents at positions 3,4, and 5. The cyclohexene ring has a double bond in the 1 position, so the ring is probably formed from a diene that's part of a larger molecule.

The starting material is likely an octadiene because the product is a cyclohexene. Let's picture the product. The starting molecule would have two alkenes at positions that, when they undergo metathesis, form the cyclohexene ring. So the diene in the starting material should be positioned such that when the ends connect, the appropriate substituents are in place.

Looking at the product structure: it's cyclohexene with substituents at 3,4 (both methyl) and 5 (isopropyl). So the cyclohexene ring is 1-ene, meaning the double bond is between C1 and C2. The ring structure would have six carbons. The substituents are on C3, C4, and C5.

So the starting material before ring closure would be a diene that, when parts of it are connected, forms the cyclohexene. Let me think about how the diene would look. For a ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes are usually on either end of a chain. So the starting molecule would be an octadiene, maybe in 1,7 positions, or 2,6, etc.

Wait, the product is cyclohexene, which has six carbons. So the starting molecule must have eight carbons, and after forming the ring (losing two carbons as ethylene?), but wait, no, metathesis doesn't lose carbons; it just rearranges the double bonds. Oh right, because in ring-closing metathesis, the catalyst facilitates the exchange of the ends of two alkenes to form a ring, so the number of carbons in the molecule doesn't change, except for the ethylene byproduct which is released.

Wait no, actually, in metathesis, the catalyst transfers the ends, so the two alkenes swap ends. So the starting material would have two alkenes in positions that, when they link, form the six-membered ring.

So the starting material is an octadiene. Let's say the two double bonds are in positions 1,7 and maybe another position? Or perhaps the diene is in the first and sixth positions?

Wait, to form a six-membered ring, the starting molecule must have a chain long enough so that when the ends connect, it forms a six-membered ring. Let's think about it: the molecule is an octadiene. So if the two alkenes are in positions 1 and 6, then the chain length between them would allow for a six-membered ring when they close.

Wait, no, octa means eight carbons. If the two alkenes are at positions 1 and 6, then the chain between them is six carbons. So when the catalyst breaks and reforms the double bonds, the ends connect, making a six-membered ring. So the structure would be octa-1,6-diene.

Wait, but the product is cyclohexene, so the starting material would be an octadiene, and upon closing, forms the ring, releasing ethylene or something.

But let me think about the substituents. The product has methyl groups at 3 and 4, and isopropyl at 5. So the starting material must have these groups in positions that, when the ring forms, they end up at those positions.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an octadiene with substituents in positions that, when the rings form, they end up in the correct positions.

Let me try to draw this out mentally. Suppose the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. So positions 1 and 6 have double bonds. When the ring closes, the double bonds would connect, so the two ends (C1 and C6) would become connected, forming a ring. The substituents at C3 and C4 are both methyl, and at C5 is isopropyl. So when the ring forms, the substituents would be in positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene.

Wait, no. Because in the starting material, the substituents are on the same carbon chain. Let me think about the numbering.

In the starting material, which is an octadiene, say, the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Alternatively, imagine the starting material as 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2

Wait, no, the octadiene would have two double bonds, but in this case, it's an 8-carbon chain with double bonds at 1 and 6. So positions 1 and 6 are double bonds, meaning that the structure is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2? But that doesn't have the substituents.

Wait no, the substituents would be at specific positions. So the starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. That would mean the double bonds are at positions 1 and 6, and the substituents are at positions 3,4,5.

When the ring forms via metathesis, the double bonds at 1 and 6 would break, and the ends would connect. So the CH2 from position 1 would connect to the CH2 from position 6, but wait, that would form a ring. Let me see:

The starting material is:

1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
CH2-CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2 ?

Wait, no. Wait, the starting material is an octa-1,6-diene, so double bonds between 1-2 and 6-7?

Wait, no. Wait, the diene is 1,7-diene, meaning double bonds at 1-2 and 7-8? Or 1,6-diene, meaning 1-2 and 6-7? Wait, octa-1,6-diene: the first double bond is between C1 and C2, the second between C6 and C7.

Wait, but that's a conjugated diene? No, not necessarily. So the structure would be:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that's just a single chain. But with substituents at 3,4,5.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is:

Positions 1-8:

1: CH2=
2: CH-
3: CH2-
4: CH(CH3)-
5: CH(CH3)-
6: CH2-
7: CH(CH2CH(CH3))-
8: CH2

Hmm, not sure. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the ring closure.

In a ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes in the starting material are separated by a certain number of carbons such that when they close, they form a ring. For a six-membered ring, the two alkenes should be separated by four carbons. Because when you connect the ends, the number of atoms in the ring is the sum of the carbons between the alkenes plus the two carbons from each double bond. Wait, maybe another approach.

The distance between the two alkenes should be such that when they close, you get a six-membered ring. So the formula is: the number of carbons between the two double bonds plus the two ends equals six carbons.

Wait, for a six-membered ring, the starting material must have two alkenes separated by four carbons. So for example, if the first double bond is at positions 1 and 2, the second at positions 1+5=6 and 7. So the two alkenes are at 1-2 and 6-7. So the molecule is an octa-1,6-diene. But wait, no, octa-1,6-diene is CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2, but that doesn't have substituents.

Wait the product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohexene. So the substituents are in positions 3,4,5 of the cyclohexene. So in the starting material, the substituents would be in positions that, when the ring forms, they end up at 3,4,5.

Wait, when the starting material is octa-1,6-diene, the substituents would be on carbons 3,4,5. So when the ring forms, those substituents are on the cyclohexene ring. Let me visualize:

The starting material would be 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. Structure:

Positions 1-8:

1: CH2=
2: CH-
3: CH(CH3)-
4: CH(CH3)-
5: CH(CH2CH(CH3))-
6: CH2-
7: CH2=
8: CH2

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me try drawing this:

Consider the starting material as octa-1,6-diene with substituents at 3,4,5.

So the structure is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH2

But wait, that's an 8-carbon chain. So the two double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7. When the metathesis occurs, the double bonds would redistribute. The catalyst would break the double bonds and reorganize them, connecting the ends.

So, the Grubbs catalyst would facilitate the exchange. The two alkenes (1-2 and 6-7) would exchange their ends. So the CH2 from position 1 would connect to position 7, and the CH2 from position 2 would connect to position 6.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the two alkenes as A-B and C-D. The metathesis would form A-D and B-C.

So, in the starting material, the two alkenes are A-B (positions 1-2) and C-D (positions 6-7). Then, after metathesis, the new alkenes would be A-D and B-C. So the molecule would form a ring by connecting A to D and B to C.

So, the starting material is:

CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the substituent positions wrong. Let me think about the product: cyclohexene with substituents on C3,4,5.

So, in the cyclohexene ring, the substituents come from the middle of the starting chain.

So the starting material's substituents at 3,4,5 would end up in positions 3,4,5 of the ring.

So, in the starting material, positions 1 and 8 are the ends with the double bonds.

Wait, if the starting material is octa-1,7-diene, then the double bonds are at 1-2 and 7-8. That would give a longer chain between the two alkenes. If the starting material is octa-1,7-diene, the distance between the alkenes is 5 carbons (since 7-1=6, but that's the position, the actual chain between would be 6-2=4? Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of atoms between the alkenes.

Wait, for a six-membered ring, the two alkenes need to be separated by four carbons. So if the starting material is an octa-1,6-diene, the two alkenes are at 1-2 and 6-7. So the chain between them is 4 carbons (positions 3,4,5,6? Wait, no, positions 3,4,5: from 2 to 6 is positions 3,4,5,6? That's four carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that when the ring forms, the two ends (from the alkenes) are connected. The number of carbons in the ring would be the sum of the carbons between the two alkenes plus the two ends.

Wait, perhaps the general formula is for the ring size N, the number of atoms between the two alkenes (including the ends) is N. So for a six-membered ring, the two alkenes are separated by four carbons because 4 + 2 =6.

So, starting material is an octa-1,6-diene. So positions 1-2 and 6-7 have double bonds. The substituents are at 3,4,5.

So, when the ring closes, the 1 (CH2=CH-) and 6 (CH2-CH2=) parts would connect. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps it's easier to number the starting material.

The starting material is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene.

So the structure is:

1  2  3    4    5         6  7 8
CH2=CH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH(CH2CH(CH3))-CH2-CH=CH2

Wait, no, that can't be right because the substituents at 5 would have an isopropyl group.

Wait, maybe the substituent at position 5 in the starting material is an isopropyl group attached to the main chain. So when the ring forms, that isopropyl would end up at position 5 of the cyclohexene.

So, in the starting material, the substituents are at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl). The two double bonds are at 1-2 and 6-7.

When the metathesis occurs, the double bonds at 1-2 and 6-7 would break, and the ends would connect to form a six-membered ring.

So, the product would have the substituents from positions 3,4,5 in the starting material now at positions 3,4,5 on the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, but the product is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene. So the substituents match up correctly.

So looking at the options, option C is 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. That matches our starting material.

Wait, let me check the options:

Option A: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene

Option B: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene

Option C: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene

Option D: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene

So option C is the starting material with two alkenes at 1 and 6, and substituents at 3,4,5.

Upon ring-closing metathesis, the two alkenes would form a cyclohexene with substituents in the correct positions.

Wait, but the product is cyclohex-1-ene. So the double bond is at position 1. So, in the starting material, the alkenes are at 1 and 6 (positions 1-2 and 6-7). Upon metathesis, the alkenes would re-form as 1,2 in the ring. So the product would have the double bond at 1.

Yes, that makes sense.

So the correct starting material is option C.


To determine the starting material needed to synthesize 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene via ring-closing metathesis, we analyze the reaction mechanism and the structure of the product. Ring-closing metathesis involves the redistribution of alkene fragments to form a ring, typically facilitated by a Grubbs catalyst. The product, 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylcyclohex-1-ene, is a six-membered ring with a double bond at position 1 and substituents at positions 3 (methyl), 4 (methyl), and 5 (isopropyl).

The starting material must be an octadiene with two alkenes positioned such that, upon metathesis, the ends of the chain connect to form the cyclohexene ring. The substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5 in the starting material will end up in the same positions in the product. For the reaction to form a six-membered ring, the two alkenes in the starting material must be separated by four carbons, which ensures the correct ring size after closure.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. This structure has double bonds at positions 1 and 7, which are too far apart to form a six-membered ring. This is incorrect.
- **Option B**: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-2,6-diene. The double bonds at positions 2 and 6 are not positioned correctly to form the desired cyclohexene structure. This is incorrect.
- **Option C**: 5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene. This structure has double bonds at positions 1 and 6, which are separated by four carbons. Upon metathesis, these alkenes will form the six-membered ring with the substituents at positions 3, 4, and 5. This matches the product structure and is correct.
- **Option D**: 4-isopropyl-5,6-dimethylocta-1,7-diene. The substituents are incorrectly positioned, and the double bonds at positions 1 and 7 are too far apart to form the desired ring. This is incorrect.

The correct starting material is **5-isopropyl-3,4-dimethylocta-1,6-diene**, as it has the appropriate substituents and double bond positions to yield the desired product via ring-closing metathesis.
