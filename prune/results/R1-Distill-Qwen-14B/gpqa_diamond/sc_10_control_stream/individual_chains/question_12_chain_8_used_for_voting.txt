Alright, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the kinetic energy of the product particles in a decay process. Let's see, the question says that a Pi-plus particle at rest decays into a mu-plus and a neutrino. The rest masses are given: Pi-plus is 139.6 MeV, and mu-plus is 105.7 MeV. The options are A to D, each giving two KE values, presumably for the muon and the neutrino.

Hmm, okay, I remember that in particle physics, when a particle at rest decays, the total energy and momentum must be conserved. Since the pion is at rest, its initial momentum is zero. So the products, muon and neutrino, must have equal and opposite momenta to sum to zero.

Wait, but neutrinos are tricky because they have such tiny (practically zero) mass. I think I can consider the neutrino as massless for this problem. So the muon and neutrino would share the energy from the pion's rest mass, minus their own rest mass energies.

The pion's rest energy is 139.6 MeV. The muon's rest energy is 105.7 MeV. The neutrino's rest energy is negligible, maybe taken as zero.

So the total energy available for the decay products is the pion's rest energy. But the muon has its rest mass to account for, and the neutrino's energy is all kinetic plus its (negligible) rest mass energy.

Let me think in terms of four-momentum. The pion's four-momentum is (E, 0) where E is 139.6 MeV. The decay products must have four-momenta that add up to this.

The muon's four-momentum is (E_mu, p_mu), and the neutrino's is (E_nu, p_nu). Since the pion is at rest, the total momentum vectors must add to zero. So p_mu = -p_nu. But since neutrinos are (nearly) massless, their energy is approximately |p_nu| * c, but since we're working in MeV and masses, probably we can ignore some constants by choosing units where c=1.

Wait, in particle physics, units are often such that c=1 and ħ=1. So, for the neutrino, E_nu = |p_nu|, since m_nu ≈ 0. So p_nu = E_nu.

Similarly, for the muon, E_mu² = (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c^2)^2. But since c=1, E_mu² = p_mu² + m_mu².

But since p_mu = -p_nu, their magnitudes are the same. So |p_mu| = |p_nu| = p, let's say.

So E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), and E_nu = p.

The total energy must be the pion's rest energy:

E_mu + E_nu = m_pi.

So sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

Hmm, I can set up this equation and solve for p.

Let me plug in the numbers. m_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV.

So sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Let me subtract p from both sides:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p.

Now square both sides:

p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side:

= (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * p + p^2.

So p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p + p^2.

Subtract p^2 from both sides:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p.

Bring the 19488.16 to the left:

11172.49 - 19488.16 = -279.2 p.

Calculating 11172.49 -19488.16: that's about -8315.67.

So -8315.67 = -279.2 p.

Divide both sides by -279.2:

p = (-8315.67) / (-279.2) ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that. 279.2 * 29 is about 8098.8 (since 279 *30=8370, but subtract 279 gives 8091). 8315.67-8091=224.67. 224.67 /279.2 ≈ 0.805. So p ≈ 29.805 MeV.

So p is approximately 29.8 MeV.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the math because I might have messed up in the subtraction.

Wait, the equation was:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p.

Subtract 19488.16 from both sides:

11172.49 - 19488.16 = -279.2 p.

Which is:

-8315.67 = -279.2 p.

Divide both sides by -279.2:

p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that more accurately.

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2 = 8376-279.2=8096.8.

So 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

Now, 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

So 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.782.

So p ≈ 29.782 MeV. Let's say 29.78 MeV.

So p ≈ 29.78 MeV.

Then E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ).

Compute p^2: (29.78)^2 ≈ 886.48.

m_mu^2 is (105.7)^2 = 11172.49.

So E_mu^2 = 886.48 + 11172.49 = 12058.97.

E_mu = sqrt(12058.97) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, m_pi was 139.6 MeV. Then E_mu is 109.81 MeV, and E_nu is p=29.78 MeV. Together, 109.81 + 29.78 ≈ 139.59 MeV, which is close to 139.6. That seems correct.

Now, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy.

For the muon, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

For the neutrino, KE_nu = E_nu - m_nu. Since m_nu ≈ 0, KE_nu ≈ E_nu =29.78 MeV.

So the KEs are approximately 4.11 MeV and 29.78 MeV.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV. That must be the correct choice.

Wait, let me see the options again.

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV. Yep, that matches.

So the answer is D.

To solve the problem, we analyze the decay process of a stationary π⁺ particle into a μ⁺ particle and a neutrino. The rest masses are given as follows:  
- Rest mass of π⁺: \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \)  
- Rest mass of μ⁺: \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)  
- Rest mass of neutrino: \( m_{\nu} \approx 0 \, \text{MeV} \)  

Since the π⁺ is at rest, its total energy is its rest energy: \( E_{\pi^+} = m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \). The total energy of the decay products (μ⁺ and neutrino) must equal this value due to energy conservation. Additionally, momentum conservation requires the μ⁺ and neutrino to have equal and opposite momenta.  

Let the momentum of the μ⁺ and neutrino be \( p \). For the μ⁺, its energy is given by:  
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]  
For the neutrino, its energy is approximately equal to its momentum since its rest mass is negligible:  
\[
E_{\nu} = p.
\]  
The total energy of the system is:  
\[
E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu} = m_{\pi^+}.
\]  
Substituting \( E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} \) and \( E_{\nu} = p \), we get:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p = m_{\pi^+}.
\]  
Substituting the numerical values:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} + p = 139.6.
\]  
Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root:  
\[
p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]  
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p + p^2.
\]  
Canceling \( p^2 \) and rearranging:  
\[
11172.49 - 19488.16 = -279.2p.
\]  
\[
-8315.67 = -279.2p.
\]  
Solving for \( p \):  
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  

Now, calculate the energy of the μ⁺:  
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]  
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{886.48 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12058.97} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The kinetic energy of the μ⁺ is:  
\[
KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum:  
\[
E_{\nu} = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, its kinetic energy is:  
\[
KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  

Thus, the kinetic energies of the μ⁺ and neutrino are approximately \( 4.11 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:  
**Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**

So E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2), and E_nu = p.

The total energy must be the pion's rest energy:

E_mu + E_nu = m_pi.

So sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) + p = m_pi.

Hmm, I can set up this equation and solve for p.

Let me plug in the numbers. m_pi = 139.6 MeV, m_mu = 105.7 MeV.

So sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p = 139.6.

Let me subtract p from both sides:

sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) = 139.6 - p.

Now square both sides:

p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.

Expanding the right side:

= (139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 * p + p^2.

So p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p + p^2.

Subtract p^2 from both sides:

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2 p.

Bring the 19488.16 to the left:

11172.49 - 19488.16 = -279.2 p.

Calculating 11172.49 -19488.16: that's about -8315.67.

So -8315.67 = -279.2 p.

Divide both sides by -279.2:

p = (-8315.67) / (-279.2) ≈ 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that. 279.2 * 29 is about 8098.8 (since 279 *30=8370, but subtract 279 gives 8091). 8315.67-8091=224.67. 224.67 /279.2 ≈ 0.805. So p ≈ 29.805 MeV.

So p is approximately 29.8 MeV.

Which is:

-8315.67 = -279.2 p.

Divide both sides by -279.2:

p = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that more accurately.

279.2 * 29 = 279.2 *30=8376 minus 279.2 = 8376-279.2=8096.8.

So 279.2 * 29 = 8096.8.

Now, 8315.67 - 8096.8 = 218.87.

So 218.87 / 279.2 ≈ 0.782.

So p ≈ 29.782 MeV. Let's say 29.78 MeV.

So p ≈ 29.78 MeV.

Then E_mu = sqrt( p^2 + m_mu^2 ).

Compute p^2: (29.78)^2 ≈ 886.48.

m_mu^2 is (105.7)^2 = 11172.49.

So E_mu^2 = 886.48 + 11172.49 = 12058.97.

E_mu = sqrt(12058.97) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, m_pi was 139.6 MeV. Then E_mu is 109.81 MeV, and E_nu is p=29.78 MeV. Together, 109.81 + 29.78 ≈ 139.59 MeV, which is close to 139.6. That seems correct.

Now, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy.

For the muon, KE_mu = E_mu - m_mu = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 MeV.

For the neutrino, KE_nu = E_nu - m_nu. Since m_nu ≈ 0, KE_nu ≈ E_nu =29.78 MeV.

So the KEs are approximately 4.11 MeV and 29.78 MeV.

- Rest mass of π⁺: \( m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \)  
- Rest mass of μ⁺: \( m_{\mu^+} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)  
- Rest mass of neutrino: \( m_{\nu} \approx 0 \, \text{MeV} \)  

Since the π⁺ is at rest, its total energy is its rest energy: \( E_{\pi^+} = m_{\pi^+} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \). The total energy of the decay products (μ⁺ and neutrino) must equal this value due to energy conservation. Additionally, momentum conservation requires the μ⁺ and neutrino to have equal and opposite momenta.  

Let the momentum of the μ⁺ and neutrino be \( p \). For the μ⁺, its energy is given by:  
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2}.
\]  
For the neutrino, its energy is approximately equal to its momentum since its rest mass is negligible:  
\[
E_{\nu} = p.
\]  
The total energy of the system is:  
\[
E_{\mu^+} + E_{\nu} = m_{\pi^+}.
\]  
Substituting \( E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} \) and \( E_{\nu} = p \), we get:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} + p = m_{\pi^+}.
\]  
Substituting the numerical values:  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + (105.7)^2} + p = 139.6.
\]  
Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root:  
\[
p^2 + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]  
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p + p^2.
\]  
Canceling \( p^2 \) and rearranging:  
\[
11172.49 - 19488.16 = -279.2p.
\]  
\[
-8315.67 = -279.2p.
\]  
Solving for \( p \):  
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  

Now, calculate the energy of the μ⁺:  
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu^+}^2} = \sqrt{(29.78)^2 + (105.7)^2}.
\]  
\[
E_{\mu^+} = \sqrt{886.48 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12058.97} \approx 109.81 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The kinetic energy of the μ⁺ is:  
\[
KE_{\mu^+} = E_{\mu^+} - m_{\mu^+} = 109.81 - 105.7 = 4.11 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
The neutrino's energy is equal to its momentum:  
\[
E_{\nu} = p = 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  
Since the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, its kinetic energy is:  
\[
KE_{\nu} = E_{\nu} \approx 29.78 \, \text{MeV}.
\]  

Thus, the kinetic energies of the μ⁺ and neutrino are approximately \( 4.11 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( 29.78 \, \text{MeV} \), respectively. Comparing with the options, the closest match is:  
**Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.**
