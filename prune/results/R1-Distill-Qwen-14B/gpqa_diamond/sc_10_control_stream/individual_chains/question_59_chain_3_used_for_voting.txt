Okay, so I need to find the pH of this solution. Hmm, the problem gives me three different solutions mixed together: acetic acid, HCl, and barium hydroxide. I remember that when you mix acids and bases, they can neutralize each other. So I should probably figure out how much acid and base I have in total and see if they neutralize each other completely or not.

First, let's note the concentrations and volumes of each solution.

For CH3COOH (acetic acid), it's 500 mL of 0.1 M. Acetic acid is a weak acid, so it won't dissociate completely, but for the purpose of neutralization, I think I can consider it as providing H+ ions, but maybe I should handle it separately since it's weak.

Then, HCl is a strong acid: 400 mL of 0.2 M. HCl dissociates completely, so it's straightforward.

Ba(OH)2 is a strong base: 300 mL of 0.3 M. Barium hydroxide dissociates into Ba²+ and OH⁻ ions. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH⁻. So that's something to keep in mind.

Wait, I should calculate the total moles of H+ and OH- from each solution.

Let me start by calculating the moles for each.

For CH3COOH:
Molarity is 0.1 M, volume 0.5 L. Moles = 0.1 * 0.5 = 0.05 moles.

HCl:
0.2 M, 0.4 L. Moles = 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 moles. Since HCl is a strong acid, each mole gives one H+.

Ba(OH)2:
0.3 M, 0.3 L. Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH⁻, so total OH- is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Now, when these are mixed together, the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate. So the H+ from CH3COOH isn't all available. But when you mix it with a strong base, does the H+ from the acid react with the OH-?

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. So the reaction between acids and bases is H+ + OH- → H2O. But the strength of the acid affects how much H+ is available.

Wait, but when you mix all of them together, the H+ from the strong acid (HCl) and whatever H+ the weak acid contributes will be neutralized by the OH- from the base.

So maybe I should first calculate the total moles of H+ and OH-.

Wait, but CH3COOH is a weak acid. How much H+ will it contribute? Since it's a weak acid, it won't donate all its H+. But when you mix it with a strong base, maybe the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid. Because OH- is a strong base, it will take H+ from any available source, including the weak acid.

So perhaps all the H+ from the weak acid will react with OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps I should first calculate the total H+ and OH- moles, considering that the weak acid's H+ is only partially available.

Wait, maybe I should think about all the H+ sources and the OH- sources.

So, H+ comes from HCl and CH3COOH. OH- comes from Ba(OH)2.

But, I'm not sure if Ba(OH)2 will completely neutralize the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, or if some excess OH- remains, or if some H+ remains.

So let's calculate the moles of H+ and OH-.

H+ from HCl: 0.08 moles.

H+ from CH3COOH: it's a weak acid, so I can't just say 0.05 moles of H+. But in the presence of OH-, which is a strong base, the OH- will deprotonate the acetic acid. So the OH- will react with the acetic acid to form acetate ions and water.

Wait, so the OH- might not only react with H+ from HCl but also with H+ from CH3COOH.

So perhaps the order of reactions is important. The OH- is a strong base, so it will neutralize the H+ from the strongest acid first, which is HCl, and then any remaining OH- will neutralize the H+ from the weaker acid, CH3COOH.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the total H+ available from all sources, but that's complicated because the weak acid only partially dissociates.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to find the total moles of H+ (from both strong and weak acids) and the total moles of OH- (from the base). Then, find out which is in excess, and calculate the pH based on that.

Wait, but I'm not sure if the weak acid's H+ is fully neutralizable by the OH-.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the total H+ and OH- and see which is in excess.

Wait, let me try this approach.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.08 mol.

Total OH- from Ba(OH)2: 0.18 mol.

So, the OH- can react with H+.

But wait, the H+ comes also from CH3COOH. How much H+ can that contribute?

Wait, the CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. It's a weak acid, so in solution, it doesn't fully dissociate. But when you add a strong base, the OH- will react with any available H+.

Wait, perhaps the OH- will first neutralize the H+ from HCl, and then any remaining OH- will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH.

So let's see:

Total OH- = 0.18 mol.

Total H+ from HCl is 0.08 mol.

So OH- reacts with H+ from HCl:

0.08 mol H+ + 0.08 mol OH- → 0.08 mol H2O.

That leaves OH- remaining: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Now, the remaining OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

CH3COOH contributes some H+. But how much?

In pure water, the dissociation of CH3COOH is given by Ka = 1.8e-5. But when OH- is present, it will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH. So each OH- can neutralize one H+ from CH3COOH.

So, if we have 0.05 mol of CH3COOH initially, and 0.10 mol of OH- left after neutralizing HCl, then the OH- will take H+ from CH3COOH.

So, the OH- will take 0.05 mol H+ from CH3COOH, turning into 0.05 mol of acetate ions (CH3COO^-) and 0.05 mol of water.

Wait, but I have 0.10 mol of OH- after neutralizing HCl. So, 0.05 mol of OH- will react with the 0.05 mol of H+ from CH3COOH, turning CH3COOH into CH3COO^- and water.

That leaves 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol of OH- remaining.

Wait, but wait, the original CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. So if all of its H+ is neutralized by OH-, that's 0.05 mol of OH- used, leaving 0.05 mol of OH- unreacted.

So, the total OH- after all reactions is 0.05 mol.

Now, the total volume of the solution is 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

Then, pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I do that right? Because, after neutralizing all HCl and CH3COOH, the remaining OH- is 0.05 mol. So, the solution is basic.

So, the pH would be 12.62. Which is option A.

Wait, but let me check the math again.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 mol OH-.

Then, H+ from HCl is 0.08. So OH- first neutralizes that, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol of OH-.

Then, OH- neutralizes CH3COOH: CH3COOH is 0.05 mol, which can donate 0.05 mol of H+ (since each CH3COOH can give one H+).

So, OH- takes 0.05 mol of H+, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol of OH-.

Total volume is 500 +400 +300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

[OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M.

pOH is log(0.041666) → Let me calculate that.

Wait, log(0.041666) is log(4.1666e-2) → log(4.1666) is about 0.619, so 0.619 - 2 = -1.381. So pOH is 1.381, so pH is 14-1.381=12.619, approximately 12.62.

So the answer would be option A: 12.62.

Wait, but let me think again. What if the CH3COOH doesn't fully donate all its H+? Because it's a weak acid, maybe not all 0.05 mol of H+ is available to react with OH-.

But wait, OH- is a strong base. It will deprotonate the acetic acid. So even though acetic acid is weak, the OH- will take H+ from it because OH- is a stronger base. So all the H+ from CH3COOH would be neutralized by OH-.

So the calculation is correct. So the pH is 12.62. So the correct option is A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the mixing of three solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (strong base). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - **H⁺ from HCl:**  
     Moles = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻.  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **H⁺ from CH₃COOH:**  
     CH₃COOH is a weak acid, but in the presence of OH⁻, it will donate H⁺.  
     Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since each CH₃COOH molecule can donate one H⁺, the total H⁺ available from CH₃COOH is \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - OH⁻ reacts with H⁺ from HCl first:  
     \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H⁺ (from HCl)} + 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH⁻} \to 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H₂O} \).  
     Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \).
   - Remaining OH⁻ reacts with H⁺ from CH₃COOH:  
     \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H⁺ (from CH₃COOH)} + 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH⁻} \to 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H₂O} \).  
     Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Calculate concentration of OH⁻:**
   - Total volume of the solution = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
   - Concentration of OH⁻ = \( \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M} \).

4. **Calculate pH:**
   - \( \text{pOH} = -\log[OH⁻] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).  
   - \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

Thus, the pH of the solution is approximately **12.62**.

Okay, so I need to find the pH of this solution. Hmm, the problem gives me three different solutions mixed together: acetic acid, HCl, and barium hydroxide.

But, I'm not sure if Ba(OH)2 will completely neutralize the H+ from HCl and CH3COOH, or if some excess OH- remains, or if some H+ remains.

So OH- reacts with H+ from HCl:

0.08 mol H+ + 0.08 mol OH- → 0.08 mol H2O.

That leaves OH- remaining: 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol.

Now, the remaining OH- will react with the H+ from CH3COOH.

CH3COOH contributes some H+. But how much?

In pure water, the dissociation of CH3COOH is given by Ka = 1.8e-5. But when OH- is present, it will neutralize the H+ from CH3COOH. So each OH- can neutralize one H+ from CH3COOH.

So, if we have 0.05 mol of CH3COOH initially, and 0.10 mol of OH- left after neutralizing HCl, then the OH- will take H+ from CH3COOH.

So, the OH- will take 0.05 mol H+ from CH3COOH, turning into 0.05 mol of acetate ions (CH3COO^-) and 0.05 mol of water.

Wait, but I have 0.10 mol of OH- after neutralizing HCl. So, 0.05 mol of OH- will react with the 0.05 mol of H+ from CH3COOH, turning CH3COOH into CH3COO^- and water.

That leaves 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol of OH- remaining.

Wait, but wait, the original CH3COOH is 0.05 mol. So if all of its H+ is neutralized by OH-, that's 0.05 mol of OH- used, leaving 0.05 mol of OH- unreacted.

So, the total OH- after all reactions is 0.05 mol.

Now, the total volume of the solution is 500 mL + 400 mL + 300 mL = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

So, the concentration of OH- is 0.05 mol / 1.2 L ≈ 0.0416667 M.

Then, pOH = -log(0.0416667) ≈ 1.38.

Then, pH = 14 - 1.38 ≈ 12.62.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I do that right? Because, after neutralizing all HCl and CH3COOH, the remaining OH- is 0.05 mol. So, the solution is basic.

So, the pH would be 12.62. Which is option A.

Wait, but let me check the math again.

Total H+ from HCl: 0.2 * 0.4 = 0.08 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.18 mol OH-.

Then, H+ from HCl is 0.08. So OH- first neutralizes that, leaving 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 mol of OH-.

Then, OH- neutralizes CH3COOH: CH3COOH is 0.05 mol, which can donate 0.05 mol of H+ (since each CH3COOH can give one H+).

So, OH- takes 0.05 mol of H+, leaving 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 mol of OH-.

Total volume is 500 +400 +300 = 1200 mL = 1.2 L.

[OH-] = 0.05 / 1.2 = 0.041666... M.

pOH is log(0.041666) → Let me calculate that.

Wait, log(0.041666) is log(4.1666e-2) → log(4.1666) is about 0.619, so 0.619 - 2 = -1.381. So pOH is 1.381, so pH is 14-1.381=12.619, approximately 12.62.

So the answer would be option A: 12.62.

Wait, but let me think again. What if the CH3COOH doesn't fully donate all its H+? Because it's a weak acid, maybe not all 0.05 mol of H+ is available to react with OH-.

But wait, OH- is a strong base. It will deprotonate the acetic acid. So even though acetic acid is weak, the OH- will take H+ from it because OH- is a stronger base. So all the H+ from CH3COOH would be neutralized by OH-.

So the calculation is correct. So the pH is 12.62. So the correct option is A.


To determine the pH of the solution, we analyze the mixing of three solutions: 500 mL of 0.1 M CH₃COOH (acetic acid), 400 mL of 0.2 M HCl (strong acid), and 300 mL of 0.3 M Ba(OH)₂ (strong base). The key steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - **H⁺ from HCl:**  
     Moles = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.4 \, \text{L} = 0.08 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂:**  
     Each mole of Ba(OH)₂ produces 2 moles of OH⁻.  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.09 \, \text{mol} \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).
   - **H⁺ from CH₃COOH:**  
     CH₃COOH is a weak acid, but in the presence of OH⁻, it will donate H⁺.  
     Moles of CH₃COOH = \( 0.1 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).  
     Since each CH₃COOH molecule can donate one H⁺, the total H⁺ available from CH₃COOH is \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Reaction between H⁺ and OH⁻:**
   - OH⁻ reacts with H⁺ from HCl first:  
     \( 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H⁺ (from HCl)} + 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH⁻} \to 0.08 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H₂O} \).  
     Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.18 - 0.08 = 0.10 \, \text{mol} \).
   - Remaining OH⁻ reacts with H⁺ from CH₃COOH:  
     \( 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H⁺ (from CH₃COOH)} + 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{OH⁻} \to 0.05 \, \text{mol} \, \text{H₂O} \).  
     Remaining OH⁻ = \( 0.10 - 0.05 = 0.05 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Calculate concentration of OH⁻:**
   - Total volume of the solution = \( 500 \, \text{mL} + 400 \, \text{mL} + 300 \, \text{mL} = 1200 \, \text{mL} = 1.2 \, \text{L} \).  
   - Concentration of OH⁻ = \( \frac{0.05 \, \text{mol}}{1.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.04167 \, \text{M} \).

4. **Calculate pH:**
   - \( \text{pOH} = -\log[OH⁻] = -\log(0.04167) \approx 1.38 \).  
   - \( \text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 1.38 = 12.62 \).

Thus, the pH of the solution is approximately **12.62**.

Answer: A
