Okay, so I've got this question about a molecular biology experiment, and I need to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up under the confocal microscope. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read through the question again to make sure I understand the setup. So, they've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, bicistronic means two genes in one vector, right? So the ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus.

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter. I remember that CBA is a strong promoter, maybe constitutive. And upstream of the receptor, there's an IRES element. IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, which is used for expressing the second gene in a bicistronic construct. So the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which probably drives its expression, and the receptor is under the control of the IRES, so it's expressed after the ligand.

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. And between the receptor and eGFP is a stop cassette with lox2272. LoxP sites are used in Cre-mediated recombination. So if Cre is present, it would remove the stop cassettes, allowing the downstream genes (mCherry and eGFP) to be expressed.

They tested the construct expression using Western blot with antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and used total proteins. The actin loading is proportional, so their controls are okay. But when they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background, they crossed them with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is involved in neural crest development, so the Cre here is probably to conditionally express the genes. After the offspring are born, they look for the fluorescent signals.

But in the confocal, there's no green signal. The green is from eGFP attached to the receptor. So why isn't eGFP showing up?

Let me look at the options.

Option A: ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But how does that affect the expression in the mouse? If the ligand is made by one cell and the receptor by another, then both would be expressed. But in our construct, both the ligand and receptor are under the same vector. However, the expression may be cell-type specific. But why wouldn't eGFP show up? The question is about the expression in the mice, so maybe the expression isn't happening because of something else.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP stuck in the Golgi. If the eGFP isn't trafficking properly, it wouldn't fluoresce. But why would it be stuck? Maybe the stop cassette isn't removed. Wait, the stop is between receptor and eGFP, with lox2272. So if Cre isn't active, the stop would prevent eGFP from being expressed. But in the mouse model, they have the SOX10-Cre, which is expressed in neural crest-derived cells. So in those cells, Cre should be active, leading to the removal of the stop cassette, allowing eGFP expression. But if the stop isn't removed, eGFP wouldn't be expressed, so no green. Alternatively, if the stop is correctly removed, but the eGFP isn't being properly trafficked, but the question says they did a Western blot and presumably saw eGFP expression, but they're looking at the mouse.

Wait, but in the question, after transfection into astrocytes, they used antibodies to test expression. So perhaps the construct works in culture, but not in the mouse? Or perhaps in the mouse, the Cre isn't active where the receptor is expressed, so the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Alternatively, maybe the vector isn't correctly set up. Let me think about how the vector works. The ligand is under CBA, then an IRES, then the receptor. The ligand has a stop with loxP, and the receptor has a stop with lox2272.

When Cre is introduced, it should excise the loxP and lox2272 sites. So in the presence of Cre, the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed (since the loxP-stop is removed), and the receptor and eGFP are co-expressed (lox2272-stop removed).

But in the mouse, they're using SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest cells. So the Cre would be expressed in those cells, leading to the removal of the stop cassettes. So in those cells, both ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

But the problem is that they don't see green. So eGFP isn't expressed. Why?

Another possibility is that the frame is messed up. If the stop is not correctly removed, the receptor would have a premature stop, leading to no functional protein. But the eGFP is at the C-terminus, so if the stop is in between, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.

Alternatively, the Cre may not have excised the lox2272 correctly, meaning the stop is still there. So the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP isn't. So when you look for eGFP, nothing shows up.

Wait, but the construct was made in a way that the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So for eGFP to be expressed, the stop needs to be removed. If Cre is active, it would remove the lox2272-stop, allowing the receptor and eGFP to be expressed together.

If the mice are homozygous for the construct, and crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre would recombine in the neural crest-derived cells. So in the offspring, in neural crest cells, the receptor and eGFP should be expressed.

But maybe the Western blot wasn't done on the mouse tissues. Because the Western blot was done after transfection into astrocytes, which may express the Cre, but the mouse might not be expressing Cre in the right cells.

Wait, in the mouse, the SOX10-Cre is hemizygous. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells. So when the offspring are born, Cre is active in neural crest-derived cells. So in those cells, the lox2272 should be excised, so the eGFP should be expressed.

But why isn't it showing up? Another possibility is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't being excised. But why?

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is constitutive. The receptor is under the IRES, so it's expressed as a separate ORF. But perhaps the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't being expressed. But in that case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed either.

Alternatively, perhaps the vectors aren't being correctly translated. Let's think about the vector structure.

The vector is ligand (CBA promoter) followed by an IRES, then the receptor. So the ligand is expressed from the CBA promoter, and the receptor is expressed via the IRES, which allows for internal initiation. But the receptors' expression is dependent on the IRES. If the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor might not be expressed. But then why would the eGFP not show up? Because the eGFP is downstream of the receptor, separated by a lox2272 stop.

Wait, but if the IRES isn't working, the receptor isn't expressed, so the eGFP isn't either. But in the Western blot, they used primary astrocytes. So if the vector is transfected into astrocytes, which don't have Cre, then the stops are in place. So the ligand and mCherry would be under the CBA promoter, but with a stop before mCherry, unless the stop is between ligand and mCherry. Oh wait, the ligand and mCherry are fused? Or are they separate?

Wait, the question says: the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. Hmm, so ligand-mCherry is a fusion protein? Or is mCherry downstream, but separated by a stop? Wait, the ligand ORF is at 5' and fused to mCherry. So ligand is first, then mCherry, but perhaps under the same promoter. No, wait, the vector is bicistronic, so each ORF has its own promoter? Or is it that the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor under IRES.

Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter. So the first ORF is ligand, followed by mCherry, but how? Because after ligand, there's a stop with loxP. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't, because the stop is in place. When Cre is present, it removes the stop, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed as separate proteins or as a fusion? Wait, the way it's written: ligand ORF is at 5' position, fused to mCherry. So perhaps it's a fusion, meaning ligand-mCherry. But the stop is between ligand ORF and mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand would be expressed, but mCherry would not. With Cre, the stop is removed, so the fusion would be expressed.

Wait, perhaps the mCherry is a separate ORF after the ligand, but the stop is in between. So without Cre, ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. With Cre, the stop is removed, so both are expressed. Similarly for the receptor and eGFP.

But in the mouse, the Cre is present (SOX10-Cre), which should remove the stops. So in the cells where Cre is active, both ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

In the confocal, they're looking for green (eGFP). No green, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But why? Let me think about the vector. The ligand ORF is first, then a stop cassette, then the receptor ORF, then a stop cassette before eGFP.

Wait, the vector is ligand (CBA promoter) followed by IRES, then receptor (which is under IRES?), then the eGFP with a stop before it.

Wait, the question says the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES. So perhaps the ligand is under CBA, then there's an IRES, then the receptor. The IRES allows the ribosome to initiate translation of the receptor.

So the vector is: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop cassette with loxP -> mCherry. Then, after the IRES, the receptor ORF -> stop cassette with lox2272 -> eGFP.

Wait, no. The setup is a bicistronic vector, meaning two ORFs. The ligand is at 5', under CBA promoter, and the receptor is at 3', under IRES.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CBA promoter --> ligand ORF --> stop cassette (loxP) --> mCherry

IRES --> receptor ORF --> stop cassette (lox2272) --> eGFP

So the ligand and mCherry are in the same transcriptional unit, but separated by a stop cassette. The receptor and eGFP are in another unit, but under the IRES.

But in this case, the IRES would allow the receptor to be translated from the same mRNA as the ligand? Or is it a separate transcript? I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed to have two separate transcripts. So the first is ligand under CBA, and the second is receptor under IRES. But that doesn't align with the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is a single transcript, with ligand under CBA, followed by IRES, then the receptor and eGFP.

Wait, perhaps the bicistronic vector is set up so that ligand is under CBA, then an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) for the receptor-eGFP. So the same mRNA would produce both the ligand (and mCherry if the stop is removed) and the receptor-eGFP.

Wait, but in the question, the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. Or are they separate? The question says ligand ORF is at 5' fused to mCherry, and receptor ORF is at 3' fused to eGFP.

Hmm. So perhaps the construct is:

ligand-mCherry under CBA promoter, followed by IRES, then receptor-eGFP.

But the ligand-mCherry is under CBA, and the IRES allows for the receptor-eGFP to be expressed from the same mRNA. So the two proteins are co-expressed.

But then, the stops are between the ligand and mCherry, and between receptor and eGFP. So without Cre, the stops are in place, so the ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. Receptor is expressed via IRES, but eGFP isn't.

Wait, but the way the question is written, the ligand is at 5' and fused to mCherry. So perhaps it's a fusion protein: ligand-mCherry. Similarly, receptor-eGFP.

In that case, the stop cassettes would prevent the fusion partners from being expressed. So without Cre, ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. Receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

When Cre is present, it removes the stops, allowing the mCherry and eGFP to be expressed as fusion partners.

So in the mouse model, the Cre is active in neural crest cells, so in those cells, the stops are removed. So ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

But the confocal doesn't show green. So eGFP isn't expressed.

Now, why? Let's consider the options.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop isn't correctly removed, the reading frame would be disrupted, leading to a frameshift. But the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So the eGFP would only be expressed if the stop is removed and the frame is correct.

Wait, but the stop is a stop codon. If the stop is present, translation stops, so eGFP isn't made. If the stop is removed, then translation continues, but only if the frame is correct. If the frame is wrong, the eGFP might not be correctly expressed.

But the question says the ligand and receptor are initially expressed in neural crest cells, so presumably the construct is designed correctly. However, in the vector, the ORF for eGFP could be in the same frame or not.

Wait, the vector has a stop between receptor and eGFP. So without Cre, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. With Cre, the stop is removed, and the eGFP is expressed. But if the lox2272 is correctly recombined, the reading frame of the eGFP would be in frame with the receptor?

No, wait, the eGFP is after the stop. So the receptor would be in a certain frame, and the eGFP starts after the stop. So if the stop is removed, the eGFP would be in frame only if the stop's removal doesn't change the reading frame. So perhaps the vector is designed so that after the stop is removed, the eGFP is in the same frame as the receptor. Otherwise, you'd get a frameshift.

But if the lox2272 isn't recombined correctly, the stop remains, and the eGFP isn't expressed. So in the mouse model, if the Cre isn't active, the stops remain. But the mouse is homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre, so in the neural crest cells, Cre should be active.

Wait, but if the vector uses lox2272 sites, which are different from loxP. Cre can recognize lox2272 sites as well, but perhaps it's a different strain? No, the same Cre should work for both.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct wasn't properly recombined because of the lox2272 site. Maybe the lox2272 isn't being recognized by the Cre used, or perhaps the orientation is wrong.

But the question says the vector has lox-Cre, so presumably the Cre is active.

Another angle: when they made the mouse model, the construct is inserted into the genome. But perhaps the construct isn't correctly inserted in the right orientation, so the Cre isn't working. But that's probably not the case as the question says they're homozygous for the construct.

Wait, another thought: the expression of the receptor-eGFP requires both the IRES and the removal of the stop cassette. So without the stop removal, even if the IRES is active, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is in place.

But in the mouse model, the Cre is active in the neural crest cells, so the stop is removed. So the eGFP should be expressed.

But perhaps the IRES isn't working. So the receptor isn't being expressed, hence eGFP isn't either.

But if the IRES isn't working, the ligand would still be expressed under the CBA promoter. But in the Western blot, they saw expression of the proteins, so perhaps the CBA promoter is working, but the IRES isn't. So when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes, which don't have Cre, the ligand is expressed (so mCherry isn't), and the receptor isn't expressed (so eGFP isn't). But when they use Cre, in the mouse, the ligand and mCherry are expressed, and the receptor and eGFP would only be expressed if the IRES is working. But if the IRES isn't working, then the receptor and eGFP would not be expressed. So in the mouse, the ligand would be expressed, but the receptor and eGFP wouldn't. Hence, in the confocal, only red (mCherry) would be seen, but they don't mention that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the green signal, which is for the receptor-eGFP.

Wait, what's the eGFP attached to? The receptor. So the eGFP is a fusion with the receptor. So if the receptor isn't expressed, eGFP isn't either. But why wouldn't the receptor be expressed? Because the IRES isn't working.

But the question states that the ligand and receptor are initially expressed in neural crest cells. So the construct should be designed to express both in that cell type.

Hmm. So the other option is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't removed. So the lox2272 isn't being recombined by Cre.

But why? Maybe the lox2272 cassette isn't functioning with the Cre used. Wait, lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site, which is recognized by Cre. So the presence of lox2272 shouldn't matter; Cre should still excise it.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector isn't correctly designed. For instance, the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP, so without Cre, the receptor is expressed without eGFP. With Cre, the stop is removed, so both are expressed. But perhaps in the vector, the eGFP is in the same frame as the receptor. If the eGFP is out of frame, then the receptor might not be expressed properly, or the eGFP might be truncated.

Wait, but the stop codon is in the way. So without the stop being removed, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. So in the mouse model, the Cre should remove the stop, allowing the eGFP to be expressed.

But the question says that after the offspring are born, they're visualized under confocal. No green. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, the construct is a bicistronic vector. So maybe in the mouse, the Cre is not active, but that's unlikely since the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest.

Alternatively, maybe the vector isn't being expressed because the enhancer is missing. Option C says the enhancer is missing. So if the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing, neither would be expressed. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, so that might not be the issue. Unless the promoter isn't active in the cells they're looking at.

But they're looking in neural crest-derived cells, which should express the Cre and the receptors.

Hmm. Another possibility: in the vector, the eGFP is not in frame, so even if the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't correctly expressed. So the ORF would be disrupted.

Wait, the vector has the receptor ORF followed by a stop, then eGFP. So if the stop is between them, and the stop is removed, the eGFP is in frame with the receptor? Or is it a separate ORF?

Wait, in the vector, the receptor and eGFP are in the same ORF? No, probably not. The vector is set up so that the receptor is expressed as a separate protein, and eGFP is a separate fusion. So, for eGFP to be expressed, the stop between receptor and eGFP must be removed, allowing the eGFP to be expressed as a separate protein, but perhaps in the same frame. So if the stop is in the middle of the receptor's coding sequence, removing it could cause a frameshift, making the eGFP not in frame.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me think. Let's say the receptor ORF ends, then a stop codon, then eGFP. When the stop is removed, the eGFP is now in the same reading frame as the receptor. But the receptor's sequence may not be compatible with the eGFP's frame. So when the stop is removed, the receptor's reading frame continues, and then eGFP starts, but perhaps it's a different frame. So eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly.

But this would only be an issue if the stop is in the same frame as the receptor. Wait, the stop codon is usually in a specific frame. So if the stop is in the same frame as the receptor's ORF, then removing it would cause the receptor's ORF to continue into the eGFP, which is in a different frame, leading to a frameshift. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly.

In that case, even though the stop is removed, the eGFP would not be properly expressed. So no green signal.

In the question, the vector has a stop in a lox2272 cassette between the receptor and eGFP. So when Cre removes the stop, the eGFP is expressed, but only if it's in frame.

If the stop was in frame, and Cre removes it, the reading frame would shift. So the eGFP wouldn't be in frame, so it wouldn't be expressed. Hence, no green.

So the issue is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the same frame, causing the eGFP not to be expressed.

Looking back at the options, option D is: the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.

Yes, that would explain why the eGFP isn't showing up. Because the removal of the stop caused a frameshift, so the eGFP isn't correctly expressed.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand fused to mCherry and a receptor fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. The construct includes stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 sites, which are designed to be removed by Cre to allow co-expression of the fused proteins (ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP). The experiment involves transfecting the construct into primary astrocytes and testing expression via Western blot, followed by generating a mouse model homozygous for the construct and crossing it with SOX10-Cre mice. Despite these steps, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the construct is designed to co-express the ligand and receptor within the same cells, particularly neural crest-derived cells where SOX10-Cre is active. A paracrine relationship does not explain why eGFP is not expressed.  

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were trafficking improperly, it would likely still be detectable via Western blot, even if not fluorescent. The question does not provide evidence of improper trafficking, and the lack of fluorescence is more likely due to a failure in expression rather than trafficking.  

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is constitutive and strong. While the receptor relies on the IRES element, there is no indication that an enhancer is missing or non-functional. The lack of fluorescence is more likely due to issues with the construct design or recombination rather than promoter/enhancer activity.  

4. **Option D: The receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame**  
   This is the most plausible explanation. The vector design includes a stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP. If the stop is removed by Cre but the eGFP is not in the same reading frame as the receptor, a frameshift occurs, disrupting eGFP expression. This would result in the receptor being expressed but not fused to eGFP, leading to the absence of the green signal under confocal microscopy.

### Conclusion:
The absence of the green signal is best explained by the receptor and eGFP not being in the same reading frame after the stop cassette is removed by Cre. This frameshift prevents proper eGFP expression, resulting in no fluorescence.

Okay, so I've got this question about a molecular biology experiment, and I need to figure out why the green signal isn't showing up under the confocal microscope. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read through the question again to make sure I understand the setup. So, they've created a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Hmm, bicistronic means two genes in one vector, right? So the ligand ORF is at the 5' end, fused to mCherry, and the receptor is at the 3' end with eGFP at the C-terminus.

IRES allows for internal ribosome entry, which is used for expressing the second gene in a bicistronic construct. So the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which probably drives its expression, and the receptor is under the control of the IRES, so it's expressed after the ligand.

Between the ligand ORF and mCherry, there's a stop cassette with loxP. And between the receptor and eGFP is a stop cassette with lox2272. LoxP sites are used in Cre-mediated recombination. So if Cre is present, it would remove the stop cassettes, allowing the downstream genes (mCherry and eGFP) to be expressed.

They tested the construct expression using Western blot with antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and used total proteins. The actin loading is proportional, so their controls are okay. But when they made a mouse model homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background, they crossed them with SOX10-Cre mice. SOX10 is involved in neural crest development, so the Cre here is probably to conditionally express the genes. After the offspring are born, they look for the fluorescent signals.

But in the mouse model, they have the SOX10-Cre, which is expressed in neural crest-derived cells.

But maybe the Western blot wasn't done on the mouse tissues. Because the Western blot was done after transfection into astrocytes, which may express the Cre, but the mouse might not be expressing Cre in the right cells.

Wait, in the mouse, the SOX10-Cre is hemizygous. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells. So when the offspring are born, Cre is active in neural crest-derived cells. So in those cells, the lox2272 should be excised, so the eGFP should be expressed.

But why isn't it showing up? Another possibility is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't being excised. But why?

Wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is constitutive. The receptor is under the IRES, so it's expressed as a separate ORF. But perhaps the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't being expressed. But in that case, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed either.

So the ligand and mCherry would be under the CBA promoter, but with a stop before mCherry, unless the stop is between ligand and mCherry. Oh wait, the ligand and mCherry are fused? Or are they separate?

Wait, the question says: the ligand ORF is at the 5' position, fused to mCherry. Hmm, so ligand-mCherry is a fusion protein? Or is mCherry downstream, but separated by a stop? Wait, the ligand ORF is at 5' and fused to mCherry. So ligand is first, then mCherry, but perhaps under the same promoter. No, wait, the vector is bicistronic, so each ORF has its own promoter? Or is it that the ligand is under CBA, and the receptor under IRES.

Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter. So the first ORF is ligand, followed by mCherry, but how? Because after ligand, there's a stop with loxP. So in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't, because the stop is in place. When Cre is present, it removes the stop, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed as separate proteins or as a fusion? Wait, the way it's written: ligand ORF is at 5' position, fused to mCherry. So perhaps it's a fusion, meaning ligand-mCherry. But the stop is between ligand ORF and mCherry. So without Cre, the ligand would be expressed, but mCherry would not. With Cre, the stop is removed, so the fusion would be expressed.

Wait, perhaps the mCherry is a separate ORF after the ligand, but the stop is in between. So without Cre, ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. With Cre, the stop is removed, so both are expressed. Similarly for the receptor and eGFP.

But in the mouse, the Cre is present (SOX10-Cre), which should remove the stops. So in the cells where Cre is active, both ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

In the confocal, they're looking for green (eGFP). No green, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But why? Let me think about the vector. The ligand ORF is first, then a stop cassette, then the receptor ORF, then a stop cassette before eGFP.

Wait, the vector is ligand (CBA promoter) followed by IRES, then receptor (which is under IRES?), then the eGFP with a stop before it.

Wait, the question says the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES. So perhaps the ligand is under CBA, then there's an IRES, then the receptor. The IRES allows the ribosome to initiate translation of the receptor.

So the vector is: CBA promoter -> ligand ORF -> stop cassette with loxP -> mCherry. Then, after the IRES, the receptor ORF -> stop cassette with lox2272 -> eGFP.

Wait, no. The setup is a bicistronic vector, meaning two ORFs. The ligand is at 5', under CBA promoter, and the receptor is at 3', under IRES.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CBA promoter --> ligand ORF --> stop cassette (loxP) --> mCherry

IRES --> receptor ORF --> stop cassette (lox2272) --> eGFP

So the ligand and mCherry are in the same transcriptional unit, but separated by a stop cassette. The receptor and eGFP are in another unit, but under the IRES.

But in this case, the IRES would allow the receptor to be translated from the same mRNA as the ligand? Or is it a separate transcript? I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed to have two separate transcripts. So the first is ligand under CBA, and the second is receptor under IRES. But that doesn't align with the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is a single transcript, with ligand under CBA, followed by IRES, then the receptor and eGFP.

Wait, perhaps the bicistronic vector is set up so that ligand is under CBA, then an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) for the receptor-eGFP. So the same mRNA would produce both the ligand (and mCherry if the stop is removed) and the receptor-eGFP.

Wait, but in the question, the ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. Or are they separate? The question says ligand ORF is at 5' fused to mCherry, and receptor ORF is at 3' fused to eGFP.

Hmm. So perhaps the construct is:

ligand-mCherry under CBA promoter, followed by IRES, then receptor-eGFP.

But the ligand-mCherry is under CBA, and the IRES allows for the receptor-eGFP to be expressed from the same mRNA. So the two proteins are co-expressed.

But then, the stops are between the ligand and mCherry, and between receptor and eGFP. So without Cre, the stops are in place, so the ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. Receptor is expressed via IRES, but eGFP isn't.

Wait, but the way the question is written, the ligand is at 5' and fused to mCherry. So perhaps it's a fusion protein: ligand-mCherry. Similarly, receptor-eGFP.

In that case, the stop cassettes would prevent the fusion partners from being expressed. So without Cre, ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. Receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't.

When Cre is present, it removes the stops, allowing the mCherry and eGFP to be expressed as fusion partners.

So in the mouse model, the Cre is active in neural crest cells, so in those cells, the stops are removed. So ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

But the confocal doesn't show green. So eGFP isn't expressed.

Now, why? Let's consider the options.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop isn't correctly removed, the reading frame would be disrupted, leading to a frameshift. But the stop is between the receptor and eGFP. So the eGFP would only be expressed if the stop is removed and the frame is correct.

Wait, but the stop is a stop codon. If the stop is present, translation stops, so eGFP isn't made. If the stop is removed, then translation continues, but only if the frame is correct. If the frame is wrong, the eGFP might not be correctly expressed.

But the question says the ligand and receptor are initially expressed in neural crest cells, so presumably the construct is designed correctly. However, in the vector, the ORF for eGFP could be in the same frame or not.

Wait, the vector has a stop between receptor and eGFP. So without Cre, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. With Cre, the stop is removed, and the eGFP is expressed. But if the lox2272 is correctly recombined, the reading frame of the eGFP would be in frame with the receptor?

No, wait, the eGFP is after the stop. So the receptor would be in a certain frame, and the eGFP starts after the stop. So if the stop is removed, the eGFP would be in frame only if the stop's removal doesn't change the reading frame. So perhaps the vector is designed so that after the stop is removed, the eGFP is in the same frame as the receptor. Otherwise, you'd get a frameshift.

But if the lox2272 isn't recombined correctly, the stop remains, and the eGFP isn't expressed. So in the mouse model, if the Cre isn't active, the stops remain. But the mouse is homozygous for the construct and crossed with SOX10-Cre, so in the neural crest cells, Cre should be active.

Wait, but if the vector uses lox2272 sites, which are different from loxP. Cre can recognize lox2272 sites as well, but perhaps it's a different strain? No, the same Cre should work for both.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct wasn't properly recombined because of the lox2272 site. Maybe the lox2272 isn't being recognized by the Cre used, or perhaps the orientation is wrong.

But the question says the vector has lox-Cre, so presumably the Cre is active.

Another angle: when they made the mouse model, the construct is inserted into the genome. But perhaps the construct isn't correctly inserted in the right orientation, so the Cre isn't working. But that's probably not the case as the question says they're homozygous for the construct.

Wait, another thought: the expression of the receptor-eGFP requires both the IRES and the removal of the stop cassette. So without the stop removal, even if the IRES is active, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is in place.

But in the mouse model, the Cre is active in the neural crest cells, so the stop is removed. So the eGFP should be expressed.

But perhaps the IRES isn't working. So the receptor isn't being expressed, hence eGFP isn't either.

But if the IRES isn't working, the ligand would still be expressed under the CBA promoter. But in the Western blot, they saw expression of the proteins, so perhaps the CBA promoter is working, but the IRES isn't. So when they transfected the plasmid into astrocytes, which don't have Cre, the ligand is expressed (so mCherry isn't), and the receptor isn't expressed (so eGFP isn't). But when they use Cre, in the mouse, the ligand and mCherry are expressed, and the receptor and eGFP would only be expressed if the IRES is working. But if the IRES isn't working, then the receptor and eGFP would not be expressed. So in the mouse, the ligand would be expressed, but the receptor and eGFP wouldn't. Hence, in the confocal, only red (mCherry) would be seen, but they don't mention that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the green signal, which is for the receptor-eGFP.

Wait, what's the eGFP attached to? The receptor. So the eGFP is a fusion with the receptor. So if the receptor isn't expressed, eGFP isn't either. But why wouldn't the receptor be expressed? Because the IRES isn't working.

But the question states that the ligand and receptor are initially expressed in neural crest cells. So the construct should be designed to express both in that cell type.

Hmm. So the other option is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop isn't removed. So the lox2272 isn't being recombined by Cre.

But why? Maybe the lox2272 cassette isn't functioning with the Cre used. Wait, lox2272 is a variant of the loxP site, which is recognized by Cre. So the presence of lox2272 shouldn't matter; Cre should still excise it.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector isn't correctly designed. For instance, the stop cassette is between the receptor and eGFP, so without Cre, the receptor is expressed without eGFP. With Cre, the stop is removed, so both are expressed. But perhaps in the vector, the eGFP is in the same frame as the receptor. If the eGFP is out of frame, then the receptor might not be expressed properly, or the eGFP might be truncated.

Wait, but the stop codon is in the way. So without the stop being removed, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP isn't. So in the mouse model, the Cre should remove the stop, allowing the eGFP to be expressed.

But the question says that after the offspring are born, they're visualized under confocal. No green. So the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, the construct is a bicistronic vector. So maybe in the mouse, the Cre is not active, but that's unlikely since the mice are crossed with SOX10-Cre, which is active in neural crest.

Alternatively, maybe the vector isn't being expressed because the enhancer is missing. Option C says the enhancer is missing. So if the enhancer for the ligand and receptor is missing, neither would be expressed. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter, so that might not be the issue. Unless the promoter isn't active in the cells they're looking at.

But they're looking in neural crest-derived cells, which should express the Cre and the receptors.

Hmm. Another possibility: in the vector, the eGFP is not in frame, so even if the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't correctly expressed. So the ORF would be disrupted.

Wait, the vector has the receptor ORF followed by a stop, then eGFP. So if the stop is between them, and the stop is removed, the eGFP is in frame with the receptor? Or is it a separate ORF?

Wait, in the vector, the receptor and eGFP are in the same ORF? No, probably not. The vector is set up so that the receptor is expressed as a separate protein, and eGFP is a separate fusion. So, for eGFP to be expressed, the stop between receptor and eGFP must be removed, allowing the eGFP to be expressed as a separate protein, but perhaps in the same frame. So if the stop is in the middle of the receptor's coding sequence, removing it could cause a frameshift, making the eGFP not in frame.

Wait, that's a possibility. Let me think. Let's say the receptor ORF ends, then a stop codon, then eGFP. When the stop is removed, the eGFP is now in the same reading frame as the receptor. But the receptor's sequence may not be compatible with the eGFP's frame. So when the stop is removed, the receptor's reading frame continues, and then eGFP starts, but perhaps it's a different frame. So eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly.

But this would only be an issue if the stop is in the same frame as the receptor. Wait, the stop codon is usually in a specific frame. So if the stop is in the same frame as the receptor's ORF, then removing it would cause the receptor's ORF to continue into the eGFP, which is in a different frame, leading to a frameshift. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed correctly.

In that case, even though the stop is removed, the eGFP would not be properly expressed. So no green signal.

In the question, the vector has a stop in a lox2272 cassette between the receptor and eGFP. So when Cre removes the stop, the eGFP is expressed, but only if it's in frame.

If the stop was in frame, and Cre removes it, the reading frame would shift. So the eGFP wouldn't be in frame, so it wouldn't be expressed. Hence, no green.

So the issue is that the receptor and eGFP are not in the same frame, causing the eGFP not to be expressed.

Looking back at the options, option D is: the receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame.

Yes, that would explain why the eGFP isn't showing up. Because the removal of the stop caused a frameshift, so the eGFP isn't correctly expressed.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand fused to mCherry and a receptor fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. The construct includes stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 sites, which are designed to be removed by Cre to allow co-expression of the fused proteins (ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP). The experiment involves transfecting the construct into primary astrocytes and testing expression via Western blot, followed by generating a mouse model homozygous for the construct and crossing it with SOX10-Cre mice. Despite these steps, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on different cells. However, the construct is designed to co-express the ligand and receptor within the same cells, particularly neural crest-derived cells where SOX10-Cre is active. A paracrine relationship does not explain why eGFP is not expressed.  

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were trafficking improperly, it would likely still be detectable via Western blot, even if not fluorescent. The question does not provide evidence of improper trafficking, and the lack of fluorescence is more likely due to a failure in expression rather than trafficking.  

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is constitutive and strong. While the receptor relies on the IRES element, there is no indication that an enhancer is missing or non-functional. The lack of fluorescence is more likely due to issues with the construct design or recombination rather than promoter/enhancer activity.  

4. **Option D: The receptor and the eGFP are not in the frame**  
   This is the most plausible explanation. The vector design includes a stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP. If the stop is removed by Cre but the eGFP is not in the same reading frame as the receptor, a frameshift occurs, disrupting eGFP expression. This would result in the receptor being expressed but not fused to eGFP, leading to the absence of the green signal under confocal microscopy.

### Conclusion:
The absence of the green signal is best explained by the receptor and eGFP not being in the same reading frame after the stop cassette is removed by Cre. This frameshift prevents proper eGFP expression, resulting in no fluorescence.
