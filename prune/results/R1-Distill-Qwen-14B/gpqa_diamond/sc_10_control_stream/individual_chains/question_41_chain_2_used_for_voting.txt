Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says that a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Wait, so the glass is moving towards the observer. That means the glass is moving in the direction the light is going, but wait, no, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. Oh, wait the beam is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving towards the observer. So the glass is moving in the direction opposite to the beam's direction because the observer is in front. Wait, no, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass. So if the glass is moving towards the observer, the beam is moving towards the observer as well. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of reference frames. The glass is a medium through which light is traveling. The glass is moving with velocity v relative to the lab frame. So I need to find the speed of light in the glass as measured in the lab frame.

Wait, the speed of light in the glass when the glass is stationary is c/n, right? Because in a medium with refractive index n, the speed is c divided by n. So when the medium is moving, does that affect the speed of light observed in the lab?

I remember something about relativity and how velocities add. But wait, this is about a medium moving through which light is passing. How does that affect the speed?

Wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, that's when you have two inertial frames moving relative to each other. So if the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n, then in the lab frame, what is the speed?

But wait, the glass is a medium, not an inertial frame. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Because the glass is moving, but the light is inside it, so perhaps the speed of light in the lab frame would be affected by the movement of the glass.

Wait, another approach: The speed of light in the glass is c/n. But since the glass is moving, maybe we can use the Galilean velocity addition. But wait, Galilean addition is only valid at non-relativistic speeds. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can proceed with that.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, but that's in a vacuum. But here, it's in a medium. So I'm not sure. Oh wait, wait, the problem is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. So perhaps it's not the speed of the photons, but the speed as observed in the lab frame.

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium is c/n, but that's from the medium's rest frame. So if the medium is moving, how does that change the observed speed?

Wait, maybe it's like this: in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. In the glass frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n relative to the glass. So to find the speed in the lab frame, we add the velocities. But how?

In Galilean terms, the lab would see the light moving at (v_light + v_glass). But wait, that would be (c/n + v). But that can't be right because if v is significant compared to c, that would exceed c, which is impossible.

Alternatively, using special relativity's velocity addition formula. So the formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c² ), where u is the velocity of the object in the source frame, and v is the relative velocity between the frames. So in this case, u = c/n, and the frame is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. Wait, but I need to make sure about the directions.

Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer. So if the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving towards him, then the direction of v is towards the observer. The light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass, so in the lab frame, the light is moving towards the observer as well.

Wait, no, the glass is moving toward the observer, so the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n towards the observer. So let's say the glass is moving in the +x direction. Wait, no, because in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer. So if the observer is at rest in the lab, and the glass is moving towards him, then the glass's velocity v is in the direction opposite to the beam's motion? Wait, I'm getting confused about the directions.

Wait, maybe I should define the direction. Let's say the light beam is moving towards the observer. The glass is also moving towards the observer, so the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving towards the observer at speed c/n. So in the lab frame, which sees the glass moving at v towards the observer, what is the speed of the light?

Hmm, so I think we can model this using the velocity addition formula. Let me think: in the glass frame (S'), the light's velocity is u' = c/n towards the observer. The lab frame (S) is moving at velocity v relative to S'—wait, wait, no. If S is the lab, and the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light, then the glass's frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. So using the velocity addition formula to find the speed of the light in S.

Wait, the velocity addition formula is:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

In this case, u' is the speed of light in the glass frame, which is c/n. So u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)). So,

u = ( (c + n v ) / n ) / (1 + v/(n c) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c:

Numerator becomes (c + n v) * c
Denominator becomes n c + v

So,

u = [c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

But wait, the speed of light is supposed to be c in all frames, but here, it's in a medium. Hmm, but perhaps the problem is not considering this.

Wait, but the problem says, "the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory." So perhaps the speed is considered as (c/n) plus the velocity of the glass, but that's in the non-relativistic case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the velocity.

Wait, when the glass is moving towards the observer (same direction as the light), then the light's speed in the lab frame would be (c/n) + v. But that can't be correct because if v is significant, it would exceed c, which isn't possible according to relativity.

So perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic velocity addition.

So in the glass frame S', the light's speed is u' = c/n towards the observer. The lab frame S sees the glass moving at velocity v towards the observer, so the lab's frame is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass's frame. So in S, what is the speed u?

Using the velocity addition formula:

u = (u' + v_glass) / (1 + (u' * v_glass)/c² )

Wait, no. The velocity addition formula is when you have an object moving at u' in S', and S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. Then u is the velocity in S.

So in this case, u' is the speed of light in S' (which is the glass frame) moving towards the observer. The glass is moving towards the observer at v in S. So wait, the S' frame is moving at v relative to S. So the formula is:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

So substituting u' = c/n,

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator:

1 + (v) / (n c )

So,

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Which is,

u = [ (c + n v) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n's cancel,

u = (c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Hmm, but that seems complicated. Let me see. Let's factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, the numerator is c (c + n v), denominator is (n c + v). Hmm, so the expression simplifies to [c(c +n v)] / (n c + v).

Wait, maybe we can factor out c from the denominator:

Denominator: c (n + v/(c) )

So numerator: c (c +n v ) = c^2 + c n v.

Denominator: c (n + v/(c) ) = c n + v.

Wait, perhaps the terms can be rearranged.

Wait, perhaps factor c in the denominator:

Denominator: c (n + v/(c) ) = c n + v. Hmm, same as before.

Wait, maybe I can write the numerator as c (n v + c) = c (c +n v).

So,

u = [c (c +n v)] / [c n + v ]

Hmm, does that match any of the options?

Looking at the options:

Option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v )

But wait, let's see, if I factor c^2 in numerator and denominator.

Wait, the numerator is c (c +n v) = c^2 + c n v.

The denominator is (n c + v ) = n c + v.

If I divide numerator and denominator by c,

Numerator becomes c + n v,

Denominator becomes n + v / c.

Wait, but that gives u = [c + n v ] / [n + v / c ].

Hmm, but that's not matching any options. Let me look again at the options.

Option B is 1, which can't be right because the speed depends on v and n.

Option C is (1 +n v)/(n -v )

Wait, not matching.

Option D: (1 -n v)/(n +v )

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the velocity addition formula. Let me re-examine.

Wait, in the glass's frame S', the light is moving towards the observer at u' = c/n. The glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v in the lab frame S. So S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. So the velocity addition formula is:

u = (u' + v ) / [1 + (u' v ) / c² ]

So substituting u' = c/n,

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator:

1 + (v) / (n c )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c:

Numerator: (c + n v) * c

Denominator: n c + v

So,

u = [c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

But this is what I had before. Let me see if this can be rewritten as (1 + (n v)/(c)) ) / (n + v/c ), but that doesn't help directly.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is non-relativistic, so v is much less than c. Then, the expression would approximate to (c/n + v ), but that would be option A if I factor out c.

Wait, let me see option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v )

Wait, if I take my expression [c (c +n v)] / (n c + v ), and divide numerator and denominator by c,

I get (c + n v) / (n + v/c )

In the non-relativistic limit where v << c, v/c is negligible. So denominator approximates to n.

So numerator approximates to c (1 + n v / c )

Wait, but wait, if I take the expression in the non-relativistic case:

u ≈ (c/n + v )

Which would be c/n + v. But none of the options look like that. Hmm.

Wait, looking at option B: 1, which would be c if v is zero. But wait, the speed in the glass is c/n, which is less than c. So option B, which is 1, would only be correct if n=1 and v=0.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Alternative approach: The speed of light in the medium (glass) is always c/n, regardless of the motion of the medium. Wait, but that's only in the rest frame of the medium. From an external frame, the speed would be different. Because in the external frame, the medium is moving.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light is c in vacuum, but in a medium, it's c/n. But the medium's motion affects the observed speed of light.

Wait, maybe using the Doppler effect approach. Hmm, but Doppler effect deals with frequency and wavelength shifts, not the speed.

Alternatively, think about how the speed is measured. If the glass is moving, the light may appear to move at a different speed.

Wait, maybe another approach: the observer in the lab sees the glass moving at velocity v. The light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So the speed of light relative to the lab would be c/n plus v, but that again could exceed c, which isn't possible.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But that's in a vacuum. Here, it's in a medium, so perhaps the speed can be more than c/n but not more than c.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's look at the answer options again.

Option B is 1, meaning c. So if the glass is moving, could the light's speed be c in the lab frame? That would happen if the glass's motion somehow compensates for the medium's refractive index. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is trying to test the understanding that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, regardless of the medium's motion. But that can't be right, because the medium's motion would affect the observed speed.

Wait, another thought: in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. Inside the glass, the speed of light is c/n. So the speed of light in the lab frame would be c/n plus v, but that's the Galilean addition which isn't correct for high speeds.

Wait, but according to relativity, the speed of light can't exceed c. So perhaps the correct approach is that the speed of light in the lab frame is still c.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the medium is moving. Or does it?

Wait, no, the speed of light in a medium is not affected by the motion of the medium. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because the medium's motion can influence the light's speed as observed in another frame.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think of it another way. Let's imagine that the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. The light's speed in the glass is c/n. So from the lab frame, the speed would be (c/n) + v, but this can't be right because if v is close to c, and n is small, the sum could exceed c.

But according to relativity, the speed can't exceed c. So perhaps that approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to treat the glass as a medium, so the speed of light inside it is c/n. But since the glass is moving, the observer in the lab would measure the speed as (c/n) plus v, but only if the velocity addition is Galilean. But that's only accurate for low speeds.

But the problem doesn't specify that v is small, so using Galilean addition may not be correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (c/n + v)/(1 + (c v)/(n c^2 )), but that doesn't help because it's not matching any options.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem is considering that the light's speed in the lab frame is c/n, regardless of the glass's motion. But that would ignore the motion of the medium.

Hmm, but that would mean the answer is (1/n), but none of the options is 1/n. So perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is 1. So that's c. Could the answer be B?

Wait, but only if the glass's motion somehow makes the light's speed equal to c. That would require that (c/n) = c - v, but that depends on v and n, which isn't necessarily the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the speed of light in the glass is always c/n, regardless of the glass's motion. But that's not correct according to relativity, as the speed of light is only c in a vacuum. In a medium, the speed is c/n, but from the lab frame, which is seeing the medium move, perhaps the speed is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it in terms of the observer in the lab. The glass is moving towards them at v. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the speed of the light in the lab frame would be (c/n) + v, but considering relativistic effects.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light can't be more than c. So perhaps the correct approach is that the speed of light in the lab frame is c, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's frame. If the medium is moving, the observed speed in the lab would be c/n plus v, but only for non-relativistic speeds. But the problem doesn't specify that v is small.

Wait, but none of the options directly match (c/n + v). Let me look at the options again.

Option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Hmm. Let me compute this:

(1 + n v)/(n +v ) = [1 + n v]/(n + v )

If I factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 1 + n v = n v +1.

Denominator: n + v.

Hmm, perhaps if I factor out n from denominator:

(n + v) = n (1 + v/(n) )

So,

[1 + n v]/[n(1 + v/n ) ] = (1 +n v)/(n (1 + v/n )) )

= [ (1 +n v) ] / [n + v ]

Hmm, that doesn't seem to help.

Wait, but let me compute the expression I got before from the velocity addition formula:

u = [c (c +n v) ] / (n c + v )

If I divide numerator and denominator by c,

u = (c +n v) / (n + v/c )

But none of the options have this form. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic velocity addition formula, but the correct answer is (c +n v)/(n +v ), but scaled by 1/c.

Wait, let me see: If I take my expression u = [c (c +n v) ] / (n c + v ), and factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: c (c +n v) = c^2 + c n v.

Denominator: n c + v.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor c from denominator:

Denominator: c (n + v/(c) )

So,

u = [c (c +n v) ] / [c(n + v/c) ) ] = (c +n v)/(n + v/c )

Wait, but then, if I factor v/c from denominator,

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v )

If I multiply numerator and denominator by c, I get (c +n v c )/(n c + v )

Hmm, which doesn't match the expression I have.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab is c/n, regardless of the glass's motion. So the answer would be 1/n, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm not thinking correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the glass's motion affects the refractive index. But that's probably beyond the scope of this question.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing the concept that the speed of light in the medium is c/n and is not affected by the motion of the medium. So the speed remains c/n, which would be 1/n.

Wait, but the options don't have 1/n. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the problem is a trick question, and the speed is just c/n, so when the glass is moving, the speed remains the same because the light is in the medium. But in that case, the answer would be 1/n, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is 1, which is c. But that would imply that the speed of light is c in the lab frame, which is only the case in a vacuum. Since the light is in glass, the speed would be c/n.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Maybe the correct approach is to realize that the speed of light in the glass, as observed in the lab, is c/n. So if the glass is moving, the light's speed is c/n, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is B) 1, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that the light's speed in the glass is c/n, and the glass's speed is v, and the observer sees the light's speed as (c/n) + v.

But in that case, the speed would be (1/n + v), but that's not an option either.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is (c +n v)/(n +v ). Let me compute that:

If I have (c +n v)/(n +v ), and I divide numerator and denominator by c,

= [1 + (n v)/c ] / [ (n/c ) + (v/c ) ]

Which is similar to the expression I had before.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is (1 +n v)/(n +v )

Hmm, perhaps the expression I have can be adjusted.

Wait, my expression is [c (c +n v) ] / (n c + v )

Which is [c^2 +n c v ] / (n c +v )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor c from numerator and denominator.

Wait, the denominator is n c + v = c (n) + v.

The numerator is c^2 + c n v = c (c +n v )

So, [c(c +n v)] / [c (n) +v ]

Hmm, but without knowing the value of c, perhaps this is as far as I can go.

Wait, but the problem says to take c=1. Oh! The speed of light in vacuum is c=1. That's an important detail. So setting c=1.

So, substituting c=1:

u = [1 (1 +n v) ] / (n *1 +v )

Which simplifies to:

u = (1 +n v) / (n +v )

Which is exactly option A.

So the correct answer is option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Key Information**:  
   - The refractive index of the glass is \( n \).  
   - The speed of light in a medium with refractive index \( n \) is \( c/n \) in the rest frame of the medium.  
   - The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer.  
   - The speed of light in vacuum is given as \( c = 1 \).

2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**:  
   To determine the speed of light in the lab frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:  
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
   \]  
   Here, \( u' = c/n \) is the speed of light in the glass (in its rest frame), and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab frame. Substituting \( c = 1 \), the formula becomes:  
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]

3. **Simplification**:  
   Multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \) to simplify:  
   \[
   u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) matches the derived expression exactly.  
   - **Option B**: \( 1 \) implies the speed of light is always \( c \), which is incorrect because the speed of light in a medium is \( c/n \), and the motion of the medium affects the observed speed.  
   - **Option C**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \) has the wrong sign in the denominator, which does not match the derived expression.  
   - **Option D**: \( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \) has the wrong numerator and does not match the derived expression.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The correct answer is **Option A**, as it matches the derived expression for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Oh, wait the beam is propagating through the glass, and the glass is moving towards the observer. So the glass is moving in the direction opposite to the beam's direction because the observer is in front. Wait, no, the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass.

I remember something about relativity and how velocities add. But wait, this is about a medium moving through which light is passing. How does that affect the speed?

Wait, in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. The velocity addition formula is (u + v)/(1 + (u*v)/c²). But wait, that's when you have two inertial frames moving relative to each other. So if the glass is moving at velocity v relative to the lab, and in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n, then in the lab frame, what is the speed?

But wait, the glass is a medium, not an inertial frame. Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Because the glass is moving, but the light is inside it, so perhaps the speed of light in the lab frame would be affected by the movement of the glass.

Wait, another approach: The speed of light in the glass is c/n. But since the glass is moving, maybe we can use the Galilean velocity addition. But wait, Galilean addition is only valid at non-relativistic speeds. But the problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can proceed with that.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame, but that's in a vacuum. But here, it's in a medium. So I'm not sure. Oh wait, wait, the problem is about the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. So perhaps it's not the speed of the photons, but the speed as observed in the lab frame.

Wait, but the speed of light in a medium is c/n, but that's from the medium's rest frame. So if the medium is moving, how does that change the observed speed?

Wait, maybe it's like this: in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. In the glass frame, the light is moving at v_light = c/n relative to the glass. So to find the speed in the lab frame, we add the velocities. But how?

In Galilean terms, the lab would see the light moving at (v_light + v_glass). But wait, that would be (c/n + v). But that can't be right because if v is significant compared to c, that would exceed c, which is impossible.

Alternatively, using special relativity's velocity addition formula. So the formula is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c² ), where u is the velocity of the object in the source frame, and v is the relative velocity between the frames. So in this case, u = c/n, and the frame is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. Wait, but I need to make sure about the directions.

Wait, the glass is moving towards the observer. So if the observer is in the lab frame, and the glass is moving towards him, then the direction of v is towards the observer. The light beam is moving in the same direction as the glass, so in the lab frame, the light is moving towards the observer as well.

Wait, no, the glass is moving toward the observer, so the beam is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at c/n towards the observer. So let's say the glass is moving in the +x direction. Wait, no, because in the lab frame, the glass is moving towards the observer. So if the observer is at rest in the lab, and the glass is moving towards him, then the glass's velocity v is in the direction opposite to the beam's motion? Wait, I'm getting confused about the directions.

Wait, maybe I should define the direction. Let's say the light beam is moving towards the observer. The glass is also moving towards the observer, so the glass is moving in the same direction as the light. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving towards the observer at speed c/n. So in the lab frame, which sees the glass moving at v towards the observer, what is the speed of the light?

Hmm, so I think we can model this using the velocity addition formula. Let me think: in the glass frame (S'), the light's velocity is u' = c/n towards the observer. The lab frame (S) is moving at velocity v relative to S'—wait, wait, no. If S is the lab, and the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light, then the glass's frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. So using the velocity addition formula to find the speed of the light in S.

Wait, the velocity addition formula is:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

In this case, u' is the speed of light in the glass frame, which is c/n. So u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify the denominator: 1 + (v/(n c)). So,

u = ( (c + n v ) / n ) / (1 + v/(n c) )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c:

Numerator becomes (c + n v) * c
Denominator becomes n c + v

So,

u = [c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

But wait, the speed of light is supposed to be c in all frames, but here, it's in a medium. Hmm, but perhaps the problem is not considering this.

Wait, but the problem says, "the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory." So perhaps the speed is considered as (c/n) plus the velocity of the glass, but that's in the non-relativistic case.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the velocity.

Wait, when the glass is moving towards the observer (same direction as the light), then the light's speed in the lab frame would be (c/n) + v. But that can't be correct because if v is significant, it would exceed c, which isn't possible according to relativity.

So perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic velocity addition.

So in the glass frame S', the light's speed is u' = c/n towards the observer. The lab frame S sees the glass moving at velocity v towards the observer, so the lab's frame is moving at velocity -v relative to the glass's frame. So in S, what is the speed u?

Using the velocity addition formula:

u = (u' + v_glass) / (1 + (u' * v_glass)/c² )

Wait, no. The velocity addition formula is when you have an object moving at u' in S', and S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. Then u is the velocity in S.

So in this case, u' is the speed of light in S' (which is the glass frame) moving towards the observer. The glass is moving towards the observer at v in S. So wait, the S' frame is moving at v relative to S. So the formula is:

u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/c² )

So substituting u' = c/n,

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator:

1 + (v) / (n c )

So,

u = [ (c + n v)/n ] / [ (n c + v) / (n c) ) ]

Which is,

u = [ (c + n v) / n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n's cancel,

u = (c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Hmm, but that seems complicated. Let me see. Let's factor numerator and denominator.

Wait, the numerator is c (c + n v), denominator is (n c + v). Hmm, so the expression simplifies to [c(c +n v)] / (n c + v).

Wait, maybe we can factor out c from the denominator:

Denominator: c (n + v/(c) )

So numerator: c (c +n v ) = c^2 + c n v.

Denominator: c (n + v/(c) ) = c n + v.

Wait, perhaps the terms can be rearranged.

Wait, perhaps factor c in the denominator:

Denominator: c (n + v/(c) ) = c n + v. Hmm, same as before.

Wait, maybe I can write the numerator as c (n v + c) = c (c +n v).

So,

u = [c (c +n v)] / [c n + v ]

Hmm, does that match any of the options?

Looking at the options:

Option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v )

But wait, let's see, if I factor c^2 in numerator and denominator.

Wait, the numerator is c (c +n v) = c^2 + c n v.

The denominator is (n c + v ) = n c + v.

If I divide numerator and denominator by c,

Numerator becomes c + n v,

Denominator becomes n + v / c.

Wait, but that gives u = [c + n v ] / [n + v / c ].

Hmm, but that's not matching any options. Let me look again at the options.

Option B is 1, which can't be right because the speed depends on v and n.

Option C is (1 +n v)/(n -v )

Wait, not matching.

Option D: (1 -n v)/(n +v )

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the velocity addition formula. Let me re-examine.

Wait, in the glass's frame S', the light is moving towards the observer at u' = c/n. The glass is moving towards the observer at velocity v in the lab frame S. So S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. So the velocity addition formula is:

u = (u' + v ) / [1 + (u' v ) / c² ]

So substituting u' = c/n,

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (c/n) v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator:

1 + (v) / (n c )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n c:

Numerator: (c + n v) * c

Denominator: n c + v

So,

u = [c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

But this is what I had before. Let me see if this can be rewritten as (1 + (n v)/(c)) ) / (n + v/c ), but that doesn't help directly.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the problem is non-relativistic, so v is much less than c. Then, the expression would approximate to (c/n + v ), but that would be option A if I factor out c.

Wait, let me see option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v )

Wait, if I take my expression [c (c +n v)] / (n c + v ), and divide numerator and denominator by c,

I get (c + n v) / (n + v/c )

In the non-relativistic limit where v << c, v/c is negligible. So denominator approximates to n.

So numerator approximates to c (1 + n v / c )

Wait, but wait, if I take the expression in the non-relativistic case:

u ≈ (c/n + v )

Which would be c/n + v. But none of the options look like that. Hmm.

Wait, looking at option B: 1, which would be c if v is zero. But wait, the speed in the glass is c/n, which is less than c. So option B, which is 1, would only be correct if n=1 and v=0.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Alternative approach: The speed of light in the medium (glass) is always c/n, regardless of the motion of the medium. Wait, but that's only in the rest frame of the medium. From an external frame, the speed would be different. Because in the external frame, the medium is moving.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light is c in vacuum, but in a medium, it's c/n. But the medium's motion affects the observed speed of light.

Wait, maybe using the Doppler effect approach. Hmm, but Doppler effect deals with frequency and wavelength shifts, not the speed.

Alternatively, think about how the speed is measured. If the glass is moving, the light may appear to move at a different speed.

Wait, maybe another approach: the observer in the lab sees the glass moving at velocity v. The light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So the speed of light relative to the lab would be c/n plus v, but that again could exceed c, which isn't possible.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. But that's in a vacuum. Here, it's in a medium, so perhaps the speed can be more than c/n but not more than c.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's look at the answer options again.

Option B is 1, meaning c. So if the glass is moving, could the light's speed be c in the lab frame? That would happen if the glass's motion somehow compensates for the medium's refractive index. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is trying to test the understanding that the speed of light in a medium is c/n, regardless of the medium's motion. But that can't be right, because the medium's motion would affect the observed speed.

Wait, another thought: in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v. Inside the glass, the speed of light is c/n. So the speed of light in the lab frame would be c/n plus v, but that's the Galilean addition which isn't correct for high speeds.

Wait, but according to relativity, the speed of light can't exceed c. So perhaps the correct approach is that the speed of light in the lab frame is still c.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because the medium is moving. Or does it?

Wait, no, the speed of light in a medium is not affected by the motion of the medium. Wait, no, that's not correct either. Because the medium's motion can influence the light's speed as observed in another frame.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think of it another way. Let's imagine that the glass is moving at velocity v in the same direction as the light. The light's speed in the glass is c/n. So from the lab frame, the speed would be (c/n) + v, but this can't be right because if v is close to c, and n is small, the sum could exceed c.

But according to relativity, the speed can't exceed c. So perhaps that approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to treat the glass as a medium, so the speed of light inside it is c/n. But since the glass is moving, the observer in the lab would measure the speed as (c/n) plus v, but only if the velocity addition is Galilean. But that's only accurate for low speeds.

But the problem doesn't specify that v is small, so using Galilean addition may not be correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (c/n + v)/(1 + (c v)/(n c^2 )), but that doesn't help because it's not matching any options.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem is considering that the light's speed in the lab frame is c/n, regardless of the glass's motion. But that would ignore the motion of the medium.

Hmm, but that would mean the answer is (1/n), but none of the options is 1/n. So perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is 1. So that's c. Could the answer be B?

Wait, but only if the glass's motion somehow makes the light's speed equal to c. That would require that (c/n) = c - v, but that depends on v and n, which isn't necessarily the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the speed of light in the glass is always c/n, regardless of the glass's motion. But that's not correct according to relativity, as the speed of light is only c in a vacuum. In a medium, the speed is c/n, but from the lab frame, which is seeing the medium move, perhaps the speed is different.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think of it in terms of the observer in the lab. The glass is moving towards them at v. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So the speed of the light in the lab frame would be (c/n) + v, but considering relativistic effects.

Wait, but in reality, the speed of light can't be more than c. So perhaps the correct approach is that the speed of light in the lab frame is c, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: The speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's frame. If the medium is moving, the observed speed in the lab would be c/n plus v, but only for non-relativistic speeds. But the problem doesn't specify that v is small.

Wait, but none of the options directly match (c/n + v). Let me look at the options again.

Option A: (1 + n v)/(n + v )

Hmm. Let me compute this:

(1 + n v)/(n +v ) = [1 + n v]/(n + v )

If I factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 1 + n v = n v +1.

Denominator: n + v.

Hmm, perhaps if I factor out n from denominator:

(n + v) = n (1 + v/(n) )

So,

[1 + n v]/[n(1 + v/n ) ] = (1 +n v)/(n (1 + v/n )) )

= [ (1 +n v) ] / [n + v ]

Hmm, that doesn't seem to help.

Wait, but let me compute the expression I got before from the velocity addition formula:

u = [c (c +n v) ] / (n c + v )

If I divide numerator and denominator by c,

u = (c +n v) / (n + v/c )

But none of the options have this form. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the relativistic velocity addition formula, but the correct answer is (c +n v)/(n +v ), but scaled by 1/c.

Wait, let me see: If I take my expression u = [c (c +n v) ] / (n c + v ), and factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: c (c +n v) = c^2 + c n v.

Denominator: n c + v.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor c from denominator:

Denominator: c (n + v/(c) )

So,

u = [c (c +n v) ] / [c(n + v/c) ) ] = (c +n v)/(n + v/c )

Wait, but then, if I factor v/c from denominator,

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let's look at the options again.

Option A: (1 +n v)/(n +v )

If I multiply numerator and denominator by c, I get (c +n v c )/(n c + v )

Hmm, which doesn't match the expression I have.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the speed of light in the glass relative to the lab is c/n, regardless of the glass's motion. So the answer would be 1/n, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm not thinking correctly.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the glass's motion affects the refractive index. But that's probably beyond the scope of this question.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is testing the concept that the speed of light in the medium is c/n and is not affected by the motion of the medium. So the speed remains c/n, which would be 1/n.

Wait, but the options don't have 1/n. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the problem is a trick question, and the speed is just c/n, so when the glass is moving, the speed remains the same because the light is in the medium. But in that case, the answer would be 1/n, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking back at the options, option B is 1, which is c. But that would imply that the speed of light is c in the lab frame, which is only the case in a vacuum. Since the light is in glass, the speed would be c/n.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Maybe the correct approach is to realize that the speed of light in the glass, as observed in the lab, is c/n. So if the glass is moving, the light's speed is c/n, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is B) 1, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering that the light's speed in the glass is c/n, and the glass's speed is v, and the observer sees the light's speed as (c/n) + v.

But in that case, the speed would be (1/n + v), but that's not an option either.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is (c +n v)/(n +v ). Let me compute that:

If I have (c +n v)/(n +v ), and I divide numerator and denominator by c,

= [1 + (n v)/c ] / [ (n/c ) + (v/c ) ]

Which is similar to the expression I had before.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (1 +n v)/(n +v ), which is (1 +n v)/(n +v )

Hmm, perhaps the expression I have can be adjusted.

Wait, my expression is [c (c +n v) ] / (n c + v )

Which is [c^2 +n c v ] / (n c +v )

Hmm, perhaps I can factor c from numerator and denominator.

Wait, the denominator is n c + v = c (n) + v.

The numerator is c^2 + c n v = c (c +n v )

So, [c(c +n v)] / [c (n) +v ]

Hmm, but without knowing the value of c, perhaps this is as far as I can go.

Wait, but the problem says to take c=1. Oh! The speed of light in vacuum is c=1. That's an important detail. So setting c=1.

So, substituting c=1:

u = [1 (1 +n v) ] / (n *1 +v )

Which simplifies to:

u = (1 +n v) / (n +v )

Which is exactly option A.

So the correct answer is option A.


To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Key Information**:  
   - The refractive index of the glass is \( n \).  
   - The speed of light in a medium with refractive index \( n \) is \( c/n \) in the rest frame of the medium.  
   - The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer.  
   - The speed of light in vacuum is given as \( c = 1 \).

2. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**:  
   To determine the speed of light in the lab frame, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:  
   \[
   u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
   \]  
   Here, \( u' = c/n \) is the speed of light in the glass (in its rest frame), and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the lab frame. Substituting \( c = 1 \), the formula becomes:  
   \[
   u = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]

3. **Simplification**:  
   Multiply the numerator and denominator by \( n \) to simplify:  
   \[
   u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) matches the derived expression exactly.  
   - **Option B**: \( 1 \) implies the speed of light is always \( c \), which is incorrect because the speed of light in a medium is \( c/n \), and the motion of the medium affects the observed speed.  
   - **Option C**: \( \frac{1 + n v}{n - v} \) has the wrong sign in the denominator, which does not match the derived expression.  
   - **Option D**: \( \frac{1 - n v}{n + v} \) has the wrong numerator and does not match the derived expression.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The correct answer is **Option A**, as it matches the derived expression for the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory.
