Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

So the problem says: We have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. We're told that |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think is the Pauli z matrix.

The question has two parts. First, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, wait, that doesn't sound right. Because if i is not equal to j, but in a 2x2 matrix, for i=1 and j=2, and i=2 and j=1, the elements would be hbar/2. But for i=j, it's zero. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0     ]

Hmm, because in a 2x2 matrix, the positions are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. Wait, but that can't be right because the trace of the matrix would be zero, which might make it tricky for an observable. Because observables need to have real eigenvalues, I think, so maybe this matrix is Hermitian?

Wait, is the matrix given correct? Because if A_ij is hbar/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise, then for a 2x2 matrix, the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are hbar/2. But unless hbar/2 is a real number, which it is, the matrix is Hermitian only if the elements are real and symmetric. So for a 2x2 case, it'd be:

0   hbar/2
hbar/2 0

Which is indeed Hermitian because the elements are real and symmetric. So this operator is Hermitian, which makes sense for an observable.

So the first part is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. Wait, but wait, the state |alpha> is given in terms of the spin-z basis (|up> and |down>), which are the eigenstates of S_z. But the operator here is not S_z; it's some other operator with this matrix.

So, the eigenstates of A (this operator) are different from the |up> and |down> states. Therefore, to find the probabilities, we'd need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A and then find the expansion coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the eigenstates of A first. Let's try that.

The matrix A is:
[0, hbar/2;
 hbar/2, 0]

This is a 2x2 matrix. To find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, let's compute the characteristic equation.

The trace is 0, and the determinant is (0)(0) - (hbar/2)^2 = -(hbar^2)/4.

The eigenvalues λ satisfy λ^2 - trace(A) λ + det(A) = 0. Since trace is zero, equation is λ^2 + det(A) = 0 → λ^2 = - det(A) → det(A) is - (hbar/2)^2, so λ^2 = (hbar/2)^2 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2, each with multiplicity 1.

Wait, but wait a second, the determinant is (0)(0) - (hbar/2)^2 = -(hbar/2)^2. So the characteristic equation is λ² = (hbar/2)^2 → λ = ± hbar/2.

Now, the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - λ I) v = 0.

Matrix becomes:

[ -hbar/2, hbar/2;
  hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]

The equations are:

- (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1; 1]. But wait, because the matrix is scaled by hbar/2, but when we solve, we can set v1 = 1, so the eigenvector is (1,1).

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:

(A + λ I) v = 0 → [ (hbar/2), (hbar/2);
                   (hbar/2), (hbar/2) ]

Which gives:

(hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1; -1].

But wait, these eigenvectors are in the basis of |up> and |down>. Let me double-check.

Wait, in our case, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of S_z, which are the standard basis vectors. So the operator A is expressed in this same basis. So the eigenvectors are in the same basis.

So the eigenstates of A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because when I found the eigenvectors, they were [1,1] and [1,-1], but normalized.

Wait, but wait: the eigenvectors we found were [1,1] and [1,-1], but they are not normalized. So the normalized eigenstates would be (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), because |up> and |down> are orthonormal, so the norm is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates are |+> and |-> as I said.

So now, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

But first, we need to normalize |alpha> because the problem says it's "proportional" to that vector. So let's compute the normalization factor.

The state is |alpha> = c [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ], where c is a normalization constant. So the squared norm is |c|^2 times [ |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2 ].

Compute |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Compute |2 - i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So squared norm is c² (2 +5)=7. Thus, c = 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ].

Now, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+> and |->.

So |alpha> = a |+> + b |->.

We can compute a and b by taking inner products. Alternatively, express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

Let me write |+> as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> as (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = a [ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) ] + b [ (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) ]

= [ a (1/sqrt(2)) + b (1/sqrt(2)) ] |up> + [ a (1/sqrt(2)) - b (1/sqrt(2)) ] |down>

So this should equal (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

Therefore, equating coefficients:

Coeff of |up>:
( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i) / sqrt(7)

Coeff of |down>:
( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i) / sqrt(7)

So we have two equations:

1. (a + b) = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] * sqrt(2)
2. (a - b) = [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] * sqrt(2)

Adding equations 1 and 2:

2a = [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)
Simplify numerator: 1+2 + i -i =3 → 3/(sqrt(7)) * sqrt(2) → 2a = 3 sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → a = (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7)) )

But wait, wait, let's compute that again.

Wait, [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] = 3. So 3/sqrt(7) multiplied by sqrt(2) → 3 sqrt(2)/sqrt(7).

So 2a = (3 sqrt(2)) / sqrt(7) → a = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)).

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)
Simplify numerator: 1 -2 +i +i → (-1) + 2i → (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)

So 2b = ( (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ) / sqrt(7) → b = [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Wait, but this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute a and b by using the inner product.

Because |+> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So a is the inner product < + | alpha >.

Similarly, b is < - | alpha >.

Since |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

So compute a = < + | alpha >.

< + | is ( <up | + <down | ) / sqrt(2).

So a = (1/sqrt(7)) ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

= (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <up|down> + (1+i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <down|down> ] / sqrt(2)

But <up|down> = 0, so it's:

= (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) (1) + (2 -i)(0) + (1+i)(0) + (2 -i)(1) ] / sqrt(2)

= (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ) ] / sqrt(2)

Compute numerator:

1 + i +2 -i → 3.

So a = (3) / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) ) → 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, compute b = < - | alpha >.

< - | = ( <up | - <down | ) / sqrt(2)

So,

b = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) <up|up> - (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|up> - (2 -i) <down|down> ] / sqrt(2)

Again, cross terms are zero, so:

= (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)(1) - (2 -i)(1) ] / sqrt(2)

Because <up|up> =1, <down|down> =1, and the cross terms are zero.

So numerator:

(1 +i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So b = (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) → (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2: (3)^2 / (14) )= 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, |b|^2: | (-1 + 2i) |^2 /14 → [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 → 1 +4=5 →5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but let me compute |b|^2 correctly.

|b|^2 = [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) ] / (sqrt(14))^2 → (1 +4)/14 → 5/14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.64286 and 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which are close to 9/14 (≈0.642857) and 5/14 (≈0.35714), but option A's second probability is 0.36 which is 9/25, which doesn't match 5/14. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of a and b.

Wait, in the a calculation, I had:

a = < + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(2) → (3) / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) ) → 3/sqrt(14), so |a|^2 is 9/14 ≈0.642857.

In the b calculation, I had:

b = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 +i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(2) → ( (1 +i) -2 +i ) → (-1 + 2i) → so |b|^2 is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / (14) → 5/14 ≈0.35714.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 0.28, 0.72 → 0.28 is 2/7 (~0.2857), 0.72 is 5/7 (~0.714). Not matching.

Option A: 0.64 (close to 9/14 ≈0.6428) and 0.36 (which is 9/25=0.36, but 5/14≈0.3571). So 0.36 is off.

Option D: 0.61 and 0.29. Hmm, 9/14 is approx 0.6428, which is a bit higher than option A's first probability.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Another approach: perhaps the operator is actually the spin-x operator. Because the spin-x Pauli matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and when multiplied by ħ/2, it's exactly the matrix given in the problem. So operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of σ_x, which are |+x> and |−x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So to find the probability of measuring |+x> and |−x>, we need to express |alpha> in terms of these states.

So, |alpha> is (1 +i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

Expressed as a combination of |+x> and |−x>.

Let me compute the coefficients a and b as before.

Alternatively, since we already did that, and found |a|^2 =9/14 and |b|^2=5/14, which are approximately 0.6428 and 0.3571.

Looking back at the options, option C is 0.28 and 0.72, which are higher and lower respectively. Option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which is close to 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which would round to 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which rounds to 0.36. So that matches option A's probabilities (0.64, 0.36). But let me check the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Wait, but the second part is the average value of A.

So we need to compute the expectation value <A>.

The expectation value is <alpha | A | alpha>.

But given that |alpha> is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+> and |->, the expectation value can be computed as |a|^2 * (hbar/2) + |b|^2 * (-hbar/2).

Because |+> has eigenvalue hbar/2 and |-> has eigenvalue -hbar/2.

So <A> = |a|^2*(hbar/2) + |b|^2*(-hbar/2) = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2).

Compute this:

= [ (9/14)(1/2) - (5/14)(1/2) ] hbar

= [ (9 -5)/28 ] hbar

= (4/28) hbar = (1/7) hbar.

So the expectation value is hbar/7, which matches option A's third value.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), and expectation value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that should be the correct choice.

Wait, but let's make sure about the calculation.

Wait, another approach: compute <A> directly.

The state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

The operator A is represented by the matrix [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

So when you apply A to |alpha>, you get:

A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ ( ħ/2 * |down> ) + ( ħ/2 * |up> ) ]

Because A|up> = (ħ/2)|down>, and A|down> = (ħ/2)|up>.

So,

A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * ħ/2 ( |down> + |up> )

= (ħ/(2 sqrt(7))) (|up> + |down> )

Now, the expectation value <A> is <alpha | A | alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i)(1+i) + (2 -i)(2 + i) ] * (ħ/2) * (1/2) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it using matrix elements.

Compute <alpha | A | alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i, 2 +i) ] * A * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T.

Wait, because |alpha> is a column vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

So, <alpha | A | alpha> = (1/7) [ (1-i, 2+i) ] * A * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T.

Compute this product.

First, A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

So, compute A * [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T:

= [ (0*(1+i) + (ħ/2)*(2 -i) ), ( (ħ/2)*(1+i) + 0*(2-i) ) ]

= [ ( (2 -i) ħ/2 ), ( (1 +i) ħ/2 ) ]

Now, multiply by [ (1-i, 2 +i ) ]:

= (1-i)*( (2 -i) ħ/2 ) + (2 +i) * ( (1 +i) ħ/2 )

Let's compute each term.

First term: (1 -i) (2 -i) → (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) → 2 -i -2i + i² → 2 -3i -1 → (1 -3i).

Second term: (2 +i)(1+i) → 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i → 2 + 2i + i + i² → 2 +3i -1 → (1 +3i).

So sum of terms:

[ (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ] * (ħ/2) /7 ?

Wait, wait, let me recompute:

Wait, the entire expression is [ (1-i) (2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] multiplied by (ħ/2) and then multiplied by (1/7).

Compute each part:

(1 - i)(2 - i) = 2 -i -2i +i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2(1) +2i +i(1) +i^2 = 2 +2i +i -1 = (1) +3i.

So sum is (1-3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So <A> = (2) * ( ħ/2 ) * (1/7 ) → (2 * ħ/2 ) /7 → (ħ) /7.

So <A> is ħ /7, which matches option A.

That's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So the option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and <A> is ħ/7.

So the correct answer must be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state and operator. The state is given as:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right],
\]

where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-component of the spin operator. The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenstates of \( A \)
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \). This gives:

\[
\lambda^2 = \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)^2 \implies \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

The corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 2: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in Terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \)
The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is expressed as:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = a|+\rangle + b|-\rangle.
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), we equate coefficients:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} |\downarrow\rangle + \frac{b}{\sqrt{2}} |\uparrow\rangle - \frac{b}{\sqrt{2}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Matching coefficients with \( |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right] \), we find:

\[
\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Solving these, we compute:

\[
a = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad b = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of Measuring Eigenstates
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) are given by \( |a|^2 \) and \( |b|^2 \), respectively:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6428, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \).

### Step 4: Average Value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |b|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting \( |a|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \):

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

So the problem says: We have an electron state |alpha> which is proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2-i)|down>. We're told that |up> and |down> are eigenstates of the z-projection of the spin operator, which I think is the Pauli z matrix.

The question has two parts. First, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of a certain operator. The matrix representation of this operator has elements A_ij where A_ij = hbar/2 if i != j, and 0 otherwise. Wait, wait, that doesn't sound right. Because if i is not equal to j, but in a 2x2 matrix, for i=1 and j=2, and i=2 and j=1, the elements would be hbar/2. But for i=j, it's zero. So the matrix looks like:

[ 0      hbar/2 ]
[ hbar/2  0     ]

Hmm, because in a 2x2 matrix, the positions are (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2). So the diagonal elements are zero, and the off-diagonal are hbar/2. Wait, but that can't be right because the trace of the matrix would be zero, which might make it tricky for an observable. Because observables need to have real eigenvalues, I think, so maybe this matrix is Hermitian?

Wait, is the matrix given correct? Because if A_ij is hbar/2 when i≠j and 0 otherwise, then for a 2x2 matrix, the (1,2) and (2,1) elements are hbar/2. But unless hbar/2 is a real number, which it is, the matrix is Hermitian only if the elements are real and symmetric. So for a 2x2 case, it'd be:

0   hbar/2
hbar/2 0

Which is indeed Hermitian because the elements are real and symmetric. So this operator is Hermitian, which makes sense for an observable.

So the first part is to find the probability of measuring the particle in each eigenstate of this operator. Wait, but wait, the state |alpha> is given in terms of the spin-z basis (|up> and |down>), which are the eigenstates of S_z. But the operator here is not S_z; it's some other operator with this matrix.

So, the eigenstates of A (this operator) are different from the |up> and |down> states. Therefore, to find the probabilities, we'd need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A and then find the expansion coefficients.

Alternatively, perhaps we can find the eigenstates of A first. Let's try that.

The matrix A is:
[0, hbar/2;
 hbar/2, 0]

This is a 2x2 matrix. To find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, let's compute the characteristic equation.

The trace is 0, and the determinant is (0)(0) - (hbar/2)^2 = -(hbar^2)/4.

The eigenvalues λ satisfy λ^2 - trace(A) λ + det(A) = 0. Since trace is zero, equation is λ^2 + det(A) = 0 → λ^2 = - det(A) → det(A) is - (hbar/2)^2, so λ^2 = (hbar/2)^2 → λ = ± hbar/2.

So the eigenvalues are hbar/2 and -hbar/2, each with multiplicity 1.

Wait, but wait a second, the determinant is (0)(0) - (hbar/2)^2 = -(hbar/2)^2. So the characteristic equation is λ² = (hbar/2)^2 → λ = ± hbar/2.

Now, the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue.

For λ = hbar/2:

(A - λ I) v = 0.

Matrix becomes:

[ -hbar/2, hbar/2;
  hbar/2, -hbar/2 ]

The equations are:

- (hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → -v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = v1.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1; 1]. But wait, because the matrix is scaled by hbar/2, but when we solve, we can set v1 = 1, so the eigenvector is (1,1).

Similarly, for λ = -hbar/2:

(A + λ I) v = 0 → [ (hbar/2), (hbar/2);
                   (hbar/2), (hbar/2) ]

Which gives:

(hbar/2) v1 + (hbar/2) v2 = 0 → v1 + v2 = 0 → v2 = -v1.

So the eigenvectors are proportional to [1; -1].

But wait, these eigenvectors are in the basis of |up> and |down>. Let me double-check.

Wait, in our case, |up> and |down> are the eigenstates of S_z, which are the standard basis vectors. So the operator A is expressed in this same basis. So the eigenvectors are in the same basis.

So the eigenstates of A are |+> = (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and |-> = (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2). Because when I found the eigenvectors, they were [1,1] and [1,-1], but normalized.

Wait, but wait: the eigenvectors we found were [1,1] and [1,-1], but they are not normalized. So the normalized eigenstates would be (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), because |up> and |down> are orthonormal, so the norm is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2).

So the eigenstates are |+> and |-> as I said.

So now, the state |alpha> is given as proportional to (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down>.

But first, we need to normalize |alpha> because the problem says it's "proportional" to that vector. So let's compute the normalization factor.

The state is |alpha> = c [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ], where c is a normalization constant. So the squared norm is |c|^2 times [ |1+i|^2 + |2 - i|^2 ].

Compute |1+i|^2: (1)^2 + (1)^2 = 2.

Compute |2 - i|^2: (2)^2 + (-1)^2 = 4 +1=5.

So squared norm is c² (2 +5)=7. Thus, c = 1/sqrt(7). So |alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 - i)|down> ].

Now, we need to express |alpha> in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+> and |->.

So |alpha> = a |+> + b |->.

We can compute a and b by taking inner products. Alternatively, express |alpha> in terms of |+> and |->.

Let me write |+> as (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2), and |-> as (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2).

So, substituting into |alpha>:

|alpha> = a [ (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) ] + b [ (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2) ]

= [ a (1/sqrt(2)) + b (1/sqrt(2)) ] |up> + [ a (1/sqrt(2)) - b (1/sqrt(2)) ] |down>

So this should equal (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

Therefore, equating coefficients:

Coeff of |up>:
( a + b ) / sqrt(2) = (1 + i) / sqrt(7)

Coeff of |down>:
( a - b ) / sqrt(2) = (2 - i) / sqrt(7)

So we have two equations:

1. (a + b) = [ (1+i)/sqrt(7) ] * sqrt(2)
2. (a - b) = [ (2 - i)/sqrt(7) ] * sqrt(2)

Adding equations 1 and 2:

2a = [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ] / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)
Simplify numerator: 1+2 + i -i =3 → 3/(sqrt(7)) * sqrt(2) → 2a = 3 sqrt(2)/sqrt(7) → a = (3 sqrt(2))/(2 sqrt(7)) )

But wait, wait, let's compute that again.

Wait, [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] = 3. So 3/sqrt(7) multiplied by sqrt(2) → 3 sqrt(2)/sqrt(7).

So 2a = (3 sqrt(2)) / sqrt(7) → a = (3 sqrt(2)) / (2 sqrt(7)).

Similarly, subtracting equation 2 from equation 1:

2b = [ (1+i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)
Simplify numerator: 1 -2 +i +i → (-1) + 2i → (-1 + 2i) / sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)

So 2b = ( (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ) / sqrt(7) → b = [ (-1 + 2i) sqrt(2) ] / (2 sqrt(7)) )

Wait, but this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute a and b by using the inner product.

Because |+> is (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2). So a is the inner product < + | alpha >.

Similarly, b is < - | alpha >.

Since |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

So compute a = < + | alpha >.

< + | is ( <up | + <down | ) / sqrt(2).

So a = (1/sqrt(7)) ( <up| + <down| ) / sqrt(2) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

= (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) <up|up> + (2 -i) <up|down> + (1+i) <down|up> + (2 -i) <down|down> ] / sqrt(2)

But <up|down> = 0, so it's:

= (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) (1) + (2 -i)(0) + (1+i)(0) + (2 -i)(1) ] / sqrt(2)

= (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 + i) + (2 - i) ) ] / sqrt(2)

Compute numerator:

1 + i +2 -i → 3.

So a = (3) / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) ) → 3/(sqrt(14)).

Similarly, compute b = < - | alpha >.

< - | = ( <up | - <down | ) / sqrt(2)

So,

b = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) <up|up> - (1+i) <up|down> + (2 -i) <down|up> - (2 -i) <down|down> ] / sqrt(2)

Again, cross terms are zero, so:

= (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)(1) - (2 -i)(1) ] / sqrt(2)

Because <up|up> =1, <down|down> =1, and the cross terms are zero.

So numerator:

(1 +i) - (2 -i) = 1 +i -2 +i = (-1) + 2i.

So b = (-1 + 2i) / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(2)) → (-1 + 2i)/sqrt(14).

Now, the probabilities are |a|^2 and |b|^2.

Compute |a|^2: (3)^2 / (14) )= 9/14 ≈ 0.642857.

Similarly, |b|^2: | (-1 + 2i) |^2 /14 → [ (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ] /14 → 1 +4=5 →5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but let me compute |b|^2 correctly.

|b|^2 = [ ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) ] / (sqrt(14))^2 → (1 +4)/14 → 5/14.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈ 0.64286 and 5/14 ≈ 0.35714.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says 0.64 and 0.36, which are close to 9/14 (≈0.642857) and 5/14 (≈0.35714), but option A's second probability is 0.36 which is 9/25, which doesn't match 5/14. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation of a and b.

Wait, in the a calculation, I had:

a = < + | alpha > = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i) + (2 -i) ] / sqrt(2) → (3) / ( sqrt(7) * sqrt(2) ) → 3/sqrt(14), so |a|^2 is 9/14 ≈0.642857.

In the b calculation, I had:

b = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1 +i) - (2 -i) ] / sqrt(2) → ( (1 +i) -2 +i ) → (-1 + 2i) → so |b|^2 is ( (-1)^2 + (2)^2 ) / (14) → 5/14 ≈0.35714.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 0.28, 0.72 → 0.28 is 2/7 (~0.2857), 0.72 is 5/7 (~0.714). Not matching.

Option A: 0.64 (close to 9/14 ≈0.6428) and 0.36 (which is 9/25=0.36, but 5/14≈0.3571). So 0.36 is off.

Option D: 0.61 and 0.29. Hmm, 9/14 is approx 0.6428, which is a bit higher than option A's first probability.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Another approach: perhaps the operator is actually the spin-x operator. Because the spin-x Pauli matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]], and when multiplied by ħ/2, it's exactly the matrix given in the problem. So operator A is (ħ/2) σ_x.

So the eigenstates of A would be the eigenstates of σ_x, which are |+x> and |−x>, which are (|up> + |down>)/sqrt(2) and (|up> - |down>)/sqrt(2), respectively.

So to find the probability of measuring |+x> and |−x>, we need to express |alpha> in terms of these states.

So, |alpha> is (1 +i)|up> + (2 -i)|down>, normalized by 1/sqrt(7).

Expressed as a combination of |+x> and |−x>.

Let me compute the coefficients a and b as before.

Alternatively, since we already did that, and found |a|^2 =9/14 and |b|^2=5/14, which are approximately 0.6428 and 0.3571.

Looking back at the options, option C is 0.28 and 0.72, which are higher and lower respectively. Option A is 0.64 and 0.36, which is close to 9/14 and 5/14.

Wait, 9/14 is approximately 0.642857, which would round to 0.64, and 5/14 is approximately 0.357, which rounds to 0.36. So that matches option A's probabilities (0.64, 0.36). But let me check the options again.

Option A: 0.64, 0.36 and hbar/7.

Wait, but the second part is the average value of A.

So we need to compute the expectation value <A>.

The expectation value is <alpha | A | alpha>.

But given that |alpha> is expressed in terms of the eigenstates of A, which are |+> and |->, the expectation value can be computed as |a|^2 * (hbar/2) + |b|^2 * (-hbar/2).

Because |+> has eigenvalue hbar/2 and |-> has eigenvalue -hbar/2.

So <A> = |a|^2*(hbar/2) + |b|^2*(-hbar/2) = (9/14)(hbar/2) + (5/14)(-hbar/2).

Compute this:

= [ (9/14)(1/2) - (5/14)(1/2) ] hbar

= [ (9 -5)/28 ] hbar

= (4/28) hbar = (1/7) hbar.

So the expectation value is hbar/7, which matches option A's third value.

So the probabilities are 9/14 (~0.64) and 5/14 (~0.36), and expectation value is hbar/7.

Looking at the options, option A says 0.64, 0.36, and hbar/7. So that should be the correct choice.

Wait, but let's make sure about the calculation.

Wait, another approach: compute <A> directly.

The state |alpha> is (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i)|up> + (2 -i)|down> ]

The operator A is represented by the matrix [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

So when you apply A to |alpha>, you get:

A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ ( ħ/2 * |down> ) + ( ħ/2 * |up> ) ]

Because A|up> = (ħ/2)|down>, and A|down> = (ħ/2)|up>.

So,

A|alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) * ħ/2 ( |down> + |up> )

= (ħ/(2 sqrt(7))) (|up> + |down> )

Now, the expectation value <A> is <alpha | A | alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i)(1+i) + (2 -i)(2 + i) ] * (ħ/2) * (1/2) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it using matrix elements.

Compute <alpha | A | alpha> = (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1-i, 2 +i) ] * A * (1/sqrt(7)) [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T.

Wait, because |alpha> is a column vector [ (1+i)/sqrt(7), (2 -i)/sqrt(7) ].

So, <alpha | A | alpha> = (1/7) [ (1-i, 2+i) ] * A * [ (1+i), (2-i) ]^T.

Compute this product.

First, A is [[0, ħ/2], [ħ/2, 0]]

So, compute A * [ (1+i), (2 -i) ]^T:

= [ (0*(1+i) + (ħ/2)*(2 -i) ), ( (ħ/2)*(1+i) + 0*(2-i) ) ]

= [ ( (2 -i) ħ/2 ), ( (1 +i) ħ/2 ) ]

Now, multiply by [ (1-i, 2 +i ) ]:

= (1-i)*( (2 -i) ħ/2 ) + (2 +i) * ( (1 +i) ħ/2 )

Let's compute each term.

First term: (1 -i) (2 -i) → (1)(2) + (1)(-i) + (-i)(2) + (-i)(-i) → 2 -i -2i + i² → 2 -3i -1 → (1 -3i).

Second term: (2 +i)(1+i) → 2*1 + 2*i + i*1 + i*i → 2 + 2i + i + i² → 2 +3i -1 → (1 +3i).

So sum of terms:

[ (1 -3i) + (1 +3i) ] * (ħ/2) /7 ?

Wait, wait, let me recompute:

Wait, the entire expression is [ (1-i) (2 -i) + (2 +i)(1 +i) ] multiplied by (ħ/2) and then multiplied by (1/7).

Compute each part:

(1 - i)(2 - i) = 2 -i -2i +i^2 = 2 -3i -1 = 1 -3i.

(2 +i)(1 +i) = 2(1) +2i +i(1) +i^2 = 2 +2i +i -1 = (1) +3i.

So sum is (1-3i) + (1 +3i) = 2.

So <A> = (2) * ( ħ/2 ) * (1/7 ) → (2 * ħ/2 ) /7 → (ħ) /7.

So <A> is ħ /7, which matches option A.

That's correct.

So the probabilities are 9/14 ≈0.6428 and 5/14≈0.3571, which are approximately 0.64 and 0.36. So the option A's probabilities are 0.64 and 0.36, and <A> is ħ/7.

So the correct answer must be option A.


To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given state and operator. The state is given as:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right],
\]

where \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are the eigenstates of the \( z \)-component of the spin operator. The operator \( A \) has the matrix representation:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{\hbar}{2} \\
\frac{\hbar}{2} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues and Eigenstates of \( A \)
The eigenvalues of \( A \) are found by solving the characteristic equation \( \det(A - \lambda I) = 0 \). This gives:

\[
\lambda^2 = \left(\frac{\hbar}{2}\right)^2 \implies \lambda = \pm \frac{\hbar}{2}.
\]

The corresponding eigenstates are:

\[
|+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle + |\downarrow\rangle \right), \quad |-\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |\uparrow\rangle - |\downarrow\rangle \right).
\]

### Step 2: Express \( |\alpha\rangle \) in Terms of \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \)
The state \( |\alpha\rangle \) is expressed as:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = a|+\rangle + b|-\rangle.
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \), we equate coefficients:

\[
|\alpha\rangle = \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} |\uparrow\rangle + \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} |\downarrow\rangle + \frac{b}{\sqrt{2}} |\uparrow\rangle - \frac{b}{\sqrt{2}} |\downarrow\rangle.
\]

Matching coefficients with \( |\alpha\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{7}} \left[ (1+i)|\uparrow\rangle + (2-i)|\downarrow\rangle \right] \), we find:

\[
\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1+i}{\sqrt{7}}, \quad \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2-i}{\sqrt{7}}.
\]

Solving these, we compute:

\[
a = \frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}, \quad b = \frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}.
\]

### Step 3: Probabilities of Measuring Eigenstates
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates \( |+\rangle \) and \( |-\rangle \) are given by \( |a|^2 \) and \( |b|^2 \), respectively:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(\frac{3}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{14} \approx 0.6428, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{-1+2i}{\sqrt{14}}\right)^2 = \frac{5}{14} \approx 0.3571.
\]

Thus, the probabilities are approximately \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \).

### Step 4: Average Value of \( A \)
The expectation value of \( A \) is:

\[
\langle A \rangle = |a|^2 \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + |b|^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right).
\]

Substituting \( |a|^2 = \frac{9}{14} \) and \( |b|^2 = \frac{5}{14} \):

\[
\langle A \rangle = \frac{9}{14} \cdot \frac{\hbar}{2} + \frac{5}{14} \cdot \left(-\frac{\hbar}{2}\right) = \frac{\hbar}{7}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probabilities of measuring the eigenstates are \( 0.64 \) and \( 0.36 \), and the average value of \( A \) is \( \frac{\hbar}{7} \). Comparing with the options, the correct choice is:

**Answer: A**
