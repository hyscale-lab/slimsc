Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the question is about a mixture X that undergoes some reactions and leads to mixture Y, which then forms a hydrocarbon Z. The problem gives some clues about their structures and properties, and I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are A to D, with numbers 16, 18, 22, 12.

Let me break down the information given.

First, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Decolorizing bromine water usually means the substance has double bonds, as alkenes or alkynes can react with bromine. Since it's a mixture of two liquids, maybe they're each with unsaturated structures.

When treated with platinum and heated, mixture X undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. The reaction is a disproportionation, which means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. Wait, but wait—decolorizing bromine water might imply they have double bonds. But after treatment with Pt and heat, it becomes Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine. So Y's components must not have double bonds or maybe less unsaturation.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y under severe conditions gives only one substance Z. So hydrogenation of X and Y both yield the same product, Z. Also, Z is a hydrocarbon, with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. Hmm, 14.28% is approximately 1/7, because 100/7 is about 14.28. So the molecular formula could give that percentage.

Wait, let me calculate the molecular formula. Let's say the hydrocarbon Z has molecular formula CnHm. The mass of hydrogen is (m/(12n + m)) * 100 = 14.28%. Let's solve for m.

14.28 = (m/(12n + m)) * 100  
0.1428 = m/(12n + m)  
Multiply both sides by denominator:  
0.1428*(12n + m) = m  
1.7136n + 0.1428m = m  
1.7136n = m - 0.1428m  
1.7136n = 0.8572m  
n/m = 0.8572 / 1.7136 ≈ 0.5. So n is about half of m.

Wait, let me check that again. Let me compute 0.8572 / 1.7136:

0.8572 ÷ 1.7136 ≈ 0.5. So n ≈ m/2.

So, for each carbon, there are about two hydrogens. That seems like a highly saturated molecule, maybe ethane or something similar. Alternatively, maybe a larger alkane.

Wait, but wait, for ethane, C2H6, the hydrogen mass fraction is (6)/(24 +6)*100 = 6/30 *100 = 20%. But we have 14.28%, which is lower. So ethane's 20% is higher than 14.28%. Hmm.

Wait, propane is C3H8. H mass is 8/(36 +8) = 8/44 ≈ 18.18%. Still higher than 14.28.

Butane: C4H10. H is 10/(48 +10) =10/58 ≈17.24%. Closer, but still higher.

Hexane: C6H14. H is 14/(72 +14)=14/86≈16.28%. Still higher.

Heptane: C7H16. 16/(84 +16)=16/100=16%. Getting closer.

Wait, maybe a larger molecule. Let me compute for C8H18. H is 18/(96+18)=18/114≈15.78%. Closer but still higher than 14.28.

Wait, maybe C12H26? Let's compute: 26/(144 +26)=26/170≈15.29%. Hmm, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is CnH2n. But that's for an alkene, but Z is a product of hydrogenation, so it's fully saturated. So alkanes.

Wait, perhaps the formula is CnH2n+2. Let me try n=1: CH4: H is 4/(12+4)=4/16=25% → 25% H. n=2: C2H6 →6/30=20%. n=3: C3H8 →8/44≈18.18%. n=4: 10/58≈17.24%. Hmm.

Wait, 14.28% is exactly 1/7, because 1/7 is approximately 14.2857%. So 14.28% is 1/7. So the mass of H is 1/7 of the molecular mass.

So, let me set up an equation. Let M be the molecular mass. Then (mass of H) = (1/7) M. The mass of H is m grams per molecule (since M = m + 12n), but wait, the formula is CnHm. The molar mass would be 12n + m.

Mass fraction of H is (m/(12n + m)) = 1/7. Cross-multiplied:

7m = 12n + m  
6m = 12n  
m = 2n.

So, the molecular formula is CnH2n. Wait, but that would be an alkene, right? Because alkenes are CnH2n. But Z is a product of hydrogenation, so it must be a fully saturated (alkane) structure. So that's confusing. Because if Z is CnH2n, that's an alkene, but it's the hydrogenation product, meaning it's more saturated than X and Y. Wait, but the question says Z is a hydrocarbon from hydrogenation, and Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So maybe Z is an alkane, but the initial Y might have had something else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because if Z is the product of hydrogenation, then X and Y must have had double bonds. Let me re-examine.

So, mixture X is two liquids that decolorize bromine water, so they have double bonds. When X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation to form Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine. So Y's components don't have double bonds, perhaps.

Wait, but the problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation to form Y. Disproportionation usually involves a single substance splitting into two, but here X is a mixture of two liquids. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding that part. Wait, the question says: when X is treated with Pt and heated, an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation. Oh, so X is a mixture of two substances that, upon reaction, undergo a disproportionation reaction, producing Y which is a mixture of two other substances.

So, for example, perhaps each component of X undergoes a separate disproportionation, producing two components of Y.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's get back to Z.

Z is the result of hydrogenating both X and Y under severe conditions and yields only one substance. So, whether you hydrogenate X or Y, you get Z.

So hydrogenating X (which has double bonds) would add H2 across the double bonds. Similarly, Y might have more unsaturated bonds, but perhaps not. Wait, Y does not decolorize bromine, so it doesn't have double bonds. Or maybe it has triple bonds? Because alkenes are bromine reactive, but alkynes can also react with bromine? Or maybe Y has no double bonds but maybe some other functional groups.

Wait, but the question says when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation to form Y. So perhaps the reaction is something like a dehydrohalogenation or other type, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says that X is a mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. So each of X's components has double bonds. Then, when they react with Pt under heat, they undergo a disproportionation. For example, perhaps each component of X is a diene or something. Alternatively, maybe each is a di-substituted alkene, which upon reaction with Pt (a catalyst for hydrogenation or dehydrogenation, depending on conditions) undergoes a reaction. Wait, Pt is a catalyst for hydrogenation, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is isomerization or some other process that breaks the compound into different products.

Wait, but the key point is that hydrogenation of X and Y gives the same Z. So, perhaps X and Y have similar structures but different hydrogenation products. But since X's hydrogenation gives Z, and Y's as well, perhaps Y is a hydrogenated form of X, but that's not directly applicable because Y doesn't have double bonds.

Wait, no, because Y doesn't decolorize bromine, which suggests that any double bonds have been hydrogenated. So if X had double bonds and Y doesn't, then hydrogenating X would give Y, but according to the problem, hydrogenation of X gives Z. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the problem says: hydrogenation of both X and Y in the presence of platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z. So when X is hydrogenated, it becomes Z, and when Y is hydrogenated, it also becomes Z. So Z must be the most hydrogenated form, perhaps a fully saturated alkane.

So, let me think about what X and Y could be. X is a mixture of two liquids with double bonds, so perhaps each is an alkene. Y is a mixture of two other liquids without double bonds, perhaps alkanes or maybe even something else.

Wait, but if X's components are alkenes and Y's are alkanes, then hydrogenating X (alkenes) would form alkanes. But Y is already an alkane or similar, so hydrogenating Y would perhaps do nothing, but the problem says both X and Y hydrogenate to Z. That suggests that Y has some unsaturation as well, but not enough to decolorize bromine. Wait, but the problem states that Y does not decolorize bromine. So Y can't have double or triple bonds that react with bromine. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y has rings or something else. Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about Z's molecular formula again.

Earlier, I found that the molecular formula is CnH2n, but that can't be an alkane. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. As I thought earlier, 14.28 is approximately 1/7, so 14.28% is roughly 1/7. So the molecular formula must satisfy (m) / (12n + m) = 1/7, where m is the number of H atoms.

So 7m = 12n + m => 6m = 12n => m = 2n.

So the formula is CnH2n. That's an alkene. But Z is a hydrocarbon resulting from hydrogenation, which would add H2 across double bonds, so Z must be an alkane, which has formula CnH2n+2.

Wait, that's a contradiction because according to the calculation, Z is CnH2n, but that can't be an alkane. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find a compound where (mass of H) is 14.28% of the molecular mass. Let's try possible alkanes.

Take CnH2n+2.

For example:

n=1: CH4 → H is 4/(16) = 25% → 25%.

n=2: C2H6 → 6/30=20%.

n=3: C3H8 →8/44≈18.18%.

n=4: C4H10 →10/58≈17.24%.

n=5: C5H12 →12/68≈17.64%.

n=6: C6H14 →14/86≈16.28%.

n=7: C7H16 →16/100=16%.

n=8: C8H18 →18/(102)≈17.64%.

Wait, none of these give 14.28% H. Hmm. Maybe it's not an alkane.

Alternatively, perhaps Z is a cycloalkane. For example, cyclohexane is C6H12. The H mass fraction is 12/(72 +12)=12/(84)≈14.2857%, which is exactly 14.28% (approximating). Oh! That fits perfectly. So Z is cyclohexane, C6H12.

Wait, but wait—cyclohexane is an alkane, right? Its formula is C6H12, which is the same as 1,3-cyclohexadiene. No, wait, cyclohexane is C6H12 as an alkane, but wait, cyclohexane has the formula C6H12 as a monocyclic compound, but it's a fully saturated molecule with no double bonds. Wait, no, wait. Wait, cycloalkanes have the formula CnH2n. So for n=6, it's C6H12. But cyclohexane is C6H12, and it's an alkane with a ring, so it's fully saturated.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Z is an alkane, but here Z is cyclohexane, which is an alkane. So when X (which has alkenes) is hydrogenated, it becomes cyclohexane. So X must have been a di-substituted cyclohexene or something similar.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If Z is cyclohexane, and when X is hydrogenated, it becomes Z, then X must have had a double bond that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. So perhaps X was cyclohexene. Cyclohexene (C6H10). When hydrogenated, it would add two H's to become cyclohexane (C6H12).

Similarly, Y is a mixture that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. So what might Y be? Y is a mixture that doesn't decolorize bromine, so it doesn't have double bonds. So perhaps Y is a di-substituted cyclohexane derivative, but it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps Y is something else.

Wait, but the problem states that Y is formed from X via a disproportionation reaction when treated with Pt and heat. So X is a mixture of two alkenes that undergo a disproportionation reaction to form Y, which is a mixture of two other compounds that don't have double bonds (so no H2O or similar). So maybe X's components are each a type of diene or something that can undergo isomerization or other reactions to form Y.

Alternatively, maybe X consists of two different alkenes, and during the reaction with Pt, each undergoes a change, perhaps a shift in double bonds, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but perhaps the key is that Z is cyclohexane, so X and Y must be related to cyclohexene and something else. Because when you hydrogenate X (cyclohexene), you get cyclohexane (Z). But what about Y? Y must be something that also upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

Wait, another possibility: if Y is a mixture of two alkenes that are more substituted than those in X, but then that's unclear. Alternatively, Y could be a di-substituted alkene that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe Y is a mixture of two alkanes. But wait, if Y is a mixture of alkanes, hydrogenating them would not change anything because they are already saturated. But the problem says that hydrogenating Y gives Z. So if Y is a mixture of alkanes, hydrogenation wouldn't do anything, which contradicts the problem statement unless Y has some other unsaturated bonds, like triple bonds, which don't react with bromine. Wait, but triple bonds do react with bromine, but maybe not as vigorously as alkenes. Or perhaps Y has something else.

Alternatively, perhaps Y has rings with more unsaturation. Wait, but cyclohexane is already a six-membered ring with single bonds only. So maybe Y contains rings plus other structures.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of two different alkenes, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me try a different approach. Since Z is cyclohexane, which is C6H12, the molecular formula. So when X is hydrogenated, X must have a structure that upon adding H2 becomes C6H12. So X must be an alkene with formula C6H10. Because adding two H's would make it C6H12.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids with double bonds. So perhaps each component is a different diene or a different monoene. For example, maybe X is a mixture of 1-hexene and another compound.

Wait, but cyclohexene is a cyclic monoene. When hydrogenated, it becomes cyclohexane.

So if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another alkene that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane, that doesn't make sense because each would give a different product. But the problem states that hydrogenating X gives only Z. So X must be a mixture of two alkenes, both of which hydrogenate to the same alkane Z.

Hmm, that suggests that each component of X is a different starting material that upon hydrogenation gives the same Z. For example, if X is a mixture of two different alkenes that, when hydrogenated, both yield cyclohexane.

Wait, but alkenes hydrogenate to alkanes. So perhaps the two alkenes in X are such that their hydrogenation leads to the same alkane. For example, if X is a mixture of 1-hexene and another alkene that upon hydrogenation becomes hexane. But wait, hexane is C6H14. But Z is C6H12, which is cyclohexane.

Wait, no, because cyclohexane is C6H12, which is an alkane. So if X is a mixture of two cyclic alkenes, like cyclohexene and something else, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different dienes, but that's getting too vague.

Wait, another angle: the problem states that X is a mixture of two liquids. When treated with Pt and heated, undergoes a disproportionation to form Y, which is a mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine.

But Y, when hydrogenated, also gives Z. So Y must have some unsaturation that upon hydrogenation gives Z. But Y doesn't have any double bonds because it doesn't decolorize bromine. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps Y contains triple bonds. Because triple bonds can react with bromine but under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe Y has aromatic rings, but then hydrogenation would require more vigorous conditions. But the problem says that hydrogenation under severe conditions gives Z, which doesn't react further.

Wait, but if Y has triple bonds, then hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple to form a double bond, but that would give an alkene, which would then decolorize bromine. But the problem says that Y doesn't decolorize bromine. So Y can't have triple bonds either. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y has rings with double bonds, but I don't see how that would work.

Wait, maybe Y has a structure that doesn't have any double bonds but upon hydrogenation gives Z. But if Y doesn't have any double bonds, then hydrogenation wouldn't do anything. So perhaps Y has some other functional groups, like ketones or esters, but that's unlikely because Z is a hydrocarbon.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recap.

From the problem:

- X is a mixture of two liquids with double bonds (decolorize bromine).
- X treated with Pt and heat → Y, which is a mixture of two liquids without double bonds (no decolorization).
- Hydrogenation of X and Y → Z, which is a hydrocarbon, mass fraction H is 14.28% (so Z is cyclohexane, C6H12).
- Z doesn't react further with H2, so it's fully saturated.

So, X must be a mixture of alkenes that, when hydrogenated, give cyclohexane. So each component of X must be a cyclic or acyclic alkene that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. But wait, only one compound can hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So perhaps the two components of X are different alkenes that both hydrogenate to cyclohexane. But that's only possible if X's alkenes are in positions that upon hydrogenation form the same product. For example, 1-cyclohexene and another substituted cyclohexene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of 1-hexene and something else. Wait, 1-hexene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH3. On hydrogenation, it becomes hexane (CH2CH2...), but that's not cyclohexane.

Wait, but Z is cyclohexane. So both components of X must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So perhaps X's components are two different alkenes that, when hydrogenated, form cyclohexane. But how? Let me think.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two different dienes. No, because hydrogenation would add H2 across the double bonds, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the two components of X are cyclohexene and another compound, but when hydrogenated, both give cyclohexane. Wait, but cyclohexene when hydrogenated becomes cyclohexane. What about another compound that also becomes cyclohexane upon hydrogenation? Maybe something like 1,3-cyclohexadiene. But when you hydrogenate that (add H2 across both double bonds), you get cyclohexane. So perhaps X is a mixture of cyclohexene and 1,3-cyclohexadiene.

Wait, but in that case, X would have two different alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation would give cyclohexane. So when you hydrogenate X, both components become cyclohexane, yielding Z.

But then Y would be the products of X's components after the Pt reaction. So when X is treated with Pt and heated, each component undergoes a disproportionation reaction. Wait, but what is the possible disproportionation for each component.

Wait, cyclohexene might not undergo a disproportionation under Pt. Maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps X consists of two different alkenes, each of which when hydrogenated gives cyclohexane. For example, maybe each of X's components is a substituted alkene that, when hydrogenated, forms cyclohexane.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me consider what's being asked: the total number of H atoms in the two liquids of X.

Assuming that each component of X is an alkene that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane (C6H12). So each component in X must have a double bond such that adding H2 gives C6H12.

So, each component in X is an alkene with formula C6H10. Because adding H2 (which adds 2 H atoms) would make it C6H12.

So, if X is a mixture of two C6H10 compounds, each being an alkene, then each has 10 H atoms. So two such molecules would have 20 H atoms. But wait, let me check the options. The options are 16, 18, 22, 12. 20 isn't an option, so maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the two components of X are not both C6H10. Maybe one is C5H10 and another is C7H14, but no, that doesn't make sense because adding H2 would take them to alkanes, but Z is C6H12.

Wait, perhaps the two components of X are C6H10 and another compound that upon hydrogenation becomes C6H12. So for example, perhaps one component is C6H10 (an alkene) and another is C6H8 (a diene), but when both are hydrogenated, they add two H2 molecules each. Wait, no, because that would make them C6H12 and C6H12 + 4 H's, which is impossible. Alternatively, perhaps each adds only two H's, so a diene would add four H's in total. But that would not make sense.

Wait, perhaps the two components of X are each a different mono-alkene that when hydrogenated gives cyclohexane. So both are C6H10. So each molecule has 10 H atoms. So the total H atoms in X would be 10 + 10 =20. But none of the options match this. The options are A)16, B)18, C)22, D)12.

Hmm. This suggests that my approach is flawed. Maybe I should look for another possibility for Z.

Wait, earlier I thought Z was cyclohexane because of the 14.28% H, but maybe I should check for other possibilities.

Another approach: perhaps Z is not cyclohexane but another compound with H mass fraction 14.28%. Let's compute for different possible hydrocarbons.

Looking for (m)/(12n + m) = 1/7.

We have 7m = 12n + m →6m =12n → m=2n.

So formula is CnH2n.

Which is an alkene. So if Z is an alkene, but the problem says Z is a product of hydrogenation, which would imply it's more saturated than X and Y. But X is a mixture of alkenes, which are less saturated than alkanes, but Z is an alkene. That doesn't make sense because hydrogenation adds H2, making it more saturated. So Z can't be an alkene. So perhaps I did the calculation wrong.

Wait, maybe Z is a cycloalkane, which is an alkane but has a ring. So for example, cyclopropane is C3H6. Let me compute its H mass fraction: 6/(36 +6) =6/42=14.2857%. Oh! So Z is cyclopropane, C3H6, which is a cycloalkane. That makes sense because cyclopropane is a three-membered ring, fully saturated, and doesn't have any double bonds, so it won't decolorize bromine.

Wait, but wait. If Z is cyclopropane, then when X is hydrogenated, X must have been a smaller alkene, perhaps propene (propylene), which upon hydrogenation becomes propane. But then Y would have to also lead to propane upon hydrogenation.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the numbers again. For cyclopropane:

H mass fraction is (6)/(36 +6) *100 = 6/42 *100 ≈14.2857%. Yes, that's exactly 14.28%.

So Z is cyclopropane, C3H6.

So when X is hydrogenated, it gives cyclopropane. So X must have been a mono-alkene that upon hydrogenation gives cyclopropane, which would mean X was cyclopropene? Wait, but cyclopropene is C3H4, which is highly strained and unstable. Alternatively, perhaps X was propene (propylene, C3H6), but wait, propylene is C3H6, which is already an alkene. Wait, no, propylene is C3H6, but as an alkene, its formula is C3H6, which is a mono-alkene. Wait, no, propylene is C3H6.

Wait, no. Let me correct. The general formula for an alkene is CnH2n. So for n=3, it's C3H6. So propene is C3H6. So when you hydrogenate it, you add H2, making it C3H8, propane.

But the problem says that hydrogenation of X gives Z, which is C3H6. Hmm, that's the opposite of what I thought. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. If Z is cyclopropane (C3H6) and is the product of hydrogenation, then X must be a di-alkene or a more unsaturated molecule. Because hydrogenation adds H2, making it more saturated.

But wait, if X is a di-alkene, like 1,3-cyclopentadiene, hydrogenation would add two H2 molecules to become cyclopentane. Hmm, but that doesn't fit with Z being C3H6.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each with three carbons. For example, propene (C3H6) and another compound.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

If Z is cyclopropane, C3H6, then the two components of X, when hydrogenated, must each give cyclopropane. So X's components must be alkenes that upon hydrogenation become cyclopropane. But that’s not possible because hydrogenation of alkenes adds H2 to form alkanes. So perhaps X's components are dienes, which upon hydrogenation add two H2 molecules to form cyclopropane. Wait, but dienes hydrogenate to alkanes as well.

Wait, perhaps X's components are cyclopropane derivatives with double bonds. No, that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes that, when hydrogenated, each form cyclopropane. But I can't think of any alkenes that would do that. So maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, maybe I should re-express the molecular formula. If Z is C3H6, then the two components of X must be C3H4 and perhaps another compound. Let me think: C3H4 is an alkyne, which upon hydrogenation would become C3H6. So if X is a mixture of two terminal alkynes, each would hydrogenate to propane (C3H8) or perhaps another structure. Hmm, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different allenes or cumulenes, but that's getting too obscure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of propyne (C3H4) and another alkyne. But when you hydrogenate an alkyne, you get an alkene, then further hydrogenation gives an alkane. So X's hydrogenation would require two steps, which the problem says is done under severe conditions, perhaps adding enough H2 to go all the way to the alkane.

Wait, but Z is C3H6, which is an alkene, but the problem states that Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So if Z is an alkene, it would have reacted more with H2. So that can't be. So perhaps Z is an alkane. So I'm back to the initial conclusion that Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). Because only in that case, the H mass fraction is 14.28%.

So let me go back to Z being cyclohexane. Then, the two components of X must be two alkenes that, when hydrogenated, become cyclohexane. So each must have a double bond arranged such that adding H2 forms cyclohexane.

So each component of X is a cyclohexene derivative. For example, perhaps one is cyclohexene (C6H10) and another is 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). But then, upon hydrogenation, cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane (C6H12), and 1,3-cyclohexadiene would become cyclohexane as well, but wait, 1,3-cyclohexadiene has two double bonds, so hydrogenation would add two H2 molecules, making it C6H12 + 2*(2 H) = C6H16? No, wait, no. Wait, dienes hydrogenate by adding two H2 molecules, each adding two H atoms. So 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) would add two H2 molecules, becoming C6H12. So both components of X would hydrogenate to cyclohexane.

So X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Each upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane (C6H12).

So each component of X is C6H10 and C6H8. So when X is heated with Pt, what happens? It undergoes a disproportionation reaction, forming Y, which is a mixture of two liquids without double bonds, hence no decolorization of bromine.

So what kind of reaction would cause that? Maybe each component of X undergoes a reaction, such as dehydrogenation or isomerization, but under Pt and heat, perhaps they rearrange.

Wait, but cyclohexene and 1,3-cyclohexadiene are both unsaturated. When treated with Pt and heat, perhaps they undergo hydrogenation, but that would produce alkanes, but Y would have no double bonds. So Y would be a mixture of cyclohexane and something else. But the problem says Y is formed by a disproportionation, which is a reaction where a single substance splits into two. But X is a mixture of two liquids, so perhaps each component undergoes a disproportionation. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps during the reaction with Pt, each component of X undergoes a ring-opening or other rearrangement, leading to different products in Y. But I'm not sure.

But regardless, the key point is that the total H in X is from the two components. So if X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), then each molecule in X has 10 and 8 H atoms, respectively. So the total H in X would be 10 +8=18. But wait, each component is present in equimolar amounts because X is an equimolar mixture. So if each component has n moles, the total H is (10n +8n)=18n. So the total number of H atoms in X is 18 per two molecules. Wait, but the question asks for the total number of H atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. So each component contributes H atoms. So if X has two liquids, each liquid is a different compound. So for example, the first liquid is C6H10, the second C6H8.

So in mixture X, each mole of the first contributes 10 H, and each mole of the second contributes 8 H. Since they're equimolar, let's say each has 1 mole. So total H is 10 +8=18.

Looking at the options, option B is 18. So the answer would be B) 18.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X, given the transformations and properties described. Here's the analysis:

1. **Key Information**:
   - Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of double bonds.
   - Upon treatment with platinum and heat, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, meaning Y lacks double bonds.
   - Hydrogenation of both X and Y under severe conditions yields only one substance, Z, which is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen equal to 14.28%. Z does not react further with hydrogen, indicating it is fully saturated.
   - There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X.

2. **Analysis of Z**:
   - The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which corresponds to the molecular formula of cyclohexane, \( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12} \). This is because the hydrogen mass fraction is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{12}{(6 \times 12) + 12} \times 100 = \frac{12}{84} \times 100 \approx 14.28\%.
     \]
   - Cyclohexane is a fully saturated hydrocarbon, confirming that Z is an alkane.

3. **Hydrogenation of X and Y**:
   - Since hydrogenation of X and Y both yield Z, Z must be the fully saturated product of hydrogenation. Therefore, X and Y must contain unsaturated bonds that, when hydrogenated, result in \( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12} \).

4. **Components of X**:
   - X is a mixture of two liquids with double bonds. Based on the hydrogenation product Z (\( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12} \)), the components of X must be alkenes with the formula \( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{10} \) (e.g., cyclohexene) and \( \text{C}_6\text{H}_8 \) (e.g., 1,3-cyclohexadiene). These alkenes hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.

5. **Hydrogen Atoms in X**:
   - Each molecule of \( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{10} \) contains 10 hydrogen atoms, and each molecule of \( \text{C}_6\text{H}_8 \) contains 8 hydrogen atoms.
   - Since X is an equimolar mixture, the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of X is:
     \[
     10 + 8 = 18.
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **18**.

ANSWER: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll take it step by step.

So, the question is about a mixture X that undergoes some reactions and leads to mixture Y, which then forms a hydrocarbon Z. The problem gives some clues about their structures and properties, and I need to find the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. The options are A to D, with numbers 16, 18, 22, 12.

Let me break down the information given.

First, mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Decolorizing bromine water usually means the substance has double bonds, as alkenes or alkynes can react with bromine. Since it's a mixture of two liquids, maybe they're each with unsaturated structures.

When treated with platinum and heated, mixture X undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. The reaction is a disproportionation, which means one substance is both oxidized and reduced. Wait, but wait—decolorizing bromine water might imply they have double bonds. But after treatment with Pt and heat, it becomes Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine. So Y's components must not have double bonds or maybe less unsaturation.

Hydrogenation of both X and Y under severe conditions gives only one substance Z. So hydrogenation of X and Y both yield the same product, Z. Also, Z is a hydrocarbon, with a mass fraction of hydrogen being 14.28%. Hmm, 14.28% is approximately 1/7, because 100/7 is about 14.28. So the molecular formula could give that percentage.

Wait, let me calculate the molecular formula. Let's say the hydrocarbon Z has molecular formula CnHm. The mass of hydrogen is (m/(12n + m)) * 100 = 14.28%. Let's solve for m.

14.28 = (m/(12n + m)) * 100  
0.1428 = m/(12n + m)  
Multiply both sides by denominator:  
0.1428*(12n + m) = m  
1.7136n + 0.1428m = m  
1.7136n = m - 0.1428m  
1.7136n = 0.8572m  
n/m = 0.8572 / 1.7136 ≈ 0.5. So n is about half of m.

Wait, let me check that again. Let me compute 0.8572 / 1.7136:

0.8572 ÷ 1.7136 ≈ 0.5. So n ≈ m/2.

So, for each carbon, there are about two hydrogens. That seems like a highly saturated molecule, maybe ethane or something similar. Alternatively, maybe a larger alkane.

Wait, but wait, for ethane, C2H6, the hydrogen mass fraction is (6)/(24 +6)*100 = 6/30 *100 = 20%. But we have 14.28%, which is lower. So ethane's 20% is higher than 14.28%. Hmm.

Wait, propane is C3H8. H mass is 8/(36 +8) = 8/44 ≈ 18.18%. Still higher than 14.28.

Butane: C4H10. H is 10/(48 +10) =10/58 ≈17.24%. Closer, but still higher.

Hexane: C6H14. H is 14/(72 +14)=14/86≈16.28%. Still higher.

Heptane: C7H16. 16/(84 +16)=16/100=16%. Getting closer.

Wait, maybe a larger molecule. Let me compute for C8H18. H is 18/(96+18)=18/114≈15.78%. Closer but still higher than 14.28.

Wait, maybe C12H26? Let's compute: 26/(144 +26)=26/170≈15.29%. Hmm, no.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is CnH2n. But that's for an alkene, but Z is a product of hydrogenation, so it's fully saturated. So alkanes.

Wait, perhaps the formula is CnH2n+2. Let me try n=1: CH4: H is 4/(12+4)=4/16=25% → 25% H. n=2: C2H6 →6/30=20%. n=3: C3H8 →8/44≈18.18%. n=4: 10/58≈17.24%. Hmm.

Wait, 14.28% is exactly 1/7, because 1/7 is approximately 14.2857%. So 14.28% is 1/7. So the mass of H is 1/7 of the molecular mass.

So, let me set up an equation. Let M be the molecular mass. Then (mass of H) = (1/7) M. The mass of H is m grams per molecule (since M = m + 12n), but wait, the formula is CnHm. The molar mass would be 12n + m.

Mass fraction of H is (m/(12n + m)) = 1/7. Cross-multiplied:

7m = 12n + m  
6m = 12n  
m = 2n.

So, the molecular formula is CnH2n. Wait, but that would be an alkene, right? Because alkenes are CnH2n. But Z is a product of hydrogenation, so it must be a fully saturated (alkane) structure. So that's confusing. Because if Z is CnH2n, that's an alkene, but it's the hydrogenation product, meaning it's more saturated than X and Y. Wait, but the question says Z is a hydrocarbon from hydrogenation, and Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So maybe Z is an alkane, but the initial Y might have had something else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because if Z is the product of hydrogenation, then X and Y must have had double bonds. Let me re-examine.

So, mixture X is two liquids that decolorize bromine water, so they have double bonds. When X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation to form Y, which doesn't decolorize bromine. So Y's components don't have double bonds, perhaps.

Wait, but the problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation to form Y. Disproportionation usually involves a single substance splitting into two, but here X is a mixture of two liquids. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding that part. Wait, the question says: when X is treated with Pt and heated, an equimolar mixture Y of two other liquids is formed as a result of disproportionation. Oh, so X is a mixture of two substances that, upon reaction, undergo a disproportionation reaction, producing Y which is a mixture of two other substances.

So, for example, perhaps each component of X undergoes a separate disproportionation, producing two components of Y.

But maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's get back to Z.

Z is the result of hydrogenating both X and Y under severe conditions and yields only one substance. So, whether you hydrogenate X or Y, you get Z.

So hydrogenating X (which has double bonds) would add H2 across the double bonds. Similarly, Y might have more unsaturated bonds, but perhaps not. Wait, Y does not decolorize bromine, so it doesn't have double bonds. Or maybe it has triple bonds? Because alkenes are bromine reactive, but alkynes can also react with bromine? Or maybe Y has no double bonds but maybe some other functional groups.

Wait, but the question says when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation to form Y. So perhaps the reaction is something like a dehydrohalogenation or other type, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the problem says that X is a mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water. So each of X's components has double bonds. Then, when they react with Pt under heat, they undergo a disproportionation. For example, perhaps each component of X is a diene or something. Alternatively, maybe each is a di-substituted alkene, which upon reaction with Pt (a catalyst for hydrogenation or dehydrogenation, depending on conditions) undergoes a reaction. Wait, Pt is a catalyst for hydrogenation, but I'm not sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is isomerization or some other process that breaks the compound into different products.

Wait, but the key point is that hydrogenation of X and Y gives the same Z. So, perhaps X and Y have similar structures but different hydrogenation products. But since X's hydrogenation gives Z, and Y's as well, perhaps Y is a hydrogenated form of X, but that's not directly applicable because Y doesn't have double bonds.

Wait, no, because Y doesn't decolorize bromine, which suggests that any double bonds have been hydrogenated. So if X had double bonds and Y doesn't, then hydrogenating X would give Y, but according to the problem, hydrogenation of X gives Z. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, the problem says: hydrogenation of both X and Y in the presence of platinum under severe conditions gives only one substance, Z. So when X is hydrogenated, it becomes Z, and when Y is hydrogenated, it also becomes Z. So Z must be the most hydrogenated form, perhaps a fully saturated alkane.

So, let me think about what X and Y could be. X is a mixture of two liquids with double bonds, so perhaps each is an alkene. Y is a mixture of two other liquids without double bonds, perhaps alkanes or maybe even something else.

Wait, but if X's components are alkenes and Y's are alkanes, then hydrogenating X (alkenes) would form alkanes. But Y is already an alkane or similar, so hydrogenating Y would perhaps do nothing, but the problem says both X and Y hydrogenate to Z. That suggests that Y has some unsaturation as well, but not enough to decolorize bromine. Wait, but the problem states that Y does not decolorize bromine. So Y can't have double or triple bonds that react with bromine. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe Y has rings or something else. Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about Z's molecular formula again.

Earlier, I found that the molecular formula is CnH2n, but that can't be an alkane. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, the mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%. As I thought earlier, 14.28 is approximately 1/7, so 14.28% is roughly 1/7. So the molecular formula must satisfy (m) / (12n + m) = 1/7, where m is the number of H atoms.

So 7m = 12n + m => 6m = 12n => m = 2n.

So the formula is CnH2n. That's an alkene. But Z is a hydrocarbon resulting from hydrogenation, which would add H2 across double bonds, so Z must be an alkane, which has formula CnH2n+2.

Wait, that's a contradiction because according to the calculation, Z is CnH2n, but that can't be an alkane. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should find a compound where (mass of H) is 14.28% of the molecular mass. Let's try possible alkanes.

Take CnH2n+2.

For example:

n=1: CH4 → H is 4/(16) = 25% → 25%.

n=2: C2H6 → 6/30=20%.

n=3: C3H8 →8/44≈18.18%.

n=4: C4H10 →10/58≈17.24%.

n=5: C5H12 →12/68≈17.64%.

n=6: C6H14 →14/86≈16.28%.

n=7: C7H16 →16/100=16%.

n=8: C8H18 →18/(102)≈17.64%.

Wait, none of these give 14.28% H. Hmm. Maybe it's not an alkane.

Alternatively, perhaps Z is a cycloalkane. For example, cyclohexane is C6H12. The H mass fraction is 12/(72 +12)=12/(84)≈14.2857%, which is exactly 14.28% (approximating). Oh! That fits perfectly. So Z is cyclohexane, C6H12.

Wait, but wait—cyclohexane is an alkane, right? Its formula is C6H12, which is the same as 1,3-cyclohexadiene. No, wait, cyclohexane is C6H12 as an alkane, but wait, cyclohexane has the formula C6H12 as a monocyclic compound, but it's a fully saturated molecule with no double bonds. Wait, no, wait. Wait, cycloalkanes have the formula CnH2n. So for n=6, it's C6H12. But cyclohexane is C6H12, and it's an alkane with a ring, so it's fully saturated.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Z is an alkane, but here Z is cyclohexane, which is an alkane. So when X (which has alkenes) is hydrogenated, it becomes cyclohexane. So X must have been a di-substituted cyclohexene or something similar.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If Z is cyclohexane, and when X is hydrogenated, it becomes Z, then X must have had a double bond that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane. So perhaps X was cyclohexene. Cyclohexene (C6H10). When hydrogenated, it would add two H's to become cyclohexane (C6H12).

Similarly, Y is a mixture that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. So what might Y be? Y is a mixture that doesn't decolorize bromine, so it doesn't have double bonds. So perhaps Y is a di-substituted cyclohexane derivative, but it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps Y is something else.

Wait, but the problem states that Y is formed from X via a disproportionation reaction when treated with Pt and heat. So X is a mixture of two alkenes that undergo a disproportionation reaction to form Y, which is a mixture of two other compounds that don't have double bonds (so no H2O or similar). So maybe X's components are each a type of diene or something that can undergo isomerization or other reactions to form Y.

Alternatively, maybe X consists of two different alkenes, and during the reaction with Pt, each undergoes a change, perhaps a shift in double bonds, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but perhaps the key is that Z is cyclohexane, so X and Y must be related to cyclohexene and something else. Because when you hydrogenate X (cyclohexene), you get cyclohexane (Z). But what about Y? Y must be something that also upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane.

Wait, another possibility: if Y is a mixture of two alkenes that are more substituted than those in X, but then that's unclear. Alternatively, Y could be a di-substituted alkene that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe Y is a mixture of two alkanes. But wait, if Y is a mixture of alkanes, hydrogenating them would not change anything because they are already saturated. But the problem says that hydrogenating Y gives Z. So if Y is a mixture of alkanes, hydrogenation wouldn't do anything, which contradicts the problem statement unless Y has some other unsaturated bonds, like triple bonds, which don't react with bromine. Wait, but triple bonds do react with bromine, but maybe not as vigorously as alkenes. Or perhaps Y has something else.

Alternatively, perhaps Y has rings with more unsaturation. Wait, but cyclohexane is already a six-membered ring with single bonds only. So maybe Y contains rings plus other structures.

Alternatively, perhaps Y is a mixture of two different alkenes, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Let me try a different approach. Since Z is cyclohexane, which is C6H12, the molecular formula. So when X is hydrogenated, X must have a structure that upon adding H2 becomes C6H12. So X must be an alkene with formula C6H10. Because adding two H's would make it C6H12.

Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids with double bonds. So perhaps each component is a different diene or a different monoene. For example, maybe X is a mixture of 1-hexene and another compound.

Wait, but cyclohexene is a cyclic monoene. When hydrogenated, it becomes cyclohexane.

So if X is a mixture of cyclohexene and another alkene that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane, that doesn't make sense because each would give a different product. But the problem states that hydrogenating X gives only Z. So X must be a mixture of two alkenes, both of which hydrogenate to the same alkane Z.

Hmm, that suggests that each component of X is a different starting material that upon hydrogenation gives the same Z. For example, if X is a mixture of two different alkenes that, when hydrogenated, both yield cyclohexane.

Wait, but alkenes hydrogenate to alkanes. So perhaps the two alkenes in X are such that their hydrogenation leads to the same alkane. For example, if X is a mixture of 1-hexene and another alkene that upon hydrogenation becomes hexane. But wait, hexane is C6H14. But Z is C6H12, which is cyclohexane.

Wait, no, because cyclohexane is C6H12, which is an alkane. So if X is a mixture of two cyclic alkenes, like cyclohexene and something else, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different dienes, but that's getting too vague.

Wait, another angle: the problem states that X is a mixture of two liquids. When treated with Pt and heated, undergoes a disproportionation to form Y, which is a mixture of two liquids that do not decolorize bromine.

But Y, when hydrogenated, also gives Z. So Y must have some unsaturation that upon hydrogenation gives Z. But Y doesn't have any double bonds because it doesn't decolorize bromine. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps Y contains triple bonds. Because triple bonds can react with bromine but under certain conditions. Alternatively, maybe Y has aromatic rings, but then hydrogenation would require more vigorous conditions. But the problem says that hydrogenation under severe conditions gives Z, which doesn't react further.

Wait, but if Y has triple bonds, then hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple to form a double bond, but that would give an alkene, which would then decolorize bromine. But the problem says that Y doesn't decolorize bromine. So Y can't have triple bonds either. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps Y has rings with double bonds, but I don't see how that would work.

Wait, maybe Y has a structure that doesn't have any double bonds but upon hydrogenation gives Z. But if Y doesn't have any double bonds, then hydrogenation wouldn't do anything. So perhaps Y has some other functional groups, like ketones or esters, but that's unlikely because Z is a hydrocarbon.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recap.

From the problem:

- X is a mixture of two liquids with double bonds (decolorize bromine).
- X treated with Pt and heat → Y, which is a mixture of two liquids without double bonds (no decolorization).
- Hydrogenation of X and Y → Z, which is a hydrocarbon, mass fraction H is 14.28% (so Z is cyclohexane, C6H12).
- Z doesn't react further with H2, so it's fully saturated.

So, X must be a mixture of alkenes that, when hydrogenated, give cyclohexane. So each component of X must be a cyclic or acyclic alkene that upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane. But wait, only one compound can hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So perhaps the two components of X are different alkenes that both hydrogenate to cyclohexane. But that's only possible if X's alkenes are in positions that upon hydrogenation form the same product. For example, 1-cyclohexene and another substituted cyclohexene, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of 1-hexene and something else. Wait, 1-hexene is CH2=CHCH2CH2CH2CH3. On hydrogenation, it becomes hexane (CH2CH2...), but that's not cyclohexane.

Wait, but Z is cyclohexane. So both components of X must hydrogenate to cyclohexane. So perhaps X's components are two different alkenes that, when hydrogenated, form cyclohexane. But how? Let me think.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two different dienes. No, because hydrogenation would add H2 across the double bonds, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the two components of X are cyclohexene and another compound, but when hydrogenated, both give cyclohexane. Wait, but cyclohexene when hydrogenated becomes cyclohexane. What about another compound that also becomes cyclohexane upon hydrogenation? Maybe something like 1,3-cyclohexadiene. But when you hydrogenate that (add H2 across both double bonds), you get cyclohexane. So perhaps X is a mixture of cyclohexene and 1,3-cyclohexadiene.

Wait, but in that case, X would have two different alkenes, each of which upon hydrogenation would give cyclohexane. So when you hydrogenate X, both components become cyclohexane, yielding Z.

But then Y would be the products of X's components after the Pt reaction. So when X is treated with Pt and heated, each component undergoes a disproportionation reaction. Wait, but what is the possible disproportionation for each component.

Wait, cyclohexene might not undergo a disproportionation under Pt. Maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Alternatively, perhaps X consists of two different alkenes, each of which when hydrogenated gives cyclohexane. For example, maybe each of X's components is a substituted alkene that, when hydrogenated, forms cyclohexane.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me consider what's being asked: the total number of H atoms in the two liquids of X.

Assuming that each component of X is an alkene that upon hydrogenation becomes cyclohexane (C6H12). So each component in X must have a double bond such that adding H2 gives C6H12.

So, each component in X is an alkene with formula C6H10. Because adding H2 (which adds 2 H atoms) would make it C6H12.

So, if X is a mixture of two C6H10 compounds, each being an alkene, then each has 10 H atoms. So two such molecules would have 20 H atoms. But wait, let me check the options. The options are 16, 18, 22, 12. 20 isn't an option, so maybe I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the two components of X are not both C6H10. Maybe one is C5H10 and another is C7H14, but no, that doesn't make sense because adding H2 would take them to alkanes, but Z is C6H12.

Wait, perhaps the two components of X are C6H10 and another compound that upon hydrogenation becomes C6H12. So for example, perhaps one component is C6H10 (an alkene) and another is C6H8 (a diene), but when both are hydrogenated, they add two H2 molecules each. Wait, no, because that would make them C6H12 and C6H12 + 4 H's, which is impossible. Alternatively, perhaps each adds only two H's, so a diene would add four H's in total. But that would not make sense.

Wait, perhaps the two components of X are each a different mono-alkene that when hydrogenated gives cyclohexane. So both are C6H10. So each molecule has 10 H atoms. So the total H atoms in X would be 10 + 10 =20. But none of the options match this. The options are A)16, B)18, C)22, D)12.

Hmm. This suggests that my approach is flawed. Maybe I should look for another possibility for Z.

Wait, earlier I thought Z was cyclohexane because of the 14.28% H, but maybe I should check for other possibilities.

Another approach: perhaps Z is not cyclohexane but another compound with H mass fraction 14.28%. Let's compute for different possible hydrocarbons.

Looking for (m)/(12n + m) = 1/7.

We have 7m = 12n + m →6m =12n → m=2n.

So formula is CnH2n.

Which is an alkene. So if Z is an alkene, but the problem says Z is a product of hydrogenation, which would imply it's more saturated than X and Y. But X is a mixture of alkenes, which are less saturated than alkanes, but Z is an alkene. That doesn't make sense because hydrogenation adds H2, making it more saturated. So Z can't be an alkene. So perhaps I did the calculation wrong.

Wait, maybe Z is a cycloalkane, which is an alkane but has a ring. So for example, cyclopropane is C3H6. Let me compute its H mass fraction: 6/(36 +6) =6/42=14.2857%. Oh! So Z is cyclopropane, C3H6, which is a cycloalkane. That makes sense because cyclopropane is a three-membered ring, fully saturated, and doesn't have any double bonds, so it won't decolorize bromine.

Wait, but wait. If Z is cyclopropane, then when X is hydrogenated, X must have been a smaller alkene, perhaps propene (propylene), which upon hydrogenation becomes propane. But then Y would have to also lead to propane upon hydrogenation.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the numbers again. For cyclopropane:

H mass fraction is (6)/(36 +6) *100 = 6/42 *100 ≈14.2857%. Yes, that's exactly 14.28%.

So Z is cyclopropane, C3H6.

So when X is hydrogenated, it gives cyclopropane. So X must have been a mono-alkene that upon hydrogenation gives cyclopropane, which would mean X was cyclopropene? Wait, but cyclopropene is C3H4, which is highly strained and unstable. Alternatively, perhaps X was propene (propylene, C3H6), but wait, propylene is C3H6, which is already an alkene. Wait, no, propylene is C3H6, but as an alkene, its formula is C3H6, which is a mono-alkene. Wait, no, propylene is C3H6.

Wait, no. Let me correct. The general formula for an alkene is CnH2n. So for n=3, it's C3H6. So propene is C3H6. So when you hydrogenate it, you add H2, making it C3H8, propane.

But the problem says that hydrogenation of X gives Z, which is C3H6. Hmm, that's the opposite of what I thought. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. If Z is cyclopropane (C3H6) and is the product of hydrogenation, then X must be a di-alkene or a more unsaturated molecule. Because hydrogenation adds H2, making it more saturated.

But wait, if X is a di-alkene, like 1,3-cyclopentadiene, hydrogenation would add two H2 molecules to become cyclopentane. Hmm, but that doesn't fit with Z being C3H6.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each with three carbons. For example, propene (C3H6) and another compound.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

If Z is cyclopropane, C3H6, then the two components of X, when hydrogenated, must each give cyclopropane. So X's components must be alkenes that upon hydrogenation become cyclopropane. But that’s not possible because hydrogenation of alkenes adds H2 to form alkanes. So perhaps X's components are dienes, which upon hydrogenation add two H2 molecules to form cyclopropane. Wait, but dienes hydrogenate to alkanes as well.

Wait, perhaps X's components are cyclopropane derivatives with double bonds. No, that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different alkenes that, when hydrogenated, each form cyclopropane. But I can't think of any alkenes that would do that. So maybe I'm on the wrong track.

Wait, maybe I should re-express the molecular formula. If Z is C3H6, then the two components of X must be C3H4 and perhaps another compound. Let me think: C3H4 is an alkyne, which upon hydrogenation would become C3H6. So if X is a mixture of two terminal alkynes, each would hydrogenate to propane (C3H8) or perhaps another structure. Hmm, but that doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of two different allenes or cumulenes, but that's getting too obscure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a mixture of propyne (C3H4) and another alkyne. But when you hydrogenate an alkyne, you get an alkene, then further hydrogenation gives an alkane. So X's hydrogenation would require two steps, which the problem says is done under severe conditions, perhaps adding enough H2 to go all the way to the alkane.

Wait, but Z is C3H6, which is an alkene, but the problem states that Z doesn't react further with hydrogen. So if Z is an alkene, it would have reacted more with H2. So that can't be. So perhaps Z is an alkane. So I'm back to the initial conclusion that Z is cyclohexane (C6H12). Because only in that case, the H mass fraction is 14.28%.

So let me go back to Z being cyclohexane. Then, the two components of X must be two alkenes that, when hydrogenated, become cyclohexane. So each must have a double bond arranged such that adding H2 forms cyclohexane.

So each component of X is a cyclohexene derivative. For example, perhaps one is cyclohexene (C6H10) and another is 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). But then, upon hydrogenation, cyclohexene becomes cyclohexane (C6H12), and 1,3-cyclohexadiene would become cyclohexane as well, but wait, 1,3-cyclohexadiene has two double bonds, so hydrogenation would add two H2 molecules, making it C6H12 + 2*(2 H) = C6H16? No, wait, no. Wait, dienes hydrogenate by adding two H2 molecules, each adding two H atoms. So 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8) would add two H2 molecules, becoming C6H12. So both components of X would hydrogenate to cyclohexane.

So X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8). Each upon hydrogenation gives cyclohexane (C6H12).

So each component of X is C6H10 and C6H8. So when X is heated with Pt, what happens? It undergoes a disproportionation reaction, forming Y, which is a mixture of two liquids without double bonds, hence no decolorization of bromine.

So what kind of reaction would cause that? Maybe each component of X undergoes a reaction, such as dehydrogenation or isomerization, but under Pt and heat, perhaps they rearrange.

Wait, but cyclohexene and 1,3-cyclohexadiene are both unsaturated. When treated with Pt and heat, perhaps they undergo hydrogenation, but that would produce alkanes, but Y would have no double bonds. So Y would be a mixture of cyclohexane and something else. But the problem says Y is formed by a disproportionation, which is a reaction where a single substance splits into two. But X is a mixture of two liquids, so perhaps each component undergoes a disproportionation. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps during the reaction with Pt, each component of X undergoes a ring-opening or other rearrangement, leading to different products in Y. But I'm not sure.

But regardless, the key point is that the total H in X is from the two components. So if X is a mixture of cyclohexene (C6H10) and 1,3-cyclohexadiene (C6H8), then each molecule in X has 10 and 8 H atoms, respectively. So the total H in X would be 10 +8=18. But wait, each component is present in equimolar amounts because X is an equimolar mixture. So if each component has n moles, the total H is (10n +8n)=18n. So the total number of H atoms in X is 18 per two molecules. Wait, but the question asks for the total number of H atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. So each component contributes H atoms. So if X has two liquids, each liquid is a different compound. So for example, the first liquid is C6H10, the second C6H8.

So in mixture X, each mole of the first contributes 10 H, and each mole of the second contributes 8 H. Since they're equimolar, let's say each has 1 mole. So total H is 10 +8=18.

Looking at the options, option B is 18. So the answer would be B) 18.


The problem involves determining the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X, given the transformations and properties described. Here's the analysis:

1. **Key Information**:
   - Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of double bonds.
   - Upon treatment with platinum and heat, X undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, meaning Y lacks double bonds.
   - Hydrogenation of both X and Y under severe conditions yields only one substance, Z, which is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen equal to 14.28%. Z does not react further with hydrogen, indicating it is fully saturated.
   - There are no conjugated multiple bonds in the compounds of mixture X.

2. **Analysis of Z**:
   - The mass fraction of hydrogen in Z is 14.28%, which corresponds to the molecular formula of cyclohexane, \( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12} \). This is because the hydrogen mass fraction is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{12}{(6 \times 12) + 12} \times 100 = \frac{12}{84} \times 100 \approx 14.28\%.
     \]
   - Cyclohexane is a fully saturated hydrocarbon, confirming that Z is an alkane.

3. **Hydrogenation of X and Y**:
   - Since hydrogenation of X and Y both yield Z, Z must be the fully saturated product of hydrogenation. Therefore, X and Y must contain unsaturated bonds that, when hydrogenated, result in \( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12} \).

4. **Components of X**:
   - X is a mixture of two liquids with double bonds. Based on the hydrogenation product Z (\( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{12} \)), the components of X must be alkenes with the formula \( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{10} \) (e.g., cyclohexene) and \( \text{C}_6\text{H}_8 \) (e.g., 1,3-cyclohexadiene). These alkenes hydrogenate to form cyclohexane.

5. **Hydrogen Atoms in X**:
   - Each molecule of \( \text{C}_6\text{H}_{10} \) contains 10 hydrogen atoms, and each molecule of \( \text{C}_6\text{H}_8 \) contains 8 hydrogen atoms.
   - Since X is an equimolar mixture, the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of X is:
     \[
     10 + 8 = 18.
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X is **18**.
