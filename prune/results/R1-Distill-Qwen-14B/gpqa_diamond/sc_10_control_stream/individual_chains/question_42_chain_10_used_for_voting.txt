Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, Planet3) with circular orbits discovered via the TTV method. The TTV method stands for transit timing variations, I think. That's a method used to detect planets by observing the variations in the timing of a planet's transit as it passes in front of its star. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here; maybe it's just background info.

The problem gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 are approximately a ratio of 1.4. And between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. So, Planet3 is much hotter than Planet2, which is hotter than Planet1.

Then, the mass ratios: Planet1 and Planet2 have a mass ratio of about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So, Planet3 is heavier than Planet2, which is heavier than Planet1. Wait, no. Wait, the ratio is mass of Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, so Planet1 is heavier than Planet2. Then, Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35, meaning Planet2 is heavier than Planet3? Wait, no. Because if the mass ratio is M2/M3 = 1.35, then M2 is 1.35 times M3, so M3 is less than M2. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Mass ratio Planet1:Planet2 is 1.15, meaning M1/M2=1.15. So, M1 = 1.15 * M2. So Planet1 is more massive than Planet2. Then, Planet2:Planet3 is 1.35, so M2/M3=1.35. That means M2 = 1.35 * M3. So, M3 = M2 / 1.35. So Planet3 is less massive than Planet2. So the masses go M1 > M2 > M3.

But wait, the question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. So, I need to find P3/P1. 

The problem gives the albedo for all three planets as 0.3, similar to Earth. Albedo is the reflectivity—so this is the same for all, which probably affects the equilibrium temperature.

The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. So, I need to find P3 / P1.

Hmm. So, how to approach this. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

Te = [(L(1 - a))/(16 π σ D²)]^(1/4)

Where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's albedo, D is the distance from the star, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But wait, I think that's the formula. Alternatively, sometimes the formula is written as Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)) * (1 - a)^(1/4), where T_star is the star's effective temperature and R_star its radius. But perhaps it's the first version using L.

Alternatively, when considering the inverse square law, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star. Because the flux is L/(4πD²), so the equilibrium temperature would depend on that.

But wait, in the problem, all three planets have the same star, right? So L is the same for all. And albedo a is 0.3 for all. So, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures can be related to the square root of the inverse of the distances.

Because Te is proportional to (L/(D² * (1 - a)))^(1/4). Since L and a are the same, Te ∝ 1/(D^0.5). Alternatively, Te^4 is proportional to L/(D² (1 - a)), so Te^4 ∝ 1/D². So, Te ∝ 1/sqrt(D).

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me write the formula properly. The equilibrium temperature formula is:

Te = ( (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²) )^(1/4 )

So, for each planet, Te is proportional to sqrt( (1 - a) / D² ), but since (1 - a) is same for all, Te is proportional to 1/(D^0.5).

Wait, no. Let me do the math. Let's say Te1 and Te2 are the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2. Then:

Te1 / Te2 = [ ( (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D1²) )^(1/4) ] / [ same for D2 ]

So, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( sqrt( (D2) / (D1) ) )

Wait, more accurately, since (Te1^4) / (Te2^4) = (D2²) / (D1²) * (1 - a same). So,

Te1^4 / Te2^4 = (D2^2) / (D1^2)

Then, taking the square root twice (since it's 1/4 power), Te1/Te2 = (D2/D1)^(1/2) / (D1/D2)^(1/2)? Wait, maybe I should take logs.

Alternatively, let's take the ratio of Te1 and Te2.

Te1/Te2 = [ (1/(D1)) / (1/(D2)) ]^(1/4) * sqrt( (1 - a1)/(1 - a2) ) )

But since a is the same for all, (1 - a) is same, so the ratio becomes:

Te1/Te2 = (D2/D1)^(1/4) ?

Wait, let me try this again. Let me write the ratio of Te1 over Te2:

Te1/Te2 = [ (L/(16πσ D1²) (1 - a)) / (L/(16πσ D2²) (1 - a)) ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify:

Te1/Te2 = [ (D2² / D1²) ]^(1/4 ) )

= (D2/D1)^(1/2)

So, Te1/Te2 = sqrt(D2/D1)

Similarly, Te2/Te3 = sqrt(D3/D2)

Wait, but the problem gives the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 as 1.4. So, Te1/Te2 = 1.4.

So,

sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4

Squaring both sides,

D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96

So, D2 = 1.96 * D1

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So, Te2/Te3 = 2.3.

So,

sqrt(D3/D2) = 2.3

Squaring,

D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29

So, D3 = 5.29 * D2

But D2 = 1.96 D1,

So D3 = 5.29 * 1.96 D1 ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ let's calculate that.

5.29 * 2 is 10.58, minus 5.29 * 0.04 (since 1.96 is 2 -0.04), so 5.29 *0.04=0.2116. So 10.58 - 0.2116≈10.3684. So D3≈10.3684 D1.

So the distance of planet3 is about 10.37 times that of planet1.

But wait, the question is about the orbital period. So, how do we relate orbital period to distance?

I remember Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star) divided by the mass of the star. But wait, more accurately, the formula is:

P^2 = (4 π² / (G M)) ) * a^3

Where M is the mass of the star, a is the semi-major axis (distance), G is the gravitational constant, and P is the period.

But in this problem, we have three planets orbiting the same star, so M is the same for all. So, for each planet, P^2 is proportional to a^3.

So, P1^2 ∝ a1^3

P2^2 ∝ a2^3

P3^2 ∝ a3^3

So, the ratio of P3 to P1 would be:

(P3/P1)^2 = (a3/a1)^3

So, P3/P1 = sqrt( (a3/a1)^3 )

But wait, in our case, a3 is the distance D3, and a1 is D1.

So,

a3 = 10.3684 D1

Therefore, (a3/a1)^3 = (10.3684)^3 ≈ let's compute that.

10^3 is 1000. 0.3684 is approximately 0.3684.

(10.3684)^3 = (10 + 0.3684)^3.

Using binomial expansion:

≈10^3 + 3*(10^2)*0.3684 + 3*(10)*(0.3684)^2 + (0.3684)^3

10^3 =1000

3*100 *0.3684= 300 * 0.3684=110.52

3*10*(0.3684^2)=30*(0.1356)=4.068

0.3684^3≈0.0499 ≈0.05

Adding up: 1000 +110.52=1110.52 +4.068=1114.588 +0.05≈1114.638.

So, approximately 1114.64.

So, (a3/a1)^3 ≈ 1114.64.

Then, (P3/P1)^2 = 1114.64 → P3/P1 = sqrt(1114.64) ≈ 33.38.

So, approximately 33.4.

Wait, but looking back, I think the calculation might have gone wrong somewhere. Because the answer options include option D) ~33.4.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the initial approach. Because the problem gives the mass ratios of the planets, but in Kepler's third law, the mass of the star is in the denominator. Unless the planets' masses are significant compared to the star, but in most cases, the star's mass is much larger, so the planet masses can be neglected. So, I think the mass ratios given in the problem (between the planets) may not directly affect the calculation of the orbital period, as the star's mass is the dominant factor.

Wait, wait, no. The Kepler's third law as applied to planets is:

P^2 = (4 π² G M_star)^(-1) * a^3

But if M_p (planet mass) is considered, it's only when the planet's mass is significant compared to the star. But in reality, the star's mass M is much larger than the planet's, so the planet's mass doesn't affect the orbital period much. So, the period mainly depends on the semi-major axis and the star's mass.

But in this problem, I don't know the mass of the star. But since all planets orbit the same star, M is the same for all three. So, the mass ratios between the planets (M1/M2 and M2/M3) don't directly affect the calculation of the orbital period. So, perhaps the given mass ratios are a red herring, or maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, but wait. The problem gives the mass ratios between the planets, but without knowing the star's mass, perhaps that information isn't necessary. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the Hill sphere or something else, but I don't think so. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the TTV method (transit timing variations) detects planets by their gravitational influence on each other. So, the mass of the planets would affect the TTVs, but in this problem, we're being asked about the orbital periods, which are determined by the semi-major axis and the star's mass, not the planet's mass. So, perhaps the given mass ratios are not needed for this particular question.

So, in that case, the mass ratios don't affect the calculation of P3/P1, which depends only on the distance ratios.

Wait, but the question gives the mass ratios. So, perhaps I'm supposed to use them for something else. Let me re-examine the question.

The problem states that the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 are 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 are 2.3. The mass ratios are 1.15 (Planet1/Planet2) and 1.35 (Planet2/Planet3). Albedo is 0.3 for all.

The question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relationship between orbital period, mass, and equilibrium temperature. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: equilibrium temperature is given by Te = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4)

But the problem gives the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, so Te1/Te2 = 1.4.

So, as I did before, D2/D1 = (Te1/Te2)^2 = 1.96 → D2 = 1.96 D1.

Similarly, Te2/Te3 = 2.3 → D3 = D2 * (Te2/Te3)^2 = D2 * (2.3)^2 = D2 *5.29.

So, D3 =5.29 * D2, which is 5.29 * 1.96 D1 ≈ 10.368 D1.

So, D3/D1 ≈10.368.

Then, using Kepler's third law, P^2 ∝ D^3 (since M is same for all), so P3/P1 = sqrt( (D3/D1)^3 )

So, (D3/D1)^3 = (10.368)^3≈1114.6.

So, sqrt(1114.6) ≈33.38 → approximately 33.4.

So, the answer would be option D, ~33.4.

Wait, but why is the mass ratio given? Because if the question was about, say, the Hill sphere radius or something else, the planet's mass would matter. But for orbital period, given the same star, planet mass doesn't come into play. So, the mass ratio information seems irrelevant here. But the question gives it, so perhaps I missed something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equilibrium temperature formula. Let me recheck that.

Equilibrium temperature formula is:

Te = [ (L (1 - a) )/(16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4)

Yes, that's correct. So, the ratio of Te1/Te2 is (D2/D1)^(1/2), as derived earlier. So, the distances are correct as D2=1.96 D1, D3=10.368 D1.

So, the period ratio is P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.368)^(1.5) = sqrt( (10.368)^3 )

Which is what I calculated as ~33.4.

So, the answer should be option D, ~33.4.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~10.4

B) ~3.2

C) ~4.4

D) ~33.4

So, D is correct.

But why are the mass ratios given? Maybe it's a distractor, or perhaps another approach requires them. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the mass of the planets when calculating the equilibrium temperature. But equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, distance, and albedo. So, the planet's mass shouldn't affect the equilibrium temperature. Unless perhaps if the planet has a different thermal inertia, but the problem says equilibrium temperature, which is a steady-state calculation and doesn't depend on mass.

So, the mass ratios are given but not needed for this problem.

So, the correct answer is D) ~33.4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the problem using the given data and relevant physical principles.

### Key Information:
1. **Equilibrium Temperature Ratios**:
   - The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4:  
     \[
     \frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = 1.4
     \]
   - The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3:  
     \[
     \frac{T_{\text{eq,2}}}{T_{\text{eq,3}}} = 2.3
     \]

2. **Distance Proportional to Equilibrium Temperature**:
   The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star:  
   \[
   \frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}}
   \]
   Using the given ratio \( T_{\text{eq,1}} / T_{\text{eq,2}} = 1.4 \), we solve for \( D_2 / D_1 \):  
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}} = 1.4 \implies \frac{D_2}{D_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \implies D_2 = 1.96 D_1
   \]

   Similarly, for \( T_{\text{eq,2}} / T_{\text{eq,3}} = 2.3 \):  
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{D_3}{D_2}} = 2.3 \implies \frac{D_3}{D_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \implies D_3 = 5.29 D_2
   \]

   Substituting \( D_2 = 1.96 D_1 \) into \( D_3 = 5.29 D_2 \):  
   \[
   D_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 D_1 \approx 10.368 D_1
   \]

3. **Orbital Period and Distance**:
   Using Kepler's Third Law, the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance) divided by the square root of the star's mass. Since all planets orbit the same star, the star's mass cancels out, and \( P^2 \propto D^3 \). Thus:  
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^3}
   \]

   Substituting \( D_3 / D_1 \approx 10.368 \):  
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \sqrt{(10.368)^3}
   \]

   Calculating \( (10.368)^3 \):  
   \[
   (10.368)^3 \approx 1114.6
   \]

   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \sqrt{1114.6} \approx 33.4
   \]

### Conclusion:
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately **33.4 times larger** than that of Planet1. The mass ratios provided in the problem are not directly relevant to this calculation, as the orbital period depends only on the distance from the star and the star's mass (which is constant for all planets).

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about three exoplanets (Planet1, Planet2, Planet3) with circular orbits discovered via the TTV method. The TTV method stands for transit timing variations, I think. That's a method used to detect planets by observing the variations in the timing of a planet's transit as it passes in front of its star. But I'm not sure if that's relevant here; maybe it's just background info.

The problem gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 are approximately a ratio of 1.4. And between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 2.3. So, Planet3 is much hotter than Planet2, which is hotter than Planet1.

Then, the mass ratios: Planet1 and Planet2 have a mass ratio of about 1.15, and Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35. So, Planet3 is heavier than Planet2, which is heavier than Planet1. Wait, no. Wait, the ratio is mass of Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, so Planet1 is heavier than Planet2. Then, Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35, meaning Planet2 is heavier than Planet3? Wait, no. Because if the mass ratio is M2/M3 = 1.35, then M2 is 1.35 times M3, so M3 is less than M2. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Mass ratio Planet1:Planet2 is 1.15, meaning M1/M2=1.15. So, M1 = 1.15 * M2. So Planet1 is more massive than Planet2. Then, Planet2:Planet3 is 1.35, so M2/M3=1.35. That means M2 = 1.35 * M3. So, M3 = M2 / 1.35. So Planet3 is less massive than Planet2. So the masses go M1 > M2 > M3.

But wait, the question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. So, I need to find P3/P1. 

The problem gives the albedo for all three planets as 0.3, similar to Earth. Albedo is the reflectivity—so this is the same for all, which probably affects the equilibrium temperature.

The question is asking by what factor the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. So, I need to find P3 / P1.

Hmm. So, how to approach this. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by the formula:

Te = [(L(1 - a))/(16 π σ D²)]^(1/4)

Where L is the star's luminosity, a is the planet's albedo, D is the distance from the star, and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant. But wait, I think that's the formula. Alternatively, sometimes the formula is written as Te = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2D)) * (1 - a)^(1/4), where T_star is the star's effective temperature and R_star its radius. But perhaps it's the first version using L.

Alternatively, when considering the inverse square law, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star. Because the flux is L/(4πD²), so the equilibrium temperature would depend on that.

But wait, in the problem, all three planets have the same star, right? So L is the same for all. And albedo a is 0.3 for all. So, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures can be related to the square root of the inverse of the distances.

Because Te is proportional to (L/(D² * (1 - a)))^(1/4). Since L and a are the same, Te ∝ 1/(D^0.5). Alternatively, Te^4 is proportional to L/(D² (1 - a)), so Te^4 ∝ 1/D². So, Te ∝ 1/sqrt(D).

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me write the formula properly. The equilibrium temperature formula is:

Te = ( (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D²) )^(1/4 )

So, for each planet, Te is proportional to sqrt( (1 - a) / D² ), but since (1 - a) is same for all, Te is proportional to 1/(D^0.5).

Wait, no. Let me do the math. Let's say Te1 and Te2 are the equilibrium temperatures for Planet1 and Planet2. Then:

Te1 / Te2 = [ ( (L (1 - a)) / (16 π σ D1²) )^(1/4) ] / [ same for D2 ]

So, Te1/Te2 = sqrt( sqrt( (D2) / (D1) ) )

Wait, more accurately, since (Te1^4) / (Te2^4) = (D2²) / (D1²) * (1 - a same). So,

Te1^4 / Te2^4 = (D2^2) / (D1^2)

Then, taking the square root twice (since it's 1/4 power), Te1/Te2 = (D2/D1)^(1/2) / (D1/D2)^(1/2)? Wait, maybe I should take logs.

Alternatively, let's take the ratio of Te1 and Te2.

Te1/Te2 = [ (1/(D1)) / (1/(D2)) ]^(1/4) * sqrt( (1 - a1)/(1 - a2) ) )

But since a is the same for all, (1 - a) is same, so the ratio becomes:

Te1/Te2 = (D2/D1)^(1/4) ?

Wait, let me try this again. Let me write the ratio of Te1 over Te2:

Te1/Te2 = [ (L/(16πσ D1²) (1 - a)) / (L/(16πσ D2²) (1 - a)) ) ]^(1/4 )

Simplify:

Te1/Te2 = [ (D2² / D1²) ]^(1/4 ) )

= (D2/D1)^(1/2)

So, Te1/Te2 = sqrt(D2/D1)

Similarly, Te2/Te3 = sqrt(D3/D2)

Wait, but the problem gives the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 as 1.4. So, Te1/Te2 = 1.4.

So,

sqrt(D2/D1) = 1.4

Squaring both sides,

D2/D1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96

So, D2 = 1.96 * D1

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So, Te2/Te3 = 2.3.

So,

sqrt(D3/D2) = 2.3

Squaring,

D3/D2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29

So, D3 = 5.29 * D2

But D2 = 1.96 D1,

So D3 = 5.29 * 1.96 D1 ≈ 5.29 * 1.96 ≈ let's calculate that.

5.29 * 2 is 10.58, minus 5.29 * 0.04 (since 1.96 is 2 -0.04), so 5.29 *0.04=0.2116. So 10.58 - 0.2116≈10.3684. So D3≈10.3684 D1.

So the distance of planet3 is about 10.37 times that of planet1.

But wait, the question is about the orbital period. So, how do we relate orbital period to distance?

I remember Kepler's third law, which states that the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance from the star) divided by the mass of the star. But wait, more accurately, the formula is:

P^2 = (4 π² / (G M)) ) * a^3

Where M is the mass of the star, a is the semi-major axis (distance), G is the gravitational constant, and P is the period.

But in this problem, we have three planets orbiting the same star, so M is the same for all. So, for each planet, P^2 is proportional to a^3.

So, P1^2 ∝ a1^3

P2^2 ∝ a2^3

P3^2 ∝ a3^3

So, the ratio of P3 to P1 would be:

(P3/P1)^2 = (a3/a1)^3

So, P3/P1 = sqrt( (a3/a1)^3 )

But wait, in our case, a3 is the distance D3, and a1 is D1.

So,

a3 = 10.3684 D1

Therefore, (a3/a1)^3 = (10.3684)^3 ≈ let's compute that.

10^3 is 1000. 0.3684 is approximately 0.3684.

(10.3684)^3 = (10 + 0.3684)^3.

Using binomial expansion:

≈10^3 + 3*(10^2)*0.3684 + 3*(10)*(0.3684)^2 + (0.3684)^3

10^3 =1000

3*100 *0.3684= 300 * 0.3684=110.52

3*10*(0.3684^2)=30*(0.1356)=4.068

0.3684^3≈0.0499 ≈0.05

Adding up: 1000 +110.52=1110.52 +4.068=1114.588 +0.05≈1114.638.

So, approximately 1114.64.

So, (a3/a1)^3 ≈ 1114.64.

Then, (P3/P1)^2 = 1114.64 → P3/P1 = sqrt(1114.64) ≈ 33.38.

So, approximately 33.4.

Wait, but looking back, I think the calculation might have gone wrong somewhere. Because the answer options include option D) ~33.4.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the initial approach. Because the problem gives the mass ratios of the planets, but in Kepler's third law, the mass of the star is in the denominator. Unless the planets' masses are significant compared to the star, but in most cases, the star's mass is much larger, so the planet masses can be neglected. So, I think the mass ratios given in the problem (between the planets) may not directly affect the calculation of the orbital period, as the star's mass is the dominant factor.

Wait, wait, no. The Kepler's third law as applied to planets is:

P^2 = (4 π² G M_star)^(-1) * a^3

But if M_p (planet mass) is considered, it's only when the planet's mass is significant compared to the star. But in reality, the star's mass M is much larger than the planet's, so the planet's mass doesn't affect the orbital period much. So, the period mainly depends on the semi-major axis and the star's mass.

But in this problem, I don't know the mass of the star. But since all planets orbit the same star, M is the same for all three. So, the mass ratios between the planets (M1/M2 and M2/M3) don't directly affect the calculation of the orbital period. So, perhaps the given mass ratios are a red herring, or maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, but wait. The problem gives the mass ratios between the planets, but without knowing the star's mass, perhaps that information isn't necessary. Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the Hill sphere or something else, but I don't think so. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the TTV method (transit timing variations) detects planets by their gravitational influence on each other. So, the mass of the planets would affect the TTVs, but in this problem, we're being asked about the orbital periods, which are determined by the semi-major axis and the star's mass, not the planet's mass. So, perhaps the given mass ratios are not needed for this particular question.

So, in that case, the mass ratios don't affect the calculation of P3/P1, which depends only on the distance ratios.

Wait, but the question gives the mass ratios. So, perhaps I'm supposed to use them for something else. Let me re-examine the question.

The problem states that the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 are 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 are 2.3. The mass ratios are 1.15 (Planet1/Planet2) and 1.35 (Planet2/Planet3). Albedo is 0.3 for all.

The question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relationship between orbital period, mass, and equilibrium temperature. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: equilibrium temperature is given by Te = [ (L (1 - a) ) / (16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4)

But the problem gives the ratio of equilibrium temperatures, so Te1/Te2 = 1.4.

So, as I did before, D2/D1 = (Te1/Te2)^2 = 1.96 → D2 = 1.96 D1.

Similarly, Te2/Te3 = 2.3 → D3 = D2 * (Te2/Te3)^2 = D2 * (2.3)^2 = D2 *5.29.

So, D3 =5.29 * D2, which is 5.29 * 1.96 D1 ≈ 10.368 D1.

So, D3/D1 ≈10.368.

Then, using Kepler's third law, P^2 ∝ D^3 (since M is same for all), so P3/P1 = sqrt( (D3/D1)^3 )

So, (D3/D1)^3 = (10.368)^3≈1114.6.

So, sqrt(1114.6) ≈33.38 → approximately 33.4.

So, the answer would be option D, ~33.4.

Wait, but why is the mass ratio given? Because if the question was about, say, the Hill sphere radius or something else, the planet's mass would matter. But for orbital period, given the same star, planet mass doesn't come into play. So, the mass ratio information seems irrelevant here. But the question gives it, so perhaps I missed something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equilibrium temperature formula. Let me recheck that.

Equilibrium temperature formula is:

Te = [ (L (1 - a) )/(16 π σ D²) ]^(1/4)

Yes, that's correct. So, the ratio of Te1/Te2 is (D2/D1)^(1/2), as derived earlier. So, the distances are correct as D2=1.96 D1, D3=10.368 D1.

So, the period ratio is P3/P1 = (D3/D1)^(3/2) = (10.368)^(1.5) = sqrt( (10.368)^3 )

Which is what I calculated as ~33.4.

So, the answer should be option D, ~33.4.

Wait, but the options are:

A) ~10.4

B) ~3.2

C) ~4.4

D) ~33.4

So, D is correct.

But why are the mass ratios given? Maybe it's a distractor, or perhaps another approach requires them. Let me think.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the problem is considering the mass of the planets when calculating the equilibrium temperature. But equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity, distance, and albedo. So, the planet's mass shouldn't affect the equilibrium temperature. Unless perhaps if the planet has a different thermal inertia, but the problem says equilibrium temperature, which is a steady-state calculation and doesn't depend on mass.

So, the mass ratios are given but not needed for this problem.

So, the correct answer is D) ~33.4.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the problem using the given data and relevant physical principles.

### Key Information:
1. **Equilibrium Temperature Ratios**:
   - The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is 1.4:  
     \[
     \frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = 1.4
     \]
   - The ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3:  
     \[
     \frac{T_{\text{eq,2}}}{T_{\text{eq,3}}} = 2.3
     \]

2. **Distance Proportional to Equilibrium Temperature**:
   The equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star:  
   \[
   \frac{T_{\text{eq,1}}}{T_{\text{eq,2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}}
   \]
   Using the given ratio \( T_{\text{eq,1}} / T_{\text{eq,2}} = 1.4 \), we solve for \( D_2 / D_1 \):  
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{D_2}{D_1}} = 1.4 \implies \frac{D_2}{D_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \implies D_2 = 1.96 D_1
   \]

   Similarly, for \( T_{\text{eq,2}} / T_{\text{eq,3}} = 2.3 \):  
   \[
   \sqrt{\frac{D_3}{D_2}} = 2.3 \implies \frac{D_3}{D_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \implies D_3 = 5.29 D_2
   \]

   Substituting \( D_2 = 1.96 D_1 \) into \( D_3 = 5.29 D_2 \):  
   \[
   D_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 D_1 \approx 10.368 D_1
   \]

3. **Orbital Period and Distance**:
   Using Kepler's Third Law, the orbital period \( P \) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (distance) divided by the square root of the star's mass. Since all planets orbit the same star, the star's mass cancels out, and \( P^2 \propto D^3 \). Thus:  
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{D_3}{D_1}\right)^3}
   \]

   Substituting \( D_3 / D_1 \approx 10.368 \):  
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \sqrt{(10.368)^3}
   \]

   Calculating \( (10.368)^3 \):  
   \[
   (10.368)^3 \approx 1114.6
   \]

   Taking the square root:  
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \sqrt{1114.6} \approx 33.4
   \]

### Conclusion:
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately **33.4 times larger** than that of Planet1. The mass ratios provided in the problem are not directly relevant to this calculation, as the orbital period depends only on the distance from the star and the star's mass (which is constant for all planets).
