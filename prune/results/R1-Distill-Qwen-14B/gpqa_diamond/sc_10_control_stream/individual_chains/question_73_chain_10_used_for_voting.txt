Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about two astronauts moving at relativistic speeds, and I need to find their relative speed and the total energy of the system. Hmm, I remember that in relativity, things get a bit tricky because you can't just add velocities like you normally would. Oh right, you have to use the velocity addition formula. 

So the problem says the astronauts have masses 2m and 3m. Their speeds are 0.6c and 0.5c respectively, both in the positive x-direction. I'm a bit confused about whether these speeds are measured from the same frame or different ones, but I think the problem is asking for the relative speed between them, so I'll assume they are in the same inertial frame. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, if both are in the same frame, their relative speed would just be the difference, but since they're moving in the same direction, maybe it's 0.6c - 0.5c = 0.1c. But I remember that in relativity, you can't just subtract speeds like that. Oh right! Because velocities don't add like that when they're a significant fraction of the speed of light. So I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

Wait, but wait. The formula for relative velocity when two objects are moving in the same direction is (v1 - v2)/(1 - (v1 v2)/(c²)). So plugging in 0.6c and 0.5c, that would be (0.6c - 0.5c) / (1 - (0.6c * 0.5c)/(c²)) ) = (0.1c) / (1 - (0.3c²)/(c²)) )= 0.1c / (1 - 0.3) = 0.1c / 0.7 ≈ 0.1428c. So about 0.14c, which matches one of the options. So the relative speed is approximately 0.14c.

Now for the total energy. Each astronaut's energy would be their relativistic energy, right? The formula is E = gamma * m c², where gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's compute each one.

First astronaut: mass 2m, speed 0.6c.
Gamma1 = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.6)^2) = 1/sqrt(1-0.36) = 1/sqrt(0.64) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So E1 = 1.25 * 2m c² = 2.5 m c².

Second astronaut: mass 3m, speed 0.5c.
Gamma2 = 1/sqrt(1 - 0.25) = 1/sqrt(0.75) ≈ 1.1547. So E2 = 1.1547 *3m c² ≈ 3.464m c².

Adding them together: E_total = 2.5 + 3.464 = 5.964 m c². So approximately 5.96 mc². 

Looking at the options, option C says v_rel = 0.14c and E=5.96 mc². That fits. Option D says E=5mc², which is less than what I calculated. So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the relative speed between the two astronauts using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{v_1 - v_2}{1 - \frac{v_1 v_2}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \(v_1 = 0.6c\) and \(v_2 = 0.5c\):

\[
v_{\text{rel}} = \frac{0.6c - 0.5c}{1 - \frac{(0.6c)(0.5c)}{c^2}} = \frac{0.1c}{1 - 0.3} = \frac{0.1c}{0.7} \approx 0.14c
\]

Thus, the relative speed is approximately \(0.14c\).

Next, we calculate the total energy of the system. The total energy of each astronaut is given by the relativistic energy formula:

\[
E = \gamma m c^2, \quad \text{where } \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\]

For the first astronaut (mass \(2m\), speed \(0.6c\)):

\[
\gamma_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.6)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.64}} = 1.25
\]
\[
E_1 = \gamma_1 (2m) c^2 = 1.25 \cdot 2m c^2 = 2.5m c^2
\]

For the second astronaut (mass \(3m\), speed \(0.5c\)):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.75}} \approx 1.1547
\]
\[
E_2 = \gamma_2 (3m) c^2 = 1.1547 \cdot 3m c^2 \approx 3.464m c^2
\]

The total energy of the system is:

\[
E_{\text{total}} = E_1 + E_2 = 2.5m c^2 + 3.464m c^2 \approx 5.96m c^2
\]

Comparing the results with the options, the correct choice is:

- \(v_{\text{rel}} = 0.14c\)
- \(E_{\text{total}} = 5.96m c^2\)

This matches **Option C**.
