Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

Alright, the situation is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and these spots have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, when we observe the star's brightness over time, the spots will cause variations as the star rotates. The question is saying that this setup can look similar to an exoplanet causing brightness variations, and we're supposed to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. The formula I think is (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar the star's radius. So the dip in brightness is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

But wait, in this problem, the star isn't just a uniform brightness. There are spots that are cooler. So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. One hemisphere has these spots, which are darker, so when that side is facing us, the total brightness decreases. The star's brightness variation over time would be similar to an exoplanet transit, but it's actually due to the spots.

The problem says that we need to find the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as this spotted star. So, first, I need to calculate the amplitude caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same dip.

Let me think about the spotted star first. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so T_spot = 5000 K. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So, half the star's surface is covered, and 20% of that is spots. Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of one hemisphere.

Wait, the star's surface area is 4πR², but a hemisphere is 2πR². So the spotted area is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute less brightness.

The star's total luminosity without spots would be L = 4πR² * σ * Teff^4. But when the spots are present, the observed luminosity changes. Let me model the change in brightness when the star rotates so that the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

The star emits uniformly except for the spots. So the normal part of the hemisphere (non-spots) has a temperature of 6000 K, and the spots are 5000 K.

Wait, no. Wait, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K. But the spots are cooler. So the star's surface without spots is at 6000 K, and the spots are at 5000 K.

The total luminosity when the spotted hemisphere is facing us can be calculated by considering the normal and spot areas. The unspotted part of the hemisphere is 80% of the hemisphere's area, since the filling factor is 20% (so 20% spots, 80% normal). The hemisphere's area is 2πR², so the unspotted area is 0.8 * 2πR² = 1.6 π R², and the spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4 π R².

So the total flux when the spot hemisphere is visible would be:

Flux = (Area_unspotted * σ * T_unspotted^4) + (Area_spotted * σ * T_spotted^4) 

Wait, but wait: the star's surface consists of two parts for the hemisphere: the spots and the non-spots. The other hemisphere is completely normal because the spots are only on one side.

Wait, no. The problem says that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots. Oh, but the star as a whole would emit from both hemispheres. Wait, no. When you see one hemisphere, the other is on the back side, not visible. Oh, no, wait, no. Actually, when a star is viewed from Earth, you can see half of it (a hemisphere), regardless of where the spots are. So if the spots are covering part of that visible hemisphere, then when the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere comes into view, and then when it's not, the other hemisphere (without spots) is visible.

Wait, but the star is a sphere, so we can only see one hemisphere at any time. The spots are on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are visible, and when the other hemisphere is facing us, the spots are not. So the total flux from the star would vary between the two cases.

Wait, perhaps that's not quite right. Let me think again. The star's spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates so that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are in our line of sight. So when the star is in that orientation, part of the hemisphere we see is covered by spots. When it's rotated 180 degrees, the other hemisphere (without spots) is facing us.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. So the star's brightness varies as the spotted area comes into and out of view as it rotates.

But the question says that the star emits in such a way that the brightness variation resembles an exoplanet transit. That is, when the planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip. Similarly, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total light is lower because the spots are cooler and emit less.

So I need to calculate the relative change in brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible, compared to when the non-spotted (other) hemisphere is visible.

Wait, but the star's total luminosity when the spotted hemisphere is visible would be different than when the non-spotted one is visible?

Wait, no: when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the part of the star that's visible (the hemisphere) has spots covering 20% of its area. So the flux from that hemisphere is the sum of the flux from the spotted and unspotted parts.

Alternatively, when the other hemisphere (non-spotty) is facing us, the entire hemisphere emits at 6000 K.

Wait, but wait, the star's overall effective temperature is 6000 K, which is the average temperature of the entire surface. But when part of the surface is cooler, the average flux from the star would change when that part is visible.

Hmm, perhaps I should model it as follows:

The star has a certain total luminosity when the spotted hemisphere is visible, and a higher luminosity when the other hemisphere is visible (since the other hemisphere doesn't have spots and is at 6000 K).

Wait, but no. Because when the spotted hemisphere is visible, part of the area is at 5000 K, but the rest is still at 6000 K. So the total flux from the star when the spotted hemisphere is visible is the sum of the fluxes from the unspotted (6000 K) and spotted (5000 K) regions of that hemisphere.

When the non-spotted hemisphere is visible, the entire hemisphere is at 6000 K, so higher flux.

Wait, that's the key. So the star's total flux alternates between two values, depending on which hemisphere is visible.

So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted = (0.8 * A_hemi * σ * (6000)^4) + (0.2 * A_hemi * σ * (5000)^4) 

And when the non-spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_non_spotted = A_hemi * σ * (6000)^4 

Where A_hemi is the area of the hemisphere, which is 2πR².

Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4πR². So when the hemisphere is visible, the flux is from 2πR², whether it's the spotted or non-spotted hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the flux when the star is in both configurations.

So the star's flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

F_spotted = (0.8 * 2πR²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.2 * 2πR²) * σ (5000)^4 )

And when the non-spotted hemisphere is visible:

F_non_spotted = (2πR²) * σ (6000)^4 )

Wait, no, because when the non-spotted hemisphere is visible, all the area is at 6000 K. So F_non_spotted = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

But when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the area is split into 80% (unspotted) at 6000 K and 20% (spots) at 5000 K. So F_spotted is the sum.

So let's compute F_spotted and F_non_spotted.

But wait, the star's total luminosity is the sum of all the flux from the entire surface. But when we are observing, we only see one hemisphere at a time. So the flux from the visible hemisphere is F_visible, which depends on whether it's the spotted or non-spotted hemisphere.

So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, F_visible = 0.8 * (2π R²) * σ (6000^4) + 0.2 * (2π R²) * σ (5000^4)

Wait, no. That's when the spotted hemisphere is visible. The other hemisphere is not visible, so it doesn't contribute.

Wait, no. The visible hemisphere is either the spotted one or the non-spotted one. So for each case, compute the flux from that hemisphere.

So F_spotted_hemi = (0.8 * 2π R² * σ (6000^4)) + (0.2 * 2π R² * σ (5000^4) )

F_non_spotted_hemi = 2π R² * σ (6000^4 )

So the difference in flux between these two states is F_non_spotted_hemi - F_spotted_hemi.

Wait, no, because when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted_hemi, and when the non-spotted is visible, it's F_non_spotted_hemi. So the variation in brightness is the difference between these two.

Wait, but the star's maximum brightness would be when the non-spotted hemisphere is visible, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is visible. So the amplitude (ΔF) is F_non_spotted_hemi - F_spotted_hemi.

Let me compute this.

First, let's compute each term.

Compute F_non_spotted_hemi:

F_non_spotted = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

F_spotted_hemi = (0.8 * 2π R² σ (6000)^4 ) + (0.2 * 2π R² σ (5000)^4 )

So let's factor out 2π R² σ:

F_spotted = 2π R² σ [0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4) ]

So the difference ΔF = F_non_spotted - F_spotted.

Which is:

ΔF = 2π R² σ (6000^4) - 2π R² σ [0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4) ]

= 2π R² σ [ 6000^4 * (1 - 0.8) - 0.2 * 5000^4 ]

= 2π R² σ [0.2*6000^4 - 0.2*5000^4 ]

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ [6000^4 - 5000^4 ]

= 0.2 * F_non_spotted * ( (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (6000^4) ) ?

Wait, no, I'm not sure. Let's compute the numerical value.

Compute 6000^4 and 5000^4.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 = 1.296e15, 5000^4 = 6.25e14.

6000^4 - 5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = (1.296 - 0.625) e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

So ΔF = 0.2 * 2π R² σ (6.71e14)

Wait, but wait, let me plug in the numbers properly.

Wait, the star's radius is the same as the Sun's. So R = R_sun, which is about 7e5 km, but perhaps the exact value isn't needed because we can compute relative ratios.

But perhaps I can compute the fractional change in brightness.

The fractional change would be ΔF / F_non_spotted.

ΔF = F_non_spotted - F_spotted.

So,

ΔF = F_non_spotted * (1 - (0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4 )) / (6000^4) )

= F_non_spotted * [1 - 0.8 - 0.2*(5000^4/6000^4) ]

Compute 5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

So (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈ about 0.4823.

So 0.2 * 0.4823 ≈ 0.09646.

So 1 - 0.8 = 0.2, minus 0.09646 → 0.2 - 0.09646 = 0.10354.

So ΔF = F_non_spotted * 0.10354.

So the fractional change in flux is about 10.354%.

Wait, so the amplitude is about 10.35% of the star's maximum flux.

Wait, but wait, the star's maximum flux would be when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us, which is F_non_spotted. When the spotted hemisphere is facing, the flux is F_spotted, which is lower.

So the dip is ΔF = F_non_spotted - F_spotted = F_non_spotted * 0.10354.

So the fractional change is 0.10354, or about 10.35%.

Wait, but I think this might not be correct. Because when the star is observed from Earth, the maximum brightness occurs when the non-spotted hemisphere is visible, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is visible. So the amplitude is the difference between these two fluxes. But wait, perhaps I should consider the relative brightness, which is (F_min / F_max) - 1.

Wait, no. The amplitude is usually the difference between F_max and F_min. So the fractional amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F_max.

In this case, F_max is F_non_spotted, F_min is F_spotted.

So the fractional amplitude is (F_non_spotted - F_spotted)/F_non_spotted = 0.10354, about 10.35%.

So the observed brightness variation has an amplitude of about 10.35% of the star's brightness.

Now, the problem says that this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So we need to find the radius of a planet that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve, assuming no spots.

Wait, no. The question says: "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e., Rpl/Rstar)?"

So if the star wasn't spotted, what planet radius would cause the same dip as the spotted effect.

In the case of a planet, the dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is π Rp², and the star's area is π Rstar² (since we're only considering the area of the star's disk, not the entire surface).

Wait, no. Wait, when a planet transits a star, the blocked light is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The star's area is π Rstar² (from our point of view, since we see a circle of radius Rstar). The planet's area is π Rp². So the dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2.

But wait, the dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2, but that's when the planet is exactly in front of the center of the star. When it's off-center, the dip is less. But for maximum dip, it's (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So if the amplitude due to the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2, and the amplitude due to the spots is ~0.1035 (10.35%), then we set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035.

So solving for Rp/Rstar, we take the square root of 0.1035.

What's the square root of 0.1035?

Well, sqrt(0.1) is about 0.316. 0.1035 is a bit higher than 0.1. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 0.32^2 = 0.1024, which is 0.1024. Our value is 0.1035. So the square root is a bit higher than 0.32.

0.32^2 = 0.1024.

0.321^2 = approx 0.103 (since 0.32 * 0.32 = 0.1024; 0.321^2 = (0.32 + 0.001)^2 = 0.32^2 + 2*0.32*0.001 + 0.001^2 = 0.1024 + 0.00064 + 0.000001 = 0.103041.)

Wait, 0.321² = 0.103041, which is approximately 0.10304. Our ΔF is approximately 0.10354, which is a bit higher. So the square root is about 0.321 + a little.

Wait, but let's compute it more precisely.

We need x such that x² = 0.10354.

We have x ≈ 0.321, and x² is 0.103041.

Difference is 0.10354 - 0.103041 = 0.000499.

The derivative of x² is 2x, so to find the next term, delta x is approximately delta (x²)/(2x) = 0.000499/(2 * 0.321) ≈ 0.000499 / 0.642 ≈ approximately 0.000777.

So x ≈ 0.321 + 0.000777 ≈ 0.3218.

So around 0.3218, which is about 0.322.

Wait, but looking at the options: option D is ~0.32, option A is ~0.39.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, the fractional change in brightness due to the spots is about 10.35%, and the planet's dip would need to be the same. So the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 ≈ 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3218.

Looking at the options, the closest is D) ~0.32.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the amplitude calculation because I might have made a mistake.

The initial calculation:

F_non_spotted = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

F_spotted = 2π R² σ [0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4 ].

So the difference is:

ΔF = F_non_spotted - F_spotted = 2π R² σ [ (6000^4) - (0.8*6000^4 + 0.2*5000^4) ]

= 2π R² σ [ (1 - 0.8) * 6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 2π R² σ [ 0.2 *6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

So the fractional change (ΔF / F_non_spotted) is:

[0.2 *2π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [ 2π R² σ 6000^4 ]

= 0.2 * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4.

Which is 0.2 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

As I did before, (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So 1-0.4823=0.5177.

0.2 * 0.5177≈0.1035.

So that's 10.35% dip.

So the planet's dip should be the same, 10.35% which is (Rp/Rstar)^2=0.1035 → Rp/Rstar≈0.3218.

So the closest option is D) ~0.32.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option D is ~0.32.

So the answer should be D.

But wait, let me think again. When a planet transits, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2, which is the area blocked. But in the case of the star with spots, the dip is due to the change in flux from the part of the star that's covered by spots, but since we're only seeing a hemisphere, the calculation is as I did.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip. Because the star's brightness is the sum of the flux from the entire visible hemisphere. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is lower than when the non-spotted is visible. So the dip is (F_non_spotted - F_spotted)/F_non_spotted = 10.35%.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the relative flux as compared to the star's total flux without spots.

Wait, the star's total flux without any spots would be F_total = 4π R² σ (6000)^4, since that's the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the star.

But when we're observing, we only see one hemisphere, so the flux would be F_obs = 2π R² σ (6000)^4 = (1/2) F_total.

Wait, that's an important point. Because the star's total flux is F_total = 4π R² σ Teff^4. But when we observe it from Earth, we only see half the star's surface (a hemisphere), so the observed flux is F_obs = 2π R² σ Teff^4.

Ah, wait, that changes things! Because in the case without spots, the flux would be F_obs = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

But when the spots are present, the flux varies depending on which hemisphere is visible.

Wait, so when the non-spotted hemisphere is visible, F_obs is 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

When the spotted hemisphere is visible, F_obs is 2π R² σ [0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4 ].

So the dip in brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

ΔF = F_non_spotted_obs - F_spotted_obs.

Which is:

2π R² σ (6000^4) - 2π R² σ [0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4) ]

= 2π R² σ [ (1 - 0.8) * 6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 2π R² σ [0.2 *6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

The fractional dip is ΔF / F_non_spotted_obs = [0.2 * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [6000^4 ]

Which is 0.2 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ].

As before, that's 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.2 * (1 - 0.4823) = 0.2 * 0.5177 = 0.1035, or 10.35% dip.

So the amplitude is 10.35% of F_non_spotted_obs.

Now, what would a planet cause? The planet's transit would cause a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2, since the area blocked is (Rp/Rstar)^2 times the area of the star observed (which is a hemisphere, so area is π Rstar²). So the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So we set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035.

Therefore, Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3218, which is approximately 0.32.

So the correct answer would be option D, ~0.32.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the observed brightness variation caused by the spots, we analyze the situation as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:  
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} \).  
   - Effective Temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).  
   - One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its area (\( \text{filling factor} = 0.2 \)).  
   - Spots are cooler: \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:  
   - When the non-spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:  
     \[
     F_{\text{non-spotted}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4
     \]
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:  
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left[ 0.8(6000)^4 + 0.2(5000)^4 \right]
     \]
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference in flux:  
     \[
     \Delta F = F_{\text{non-spotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}}
     \]
   - The fractional amplitude (relative to \( F_{\text{non-spotted}} \)) is:  
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{non-spotted}}} = 1 - \frac{F_{\text{spotted}}}{F_{\text{non-spotted}}}
     \]
     Substituting values:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{non-spotted}}} = 1 - \left[ 0.8 + 0.2 \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right]
     \]
     Using \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \approx 0.4823 \):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{non-spotted}}} = 1 - \left[ 0.8 + 0.2(0.4823) \right] = 1 - 0.8 - 0.09646 = 0.10354
     \]
     Thus, the fractional amplitude is approximately \( 10.35\% \).

3. **Exoplanet Signal**:  
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation caused by an exoplanet is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:  
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
   - To match the amplitude of \( 10.35\% \), we solve:  
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
     \]
     Taking the square root:
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3218
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). The closest option is:

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

Alright, the situation is about a star with the same radius as the Sun. One hemisphere is covered in dark spots, and these spots have a filling factor of 20%. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler. Because only one hemisphere is spotty, when we observe the star's brightness over time, the spots will cause variations as the star rotates. The question is saying that this setup can look similar to an exoplanet causing brightness variations, and we're supposed to find the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve.

Hmm, I remember that when a planet transits in front of a star, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip in brightness. The amplitude of this dip depends on the size of the planet relative to the star. The formula I think is (Rp / Rstar)^2, where Rp is the planet radius and Rstar the star's radius. So the dip in brightness is proportional to the square of the radius ratio.

But wait, in this problem, the star isn't just a uniform brightness. There are spots that are cooler. So when the star rotates, the spots come into and out of view. One hemisphere has these spots, which are darker, so when that side is facing us, the total brightness decreases. The star's brightness variation over time would be similar to an exoplanet transit, but it's actually due to the spots.

The problem says that we need to find the radius of an exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the light curve as this spotted star. So, first, I need to calculate the amplitude caused by the spots and then find the planet radius that would cause the same dip.

Let me think about the spotted star first. The star's effective temperature is 6000 K, and the spots are 1000 K cooler, so T_spot = 5000 K. The filling factor is 20%, which I think refers to the fraction of the hemisphere covered by spots. So, half the star's surface is covered, and 20% of that is spots. Wait, no, the filling factor is the fraction of the hemisphere that's covered. So the total area covered by spots is 0.2 times the area of one hemisphere.

Wait, the star's surface area is 4πR², but a hemisphere is 2πR². So the spotted area is 0.2 * (2πR²) = 0.4πR². So when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots contribute less brightness.

The star's total luminosity without spots would be L = 4πR² * σ * Teff^4. But when the spots are present, the observed luminosity changes. Let me model the change in brightness when the star rotates so that the spotted hemisphere is facing us.

The star emits uniformly except for the spots. So the normal part of the hemisphere (non-spots) has a temperature of 6000 K, and the spots are 5000 K.

Wait, no. Wait, the star's effective temperature is 6000 K. But the spots are cooler. So the star's surface without spots is at 6000 K, and the spots are at 5000 K.

The total luminosity when the spotted hemisphere is facing us can be calculated by considering the normal and spot areas. The unspotted part of the hemisphere is 80% of the hemisphere's area, since the filling factor is 20% (so 20% spots, 80% normal). The hemisphere's area is 2πR², so the unspotted area is 0.8 * 2πR² = 1.6 π R², and the spotted area is 0.2 * 2πR² = 0.4 π R².

So the total flux when the spot hemisphere is visible would be:

Flux = (Area_unspotted * σ * T_unspotted^4) + (Area_spotted * σ * T_spotted^4) 

Wait, but wait: the star's surface consists of two parts for the hemisphere: the spots and the non-spots. The other hemisphere is completely normal because the spots are only on one side.

Wait, no. The problem says that one hemisphere is covered in dark spots. Oh, but the star as a whole would emit from both hemispheres. Wait, no. When you see one hemisphere, the other is on the back side, not visible. Oh, no, wait, no. Actually, when a star is viewed from Earth, you can see half of it (a hemisphere), regardless of where the spots are. So if the spots are covering part of that visible hemisphere, then when the star rotates, the spotty hemisphere comes into view, and then when it's not, the other hemisphere (without spots) is visible.

Wait, but the star is a sphere, so we can only see one hemisphere at any time. The spots are on one hemisphere, so when that hemisphere is facing us, the spots are visible, and when the other hemisphere is facing us, the spots are not. So the total flux from the star would vary between the two cases.

Wait, perhaps that's not quite right. Let me think again. The star's spots are on one hemisphere, so when the star rotates so that the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the spots are in our line of sight. So when the star is in that orientation, part of the hemisphere we see is covered by spots. When it's rotated 180 degrees, the other hemisphere (without spots) is facing us.

Wait, perhaps that's the case. So the star's brightness varies as the spotted area comes into and out of view as it rotates.

But the question says that the star emits in such a way that the brightness variation resembles an exoplanet transit. That is, when the planet transits, it blocks some of the star's light, causing a dip. Similarly, when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the total light is lower because the spots are cooler and emit less.

So I need to calculate the relative change in brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible, compared to when the non-spotted (other) hemisphere is visible.

Wait, but the star's total luminosity when the spotted hemisphere is visible would be different than when the non-spotted one is visible?

Wait, no: when the spotted hemisphere is facing us, the part of the star that's visible (the hemisphere) has spots covering 20% of its area. So the flux from that hemisphere is the sum of the flux from the spotted and unspotted parts.

Alternatively, when the other hemisphere (non-spotty) is facing us, the entire hemisphere emits at 6000 K.

Wait, but wait, the star's overall effective temperature is 6000 K, which is the average temperature of the entire surface. But when part of the surface is cooler, the average flux from the star would change when that part is visible.

Hmm, perhaps I should model it as follows:

The star has a certain total luminosity when the spotted hemisphere is visible, and a higher luminosity when the other hemisphere is visible (since the other hemisphere doesn't have spots and is at 6000 K).

Wait, but no. Because when the spotted hemisphere is visible, part of the area is at 5000 K, but the rest is still at 6000 K. So the total flux from the star when the spotted hemisphere is visible is the sum of the fluxes from the unspotted (6000 K) and spotted (5000 K) regions of that hemisphere.

When the non-spotted hemisphere is visible, the entire hemisphere is at 6000 K, so higher flux.

Wait, that's the key. So the star's total flux alternates between two values, depending on which hemisphere is visible.

So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted = (0.8 * A_hemi * σ * (6000)^4) + (0.2 * A_hemi * σ * (5000)^4) 

And when the non-spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_non_spotted = A_hemi * σ * (6000)^4 

Where A_hemi is the area of the hemisphere, which is 2πR².

Wait, but the star's total surface area is 4πR². So when the hemisphere is visible, the flux is from 2πR², whether it's the spotted or non-spotted hemisphere.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the flux when the star is in both configurations.

So the star's flux when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

F_spotted = (0.8 * 2πR²) * σ (6000)^4 + (0.2 * 2πR²) * σ (5000)^4 )

And when the non-spotted hemisphere is visible:

F_non_spotted = (2πR²) * σ (6000)^4 )

Wait, no, because when the non-spotted hemisphere is visible, all the area is at 6000 K. So F_non_spotted = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

But when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the area is split into 80% (unspotted) at 6000 K and 20% (spots) at 5000 K. So F_spotted is the sum.

So let's compute F_spotted and F_non_spotted.

But wait, the star's total luminosity is the sum of all the flux from the entire surface. But when we are observing, we only see one hemisphere at a time. So the flux from the visible hemisphere is F_visible, which depends on whether it's the spotted or non-spotted hemisphere.

So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, F_visible = 0.8 * (2π R²) * σ (6000^4) + 0.2 * (2π R²) * σ (5000^4)

Wait, no. That's when the spotted hemisphere is visible. The other hemisphere is not visible, so it doesn't contribute.

Wait, no. The visible hemisphere is either the spotted one or the non-spotted one. So for each case, compute the flux from that hemisphere.

So F_spotted_hemi = (0.8 * 2π R² * σ (6000^4)) + (0.2 * 2π R² * σ (5000^4) )

F_non_spotted_hemi = 2π R² * σ (6000^4 )

So the difference in flux between these two states is F_non_spotted_hemi - F_spotted_hemi.

Wait, no, because when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is F_spotted_hemi, and when the non-spotted is visible, it's F_non_spotted_hemi. So the variation in brightness is the difference between these two.

Wait, but the star's maximum brightness would be when the non-spotted hemisphere is visible, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is visible. So the amplitude (ΔF) is F_non_spotted_hemi - F_spotted_hemi.

Let me compute this.

First, let's compute each term.

Compute F_non_spotted_hemi:

F_non_spotted = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

F_spotted_hemi = (0.8 * 2π R² σ (6000)^4 ) + (0.2 * 2π R² σ (5000)^4 )

So let's factor out 2π R² σ:

F_spotted = 2π R² σ [0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4) ]

So the difference ΔF = F_non_spotted - F_spotted.

Which is:

ΔF = 2π R² σ (6000^4) - 2π R² σ [0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4) ]

= 2π R² σ [ 6000^4 * (1 - 0.8) - 0.2 * 5000^4 ]

= 2π R² σ [0.2*6000^4 - 0.2*5000^4 ]

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ [6000^4 - 5000^4 ]

= 0.2 * F_non_spotted * ( (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / (6000^4) ) ?

Wait, no, I'm not sure. Let's compute the numerical value.

Compute 6000^4 and 5000^4.

6000^4 = (6e3)^4 = 6^4 * 1e12 = 1296e12 = 1.296e15.

5000^4 = (5e3)^4 = 625e12 = 6.25e14.

So 6000^4 = 1.296e15, 5000^4 = 6.25e14.

6000^4 - 5000^4 = 1.296e15 - 6.25e14 = (1.296 - 0.625) e15 = 0.671e15 = 6.71e14.

So ΔF = 0.2 * 2π R² σ (6.71e14)

Wait, but wait, let me plug in the numbers properly.

Wait, the star's radius is the same as the Sun's. So R = R_sun, which is about 7e5 km, but perhaps the exact value isn't needed because we can compute relative ratios.

But perhaps I can compute the fractional change in brightness.

The fractional change would be ΔF / F_non_spotted.

ΔF = F_non_spotted - F_spotted.

So,

ΔF = F_non_spotted * (1 - (0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4 )) / (6000^4) )

= F_non_spotted * [1 - 0.8 - 0.2*(5000^4/6000^4) ]

Compute 5000/6000 = 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

So (5000/6000)^4 = (5/6)^4 ≈ (0.8333)^4 ≈ about 0.4823.

So 0.2 * 0.4823 ≈ 0.09646.

So 1 - 0.8 = 0.2, minus 0.09646 → 0.2 - 0.09646 = 0.10354.

So ΔF = F_non_spotted * 0.10354.

So the fractional change in flux is about 10.354%.

Wait, so the amplitude is about 10.35% of the star's maximum flux.

Wait, but wait, the star's maximum flux would be when the non-spotted hemisphere is facing us, which is F_non_spotted. When the spotted hemisphere is facing, the flux is F_spotted, which is lower.

So the dip is ΔF = F_non_spotted - F_spotted = F_non_spotted * 0.10354.

So the fractional change is 0.10354, or about 10.35%.

Wait, but I think this might not be correct. Because when the star is observed from Earth, the maximum brightness occurs when the non-spotted hemisphere is visible, and the minimum when the spotted hemisphere is visible. So the amplitude is the difference between these two fluxes. But wait, perhaps I should consider the relative brightness, which is (F_min / F_max) - 1.

Wait, no. The amplitude is usually the difference between F_max and F_min. So the fractional amplitude is (F_max - F_min)/F_max.

In this case, F_max is F_non_spotted, F_min is F_spotted.

So the fractional amplitude is (F_non_spotted - F_spotted)/F_non_spotted = 0.10354, about 10.35%.

So the observed brightness variation has an amplitude of about 10.35% of the star's brightness.

Now, the problem says that this situation can closely resemble the presence of an exoplanet. So we need to find the radius of a planet that would cause the same amplitude in the light curve, assuming no spots.

Wait, no. The question says: "To produce the same amplitude signal in the star's light curve (if the star was not covered by spots!), what should be the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet relative to the radius of the host star (i.e., Rpl/Rstar)?"

So if the star wasn't spotted, what planet radius would cause the same dip as the spotted effect.

In the case of a planet, the dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2, because the area blocked is π Rp², and the star's area is π Rstar² (since we're only considering the area of the star's disk, not the entire surface).

Wait, no. Wait, when a planet transits a star, the blocked light is proportional to the area of the planet relative to the star. The star's area is π Rstar² (from our point of view, since we see a circle of radius Rstar). The planet's area is π Rp². So the dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2.

But wait, the dip is (Rp / Rstar)^2, but that's when the planet is exactly in front of the center of the star. When it's off-center, the dip is less. But for maximum dip, it's (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So if the amplitude due to the planet is (Rp/Rstar)^2, and the amplitude due to the spots is ~0.1035 (10.35%), then we set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035.

So solving for Rp/Rstar, we take the square root of 0.1035.

What's the square root of 0.1035?

Well, sqrt(0.1) is about 0.316. 0.1035 is a bit higher than 0.1. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 0.32^2 = 0.1024, which is 0.1024. Our value is 0.1035. So the square root is a bit higher than 0.32.

0.32^2 = 0.1024.

0.321^2 = approx 0.103 (since 0.32 * 0.32 = 0.1024; 0.321^2 = (0.32 + 0.001)^2 = 0.32^2 + 2*0.32*0.001 + 0.001^2 = 0.1024 + 0.00064 + 0.000001 = 0.103041.)

Wait, 0.321² = 0.103041, which is approximately 0.10304. Our ΔF is approximately 0.10354, which is a bit higher. So the square root is about 0.321 + a little.

Wait, but let's compute it more precisely.

We need x such that x² = 0.10354.

We have x ≈ 0.321, and x² is 0.103041.

Difference is 0.10354 - 0.103041 = 0.000499.

The derivative of x² is 2x, so to find the next term, delta x is approximately delta (x²)/(2x) = 0.000499/(2 * 0.321) ≈ 0.000499 / 0.642 ≈ approximately 0.000777.

So x ≈ 0.321 + 0.000777 ≈ 0.3218.

So around 0.3218, which is about 0.322.

Wait, but looking at the options: option D is ~0.32, option A is ~0.39.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, the fractional change in brightness due to the spots is about 10.35%, and the planet's dip would need to be the same. So the planet's dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So (Rp/Rstar)^2 ≈ 0.1035 → Rp/Rstar ≈ sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3218.

Looking at the options, the closest is D) ~0.32.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the amplitude calculation because I might have made a mistake.

The initial calculation:

F_non_spotted = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

F_spotted = 2π R² σ [0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4 ].

So the difference is:

ΔF = F_non_spotted - F_spotted = 2π R² σ [ (6000^4) - (0.8*6000^4 + 0.2*5000^4) ]

= 2π R² σ [ (1 - 0.8) * 6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 2π R² σ [ 0.2 *6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

So the fractional change (ΔF / F_non_spotted) is:

[0.2 *2π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [ 2π R² σ 6000^4 ]

= 0.2 * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) / 6000^4.

Which is 0.2 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ]

As I did before, (5/6)^4 ≈ 0.4823.

So 1-0.4823=0.5177.

0.2 * 0.5177≈0.1035.

So that's 10.35% dip.

So the planet's dip should be the same, 10.35% which is (Rp/Rstar)^2=0.1035 → Rp/Rstar≈0.3218.

So the closest option is D) ~0.32.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option D is ~0.32.

So the answer should be D.

But wait, let me think again. When a planet transits, the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2, which is the area blocked. But in the case of the star with spots, the dip is due to the change in flux from the part of the star that's covered by spots, but since we're only seeing a hemisphere, the calculation is as I did.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the dip. Because the star's brightness is the sum of the flux from the entire visible hemisphere. So when the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is lower than when the non-spotted is visible. So the dip is (F_non_spotted - F_spotted)/F_non_spotted = 10.35%.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the relative flux as compared to the star's total flux without spots.

Wait, the star's total flux without any spots would be F_total = 4π R² σ (6000)^4, since that's the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the star.

But when we're observing, we only see one hemisphere, so the flux would be F_obs = 2π R² σ (6000)^4 = (1/2) F_total.

Wait, that's an important point. Because the star's total flux is F_total = 4π R² σ Teff^4. But when we observe it from Earth, we only see half the star's surface (a hemisphere), so the observed flux is F_obs = 2π R² σ Teff^4.

Ah, wait, that changes things! Because in the case without spots, the flux would be F_obs = 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

But when the spots are present, the flux varies depending on which hemisphere is visible.

Wait, so when the non-spotted hemisphere is visible, F_obs is 2π R² σ (6000)^4.

When the spotted hemisphere is visible, F_obs is 2π R² σ [0.8*(6000)^4 + 0.2*(5000)^4 ].

So the dip in brightness when the spotted hemisphere is visible is:

ΔF = F_non_spotted_obs - F_spotted_obs.

Which is:

2π R² σ (6000^4) - 2π R² σ [0.8*(6000^4) + 0.2*(5000^4) ]

= 2π R² σ [ (1 - 0.8) * 6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 2π R² σ [0.2 *6000^4 - 0.2 *5000^4 ]

= 0.2 * 2π R² σ (6000^4 -5000^4 )

The fractional dip is ΔF / F_non_spotted_obs = [0.2 * (6000^4 -5000^4 ) ] / [6000^4 ]

Which is 0.2 * [1 - (5000/6000)^4 ].

As before, that's 0.2 * (1 - (5/6)^4 ) ≈ 0.2 * (1 - 0.4823) = 0.2 * 0.5177 = 0.1035, or 10.35% dip.

So the amplitude is 10.35% of F_non_spotted_obs.

Now, what would a planet cause? The planet's transit would cause a dip of (Rp/Rstar)^2, since the area blocked is (Rp/Rstar)^2 times the area of the star observed (which is a hemisphere, so area is π Rstar²). So the dip is (Rp/Rstar)^2.

So we set (Rp/Rstar)^2 = 0.1035.

Therefore, Rp/Rstar = sqrt(0.1035) ≈ 0.3218, which is approximately 0.32.

So the correct answer would be option D, ~0.32.


To determine the radius of a hypothetical exoplanet that would produce the same amplitude in the star's light curve as the observed brightness variation caused by the spots, we analyze the situation as follows:

### Key Information:
1. **Star Properties**:  
   - Radius: Same as the Sun, \( R_{\text{star}} \).  
   - Effective Temperature: \( T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K} \).  
   - One hemisphere has dark spots covering 20% of its area (\( \text{filling factor} = 0.2 \)).  
   - Spots are cooler: \( T_{\text{spots}} = 5000 \, \text{K} \).

2. **Brightness Variation Due to Spots**:  
   - When the non-spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:  
     \[
     F_{\text{non-spotted}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma (6000)^4
     \]
   - When the spotted hemisphere is visible, the flux is:  
     \[
     F_{\text{spotted}} = 2\pi R_{\text{star}}^2 \sigma \left[ 0.8(6000)^4 + 0.2(5000)^4 \right]
     \]
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation is the difference in flux:  
     \[
     \Delta F = F_{\text{non-spotted}} - F_{\text{spotted}}
     \]
   - The fractional amplitude (relative to \( F_{\text{non-spotted}} \)) is:  
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{non-spotted}}} = 1 - \frac{F_{\text{spotted}}}{F_{\text{non-spotted}}}
     \]
     Substituting values:
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{non-spotted}}} = 1 - \left[ 0.8 + 0.2 \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \right]
     \]
     Using \( \left( \frac{5000}{6000} \right)^4 \approx 0.4823 \):
     \[
     \frac{\Delta F}{F_{\text{non-spotted}}} = 1 - \left[ 0.8 + 0.2(0.4823) \right] = 1 - 0.8 - 0.09646 = 0.10354
     \]
     Thus, the fractional amplitude is approximately \( 10.35\% \).

3. **Exoplanet Signal**:  
   - The amplitude of the brightness variation caused by an exoplanet is proportional to the square of the planet-to-star radius ratio:  
     \[
     \text{Amplitude} = \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2
     \]
   - To match the amplitude of \( 10.35\% \), we solve:  
     \[
     \left( \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \right)^2 = 0.1035
     \]
     Taking the square root:
     \[
     \frac{R_{\text{planet}}}{R_{\text{star}}} \approx \sqrt{0.1035} \approx 0.3218
     \]

### Conclusion:
The radius of the hypothetical exoplanet, relative to the host star, is approximately \( 0.32 \). The closest option is:

**Answer: D**
