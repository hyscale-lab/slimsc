Okay, so I've got this IUPAC nomenclature problem here, and it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The molecule is a benzene ring with several substituents. The substituents include a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is the -CHO group), and a cyano group (CN). All of these are meta to one another. Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (OH) and a dimethyl amino group (N(CH3)2). Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (OCH3). Additionally, the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile group.

Hmm, I think I need to draw this structure out. But since I can't actually draw, I'll try to visualize it. Let me assign the positions on the benzene ring.

Benzene rings are numbered from 1 to 6 in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. But in this case, since we have a carboxylic acid, which gets the lowest number, I'll start with that.

Let's assume the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Now, the substituents that are meta to each other—so the carboxylic acid, the carbaldehyde, and the cyano—are each separated by two positions. So if the acid is at 1, the other two would be at 3 and 5, perhaps? Wait, wait. Wait, meta positions are separated by two carbons. So if in a benzene ring, substituent A is at position 1, substituent B would be at 3, substituent C at 5, and so on. Alternatively, substituents at positions 1, 4, and 6 could also be meta in a different arrangement, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of their relative positions.

Wait, the question says all three substituents (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano) are meta to one another. So each is separated by two positions. So perhaps the acid is at position 1, the carbaldehyde at 3, and the cyano at 5. Alternatively, another arrangement. Let me think.

But wait, I also have other substituents. The hydroxyl and the dimethylamino groups are both ortho to the acid, which is at position 1. So ortho positions are 2 and 6. So, position 2 and 6 have OH and N(CH3)2. But which is which?

Additionally, the methoxy group is para to the acid. The acid is at 1, so para is position 4. So methoxy is at 4.

Moreover, the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile group. The nitrile is at position 5 (if the acid is at 1, carbaldehyde at 3, nitrile at 5). So the nitrile is at 5. Then, the ortho positions to nitrile (5) are 4 and 6 (since the ring is positions 1-6 in order). But wait, position 4 is already methoxy. So the other ortho position is 6. So the hydroxyl must be at 6, but wait, wait.

Wait, the ortho positions to nitrile (5) are 4 and 6. So if the methoxy is at 4, then the hydroxyl must be at 6. But the hydroxyl is also ortho to the acid (position 1). Wait, the ortho positions to acid (1) are 2 and 6. So if methoxy is at 4, and the hydroxyl is at 6, then that's possible.

Wait, but the substituents ortho to acid (1) are hydroxyl and dimethylamino. So, positions 2 and 6. So, position 2 could be dimethylamino, position 6 could be hydroxyl. Wait, but I thought the hydroxyl is at 6 because it's ortho to nitrile. So that fits.

So let me list the substituents:

1: Carboxylic acid (COOH)
2: Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2)
3: Carbaldehyde (CHO)
4: Methoxy (OCH3)
5: Cyano (CN)
6: Hydroxyl (OH)

So the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH), 2 (N(CH3)2), 3 (CHO), 4 (OCH3), 5 (CN), 6 (OH).

Wait, but the carboxylic acid is at 1. The positions are arranged as follows:

Positions:

1: COOH
2: N(CH3)2
3: CHO
4: OCH3
5: CN
6: OH

Wait, but let me think about the numbering again. The main functional group is the carboxylic acid, so it gets the lowest number. So the ring is numbered such that the COOH is at position 1.

Now, the other substituents are meta to each other. So the COOH, CHO, and CN are all meta. So starting at 1 (COOH), the next meta would be position 3, which is CHO, and the next meta from there is position 5, which is CN. So that's correct.

Now, the substituents ortho to COOH (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. Those are N(CH3)2 and OH. So position 2 is N(CH3)2, position 6 is OH.

Then, the methoxy (OCH3) is para to COOH, which is position 4.

The methoxy and the hydroxyl (OCH3 and OH) are both ortho to the nitrile (CN at 5). The nitrile is at 5. So the ortho positions are 4 and 6. Methoxy is at 4, so OH is at 6. That's correct.

So the substituents are:

1: COOH
2: N(CH3)2
3: CHO
4: OCH3
5: CN
6: OH

Now, I need to write the IUPAC name based on this arrangement.

The parent chain is benzoic acid, so the substituents are numbered according to their positions.

The substituents and their positions:

Position 2: dimethylamino (N(CH3)2)
Position 3: formyl (CHO)
Position 4: methoxy (OCH3)
Position 5: cyano (CN)
Position 6: hydroxyl (OH)

So the substituents in order of numbering priority: The substituents are listed in alphabetical order. The substituents are:

1. COOH (the parent chain is benzoic acid, so it's part of the name, not a substituent)
2. dimethylamino (N(CH3)2)
3. formyl (CHO)
4. methoxy (OCH3)
5. cyano (CN)
6. hydroxyl (OH)

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the substituents are the groups attached to the ring besides the COOH. So in IUPAC naming, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but their positions are given based on their order of priority.

Wait, no, I think the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but their positions are in the order of their occurrence around the ring, but... Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituent order in the name.

For benzoic acid derivatives, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions. So the order would be based on the substituent names, ignoring the prefixes like 'hydroxy' or 'methoxy'.

So the substituents are:

- Cyano (CN): comes from the word "cyano", so starts with C.
- Dimethylamino: starts with D.
- Formyl: starts with F.
- Hydroxyl: starts with H.
- Methoxy: starts with M.
Wait, no, the substituents are actually:

Wait, the substituent groups are:

- OCH3 (methoxy)
- N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)
- CHO (formyl)
- CN (cyano)
- OH (hydroxyl)

So the alphabetical order of the substituents is:

C (cyano), D (dimethylamino), F (formyl), H (hydroxyl), M (methoxy).

Wait, no, wait. Let me list the substituents' prefixes:

- Cyano: cyano
- Dimethylamino: dimethylamino
- Formyl: formyl
- Hydroxyl: hydroxy
- Methoxy: methoxy

So the order in alphabetical order would be:

Cyano (C), Dimethylamino (D), Formyl (F), Hydroxy (H), Methoxy (M).

Wait, but methoxy starts with M, which comes after H, so the order is C, D, F, H, M.

Wait, but wait, the substituents are actually:

Wait, the substituents in the name will be listed in alphabetical order. So the order is:

C comes before D, F, H, M.

So the substituents are: 3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

Wait, but wait, their positions are:

At position 2: dimethylamino (so 2-(dimethylamino))

Position 3: formyl (3-formyl)

Position 4: methoxy (4-methoxy)

Position 5: cyano (5-cyano)

Position 6: hydroxyl (6-hydroxy)

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck:

Position 2: N(CH3)2 → 2-(dimethylamino)

Position 3: CHO → 3-formyl

Position 4: OCH3 →4-methoxy

Position 5: CN →5-cyano

Position 6: OH →6-hydroxy

So the substituents in order of their positions (from 2 to 6) would be:

2-(dimethylamino), 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano, 6-hydroxy.

But when writing the IUPAC name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, not in the order of their positions.

So the prefix order would be:

cyano (C), dimethylamino (D), formyl (F), hydroxy (H), methoxy (M).

So the substituent order in the name would be:

3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

Wait, but let me think again. The substituent prefixes are:

- 2-(dimethylamino)
- 3-formyl
- 4-methoxy
- 5-cyano
-6-hydroxy.

But when listing them alphabetically, it's cyano (C), dimethylamino (D), formyl (F), hydroxy (H), methoxy (M).

So the substituent order in the name would be:

3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

Wait, but the substituent positions also matter in the numbering. Let me see the example.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

Hmm, that would mean substituents in the order: 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy,5-formyl,6-NMe2.

But according to the substituent order, the first substituent alphabetically is cyano (3-cyano), then dimethylamino (6-dimethylamino), then formyl (5-formyl), then hydroxy (2-hydroxy), then methoxy (4-methoxy).

Wait, but in the IUPAC name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but their positions are given as per their numbering. So the name would start with the substituent that comes first alphabetically, but the order in the name isn't necessarily the same as the substituent positions.

So the correct order of substituents in the name would be:

3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about how the substituents are arranged in the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

So substituents in the order: 3-cyano, 6-NMe2,5-formyl,2-OH,4-OCH3.

That's the order I was thinking.

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

So order: 2-OH,3-CN,4-OCH3,5-CHO,6-NMe2.

Which would be according to substituent positions, not alphabetical order.

Option D: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

That's substituents at 5-CN,2-NMe2,3-CHO,6-OH,4-OCH3.

So the substituent order would be: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, methoxy, hydroxy? No, not sure.

Wait, the IUPAC name lists substituents in alphabetical order. So the order of substituents in the name should be:

cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

But wait, what about the substituent 'hydroxy'? It's at position 2 in the correct arrangement.

Wait, but in the substituent list, the order is based on the substituent names, not their positions. So the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of where they are on the ring.

So, the substituents are:

3-cyano → cyano comes first.

Then, 6-(dimethylamino) → dimethylamino starts with D.

Then, 5-formyl → formyl starts with F.

Then, 2-hydroxy → hydroxy starts with H.

Then,4-methoxy → methoxy starts with M.

So the name would be: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Looking at the options:

Option A is exactly that: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

But wait, let me check the other options.

Option B is 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid. So the substituents are in the order of hydroxy, cyano, methoxy, formyl, dimethylamino. That doesn't follow alphabetical order.

Option D is 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid. The substituents are 5-CN,2-NMe2,3-CHO,6-OH,4-OCH3. So the substituent order is: CN, NMe2, CHO, OH, OCH3. But when listed alphabetically, the order would be CN, NMe2, CHO, OCH3, OH? Wait no, that's not right. Wait, the substituent 'hydroxy' (OH) comes before 'methoxy' (OCH3) because H comes before M.

Wait, but in the substituent order in the name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order of the prefix. So the prefixes are:

- Cyano (C)
- Dimethylamino (D)
- Formyl (F)
- Hydroxy (H)
- Methoxy (M)

So the correct order in the name is: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the substituents are:

3-cyano → cyano

6-(dimethylamino) → dimethylamino

5-formyl → formyl

2-hydroxy → hydroxy

4-methoxy → methoxy.

So the substituents in the name would be listed in the order of cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy. So their positions are 3,6,5,2,4.

So the name would be: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Looking at the options, that's option A.

But wait, let me check option B again.

Option B is 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

So substituents are in the order hydroxy, cyano, methoxy, formyl, dimethylamino. Which is wrong for alphabetical order.

Option D: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

So substituents are cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy. That's the correct order, but their positions are 5,2,3,6,4.

Wait, but in our structure, the substituents are:

3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino,5-formyl,2-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

So substituent order is cyano (3), dimethylamino (6), formyl (5), hydroxy (2), methoxy (4). So when writing the name, the substituents' positions are in the order of their substituent prefixes, not their position numbers.

So the substituent list would be:

3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino,5-formyl,2-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

So the name is 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Which is option A.

Wait but I'm a bit confused because in IUPAC nomenclature, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions. So the substituent with the earliest letter comes first in the name, regardless of where it is on the ring.

So for example, if substituents are at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., but the substituent named 'a' comes before 'b', 'a' is listed first in the name, regardless of position.

So the substituents to list are:

cyano (C), then dimethylamino (D), then formyl (F), then hydroxy (H), then methoxy (M).

So when writing the name, the substituents are listed in that order:

3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino,5-formyl,2-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

Which matches option A.

Wait, but looking at option D:

5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

So substituents are in the order: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Wait, that's correct in terms of alphabetical order, but the positions don't match our structure.

In our structure, the substituents are at positions 3 (CN), 6 (NMe2),5 (CHO),2 (OH),4 (OCH3).

So the substituents in the name would be:

3-cyano,6-dimethylamino,5-formyl,2-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

Which is option A.

So I think the correct answer is option A.

The molecule is a benzene ring with multiple substituents, and the task is to determine its correct IUPAC name. The substituents include a carboxylic acid (COOH), a carbaldehyde (CHO), and a cyano group (CN), which are all meta to one another. Additionally, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (OH) and a dimethylamino group (N(CH3)2), while para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (OCH3). Furthermore, the methoxy and hydroxyl groups are both ortho to the cyano group.

### Step 1: Assigning positions on the benzene ring
- The carboxylic acid is assigned to position 1 (lowest number priority).
- The carbaldehyde (CHO), cyano (CN), and carboxylic acid are meta to one another, so CHO is at position 3, and CN is at position 5.
- Ortho to the carboxylic acid (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. These are assigned to the dimethylamino group (N(CH3)2) at position 2 and the hydroxyl group (OH) at position 6.
- Para to the carboxylic acid (position 1) is position 4, which is assigned to the methoxy group (OCH3).
- The methoxy (OCH3) and hydroxyl (OH) groups are both ortho to the cyano group (CN at position 5), confirming the assignments.

### Step 2: Substituents and their positions
- Position 1: Carboxylic acid (COOH).
- Position 2: Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2).
- Position 3: Carbaldehyde (CHO).
- Position 4: Methoxy (OCH3).
- Position 5: Cyano (CN).
- Position 6: Hydroxyl (OH).

### Step 3: Alphabetical order of substituents
In IUPAC nomenclature, substituents are listed in alphabetical order based on their prefixes:
- Cyano (C).
- Dimethylamino (D).
- Formyl (F).
- Hydroxy (H).
- Methoxy (M).

### Step 4: Constructing the name
The substituents are listed in alphabetical order, with their respective positions:
1. **3-cyano** (CN at position 5).
2. **6-(dimethylamino)** (N(CH3)2 at position 2).
3. **5-formyl** (CHO at position 3).
4. **2-hydroxy** (OH at position 6).
5. **4-methoxy** (OCH3 at position 4).

Thus, the correct IUPAC name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.

### Step 5: Matching with the options
- **Option A**: Matches the derived name exactly.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it lists substituents in the wrong order.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it does not match the substituent positions or order.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it does not match the substituent positions or order.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this IUPAC nomenclature problem here, and it's a bit tricky, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The molecule is a benzene ring with several substituents. The substituents include a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde (which is the -CHO group), and a cyano group (CN). All of these are meta to one another. Then, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (OH) and a dimethyl amino group (N(CH3)2). Para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (OCH3). Additionally, the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile group.

Hmm, I think I need to draw this structure out. But since I can't actually draw, I'll try to visualize it. Let me assign the positions on the benzene ring.

Benzene rings are numbered from 1 to 6 in a way that gives the substituents the lowest possible numbers. But in this case, since we have a carboxylic acid, which gets the lowest number, I'll start with that.

Let's assume the carboxylic acid is at position 1. Now, the substituents that are meta to each other—so the carboxylic acid, the carbaldehyde, and the cyano—are each separated by two positions. So if the acid is at 1, the other two would be at 3 and 5, perhaps? Wait, wait. Wait, meta positions are separated by two carbons. So if in a benzene ring, substituent A is at position 1, substituent B would be at 3, substituent C at 5, and so on. Alternatively, substituents at positions 1, 4, and 6 could also be meta in a different arrangement, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should think in terms of their relative positions.

Wait, the question says all three substituents (carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano) are meta to one another. So each is separated by two positions. So perhaps the acid is at position 1, the carbaldehyde at 3, and the cyano at 5. Alternatively, another arrangement. Let me think.

But wait, I also have other substituents. The hydroxyl and the dimethylamino groups are both ortho to the acid, which is at position 1. So ortho positions are 2 and 6. So, position 2 and 6 have OH and N(CH3)2. But which is which?

Additionally, the methoxy group is para to the acid. The acid is at 1, so para is position 4. So methoxy is at 4.

Moreover, the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile group. The nitrile is at position 5 (if the acid is at 1, carbaldehyde at 3, nitrile at 5). So the nitrile is at 5. Then, the ortho positions to nitrile (5) are 4 and 6 (since the ring is positions 1-6 in order). But wait, position 4 is already methoxy. So the other ortho position is 6. So the hydroxyl must be at 6, but wait, wait.

Wait, the ortho positions to nitrile (5) are 4 and 6. So if the methoxy is at 4, then the hydroxyl must be at 6. But the hydroxyl is also ortho to the acid (position 1). Wait, the ortho positions to acid (1) are 2 and 6. So if methoxy is at 4, and the hydroxyl is at 6, then that's possible.

Wait, but the substituents ortho to acid (1) are hydroxyl and dimethylamino. So, positions 2 and 6. So, position 2 could be dimethylamino, position 6 could be hydroxyl. Wait, but I thought the hydroxyl is at 6 because it's ortho to nitrile. So that fits.

So let me list the substituents:

1: Carboxylic acid (COOH)
2: Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2)
3: Carbaldehyde (CHO)
4: Methoxy (OCH3)
5: Cyano (CN)
6: Hydroxyl (OH)

So the substituents are at positions 1 (COOH), 2 (N(CH3)2), 3 (CHO), 4 (OCH3), 5 (CN), 6 (OH).

Wait, but the carboxylic acid is at 1. The positions are arranged as follows:

Positions:

1: COOH
2: N(CH3)2
3: CHO
4: OCH3
5: CN
6: OH

Wait, but let me think about the numbering again. The main functional group is the carboxylic acid, so it gets the lowest number. So the ring is numbered such that the COOH is at position 1.

Now, the other substituents are meta to each other. So the COOH, CHO, and CN are all meta. So starting at 1 (COOH), the next meta would be position 3, which is CHO, and the next meta from there is position 5, which is CN. So that's correct.

Now, the substituents ortho to COOH (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. Those are N(CH3)2 and OH. So position 2 is N(CH3)2, position 6 is OH.

Then, the methoxy (OCH3) is para to COOH, which is position 4.

The methoxy and the hydroxyl (OCH3 and OH) are both ortho to the nitrile (CN at 5). The nitrile is at 5. So the ortho positions are 4 and 6. Methoxy is at 4, so OH is at 6. That's correct.

So the substituents are:

1: COOH
2: N(CH3)2
3: CHO
4: OCH3
5: CN
6: OH

Now, I need to write the IUPAC name based on this arrangement.

The parent chain is benzoic acid, so the substituents are numbered according to their positions.

The substituents and their positions:

Position 2: dimethylamino (N(CH3)2)
Position 3: formyl (CHO)
Position 4: methoxy (OCH3)
Position 5: cyano (CN)
Position 6: hydroxyl (OH)

So the substituents in order of numbering priority: The substituents are listed in alphabetical order. The substituents are:

1. COOH (the parent chain is benzoic acid, so it's part of the name, not a substituent)
2. dimethylamino (N(CH3)2)
3. formyl (CHO)
4. methoxy (OCH3)
5. cyano (CN)
6. hydroxyl (OH)

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the substituents are the groups attached to the ring besides the COOH. So in IUPAC naming, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but their positions are given based on their order of priority.

Wait, no, I think the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but their positions are in the order of their occurrence around the ring, but... Wait, perhaps I should think about the substituent order in the name.

For benzoic acid derivatives, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions. So the order would be based on the substituent names, ignoring the prefixes like 'hydroxy' or 'methoxy'.

So the substituents are:

- Cyano (CN): comes from the word "cyano", so starts with C.
- Dimethylamino: starts with D.
- Formyl: starts with F.
- Hydroxyl: starts with H.
- Methoxy: starts with M.
Wait, no, the substituents are actually:

Wait, the substituent groups are:

- OCH3 (methoxy)
- N(CH3)2 (dimethylamino)
- CHO (formyl)
- CN (cyano)
- OH (hydroxyl)

So the alphabetical order of the substituents is:

C (cyano), D (dimethylamino), F (formyl), H (hydroxyl), M (methoxy).

Wait, no, wait. Let me list the substituents' prefixes:

- Cyano: cyano
- Dimethylamino: dimethylamino
- Formyl: formyl
- Hydroxyl: hydroxy
- Methoxy: methoxy

So the order in alphabetical order would be:

Cyano (C), Dimethylamino (D), Formyl (F), Hydroxy (H), Methoxy (M).

Wait, but methoxy starts with M, which comes after H, so the order is C, D, F, H, M.

Wait, but wait, the substituents are actually:

Wait, the substituents in the name will be listed in alphabetical order. So the order is:

C comes before D, F, H, M.

So the substituents are: 3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

Wait, but wait, their positions are:

At position 2: dimethylamino (so 2-(dimethylamino))

Position 3: formyl (3-formyl)

Position 4: methoxy (4-methoxy)

Position 5: cyano (5-cyano)

Position 6: hydroxyl (6-hydroxy)

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck:

Position 2: N(CH3)2 → 2-(dimethylamino)

Position 3: CHO → 3-formyl

Position 4: OCH3 →4-methoxy

Position 5: CN →5-cyano

Position 6: OH →6-hydroxy

So the substituents in order of their positions (from 2 to 6) would be:

2-(dimethylamino), 3-formyl, 4-methoxy, 5-cyano, 6-hydroxy.

But when writing the IUPAC name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, not in the order of their positions.

So the prefix order would be:

cyano (C), dimethylamino (D), formyl (F), hydroxy (H), methoxy (M).

So the substituent order in the name would be:

3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

Wait, but let me think again. The substituent prefixes are:

- 2-(dimethylamino)
- 3-formyl
- 4-methoxy
- 5-cyano
-6-hydroxy.

But when listing them alphabetically, it's cyano (C), dimethylamino (D), formyl (F), hydroxy (H), methoxy (M).

So the substituent order in the name would be:

3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy, 4-methoxy.

Wait, but the substituent positions also matter in the numbering. Let me see the example.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

Hmm, that would mean substituents in the order: 2-hydroxy, 3-cyano, 4-methoxy,5-formyl,6-NMe2.

But according to the substituent order, the first substituent alphabetically is cyano (3-cyano), then dimethylamino (6-dimethylamino), then formyl (5-formyl), then hydroxy (2-hydroxy), then methoxy (4-methoxy).

Wait, but in the IUPAC name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, but their positions are given as per their numbering. So the name would start with the substituent that comes first alphabetically, but the order in the name isn't necessarily the same as the substituent positions.

So the correct order of substituents in the name would be:

3-cyano, 6-(dimethylamino), 5-formyl, 2-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about how the substituents are arranged in the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

So substituents in the order: 3-cyano, 6-NMe2,5-formyl,2-OH,4-OCH3.

That's the order I was thinking.

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

So order: 2-OH,3-CN,4-OCH3,5-CHO,6-NMe2.

Which would be according to substituent positions, not alphabetical order.

Option D: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

That's substituents at 5-CN,2-NMe2,3-CHO,6-OH,4-OCH3.

So the substituent order would be: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, methoxy, hydroxy? No, not sure.

Wait, the IUPAC name lists substituents in alphabetical order. So the order of substituents in the name should be:

cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

But wait, what about the substituent 'hydroxy'? It's at position 2 in the correct arrangement.

Wait, but in the substituent list, the order is based on the substituent names, not their positions. So the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of where they are on the ring.

So, the substituents are:

3-cyano → cyano comes first.

Then, 6-(dimethylamino) → dimethylamino starts with D.

Then, 5-formyl → formyl starts with F.

Then, 2-hydroxy → hydroxy starts with H.

Then,4-methoxy → methoxy starts with M.

So the name would be: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Looking at the options:

Option A is exactly that: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

But wait, let me check the other options.

Option B is 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid. So the substituents are in the order of hydroxy, cyano, methoxy, formyl, dimethylamino. That doesn't follow alphabetical order.

Option D is 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid. The substituents are 5-CN,2-NMe2,3-CHO,6-OH,4-OCH3. So the substituent order is: CN, NMe2, CHO, OH, OCH3. But when listed alphabetically, the order would be CN, NMe2, CHO, OCH3, OH? Wait no, that's not right. Wait, the substituent 'hydroxy' (OH) comes before 'methoxy' (OCH3) because H comes before M.

Wait, but in the substituent order in the name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order of the prefix. So the prefixes are:

- Cyano (C)
- Dimethylamino (D)
- Formyl (F)
- Hydroxy (H)
- Methoxy (M)

So the correct order in the name is: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Wait no, wait. Wait, the substituents are:

3-cyano → cyano

6-(dimethylamino) → dimethylamino

5-formyl → formyl

2-hydroxy → hydroxy

4-methoxy → methoxy.

So the substituents in the name would be listed in the order of cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy. So their positions are 3,6,5,2,4.

So the name would be: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Looking at the options, that's option A.

But wait, let me check option B again.

Option B is 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

So substituents are in the order hydroxy, cyano, methoxy, formyl, dimethylamino. Which is wrong for alphabetical order.

Option D: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

So substituents are cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy. That's the correct order, but their positions are 5,2,3,6,4.

Wait, but in our structure, the substituents are:

3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino,5-formyl,2-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

So substituent order is cyano (3), dimethylamino (6), formyl (5), hydroxy (2), methoxy (4). So when writing the name, the substituents' positions are in the order of their substituent prefixes, not their position numbers.

So the substituent list would be:

3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino,5-formyl,2-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

So the name is 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Which is option A.

Wait but I'm a bit confused because in IUPAC nomenclature, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions. So the substituent with the earliest letter comes first in the name, regardless of where it is on the ring.

So for example, if substituents are at positions 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., but the substituent named 'a' comes before 'b', 'a' is listed first in the name, regardless of position.

So the substituents to list are:

cyano (C), then dimethylamino (D), then formyl (F), then hydroxy (H), then methoxy (M).

So when writing the name, the substituents are listed in that order:

3-cyano, 6-dimethylamino,5-formyl,2-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

Which matches option A.

Wait, but looking at option D:

5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

So substituents are in the order: cyano, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Wait, that's correct in terms of alphabetical order, but the positions don't match our structure.

In our structure, the substituents are at positions 3 (CN), 6 (NMe2),5 (CHO),2 (OH),4 (OCH3).

So the substituents in the name would be:

3-cyano,6-dimethylamino,5-formyl,2-hydroxy,4-methoxy.

Which is option A.

So I think the correct answer is option A.


The molecule is a benzene ring with multiple substituents, and the task is to determine its correct IUPAC name. The substituents include a carboxylic acid (COOH), a carbaldehyde (CHO), and a cyano group (CN), which are all meta to one another. Additionally, ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl (OH) and a dimethylamino group (N(CH3)2), while para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group (OCH3). Furthermore, the methoxy and hydroxyl groups are both ortho to the cyano group.

### Step 1: Assigning positions on the benzene ring
- The carboxylic acid is assigned to position 1 (lowest number priority).
- The carbaldehyde (CHO), cyano (CN), and carboxylic acid are meta to one another, so CHO is at position 3, and CN is at position 5.
- Ortho to the carboxylic acid (position 1) are positions 2 and 6. These are assigned to the dimethylamino group (N(CH3)2) at position 2 and the hydroxyl group (OH) at position 6.
- Para to the carboxylic acid (position 1) is position 4, which is assigned to the methoxy group (OCH3).
- The methoxy (OCH3) and hydroxyl (OH) groups are both ortho to the cyano group (CN at position 5), confirming the assignments.

### Step 2: Substituents and their positions
- Position 1: Carboxylic acid (COOH).
- Position 2: Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2).
- Position 3: Carbaldehyde (CHO).
- Position 4: Methoxy (OCH3).
- Position 5: Cyano (CN).
- Position 6: Hydroxyl (OH).

### Step 3: Alphabetical order of substituents
In IUPAC nomenclature, substituents are listed in alphabetical order based on their prefixes:
- Cyano (C).
- Dimethylamino (D).
- Formyl (F).
- Hydroxy (H).
- Methoxy (M).

### Step 4: Constructing the name
The substituents are listed in alphabetical order, with their respective positions:
1. **3-cyano** (CN at position 5).
2. **6-(dimethylamino)** (N(CH3)2 at position 2).
3. **5-formyl** (CHO at position 3).
4. **2-hydroxy** (OH at position 6).
5. **4-methoxy** (OCH3 at position 4).

Thus, the correct IUPAC name is **3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**.

### Step 5: Matching with the options
- **Option A**: Matches the derived name exactly.
- **Option B**: Incorrect, as it lists substituents in the wrong order.
- **Option C**: Incorrect, as it does not match the substituent positions or order.
- **Option D**: Incorrect, as it does not match the substituent positions or order.

### Final Answer:
**Answer: A**
