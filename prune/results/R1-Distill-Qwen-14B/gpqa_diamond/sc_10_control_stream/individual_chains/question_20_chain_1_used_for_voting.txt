Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about the impulse approximation in nuclear calculations. Hmm, I remember that the impulse approximation is an assumption made in some models where nucleons behave like they’re free. But wait, what exactly does that mean in terms of the assumptions?

The question lists four assumptions, and I need to figure out which three jointly imply the impulse approximation. Let me go through each option step by step.

First, I'll quickly recap what I know about the impulse approximation. I think it's used in models where each nucleon in the nucleus is treated as if it's a free particle, not considering the interactions with the other nucleons much beyond a single collision. So it's like each interaction is treated as an impulse, a short, sharp disturbance. 

The question gives four possible assumptions, and I need to determine which three support this idea. Let me look at each one:

1. Interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons. 
   - So this would mean the force acts on each nucleon separately, not considering other nucleons much. That sounds like it supports the idea because each nucleon is treated individually, similar to being free.

2. The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon.
   - Transparency probably means that other nucleons don't play a role except for the one being considered. So the nucleus only interacts through that one nucleon, implying others are treated as if they don't affect the process. That makes sense as an assumption for the impulse approximation because you're only considering a single interaction.

3. The quarks inside the selected nucleon are non-relativistic.
   - Hmm, this one is interesting. Non-relativistic quarks would mean that the internal structure of the nucleon doesn't involve relativistic effects. So maybe this assumption is about treating the nucleon as a simple, static object rather than considering its internal dynamics. But how does that tie into the impulse approximation? I'm not sure yet.

4. The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces.
   - Oh, right, because in the impulse approximation, the nucleon is treated as if it's free, so there's no consideration of the binding forces that hold the nucleus together. So this assumption directly supports the approximation.

Now, the question is which three of these four assumptions together imply the impulse approximation. Let's think about each possible combination in the options.

Option A: 1,2,4. So the interaction acts on individual nucleons, the nucleus is transparent except for that one, and no binding forces. That seems to fit because each nucleon is treated individually, others are ignored, and the binding is neglected. So this set might imply the approximation.

Option B: 2,3,4. The nucleus is transparent, quarks are non-relativistic, and no binding. The non-relativistic quarks part, I'm not sure how it contributes. Perhaps it's more about the internal structure of the nucleon, not about interactions with others. So maybe this isn't directly about the impulse approximation.

Option C: 1,2,3. Interaction with individual, transparent nucleus, and non-relativistic quarks. Hmm, I'm not sure if the quarks' state is directly tied to the impulse approximation. Maybe it's more about the nucleon's behavior, but I'm not certain.

Option D: 1,3,4. Interaction with individual, non-relativistic quarks, and no binding. Again, the non-relativistic quarks part is unclear to me. It might not directly contribute to the approximation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, what's the impulse approximation again? It's when you neglect the internal structure of the nucleus and treat each nucleon as if it were free. So each interaction is treated as an impulse with no consideration of the rest of the nucleus.

So, the key assumptions would be that each nucleon interacts individually (1), the nucleus is transparent except for that nucleon (2), and that the nucleon isn't bound (4). Because if the nucleon is bound, you'd have to consider its motion within the nucleus, which complicates things.

So 1,2,4 would be the correct trio. That's option A.

What about 3? The quarks being non-relativistic. I think that's more about the internal state of the nucleon, perhaps making it easier to model, but not directly about the interaction with other nucleons. So it's not a necessary condition for the impulse approximation concerning the interactions between nucleons.

So the correct answer should be option A: 1,2,4.

The impulse approximation in nuclear calculations assumes that nucleons behave as free particles, neglecting their interactions with the rest of the nucleus. To determine which assumptions jointly imply this approximation, let us analyze the given options:

1. **The interaction current only interacts with individual nucleons**: This assumption supports the idea that each nucleon is treated independently, as in the impulse approximation.

2. **The nucleus is transparent apart from the selected nucleon**: This means that the nucleus is treated as if it only interacts through a single nucleon, aligning with the impulse approximation by ignoring the effects of other nucleons.

3. **The quarks internal to the selected nucleon are non-relativistic**: This assumption pertains to the internal structure of the nucleon and does not directly contribute to the treatment of interactions between nucleons. It is less relevant to the impulse approximation.

4. **The interaction proceeds as if the selected nucleon experiences no binding forces**: This directly aligns with the impulse approximation, as it neglects the binding forces that would otherwise complicate the treatment of nucleons.

From this analysis, the assumptions that jointly imply the impulse approximation are **1, 2, and 4**, as they focus on treating each nucleon individually and neglecting interactions with the rest of the nucleus. The assumption about non-relativistic quarks (3) is not directly relevant to the impulse approximation.
