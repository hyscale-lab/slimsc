Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about cosmology, specifically involving quasars and the Lambda-CDM model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in near-infrared and optical. Before that peak, at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm, the flux drops significantly. I remember that when quasars emit light that's redshifted, the peak might shift into the infrared. So this peak could be a telltale sign of redshift.

Wait, so 790 nm is near-infrared. In optical, visible light is about 400-700 nm. So if the peak is at 790, maybe it's redshifted from the rest frame. What's the typical emission line for quasars? Oh right, the Lyman alpha emission line is around 121 nm in the ultraviolet. But if it's observed at 790 nm, that would mean a significant redshift.

So the formula for redshift z is observed wavelength λ_obs = (1 + z) * λ_rest. Let me compute z first. λ_rest for Lyman alpha is 121.6 nm. Observed is 790 nm. So z = (790 / 121.6) - 1. Let me calculate that. 790 divided by 121.6 is about 6.5, so z is approximately 5.5. Wait, wait, 121.6 * 6 = 729.6. 121.6 * 6.5 is 790.4. Oh, so z is 5.5 exactly.

Now, knowing the redshift, we can find the comoving distance. The comoving distance D_C is given by the integral from 0 to z of c / (H0 * E(z')) dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda). Given the parameters: H0=70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_lambda=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ω_k=0).

So, E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7). For z=5.5, (1+z)^3 is (6.5)^3 = 274.625. So 0.3 * 274.625 is 82.3875. Add 0.7* (some term?), wait, no. Wait, E(z) is sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + (Ω_lambda + Ω_cdm)(1+z)^3? No, wait. The dark energy density parameter is Ω_lambda=0.7, which is a constant, not scaling with (1+z). So E(z) is sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda). Wait, no, dark energy is sometimes considered as a cosmological constant, so its density doesn't change with redshift. So the expression is correct.

Wait, the correct formula for E(z) in a flat universe (Ω_r <<1, so ignore) is sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda). Because for a flat universe, Ω_m + Ω_lambda = 1 (since Ω_k=0). So Ω_lambda is 0.7, Ω_m is 0.3. So for z=5.5, E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(6.5)^3 + 0.7) = sqrt(0.3*274.625 + 0.7) = sqrt(82.3875 + 0.7) = sqrt(83.0875) ≈ 9.115.

Wait, 83.0875 squared is about 9.115 because 9^2 is 81, 9.1^2 is 82.81, 9.11^2 is about 83.0, so yeah, around 9.11.

So the integral becomes D_C = c / H0 * ∫ from 0 to z [1 / E(z')] dz'.

But integrating over z' from 0 to 5.5. Hmm, this integral is a bit tricky. I remember that for high redshifts, the integral can be approximated or maybe we can look up a standard approximation. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use an online calculator or a standard formula, but since I can't do that right now, I'll think about how to approximate it.

Alternatively, one can use an approximate expression for the comoving distance for matter-dominated and dark energy-dominated eras. But when z is high, like 5.5, the universe is matter-dominated. Let me see: the matter density scales as (1+z)^3, and dark energy is constant. So at z=5.5, (1+z)^3 is 274.625, so Ω_m*(1+z)^3 is 0.3 * 274.625 ≈82.3875. Compared to Ω_lambda=0.7, which is much smaller. So actually, E(z) is dominated by the matter term. So E(z) is roughly sqrt(82.3875) ≈9.08. So for high z, E(z) is approximately sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3) = sqrt(0.3) * (1+z)^(3/2). So the integrand becomes [1/(sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^(3/2)))].

So the integral ∫0^z dz' (1+z')^(-3/2) = ∫(1+z')^(-3/2) dz' = -2 (1+z')^(-1/2) ) evaluated from 0 to z.

So ∫0^z dz' [1/(E(z') ) ] ≈ ∫0^z [1/(sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^(3/2)) ) ] dz' 

= (1/sqrt(0.3)) ∫0^z (1+z')^(-3/2) dz'

Let u = 1 + z' → du = dz'

Limits become u=1 to u=1+z.

Integral becomes (1/sqrt(0.3)) ∫1^{1+z} u^(-3/2) du 

= (1/sqrt(0.3)) [ (-2) u^(-1/2) ) ] from 1 to 1+z

= (1/sqrt(0.3)) [ (-2)(1/(sqrt(1+z)) ) + 2(1/sqrt(1)) ) ]

= (2/sqrt(0.3)) [ 1 - 1/(sqrt(1+z)) ]

So 1/sqrt(0.3) is about 1.732. So 2 * 1.732 ≈3.464.

So the integral ≈3.464 [1 - 1/sqrt(6.5)].

Because 1+z=6.5, so sqrt(6.5) is about 2.55.

So 1/sqrt(6.5) ≈ 0.392.

So 1 - 0.392 = 0.608.

So the integral ≈ 3.464 * 0.608 ≈ 2.104.

Then D_C = c / H0 * integral.

H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. c is 3e5 km/s.

So c/H0 = (3e5) / 70 ≈4285.7 Mpc.

Then D_C = 4285.7 Mpc * 2.104 ≈9025 Mpc.

Wait, that's about 9 Gpc because 1 Gpc is 1000 Mpc. 9025 Mpc is 9.025 Gpc.

Wait, but wait. I made an approximation assuming E(z) is dominated by matter. But at z=5.5, the dark energy term is much smaller, so the approximation is valid.

But wait, another approach: the comoving distance for high redshifts in a matter-dominated universe is (c/H0) * (2/(3√Ω_m)) (1 - (1/(1+z))^(3/2) )

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the standard formula for comoving distance in a flat ΛCDM universe. The exact expression involves integrating 1/E(z') from 0 to z.

But since the integral can't be expressed in a simple analytical form, people often use look-up tables or numerical integration.

But perhaps I can recall some standard values or approximate the integral.

Wait, another way: compute the lookback time and then use the relation between lookback time and comoving distance.

Wait, another way is to realize that for z=5.5, the comoving distance is approximately calculated using the formula:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_lambda)] dz'

But without doing the integral numerically, it's hard to get an exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate it.

Alternatively, it's known that for a matter-dominated universe (Ω_m=1, Ω_lambda=0), the comoving distance is (2c/H0) * (1/(√Ω_m)) (1/(1+z)) ) * something.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to some standard values.

But maybe I can use the approximation formula for comoving distance. Let me check:

An approximate formula for comoving distance in a flat ΛCDM universe is:

D_C = (c / H0) * [ (2/√Ω_m) (1/(1+z)) ) * F(z) ]

Where F(z) is a function that accounts for dark energy. But I'm not exactly sure about this.

Alternatively, I remember that at high redshifts (z>>1), the dark energy term becomes negligible, so the universe is matter-dominated, and the comoving distance can be approximated as:

D_C ≈ (c / H0) * (2/(3√Ω_m)) (1 - 1/(1+z)^(3/2)) )

Wait, for z=5.5, 1/(1+z)^(3/2) is 1/(6.5)^(1.5) ≈ 1/(6.5*sqrt(6.5)) )

6.5 is about 2.55 squared. So sqrt(6.5)≈2.55. So 6.5 * 2.55 ≈16.575, so 1/16.575≈0.06.

So 1 - 0.06 = 0.94.

So, 2/(3 * sqrt(0.3)) ) * 0.94.

What's sqrt(0.3)? Approximately 0.5477.

So 2/(3*0.5477) ≈ 2/(1.643) ≈1.217.

Multiply by 0.94: 1.217 * 0.94 ≈1.147.

So D_C ≈ (c / H0) * 1.147.

c is 3e5 km/s, H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.

c/H0 = 3e5 /70 ≈4285.7 Mpc.

Multiply by 1.147: 4285.7 *1.147 ≈4285.7 *1.15 is about 4922.5, which is 4.92 Gpc. But this seems lower than the earlier approximation.

Wait, that can't be right. Because for z=5.5, the comoving distance should be higher than for lower redshifts. Let me think: for z=1, D_C is about 2 Gpc, for higher z, it increases.

Wait, perhaps my method is wrong. Let me think again. For the matter-dominated approximation, the comoving distance for z is given by:

D_C = (c / H0) * (2/(3 sqrt(Ω_m)) ) * (1 - (1/(1+z)^(3/2)) )

But that's only for a matter-only universe. In our case, since dark energy is present, the comoving distance would be larger than in a matter-only universe because dark energy accelerates expansion, making the universe expand more at later times, which affects the comoving distance.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, dark energy causes acceleration, which affects the expansion history. Let me think: for a given redshift, in a universe with dark energy, the comoving distance is larger than in a matter-only universe because the expansion is faster at later times, which affects the integral.

Wait, no, maybe not. Because for high z, the universe is matter-dominated, so at z=5.5, dark energy's effect is less significant. So the approximation with matter-only gives a lower bound on D_C.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the integral numerically, despite being time-consuming.

Alternatively, I can use the approximation formula for comoving distance in a flat universe with matter and dark energy.

I found an equation for comoving distance in a flat universe:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫0^z [ 1 / sqrt(Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_lambda) ] dz'

But without doing numerical integration, it's hard. So I'll try to estimate.

Let me split the integral into two parts: from z=0 to z=3, where dark energy becomes significant, and from z=3 to 5.5 where matter dominates less.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that D_C is roughly ~ (c/H0) * (z / sqrt(Ω_m (1 + z)^3 + Ω_lambda)) )

But that's probably not accurate.

Wait, another approach: look for an approximation formula or an online calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for z=1, D_C is about 2 Gpc, for z=2, maybe 4 Gpc, z=3, about 6 Gpc, z=4, ~8 Gpc, and z=5.5, around 10 Gpc? Wait, that doesn't seem right because the expansion is accelerating, so after a certain point, the comoving distance doesn't increase as fast per unit redshift.

Wait, another way: I can use the formula for the age of the universe and then use Hubble's law, but perhaps that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, I can think about using the approximation.

Let me try to compute the integral numerically.

The integral is ∫0^5.5 [1 / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7) ] dz'

I'll approximate this integral using a few points.

Let me make a table of z' and the integrand.

z' : 0 → 1 → 2 →3 →4 →5 →5.5

Compute E(z') = sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7 )

At z'=0: E= sqrt(0.3 + 0.7)=1. So integrand is 1.

z'=1: (1+1)=2^3=8 → 0.3*8=2.4 → 2.4 +0.7=3.1 → sqrt(3.1)=1.760 → integrand 1/1.760≈0.568

z'=2: (3)^3=27 →0.3*27=8.1 →8.1 +0.7=8.8 → sqrt(8.8)=2.966 → integrand 0.337

z'=3: (4)^3=64 →0.3*64=19.2 →19.2+0.7=19.9 →sqrt(19.9)=4.461 → integrand≈0.224

z'=4: (5)^3=125 →0.3*125=37.5 →37.5 +0.7=38.2 →sqrt(38.2)=6.18 → integrand≈0.162

z'=5: (6)^3=216 →0.3*216=64.8 →64.8 +0.7=65.5 →sqrt(65.5)=8.093 → integrand≈0.1236

z'=5.5: (6.5)^3=274.625 →0.3*274.625=82.3875 →82.3875 +0.7=83.0875 →sqrt(83.0875)=9.115 → integrand≈0.1097

Now, let's approximate the integral using the trapezoidal rule.

Divide the interval [0,5.5] into 5 intervals with widths:

z' from 0 to 5.5, each interval being 1.1 units? Wait, no, earlier I took points at 0,1,2,3,4,5,5.5. So the intervals are 1 unit each except the last which is 0.5 units.

So the step sizes are:

0→1: 1 step

1→2: 1 step

2→3: 1 step

3→4: 1 step

4→5: 1 step

5→5.5: 0.5 step

So the trapezoidal rule for each interval is (f(z_i) + f(z_{i+1})) * (Δz) / 2.

Calculating each part:

1. 0→1: (1 + 0.568) * 1 * 0.5 = (1.568)*0.5=0.784

2. 1→2: (0.568 + 0.337) *1 *0.5 → (0.905)*0.5=0.4525

3. 2→3: (0.337 +0.224)*1 *0.5= (0.561)*0.5=0.2805

4. 3→4: (0.224 +0.162)*1 *0.5= (0.386)*0.5=0.193

5. 4→5: (0.162 +0.1236)*1 *0.5= (0.2856)*0.5=0.1428

6. 5→5.5: (0.1236 +0.1097)*0.5 *0.5 → 0.2333 *0.25 ≈0.058325

Sum all these up:

0.784 + 0.4525 = 1.2365

+0.2805 →1.517

+0.193 →1.71

+0.1428 →1.8528

+0.0583 →1.9111.

So the integral is approximately 1.9111.

Wait, but this is integrating from 0 to 5.5, so the value is about 1.9111.

Wait, but in reality, the trapezoidal rule with only 6 points is a rough approximation. The actual integral could be a bit higher or lower. Let's see, perhaps another method would be Simpson's rule, which is more accurate.

But for the sake of time, perhaps the integral is approximately 1.9.

So D_C = (c / H0) * integral.

c=3e5 km/s, H0=70 km/s/Mpc.

c/H0 = 3e5 /70 ≈4285.7 Mpc.

Multiply by 1.9111: 4285.7 *1.9111 ≈8188 Mpc → about 8.19 Gpc.

Looking at the options, 8 Gpc is option B, 7 is D, 9 is C. So the closest is option B (8 Gpc).

Wait, but earlier approximations suggested around 9 Gpc, but this trapezoidal method got 8.19 Gpc. Hmm. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral calculation. Let me check the trapezoidal steps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using a higher number of intervals would give a better approximation. But that's time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a table or an online calculator for comoving distance.

Wait, I recall that the comoving distance for z=5.5 in the standard cosmology (H0=70, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_lambda=0.7) is approximately 8 Gpc. So the answer would be B) 8 Gpc.

But another thought: perhaps the peak at 790 nm isn't Lyman alpha. Wait, what if the peak is from another emission line. Let me think. If the rest wavelength is longer, then the redshift would be lower. For example, if the rest wavelength is in the optical, say around 700 nm (red light), then 790 nm would mean a lower z.

Wait, but the problem states that the peak is in near-infrared and optical. So the peak is at 790 nm. If that's the rest wavelength, then no redshift. But that's unlikely because the flux drops below 790 nm. So perhaps it's a redshifted peak.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the peak is due to the Balmer break or something else. But I think the initial approach with considering Lyman alpha is correct.

So, the comoving distance is approximately 8 Gpc.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the comoving distance of a quasar in a Lambda-CDM universe, given its observed peak at 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. The redshift is calculated using the formula:

\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1
\]

Assuming the rest wavelength corresponds to the Lyman alpha emission line (\(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = 121.6 \, \text{nm}\)), the redshift is:

\[
z = \frac{790}{121.6} - 1 \approx 5.5
\]

The comoving distance \(D_C\) is given by:

\[
D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\lambda}} \, dz'
\]

where \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\), \(H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc}\), \(\Omega_m = 0.3\), and \(\Omega_\lambda = 0.7\). The integral is challenging to evaluate analytically, so numerical approximations or standard cosmological tools are typically used. 

For \(z = 5.5\), the universe is matter-dominated at high redshifts, and the integral is dominated by the matter term. Approximations suggest that the comoving distance for such a redshift in the given cosmology is approximately \(8 \, \text{Gpc}\). This aligns with option B.

Thus, the comoving distance of the quasar from the Earth is approximately **8 Gpc**.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about cosmology, specifically involving quasars and the Lambda-CDM model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think through this step by step.

The question says that observations of a quasar show a peak at 790 nm in near-infrared and optical. Before that peak, at wavelengths shorter than 790 nm, the flux drops significantly. I remember that when quasars emit light that's redshifted, the peak might shift into the infrared. So this peak could be a telltale sign of redshift.

Wait, so 790 nm is near-infrared. In optical, visible light is about 400-700 nm. So if the peak is at 790, maybe it's redshifted from the rest frame. What's the typical emission line for quasars? Oh right, the Lyman alpha emission line is around 121 nm in the ultraviolet. But if it's observed at 790 nm, that would mean a significant redshift.

So the formula for redshift z is observed wavelength λ_obs = (1 + z) * λ_rest. Let me compute z first. λ_rest for Lyman alpha is 121.6 nm. Observed is 790 nm. So z = (790 / 121.6) - 1. Let me calculate that. 790 divided by 121.6 is about 6.5, so z is approximately 5.5. Wait, wait, 121.6 * 6 = 729.6. 121.6 * 6.5 is 790.4. Oh, so z is 5.5 exactly.

Now, knowing the redshift, we can find the comoving distance. The comoving distance D_C is given by the integral from 0 to z of c / (H0 * E(z')) dz', where E(z) = sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda). Given the parameters: H0=70 km/s/Mpc, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_lambda=0.7, and the universe is flat (so Ω_k=0).

So, E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(1+z)^3 + 0.7). For z=5.5, (1+z)^3 is (6.5)^3 = 274.625. So 0.3 * 274.625 is 82.3875. Add 0.7* (some term?), wait, no. Wait, E(z) is sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + (Ω_lambda + Ω_cdm)(1+z)^3? No, wait. The dark energy density parameter is Ω_lambda=0.7, which is a constant, not scaling with (1+z). So E(z) is sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda). Wait, no, dark energy is sometimes considered as a cosmological constant, so its density doesn't change with redshift. So the expression is correct.

Wait, the correct formula for E(z) in a flat universe (Ω_r <<1, so ignore) is sqrt(Ω_m*(1+z)^3 + Ω_lambda). Because for a flat universe, Ω_m + Ω_lambda = 1 (since Ω_k=0). So Ω_lambda is 0.7, Ω_m is 0.3. So for z=5.5, E(z) = sqrt(0.3*(6.5)^3 + 0.7) = sqrt(0.3*274.625 + 0.7) = sqrt(82.3875 + 0.7) = sqrt(83.0875) ≈ 9.115.

Wait, 83.0875 squared is about 9.115 because 9^2 is 81, 9.1^2 is 82.81, 9.11^2 is about 83.0, so yeah, around 9.11.

So the integral becomes D_C = c / H0 * ∫ from 0 to z [1 / E(z')] dz'.

But integrating over z' from 0 to 5.5. Hmm, this integral is a bit tricky. I remember that for high redshifts, the integral can be approximated or maybe we can look up a standard approximation. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use an online calculator or a standard formula, but since I can't do that right now, I'll think about how to approximate it.

Alternatively, one can use an approximate expression for the comoving distance for matter-dominated and dark energy-dominated eras. But when z is high, like 5.5, the universe is matter-dominated. Let me see: the matter density scales as (1+z)^3, and dark energy is constant. So at z=5.5, (1+z)^3 is 274.625, so Ω_m*(1+z)^3 is 0.3 * 274.625 ≈82.3875. Compared to Ω_lambda=0.7, which is much smaller. So actually, E(z) is dominated by the matter term. So E(z) is roughly sqrt(82.3875) ≈9.08. So for high z, E(z) is approximately sqrt(Ω_m (1+z)^3) = sqrt(0.3) * (1+z)^(3/2). So the integrand becomes [1/(sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^(3/2)))].

So the integral ∫0^z dz' (1+z')^(-3/2) = ∫(1+z')^(-3/2) dz' = -2 (1+z')^(-1/2) ) evaluated from 0 to z.

So ∫0^z dz' [1/(E(z') ) ] ≈ ∫0^z [1/(sqrt(0.3) (1+z')^(3/2)) ) ] dz' 

= (1/sqrt(0.3)) ∫0^z (1+z')^(-3/2) dz'

Let u = 1 + z' → du = dz'

Limits become u=1 to u=1+z.

Integral becomes (1/sqrt(0.3)) ∫1^{1+z} u^(-3/2) du 

= (1/sqrt(0.3)) [ (-2) u^(-1/2) ) ] from 1 to 1+z

= (1/sqrt(0.3)) [ (-2)(1/(sqrt(1+z)) ) + 2(1/sqrt(1)) ) ]

= (2/sqrt(0.3)) [ 1 - 1/(sqrt(1+z)) ]

So 1/sqrt(0.3) is about 1.732. So 2 * 1.732 ≈3.464.

So the integral ≈3.464 [1 - 1/sqrt(6.5)].

Because 1+z=6.5, so sqrt(6.5) is about 2.55.

So 1/sqrt(6.5) ≈ 0.392.

So 1 - 0.392 = 0.608.

So the integral ≈ 3.464 * 0.608 ≈ 2.104.

Then D_C = c / H0 * integral.

H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc. c is 3e5 km/s.

So c/H0 = (3e5) / 70 ≈4285.7 Mpc.

Then D_C = 4285.7 Mpc * 2.104 ≈9025 Mpc.

Wait, that's about 9 Gpc because 1 Gpc is 1000 Mpc. 9025 Mpc is 9.025 Gpc.

Wait, but wait. I made an approximation assuming E(z) is dominated by matter. But at z=5.5, the dark energy term is much smaller, so the approximation is valid.

But wait, another approach: the comoving distance for high redshifts in a matter-dominated universe is (c/H0) * (2/(3√Ω_m)) (1 - (1/(1+z))^(3/2) )

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the standard formula for comoving distance in a flat ΛCDM universe. The exact expression involves integrating 1/E(z') from 0 to z.

But since the integral can't be expressed in a simple analytical form, people often use look-up tables or numerical integration.

But perhaps I can recall some standard values or approximate the integral.

Wait, another way: compute the lookback time and then use the relation between lookback time and comoving distance.

Wait, another way is to realize that for z=5.5, the comoving distance is approximately calculated using the formula:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫0^z [1 / sqrt(Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_lambda)] dz'

But without doing the integral numerically, it's hard to get an exact value. Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate it.

Alternatively, it's known that for a matter-dominated universe (Ω_m=1, Ω_lambda=0), the comoving distance is (2c/H0) * (1/(√Ω_m)) (1/(1+z)) ) * something.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to some standard values.

But maybe I can use the approximation formula for comoving distance. Let me check:

An approximate formula for comoving distance in a flat ΛCDM universe is:

D_C = (c / H0) * [ (2/√Ω_m) (1/(1+z)) ) * F(z) ]

Where F(z) is a function that accounts for dark energy. But I'm not exactly sure about this.

Alternatively, I remember that at high redshifts (z>>1), the dark energy term becomes negligible, so the universe is matter-dominated, and the comoving distance can be approximated as:

D_C ≈ (c / H0) * (2/(3√Ω_m)) (1 - 1/(1+z)^(3/2)) )

Wait, for z=5.5, 1/(1+z)^(3/2) is 1/(6.5)^(1.5) ≈ 1/(6.5*sqrt(6.5)) )

6.5 is about 2.55 squared. So sqrt(6.5)≈2.55. So 6.5 * 2.55 ≈16.575, so 1/16.575≈0.06.

So 1 - 0.06 = 0.94.

So, 2/(3 * sqrt(0.3)) ) * 0.94.

What's sqrt(0.3)? Approximately 0.5477.

So 2/(3*0.5477) ≈ 2/(1.643) ≈1.217.

Multiply by 0.94: 1.217 * 0.94 ≈1.147.

So D_C ≈ (c / H0) * 1.147.

c is 3e5 km/s, H0 is 70 km/s/Mpc.

c/H0 = 3e5 /70 ≈4285.7 Mpc.

Multiply by 1.147: 4285.7 *1.147 ≈4285.7 *1.15 is about 4922.5, which is 4.92 Gpc. But this seems lower than the earlier approximation.

Wait, that can't be right. Because for z=5.5, the comoving distance should be higher than for lower redshifts. Let me think: for z=1, D_C is about 2 Gpc, for higher z, it increases.

Wait, perhaps my method is wrong. Let me think again. For the matter-dominated approximation, the comoving distance for z is given by:

D_C = (c / H0) * (2/(3 sqrt(Ω_m)) ) * (1 - (1/(1+z)^(3/2)) )

But that's only for a matter-only universe. In our case, since dark energy is present, the comoving distance would be larger than in a matter-only universe because dark energy accelerates expansion, making the universe expand more at later times, which affects the comoving distance.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, dark energy causes acceleration, which affects the expansion history. Let me think: for a given redshift, in a universe with dark energy, the comoving distance is larger than in a matter-only universe because the expansion is faster at later times, which affects the integral.

Wait, no, maybe not. Because for high z, the universe is matter-dominated, so at z=5.5, dark energy's effect is less significant. So the approximation with matter-only gives a lower bound on D_C.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the integral numerically, despite being time-consuming.

Alternatively, I can use the approximation formula for comoving distance in a flat universe with matter and dark energy.

I found an equation for comoving distance in a flat universe:

D_C = (c / H0) * ∫0^z [ 1 / sqrt(Ω_m (1+z')^3 + Ω_lambda) ] dz'

But without doing numerical integration, it's hard. So I'll try to estimate.

Let me split the integral into two parts: from z=0 to z=3, where dark energy becomes significant, and from z=3 to 5.5 where matter dominates less.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation that D_C is roughly ~ (c/H0) * (z / sqrt(Ω_m (1 + z)^3 + Ω_lambda)) )

But that's probably not accurate.

Wait, another approach: look for an approximation formula or an online calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for z=1, D_C is about 2 Gpc, for z=2, maybe 4 Gpc, z=3, about 6 Gpc, z=4, ~8 Gpc, and z=5.5, around 10 Gpc? Wait, that doesn't seem right because the expansion is accelerating, so after a certain point, the comoving distance doesn't increase as fast per unit redshift.

Wait, another way: I can use the formula for the age of the universe and then use Hubble's law, but perhaps that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, I can think about using the approximation.

Let me try to compute the integral numerically.

The integral is ∫0^5.5 [1 / sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7) ] dz'

I'll approximate this integral using a few points.

Let me make a table of z' and the integrand.

z' : 0 → 1 → 2 →3 →4 →5 →5.5

Compute E(z') = sqrt(0.3*(1+z')^3 + 0.7 )

At z'=0: E= sqrt(0.3 + 0.7)=1. So integrand is 1.

z'=1: (1+1)=2^3=8 → 0.3*8=2.4 → 2.4 +0.7=3.1 → sqrt(3.1)=1.760 → integrand 1/1.760≈0.568

z'=2: (3)^3=27 →0.3*27=8.1 →8.1 +0.7=8.8 → sqrt(8.8)=2.966 → integrand 0.337

z'=3: (4)^3=64 →0.3*64=19.2 →19.2+0.7=19.9 →sqrt(19.9)=4.461 → integrand≈0.224

z'=4: (5)^3=125 →0.3*125=37.5 →37.5 +0.7=38.2 →sqrt(38.2)=6.18 → integrand≈0.162

z'=5: (6)^3=216 →0.3*216=64.8 →64.8 +0.7=65.5 →sqrt(65.5)=8.093 → integrand≈0.1236

z'=5.5: (6.5)^3=274.625 →0.3*274.625=82.3875 →82.3875 +0.7=83.0875 →sqrt(83.0875)=9.115 → integrand≈0.1097

Now, let's approximate the integral using the trapezoidal rule.

Divide the interval [0,5.5] into 5 intervals with widths:

z' from 0 to 5.5, each interval being 1.1 units? Wait, no, earlier I took points at 0,1,2,3,4,5,5.5. So the intervals are 1 unit each except the last which is 0.5 units.

So the step sizes are:

0→1: 1 step

1→2: 1 step

2→3: 1 step

3→4: 1 step

4→5: 1 step

5→5.5: 0.5 step

So the trapezoidal rule for each interval is (f(z_i) + f(z_{i+1})) * (Δz) / 2.

Calculating each part:

1. 0→1: (1 + 0.568) * 1 * 0.5 = (1.568)*0.5=0.784

2. 1→2: (0.568 + 0.337) *1 *0.5 → (0.905)*0.5=0.4525

3. 2→3: (0.337 +0.224)*1 *0.5= (0.561)*0.5=0.2805

4. 3→4: (0.224 +0.162)*1 *0.5= (0.386)*0.5=0.193

5. 4→5: (0.162 +0.1236)*1 *0.5= (0.2856)*0.5=0.1428

6. 5→5.5: (0.1236 +0.1097)*0.5 *0.5 → 0.2333 *0.25 ≈0.058325

Sum all these up:

0.784 + 0.4525 = 1.2365

+0.2805 →1.517

+0.193 →1.71

+0.1428 →1.8528

+0.0583 →1.9111.

So the integral is approximately 1.9111.

Wait, but this is integrating from 0 to 5.5, so the value is about 1.9111.

Wait, but in reality, the trapezoidal rule with only 6 points is a rough approximation. The actual integral could be a bit higher or lower. Let's see, perhaps another method would be Simpson's rule, which is more accurate.

But for the sake of time, perhaps the integral is approximately 1.9.

So D_C = (c / H0) * integral.

c=3e5 km/s, H0=70 km/s/Mpc.

c/H0 = 3e5 /70 ≈4285.7 Mpc.

Multiply by 1.9111: 4285.7 *1.9111 ≈8188 Mpc → about 8.19 Gpc.

Looking at the options, 8 Gpc is option B, 7 is D, 9 is C. So the closest is option B (8 Gpc).

Wait, but earlier approximations suggested around 9 Gpc, but this trapezoidal method got 8.19 Gpc. Hmm. Where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral calculation. Let me check the trapezoidal steps.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using a higher number of intervals would give a better approximation. But that's time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for a table or an online calculator for comoving distance.

Wait, I recall that the comoving distance for z=5.5 in the standard cosmology (H0=70, Ω_m=0.3, Ω_lambda=0.7) is approximately 8 Gpc. So the answer would be B) 8 Gpc.

But another thought: perhaps the peak at 790 nm isn't Lyman alpha. Wait, what if the peak is from another emission line. Let me think. If the rest wavelength is longer, then the redshift would be lower. For example, if the rest wavelength is in the optical, say around 700 nm (red light), then 790 nm would mean a lower z.

Wait, but the problem states that the peak is in near-infrared and optical. So the peak is at 790 nm. If that's the rest wavelength, then no redshift. But that's unlikely because the flux drops below 790 nm. So perhaps it's a redshifted peak.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the peak is due to the Balmer break or something else. But I think the initial approach with considering Lyman alpha is correct.

So, the comoving distance is approximately 8 Gpc.


The question involves determining the comoving distance of a quasar in a Lambda-CDM universe, given its observed peak at 790 nm in the near-infrared and optical spectrum. The redshift is calculated using the formula:

\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1
\]

Assuming the rest wavelength corresponds to the Lyman alpha emission line (\(\lambda_{\text{rest}} = 121.6 \, \text{nm}\)), the redshift is:

\[
z = \frac{790}{121.6} - 1 \approx 5.5
\]

The comoving distance \(D_C\) is given by:

\[
D_C = \frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{1}{\sqrt{\Omega_m (1+z')^3 + \Omega_\lambda}} \, dz'
\]

where \(c = 3 \times 10^5 \, \text{km/s}\), \(H_0 = 70 \, \text{km/s/Mpc}\), \(\Omega_m = 0.3\), and \(\Omega_\lambda = 0.7\). The integral is challenging to evaluate analytically, so numerical approximations or standard cosmological tools are typically used. 

For \(z = 5.5\), the universe is matter-dominated at high redshifts, and the integral is dominated by the matter term. Approximations suggest that the comoving distance for such a redshift in the given cosmology is approximately \(8 \, \text{Gpc}\). This aligns with option B.

Thus, the comoving distance of the quasar from the Earth is approximately **8 Gpc**.

Answer: B
