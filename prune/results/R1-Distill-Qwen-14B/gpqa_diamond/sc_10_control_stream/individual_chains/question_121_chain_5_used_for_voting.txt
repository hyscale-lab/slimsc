Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again. It's about the reaction of a saturated epoxide with an organocuprate, specifically Me2CuLi. The question is about determining the product formed when (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane reacts under these conditions.

Hmm, I remember that when epoxides react with nucleophiles like organocuprates, it's an example of nucleophilic ring-opening of epoxides. The general rule is that the nucleophile will attack the less hindered carbon. Also, the problem states that in disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile is added.

So the starting material is a bicyclic compound, 7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane. Let me try to visualize the structure. Bicyclo [4.1.0] heptane would have two rings. The numbering is a bit tricky. The 7-oxa indicates an oxygen in place of a carbon at position 7, so that's the oxygen in the epoxide ring.

The substituents are 1R,3R,4R,6S. Wait, the structure might be such that the epoxide is part of the bridge. Let me sketch this mentally. Bicyclo [4.1.0] heptane: one bridge is four carbons long, another has one, and the third bridge is zero. Wait, no, wait. Bicyclo notation is bicyclo[a.b.c], where a ≥ b ≥ c. So [4.1.0] would have two bridges: one with four carbons, one with one, and the third with zero. Wait, maybe I should draw it.

The molecule is 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, meaning the oxygen is at position 7, and it's part of the epoxide. The substituents are 1,3,4-trimethyl. So positions 1,3,4 each have a methyl group, and the configuration is 1R,3R,4R,6S. Wait, 6S is another substituent? Or is 6 the position of the oxygen?

Wait, no. The molecule is 7-oxabicyclo, so the oxygen is at position 7. The positions are 1,3,4,6 as substituents. Wait, the formula is (1R,3R,4R,6S). So the 6S is another substituent. Hmm, maybe it's a bridge structure where position 6 is a bridgehead.

Let me think. So in the bicyclo structure, the two bridgeheads are positions 1 and 4. Because in a bicyclo[m.n.p], the bridgeheads are positions 1 and (m+1) or something like that. Wait, maybe I should refer to the general bicyclo structure. For bicyclo[m.n.p], the bridges have m, n, p carbons respectively, with the bridgeheads at 1 and the next positions.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of the structure as a norbornene-derived epoxide. Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1], but this is [4.1.0], so maybe a different structure.

Alternatively, the molecule has a 4-membered ring and a 1-membered bridge, which doesn't make much sense. Hmm, perhaps it's a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, so the two bridges are four carbons and one carbon. So the structure would have a bridge of four carbons and another bridge of one carbon, making a norbornane-like structure but different.

Wait, perhaps it's more helpful to think about the structure in terms of chair-like conformations or something else. Alternatively, maybe I can imagine the epoxide as part of a bridge, and the reaction will open it in a specific way.

So when the epoxide ring is opened by Me2CuLi, which is a strong nucleophile, the attack occurs at the less hindered carbon. Also, the configuration inverts at the attacked carbon.

The starting molecule has substituents at 1,3,4,6. It's (1R,3R,4R,6S). So the positions might be arranged such that the epoxide is between carbons 6 and 7? No, 7 is the oxygen. Wait, no, the epoxide is between two carbons, say 6 and another. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is between positions 6 and 1.

Wait, the molecule is 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. So the structure has seven atoms in total, with an oxygen at position 7. Let me try to imagine the structure. The bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane has a bridge that is four carbons long, another that is one (a single bridgehead), and the third bridge is zero.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think that the molecule is a bicyclo system where the epoxide oxygen is at a bridgehead. So the epoxide would be between two bridgehead carbons. For example, in norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene), the double bond is between two bridgeheads.

In this case, the epoxide is between two bridgehead carbons. So when the organocuprate attacks, it will open the epoxide by attacking the less hindered bridgehead.

Since the molecule is a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, the structure might have one bridge with four carbons and another bridge with one carbon. So the bridgeheads are at positions 1 and 6, perhaps. So the epoxide is between 1 and 6.

Wait, the epoxide is at position 7, so maybe the oxygen is between 1 and 6. So the epoxide is 1,6-epoxide in this bicyclo system.

So the molecule has 1R,3R,4R,6S configurations. So when Me2CuLi is added, which is a strong nucleophile (a Gilman reagent), the nucleophilic attack occurs at the less hindered carbon.

Looking at the epoxide, which bridgehead is more hindered? Let's see: position 1 is R, position 3 and 4 are R, and position 6 is S. So the substituents around the epoxide ring. If the epoxide is between 1 and 6, which of those is more substituted?

If the structure is a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, the bridge between 1 and 6 is four carbons (so a longer bridge) and the other bridge is one carbon. So position 1 is connected via a four-carbon bridge to position 6, and position 6 is connected via a one-carbon bridge to another position.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as having two bridgehead carbons: 1 and 6. The bridge between them is four carbons (so that's a longer bridge), and the other bridge (the smaller one) is one carbon, connecting 6 to another position. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can proceed without knowing the exact structure.

In any case, the key is that the nucleophile will attack the less hindered carbon. So which carbon is less hindered? The one with fewer substituents.

Looking at the starting molecule, position 1 has a methyl group (1R), position 3 has a methyl, position 4 has a methyl, and position 6 has a substituent (S configuration). Wait, but what's the structure around the epoxide? The substituents on the epoxide carbons (probably 1 and 6) would influence which is more hindered.

Assuming the epoxide is between 1 and 6, which of those two is more substituted? Let's say position 1 is connected to substituents like methyl groups at 1,3,4. Position 6 is S but perhaps has substituents as well.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the reaction. When the epoxide ring opens, the nucleophile (Me-) attacks the less hindered carbon, and the configuration inverts at that carbon.

Once the attack occurs, the oxygen becomes an alcohol group (since the cuprate provides the methyl group as a nucleophile, and the epoxide oxygen will get the proton after workup, or perhaps the mechanism is more complex).

Wait, no. Let me think about the mechanism. The organocuprate (Me2CuLi) will donate a methyl group as a nucleophile. The attack occurs at the less hindered epoxide carbon, leading to ring opening.

The ring opening of an epoxide by a nucleophile typically involves the nucleophile attacking one carbon, causing the oxygen to form a negative charge, which then gets protonated. But in the case of cuprates, perhaps the mechanism is a bit different, but the regiochemistry is dominated by the less hindered site.

After the nucleophile attacks, the configuration at that carbon inverts. So if the carbon was R, it becomes S, and vice versa.

But since the problem states that in disubstituted epoxides, inversion occurs at the carbon where Nu is added. So if the starting epoxide is disubstituted, which it probably is here, then the configuration will invert.

So, focusing on the starting epoxide, the two carbons (let's say C1 and C6) each have their substituents. The attack happens at the less hindered one, say C1. The configuration at C1 will invert.

Now, after the attack, the product will have a methyl group added to C1, and the oxygen will be connected to C6. Then, the ring opens, leading to a cyclohexanol derivative, perhaps.

Wait, the product is a cyclohexanol, so the initial bicyclic structure may open up into a cyclohexane ring with substituents.

Let me try to think about the structure of the product. The starting material is a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with an epoxide. When the epoxide opens, the ring becomes a cyclohexane with substituents.

But perhaps the bicyclo structure upon ring-opening becomes a cyclohexanol with various substituents.

So, the four substituents are the methyl groups at positions 1,3,4, and another at 6 (since the starting molecule is 1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo).

Wait, but in the product, the positions may shift. Let me think about the ring-opening. The epoxide (O) was between C1 and C6. The nucleophile (Me-) attacks C1, which is less hindered. Then, the ring opens, forming a new structure.

After the attack, the structure becomes a cyclohexane ring, perhaps, with substituents at 1 (Me from attack), 3,4, and another substituent from C6.

Wait, but in the bicyclo structure, the other bridge would have been a four-carbon bridge. Upon opening, the ring would expand.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a substituted cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.

Looking at the options:

Options are all tetramethylcyclohexanol derivatives.

Option B: (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

Wait, but the starting molecule has methyl groups at 1,3,4,6. After opening, perhaps some of these become substituents on the cyclohexanol.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups from the bicyclo structure become substituents, and the new methyl from the cuprate is added.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry.

The starting molecule is (1R,3R,4R,6S). When the cuprate adds the methyl to the less hindered carbon (say, C1, which is R configuration), then the configuration at C1 will invert to S. But wait, what about the other substituents?

Wait, perhaps it's better to assign the configuration after the attack, considering the inversion.

Assuming the attack happens at C1 (the less hindered site), then the configuration at C1 inverts. So if it was R before, it becomes S.

But the starting configuration at C1 is R. So after attack, it becomes S.

In the product, the substituents would be:

- The new methyl from the cuprate at C1 (now S configuration).

- The methyl groups at C3 and C4 remain as they were. Wait, but perhaps upon ring-opening, the positions change.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering of the product is different because the ring has opened. So the numbering might shift, so the substituents change positions.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to draw the structure.

The starting structure: bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with an epoxide (7-oxa). So positions 1 and 6 are bridgeheads, connected via an epoxide (O).

Me2CuLi will attack the less hindered of 1 or 6. Let's assume it attacks 1, which is R. Then, the configuration inverts to S.

After attack, the methyl group is added to 1, and the structure opens into a cyclohexane ring.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclohexanol, with substituents at positions 1 (new methyl), 2 (from C3), 4, and 5 (from C6). Or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has four methyl groups: three from the starting molecule (1,3,4) and one added from the cuprate (at position 2 or something).

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B is (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. So substituents at 2 (two methyl), 4,5.

Hmm. So perhaps during the ring-opening, the substituents from positions 1,3,4,6 are renumbered into the cyclohexane structure.

But I'm not entirely confident about the exact positional numbering. Alternatively, maybe I should focus on the stereochemistry.

The starting molecule has 1R,3R,4R,6S configuration. After the attack at C1 (which is R), the configuration at that carbon inverts to S.

In the product, the substituents would then be at positions 1 (S), 2 (from 3), 4, and another position.

Wait, but the product options have varying configurations.

Option B is (1R,4R,5R). Hmm, but 1R suggests that the configuration didn't invert. That's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the attack doesn't occur at position 1. Maybe it occurs at position 6, which is S. That would mean the configuration inverts to R.

So if the nucleophile attacks 6, which is S, the configuration becomes R.

Then, in the product, the substituents would be:

- Position 1: original configuration R, but perhaps now becomes a different position.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the bridge structure wrong. Maybe the attack is at the less substituted carbon, which is position 6.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack is at the carbon which is less bulky. If the starting molecule has substituents at 1,3,4,6, then perhaps position 6, being S, is less hindered than position 1 (R), which has more substituents.

Wait, but how does the configuration influence the steric hindrance? Maybe position 1 is more substituted (since it's R and has methyl groups nearby), making it more hindered. So the attack would be at position 6, which is S and perhaps less hindered.

If the attack is at position 6 (S), then the configuration inverts to R.

So now, the product would have a methyl group added at position 6, which was S and becomes R.

But how does that translate into the structure of the product cyclohexanol?

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck because I can't visualize the structure. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the product.

The product is a cyclohexanol derivative, with four methyl groups. The options have varying configurations.

Assuming the product's configuration after inversion, let's say the attack is at position 6 (originally S), which becomes R.

Then, the substituents would be at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 perhaps.

Looking at the options, option B is (1R,4R,5R). So substituents at positions 1,4,5, and 2 (two methyls). Wait, no, the substituents are 2,2,4,5.

So, 2 has two methyl groups. How does that happen? Maybe the nucleophilic attack brings in a methyl group adjacent to another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the bicyclo structure upon ring-opening results in a cyclohexane where the substituents at 2,4,5 are methyl, and another methyl at 2, making it 2,2,4,5-tetramethyl.

But how does that happen?

Wait, perhaps the original substituents are at 1,3,4,6. Upon opening the epoxide, the substituents at 3 and 4 become 2 and 5 in the product.

Alternatively, maybe the numbering shifts due to the ring opening.

I think I'm getting stuck on the structural analysis. Let me try to think about the possible products.

The starting molecule's substituents are at 1,3,4,6. After opening, the methyl from the cuprate will be added to one of the epoxide carbons. The other substituents (from 3 and 4) may end up on adjacent carbons in the cyclohexane.

So the product would have four methyl groups: the original ones at 3 and 4, plus the new methyl from the cuprate, and perhaps the 6 substituent becomes another position.

Wait, but the product options have four methyl groups. So perhaps the product has substituents at 2,2,4,5.

Let me see: option A is 2,2,4,5; option B is 2,2,4,5 as well.

Wait, no. Looking back, option A is (1S,4R,5S) with substituents 2,2,4,5. Option B is (1R,4R,5R) same substituents.

So the main difference between A and B is the configuration at positions 1 and 5.

So, after the attack, when the epoxide opens, the configuration at the attacked carbon inverts. If the attack was at position 6, which was S before, then it becomes R.

In the product, the substituents from the original 1,3,4,6 may become 2,4,5, and the new methyl.

Wait, perhaps the product's substituents are at positions 2,4,5, and another at 2 (so 2,2,4,5).

If the attack is at position 6 (S), now R, then in the product, this may correspond to position 5R.

Positions 3 and 4 in the starting material would become positions 2 and 4 in the product.

So, the substituents would have:

- Position 2: methyl (from position 3)

- Position 4: methyl (from position 4)

- Position 5: methyl (from position 6, now R)

- Position 2: another methyl (from the attack of the cuprate at position 6, but how?)

Wait, maybe the attack brings the methyl to position 2, leading to two methyl groups there.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl from the cuprate adds to position 2, and the original 3 and 4 substituents are now at 2 and 4, leading to two methyls at 2.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about the product's configuration.

Assuming the attack occurs at position 6, which inverts from S to R. Then, in the product, the substituents are:

- Position 2: methyl (from 3)

- Position 4: methyl (from 4)

- Position 5: methyl (from 6, now R)

- Position 2: methyl (from the cuprate attack)

So, that gives two methyl groups at 2, and one each at 4 and 5. Which matches the substituents in option A and B.

Now, the configuration at position 1: in the starting material, it was R. After the ring opening, what happens to this position?

Wait, perhaps the original position 1 becomes position 1 in the product. So if the attack was at 6, which becomes position 5, and 1 remains as 1.

So, in the product's configuration:

- Position 1: original configuration R.

- Position 2: from 3 and 4?

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the positions again.

Alternatively, perhaps the original position 6 becomes position 5 in the product. So the configuration at 5 is R, as it was S before.

Wait, that's possible. So the product has:

- Position 1: R (unchanged)

- Position 2: two methyl groups (from 3 and cuprate attack)

- Position 4: R (from 4)

- Position 5: R (from 6, which was S and inverted to R)

So, the configuration would be 1R,4R,5R.

So the product would have substituents at 2,2,4,5, and configuration at 1R,4R,5R.

Looking at the options, option B is (1R,4R,5R), which matches.

So the correct product is option B.

When saturated epoxides react with organocuprates, the nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring, and inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile is added. The starting material, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, is a bicyclic compound with an epoxide ring. The reaction with Me₂CuLi results in nucleophilic ring-opening, forming a cyclohexanol derivative.

The key steps are as follows:

1. **Structure of the Starting Material**: The bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane framework has two bridgeheads at positions 1 and 6, with the epoxide oxygen at position 7. The substituents are:
   - Methyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 4.
   - A substituent at position 6 with S configuration.

2. **Regiochemistry of the Reaction**: The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide. Position 6 is less hindered compared to position 1, so the attack occurs at position 6.

3. **Inversion of Configuration**: The configuration at the attacked carbon (position 6) inverts from S to R.

4. **Product Formation**: After the ring-opening, the bicyclic structure converts into a cyclohexane ring. The substituents in the product are:
   - A methyl group from the nucleophile at position 2.
   - Methyl groups from the original substituents at positions 2, 4, and 5.
   - The configuration of the product is determined by the inversion at position 6 and the retention of configurations at other positions.

5. **Final Configuration**: The product has the following configuration:
   - Position 1: Retains R configuration.
   - Position 2: Two methyl groups (from the nucleophile and the original substituent at position 3).
   - Position 4: Retains R configuration.
   - Position 5: Becomes R due to inversion at position 6.

6. **Matching the Options**: The product matches option B, which is (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again. It's about the reaction of a saturated epoxide with an organocuprate, specifically Me2CuLi. The question is about determining the product formed when (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane reacts under these conditions.

The general rule is that the nucleophile will attack the less hindered carbon. Also, the problem states that in disubstituted epoxides, inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile is added.

So the starting material is a bicyclic compound, 7-oxabicyclo [4.1.0] heptane. Let me try to visualize the structure. Bicyclo [4.1.0] heptane would have two rings. The numbering is a bit tricky. The 7-oxa indicates an oxygen in place of a carbon at position 7, so that's the oxygen in the epoxide ring.

The substituents are 1R,3R,4R,6S. Wait, the structure might be such that the epoxide is part of the bridge. Let me sketch this mentally. Bicyclo [4.1.0] heptane: one bridge is four carbons long, another has one, and the third bridge is zero. Wait, no, wait. Bicyclo notation is bicyclo[a.b.c], where a ≥ b ≥ c. So [4.1.0] would have two bridges: one with four carbons, one with one, and the third with zero. Wait, maybe I should draw it.

The molecule is 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, meaning the oxygen is at position 7, and it's part of the epoxide. The substituents are 1,3,4-trimethyl. So positions 1,3,4 each have a methyl group, and the configuration is 1R,3R,4R,6S. Wait, 6S is another substituent? Or is 6 the position of the oxygen?

Wait, no. The molecule is 7-oxabicyclo, so the oxygen is at position 7. The positions are 1,3,4,6 as substituents. Wait, the formula is (1R,3R,4R,6S). So the 6S is another substituent. Hmm, maybe it's a bridge structure where position 6 is a bridgehead.

Let me think. So in the bicyclo structure, the two bridgeheads are positions 1 and 4. Because in a bicyclo[m.n.p], the bridgeheads are positions 1 and (m+1) or something like that. Wait, maybe I should refer to the general bicyclo structure. For bicyclo[m.n.p], the bridges have m, n, p carbons respectively, with the bridgeheads at 1 and the next positions.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of the structure as a norbornene-derived epoxide. Norbornene is bicyclo[2.2.1], but this is [4.1.0], so maybe a different structure.

Alternatively, the molecule has a 4-membered ring and a 1-membered bridge, which doesn't make much sense. Hmm, perhaps it's a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, so the two bridges are four carbons and one carbon. So the structure would have a bridge of four carbons and another bridge of one carbon, making a norbornane-like structure but different.

Wait, perhaps it's more helpful to think about the structure in terms of chair-like conformations or something else. Alternatively, maybe I can imagine the epoxide as part of a bridge, and the reaction will open it in a specific way.

So when the epoxide ring is opened by Me2CuLi, which is a strong nucleophile, the attack occurs at the less hindered carbon. Also, the configuration inverts at the attacked carbon.

The starting molecule has substituents at 1,3,4,6. It's (1R,3R,4R,6S). So the positions might be arranged such that the epoxide is between carbons 6 and 7? No, 7 is the oxygen. Wait, no, the epoxide is between two carbons, say 6 and another. Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide is between positions 6 and 1.

Wait, the molecule is 7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. So the structure has seven atoms in total, with an oxygen at position 7. Let me try to imagine the structure. The bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane has a bridge that is four carbons long, another that is one (a single bridgehead), and the third bridge is zero.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think that the molecule is a bicyclo system where the epoxide oxygen is at a bridgehead. So the epoxide would be between two bridgehead carbons. For example, in norbornene (bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene), the double bond is between two bridgeheads.

In this case, the epoxide is between two bridgehead carbons. So when the organocuprate attacks, it will open the epoxide by attacking the less hindered bridgehead.

Since the molecule is a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, the structure might have one bridge with four carbons and another bridge with one carbon. So the bridgeheads are at positions 1 and 6, perhaps. So the epoxide is between 1 and 6.

Wait, the epoxide is at position 7, so maybe the oxygen is between 1 and 6. So the epoxide is 1,6-epoxide in this bicyclo system.

So the molecule has 1R,3R,4R,6S configurations. So when Me2CuLi is added, which is a strong nucleophile (a Gilman reagent), the nucleophilic attack occurs at the less hindered carbon.

Looking at the epoxide, which bridgehead is more hindered? Let's see: position 1 is R, position 3 and 4 are R, and position 6 is S. So the substituents around the epoxide ring. If the epoxide is between 1 and 6, which of those is more substituted?

If the structure is a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, the bridge between 1 and 6 is four carbons (so a longer bridge) and the other bridge is one carbon. So position 1 is connected via a four-carbon bridge to position 6, and position 6 is connected via a one-carbon bridge to another position.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as having two bridgehead carbons: 1 and 6. The bridge between them is four carbons (so that's a longer bridge), and the other bridge (the smaller one) is one carbon, connecting 6 to another position. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but perhaps I can proceed without knowing the exact structure.

In any case, the key is that the nucleophile will attack the less hindered carbon. So which carbon is less hindered? The one with fewer substituents.

Looking at the starting molecule, position 1 has a methyl group (1R), position 3 has a methyl, position 4 has a methyl, and position 6 has a substituent (S configuration). Wait, but what's the structure around the epoxide? The substituents on the epoxide carbons (probably 1 and 6) would influence which is more hindered.

Assuming the epoxide is between 1 and 6, which of those two is more substituted? Let's say position 1 is connected to substituents like methyl groups at 1,3,4. Position 6 is S but perhaps has substituents as well.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the reaction. When the epoxide ring opens, the nucleophile (Me-) attacks the less hindered carbon, and the configuration inverts at that carbon.

Once the attack occurs, the oxygen becomes an alcohol group (since the cuprate provides the methyl group as a nucleophile, and the epoxide oxygen will get the proton after workup, or perhaps the mechanism is more complex).

Wait, no. Let me think about the mechanism. The organocuprate (Me2CuLi) will donate a methyl group as a nucleophile. The attack occurs at the less hindered epoxide carbon, leading to ring opening.

The ring opening of an epoxide by a nucleophile typically involves the nucleophile attacking one carbon, causing the oxygen to form a negative charge, which then gets protonated. But in the case of cuprates, perhaps the mechanism is a bit different, but the regiochemistry is dominated by the less hindered site.

After the nucleophile attacks, the configuration at that carbon inverts. So if the carbon was R, it becomes S, and vice versa.

But since the problem states that in disubstituted epoxides, inversion occurs at the carbon where Nu is added. So if the starting epoxide is disubstituted, which it probably is here, then the configuration will invert.

So, focusing on the starting epoxide, the two carbons (let's say C1 and C6) each have their substituents. The attack happens at the less hindered one, say C1. The configuration at C1 will invert.

Now, after the attack, the product will have a methyl group added to C1, and the oxygen will be connected to C6. Then, the ring opens, leading to a cyclohexanol derivative, perhaps.

Wait, the product is a cyclohexanol, so the initial bicyclic structure may open up into a cyclohexane ring with substituents.

Let me try to think about the structure of the product. The starting material is a bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with an epoxide. When the epoxide opens, the ring becomes a cyclohexane with substituents.

But perhaps the bicyclo structure upon ring-opening becomes a cyclohexanol with various substituents.

So, the four substituents are the methyl groups at positions 1,3,4, and another at 6 (since the starting molecule is 1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo).

Wait, but in the product, the positions may shift. Let me think about the ring-opening. The epoxide (O) was between C1 and C6. The nucleophile (Me-) attacks C1, which is less hindered. Then, the ring opens, forming a new structure.

After the attack, the structure becomes a cyclohexane ring, perhaps, with substituents at 1 (Me from attack), 3,4, and another substituent from C6.

Wait, but in the bicyclo structure, the other bridge would have been a four-carbon bridge. Upon opening, the ring would expand.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a substituted cyclohexanol with four methyl groups.

Looking at the options:

Options are all tetramethylcyclohexanol derivatives.

Option B: (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.

Wait, but the starting molecule has methyl groups at 1,3,4,6. After opening, perhaps some of these become substituents on the cyclohexanol.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl groups from the bicyclo structure become substituents, and the new methyl from the cuprate is added.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry.

The starting molecule is (1R,3R,4R,6S). When the cuprate adds the methyl to the less hindered carbon (say, C1, which is R configuration), then the configuration at C1 will invert to S. But wait, what about the other substituents?

Wait, perhaps it's better to assign the configuration after the attack, considering the inversion.

Assuming the attack happens at C1 (the less hindered site), then the configuration at C1 inverts. So if it was R before, it becomes S.

But the starting configuration at C1 is R. So after attack, it becomes S.

In the product, the substituents would be:

- The new methyl from the cuprate at C1 (now S configuration).

- The methyl groups at C3 and C4 remain as they were. Wait, but perhaps upon ring-opening, the positions change.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbering of the product is different because the ring has opened. So the numbering might shift, so the substituents change positions.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to draw the structure.

The starting structure: bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane with an epoxide (7-oxa). So positions 1 and 6 are bridgeheads, connected via an epoxide (O).

Me2CuLi will attack the less hindered of 1 or 6. Let's assume it attacks 1, which is R. Then, the configuration inverts to S.

After attack, the methyl group is added to 1, and the structure opens into a cyclohexane ring.

Wait, maybe the product is a cyclohexanol, with substituents at positions 1 (new methyl), 2 (from C3), 4, and 5 (from C6). Or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has four methyl groups: three from the starting molecule (1,3,4) and one added from the cuprate (at position 2 or something).

Wait, looking at the options:

Option B is (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol. So substituents at 2 (two methyl), 4,5.

Hmm. So perhaps during the ring-opening, the substituents from positions 1,3,4,6 are renumbered into the cyclohexane structure.

But I'm not entirely confident about the exact positional numbering. Alternatively, maybe I should focus on the stereochemistry.

The starting molecule has 1R,3R,4R,6S configuration. After the attack at C1 (which is R), the configuration at that carbon inverts to S.

In the product, the substituents would then be at positions 1 (S), 2 (from 3), 4, and another position.

Wait, but the product options have varying configurations.

Option B is (1R,4R,5R). Hmm, but 1R suggests that the configuration didn't invert. That's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the attack doesn't occur at position 1. Maybe it occurs at position 6, which is S. That would mean the configuration inverts to R.

So if the nucleophile attacks 6, which is S, the configuration becomes R.

Then, in the product, the substituents would be:

- Position 1: original configuration R, but perhaps now becomes a different position.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the bridge structure wrong. Maybe the attack is at the less substituted carbon, which is position 6.

Alternatively, perhaps the attack is at the carbon which is less bulky. If the starting molecule has substituents at 1,3,4,6, then perhaps position 6, being S, is less hindered than position 1 (R), which has more substituents.

Wait, but how does the configuration influence the steric hindrance? Maybe position 1 is more substituted (since it's R and has methyl groups nearby), making it more hindered. So the attack would be at position 6, which is S and perhaps less hindered.

If the attack is at position 6 (S), then the configuration inverts to R.

So now, the product would have a methyl group added at position 6, which was S and becomes R.

But how does that translate into the structure of the product cyclohexanol?

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck because I can't visualize the structure. Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the product.

The product is a cyclohexanol derivative, with four methyl groups. The options have varying configurations.

Assuming the product's configuration after inversion, let's say the attack is at position 6 (originally S), which becomes R.

Then, the substituents would be at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 perhaps.

Looking at the options, option B is (1R,4R,5R). So substituents at positions 1,4,5, and 2 (two methyls). Wait, no, the substituents are 2,2,4,5.

So, 2 has two methyl groups. How does that happen? Maybe the nucleophilic attack brings in a methyl group adjacent to another substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the bicyclo structure upon ring-opening results in a cyclohexane where the substituents at 2,4,5 are methyl, and another methyl at 2, making it 2,2,4,5-tetramethyl.

But how does that happen?

Wait, perhaps the original substituents are at 1,3,4,6. Upon opening the epoxide, the substituents at 3 and 4 become 2 and 5 in the product.

Alternatively, maybe the numbering shifts due to the ring opening.

I think I'm getting stuck on the structural analysis. Let me try to think about the possible products.

The starting molecule's substituents are at 1,3,4,6. After opening, the methyl from the cuprate will be added to one of the epoxide carbons. The other substituents (from 3 and 4) may end up on adjacent carbons in the cyclohexane.

So the product would have four methyl groups: the original ones at 3 and 4, plus the new methyl from the cuprate, and perhaps the 6 substituent becomes another position.

Wait, but the product options have four methyl groups. So perhaps the product has substituents at 2,2,4,5.

Let me see: option A is 2,2,4,5; option B is 2,2,4,5 as well.

Wait, no. Looking back, option A is (1S,4R,5S) with substituents 2,2,4,5. Option B is (1R,4R,5R) same substituents.

So the main difference between A and B is the configuration at positions 1 and 5.

So, after the attack, when the epoxide opens, the configuration at the attacked carbon inverts. If the attack was at position 6, which was S before, then it becomes R.

In the product, the substituents from the original 1,3,4,6 may become 2,4,5, and the new methyl.

Wait, perhaps the product's substituents are at positions 2,4,5, and another at 2 (so 2,2,4,5).

If the attack is at position 6 (S), now R, then in the product, this may correspond to position 5R.

Positions 3 and 4 in the starting material would become positions 2 and 4 in the product.

So, the substituents would have:

- Position 2: methyl (from position 3)

- Position 4: methyl (from position 4)

- Position 5: methyl (from position 6, now R)

- Position 2: another methyl (from the attack of the cuprate at position 6, but how?)

Wait, maybe the attack brings the methyl to position 2, leading to two methyl groups there.

Alternatively, perhaps the methyl from the cuprate adds to position 2, and the original 3 and 4 substituents are now at 2 and 4, leading to two methyls at 2.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about the product's configuration.

Assuming the attack occurs at position 6, which inverts from S to R. Then, in the product, the substituents are:

- Position 2: methyl (from 3)

- Position 4: methyl (from 4)

- Position 5: methyl (from 6, now R)

- Position 2: methyl (from the cuprate attack)

So, that gives two methyl groups at 2, and one each at 4 and 5. Which matches the substituents in option A and B.

Now, the configuration at position 1: in the starting material, it was R. After the ring opening, what happens to this position?

Wait, perhaps the original position 1 becomes position 1 in the product. So if the attack was at 6, which becomes position 5, and 1 remains as 1.

So, in the product's configuration:

- Position 1: original configuration R.

- Position 2: from 3 and 4?

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the positions again.

Alternatively, perhaps the original position 6 becomes position 5 in the product. So the configuration at 5 is R, as it was S before.

Wait, that's possible. So the product has:

- Position 1: R (unchanged)

- Position 2: two methyl groups (from 3 and cuprate attack)

- Position 4: R (from 4)

- Position 5: R (from 6, which was S and inverted to R)

So, the configuration would be 1R,4R,5R.

So the product would have substituents at 2,2,4,5, and configuration at 1R,4R,5R.

Looking at the options, option B is (1R,4R,5R), which matches.

So the correct product is option B.


When saturated epoxides react with organocuprates, the nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide ring, and inversion of configuration occurs at the carbon where the nucleophile is added. The starting material, (1R,3R,4R,6S)-1,3,4-trimethyl-7-oxabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, is a bicyclic compound with an epoxide ring. The reaction with Me₂CuLi results in nucleophilic ring-opening, forming a cyclohexanol derivative.

The key steps are as follows:

1. **Structure of the Starting Material**: The bicyclo[4.1.0]heptane framework has two bridgeheads at positions 1 and 6, with the epoxide oxygen at position 7. The substituents are:
   - Methyl groups at positions 1, 3, and 4.
   - A substituent at position 6 with S configuration.

2. **Regiochemistry of the Reaction**: The nucleophile (Me⁻) attacks the less hindered carbon of the epoxide. Position 6 is less hindered compared to position 1, so the attack occurs at position 6.

3. **Inversion of Configuration**: The configuration at the attacked carbon (position 6) inverts from S to R.

4. **Product Formation**: After the ring-opening, the bicyclic structure converts into a cyclohexane ring. The substituents in the product are:
   - A methyl group from the nucleophile at position 2.
   - Methyl groups from the original substituents at positions 2, 4, and 5.
   - The configuration of the product is determined by the inversion at position 6 and the retention of configurations at other positions.

5. **Final Configuration**: The product has the following configuration:
   - Position 1: Retains R configuration.
   - Position 2: Two methyl groups (from the nucleophile and the original substituent at position 3).
   - Position 4: Retains R configuration.
   - Position 5: Becomes R due to inversion at position 6.

6. **Matching the Options**: The product matches option B, which is (1R,4R,5R)-2,2,4,5-tetramethylcyclohexan-1-ol.
