Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and its ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm. Let me try to wrap my head around it.

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, I think that means in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center.

Wait, no, wait. Oh right, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So that must be the relative speed between the two frames. So if I'm in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving towards me at 60,000 km/s.

But wait, the problem is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, right, that's time dilation. Because the two frames are moving relative to each other, their time measurements might differ.

So, I think I need to use special relativity here, specifically time dilation. Because the object (ejecta) is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, relativistic effects come into play.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Speed of ejecta relative to Galaxy (v) = 60,000 km/s. Wait, but wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 0.2c. That's 20% the speed of light, which is pretty fast, so relativistic effects are noticeable but not extreme.

Time in ejecta frame (t') = 50 seconds. We need to find the distance (d) the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame.

In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at speed v. But the time experienced in the Galaxy frame isn't the same as in the ejecta frame because of time dilation. Oh right, the proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the event. Wait, but in this case, the events are the start and end of the journey as experienced in the ejecta frame. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the problem says 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So in the ejecta's frame, the time is t' = 50 s. But we need to find the distance d in the Galaxy frame, which would be v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame (t). So d = v * t.

But how do we relate t' (ejecta's time) to t (Galaxy's time)?

From special relativity, the time experienced in the moving frame is related to the stationary frame by the Lorentz factor gamma. The equation is t = gamma * (t' + (v x')/c²), but since the motion is along one axis (x), and x' is zero in the ejecta frame (assuming the event is happening at the same point in their frame), maybe it's simpler.

Wait, the events are the start and end of the 50-second interval in the ejecta frame. So in the ejecta frame, the ejecta is stationary, and the Galaxy is moving towards it. So the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy frame would be v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy frame.

But to find t, we need to calculate the time dilation. So t' is the proper time, or is it? Wait, no. Proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the process. In this case, the process is the movement of the ejecta towards the Galaxy. So the proper time would be measured in the ejecta's frame, since the ejecta is at rest there. Therefore, t' is the proper time.

Wait, but movement is such that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving toward them. So the process from the ejecta's perspective is the Galaxy moving 60,000 km/s towards them for 50 seconds, but perhaps I should think in terms of how much distance is covered in the Galaxy frame.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the distance in the Galaxy frame. So, the ejecta moves at v = 60,000 km/s for a certain time t (in Galaxy frame). The distance would be v * t.

But t isn't 50 seconds; that's the time in the ejecta's frame. So we need to relate t and t' via time dilation.

The time dilation formula is t' = t / gamma, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So t = gamma * t'.

So first, calculate gamma.

v = 60,000 km/s = 6e4 km/s. c is 3e5 km/s.

So v² = (6e4)^2 = 3.6e9 (km^2/s^2)
c² = (3e5)^2 = 9e10 (km^2/s^2)

v²/c² = (3.6e9)/(9e10) = (3.6)/(9e1) )= 0.04. So 4%.

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So gamma is approximately 1.0206.

Therefore, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds.

So the time in the Galaxy frame is about 51.03 seconds.

Then, the distance d = v * t = 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 6e4 * 51.03.

Calculate that:

6e4 is 60,000.

60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000.

Wait, but 51.03 is 51 + 0.03. So 60,000 * 51.03 = 60,000 *51 + 60,000 *0.03 = 3,060,000 + 1,800 = 3,061,800 km.

But wait, that's not one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 2,940,000
B)3,000,000
C)2,880,000
D)3,060,000

Hmm, D is 3,060,000, which would be our approximate result if we took t as 51 s exactly. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, if t = gamma * t' = (1.0206) * 50 = 51.03 s.

v =6e4 km/s.

So 6e4 * 51.03 = ?

6e4 *50 = 3e6.

6e4 *1.03 = 60,000 * 1.03 = 61,800.

So total is 3e6 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.

But the closest option is D)3,060,000, which is 3.06e6 km. Hmm, so perhaps we need to be more precise with the gamma calculation.

Wait, perhaps I approximated gamma too roughly. Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.

0.96 is 96/100 = 24^2 / 25^2. Hmm, not directly helpful.

Alternatively, compute sqrt(0.96):

Let me compute 0.9798 squared: 0.9798 * 0.9798.

0.9798 * 0.9798 ≈ (0.98 - 0.0002)^2 ≈ 0.9604 - 2 * 0.98 * 0.0002 + (0.0002)^2 ≈ 0.9604 - 0.000392 + 0.00000004 ≈ about 0.960008.

But 0.960008 is approximately 0.96, so 0.9798^2 is 0.960008, so sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

Wait, but gamma is 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020604.

Let me calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute 1 / 0.9798.

0.9798 * 1.02 = 0.9798 *1.02 = 0.9798 + 0.019596 = 0.999396.

Hmm, but 0.9798 * 1.0206 = let me compute that more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps use a calculator approach. Let me compute gamma using more precise approximation.

The Lorentz factor gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2.

So v²/c² = 0.04. Thus, 1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

But perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can compute it using the Taylor series approximation.

sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(1 - 0.04) ≈ 1 - (0.04)/2 - ( (0.04)^2 )/(8) ) + ... 

So sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 - 0.02 - (0.0016)/8 = 1 - 0.02 - 0.0002 = 0.98 - 0.0002 = 0.9798.

Thus, gamma ≈ 1.0206.

So t = 50 * 1.0206 ≈ 51.03 s.

Thus, d = 6e4 * 51.03 = 6e4 *51 + 6e4 *0.03.

6e4 *51 = 3,060,000.

6e4 *0.03 = 1,800.

So total is 3,061,800 km.

But the options don't have this number. The closest is D)3,060,000.

Hmm. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the selection of the frame.

Wait, another thought: When the ejecta is moving at v relative to the Galaxy, the time experienced in the ejecta's frame for a certain distance would be affected by length contraction.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it from the perspective of length contraction. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at v, so the distance they have to cover is contracted.

Wait, no, because the problem is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the proper time and then relate it.

Wait, the proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the process. Since the ejecta is moving, the proper time is measured in the ejecta's frame. So t' is 50 seconds.

So in the Galaxy frame, the time is longer. So t = gamma * t'.

So d = v * t.

Yes, that's what I did before.

So in that case, the distance is 6e4 * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km.

But looking at the options, D is 3,060,000, which is close. So perhaps the calculation is approximated, and the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the gamma. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute gamma: 1/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96).

Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more precisely.

I know that 0.98^2 = 0.9604.

So sqrt(0.96) is a little less than 0.98.

Compute 0.9798^2:

= (0.98 - 0.0002)^2 = 0.98^2 - 2*0.98*0.0002 + (0.0002)^2 ≈ 0.9604 - 0.000392 + 0.00000004 ≈ 0.960008.

So sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798.

Thus, gamma = 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.020604.

So gamma is approximately 1.02064.

So t = 50 * 1.02064 ≈ 51.032 seconds.

So d = 6e4 * 51.032 = ?

6e4 *51.032 = 60,000 *51.032 = (60,000 *51) + (60,000 *0.032) )= 3,060,000 + 1,920 = 3,061,920 km.

Hmm, that's approximately 3,061,920 km. The closest option is D)3,060,000. So perhaps the intended answer is D, but I'm a bit confused because my calculation gives a higher number.

Wait, but wait—maybe I'm getting the frames mixed up. Let me think again.

Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the center of the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. So the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than the ejecta's time.

So the distance the ejecta travels is v multiplied by t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame. But t = gamma * t', so d = v * gamma * t'.

So substituting the numbers: 6e4 km/s * 1.0206 *50 s.

Wait, wait, wait a second. 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. 50 seconds.

So 6e4 *1.0206 *50.

Wait, 6e4 *50 = 3e6. Then multiplied by 1.0206 gives 3e6 *1.0206 = 3,061,800 km.

So the same as before.

So, since the options don't have 3,061,800, but option D is 3,060,000, which is the closest. So I think D is the correct answer.

Wait, but what if I made a mistake in the gamma calculation? Let me recheck.

v = 6e4 km/s.

c =3e5 km/s.

v/c = 0.2.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.0206.

Yes, right.

Wait, maybe the question is about distance in the ejecta's frame. No, no, the problem says, "what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

So the distance in Galaxy frame is d = v * t, where t is the time in Galaxy frame, which is gamma * t'.

So d = 6e4 * 50 * gamma.

Wait, so 6e4 is 6e4 km/s.

50 is in seconds.

So 6e4 *50 =3e6 km, then multiplied by gamma (1.0206) gives 3,061,800.

No, but wait, the calculation is 6e4 * (50 * gamma).

So 50 *1.0206 is 51.03 s, and 6e4 *51.03 = 3,061,800.

So, perhaps the intended answer is D, 3,060,000 km, considering that perhaps in the problem they approximated gamma as 1.02, leading to 51 s, and 6e4 *51=3,060,000.

So, given the options, the correct choice is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference. The ejecta is moving at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) (or \( 0.2c \)) towards the center of the Galaxy. The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame is \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \), and we need to calculate the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame.

### Key Steps:
1. **Relating Time in the Two Frames**:  
   Time dilation occurs because the two frames are moving relative to each other. The relationship between the time in the Galaxy's frame (\( t \)) and the ejecta's frame (\( t' \)) is given by:
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]
   where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \), we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{(60,000)^2}{(300,000)^2} = 0.04
   \]
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]

2. **Calculating Time in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   Using \( t = \gamma t' \), we find:
   \[
   t = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}
   \]

3. **Calculating the Distance Traveled**:  
   The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is:
   \[
   d = v \cdot t
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t = 51.03 \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   d = 60,000 \times 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}
   \]

4. **Matching with the Options**:  
   The closest option to \( 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \) is \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \), which corresponds to option D. The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding approximations in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \).

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a supernova and its ejecta moving towards the center of the Galaxy. Hmm. Let me try to wrap my head around it.

The question says that part of the supernova ejecta is moving directly towards the center of the Galaxy. Both the ejecta and the Galaxy are in inertial frames. From the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is moving towards it at 60,000 km/s. So, I think that means in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center.

Wait, no, wait. Oh right, in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy's center is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So that must be the relative speed between the two frames. So if I'm in the Galaxy frame, the ejecta is moving towards me at 60,000 km/s.

But wait, the problem is asking about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. Oh, right, that's time dilation. Because the two frames are moving relative to each other, their time measurements might differ.

So, I think I need to use special relativity here, specifically time dilation. Because the object (ejecta) is moving at a significant fraction of the speed of light, relativistic effects come into play.

Let me jot down the given data:

- Speed of ejecta relative to Galaxy (v) = 60,000 km/s. Wait, but wait, the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s. So 60,000 is 0.2c. That's 20% the speed of light, which is pretty fast, so relativistic effects are noticeable but not extreme.

Time in ejecta frame (t') = 50 seconds. We need to find the distance (d) the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame.

In the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at speed v. But the time experienced in the Galaxy frame isn't the same as in the ejecta frame because of time dilation. Oh right, the proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the event. Wait, but in this case, the events are the start and end of the journey as experienced in the ejecta frame. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, the problem says 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame. So in the ejecta's frame, the time is t' = 50 s. But we need to find the distance d in the Galaxy frame, which would be v multiplied by the time in the Galaxy's frame (t). So d = v * t.

But how do we relate t' (ejecta's time) to t (Galaxy's time)?

From special relativity, the time experienced in the moving frame is related to the stationary frame by the Lorentz factor gamma. The equation is t = gamma * (t' + (v x')/c²), but since the motion is along one axis (x), and x' is zero in the ejecta frame (assuming the event is happening at the same point in their frame), maybe it's simpler.

Wait, the events are the start and end of the 50-second interval in the ejecta frame. So in the ejecta frame, the ejecta is stationary, and the Galaxy is moving towards it. So the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy frame would be v * t, where t is the time in the Galaxy frame.

But to find t, we need to calculate the time dilation. So t' is the proper time, or is it? Wait, no. Proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the process. In this case, the process is the movement of the ejecta towards the Galaxy. So the proper time would be measured in the ejecta's frame, since the ejecta is at rest there. Therefore, t' is the proper time.

Wait, but movement is such that in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving toward them. So the process from the ejecta's perspective is the Galaxy moving 60,000 km/s towards them for 50 seconds, but perhaps I should think in terms of how much distance is covered in the Galaxy frame.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think about the distance in the Galaxy frame. So, the ejecta moves at v = 60,000 km/s for a certain time t (in Galaxy frame). The distance would be v * t.

But t isn't 50 seconds; that's the time in the ejecta's frame. So we need to relate t and t' via time dilation.

The time dilation formula is t' = t / gamma, where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So t = gamma * t'.

So first, calculate gamma.

v = 60,000 km/s = 6e4 km/s. c is 3e5 km/s.

So v² = (6e4)^2 = 3.6e9 (km^2/s^2)
c² = (3e5)^2 = 9e10 (km^2/s^2)

v²/c² = (3.6e9)/(9e10) = (3.6)/(9e1) )= 0.04. So 4%.

So 1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

Gamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

So gamma is approximately 1.0206.

Therefore, t = gamma * t' = 1.0206 * 50 s ≈ 51.03 seconds.

So the time in the Galaxy frame is about 51.03 seconds.

Then, the distance d = v * t = 6e4 km/s * 51.03 s ≈ 6e4 * 51.03.

Calculate that:

6e4 is 60,000.

60,000 * 51 = 3,060,000.

Wait, but 51.03 is 51 + 0.03. So 60,000 * 51.03 = 60,000 *51 + 60,000 *0.03 = 3,060,000 + 1,800 = 3,061,800 km.

But wait, that's not one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A) 2,940,000
B)3,000,000
C)2,880,000
D)3,060,000

Hmm, D is 3,060,000, which would be our approximate result if we took t as 51 s exactly. But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here.

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, if t = gamma * t' = (1.0206) * 50 = 51.03 s.

v =6e4 km/s.

So 6e4 * 51.03 = ?

6e4 *50 = 3e6.

6e4 *1.03 = 60,000 * 1.03 = 61,800.

So total is 3e6 + 61,800 = 3,061,800 km.

But the closest option is D)3,060,000, which is 3.06e6 km. Hmm, so perhaps we need to be more precise with the gamma calculation.

Wait, perhaps I approximated gamma too roughly. Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more accurately.

0.96 is 96/100 = 24^2 / 25^2. Hmm, not directly helpful.

Alternatively, compute sqrt(0.96):

Let me compute 0.9798 squared: 0.9798 * 0.9798.

0.9798 * 0.9798 ≈ (0.98 - 0.0002)^2 ≈ 0.9604 - 2 * 0.98 * 0.0002 + (0.0002)^2 ≈ 0.9604 - 0.000392 + 0.00000004 ≈ about 0.960008.

But 0.960008 is approximately 0.96, so 0.9798^2 is 0.960008, so sqrt(0.96) is approximately 0.9798.

Wait, but gamma is 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.020604.

Let me calculate it more accurately.

Let me compute 1 / 0.9798.

0.9798 * 1.02 = 0.9798 *1.02 = 0.9798 + 0.019596 = 0.999396.

Hmm, but 0.9798 * 1.0206 = let me compute that more precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps use a calculator approach. Let me compute gamma using more precise approximation.

The Lorentz factor gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - (v²/c²)).

v/c = 60,000 / 300,000 = 0.2.

So v²/c² = 0.04. Thus, 1 - v²/c² = 0.96.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.0206.

But perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can compute it using the Taylor series approximation.

sqrt(0.96) = sqrt(1 - 0.04) ≈ 1 - (0.04)/2 - ( (0.04)^2 )/(8) ) + ... 

So sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1 - 0.02 - (0.0016)/8 = 1 - 0.02 - 0.0002 = 0.98 - 0.0002 = 0.9798.

Thus, gamma ≈ 1.0206.

So t = 50 * 1.0206 ≈ 51.03 s.

Thus, d = 6e4 * 51.03 = 6e4 *51 + 6e4 *0.03.

6e4 *51 = 3,060,000.

6e4 *0.03 = 1,800.

So total is 3,061,800 km.

But the options don't have this number. The closest is D)3,060,000.

Hmm. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the selection of the frame.

Wait, another thought: When the ejecta is moving at v relative to the Galaxy, the time experienced in the ejecta's frame for a certain distance would be affected by length contraction.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it from the perspective of length contraction. Because in the ejecta's frame, the Galaxy is moving towards them at v, so the distance they have to cover is contracted.

Wait, no, because the problem is about the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta's frame.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the proper time and then relate it.

Wait, the proper time is the time measured in the rest frame of the process. Since the ejecta is moving, the proper time is measured in the ejecta's frame. So t' is 50 seconds.

So in the Galaxy frame, the time is longer. So t = gamma * t'.

So d = v * t.

Yes, that's what I did before.

So in that case, the distance is 6e4 * 51.03 ≈ 3,061,800 km.

But looking at the options, D is 3,060,000, which is close. So perhaps the calculation is approximated, and the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the gamma. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute gamma: 1/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2) = 1/sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2) = 1/sqrt(0.96).

Let me compute sqrt(0.96) more precisely.

I know that 0.98^2 = 0.9604.

So sqrt(0.96) is a little less than 0.98.

Compute 0.9798^2:

= (0.98 - 0.0002)^2 = 0.98^2 - 2*0.98*0.0002 + (0.0002)^2 ≈ 0.9604 - 0.000392 + 0.00000004 ≈ 0.960008.

So sqrt(0.96) ≈ 0.9798.

Thus, gamma = 1 / 0.9798 ≈ 1.020604.

So gamma is approximately 1.02064.

So t = 50 * 1.02064 ≈ 51.032 seconds.

So d = 6e4 * 51.032 = ?

6e4 *51.032 = 60,000 *51.032 = (60,000 *51) + (60,000 *0.032) )= 3,060,000 + 1,920 = 3,061,920 km.

Hmm, that's approximately 3,061,920 km. The closest option is D)3,060,000. So perhaps the intended answer is D, but I'm a bit confused because my calculation gives a higher number.

Wait, but wait—maybe I'm getting the frames mixed up. Let me think again.

Wait, in the ejecta's frame, the center of the Galaxy is approaching at 60,000 km/s. So in the Galaxy's frame, the ejecta is moving at 60,000 km/s towards the center. So the time in the Galaxy's frame is longer than the ejecta's time.

So the distance the ejecta travels is v multiplied by t, where t is the time in the Galaxy's frame. But t = gamma * t', so d = v * gamma * t'.

So substituting the numbers: 6e4 km/s * 1.0206 *50 s.

Wait, wait, wait a second. 60,000 km/s is 6e4 km/s. 50 seconds.

So 6e4 *1.0206 *50.

Wait, 6e4 *50 = 3e6. Then multiplied by 1.0206 gives 3e6 *1.0206 = 3,061,800 km.

So the same as before.

So, since the options don't have 3,061,800, but option D is 3,060,000, which is the closest. So I think D is the correct answer.

Wait, but what if I made a mistake in the gamma calculation? Let me recheck.

v = 6e4 km/s.

c =3e5 km/s.

v/c = 0.2.

gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.2)^2 ) = 1 / sqrt(0.96) ≈ 1.0206.

Yes, right.

Wait, maybe the question is about distance in the ejecta's frame. No, no, the problem says, "what distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy reference frame when 50 seconds pass in the ejecta reference frame?"

So the distance in Galaxy frame is d = v * t, where t is the time in Galaxy frame, which is gamma * t'.

So d = 6e4 * 50 * gamma.

Wait, so 6e4 is 6e4 km/s.

50 is in seconds.

So 6e4 *50 =3e6 km, then multiplied by gamma (1.0206) gives 3,061,800.

No, but wait, the calculation is 6e4 * (50 * gamma).

So 50 *1.0206 is 51.03 s, and 6e4 *51.03 = 3,061,800.

So, perhaps the intended answer is D, 3,060,000 km, considering that perhaps in the problem they approximated gamma as 1.02, leading to 51 s, and 6e4 *51=3,060,000.

So, given the options, the correct choice is D.


To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the supernova ejecta relative to the Galaxy's frame of reference. The ejecta is moving at a speed of \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) (or \( 0.2c \)) towards the center of the Galaxy. The time elapsed in the ejecta's frame is \( t' = 50 \, \text{s} \), and we need to calculate the distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame.

### Key Steps:
1. **Relating Time in the Two Frames**:  
   Time dilation occurs because the two frames are moving relative to each other. The relationship between the time in the Galaxy's frame (\( t \)) and the ejecta's frame (\( t' \)) is given by:
   \[
   t = \gamma t'
   \]
   where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor:
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( c = 300,000 \, \text{km/s} \), we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{(60,000)^2}{(300,000)^2} = 0.04
   \]
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - 0.04}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{0.96}} \approx 1.0206
   \]

2. **Calculating Time in the Galaxy's Frame**:  
   Using \( t = \gamma t' \), we find:
   \[
   t = 1.0206 \times 50 \approx 51.03 \, \text{s}
   \]

3. **Calculating the Distance Traveled**:  
   The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is:
   \[
   d = v \cdot t
   \]
   Substituting \( v = 60,000 \, \text{km/s} \) and \( t = 51.03 \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   d = 60,000 \times 51.03 \approx 3,061,800 \, \text{km}
   \]

4. **Matching with the Options**:  
   The closest option to \( 3,061,800 \, \text{km} \) is \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \), which corresponds to option D. The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding approximations in the problem setup.

### Conclusion:
The distance the ejecta travels in the Galaxy's frame is approximately \( 3,060,000 \, \text{km} \).
