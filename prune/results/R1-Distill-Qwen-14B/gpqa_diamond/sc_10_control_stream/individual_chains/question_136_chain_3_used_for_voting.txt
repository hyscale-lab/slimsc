Okay, so I have this problem about vector fields and their divergence. Hmm, let me think. The question says that the vector field f(r) falls off as 1/r², and it's only in the radial direction in spherical coordinates. I need to find the volume integral of the divergence of f over a sphere of radius R.

Wait, I remember from my electromagnetism class that divergence of a radial vector field has a specific formula. Oh right, if a vector field F(r) is purely radial, then the divergence is (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r), where F_r is the radial component.

So in this case, f(r) is 1/r² in the radial direction. Let me write that down. So F_r = 1/r², and F_theta and F_phi are zero.

Calculating the divergence: ∇.f = (1/r²) d/dr ( r² * F_r ). Substituting F_r, that becomes (1/r²) d/dr ( r² * (1/r²) ). Simplifying inside the derivative: r²*(1/r²) is 1. So the derivative of 1 with respect to r is zero. That makes ∇.f = 0. 

Wait, but wait a second. Because if the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin, then the integral over any volume that doesn't include the origin would be zero. But if the origin is included, like our sphere of radius R around the origin, then maybe there's a delta function or something? Because sometimes in physics, like with electric fields, a point charge would have divergence at the origin.

Wait, what's the divergence theorem again? It says that the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume is equal to the flux through the surface. So, ∫∇.f dV = ∫f · dA over the surface.

If I compute the surface integral, maybe that's easier. The flux would be the integral of f(r) times the area of the sphere. Because f is radial, the dot product is just f(r) multiplied by the surface element.

So f(r) at radius R is 1/R². The surface area of a sphere is 4πR². So flux is (1/R²) * 4πR² = 4π. 

So according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral of the divergence is equal to 4π. But wait, earlier I thought the divergence is zero everywhere except maybe at the origin, which is inside the sphere. So if the divergence is zero in the volume, but the flux is 4π, then that suggests that the divergence must have a delta function at the origin. 

Wait, that's right! So the divergence of f is zero except at r=0. So the integral over the sphere includes the origin, leading to a flux equal to the integral of the divergence, which is 4π. But that can't be right because according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral is equal to the flux, which is 4π. So the volume integral of the divergence must be 4π.

But wait, earlier I thought the divergence was zero. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the divergence. Let me recalculate. The field is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. So in terms of components, F_r = 1/r², F_theta = F_phi = 0.

∇.f = (1/r²) d/dr (r² F_r) + (1/(r sinθ)) [d/dθ (F_theta sinθ) ] + (1/(r sinθ)) dF_phi/dφ.

Since F_theta and F_phi are zero, those terms vanish. So we're left with (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). That's (1/r²) d/dr (1) = (1/r²)(0) = 0. So the divergence is zero. So the volume integral should be zero.

But wait, according to the divergence theorem, the flux is 4π. So that implies that the volume integral is 4π. Hmm, this is confusing. There must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up electrostatics. Oh wait, in Coulomb's law, the electric field is E = (1/(4πε₀)) (q/r²) r̂. The divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where it's a delta function. So ∇.E = (1/ε₀) ρ, where ρ is charge density. So ∫∇.E dV = Q/ε₀.

In this problem, perhaps the vector field is analogous. So if f(r) = 1/r² r̂, then ∇.f would be 4π δ³(r), because the flux through a surface surrounding the origin is 4π.

Wait, so in this case, the divergence would be 4π δ(r). So integrating ∇.f over the volume of the sphere (which includes the origin) would give 4π. But wait, earlier I calculated the divergence as zero. How does that reconcile?

Oh, I think I was wrong in calculating the divergence. Let me re-examine. Wait, the vector field is f(r) = (1/r²) r̂. So it's a radial vector field. Let me compute its divergence correctly.

The general formula for the divergence of a radial vector field F(r) r̂ is (1/r²) d/dr (r² F(r)).

So F(r) here is 1/r². So plug into the formula: (1/r²) d/dr [ r² * (1/r²) ] = (1/r²) d/dr (1) = 0. So divergence is zero. But that's the same conclusion as before.

Wait, but according to the divergence theorem, the integral over the sphere's volume should be the same as the flux. But if the divergence is zero everywhere except the origin, then the integral is zero. But earlier, I calculated the flux as 4π. So something's wrong here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the flux. Let me recalculate the flux.

The flux is ∫ f · dA over the surface. Since f is radial, and dA is radial, the dot product is f(r) * dA. But wait, wait, the field is f(r) = 1/r². Wait, but when calculating the flux through the surface of radius R, the value of f at that surface is 1/R². The surface area is 4π R². So flux is (1/R²) * 4π R² =4π. So flux is 4π.

But according to the divergence theorem, the volume integral of the divergence (which I thought was zero) equals the flux, which is 4π. So this can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in computing the divergence.

Wait a second. Let me think again. If f(r) = (1/r²) r̂, then its divergence is zero except at the origin, but the flux through a closed surface enclosing the origin is 4π. Therefore, the divergence must be 4π δ³(r). So in the integral, ∫ (∇·f) dV = 4π. But wait, that's only when the origin is inside the volume of integration. 

Wait, but if the divergence is 4π δ³(r), then the integral is 4π, regardless of the volume, as long as the volume includes the origin. So in this problem, the sphere of radius R includes the origin because R is positive. So the integral is 4π.

But wait, earlier when I computed the divergence as (1/r²) d/dr(r²*(1/r²)) = 0. So perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, because the vector field f(r) is defined as 1/r², but perhaps it's not the same as the Coulomb field. Wait, in the Coulomb case, E is proportional to 1/r², but the divergence is a delta function.

Wait, maybe in this problem, the divergence is actually zero everywhere, but when integrating over a volume that includes a point where the field is singular (the origin), the integral gives a non-zero value. So the problem is that f(r) is singular at the origin, so ∇·f includes a delta function. So the integral of the divergence is 4π.

But then why did the divergence formula give zero? Because the formula I used assumes that the field is smooth, that is, it's differentiable everywhere. So perhaps the correct way is to use the divergence theorem, which tells us that the integral is 4π, because the flux through the surface is 4π.

So putting it all together, the volume integral of the divergence is 4π. 

Looking back at the options, option A is 4π. So the answer must be A.

The problem involves evaluating the volume integral of the divergence of a vector field **f(r)** that is purely radial and falls off as **1/r²**. The field is defined as **f(r) = (1/r²) r̂**, where **r̂** is the unit radial vector in spherical coordinates. The goal is to compute **∫ (∇ · f) dV** over the volume of a sphere of radius **R** centered at the origin.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Divergence of the Vector Field**:  
   The divergence of a radial vector field **f(r) = F(r) r̂** is given by:  
   \[
   \nabla \cdot f = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 F(r) \right)
   \]  
   Substituting **F(r) = 1/r²**, we get:  
   \[
   \nabla \cdot f = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} \left( r^2 \cdot \frac{1}{r^2} \right) = \frac{1}{r^2} \frac{d}{dr} (1) = 0
   \]  
   Thus, the divergence is zero everywhere except at the origin, where the field is singular.

2. **Divergence Theorem**:  
   The divergence theorem states that:  
   \[
   \int_V (\nabla \cdot f) \, dV = \int_S f \cdot dA
   \]  
   Here, **S** is the surface of the sphere of radius **R**. Since **f(r)** is radial, the flux through the surface is:  
   \[
   \int_S f \cdot dA = \int_S \frac{1}{R^2} \, dA = \frac{1}{R^2} \cdot 4\pi R^2 = 4\pi
   \]  
   Therefore, the volume integral of the divergence equals the flux through the surface, which is **4π**.

3. **Singular Nature of the Field at the Origin**:  
   The field **f(r)** is singular at the origin, and the divergence includes a delta function **δ³(r)** to account for this singularity. Thus, the integral of the divergence over the volume of the sphere (which includes the origin) is **4π**, regardless of the vanishing divergence away from the origin.

### Conclusion:
The volume integral of the divergence of the field over the sphere of radius **R** is **4π**. This matches option **A**.

Since F_theta and F_phi are zero, those terms vanish. So we're left with (1/r²) d/dr (r² * (1/r²)). That's (1/r²) d/dr (1) = (1/r²)(0) = 0. So the divergence is zero. So the volume integral should be zero.
