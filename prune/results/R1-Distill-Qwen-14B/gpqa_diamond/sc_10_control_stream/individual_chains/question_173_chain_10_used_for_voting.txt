Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. Let me think. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. Oh wait, sometimes it's written with ħ, which is h/(2π), so the inequality becomes Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2. But I'm not sure which version to use, but I think for this problem, either should work as they're just constants.

The question says that the electron is traveling along the x-direction with speed v = 2e8 m/s, and the uncertainty in its position Δx is 0.1 nm. They're asking for the minimum uncertainty in energy ΔE.

Wait, but how does uncertainty in position relate to energy? Oh, right. The energy of a particle is related to its momentum, since E = p²/(2m). So the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be linked to the uncertainty in momentum Δp. So if I can find Δp, I can find ΔE.

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle says Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum uncertainty in momentum Δp_min is ħ/(2Δx). Then, using that Δp, I can find ΔE_min using the formula for kinetic energy: ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron.

Let me jot down the numbers:

Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1e-9 meters.

Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Mass of the electron m is approximately 9.109e-31 kg.

So first, calculate Δp_min = ħ/(2Δx).

Plugging in the values:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s
Δx = 0.1e-9 m

Δp_min = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 0.1e-9)
= (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-10)
= 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-10
= 5.272859e-25 kg·m/s

Wait, wait. Because 2 * 0.1e-9 is 0.2e-9, which is 2e-10. So 1.0545718e-34 divided by 2e-10 is 5.27e-25? Let me double-check that calculation.

1e-34 / 1e-10 is 1e-24. So 1.05e-34 / 2e-10 = (1.05/2) * 1e-24 = 0.525e-24 = 5.25e-25. Yeah, that's right.

Now, calculate ΔE using ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m).

So, (5.272859e-25)^2 = let's compute that.

5.27e-25 squared is (5.27)^2 ≈ 27.77, and (1e-25)^2 is 1e-50, so 27.77e-50 is 2.777e-49.

Then, divide by 2m. m is 9.11e-31 kg.

So 2m is 1.822e-30 kg.

So ΔE = (2.777e-49) / (1.822e-30) 

Wait, let me compute that division. 2.777e-49 / 1.822e-30 = (2.777 / 1.822) * 1e-19.

2.777 / 1.822 is approximately 1.524.

So 1.524e-19 J.

Hmm, looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J. So the answer should be near that.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: perhaps using the relativistic energy? But the speed given is 2e8 m/s. Let me see, what's the speed of light? Approximately 3e8 m/s. So 2e8 is about 2/3 the speed of light. Hmm, so relativistic effects might be significant. But for an electron, even at 2e8 m/s, maybe the non-relativistic approximation is still good enough. Let me think.

The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc². Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me compute gamma:

v = 2e8 m/s. c = 3e8 m/s. So v/c = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

v²/c² = (4/9) ≈ 0.4444.

1 - 0.4444 = 0.5556.

sqrt(0.5556) is approximately 0.7454.

So gamma is 1 / 0.7454 ≈ 1.342.

So gamma is about 1.342.

So the relativistic kinetic energy is (1.342 - 1) * m c² ≈ 0.342 * m c².

But wait, but we are dealing with the uncertainty in energy. So the non-relativistic approach might not be accurate, but I'm not sure. Also, the question doesn't specify whether to use relativistic or classical mechanics, so perhaps it's intended to use the non-relativistic approach. Let me proceed with that and see what happens.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-relativistic approach is sufficient because the error in energy is to be estimated, not the exact value.

Wait, in any case, the calculation using the non-relativistic approach gave us approximately 1.5e-19 J. But wait, wait, let me redo that calculation more accurately.

Wait, when I computed (5.27e-25)^2:

5.27e-25 squared is (5.27)^2 = 27.77, and (e-25)^2 is e-50, so 27.77e-50, which is 2.777e-49.

Then, 2m is 2 *9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30 kg.

So ΔE = (2.777e-49) / (1.8218e-30) 

Let me compute that division:

2.777e-49 / 1.8218e-30 = (2.777 / 1.8218) * 1e-19.

2.777 / 1.8218 ≈ 1.524.

So 1.524e-19 J.

Looking back at the options:

A) ~1e-18 J → 10^-18
B) ~1e-17 → 10^-17
C) ~1e-19 → 10^-19
D) ~1e-16 → 10^-16

So the closest is option C.

But wait, did I make any mistake in the calculation? Let me check the steps again.

Δp_min = ħ/(2Δx) → correct.

Δx is 0.1 nm = 1e-10 m? Wait, no: 0.1 nm is 0.1 * 1e-9 m = 1e-10 m. Oh wait, wait, wait! Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake in Δx. 0.1 nm is 0.1 * 1e-9 meters, which is 1e-10 m. Oh wait! I thought Δx = 0.1e-9 m, which is correct. So in the calculation:

Δp_min = (1.05457e-34) / (2 * 1e-10)
= 1.05457e-34 / 2e-10
= 5.27285e-25 kg·m/s. Correct.

Then, (5.27285e-25)^2 = (5.27)^2 is about 27.77, so 27.77e-50 (which is 2.777e-49). Correct.

Then, 2m = 2 * 9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30 kg.

ΔE = 2.777e-49 / 1.8218e-30 = 1.524e-19 J.

So that's about 1.5e-19 J. So option C is ~1e-19 J. So that's the closest.

But wait, another thought: the question says 'minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron.' But wait, the energy uncertainty principle is related to the time-energy uncertainty principle, but in this case, it's position and momentum that are given. So I think the way I approached it is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is being considered as the kinetic energy, so I used the correct formula.

So the answer should be option C, ~1e-19 J.

To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of an electron traveling with speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) along the x-direction, given the uncertainty in its position \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between energy and momentum.

### Key Steps:
1. **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**:  
   \[
   \Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
   \]
   where \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \).  
   Rearranging for \( \Delta p_{\text{min}} \):  
   \[
   \Delta p_{\text{min}} = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}
   \]

2. **Substitute Values**:  
   \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 0.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).  
   \[
   \Delta p_{\text{min}} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-10}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}
   \]

3. **Energy Uncertainty**:  
   The kinetic energy of the electron is related to its momentum by:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m}
   \]
   where \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \).  
   Substituting \( \Delta p_{\text{min}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \):  
   \[
   (\Delta p_{\text{min}})^2 = (5.272859 \times 10^{-25})^2 = 2.777 \times 10^{-49} \, \text{kg}^2 \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2
   \]
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{2.777 \times 10^{-49}}{2 \times 9.109 \times 10^{-31}} = \frac{2.777 \times 10^{-49}}{1.8218 \times 10^{-30}} \approx 1.524 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately \( 1.5 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which is closest to option **C) ~\( 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)**.

### Conclusion:
The minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron is approximately \( 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty principle. Hmm, I remember that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle relates the uncertainty in position and momentum. Let me think. The formula is Δx * Δp ≥ h/(4π), where h is Planck's constant. Oh wait, sometimes it's written with ħ, which is h/(2π), so the inequality becomes Δx * Δp ≥ ħ/2.

Wait, but how does uncertainty in position relate to energy? Oh, right. The energy of a particle is related to its momentum, since E = p²/(2m). So the uncertainty in energy ΔE would be linked to the uncertainty in momentum Δp. So if I can find Δp, I can find ΔE.

Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle says Δx Δp ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum uncertainty in momentum Δp_min is ħ/(2Δx). Then, using that Δp, I can find ΔE_min using the formula for kinetic energy: ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m), where m is the mass of the electron.

Let me jot down the numbers:

Δx = 0.1 nm = 0.1e-9 meters.

Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

Mass of the electron m is approximately 9.109e-31 kg.

So first, calculate Δp_min = ħ/(2Δx).

Plugging in the values:

ħ = 1.0545718e-34 J·s
Δx = 0.1e-9 m

Δp_min = (1.0545718e-34) / (2 * 0.1e-9)
= (1.0545718e-34) / (2e-10)
= 1.0545718e-34 / 2e-10
= 5.272859e-25 kg·m/s

Wait, wait. Because 2 * 0.1e-9 is 0.2e-9, which is 2e-10. So 1.0545718e-34 divided by 2e-10 is 5.27e-25? Let me double-check that calculation.

1e-34 / 1e-10 is 1e-24. So 1.05e-34 / 2e-10 = (1.05/2) * 1e-24 = 0.525e-24 = 5.25e-25. Yeah, that's right.

Now, calculate ΔE using ΔE = (Δp)^2/(2m).

So, (5.272859e-25)^2 = let's compute that.

5.27e-25 squared is (5.27)^2 ≈ 27.77, and (1e-25)^2 is 1e-50, so 27.77e-50 is 2.777e-49.

Then, divide by 2m. m is 9.11e-31 kg.

So 2m is 1.822e-30 kg.

So ΔE = (2.777e-49) / (1.822e-30) 

Wait, let me compute that division. 2.777e-49 / 1.822e-30 = (2.777 / 1.822) * 1e-19.

2.777 / 1.822 is approximately 1.524.

So 1.524e-19 J.

Hmm, looking at the options, option C is ~1e-19 J. So the answer should be near that.

Wait, but wait. Another approach: perhaps using the relativistic energy? But the speed given is 2e8 m/s. Let me see, what's the speed of light? Approximately 3e8 m/s. So 2e8 is about 2/3 the speed of light. Hmm, so relativistic effects might be significant. But for an electron, even at 2e8 m/s, maybe the non-relativistic approximation is still good enough. Let me think.

The relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma -1)mc². Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Let me compute gamma:

v = 2e8 m/s. c = 3e8 m/s. So v/c = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667.

v²/c² = (4/9) ≈ 0.4444.

1 - 0.4444 = 0.5556.

sqrt(0.5556) is approximately 0.7454.

So gamma is 1 / 0.7454 ≈ 1.342.

So gamma is about 1.342.

So the relativistic kinetic energy is (1.342 - 1) * m c² ≈ 0.342 * m c².

But wait, but we are dealing with the uncertainty in energy. So the non-relativistic approach might not be accurate, but I'm not sure. Also, the question doesn't specify whether to use relativistic or classical mechanics, so perhaps it's intended to use the non-relativistic approach. Let me proceed with that and see what happens.

Wait, in any case, the calculation using the non-relativistic approach gave us approximately 1.5e-19 J. But wait, wait, let me redo that calculation more accurately.

Wait, when I computed (5.27e-25)^2:

5.27e-25 squared is (5.27)^2 = 27.77, and (e-25)^2 is e-50, so 27.77e-50, which is 2.777e-49.

Then, 2m is 2 *9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30 kg.

So ΔE = (2.777e-49) / (1.8218e-30) 

Let me compute that division:

2.777e-49 / 1.8218e-30 = (2.777 / 1.8218) * 1e-19.

2.777 / 1.8218 ≈ 1.524.

So 1.524e-19 J.

Looking back at the options:

A) ~1e-18 J → 10^-18
B) ~1e-17 → 10^-17
C) ~1e-19 → 10^-19
D) ~1e-16 → 10^-16

So the closest is option C.

But wait, did I make any mistake in the calculation? Let me check the steps again.

Δp_min = ħ/(2Δx) → correct.

Δx is 0.1 nm = 1e-10 m? Wait, no: 0.1 nm is 0.1 * 1e-9 m = 1e-10 m. Oh wait, wait, wait! Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake in Δx. 0.1 nm is 0.1 * 1e-9 meters, which is 1e-10 m. Oh wait! I thought Δx = 0.1e-9 m, which is correct. So in the calculation:

Δp_min = (1.05457e-34) / (2 * 1e-10)
= 1.05457e-34 / 2e-10
= 5.27285e-25 kg·m/s. Correct.

Then, (5.27285e-25)^2 = (5.27)^2 is about 27.77, so 27.77e-50 (which is 2.777e-49). Correct.

Then, 2m = 2 * 9.109e-31 = 1.8218e-30 kg.

ΔE = 2.777e-49 / 1.8218e-30 = 1.524e-19 J.

So that's about 1.5e-19 J. So option C is ~1e-19 J. So that's the closest.

But wait, another thought: the question says 'minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of the electron.' But wait, the energy uncertainty principle is related to the time-energy uncertainty principle, but in this case, it's position and momentum that are given. So I think the way I approached it is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy is being considered as the kinetic energy, so I used the correct formula.

So the answer should be option C, ~1e-19 J.


To estimate the minimum uncertainty in the energy ΔE of an electron traveling with speed \( v = 2 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) along the x-direction, given the uncertainty in its position \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} \), we use the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle and the relationship between energy and momentum.

### Key Steps:
1. **Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle**:  
   \[
   \Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
   \]
   where \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \).  
   Rearranging for \( \Delta p_{\text{min}} \):  
   \[
   \Delta p_{\text{min}} = \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta x}
   \]

2. **Substitute Values**:  
   \( \Delta x = 0.1 \, \text{nm} = 0.1 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} = 1 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \).  
   \[
   \Delta p_{\text{min}} = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-10}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s}
   \]

3. **Energy Uncertainty**:  
   The kinetic energy of the electron is related to its momentum by:  
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2m}
   \]
   where \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \).  
   Substituting \( \Delta p_{\text{min}} = 5.272859 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg·m/s} \):  
   \[
   (\Delta p_{\text{min}})^2 = (5.272859 \times 10^{-25})^2 = 2.777 \times 10^{-49} \, \text{kg}^2 \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2
   \]
   \[
   \Delta E = \frac{2.777 \times 10^{-49}}{2 \times 9.109 \times 10^{-31}} = \frac{2.777 \times 10^{-49}}{1.8218 \times 10^{-30}} \approx 1.524 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]

4. **Comparison with Options**:  
   The calculated minimum uncertainty in energy is approximately \( 1.5 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \), which is closest to option **C) ~\( 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)**.

### Conclusion:
The minimum uncertainty in the energy of the electron is approximately \( 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \).
