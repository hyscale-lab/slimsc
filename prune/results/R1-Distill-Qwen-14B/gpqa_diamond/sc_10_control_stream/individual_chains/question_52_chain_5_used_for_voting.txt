Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this stuff. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a star's photosphere and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when stars have spots, they can change their overall brightness and temperature, but I'm not exactly sure how that connects to the energy levels of atoms in their atmosphere.

Let me read the problem again. The star has a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels: level 1 and level 2.

They mention that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So, when there are spots, the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when there are no spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. The options are given as A, B, C, D with numbers like ~1.1, ~7.8, etc.

Wait, I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the two states, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

So, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels.

But wait, the problem says that the transition between these levels corresponds to 1448 Å. That's in the ultraviolet range, I think. So, the energy difference ΔE can be found using the relation E = hc/λ. Let me calculate that.

H is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. C is speed of light, about 3.0 x10^8 m/s. λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448 x 10^-10 meters.

So, ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = let's compute that.

Wait 1448e-10 meters is 1.448e-7 meters. So, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divided by 1.448e-7 is approximately 1.373e-18 J per photon. Hmm, but wait, for the energy difference between the levels, since the transition corresponds to that wavelength, it's the energy difference between level 2 and level 1, assuming that when the atom absorbs that photon, it jumps from level 1 to 2. Or wait, wait: if a photon of wavelength 1448Å is emitted when an atom transitions from level 2 to level 1, then E2 - E1 = hc/λ. Alternatively, if the transition is from level 1 to 2, then E1 < E2, so ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

But for the Boltzmann equation, the exponent is (E1 - E2)/(k T). So if E2 > E1, then (E1 - E2) is negative. So the exponent is negative, and the ratio n1/n2 will be less than 1.

But wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall temperature of the photosphere is lower. So when spots are present, Teff is 5500 K, whereas without spots, it's 6000 K.

Wait, no: the Teff is given when the star does not have spots as 6000 K, and when it has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So when we're considering the ratio N1/N2, which is the number of atoms in level 1 over level 2, how does this change when T drops from 6000 K to 5500 K.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So without spots, N1/N2 is higher than when there are spots. So, when T is higher, the ratio is higher.

So let me think: the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Wait, but E1 and E2 are the energies of the two levels. If the transition is from level 1 to level 2, then E2 = E1 + ΔE, so E1 - E2 = -ΔE. So the exponent becomes (E1 - E2)/(k T) = (-ΔE)/(k T), which is negative.

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, no: because E1 < E2. So E1 - E2 = -ΔE. So the exponent is (-ΔE)/(k T), which is negative. So exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) = 1 / exp(ΔE/(k T)).

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) / exp(ΔE/(k T)) )

So when temperature T increases, the denominator increases because exp(ΔE/(k T)) gets larger, so the ratio n1/n2 would decrease. Wait, no: exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases as T increases, so denominator increases, so n1/n2 decreases. So higher T leads to lower n1/n2.

But in the problem, when the star has spots, the overall T is lower (5500 K) compared to 6000 K. So when T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 would be higher. Because, let's see: if T decreases, the denominator becomes smaller, so the ratio n1/n2 would increase. So without spots, T is 6000 K, so n1/n2 is lower than when T is 5500 K. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait: problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher.

Hmm. Maybe I have the ratio backwards. Let me double-check. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher.

Wait, the ratio is N1/N2. So when the star has spots, N1/N2 is lower. So when Teff is 5500 K, N1/N2 is lower than when Teff was 6000 K.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, higher T would reduce N1/N2 because the exponent becomes more negative, leading to lower n1/n2. So if, when T increases, N1/N2 decreases. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so N1/N2 should increase. But the problem says it decreases. Hmm, that's conflicting. So I must have made a mistake in the direction.

Wait, maybe I got the energy levels the opposite way. Let me think again. If the transition corresponds to 1448Å, which is in the UV. Suppose that when the star is hotter (6000 K), the higher energy level is populated more. Wait, no, higher T makes the lower energy levels more populated?

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution states that higher energy levels are populated more in higher temperatures. So if the energy of level 2 is higher than level 1, then higher T would cause more atoms to be in level 2. Thus, N2 increases, N1 decreases, so N1/N2 decreases.

So, when T is 6000 K, without spots, N1/N2 is lower than when T is 5500 K. Because N1/N2 is (n1/n2) which is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) )

Wait, wait, no. Let me write it again. Let E2 be higher than E1. So E1 - E2 = -ΔE. So the exponent is (-ΔE)/(k T). So the ratio is (g1/g2) * exp( - (ΔE)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-derive the Boltzmann equation correctly.

The ratio of populations is given by:

n_j / n_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) )

Assuming E_j > E_i, so E_j - E_i is positive. So n_j/n_i = (g_j/g_i) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, for two levels 1 and 2, where E2 > E1.

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Which is same as (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T) )

So, when T increases, the exponent increases, so n1/n2 increases if (g1/g2) is a constant (assuming ΔE is positive).

Wait, no. Because if E2 > E1, ΔE is positive.

So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) )

So, as T increases, the exponent becomes larger, so n1/n2 increases. So for higher T, more atoms are in the lower energy level (level 1) compared to level 2, but that's only if the ratio of statistical weights is such. Wait, no, wait: n1 is in the lower energy level, n2 is in higher. So, when T increases, the ratio n1/n2 increases because the exponential grows. So, more atoms in level 1 compared to level 2 when T is higher.

But wait, that can't be right because higher T should populate higher energy states more. So maybe I made a mistake in which level is which.

Wait, wait. Maybe I have the ratio reversed. Let me see: if I have two energy levels, E1 < E2. At higher T, the distribution is more spread out, so a higher fraction of atoms are in higher energy levels.

So, n2 increases, so n2/n1 increases. So, n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) would decrease. So, if T increases, n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because if T is higher, more atoms are in level 2, so n2 is larger, so n1/n2 is smaller.

So, let me re-express the ratio.

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

= (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, earlier I thought E2 - E1 is ΔE, so positive. So then, n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)). So as T increases, exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases, so n1/n2 increases. That would mean more atoms in level 1 than level 2 when T is higher. But that doesn't make sense because higher T should lead to more atoms in higher energy levels.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think differently: when T increases, the thermal energy is higher, so more atoms can be excited to higher energy levels. So, if level 2 is higher than level 1, then a higher T would mean more atoms in level 2. So n2 increases, n1 decreases, so n1/n2 decreases.

So, the ratio n1/n2 should decrease with increasing T.

Wait, so let me correct the equation. The correct ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Which is (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Because E2 > E1, so E2 - E1 = ΔE.

So in that case, as T increases, exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) increases because the exponent becomes less negative. So n1/n2 would increase when T increases.

Wait, that's conflicting with the intuition. Let me take a concrete example.

Suppose ΔE is 1 eV.

At T=1000 K, 1 eV/(k*1000 K) is about 1/(8.617e-5 * 1e3) ) ? Wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k*T) = (1.602e-19 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * 1e3 K) )

= (1.602e-19) / (1.38e-20) ) ≈ 11.61. So exp(-11.61) is a very small number, about 1e-5.

So n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * 1e-5. So n1 is much smaller than n2.

At T=10,000 K, same ΔE: 1eV/(k*1e4) = (1.602e-19) / (1.38e-23 * 1e4) )

= 1.602e-19 / 1.38e-19 ≈ 1.16. So exp(-1.16) ≈ 0.313.

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * 0.313. So n1 is about 0.3 times n2.

So, as T increases, n1/n2 increases, but from 1e-5 to 0.3. Wait, but that's a huge increase. So n1 is now 30% of n2. That would mean more atoms in level 2 than level 1 when T is higher.

Wait, but if n1/n2 increases, that would mean n1 is larger than n2. Which would imply that level 1 is more populated than level 2. But for higher T, level 2 should be more populated.

Hmm, maybe I messed up the ratio. Maybe the ratio is n2/n1.

Wait, yes! Because sometimes the ratio is written as n_j/n_i, but sometimes it's the other way around. So I need to be precise.

The Boltzmann equation says:

n_j / n_i = (g_j/g_i) * exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) )

So, if j is level 2 and i is level 1, then E_j > E_i, so E_j - E_i is positive.

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, as T increases, exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) increases (since the exponent becomes less negative), so n2/n1 increases. So more atoms in level 2 when T is higher.

Therefore, n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, no. Because n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) = 1 / [ (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) ] = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) )

So, as T increases, exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases, making n1/n2 increase. Which would mean more atoms in level 1 than level 2 as T increases, which contradicts the expectation.

Hmm, that's confusing. What's going on here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me take a simple example.

Suppose we have two energy levels, E1 and E2, with E2 > E1. We want to know whether n2 increases or n1 increases with T.

At very high T, most atoms are in the higher energy levels because they have enough thermal energy to reach them. So n2 should be larger than n1.

So n2/n1 should be greater than 1, and increasing with T.

From the Boltzmann equation, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, when T is high, -ΔE/(k T) is a small negative number. So exp(small negative) is about 1 - x, but that's not right. For example, if ΔE/(k T) is small, then exp(-ΔE/(k T)) ≈ 1 - ΔE/(k T). So, n2/n1 ≈ (g2/g1) * (1 - ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but that would imply that as T increases, n2/n1 increases if (g2/g1) is greater than 1. Or maybe not. Wait, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me compute the ratio when T is 6000 K and when it's 5500 K.

The problem states that when the star has 40% spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, when the spots are present, the photosphere's effective temperature is lower.

According to the problem, the ratio N1/N2 (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So, when T is 5500 K, N1/N2 is lower than when T is 6000 K.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T) )

So, when T is higher, ΔE/(k T) is smaller, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) is smaller. Therefore, n1/n2 is smaller when T is higher. Wait, that can't be right. Because if T increases, ΔE/(k T) decreases, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases? Wait no, because as T increases, the denominator increases, so ΔE/(k T) becomes smaller. So exp(small number) is larger than exp(bigger negative number).

Wait, let me compute for T=6000 K and T=5500 K.

Compute for each T, the exponent ΔE/(k T), and see how it affects the ratio.

First, compute ΔE.

ΔE = hc/λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7 )

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 1.448e-7 m:

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1.372e-18 J = (1.372e-18)/(1.602e-19) eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that's a big energy difference. So 8.56 eV between the two levels.

But wait, that seems way too high. Because typical atomic transitions are in the range of a few eV. Wait, 1448 Å is 0.1448 nm, which is in the UV. So the energy is about 8.56 eV, which is higher than the ionization energy of many atoms. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute.

Wait, 1448 Angstroms is 1448 * 1e-10 meters = 1.448e-7 meters. So:

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m)

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so ΔE = 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wow, that's a very large energy difference. So, the transition is from level 1 to level 2, which is a high-energy photon. So, in the UV range.

But how does that affect the population of the two levels?

Well, the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is ΔE/(k T). Let's compute that for T = 6000 K and T = 5500 K.

k (Boltzmann constant) is 1.38e-23 J/K.

Compute for T=6000 K:

ΔE/(k T) = (8.56 eV) / (k*T in eV/(K))

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of eV.

Wait, 1 eV/(k) is approximately 11605 K. Because k is about 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, k*T (in eV) = (8.617e-5 eV/K) * T.

So for T=6000 K: k*T = 8.617e-5 * 6000 ≈ 0.517 eV.

So ΔE/(k T) = (8.56 eV) / (0.517 eV) ≈ 16.55.

Similarly, for T=5500 K: k*T = 8.617e-5 * 5500 ≈ 0.4739 eV.

ΔE/(k T) = 8.56 / 0.4739 ≈ 18.08.

Wait, so for both cases, ΔE/(k T) is a large positive number, like around 16 to 18.

So the Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(k T)), but wait, in the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, no, earlier I had to correct the ratio.

The correct ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Which is (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So as T increases, -ΔE/(k T) becomes less negative, so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases, which would make n1/n2 increase.

Wait, but again, let me think about the numbers.

At T=6000 K, ΔE/(k T) = 16.55.

exp(-16.55) is a very small number. Let's compute it.

exp(-16) is about 1.125e-7. exp(-17) is about 3.17e-8.

So at T=6000 K, exp(-16.55) ≈ approx 2.3e-7.

At T=5500 K, ΔE/(k T) is about 18.08.

exp(-18.08) is roughly 1.4e-8.

So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Assuming that the statistical weights g1 and g2 are the same, which is possible if they are the same type of level (e.g., both have same spin, same multiplicity, etc.), but I don't think the problem gives us that info, so perhaps it's safe to assume g1 = g2, so the ratio becomes exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, n1/n2 at 6000 K is exp(-16.55) ≈ 2.3e-7.

At 5500 K, it's exp(-18.08) ≈ 1.4e-8.

So, the ratio when there are no spots is about 2.3e-7, and when there are spots, it's about 1.4e-8.

So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots, which matches the problem statement.

Now, the factor by which the ratio changes is (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots) = (2.3e-7) / (1.4e-8) ≈ 16.43.

Wait, but none of the options are that high. The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Hmm, that's way off. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I got the ratio wrong. Let me check the ratio again.

Wait, the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots.

In my calculation, at T=6000 K, the ratio is 2.3e-7, and at 5500 K, 1.4e-8. So the ratio without spots is about 16 times higher.

But the options don't have 16. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the energy levels. Maybe the transition is from level 2 to level 1, which would mean that E2 is higher than E1. Or perhaps the transition is from level 1 to level 2, but I have the energy levels flipped.

Wait, no. Because if the transition is from level 1 to level 2, then E2 is higher than E1, and the photon emitted would have energy E2-E1.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the transition in terms of the ionization. But no, the problem states that it's about Ti neutral atoms, so ionization is not the issue here.

Alternatively, perhaps the given transition corresponds to a wavelength that is longer than the calculated one. Wait, no, the problem says 1448 Å.

Wait, perhaps I shouldn't be using the energy difference in eV but in another unit. Let me re-calculate ΔE in J and then compute the exponent.

ΔE = 1.372e-18 J.

At T=6000 K, k*T is 1.38e-23 J/K * 6e3 K = 8.28e-20 J.

ΔE/(k T) = 1.372e-18 / 8.28e-20 ≈ 16.55.

Same as before.

At T=5500 K, k*T = 1.38e-23 *5.5e3 = 7.59e-20 J.

ΔE/(k T) = 1.372e-18 / 7.59e-20 ≈ 18.08.

So the exponent is the same as before.

Hmm, but the factor I got is around 16.4, which isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is not asking about the ratio n1/n2 but n2/n1?

Because if the ratio n2/n1 is higher when T is higher, then when the star has no spots (higher T), n2/n1 is higher, so n1/n2 is lower. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases, which would imply that n1/n2 is higher when T is higher. So I must have the ratio correct as n1/n2.

But then, the factor is ~16, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the energy calculation. Let me recompute ΔE.

Wait, 1448 Å is 1448 * 1e-10 meters. So,

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) = (1.9878e-25 J m) / (1.448e-7 m) = 1.373e-18 J.

Wait, yes, that's correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem is considering the reciprocal of the ratio? Because I'm getting a factor of 16, but the options are much smaller.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor is ratio_without_spots / ratio_with_spots.

In my calculation, that's about 16. So the factor is 16, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (n2/n1), which would change the calculation.

Wait, if the ratio is n2/n1, then without spots, it's higher.

Because n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

At higher T, n2/n1 increases because exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases.

So, when T is 6000 K, n2/n1 is (g2/g1) * exp(-16.55) ≈ (g2/g1) * 2.3e-7.

At 5500 K, n2/n1 is (g2/g1)* exp(-18.08) ≈ (g2/g1)*1.4e-8.

So, the ratio when no spots is (2.3e-7) and when spots is (1.4e-8), so the factor is (2.3e-7)/(1.4e-8) ≈ 16.43.

Same as before. So if the problem is referring to n2/n1, then the factor would be ~16, which is still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1, which is n2/n1.

In the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when without spots, n2/n1 is higher.

Which is what I've calculated. So the factor by which n2/n1 is higher when without spots is ~16.

But none of the options are near 16.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy calculation. Let me check another approach.

Wait, another way to calculate the exponent is using the relation between wavelength and temperature.

The exponent ΔE/(k T) can be written as hc/(λ k T).

So, hc/(λ k T) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 * T)

Simplify:

Numerator: 1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator: 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K * T = 1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 * T = 1.988e-29 * T.

So,

hc/(λ k T) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.988e-29 * T) ) ≈ (1e4) / T.

So, approximately, (ΔE)/(k T) ≈ (1e4)/T.

So for T=6000 K, it's 1e4/6e3 ≈ 1.666.

Wait, that's 1.666, not 16.55 as before. Wait, this is conflicting with my earlier calculation.

Wait, let me compute this properly.

Wait, hc/(lambda k T) = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (lambda *k* T )

= (1.9878e-25 J m) / (lambda * k * T )

lambda = 1448e-10 m.

k=1.38e-23 J/K.

So:

Denominator = 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K * T = 1448e-33 * T * 1.38 T = ?

Wait, 1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 = 1448 *1.38e-33 = approx 1996e-33 = 1.996e-30.

So denominator is 1.996e-30 * T.

So hc/(lambda k T) is (1.9878e-25) / (1.996e-30 * T ) = (1.9878e-25 / 1.996e-30 ) * (1/T )

= (1e5) * (1/T )

Wait, 1e5 is 100,000. So approximately, (ΔE)/(k T) ≈1e5 / T.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when T=6000 K, 1e5/6e3 ≈ 16.666. Which matches the previous calculation.

Ah, I see. So my initial calculation was correct, and the approximation (ΔE)/(k T) ≈ (1e4)/T was wrong.

So, back to the previous approach.

So, the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Assuming g1/g2 =1 (since the problem doesn't mention anything about statistical weights), then:

n1/n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

At T=6000 K: exp(-16.55) ≈ 2.3e-7.

At T=5500 K: exp(-18.08) ≈ 1.4e-8.

So, ratio without spots: 2.3e-7.

Ratio with spots: 1.4e-8.

The factor is (2.3e-7)/(1.4e-8 )= 16.43.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the star with spots has a lower effective temperature, but the photosphere's temperature isn't uniform. Wait, but the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases, so I think I should just use the given Teff for each case.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in each level, but considering the change in the star's luminosity. Because when the star has spots, part of its surface is cooler, but the overall luminosity is a combination of the spotted and unspotted regions.

Wait, but the problem says that when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So in that case, perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of spots reduces the star's overall luminosity, but the question is about the ratio in the photosphere, which may not have a uniform temperature. But the problem says to assume LTE, so I think they just want us to use the given Teff.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, the problem says that when spots are present, the overall effective temperature is 5500 K, but perhaps the photosphere is a mix of hotter and cooler regions. But that complicates things, and I don't think the question expects that level of detail.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is not about the ratio of the populations but about the equivalent width of the spectral line or something else. But the question clearly states it's about the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in two energy levels.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels, considering the change in the star's radius or luminosity.

Wait, but the star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and the problem says 40% of the surface is covered by spots. So the total surface area is 4π R², but 40% is covered by spots. But the problem gives the overall effective temperature as 5500 K, so perhaps that's the average.

Wait, but the specific question is about the ratio in the photosphere, which is in LTE. So I think the approach with using the Teff of 5500 K and 6000 K is correct.

Wait, but the factor I got is 16, which isn't in the options. The options are much lower, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking about the reciprocal of the ratio I calculated. So, if the ratio without spots is 2.3e-7 and with spots is 1.4e-8, the factor is 16. But perhaps the question is asking for the ratio when the star has spots divided by when it doesn't. So 1.4e-8 / 2.3e-7 = ~0.06, which is about 1/16. None of the options are that either.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference was miscalculated. Let me try using wavelength in meters again.

Wait, λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

ΔE = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) = 1.372e-18 J.

So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the transition is from level 2 to level 1, which would mean that E1 is higher than E2, which is unlikely. But let me try it.

If E1 > E2, then ΔE = E1 - E2 = 8.56 eV.

Then, the exponent becomes (E1 - E2)/(k T) = 8.56 eV / (k T in eV)

At T=6000 K, k T = 0.517 eV.

So, (E1-E2)/(k T) = 8.56 / 0.517 ≈ 16.55.

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp(16.55) which is a huge number, about 1e7.

At T=5500 K, (E1-E2)/(k T) = 8.56 / 0.4739 ≈ 18.08, so exp(18.08) is ~ 2e8.

Then, the ratio without spots is about 1e7, with spots ~2e8, so the factor is 1e7 / 2e8 = 0.05, which is about 1/20. Still not matching the options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach or perhaps consider that the problem is about the line profile rather than the population ratio.

Wait, another approach: the problem is about the ratio of the number of atoms in two levels, but perhaps considering that when spots are present, the star's surface is cooler, so the fraction of atoms in higher energy levels is less. So the ratio of lower to higher levels increases.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, higher T leads to a lower ratio n1/n2 if E2>E1. So when T decreases, n1/n2 increases.

Wait, no, when E2>E1, higher T makes n2 larger, so n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, let me think again. If E2>E1, at higher T, more atoms are in E2. So n2 is larger, n1 is smaller. So n1/n2 is smaller.

Therefore, when the star is hotter (no spots, 6000 K), n1/n2 is smaller than when it's cooler (spots, 5500 K). But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when it's cooler, the ratio is lower. That contradicts my previous conclusion.

Wait, perhaps the problem is the other way around. Maybe the ratio is n2/n1, which would indeed be higher when T is higher. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which would imply that n1/n2 is lower.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the ratio backwards. Let me re-express.

If the transition corresponds to a photon of wavelength 1448 Å, that photon is emitted when an atom moves from level 2 to level 1. So E2 > E1.

So, the number of atoms in level 2 is n2, and level 1 is n1.

The ratio of atoms in level 2 to level 1 is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, when T is higher, the exponent is less negative, so n2/n1 increases.

So when the star has spots (T=5500 K), n2/n1 is lower than when T=6000 K.

The problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio of n1/n2 (which is 1/(n2/n1)) decreases. So when T is lower, n1/n2 increases.

Wait, that doesn't fit. Because when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 is higher, but the problem says it's lower. So that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the ratio of the populations in the opposite way. Or perhaps the question is about N1/(N1+N2), the fraction of atoms in level 1.

Hmm, another approach: perhaps the ratio is (N_upper / N_lower), which is n2/n1.

In that case, when the star has spots, the ratio n2/n1 is lower than when it doesn't. So the factor would be (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots.

Which, as computed earlier, is 2.3e-7 / 1.4e-8 ≈ 16.43.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Which is (2.3e-7) / (1.4e-8 ) ≈ 16.43.

But that's not in the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the relative populations based on the Saha equation. But no, because the Saha equation relates ionization states, not different energy levels within the same ionization stage.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the ratio of the line strengths, which depends on the populations of the two levels. But the problem specifies the ratio of the number of atoms, not line strength.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the star's radius affects the number of atoms observed. Because when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the observed flux from the star decreases, but the problem states that the effective temperature has decreased to 5500 K. So perhaps the radius isn't directly relevant here, as the question is about the ratio in the photosphere, which is at the given Teff.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible options.

The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent sign.

Wait, if the ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)), then at higher T, this increases.

So, for T=6000 K, ΔE/(k T) = 16.55.

exp(16.55) is a huge number, about 1e7.

At T=5500 K, it's about 1.37e8.

So, the factor is (1e7)/(1.37e8) )= ~0.073, which is about 1/14.

But the question is about the factor when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, so it's 1e7 / 1e8 = 0.1, which is 1/10. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal, so 1e8 / 1e7 = 10. Still not matching the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's luminosity changes when spots are present, which affects the number of atoms in each level. But I don't think that's the case because the problem states to assume LTE.

Another idea: perhaps the energy levels are inverted, meaning that level 1 is higher than level 2. So E1 > E2.

In that case, ΔE = E1 - E2 = 8.56 eV.

The ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, for T=6000 K, exp(-16.55) is 2.3e-7.

For T=5500 K, exp(-18.08)=1.4e-8.

So, the ratio without spots is higher, as observed. The factor is 16.43.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1, which would be the inverse.

So, without spots, n2/n1 is (g2/g1)*exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Assuming g1/g2=1, n2/n1 = exp(-16.55)= 2.3e-7.

With spots, n2/n1=1.4e-8.

So, the factor is (2.3e-7)/(1.4e-8 )= 16.43.

Still the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the ratio of the number of excited atoms to ground state atoms, and in that case, the ratio would be much lower. But I don't think that's the case here.

Hmm. I'm starting to think that perhaps the problem is intended to use the ratio (n2/n1) and that the factor is about 16, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, perhaps I should use the reciprocal of the ratio.

Wait, if the ratio is n2/n1, which is exp(-16.55) ≈ 2.3e-7 at 6000 K, and 1.4e-8 at 5500 K.

So the factor is 2.3e-7 / 1.4e-8 = 16.43.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the problem is using the ratio (n1 + n2)/(n_upper), but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the Boltzmann factors without considering statistical weights.

Wait, suppose that the problem is considering the ratio (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), which would be very small. But that doesn't change the outcome.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio of the line strengths, which depends on the ratio of the populations and the transition probability. But the problem states it's about the ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels, so that's not applicable.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the star's surface area. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, perhaps the observed flux is a combination of the spotted and unspotted regions. But the problem states that the effective temperature is 5500 K, so I think that should be the overall T used.

Wait, perhaps the problem is mistakenly referring to the inverse ratio. Because in my calculation, the ratio n1/n2 is much higher when T is lower, which is when spots are present. So the factor is 16, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy calculation. Let me recompute ΔE in terms of eV.

h=6.626e-34 J s

c=3e8 m/s

λ=1448e-10 m.

ΔE = hc/λ = (6.626e-34)(3e8) / (1448e-10) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.372e-18 J.

Convert to eV:

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

ΔE = 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed to the answer based on the options given, even if my calculation doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are cooler, so the average T is lower, but the unspotted regions are hotter. So the photosphere isn't at a uniform 5500 K.

But the problem says to assume LTE, so perhaps the effective temperature is the average.

But I don't know how to proceed further. I'm going to have to make an educated guess based on my calculation leading to a factor of ~16, which isn't present. The closest option is B) ~7.8, which is roughly half of 16. Maybe I made a miscalculation in the exponent.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio as (n1 + n2)/n2. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the ratio is (n2/(n1 + n2)).

At T=6000 K:

n2 = exp(-16.55) n1 ≈ 2.3e-7 n1.

So, n2/(n1 + n2) ≈ 2.3e-7 n1 / (n1 (1+2.3e-7)) ≈ 2.3e-7.

At T=5500 K:

n2/(n1 + n2) ≈ 1.4e-8.

So the ratio is 2.3e-7 / 1.4e-8 ≈ 16. Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm out of ideas. Perhaps the intended approach was to compute the ratio using the exponent as (E2 - E1)/(k T), but not considering the statistical weights.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1, which would be exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

At T=6000 K: 2.3e-7.

At T=5500 K: 1.4e-8.

So the factor is 2.3e-7 /1.4e-8 ≈ 16.43.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended approach was different.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference was supposed to be calculated using a different wavelength. Alternatively, perhaps the transition corresponds to a different part of the spectrum, like visible light, but the problem states 1448 Å.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the reciprocal of the exponent. So, instead of 16.55, it's 1/16.55 ≈ 0.06.

Then, exp(0.06) ≈ 1.06.

So the ratio n1/n2 would be 1.06, which is close to option A) ~1.1.

But why would the exponent be 1/16.55? That doesn't make sense.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to select the closest option, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach and the correct answer is option B) ~7.8, which is close to 16 / 2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots reduce the effective temperature, but the actual temperature of the unspotted regions is higher. But I don't think that's the case here.

Another possibility is that the problem is using the ratio of the number of photons emitted, but that's not what the question is asking.

In the absence of a better approach, I'll proceed to choose the option that best fits my initial calculation, even though it's not present. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option D) ~2.9, which is close to 16^(1/2) ≈ 4, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent calculation. Let me compute the exponent again.

Wait, the exponent is ΔE/(k T).

For T=6000 K, ΔE/(k T) = 8.56 eV / (k *6000 K).

k in eV/K is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, 8.56 / (8.617e-5 *6000) )

Compute denominator: 8.617e-5 *6e3 = 0.517 eV.

So, 8.56 / 0.517 ≈ 16.55.

Same as before.

Hmmm.

I think I've spent enough time on this, and I'm not making progress. I'll make an educated guess based on the options. Since my calculation leads to a factor of about 16, which is not an option, perhaps the intended answer is B) ~7.8, which is about half of 16, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the natural log of the ratio.

ln(16.43) ≈ 2.8.

So, the factor is about e^(2.8) ≈ 16.4.

But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the reciprocal of the ratio, so 1/16.4 ≈ 0.06, which is about 1/16. Still not matching.

I'm stuck, but given the options, the closest I can think of is option B) ~7.8, perhaps from a miscalculation of the exponent as (1e4)/T.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use the ratio of temperatures.

The ratio of temperatures is 6000/5500 ≈ 1.09.

But how would that relate to the ratio of the population ratios?

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (Teff_with_spots / Teff_without_spots)^(ΔE/(k)).

But that doesn't make sense dimensionally.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (Teff_without / Teff_with)^(ΔE/(k)).

But I'm not sure.

Wait, if I take the ratio as (6000/5500)^ (ΔE/(k)).

But that's 1.09^(8.56eV/(k)).

Wait, but k is in J/K. Let me compute it.

Wait, 8.56 eV = 8.56 *1.602e-19 J ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

k=1.38e-23 J/K.

So, 8.56 eV/(k) = 1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ 9.95e4.

So, (6000/5500)^(9.95e4) ≈ (1.09)^(9.95e4) ≈ a huge number, which is not helpful.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possible approaches and can't find a way to reach any of the given options. I'll have to conclude that the intended answer is option B) ~7.8, but I'm not confident.

The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature, $T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K}$) to having spots ($T_{\text{eff}} = 5500 \, \text{K}$). The ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where $g_1$ and $g_2$ are the statistical weights of the energy levels, $\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the levels, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of $1448 \, \text{Å}$, so $\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$ is calculated as:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts ($1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}$):

\[
\Delta E \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The Boltzmann factor $\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)$ is computed for both temperatures:

1. **At $T = 6000 \, \text{K}$**:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k T} = \frac{8.56}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot 6000} \approx 16.55,
   \]
   \[
   \exp(-16.55) \approx 2.3 \times 10^{-7}.
   \]

2. **At $T = 5500 \, \text{K}$**:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k T} = \frac{8.56}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot 5500} \approx 18.08,
   \]
   \[
   \exp(-18.08) \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-8}.
   \]

The ratio of the populations without spots to with spots is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\exp(-16.55)}{\exp(-18.08)} = \frac{2.3 \times 10^{-7}}{1.4 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 16.43.
\]

This calculation yields a factor of approximately $16.43$, but none of the provided options match this value. The closest option is **B) ~7.8**, which is roughly half of the computed factor. Given the discrepancy and the lack of further clarity, the most reasonable choice based on the options is:

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this stuff. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a star's photosphere and how the presence of dark spots affects the ratio of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels. Hmm, I remember that when stars have spots, they can change their overall brightness and temperature, but I'm not exactly sure how that connects to the energy levels of atoms in their atmosphere.

Let me read the problem again. The star has a 1.5 solar radius and 1.1 solar masses. Without spots, its effective temperature (Teff) is 6000 K. But when 40% of its surface is covered by spots, the overall Teff drops to 5500 K. The question is about the ratio of the number of neutral Ti atoms in two energy levels: level 1 and level 2.

They mention that when the star has spots, this ratio decreases. So, when there are spots, the ratio N1/N2 is lower than when there are no spots. We need to find the factor by which this ratio changes. The options are given as A, B, C, D with numbers like ~1.1, ~7.8, etc.

Wait, I think this has to do with the Boltzmann equation, which describes the distribution of particles in different energy states. The Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(kT)), where ΔE is the energy difference between the two states, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature.

So, the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by (n1/n2) = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ), where g1 and g2 are the statistical weights of the levels.

But wait, the problem says that the transition between these levels corresponds to 1448 Å. That's in the ultraviolet range, I think. So, the energy difference ΔE can be found using the relation E = hc/λ. Let me calculate that.

H is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. C is speed of light, about 3.0 x10^8 m/s. λ is 1448 Å, which is 1448 x 10^-10 meters.

So, ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1448e-10) = let's compute that.

Wait 1448e-10 meters is 1.448e-7 meters. So, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25. Divided by 1.448e-7 is approximately 1.373e-18 J per photon. Hmm, but wait, for the energy difference between the levels, since the transition corresponds to that wavelength, it's the energy difference between level 2 and level 1, assuming that when the atom absorbs that photon, it jumps from level 1 to 2. Or wait, wait: if a photon of wavelength 1448Å is emitted when an atom transitions from level 2 to level 1, then E2 - E1 = hc/λ. Alternatively, if the transition is from level 1 to 2, then E1 < E2, so ΔE = E2 - E1 = hc/λ.

But for the Boltzmann equation, the exponent is (E1 - E2)/(k T). So if E2 > E1, then (E1 - E2) is negative. So the exponent is negative, and the ratio n1/n2 will be less than 1.

But wait, the problem states that when the star has spots, the overall temperature of the photosphere is lower. So when spots are present, Teff is 5500 K, whereas without spots, it's 6000 K.

Wait, no: the Teff is given when the star does not have spots as 6000 K, and when it has spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So when we're considering the ratio N1/N2, which is the number of atoms in level 1 over level 2, how does this change when T drops from 6000 K to 5500 K.

Wait, the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So without spots, N1/N2 is higher than when there are spots. So, when T is higher, the ratio is higher.

So let me think: the ratio of the number of atoms in two energy levels is given by n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E1 - E2)/(k T) )

Wait, but E1 and E2 are the energies of the two levels. If the transition is from level 1 to level 2, then E2 = E1 + ΔE, so E1 - E2 = -ΔE. So the exponent becomes (E1 - E2)/(k T) = (-ΔE)/(k T), which is negative.

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, no: because E1 < E2. So E1 - E2 = -ΔE. So the exponent is (-ΔE)/(k T), which is negative. So exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) = 1 / exp(ΔE/(k T)).

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) / exp(ΔE/(k T)) )

So when temperature T increases, the denominator increases because exp(ΔE/(k T)) gets larger, so the ratio n1/n2 would decrease. Wait, no: exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases as T increases, so denominator increases, so n1/n2 decreases. So higher T leads to lower n1/n2.

But in the problem, when the star has spots, the overall T is lower (5500 K) compared to 6000 K. So when T is lower, the ratio n1/n2 would be higher. Because, let's see: if T decreases, the denominator becomes smaller, so the ratio n1/n2 would increase. So without spots, T is 6000 K, so n1/n2 is lower than when T is 5500 K. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait: problem says when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So without spots, the ratio is higher.

Hmm. Maybe I have the ratio backwards. Let me double-check. The problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So without spots, the ratio is higher.

Wait, the ratio is N1/N2. So when the star has spots, N1/N2 is lower. So when Teff is 5500 K, N1/N2 is lower than when Teff was 6000 K.

Wait, but according to the Boltzmann equation, higher T would reduce N1/N2 because the exponent becomes more negative, leading to lower n1/n2. So if, when T increases, N1/N2 decreases. So when the star has spots, T is lower, so N1/N2 should increase. But the problem says it decreases. Hmm, that's conflicting. So I must have made a mistake in the direction.

Wait, maybe I got the energy levels the opposite way. Let me think again. If the transition corresponds to 1448Å, which is in the UV. Suppose that when the star is hotter (6000 K), the higher energy level is populated more. Wait, no, higher T makes the lower energy levels more populated?

Wait, the Boltzmann distribution states that higher energy levels are populated more in higher temperatures. So if the energy of level 2 is higher than level 1, then higher T would cause more atoms to be in level 2. Thus, N2 increases, N1 decreases, so N1/N2 decreases.

So, when T is 6000 K, without spots, N1/N2 is lower than when T is 5500 K. Because N1/N2 is (n1/n2) which is (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1-E2)/(k T) )

Wait, wait, no. Let me write it again. Let E2 be higher than E1. So E1 - E2 = -ΔE. So the exponent is (-ΔE)/(k T). So the ratio is (g1/g2) * exp( - (ΔE)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me re-derive the Boltzmann equation correctly.

The ratio of populations is given by:

n_j / n_i = (g_j / g_i) * exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) )

Assuming E_j > E_i, so E_j - E_i is positive. So n_j/n_i = (g_j/g_i) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, for two levels 1 and 2, where E2 > E1.

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( - (E2-E1)/(k T) )

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Which is same as (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T) )

So, when T increases, the exponent increases, so n1/n2 increases if (g1/g2) is a constant (assuming ΔE is positive).

Wait, no. Because if E2 > E1, ΔE is positive.

So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) )

So, as T increases, the exponent becomes larger, so n1/n2 increases. So for higher T, more atoms are in the lower energy level (level 1) compared to level 2, but that's only if the ratio of statistical weights is such. Wait, no, wait: n1 is in the lower energy level, n2 is in higher. So, when T increases, the ratio n1/n2 increases because the exponential grows. So, more atoms in level 1 compared to level 2 when T is higher.

But wait, that can't be right because higher T should populate higher energy states more. So maybe I made a mistake in which level is which.

Wait, wait. Maybe I have the ratio reversed. Let me see: if I have two energy levels, E1 < E2. At higher T, the distribution is more spread out, so a higher fraction of atoms are in higher energy levels.

So, n2 increases, so n2/n1 increases. So, n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) would decrease. So, if T increases, n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because if T is higher, more atoms are in level 2, so n2 is larger, so n1/n2 is smaller.

So, let me re-express the ratio.

n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) )

= (g1/g2) * exp( (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Wait, earlier I thought E2 - E1 is ΔE, so positive. So then, n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)). So as T increases, exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases, so n1/n2 increases. That would mean more atoms in level 1 than level 2 when T is higher. But that doesn't make sense because higher T should lead to more atoms in higher energy levels.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think differently: when T increases, the thermal energy is higher, so more atoms can be excited to higher energy levels. So, if level 2 is higher than level 1, then a higher T would mean more atoms in level 2. So n2 increases, n1 decreases, so n1/n2 decreases.

So, the ratio n1/n2 should decrease with increasing T.

Wait, so let me correct the equation. The correct ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Which is (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Because E2 > E1, so E2 - E1 = ΔE.

So in that case, as T increases, exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) increases because the exponent becomes less negative. So n1/n2 would increase when T increases.

Wait, that's conflicting with the intuition. Let me take a concrete example.

Suppose ΔE is 1 eV.

At T=1000 K, 1 eV/(k*1000 K) is about 1/(8.617e-5 * 1e3) ) ? Wait, 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So ΔE/(k*T) = (1.602e-19 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * 1e3 K) )

= (1.602e-19) / (1.38e-20) ) ≈ 11.61. So exp(-11.61) is a very small number, about 1e-5.

So n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * 1e-5. So n1 is much smaller than n2.

At T=10,000 K, same ΔE: 1eV/(k*1e4) = (1.602e-19) / (1.38e-23 * 1e4) )

= 1.602e-19 / 1.38e-19 ≈ 1.16. So exp(-1.16) ≈ 0.313.

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * 0.313. So n1 is about 0.3 times n2.

So, as T increases, n1/n2 increases, but from 1e-5 to 0.3. Wait, but that's a huge increase. So n1 is now 30% of n2. That would mean more atoms in level 2 than level 1 when T is higher.

Wait, but if n1/n2 increases, that would mean n1 is larger than n2. Which would imply that level 1 is more populated than level 2. But for higher T, level 2 should be more populated.

Hmm, maybe I messed up the ratio. Maybe the ratio is n2/n1.

Wait, yes! Because sometimes the ratio is written as n_j/n_i, but sometimes it's the other way around. So I need to be precise.

The Boltzmann equation says:

n_j / n_i = (g_j/g_i) * exp( -(E_j - E_i)/(k T) )

So, if j is level 2 and i is level 1, then E_j > E_i, so E_j - E_i is positive.

n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, as T increases, exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) increases (since the exponent becomes less negative), so n2/n1 increases. So more atoms in level 2 when T is higher.

Therefore, n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, no. Because n1/n2 = 1/(n2/n1) = 1 / [ (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) ) ] = (g1/g2) * exp( ΔE/(k T) )

So, as T increases, exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases, making n1/n2 increase. Which would mean more atoms in level 1 than level 2 as T increases, which contradicts the expectation.

Hmm, that's confusing. What's going on here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ratio. Let me take a simple example.

Suppose we have two energy levels, E1 and E2, with E2 > E1. We want to know whether n2 increases or n1 increases with T.

At very high T, most atoms are in the higher energy levels because they have enough thermal energy to reach them. So n2 should be larger than n1.

So n2/n1 should be greater than 1, and increasing with T.

From the Boltzmann equation, n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Wait, when T is high, -ΔE/(k T) is a small negative number. So exp(small negative) is about 1 - x, but that's not right. For example, if ΔE/(k T) is small, then exp(-ΔE/(k T)) ≈ 1 - ΔE/(k T). So, n2/n1 ≈ (g2/g1) * (1 - ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, but that would imply that as T increases, n2/n1 increases if (g2/g1) is greater than 1. Or maybe not. Wait, I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me compute the ratio when T is 6000 K and when it's 5500 K.

The problem states that when the star has 40% spots, the overall Teff is 5500 K. So, when the spots are present, the photosphere's effective temperature is lower.

According to the problem, the ratio N1/N2 (n1/n2) decreases when the star has spots. So, when T is 5500 K, N1/N2 is lower than when T is 6000 K.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T) )

So, when T is higher, ΔE/(k T) is smaller, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) is smaller. Therefore, n1/n2 is smaller when T is higher. Wait, that can't be right. Because if T increases, ΔE/(k T) decreases, so exp(ΔE/(k T)) increases? Wait no, because as T increases, the denominator increases, so ΔE/(k T) becomes smaller. So exp(small number) is larger than exp(bigger negative number).

Wait, let me compute for T=6000 K and T=5500 K.

Compute for each T, the exponent ΔE/(k T), and see how it affects the ratio.

First, compute ΔE.

ΔE = hc/λ.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

ΔE = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7 )

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m

Divide by 1.448e-7 m:

1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1.372e-18 J = (1.372e-18)/(1.602e-19) eV ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wait, that's a big energy difference. So 8.56 eV between the two levels.

But wait, that seems way too high. Because typical atomic transitions are in the range of a few eV. Wait, 1448 Å is 0.1448 nm, which is in the UV. So the energy is about 8.56 eV, which is higher than the ionization energy of many atoms. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recompute.

Wait, 1448 Angstroms is 1448 * 1e-10 meters = 1.448e-7 meters. So:

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3e8 m/s) / (1.448e-7 m)

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 1.448e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = approximately 1.372e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so ΔE = 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV.

Wow, that's a very large energy difference. So, the transition is from level 1 to level 2, which is a high-energy photon. So, in the UV range.

But how does that affect the population of the two levels?

Well, the exponent in the Boltzmann factor is ΔE/(k T). Let's compute that for T = 6000 K and T = 5500 K.

k (Boltzmann constant) is 1.38e-23 J/K.

Compute for T=6000 K:

ΔE/(k T) = (8.56 eV) / (k*T in eV/(K))

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of eV.

Wait, 1 eV/(k) is approximately 11605 K. Because k is about 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, k*T (in eV) = (8.617e-5 eV/K) * T.

So for T=6000 K: k*T = 8.617e-5 * 6000 ≈ 0.517 eV.

So ΔE/(k T) = (8.56 eV) / (0.517 eV) ≈ 16.55.

Similarly, for T=5500 K: k*T = 8.617e-5 * 5500 ≈ 0.4739 eV.

ΔE/(k T) = 8.56 / 0.4739 ≈ 18.08.

Wait, so for both cases, ΔE/(k T) is a large positive number, like around 16 to 18.

So the Boltzmann factor is exp(-ΔE/(k T)), but wait, in the ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp(ΔE/(k T)).

Wait, no, earlier I had to correct the ratio.

The correct ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( - (E2 - E1)/(k T) )

Which is (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So as T increases, -ΔE/(k T) becomes less negative, so exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases, which would make n1/n2 increase.

Wait, but again, let me think about the numbers.

At T=6000 K, ΔE/(k T) = 16.55.

exp(-16.55) is a very small number. Let's compute it.

exp(-16) is about 1.125e-7. exp(-17) is about 3.17e-8.

So at T=6000 K, exp(-16.55) ≈ approx 2.3e-7.

At T=5500 K, ΔE/(k T) is about 18.08.

exp(-18.08) is roughly 1.4e-8.

So, n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Assuming that the statistical weights g1 and g2 are the same, which is possible if they are the same type of level (e.g., both have same spin, same multiplicity, etc.), but I don't think the problem gives us that info, so perhaps it's safe to assume g1 = g2, so the ratio becomes exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, n1/n2 at 6000 K is exp(-16.55) ≈ 2.3e-7.

At 5500 K, it's exp(-18.08) ≈ 1.4e-8.

So, the ratio when there are no spots is about 2.3e-7, and when there are spots, it's about 1.4e-8.

So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots, which matches the problem statement.

Now, the factor by which the ratio changes is (ratio without spots) / (ratio with spots) = (2.3e-7) / (1.4e-8) ≈ 16.43.

Wait, but none of the options are that high. The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Hmm, that's way off. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I got the ratio wrong. Let me check the ratio again.

Wait, the problem states that the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So the ratio without spots is higher than with spots.

In my calculation, at T=6000 K, the ratio is 2.3e-7, and at 5500 K, 1.4e-8. So the ratio without spots is about 16 times higher.

But the options don't have 16. So something's wrong.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the energy levels. Maybe the transition is from level 2 to level 1, which would mean that E2 is higher than E1. Or perhaps the transition is from level 1 to level 2, but I have the energy levels flipped.

Wait, no. Because if the transition is from level 1 to level 2, then E2 is higher than E1, and the photon emitted would have energy E2-E1.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the transition in terms of the ionization. But no, the problem states that it's about Ti neutral atoms, so ionization is not the issue here.

Alternatively, perhaps the given transition corresponds to a wavelength that is longer than the calculated one. Wait, no, the problem says 1448 Å.

Wait, perhaps I shouldn't be using the energy difference in eV but in another unit. Let me re-calculate ΔE in J and then compute the exponent.

ΔE = 1.372e-18 J.

At T=6000 K, k*T is 1.38e-23 J/K * 6e3 K = 8.28e-20 J.

ΔE/(k T) = 1.372e-18 / 8.28e-20 ≈ 16.55.

Same as before.

At T=5500 K, k*T = 1.38e-23 *5.5e3 = 7.59e-20 J.

ΔE/(k T) = 1.372e-18 / 7.59e-20 ≈ 18.08.

So the exponent is the same as before.

Hmm, but the factor I got is around 16.4, which isn't among the options.

Wait, perhaps the question is not asking about the ratio n1/n2 but n2/n1?

Because if the ratio n2/n1 is higher when T is higher, then when the star has no spots (higher T), n2/n1 is higher, so n1/n2 is lower. But the problem says that when the star has spots, the ratio (n1/n2) decreases, which would imply that n1/n2 is higher when T is higher. So I must have the ratio correct as n1/n2.

But then, the factor is ~16, which isn't an option. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the energy calculation. Let me recompute ΔE.

Wait, 1448 Å is 1448 * 1e-10 meters. So,

ΔE = (6.626e-34 J s)(3e8 m/s) / (1448e-10 m) = (1.9878e-25 J m) / (1.448e-7 m) = 1.373e-18 J.

Wait, yes, that's correct.

Hmm, maybe the problem is considering the reciprocal of the ratio? Because I'm getting a factor of 16, but the options are much smaller.

Wait, the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots. So when the star doesn't have spots, the ratio is higher. So the factor is ratio_without_spots / ratio_with_spots.

In my calculation, that's about 16. So the factor is 16, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (n2/n1), which would change the calculation.

Wait, if the ratio is n2/n1, then without spots, it's higher.

Because n2/n1 = (g2/g1) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

At higher T, n2/n1 increases because exp(-ΔE/(k T)) increases.

So, when T is 6000 K, n2/n1 is (g2/g1) * exp(-16.55) ≈ (g2/g1) * 2.3e-7.

At 5500 K, n2/n1 is (g2/g1)* exp(-18.08) ≈ (g2/g1)*1.4e-8.

So, the ratio when no spots is (2.3e-7) and when spots is (1.4e-8), so the factor is (2.3e-7)/(1.4e-8) ≈ 16.43.

Same as before. So if the problem is referring to n2/n1, then the factor would be ~16, which is still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1, which is n2/n1.

In the problem, when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when without spots, n2/n1 is higher.

Which is what I've calculated. So the factor by which n2/n1 is higher when without spots is ~16.

But none of the options are near 16.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy calculation. Let me check another approach.

Wait, another way to calculate the exponent is using the relation between wavelength and temperature.

The exponent ΔE/(k T) can be written as hc/(λ k T).

So, hc/(λ k T) = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 * T)

Simplify:

Numerator: 1.9878e-25 J m.

Denominator: 1.448e-7 m * 1.38e-23 J/K * T = 1.448e-7 * 1.38e-23 * T = 1.988e-29 * T.

So,

hc/(λ k T) = (1.9878e-25) / (1.988e-29 * T) ) ≈ (1e4) / T.

So, approximately, (ΔE)/(k T) ≈ (1e4)/T.

So for T=6000 K, it's 1e4/6e3 ≈ 1.666.

Wait, that's 1.666, not 16.55 as before. Wait, this is conflicting with my earlier calculation.

Wait, let me compute this properly.

Wait, hc/(lambda k T) = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (lambda *k* T )

= (1.9878e-25 J m) / (lambda * k * T )

lambda = 1448e-10 m.

k=1.38e-23 J/K.

So:

Denominator = 1448e-10 m * 1.38e-23 J/K * T = 1448e-33 * T * 1.38 T = ?

Wait, 1448e-10 * 1.38e-23 = 1448 *1.38e-33 = approx 1996e-33 = 1.996e-30.

So denominator is 1.996e-30 * T.

So hc/(lambda k T) is (1.9878e-25) / (1.996e-30 * T ) = (1.9878e-25 / 1.996e-30 ) * (1/T )

= (1e5) * (1/T )

Wait, 1e5 is 100,000. So approximately, (ΔE)/(k T) ≈1e5 / T.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when T=6000 K, 1e5/6e3 ≈ 16.666. Which matches the previous calculation.

Ah, I see. So my initial calculation was correct, and the approximation (ΔE)/(k T) ≈ (1e4)/T was wrong.

So, back to the previous approach.

So, the ratio n1/n2 is (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

Assuming g1/g2 =1 (since the problem doesn't mention anything about statistical weights), then:

n1/n2 = exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

At T=6000 K: exp(-16.55) ≈ 2.3e-7.

At T=5500 K: exp(-18.08) ≈ 1.4e-8.

So, ratio without spots: 2.3e-7.

Ratio with spots: 1.4e-8.

The factor is (2.3e-7)/(1.4e-8 )= 16.43.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the star with spots has a lower effective temperature, but the photosphere's temperature isn't uniform. Wait, but the problem states that the overall photospheric effective temperature decreases, so I think I should just use the given Teff for each case.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the ratio of the number of Ti atoms in each level, but considering the change in the star's luminosity. Because when the star has spots, part of its surface is cooler, but the overall luminosity is a combination of the spotted and unspotted regions.

Wait, but the problem says that when the spots are present, the overall photospheric effective temperature is 5500 K. So in that case, perhaps the entire photosphere is at 5500 K. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of spots reduces the star's overall luminosity, but the question is about the ratio in the photosphere, which may not have a uniform temperature. But the problem says to assume LTE, so I think they just want us to use the given Teff.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of another approach.

Wait, the problem says that when spots are present, the overall effective temperature is 5500 K, but perhaps the photosphere is a mix of hotter and cooler regions. But that complicates things, and I don't think the question expects that level of detail.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is not about the ratio of the populations but about the equivalent width of the spectral line or something else. But the question clearly states it's about the ratio of the number of neutral atoms in two energy levels.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels, considering the change in the star's radius or luminosity.

Wait, but the star's radius is 1.5 solar radii, and the problem says 40% of the surface is covered by spots. So the total surface area is 4π R², but 40% is covered by spots. But the problem gives the overall effective temperature as 5500 K, so perhaps that's the average.

Wait, but the specific question is about the ratio in the photosphere, which is in LTE. So I think the approach with using the Teff of 5500 K and 6000 K is correct.

Wait, but the factor I got is 16, which isn't in the options. The options are much lower, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking about the reciprocal of the ratio I calculated. So, if the ratio without spots is 2.3e-7 and with spots is 1.4e-8, the factor is 16. But perhaps the question is asking for the ratio when the star has spots divided by when it doesn't. So 1.4e-8 / 2.3e-7 = ~0.06, which is about 1/16. None of the options are that either.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the energy difference was miscalculated. Let me try using wavelength in meters again.

Wait, λ = 1448 Å = 1448e-10 m = 1.448e-7 m.

ΔE = hc/λ = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (1.448e-7) = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (1.448e-7 m) = 1.372e-18 J.

So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the transition is from level 2 to level 1, which would mean that E1 is higher than E2, which is unlikely. But let me try it.

If E1 > E2, then ΔE = E1 - E2 = 8.56 eV.

Then, the exponent becomes (E1 - E2)/(k T) = 8.56 eV / (k T in eV)

At T=6000 K, k T = 0.517 eV.

So, (E1-E2)/(k T) = 8.56 / 0.517 ≈ 16.55.

So n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( (E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp(16.55) which is a huge number, about 1e7.

At T=5500 K, (E1-E2)/(k T) = 8.56 / 0.4739 ≈ 18.08, so exp(18.08) is ~ 2e8.

Then, the ratio without spots is about 1e7, with spots ~2e8, so the factor is 1e7 / 2e8 = 0.05, which is about 1/20. Still not matching the options.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach or perhaps consider that the problem is about the line profile rather than the population ratio.

Wait, another approach: the problem is about the ratio of the number of atoms in two levels, but perhaps considering that when spots are present, the star's surface is cooler, so the fraction of atoms in higher energy levels is less. So the ratio of lower to higher levels increases.

But according to the Boltzmann equation, higher T leads to a lower ratio n1/n2 if E2>E1. So when T decreases, n1/n2 increases.

Wait, no, when E2>E1, higher T makes n2 larger, so n1/n2 decreases.

Wait, let me think again. If E2>E1, at higher T, more atoms are in E2. So n2 is larger, n1 is smaller. So n1/n2 is smaller.

Therefore, when the star is hotter (no spots, 6000 K), n1/n2 is smaller than when it's cooler (spots, 5500 K). But the problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio decreases. So when it's cooler, the ratio is lower. That contradicts my previous conclusion.

Wait, perhaps the problem is the other way around. Maybe the ratio is n2/n1, which would indeed be higher when T is higher. But the problem says the ratio decreases when the star has spots, which would imply that n1/n2 is lower.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the ratio backwards. Let me re-express.

If the transition corresponds to a photon of wavelength 1448 Å, that photon is emitted when an atom moves from level 2 to level 1. So E2 > E1.

So, the number of atoms in level 2 is n2, and level 1 is n1.

The ratio of atoms in level 2 to level 1 is n2/n1 = (g2/g1) exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, when T is higher, the exponent is less negative, so n2/n1 increases.

So when the star has spots (T=5500 K), n2/n1 is lower than when T=6000 K.

The problem states that when the star has spots, the ratio of n1/n2 (which is 1/(n2/n1)) decreases. So when T is lower, n1/n2 increases.

Wait, that doesn't fit. Because when the star has spots, the ratio n1/n2 is higher, but the problem says it's lower. So that's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the ratio of the populations in the opposite way. Or perhaps the question is about N1/(N1+N2), the fraction of atoms in level 1.

Hmm, another approach: perhaps the ratio is (N_upper / N_lower), which is n2/n1.

In that case, when the star has spots, the ratio n2/n1 is lower than when it doesn't. So the factor would be (n2/n1)_no_spots / (n2/n1)_spots.

Which, as computed earlier, is 2.3e-7 / 1.4e-8 ≈ 16.43.

Still not matching the options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal. So the factor is (n1/n2)_no_spots / (n1/n2)_spots.

Which is (2.3e-7) / (1.4e-8 ) ≈ 16.43.

But that's not in the options.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the relative populations based on the Saha equation. But no, because the Saha equation relates ionization states, not different energy levels within the same ionization stage.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the ratio of the line strengths, which depends on the populations of the two levels. But the problem specifies the ratio of the number of atoms, not line strength.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the star's radius affects the number of atoms observed. Because when 40% of the surface is covered by spots, the observed flux from the star decreases, but the problem states that the effective temperature has decreased to 5500 K. So perhaps the radius isn't directly relevant here, as the question is about the ratio in the photosphere, which is at the given Teff.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me think about the possible options.

The options are A) ~1.1, B) ~7.8, C) ~4.5, D) ~2.9.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent sign.

Wait, if the ratio is n1/n2 = (g1/g2) exp(ΔE/(k T)), then at higher T, this increases.

So, for T=6000 K, ΔE/(k T) = 16.55.

exp(16.55) is a huge number, about 1e7.

At T=5500 K, it's about 1.37e8.

So, the factor is (1e7)/(1.37e8) )= ~0.073, which is about 1/14.

But the question is about the factor when the star does not have spots compared to when it has spots, so it's 1e7 / 1e8 = 0.1, which is 1/10. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the reciprocal, so 1e8 / 1e7 = 10. Still not matching the options.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the star's luminosity changes when spots are present, which affects the number of atoms in each level. But I don't think that's the case because the problem states to assume LTE.

Another idea: perhaps the energy levels are inverted, meaning that level 1 is higher than level 2. So E1 > E2.

In that case, ΔE = E1 - E2 = 8.56 eV.

The ratio n1/n2 = (g1/g2) * exp( -(E1 - E2)/(k T) ) = (g1/g2) * exp( -ΔE/(k T) )

So, for T=6000 K, exp(-16.55) is 2.3e-7.

For T=5500 K, exp(-18.08)=1.4e-8.

So, the ratio without spots is higher, as observed. The factor is 16.43.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1, which would be the inverse.

So, without spots, n2/n1 is (g2/g1)*exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

Assuming g1/g2=1, n2/n1 = exp(-16.55)= 2.3e-7.

With spots, n2/n1=1.4e-8.

So, the factor is (2.3e-7)/(1.4e-8 )= 16.43.

Still the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the ratio of the number of excited atoms to ground state atoms, and in that case, the ratio would be much lower. But I don't think that's the case here.

Hmm. I'm starting to think that perhaps the problem is intended to use the ratio (n2/n1) and that the factor is about 16, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent.

Wait, perhaps I should use the reciprocal of the ratio.

Wait, if the ratio is n2/n1, which is exp(-16.55) ≈ 2.3e-7 at 6000 K, and 1.4e-8 at 5500 K.

So the factor is 2.3e-7 / 1.4e-8 = 16.43.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the problem is using the ratio (n1 + n2)/(n_upper), but that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the ratio of the Boltzmann factors without considering statistical weights.

Wait, suppose that the problem is considering the ratio (n_upper)/(n_lower) = exp( -ΔE/(k T) ), which would be very small. But that doesn't change the outcome.

Hmm. I'm not making progress here. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the ratio of the line strengths, which depends on the ratio of the populations and the transition probability. But the problem states it's about the ratio of the number of atoms in the two levels, so that's not applicable.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the star's surface area. When 40% of the surface is covered by spots, perhaps the observed flux is a combination of the spotted and unspotted regions. But the problem states that the effective temperature is 5500 K, so I think that should be the overall T used.

Wait, perhaps the problem is mistakenly referring to the inverse ratio. Because in my calculation, the ratio n1/n2 is much higher when T is lower, which is when spots are present. So the factor is 16, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the energy calculation. Let me recompute ΔE in terms of eV.

h=6.626e-34 J s

c=3e8 m/s

λ=1448e-10 m.

ΔE = hc/λ = (6.626e-34)(3e8) / (1448e-10) = 1.9878e-25 / 1.448e-7 = 1.372e-18 J.

Convert to eV:

1 eV = 1.602e-19 J.

ΔE = 1.372e-18 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 8.56 eV.

Yes, correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should proceed to the answer based on the options given, even if my calculation doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that the spots are cooler, so the average T is lower, but the unspotted regions are hotter. So the photosphere isn't at a uniform 5500 K.

But the problem says to assume LTE, so perhaps the effective temperature is the average.

But I don't know how to proceed further. I'm going to have to make an educated guess based on my calculation leading to a factor of ~16, which isn't present. The closest option is B) ~7.8, which is roughly half of 16. Maybe I made a miscalculation in the exponent.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the ratio as (n1 + n2)/n2. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the ratio is (n2/(n1 + n2)).

At T=6000 K:

n2 = exp(-16.55) n1 ≈ 2.3e-7 n1.

So, n2/(n1 + n2) ≈ 2.3e-7 n1 / (n1 (1+2.3e-7)) ≈ 2.3e-7.

At T=5500 K:

n2/(n1 + n2) ≈ 1.4e-8.

So the ratio is 2.3e-7 / 1.4e-8 ≈ 16. Still not matching.

Hmm. I'm out of ideas. Perhaps the intended approach was to compute the ratio using the exponent as (E2 - E1)/(k T), but not considering the statistical weights.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the ratio of the number of atoms in level 2 to level 1, which would be exp(-ΔE/(k T)).

At T=6000 K: 2.3e-7.

At T=5500 K: 1.4e-8.

So the factor is 2.3e-7 /1.4e-8 ≈ 16.43.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended approach was different.

Wait, perhaps the energy difference was supposed to be calculated using a different wavelength. Alternatively, perhaps the transition corresponds to a different part of the spectrum, like visible light, but the problem states 1448 Å.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the reciprocal of the exponent. So, instead of 16.55, it's 1/16.55 ≈ 0.06.

Then, exp(0.06) ≈ 1.06.

So the ratio n1/n2 would be 1.06, which is close to option A) ~1.1.

But why would the exponent be 1/16.55? That doesn't make sense.

Hmm. I'm stuck. I think I'll have to select the closest option, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach and the correct answer is option B) ~7.8, which is close to 16 / 2.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the spots reduce the effective temperature, but the actual temperature of the unspotted regions is higher. But I don't think that's the case here.

Another possibility is that the problem is using the ratio of the number of photons emitted, but that's not what the question is asking.

In the absence of a better approach, I'll proceed to choose the option that best fits my initial calculation, even though it's not present. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option D) ~2.9, which is close to 16^(1/2) ≈ 4, but that's a stretch.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent calculation. Let me compute the exponent again.

Wait, the exponent is ΔE/(k T).

For T=6000 K, ΔE/(k T) = 8.56 eV / (k *6000 K).

k in eV/K is 8.617e-5 eV/K.

So, 8.56 / (8.617e-5 *6000) )

Compute denominator: 8.617e-5 *6e3 = 0.517 eV.

So, 8.56 / 0.517 ≈ 16.55.

Same as before.

Hmmm.

I think I've spent enough time on this, and I'm not making progress. I'll make an educated guess based on the options. Since my calculation leads to a factor of about 16, which is not an option, perhaps the intended answer is B) ~7.8, which is about half of 16, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the natural log of the ratio.

ln(16.43) ≈ 2.8.

So, the factor is about e^(2.8) ≈ 16.4.

But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the reciprocal of the ratio, so 1/16.4 ≈ 0.06, which is about 1/16. Still not matching.

I'm stuck, but given the options, the closest I can think of is option B) ~7.8, perhaps from a miscalculation of the exponent as (1e4)/T.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should use the ratio of temperatures.

The ratio of temperatures is 6000/5500 ≈ 1.09.

But how would that relate to the ratio of the population ratios?

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the ratio is (Teff_with_spots / Teff_without_spots)^(ΔE/(k)).

But that doesn't make sense dimensionally.

Alternatively, perhaps it's (Teff_without / Teff_with)^(ΔE/(k)).

But I'm not sure.

Wait, if I take the ratio as (6000/5500)^ (ΔE/(k)).

But that's 1.09^(8.56eV/(k)).

Wait, but k is in J/K. Let me compute it.

Wait, 8.56 eV = 8.56 *1.602e-19 J ≈ 1.372e-18 J.

k=1.38e-23 J/K.

So, 8.56 eV/(k) = 1.372e-18 / 1.38e-23 ≈ 9.95e4.

So, (6000/5500)^(9.95e4) ≈ (1.09)^(9.95e4) ≈ a huge number, which is not helpful.

Hmm.

I think I've exhausted all possible approaches and can't find a way to reach any of the given options. I'll have to conclude that the intended answer is option B) ~7.8, but I'm not confident.


The problem involves determining the factor by which the ratio of the number of neutral titanium (Ti) atoms in two energy levels changes when a star transitions from having no spots (effective temperature, $T_{\text{eff}} = 6000 \, \text{K}$) to having spots ($T_{\text{eff}} = 5500 \, \text{K}$). The ratio is governed by the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{n_1}{n_2} = \frac{g_1}{g_2} \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right),
\]

where $g_1$ and $g_2$ are the statistical weights of the energy levels, $\Delta E$ is the energy difference between the levels, $k$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature. The transition corresponds to a wavelength of $1448 \, \text{Å}$, so $\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$ is calculated as:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{1.448 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 1.372 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts ($1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}$):

\[
\Delta E \approx 8.56 \, \text{eV}.
\]

The Boltzmann factor $\exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{k T}\right)$ is computed for both temperatures:

1. **At $T = 6000 \, \text{K}$**:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k T} = \frac{8.56}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot 6000} \approx 16.55,
   \]
   \[
   \exp(-16.55) \approx 2.3 \times 10^{-7}.
   \]

2. **At $T = 5500 \, \text{K}$**:
   \[
   \frac{\Delta E}{k T} = \frac{8.56}{(8.617 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot 5500} \approx 18.08,
   \]
   \[
   \exp(-18.08) \approx 1.4 \times 10^{-8}.
   \]

The ratio of the populations without spots to with spots is:

\[
\text{Factor} = \frac{\exp(-16.55)}{\exp(-18.08)} = \frac{2.3 \times 10^{-7}}{1.4 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 16.43.
\]

This calculation yields a factor of approximately $16.43$, but none of the provided options match this value. The closest option is **B) ~7.8**, which is roughly half of the computed factor. Given the discrepancy and the lack of further clarity, the most reasonable choice based on the options is:

**Answer: B**
