Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in compounds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Optical activity means the compound has chirality, right? So I need to figure out which of these compounds have chiral centers or some sort of asymmetry that makes them capable of rotating plane-polarized light.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.
Wait, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(Cl)(CH3)? Or wait, butene is four carbons. So it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is Cl-C=C-CH(CH3). Wait, no, wait. Structure is CH2Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, maybe I should draw it. But wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, and a methyl attached to C2. So structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but that's but-1-ene, so positions 1 and 2 are double bond. So the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, and 2-methyl is a methyl on C2. So structure is Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no, but the double bond is between C1 and C2, which are both CH2 groups? No, wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would make it Cl attached to C1. So, the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Hmm, wait, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would make it Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, but the substituents are on the double bond carbons, right? So the structure would be CH2Cl and CH(CH3) connected by a double bond. So the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but that's three carbons. Oh, but but-1-ene is four carbons. So maybe it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2? Hmm, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's (Z)-configuration, but I'm not sure if this molecule has a chiral center. Let me think: does it have a carbon with four different groups attached? Looking at the structure, if the double bond is between C1 and C2, then C1 is Cl, CH2 on one side, and double bond to C2 which is CH(CH3) and another CH2. Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So C1 is Cl, two CH2 groups? Or maybe C1 is Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and then C3 and C4 are CH2 and CH3. But in any case, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond. Wait, but it's but-1-ene, so double bond. So the correct structure is Cl-CH2-C double bond CH(CH3). Wait, perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. But then, how many substituents does each carbon in the double bond have? For C1 (CH2Cl), the substituents are Cl, two CH2, and the double bond. So that's two CH2 groups and Cl â€” wait, that's same on two sides, so no, that can't be. Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with double bond between C1 and C2. So, C1 is CH2Cl, double bond to C2, which has CH(CH3), and then C3 is CH2, C4 is CH3. Wait, but if the double bond is between C1 and C2, then C1 has CH2Cl and two CH2 groups? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's not a chiral center here. Let me think about the possible stereoisomerism. Wait, but if the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that doesn't make sense because but-1-ene is four carbons. So maybe the correct structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2, but that's three carbons, which doesn't fit but-1-ene. Hmm, perhaps I should move on and come back.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione.
Wow, that's a mouthful. Okay, so methanoisobenzofuran sounds like a fused ring. Hexahydro implies six-membered ring or something. The substituent is a chloromethylene group, which is Cl-CH2- attached as a substituent. The stereochemistry is specified as E, which is about the configuration around the double bond. Now, whether the molecule has a chiral center. Well, the E configuration might not imply a chiral center, but perhaps the molecule has some other stereogenic centers. The (3aR,7aS) indicates two stereogenic centers. Oh, right, so that's two chiral centers, so the compound is chiral and would exhibit optical activity. So this one counts as active.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.
Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So if both CH2 groups are substituted with methyl, then positions 2 and 3. So the structure would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, the configuration is (2R,3S). So each of those CH(CH3) groups are attached to the second and third carbons of the succinic acid. So each of these carbons has four different groups: (for C2: R is CH3, and the other groups are COOH, CH(CH3), and the adjacent CH2). Hmm, wait, let's see: the C2 would have groups: COOH (from the first carbon), CH(CH3) (from C3), a methyl (from the substituent), and the adjacent CH(CH3) (from C1, which is actually a CH2 in succinic). Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, C2 would be connected to two CH(CH3) groups? Wait, no, each is substituted with a methyl. So for C2, the groups are: -CH3 (the substituent), -CH(CH3) (from C3), and two others. Wait, maybe each of the two central carbons (C2 and C3) have four different groups. Let me consider C2: attached to succinic acid chain, a methyl, and two other groups. Wait, the structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So, C2 is CH(CH3), connected to:

- The COOH group (from C1)
- The C3 (which is CH(CH3))
- A methyl group
- And another CH(CH3) from C3? No, wait, no, C2 is connected to C1 (which is CH2 in succinic acid except for the ends being COOH). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. The 2,3-dimethyl would add a methyl to each CH2, making them CH(CH3). So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has four substituents. Let's look at C2: it's connected to:

- COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (C3)
- Two CH3 groups (the substituents)
Wait, no. That's not right. Because each CH(CH3) has CH3 and three other substituents. Wait, for C2, it's attached to:

- The C1 (which is a CH2 connected to COOH)
- The C3 (which is CH(CH3))
- Two methyl groups? No, each is CH(CH3), so each has one methyl. Wait, perhaps each has CH3, CH(CH3), and two other things. So for C2, the groups would be:

- CH2COOH (on one side)
- CH(CH3) (on the other side)
- Two CH3 groups? No, wait, no. Each C2 is CH(CH3), so each has one CH3, and the other three bonds are to the chain. So C2 is attached to:

- C1: which is CH2COOH
- C3: which is CH(CH3)
- Two CH3 groups? No, wait, no. Wait, no, each CH(CH3) has one CH3 and three CH2 groups? I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps each of these central carbons (C2 and C3) has four distinct substituents, making them chiral centers. So for C2: the substituents are:

- The COOH group from C1 (which is HOOC-CH2-)
Wait, no, wait. Let me write the structure again. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Now, 2,3-dimethyl would make it HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has:

- One methyl group (CH3)
- Two CH2 groups (but wait, no, because they're attached to each other). Wait, each is CH(CH3), so each has the following groups attached: one CH3, one CH(CH3) (from the adjacent carbon), and two CH2 groups? No, I'm not getting it. Wait, each of these carbons is bonded to:

- The two adjacent carbons in the chain (C1 and C3)
- A methyl group
- And another group, which would be H? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because that would make C2 and C3 each have two CH3 groups and two CH2 groups, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Each CH(CH3) has one CH3 and three other substituents. So for C2, substituents are:

- COOH (from C1, which is actually a CH2 group, so C1 is CH2COOH)
Wait, no, wait. Let me number the carbons. The succinic acid is:

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH2
4: COOH

No, wait, wait, that's not right. Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So positions are:

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH2
4: COOH

So 2,3-dimethyl would be CH(CH3) on C2 and C3. So structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Now, each of those (C2 and C3) has:

For C2: groups attached are:

- C1: which is COOH (but wait, no, C1 is the first carbon, which is COOH. So C2 is attached to C1 (COOH-CH2), but wait, no. Wait, no, C2 is CH(CH3), connected to:

- C1: which is CH2 connected to COOH
- C3: which is CH(CH3)
- Two CH3 groups? No. Wait, each CH(CH3) has one CH3, and the other three bonds are to the adjacent carbons. So for C2, the substituents are:

- CH2COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Two CH3 groups? Or is that incorrect? Wait, no, each CH(CH3) has only one CH3. So the substituents are:

- The group from C1: which is CH2- (connected to COOH)
- The group from C3: which is CH(CH3)
- Two hydrogens?

Wait, no, each carbon has four bonds. So for C2:

- One bond to C1 (which is CH2-)
- One bond to C3 (which is CH(CH3))
- One bond to CH3 (the methyl group)
- The fourth bond is a hydrogen? No, wait, that can't be right because the molecule would have a hydrogen on C2. So the substituents are: CH2- (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), CH3, and H. Wait, but that would make four different groups: CH2COOH (wait, no, C1 is CH2, so perhaps it's just CH2 group), CH(CH3), CH3, and H. So yes, four different groups. Therefore, C2 is a chiral center. Similarly, C3 is a chiral center. So with (2R,3S) configuration, the molecule has two chiral centers and is chiral, so it's optically active. So this compound is active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.
Same structure as the previous one, but with (2R,3R) configuration. Does this make it chiral? Well, even if both are R, they are still chiral centers. So the molecule is chiral; it has two stereogenic centers. So this one is also optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.
Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol has a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group on C1. So structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and the OH on C1. Now, whether this molecule is chiral. The ring is part of a chiral center? Let me think. The OH is on C1, which is connected to the other carbons. Let's see, the substituents on C1: the OH, two adjacent CH2 groups (assuming the ring is chair-like), and the ring itself. Wait, but wait, in a cyclohexene ring, the substituents around C1 might not all be different. Alternatively, perhaps the ring has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents on C1 are symmetric, then it won't be a chiral center. Hmm, but wait, the ring is cyclohexene, which is a ring with a double bond. So, in cyclohex-3-ene, the double bond is between C3 and C4, making the ring have a certain structure. The OH is on C1. Let me draw this in my mind: C1 has OH, connected to C2 and C6. C2 is connected to C3, which is double-bonded to C4. So for C1, the substituents are:

- OH group
- Two CH2 groups (C2 and C6)
- And the ring.

Wait, but if C2 and C6 are both CH2, then C1 would have two identical substituents, making it not a chiral center. So, in that case, the molecule isn't chiral. Or wait, maybe the ring substituents make the groups around C1 different. Wait, perhaps the groups attached to C1 are: OH, two different CH2 groups (since C2 is adjacent to a double bond and C6 is not), and another CH group (maybe? Or is that not the case). Alternatively, perhaps C1 is connected to three different groups and the ring itself, making it a chiral center. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the ring is such that C1 has mirror symmetry, then the molecule would not be chiral. Alternatively, without any other substituents, if the ring is symmetric, then C1 wouldn't be a chiral center. But wait, the cyclohexene ring with double bond at 3-ene might not have that symmetry. Let me think: if it's cyclohex-3-ene, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the ring would have the structure where C2 and C5 are single bonds, and C3 and C4 are double-bonded. So, the substituents on C1 would be: OH, two CH2 groups (C2 and C6), and perhaps another CH group. Wait, but C2 is connected to the double bond, so perhaps C2 is a CH group. So, the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- CH (from C2)
- CH2 (from C6)
- The ring itself. Wait, but the ring itself is a cyclohexene, which might not make the substituents on C1 all different. Hmm, maybe the molecule isn't chiral. Alternatively, maybe the configuration is such that the C1 has four different groups, making it chiral. If so, then (R) configuration would make it a chiral center. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about whether a cyclohexene ring with substituents can lead to a chiral center. For example, cyclohexanol itself isn't chiral because the OH is on a carbon connected to two CH2 groups, a CH2, and the ring. But in this case, the ring has a double bond, so the substituents might be different. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond affects the substituents around C1. Let me think again: the groups on C1 are:

- OH
- Two adjacent carbons: one is C2, which is CH (since it's a double bond with C3), and C6, which is CH2 (since it's a single bond). So C1 is connected to:

OH, CH (C2), CH2 (C6), and the ring. But wait, the ring is a cyclohexene ring, so perhaps the substituents on C1 are not all different. Alternatively, if the ring is symmetric, perhaps C1 is not a chiral center. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule can be divided into mirror images, then it's not chiral. Alternatively, perhaps this molecule isn't chiral because the substituents on C1 are not all different. So, if C1 has two identical substituents, it's not a chiral center. So, perhaps this compound doesn't exhibit optical activity. Or wait, maybe it does. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the (R) configuration implies that there's a chiral center, so the molecule is chiral. So I'm a bit confused about this one. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another point: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. So, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? If the cyclohexene ring is symmetric with respect to the OH group, then maybe not. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not chiral because the substituents on C1 are such that it doesn't have four distinct groups. So, maybe this compound isn't chiral. Hmm, I'll have to leave this for now and come back.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol.
So, this is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5, and all in the s configuration. Now, whether this molecule is chiral. So, each of these hydroxyl groups is on a carbon with other substituents. Let me think: cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. If three alternate positions (1,3,5) have hydroxyl groups, what's the structure? Each of those carbons would be connected to two other carbons in the ring, an OH group, and a hydrogen. Wait, but each of those carbons would have three substituents: two from the ring (like CH2 groups), the OH, and a hydrogen. So, would each of those hydroxyl-bearing carbons have four different substituents? Let's see: for C1, the substituents would be:

- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6)
- OH
- H.

Wait, so substituents: two CH2 groups, an OH, and a hydrogen. But the two CH2 groups are on adjacent carbons, but are they the same? If the ring is symmetric, maybe the substituents on C1 are not all different. Alternatively, if each of the three OHs is on a carbon that has four different groups, then each is a chiral center. But wait, in this case, each carbon (C1, C3, C5) is attached to:

- Two adjacent ring carbons (each CH2 groups)
- An OH
- A hydrogen.

So for each of these, are the two adjacent CH2 groups identical? Let's see: for C1, the substituents are:

- C2: which is a CH2 connected to C3 (which has an OH)
- C6: which is a CH2 connected to C5 (which has an OH)
- OH
- H.

So, are the CH2 groups on either side of C1 the same? No, because C2 is connected to C3 (which has an OH), and C6 is connected to C5 (another OH). But perhaps the groups are not identical because each CH2 is part of a different part of the ring. So, in that case, each of the three carbons (C1, C3, C5) would have four different substituents: two distinct CH2 groups, OH, and H. Therefore, each is a chiral center. So, with three chiral centers, the molecule is chiral, so it's optically active. Therefore, this compound counts.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.
Structure: The butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(O)CH3. Wait, no: butan-1-one is (CH3)C(O)CH2CH2CH3? No, butan-1-one is (CH2CH2CH2CH3) with the ketone on C1. Wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(=O)-CH3. So, the structure is:

R-C(=O)-CH3, where R is (CH2)3.

But wait, in this compound, it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So, the structure is:

cyclopentyl group attached to C1 (the carbonyl carbon), and a methyl group on C3.

So, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

Wait, no, butan-1-one is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, butan-1-one is:

   O
   ||
CH2-C-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(=O)-. No, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(=O)-, but butanone is usually butan-2-one. Wait, butan-1-one would have the ketone on the first carbon, but that's not possible because a ketone requires two R groups attached to the carbonyl. So, butan-1-one would be:

CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(=O)- something? Wait, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that would be pentan-2-one, I think. Oh wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, butan-1-one would be:

CH3-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-R.

No, wait, but butan-1-one would be impossible because the carbonyl group must have two alkyl groups attached. So, butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-? No, that's impossible because it would be a terminal carbonyl group, which isn't possible in ketones. So perhaps the correct structure is:

Butan-1-one is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's pentan-2-one. Hmm, maybe the name is incorrect, but perhaps the actual structure is (cyclopentyl) attached to the carbonyl, and a methyl on the third carbon.

So, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

Wait, but that would make it 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the molecule is O=C-(CH2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

Now, does this have a chiral center? Let's look at the carbons. The carbonyl is on C1. Then, C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH2 attached to cyclopentyl. So the possible chiral centers are at C3. Let's check C3: what are the four groups attached? 

- The carbonyl group (from C2)
- A methyl group (from the CH(CH3))
- Two CH2 groups (from C3 to C4 and C3 to the cyclopentyl? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the molecule as:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

So the carbons are:

1: C=O connected to C2.
2: CH2 connected to C1 and C3.
3: CH(CH3) connected to C2 and C4.
4: CH2 connected to C3 and the cyclopentyl group.

So, C3 is CH(CH3). The groups attached to C3 are:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH(CH3)
- CH2 (from C4)
- And the cyclopentyl group? No, wait, C4 is CH2 connected to the cyclopentyl. So, the groups on C3 are:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH2 (from C4)
- CH3 (the substituent)
- And the cyclopentyl? No, the cyclopentyl is on C4. So, perhaps C3's substituents are:

- CH2 (C2)
- CH(CH3) (itself)
- CH2 (C4)
- And what else? Wait, no, each carbon has four bonds. So, for C3, the substituents are:

- C2: CH2
- C4: CH2
- CH3 (methyl)
- And another group? Oh, wait, perhaps the substituent is a hydrogen. No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the groups are:

- C2: CH2CO
- C4: CH2CH2
- CH3
- And a hydrogen. No, that wouldn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps C3 is CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), and the fourth substituent is a hydrogen. So, the substituents are:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH2 (from C4)
- CH3 (the substituent)
- H.

So, four different groups? CH2, CH2 (but they're connected to different parts), CH3, and H. Are the two CH2 groups identical? No, because one is connected to C2 (which leads to the carbonyl), and the other is connected to C4 (which leads to the cyclopentyl). So, the substituents on C3 are four different groups: two distinct CH2 groups (since their surroundings are different), a CH3, and H. Therefore, C3 is a chiral center. So this molecule has a chiral center and would be optically active.

Wait, but wait, is the molecule symmetrical in any way? Because the cyclopentyl is a large group, but unless there's a plane of symmetry, the molecule might be chiral. So, yeah, I think this molecule is chiral and would exhibit optical activity.

Now, let's count how many are active.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should reevaluate. Let's think about the structure again. If the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2, but wait, that's three carbons, but but-1-ene is four. So perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, but with a double bond. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2, but that's only three carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is between C2 and C3, not C1 and C2. Wait, but the name is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure should be CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that doesn't include a double bond. Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is (Z)-configured around the double bond, but does that create any stereogenic centers? Wait, for a double bond to create a stereogenic center, the carbon must have four different groups. So, for the double bond, each carbon attached to the double bond must have four different groups. Let's think about C1 and C2.

If the structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, that would be CH2Cl=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2. So, C1: CH2Cl, C2: CH. Wait, no, but double bonds have two substituents on each carbon. So, for C1: groups are Cl, two CH2 groups, and the double bond. So, that's two CH2 groups, which are same, so no, C1 can't be a chiral center. Similarly, C2 has CH(CH3), maybe. Wait, no, if the structure is CH2Cl=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2, then C2 is CH connected to CH(CH3), CH2, and the double bond. So, for C2: substituents are CH(CH3), CH2Cl (through the double bond), and two Hs? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, C1: CH2Cl connected to the double bond, and C2: CH(CH3) connected to the double bond. So, the groups on C1 would be:

- Cl
- Two CH2 groups (from C1 and the other side of the double bond)
- And the double bond.

So, no, C1 won't have four different groups. Similarly, C2 would have:

- CH(CH3)
- Two CH2 groups (one from the double bond and one from the next carbon)
- And perhaps another group.

Wait, perhaps the molecule isn't chiral. So, perhaps this compound doesn't exhibit optical activity. So, maybe the answer is that it doesn't have optical activity.

To recap:

Compounds evaluated:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Maybe not chiral.

2. The (3aR,7aS,E) compound: Yes, chiral.

3. (2R,3S) dimethylsuccinic acid: Yes.

4. (2R,3R) dimethylsuccinic acid: Yes.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Maybe not chiral (or is it? Not sure.)

6. (1s,3s,5s) cyclohexane triol: Yes.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Yes.

Now, count the ones that are active.

2: active.

3: active.

4: active.

6: active.

7: active.

What about 5? If it's not chiral, then only 2,3,4,6,7 are active. So that's five. But wait, if 1 is not active, then it's 5. So the count would be 5. But the options are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

But wait, what about the first compound? If it's not chiral, then 5 active compounds.

Wait, but the first compound I'm not sure. Let me think again. Maybe the first compound is chiral. If the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2, but that's three carbons, which doesn't fit but-1-ene (which is four). Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene as CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, it would be CH2Cl=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2. But that doesn't make sense because but-1-ene is four carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the structure doesn't allow any chiral centers. So, perhaps the first compound isn't active.

So, in that case, the active compounds are 2,3,4,6,7: five in total. So the answer would be A)5.

But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The molecule is cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. The structure is a cyclohexene with the OH on C1. So, the substituents on C1 are:

- OH
- Two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6)
- And the ring.

Wait, but the ring is a six-membered ring. The substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (since C2 and C6 are CH2 groups)
- And the ring.

Wait, but the ring itself is a part of the structure, so the substituents would be:

- OH
- CH2-C3 (which is part of the double bond)
- CH2-C6 (which is single bond)
- And the ring.

Hmm, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the cyclohexene ring has a plane that makes the substituents on either side of C1 mirror images, then C1 wouldn't be a chiral center. Alternatively, if the substituents are all different, then it would be. So perhaps it's not chiral. So, if that's the case, then the first compound (number 5) isn't active, and the total active compounds are 2,3,4,6,7: five. But wait, the options have A as 5. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but I'm not confident about whether cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is chiral. Let me think again. If the hydroxyl is on a carbon that has four different substituents, then it's a chiral center. So, for C1 in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:

Substituents:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (but are they identical?)
- The ring.

In a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, the substituents on C1 are:

- OH
- CH2 connected to C2 (which is connected to C3, which is double-bonded)
- CH2 connected to C6 (which is connected to C5, which is single bonded)
- And the ring (which is symmetric in some way? Or not.)

If the substituents on either side of C1 are different, then it would be a chiral center. For example, if the groups on either side of C1 are not mirror images, then the carbon is chiral. So, perhaps the molecule is chiral. So, number 5 would be active. But earlier, I thought maybe it's not.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me summarize:

Active compounds:
2: yes
3: yes
4: yes
5: unsure
6: yes
7: yes

So, that's five if 5 is active, or four if not.

Wait, let me reevaluate. If the (R) configuration is given, that suggests that the molecule is chiral, so it must have a chiral center. So, if it's (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, then the OH is on a chiral center. So, in that case, it's active. So, that would make the fifth active compound. So the total is five.

But wait, the options don't have five as the first option. Wait, the options are: A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

So, if all except the first are active, and the first isn't, then the count would be five.

Wait, but earlier I thought the first compound isn't active, but if the others are, then answer is A)5.

Wait, but in the first compound, (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, if the structure is such that C1 has two identical substituents, it won't be a chiral center. So, for example, if C1 is Cl, and attached to two CH2 groups, and the double bond, then it can't be a chiral center. So, the first compound isn't active.

So, the active compounds are 2,3,4,6,7: five in total.

Thus, the correct answer is A)5.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality, which is the presence of a chiral center or another form of asymmetry that allows the molecule to have non-superimposable mirror images.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   The structure of this compound is CHâ‚‚Cl=CH-CH(CHâ‚ƒ)-CHâ‚ƒ. The double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents on these carbons are analyzed for chirality. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different groups. C1 has Cl, two CHâ‚‚ groups, and the double bond, which are not all distinct. Similarly, C2 has CH, CH(CHâ‚ƒ), CHâ‚ƒ, and the double bond, but the substituents are not all unique. Therefore, this compound is **not chiral** and does not exhibit optical activity.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This compound contains a fused ring system with two stereogenic centers at positions 3a and 7a, as indicated by the (3aR,7aS) notation. The presence of these stereogenic centers makes the molecule chiral, and it exhibits optical activity.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Succinic acid has the structure HOOC-CHâ‚‚-CHâ‚‚-COOH. Substituting methyl groups on C2 and C3 results in HOOC-CH(CHâ‚ƒ)-CH(CHâ‚ƒ)-COOH. Each of the central carbons (C2 and C3) has four different substituents: a methyl group, two different carbons from the succinic acid chain, and a hydrogen. These carbons are chiral centers, and the molecule is chiral. It exhibits optical activity.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound is structurally identical to the previous one, with the same substituents on C2 and C3. The (2R,3R) configuration confirms the presence of two chiral centers, making the molecule chiral and capable of exhibiting optical activity.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   This compound is a cyclohexene ring with an -OH group on C1. For C1 to be a chiral center, it must have four different substituents. The substituents are: -OH, two distinct CHâ‚‚ groups (one adjacent to the double bond and one not), and the ring. These substituents are all different, making C1 a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and exhibits optical activity.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. Each of these carbons has four different substituents: an -OH group, two distinct CHâ‚‚ groups, and a hydrogen. All three hydroxyl-bearing carbons are chiral centers, making the molecule chiral and capable of exhibiting optical activity.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   This compound has the structure O=C-CHâ‚‚-CH(CHâ‚ƒ)-CHâ‚‚-cyclopentyl. The carbon at C3 (CH(CHâ‚ƒ)) has four different substituents: a methyl group, two distinct CHâ‚‚ groups (one adjacent to the carbonyl and one adjacent to the cyclopentyl group), and a hydrogen. This makes C3 a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical activity.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are numbers **2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7**. However, based on the analysis, the correct count of optically active compounds is **5**.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this question about optical activity in compounds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. Optical activity means the compound has chirality, right? So I need to figure out which of these compounds have chiral centers or some sort of asymmetry that makes them capable of rotating plane-polarized light.

Let's go through each compound one by one.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene.
Wait, so the structure is CH2=CH-C(Cl)(CH3)? Or wait, butene is four carbons. So it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, but it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So structure is Cl-C=C-CH(CH3). Wait, no, wait. Structure is CH2Cl-C(CH2CH3)=CH2? No, maybe I should draw it. But wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, and a methyl attached to C2. So structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but that's but-1-ene, so positions 1 and 2 are double bond. So the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on C1, and 2-methyl is a methyl on C2. So structure is Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, wait, no, but the double bond is between C1 and C2, which are both CH2 groups? No, wait, but wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would make it Cl attached to C1. So, the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Hmm, wait, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would make it Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, but the substituents are on the double bond carbons, right? So the structure would be CH2Cl and CH(CH3) connected by a double bond. So the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but that's three carbons. Oh, but but-1-ene is four carbons. So maybe it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2? Hmm, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe it's (Z)-configuration, but I'm not sure if this molecule has a chiral center. Let me think: does it have a carbon with four different groups attached? Looking at the structure, if the double bond is between C1 and C2, then C1 is Cl, CH2 on one side, and double bond to C2 which is CH(CH3) and another CH2. Wait, perhaps that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2, which has a methyl group. So C1 is Cl, two CH2 groups? Or maybe C1 is Cl, C2 is CH(CH3), and then C3 and C4 are CH2 and CH3. But in any case, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but that's a single bond. Wait, but it's but-1-ene, so double bond. So the correct structure is Cl-CH2-C double bond CH(CH3). Wait, perhaps it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. But then, how many substituents does each carbon in the double bond have? For C1 (CH2Cl), the substituents are Cl, two CH2, and the double bond. So that's two CH2 groups and Cl â€” wait, that's same on two sides, so no, that can't be. Or maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with double bond between C1 and C2. So, C1 is CH2Cl, double bond to C2, which has CH(CH3), and then C3 is CH2, C4 is CH3. Wait, but if the double bond is between C1 and C2, then C1 has CH2Cl and two CH2 groups? No, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's not a chiral center here. Let me think about the possible stereoisomerism. Wait, but if the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that doesn't make sense because but-1-ene is four carbons. So maybe the correct structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2, but that's three carbons, which doesn't fit but-1-ene. Hmm, perhaps I should move on and come back.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione.
Wow, that's a mouthful. Okay, so methanoisobenzofuran sounds like a fused ring. Hexahydro implies six-membered ring or something. The substituent is a chloromethylene group, which is Cl-CH2- attached as a substituent. The stereochemistry is specified as E, which is about the configuration around the double bond. Now, whether the molecule has a chiral center. Well, the E configuration might not imply a chiral center, but perhaps the molecule has some other stereogenic centers. The (3aR,7aS) indicates two stereogenic centers. Oh, right, so that's two chiral centers, so the compound is chiral and would exhibit optical activity. So this one counts as active.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.
Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So if both CH2 groups are substituted with methyl, then positions 2 and 3. So the structure would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Now, the configuration is (2R,3S). So each of those CH(CH3) groups are attached to the second and third carbons of the succinic acid. So each of these carbons has four different groups: (for C2: R is CH3, and the other groups are COOH, CH(CH3), and the adjacent CH2). Hmm, wait, let's see: the C2 would have groups: COOH (from the first carbon), CH(CH3) (from C3), a methyl (from the substituent), and the adjacent CH(CH3) (from C1, which is actually a CH2 in succinic). Wait, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, C2 would be connected to two CH(CH3) groups? Wait, no, each is substituted with a methyl. So for C2, the groups are: -CH3 (the substituent), -CH(CH3) (from C3), and two others. Wait, maybe each of the two central carbons (C2 and C3) have four different groups. Let me consider C2: attached to succinic acid chain, a methyl, and two other groups. Wait, the structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So, C2 is CH(CH3), connected to:

- The COOH group (from C1)
- The C3 (which is CH(CH3))
- A methyl group
- And another CH(CH3) from C3? No, wait, no, C2 is connected to C1 (which is CH2 in succinic acid except for the ends being COOH). Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. The 2,3-dimethyl would add a methyl to each CH2, making them CH(CH3). So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has four substituents. Let's look at C2: it's connected to:

- COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (C3)
- Two CH3 groups (the substituents)
Wait, no. That's not right. Because each CH(CH3) has CH3 and three other substituents. Wait, for C2, it's attached to:

- The C1 (which is a CH2 connected to COOH)
- The C3 (which is CH(CH3))
- Two methyl groups? No, each is CH(CH3), so each has one methyl. Wait, perhaps each has CH3, CH(CH3), and two other things. So for C2, the groups would be:

- CH2COOH (on one side)
- CH(CH3) (on the other side)
- Two CH3 groups? No, wait, no. Each C2 is CH(CH3), so each has one CH3, and the other three bonds are to the chain. So C2 is attached to:

- C1: which is CH2COOH
- C3: which is CH(CH3)
- Two CH3 groups? No, wait, no. Wait, no, each CH(CH3) has one CH3 and three CH2 groups? I'm getting stuck. Alternatively, perhaps each of these central carbons (C2 and C3) has four distinct substituents, making them chiral centers. So for C2: the substituents are:

- The COOH group from C1 (which is HOOC-CH2-)
Wait, no, wait. Let me write the structure again. Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. Now, 2,3-dimethyl would make it HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has:

- One methyl group (CH3)
- Two CH2 groups (but wait, no, because they're attached to each other). Wait, each is CH(CH3), so each has the following groups attached: one CH3, one CH(CH3) (from the adjacent carbon), and two CH2 groups? No, I'm not getting it. Wait, each of these carbons is bonded to:

- The two adjacent carbons in the chain (C1 and C3)
- A methyl group
- And another group, which would be H? No, wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because that would make C2 and C3 each have two CH3 groups and two CH2 groups, but that's not possible. Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken. Each CH(CH3) has one CH3 and three other substituents. So for C2, substituents are:

- COOH (from C1, which is actually a CH2 group, so C1 is CH2COOH)
Wait, no, wait. Let me number the carbons. The succinic acid is:

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH2
4: COOH

No, wait, wait, that's not right. Wait, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So positions are:

1: COOH
2: CH2
3: CH2
4: COOH

So 2,3-dimethyl would be CH(CH3) on C2 and C3. So structure is:

HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Now, each of those (C2 and C3) has:

For C2: groups attached are:

- C1: which is COOH (but wait, no, C1 is the first carbon, which is COOH. So C2 is attached to C1 (COOH-CH2), but wait, no. Wait, no, C2 is CH(CH3), connected to:

- C1: which is CH2 connected to COOH
- C3: which is CH(CH3)
- Two CH3 groups? No. Wait, each CH(CH3) has one CH3, and the other three bonds are to the adjacent carbons. So for C2, the substituents are:

- CH2COOH (from C1)
- CH(CH3) (from C3)
- Two CH3 groups? Or is that incorrect? Wait, no, each CH(CH3) has only one CH3. So the substituents are:

- The group from C1: which is CH2- (connected to COOH)
- The group from C3: which is CH(CH3)
- Two hydrogens?

Wait, no, each carbon has four bonds. So for C2:

- One bond to C1 (which is CH2-)
- One bond to C3 (which is CH(CH3))
- One bond to CH3 (the methyl group)
- The fourth bond is a hydrogen? No, wait, that can't be right because the molecule would have a hydrogen on C2. So the substituents are: CH2- (from C1), CH(CH3) (from C3), CH3, and H. Wait, but that would make four different groups: CH2COOH (wait, no, C1 is CH2, so perhaps it's just CH2 group), CH(CH3), CH3, and H. So yes, four different groups. Therefore, C2 is a chiral center. Similarly, C3 is a chiral center. So with (2R,3S) configuration, the molecule has two chiral centers and is chiral, so it's optically active. So this compound is active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid.
Same structure as the previous one, but with (2R,3R) configuration. Does this make it chiral? Well, even if both are R, they are still chiral centers. So the molecule is chiral; it has two stereogenic centers. So this one is also optically active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol.
Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol has a cyclohexene ring with an alcohol group on C1. So structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and the OH on C1. Now, whether this molecule is chiral. The ring is part of a chiral center? Let me think. The OH is on C1, which is connected to the other carbons. Let's see, the substituents on C1: the OH, two adjacent CH2 groups (assuming the ring is chair-like), and the ring itself. Wait, but wait, in a cyclohexene ring, the substituents around C1 might not all be different. Alternatively, perhaps the ring has a plane of symmetry. If the substituents on C1 are symmetric, then it won't be a chiral center. Hmm, but wait, the ring is cyclohexene, which is a ring with a double bond. So, in cyclohex-3-ene, the double bond is between C3 and C4, making the ring have a certain structure. The OH is on C1. Let me draw this in my mind: C1 has OH, connected to C2 and C6. C2 is connected to C3, which is double-bonded to C4. So for C1, the substituents are:

- OH group
- Two CH2 groups (C2 and C6)
- And the ring.

Wait, but if C2 and C6 are both CH2, then C1 would have two identical substituents, making it not a chiral center. So, in that case, the molecule isn't chiral. Or wait, maybe the ring substituents make the groups around C1 different. Wait, perhaps the groups attached to C1 are: OH, two different CH2 groups (since C2 is adjacent to a double bond and C6 is not), and another CH group (maybe? Or is that not the case). Alternatively, perhaps C1 is connected to three different groups and the ring itself, making it a chiral center. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the ring is such that C1 has mirror symmetry, then the molecule would not be chiral. Alternatively, without any other substituents, if the ring is symmetric, then C1 wouldn't be a chiral center. But wait, the cyclohexene ring with double bond at 3-ene might not have that symmetry. Let me think: if it's cyclohex-3-ene, the double bond is between C3 and C4. So the ring would have the structure where C2 and C5 are single bonds, and C3 and C4 are double-bonded. So, the substituents on C1 would be: OH, two CH2 groups (C2 and C6), and perhaps another CH group. Wait, but C2 is connected to the double bond, so perhaps C2 is a CH group. So, the substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- CH (from C2)
- CH2 (from C6)
- The ring itself. Wait, but the ring itself is a cyclohexene, which might not make the substituents on C1 all different. Hmm, maybe the molecule isn't chiral. Alternatively, maybe the configuration is such that the C1 has four different groups, making it chiral. If so, then (R) configuration would make it a chiral center. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about whether a cyclohexene ring with substituents can lead to a chiral center. For example, cyclohexanol itself isn't chiral because the OH is on a carbon connected to two CH2 groups, a CH2, and the ring. But in this case, the ring has a double bond, so the substituents might be different. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond affects the substituents around C1. Let me think again: the groups on C1 are:

- OH
- Two adjacent carbons: one is C2, which is CH (since it's a double bond with C3), and C6, which is CH2 (since it's a single bond). So C1 is connected to:

OH, CH (C2), CH2 (C6), and the ring. But wait, the ring is a cyclohexene ring, so perhaps the substituents on C1 are not all different. Alternatively, if the ring is symmetric, perhaps C1 is not a chiral center. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule can be divided into mirror images, then it's not chiral. Alternatively, perhaps this molecule isn't chiral because the substituents on C1 are not all different. So, if C1 has two identical substituents, it's not a chiral center. So, perhaps this compound doesn't exhibit optical activity. Or wait, maybe it does. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the (R) configuration implies that there's a chiral center, so the molecule is chiral. So I'm a bit confused about this one. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, another point: if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. So, does this molecule have a plane of symmetry? If the cyclohexene ring is symmetric with respect to the OH group, then maybe not. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is not chiral because the substituents on C1 are such that it doesn't have four distinct groups. So, maybe this compound isn't chiral. Hmm, I'll have to leave this for now and come back.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol.
So, this is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5, and all in the s configuration. Now, whether this molecule is chiral. So, each of these hydroxyl groups is on a carbon with other substituents. Let me think: cyclohexane is a six-membered ring. If three alternate positions (1,3,5) have hydroxyl groups, what's the structure? Each of those carbons would be connected to two other carbons in the ring, an OH group, and a hydrogen. Wait, but each of those carbons would have three substituents: two from the ring (like CH2 groups), the OH, and a hydrogen. So, would each of those hydroxyl-bearing carbons have four different substituents? Let's see: for C1, the substituents would be:

- Two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6)
- OH
- H.

Wait, so substituents: two CH2 groups, an OH, and a hydrogen. But the two CH2 groups are on adjacent carbons, but are they the same? If the ring is symmetric, maybe the substituents on C1 are not all different. Alternatively, if each of the three OHs is on a carbon that has four different groups, then each is a chiral center. But wait, in this case, each carbon (C1, C3, C5) is attached to:

- Two adjacent ring carbons (each CH2 groups)
- An OH
- A hydrogen.

So for each of these, are the two adjacent CH2 groups identical? Let's see: for C1, the substituents are:

- C2: which is a CH2 connected to C3 (which has an OH)
- C6: which is a CH2 connected to C5 (which has an OH)
- OH
- H.

So, are the CH2 groups on either side of C1 the same? No, because C2 is connected to C3 (which has an OH), and C6 is connected to C5 (another OH). But perhaps the groups are not identical because each CH2 is part of a different part of the ring. So, in that case, each of the three carbons (C1, C3, C5) would have four different substituents: two distinct CH2 groups, OH, and H. Therefore, each is a chiral center. So, with three chiral centers, the molecule is chiral, so it's optically active. Therefore, this compound counts.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one.
Structure: The butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(O)CH3. Wait, no: butan-1-one is (CH3)C(O)CH2CH2CH3? No, butan-1-one is (CH2CH2CH2CH3) with the ketone on C1. Wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(=O)-CH3. So, the structure is:

R-C(=O)-CH3, where R is (CH2)3.

But wait, in this compound, it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So, the structure is:

cyclopentyl group attached to C1 (the carbonyl carbon), and a methyl group on C3.

So, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

Wait, no, butan-1-one is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, wait, butan-1-one is:

   O
   ||
CH2-C-CH2-CH2-CH3.

Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(=O)-. No, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-C(=O)-, but butanone is usually butan-2-one. Wait, butan-1-one would have the ketone on the first carbon, but that's not possible because a ketone requires two R groups attached to the carbonyl. So, butan-1-one would be:

CH2CH2CH2CH2-C(=O)- something? Wait, perhaps it's O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. But that would be pentan-2-one, I think. Oh wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, butan-1-one would be:

CH3-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-R.

No, wait, but butan-1-one would be impossible because the carbonyl group must have two alkyl groups attached. So, butan-1-one would be O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-? No, that's impossible because it would be a terminal carbonyl group, which isn't possible in ketones. So perhaps the correct structure is:

Butan-1-one is CH3-C(=O)-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, that's pentan-2-one. Hmm, maybe the name is incorrect, but perhaps the actual structure is (cyclopentyl) attached to the carbonyl, and a methyl on the third carbon.

So, the structure is:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

Wait, but that would make it 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So the molecule is O=C-(CH2)-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

Now, does this have a chiral center? Let's look at the carbons. The carbonyl is on C1. Then, C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH2 attached to cyclopentyl. So the possible chiral centers are at C3. Let's check C3: what are the four groups attached? 

- The carbonyl group (from C2)
- A methyl group (from the CH(CH3))
- Two CH2 groups (from C3 to C4 and C3 to the cyclopentyl? Or wait, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the molecule as:

O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-cyclopentyl.

So the carbons are:

1: C=O connected to C2.
2: CH2 connected to C1 and C3.
3: CH(CH3) connected to C2 and C4.
4: CH2 connected to C3 and the cyclopentyl group.

So, C3 is CH(CH3). The groups attached to C3 are:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH(CH3)
- CH2 (from C4)
- And the cyclopentyl group? No, wait, C4 is CH2 connected to the cyclopentyl. So, the groups on C3 are:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH2 (from C4)
- CH3 (the substituent)
- And the cyclopentyl? No, the cyclopentyl is on C4. So, perhaps C3's substituents are:

- CH2 (C2)
- CH(CH3) (itself)
- CH2 (C4)
- And what else? Wait, no, each carbon has four bonds. So, for C3, the substituents are:

- C2: CH2
- C4: CH2
- CH3 (methyl)
- And another group? Oh, wait, perhaps the substituent is a hydrogen. No, that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the groups are:

- C2: CH2CO
- C4: CH2CH2
- CH3
- And a hydrogen. No, that wouldn't make sense. Hmm, perhaps C3 is CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH2), and the fourth substituent is a hydrogen. So, the substituents are:

- CH2 (from C2)
- CH2 (from C4)
- CH3 (the substituent)
- H.

So, four different groups? CH2, CH2 (but they're connected to different parts), CH3, and H. Are the two CH2 groups identical? No, because one is connected to C2 (which leads to the carbonyl), and the other is connected to C4 (which leads to the cyclopentyl). So, the substituents on C3 are four different groups: two distinct CH2 groups (since their surroundings are different), a CH3, and H. Therefore, C3 is a chiral center. So this molecule has a chiral center and would be optically active.

Wait, but wait, is the molecule symmetrical in any way? Because the cyclopentyl is a large group, but unless there's a plane of symmetry, the molecule might be chiral. So, yeah, I think this molecule is chiral and would exhibit optical activity.

Now, let's count how many are active.

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I should reevaluate. Let's think about the structure again. If the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2, but wait, that's three carbons, but but-1-ene is four. So perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2? No, but with a double bond. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2, but that's only three carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the double bond is between C2 and C3, not C1 and C2. Wait, but the name is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2. So the structure should be CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that doesn't include a double bond. Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is (Z)-configured around the double bond, but does that create any stereogenic centers? Wait, for a double bond to create a stereogenic center, the carbon must have four different groups. So, for the double bond, each carbon attached to the double bond must have four different groups. Let's think about C1 and C2.

If the structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2, that would be CH2Cl=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2. So, C1: CH2Cl, C2: CH. Wait, no, but double bonds have two substituents on each carbon. So, for C1: groups are Cl, two CH2 groups, and the double bond. So, that's two CH2 groups, which are same, so no, C1 can't be a chiral center. Similarly, C2 has CH(CH3), maybe. Wait, no, if the structure is CH2Cl=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2, then C2 is CH connected to CH(CH3), CH2, and the double bond. So, for C2: substituents are CH(CH3), CH2Cl (through the double bond), and two Hs? No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Maybe the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but with a double bond between C1 and C2, making it Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, C1: CH2Cl connected to the double bond, and C2: CH(CH3) connected to the double bond. So, the groups on C1 would be:

- Cl
- Two CH2 groups (from C1 and the other side of the double bond)
- And the double bond.

So, no, C1 won't have four different groups. Similarly, C2 would have:

- CH(CH3)
- Two CH2 groups (one from the double bond and one from the next carbon)
- And perhaps another group.

Wait, perhaps the molecule isn't chiral. So, perhaps this compound doesn't exhibit optical activity. So, maybe the answer is that it doesn't have optical activity.

To recap:

Compounds evaluated:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: Maybe not chiral.

2. The (3aR,7aS,E) compound: Yes, chiral.

3. (2R,3S) dimethylsuccinic acid: Yes.

4. (2R,3R) dimethylsuccinic acid: Yes.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Maybe not chiral (or is it? Not sure.)

6. (1s,3s,5s) cyclohexane triol: Yes.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: Yes.

Now, count the ones that are active.

2: active.

3: active.

4: active.

6: active.

7: active.

What about 5? If it's not chiral, then only 2,3,4,6,7 are active. So that's five. But wait, if 1 is not active, then it's 5. So the count would be 5. But the options are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

But wait, what about the first compound? If it's not chiral, then 5 active compounds.

Wait, but the first compound I'm not sure. Let me think again. Maybe the first compound is chiral. If the molecule is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2, but that's three carbons, which doesn't fit but-1-ene (which is four). Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene as CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2 with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the structure is CH2Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, it would be CH2Cl=CH-CH(CH3)-CH2. But that doesn't make sense because but-1-ene is four carbons. Alternatively, perhaps the structure doesn't allow any chiral centers. So, perhaps the first compound isn't active.

So, in that case, the active compounds are 2,3,4,6,7: five in total. So the answer would be A)5.

But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, the (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. The molecule is cyclohex-3-en-1-ol. The structure is a cyclohexene with the OH on C1. So, the substituents on C1 are:

- OH
- Two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6)
- And the ring.

Wait, but the ring is a six-membered ring. The substituents on C1 would be:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (since C2 and C6 are CH2 groups)
- And the ring.

Wait, but the ring itself is a part of the structure, so the substituents would be:

- OH
- CH2-C3 (which is part of the double bond)
- CH2-C6 (which is single bond)
- And the ring.

Hmm, but without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Wait, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the cyclohexene ring has a plane that makes the substituents on either side of C1 mirror images, then C1 wouldn't be a chiral center. Alternatively, if the substituents are all different, then it would be. So perhaps it's not chiral. So, if that's the case, then the first compound (number 5) isn't active, and the total active compounds are 2,3,4,6,7: five. But wait, the options have A as 5. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but I'm not confident about whether cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is chiral. Let me think again. If the hydroxyl is on a carbon that has four different substituents, then it's a chiral center. So, for C1 in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol:

Substituents:

- OH
- Two CH2 groups (but are they identical?)
- The ring.

In a cyclohexene ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, the substituents on C1 are:

- OH
- CH2 connected to C2 (which is connected to C3, which is double-bonded)
- CH2 connected to C6 (which is connected to C5, which is single bonded)
- And the ring (which is symmetric in some way? Or not.)

If the substituents on either side of C1 are different, then it would be a chiral center. For example, if the groups on either side of C1 are not mirror images, then the carbon is chiral. So, perhaps the molecule is chiral. So, number 5 would be active. But earlier, I thought maybe it's not.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me summarize:

Active compounds:
2: yes
3: yes
4: yes
5: unsure
6: yes
7: yes

So, that's five if 5 is active, or four if not.

Wait, let me reevaluate. If the (R) configuration is given, that suggests that the molecule is chiral, so it must have a chiral center. So, if it's (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, then the OH is on a chiral center. So, in that case, it's active. So, that would make the fifth active compound. So the total is five.

But wait, the options don't have five as the first option. Wait, the options are: A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

So, if all except the first are active, and the first isn't, then the count would be five.

Wait, but earlier I thought the first compound isn't active, but if the others are, then answer is A)5.

Wait, but in the first compound, (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, if the structure is such that C1 has two identical substituents, it won't be a chiral center. So, for example, if C1 is Cl, and attached to two CH2 groups, and the double bond, then it can't be a chiral center. So, the first compound isn't active.

So, the active compounds are 2,3,4,6,7: five in total.

Thus, the correct answer is A)5.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality, which is the presence of a chiral center or another form of asymmetry that allows the molecule to have non-superimposable mirror images.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   The structure of this compound is CHâ‚‚Cl=CH-CH(CHâ‚ƒ)-CHâ‚ƒ. The double bond is between C1 and C2, and the substituents on these carbons are analyzed for chirality. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different groups. C1 has Cl, two CHâ‚‚ groups, and the double bond, which are not all distinct. Similarly, C2 has CH, CH(CHâ‚ƒ), CHâ‚ƒ, and the double bond, but the substituents are not all unique. Therefore, this compound is **not chiral** and does not exhibit optical activity.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This compound contains a fused ring system with two stereogenic centers at positions 3a and 7a, as indicated by the (3aR,7aS) notation. The presence of these stereogenic centers makes the molecule chiral, and it exhibits optical activity.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Succinic acid has the structure HOOC-CHâ‚‚-CHâ‚‚-COOH. Substituting methyl groups on C2 and C3 results in HOOC-CH(CHâ‚ƒ)-CH(CHâ‚ƒ)-COOH. Each of the central carbons (C2 and C3) has four different substituents: a methyl group, two different carbons from the succinic acid chain, and a hydrogen. These carbons are chiral centers, and the molecule is chiral. It exhibits optical activity.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   This compound is structurally identical to the previous one, with the same substituents on C2 and C3. The (2R,3R) configuration confirms the presence of two chiral centers, making the molecule chiral and capable of exhibiting optical activity.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   This compound is a cyclohexene ring with an -OH group on C1. For C1 to be a chiral center, it must have four different substituents. The substituents are: -OH, two distinct CHâ‚‚ groups (one adjacent to the double bond and one not), and the ring. These substituents are all different, making C1 a chiral center. The molecule is chiral and exhibits optical activity.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. Each of these carbons has four different substituents: an -OH group, two distinct CHâ‚‚ groups, and a hydrogen. All three hydroxyl-bearing carbons are chiral centers, making the molecule chiral and capable of exhibiting optical activity.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   This compound has the structure O=C-CHâ‚‚-CH(CHâ‚ƒ)-CHâ‚‚-cyclopentyl. The carbon at C3 (CH(CHâ‚ƒ)) has four different substituents: a methyl group, two distinct CHâ‚‚ groups (one adjacent to the carbonyl and one adjacent to the cyclopentyl group), and a hydrogen. This makes C3 a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical activity.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are numbers **2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7**. However, based on the analysis, the correct count of optically active compounds is **5**.
