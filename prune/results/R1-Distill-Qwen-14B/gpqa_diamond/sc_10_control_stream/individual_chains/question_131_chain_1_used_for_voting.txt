Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

Let me read the question again. So, we're dealing with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is given: the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products—a major and a minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3.

The key part is about the NOESY spectra. The major product has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. The question is which two resonances are connected by that cross-peak in the major product.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. I think I'll start by figuring out what the starting materials look like.

First, the dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration forms an anhydride. Anhydrides can form from two carboxylic acid groups losing water. Since the starting material has a cis-alkene, the anhydride must have a structure that reflects that.

The anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That region is usually aromatic protons, but wait, anhydrides don't have aromatic rings. Oh, wait, maybe it's a conjugated diene or some kind of conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol ether or something else. Wait, but 7 ppm is more like a vinyl proton or maybe an aldehyde. Wait, aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm, so maybe it's some sort of conjugated double bond.

Wait, the 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Carbon chemical shifts can help. 137 ppm is around where a carbonyl adjacent carbon might be, perhaps a carbon next to a carbonyl group or part of a conjugated system. 165 ppm is definitely a carbonyl carbon, maybe a ketone or ester or anhydride carbonyl.

Wait, the starting material is an anhydride. So, the 165 ppm is probably the carbonyl carbons of the anhydride. Anhydrides typically have two carbonyl carbons, each about 165-175 ppm. So perhaps the 137 ppm is another carbon, maybe a bridging carbon or a carbon from the original alkene.

Wait, the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. Maybe it's a methyl group adjacent to something deshielded. Or perhaps it's the protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl, like in an alpha position.

Wait, but the dicarboxylic acid had a cis-alkene. When it dehydrates to form an anhydride, the structure would have a ring, perhaps. For example, if the acid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a cis double bond, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, that wouldn't have a double bond. Wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond, making it HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-COOH, but that's a trans or cis diene. Wait, but in the cis case, the groups on either side of the double bond are on the same side.

Wait, when this dicarboxylic acid dehydrates, it forms an anhydride. So maybe it's a cyclic anhydride. For example, if the two carboxylic acid groups are on adjacent carbons, like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond, perhaps HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. Wait, that's a possibility. Then dehydration would form an anhydride ring.

Wait, but if it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, that's succinic acid. Dehydration would form succinic anhydride, but without any double bonds. But wait, the starting material has a cis-alkene, so maybe it's a diacid with a double bond, like HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond between the second and third carbons. Wait, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂-COOH? No, that's longer. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH where the middle part is a double bond, like HOOC-CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂-COOH. Wait, but that might not form a five-membered ring on dehydration.

Wait, maybe the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂-COOH. Dehydration would lose two water molecules, forming an anhydride. But wait, if the diacid is HOOC-CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂-COOH, then the double bond is in the middle. On dehydration, perhaps the two carboxylic acid groups would lose water and form an anhydride bridge between the two ends.

Wait, perhaps the structure after dehydration is a cyclic anhydride, where the ring is between the two carbonyl groups. The original structure would have the two COOH groups on adjacent carbons with a double bond, or perhaps a chain that allows for ring formation upon dehydration.

Alternatively, maybe it's a maleic acid derivative. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When dehydrated, it forms maleic anhydride, which is a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups. But wait, in that case, the 1H NMR would have protons on the double bond. So, in maleic anhydride, the protons are in a cis configuration. But maleic anhydride has two equivalent protons in a five-membered ring, leading to a singlet. Wait, but in the problem, the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That might fit. Because in maleic anhydride, the protons on the double bond are deshielded and appear around 6-7 ppm as a singlet because they're equivalent.

Wait, but the 13C NMR shows two peaks: 137 and 165 ppm. For maleic anhydride, the carbons attached to the oxygen (the carbonyl carbons) would be around 165 ppm. The double bond carbons are around 130-140 ppm. So the two carbons of the double bond would each be around 137 ppm, but wait, maleic anhydride has two double bond carbons, so each would be about 137? Or perhaps one is higher. Alternatively, perhaps in the structure, there's another carbon causing a shift. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the anhydride has a structure where the double bond is part of the ring, and the other carbons are CH2 groups. But I'm getting stuck; perhaps I should move to the next part.

The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. That's a diene, right? So, it's a cyclopentadiene with four methyl groups. Let me draw it. 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene. With methyl groups on carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4, that would make it a very substituted diene. So, perhaps the structure is a cyclopentane ring with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, and methyl groups on each of those carbons.

Wait, no. 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making it a conjugated diene. With four methyl groups on positions 1,2,3,4. So each of those carbons would have a methyl group attached.

When the anhydride reacts with this diene, it's probably undergoing a Diels-Alder reaction. Because anhydrides can act as dienophiles in such reactions.

In a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene (the conjugated diene) reacts with a dienophile (the anhydride, which has a double bond) to form a six-membered cyclohexene derivative. The reaction is [4+2] cycloaddition.

So, the dienophile is the anhydride, which has a double bond. The diene is the cyclopentadiene.

Wait, but the dienophile in Diels-Alder is typically something like a carbonyl with a double bond, such as maleic anhydride. So, the structure of the anhydride is likely a good dienophile.

So, the product of the Diels-Alder would be a bicyclic structure, perhaps? Because the diene is a cyclopentadiene, so the product would be a bicyclic or bridged ring structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Diels-Alder product is a six-membered ring with substituents.

But let me think about the structure of the dienophile. The anhydride is probably a cyclic five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups. So, maleic anhydride is a good example. When it reacts with a diene, it forms a six-membered ring with two ester groups attached.

Wait, but in the problem, the anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR at 7 ppm. If it's maleic anhydride, the protons on the double bond are a pair of equivalent protons, so they give a single peak as a singlet.

So, let's proceed under the assumption that the dienophile is maleic anhydride or similar.

The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So, it's a substituted diene. When it reacts with the dienophile, the endo rule may dictate the major product. But in the problem, two products are formed, major and minor, so perhaps the reaction can proceed via different pathways, perhaps differing in the stereochemistry or regiochemistry.

Wait, but the product has the molecular formula C13H16O3. Let me check the molecular formulas. The dienophile is an anhydride, which, from the dicarboxylic acid, would lose two water molecules. Let's say the acid is HOOC-(CH2)n-COOH, but with a double bond. So, the anhydride would have the formula (CH2)n(CO)2O, but I need to check.

Alternatively, let's compute the molecular formula. The anhydride is formed from a dicarboxylic acid. Suppose the acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH. Dehydration would lose two H2O molecules, so the formula would be (HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH) → (CH2CH2CH2(CO)2O) with loss of 2 H2O. So the formula would be C5H8O3 (for the acid, C5H10O4; minus 2 H2O (H4O2) gives C5H8O3). Wait, no. Let me compute:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH → molecular formula is C5H8O4. Dehydration to form an anhydride would lose two H2O, so the anhydride would be C5H6O3.

Wait, but wait: when a diacid dehydrates to form an anhydride, each loss of H2O removes one H from each COOH group. So for each COOH group, you lose one H2O, so for two, you lose two H2O. So the formula of the anhydride would be (CnH2mO4) → (CnH2m-4O2). So, for a diacid of formula CnH2mO4, the anhydride would be CnH2m-4O2.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me compute for maleic acid: HOOC-CH=CH-COOH is C4H4O4. Dehydration gives maleic anhydride, which is C4H2O3. Because you lose two H2O (from two COOH groups), so 4 H and 2 O lost. So, 4 H from H4O4 becomes H2O3.

So, the dienophile has formula C4H2O3.

The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Let's compute its formula. Cyclopentadiene is C5H6. Adding four methyl groups (each CH3) would add 4*(CH3) → 4C and 12H. So the formula becomes C5 +4C = C9? Wait, wait. Wait, the base is cyclopentadiene, which is a five-membered ring with two double bonds? No, wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene, so structure is cyclopentane with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. Each double bond is a CH2 group. So, the base structure is C5H6 (since a cyclopentene would be C5H8, but with two double bonds, it's C5H6).

Wait, but if it's 1,3-cyclopentadiene, the structure is a five-membered ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4. Each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group. So, each CH2 becomes CH(CH3). Wait, no, because each position is a CH with a methyl group attached. Let me count: the five-membered ring has five carbons. Positions 1,2,3,4 each have a methyl group. So, each of those is CH2 in the ring, but with a methyl substitution? Hmm, perhaps each of those four positions is CH(CH3), making the formula:

Each ring carbon is CH2, but four of them have a CH3 substituent. So, for each ring carbon:

- Positions 1,2,3,4: each has a CH3 group attached. So, each of those is a CH2 group in the ring, but with a CH3 substituent, so each is CH(CH3) in the ring. So, each has 2 substituents: the ring (as CH2) and a methyl.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the molecular formula.

Each ring carbon is CH2. Four of them have a methyl group, so each adds a CH3. So, the diene is C5H6 plus four CH3 groups, which is 4*(CH3) → 4 C and 12 H. So total formula is C5 +4C = C9, H6 + 12 H = H18? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure is a 1,3-cyclopentadiene (five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4). Each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group. So, the structure is:

- Carbon 1: CH(CH3)
- Carbon 2: CH(CH3)
- Carbon 3: CH(CH3)
- Carbon 4: CH(CH3)
- Carbon 5: CH2 (if any substituent, but in this case, it's just CH2).

Wait, no, because the ring is five-membered, each carbon is bonded to two others. So, if carbons 1 and 2 are double-bonded, and 3 and 4 are double-bonded, then the structure is:

1 (double bond to 2) → CH(CH3)
2 (double bond to 1 and single bond to 3) → CH(CH3)
3 (single bond to 2, double bond to 4) → CH(CH3)
4 (double bond to 3 and single bond to 5) → CH(CH3)
5 → CH2 (since it's a five-membered ring, connected to 4 and 1?)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think of each ring carbon. The ring is cyclopentene with two double bonds, but wait, cyclopentadiene can't have two double bonds in a five-membered ring. Oh wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene isn't possible because that would require two non-conjugated double bonds. Wait, no, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene. So, the structure is a five-membered ring with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making it a conjugated diene.

Each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group attached. So, the formula would be C5 (ring) + 4*CH3. So, that's 5 +4 =9 carbons. Hydrogen: each ring CH has two H (since in a ring, each carbon is bonded to two adjacent carbons and two substituents). Wait, no.

Wait, the ring structure for 1,3-cyclopentadiene is:

1-2 double bond, 3-4 double bond. So, the structure is like:

1: CH2
2: CH
3: CH2
4: CH
5: CH2

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each double bond is between 1-2 and 3-4, making the ring have two double bonds, which would make it a cumulene, but that's not possible in a five-membered ring. Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should just calculate the formula.

Each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group attached. So, each of those four carbons has a CH(CH3), perhaps. So, each methyl adds a CH3, bringing 4*(CH3) = 4 C and 12 H.

The cyclopentadiene part is C5H6. So, adding the four methyl groups, the formula becomes C5 +4 = C9, and H6 + 12 = H18? Wait, that can't be right because the ring is conjugated, which might have fewer hydrogens. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of it as the diene is C9H14? Or maybe I should compute it more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula of the diene is C9H12. Because the base diene, 1,3-cyclopentadiene, is C5H6. Adding four methyl groups (each CH3) increases the C by 4 and H by 12 (since each CH3 adds 3 H). So, 5 +4 =9 C, 6 +12=18 H. Wait, that would make it C9H18. But wait, that seems high for a diene.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which is C5H6. Then adding four methyl groups (each CH3) would give C5 +4 = 9 C. Hydrogens: each CH3 adds 3 H. So, 6 (from C5H6) + 4*3 = 6+12=18 H. So, the diene is C9H18.

Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me think again. The structure of 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, but that's not possible. Wait, no, 1,3-cyclopentadiene isn't a real compound because that would imply two double bonds in a five-membered ring, which isn't possible. Oh wait, perhaps it's a typo and it's 1,3-cyclopentadiene as in the ring positions, but maybe it's a monoene. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me move on.

The reaction between the anhydride (C4H2O3) and the diene (C9H18) would form a product. The product's formula is C13H16O3. Let's check the formula:

C4 (anhydride) + C9 (dien) → C13, which matches.

Hydrogen: 2 (anhydride) +18 (dien) → 20, but the product has 16 H. So, 20-4=16. That suggests four H are lost, perhaps as two H2 molecules, implying two double bonds are formed. Which makes sense in a Diels-Alder reaction, which forms a six-membered ring with a double bond.

So, the Diels-Alder product would be a bicyclic structure. The reaction forms two new sigma bonds, and the diene and dienophile each contribute four and two pi electrons, respectively, leading to a six-membered ring with substituents.

Now, the problem states that the reaction yields two products, major and minor. So, perhaps the reaction has some stereochemistry involved, leading to two possible diastereomers or enantiomers.

The next part is about the NOESY spectra. The major product has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. NOESY detects through-space interactions between protons, so a cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space, even if they're not coupled.

In the major product, there's a cross-peak between two specific protons, which are the ones we're supposed to identify.

Looking at the options, the possible pairs are:

A) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm
B) 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm
C) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm
D) 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm

Hmm. So the question is which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak in the major product.

In the major product, which is likely the endo product of the Diels-Alder reaction, we would expect specific spatial arrangements of the substituents.

In the Diels-Alder product, the endo rule suggests that the substituents are on the same face, leading to a particular conformation where some protons are close in space.

So, in the product, the substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride) would be in a specific orientation relative to the substituents from the diene.

The diene is highly substituted with methyl groups. So, the product would have several methyl groups in specific positions.

Looking at the options, the cross-peak involves two groups of protons. For example, in option C, two singlets at ~1 ppm and ~1.7 ppm. These might be two sets of equivalent methyl groups that are close in space.

Alternatively, option B is a 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at 3.5. Singlets at 3.5 ppm might be from OCH2 or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in the Diels-Alder adduct, the substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride) would be at the ends of the six-membered ring. The dienophile's substituents would be in a trans configuration relative to each other in the bicyclic structure.

So, considering the product's structure, perhaps there are methyl groups from the diene that are positioned adjacent to the substituents from the anhydride.

Wait, perhaps the substituents in the product are such that two methyl groups are in proximity, leading to a NOE effect when they are close.

In the major product, the endo transition state would have the substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride's groups) positioned on the same face as the diene's substituents (the methyl groups). This would bring certain protons into close proximity.

So, in the structure, perhaps a pair of methyl groups (like from the diene) are on the same face, near the oxygen atoms from the anhydride.

Wait, but how does that translate into the NMR signals?

Suppose that the product has two sets of methyl groups that are near each other. For example, two methyl groups attached to adjacent carbons in the ring, which are close in space, leading to a NOE effect.

Looking at the options, option C says a 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. That would imply two separate sets of methyl groups, each as singlets, and in proximity.

Alternatively, option A has a 6H singlet and a 1H doublet. Perhaps a methyl group and a methylene group.

But the problem states that the cross-peak is present in the major product, implying that the structure has protons that are close in space, which would be more likely in a more compact structure, maybe from the endo transition state.

Wait, in the major product, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that certain methyl groups are on the same face, leading to a NOE interaction.

Another angle: the cross-peak in the NOESY suggests that the two protons are close in space. So, perhaps in the major product, there is an axial-equatorial arrangement where two protons are close, but in the minor product, they are trans and further apart.

Alternatively, perhaps in the major product, the two substituents are on the same side, leading their protons to be close, whereas in the minor product, they're opposite, so the protons are not close.

Now, looking at the options, for example, option C has two singlets of 6H each. Singlets suggest that all the protons are equivalent, perhaps in a symmetric environment. For instance, two methyl groups that are equivalent and situated symmetrically, but on opposite sides of the ring.

But for a cross-peak to occur, the protons must be close, so perhaps the two sets are close in space. So, in the structure, perhaps one set is on one face, and another is on the same face elsewhere, leading to proximity.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H singlet at 1 ppm is from two methyl groups attached to adjacent carbons, and the 6H at 1.7 is from another pair of methyl groups that are near them.

Alternatively, let's think about the structure of the product. The Diels-Alder product would have a bicyclic structure, perhaps with substituents from both the diene and the dienophile.

The dienophile (anhydride) brings in two ester groups or similar. The diene brings in four methyl groups.

In the product, perhaps the substituents are in positions that lead to specific proximity of certain groups.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclo structure where the substituents are in positions that cause some methyl groups to be close to each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has two methyl groups that are adjacent and on the same face, leading to a cross-peak.

Let me think about the NMR shifts. A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm is likely a set of equivalent methyl groups attached to something deshielded, perhaps adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like an oxygen. But wait, 1 ppm is more like a methyl group in an ethyl position, perhaps.

Alternatively, 1.7 ppm is more in line with a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, perhaps, as those are typically around 2-3 ppm. Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, in a ring structure, the substituents might cause the shift to be lower.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck on the exact shifts. Maybe I should consider the options again.

Option C: two singlets. Each 6H, at 1 and 1.7 ppm. That suggests two sets of equivalent methyl groups. Perhaps in the major product, these two sets are on the same face, leading to a cross-peak.

Alternatively, option B: 6H singlet at 1.7 and 2H singlet at 3.5. The 2H at 3.5 could be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps an OCH2 group. But in the product, there's an anhydride-derived group. So, perhaps the O is part of an ester or lactone.

But considering the product's formula, C13H16O3, it's a combination of the anhydride (C4H2O3) and diene (C9H18). Wait, no, the diene is C9H18, but the product is C13H16O3. So, the diene must lose some H to form the product. Wait, adding C4 + C9 = C13, and H2 + H18 = H20, but the product has H16, so 4 H are lost, likely as two double bonds (each double bond removes two H). So the product has two double bonds, perhaps.

So, the product is a bicyclic compound with two rings and two double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene structure. Because Diels-Alder adds a six-membered ring, but with the diene being part of a ring, it might form a bridged bicyclic structure.

In such a structure, substituents from the dienophile would be at the bridgehead positions. The diene's substituents (the methyl groups) would be on adjacent carbons.

So, in the major product, the substituents (methyl groups) from the diene would be in an endo position, leading to certain spatial arrangements.

In the NOESY spectrum, the cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space. In the major product, perhaps two methyl groups are on the same face, leading their protons to interact.

Looking at the options, option C has two singlets, 6H each, which suggests two sets of equivalent methyl groups. If these are on the same face, their protons would be close, leading to a cross-peak.

Option A has a 6H singlet and a 1H doublet. That could be, perhaps, a methyl group and an adjacent proton, but I'm not sure.

Option D has a 1H doublet and 2H singlet. The 2H singlet could be a methylene group, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen.

But considering the cross-peak in the NOESY, the two resonances connected are likely to be two sets of protons that are spatially close. So, if it's a 6H singlet and another 6H singlet, perhaps the two methyl groups are adjacent and on the same face, causing their protons to be close.

Wait, but 6H each—so two methyl groups (3H each) would sum to 6H. Alternatively, two sets of three methyl groups each? No, that's not possible. Or perhaps it's a single set of six equivalent protons, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the 6H singlet is from two equivalent methyl groups. So, each group has 3H, totaling 6H. Similarly for the other singlet.

So, in the major product, perhaps there are two methyl groups that are equivalent and close to another two methyl groups, which are also equivalent. Their proximity would lead to a cross-peak in the NOESY.

Option C says that the cross-peak connects a 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. So, that would mean two sets of equivalent methyl groups, each 6H. But that's impossible because 6H would require two methyl groups each (3H each) for each set.

But wait, maybe it's a single methyl group (3H) and another group. No, the options don't seem to align perfectly.

Alternatively, the cross-peak might involve a methyl group and another proton. For example, a methyl group's protons could be close to another proton, like a methine proton.

Wait, looking at option D: a 1H doublet and a 2H singlet. The 1H could be a proton adjacent to the methyl groups, perhaps, and the 2H a methylene group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-peak is between a methyl group and a neighboring proton that's on a different carbon but close in space.

Wait, maybe the structure has a bridge, and a methyl group is attached near a bridgehead, making the protons on the methyl group close to a bridgehead proton.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the Diels-Alder transition state. The endo rule suggests that substituents on the dienophile are on the same face as the diene's substituents. So, the methyl groups from the diene would be positioned near the substituents from the anhydride in the product.

In the product, the substituents from the anhydride (the oxygen-containing groups) would be positioned in such a way that the methyl groups from the diene are close to each other.

In the major product, perhaps two methyl groups from the diene are on the same face, leading their protons to interact via NOE. So, their NMR signals would show a cross-peak.

If the product has, for example, two methyl groups on adjacent carbons in a ring, and those two methyl groups are on the same face (endo), their protons would be close, leading to a cross-peak in the NOESY.

Now, looking at the options, which pair of resonances would correspond to two methyl groups that are close?

Option C has two singlets, each 6H. That would require two sets of two methyl groups, which might be arranged symmetrically. For example, two methyl groups on adjacent carbons and another two on the opposite side but also adjacent. But that might not be the case.

Alternatively, option B has a 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at 3.5. The 2H at 3.5 could be a methylene group attached to an oxygen. The 6H singlet might be from two methyl groups attached to adjacent carbons.

If those two methyl groups are on the same face, their protons would be close, leading to a cross-peak. But option B's 6H is a singlet, and the 2H is a singlet. So, perhaps the 6H is from two methyl groups, and the 2H is from a methylene group elsewhere.

Alternatively, the cross-peak could be between a methyl group and a methylene group if their protons are close.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another approach is to think about which options are less likely. For example, option A has a 6H singlet and a 1H doublet. That would imply a methyl group and a methine proton. But why would those be close? Perhaps if the methyl is attached to a carbon adjacent to a proton that's part of a bridge.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, option D has a 1H doublet and a 2H singlet. Maybe a methyl group and a methylene group are adjacent. But again, not sure.

Wait, the question is about which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak in the major product. The cross-peak is present in the major product but not in the minor. So, the spatial arrangement in the major product brings those two sets of protons close.

In the major product, perhaps the substituents (like the methyl groups) are on the same face, leading to proximity. So, the two sets of methyl groups are on the same face, making their protons close enough for a NOE effect.

If the product has two methyl groups adjacent on one face and another two on the same face, their protons would be close, leading to a cross-peak.

But looking at the options, the only option that connects two singlets is option C. So, each 6H is a set of methyl groups, perhaps.

Wait, but wait. If the product has a bridged bicyclic structure, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that two methyl groups are on one bridge and another two on another bridge, but on the same face. So, their protons are close.

In that case, the cross-peak would be between the methyl groups on the same face.

So, for option C, a 6H singlet at 1 ppm and another 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm. That would mean two sets of two methyl groups each, each set being equivalent and close to each other.

Alternatively, perhaps each 6H is from a single methyl group split into multiple peaks, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the 6H singlet is from two equivalent methyl groups, each contributing 3H. So, two methyl groups, 6H total.

Similarly, another 6H singlet would be two more methyl groups. So, four methyl groups in total, which matches the diene's four methyl groups.

So, in the major product, two of the methyl groups are close to the other two, leading to a cross-peak between the two sets.

Thus, the correct option would be C: a 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.

But wait, why would they be at different ppm? Maybe because their environments are different. For example, one set is near an electron-withdrawing group, shifting their ppm higher.

Alternatively, perhaps one set is more shielded, appearing at 1 ppm, and the other is less shielded, appearing at 1.7 ppm.

In any case, based on the reasoning, the cross-peak connects two sets of methyl groups that are close in space. The only option that connects two singlets is option C.

The problem involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that dehydrates to form an anhydride. The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene via a Diels-Alder reaction, yielding two products: a major and a minor product. Both products have the molecular formula C13H16O3. The major product exhibits a cross-peak in its 2D NOESY NMR spectrum, while the minor product does not. The task is to determine which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Anhydride**:  
   The anhydride is likely a cyclic structure, such as maleic anhydride, which has two carbonyl carbons (165 ppm in 13C NMR) and a single peak at 7 ppm in 1H NMR, corresponding to equivalent protons on the double bond.

2. **Diels-Alder Reaction**:  
   The reaction between the anhydride (dienophile) and the tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (diene) forms a bicyclic product. The major product likely follows the endo rule, where substituents are positioned on the same face of the bicyclic structure, leading to spatial proximity of certain protons.

3. **NOESY Cross-Peak**:  
   The cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product indicates through-space interaction between two protons that are close in space. This is consistent with the spatial arrangement of substituents in the endo product, where methyl groups from the diene are positioned near each other.

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. This suggests a methyl group and a methine proton, but there is no clear spatial or chemical reason for these protons to interact in the major product.  
   - **Option B**: A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could correspond to a methylene group near an oxygen, but this does not align with the expected spatial arrangement of methyl groups in the major product.  
   - **Option C**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. This corresponds to two sets of equivalent methyl groups, likely positioned on the same face of the bicyclic structure in the major product, leading to a cross-peak due to their proximity.  
   - **Option D**: A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This suggests a methine proton and a methylene group, but there is no clear evidence for such a spatial interaction in the major product.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The most plausible explanation is that the cross-peak in the major product connects two sets of equivalent methyl groups, each contributing to a singlet in the 1H NMR spectrum. These methyl groups are spatially close due to the endo arrangement in the bicyclic structure.

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But I'll try to work through it step by step.

Let me read the question again. So, we're dealing with a dicarboxylic acid that has a cis-alkene. When it's dehydrated, it forms an anhydride. The anhydride's NMR data is given: the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm, and the 13C NMR shows two peaks at 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Then, this anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene to give two products—a major and a minor. Both have the formula C13H16O3.

The key part is about the NOESY spectra. The major product has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. The question is which two resonances are connected by that cross-peak in the major product.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. I think I'll start by figuring out what the starting materials look like.

First, the dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene. Dehydration forms an anhydride. Anhydrides can form from two carboxylic acid groups losing water. Since the starting material has a cis-alkene, the anhydride must have a structure that reflects that.

The anhydride's 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That region is usually aromatic protons, but wait, anhydrides don't have aromatic rings. Oh, wait, maybe it's a conjugated diene or some kind of conjugated system. Alternatively, maybe it's an enol ether or something else. Wait, but 7 ppm is more like a vinyl proton or maybe an aldehyde. Wait, aldehydes are around 9-10 ppm, so maybe it's some sort of conjugated double bond.

Wait, the 13C NMR has two peaks: 137 ppm and 165 ppm. Carbon chemical shifts can help. 137 ppm is around where a carbonyl adjacent carbon might be, perhaps a carbon next to a carbonyl group or part of a conjugated system. 165 ppm is definitely a carbonyl carbon, maybe a ketone or ester or anhydride carbonyl.

Wait, the starting material is an anhydride. So, the 165 ppm is probably the carbonyl carbons of the anhydride. Anhydrides typically have two carbonyl carbons, each about 165-175 ppm. So perhaps the 137 ppm is another carbon, maybe a bridging carbon or a carbon from the original alkene.

Wait, the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. Maybe it's a methyl group adjacent to something deshielded. Or perhaps it's the protons on the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl, like in an alpha position.

Wait, but the dicarboxylic acid had a cis-alkene. When it dehydrates to form an anhydride, the structure would have a ring, perhaps. For example, if the acid is something like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a cis double bond, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, that wouldn't have a double bond. Wait, maybe it's HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH but with a double bond, making it HOOC-CH2-CH=CH-CH2-COOH, but that's a trans or cis diene. Wait, but in the cis case, the groups on either side of the double bond are on the same side.

Wait, when this dicarboxylic acid dehydrates, it forms an anhydride. So maybe it's a cyclic anhydride. For example, if the two carboxylic acid groups are on adjacent carbons, like HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but with a double bond, perhaps HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. Wait, that's a possibility. Then dehydration would form an anhydride ring.

Wait, but if it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH, that's succinic acid. Dehydration would form succinic anhydride, but without any double bonds. But wait, the starting material has a cis-alkene, so maybe it's a diacid with a double bond, like HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-CH₂-COOH with a double bond between the second and third carbons. Wait, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂-COOH? No, that's longer. Alternatively, perhaps it's something like HOOC-CH₂-CH₂-COOH where the middle part is a double bond, like HOOC-CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂-COOH. Wait, but that might not form a five-membered ring on dehydration.

Wait, maybe the structure is HOOC-CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂-COOH. Dehydration would lose two water molecules, forming an anhydride. But wait, if the diacid is HOOC-CH₂-CH=CH-CH₂-COOH, then the double bond is in the middle. On dehydration, perhaps the two carboxylic acid groups would lose water and form an anhydride bridge between the two ends.

Wait, perhaps the structure after dehydration is a cyclic anhydride, where the ring is between the two carbonyl groups. The original structure would have the two COOH groups on adjacent carbons with a double bond, or perhaps a chain that allows for ring formation upon dehydration.

Alternatively, maybe it's a maleic acid derivative. Maleic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. When dehydrated, it forms maleic anhydride, which is a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups. But wait, in that case, the 1H NMR would have protons on the double bond. So, in maleic anhydride, the protons are in a cis configuration. But maleic anhydride has two equivalent protons in a five-membered ring, leading to a singlet. Wait, but in the problem, the 1H NMR has a single peak at 7 ppm. That might fit. Because in maleic anhydride, the protons on the double bond are deshielded and appear around 6-7 ppm as a singlet because they're equivalent.

Wait, but the 13C NMR shows two peaks: 137 and 165 ppm. For maleic anhydride, the carbons attached to the oxygen (the carbonyl carbons) would be around 165 ppm. The double bond carbons are around 130-140 ppm. So the two carbons of the double bond would each be around 137 ppm, but wait, maleic anhydride has two double bond carbons, so each would be about 137? Or perhaps one is higher. Alternatively, perhaps in the structure, there's another carbon causing a shift. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the anhydride has a structure where the double bond is part of the ring, and the other carbons are CH2 groups. But I'm getting stuck; perhaps I should move to the next part.

The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. That's a diene, right? So, it's a cyclopentadiene with four methyl groups. Let me draw it. 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene. With methyl groups on carbons 1, 2, 3, and 4, that would make it a very substituted diene. So, perhaps the structure is a cyclopentane ring with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, and methyl groups on each of those carbons.

Wait, no. 1,3-cyclopentadiene would have double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making it a conjugated diene. With four methyl groups on positions 1,2,3,4. So each of those carbons would have a methyl group attached.

When the anhydride reacts with this diene, it's probably undergoing a Diels-Alder reaction. Because anhydrides can act as dienophiles in such reactions.

In a Diels-Alder reaction, the diene (the conjugated diene) reacts with a dienophile (the anhydride, which has a double bond) to form a six-membered cyclohexene derivative. The reaction is [4+2] cycloaddition.

So, the dienophile is the anhydride, which has a double bond. The diene is the cyclopentadiene.

Wait, but the dienophile in Diels-Alder is typically something like a carbonyl with a double bond, such as maleic anhydride. So, the structure of the anhydride is likely a good dienophile.

So, the product of the Diels-Alder would be a bicyclic structure, perhaps? Because the diene is a cyclopentadiene, so the product would be a bicyclic or bridged ring structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Diels-Alder product is a six-membered ring with substituents.

But let me think about the structure of the dienophile. The anhydride is probably a cyclic five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups. So, maleic anhydride is a good example. When it reacts with a diene, it forms a six-membered ring with two ester groups attached.

Wait, but in the problem, the anhydride has a single peak in 1H NMR at 7 ppm. If it's maleic anhydride, the protons on the double bond are a pair of equivalent protons, so they give a single peak as a singlet.

So, let's proceed under the assumption that the dienophile is maleic anhydride or similar.

The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. So, it's a substituted diene. When it reacts with the dienophile, the endo rule may dictate the major product. But in the problem, two products are formed, major and minor, so perhaps the reaction can proceed via different pathways, perhaps differing in the stereochemistry or regiochemistry.

Wait, but the product has the molecular formula C13H16O3. Let me check the molecular formulas. The dienophile is an anhydride, which, from the dicarboxylic acid, would lose two water molecules. Let's say the acid is HOOC-(CH2)n-COOH, but with a double bond. So, the anhydride would have the formula (CH2)n(CO)2O, but I need to check.

Alternatively, let's compute the molecular formula. The anhydride is formed from a dicarboxylic acid. Suppose the acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH. Dehydration would lose two H2O molecules, so the formula would be (HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH) → (CH2CH2CH2(CO)2O) with loss of 2 H2O. So the formula would be C5H8O3 (for the acid, C5H10O4; minus 2 H2O (H4O2) gives C5H8O3). Wait, no. Let me compute:

HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH is HOOC-CH2-CH2-CH2-COOH → molecular formula is C5H8O4. Dehydration to form an anhydride would lose two H2O, so the anhydride would be C5H6O3.

Wait, but wait: when a diacid dehydrates to form an anhydride, each loss of H2O removes one H from each COOH group. So for each COOH group, you lose one H2O, so for two, you lose two H2O. So the formula of the anhydride would be (CnH2mO4) → (CnH2m-4O2). So, for a diacid of formula CnH2mO4, the anhydride would be CnH2m-4O2.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Let me compute for maleic acid: HOOC-CH=CH-COOH is C4H4O4. Dehydration gives maleic anhydride, which is C4H2O3. Because you lose two H2O (from two COOH groups), so 4 H and 2 O lost. So, 4 H from H4O4 becomes H2O3.

So, the dienophile has formula C4H2O3.

The diene is 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene. Let's compute its formula. Cyclopentadiene is C5H6. Adding four methyl groups (each CH3) would add 4*(CH3) → 4C and 12H. So the formula becomes C5 +4C = C9? Wait, wait. Wait, the base is cyclopentadiene, which is a five-membered ring with two double bonds? No, wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene, so structure is cyclopentane with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4. Each double bond is a CH2 group. So, the base structure is C5H6 (since a cyclopentene would be C5H8, but with two double bonds, it's C5H6).

Wait, but if it's 1,3-cyclopentadiene, the structure is a five-membered ring with double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4. Each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group. So, each CH2 becomes CH(CH3). Wait, no, because each position is a CH with a methyl group attached. Let me count: the five-membered ring has five carbons. Positions 1,2,3,4 each have a methyl group. So, each of those is CH2 in the ring, but with a methyl substitution? Hmm, perhaps each of those four positions is CH(CH3), making the formula:

Each ring carbon is CH2, but four of them have a CH3 substituent. So, for each ring carbon:

- Positions 1,2,3,4: each has a CH3 group attached. So, each of those is a CH2 group in the ring, but with a CH3 substituent, so each is CH(CH3) in the ring. So, each has 2 substituents: the ring (as CH2) and a methyl.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the molecular formula.

Each ring carbon is CH2. Four of them have a methyl group, so each adds a CH3. So, the diene is C5H6 plus four CH3 groups, which is 4*(CH3) → 4 C and 12 H. So total formula is C5 +4C = C9, H6 + 12 H = H18? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the structure is a 1,3-cyclopentadiene (five-membered ring with conjugated double bonds at 1-2 and 3-4). Each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group. So, the structure is:

- Carbon 1: CH(CH3)
- Carbon 2: CH(CH3)
- Carbon 3: CH(CH3)
- Carbon 4: CH(CH3)
- Carbon 5: CH2 (if any substituent, but in this case, it's just CH2).

Wait, no, because the ring is five-membered, each carbon is bonded to two others. So, if carbons 1 and 2 are double-bonded, and 3 and 4 are double-bonded, then the structure is:

1 (double bond to 2) → CH(CH3)
2 (double bond to 1 and single bond to 3) → CH(CH3)
3 (single bond to 2, double bond to 4) → CH(CH3)
4 (double bond to 3 and single bond to 5) → CH(CH3)
5 → CH2 (since it's a five-membered ring, connected to 4 and 1?)

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's think of each ring carbon. The ring is cyclopentene with two double bonds, but wait, cyclopentadiene can't have two double bonds in a five-membered ring. Oh wait, 1,3-cyclopentadiene isn't possible because that would require two non-conjugated double bonds. Wait, no, 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a conjugated diene. So, the structure is a five-membered ring with double bonds between 1-2 and 3-4, making it a conjugated diene.

Each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group attached. So, the formula would be C5 (ring) + 4*CH3. So, that's 5 +4 =9 carbons. Hydrogen: each ring CH has two H (since in a ring, each carbon is bonded to two adjacent carbons and two substituents). Wait, no.

Wait, the ring structure for 1,3-cyclopentadiene is:

1-2 double bond, 3-4 double bond. So, the structure is like:

1: CH2
2: CH
3: CH2
4: CH
5: CH2

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps each double bond is between 1-2 and 3-4, making the ring have two double bonds, which would make it a cumulene, but that's not possible in a five-membered ring. Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should just calculate the formula.

Each of the four carbons (1,2,3,4) has a methyl group attached. So, each of those four carbons has a CH(CH3), perhaps. So, each methyl adds a CH3, bringing 4*(CH3) = 4 C and 12 H.

The cyclopentadiene part is C5H6. So, adding the four methyl groups, the formula becomes C5 +4 = C9, and H6 + 12 = H18? Wait, that can't be right because the ring is conjugated, which might have fewer hydrogens. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think of it as the diene is C9H14? Or maybe I should compute it more carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecular formula of the diene is C9H12. Because the base diene, 1,3-cyclopentadiene, is C5H6. Adding four methyl groups (each CH3) increases the C by 4 and H by 12 (since each CH3 adds 3 H). So, 5 +4 =9 C, 6 +12=18 H. Wait, that would make it C9H18. But wait, that seems high for a diene.

Alternatively, perhaps the diene is 1,3-cyclopentadiene, which is C5H6. Then adding four methyl groups (each CH3) would give C5 +4 = 9 C. Hydrogens: each CH3 adds 3 H. So, 6 (from C5H6) + 4*3 = 6+12=18 H. So, the diene is C9H18.

Wait, but that seems a bit high. Let me think again. The structure of 1,3-cyclopentadiene is a five-membered ring with two double bonds, but that's not possible. Wait, no, 1,3-cyclopentadiene isn't a real compound because that would imply two double bonds in a five-membered ring, which isn't possible. Oh wait, perhaps it's a typo and it's 1,3-cyclopentadiene as in the ring positions, but maybe it's a monoene. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me move on.

The reaction between the anhydride (C4H2O3) and the diene (C9H18) would form a product. The product's formula is C13H16O3. Let's check the formula:

C4 (anhydride) + C9 (dien) → C13, which matches.

Hydrogen: 2 (anhydride) +18 (dien) → 20, but the product has 16 H. So, 20-4=16. That suggests four H are lost, perhaps as two H2 molecules, implying two double bonds are formed. Which makes sense in a Diels-Alder reaction, which forms a six-membered ring with a double bond.

So, the Diels-Alder product would be a bicyclic structure. The reaction forms two new sigma bonds, and the diene and dienophile each contribute four and two pi electrons, respectively, leading to a six-membered ring with substituents.

Now, the problem states that the reaction yields two products, major and minor. So, perhaps the reaction has some stereochemistry involved, leading to two possible diastereomers or enantiomers.

The next part is about the NOESY spectra. The major product has a cross-peak, while the minor doesn't. NOESY detects through-space interactions between protons, so a cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space, even if they're not coupled.

In the major product, there's a cross-peak between two specific protons, which are the ones we're supposed to identify.

Looking at the options, the possible pairs are:

A) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm
B) 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm
C) 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm
D) 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm

Hmm. So the question is which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak in the major product.

In the major product, which is likely the endo product of the Diels-Alder reaction, we would expect specific spatial arrangements of the substituents.

In the Diels-Alder product, the endo rule suggests that the substituents are on the same face, leading to a particular conformation where some protons are close in space.

So, in the product, the substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride) would be in a specific orientation relative to the substituents from the diene.

The diene is highly substituted with methyl groups. So, the product would have several methyl groups in specific positions.

Looking at the options, the cross-peak involves two groups of protons. For example, in option C, two singlets at ~1 ppm and ~1.7 ppm. These might be two sets of equivalent methyl groups that are close in space.

Alternatively, option B is a 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at 3.5. Singlets at 3.5 ppm might be from OCH2 or something similar, but I'm not sure.

Wait, in the Diels-Alder adduct, the substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride) would be at the ends of the six-membered ring. The dienophile's substituents would be in a trans configuration relative to each other in the bicyclic structure.

So, considering the product's structure, perhaps there are methyl groups from the diene that are positioned adjacent to the substituents from the anhydride.

Wait, perhaps the substituents in the product are such that two methyl groups are in proximity, leading to a NOE effect when they are close.

In the major product, the endo transition state would have the substituents from the dienophile (the anhydride's groups) positioned on the same face as the diene's substituents (the methyl groups). This would bring certain protons into close proximity.

So, in the structure, perhaps a pair of methyl groups (like from the diene) are on the same face, near the oxygen atoms from the anhydride.

Wait, but how does that translate into the NMR signals?

Suppose that the product has two sets of methyl groups that are near each other. For example, two methyl groups attached to adjacent carbons in the ring, which are close in space, leading to a NOE effect.

Looking at the options, option C says a 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. That would imply two separate sets of methyl groups, each as singlets, and in proximity.

Alternatively, option A has a 6H singlet and a 1H doublet. Perhaps a methyl group and a methylene group.

But the problem states that the cross-peak is present in the major product, implying that the structure has protons that are close in space, which would be more likely in a more compact structure, maybe from the endo transition state.

Wait, in the major product, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that certain methyl groups are on the same face, leading to a NOE interaction.

Another angle: the cross-peak in the NOESY suggests that the two protons are close in space. So, perhaps in the major product, there is an axial-equatorial arrangement where two protons are close, but in the minor product, they are trans and further apart.

Alternatively, perhaps in the major product, the two substituents are on the same side, leading their protons to be close, whereas in the minor product, they're opposite, so the protons are not close.

Now, looking at the options, for example, option C has two singlets of 6H each. Singlets suggest that all the protons are equivalent, perhaps in a symmetric environment. For instance, two methyl groups that are equivalent and situated symmetrically, but on opposite sides of the ring.

But for a cross-peak to occur, the protons must be close, so perhaps the two sets are close in space. So, in the structure, perhaps one set is on one face, and another is on the same face elsewhere, leading to proximity.

Alternatively, perhaps the 6H singlet at 1 ppm is from two methyl groups attached to adjacent carbons, and the 6H at 1.7 is from another pair of methyl groups that are near them.

Alternatively, let's think about the structure of the product. The Diels-Alder product would have a bicyclic structure, perhaps with substituents from both the diene and the dienophile.

The dienophile (anhydride) brings in two ester groups or similar. The diene brings in four methyl groups.

In the product, perhaps the substituents are in positions that lead to specific proximity of certain groups.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclo structure where the substituents are in positions that cause some methyl groups to be close to each other.

Alternatively, perhaps the product has two methyl groups that are adjacent and on the same face, leading to a cross-peak.

Let me think about the NMR shifts. A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm is likely a set of equivalent methyl groups attached to something deshielded, perhaps adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group like an oxygen. But wait, 1 ppm is more like a methyl group in an ethyl position, perhaps.

Alternatively, 1.7 ppm is more in line with a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, perhaps, as those are typically around 2-3 ppm. Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, in a ring structure, the substituents might cause the shift to be lower.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck on the exact shifts. Maybe I should consider the options again.

Option C: two singlets. Each 6H, at 1 and 1.7 ppm. That suggests two sets of equivalent methyl groups. Perhaps in the major product, these two sets are on the same face, leading to a cross-peak.

Alternatively, option B: 6H singlet at 1.7 and 2H singlet at 3.5. The 2H at 3.5 could be a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps an OCH2 group. But in the product, there's an anhydride-derived group. So, perhaps the O is part of an ester or lactone.

But considering the product's formula, C13H16O3, it's a combination of the anhydride (C4H2O3) and diene (C9H18). Wait, no, the diene is C9H18, but the product is C13H16O3. So, the diene must lose some H to form the product. Wait, adding C4 + C9 = C13, and H2 + H18 = H20, but the product has H16, so 4 H are lost, likely as two double bonds (each double bond removes two H). So the product has two double bonds, perhaps.

So, the product is a bicyclic compound with two rings and two double bonds.

Wait, perhaps the product is a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptene structure. Because Diels-Alder adds a six-membered ring, but with the diene being part of a ring, it might form a bridged bicyclic structure.

In such a structure, substituents from the dienophile would be at the bridgehead positions. The diene's substituents (the methyl groups) would be on adjacent carbons.

So, in the major product, the substituents (methyl groups) from the diene would be in an endo position, leading to certain spatial arrangements.

In the NOESY spectrum, the cross-peak indicates that two protons are close in space. In the major product, perhaps two methyl groups are on the same face, leading their protons to interact.

Looking at the options, option C has two singlets, 6H each, which suggests two sets of equivalent methyl groups. If these are on the same face, their protons would be close, leading to a cross-peak.

Option A has a 6H singlet and a 1H doublet. That could be, perhaps, a methyl group and an adjacent proton, but I'm not sure.

Option D has a 1H doublet and 2H singlet. The 2H singlet could be a methylene group, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen.

But considering the cross-peak in the NOESY, the two resonances connected are likely to be two sets of protons that are spatially close. So, if it's a 6H singlet and another 6H singlet, perhaps the two methyl groups are adjacent and on the same face, causing their protons to be close.

Wait, but 6H each—so two methyl groups (3H each) would sum to 6H. Alternatively, two sets of three methyl groups each? No, that's not possible. Or perhaps it's a single set of six equivalent protons, but that's unlikely.

Wait, maybe the 6H singlet is from two equivalent methyl groups. So, each group has 3H, totaling 6H. Similarly for the other singlet.

So, in the major product, perhaps there are two methyl groups that are equivalent and close to another two methyl groups, which are also equivalent. Their proximity would lead to a cross-peak in the NOESY.

Option C says that the cross-peak connects a 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. So, that would mean two sets of equivalent methyl groups, each 6H. But that's impossible because 6H would require two methyl groups each (3H each) for each set.

But wait, maybe it's a single methyl group (3H) and another group. No, the options don't seem to align perfectly.

Alternatively, the cross-peak might involve a methyl group and another proton. For example, a methyl group's protons could be close to another proton, like a methine proton.

Wait, looking at option D: a 1H doublet and a 2H singlet. The 1H could be a proton adjacent to the methyl groups, perhaps, and the 2H a methylene group. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the cross-peak is between a methyl group and a neighboring proton that's on a different carbon but close in space.

Wait, maybe the structure has a bridge, and a methyl group is attached near a bridgehead, making the protons on the methyl group close to a bridgehead proton.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the Diels-Alder transition state. The endo rule suggests that substituents on the dienophile are on the same face as the diene's substituents. So, the methyl groups from the diene would be positioned near the substituents from the anhydride in the product.

In the product, the substituents from the anhydride (the oxygen-containing groups) would be positioned in such a way that the methyl groups from the diene are close to each other.

In the major product, perhaps two methyl groups from the diene are on the same face, leading their protons to interact via NOE. So, their NMR signals would show a cross-peak.

If the product has, for example, two methyl groups on adjacent carbons in a ring, and those two methyl groups are on the same face (endo), their protons would be close, leading to a cross-peak in the NOESY.

Now, looking at the options, which pair of resonances would correspond to two methyl groups that are close?

Option C has two singlets, each 6H. That would require two sets of two methyl groups, which might be arranged symmetrically. For example, two methyl groups on adjacent carbons and another two on the opposite side but also adjacent. But that might not be the case.

Alternatively, option B has a 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at 3.5. The 2H at 3.5 could be a methylene group attached to an oxygen. The 6H singlet might be from two methyl groups attached to adjacent carbons.

If those two methyl groups are on the same face, their protons would be close, leading to a cross-peak. But option B's 6H is a singlet, and the 2H is a singlet. So, perhaps the 6H is from two methyl groups, and the 2H is from a methylene group elsewhere.

Alternatively, the cross-peak could be between a methyl group and a methylene group if their protons are close.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another approach is to think about which options are less likely. For example, option A has a 6H singlet and a 1H doublet. That would imply a methyl group and a methine proton. But why would those be close? Perhaps if the methyl is attached to a carbon adjacent to a proton that's part of a bridge.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, option D has a 1H doublet and a 2H singlet. Maybe a methyl group and a methylene group are adjacent. But again, not sure.

Wait, the question is about which two resonances are connected by the cross-peak in the major product. The cross-peak is present in the major product but not in the minor. So, the spatial arrangement in the major product brings those two sets of protons close.

In the major product, perhaps the substituents (like the methyl groups) are on the same face, leading to proximity. So, the two sets of methyl groups are on the same face, making their protons close enough for a NOE effect.

If the product has two methyl groups adjacent on one face and another two on the same face, their protons would be close, leading to a cross-peak.

But looking at the options, the only option that connects two singlets is option C. So, each 6H is a set of methyl groups, perhaps.

Wait, but wait. If the product has a bridged bicyclic structure, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that two methyl groups are on one bridge and another two on another bridge, but on the same face. So, their protons are close.

In that case, the cross-peak would be between the methyl groups on the same face.

So, for option C, a 6H singlet at 1 ppm and another 6H singlet at 1.7 ppm. That would mean two sets of two methyl groups each, each set being equivalent and close to each other.

Alternatively, perhaps each 6H is from a single methyl group split into multiple peaks, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the 6H singlet is from two equivalent methyl groups, each contributing 3H. So, two methyl groups, 6H total.

Similarly, another 6H singlet would be two more methyl groups. So, four methyl groups in total, which matches the diene's four methyl groups.

So, in the major product, two of the methyl groups are close to the other two, leading to a cross-peak between the two sets.

Thus, the correct option would be C: a 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm.

But wait, why would they be at different ppm? Maybe because their environments are different. For example, one set is near an electron-withdrawing group, shifting their ppm higher.

Alternatively, perhaps one set is more shielded, appearing at 1 ppm, and the other is less shielded, appearing at 1.7 ppm.

In any case, based on the reasoning, the cross-peak connects two sets of methyl groups that are close in space. The only option that connects two singlets is option C.


The problem involves a dicarboxylic acid with a cis-alkene that dehydrates to form an anhydride. The anhydride reacts with 1,2,3,4-tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene via a Diels-Alder reaction, yielding two products: a major and a minor product. Both products have the molecular formula C13H16O3. The major product exhibits a cross-peak in its 2D NOESY NMR spectrum, while the minor product does not. The task is to determine which two resonances are connected by this cross-peak in the major product.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Anhydride**:  
   The anhydride is likely a cyclic structure, such as maleic anhydride, which has two carbonyl carbons (165 ppm in 13C NMR) and a single peak at 7 ppm in 1H NMR, corresponding to equivalent protons on the double bond.

2. **Diels-Alder Reaction**:  
   The reaction between the anhydride (dienophile) and the tetramethyl-1,3-cyclopentadiene (diene) forms a bicyclic product. The major product likely follows the endo rule, where substituents are positioned on the same face of the bicyclic structure, leading to spatial proximity of certain protons.

3. **NOESY Cross-Peak**:  
   The cross-peak in the NOESY spectrum of the major product indicates through-space interaction between two protons that are close in space. This is consistent with the spatial arrangement of substituents in the endo product, where methyl groups from the diene are positioned near each other.

4. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm. This suggests a methyl group and a methine proton, but there is no clear spatial or chemical reason for these protons to interact in the major product.  
   - **Option B**: A 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. The 2H singlet at 3.5 ppm could correspond to a methylene group near an oxygen, but this does not align with the expected spatial arrangement of methyl groups in the major product.  
   - **Option C**: A 6H singlet at ~1 ppm and a 6H singlet at ~1.7 ppm. This corresponds to two sets of equivalent methyl groups, likely positioned on the same face of the bicyclic structure in the major product, leading to a cross-peak due to their proximity.  
   - **Option D**: A 1H doublet at ~1.5 ppm and a 2H singlet at ~3.5 ppm. This suggests a methine proton and a methylene group, but there is no clear evidence for such a spatial interaction in the major product.

5. **Conclusion**:  
   The most plausible explanation is that the cross-peak in the major product connects two sets of equivalent methyl groups, each contributing to a singlet in the 1H NMR spectrum. These methyl groups are spatially close due to the endo arrangement in the bicyclic structure.
