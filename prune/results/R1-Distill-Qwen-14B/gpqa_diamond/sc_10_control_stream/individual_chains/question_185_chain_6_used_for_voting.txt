Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try my best.

The Hamiltonian given is H = ε σ · n. Oh wait, σ is the vector of Pauli spin matrices, and n is a unit vector. So σ · n is like the dot product of the Pauli matrices with n. I remember that the Pauli matrices are σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, each being 2x2 matrices.

Wait, but the Hamiltonian is a scalar multiplied by the dot product of σ and n. So it's actually H = ε (σ_x n_x + σ_y n_y + σ_z n_z). That makes sense. So H is a 2x2 matrix because each σ is 2x2, and ε is a scalar.

Eigenvalues of H... right, the eigenvalues of a Pauli matrix σ · n are known. I think for any unit vector n, the eigenvalues of σ · n are plus and minus 1. Because σ · n is a spin operator along the direction of n, and the possible eigenvalues are ± ħ/2, but wait, wait. Or is that for the spin operator S · n?

Wait, no. The Pauli matrices themselves have eigenvalues ±1. Because, for example, σ_z is diagonal with entries +1 and -1. And if you have a matrix like n · σ, which is a linear combination of σ_x, σ_y, σ_z, it's similar to the same structure. Let me think.

The general form is H = ε (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z). Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1, but when you take a linear combination, what's the eigenvalue of that matrix?

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the square of the matrix. Since σ · n is a sum of Pauli matrices, its square would be (σ · n)^2. Let's compute that.

(σ · n)^2 = (n_x σ_x + n_y σ_y + n_z σ_z)^2. Expanding this, each σ_i squared is I (identity matrix), right? Because σ_x^2 = σ_y^2 = σ_z^2 = I. So expanding:

= n_x^2 I + n_y^2 I + n_z^2 I + cross terms.

The cross terms involve terms like n_x n_y (σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x). But wait, σ_x σ_y = i σ_z, and σ_y σ_x = -i σ_z. So the cross terms cancel out because σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x = 0. So the square becomes (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I. Since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So (σ · n)^2 = I.

So that means σ · n is a matrix whose square is the identity. So the eigenvalues squared must be 1. Therefore, the eigenvalues are ±1. So when we have H = ε (σ · n), the eigenvalues would be ε multiplied by these eigenvalues.

Wait, no. Wait, H is ε times (σ · n). So the eigenvalues of H are ε times the eigenvalues of σ · n. And σ · n has eigenvalues ±1. So H's eigenvalues are ± ε.

Wait, but wait a second. Are the eigenvalues of σ · n really ±1? Because I thought the spin matrices have eigenvalues ± ħ/2. Hmm, no, wait, that's different. The spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ. So the eigenvalues of S · n are ± ħ/2. But in this problem, H is ε times σ · n, without the ħ/2 factor.

So in this case, the eigenvalues of H would be ± ε. Because the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1, so when multiplied by ε, it's ± ε.

Looking at the options, option B is +ε, -ε. So that's the answer.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. So the operator H is ε times σ · n. As we found, σ · n squared is I, so its eigenvalues are ±1. So H would have eigenvalues ± ε. So the correct option is B.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \( \vec{\sigma} \) represents the Pauli spin matrices and \( \vec{n} \) is a unit vector. The task is to determine the eigenvalues of \( H \).

The Pauli matrices \( \vec{\sigma} \) are 2x2 matrices, and \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a linear combination of the Pauli matrices weighted by the components of \( \vec{n} \). The eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are known to be \( \pm 1 \) because \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) is a spin operator along the direction of \( \vec{n} \), and its square is the identity matrix (\( (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I \)).

Since \( H = \varepsilon (\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}) \), the eigenvalues of \( H \) are simply \( \varepsilon \) times the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( H \) are \( \pm \varepsilon \).

Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**A)** \( +1, -1 \): Incorrect, as the eigenvalues are scaled by \( \varepsilon \).  
**B)** \( +\varepsilon, -\varepsilon \): Correct, as explained above.  
**C)** \( +\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2 \): Incorrect, as the eigenvalues of \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \) are \( \pm 1 \), not \( \pm \hbar/2 \).  
**D)** \( +\hbar/2, -\hbar/2 \): Incorrect, as this corresponds to the eigenvalues of the spin operator \( \vec{S} \cdot \vec{n} \), not \( \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \).

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian \( H \) are \( +\varepsilon \) and \( -\varepsilon \).

= n_x^2 I + n_y^2 I + n_z^2 I + cross terms.

The cross terms involve terms like n_x n_y (σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x). But wait, σ_x σ_y = i σ_z, and σ_y σ_x = -i σ_z. So the cross terms cancel out because σ_x σ_y + σ_y σ_x = 0. So the square becomes (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2) I. Since n is a unit vector, n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2 = 1. So (σ · n)^2 = I.

So that means σ · n is a matrix whose square is the identity. So the eigenvalues squared must be 1. Therefore, the eigenvalues are ±1. So when we have H = ε (σ · n), the eigenvalues would be ε multiplied by these eigenvalues.

Wait, no. Wait, H is ε times (σ · n). So the eigenvalues of H are ε times the eigenvalues of σ · n. And σ · n has eigenvalues ±1. So H's eigenvalues are ± ε.

So in this case, the eigenvalues of H would be ± ε. Because the eigenvalues of σ · n are ±1, so when multiplied by ε, it's ± ε.
