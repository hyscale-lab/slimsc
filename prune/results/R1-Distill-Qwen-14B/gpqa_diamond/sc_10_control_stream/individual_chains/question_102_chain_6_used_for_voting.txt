Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetics, specifically about a ligand-receptor pair and a mouse model they're trying to study. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup is that they've identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to understand their developmental fate. So, they're using a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Let me recall what bicistronic means—it means the vector has two coding regions, so two genes are expressed from the same vector.

The vector has the ligand's ORF at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Then, the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. Wait, so the ligand is first, then the receptor part comes after. Oh, but there are stop cassettes in between. Between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between the receptor and eGFP, it's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Hmm, I remember that loxP sites are used for site-specific recombination, usually with Cre. So, when Cre is present, it will excise the stop cassette, allowing the genes to be expressed.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, I think. The receptor is under... wait, looking again: the ligand ORF is under CBA, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES. Oh, IRES elements allow internal ribosome entry, so they can drive the translation of the downstream gene, especially in a bicistronic vector. So, the setup is probably that the ligand is first, under CBA, then an IRES, followed by the receptor, and then eGFP after a stop cassette.

Wait, but the stop cassettes are in specific lox sites. So, when Cre is present, it would recombine the lox sites, removing the stop cassettes. So, for the ligand and mCherry: the ligand is under CBA, then a stop with loxP. When Cre is present, it would delete the stop, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. Similarly, the receptor would be expressed with eGFP, with the stop after the receptor being under lox2272. So, Cre would delete that as well.

But wait, in the question, they've transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture. Then, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on a Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin, meaning the loading is correct. So, the expression is working in the cells. But when they breed mice homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background, then cross them with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, the offspring don't show a green signal under the confocal.

Wait, the green signal would be from eGFP. So, the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Looking at the possible options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells, but I don't think this directly affects the expression of the GFP. Because in the mice, they might be expecting the Cre to activate the construct. But I'm not sure how paracrine vs. autocrine would matter here.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would affect trafficking, so you wouldn't see the GFP on the surface, but maybe in the cells. But the question says they didn't observe a green signal, which could mean it's not expressed or not fluorescent. If it's stuck in the Golgi, maybe they could see some fluorescence if they do intracellular imaging, but under confocal microscopy, perhaps they're looking for surface expression. But why would that happen? The construct itself should have the necessary signals for trafficking.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Wait, the vector uses the CBA promoter for the ligand. CBA is a strong promoter, so without an enhancer, maybe expression is low. But in the initial Western blot, they saw expression. So perhaps the expression is okay, but when they use SOX10-Cre, something's wrong. Or maybe the enhancer is missing in the mouse construct, but the CBA promoter is sufficient.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh, wait, the eGFP is after the receptor. Are they using a stop cassette that only allows for the receptor to be expressed, and the eGFP not being in frame? Wait, let me think. The vector is a bicistronic one. The ligand is at 5' with mCherry, and the receptor is at 3', with eGFP. Between ligand and mCherry, the stop cassette is loxP, so when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed as a fusion? Or perhaps the ligand is under CBA, then the IRES, so the receptor is under the control of the IRES. Wait, the setup is a bit complex.

Wait, in the vector, the ligand's ORF is at 5', then a stop cassette, then the receptor. So, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, the receptor is under the IRES. So, without Cre, the stop cassettes would prevent the ligand from being expressed with mCherry, and the receptor from being expressed with eGFP. Wait, but in the initial transfection in astrocytes, they saw expression. How?

Wait, maybe in the plasmid, when you don't have Cre, the stop cassettes prevent the expression of the downstream fusions. So, for example, the ligand is under CBA, but after the ligand's ORF comes a stop with loxP. Without Cre, the stop remains, so the ligand would be expressed (since CBA is a promoter), but the mCherry would be behind a stop, so you wouldn't get the fusion. Similarly, the receptor is after the IRES, which is a promoter for the second gene. So, in the absence of Cre, the receptor would be expressed (because the IRES allows it), but its expression is followed by a stop cassette under lox2272. So, eGFP would not be expressed.

But in the Western blot, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and saw a signal. So, perhaps in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, but not fused to mCherry, and the receptor is expressed without the eGFP. But when they have Cre, the stop cassettes would be removed, allowing the mCherry to be expressed alongside the ligand, and the eGFP to be expressed alongside the receptor.

Wait, but the question says they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and saw a signal proportional to actin. So, perhaps the expression of the ligand and receptor is confirmed. So, when they express the construct in the cells, either with or without Cre, the ligand and receptor are expressed, but the fusion proteins (ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP) are only expressed when Cre is present, which deletes the stop cassettes.

But in the mouse model, the mice are homozygous for the construct. They crossed them with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so the Cre would be active there. So, the Cre would recombine the loxP and lox2272 sites, removing the stop cassettes. So, in the neural crest cells, the ligand would be expressed with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP.

But when they look under the confocal, they don't see green. That suggests that the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Looking at the options again. Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, that would mean that the reading frame is incorrect, so the eGFP might not be expressed properly, or not at all. But in the Western blot in the cells, they saw the proteins expressed. So, perhaps the Western blot detected the receptor, but not the eGFP. Wait, but the eGFP is only expressed when Cre is present, which is in the neural crest cells.

Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop cassette wasn't correctly removed. But if the Cre is active, it should have done that.

Wait, the problem is that the eGFP is not expressed in the mice. So, perhaps the vector wasn't correctly recombined. Let me think about the vector structure again.

The vector is a bicistronic vector. The ligand is first, under CBA, then after the ligand ORF comes a stop with loxP. Then the IRES, then the receptor ORF, followed by a stop with lox2272, and then eGFP. Without Cre, the ligand is expressed (since CBA is a strong promoter), but the mCherry is not expressed. The receptor is expressed under the IRES, but the eGFP is not. When Cre is present, the loxP sites are recombined, so the ligand + mCherry are expressed, and the receptor + eGFP are expressed.

But in the mouse model, the construct is probably inserted into the genome without Cre, so the stop cassettes are intact. Then, when crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, the Cre would activate in the neural crest cells, recombining the loxP and lox2272 sites, removing the stops, so the eGFP should be expressed along with the receptor.

But in the offspring, the eGFP isn't visible. So, why?

Let me think about the vector's configuration. The stop cassettes are loxP and lox2272. LoxP is a 34 bp site, while lox2272 is a 33 bp site, but they are different. Cre can recombine loxP sites, but lox2272 is a mutant version that can't be recombined by Cre unless in a certain context? Or, wait, no, lox2272 is a variant that requires Cre, but perhaps can only be recombined with another lox2272 or a standard loxP?

Wait, no—loxP is the original site, and lox2272 is a variant that can only be efficiently recombined when paired with another lox2272, I think. Because loxP recombination requires two loxP sites. So, if you have a loxP and a lox2272, Cre won't recombine them because they are different. So, the stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP is under lox2272, so if the Cre can't recombine that, then the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Ah, so in the vector, the stop for the receptor-eGFP is under lox2272. So, when Cre is introduced (like in the SOX10-Cre mice), the Cre can only recombine loxP sites. So, the loxP in the ligand's stop cassette would be recombined, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the lox2272 in the receptor's stop cassette would not be recombined, because Cre can't recognize lox2272. So, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but I thought that Cre can only recombine loxP sites. So, if the stop cassette after the receptor is a lox2272, Cre won't remove it. Thus, the eGFP won't be expressed. So, the transgene would produce the ligand and mCherry (because the first stop is removed), but the receptor would not be followed by eGFP because the stop isn't removed. So, in the mice, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP is not, so no green signal.

But why would the problem not allow the eGFP to be expressed? Because the stop cassette after the receptor is not loxP, but lox2272, and Cre can't remove it. So, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options again. Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't even expressed, so the question is about why eGFP isn't expressed.

But according to the options, option D is about the frame, which is different. Hmm.

Wait, what's the correct setup for the vector? For the stop cassette to be removed, the lox sites should be the same. So, if the vector has loxP in one stop and lox2272 in another, and Cre is present, only the loxP would be recombined, but the lox2272 would not. So, the first stop (after ligand) is loxP, so when Cre is present, it's removed. The second stop (after receptor) is lox2272, which Cre can't recombine, so the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

So, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop cassette between receptor and eGFP isn't removed. So why is that?

Because the lox sites are different. The ligand's stop is loxP, so Cre can remove it. The receptor's stop is lox2272, which requires another lox2272 to recombine, or perhaps another variant.

So, in the mouse model, the construct has the ligand and receptor with different lox sites. When SOX10-Cre is introduced, which only recognizes loxP, it only deletes the loxP stops, not the lox2272. So, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Which option aligns with this? Let's look.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That's about the expression construct's reading frame. If they're not in frame, the eGFP might not be expressed, but I think that would be a cloning issue. Alternatively, if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. But the question says that in the Western blot, the proteins were expressed, but in the mouse, the GFP isn't present.

Wait, but in the Western blot, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So, perhaps the Western blot showed that the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP wasn't. Or maybe the mCherry and ligand are expressed, but the eGFP isn't.

So, the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed.

Which option points to the stop not being removed because of the wrong lox sites?

Looking back at the options, none directly mention lox sites. Wait, the options given are A to D.

Hmm. Let me think again. The main issue is that eGFP isn't expressed because the stop cassette isn't recombined. So, the reason is due to the stop cassette's lox sites not being compatible with Cre.

But in the options, the only possible fit is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. No, that doesn't explain why the stop isn't removed.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible answers.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't in the correct frame, so it's not expressed. But in this case, the stop wasn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed anyway. So why would the frame matter if the stop remains?

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, so even if the stop is removed, it's not expressed correctly.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic vector. So, for the receptor-eGFP fusion, if the stop is not removed, eGFP isn't expressed. So in the mouse, without Cre, the stop is present; with Cre, the stop is only removed for the ligand side because the lox2272 isn't recombined. So, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the problem is that the Western blot shows expression. Wait, the initial experiment was in primary astrocytes. They transfected the plasmid and used antibodies against the proteins. So, maybe in that case, the stop cassettes are not present in the plasmid, or the Cre was provided, leading to the expression of the fusions. But in the mice, without induced Cre, the stops are in place.

Wait, but the mice are homozygous for the construct. Then, when crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is expressed under the control of SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells.

So, perhaps the issue is that in the vector, the stop cassettes are not the same. So, the ligand's stop is loxP, the receptor's is lox2272. So, in the presence of Cre (from SOX10-Cre), only the loxP stop is removed, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

So, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop cassette isn't removed. But why? Because the lox sites are incompatible. So, the problem is that the stop cassettes have different lox sites, making the second stop (after receptor) unresponsive to Cre.

But looking at the options, none of them directly state that. So, perhaps the best option is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But that's about the reading frame after the stop is removed. Alternatively, perhaps the stop isn't removed, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, another angle: the vector's design. The ligand is at 5', followed by a stop, then IRES, then receptor, then stop, then eGFP.

If the IRES is after the ligand's stop, then without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. The receptor is expressed under the IRES, but eGFP isn't because of the stop.

With Cre, the ligand's stop is removed, so mCherry is expressed in frame. The receptor's stop is lox2272, which Cre can't remove, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is between the receptor and eGFP and it's a lox2272. So, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed.

But the question is why the eGFP isn't expressed. So, the reason is that the stop couldn't be removed because the lox sites are different. But the options don't include that. So, perhaps the issue is more about the expression in the vector.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, so even if the stop is removed, it's not expressed as a fusion. But in that case, the eGFP might be expressed as a separate ORF. Or maybe the eGFP is in a different frame, leading to no expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the frame is correct but the stop isn't removed, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't directly state anything about lox sites. So, perhaps the answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, but if they're not in frame, the eGFP would be a separate ORF, or perhaps a nonfunctional protein. But the question says that the vector has the receptor ORF and eGFP in the same construct, with a stop in between. So, if the stop is not removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But if the stop is removed, and the eGFP is in frame, then it would be expressed. If the stop is not removed (as in this case), the eGFP isn't expressed.

So, in the mouse, the SOX10-Cre is supposed to remove the receptor's stop, but it can't because it's a lox2272. Thus, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But looking at the options, none directly address this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the stop is after the receptor, and the eGFP is under a different promoter. Hmm, no, the eGFP is fused to the receptor.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not being expressed because it's under a different promoter.

Wait, another thought: the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES. So, when Cre is present, the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed, and the receptor and eGFP are co-expressed.

But if the stop after the receptor isn't removed (because of the lox2272), the eGFP isn't expressed. So, in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop wasn't removed.

But the options don't directly say that. So, perhaps the answer is option D, but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed in such a way that the eGFP is not in frame, so even if the stop is removed, it doesn't express. But why would the frame be wrong?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is after the ligand, and the receptor comes after. So, the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed, but if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the problem is about why eGFP isn't expressed. So, the most likely reason is that the stop isn't removed, and thus the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't directly address the stop. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Looking again at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. That would mean they act on other cells. But why would that prevent eGFP expression? Maybe if the ligand isn't expressed, or the receptor isn't, but in this case, the ligand and receptor are both expressed, but eGFP isn't. So, A isn't directly relevant.

B) The receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. So, the eGFP would be present but not on the surface. If they're using confocal microscopy, maybe they're looking for surface expression, so they don't see it. But in the Western blot, the receptor would be present, but not eGFP. But in the Western blot, the proteins were detected proportionally to actin, so perhaps the eGFP isn't present. So, B could be a reason.

But why would the receptor-eGFP be stuck in the Golgi? The vector seems correctly designed. So, perhaps this is not the issue.

C) The enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor under IRES would have expression, so maybe the expression is sufficient.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. So, even if the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed correctly. But if the stop is not removed, this wouldn't matter. So, the main issue is that the stop isn't removed, preventing eGFP expression.

But the options don't include the stop cassette issue. So, perhaps the correct answer is D because the eGFP isn't being expressed, perhaps because it's not in frame, or maybe it's a matter of the stop not being removed.

Wait, but in the mice, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. So, perhaps the issue is that the lox sites are different, making the stop unremovable.

But none of the options mention this. So, perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the vector is constructed, the eGFP is not in frame. So, when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed because the reading frame is wrong.

But how could that happen? The eGFP would be in frame if the stop is removed.

Wait, perhaps the vector was designed with the stop in between, but the eGFP is in a different frame. For example, if the stop is removed, the receptor is in frame with eGFP, but perhaps in the vector, the stop is in a way that when it's removed, the eGFP starts in a different frame. So, the eGFP is not expressed properly.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the fusion is ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP, and the stops are in between. So, without the stops being removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So, the most likely reason is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed, which is because the lox sites are different.

But since the options don't directly address this, perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not functioning correctly, leading to receptor expression but not eGFP. But the IRES is supposed to drive the receptor expression, and the eGFP would be expressed after the receptor if the stop is removed.

Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is not expressed because the construct wasn't correctly inserted into the genome. But the question says the mice are homozygous for the construct.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If they're not in frame, then when the stop is removed, the eGFP is not expressed as a fusion, but perhaps as a separate ORF. But the vector would need to have the eGFP in frame for it to work. If it's out of frame, the eGFP might not be expressed, leading to no signal.

But in that case, even if the stop is removed (if the loxP is recombined), the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because of the frame. But in the question, the stop after the receptor is lox2272, so it's not recombined. So, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is still there, not because of the frame.

So, perhaps option D isn't the right answer.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the vector uses a stop in between, so when Cre is present, the eGFP is not expressed because the frame is incorrect. But in that case, the stop is removed, but the frame is wrong, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But in this case, the stop isn't removed because of the lox2272. So, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is present.

But again, the options don't address that. So, perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B. Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. So, the eGFP is expressed but not on the cell surface, so the confocal doesn't detect it. But then, in the Western blot, the eGFP would be detected if the antibody is used. But the question says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So, perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed at all.

So, in the Western blot, the proteins are detected, but eGFP isn't. So, if the eGFP isn't expressed, it's because the stop isn't removed.

But the question says "you use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture." So, the proteins are expressed when the plasmid is transfected. But in the mice, they're not.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that the vector's design leads to eGFP not being expressed because the frame is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector isn't correctly designed, and the eGFP isn't in frame, which would make it not expressed even if the stop is removed.

But I'm not certain. The options are a bit confusing.

Wait, another point: the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So, perhaps without Cre, the stop cassettes remain, so the ligand is expressed (under CBA) but not mCherry, and the receptor is expressed (under IRES) but not eGFP. When Cre is present, the stops are removed. So, the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed, and the receptor and eGFP are co-expressed.

In the mice, the construct is homozygous and crossed with SOX10-Cre. So, Cre is active in neural crest cells, which should recombine the loxP stops. So, the ligand and mCherry are expressed, and the receptor and eGFP are expressed. So, why isn't the eGFP expressed?

But according to the vector setup, the stop for eGFP is lox2272. So, unless the Cre can recognize lox2272, which it can't, the stop remains. So, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But again, the options don't directly address this. So, perhaps the intended answer is D, assuming that the frame is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector's design has the eGFP in a different reading frame, so even if the stop is removed, it's not expressed. But this would be a cloning error.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not correctly cloned, so it's not expressed.

But I'm not sure. Given the options, the most plausible answer based on the vector setup is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop wasn't removed due to incompatible lox sites. But since that's not an option, I'm now considering that the correct answer might be D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop isn't removed, leading to no eGFP expression. But since the options don't mention the stop, I'm left to choose the best fit.

Wait, another angle: the vector is a bicistronic construct, and the IRES is after the ligand ORF. So, perhaps the IRES isn't functioning correctly, leading to the receptor not being expressed. But then, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed either.

But the question states that the Western blot shows expression, so the proteins are expressed. So, that can't be it.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Based on the vector setup, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed, which is due to the lox2272 not being recombined by Cre. So, the eGFP isn't expressed, leading to no green signal.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is D. Or perhaps the answer is option C, but I don't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the frame is incorrect, so even if the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, the vector is designed so that the ligand is followed by a stop, which, when removed, allows mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, the receptor is followed by a stop, which, when removed, allows eGFP to be expressed.

If the stop after the receptor is lox2272, Cre can't remove it. So, eGFP isn't expressed. Thus, the reason is that the stop isn't removed because the lox sites are different.

But the answer options don't mention this. So, perhaps the intended answer is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the frame is correct, but the stop wasn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, perhaps the real reason is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, leading to the eGFP not being expressed. So, when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't translated, but that's a frame issue.

But without the stop being removed, the eGFP isn't expressed regardless of the frame.

I think I'm stuck. Given the options, I'll have to make an educated guess.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand-receptor pair, with the ligand ORF under the CBA promoter and the receptor ORF under an IRES element. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP, with stop cassettes (loxP and lox2272) between the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP constructs. The vector is transfected into primary astrocytes, and the Western blot confirms protein expression proportional to actin loading. However, when the construct is bred into mice and crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Design**:  
   - The ligand is at the 5' end, followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor is at the 3' end, followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.  
   - The ligand is expressed under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is expressed under the IRES element.  
   - Cre recombination removes the stop cassettes, allowing co-expression of ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

2. **Cre Activity in Mice**:  
   - SOX10-Cre mice express Cre under the SOX10 promoter, active in neural crest cells.  
   - Cre should recombine loxP sites but cannot recombine lox2272 sites. Thus, the loxP-stop-loxP cassette after the ligand is removed, allowing mCherry expression. However, the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette after the receptor remains intact, preventing eGFP expression.

3. **Observed Outcome**:  
   - In the Western blot, proteins are detected, confirming expression.  
   - In the mice, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy, indicating that eGFP is not expressed.

4. **Critical Issue**:  
   - The eGFP is not expressed because the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette is not removed by Cre. This is due to the incompatibility of lox2272 with Cre recombination.  
   - However, none of the answer options explicitly address this issue.

5. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**: This does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.  
   - **B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**: This would result in eGFP being present but not on the cell surface. The absence of eGFP expression altogether suggests this is not the issue.  
   - **C) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**: The CBA promoter is strong, and the IRES element drives receptor expression. This option is unlikely.  
   - **D) The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**: If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, eGFP would not be expressed even if the stop cassette is removed. However, the primary issue is that the stop cassette is not removed due to the lox2272 site, making this option less likely but the best available explanation.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation, given the answer options, is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, preventing eGFP expression. While the actual issue is the incompatibility of the lox2272 site with Cre recombination, this reasoning aligns most closely with option D.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this question about molecular biology and genetics, specifically about a ligand-receptor pair and a mouse model they're trying to study. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup is that they've identified a new ligand-receptor pair expressed in neural crest cells. They want to understand their developmental fate. So, they're using a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. Let me recall what bicistronic means—it means the vector has two coding regions, so two genes are expressed from the same vector.

The vector has the ligand's ORF at the 5' end, fused to mCherry. Then, the receptor is at the 3' end, fused to eGFP. Wait, so the ligand is first, then the receptor part comes after. Oh, but there are stop cassettes in between. Between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between the receptor and eGFP, it's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Hmm, I remember that loxP sites are used for site-specific recombination, usually with Cre. So, when Cre is present, it will excise the stop cassette, allowing the genes to be expressed.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter, which is a strong promoter, I think. The receptor is under... wait, looking again: the ligand ORF is under CBA, and upstream of the receptor is the IRES. Oh, IRES elements allow internal ribosome entry, so they can drive the translation of the downstream gene, especially in a bicistronic vector. So, the setup is probably that the ligand is first, under CBA, then an IRES, followed by the receptor, and then eGFP after a stop cassette.

Wait, but the stop cassettes are in specific lox sites. So, when Cre is present, it would recombine the lox sites, removing the stop cassettes. So, for the ligand and mCherry: the ligand is under CBA, then a stop with loxP. When Cre is present, it would delete the stop, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed together. Similarly, the receptor would be expressed with eGFP, with the stop after the receptor being under lox2272. So, Cre would delete that as well.

But wait, in the question, they've transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture. Then, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins on a Western blot. The blot shows signals proportional to actin, meaning the loading is correct. So, the expression is working in the cells. But when they breed mice homozygous for the construct in a wild-type background, then cross them with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, the offspring don't show a green signal under the confocal.

Wait, the green signal would be from eGFP. So, the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Looking at the possible options:

Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells, but I don't think this directly affects the expression of the GFP. Because in the mice, they might be expecting the Cre to activate the construct. But I'm not sure how paracrine vs. autocrine would matter here.

Option B: Receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. That would affect trafficking, so you wouldn't see the GFP on the surface, but maybe in the cells. But the question says they didn't observe a green signal, which could mean it's not expressed or not fluorescent. If it's stuck in the Golgi, maybe they could see some fluorescence if they do intracellular imaging, but under confocal microscopy, perhaps they're looking for surface expression. But why would that happen? The construct itself should have the necessary signals for trafficking.

Option C: The enhancer for ligand and receptor expression is missing. Wait, the vector uses the CBA promoter for the ligand. CBA is a strong promoter, so without an enhancer, maybe expression is low. But in the initial Western blot, they saw expression. So perhaps the expression is okay, but when they use SOX10-Cre, something's wrong. Or maybe the enhancer is missing in the mouse construct, but the CBA promoter is sufficient.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Oh, wait, the eGFP is after the receptor. Are they using a stop cassette that only allows for the receptor to be expressed, and the eGFP not being in frame? Wait, let me think. The vector is a bicistronic one. The ligand is at 5' with mCherry, and the receptor is at 3', with eGFP. Between ligand and mCherry, the stop cassette is loxP, so when Cre is present, the stop is removed, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed as a fusion? Or perhaps the ligand is under CBA, then the IRES, so the receptor is under the control of the IRES. Wait, the setup is a bit complex.

Wait, in the vector, the ligand's ORF is at 5', then a stop cassette, then the receptor. So, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, the receptor is under the IRES. So, without Cre, the stop cassettes would prevent the ligand from being expressed with mCherry, and the receptor from being expressed with eGFP. Wait, but in the initial transfection in astrocytes, they saw expression. How?

Wait, maybe in the plasmid, when you don't have Cre, the stop cassettes prevent the expression of the downstream fusions. So, for example, the ligand is under CBA, but after the ligand's ORF comes a stop with loxP. Without Cre, the stop remains, so the ligand would be expressed (since CBA is a promoter), but the mCherry would be behind a stop, so you wouldn't get the fusion. Similarly, the receptor is after the IRES, which is a promoter for the second gene. So, in the absence of Cre, the receptor would be expressed (because the IRES allows it), but its expression is followed by a stop cassette under lox2272. So, eGFP would not be expressed.

But in the Western blot, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins and saw a signal. So, perhaps in the absence of Cre, the ligand is expressed, but not fused to mCherry, and the receptor is expressed without the eGFP. But when they have Cre, the stop cassettes would be removed, allowing the mCherry to be expressed alongside the ligand, and the eGFP to be expressed alongside the receptor.

Wait, but the question says they transfected the plasmid into primary astrocyte culture and saw a signal proportional to actin. So, perhaps the expression of the ligand and receptor is confirmed. So, when they express the construct in the cells, either with or without Cre, the ligand and receptor are expressed, but the fusion proteins (ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP) are only expressed when Cre is present, which deletes the stop cassettes.

But in the mouse model, the mice are homozygous for the construct. They crossed them with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice. SOX10 is expressed in neural crest cells, so the Cre would be active there. So, the Cre would recombine the loxP and lox2272 sites, removing the stop cassettes. So, in the neural crest cells, the ligand would be expressed with mCherry, and the receptor with eGFP.

But when they look under the confocal, they don't see green. That suggests that the eGFP isn't being expressed. Why?

Looking at the options again. Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Wait, that would mean that the reading frame is incorrect, so the eGFP might not be expressed properly, or not at all. But in the Western blot in the cells, they saw the proteins expressed. So, perhaps the Western blot detected the receptor, but not the eGFP. Wait, but the eGFP is only expressed when Cre is present, which is in the neural crest cells.

Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is not being expressed because the stop cassette wasn't correctly removed. But if the Cre is active, it should have done that.

Wait, the problem is that the eGFP is not expressed in the mice. So, perhaps the vector wasn't correctly recombined. Let me think about the vector structure again.

The vector is a bicistronic vector. The ligand is first, under CBA, then after the ligand ORF comes a stop with loxP. Then the IRES, then the receptor ORF, followed by a stop with lox2272, and then eGFP. Without Cre, the ligand is expressed (since CBA is a strong promoter), but the mCherry is not expressed. The receptor is expressed under the IRES, but the eGFP is not. When Cre is present, the loxP sites are recombined, so the ligand + mCherry are expressed, and the receptor + eGFP are expressed.

But in the mouse model, the construct is probably inserted into the genome without Cre, so the stop cassettes are intact. Then, when crossed with SOX10-Cre mice, the Cre would activate in the neural crest cells, recombining the loxP and lox2272 sites, removing the stops, so the eGFP should be expressed along with the receptor.

But in the offspring, the eGFP isn't visible. So, why?

Let me think about the vector's configuration. The stop cassettes are loxP and lox2272. LoxP is a 34 bp site, while lox2272 is a 33 bp site, but they are different. Cre can recombine loxP sites, but lox2272 is a mutant version that can't be recombined by Cre unless in a certain context? Or, wait, no, lox2272 is a variant that requires Cre, but perhaps can only be recombined with another lox2272 or a standard loxP?

Wait, no—loxP is the original site, and lox2272 is a variant that can only be efficiently recombined when paired with another lox2272, I think. Because loxP recombination requires two loxP sites. So, if you have a loxP and a lox2272, Cre won't recombine them because they are different. So, the stop cassette between the receptor and eGFP is under lox2272, so if the Cre can't recombine that, then the stop remains, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Ah, so in the vector, the stop for the receptor-eGFP is under lox2272. So, when Cre is introduced (like in the SOX10-Cre mice), the Cre can only recombine loxP sites. So, the loxP in the ligand's stop cassette would be recombined, allowing mCherry to be expressed. But the lox2272 in the receptor's stop cassette would not be recombined, because Cre can't recognize lox2272. So, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, but I thought that Cre can only recombine loxP sites. So, if the stop cassette after the receptor is a lox2272, Cre won't remove it. Thus, the eGFP won't be expressed. So, the transgene would produce the ligand and mCherry (because the first stop is removed), but the receptor would not be followed by eGFP because the stop isn't removed. So, in the mice, the receptor is expressed, but eGFP is not, so no green signal.

But why would the problem not allow the eGFP to be expressed? Because the stop cassette after the receptor is not loxP, but lox2272, and Cre can't remove it. So, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Looking at the options again. Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't even expressed, so the question is about why eGFP isn't expressed.

But according to the options, option D is about the frame, which is different. Hmm.

Wait, what's the correct setup for the vector? For the stop cassette to be removed, the lox sites should be the same. So, if the vector has loxP in one stop and lox2272 in another, and Cre is present, only the loxP would be recombined, but the lox2272 would not. So, the first stop (after ligand) is loxP, so when Cre is present, it's removed. The second stop (after receptor) is lox2272, which Cre can't recombine, so the stop remains, and eGFP isn't expressed.

So, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop cassette between receptor and eGFP isn't removed. So why is that?

Because the lox sites are different. The ligand's stop is loxP, so Cre can remove it. The receptor's stop is lox2272, which requires another lox2272 to recombine, or perhaps another variant.

So, in the mouse model, the construct has the ligand and receptor with different lox sites. When SOX10-Cre is introduced, which only recognizes loxP, it only deletes the loxP stops, not the lox2272. So, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Which option aligns with this? Let's look.

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That's about the expression construct's reading frame. If they're not in frame, the eGFP might not be expressed, but I think that would be a cloning issue. Alternatively, if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. But the question says that in the Western blot, the proteins were expressed, but in the mouse, the GFP isn't present.

Wait, but in the Western blot, they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So, perhaps the Western blot showed that the receptor is expressed, but the eGFP wasn't. Or maybe the mCherry and ligand are expressed, but the eGFP isn't.

So, the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed.

Which option points to the stop not being removed because of the wrong lox sites?

Looking back at the options, none directly mention lox sites. Wait, the options given are A to D.

Hmm. Let me think again. The main issue is that eGFP isn't expressed because the stop cassette isn't recombined. So, the reason is due to the stop cassette's lox sites not being compatible with Cre.

But in the options, the only possible fit is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. No, that doesn't explain why the stop isn't removed.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the possible answers.

Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame. That would mean that when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't in the correct frame, so it's not expressed. But in this case, the stop wasn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed anyway. So why would the frame matter if the stop remains?

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, so even if the stop is removed, it's not expressed correctly.

Wait, the vector is a bicistronic vector. So, for the receptor-eGFP fusion, if the stop is not removed, eGFP isn't expressed. So in the mouse, without Cre, the stop is present; with Cre, the stop is only removed for the ligand side because the lox2272 isn't recombined. So, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the problem is that the Western blot shows expression. Wait, the initial experiment was in primary astrocytes. They transfected the plasmid and used antibodies against the proteins. So, maybe in that case, the stop cassettes are not present in the plasmid, or the Cre was provided, leading to the expression of the fusions. But in the mice, without induced Cre, the stops are in place.

Wait, but the mice are homozygous for the construct. Then, when crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is expressed under the control of SOX10 promoter, which is active in neural crest cells.

So, perhaps the issue is that in the vector, the stop cassettes are not the same. So, the ligand's stop is loxP, the receptor's is lox2272. So, in the presence of Cre (from SOX10-Cre), only the loxP stop is removed, allowing the ligand and mCherry to be expressed. The receptor's stop remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

So, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop cassette isn't removed. But why? Because the lox sites are incompatible. So, the problem is that the stop cassettes have different lox sites, making the second stop (after receptor) unresponsive to Cre.

But looking at the options, none of them directly state that. So, perhaps the best option is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. But that's about the reading frame after the stop is removed. Alternatively, perhaps the stop isn't removed, so eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, another angle: the vector's design. The ligand is at 5', followed by a stop, then IRES, then receptor, then stop, then eGFP.

If the IRES is after the ligand's stop, then without Cre, the ligand is expressed, but mCherry isn't. The receptor is expressed under the IRES, but eGFP isn't because of the stop.

With Cre, the ligand's stop is removed, so mCherry is expressed in frame. The receptor's stop is lox2272, which Cre can't remove, so eGFP isn't expressed.

So, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is between the receptor and eGFP and it's a lox2272. So, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed.

But the question is why the eGFP isn't expressed. So, the reason is that the stop couldn't be removed because the lox sites are different. But the options don't include that. So, perhaps the issue is more about the expression in the vector.

Wait, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor, so even if the stop is removed, it's not expressed as a fusion. But in that case, the eGFP might be expressed as a separate ORF. Or maybe the eGFP is in a different frame, leading to no expression.

Alternatively, perhaps the frame is correct but the stop isn't removed, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't directly state anything about lox sites. So, perhaps the answer is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, but if they're not in frame, the eGFP would be a separate ORF, or perhaps a nonfunctional protein. But the question says that the vector has the receptor ORF and eGFP in the same construct, with a stop in between. So, if the stop is not removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But if the stop is removed, and the eGFP is in frame, then it would be expressed. If the stop is not removed (as in this case), the eGFP isn't expressed.

So, in the mouse, the SOX10-Cre is supposed to remove the receptor's stop, but it can't because it's a lox2272. Thus, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But looking at the options, none directly address this.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the stop is after the receptor, and the eGFP is under a different promoter. Hmm, no, the eGFP is fused to the receptor.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the eGFP is not being expressed because it's under a different promoter.

Wait, another thought: the ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under the IRES. So, when Cre is present, the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed, and the receptor and eGFP are co-expressed.

But if the stop after the receptor isn't removed (because of the lox2272), the eGFP isn't expressed. So, in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop wasn't removed.

But the options don't directly say that. So, perhaps the answer is option D, but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed in such a way that the eGFP is not in frame, so even if the stop is removed, it doesn't express. But why would the frame be wrong?

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is after the ligand, and the receptor comes after. So, the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed, but if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the problem is about why eGFP isn't expressed. So, the most likely reason is that the stop isn't removed, and thus the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the options don't directly address the stop. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Looking again at the options:

A) ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. That would mean they act on other cells. But why would that prevent eGFP expression? Maybe if the ligand isn't expressed, or the receptor isn't, but in this case, the ligand and receptor are both expressed, but eGFP isn't. So, A isn't directly relevant.

B) The receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. So, the eGFP would be present but not on the surface. If they're using confocal microscopy, maybe they're looking for surface expression, so they don't see it. But in the Western blot, the receptor would be present, but not eGFP. But in the Western blot, the proteins were detected proportionally to actin, so perhaps the eGFP isn't present. So, B could be a reason.

But why would the receptor-eGFP be stuck in the Golgi? The vector seems correctly designed. So, perhaps this is not the issue.

C) The enhancer for ligand and receptor is missing. But the ligand is under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor under IRES would have expression, so maybe the expression is sufficient.

D) Receptor and eGFP not in frame. So, even if the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed correctly. But if the stop is not removed, this wouldn't matter. So, the main issue is that the stop isn't removed, preventing eGFP expression.

But the options don't include the stop cassette issue. So, perhaps the correct answer is D because the eGFP isn't being expressed, perhaps because it's not in frame, or maybe it's a matter of the stop not being removed.

Wait, but in the mice, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed. So, perhaps the issue is that the lox sites are different, making the stop unremovable.

But none of the options mention this. So, perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the vector is constructed, the eGFP is not in frame. So, when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed because the reading frame is wrong.

But how could that happen? The eGFP would be in frame if the stop is removed.

Wait, perhaps the vector was designed with the stop in between, but the eGFP is in a different frame. For example, if the stop is removed, the receptor is in frame with eGFP, but perhaps in the vector, the stop is in a way that when it's removed, the eGFP starts in a different frame. So, the eGFP is not expressed properly.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the fusion is ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP, and the stops are in between. So, without the stops being removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So, the most likely reason is that the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed, which is because the lox sites are different.

But since the options don't directly address this, perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES is not functioning correctly, leading to receptor expression but not eGFP. But the IRES is supposed to drive the receptor expression, and the eGFP would be expressed after the receptor if the stop is removed.

Alternatively, maybe the eGFP is not expressed because the construct wasn't correctly inserted into the genome. But the question says the mice are homozygous for the construct.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If they're not in frame, then when the stop is removed, the eGFP is not expressed as a fusion, but perhaps as a separate ORF. But the vector would need to have the eGFP in frame for it to work. If it's out of frame, the eGFP might not be expressed, leading to no signal.

But in that case, even if the stop is removed (if the loxP is recombined), the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because of the frame. But in the question, the stop after the receptor is lox2272, so it's not recombined. So, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is still there, not because of the frame.

So, perhaps option D isn't the right answer.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the vector uses a stop in between, so when Cre is present, the eGFP is not expressed because the frame is incorrect. But in that case, the stop is removed, but the frame is wrong, so eGFP isn't expressed.

But in this case, the stop isn't removed because of the lox2272. So, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop is present.

But again, the options don't address that. So, perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B. Receptor-eGFP is stuck in the Golgi. So, the eGFP is expressed but not on the cell surface, so the confocal doesn't detect it. But then, in the Western blot, the eGFP would be detected if the antibody is used. But the question says they used antibodies against the overexpressed proteins. So, perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed at all.

So, in the Western blot, the proteins are detected, but eGFP isn't. So, if the eGFP isn't expressed, it's because the stop isn't removed.

But the question says "you use them to test the construct expression on the Western blot after plasmid transfection to primary astrocyte culture." So, the proteins are expressed when the plasmid is transfected. But in the mice, they're not.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is that the vector's design leads to eGFP not being expressed because the frame is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector isn't correctly designed, and the eGFP isn't in frame, which would make it not expressed even if the stop is removed.

But I'm not certain. The options are a bit confusing.

Wait, another point: the vector is a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. So, perhaps without Cre, the stop cassettes remain, so the ligand is expressed (under CBA) but not mCherry, and the receptor is expressed (under IRES) but not eGFP. When Cre is present, the stops are removed. So, the ligand and mCherry are co-expressed, and the receptor and eGFP are co-expressed.

In the mice, the construct is homozygous and crossed with SOX10-Cre. So, Cre is active in neural crest cells, which should recombine the loxP stops. So, the ligand and mCherry are expressed, and the receptor and eGFP are expressed. So, why isn't the eGFP expressed?

But according to the vector setup, the stop for eGFP is lox2272. So, unless the Cre can recognize lox2272, which it can't, the stop remains. So, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But again, the options don't directly address this. So, perhaps the intended answer is D, assuming that the frame is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector's design has the eGFP in a different reading frame, so even if the stop is removed, it's not expressed. But this would be a cloning error.

Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is not correctly cloned, so it's not expressed.

But I'm not sure. Given the options, the most plausible answer based on the vector setup is that the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop wasn't removed due to incompatible lox sites. But since that's not an option, I'm now considering that the correct answer might be D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop isn't removed, leading to no eGFP expression. But since the options don't mention the stop, I'm left to choose the best fit.

Wait, another angle: the vector is a bicistronic construct, and the IRES is after the ligand ORF. So, perhaps the IRES isn't functioning correctly, leading to the receptor not being expressed. But then, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed either.

But the question states that the Western blot shows expression, so the proteins are expressed. So, that can't be it.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Based on the vector setup, the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop isn't removed, which is due to the lox2272 not being recombined by Cre. So, the eGFP isn't expressed, leading to no green signal.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps the intended answer is D. Or perhaps the answer is option C, but I don't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the frame is incorrect, so even if the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, the vector is designed so that the ligand is followed by a stop, which, when removed, allows mCherry to be expressed. Similarly, the receptor is followed by a stop, which, when removed, allows eGFP to be expressed.

If the stop after the receptor is lox2272, Cre can't remove it. So, eGFP isn't expressed. Thus, the reason is that the stop isn't removed because the lox sites are different.

But the answer options don't mention this. So, perhaps the intended answer is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the frame is correct, but the stop wasn't removed, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, perhaps the real reason is option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, leading to the eGFP not being expressed. So, when the stop is removed, the eGFP isn't translated, but that's a frame issue.

But without the stop being removed, the eGFP isn't expressed regardless of the frame.

I think I'm stuck. Given the options, I'll have to make an educated guess.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand-receptor pair, with the ligand ORF under the CBA promoter and the receptor ORF under an IRES element. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP, with stop cassettes (loxP and lox2272) between the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP constructs. The vector is transfected into primary astrocytes, and the Western blot confirms protein expression proportional to actin loading. However, when the construct is bred into mice and crossed with SOX10-Cre hemizygous mice, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Vector Design**:  
   - The ligand is at the 5' end, followed by a loxP-stop-loxP cassette, and the receptor is at the 3' end, followed by a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette.  
   - The ligand is expressed under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is expressed under the IRES element.  
   - Cre recombination removes the stop cassettes, allowing co-expression of ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP.

2. **Cre Activity in Mice**:  
   - SOX10-Cre mice express Cre under the SOX10 promoter, active in neural crest cells.  
   - Cre should recombine loxP sites but cannot recombine lox2272 sites. Thus, the loxP-stop-loxP cassette after the ligand is removed, allowing mCherry expression. However, the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette after the receptor remains intact, preventing eGFP expression.

3. **Observed Outcome**:  
   - In the Western blot, proteins are detected, confirming expression.  
   - In the mice, no green signal (eGFP) is observed under confocal microscopy, indicating that eGFP is not expressed.

4. **Critical Issue**:  
   - The eGFP is not expressed because the lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette is not removed by Cre. This is due to the incompatibility of lox2272 with Cre recombination.  
   - However, none of the answer options explicitly address this issue.

5. **Option Analysis**:  
   - **A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**: This does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.  
   - **B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**: This would result in eGFP being present but not on the cell surface. The absence of eGFP expression altogether suggests this is not the issue.  
   - **C) The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**: The CBA promoter is strong, and the IRES element drives receptor expression. This option is unlikely.  
   - **D) The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**: If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, eGFP would not be expressed even if the stop cassette is removed. However, the primary issue is that the stop cassette is not removed due to the lox2272 site, making this option less likely but the best available explanation.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible explanation, given the answer options, is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, preventing eGFP expression. While the actual issue is the incompatibility of the lox2272 site with Cre recombination, this reasoning aligns most closely with option D.

ANSWER: D
