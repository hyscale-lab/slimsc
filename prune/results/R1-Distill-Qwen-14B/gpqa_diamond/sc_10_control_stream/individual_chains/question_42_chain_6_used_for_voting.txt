Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says there are three planets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variation. But not sure if that method affects the problem here. The question gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The albedos are all the same, 0.3, which is Earth-like, so that probably factors into the equilibrium temperature calculation.

So, the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. That means Planet1's temperature is 1.4 times Planet2's. Wait, wait. Equilibrium temperature usually depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. The formula I remember is something like T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσd²)]^(1/4), where L is star luminosity, a is albedo, and d is distance. So equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star.

Wait, no, actually, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - a) )^0.25, where a is the planet's orbital distance. Alternatively, another way to think about it: T is proportional to (L(1-A))^(1/4) / (distance^(1/2)). So the ratio of temperatures relates to the cube of the distances because of the inverse square law.

Wait, maybe I should write down the formula properly. The equilibrium temperature (T) is given by:

T = [ (L (1 - A)) / (16 π σ d²) ]^(1/4 )

Where:
- L is the star's luminosity
- A is the planet's albedo
- d is the distance from the star
- σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant

So, for two planets, Planet i and j, their temperature ratio T_i / T_j would be:

(T_i / T_j) = [ ( (L_i (1 - A_i)) / d_i² ) / ( (L_j (1 - A_j)) / d_j² ) ]^(1/4 )

But in this problem, all three planets orbit the same star, so L_i = L_j = L. Also, A is the same for all, 0.3. So (1 - A) is same for all. Thus, the ratio simplifies to:

(T_i / T_j) = [ (d_j²) / (d_i²) ]^(1/4 ) = (d_j / d_i )^(1/2 )

So, rearranged, (T_i / T_j) = sqrt( d_j / d_i )

Which means, (d_j / d_i ) = (T_i / T_j )^2

Wait, let me double-check. If T_i = T_p1, T_j = T_p2, then T_p1 / T_p2 = sqrt( d_p2 / d_p1 )

So, d_p2 / d_p1 = (T_p1 / T_p2 )^2

Wait, no, because (T_i / T_j) = sqrt( d_j / d_i )

So, (d_j / d_i) = (T_i / T_j )^2

Yes, that's correct. So the ratio of the distances is the square of the inverse of the temperature ratio.

So, for Planet1 and Planet2: T1 / T2 = 1.4. So d2 / d1 = (T1/T2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96.

Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify:

If T1 is Planet1's temperature and T2 is Planet2's, then the ratio (T1/T2) = sqrt( d2/d1 )

So, d2/d1 = (T1 / T2)^2.

So, T1 is higher than T2, so d2 must be larger than d1. Because if a planet is hotter, it's closer to the star. Wait no: Wait, if a planet is hotter, it's closer. So higher T means smaller distance. So if Planet1 has a higher T than Planet2, then d1 < d2.

Wait, let me think. Let's say two planets around the same star, same albedo. The closer planet will have a higher temperature. So higher T means closer orbit (smaller d). So if T1 is 1.4 times T2, then d1 is smaller than d2.

So, let me compute the distances.

For Planet1 and Planet2: T1 = 1.4 * T2.

So, from the equation:

T1 / T2 = sqrt( d2 / d1 )

So 1.4 = sqrt( d2/d1 )

Square both sides: 1.96 = d2/d1 → d2 = 1.96 * d1.

So Planet2 is 1.96 times farther than Planet1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. So T2 / T3 = 2.3.

So, using the same approach: T2 / T3 = sqrt( d3 / d2 )

→ 2.3 = sqrt( d3 / d2 )

Square: 5.29 = d3/d2 → d3 = 5.29 * d2.

So, putting it all together, how about the distances?

d2 = 1.96 d1

d3 =5.29 d2 → substituting d2 →5.29 * 1.96 d1 = let's compute that.

1.96 *5.29: Hmm, 2 *5.29 is 10.58, subtract 0.04*5.29=0.2116 → 10.58 -0.2116≈10.3684.

So d3 ≈10.3684 d1.

So the distances are:

d1, d2=1.96 d1, d3=10.3684 d1.

Now, the next part is about the orbital periods. The question is, by what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than Planet1.

We need to find P3 / P1.

Kepler's third law says that P² ∝ d³, with the proportionality depending on the mass of the star and gravitational constant. Since all planets are around the same star, the proportionality is the same.

So, P² ∝ d³ → P ∝ d^(3/2).

So, P3 / P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2 )

We have d3/d1 =10.3684.

So, (10.3684)^(3/2) = ?

Let me compute that.

First, sqrt(10.3684) is approx 3.22, because 3.22² is about 10.3684.

Wait, 3.2² is 10.24. 3.22² is (3.2 +0.02)^2= 3.2^2 + 2*3.2*0.02 +0.02^2 =10.24 +0.128 +0.0004=10.3684. Oh, exactly. So sqrt(10.3684)=3.22.

Then, 10.3684^(3/2) is (10.3684)^(1) * (sqrt(10.3684)) ) → 10.3684 * 3.22.

Compute that: 10 *3.22=32.2; 0.3684 *3.22≈1.187 → total approx 32.2 +1.187=33.387.

So P3/P1 ≈ 33.387, which is approximately 33.4.

Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me recheck.

Wait, the steps:

1. For T ratios, Planet1 vs Planet2: 1.4.

T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1) → 1.4 = sqrt(d2/d1) → d2/d1 = (1.4)^2=1.96 → d2=1.96 d1.

2. Planet2 vs Planet3: T2/T3=2.3 → 2.3= sqrt(d3/d2) → d3/d2=5.29 → d3=5.29 d2.

3. So d3=5.29 *1.96 d1 = (5.29 *1.96) d1.

Compute 5.29 *1.96:

Let me compute 5 *1.96 =9.8, 0.29 *1.96=0.5684 → sum is 10.3684.

So d3=10.3684 d1.

4. Using Kepler's law, P^2 ∝ d^3 → P ∝ d^(3/2).

So P3/P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

As 10.3684 is (3.22)^2 → sqrt(10.3684)=3.22.

So (10.3684)^(3/2) = (3.22)^3 → 3.22 *3.22 *3.22.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, (10.3684)^(3/2) is the same as (sqrt(10.3684))³ → (3.22)^3.

Compute 3.22^3.

3.22^2 is 10.3684, as before.

3.22 *10.3684: Let's compute:

3 *10.3684 =31.1052,

0.22 *10.3684 ≈2.280,

Total ≈31.1052 +2.280=33.385.

So that's 33.385, which is about 33.4.

So the factor is approximately 33.4, which matches option D.

Wait, but the question is about the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. So option D is correct.

So the answer should be D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data using the relationships between equilibrium temperature, distance, and orbital period.

### Step 1: Relating Equilibrium Temperatures to Distances
The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:

\[
T \propto \left(\frac{1 - A}{d^2}\right)^{1/4}
\]

where \(A\) is the albedo, and \(d\) is the orbital distance. Since all planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo (\(A = 0.3\)), the ratio of equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_i}{T_j} = \sqrt{\frac{d_j}{d_i}}
\]

Rearranging, the ratio of distances is:

\[
\frac{d_j}{d_i} = \left(\frac{T_i}{T_j}\right)^2
\]

#### For Planet1 and Planet2:
Given \(T_1 / T_2 = 1.4\), we calculate:

\[
\frac{d_2}{d_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
\]

Thus, \(d_2 = 1.96 \cdot d_1\).

#### For Planet2 and Planet3:
Given \(T_2 / T_3 = 2.3\), we calculate:

\[
\frac{d_3}{d_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29
\]

Thus, \(d_3 = 5.29 \cdot d_2\).

Substituting \(d_2 = 1.96 \cdot d_1\) into \(d_3\):

\[
d_3 = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 \cdot d_1 = 10.3684 \cdot d_1
\]

### Step 2: Relating Orbital Periods to Distances
Kepler's third law states:

\[
P^2 \propto d^3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad P \propto d^{3/2}
\]

Thus, the ratio of orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{d_3}{d_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting \(d_3 / d_1 = 10.3684\):

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}
\]

#### Calculating \((10.3684)^{3/2}\):
First, compute \(\sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22\). Then:

\[
(10.3684)^{3/2} = (10.3684) \cdot (3.22) = 33.385
\]

Thus, \(P_3 / P_1 \approx 33.4\).

### Final Answer:
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately **33.4 times larger** than that of Planet1.

Okay, so I've got this question about exoplanets and their orbital periods. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says there are three planets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variation. But not sure if that method affects the problem here. The question gives me the ratios of their equilibrium temperatures and masses. The albedos are all the same, 0.3, which is Earth-like, so that probably factors into the equilibrium temperature calculation.

So, the equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. That means Planet1's temperature is 1.4 times Planet2's. Wait, wait. Equilibrium temperature usually depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance. The formula I remember is something like T = [(L(1 - a))/(16πσd²)]^(1/4), where L is star luminosity, a is albedo, and d is distance. So equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star.

Wait, no, actually, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - a) )^0.25, where a is the planet's orbital distance. Alternatively, another way to think about it: T is proportional to (L(1-A))^(1/4) / (distance^(1/2)). So the ratio of temperatures relates to the cube of the distances because of the inverse square law.

Wait, maybe I should write down the formula properly. The equilibrium temperature (T) is given by:

T = [ (L (1 - A)) / (16 π σ d²) ]^(1/4 )

Where:
- L is the star's luminosity
- A is the planet's albedo
- d is the distance from the star
- σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant

So, for two planets, Planet i and j, their temperature ratio T_i / T_j would be:

(T_i / T_j) = [ ( (L_i (1 - A_i)) / d_i² ) / ( (L_j (1 - A_j)) / d_j² ) ]^(1/4 )

But in this problem, all three planets orbit the same star, so L_i = L_j = L. Also, A is the same for all, 0.3. So (1 - A) is same for all. Thus, the ratio simplifies to:

(T_i / T_j) = [ (d_j²) / (d_i²) ]^(1/4 ) = (d_j / d_i )^(1/2 )

So, rearranged, (T_i / T_j) = sqrt( d_j / d_i )

Which means, (d_j / d_i ) = (T_i / T_j )^2

Wait, let me double-check. If T_i = T_p1, T_j = T_p2, then T_p1 / T_p2 = sqrt( d_p2 / d_p1 )

So, d_p2 / d_p1 = (T_p1 / T_p2 )^2

Wait, no, because (T_i / T_j) = sqrt( d_j / d_i )

So, (d_j / d_i) = (T_i / T_j )^2

Yes, that's correct. So the ratio of the distances is the square of the inverse of the temperature ratio.

So, for Planet1 and Planet2: T1 / T2 = 1.4. So d2 / d1 = (T1/T2)^2 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96.

Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify:

If T1 is Planet1's temperature and T2 is Planet2's, then the ratio (T1/T2) = sqrt( d2/d1 )

So, d2/d1 = (T1 / T2)^2.

So, T1 is higher than T2, so d2 must be larger than d1. Because if a planet is hotter, it's closer to the star. Wait no: Wait, if a planet is hotter, it's closer. So higher T means smaller distance. So if Planet1 has a higher T than Planet2, then d1 < d2.

Wait, let me think. Let's say two planets around the same star, same albedo. The closer planet will have a higher temperature. So higher T means closer orbit (smaller d). So if T1 is 1.4 times T2, then d1 is smaller than d2.

So, let me compute the distances.

For Planet1 and Planet2: T1 = 1.4 * T2.

So, from the equation:

T1 / T2 = sqrt( d2 / d1 )

So 1.4 = sqrt( d2/d1 )

Square both sides: 1.96 = d2/d1 → d2 = 1.96 * d1.

So Planet2 is 1.96 times farther than Planet1.

Similarly, the ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. So T2 / T3 = 2.3.

So, using the same approach: T2 / T3 = sqrt( d3 / d2 )

→ 2.3 = sqrt( d3 / d2 )

Square: 5.29 = d3/d2 → d3 = 5.29 * d2.

So, putting it all together, how about the distances?

d2 = 1.96 d1

d3 =5.29 d2 → substituting d2 →5.29 * 1.96 d1 = let's compute that.

1.96 *5.29: Hmm, 2 *5.29 is 10.58, subtract 0.04*5.29=0.2116 → 10.58 -0.2116≈10.3684.

So d3 ≈10.3684 d1.

So the distances are:

d1, d2=1.96 d1, d3=10.3684 d1.

Now, the next part is about the orbital periods. The question is, by what factor is the orbital period of Planet3 larger than Planet1.

We need to find P3 / P1.

Kepler's third law says that P² ∝ d³, with the proportionality depending on the mass of the star and gravitational constant. Since all planets are around the same star, the proportionality is the same.

So, P² ∝ d³ → P ∝ d^(3/2).

So, P3 / P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2 )

We have d3/d1 =10.3684.

So, (10.3684)^(3/2) = ?

Let me compute that.

First, sqrt(10.3684) is approx 3.22, because 3.22² is about 10.3684.

Wait, 3.2² is 10.24. 3.22² is (3.2 +0.02)^2= 3.2^2 + 2*3.2*0.02 +0.02^2 =10.24 +0.128 +0.0004=10.3684. Oh, exactly. So sqrt(10.3684)=3.22.

Then, 10.3684^(3/2) is (10.3684)^(1) * (sqrt(10.3684)) ) → 10.3684 * 3.22.

Compute that: 10 *3.22=32.2; 0.3684 *3.22≈1.187 → total approx 32.2 +1.187=33.387.

So P3/P1 ≈ 33.387, which is approximately 33.4.

Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me recheck.

Wait, the steps:

1. For T ratios, Planet1 vs Planet2: 1.4.

T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1) → 1.4 = sqrt(d2/d1) → d2/d1 = (1.4)^2=1.96 → d2=1.96 d1.

2. Planet2 vs Planet3: T2/T3=2.3 → 2.3= sqrt(d3/d2) → d3/d2=5.29 → d3=5.29 d2.

3. So d3=5.29 *1.96 d1 = (5.29 *1.96) d1.

Compute 5.29 *1.96:

Let me compute 5 *1.96 =9.8, 0.29 *1.96=0.5684 → sum is 10.3684.

So d3=10.3684 d1.

4. Using Kepler's law, P^2 ∝ d^3 → P ∝ d^(3/2).

So P3/P1 = (d3/d1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2).

As 10.3684 is (3.22)^2 → sqrt(10.3684)=3.22.

So (10.3684)^(3/2) = (3.22)^3 → 3.22 *3.22 *3.22.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, (10.3684)^(3/2) is the same as (sqrt(10.3684))³ → (3.22)^3.

Compute 3.22^3.

3.22^2 is 10.3684, as before.

3.22 *10.3684: Let's compute:

3 *10.3684 =31.1052,

0.22 *10.3684 ≈2.280,

Total ≈31.1052 +2.280=33.385.

So that's 33.385, which is about 33.4.

So the factor is approximately 33.4, which matches option D.

Wait, but the question is about the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than Planet1. So option D is correct.

So the answer should be D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data using the relationships between equilibrium temperature, distance, and orbital period.

### Step 1: Relating Equilibrium Temperatures to Distances
The equilibrium temperature of a planet is given by:

\[
T \propto \left(\frac{1 - A}{d^2}\right)^{1/4}
\]

where \(A\) is the albedo, and \(d\) is the orbital distance. Since all planets orbit the same star and have the same albedo (\(A = 0.3\)), the ratio of equilibrium temperatures simplifies to:

\[
\frac{T_i}{T_j} = \sqrt{\frac{d_j}{d_i}}
\]

Rearranging, the ratio of distances is:

\[
\frac{d_j}{d_i} = \left(\frac{T_i}{T_j}\right)^2
\]

#### For Planet1 and Planet2:
Given \(T_1 / T_2 = 1.4\), we calculate:

\[
\frac{d_2}{d_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96
\]

Thus, \(d_2 = 1.96 \cdot d_1\).

#### For Planet2 and Planet3:
Given \(T_2 / T_3 = 2.3\), we calculate:

\[
\frac{d_3}{d_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29
\]

Thus, \(d_3 = 5.29 \cdot d_2\).

Substituting \(d_2 = 1.96 \cdot d_1\) into \(d_3\):

\[
d_3 = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 \cdot d_1 = 10.3684 \cdot d_1
\]

### Step 2: Relating Orbital Periods to Distances
Kepler's third law states:

\[
P^2 \propto d^3 \quad \Rightarrow \quad P \propto d^{3/2}
\]

Thus, the ratio of orbital periods is:

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = \left(\frac{d_3}{d_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting \(d_3 / d_1 = 10.3684\):

\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}
\]

#### Calculating \((10.3684)^{3/2}\):
First, compute \(\sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22\). Then:

\[
(10.3684)^{3/2} = (10.3684) \cdot (3.22) = 33.385
\]

Thus, \(P_3 / P_1 \approx 33.4\).

### Final Answer:
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately **33.4 times larger** than that of Planet1.

**Answer: D**
