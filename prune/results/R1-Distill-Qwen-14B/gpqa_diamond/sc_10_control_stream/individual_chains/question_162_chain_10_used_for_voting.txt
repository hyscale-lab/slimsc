Okay, so I have this metric given, and I need to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

The metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a 2-dimensional metric, right? Because it has dx and dy terms. So it's probably describing some kind of surface, maybe a 2D manifold embedded in higher dimensions, but perhaps it's a flat or curved space.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere... oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, in two dimensions, a pseudosphere is like a hyperbolic plane. But in this case, maybe it's a 2D surface with a specific metric.

Wait, the options mention an area that depends on x² + y² or x² - y². But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, radius in the pseudosphere context is a bit different. For a pseudosphere, the radius (or curvature radius) is related to the curvature. The Gaussian curvature K is -1/R², where R is the radius of curvature. So for a pseudosphere with R=2, K would be -1/(2)^2 = -1/4.

But I'm not sure how that ties into the metric here. Let's examine the given metric. The coefficient is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let me see if I can write this in a more familiar form.

Alternatively, perhaps this metric is a conformal metric, meaning it's a scaling of the Euclidean metric. Because the ds² is expressed as a function multiplied by (dx² + dy²). So this is a conformal metric, written as ds² = E² (dx² + dy²), where E is the conformal factor here. So E² = 32/(4 - x² - y²), so E = sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)).

Now, the area of a surface described by a metric in 2D is given by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor over the surface. But wait, for a 2D metric, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. The metric tensor g here is diagonal, with g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and the off-diagonal terms zero. So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2. Taking the square root gives 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element becomes (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

Wait, but wait, the surface described by this metric is only valid where 4 - x² - y² is positive, right? Because otherwise the denominator would be zero or negative, which would make the metric undefined or imaginary. So the domain of this metric is x² + y² < 4. That's a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So the surface is defined on a disk of radius 2, which aligns with the radius r=2 of the pseudosphere.

But wait, the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. So does this metric represent such a surface? Let me think about the Gaussian curvature for a conformal metric. The formula for Gaussian curvature K of a conformal metric ds² = e^{2λ} (dx² + dy²) is K = - (1/2) e^{-2λ} ( (Δ λ) ), where Δ is the Laplacian in flat space. Alternatively, another formula I remember is K = - (1/(2 e^{2λ})) * (e^{2λ})'''' or something like that. Wait, perhaps another approach: for a conformal metric, the Gaussian curvature can be found using the formula:

K = - (1/(2)) * ( (e^{2λ})_{xx} + (e^{2λ})_{yy} ) / e^{2λ} )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the Gaussian curvature using the formula for a metric in 2D. For the metric ds² = g_{rr} dr² + g_{θθ} dθ² + 2 g_{rθ} dr dθ, the Gaussian curvature is given by (1/(2√(det g))) [ (∂(√det g)/∂r)_θ - ... ] or something like that. But perhaps that's getting too complicated. 

Wait, maybe I should compute the Gaussian curvature using the metric given. Let's see, the metric is diagonal with g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let me compute the Gaussian curvature for this metric. I recall that for a metric ds² = E^2(dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = - (1/(2 E^2)) [ (E^2)_{xx} + (E^2)_{yy} ) ] 

Wait, that might be. So let's compute that. Let me see: E² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) =32/(4 - r^2), where r² = x² + y². So E^2 =32/(4 - r²).

So, (E^2)_x = (32/(4 - r²))_x. Let me compute the partial derivatives. Let me denote r² = x² + y², so for (E^2)_x, we have:

(E^2)_x = (32/(4 - r²))_x = (32) * d/dx (1/(4 - r²)) ) = 32 * ( (0 + (2x)/(4 - r^2)^2 )) = 64 x/(4 - r^2)^2.

Similarly, (E^2)_y = 64 y/(4 - r^2)^2.

Wait, but wait, (E^2)_{xx} is the second derivative. Let me compute it:

First, (E^2)_x = 64 x/(4 - r²)^2.

Now, (E^2)_{xx} is the derivative of (E^2)_x with respect to x. So:

d/dx [64 x/(4 - r²)^2 ] = 64 [ ( (4 - r²)^2 * 1 + x * 2(4 - r²)(-2x) ) ] / (4 - r²)^4 )

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me compute it more carefully.

Let me compute (E^2)_{xx}:

(E^2)_{xx} = d/dx [ (E^2)_x ] = d/dx [ 64 x (4 - r²)^{-2} ]

Using the product rule: 

= 64*(4 - r^2)^{-2} + 64 x * d/dx ( (4 - r²)^{-2} )

The derivative of (4 - r²)^{-2} with respect to x is (-2) * (4 - r^2)^{-3} * ( -2x ), because d(r²)/dx = 2x.

So,

= 64/( (4 - r²)^2 ) + 64 x * [ (-2) * (-2x) ) / (4 - r²)^3 ) ]

Simplify:

= 64/( (4 - r²)^2 ) + 64 x * (4x) )/(4 - r²)^3 )

= 64/( (4 - r²)^2 ) + 256 x²/(4 - r²)^3 )

Similarly, (E^2)_{yy} would have the same form, replacing x with y and x² with y².

Wait, but when I compute (E^2)_{yy}, let's see:

(E^2)_y = 64 y/(4 - r^2)^2.

d/dy [ (E^2)_y ] = 64/( (4 - r^2)^2 ) + 64 y * (4y)/(4 - r^2)^3 )

= 64/( (4 - r^2)^2 ) + 256 y²/(4 - r^2)^3 )

Now, sum (E^2)_{xx} + (E^2)_{yy}:

= [64/( (4 - r²)^2 ) + 256 x²/(4 - r²)^3 ) ] + [64/( (4 - r²)^2 ) + 256 y²/(4 - r²)^3 ) ]

= 128/( (4 - r²)^2 ) + 256 (x² + y²)/(4 - r²)^3 )

But x² + y² = r², so:

= 128/( (4 - r^2)^2 ) + 256 r²/(4 - r^2)^3 )

So, putting it all together, the Gaussian curvature K is:

K = - (1/(2 E^2 )) * [ (E^2)_{xx} + (E^2)_{yy} ) ]

E^2 = 32/(4 - r²), so 1/(2 E^2) = (4 - r²)/(64).

So,

K = - [ (4 - r²)/(64) ) * ( 128/( (4 - r²)^2 ) + 256 r²/(4 - r²)^3 ) ) ]

Simplify each term:

First term inside the brackets: 128/( (4 - r²)^2 ) multiplied by (4 - r²)/(64) gives 128 * (4 - r²) / [ (4 - r²)^2 * 64 ) ] = (128)/(64 (4 - r²)) ) = 2/(4 - r²).

Second term: 256 r²/(4 - r²)^3 multiplied by (4 - r²)/(64) gives (256 r² (4 - r²) ) / ( (4 - r²)^3 * 64 ) ) = (256 r² )/(64 (4 - r²)^2 ) ) = 4 r²/( (4 - r²)^2 )

So,

K = - [ (2/(4 - r²)) + (4 r²)/( (4 - r²)^2 ) ) ]

Let me combine these terms:

= - [ (2 (4 - r²) + 4 r² ) / (4 - r²)^2 ) ]

Expanding numerator: 8 - 2 r² + 4 r² =8 +2 r².

So,

K = - [ (8 + 2 r²) / (4 - r²)^2 ) ]

Factor numerator: 2(4 + r²) → No, wait, 8 +2r² is 2*(4 + r²). Wait, 8 is 2*4, so 8 +2r² = 2(4 + r²). Hmm, but wait, 8 + 2r² is 2*(4 + r²) - wait, 4 + r² is r² +4, which is correct.

So,

K = - [ 2(4 + r²) ) / (4 - r²)^2 ) ]

Wait, but 4 + r² is (r² +4), and denominator is (4 - r²)^2.

Hmm, is this matching the expected Gaussian curvature for a pseudosphere?

Wait, a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature. So K should be a negative constant. But here, K depends on r, which suggests it's varying, which contradicts the pseudosphere's constant curvature.

Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for the Gaussian curvature. Let me double-check the formula for K for a conformal metric.

Wait, another approach: for a conformal metric, K can be computed using the formula:

K = - (1/(2 e^{2λ})) [ (e^{2λ})_{xx} + (e^{2λ})_{yy} ] 

Wait, no, maybe it's:

K = - (1/(2 e^{2λ})) [ (e^{2λ})_{xx} + (e^{2λ})_{yy} - (e^{2λ})_{xy} * 2 ] 

But in our case, the metric is diagonal, so the off-diagonal terms are zero, so (e^{2λ})_{xy} is zero. So perhaps the correct formula is:

K = - (1/(2 e^{2λ})) ( (e^{2λ})_{xx} + (e^{2λ})_{yy} )

Which is what I used earlier.

Wait, but perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me recompute (E²)_{xx} and (E²)_{yy}.

Hmm, perhaps I should try a different approach. Let me consider that the metric is given in polar coordinates, where x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So, maybe it's better to express the metric in terms of r and θ.

The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ² ). So, in polar coordinates, it's ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) dr² + (32 r²/(4 - r²)) dθ².

Now, the Gaussian curvature for a metric in polar coordinates (r,θ) is given by:

K = - [ (1/(2 r)) * ( (g_{rr})_{θ} - (g_{θθ})_r ) ) ]

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

K = - (1/(2 r)) [ ∂(sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ}) ) / ∂r + ∂(sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ}) ) / ∂θ ) ]

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of another formula. For a metric g_{rr} dr² + g_{θθ} dθ², the Gaussian curvature is:

K = - (1/(2 sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ}))) [ (g_{θθ})_r - (g_{rr})_θ ]

But since the metric is independent of θ, the partial derivatives with respect to θ of g_{rr} and g_{θθ} would be zero? No, wait, the partial derivative in the metric may not be zero because g_{rr} and g_{θθ} depend on r, but not θ.

Wait, let me try to use the formula for Gaussian curvature in polar coordinates which is:

K = - (1/(2 r)) [ (g_{rr})_θ - (g_{θθ})_r ) ]

But in our case, the metric is independent of θ, so (g_{rr})_θ = 0 and (g_{θθ})_r is derivative of g_{θθ} with respect to r.

So,

K = - (1/(2 r)) [ 0 - (d g_{θθ}/ dr) ]

= (1/(2 r)) (d g_{θθ}/ dr )

But let me compute this.

In our metric, g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r²), and g_{θθ} = 32 r²/(4 - r²).

So,

d(g_{θθ})/dr = d/dr [32 r²/(4 - r²) ]

= 32 [ (2 r (4 - r²) ) + r^2 (2 r) ) ] / (4 - r²)^2 

Wait, applying the quotient rule: d/dr [N/D] = (N’ D - N D’ ) / D².

Here, N =32 r², D=4 -r².

So,

dN/dr = 64 r.

dD/dr = -2r.

Thus,

d(g_{θθ})/dr = [64 r (4 - r^2) - (32 r^2)(-2 r) ] / (4 - r^2)^2.

= [64 r (4 - r²) + 64 r^3 ] / (4 - r^2)^2.

Expanding numerator:

64 r (4 - r²) = 256 r - 64 r^3.

Adding 64 r^3: 256 r.

So,

d(g_{θθ})/dr = 256 r / (4 - r^2)^2.

Thus,

K = (1/(2 r)) * (256 r )/(4 - r^2)^2 )

Simplify:

= (256 r ) / [ 2 r (4 - r^2)^2 ) ]

= 128 / (4 - r^2)^2.

Wait, so K = 128 / (4 - r^2)^2. 

Wait, that's positive. But a pseudosphere has negative curvature. Hmm, that's a problem. Because I'm getting K positive here, which would imply a sphere, not a pseudosphere. So that suggests that either I made a mistake in the calculation or perhaps the given metric isn't of constant curvature.

Wait, but the question states that the pseudosphere has radius r=2. Let me see what K would be at r approaching 2 from below.

At r approaching 2, 4 - r² approaches 0, so K approaches positive infinity. Which can't be right for a pseudosphere. So this metric doesn't represent a pseudosphere. But then why is the question asking about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2?

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is an approximation, or maybe it's a different space. Alternatively, perhaps the area can be calculated without knowing the exact curvature.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So regardless of the metric, what's the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2? Wait, but pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a sphere is infinite, right? Because the hyperbolic plane is unbounded, so any sphere would encompass an infinite area.

Wait, but a pseudosphere, or a hyperbolic sphere, has an infinite area. Because in hyperbolic space, as you move away from a point, the area grows exponentially, so a sphere of finite radius would still enclose an infinite area.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is calculated using the given metric. Let me think about that.

Wait, the area computed using the metric would be the integral of sqrt(det g) over the domain. The determinant of the metric is (32/(4 - r^2))², so sqrt(det g) is 32/(4 - r²).

So the area would be the integral over x and y where x² + y² <4 of (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy.

Changing to polar coordinates, it becomes:

Integral from r=0 to 2, θ=0 to 2π of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So, Area = ∫ (from 0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

The θ integral is 2π. So,

Area = 2π * [32 ∫ (0 to 2) r/(4 - r²) dr ]

Let me compute that integral.

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → - (du)/2 = r dr.

So,

∫ r/(4 - r²) dr = ∫ (1/u) * (-du/2) )= (-1/2) ln |u| + C = (-1/2) ln(4 - r²) + C.

Evaluated from 0 to 2:

At r=2: u=0 → ln(0) is -infinite. Hmm, but that's a problem. Let's see:

At r approaches 2 from below, ln(4 - r^2) approaches ln(0) which is -infinity. So the integral becomes ( -1/2 ) [ ln( (4 - (2)^2) ) - ln(4 - 0) ) ] → ( -1/2 ) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ) ]

Which is ( -1/2 ) [ -inf - ln4 ] → (inf + (ln4)/2 ) → infinity.

So the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite. So the area of the surface described by this metric is infinite.

But wait, the metric is defined on a disk of radius 2, but the area under this metric is infinite. So the given metric's area is infinite, which would correspond to option D, which is +infty.

But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So, in the case of a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature, the area is indeed infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C)4π(x² – y²)

D) +infty

So the correct answer is D.

The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right),
\]

which describes a 2D surface. This is a conformal metric, meaning it scales the Euclidean metric by a factor of \( E^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The domain of the metric is restricted to \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane.

The area of a surface described by a metric is computed by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor over the domain. For this metric, the determinant is \( \text{det}(g) = \left( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \right)^2 \), so the square root of the determinant is \( \sqrt{\text{det}(g)} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \) evaluates to \( 2\pi \), so the area simplifies to:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot 32 \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To compute the radial integral \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \), use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \). This gives:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \left[ \ln|u| \right]_4^0.
\]

As \( u \to 0 \), \( \ln|u| \to -\infty \), so the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). This means the area of the surface described by the metric is infinite.

The question asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a sphere (or pseudosphere) is infinite. Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is also infinite.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) 0**: Incorrect. The area is not zero; it is infinite.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect. The area does not depend on \( x \) and \( y \) explicitly; it is a global property of the surface.
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect. Similar to option B, the area is not a function of \( x \) and \( y \).
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct. The area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.

ANSWER: D

Okay, so I have this metric given, and I need to find the area of a pseudosphere with radius r=2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my differential geometry, but let me try to think this through.

The metric provided is ds² = (32)/(4 - x² - y²) (dx² + dy²). Wait, so this is a 2-dimensional metric, right? Because it has dx and dy terms. So it's probably describing some kind of surface, maybe a 2D manifold embedded in higher dimensions, but perhaps it's a flat or curved space.

Wait, the question is about a pseudosphere. Pseudosphere... oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. But wait, in two dimensions, a pseudosphere is like a hyperbolic plane. But in this case, maybe it's a 2D surface with a specific metric.

Wait, the options mention an area that depends on x² + y² or x² - y². But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. Oh wait, radius in the pseudosphere context is a bit different. For a pseudosphere, the radius (or curvature radius) is related to the curvature. The Gaussian curvature K is -1/R², where R is the radius of curvature. So for a pseudosphere with R=2, K would be -1/(2)^2 = -1/4.

But I'm not sure how that ties into the metric here. Let's examine the given metric. The coefficient is 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let me see if I can write this in a more familiar form.

Alternatively, perhaps this metric is a conformal metric, meaning it's a scaling of the Euclidean metric. Because the ds² is expressed as a function multiplied by (dx² + dy²). So this is a conformal metric, written as ds² = E² (dx² + dy²), where E is the conformal factor here. So E² = 32/(4 - x² - y²), so E = sqrt(32/(4 - x² - y²)).

Now, the area of a surface described by a metric in 2D is given by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor over the surface. But wait, for a 2D metric, the area element is sqrt(det g) dx dy. The metric tensor g here is diagonal, with g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²), and the off-diagonal terms zero. So the determinant is (32/(4 - x² - y²))^2. Taking the square root gives 32/(4 - x² - y²). So the area element becomes (32)/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy.

Wait, but wait, the surface described by this metric is only valid where 4 - x² - y² is positive, right? Because otherwise the denominator would be zero or negative, which would make the metric undefined or imaginary. So the domain of this metric is x² + y² < 4. That's a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. So the surface is defined on a disk of radius 2, which aligns with the radius r=2 of the pseudosphere.

But wait, the pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature. So does this metric represent such a surface? Let me think about the Gaussian curvature for a conformal metric. The formula for Gaussian curvature K of a conformal metric ds² = e^{2λ} (dx² + dy²) is K = - (1/2) e^{-2λ} ( (Δ λ) ), where Δ is the Laplacian in flat space. Alternatively, another formula I remember is K = - (1/(2 e^{2λ})) * (e^{2λ})'''' or something like that. Wait, perhaps another approach: for a conformal metric, the Gaussian curvature can be found using the formula:

K = - (1/(2)) * ( (e^{2λ})_{xx} + (e^{2λ})_{yy} ) / e^{2λ} )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the Gaussian curvature using the formula for a metric in 2D. For the metric ds² = g_{rr} dr² + g_{θθ} dθ² + 2 g_{rθ} dr dθ, the Gaussian curvature is given by (1/(2√(det g))) [ (∂(√det g)/∂r)_θ - ... ] or something like that. But perhaps that's getting too complicated. 

Wait, maybe I should compute the Gaussian curvature using the metric given. Let's see, the metric is diagonal with g_xx = g_yy = 32/(4 - x² - y²). Let me compute the Gaussian curvature for this metric. I recall that for a metric ds² = E^2(dx² + dy²), the Gaussian curvature K is given by:

K = - (1/(2 E^2)) [ (E^2)_{xx} + (E^2)_{yy} ) ] 

Wait, that might be. So let's compute that. Let me see: E² = 32/(4 - x² - y²) =32/(4 - r^2), where r² = x² + y². So E^2 =32/(4 - r²).

So, (E^2)_x = (32/(4 - r²))_x. Let me compute the partial derivatives. Let me denote r² = x² + y², so for (E^2)_x, we have:

(E^2)_x = (32/(4 - r²))_x = (32) * d/dx (1/(4 - r²)) ) = 32 * ( (0 + (2x)/(4 - r^2)^2 )) = 64 x/(4 - r^2)^2.

Similarly, (E^2)_y = 64 y/(4 - r^2)^2.

Wait, but wait, (E^2)_{xx} is the second derivative. Let me compute it:

First, (E^2)_x = 64 x/(4 - r²)^2.

Now, (E^2)_{xx} is the derivative of (E^2)_x with respect to x. So:

d/dx [64 x/(4 - r²)^2 ] = 64 [ ( (4 - r²)^2 * 1 + x * 2(4 - r²)(-2x) ) ] / (4 - r²)^4 )

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me compute it more carefully.

Let me compute (E^2)_{xx}:

(E^2)_{xx} = d/dx [ (E^2)_x ] = d/dx [ 64 x (4 - r²)^{-2} ]

Using the product rule: 

= 64*(4 - r^2)^{-2} + 64 x * d/dx ( (4 - r²)^{-2} )

The derivative of (4 - r²)^{-2} with respect to x is (-2) * (4 - r^2)^{-3} * ( -2x ), because d(r²)/dx = 2x.

So,

= 64/( (4 - r²)^2 ) + 64 x * [ (-2) * (-2x) ) / (4 - r²)^3 ) ]

Simplify:

= 64/( (4 - r²)^2 ) + 64 x * (4x) )/(4 - r²)^3 )

= 64/( (4 - r²)^2 ) + 256 x²/(4 - r²)^3 )

Similarly, (E^2)_{yy} would have the same form, replacing x with y and x² with y².

Wait, but when I compute (E^2)_{yy}, let's see:

(E^2)_y = 64 y/(4 - r^2)^2.

d/dy [ (E^2)_y ] = 64/( (4 - r^2)^2 ) + 64 y * (4y)/(4 - r^2)^3 )

= 64/( (4 - r^2)^2 ) + 256 y²/(4 - r^2)^3 )

Now, sum (E^2)_{xx} + (E^2)_{yy}:

= [64/( (4 - r²)^2 ) + 256 x²/(4 - r²)^3 ) ] + [64/( (4 - r²)^2 ) + 256 y²/(4 - r²)^3 ) ]

= 128/( (4 - r²)^2 ) + 256 (x² + y²)/(4 - r²)^3 )

But x² + y² = r², so:

= 128/( (4 - r^2)^2 ) + 256 r²/(4 - r^2)^3 )

So, putting it all together, the Gaussian curvature K is:

K = - (1/(2 E^2 )) * [ (E^2)_{xx} + (E^2)_{yy} ) ]

E^2 = 32/(4 - r²), so 1/(2 E^2) = (4 - r²)/(64).

So,

K = - [ (4 - r²)/(64) ) * ( 128/( (4 - r²)^2 ) + 256 r²/(4 - r²)^3 ) ) ]

Simplify each term:

First term inside the brackets: 128/( (4 - r²)^2 ) multiplied by (4 - r²)/(64) gives 128 * (4 - r²) / [ (4 - r²)^2 * 64 ) ] = (128)/(64 (4 - r²)) ) = 2/(4 - r²).

Second term: 256 r²/(4 - r²)^3 multiplied by (4 - r²)/(64) gives (256 r² (4 - r²) ) / ( (4 - r²)^3 * 64 ) ) = (256 r² )/(64 (4 - r²)^2 ) ) = 4 r²/( (4 - r²)^2 )

So,

K = - [ (2/(4 - r²)) + (4 r²)/( (4 - r²)^2 ) ) ]

Let me combine these terms:

= - [ (2 (4 - r²) + 4 r² ) / (4 - r²)^2 ) ]

Expanding numerator: 8 - 2 r² + 4 r² =8 +2 r².

So,

K = - [ (8 + 2 r²) / (4 - r²)^2 ) ]

Factor numerator: 2(4 + r²) → No, wait, 8 +2r² is 2*(4 + r²). Wait, 8 is 2*4, so 8 +2r² = 2(4 + r²). Hmm, but wait, 8 + 2r² is 2*(4 + r²) - wait, 4 + r² is r² +4, which is correct.

So,

K = - [ 2(4 + r²) ) / (4 - r²)^2 ) ]

Wait, but 4 + r² is (r² +4), and denominator is (4 - r²)^2.

Hmm, is this matching the expected Gaussian curvature for a pseudosphere?

Wait, a pseudosphere has constant negative curvature. So K should be a negative constant. But here, K depends on r, which suggests it's varying, which contradicts the pseudosphere's constant curvature.

Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for the Gaussian curvature. Let me double-check the formula for K for a conformal metric.

Wait, another approach: for a conformal metric, K can be computed using the formula:

K = - (1/(2 e^{2λ})) [ (e^{2λ})_{xx} + (e^{2λ})_{yy} ] 

Wait, no, maybe it's:

K = - (1/(2 e^{2λ})) [ (e^{2λ})_{xx} + (e^{2λ})_{yy} - (e^{2λ})_{xy} * 2 ] 

But in our case, the metric is diagonal, so the off-diagonal terms are zero, so (e^{2λ})_{xy} is zero. So perhaps the correct formula is:

K = - (1/(2 e^{2λ})) ( (e^{2λ})_{xx} + (e^{2λ})_{yy} )

Which is what I used earlier.

Wait, but perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me recompute (E²)_{xx} and (E²)_{yy}.

Hmm, perhaps I should try a different approach. Let me consider that the metric is given in polar coordinates, where x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ. So, maybe it's better to express the metric in terms of r and θ.

The given metric is ds² = [32/(4 - r²)] (dr² + r² dθ² ). So, in polar coordinates, it's ds² = (32/(4 - r²)) dr² + (32 r²/(4 - r²)) dθ².

Now, the Gaussian curvature for a metric in polar coordinates (r,θ) is given by:

K = - [ (1/(2 r)) * ( (g_{rr})_{θ} - (g_{θθ})_r ) ) ]

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

K = - (1/(2 r)) [ ∂(sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ}) ) / ∂r + ∂(sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ}) ) / ∂θ ) ]

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of another formula. For a metric g_{rr} dr² + g_{θθ} dθ², the Gaussian curvature is:

K = - (1/(2 sqrt(g_{rr} g_{θθ}))) [ (g_{θθ})_r - (g_{rr})_θ ]

But since the metric is independent of θ, the partial derivatives with respect to θ of g_{rr} and g_{θθ} would be zero? No, wait, the partial derivative in the metric may not be zero because g_{rr} and g_{θθ} depend on r, but not θ.

Wait, let me try to use the formula for Gaussian curvature in polar coordinates which is:

K = - (1/(2 r)) [ (g_{rr})_θ - (g_{θθ})_r ) ]

But in our case, the metric is independent of θ, so (g_{rr})_θ = 0 and (g_{θθ})_r is derivative of g_{θθ} with respect to r.

So,

K = - (1/(2 r)) [ 0 - (d g_{θθ}/ dr) ]

= (1/(2 r)) (d g_{θθ}/ dr )

But let me compute this.

In our metric, g_{rr} = 32/(4 - r²), and g_{θθ} = 32 r²/(4 - r²).

So,

d(g_{θθ})/dr = d/dr [32 r²/(4 - r²) ]

= 32 [ (2 r (4 - r²) ) + r^2 (2 r) ) ] / (4 - r²)^2 

Wait, applying the quotient rule: d/dr [N/D] = (N’ D - N D’ ) / D².

Here, N =32 r², D=4 -r².

So,

dN/dr = 64 r.

dD/dr = -2r.

Thus,

d(g_{θθ})/dr = [64 r (4 - r^2) - (32 r^2)(-2 r) ] / (4 - r^2)^2.

= [64 r (4 - r²) + 64 r^3 ] / (4 - r^2)^2.

Expanding numerator:

64 r (4 - r²) = 256 r - 64 r^3.

Adding 64 r^3: 256 r.

So,

d(g_{θθ})/dr = 256 r / (4 - r^2)^2.

Thus,

K = (1/(2 r)) * (256 r )/(4 - r^2)^2 )

Simplify:

= (256 r ) / [ 2 r (4 - r^2)^2 ) ]

= 128 / (4 - r^2)^2.

Wait, so K = 128 / (4 - r^2)^2. 

Wait, that's positive. But a pseudosphere has negative curvature. Hmm, that's a problem. Because I'm getting K positive here, which would imply a sphere, not a pseudosphere. So that suggests that either I made a mistake in the calculation or perhaps the given metric isn't of constant curvature.

Wait, but the question states that the pseudosphere has radius r=2. Let me see what K would be at r approaching 2 from below.

At r approaching 2, 4 - r² approaches 0, so K approaches positive infinity. Which can't be right for a pseudosphere. So this metric doesn't represent a pseudosphere. But then why is the question asking about the area of a pseudosphere of radius 2?

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Alternatively, perhaps the metric given is an approximation, or maybe it's a different space. Alternatively, perhaps the area can be calculated without knowing the exact curvature.

Wait, the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So regardless of the metric, what's the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2? Wait, but pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a sphere is infinite, right? Because the hyperbolic plane is unbounded, so any sphere would encompass an infinite area.

Wait, but a pseudosphere, or a hyperbolic sphere, has an infinite area. Because in hyperbolic space, as you move away from a point, the area grows exponentially, so a sphere of finite radius would still enclose an infinite area.

Alternatively, perhaps the area is calculated using the given metric. Let me think about that.

Wait, the area computed using the metric would be the integral of sqrt(det g) over the domain. The determinant of the metric is (32/(4 - r^2))², so sqrt(det g) is 32/(4 - r²).

So the area would be the integral over x and y where x² + y² <4 of (32/(4 - r²)) dx dy.

Changing to polar coordinates, it becomes:

Integral from r=0 to 2, θ=0 to 2π of [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

So, Area = ∫ (from 0 to 2π) dθ ∫ (from 0 to 2) [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr.

The θ integral is 2π. So,

Area = 2π * [32 ∫ (0 to 2) r/(4 - r²) dr ]

Let me compute that integral.

Let u = 4 - r² → du = -2 r dr → - (du)/2 = r dr.

So,

∫ r/(4 - r²) dr = ∫ (1/u) * (-du/2) )= (-1/2) ln |u| + C = (-1/2) ln(4 - r²) + C.

Evaluated from 0 to 2:

At r=2: u=0 → ln(0) is -infinite. Hmm, but that's a problem. Let's see:

At r approaches 2 from below, ln(4 - r^2) approaches ln(0) which is -infinity. So the integral becomes ( -1/2 ) [ ln( (4 - (2)^2) ) - ln(4 - 0) ) ] → ( -1/2 ) [ ln(0) - ln(4) ) ]

Which is ( -1/2 ) [ -inf - ln4 ] → (inf + (ln4)/2 ) → infinity.

So the integral diverges, meaning the area is infinite. So the area of the surface described by this metric is infinite.

But wait, the metric is defined on a disk of radius 2, but the area under this metric is infinite. So the given metric's area is infinite, which would correspond to option D, which is +infty.

But the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius r=2. So, in the case of a pseudosphere, which is a surface of constant negative curvature, the area is indeed infinite. So the answer would be D) +infty.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 0

B) 4π(x² + y²)

C)4π(x² – y²)

D) +infty

So the correct answer is D.


The given metric is:

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left( dx^2 + dy^2 \right),
\]

which describes a 2D surface. This is a conformal metric, meaning it scales the Euclidean metric by a factor of \( E^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The domain of the metric is restricted to \( x^2 + y^2 < 4 \), which corresponds to a disk of radius 2 in the \( x \)-\( y \) plane.

The area of a surface described by a metric is computed by integrating the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor over the domain. For this metric, the determinant is \( \text{det}(g) = \left( \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \right)^2 \), so the square root of the determinant is \( \sqrt{\text{det}(g)} = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \). The area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

Switching to polar coordinates (\( x = r \cos\theta \), \( y = r \sin\theta \)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} \cdot r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta \) evaluates to \( 2\pi \), so the area simplifies to:

\[
A = 2\pi \cdot 32 \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To compute the radial integral \( \int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr \), use the substitution \( u = 4 - r^2 \), \( du = -2r \, dr \). This gives:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} \int_{u=4}^{u=0} \frac{1}{u} \, du = -\frac{1}{2} \left[ \ln|u| \right]_4^0.
\]

As \( u \to 0 \), \( \ln|u| \to -\infty \), so the integral diverges to \( +\infty \). This means the area of the surface described by the metric is infinite.

The question asks for the area of a pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \). A pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, and in hyperbolic geometry, the area of a sphere (or pseudosphere) is infinite. Thus, the area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is also infinite.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A) 0**: Incorrect. The area is not zero; it is infinite.
- **B) \( 4\pi(x^2 + y^2) \)**: Incorrect. The area does not depend on \( x \) and \( y \) explicitly; it is a global property of the surface.
- **C) \( 4\pi(x^2 - y^2) \)**: Incorrect. Similar to option B, the area is not a function of \( x \) and \( y \).
- **D) \( +\infty \)**: Correct. The area of the pseudosphere of radius \( r = 2 \) is infinite.
