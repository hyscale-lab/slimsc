Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked. Hmm, the question is about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. 

The setup says we have a magnetic field B that's parallel to the Oz axis (so along the z-axis), and m is small. B is given as 1 Tesla. They want to compare the expectation value of H, which I think is the Hamiltonian, with the transition energy ΔE. The wavelength given is λ=0.4861 micrometers. Oh wait, that's the Balmer series for hydrogen, right? Because 0.486 micrometers is the wavelength for the transition from n=2 to n=1, but I might be mixing up the series. Wait, n=3 to n=2 gives about 656 nm, which is the Balmer-alpha line. Oh wait no, wait 0.486 micrometers is 486 nm, which is the Balmer-beta line, corresponding to n=4 to n=2. So the transition energy ΔE would be the energy difference between these two states.

But how does this relate to the paramagnetic coupling term? I remember that in atoms, when you apply a magnetic field, you get effects like the Zeeman effect. The paramagnetic term is part of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic interaction. The paramagnetic term is the contribution from the orbital angular momentum, I think. The Hamiltonian for the paramagnetic effect is something like H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. Or more precisely, the orbital part of the magnetic moment is given by μ = (e/(2m)) * L, so the Hamiltonian would be proportional to L·B.

Wait, the paramagnetic term is (μ_B) * m * B, maybe? Because the orbital magnetic quantum number is m, and the energy is proportional to m times B. Oh, wait, the formula for the Zeeman effect is ΔE_zeeman = μ_B * m * B, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. So that's the paramagnetic coupling term.

On the other hand, the transition energy ΔE is the energy difference between two hydrogen states. For hydrogen, the energy levels are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for the transition from n=4 to n=2, the energy difference would be E_2 - E_4. Wait, no, because E_4 is higher (less negative) than E_2. So ΔE would be E_2 - E_4, which is (-13.6)/(4) - (-13.6)/(2)^2? Wait, wait, let me compute E_2 and E_4.

E_2 is -13.6 eV / (2)^2 = -13.6 /4 = -3.4 eV. E_4 is -13.6 / 16 = -0.85 eV. So the energy difference ΔE is E_4 - E_2? Wait no, because when you go from higher energy (n=4) to lower (n=2), the photon emitted has energy E_2 - E_4. Wait, E_2 is lower than E_4, so E_2 - E_4 is negative, but the absolute value is the transition energy. So ΔE = |E_2 - E_4| = | (-3.4) - (-0.85) | = | -2.55 | = 2.55 eV.

Wait, but I think I should double-check the exact value. Alternatively, using the Rydberg formula, which relates wavelength to energy. The Rydberg constant R is approximately 1.097e4 m^-1. The Rydberg formula is 1/λ = R (1/(n1²) - 1/(n2²)), where n2 > n1. For Balmer-beta, n1=2 and n2=4. So 1/λ = R (1/4 - 1/16) = R (3/16). Plugging in R=1.097e7 m^-1, λ=0.4861e-6 m.

Wait, let me compute that. So 1/λ = R (3/16) → 1/(0.4861e-6) ≈ 2.057e6 m^-1. R is about 1.097e7 m^-1. 1/λ is 2.057e6 m^-1, R is 1.097e7 m^-1. Let me compute 3/(16) * R: 3/16 *1.097e7≈ (0.1875) *1.097e7 ≈ 2.058e6 m^-1. Which matches 1/λ, so that's correct. So the energy difference is E= hc/(λ).

h is Planck's constant, about 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. So hc = 6.626e-34 *3e8 ≈ 1.9878e-25 J·m. The wavelength λ is 0.4861e-6 meters. So E = hc/(λ) = (1.9878e-25) / (4.861e-7) ≈ approximately 4.088e-19 J. To convert that to eV, since 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J, so E ≈ 4.088e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. That matches what I had earlier. So ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Now, the paramagnetic term is the Zeeman splitting, which for an electron in a magnetic field is μ_B * m * B. Wait, but orbital magnetic quantum number m is small. Wait, m can be -l, -l+1, ..., 0, ..., l-1, l. For hydrogen, l for the nth level is from 0 to n-1. But if m is small, perhaps we can consider m=0 or m=1, but the problem states small m. So let's think: what's the value of the paramagnetic energy shift compared to the transition energy? 

The Bohr magneton μ_B is (eħ)/(2m_e), where m_e is the electron mass. The value is approximately 9.274e-24 J/T. So the energy shift due to the magnetic field is ΔE_param = μ_B * m * B. Since B is 1 T, that's μ_B * m * 1.

What's the maximum possible m for a given state? For example, for a state with orbital angular momentum l, m can be up to l. But if m is small, say m=1, then ΔE_param = μ_B * 1 * 1 T ≈ 9.274e-24 J. Let's convert that to eV. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 9.274e-24 J is about 5.79e-5 eV. So that's about 5.8e-5 eV.

Wait, but wait. The Zeeman effect's energy shift is small compared to the transition energy. Because, the transition energy is 2.55 eV, and the paramagnetic term is ~5.8e-5 eV. So the ratio is 5.8e-5 / 2.55 ≈ 2.27e-5. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy. So the expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field (which includes the paramagnetic term) is much less than the transition energy.

Wait, the question says to compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy. So the paramagnetic term is μ_B * m * B, which is much smaller than the transition energy ΔE.

Wait, but the problem states that m is small. Wait, if m is small, say m=0, then the paramagnetic term is zero. But if m is non-zero but small, like m=1 or 2, then the shift is still much smaller than ΔE.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than the transition energy ΔE. So the correct comparison is ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE. So looking at the options, option C is ⟨H⟩ << ΔE. Because 5.8e-5 eV is much less than 2.55 eV. So the order of magnitude is way smaller.

To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the given parameters and compute the relevant energies.

### Transition Energy (ΔE)
The transition energy corresponds to the energy difference between two hydrogen states. The wavelength of the emitted photon is given as \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} \), which corresponds to the Balmer-beta transition (\( n = 4 \to n = 2 \)). Using the Rydberg formula:

\[
\frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right),
\]

where \( R = 1.097 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1} \), \( n_1 = 2 \), and \( n_2 = 4 \), we confirm that \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} \) matches the Balmer-beta transition. The energy difference is calculated using:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 4.861 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{4.861 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 4.088 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{4.088 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the orbital magnetic moment with the external magnetic field. The energy shift is given by:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{param}} = \mu_B m B,
\]

where \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number, and \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \) is the magnetic field strength. For small \( m \), such as \( m = 1 \), the energy shift becomes:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{param}} = (9.274 \times 10^{-24})(1)(1) \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{param}} \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Comparison
The transition energy \( \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV} \) is significantly larger than the paramagnetic coupling term \( \Delta E_{\text{param}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \). The ratio of the two is approximately:

\[
\frac{\Delta E_{\text{param}}}{\Delta E} \approx \frac{5.79 \times 10^{-5}}{2.55} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

### Conclusion
The expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than the transition energy of the hydrogen atom. Therefore, the correct option is:

h is Planck's constant, about 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s. So hc = 6.626e-34 *3e8 ≈ 1.9878e-25 J·m. The wavelength λ is 0.4861e-6 meters. So E = hc/(λ) = (1.9878e-25) / (4.861e-7) ≈ approximately 4.088e-19 J. To convert that to eV, since 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J, so E ≈ 4.088e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. That matches what I had earlier.

\frac{1}{\lambda} = R \left( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2} \right),
\]

where \( R = 1.097 \times 10^7 \, \text{m}^{-1} \), \( n_1 = 2 \), and \( n_2 = 4 \), we confirm that \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} \) matches the Balmer-beta transition. The energy difference is calculated using:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda},
\]

where \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \), \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \), and \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 4.861 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{4.861 \times 10^{-7}} \approx 4.088 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{4.088 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the orbital magnetic moment with the external magnetic field. The energy shift is given by:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{param}} = \mu_B m B,
\]

where \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton, \( m \) is the orbital magnetic quantum number, and \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \) is the magnetic field strength. For small \( m \), such as \( m = 1 \), the energy shift becomes:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{param}} = (9.274 \times 10^{-24})(1)(1) \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
\Delta E_{\text{param}} \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
\]

### Comparison
The transition energy \( \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV} \) is significantly larger than the paramagnetic coupling term \( \Delta E_{\text{param}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \). The ratio of the two is approximately:

\[
\frac{\Delta E_{\text{param}}}{\Delta E} \approx \frac{5.79 \times 10^{-5}}{2.55} \approx 2.27 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

### Conclusion
The expectation value of the Hamiltonian due to the paramagnetic coupling term is much less than the transition energy of the hydrogen atom. Therefore, the correct option is:
