Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. Hmm, I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. Wait, but wait—what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, right, 2-d is a typo. Oh wait, maybe it's 2-dimethylaminoethyl or something else. Wait, no, the "d" probably refers to the position. Let me parse the name again.

Wait, the compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, wait, maybe it's 2-dimethylaminobromobenzene? Or maybe it's 2-dimethylaminoethyl bromide attached to benzene? Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Wait, perhaps the structure is benzene with a bromine at position 1 and another substituent at position 2. But what is that substituent?

Wait, I think I made a mistake. Let me think again. The compound is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Oh, wait, maybe it's 2-dimethylaminobromobenzene. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the "d" stands for deuterium? Like a deuterated compound? Or maybe it's 2-dimethylaminoethyl group attached to the benzene ring at position 2, with a bromine at position 1. Wait, maybe the structure is that of benzene with a bromine at position 1 and a 2-dimethylaminoethyl group at position 2. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a diethylamino group or a different group.

Wait, perhaps the compound is benzene with a bromine at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2? No, that seems unlikely. Maybe it's 2-dimethylaminoethyl bromide? Or perhaps the substituent is a methyl group with a deuterium. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look at the reaction conditions first to get a better idea.

The reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in elimination reactions, especially for dehydrohalogenation to form alkenes. Alternatively, it could be used in deprotonation steps. For example, in aromatic substitution reactions like the benzidine rearrangement or in forming aniline by deprotonating a nitro group. But wait, that's when you have a nitro group adjacent to a leaving group.

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. Maybe I should draw the structure. Let's imagine the benzene ring with a bromine at position 1. Then, at position 2, there's a substituent which is perhaps a dimethylamino group (since NaNH2 is a strong base, maybe it's an elimination scenario). Or perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group with a leaving group.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH2 group or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a methyl group with a leaving group. Wait, but the question is a bit unclear. Let me think about the reaction.

Another approach: NaNH2 in ammonia is a common condition for the Hofmann elimination. That typically involves a quaternary ammonium salt, which when treated with a strong base like NaNH2, undergoes elimination to form an alkene. So if the starting material has an adjacent leaving group and an amine, perhaps the reaction would form an alkene.

Wait, so if we have a benzylamine derivative, like a benzyl group attached to a dimethylaminoethyl group, perhaps the structure is such that elimination can occur. Let me think of the structure as benzene ring with Br at position 1 and a CH2CH2N(CH3)2 group at position 2. Then, when treated with NaNH2, perhaps the base abstracts a proton beta to the Br, leading to an elimination of Br- and forming a double bond.

Wait, but benzene rings are aromatic, so the substituents are in positions 1 and 2. So maybe the substituent at position 2 is a CH2CH2NMe2 group, which is a good leaving group adjacent to a leaving group. No, wait, the bromine is the leaving group. Oh wait, maybe it's a benzyl bromide with another substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group attached to a dimethylamino group.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a bromine in position 1 and a CH2NMe2 group in position 2. Then, the bromide is adjacent to the CH2 group, which is attached to the dimethylamino group. So, when treated with NaNH2, a strong base, it would abstract a proton from the CH2 group, leading to the elimination of H and Br, forming an alkene between the benzene and the nitrogen.

Wait, more accurately, the structure might be benzene with a Br at position 1 and a CH2CH2NMe2 group at position 2, but that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2NMe2 group attached to the benzene at position 2, and the Br is at position 1. So, the structure would be Br-C6H4-CH2NMe2.

Wait, if that's the case, then when treated with NaNH2, which is a strong base, perhaps elimination occurs. The base would deprotonate the CH2 group adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a double bond between the benzene ring and the nitrogen. So the product would be a benzene ring with a CH=NMe2 group attached.

Wait, but in such a scenario, the possible products would depend on where the elimination occurs. Since the starting material is 1-bromo-2-something benzene, the substituent is in the ortho position relative to the Br. So elimination would form a double bond between positions 1 and 2, resulting in a conjugated system, perhaps a vinyl group attached to the ring.

Wait, but when elimination occurs, the Br leaves, and the adjacent carbon (the one attached to Br and to the substituent) loses a proton, forming a double bond. But wait, the substituent is at position 2, so the Br is at position 1. So the adjacent carbon would be the same as position 2.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group attached to an amine. I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps I should think about the possible products.

Another thought: NaNH2 in ammonia is also used for dehydrohalogenation of benzyl halides, leading to benzyne intermediates. Wait, that's another possibility. When a benzyl halide is treated with a strong base like NaNH2, it can lose HX and form a triple bond (but wait, that's usually for vicinal dihalides, like 1,2-dihaloarenes, leading to a triple bond). But wait, in this case, the compound is 1-bromo, so perhaps elimination is possible to form a triple bond if there's another leaving group adjacent. But in our case, I think the substituent is a dimethylaminoethyl group or similar.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2-(dimethylaminomethyl)benzene. So the structure is benzene with Br at position 1 and a CH2NMe2 group at position 2. Then, when treated with NaNH2, the base could deprotonate the CH2 group, leading to elimination of Br- and formation of a double bond between the benzene carbon and the adjacent carbon, resulting in a structure like CH=NMe2 attached to the benzene.

Wait, but CH2NMe2 has two protons, so the base could abstract either of them. But in this scenario, the CH2 is between the benzene (position 2) and the NMe2. So if the Br is at position 1, then the CH2 is at position 2, adjacent to position 1. So when the base abstracts a proton from the CH2, the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between positions 1 and 2. So the product would be a benzene ring with a C=C attached to NMe2.

Wait, so the product would be a styrene-like structure but with an NMe2 group. So it would be a substituted vinyl group attached to the benzene.

But wait, how many possible products can form from this elimination? The substituent is at position 2, and the Br is at position 1, so the elimination would form a double bond between positions 1 and 2, leading to a trans or cis configuration? Or perhaps it's a single product because the elimination occurs in a specific way.

Wait, but another possibility is that the starting material could undergo more than one elimination, but perhaps the structure only allows for one product. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that the elimination can form different products.

Wait, but let me think again. If the substituent is a CH2NMe2 group at position 2, and Br is at position 1, then elimination would form a double bond between C1 and C2. The structure would then be benzene with a C=NMe2 group, but that's a triple bond. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, elimination of H and Br from adjacent carbons would form a double bond. So the product would be a benzene ring with a CH2 group that becomes a double bond, so CH becomes CH2, but wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps the structure is benzene with a Br at position 1 and a CH2CH2NMe2 group at position 2. In this case, elimination would lead to the formation of an alkene between the CH2 and CH2 groups, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a CH2CH2NMe2 group, and the Br is on the adjacent carbon. So when NaNH2 is added, the base abstracts a proton from the CH2 group adjacent to Br, leading to the formation of a double bond between the benzene and the CH2 group.

Wait, but perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group attached to an amine. Let's imagine the structure as benzene with a Br at position 1 and a CH2-N(CH2CH3)2 group at position 2. Then, when the base abstracts a proton, the Br leaves, and a double bond forms between position 1 and 2, giving a structure with a CH2-NMe2 group attached to a double bond.

Wait, but perhaps the substituent at position 2 is a CH2CH2NMe2 group, so elimination would produce a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's a CH2CH2NMe2 group, leading to formation of a trans or cis double bond. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group, but that's probably not relevant here.

Wait, another approach: the reaction of 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in ammonia. Maybe the starting material is benzene with a Br at position 1 and a deuterium at position 2. But that doesn't make sense because deuterium is a hydrogen isotope and probably wouldn't affect the reaction much.

Wait, perhaps the structure is 2-dimethylaminophenyl bromide. So the benzene has a Br at position 1 and a dimethylamino group at position 2. Then, when treated with NaNH2, perhaps the amine could participate in a reaction.

But wait, NaNH2 is a strong base and could deprotonate the amine, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is elimination. In that case, the Br is at position 1, and the substituent at position 2 is a group that can undergo elimination. For example, perhaps it's a CH2 group attached to a leaving group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent at position 2 is a CH2Br group, but the question states it's 1-bromo, so that's not the case. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is benzene with a Br at position 1 and a CH2NHMe2 group at position 2. Then, the NaNH2 could deprotonate the NH, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a C=N group and a Me2 group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products when a benzyl bromide is treated with a strong base. For example, benzyl bromide would typically undergo elimination to form benzene with a triple bond (like benzyne), but that's when it's a dihalide. Alternatively, if it's a benzyl bromide with another substituent that allows for elimination, like an adjacent hydrogen, then elimination would form a double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic substitution. But with NaNH2, which is a strong base, substitution is less likely unless it's an SN2 mechanism, but benzene rings are not very susceptible to SN2 attacks because the leaving group is on a sp2 hybridized carbon, which is not very good for backside attack.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility is that the substituent at position 2 is an amino group, perhaps a secondary or tertiary amine. For example, if it's a dimethylamino group attached to position 2, then the reaction with NaNH2 might not do much unless elimination is possible.

Hmm, perhaps the substituent is a CH2 group between the ring and the amine. So the structure is benzene-Br at position 1, and a CH2NMe2 group at position 2. Then, when NaNH2 is added, it deprotonates the CH2, leading to elimination of Br- and formation of a double bond. So the product would be a benzene ring with a C=NMe2 group, but wait, that's a nitrile or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a vinyl group attached to the NMe2.

Wait, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of an imine. So the structure becomes benzene with a CH=NMe2 group. But I'm not sure how that would look.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group attached to an amine, and elimination occurs to form a longer chain with a double bond.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look up some reactions involving NaNH2 and benzyl halides. Oh, but I can't do that right now. So, I'll have to rely on my memory.

Wait, another thought: when a benzyl halide is treated with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia, it can undergo elimination to form a triple bond between the benzene ring and an adjacent carbon. For example, if the benzyl halide is 1-bromo-2-chlorobenzene, elimination would form benzyne. But in this case, we have only a Br and a substituent, so perhaps elimination forms a triple bond between positions 1 and 2.

Wait, but if the substituent is at position 2 and the Br is at position 1, can elimination happen to form a triple bond between C1 and C2? Then, the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2, making it benzyne.

But wait, in that case, would benzyne form? Because benzyne is a very reactive species and can rearrange or undergo other reactions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction would stop at the alkene stage, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent at position 2 is an amino group that can't undergo elimination, but that may not be the case.

Alternatively, the substituent is a CH2 group, and elimination leads to a trans-alkene or a cis-alkene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but if the substituent is a CH2 group attached to an amine, then elimination would form a double bond, but perhaps the product would have a substituent on the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, removing Br and a proton to form a double bond. So, the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between positions 1 and 2, making it a vinyl group.

Wait, but how many possible products would that result in? If the substituent is only at position 2, the elimination would form a single product because the positions are fixed.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps the substituent can lead to more than one product. For example, if the substituent is a group that can lose a proton from either the same or adjacent carbons, leading to different positions of the double bond.

Wait, but if the substituent is only at position 2 and the Br is at position 1, then elimination can only occur between positions 1 and 2, so the double bond would form between them, leading to a single product.

So, the number of possible products would be one. But wait, maybe the substituent is such that the elimination can lead to different stereochemical outcomes, like cis or trans alkenes. But in the case of aromatic rings, the substituents are typically planar, so the double bond would be in a fixed position, perhaps leading to only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent allows for different regioselectivity, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, but another possibility is that the substituent is a CH2CH3 group, and elimination could lead to either a terminal or internal double bond. Wait, but that would require another substituent, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group, leading to a longer chain, but again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that elimination can occur in two different ways, leading to two different products. For example, if the substituent is a CH2CH2 group, elimination could lead to either a vinyl group or a longer chain. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. So when treated with NaNH2, the base deprotonates the methyl group adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination of Br- and formation of a double bond. So the product would be 1,2-dimethylaminophenylene but with a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but the substituent might be a CH2 group attached to the dimethylamino group. So the structure is benzene-Br at position 1 and CH2NMe2 at position 2. Then, elimination would form a double bond between positions 1 and 2, giving a structure like CH2=CHNMe2 attached to the benzene? No, that's not quite right.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a vinyl group attached to the NMe2, making it a substituted vinyl amine.

Wait, but considering all this, perhaps the reaction leads to only one product. So the answer would be option B) 1.

Wait, but wait another thought: sometimes in such eliminations, especially with bulky groups, different stereoisomers can form. But since the ring is symmetric, perhaps the stereoisomers are the same, leading to a single product.

Alternatively, if the substituent is such that elimination can occur in more than one position, leading to multiple products. But in this scenario, I think the substituent is only at position 2, so elimination can only occur between positions 1 and 2, leading to a single product.

So, putting it all together, I think the reaction produces only one product. Therefore, the correct answer is B) 1.

The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia. NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used in elimination reactions. The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, is interpreted as a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a substituent at position 2. The substituent is likely a group capable of undergoing elimination with the bromine atom, such as a CH₂ group attached to a dimethylamino group (CH₂NMe₂).

When NaNH₂ is added, it abstracts a proton from the CH₂ group adjacent to the bromine, leading to the elimination of Br⁻ and the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 2 of the benzene ring. This results in a product where the benzene ring is conjugated with a double bond involving the nitrogen atom of the dimethylamino group (CH=NMe₂).

The reaction is regioselective, and the substituents are positioned such that elimination can only occur between positions 1 and 2. This leads to a single product, as there are no alternative positions for elimination or multiple stereoisomers due to the symmetry of the molecule. Therefore, only one organic product is formed in this reaction.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a bromine in position 1 and a CH2NMe2 group in position 2. Then, the bromide is adjacent to the CH2 group, which is attached to the dimethylamino group. So, when treated with NaNH2, a strong base, it would abstract a proton from the CH2 group, leading to the elimination of H and Br, forming an alkene between the benzene and the nitrogen.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is benzene with a Br at position 1 and a CH2NHMe2 group at position 2. Then, the NaNH2 could deprotonate the NH, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a C=N group and a Me2 group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible products when a benzyl bromide is treated with a strong base. For example, benzyl bromide would typically undergo elimination to form benzene with a triple bond (like benzyne), but that's when it's a dihalide.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should look up some reactions involving NaNH2 and benzyl halides. Oh, but I can't do that right now. So, I'll have to rely on my memory.

Wait, another thought: when a benzyl halide is treated with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia, it can undergo elimination to form a triple bond between the benzene ring and an adjacent carbon. For example, if the benzyl halide is 1-bromo-2-chlorobenzene, elimination would form benzyne. But in this case, we have only a Br and a substituent, so perhaps elimination forms a triple bond between positions 1 and 2.

Wait, but if the substituent is at position 2 and the Br is at position 1, can elimination happen to form a triple bond between C1 and C2? Then, the product would be a benzene ring with a triple bond between C1 and C2, making it benzyne.

But wait, in that case, would benzyne form? Because benzyne is a very reactive species and can rearrange or undergo other reactions. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction would stop at the alkene stage, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent at position 2 is an amino group that can't undergo elimination, but that may not be the case.

Alternatively, the substituent is a CH2 group, and elimination leads to a trans-alkene or a cis-alkene, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but if the substituent is a CH2 group attached to an amine, then elimination would form a double bond, but perhaps the product would have a substituent on the double bond.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, removing Br and a proton to form a double bond. So, the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between positions 1 and 2, making it a vinyl group.

Wait, but how many possible products would that result in? If the substituent is only at position 2, the elimination would form a single product because the positions are fixed.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps the substituent can lead to more than one product. For example, if the substituent is a group that can lose a proton from either the same or adjacent carbons, leading to different positions of the double bond.

Wait, but if the substituent is only at position 2 and the Br is at position 1, then elimination can only occur between positions 1 and 2, so the double bond would form between them, leading to a single product.

So, the number of possible products would be one. But wait, maybe the substituent is such that the elimination can lead to different stereochemical outcomes, like cis or trans alkenes. But in the case of aromatic rings, the substituents are typically planar, so the double bond would be in a fixed position, perhaps leading to only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent allows for different regioselectivity, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, but another possibility is that the substituent is a CH2CH3 group, and elimination could lead to either a terminal or internal double bond. Wait, but that would require another substituent, which isn't the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group, leading to a longer chain, but again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is such that elimination can occur in two different ways, leading to two different products. For example, if the substituent is a CH2CH2 group, elimination could lead to either a vinyl group or a longer chain. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: the starting material is 1-bromo-2-dimethylaminobenzene. So when treated with NaNH2, the base deprotonates the methyl group adjacent to the Br, leading to elimination of Br- and formation of a double bond. So the product would be 1,2-dimethylaminophenylene but with a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, but the substituent might be a CH2 group attached to the dimethylamino group. So the structure is benzene-Br at position 1 and CH2NMe2 at position 2. Then, elimination would form a double bond between positions 1 and 2, giving a structure like CH2=CHNMe2 attached to the benzene? No, that's not quite right.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a vinyl group attached to the NMe2, making it a substituted vinyl amine.

Wait, but considering all this, perhaps the reaction leads to only one product. So the answer would be option B) 1.

Wait, but wait another thought: sometimes in such eliminations, especially with bulky groups, different stereoisomers can form. But since the ring is symmetric, perhaps the stereoisomers are the same, leading to a single product.

Alternatively, if the substituent is such that elimination can occur in more than one position, leading to multiple products. But in this scenario, I think the substituent is only at position 2, so elimination can only occur between positions 1 and 2, leading to a single product.

So, putting it all together, I think the reaction produces only one product. Therefore, the correct answer is B) 1.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia. NaNH₂ is a strong base, commonly used in elimination reactions. The starting material, 1-bromobenzene-2-d, is interpreted as a benzene ring with a bromine atom at position 1 and a substituent at position 2. The substituent is likely a group capable of undergoing elimination with the bromine atom, such as a CH₂ group attached to a dimethylamino group (CH₂NMe₂).

When NaNH₂ is added, it abstracts a proton from the CH₂ group adjacent to the bromine, leading to the elimination of Br⁻ and the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 2 of the benzene ring. This results in a product where the benzene ring is conjugated with a double bond involving the nitrogen atom of the dimethylamino group (CH=NMe₂).

The reaction is regioselective, and the substituents are positioned such that elimination can only occur between positions 1 and 2. This leads to a single product, as there are no alternative positions for elimination or multiple stereoisomers due to the symmetry of the molecule. Therefore, only one organic product is formed in this reaction.

Answer: B
