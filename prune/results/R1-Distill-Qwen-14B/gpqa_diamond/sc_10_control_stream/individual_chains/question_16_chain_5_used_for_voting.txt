Okay, so I've got this question here about optical activity in different compounds. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question asks how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity. The options are A to D, with the answer being one of them.

First, I remember that a compound exhibits optical activity if it has chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. So, my task is to check each compound one by one to see if they have any chiral centers.

Let's go through each compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Hmm, the formula is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or perhaps it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, right? So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So structure would be Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be CH2Cl-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait the but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro is CH2Cl-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. But this is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw the structure. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have Cl on C1, a double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl group on C2.

So structure: Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group), then C3 and C4.

Wait, but for C1, let's think: it's CHCl=CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons with double bond between 1 and 2. So for 2-methyl, the structure would be CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? But no, wait, but it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between 1 and 2, so it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that would be C1 (Cl), C2 (CH2), C3 (C(CH3)), and C4 (CH2). Wait, no, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Regardless of the structure, what's important is whether there are any chiral centers. So, does (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene have any chiral centers? Let's think. The molecule is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is attached to Cl and double bond. So for C1: what are the substituents? The double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 has Cl, CH2-, and two other bonds? Wait, no, double bonds have two substituents. Let me think again.

But maybe it's easier to consider the structure as CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, it's Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2 (with a methyl group). So the structure would be Cl-C double bond CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's not possible because C1 is connected via double bond to C2. So the groups on C1 would be Cl, the double bond (so two substituents from that), and perhaps a hydrogen? Wait, but wait, for a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and one substituent each. Hmm, perhaps C1 has Cl, a double bond to C2, and two Hs. Then, C1 would be CH2Cl, but no, wait, because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl substituted on CH2. So it's Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Oh wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Hmm, but that can't be right because but-1-ene would have four carbons, so perhaps it's (Cl)CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, maybe the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. No, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move on and come back. Alternatively, perhaps this compound doesn't have any chiral centers. Because the molecule is planar around the double bond, so any substituents would be on the same plane, meaning no possibility for a chiral center at C2. Or wait, perhaps C2 has a methyl group, a Cl on C1, a double bond, and another substituent. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Anyway, perhaps this compound doesn't have any chiral centers, making it not optically active.

Wait, but maybe I should think about this differently. If the molecule has a double bond, any possible chiral centers would be elsewhere. So, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, C1 is CHCl, but wait, no. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps this compound doesn't have any chiral centers because all the substituents on any carbon are the same. Wait, perhaps C2, which has the methyl group, is attached to C1 (double bond) and C3 and perhaps a hydrogen. So, if the substituents on C2 are CH3, CH2Cl (from C1), and two other CH2 groups, maybe not. Or maybe not, because the molecule is symmetric.

Wait, perhaps the key point is that for a molecule to be chiral, it must have a chiral center. So, if any of the carbons in the molecule has four different groups attached, then it's chiral.

For (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, perhaps looking at C2: it's attached to a methyl group, a double bond (so two substituents), and perhaps two other groups. Wait, but C2 is connected to C1 (double bond), C3 (single bond), and a methyl group. So, what are the substituents on C2? Let's see:

C2 would have: 
1. a double bond to C1 (so that's one substituent),
2. a single bond to C3,
3. a methyl group,
and perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, no, but but-1-ene is four carbons, so let's think again. The structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, structure would be Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, which is in a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the correct structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's four carbons: C1 (Cl and CH2), C2 (C(CH3) and double bond to C1), C3 (CH2), C4 (CH3)? No, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2CH3? No, that can't be right because the double bond can't be between C2 and C3 if it's but-1-ene.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on this one. Let me think of another approach. For a molecule to have optical activity, it needs to have at least one chiral center. So, let's look for that.

In 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but that's not possible because that would make it a five-carbon chain, but but-1-ene is four carbons. So, perhaps the correct structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, the molecule is Cl attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a C(CH3), which is double-bonded to CH2. Wait, but that would be four carbons: Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, four carbons in total.

In that case, let's look at each carbon:

C1: Cl, two Hs, and a single bond to C2 (CH2Cl). So, C1 is CH2Cl. It's attached to two Hs, Cl, and a CH2 group leading to C2. So, four substituents? Wait, no, because CH2Cl is actually CH2Cl, which is two substituents (Cl and two Hs?), but wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, each carbon has four bonds. So, for C1, the structure is CH2Cl, which is -CH2Cl. So, C1 is CH2Cl: two Hs, a Cl, and a single bond to C2. So, substituents: Cl, H, H, and the rest is CH2 connected to C2.

C2 is C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no. C2 is connected via a double bond to C1. So, C2 is CH(CH3), connected via a double bond to C1, and single bonds to C3 and perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers because all the carbons are either in a double bond (so planar) or symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making any potential chiral centers actually meso compounds, leading to no optical activity.

Moving on to the next compound.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**

Okay, this one seems complex. But, methanoisobenzofuran would have a fused ring structure. The substituents are at position 8 as chloromethylene (Cl-CH2-), and the configuration is given as (3aR,7aS,E). The E configuration refers to the double bond geometry.

Wait, methanoisobenzofuran is a bicyclic structure. Let me think: the 4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione would have two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3. The substituent at 8 is chloromethylene, which is Cl-CH2- attached as a substituent.

The configuration is given as (3aR,7aS,E). So, the molecule has stereocenters at 3a and 7a, both in the ring system. So, that would mean those positions are chiral centers. So, this compound has stereocenters and thus is chiral. But wait, does the E configuration affect optical activity? Hmm, the E or Z configuration refers to the arrangement around the double bond, which in this case is in the chloromethylene group. So, perhaps that doesn't contribute to a chiral center. But the ring substituents do.

So, this compound should be optically active because of the stereocenters (chiral centers) at 3a and 7a. But wait, if the molecule has two chiral centers, but are they in a meso form? For example, if the two stereocenters are mirror images, the molecule could be meso and not chiral. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say, but given that the configurations are R and S, perhaps they don't cancel each other out. So, I think this compound exhibits optical activity.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**

Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So, 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid would have methyl groups on the second and third carbons. So, the structure would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Now, the configurations are R and S at C2 and C3, respectively.

We need to check if these carbons are chiral centers. Let's look at each.

At C2: substituents are:
- one COOH group (from C1),
- two CH(CH3) groups (wait, no, C2 is attached to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two methyl groups? Wait, no, because 2,3-dimethyl would mean each of C2 and C3 have a methyl group.

Structure: HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, so C2 is attached to:
- C1 (COOH),
- C3 (CH(CH3)),
- two methyl groups? No, wait, each of C2 and C3 have a methyl group. So, each has two CH3 groups, and then two more substituents.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is:
HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So, C2 is attached to:
- C1 (COOH),
- C3 (CH(CH3)),
- two CH3 groups?

Wait, that can't be right because each carbon can only have four bonds. So, let me correct that.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
O=C-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-C=O
    |        |
    O       O

Wait, no, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So, each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) have a methyl group attached.

So, for C2:
- two methyl groups (from the dimethyl),
- the carbonyl groups on either side (from C1 and C3? No, wait, C2 is between C1 (COOH) and C3 (CH(CH3)).

Wait, no. Let me think of the structure as:

Carboxylic acid groups on C1 and C4.

So, C1: COOH,
C2: CH(CH3),
C3: CH(CH3),
C4: COOH.

So, C2 is attached to:
- C1 (COOH),
- C3 (CH(CH3)),
- and two methyl groups?

Wait, but that would make four substituents. So, substituents on C2 are:
- COOH (from C1),
- CH(CH3) (from C3),
- two CH3 groups?

Wait, that can't be right because that's four substituents, but perhaps the structure is such that C2 is CH(CH3) connected to C1 and C3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach it differently. Each of C2 and C3 has a methyl group. So, for C2, the substituents are:

1. COOH (from C1),
2. CH(CH3) (from C3),
3. two CH3 groups?

Wait, no, that's not possible because that would make four substituents, which is okay, but are they all different?

Wait, substituents on C2 would be:
- COOH (from C1),
- CH(CH3) (from C3),
- two methyl groups?

Wait, that would mean C2 has groups: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, and another CH3. Wait, but that can't be, because that would mean two identical substituents (two CH3 groups), making it not a chiral center.

Ah, wait! So, if C2 has two methyl groups, then the substituents are: COOH, CH(CH3), and two CH3 groups. But two substituents are the same, so C2 is not a chiral center. Similarly, C3 would have substituents: COOH (from C4?), CH(CH3) (from C2), and two CH3 groups. Wait, no, C3 is connected to C2 and C4. So, substituents would be:

For C3:
- CH(CH3) (from C2),
- COOH (from C4),
- two CH3 groups.

Again, two substituents are CH3, so C3 is not a chiral center. So, this compound doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active. Hmm, but wait, the question says (2R,3S), which implies that both C2 and C3 are stereocenters. But according to my previous analysis, they can't be, because they have two identical substituents. So, perhaps I'm wrong here. Or maybe the structure is different.

Wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, so the two middle carbons each have a methyl group. But for each of these carbons, the substituents are:

C2: 
1. COOH (from C1),
2. CH(CH3) (from C3),
3. two CH3 groups? No, that's four substituents, but two are CH3, so they can't be four different groups. So, no, C2 is not a chiral center.

Thus, this compound doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active. But wait, the question states (2R,3S) configuration, which suggests that they are chiral centers. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with methyl groups on C2 and C3. So, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, in that case, each of C2 and C3 would have substituents:

For C2:
- C1 (COOH),
- C3 (CH(CH3)),
- two CH3 groups.

Wait, but that would make two substituents as CH3, so C2 isn't a chiral center. Hmm, so perhaps this compound doesn't have any chiral centers, making it not optically active. But the question says (2R,3S), which implies they are stereocenters. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that C2 has four different groups. Let me think again. If C2 is connected to:

- C1 (COOH),
- C3 (CH(CH3)),
- two different groups besides the methyl.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So C2 is CH(CH3), connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups. So substituents: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, CH3. So, two CH3 groups, which are same, so C2 isn't a chiral center. Similarly for C3. So, this compound doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active.

Wait, but the question says (2R,3S), which suggests that the carbons are stereocenters. So perhaps the structure is different. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are different. Wait, perhaps the substituents are such that each has four different groups. But I'm not seeing it.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has another group that makes it chiral. Wait, perhaps the two methyl groups are on adjacent carbons, but that doesn't change the fact that each has two methyl groups.

Wait, maybe the substituents on C2 are: COOH, CH(CH3), and two different groups. Wait, no, because C2 is connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups. So, four substituents. But two are same (CH3), so it's not a chiral center.

So, this compound doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**

Same as the previous compound but with R configuration on both C2 and C3.

Wait, using the same reasoning as before, if C2 and C3 each have two methyl groups, then they aren't chiral centers. So this compound also doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it's not optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**

Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, the structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH group on C1. Now, the configuration is R, which implies that the OH is in a specific configuration.

Now, for a cyclohexene ring with substituents, does it have any chiral centers? The OH is on C1. Let's look at the substituents on C1.

In cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, C1 has:

- OH group,
- two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6),
- and the ring structure.

Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two other ring carbons and two substituents. So, for C1, the substituents are OH, and three ring carbons. Wait, that can't be right because a carbon can't have five bonds. Wait, each carbon in the ring has two single bonds to adjacent ring carbons and two substituents. So, C1 is connected to C2 and C6 via single bonds, and has OH and a hydrogen (if the ring isn't substituted elsewhere). Wait, but wait, the double bond is between C3 and C4, which affects the structure.

The key here is whether C1 has four different substituents. Let's think: C1 is attached to:

- OH,
- two ring carbons (C2 and C6),
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but that's four substituents: OH, H, C2, and C6. But wait, the ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So, is C1 a chiral center? Because if it has four different groups, then yes.

But wait, C2 and C6 are connected to the same type of groups. So, perhaps the substituents are: OH, H, and two identical ring groups (the adjacent carbons). But if C2 and C6 are the same, then C1 would have three substituents: OH, H, and the two ring carbons (which are same? No, wait, the ring is a cyclohexene, so perhaps the substituents on C2 and C6 are different because of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the ring is such that C2 is adjacent to the double bond, and C6 is not. So, C2 and C6 might have different substituents. Therefore, C1 would have four different substituents: OH, H, C2 (which is connected to the double bond), and C6 (which is not). Thus, C1 is a chiral center, making the compound optically active.

So, this compound should exhibit optical activity.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**

This is a cyclohexane ring with OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. The configurations are all s.

Now, a cyclohexane with three OH groups, each on alternating positions (1,3,5). Are any of these OH-bearing carbons chiral centers?

Each of these carbons (C1, C3, C5) is attached to:

- OH,
- two adjacent ring carbons (for C1: C2 and C6),
- and perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, but in a cyclohexane, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons via single bonds, and two other single bonds to substituents. So, for C1:

- OH,
- C2,
- C6,
- and H.

Wait, that's four substituents. Are any of them same? Let's see. The substituents are OH, H, C2, and C6. Are C2 and C6 different from each other? Well, in a cyclohexane ring, C2 is adjacent to C3, which has an OH group, and C6 is adjacent to C5, which also has an OH group. So, perhaps the substituents on C2 and C6 are different because their neighboring groups are different. Therefore, C1 would have four different groups: OH, H, C2 (which is connected to C3-OH), and C6 (connected to C5-OH). Thus, C1 is a chiral center.

Similarly, C3 and C5 would each have four different substituents, making them chiral centers as well. So, this compound has three chiral centers, making it optically active.

Wait, but wait, does the molecule have any symmetry? Because 1,3,5-triol on a cyclohexane ring could be a symmetric structure. For example, if all three OH groups are in positions that can be rotated into each other, the molecule could be achiral due to symmetry. But with all s configurations, perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but the configuration is (1s,3s,5s). Let me think about whether this creates a meso situation. For example, in a cyclohexane with three substituents, if the configurations lead to a plane of symmetry, the molecule could be achiral. But in this case, with all s configurations, perhaps the molecule is chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Hmm.

Wait, considering a cyclohexane ring with substituents on 1,3,5 positions, if the substituents are all the same (like OH), the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if you draw a plane through the center of the ring, perhaps the substituents mirror each other. But in this case, the configurations are all s. So, perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but let's imagine the substituents. Each of the OH groups is on a carbon, and the configuration is s. So, when you rotate the ring, perhaps the arrangement leads to no internal plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. So, this compound is optically active.

Alternatively, another approach: if the molecule has an even number of chiral centers, but they are arranged symmetrically, it could be a meso compound. But in this case, there are three chiral centers, which is odd, so it can't be a meso compound. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and optically active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**

The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of a butan-1-one (which is (CH2)3-CO-). So, the full structure is (cyclopentyl)C(O)CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO with the ketone on C1. So, it's:

CO
|
C1 - (cyclopentyl) attached here.
Then, C2 is CH2, C3 is CH2, C4 is CH3.

Wait, no, butan-1-one is:

O
||
C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

Wait, butan-1-one is actually (CH2)3-CO. So, the structure is:

CO
|
C1 connected to cyclopentyl group and three other carbons?

Wait, perhaps it's (cyclopentyl)-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, because butan-1-one has four carbons, with the ketone on C1. So, structure is:

O
||
C1 (connected to cyclopentyl) - C2 - C3 - C4.

Wait, but the exact structure isn't critical. What matters is whether any carbon is a chiral center.

The carbonyl group is at C1, so it's a ketone. So, C1 is connected to:

- cyclopentyl,
- O,
- and two other carbons (C2 and C3? No, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO, so perhaps the structure is more accurately (cyclopentyl)C(O)CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, but that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's (cyclopentyl) attached to C1, which is a ketone, and then three more CH2 groups.

Regardless, the key is to look for chiral centers. The cyclopentyl group is a ring, so any substituents on it would have their own chiral centers.

Wait, but the cyclopentyl group in this compound is attached to C1 as a substituent. So, C1 is attached to:

- cyclopentyl,
- the ketone oxygen,
- and perhaps two other groups. Wait, but in butan-1-one, the structure is (CH2)3-CO, so C1 is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O and connected to three other carbons. But in this case, one of those is replaced by the cyclopentyl group.

Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is:

CH2CH2CH2-CO.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CO
|
C1 - cyclopentyl
|
C2 - CH2
|
C3 - CH2
|
C4 - CH3

Wait, no, butan-1-one is four carbons, so the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the carbonyl is on C1, then C2, C3, C4, each with two Hs. So, in this case, C1 is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O and attached to C2 (CH2), and perhaps another group.

Wait, if the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, then the structure is:

O
||
C1 (connected to cyclopentyl and C2)
C2 (CH2)
C3 (CH(CH3))
C4 (CH3)

Wait, that would make it:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-C(CH3)H-CH3.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Let's think about the chiral centers.

Looking for any carbon with four different substituents.

The cyclopentyl group: if it's attached to C1, which is the carbonyl carbon, then C1's substituents are: cyclopentyl, O (from carbonyl), and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, because the carbonyl is double-bonded to O, so it can't have two CH2 groups attached. Wait, no, the carbonyl C is double-bonded to O and connected to two other groups. So, in the case of 1-cyclopentylbutan-1-one, the structure would be:

O
||
C1 (cyclopentyl, CH2-CH2-CH3)

Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO, so C1 is the carbonyl, connected to C2, which is CH2, C3 is CH2, C4 is CH3. So, 1-cyclopentyl would replace one of the Hs on C1 with a cyclopentyl group. So, C1 would have:

- O (double bond),
- cyclopentyl,
- C2 (CH2),
- and another substituent, which could be another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps C1 has four substituents: O (double bond), cyclopentyl, CH2 (from C2), and another CH2 group? No, because C1 is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to three other groups. Wait, no, a carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O and has two single bonds to other groups. So, in 1-cyclopentylbutan-1-one, C1 would be connected to:

- O (double bond),
- cyclopentyl,
- C2 (CH2),
- and another substituent, which would be another CH2 group, making it not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that C3 has a methyl group, making it a chiral center.

Wait, in 3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure is O=C-CH2-C(CH3)H-CH3. So, C3 has a methyl group, a CH2 from C2, a CH3 from C4, and a hydrogen. So, substituents on C3 would be: CH2 (from C2), CH(CH3), H, and CH3 (from C4)? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, C3 in this structure would be CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), and a hydrogen. So, substituents are: CH2, CH3, H, and perhaps another group. Wait, wait, but that's four substituents, but are they all different?

Wait, substituents on C3 would be:

- CH2 (from C2),
- CH3 (from C4),
- H,
- and the methyl group (CH3) attached to C3.

Wait, no, because C3 has a methyl group, so substituents would be:

- CH2 (C2),
- CH(CH3) (C4?), no. Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3, but that is pentan-1-one, not butan-1-one. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, because that would be pentan-1-one. So, perhaps the correct structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3, which would make it 3-methylbutan-1-one. So, C3 is CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), and a hydrogen. So, substituents on C3 are:

- CH2 (from C2),
- CH3 (from C4),
- H,
- and the methyl group (CH3) attached to C3.

Wait, but that would make two substituents as CH3 (from C4 and the methyl group on C3), so C3 has two CH3 groups, making it not a chiral center.

Wait, but in the compound given, it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So, the structure is O=C- (cyclopentyl) - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2 - CH3.

Wait, that makes C2 as CH2, C3 as CH(CH3), C4 as CH2, C5 as CH3. But butan-1-one is four carbons, so perhaps the structure is O=C- (cyclopentyl) - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH3. So, C3 would be CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), and H. So substituents on C3 are:

- CH2 (C2),
- CH3 (C4),
- H,
- and another CH3 (from the methyl group on C3).

Thus, C3 has two CH3 groups (from C4 and the substituent), so it's not a chiral center.

Are there any other chiral centers? Let's look at the cyclopentyl group. If the cyclopentyl group has a substituent that's asymmetric, then perhaps the point of attachment is a chiral center. But in this case, the cyclopentyl is attached to C1, which is the carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's trigonal, not tetrahedral, so it can't be a chiral center.

Therefore, this compound doesn't have any chiral centers and is not optically active.

Now, let's summarize each compound's optical activity:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers → Not optically active.
Wait, but earlier I wasn't sure. Let me recheck. If the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, then C2 is CH(CH3), connected via a double bond to C1 (CH2Cl) and single bonds to C3 (CH2) and perhaps a hydrogen. Wait, but in that case, C2 is attached to:

- CH2Cl (from C1),
- C(CH3),
- CH2 (from C3),
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, because if the double bond is between C1 and C2, then C2 is connected via double bond to C1. So, C2 has a double bond (so two substituents from that), a methyl group, and two other substituents. Wait, perhaps C2 has four substituents: CH2Cl (via double bond), CH3 (methyl), and two CH2 groups. But no, because the structure is more like CH2Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, perhaps C2 is CH2, connected to C1 (Cl), C3 (C(CH3)), and two Hs. No, that wouldn't have four different groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, making any potential chiral centers not present. So, I'll go with this compound not having any chiral centers → Not optically active.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Has chiral centers → Optically active. So count as 1.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: No chiral centers → Not active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Same as above → Not active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Chiral center at C1 → Active. Count 2.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Three chiral centers → Active. Count 3.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No chiral centers → Not active.

Wait, that's 3 active compounds (2,5,6). But let me recount.

Wait, number 2: active.

Number 5: active.

Number 6: active.

That's three. So, the total would be 3.

Wait, but what about the first compound? Did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene does have a chiral center. Let me think again. If the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, wait, but if the molecule is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2, the C(CH3) is connected via a double bond to CH2Cl. So, the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. No, wait, but that's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2.

Wait, so the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, C1: Cl, CH2, double bond to C2.

C2: C(CH3), double bond to C1, and single bonds to C3 (CH2) and C4 (CH3?).

Wait, but in this structure, C2 would have substituents:

- CH2Cl (from C1),
- CH(CH3),
- CH2 (from C3),
- and perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, no, because C2 is connected via double bond to C1, so it's part of a double bond, making it trigonal, not tetrahedral. So, C2 can't be a chiral center because it's double-bonded and thus can't have four substituents.

Therefore, no chiral centers in this compound → Not active.

So, the active ones are 2,5,6 → three compounds. So, answer is option B) 3.

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question here about optical activity in different compounds. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question asks how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity. The options are A to D, with the answer being one of them.

First, I remember that a compound exhibits optical activity if it has chiral centers. A chiral center is a carbon atom bonded to four different groups. So, my task is to check each compound one by one to see if they have any chiral centers.

Let's go through each compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
   Hmm, the formula is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? No, wait, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH2Cl? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Or perhaps it's CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3, right? So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon. So structure would be Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be CH2Cl-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait the but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro is CH2Cl-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait. But this is but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2.

Wait, maybe it's better to draw the structure. So 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would have Cl on C1, a double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl group on C2.

So structure: Cl attached to C1, which is double bonded to C2 (which has a methyl group), then C3 and C4.

Wait, but for C1, let's think: it's CHCl=CH(CH3)-CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons with double bond between 1 and 2. So for 2-methyl, the structure would be CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? But no, wait, but it's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between 1 and 2, so it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, that would be C1 (Cl), C2 (CH2), C3 (C(CH3)), and C4 (CH2). Wait, no, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3? No, wait, no. Wait, perhaps it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So the molecule is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Regardless of the structure, what's important is whether there are any chiral centers. So, does (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene have any chiral centers? Let's think. The molecule is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2? Wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 is attached to Cl and double bond. So for C1: what are the substituents? The double bond is between C1 and C2. So C1 has Cl, CH2-, and two other bonds? Wait, no, double bonds have two substituents. Let me think again.

But maybe it's easier to consider the structure as CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, it's Cl on C1, which is double bonded to C2 (with a methyl group). So the structure would be Cl-C double bond CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. Wait, but that's not possible because C1 is connected via double bond to C2. So the groups on C1 would be Cl, the double bond (so two substituents from that), and perhaps a hydrogen? Wait, but wait, for a double bond, each carbon is bonded to two other carbons and one substituent each. Hmm, perhaps C1 has Cl, a double bond to C2, and two Hs. Then, C1 would be CH2Cl, but no, wait, because but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl substituted on CH2. So it's Cl-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Oh wait, no, the double bond is between C1 and C2, so the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Hmm, but that can't be right because but-1-ene would have four carbons, so perhaps it's (Cl)CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3 with a double bond between C1 and C2.

Wait, maybe the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2. No, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should move on and come back. Alternatively, perhaps this compound doesn't have any chiral centers. Because the molecule is planar around the double bond, so any substituents would be on the same plane, meaning no possibility for a chiral center at C2. Or wait, perhaps C2 has a methyl group, a Cl on C1, a double bond, and another substituent. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Anyway, perhaps this compound doesn't have any chiral centers, making it not optically active.

Wait, but maybe I should think about this differently. If the molecule has a double bond, any possible chiral centers would be elsewhere. So, maybe the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, C1 is CHCl, but wait, no. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps this compound doesn't have any chiral centers because all the substituents on any carbon are the same. Wait, perhaps C2, which has the methyl group, is attached to C1 (double bond) and C3 and perhaps a hydrogen. So, if the substituents on C2 are CH3, CH2Cl (from C1), and two other CH2 groups, maybe not. Or maybe not, because the molecule is symmetric.

Wait, perhaps the key point is that for a molecule to be chiral, it must have a chiral center. So, if any of the carbons in the molecule has four different groups attached, then it's chiral.

For (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, perhaps looking at C2: it's attached to a methyl group, a double bond (so two substituents), and perhaps two other groups. Wait, but C2 is connected to C1 (double bond), C3 (single bond), and a methyl group. So, what are the substituents on C2? Let's see:

C2 would have: 
1. a double bond to C1 (so that's one substituent),
2. a single bond to C3,
3. a methyl group,
and perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, no, but but-1-ene is four carbons, so let's think again. The structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, structure would be Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3? No, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be Cl on the first carbon, which is in a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, the correct structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but that's four carbons: C1 (Cl and CH2), C2 (C(CH3) and double bond to C1), C3 (CH2), C4 (CH3)? No, that doesn't add up. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. So, it's CH2Cl-CH(CH3)=CH2CH3? No, that can't be right because the double bond can't be between C2 and C3 if it's but-1-ene.

Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on this one. Let me think of another approach. For a molecule to have optical activity, it needs to have at least one chiral center. So, let's look for that.

In 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but that's not possible because that would make it a five-carbon chain, but but-1-ene is four carbons. So, perhaps the correct structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, the molecule is Cl attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to a C(CH3), which is double-bonded to CH2. Wait, but that would be four carbons: Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, four carbons in total.

In that case, let's look at each carbon:

C1: Cl, two Hs, and a single bond to C2 (CH2Cl). So, C1 is CH2Cl. It's attached to two Hs, Cl, and a CH2 group leading to C2. So, four substituents? Wait, no, because CH2Cl is actually CH2Cl, which is two substituents (Cl and two Hs?), but wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, each carbon has four bonds. So, for C1, the structure is CH2Cl, which is -CH2Cl. So, C1 is CH2Cl: two Hs, a Cl, and a single bond to C2. So, substituents: Cl, H, H, and the rest is CH2 connected to C2.

C2 is C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, no. C2 is connected via a double bond to C1. So, C2 is CH(CH3), connected via a double bond to C1, and single bonds to C3 and perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps this molecule doesn't have any chiral centers because all the carbons are either in a double bond (so planar) or symmetric.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, making any potential chiral centers actually meso compounds, leading to no optical activity.

Moving on to the next compound.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**

Okay, this one seems complex. But, methanoisobenzofuran would have a fused ring structure. The substituents are at position 8 as chloromethylene (Cl-CH2-), and the configuration is given as (3aR,7aS,E). The E configuration refers to the double bond geometry.

Wait, methanoisobenzofuran is a bicyclic structure. Let me think: the 4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione would have two ketone groups at positions 1 and 3. The substituent at 8 is chloromethylene, which is Cl-CH2- attached as a substituent.

The configuration is given as (3aR,7aS,E). So, the molecule has stereocenters at 3a and 7a, both in the ring system. So, that would mean those positions are chiral centers. So, this compound has stereocenters and thus is chiral. But wait, does the E configuration affect optical activity? Hmm, the E or Z configuration refers to the arrangement around the double bond, which in this case is in the chloromethylene group. So, perhaps that doesn't contribute to a chiral center. But the ring substituents do.

So, this compound should be optically active because of the stereocenters (chiral centers) at 3a and 7a. But wait, if the molecule has two chiral centers, but are they in a meso form? For example, if the two stereocenters are mirror images, the molecule could be meso and not chiral. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say, but given that the configurations are R and S, perhaps they don't cancel each other out. So, I think this compound exhibits optical activity.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**

Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So, 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid would have methyl groups on the second and third carbons. So, the structure would be HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Now, the configurations are R and S at C2 and C3, respectively.

We need to check if these carbons are chiral centers. Let's look at each.

At C2: substituents are:
- one COOH group (from C1),
- two CH(CH3) groups (wait, no, C2 is attached to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two methyl groups? Wait, no, because 2,3-dimethyl would mean each of C2 and C3 have a methyl group.

Structure: HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, so C2 is attached to:
- C1 (COOH),
- C3 (CH(CH3)),
- two methyl groups? No, wait, each of C2 and C3 have a methyl group. So, each has two CH3 groups, and then two more substituents.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The structure is:
HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So, C2 is attached to:
- C1 (COOH),
- C3 (CH(CH3)),
- two CH3 groups?

Wait, that can't be right because each carbon can only have four bonds. So, let me correct that.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
O=C-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-C=O
    |        |
    O       O

Wait, no, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

So, each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) have a methyl group attached.

So, for C2:
- two methyl groups (from the dimethyl),
- the carbonyl groups on either side (from C1 and C3? No, wait, C2 is between C1 (COOH) and C3 (CH(CH3)).

Wait, no. Let me think of the structure as:

Carboxylic acid groups on C1 and C4.

So, C1: COOH,
C2: CH(CH3),
C3: CH(CH3),
C4: COOH.

So, C2 is attached to:
- C1 (COOH),
- C3 (CH(CH3)),
- and two methyl groups?

Wait, but that would make four substituents. So, substituents on C2 are:
- COOH (from C1),
- CH(CH3) (from C3),
- two CH3 groups?

Wait, that can't be right because that's four substituents, but perhaps the structure is such that C2 is CH(CH3) connected to C1 and C3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach it differently. Each of C2 and C3 has a methyl group. So, for C2, the substituents are:

1. COOH (from C1),
2. CH(CH3) (from C3),
3. two CH3 groups?

Wait, no, that's not possible because that would make four substituents, which is okay, but are they all different?

Wait, substituents on C2 would be:
- COOH (from C1),
- CH(CH3) (from C3),
- two methyl groups?

Wait, that would mean C2 has groups: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, and another CH3. Wait, but that can't be, because that would mean two identical substituents (two CH3 groups), making it not a chiral center.

Ah, wait! So, if C2 has two methyl groups, then the substituents are: COOH, CH(CH3), and two CH3 groups. But two substituents are the same, so C2 is not a chiral center. Similarly, C3 would have substituents: COOH (from C4?), CH(CH3) (from C2), and two CH3 groups. Wait, no, C3 is connected to C2 and C4. So, substituents would be:

For C3:
- CH(CH3) (from C2),
- COOH (from C4),
- two CH3 groups.

Again, two substituents are CH3, so C3 is not a chiral center. So, this compound doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active. Hmm, but wait, the question says (2R,3S), which implies that both C2 and C3 are stereocenters. But according to my previous analysis, they can't be, because they have two identical substituents. So, perhaps I'm wrong here. Or maybe the structure is different.

Wait, perhaps the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, so the two middle carbons each have a methyl group. But for each of these carbons, the substituents are:

C2: 
1. COOH (from C1),
2. CH(CH3) (from C3),
3. two CH3 groups? No, that's four substituents, but two are CH3, so they can't be four different groups. So, no, C2 is not a chiral center.

Thus, this compound doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active. But wait, the question states (2R,3S) configuration, which suggests that they are chiral centers. So, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH with methyl groups on C2 and C3. So, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH.

Wait, in that case, each of C2 and C3 would have substituents:

For C2:
- C1 (COOH),
- C3 (CH(CH3)),
- two CH3 groups.

Wait, but that would make two substituents as CH3, so C2 isn't a chiral center. Hmm, so perhaps this compound doesn't have any chiral centers, making it not optically active. But the question says (2R,3S), which implies they are stereocenters. So, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the structure is such that C2 has four different groups. Let me think again. If C2 is connected to:

- C1 (COOH),
- C3 (CH(CH3)),
- two different groups besides the methyl.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So C2 is CH(CH3), connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups. So substituents: COOH, CH(CH3), CH3, CH3. So, two CH3 groups, which are same, so C2 isn't a chiral center. Similarly for C3. So, this compound doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active.

Wait, but the question says (2R,3S), which suggests that the carbons are stereocenters. So perhaps the structure is different. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are different. Wait, perhaps the substituents are such that each has four different groups. But I'm not seeing it.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Alternatively, maybe the molecule has another group that makes it chiral. Wait, perhaps the two methyl groups are on adjacent carbons, but that doesn't change the fact that each has two methyl groups.

Wait, maybe the substituents on C2 are: COOH, CH(CH3), and two different groups. Wait, no, because C2 is connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two CH3 groups. So, four substituents. But two are same (CH3), so it's not a chiral center.

So, this compound doesn't have any chiral centers, so it's not optically active.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**

Same as the previous compound but with R configuration on both C2 and C3.

Wait, using the same reasoning as before, if C2 and C3 each have two methyl groups, then they aren't chiral centers. So this compound also doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it's not optically active.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**

Cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is a cyclohexene ring with an OH group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4.

Wait, the structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4, and an OH group on C1. Now, the configuration is R, which implies that the OH is in a specific configuration.

Now, for a cyclohexene ring with substituents, does it have any chiral centers? The OH is on C1. Let's look at the substituents on C1.

In cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, C1 has:

- OH group,
- two adjacent carbons (C2 and C6),
- and the ring structure.

Wait, but in a cyclohexene ring, each carbon is connected to two other ring carbons and two substituents. So, for C1, the substituents are OH, and three ring carbons. Wait, that can't be right because a carbon can't have five bonds. Wait, each carbon in the ring has two single bonds to adjacent ring carbons and two substituents. So, C1 is connected to C2 and C6 via single bonds, and has OH and a hydrogen (if the ring isn't substituted elsewhere). Wait, but wait, the double bond is between C3 and C4, which affects the structure.

The key here is whether C1 has four different substituents. Let's think: C1 is attached to:

- OH,
- two ring carbons (C2 and C6),
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, but that's four substituents: OH, H, C2, and C6. But wait, the ring is a six-membered ring with a double bond. So, is C1 a chiral center? Because if it has four different groups, then yes.

But wait, C2 and C6 are connected to the same type of groups. So, perhaps the substituents are: OH, H, and two identical ring groups (the adjacent carbons). But if C2 and C6 are the same, then C1 would have three substituents: OH, H, and the two ring carbons (which are same? No, wait, the ring is a cyclohexene, so perhaps the substituents on C2 and C6 are different because of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the ring is such that C2 is adjacent to the double bond, and C6 is not. So, C2 and C6 might have different substituents. Therefore, C1 would have four different substituents: OH, H, C2 (which is connected to the double bond), and C6 (which is not). Thus, C1 is a chiral center, making the compound optically active.

So, this compound should exhibit optical activity.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**

This is a cyclohexane ring with OH groups on C1, C3, and C5. The configurations are all s.

Now, a cyclohexane with three OH groups, each on alternating positions (1,3,5). Are any of these OH-bearing carbons chiral centers?

Each of these carbons (C1, C3, C5) is attached to:

- OH,
- two adjacent ring carbons (for C1: C2 and C6),
- and perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, but in a cyclohexane, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons via single bonds, and two other single bonds to substituents. So, for C1:

- OH,
- C2,
- C6,
- and H.

Wait, that's four substituents. Are any of them same? Let's see. The substituents are OH, H, C2, and C6. Are C2 and C6 different from each other? Well, in a cyclohexane ring, C2 is adjacent to C3, which has an OH group, and C6 is adjacent to C5, which also has an OH group. So, perhaps the substituents on C2 and C6 are different because their neighboring groups are different. Therefore, C1 would have four different groups: OH, H, C2 (which is connected to C3-OH), and C6 (connected to C5-OH). Thus, C1 is a chiral center.

Similarly, C3 and C5 would each have four different substituents, making them chiral centers as well. So, this compound has three chiral centers, making it optically active.

Wait, but wait, does the molecule have any symmetry? Because 1,3,5-triol on a cyclohexane ring could be a symmetric structure. For example, if all three OH groups are in positions that can be rotated into each other, the molecule could be achiral due to symmetry. But with all s configurations, perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but the configuration is (1s,3s,5s). Let me think about whether this creates a meso situation. For example, in a cyclohexane with three substituents, if the configurations lead to a plane of symmetry, the molecule could be achiral. But in this case, with all s configurations, perhaps the molecule is chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has an internal plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound. Hmm.

Wait, considering a cyclohexane ring with substituents on 1,3,5 positions, if the substituents are all the same (like OH), the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if you draw a plane through the center of the ring, perhaps the substituents mirror each other. But in this case, the configurations are all s. So, perhaps the molecule is chiral.

Wait, but let's imagine the substituents. Each of the OH groups is on a carbon, and the configuration is s. So, when you rotate the ring, perhaps the arrangement leads to no internal plane of symmetry, making the molecule chiral. So, this compound is optically active.

Alternatively, another approach: if the molecule has an even number of chiral centers, but they are arranged symmetrically, it could be a meso compound. But in this case, there are three chiral centers, which is odd, so it can't be a meso compound. Therefore, the molecule is chiral and optically active.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**

The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to C1 of a butan-1-one (which is (CH2)3-CO-). So, the full structure is (cyclopentyl)C(O)CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO with the ketone on C1. So, it's:

CO
|
C1 - (cyclopentyl) attached here.
Then, C2 is CH2, C3 is CH2, C4 is CH3.

Wait, no, butan-1-one is:

O
||
C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

Wait, butan-1-one is actually (CH2)3-CO. So, the structure is:

CO
|
C1 connected to cyclopentyl group and three other carbons?

Wait, perhaps it's (cyclopentyl)-C(O)-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3? No, because butan-1-one has four carbons, with the ketone on C1. So, structure is:

O
||
C1 (connected to cyclopentyl) - C2 - C3 - C4.

Wait, but the exact structure isn't critical. What matters is whether any carbon is a chiral center.

The carbonyl group is at C1, so it's a ketone. So, C1 is connected to:

- cyclopentyl,
- O,
- and two other carbons (C2 and C3? No, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO, so perhaps the structure is more accurately (cyclopentyl)C(O)CH2CH2CH2CH3? Wait, but that's five carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps it's (cyclopentyl) attached to C1, which is a ketone, and then three more CH2 groups.

Regardless, the key is to look for chiral centers. The cyclopentyl group is a ring, so any substituents on it would have their own chiral centers.

Wait, but the cyclopentyl group in this compound is attached to C1 as a substituent. So, C1 is attached to:

- cyclopentyl,
- the ketone oxygen,
- and perhaps two other groups. Wait, but in butan-1-one, the structure is (CH2)3-CO, so C1 is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O and connected to three other carbons. But in this case, one of those is replaced by the cyclopentyl group.

Wait, no. Wait, butan-1-one is:

CH2CH2CH2-CO.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

CO
|
C1 - cyclopentyl
|
C2 - CH2
|
C3 - CH2
|
C4 - CH3

Wait, no, butan-1-one is four carbons, so the structure is O=C-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3. So, the carbonyl is on C1, then C2, C3, C4, each with two Hs. So, in this case, C1 is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O and attached to C2 (CH2), and perhaps another group.

Wait, if the compound is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, then the structure is:

O
||
C1 (connected to cyclopentyl and C2)
C2 (CH2)
C3 (CH(CH3))
C4 (CH3)

Wait, that would make it:

O=C-(cyclopentyl)-CH2-C(CH3)H-CH3.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Let's think about the chiral centers.

Looking for any carbon with four different substituents.

The cyclopentyl group: if it's attached to C1, which is the carbonyl carbon, then C1's substituents are: cyclopentyl, O (from carbonyl), and two CH2 groups? Wait, no, because the carbonyl is double-bonded to O, so it can't have two CH2 groups attached. Wait, no, the carbonyl C is double-bonded to O and connected to two other groups. So, in the case of 1-cyclopentylbutan-1-one, the structure would be:

O
||
C1 (cyclopentyl, CH2-CH2-CH3)

Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO, so C1 is the carbonyl, connected to C2, which is CH2, C3 is CH2, C4 is CH3. So, 1-cyclopentyl would replace one of the Hs on C1 with a cyclopentyl group. So, C1 would have:

- O (double bond),
- cyclopentyl,
- C2 (CH2),
- and another substituent, which could be another CH2 group.

Wait, perhaps C1 has four substituents: O (double bond), cyclopentyl, CH2 (from C2), and another CH2 group? No, because C1 is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O and single-bonded to three other groups. Wait, no, a carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O and has two single bonds to other groups. So, in 1-cyclopentylbutan-1-one, C1 would be connected to:

- O (double bond),
- cyclopentyl,
- C2 (CH2),
- and another substituent, which would be another CH2 group, making it not a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure is such that C3 has a methyl group, making it a chiral center.

Wait, in 3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure is O=C-CH2-C(CH3)H-CH3. So, C3 has a methyl group, a CH2 from C2, a CH3 from C4, and a hydrogen. So, substituents on C3 would be: CH2 (from C2), CH(CH3), H, and CH3 (from C4)? Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, C3 in this structure would be CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), and a hydrogen. So, substituents are: CH2, CH3, H, and perhaps another group. Wait, wait, but that's four substituents, but are they all different?

Wait, substituents on C3 would be:

- CH2 (from C2),
- CH3 (from C4),
- H,
- and the methyl group (CH3) attached to C3.

Wait, no, because C3 has a methyl group, so substituents would be:

- CH2 (C2),
- CH(CH3) (C4?), no. Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-C(CH3)H-CH2-CH3, but that is pentan-1-one, not butan-1-one. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the structure as O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3. No, because that would be pentan-1-one. So, perhaps the correct structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2, but that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH3, which would make it 3-methylbutan-1-one. So, C3 is CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), and a hydrogen. So, substituents on C3 are:

- CH2 (from C2),
- CH3 (from C4),
- H,
- and the methyl group (CH3) attached to C3.

Wait, but that would make two substituents as CH3 (from C4 and the methyl group on C3), so C3 has two CH3 groups, making it not a chiral center.

Wait, but in the compound given, it's 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So, the structure is O=C- (cyclopentyl) - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH2 - CH3.

Wait, that makes C2 as CH2, C3 as CH(CH3), C4 as CH2, C5 as CH3. But butan-1-one is four carbons, so perhaps the structure is O=C- (cyclopentyl) - CH2 - CH(CH3) - CH3. So, C3 would be CH(CH3), connected to C2 (CH2), C4 (CH3), and H. So substituents on C3 are:

- CH2 (C2),
- CH3 (C4),
- H,
- and another CH3 (from the methyl group on C3).

Thus, C3 has two CH3 groups (from C4 and the substituent), so it's not a chiral center.

Are there any other chiral centers? Let's look at the cyclopentyl group. If the cyclopentyl group has a substituent that's asymmetric, then perhaps the point of attachment is a chiral center. But in this case, the cyclopentyl is attached to C1, which is the carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to O, so it's trigonal, not tetrahedral, so it can't be a chiral center.

Therefore, this compound doesn't have any chiral centers and is not optically active.

Now, let's summarize each compound's optical activity:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers → Not optically active.
Wait, but earlier I wasn't sure. Let me recheck. If the molecule is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2, then C2 is CH(CH3), connected via a double bond to C1 (CH2Cl) and single bonds to C3 (CH2) and perhaps a hydrogen. Wait, but in that case, C2 is attached to:

- CH2Cl (from C1),
- C(CH3),
- CH2 (from C3),
- and a hydrogen.

Wait, no, because if the double bond is between C1 and C2, then C2 is connected via double bond to C1. So, C2 has a double bond (so two substituents from that), a methyl group, and two other substituents. Wait, perhaps C2 has four substituents: CH2Cl (via double bond), CH3 (methyl), and two CH2 groups. But no, because the structure is more like CH2Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, perhaps C2 is CH2, connected to C1 (Cl), C3 (C(CH3)), and two Hs. No, that wouldn't have four different groups.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, making any potential chiral centers not present. So, I'll go with this compound not having any chiral centers → Not optically active.

2. (3aR,7aS,E)-... : Has chiral centers → Optically active. So count as 1.

3. (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: No chiral centers → Not active.

4. (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid: Same as above → Not active.

5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Chiral center at C1 → Active. Count 2.

6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Three chiral centers → Active. Count 3.

7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No chiral centers → Not active.

Wait, that's 3 active compounds (2,5,6). But let me recount.

Wait, number 2: active.

Number 5: active.

Number 6: active.

That's three. So, the total would be 3.

Wait, but what about the first compound? Did I miss something?

Wait, perhaps (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene does have a chiral center. Let me think again. If the structure is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2.

Wait, wait, but if the molecule is CH2Cl-C(CH3)=CH2, the C(CH3) is connected via a double bond to CH2Cl. So, the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. No, wait, but that's but-1-ene, so the double bond is between C1 and C2.

Wait, so the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2. So, C1: Cl, CH2, double bond to C2.

C2: C(CH3), double bond to C1, and single bonds to C3 (CH2) and C4 (CH3?).

Wait, but in this structure, C2 would have substituents:

- CH2Cl (from C1),
- CH(CH3),
- CH2 (from C3),
- and perhaps a hydrogen.

Wait, no, because C2 is connected via double bond to C1, so it's part of a double bond, making it trigonal, not tetrahedral. So, C2 can't be a chiral center because it's double-bonded and thus can't have four substituents.

Therefore, no chiral centers in this compound → Not active.

So, the active ones are 2,5,6 → three compounds. So, answer is option B) 3.
