Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stellar abundances. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem states that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, with masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. They've measured some elemental abundances using the EW method, which I remember stands for Equivalent Width. But I'm not sure how that ties into the problem right now.

The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh, right, the square brackets here denote logarithmic abundance ratios relative to hydrogen (H). So [X/Y] = log(n_X / n_Y) - log(n_X, n_Y in solar values? Or is it relative to some other standard? Wait, I think [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y, normalized to the Sun's values. So, [X/Y] = log(n_X / n_Y) - log(n_X_sun / n_Y_sun), which can also be written as log(n_X / n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

Wait, no, more accurately, [X/Y] is defined as log (n_X / n_Y) − log (n_X^sun / n_Y^sun). So it's the logarithmic abundance ratio between the star and the Sun. Or wait, maybe it's the logarithmic ratio relative to the Sun. Let me get this straight.

The Sun's photosphere has given compositions: 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7. So, that means the Sun's [Fe/H] would be log(nFe/nH) − log(nFe^sun / nH^sun). Wait, but the Sun's [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) relative to the Sun. So for the Sun, [Fe/H]_sun = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun / nH_sun). But since the Sun is the reference, [Fe/H]_sun is zero. So the way the problem presents the Sun's composition, we can use that to find the number densities.

Wait, let's break it down. For the Sun, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH for the Sun is 10^-4.5. Similarly, log(nMg/nH) =7 -12 = -5. So nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Now, for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0. Which means log(nFe/nH)_1 - log(nFe/nH)_sun = 0. So log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nH)_sun. Which implies that nFe/nH in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. So Star_1's Fe abundance is solar. Because [Fe/H] is zero.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun. Since in the Sun, nSi/nFe would be (nSi_sun / nFe_sun). Wait, but I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe]. Oh, wait, maybe I can compute it.

Wait, the Sun's composition is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 => log(nFe/nH) = -4.5. Similarly for Mg, log(nMg/nH) = -5. Hmm, but what about the Sun's [Si/Fe]? We can compute that from the Sun's data, but the problem doesn't give the Sun's [Si/Fe] directly. But maybe we can express [Si/Fe] in terms of the given data.

Wait, perhaps I should first think about what each star's abundances imply.

Let me parse each star's data:

For Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So Fe abundance is solar. So nFe_1 / nH_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * 10^[Fe/H]_1 → 10^0=1, so same as Sun.

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is higher than solar by a factor of 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So [Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) =0.3. So nSi_1 /nFe_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3. Because [X/Y] = log(nX_1/nY_1) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun) = log( (nX_1/nY_1) / (nX_sun/nY_sun) )) → so (nX_1/nY_1) = (nX_sun/nY_sun) * 10^([X/Y]).

So, nSi_1 /nFe_1 = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But wait, I don't have the Sun's nSi/nH. Oh, but maybe I can compute it using the Sun's data. Wait, the Sun's data is given as:

12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =-5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about nSi/nH? Hmm, I don't have that directly. So maybe I need to find the Sun's [Si/Fe] ratio. Because if I can find that, I can find nSi_1/nFe_1.

Wait, but the Sun's [Si/Fe] isn't provided. Hmm. Maybe I can compute it from the given solar data. Oh wait, I have nFe/nH and nMg/nH, but not nSi. Alternatively, perhaps I need to find nSi/nH for the Sun using some other approach.

Wait, perhaps I can relate Si and Mg. Because Star_2's [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. Let's look at Star_2's data.

Star_2:
- [Mg/H]_2 =0. So nMg_2 /nH_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * 10^0 = same as Sun.

So nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun. Which is 1e-5 as per the given data.

- [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. So log(nMg/nSi)_2 - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) =0.3. So (nMg_2 /nSi_2) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

Hmm, so for Star_2, the Mg/Si ratio is higher than solar by 10^0.3.

But again, without knowing the Sun's [Mg/Si], I can't proceed directly. Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] can be computed from its nMg and nSi. But I don't have the Sun's nSi. So perhaps I need to set up the problem with variables.

Let me define the following variables for the Sun:

nFe_sun = F, nH_sun = H.

Similarly, nMg_sun = M, nSi_sun = S.

But according to the given data for the Sun:

12 + log(F/H) =7.5 → log(F/H) = -4.5 → F/H = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log(M/H) =7 → log(M/H) =-5 → M/H=1e-5.

We don't know S/H, which is the solar silicon to hydrogen ratio. So perhaps we can express S in terms of F and M, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the abundances via the ratios provided for the stars.

Let me try to compute nSi_1 and nSi_2, and then find the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2.

Wait, the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So we need to compute (nSi_1)/(nSi_2).

Let me see how to get each of these.

For Star_1:

nFe_1 /nH_1 = (F/H) * 10^{[Fe/H]_1} = (F/H) *10^0 = F/H.

Because [Fe/H]_1 is 0.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log(S_sun / F_sun) +0.3.

Wait, because [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe) - log(S_sun / F_sun) =0.3.

So nSi_1/nFe_1 = (S_sun / F_sun) *10^0.3.

So nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (S_sun / F_sun) *10^0.3.

But nFe_1 = (F/H) *nH_1.

So nSi_1 = (F/H) *nH_1 * (S_sun/F_sun) *10^0.3.

Simplify: nSi_1 = (F * S_sun) / (H * F_sun) *nH_1 *10^0.3.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of the Sun's nH.

Wait, considering that in the Sun, F = F_sun, H = H_sun, M=M_sun, S=S_sun.

So, for Star_1, nFe_1 = (F/H) * nH_1.

But since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, nFe_1/nH_1 = F_sun/H_sun → nFe_1 = (F_sun/H_sun) *nH_1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 = (S_sun / F_sun) *10^0.3 → nSi_1= nFe_1 * (S_sun/F_sun) *10^0.3.

Substitute nFe_1: nSi_1 = (F_sun/H_sun) *nH_1 * (S_sun/F_sun) *10^0.3.

Simplify: (F_sun cancels) → (1/H_sun) *nH_1 * S_sun *10^0.3.

So nSi_1 = (nH_1 * S_sun )/(H_sun) ) *10^0.3 → [nH_1 / H_sun] * (S_sun / H_sun) ) *10^0.3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, maybe I should approach this differently.

Let me consider that in each star, the abundance ratios are given relative to hydrogen or another element. Maybe I can express [Si/Fe] in terms of [Fe/H], but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express all the nX in terms of nH, and then find the ratio of nSi_1 to nSi_2.

For Star_1:

nFe_1 = (F/H) *nH_1. Since [Fe/H]_1=0 → F/H = F_sun/H_sun → nFe_1 = (F_sun/H_sun) *nH_1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1 /nFe_1) = log(S_sun/F_sun) +0.3.

So nSi_1/nFe_1 = (S_sun/F_sun) *10^0.3 → nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (S_sun/F_sun) *10^0.3.

Substituting nFe_1:

nSi_1 = (F_sun/H_sun) *nH_1 * (S_sun/F_sun) *10^0.3 → (S_sun / H_sun) *nH_1 *10^0.3.

So, nSi_1 = (nH_1 / H_sun) * S_sun *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2.

Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = M_sun/H_sun → nMg_2 = (M_sun/H_sun) *nH_2.

And [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(M_sun/S_sun) +0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 = (M_sun/S_sun) *10^0.3 → nSi_2 = nMg_2 * (S_sun/M_sun) /10^0.3.

Substituting nMg_2:

nSi_2 = (M_sun/H_sun) *nH_2 * (S_sun/M_sun) /10^0.3 → (S_sun / H_sun) *nH_2 /10^0.3.

So, nSi_2 = (nH_2 / H_sun) * S_sun /10^0.3.

Now, we can write the ratio (nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = [ (nH_1 / H_sun) * S_sun *10^0.3 ] / [ (nH_2 / H_sun) * S_sun /10^0.3 ].

Simplify this:

= [ (nH_1) * 10^0.3 ] / [ (nH_2) /10^0.3 ]

= (nH_1 / nH_2) * (10^0.3)^2.

Hmm, but I don't know the ratio of nH_1 to nH_2. Oh wait, but in stars, the total number of hydrogen atoms is roughly determined by the star's evolutionary state, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that both stars have the same hydrogen abundance, but that's probably not correct.

Wait, but looking at the problem again, the question is about silicon abundance ratio. But perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the total hydrogen is the same in both stars, or that the ratio of H doesn't affect the calculation. Alternatively, maybe the ratio of H is accounted for in the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means that the Fe/H ratio is solar. So, for Star_1, nFe_1 = (F_sun / H_sun) *nH_1. But without knowing nH_1 and nH_2, perhaps we can find the ratio nH_1/nH_2.

Wait, but perhaps the stars have the same overall metallicity? No, probably not. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved without considering nH_1 and nH_2 because the ratio of H cancels out. Let me check.

Wait, looking back at the expression for the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2):

= (nH_1 / nH_2) * (10^0.3)^2.

Hmm, so without knowing the ratio of nH_1 to nH_2, I can't compute this. That's a problem. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, maybe I can find (nH_1 / nH_2) from the given data. Let me think. For Star_1, [Fe/H] =0, which implies nFe_1 = (F_sun/H_sun) *nH_1. But I don't know nH_1 directly. For Star_2, [Mg/H] =0 → nMg_2 = (M_sun/H_sun) *nH_2.

But again, without knowing the actual number of H atoms, I can't find the ratio. Wait, perhaps I can relate nH_1 and nH_2 via another ratio. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the stars' hydrogen abundances are the same, which would make (nH_1/nH_2) =1. I don't know if that's a valid assumption, but maybe that's what's intended.

If (nH_1/nH_2)=1, then the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) = (10^0.3)^2.

What's 10^0.3? Approximately 2. So 2 squared is 4. So the ratio would be about 4. But let me calculate more accurately.

10^0.3 is the same as e^(0.3 * ln10) ≈ e^(0.3*2.302585) ≈ e^0.690775 ≈ 2. So 10^0.3 ≈ 2, so (10^0.3)^2 is 4. So (nSi_1/nSi_2)≈4.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which is close to 4. Hmm, that's an option.

But wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption that (nH_1/nH_2)=1. Because that's a big assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find (nH_1/nH_2) using other abundance ratios. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps considering that the mass of the star relates to the overall abundance, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the mass doesn't directly affect the photospheric composition, assuming LTE and uniform mixing, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem says "using the EW method, astronomers have determined the elemental abundances." So maybe the star's mass doesn't influence the elemental ratios in this context, so the H abundance isn't a factor. Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars, but that's not something we can assume.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that the H abundance cancels out in the ratio. Let me check again.

Wait, the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) is:

[ (nH_1 / H_sun) * S_sun *10^0.3 ] / [ (nH_2 / H_sun) * S_sun /10^0.3 ]

= (nH_1 *10^0.3) / (nH_2 /10^0.3) )

= (nH_1 / nH_2) * (10^0.3)^2.

If that's the case, then without knowing (nH_1/nH_2), I can't solve this. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, maybe I made a wrong substitution earlier. Let me re-express nSi_1 and nSi_2.

Another approach: Express all elements in terms of H.

For Star_1:

nFe_1 = (F_sun/H_sun) *nH_1.

nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (S_sun / F_sun) *10^0.3 → nSi_1 = (F_sun/H_sun) *nH_1 * (S_sun/F_sun) *10^0.3 → nSi_1 = (S_sun / H_sun) *nH_1 *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

nMg_2 = (M_sun/H_sun) *nH_2.

nSi_2 = (nMg_2) * (S_sun/M_sun) /10^0.3 → nSi_2 = (M_sun/H_sun) *nH_2 * (S_sun/M_sun) /10^0.3 → nSi_2 = (S_sun / H_sun) *nH_2 /10^0.3.

Now, taking the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2:

(nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = [ (S_sun / H_sun) *nH_1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (S_sun / H_sun) *nH_2 /10^0.3 ]

The (S_sun / H_sun) terms cancel. So,

= [nH_1 *10^0.3 ] / [nH_2 /10^0.3 ]

= (nH_1 / nH_2) * (10^0.3 * 10^0.3) → (nH_1 / nH_2) * (10^0.6).

Hmm, so again, this leads me back to the same point. Without knowing (nH_1/nH_2), I can't find the ratio.

Wait, but perhaps I can find (nH_1/nH_2) from the stars' other abundances.

Wait, let's think about the fact that in Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, so nFe_1 = (F_sun/H_sun) *nH_1. Similarly, in Star_2, [Mg/H] is 0, so nMg_2 = (M_sun/H_sun) *nH_2.

But I don't see a direct way to find (nH_1/nH_2) from this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the H ratio cancels out. Let me think about the problem again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier substitution. Let me try again.

Wait, another approach: Let's calculate the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) in terms of the Sun's values and the given ratios.

nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (S_sun/F_sun) *10^0.3.

nFe_1 = (F_sun/H_sun) *nH_1 → So, nSi_1 = (F_sun/H_sun) *nH_1 * (S_sun/F_sun) *10^0.3.

Which simplifies to: (S_sun / H_sun) *nH_1 *10^0.3.

Similarly, for nSi_2:

nSi_2 = (nMg_2) * (S_sun/M_sun) /10^0.3.

nMg_2 = (M_sun/H_sun) *nH_2 → So, nSi_2 = (M_sun/H_sun) *nH_2 * (S_sun/M_sun) /10^0.3.

Which simplifies to: (S_sun / H_sun) *nH_2 /10^0.3.

Now, taking the ratio again:

nSi_1/nSi_2 = [ (S_sun / H_sun) *nH_1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (S_sun / H_sun) *nH_2 /10^0.3 ]

= [nH_1 *10^0.3 ] / [nH_2 /10^0.3 ]

= (nH_1 /nH_2) * 10^0.6.

Hmm, same as before. But without knowing (nH_1/nH_2), I can't proceed. So perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Wait, maybe I can relate nH_1 and nH_2 through other elements. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that Star_1 and Star_2 have different masses, but I don't think that affects the elemental ratios directly. The problem doesn't provide data on H abundances, so perhaps the ratio of H is 1, making (nH_1/nH_2)=1.

Assuming that, then the ratio becomes 10^0.6. Let me calculate 0.6 in log base 10 is about 3.98, because 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98. So the ratio is approximately 3.98, which is close to option A) ~3.9.

So the answer would be A.

But wait, why would (nH_1/nH_2) be 1? Because [Fe/H]_1 is 0 and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Does that imply that their H abundance is the same as the Sun? Or that their H abundances relative to each other are the same?

Hmm, maybe not. But given that the options include ~3.9, which matches 10^0.6, and without more data, perhaps that's the intended solution.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the relationships between the number densities of elements. The problem provides the following key data:

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0: Fe abundance relative to H is solar.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3: Si/Fe ratio is 10^0.3 ≈ 2 times solar.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0: Mg/H ratio is solar.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3: Mg/Si ratio is 10^0.3 ≈ 2 times solar.

3. **Solar Photosphere**:
   - 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5).
   - 12 + log(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5).

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- From [Fe/H]_1 = 0, the Fe abundance relative to H is solar:  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Fe,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}}.
  \]
- From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, the Si/Fe ratio is 10^0.3 ≈ 2 times solar:  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Fe,1}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe,sun}}}.
  \]
- Substituting \(n_{\text{Fe,1}} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}}\), we get:  
  \[
  n_{\text{Si,1}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}} \cdot 10^{0.3}.
  \]

#### For Star_2:
- From [Mg/H]_2 = 0, the Mg/H ratio is solar:  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}}.
  \]
- From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, the Mg/Si ratio is 10^0.3 ≈ 2 times solar:  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg,sun}}}{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}.
  \]
- Substituting \(n_{\text{Mg,2}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}}\), we get:  
  \[
  n_{\text{Si,2}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}} \cdot 10^{-0.3}.
  \]

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is:  
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}} \cdot 10^{0.3}\right)}{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}} \cdot 10^{-0.3}\right)}.
\]
Simplifying:  
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} \cdot 10^{0.6}.
\]

#### Assumption:
The problem does not provide explicit data on the hydrogen abundance ratio (\(n_{\text{H,1}}/n_{\text{H,2}}\)). Assuming \(n_{\text{H,1}}/n_{\text{H,2}} = 1\) (i.e., the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars), the ratio simplifies to:  
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

#### Calculation:
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \approx 3.9.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here about stellar abundances. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem states that there are two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, with masses 1.5 and 1.2 times that of the Sun, respectively. They've measured some elemental abundances using the EW method, which I remember stands for Equivalent Width. But I'm not sure how that ties into the problem right now.

The given abundances are [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex, [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex, [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex, and [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex. Oh, right, the square brackets here denote logarithmic abundance ratios relative to hydrogen (H). So [X/Y] = log(n_X / n_Y) - log(n_X, n_Y in solar values? Or is it relative to some other standard? Wait, I think [X/Y] is the logarithm of the ratio of the number densities of X to Y, normalized to the Sun's values. So, [X/Y] = log(n_X / n_Y) - log(n_X_sun / n_Y_sun), which can also be written as log(n_X / n_Y) - log(n_X/n_Y)_sun.

Wait, no, more accurately, [X/Y] is defined as log (n_X / n_Y) − log (n_X^sun / n_Y^sun). So it's the logarithmic abundance ratio between the star and the Sun. Or wait, maybe it's the logarithmic ratio relative to the Sun. Let me get this straight.

The Sun's photosphere has given compositions: 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 and 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7. So, that means the Sun's [Fe/H] would be log(nFe/nH) − log(nFe^sun / nH^sun). Wait, but the Sun's [Fe/H] is log(nFe/nH) relative to the Sun. So for the Sun, [Fe/H]_sun = log(nFe/nH) - log(nFe_sun / nH_sun). But since the Sun is the reference, [Fe/H]_sun is zero. So the way the problem presents the Sun's composition, we can use that to find the number densities.

Wait, let's break it down. For the Sun, 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5. So, log(nFe/nH) =7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH for the Sun is 10^-4.5. Similarly, log(nMg/nH) =7 -12 = -5. So nMg/nH = 1e-5.

Now, for Star_1: [Fe/H]_1 = 0. Which means log(nFe/nH)_1 - log(nFe/nH)_sun = 0. So log(nFe/nH)_1 = log(nFe/nH)_sun. Which implies that nFe/nH in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. So Star_1's Fe abundance is solar. Because [Fe/H] is zero.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 is 0.3. So [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe)_1 - log(nSi/nFe)_sun. Since in the Sun, nSi/nFe would be (nSi_sun / nFe_sun). Wait, but I don't have the Sun's [Si/Fe]. Oh, wait, maybe I can compute it.

Wait, the Sun's composition is given as 12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 => log(nFe/nH) = -4.5. Similarly for Mg, log(nMg/nH) = -5. Hmm, but what about the Sun's [Si/Fe]? We can compute that from the Sun's data, but the problem doesn't give the Sun's [Si/Fe] directly. But maybe we can express [Si/Fe] in terms of the given data.

Wait, perhaps I should first think about what each star's abundances imply.

Let me parse each star's data:

For Star_1:
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0. So Fe abundance is solar. So nFe_1 / nH_1 = (nFe_sun / nH_sun) * 10^[Fe/H]_1 → 10^0=1, so same as Sun.

- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means the ratio of Si to Fe in Star_1 is higher than solar by a factor of 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So [Si/Fe] = log(nSi/nFe) - log(nSi_sun / nFe_sun) =0.3. So nSi_1 /nFe_1 = (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) * 10^0.3. Because [X/Y] = log(nX_1/nY_1) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun) = log( (nX_1/nY_1) / (nX_sun/nY_sun) )) → so (nX_1/nY_1) = (nX_sun/nY_sun) * 10^([X/Y]).

So, nSi_1 /nFe_1 = (nSi_sun /nFe_sun) * 10^0.3.

But wait, I don't have the Sun's nSi/nH. Oh, but maybe I can compute it using the Sun's data. Wait, the Sun's data is given as:

12 + log(nFe/nH) =7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 1e-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5.

Similarly, 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH) =-5 → nMg/nH=1e-5.

But what about nSi/nH? Hmm, I don't have that directly. So maybe I need to find the Sun's [Si/Fe] ratio. Because if I can find that, I can find nSi_1/nFe_1.

Wait, but the Sun's [Si/Fe] isn't provided. Hmm. Maybe I can compute it from the given solar data. Oh wait, I have nFe/nH and nMg/nH, but not nSi. Alternatively, perhaps I need to find nSi/nH for the Sun using some other approach.

Wait, perhaps I can relate Si and Mg. Because Star_2's [Mg/Si]_2 is 0.3. Let's look at Star_2's data.

Star_2:
- [Mg/H]_2 =0. So nMg_2 /nH_2 = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) * 10^0 = same as Sun.

So nMg_2/nH_2 = nMg_sun/nH_sun. Which is 1e-5 as per the given data.

- [Mg/Si]_2 =0.3. So log(nMg/nSi)_2 - log(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) =0.3. So (nMg_2 /nSi_2) = (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) *10^0.3.

Hmm, so for Star_2, the Mg/Si ratio is higher than solar by 10^0.3.

But again, without knowing the Sun's [Mg/Si], I can't proceed directly. Wait, the Sun's [Mg/Si] can be computed from its nMg and nSi. But I don't have the Sun's nSi. So perhaps I need to set up the problem with variables.

Let me define the following variables for the Sun:

nFe_sun = F, nH_sun = H.

Similarly, nMg_sun = M, nSi_sun = S.

But according to the given data for the Sun:

12 + log(F/H) =7.5 → log(F/H) = -4.5 → F/H = 1e-4.5.

Similarly, 12 + log(M/H) =7 → log(M/H) =-5 → M/H=1e-5.

We don't know S/H, which is the solar silicon to hydrogen ratio. So perhaps we can express S in terms of F and M, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the abundances via the ratios provided for the stars.

Let me try to compute nSi_1 and nSi_2, and then find the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2.

Wait, the question is asking for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So we need to compute (nSi_1)/(nSi_2).

Let me see how to get each of these.

For Star_1:

nFe_1 /nH_1 = (F/H) * 10^{[Fe/H]_1} = (F/H) *10^0 = F/H.

Because [Fe/H]_1 is 0.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1/nFe_1) = log(S_sun / F_sun) +0.3.

Wait, because [Si/Fe] is log(nSi/nFe) - log(S_sun / F_sun) =0.3.

So nSi_1/nFe_1 = (S_sun / F_sun) *10^0.3.

So nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (S_sun / F_sun) *10^0.3.

But nFe_1 = (F/H) *nH_1.

So nSi_1 = (F/H) *nH_1 * (S_sun/F_sun) *10^0.3.

Simplify: nSi_1 = (F * S_sun) / (H * F_sun) *nH_1 *10^0.3.

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of the Sun's nH.

Wait, considering that in the Sun, F = F_sun, H = H_sun, M=M_sun, S=S_sun.

So, for Star_1, nFe_1 = (F/H) * nH_1.

But since [Fe/H]_1 is 0, nFe_1/nH_1 = F_sun/H_sun → nFe_1 = (F_sun/H_sun) *nH_1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → nSi_1/nFe_1 = (S_sun / F_sun) *10^0.3 → nSi_1= nFe_1 * (S_sun/F_sun) *10^0.3.

Substitute nFe_1: nSi_1 = (F_sun/H_sun) *nH_1 * (S_sun/F_sun) *10^0.3.

Simplify: (F_sun cancels) → (1/H_sun) *nH_1 * S_sun *10^0.3.

So nSi_1 = (nH_1 * S_sun )/(H_sun) ) *10^0.3 → [nH_1 / H_sun] * (S_sun / H_sun) ) *10^0.3.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, maybe I should approach this differently.

Let me consider that in each star, the abundance ratios are given relative to hydrogen or another element. Maybe I can express [Si/Fe] in terms of [Fe/H], but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express all the nX in terms of nH, and then find the ratio of nSi_1 to nSi_2.

For Star_1:

nFe_1 = (F/H) *nH_1. Since [Fe/H]_1=0 → F/H = F_sun/H_sun → nFe_1 = (F_sun/H_sun) *nH_1.

Similarly, [Si/Fe]_1 =0.3 → log(nSi_1 /nFe_1) = log(S_sun/F_sun) +0.3.

So nSi_1/nFe_1 = (S_sun/F_sun) *10^0.3 → nSi_1 = nFe_1 * (S_sun/F_sun) *10^0.3.

Substituting nFe_1:

nSi_1 = (F_sun/H_sun) *nH_1 * (S_sun/F_sun) *10^0.3 → (S_sun / H_sun) *nH_1 *10^0.3.

So, nSi_1 = (nH_1 / H_sun) * S_sun *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2.

Star_2 has [Mg/H]_2=0 → nMg_2/nH_2 = M_sun/H_sun → nMg_2 = (M_sun/H_sun) *nH_2.

And [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log(nMg_2/nSi_2) = log(M_sun/S_sun) +0.3 → nMg_2/nSi_2 = (M_sun/S_sun) *10^0.3 → nSi_2 = nMg_2 * (S_sun/M_sun) /10^0.3.

Substituting nMg_2:

nSi_2 = (M_sun/H_sun) *nH_2 * (S_sun/M_sun) /10^0.3 → (S_sun / H_sun) *nH_2 /10^0.3.

So, nSi_2 = (nH_2 / H_sun) * S_sun /10^0.3.

Now, we can write the ratio (nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = [ (nH_1 / H_sun) * S_sun *10^0.3 ] / [ (nH_2 / H_sun) * S_sun /10^0.3 ].

Simplify this:

= [ (nH_1) * 10^0.3 ] / [ (nH_2) /10^0.3 ]

= (nH_1 / nH_2) * (10^0.3)^2.

Hmm, but I don't know the ratio of nH_1 to nH_2. Oh wait, but in stars, the total number of hydrogen atoms is roughly determined by the star's evolutionary state, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that both stars have the same hydrogen abundance, but that's probably not correct.

Wait, but looking at the problem again, the question is about silicon abundance ratio. But perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the total hydrogen is the same in both stars, or that the ratio of H doesn't affect the calculation. Alternatively, maybe the ratio of H is accounted for in the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, because [Fe/H]_1 is 0, which means that the Fe/H ratio is solar. So, for Star_1, nFe_1 = (F_sun / H_sun) *nH_1. But without knowing nH_1 and nH_2, perhaps we can find the ratio nH_1/nH_2.

Wait, but perhaps the stars have the same overall metallicity? No, probably not. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved without considering nH_1 and nH_2 because the ratio of H cancels out. Let me check.

Wait, looking back at the expression for the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2):

= (nH_1 / nH_2) * (10^0.3)^2.

Hmm, so without knowing the ratio of nH_1 to nH_2, I can't compute this. That's a problem. Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, maybe I can find (nH_1 / nH_2) from the given data. Let me think. For Star_1, [Fe/H] =0, which implies nFe_1 = (F_sun/H_sun) *nH_1. But I don't know nH_1 directly. For Star_2, [Mg/H] =0 → nMg_2 = (M_sun/H_sun) *nH_2.

But again, without knowing the actual number of H atoms, I can't find the ratio. Wait, perhaps I can relate nH_1 and nH_2 via another ratio. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the stars' hydrogen abundances are the same, which would make (nH_1/nH_2) =1. I don't know if that's a valid assumption, but maybe that's what's intended.

If (nH_1/nH_2)=1, then the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) = (10^0.3)^2.

What's 10^0.3? Approximately 2. So 2 squared is 4. So the ratio would be about 4. But let me calculate more accurately.

10^0.3 is the same as e^(0.3 * ln10) ≈ e^(0.3*2.302585) ≈ e^0.690775 ≈ 2. So 10^0.3 ≈ 2, so (10^0.3)^2 is 4. So (nSi_1/nSi_2)≈4.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which is close to 4. Hmm, that's an option.

But wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption that (nH_1/nH_2)=1. Because that's a big assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find (nH_1/nH_2) using other abundance ratios. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps considering that the mass of the star relates to the overall abundance, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that the mass doesn't directly affect the photospheric composition, assuming LTE and uniform mixing, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem says "using the EW method, astronomers have determined the elemental abundances." So maybe the star's mass doesn't influence the elemental ratios in this context, so the H abundance isn't a factor. Alternatively, perhaps the H abundance is the same in both stars, but that's not something we can assume.

Wait, perhaps the problem is designed such that the H abundance cancels out in the ratio. Let me check again.

Wait, the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) is:

[ (nH_1 / H_sun) * S_sun *10^0.3 ] / [ (nH_2 / H_sun) * S_sun /10^0.3 ]

= (nH_1 *10^0.3) / (nH_2 /10^0.3) )

= (nH_1 / nH_2) * (10^0.3)^2.

If that's the case, then without knowing (nH_1/nH_2), I can't solve this. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, maybe I made a wrong substitution earlier. Let me re-express nSi_1 and nSi_2.

Another approach: Express all elements in terms of H.

For Star_1:

nFe_1 = (F_sun/H_sun) *nH_1.

nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (S_sun / F_sun) *10^0.3 → nSi_1 = (F_sun/H_sun) *nH_1 * (S_sun/F_sun) *10^0.3 → nSi_1 = (S_sun / H_sun) *nH_1 *10^0.3.

Similarly, for Star_2:

nMg_2 = (M_sun/H_sun) *nH_2.

nSi_2 = (nMg_2) * (S_sun/M_sun) /10^0.3 → nSi_2 = (M_sun/H_sun) *nH_2 * (S_sun/M_sun) /10^0.3 → nSi_2 = (S_sun / H_sun) *nH_2 /10^0.3.

Now, taking the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2:

(nSi_1)/(nSi_2) = [ (S_sun / H_sun) *nH_1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (S_sun / H_sun) *nH_2 /10^0.3 ]

The (S_sun / H_sun) terms cancel. So,

= [nH_1 *10^0.3 ] / [nH_2 /10^0.3 ]

= (nH_1 / nH_2) * (10^0.3 * 10^0.3) → (nH_1 / nH_2) * (10^0.6).

Hmm, so again, this leads me back to the same point. Without knowing (nH_1/nH_2), I can't find the ratio.

Wait, but perhaps I can find (nH_1/nH_2) from the stars' other abundances.

Wait, let's think about the fact that in Star_1, [Fe/H] is 0, so nFe_1 = (F_sun/H_sun) *nH_1. Similarly, in Star_2, [Mg/H] is 0, so nMg_2 = (M_sun/H_sun) *nH_2.

But I don't see a direct way to find (nH_1/nH_2) from this.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that the H ratio cancels out. Let me think about the problem again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier substitution. Let me try again.

Wait, another approach: Let's calculate the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2) in terms of the Sun's values and the given ratios.

nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (S_sun/F_sun) *10^0.3.

nFe_1 = (F_sun/H_sun) *nH_1 → So, nSi_1 = (F_sun/H_sun) *nH_1 * (S_sun/F_sun) *10^0.3.

Which simplifies to: (S_sun / H_sun) *nH_1 *10^0.3.

Similarly, for nSi_2:

nSi_2 = (nMg_2) * (S_sun/M_sun) /10^0.3.

nMg_2 = (M_sun/H_sun) *nH_2 → So, nSi_2 = (M_sun/H_sun) *nH_2 * (S_sun/M_sun) /10^0.3.

Which simplifies to: (S_sun / H_sun) *nH_2 /10^0.3.

Now, taking the ratio again:

nSi_1/nSi_2 = [ (S_sun / H_sun) *nH_1 *10^0.3 ] / [ (S_sun / H_sun) *nH_2 /10^0.3 ]

= [nH_1 *10^0.3 ] / [nH_2 /10^0.3 ]

= (nH_1 /nH_2) * 10^0.6.

Hmm, same as before. But without knowing (nH_1/nH_2), I can't proceed. So perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way.

Wait, maybe I can relate nH_1 and nH_2 through other elements. Let's see.

Wait, perhaps using the fact that Star_1 and Star_2 have different masses, but I don't think that affects the elemental ratios directly. The problem doesn't provide data on H abundances, so perhaps the ratio of H is 1, making (nH_1/nH_2)=1.

Assuming that, then the ratio becomes 10^0.6. Let me calculate 0.6 in log base 10 is about 3.98, because 10^0.6 ≈ 3.98. So the ratio is approximately 3.98, which is close to option A) ~3.9.

So the answer would be A.

But wait, why would (nH_1/nH_2) be 1? Because [Fe/H]_1 is 0 and [Mg/H]_2 is 0. Does that imply that their H abundance is the same as the Sun? Or that their H abundances relative to each other are the same?

Hmm, maybe not. But given that the options include ~3.9, which matches 10^0.6, and without more data, perhaps that's the intended solution.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the relationships between the number densities of elements. The problem provides the following key data:

### Key Data:
1. **Star_1**:
   - [Fe/H]_1 = 0: Fe abundance relative to H is solar.
   - [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3: Si/Fe ratio is 10^0.3 ≈ 2 times solar.

2. **Star_2**:
   - [Mg/H]_2 = 0: Mg/H ratio is solar.
   - [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3: Mg/Si ratio is 10^0.3 ≈ 2 times solar.

3. **Solar Photosphere**:
   - 12 + log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → log(nFe/nH) = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5).
   - 12 + log(nMg/nH) = 7 → log(nMg/nH) = -5 → nMg/nH = 10^(-5).

### Analysis:
#### For Star_1:
- From [Fe/H]_1 = 0, the Fe abundance relative to H is solar:  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Fe,1}}}{n_{\text{H,1}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}}.
  \]
- From [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3, the Si/Fe ratio is 10^0.3 ≈ 2 times solar:  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Fe,1}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe,sun}}}.
  \]
- Substituting \(n_{\text{Fe,1}} = \frac{n_{\text{Fe,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}}\), we get:  
  \[
  n_{\text{Si,1}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}} \cdot 10^{0.3}.
  \]

#### For Star_2:
- From [Mg/H]_2 = 0, the Mg/H ratio is solar:  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}}.
  \]
- From [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3, the Mg/Si ratio is 10^0.3 ≈ 2 times solar:  
  \[
  \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg,sun}}}{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}.
  \]
- Substituting \(n_{\text{Mg,2}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}}\), we get:  
  \[
  n_{\text{Si,2}} = \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}} \cdot 10^{-0.3}.
  \]

#### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is:  
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}} \cdot 10^{0.3}\right)}{\left(\frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}} \cdot 10^{-0.3}\right)}.
\]
Simplifying:  
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}} \cdot 10^{0.6}.
\]

#### Assumption:
The problem does not provide explicit data on the hydrogen abundance ratio (\(n_{\text{H,1}}/n_{\text{H,2}}\)). Assuming \(n_{\text{H,1}}/n_{\text{H,2}} = 1\) (i.e., the hydrogen abundance is the same in both stars), the ratio simplifies to:  
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.6}.
\]

#### Calculation:
\[
10^{0.6} \approx 3.98 \approx 3.9.
\]

### Conclusion:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is approximately **3.9**.

**Answer: A**
