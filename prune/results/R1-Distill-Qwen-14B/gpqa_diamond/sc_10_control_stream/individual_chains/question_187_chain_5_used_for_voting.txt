Okay, so I need to figure out how many of these stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph when used with an 8m VLT telescope. The condition is a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the ESPRESSO spectrograph is used for high-resolution spectroscopy. Its performance depends on several factors like the brightness of the star, the exposure time, and the telescope's collecting area.

The stars given are options a to f. Let me list them again:

a) Canopus
b) Polaris
c) Star with RA 0, DEC 0, Absolute V mag 15, 10 pc
d) Same RA, DEC, V mag 15, 200 pc
e) Same, 5 pc
f) Same, 50 pc

I think I need to figure out the apparent magnitude of each star because the S/N ratio depends on how bright the star appears from Earth.

Wait, right. The formula for apparent magnitude (m) is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs. Or wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me recall the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5. Because when d=10 pc, m = M.

So for each star, their M is 15, except a and b, which are Canopus and Polaris. I need to find their apparent magnitudes.

Wait, but for a), Canopus. I think Canopus is a bright star, probably a main-sequence or maybe a supergiant. I remember that Canopus is one of the brightest stars in the sky, so it's probably a very low apparent magnitude. Let me check—Wait, I think Canopus has an apparent magnitude around -0.7, making it one of the brightest. So m is about -0.7.

For b), Polaris. Hmm, Polaris is the North Star. I think its apparent magnitude is around 2. But wait, isn't it a bit dimmer? Maybe around 2. But I might be mixing it up with other stars. Alternatively, maybe Polaris is about 1.8 to 2.0. I'm not certain, but let's say m is about 2.0 for Polaris.

Now, options c to f all have the same absolute magnitude (15) but different distances. So let's compute their m.

For c), distance is 10 pc. So m = 15 + 5 log10(10) -5. Log10(10)=1. So m=15 +5(1) -5=15+5-5=15. So m=15.

Wait, but that's same as absolute magnitude. Because when d=10 pc, m = M.

For option e) same M, d=5 pc. So m = 15 +5 log10(5) -5. Log10(5)=0.69897. So 5*0.69897≈3.4949. So m=15 +3.4949 -5=13.4949. So about 13.5.

For f) d=50 pc. Log10(50)=1.69897. 5 * that is 8.49485. So m=15 +8.49485 -5=18.49485. So about 18.5.

d) is 200 pc. Log10(200)=2.3010. 5 *2.3010=11.505. So m=15+11.505-5=21.505. So about 21.5.

Wait, but wait. ESPRESSO's performance depends on the S/N per exposure. I think the S/N is higher for brighter stars (lower apparent magnitude). But I'm not exactly sure about the exact S/N for each magnitude. I need to find out what the S/N of 10 per binned pixel implies about the apparent magnitude.

I remember that the signal-to-noise ratio for a star with apparent magnitude m, when observed with a spectrograph, can be calculated based on the photon flux. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Alternatively, I think there's a standard way to estimate S/N based on the magnitude and exposure time.

Wait, the basic idea is that the S/N ratio scales with the square root of the exposure time and the flux from the star. Flux is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula for S/N per pixel is often approximated as S/N = 10^(-0.15 * m) * sqrt(t), where t is the exposure time in seconds. Or wait, maybe that's another formula. Alternatively, I think it's more like S/N = (flux / noise) per unit time, but maybe another approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the photon flux. The number of photons received per second from a star depends on its apparent magnitude. The S/N ratio after an exposure time t is proportional to the square root of the number of photons received.

Wait, another approach: the signal is proportional to the flux, which is 10^(-0.4 * m) (since each magnitude step is a factor of about 2.512 in brightness, which is 10^(0.4)), but wait, m is the apparent magnitude, so higher m means fainter. So the flux f is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m).

The noise is roughly proportional to the square root of the signal, so noise ~ sqrt(f). Therefore, S/N = f / noise = sqrt(f) = sqrt(10^(-0.4 * m)) ) = 10^(-0.2 * m).

Wait, but that's per unit time. So if the exposure time is t seconds, then the S/N would scale as sqrt(t) * 10^(-0.2 * m).

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate. Let me think again. The photon flux (number of photons per second per pixel) from the star is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m). The number of photons in time t is then t * 10^(-0.4 * m). The noise is the square root of that number, so noise = sqrt(t) * 10^(-0.2 * m). So the S/N is (t * 10^(-0.4 m)) / (sqrt(t) * 10^(-0.2 m)) ) = sqrt(t) * 10^(-0.2 m).

So S/N = 10^(-0.2 m) * sqrt(t) .

Wait, but that seems a bit off because the units don't quite make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S/N = c * 10^(-0.15 m) * sqrt(t), where c is a constant that depends on the instrument's efficiency, the telescope's collecting area, and other factors.

Alternatively, I think that when using the VLT with ESPRESSO, which is a high-resolution spectrograph, it has a certain efficiency and collecting area. Let me look for typical S/N values for ESPRESSO. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is very efficient, so for bright stars it can reach high S/N quickly.

Wait, but perhaps I can find the typical S/N per exposure for a given magnitude. Let's think about how bright each star is:

Canopus: m ~ -0.7. That’s very bright.
Polaris: m ~ 2.0.
Options c: m=15 (very faint).
e: m≈13.5.
f: m≈18.5.
d: m≈21.5.

The exposure time is 1 hour, which is 3600 seconds.

Assuming that for a given star, the S/N is given by S/N = k * 10^(-0.15 * m) * sqrt(t), where k is a constant based on the telescope and instrument.

But without knowing the exact k, perhaps I can use the fact that a certain S/N is achievable for a star of known magnitude.

Wait, when I'm not sure, perhaps I can refer to an example. For instance, from what I remember, ESPRESSO can achieve an S/N of about 100 per pixel for a V=10 star in 1 hour. So for a star of m=10, S/N=100.

Wait, but how does that scale? Let's model it as S/N = 100 * (10^(-0.15 * (m - 10))) * sqrt(3600/3600), which is the same as 100 * (10^(-0.15 (m - 10)) ), since t is the same.

Wait, that can't be right because higher m (fainter) would give lower S/N. Wait, no, because m=10 is the reference here. For m=9, which is brighter than 10, S/N would be higher. Let's see: m=9 would be 10^(-0.15*(-1))=10^0.15≈1.41, so S/N would be 100 *1.41=141. For m=11, S/N would be 100 *10^(-0.15*1)=100 * ~0.707=70.7.

Wait, but if a star is much fainter, say m=15, then the S/N would be 100 *10^(-0.15*(5))=100 * (10^(-0.75))=100 * ~0.1778=17.78. So about 18 S/N. So for m=15, S/N is ~18, which is below the required 10. Wait, no, 18 is above 10, so it would be detectable. Hmm, but that's just a model. So perhaps I should think in terms of the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the S/N scales as S/N = 10^(0.4*(m_ref - m)) * (t_ref / t)^(0.5) * (other factors). But I'm not confident about the exact formula.

Alternatively, I can look for a more precise approach. The S/N ratio depends on the number of photons detected. The number of photons N is proportional to the exposure time t multiplied by the flux F from the star.

Flux F is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m) (since each magnitude is a factor of about 2.512, which is 10^(0.4)).

So N = F * t.

The noise is sqrt(N), so S/N = F * t / sqrt(N) = F * t / sqrt(F * t) ) = sqrt(F * t).

But wait, F itself is proportional to 10^(-0.4 m), so F = k * 10^(-0.4 m), where k is a proportionality constant (depending on telescope, instrument, etc.)

Thus, S/N = sqrt(k * 10^(-0.4 m) * t )

Which is S/N = sqrt(k * t) * 10^(-0.2 m)

Now, I can write S/N = S/N_ref * 10^(-0.2 (m - m_ref)) ), where S/N_ref is the S/N for a reference star at m_ref.

But without knowing S/N_ref, perhaps I can estimate for a known star. Let's say for a star at m=10, what's the S/N with ESPRESSO in 1 hour?

From some sources, I vaguely remember that ESPRESSO can achieve S/N of ~100 per pixel for a V=10 star in an hour or so. Let's say that's the case. So S/N_ref = 100 for m_ref=10.

So substituting, S/N = 100 * 10^(-0.2 (m - 10)) )

We need S/N ≥10.

So 100 * 10^(-0.2 (m-10)) ≥10 → 10^(-0.2 (m-10)) ≥ 0.1 → take log10: -0.2 (m-10) ≥ -1 → 0.2 (m-10) ≤1 → m-10 ≤5 → m ≤15.

So for m ≤15, S/N ≥10.

Wait, that's interesting. So for any star with apparent magnitude ≤15, the S/N would be at least 10. Because if m=15, then:

S/N =100 *10^(-0.2*(15-10))=100 *10^(-1)=100/10=10, which meets the condition.

Wait, but if m=16, S/N would be 100 *10^(-0.2*(6))=100 *10^(-1.2)=approx 100 * 0.063=6.3 <10. So it's undetectable.

So according to this model, any star with m ≤15 would have S/N ≥10, which meets the detectability condition.

Now, let's compute the apparent magnitudes for each star:

a) Canopus: m ≈ -0.7 → definitely ≤15 → detectable.

b) Polaris: m≈2.0 → yes.

c) 10 pc away, M=15 → m=15 → exactly 15 → S/N=10 → detectable.

d) 200 pc, M=15 → m≈21.5 → >15 → S/N <10 → not detectable.

e) 5 pc away, M=15 → m≈13.5 → <15 → detectable.

f) 50 pc, M=15 → m≈18.5 → >15 → not detectable.

So, let's count how many are detectable:

a: yes

b: yes

c: yes

d: no

e: yes

f: no

That's 4 stars: a, b, c, e.

Wait, but wait. What about the other factors, like the telescope's collecting area and the instrument's efficiency? The formula I used assumes that S/N scales with the square root of the telescope's area. Because the flux F is proportional to the area A, right? So if I used a larger telescope, the S/N would be higher for the same star.

Wait, but in the formula, the k in F = k * 10^(-0.4 m) would include the telescope's collecting area. So if ESPRESSO is mounted on an 8m VLT telescope, the k would be higher than if it were on a smaller telescope. But perhaps in our earlier model, S/N_ref was determined for a specific setup, which includes the VLT's 8m.

So in this model, the reference S/N for m=10 is 100 with the 8m VLT. So the calculation should hold.

So the detectable stars are a, b, c, e. So that's four stars. Looking back at the options:

Options are:

A) 2

B)5

C)4

D)3

So the correct answer would be C)4.

Wait, but wait again. Let me double-check the model. I assumed that for m=10, S/N=100. But what if the actual S/N for the reference star is lower?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Another approach is to consider the relation between S/N and magnitude.

The S/N ratio for a star is given by:

S/N = 10^(-0.15 * m) * sqrt(t) * (A / A_ref),

where A is the telescope's area and A_ref is a reference area.

But perhaps this is complicating things without knowing the exact factors.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the apparent magnitude for each star and see which are brighter than or equal to m=15 (since m=15 gives S/N=10), but wait, earlier I thought that m=15 gives exactly 10 S/N. So any star with m ≤15 would have S/N ≥10.

Wait, but let's think about the stars:

a) Canopus m≈-0.7 → way below 15 → yes.

b) Polaris m≈2 → yes.

c) m=15 → yes.

e) m≈13.5 → yes.

d) m≈21.5 → no.

f) m≈18.5 →no.

So that's four stars (a, b, c, e) that meet the condition. So the answer would be C)4.

To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with an 8m VLT telescope, we need to assess whether each star achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The S/N depends on the apparent magnitude \( m \) of the star, which is calculated using the distance modulus formula:

\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5
\]

where \( M \) is the absolute magnitude and \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The S/N scales with the flux of the star, which is proportional to \( 10^{-0.4m} \). For a given exposure time, the S/N can be approximated as:

\[
\text{S/N} = k \cdot 10^{-0.2m} \cdot \sqrt{t}
\]

where \( k \) is a constant that depends on the instrument and telescope, and \( t \) is the exposure time. Based on typical performance of ESPRESSO, a reference S/N of 100 is achieved for a star with \( m = 10 \) in 1 hour. Using this reference, the S/N for other stars can be scaled as:

\[
\text{S/N} = 100 \cdot 10^{-0.2(m - 10)}
\]

To meet the detectability condition of S/N ≥ 10, we solve:

\[
100 \cdot 10^{-0.2(m - 10)} \geq 10 \implies 10^{-0.2(m - 10)} \geq 0.1 \implies m \leq 15
\]

Thus, stars with apparent magnitudes \( m \leq 15 \) are detectable. Now, we compute the apparent magnitudes for each star:

1. **Canopus (a)**: Canopus is a very bright star with an apparent magnitude \( m \approx -0.7 \), which is much brighter than \( m = 15 \). **Detectable**.

2. **Polaris (b)**: Polaris has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx 2.0 \), which is also much brighter than \( m = 15 \). **Detectable**.

3. **Star c**: Absolute magnitude \( M = 15 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \). Using the distance modulus formula:

\[
m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15
\]

The apparent magnitude is \( m = 15 \), which meets the detectability condition. **Detectable**.

4. **Star d**: Absolute magnitude \( M = 15 \), distance \( d = 200 \, \text{pc} \). Using the distance modulus formula:

\[
m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(200) - 5 = 15 + 5(2.301) - 5 = 21.5
\]

The apparent magnitude is \( m = 21.5 \), which is fainter than \( m = 15 \). **Not detectable**.

5. **Star e**: Absolute magnitude \( M = 15 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \). Using the distance modulus formula:

\[
m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5) - 5 = 15 + 5(0.699) - 5 = 13.5
\]

The apparent magnitude is \( m = 13.5 \), which is brighter than \( m = 15 \). **Detectable**.

6. **Star f**: Absolute magnitude \( M = 15 \), distance \( d = 50 \, \text{pc} \). Using the distance modulus formula:

\[
m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(50) - 5 = 15 + 5(1.699) - 5 = 18.5
\]

The apparent magnitude is \( m = 18.5 \), which is fainter than \( m = 15 \). **Not detectable**.

### Conclusion:
The detectable stars are **a (Canopus)**, **b (Polaris)**, **c**, and **e**. This gives a total of **4 detectable stars**.

Okay, so I need to figure out how many of these stars are detectable by the ESPRESSO spectrograph when used with an 8m VLT telescope.

c) Star with RA 0, DEC 0, Absolute V mag 15, 10 pc
d) Same RA, DEC, V mag 15, 200 pc
e) Same, 5 pc
f) Same, 50 pc

I think I need to figure out the apparent magnitude of each star because the S/N ratio depends on how bright the star appears from Earth.

Wait, right. The formula for apparent magnitude (m) is m = M + 5 + 5 log10(d), where M is the absolute magnitude and d is the distance in parsecs. Or wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me recall the distance modulus formula: m = M + 5 log10(d) - 5. Because when d=10 pc, m = M.

Let me check—Wait, I think Canopus has an apparent magnitude around -0.7, making it one of the brightest. So m is about -0.7.

For b), Polaris. Hmm, Polaris is the North Star. I think its apparent magnitude is around 2. But wait, isn't it a bit dimmer? Maybe around 2. But I might be mixing it up with other stars. Alternatively, maybe Polaris is about 1.8 to 2.0. I'm not certain, but let's say m is about 2.0 for Polaris.

Now, options c to f all have the same absolute magnitude (15) but different distances. So let's compute their m.

For c), distance is 10 pc. So m = 15 + 5 log10(10) -5. Log10(10)=1. So m=15 +5(1) -5=15+5-5=15. So m=15.

Wait, but that's same as absolute magnitude. Because when d=10 pc, m = M.

For option e) same M, d=5 pc. So m = 15 +5 log10(5) -5. Log10(5)=0.69897. So 5*0.69897≈3.4949. So m=15 +3.4949 -5=13.4949. So about 13.5.

For f) d=50 pc. Log10(50)=1.69897. 5 * that is 8.49485. So m=15 +8.49485 -5=18.49485. So about 18.5.

d) is 200 pc. Log10(200)=2.3010. 5 *2.3010=11.505. So m=15+11.505-5=21.505. So about 21.5.

Wait, but wait. ESPRESSO's performance depends on the S/N per exposure. I think the S/N is higher for brighter stars (lower apparent magnitude). But I'm not exactly sure about the exact S/N for each magnitude. I need to find out what the S/N of 10 per binned pixel implies about the apparent magnitude.

Alternatively, the formula for S/N per pixel is often approximated as S/N = 10^(-0.15 * m) * sqrt(t), where t is the exposure time in seconds. Or wait, maybe that's another formula. Alternatively, I think it's more like S/N = (flux / noise) per unit time, but maybe another approach is needed.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the photon flux. The number of photons received per second from a star depends on its apparent magnitude. The S/N ratio after an exposure time t is proportional to the square root of the number of photons received.

Wait, another approach: the signal is proportional to the flux, which is 10^(-0.4 * m) (since each magnitude step is a factor of about 2.512 in brightness, which is 10^(0.4)), but wait, m is the apparent magnitude, so higher m means fainter. So the flux f is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m).

The noise is roughly proportional to the square root of the signal, so noise ~ sqrt(f). Therefore, S/N = f / noise = sqrt(f) = sqrt(10^(-0.4 * m)) ) = 10^(-0.2 * m).

Wait, but that's per unit time. So if the exposure time is t seconds, then the S/N would scale as sqrt(t) * 10^(-0.2 * m).

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's entirely accurate. Let me think again. The photon flux (number of photons per second per pixel) from the star is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m). The number of photons in time t is then t * 10^(-0.4 * m). The noise is the square root of that number, so noise = sqrt(t) * 10^(-0.2 * m). So the S/N is (t * 10^(-0.4 m)) / (sqrt(t) * 10^(-0.2 m)) ) = sqrt(t) * 10^(-0.2 m).

So S/N = 10^(-0.2 m) * sqrt(t) .

Wait, but that seems a bit off because the units don't quite make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is S/N = c * 10^(-0.15 m) * sqrt(t), where c is a constant that depends on the instrument's efficiency, the telescope's collecting area, and other factors.

Alternatively, I think that when using the VLT with ESPRESSO, which is a high-resolution spectrograph, it has a certain efficiency and collecting area. Let me look for typical S/N values for ESPRESSO. From what I remember, ESPRESSO is very efficient, so for bright stars it can reach high S/N quickly.

Wait, but perhaps I can find the typical S/N per exposure for a given magnitude. Let's think about how bright each star is:

Canopus: m ~ -0.7. That’s very bright.
Polaris: m ~ 2.0.
Options c: m=15 (very faint).
e: m≈13.5.
f: m≈18.5.
d: m≈21.5.

The exposure time is 1 hour, which is 3600 seconds.

Assuming that for a given star, the S/N is given by S/N = k * 10^(-0.15 * m) * sqrt(t), where k is a constant based on the telescope and instrument.

But without knowing the exact k, perhaps I can use the fact that a certain S/N is achievable for a star of known magnitude.

Wait, when I'm not sure, perhaps I can refer to an example. For instance, from what I remember, ESPRESSO can achieve an S/N of about 100 per pixel for a V=10 star in 1 hour. So for a star of m=10, S/N=100.

Wait, but how does that scale? Let's model it as S/N = 100 * (10^(-0.15 * (m - 10))) * sqrt(3600/3600), which is the same as 100 * (10^(-0.15 (m - 10)) ), since t is the same.

Wait, that can't be right because higher m (fainter) would give lower S/N. Wait, no, because m=10 is the reference here. For m=9, which is brighter than 10, S/N would be higher. Let's see: m=9 would be 10^(-0.15*(-1))=10^0.15≈1.41, so S/N would be 100 *1.41=141. For m=11, S/N would be 100 *10^(-0.15*1)=100 * ~0.707=70.7.

Wait, but if a star is much fainter, say m=15, then the S/N would be 100 *10^(-0.15*(5))=100 * (10^(-0.75))=100 * ~0.1778=17.78. So about 18 S/N. So for m=15, S/N is ~18, which is below the required 10. Wait, no, 18 is above 10, so it would be detectable. Hmm, but that's just a model. So perhaps I should think in terms of the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the S/N scales as S/N = 10^(0.4*(m_ref - m)) * (t_ref / t)^(0.5) * (other factors). But I'm not confident about the exact formula.

Alternatively, I can look for a more precise approach. The S/N ratio depends on the number of photons detected. The number of photons N is proportional to the exposure time t multiplied by the flux F from the star.

Flux F is proportional to 10^(-0.4 * m) (since each magnitude is a factor of about 2.512, which is 10^(0.4)).

So N = F * t.

The noise is sqrt(N), so S/N = F * t / sqrt(N) = F * t / sqrt(F * t) ) = sqrt(F * t).

But wait, F itself is proportional to 10^(-0.4 m), so F = k * 10^(-0.4 m), where k is a proportionality constant (depending on telescope, instrument, etc.)

Thus, S/N = sqrt(k * 10^(-0.4 m) * t )

Which is S/N = sqrt(k * t) * 10^(-0.2 m)

Now, I can write S/N = S/N_ref * 10^(-0.2 (m - m_ref)) ), where S/N_ref is the S/N for a reference star at m_ref.

But without knowing S/N_ref, perhaps I can estimate for a known star. Let's say for a star at m=10, what's the S/N with ESPRESSO in 1 hour?

From some sources, I vaguely remember that ESPRESSO can achieve S/N of ~100 per pixel for a V=10 star in an hour or so. Let's say that's the case. So S/N_ref = 100 for m_ref=10.

So substituting, S/N = 100 * 10^(-0.2 (m - 10)) )

We need S/N ≥10.

So 100 * 10^(-0.2 (m-10)) ≥10 → 10^(-0.2 (m-10)) ≥ 0.1 → take log10: -0.2 (m-10) ≥ -1 → 0.2 (m-10) ≤1 → m-10 ≤5 → m ≤15.

So for m ≤15, S/N ≥10.

Wait, that's interesting. So for any star with apparent magnitude ≤15, the S/N would be at least 10. Because if m=15, then:

S/N =100 *10^(-0.2*(15-10))=100 *10^(-1)=100/10=10, which meets the condition.

Wait, but if m=16, S/N would be 100 *10^(-0.2*(6))=100 *10^(-1.2)=approx 100 * 0.063=6.3 <10. So it's undetectable.

So according to this model, any star with m ≤15 would have S/N ≥10, which meets the detectability condition.

Now, let's compute the apparent magnitudes for each star:

a) Canopus: m ≈ -0.7 → definitely ≤15 → detectable.

b) Polaris: m≈2.0 → yes.

c) 10 pc away, M=15 → m=15 → exactly 15 → S/N=10 → detectable.

d) 200 pc, M=15 → m≈21.5 → >15 → S/N <10 → not detectable.

e) 5 pc away, M=15 → m≈13.5 → <15 → detectable.

f) 50 pc, M=15 → m≈18.5 → >15 → not detectable.

So, let's count how many are detectable:

a: yes

b: yes

c: yes

d: no

e: yes

f: no

That's 4 stars: a, b, c, e.

Wait, but wait. What about the other factors, like the telescope's collecting area and the instrument's efficiency? The formula I used assumes that S/N scales with the square root of the telescope's area. Because the flux F is proportional to the area A, right? So if I used a larger telescope, the S/N would be higher for the same star.

Wait, but in the formula, the k in F = k * 10^(-0.4 m) would include the telescope's collecting area. So if ESPRESSO is mounted on an 8m VLT telescope, the k would be higher than if it were on a smaller telescope. But perhaps in our earlier model, S/N_ref was determined for a specific setup, which includes the VLT's 8m.

So in this model, the reference S/N for m=10 is 100 with the 8m VLT. So the calculation should hold.

So the detectable stars are a, b, c, e. So that's four stars. Looking back at the options:

Options are:

A) 2

B)5

C)4

D)3

So the correct answer would be C)4.

Wait, but wait again. Let me double-check the model. I assumed that for m=10, S/N=100. But what if the actual S/N for the reference star is lower?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Another approach is to consider the relation between S/N and magnitude.

The S/N ratio for a star is given by:

S/N = 10^(-0.15 * m) * sqrt(t) * (A / A_ref),

where A is the telescope's area and A_ref is a reference area.

But perhaps this is complicating things without knowing the exact factors.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the apparent magnitude for each star and see which are brighter than or equal to m=15 (since m=15 gives S/N=10), but wait, earlier I thought that m=15 gives exactly 10 S/N. So any star with m ≤15 would have S/N ≥10.

Wait, but let's think about the stars:

a) Canopus m≈-0.7 → way below 15 → yes.

b) Polaris m≈2 → yes.

c) m=15 → yes.

e) m≈13.5 → yes.

d) m≈21.5 → no.

f) m≈18.5 →no.

So that's four stars (a, b, c, e) that meet the condition. So the answer would be C)4.


To determine how many of the listed stars are detectable using the ESPRESSO spectrograph coupled with an 8m VLT telescope, we need to assess whether each star achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of at least 10 per binned pixel during a 1-hour exposure. The S/N depends on the apparent magnitude \( m \) of the star, which is calculated using the distance modulus formula:

\[
m = M + 5 \log_{10}(d) - 5
\]

where \( M \) is the absolute magnitude and \( d \) is the distance in parsecs. The S/N scales with the flux of the star, which is proportional to \( 10^{-0.4m} \). For a given exposure time, the S/N can be approximated as:

\[
\text{S/N} = k \cdot 10^{-0.2m} \cdot \sqrt{t}
\]

where \( k \) is a constant that depends on the instrument and telescope, and \( t \) is the exposure time. Based on typical performance of ESPRESSO, a reference S/N of 100 is achieved for a star with \( m = 10 \) in 1 hour. Using this reference, the S/N for other stars can be scaled as:

\[
\text{S/N} = 100 \cdot 10^{-0.2(m - 10)}
\]

To meet the detectability condition of S/N ≥ 10, we solve:

\[
100 \cdot 10^{-0.2(m - 10)} \geq 10 \implies 10^{-0.2(m - 10)} \geq 0.1 \implies m \leq 15
\]

Thus, stars with apparent magnitudes \( m \leq 15 \) are detectable. Now, we compute the apparent magnitudes for each star:

1. **Canopus (a)**: Canopus is a very bright star with an apparent magnitude \( m \approx -0.7 \), which is much brighter than \( m = 15 \). **Detectable**.

2. **Polaris (b)**: Polaris has an apparent magnitude \( m \approx 2.0 \), which is also much brighter than \( m = 15 \). **Detectable**.

3. **Star c**: Absolute magnitude \( M = 15 \), distance \( d = 10 \, \text{pc} \). Using the distance modulus formula:

\[
m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(10) - 5 = 15
\]

The apparent magnitude is \( m = 15 \), which meets the detectability condition. **Detectable**.

4. **Star d**: Absolute magnitude \( M = 15 \), distance \( d = 200 \, \text{pc} \). Using the distance modulus formula:

\[
m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(200) - 5 = 15 + 5(2.301) - 5 = 21.5
\]

The apparent magnitude is \( m = 21.5 \), which is fainter than \( m = 15 \). **Not detectable**.

5. **Star e**: Absolute magnitude \( M = 15 \), distance \( d = 5 \, \text{pc} \). Using the distance modulus formula:

\[
m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(5) - 5 = 15 + 5(0.699) - 5 = 13.5
\]

The apparent magnitude is \( m = 13.5 \), which is brighter than \( m = 15 \). **Detectable**.

6. **Star f**: Absolute magnitude \( M = 15 \), distance \( d = 50 \, \text{pc} \). Using the distance modulus formula:

\[
m = 15 + 5 \log_{10}(50) - 5 = 15 + 5(1.699) - 5 = 18.5
\]

The apparent magnitude is \( m = 18.5 \), which is fainter than \( m = 15 \). **Not detectable**.

### Conclusion:
The detectable stars are **a (Canopus)**, **b (Polaris)**, **c**, and **e**. This gives a total of **4 detectable stars**.
