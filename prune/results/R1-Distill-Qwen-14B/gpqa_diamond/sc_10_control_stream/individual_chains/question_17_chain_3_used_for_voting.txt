Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the concentration of calcium ions in a solution that contains a Ca-EDTA complex. The concentration of the complex is 0.02 M, and the formation constant, K_Ca-EDTA, is 5x10^10. The pH is ideal, so I don't have to worry about that affecting anything. The temperature is 25°C, which is room temperature, so I don't think that's a factor here either.

Hmm, I remember that EDTA forms complexes with metal ions. The complex is usually written as CaY²- where Y is the EDTA. So the reaction would be something like Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The formation constant K is given, right? That's the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex.

Wait, the K value is 5x10^10, which is a really large number. So that means the reaction favors the formation of the complex. So the concentration of the complex will be much higher than the concentrations of the individual ions.

The problem is asking for the concentration of calcium ions in the solution. So I'm thinking about the dissociation of the complex. The complex dissociates into Ca²+ and EDTA^4-. The formation constant is K = [CaEDTA^2-]/([Ca²+][EDTA^4-]). But since K is so large, the amount of Ca²+ and EDTA^4- will be very low.

Wait, but the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So the total concentration of all species related to EDTA should be considered. Let me think: the total concentration is the sum of the free EDTA (Y^4-), free Ca²+ (Ca²+), and the complex (CaY^2-). But since K is so big, the complex is almost entirely formed. So the free Ca²+ and free EDTA would be in very small amounts.

But wait, the problem says the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So perhaps that's the initial concentration before considering any dissociation. Oh wait, but the complex does dissociate a little, but since K is so large, the dissociation is minimal.

So mathematically, the complex dissociates as:

CaY^2- ↔ Ca²+ + Y^4-

The K for this is 5e10, so K = [Ca²+][Y^4-]/[CaY^2-] = 5e10.

Assuming that the concentration of CaY^2- is approximately 0.02 M (since dissociation is minimal), we can let x = [Ca²+] = [Y^4-], because for every mole of complex that dissociates, one mole of each ion is produced.

So substituting into the equation: x^2 / (0.02) = 5e10.

Wait, wait. Wait, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let me think, when it dissociates, [CaY^2-] would be 0.02 - x. But since K is so large, x would be very small, so 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02. So we can approximate the denominator as 0.02.

So x^2 = K * [CaY^2-] = 5e10 * 0.02.

Calculating that: 5e10 * 0.02 = 1e9.

So x^2 = 1e9 → x = sqrt(1e9) = 3.16e4? Wait, that can't be right, because 3e4 M is way higher than the initial concentration. That can't be possible. I must have messed something up.

Wait wait wait, wait. Wait, K is 5e10. Let me write it correctly.

Wait, K = [Ca²+][Y^4-] / [CaY^2-] =5e10.

If I assume that [CaY^2-] ≈ 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] = [Y^4-] = x.

So x^2 / 0.02 =5e10 → x^2=5e10 * 0.02 =1e9 → x= sqrt(1e9)= 3.16e4 M. That's way too high. Impossible, because the initial concentration is 0.02 M.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the majority of the EDTA is in the complex, but the free ions are negligible. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the total concentration. The total concentration of all EDTA species is [Y_total] = [Y^4-] + [CaY^2-] + [H4Y], but wait, at pH where it's ideal, perhaps all EDTA is in the Y^4- form, or maybe considering that the problem states pH is ideal, so the EDTA is fully deprotonated. So the total EDTA is [Y^4-] + [CaY^2-].

But wait, the solution contains 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex. So that would be [CaY^2-] =0.02 M. The total EDTA is [Y^4-] + [CaY^2-] = [Y]_total.

Wait, but in the solution, the only source of EDTA is the complex. So initially, we have 0.02 M CaY^2-. Then, it dissociates into Ca²+ and Y^4-. So the total EDTA is [Y^4-] + [CaY^2-] = [Y^4-] + (0.02 - [Y^4-]) =0.02 M. Wait, that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe I should model it differently. Let me define the concentration of Ca²+ as x. Then, since the complex dissociates, [Y^4-] is also x. The concentration of the complex is approximately 0.02 - x, but since x is likely very small compared to 0.02, [CaY^2-] ≈ 0.02.

So K = (x)(x) / 0.02 =5e10 → x²=5e10 *0.02 =1e9 → x= sqrt(1e9)=3.16e4 M.

But that can't be correct because 3.16e4 is way bigger than 0.02 M. That would mean the concentration of Ca²+ is higher than the initial concentration of the complex, which isn't possible.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Oh! Wait a second, maybe the K given is the formation constant, which is for the formation of the complex. So K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]) =5e10.

In that case, if the complex is 0.02 M, and the solution is in equilibrium, then:

[CaY^2-] =0.02 - x ≈0.02.

x is the concentration of Ca²+ produced, and [Y^4-]=x.

So K= (0.02) / (x^2) =5e10 → x^2=0.02/(5e10) → x^2=4e-12 → x= sqrt(4e-12)=2e-6 M.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because 2e-6 is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation holds.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck. So K is 5e10 = [CaY^2-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

So [CaY^2-] is approximately 0.02, and [Ca²+] = [Y^4-] = x. So K = 0.02/(x²) =5e10 → x²=0.02/(5e10) → x²=4e-12 → x=2e-6 M.

So the concentration of Ca²+ would be 2e-6 M. Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is option C which is 6.3e-7. Hmm, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me redo the math.

0.02 / (5e10) = x² → x² = (2e-2) / (5e10) = (2 /5 ) *1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. Oh wait, 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5e12) = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13. So x²=4e-13 → x= sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13)= (2e-6.5) ?

Wait, no, wait. 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2 because (1e-6.5) is about 3.16e-7, and squaring that gives 1e-13. So 4e-13 is (2e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13)=2e-6.5 = 2 * 3.16e-7 ≈6.32e-7 M.

Oh, so x is approximately 6.3e-7 M. That matches option C.

Wait, so I must have messed up the calculation earlier. Let me redo it step by step.

So the equation is:

K = [CaY^2-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-}) =5e10.

Assuming [CaY^2-] ≈0.02 M.

Let [Ca²+] = x, and [Y^4-} = x, because they are produced in a 1:1 ratio.

So,

5e10 = 0.02 / (x * x) → 5e10 = 0.02 / x² → x² = 0.02 / (5e10) → x²= (2e-2)/(5e10) → 2/(5e12) → 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

Wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2, right. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → which is 4e-13. So x squared is 4e-13 → x is square root of 4e-13, which is 2e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. So the concentration of Ca²+ is about 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.

So why did I get 2e-6 earlier? Oh, I think I messed up the exponent calculation. So the correct answer is option C.

To determine the concentration of calcium ions ([Ca²⁺]) in a solution containing 0.02 M stochiometric Ca-EDTA complex, we use the formation constant \( K_{\text{Ca-EDTA}} = 5 \times 10^{10} \). The dissociation of the complex can be represented as:

\[
\text{CaY}^{2-} \leftrightarrow \text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{Y}^{4-}
\]

The equilibrium constant is given by:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaY}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{Y}^{4-}]}
\]

Let the concentration of \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{Y}^{4-}\) at equilibrium be \(x\). Since the dissociation is minimal (due to the large \(K\)), the concentration of the complex \([\text{CaY}^{2-}]\) remains approximately 0.02 M. Substituting into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Rearranging for \(x^2\):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{K} = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}}
\]

\[
x^2 = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of calcium ions is approximately \(6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}\), which corresponds to option C.

Wait, wait. Let me recheck. So K is 5e10 = [CaY^2-]/([Ca²+][Y^4-]).

Wait, wait, 0.02 is 2e-2, right. So 2e-2 divided by 5e10 is (2/5) * 1e-12 → 0.4e-12 → which is 4e-13. So x squared is 4e-13 → x is square root of 4e-13, which is 2e-6.5.

Wait, 1e-6.5 is about 3.16e-7. So 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7. So x is approximately 6.32e-7 M. So the concentration of Ca²+ is about 6.3e-7 M, which is option C.
