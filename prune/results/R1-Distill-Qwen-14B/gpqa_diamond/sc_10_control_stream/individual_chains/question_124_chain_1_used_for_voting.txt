Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about particles moving through a detector. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

Alright, the setup is that particles are being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are fast-decaying and travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20 on average. So, when they decay quickly, they probably don't travel too far before doing so. 

The question says that on average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, they're asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Wait, so I need to find the Lorentz factor that changes the fraction of particles making it to the detector walls. Right now, with a Lorentz factor (let's call it gamma) of 20, only about 1/3 make it. We want 2/3 to reach, so I guess that means we need a higher gamma? Or maybe a lower one? Hmm, wait, let's think.

Wait, wait. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). For ultra-relativistic particles, gamma is large because v is close to c. A higher gamma means the particles are moving even closer to the speed of light. So, if they have a higher gamma, they should travel farther before decaying, right? Because their lifetime is longer in our frame. But wait, the problem says that when gamma is 20, only one third reach the detector walls. So if gamma increases, more might reach the walls, like maybe two-thirds?

Wait, but that's the opposite of what I'm thinking. Let me think again. If a particle has a higher gamma, it's moving faster, so it can cover more distance in the lab frame before decaying. So higher gamma should mean more particles reach the detector. Since currently, with gamma=20, one third reach. So to get two-thirds, we need a higher gamma.

But wait, how does the decay distance relate to the Lorentz factor? Oh, right, the proper lifetime of the particle (tau) multiplied by gamma gives the lifetime in the lab frame. So the mean decay length is gamma * c * tau. So the distance the particle travels before decaying is proportional to gamma.

So if the detector has a radius of 30 meters, the maximum distance a particle can travel is 30 meters. So the fraction that reach the detector walls depends on how far they typically travel. The fraction is the ratio of the decay length (gamma * c tau) to the detector radius.

Wait, no, not exactly. Because the decay is a Poisson process, the probability that the particle hasn't decayed by the time it's traveled the radius is exp(-radius/(gamma c tau)). So the survival probability P is exp(-L/(gamma c tau)), where L is the distance the particle needs to travel to reach the wall. Since the detector is a sphere, the particles are produced at the center, so the maximum L is 30 meters.

So the initial condition is that when gamma is 20, the survival probability is 1/3. So 1/3 equals exp(-30/(20 c tau)). Wait, but tau is the proper lifetime, which is fixed. But maybe I can relate the two cases.

Wait, let me set up the equations. Let’s denote:

For gamma_1 = 20, P_1 = 1/3.

For gamma_2, P_2 = 2/3.

We can write:

P = exp( - L / (gamma c tau) )

Assuming L = 30 meters.

So for gamma_1: 1/3 = exp( -30 / (20 c tau) )

And for gamma_2: 2/3 = exp( -30 / (gamma_2 c tau) )

We can take the natural logs to solve for the exponents.

ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 c tau)
ln(2/3) = -30 / (gamma_2 c tau)

Wait, let me compute these.

ln(1/3) is negative, about -1.0986.

So,

-1.0986 = -30/(20 c tau)
=> 1.0986 = 30/(20 c tau)
=> 1.0986 = (3)/(2 c tau)
=> c tau = 3/(2 * 1.0986) ≈ 3/(2.1972) ≈ 1.367 meters.

Wait, that's the value of c tau. So c tau ≈ 1.367 meters.

Now, for the second case, gamma_2.

ln(2/3) is about -0.4055.

So,

-0.4055 = -30/(gamma_2 c tau)
=> 0.4055 = 30/(gamma_2 c tau)
=> gamma_2 c tau = 30 / 0.4055 ≈ 74.

But we already found c tau ≈ 1.367 meters.

So,

gamma_2 = 74 / 1.367 ≈ 54.1.

Wait, that's approximately 54. So the Lorentz factor needed is around 54. Looking at the options, option A is 54.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the steps. So, in the first case, when gamma is 20, the survival probability is 1/3. So the exponent is ln(1/3), which is -1.0986. So 30/(20 c tau) = 1.0986, leading to c tau = 30/(20 * 1.0986) = 30/(21.972) ≈ 1.367.

In the second case, we need the survival probability to be 2/3. So ln(2/3) is approximately -0.4055. So 30/(gamma_2 * c tau) = 0.4055.

We know c tau is 1.367, so 30/(gamma_2 * 1.367) = 0.4055.

So gamma_2 = 30 / (1.367 * 0.4055).

Let me calculate 1.367 * 0.4055.

1.367 * 0.4 is about 0.5468.

0.0055 * 1.367 is about 0.00752, so total is about 0.5543.

So gamma_2 ≈ 30 / 0.5543 ≈ 54.1.

So yes, gamma is approximately 54, which is option A.

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the survival probability and the Lorentz factor. The survival probability \( P \) is given by:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{L}{\gamma c \tau}\right),
\]

where:
- \( L = 30 \, \text{m} \) is the distance to the detector walls,
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Relating the given conditions
For the initial case, when \( \gamma_1 = 20 \), the survival probability is \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} \). Substituting into the survival probability formula:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{\gamma_1 c \tau}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of \( \frac{1}{3} \), we find:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \approx -1.0986.
\]

Thus:

\[
-1.0986 = -\frac{30}{20 c \tau}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
c \tau = \frac{30}{20 \cdot 1.0986} \approx 1.367 \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 2: Solving for the new Lorentz factor
For the second case, we want the survival probability \( P_2 = \frac{2}{3} \). Using the survival probability formula again:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{\gamma_2 c \tau}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of \( \frac{2}{3} \), we find:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \approx -0.4055.
\]

Substituting \( c \tau \approx 1.367 \, \text{m} \):

\[
-0.4055 = -\frac{30}{\gamma_2 \cdot 1.367}.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma_2 \):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{30}{1.367 \cdot 0.4055}.
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
1.367 \cdot 0.4055 \approx 0.5543.
\]

Thus:

\[
\gamma_2 \approx \frac{30}{0.5543} \approx 54.1.
\]

### Conclusion
The Lorentz factor needed to ensure that about two-thirds of the particles reach the detector walls is approximately \( \gamma_2 \approx 54 \). Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:

Wait, let me set up the equations. Let’s denote:

For gamma_1 = 20, P_1 = 1/3.

For gamma_2, P_2 = 2/3.

We can write:

P = exp( - L / (gamma c tau) )

Assuming L = 30 meters.

So for gamma_1: 1/3 = exp( -30 / (20 c tau) )

And for gamma_2: 2/3 = exp( -30 / (gamma_2 c tau) )

We can take the natural logs to solve for the exponents.

ln(1/3) = -30 / (20 c tau)
ln(2/3) = -30 / (gamma_2 c tau)

Wait, let me compute these.

ln(1/3) is negative, about -1.0986.

So,

-1.0986 = -30/(20 c tau)
=> 1.0986 = 30/(20 c tau)
=> 1.0986 = (3)/(2 c tau)
=> c tau = 3/(2 * 1.0986) ≈ 3/(2.1972) ≈ 1.367 meters.

Wait, that's the value of c tau. So c tau ≈ 1.367 meters.

Now, for the second case, gamma_2.

ln(2/3) is about -0.4055.

So,

-0.4055 = -30/(gamma_2 c tau)
=> 0.4055 = 30/(gamma_2 c tau)
=> gamma_2 c tau = 30 / 0.4055 ≈ 74.

But we already found c tau ≈ 1.367 meters.

So,

gamma_2 = 74 / 1.367 ≈ 54.1.

Wait, that's approximately 54. So the Lorentz factor needed is around 54. Looking at the options, option A is 54.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the steps. So, in the first case, when gamma is 20, the survival probability is 1/3. So the exponent is ln(1/3), which is -1.0986. So 30/(20 c tau) = 1.0986, leading to c tau = 30/(20 * 1.0986) = 30/(21.972) ≈ 1.367.

In the second case, we need the survival probability to be 2/3. So ln(2/3) is approximately -0.4055. So 30/(gamma_2 * c tau) = 0.4055.

We know c tau is 1.367, so 30/(gamma_2 * 1.367) = 0.4055.

So gamma_2 = 30 / (1.367 * 0.4055).

Let me calculate 1.367 * 0.4055.

1.367 * 0.4 is about 0.5468.

0.0055 * 1.367 is about 0.00752, so total is about 0.5543.

So gamma_2 ≈ 30 / 0.5543 ≈ 54.1.

So yes, gamma is approximately 54, which is option A.


To determine the Lorentz factor needed for about two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the survival probability and the Lorentz factor. The survival probability \( P \) is given by:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{L}{\gamma c \tau}\right),
\]

where:
- \( L = 30 \, \text{m} \) is the distance to the detector walls,
- \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle.

### Step 1: Relating the given conditions
For the initial case, when \( \gamma_1 = 20 \), the survival probability is \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} \). Substituting into the survival probability formula:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{\gamma_1 c \tau}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of \( \frac{1}{3} \), we find:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) \approx -1.0986.
\]

Thus:

\[
-1.0986 = -\frac{30}{20 c \tau}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
c \tau = \frac{30}{20 \cdot 1.0986} \approx 1.367 \, \text{m}.
\]

### Step 2: Solving for the new Lorentz factor
For the second case, we want the survival probability \( P_2 = \frac{2}{3} \). Using the survival probability formula again:

\[

\]

Taking the natural logarithm of \( \frac{2}{3} \), we find:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) \approx -0.4055.
\]

Substituting \( c \tau \approx 1.367 \, \text{m} \):

\[
-0.4055 = -\frac{30}{\gamma_2 \cdot 1.367}.
\]

Rearranging for \( \gamma_2 \):

\[
\gamma_2 = \frac{30}{1.367 \cdot 0.4055}.
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
1.367 \cdot 0.4055 \approx 0.5543.
\]

Thus:

\[
\gamma_2 \approx \frac{30}{0.5543} \approx 54.1.
