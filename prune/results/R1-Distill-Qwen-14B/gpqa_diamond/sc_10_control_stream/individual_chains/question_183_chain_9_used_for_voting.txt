Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed after a reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the presence of HI for some kind of elimination reaction, maybe deoxygenation or something like that. Wait, no, I think when you have red phosphorus and HI, it's typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles or maybe for the dealkylation of certain groups. Or wait, another possibility—maybe it's about the Wittig reaction? No, wait, the Wittig reagent is usually made with triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, wait. Red phosphorus is used in the reaction known as the hydroboration? No, that's with boron. Oh, wait, I think I remember. Red phosphorus and iodine can be used to dehalogenate something, but in this case, it's with excess HI. So perhaps it's a way to break a double bond or remove certain functional groups.

But looking back, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to draw its structure. So, a cyclohexene ring, right? The numbering is such that the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 because it's cyclohex-3-ene. Wait, the formula is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the substituents are at positions 2, 3 (the double bond), and 5. Let me write it out.

The cyclohexene ring: positions 1 through 6. The double bond is between 3 and 4. Then, at position 2 is a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5 is a vinyl group (CH2CH2?), wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached as a substituent. Oh, so the substituents are a formyl at carbon 2 and a vinyl group at carbon 5.

Wait, the structure would be a cyclohexene ring (so one double bond in the ring), with a formyl group on carbon 2, a vinyl group (CH2CH2 is incorrect; vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, it's like a cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 2 and 5, each as formyl and vinyl groups respectively.

So the molecule has a cyclohexene ring with one double bond, a formyl group, a vinyl group, and a carboxylic acid group. Wait, no, wait the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the 'carboxylic acid' part is at position 3? Wait, no— the suffix is -carboxylic acid, which indicates the position of the substituent. The numbering in the name is such that the carboxylic acid is at a certain position.

Wait, I think the numbering goes so that the carboxylic acid group is given the lowest number possible. So the substituents are at 2, 3 (the double bond), and 5. Wait, no, the cyclohexene ring has double bond at 3, and the carboxylic acid is at a position. Let me get this clear.

Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the parent structure is cyclohex-3-ene carboxylic acid. So the ring is cyclohexene with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. The carboxylic acid group is at carbon 1 because, in cyclohexene carboxylic acid, the numbering starts such that the carboxylic acid is position 1, and the double bond is between 3 and 4.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Let me think: the name is cyclohexenecarboxylic acid. The position of the double bond is given as 3, so the substituents would be at other positions. Wait, perhaps the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the double bond is between 3 and 4, and then substituents at 2 and 5.

So, structure:

Carbon 1: COOH (carboxylic acid group)
Carbon 2: CHO (formyl)
Carbon 5: CH2CH2 (vinyl group, which is CH2=CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So at carbon 5, it's a CH2=CH- group.

Wait, more accurately, the structure would be a cyclohexene ring, with:

- Carboxylic acid group at position 1.
- Formyl group at position 2.
- Vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at position 5.

And the ring itself is a cyclohexene, so a double bond between 3 and 4.

So the molecule has multiple double bonds and rings. The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated by the formula: IHD = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Where C is the number of carbons, H the hydrogens, X halogens, and N nitrogens. But since the molecule doesn't have X or N, the formula simplifies to IHD = (2C +2 - H)/2.

But wait, the question is about the product. So first, I need to figure out what happens when this molecule reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI.

Wait, I'm trying to remember the reaction of red phosphorus with HI. Another thought: red phosphorus with HI is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. But wait, the starting material doesn't have a nitrile group. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the reduction of certain functional groups.

Wait, another possibility: when a carbonyl group reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Oh wait! I remember that red phosphorus and HI can reduce ketones or aldehydes to alkanes. For example, the Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg)/HCl to reduce ketones to alkanes, but that's without phosphorus. Alternatively, the Wolff-Kishner reaction uses NH2NH2 and heat to eliminate carbonyls. Hmm, but perhaps red phosphorus and HI is used in a different kind of reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is about removing functional groups. Wait, another thought: the reaction of alkenes with red phosphorus and HI. I think that in such a case, it might be a dehydrohalogenation or some addition. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe it's about the removal of certain groups.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of the double bond. The starting material has a cyclohexene ring (so one double bond), a vinyl group (another double bond), and a formyl group (a double bond in the CHO). So the molecule has multiple double bonds.

Wait, but when you react this with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? Let me think. Red phosphorus and HI are sometimes used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but perhaps in this case, it's about the addition to double bonds. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or some elimination.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the deoxygenation of the carbonyl groups. For example, the formyl group (CHO) is reduced to a CH2 group. Let me recall: the Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones and aldehydes to alkanes using Zn(Hg) and HCl. But that uses mercury. Alternatively, the Oppenauer oxidation converts ketones to aldehydes, but that's the opposite direction.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is about breaking the formyl group. Wait, but with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the formyl group is converted to CH2I, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a more general one. Red phosphorus and HI can add to double bonds. For example, in the presence of HI, red phosphorus may add across the double bonds, leading to diiodides. But in the case of excess HI, maybe it would cleave the double bonds.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is the removal of the formyl group and the vinyl group. Let me think, what happens when a carbonyl group (like formyl) reacts with HI in the presence of red phosphorus. Maybe it's a situation where the carbonyl is converted into an iodide, and then perhaps further reactions occur.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the deoxygenation, like the formyl group being reduced. Wait, another thought: the formyl group (CHO) can be reduced to CH2OH (hydroxymethyl) under certain conditions. But I'm not certain about this.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to the double bonds, but red phosphorus is a catalyst. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a di-iodination of the double bonds. But let me think: in the presence of excess HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the double bonds are saturated, and iodide groups are added.

Wait, but if the starting material has a cyclohexene ring (a double bond in the ring), a vinyl group (another double bond), and a formyl group (another double bond), when reacted with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps each double bond is converted in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the removal of the functional groups. For example, the formyl group (CHO) and the vinyl group (CH2CH2) might be converted into something else.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction converts each double bond into a single bond, adding iodine. So each double bond would become a single bond with iodine added, but since there's excess HI, perhaps the iodides are further treated.

Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about what the product would look like. The starting material has several double bonds: the cyclohexene ring, the vinyl group, and the formyl group.

When reacted with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps each of these double bonds is broken, and iodides are added. Alternatively, maybe the formyl group is reduced to a CH2 group, the vinyl group is hydrogenated, and the cyclohexene ring is hydrogenated.

Wait, but wait, red phosphorus and HI—I'm trying to think of a specific reaction. Oh! Wait, perhaps it's a dehalogenation reaction. I remember that when you have vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons), red phosphorus can remove the halides, forming a double bond. But in this case, the starting material doesn't have halides. So that might not apply.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about the acid group. The starting material is a carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure how that would react with red phosphorus and HI. Maybe it's a decarboxylation reaction, but I don't recall red phosphorus being used for that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of the carbonyl oxygen in the formyl group. Red phosphorus and HI can cause certain carbonyl groups to undergo substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is converted into an iodide.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a situation where the formyl group is transformed into a methyl group. Wait, I think there's a reaction where formyl groups are reduced to CH2 groups using red phosphorus and HI. Let me think: in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, the formyl group (CHO) is converted into CH2(HI)2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is replaced by a CH2 group, releasing HI.

Alternatively, I think that in certain conditions, the formyl group (CHO) can be deoxygenated to CH2I. For example, in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the aldehyde group (CHO) becomes CH2I. Because red phosphorus and HI can act as a reducing agent.

Wait, another thought: the formyl group (CHO) can be converted to CH2I by reacting with HI in the presence of a reducing agent like red phosphorus. So the CHO would become CH2I. Similarly, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would also react. Wait, the vinyl group is a substituent attached to the ring. So the CH2=CH- group attached to the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl group's double bond is also attacked in the same way. So the vinyl group (CH2CH2, but actually CH2=CH- attached to the ring) would have its double bond opened, perhaps adding HI across it.

Alternatively, perhaps each double bond in the molecule is saturated, adding HI across them.

But wait, the starting material's structure has a cyclohexene ring (double bond in the ring), a vinyl substituent (double bond), and a formyl group (double bond). So three double bonds in total.

When reacted with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps all of these double bonds are hydrogenated, adding HI across each.

Wait, but red phosphorus is typically a reducing agent. So maybe it's about reducing the double bonds to single bonds, but adding H and I.

Wait, but then the product would have more iodine but fewer double bonds. The index of hydrogen deficiency would then decrease.

But let me think step by step. Let me imagine that each double bond is hydrogenated, adding H and I across each.

So the cyclohexene ring (1 double bond) would become a cyclohexane ring. The formyl group's double bond (CHO) would be converted into CH2I. The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would become CH2CH2I, but wait, the vinyl group is attached to the ring, so adding HI across the double bond would make it CH2-CH2-I? Or would it add an iodide to each end?

Alternatively, perhaps each double bond is hydrogenated with HI, leading to the addition of H and I across each.

Wait, but let's think about each double bond:

1. The cyclohexene ring's double bond (between C3 and C4) would become a single bond, with each carbon gaining an H and an I. So the ring becomes cyclohexane, and each of those carbons now has an -HI group?

Wait, no, more accurately, when a double bond reacts with HI in an addition reaction, each carbon of the double bond would get an H and an I. But in this case, the starting material is a cyclohexene ring, and when it reacts with HI, it would add HI across the double bond, resulting in a diiodide, but perhaps that's not what's happening here. But then why red phosphorus?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that requires existing halides, which aren't present in the starting material.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about the functional groups. Let me think again. The starting material is a carboxylic acid. How does that react with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, I found in my notes that when a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes decarboxylation. Because the -COOH group is converted into -CH2I. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, maybe it's the formyl group that's undergoing the reaction.

Wait, another thought: the formyl group (CHO) can be reduced by red phosphorus and HI to CH2I. Similarly, the vinyl group's double bond (CH2=CH-) would be hydrogenated to CH2CH2, but I'm not sure if HI adds to it or if it's just saturated.

Wait, perhaps each of the double bonds in the molecule is reduced. So the cyclohexene ring becomes cyclohexane, the vinyl group becomes CH2CH2 (but that's just ethane, which doesn't make sense attached to the ring), and the formyl group becomes CH2I.

Wait, perhaps the formyl group (CHO) is converted into CH2I, so the substituent at position 2 becomes CH2I. The vinyl group's double bond (CH2=CH-) would be hydrogenated to CH2CH3 (ethyl group). But wait, in that case, the substituent at position 5 would become a CH2CH3 group.

So the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (no double bonds in the ring)
- At position 2: CH2I group
- At position 5: CH2CH3 group
- The carboxylic acid group at position 1 is perhaps affected. Wait, but wait, the carboxylic acid is COOH. How does that react?

Wait, maybe the reaction doesn't affect the carboxylic acid group. Or perhaps it does. Alternatively, maybe the carboxylic acid group is converted into something else. Let me think: carboxylic acids can be reduced to CH2OH groups, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps under these conditions, the carboxylic acid is converted into an iodide. Alternatively, perhaps it isn't. Maybe the carboxylic acid remains as is.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the formyl group, the vinyl group, and the ring, while the carboxylic acid remains unchanged.

Wait, but let's consider what each substitution would do to the index of hydrogen deficiency. Let's calculate the IHD for the product.

First, the original molecule: let's count the rings and double bonds.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

That's a cyclohexene ring (1 ring, 1 double bond), a formyl group (CHO, which has a double bond), and a vinyl group (CH2=CH-, another double bond).

So the starting material has:

- 1 ring
- 3 double bonds (ring, formyl, vinyl)

So total IHD is 1 (ring) + 3 (double bonds) = 4.

But wait, the index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as the sum of rings and double bonds. Alternatively, each ring or double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.

So, for the starting material, IHD is 4 (1 ring + 3 double bonds).

Now, after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what changes?

Assume that each double bond is saturated, and any rings are opened.

Wait, if the cyclohexene ring is hydrogenated to cyclohexane, that removes the ring (so -1 to IHD) and adds two H's, but the double bond is gone.

The formyl group (CHO) becomes CH2I. That's a reduction, removing a double bond, so -1 to IHD.

The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) becomes CH2CH2 (but that's just a single bond, so another -1 to IHD.

So the product would have:

- No rings (if the cyclohexene ring is saturated)
- No double bonds in substituents (formyl and vinyl groups are saturated)

So the product would have IHD of 0.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The cyclohexene ring is a cyclohexane after hydrogenation. The formyl group is CH2I, which has no double bonds. The vinyl group is CH2CH3, which also has no double bonds. So the product would have no rings and no double bonds, so IHD is 0.

But wait, the carboxylic acid group (COOH) would still be present, but that doesn't contribute to IHD because it's a functional group, not a ring or double bond.

So the product's IHD would be zero. So the answer is D) 0.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the reaction conditions. Let me think again about the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are used, so maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation? Or perhaps the reaction is adding HI across the double bonds.

Wait, in the presence of excess HI, maybe all the double bonds are saturated, adding H and I across each. So the product would have no double bonds or rings, leading to IHD zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid is converted into something else. For example, perhaps it's decarboxylated. But I'm not sure how that would affect the IHD.

Wait, if the carboxylic acid group is converted into something else, like an alcohol or an ether, but that wouldn't change the IHD because those don't contribute to it.

So, putting it all together, the product would have no rings and no double bonds, so IHD is 0. Thus, the correct answer is D) 0.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first analyze the starting material, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. The molecule contains:

1. A **cyclohexene ring** (a six-membered ring with one double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD).
2. A **formyl group (CHO)** (contains a double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD).
3. A **vinyl group (CH₂=CH-)** (contains a double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD).

Thus, the starting material has **3 double bonds** and **1 ring**, giving it an IHD of:

\[
\text{IHD} = 1 \, (\text{ring}) + 3 \, (\text{double bonds}) = 4
\]

When the molecule reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, the following transformations occur:

1. The **cyclohexene ring** (C₃=C₄) is hydrogenated, converting the double bond into a single bond and forming a cyclohexane ring. This eliminates the ring contribution to the IHD (-1).
2. The **formyl group (CHO)** is reduced to a CH₂I group, eliminating the double bond in the formyl group (-1).
3. The **vinyl group (CH₂=CH-)** is hydrogenated, converting the double bond into a single bond and forming a CH₂CH₃ group (-1).

After these transformations, the product contains **no rings and no double bonds**. Therefore, the IHD of the product is:

\[
\text{IHD} = 0
\]

The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. The question is about the index of hydrogen deficiency of a product formed after a reaction. The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid, and it's reacted with red phosphorus and excess HI. Hmm, I remember that red phosphorus is often used in the presence of HI for some kind of elimination reaction, maybe deoxygenation or something like that. Wait, no, I think when you have red phosphorus and HI, it's typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles or maybe for the dealkylation of certain groups. Or wait, another possibility—maybe it's about the Wittig reaction? No, wait, the Wittig reagent is usually made with triphenylphosphine and an alkyl halide. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, wait. Red phosphorus is used in the reaction known as the hydroboration? No, that's with boron. Oh, wait, I think I remember. Red phosphorus and iodine can be used to dehalogenate something, but in this case, it's with excess HI. So perhaps it's a way to break a double bond or remove certain functional groups.

But looking back, the starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. Let me try to draw its structure. So, a cyclohexene ring, right? The numbering is such that the double bond is between carbons 3 and 4 because it's cyclohex-3-ene. Wait, the formula is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So, the substituents are at positions 2, 3 (the double bond), and 5. Let me write it out.

The cyclohexene ring: positions 1 through 6. The double bond is between 3 and 4. Then, at position 2 is a formyl group (CHO), and at position 5 is a vinyl group (CH2CH2?), wait, no, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached as a substituent. Oh, so the substituents are a formyl at carbon 2 and a vinyl group at carbon 5.

Wait, the structure would be a cyclohexene ring (so one double bond in the ring), with a formyl group on carbon 2, a vinyl group (CH2CH2 is incorrect; vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So, it's like a cyclohexene ring with substituents at positions 2 and 5, each as formyl and vinyl groups respectively.

So the molecule has a cyclohexene ring with one double bond, a formyl group, a vinyl group, and a carboxylic acid group. Wait, no, wait the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the 'carboxylic acid' part is at position 3? Wait, no— the suffix is -carboxylic acid, which indicates the position of the substituent. The numbering in the name is such that the carboxylic acid is at a certain position.

Wait, I think the numbering goes so that the carboxylic acid group is given the lowest number possible. So the substituents are at 2, 3 (the double bond), and 5. Wait, no, the cyclohexene ring has double bond at 3, and the carboxylic acid is at a position. Let me get this clear.

Wait, the name is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. So the parent structure is cyclohex-3-ene carboxylic acid. So the ring is cyclohexene with the double bond between carbons 3 and 4. The carboxylic acid group is at carbon 1 because, in cyclohexene carboxylic acid, the numbering starts such that the carboxylic acid is position 1, and the double bond is between 3 and 4.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Let me think: the name is cyclohexenecarboxylic acid. The position of the double bond is given as 3, so the substituents would be at other positions. Wait, perhaps the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the double bond is between 3 and 4, and then substituents at 2 and 5.

So, structure:

Carbon 1: COOH (carboxylic acid group)
Carbon 2: CHO (formyl)
Carbon 5: CH2CH2 (vinyl group, which is CH2=CH2? No, wait, vinyl is CH2=CH- attached to the ring. So at carbon 5, it's a CH2=CH- group.

Wait, more accurately, the structure would be a cyclohexene ring, with:

- Carboxylic acid group at position 1.
- Formyl group at position 2.
- Vinyl group (CH2=CH-) at position 5.

And the ring itself is a cyclohexene, so a double bond between 3 and 4.

So the molecule has multiple double bonds and rings. The index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) is calculated by the formula: IHD = (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. Where C is the number of carbons, H the hydrogens, X halogens, and N nitrogens. But since the molecule doesn't have X or N, the formula simplifies to IHD = (2C +2 - H)/2.

But wait, the question is about the product. So first, I need to figure out what happens when this molecule reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI.

Wait, I'm trying to remember the reaction of red phosphorus with HI. Another thought: red phosphorus with HI is used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. But wait, the starting material doesn't have a nitrile group. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the reduction of certain functional groups.

Wait, another possibility: when a carbonyl group reacts with red phosphorus and HI. Oh wait! I remember that red phosphorus and HI can reduce ketones or aldehydes to alkanes. For example, the Clemmensen reduction uses Zn(Hg)/HCl to reduce ketones to alkanes, but that's without phosphorus. Alternatively, the Wolff-Kishner reaction uses NH2NH2 and heat to eliminate carbonyls. Hmm, but perhaps red phosphorus and HI is used in a different kind of reaction.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is about removing functional groups. Wait, another thought: the reaction of alkenes with red phosphorus and HI. I think that in such a case, it might be a dehydrohalogenation or some addition. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe it's about the removal of certain groups.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a cleavage of the double bond. The starting material has a cyclohexene ring (so one double bond), a vinyl group (another double bond), and a formyl group (a double bond in the CHO). So the molecule has multiple double bonds.

Wait, but when you react this with red phosphorus and HI, what happens? Let me think. Red phosphorus and HI are sometimes used in the hydrolysis of nitriles, but perhaps in this case, it's about the addition to double bonds. Alternatively, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or some elimination.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the deoxygenation of the carbonyl groups. For example, the formyl group (CHO) is reduced to a CH2 group. Let me recall: the Clemmensen reduction reduces ketones and aldehydes to alkanes using Zn(Hg) and HCl. But that uses mercury. Alternatively, the Oppenauer oxidation converts ketones to aldehydes, but that's the opposite direction.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is about breaking the formyl group. Wait, but with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the formyl group is converted to CH2I, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a more general one. Red phosphorus and HI can add to double bonds. For example, in the presence of HI, red phosphorus may add across the double bonds, leading to diiodides. But in the case of excess HI, maybe it would cleave the double bonds.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction is the removal of the formyl group and the vinyl group. Let me think, what happens when a carbonyl group (like formyl) reacts with HI in the presence of red phosphorus. Maybe it's a situation where the carbonyl is converted into an iodide, and then perhaps further reactions occur.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is more about the deoxygenation, like the formyl group being reduced. Wait, another thought: the formyl group (CHO) can be reduced to CH2OH (hydroxymethyl) under certain conditions. But I'm not certain about this.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to the double bonds, but red phosphorus is a catalyst. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a di-iodination of the double bonds. But let me think: in the presence of excess HI and red phosphorus, perhaps the double bonds are saturated, and iodide groups are added.

Wait, but if the starting material has a cyclohexene ring (a double bond in the ring), a vinyl group (another double bond), and a formyl group (another double bond), when reacted with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps each double bond is converted in some way.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the removal of the functional groups. For example, the formyl group (CHO) and the vinyl group (CH2CH2) might be converted into something else.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction converts each double bond into a single bond, adding iodine. So each double bond would become a single bond with iodine added, but since there's excess HI, perhaps the iodides are further treated.

Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about what the product would look like. The starting material has several double bonds: the cyclohexene ring, the vinyl group, and the formyl group.

When reacted with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps each of these double bonds is broken, and iodides are added. Alternatively, maybe the formyl group is reduced to a CH2 group, the vinyl group is hydrogenated, and the cyclohexene ring is hydrogenated.

Wait, but wait, red phosphorus and HI—I'm trying to think of a specific reaction. Oh! Wait, perhaps it's a dehalogenation reaction. I remember that when you have vicinal dihalides (two halides on adjacent carbons), red phosphorus can remove the halides, forming a double bond. But in this case, the starting material doesn't have halides. So that might not apply.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is about the acid group. The starting material is a carboxylic acid. But I'm not sure how that would react with red phosphorus and HI. Maybe it's a decarboxylation reaction, but I don't recall red phosphorus being used for that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the substitution of the carbonyl oxygen in the formyl group. Red phosphorus and HI can cause certain carbonyl groups to undergo substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is converted into an iodide.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a situation where the formyl group is transformed into a methyl group. Wait, I think there's a reaction where formyl groups are reduced to CH2 groups using red phosphorus and HI. Let me think: in the presence of HI and red phosphorus, the formyl group (CHO) is converted into CH2(HI)2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is replaced by a CH2 group, releasing HI.

Alternatively, I think that in certain conditions, the formyl group (CHO) can be deoxygenated to CH2I. For example, in the presence of red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the aldehyde group (CHO) becomes CH2I. Because red phosphorus and HI can act as a reducing agent.

Wait, another thought: the formyl group (CHO) can be converted to CH2I by reacting with HI in the presence of a reducing agent like red phosphorus. So the CHO would become CH2I. Similarly, the vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would also react. Wait, the vinyl group is a substituent attached to the ring. So the CH2=CH- group attached to the cyclohexene ring.

Wait, perhaps the vinyl group's double bond is also attacked in the same way. So the vinyl group (CH2CH2, but actually CH2=CH- attached to the ring) would have its double bond opened, perhaps adding HI across it.

Alternatively, perhaps each double bond in the molecule is saturated, adding HI across them.

But wait, the starting material's structure has a cyclohexene ring (double bond in the ring), a vinyl substituent (double bond), and a formyl group (double bond). So three double bonds in total.

When reacted with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps all of these double bonds are hydrogenated, adding HI across each.

Wait, but red phosphorus is typically a reducing agent. So maybe it's about reducing the double bonds to single bonds, but adding H and I.

Wait, but then the product would have more iodine but fewer double bonds. The index of hydrogen deficiency would then decrease.

But let me think step by step. Let me imagine that each double bond is hydrogenated, adding H and I across each.

So the cyclohexene ring (1 double bond) would become a cyclohexane ring. The formyl group's double bond (CHO) would be converted into CH2I. The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) would become CH2CH2I, but wait, the vinyl group is attached to the ring, so adding HI across the double bond would make it CH2-CH2-I? Or would it add an iodide to each end?

Alternatively, perhaps each double bond is hydrogenated with HI, leading to the addition of H and I across each.

Wait, but let's think about each double bond:

1. The cyclohexene ring's double bond (between C3 and C4) would become a single bond, with each carbon gaining an H and an I. So the ring becomes cyclohexane, and each of those carbons now has an -HI group?

Wait, no, more accurately, when a double bond reacts with HI in an addition reaction, each carbon of the double bond would get an H and an I. But in this case, the starting material is a cyclohexene ring, and when it reacts with HI, it would add HI across the double bond, resulting in a diiodide, but perhaps that's not what's happening here. But then why red phosphorus?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but that requires existing halides, which aren't present in the starting material.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is more about the functional groups. Let me think again. The starting material is a carboxylic acid. How does that react with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, I found in my notes that when a carboxylic acid is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes decarboxylation. Because the -COOH group is converted into -CH2I. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, maybe it's the formyl group that's undergoing the reaction.

Wait, another thought: the formyl group (CHO) can be reduced by red phosphorus and HI to CH2I. Similarly, the vinyl group's double bond (CH2=CH-) would be hydrogenated to CH2CH2, but I'm not sure if HI adds to it or if it's just saturated.

Wait, perhaps each of the double bonds in the molecule is reduced. So the cyclohexene ring becomes cyclohexane, the vinyl group becomes CH2CH2 (but that's just ethane, which doesn't make sense attached to the ring), and the formyl group becomes CH2I.

Wait, perhaps the formyl group (CHO) is converted into CH2I, so the substituent at position 2 becomes CH2I. The vinyl group's double bond (CH2=CH-) would be hydrogenated to CH2CH3 (ethyl group). But wait, in that case, the substituent at position 5 would become a CH2CH3 group.

So the product would have:

- A cyclohexane ring (no double bonds in the ring)
- At position 2: CH2I group
- At position 5: CH2CH3 group
- The carboxylic acid group at position 1 is perhaps affected. Wait, but wait, the carboxylic acid is COOH. How does that react?

Wait, maybe the reaction doesn't affect the carboxylic acid group. Or perhaps it does. Alternatively, maybe the carboxylic acid group is converted into something else. Let me think: carboxylic acids can be reduced to CH2OH groups, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, perhaps under these conditions, the carboxylic acid is converted into an iodide. Alternatively, perhaps it isn't. Maybe the carboxylic acid remains as is.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the reduction of the formyl group, the vinyl group, and the ring, while the carboxylic acid remains unchanged.

Wait, but let's consider what each substitution would do to the index of hydrogen deficiency. Let's calculate the IHD for the product.

First, the original molecule: let's count the rings and double bonds.

The starting material is 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid.

That's a cyclohexene ring (1 ring, 1 double bond), a formyl group (CHO, which has a double bond), and a vinyl group (CH2=CH-, another double bond).

So the starting material has:

- 1 ring
- 3 double bonds (ring, formyl, vinyl)

So total IHD is 1 (ring) + 3 (double bonds) = 4.

But wait, the index of hydrogen deficiency is calculated as the sum of rings and double bonds. Alternatively, each ring or double bond contributes 1 to the IHD.

So, for the starting material, IHD is 4 (1 ring + 3 double bonds).

Now, after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what changes?

Assume that each double bond is saturated, and any rings are opened.

Wait, if the cyclohexene ring is hydrogenated to cyclohexane, that removes the ring (so -1 to IHD) and adds two H's, but the double bond is gone.

The formyl group (CHO) becomes CH2I. That's a reduction, removing a double bond, so -1 to IHD.

The vinyl group (CH2=CH-) becomes CH2CH2 (but that's just a single bond, so another -1 to IHD.

So the product would have:

- No rings (if the cyclohexene ring is saturated)
- No double bonds in substituents (formyl and vinyl groups are saturated)

So the product would have IHD of 0.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The cyclohexene ring is a cyclohexane after hydrogenation. The formyl group is CH2I, which has no double bonds. The vinyl group is CH2CH3, which also has no double bonds. So the product would have no rings and no double bonds, so IHD is 0.

But wait, the carboxylic acid group (COOH) would still be present, but that doesn't contribute to IHD because it's a functional group, not a ring or double bond.

So the product's IHD would be zero. So the answer is D) 0.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure about the reaction conditions. Let me think again about the reaction. Red phosphorus and HI are used, so maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation? Or perhaps the reaction is adding HI across the double bonds.

Wait, in the presence of excess HI, maybe all the double bonds are saturated, adding H and I across each. So the product would have no double bonds or rings, leading to IHD zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the carboxylic acid is converted into something else. For example, perhaps it's decarboxylated. But I'm not sure how that would affect the IHD.

Wait, if the carboxylic acid group is converted into something else, like an alcohol or an ether, but that wouldn't change the IHD because those don't contribute to it.

So, putting it all together, the product would have no rings and no double bonds, so IHD is 0. Thus, the correct answer is D) 0.


To determine the index of hydrogen deficiency (IHD) of the product, we first analyze the starting material, 2-formyl-5-vinylcyclohex-3-enecarboxylic acid. The molecule contains:

1. A **cyclohexene ring** (a six-membered ring with one double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD).
2. A **formyl group (CHO)** (contains a double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD).
3. A **vinyl group (CH₂=CH-)** (contains a double bond, contributing 1 to the IHD).

Thus, the starting material has **3 double bonds** and **1 ring**, giving it an IHD of:

\[
\text{IHD} = 1 \, (\text{ring}) + 3 \, (\text{double bonds}) = 4
\]

When the molecule reacts with red phosphorus and excess HI, the following transformations occur:

1. The **cyclohexene ring** (C₃=C₄) is hydrogenated, converting the double bond into a single bond and forming a cyclohexane ring. This eliminates the ring contribution to the IHD (-1).
2. The **formyl group (CHO)** is reduced to a CH₂I group, eliminating the double bond in the formyl group (-1).
3. The **vinyl group (CH₂=CH-)** is hydrogenated, converting the double bond into a single bond and forming a CH₂CH₃ group (-1).

After these transformations, the product contains **no rings and no double bonds**. Therefore, the IHD of the product is:

\[
\text{IHD} = 0
\]

The correct answer is:

**Answer: D**
