Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about treating 1-bromobenzene-2-d with NaNH2 in a condensed ammonia solvent. Hmm, wait, 1-bromobenzene-2-d... Oh, wait, I think that's a typo. Because 1-bromo and 2-dâ€”maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? I'm a bit confused. Or perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? Wait, no, the question says 2-d, which probably means 2-dimethyl. But wait, benzene with two substituents? Let me clarify.

Wait, the structure is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So, numbering the benzene ring, position 1 is bromine, and position 2 has a "d". Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Oh, wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene? No, wait, perhaps the 'd' stands for something else. Alternatively, maybe it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene, which would be o-dimethyl bromobenzene. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, but I'm not entirely sure. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Because the way it's written, '1-bromobenzene-2-d' might imply that in position 2, there's a methyl group, but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the correct structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which would have methyl groups at positions 2 and 4, and bromine at position 1.

Wait, but benzene is a ring with six positions. So, number 1 is the bromine, number 2 is a methyl group, and perhaps number 4 is another methyl group. That would make it 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Alternatively, maybe only position 2 has a methyl group. Hmm.

Wait, but the question's structure is written as 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So the '2-d' might indicate a substituent at position 2. So perhaps it's 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene? No, that would require two methyl groups. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction more.

The reagent is NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. That's a strong base, used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. In aromatic chemistry, NaNH2 is often used for deprotonation, especially in situations where you want to form a benzene ring with a strong base, maybe leading to elimination or substitution.

Wait, but wait. Another context: when you have a benzene ring with a leaving group like bromine, and perhaps some activating groups, the base may cause elimination, or maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation leading to a diene? Or perhaps it's a substitution reaction.

Alternatively, NaNH2 is a strong base and can induce elimination, especially in aliphatic systems, but in aromatic chemistry, it's more about deprotonating acidic hydrogens. Wait, but in this case, the benzene ring has substituents. So, maybe this is a case of removing a proton to form a benzene ring with a negative charge, leading to some elimination.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, resulting in the formation of a triple bond. For example, if the starting material is a chlorobenzene with adjacent substituents, NaNH2 might cause elimination to form a benzene ring with a triple bond.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is 1-bromobenzene-2-d. So, perhaps the structure is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. Because the 'd' might be a typo or shorthand. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is also known as isopropyl bromobenzene or something similar. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the possible reaction. If we have a benzene ring with a bromine and some methyl groups, and we treat it with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia, what happens?

In aromatic chemistry, NaNH2 is used for dehydrohalogenation. For example, in ethyl benzene or other aryl halides, NaNH2 can remove a proton and an adjacent leaving group to form a ring contraction or expansion? Or perhaps elimination to form a triple bond.

Wait, another possibility: if the benzene ring has a substituent adjacent to the bromine, like a methyl group, the base could abstract a proton, leading to the formation of a benzynes intermediate, which can undergo various reactions, including ring expansion or contraction.

Wait, but let's get back to the structure. Suppose the structure is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene. So, bromine is at position 1, and a methyl group is at position 2. Then, the molecule has adjacent substituents. If we treat this with NaNH2, which is a strong base, we might abstract a proton from the adjacent methyl group.

Wait, but methyl groups are not acidic, their protons have pKa around 48, which is higher than the conjugate base of benzene (which is around 45). So, maybe the base isn't abstracting a methyl proton. Alternatively, perhaps the base is abstracting a proton from the benzene ring in an ortho position to the bromine.

Wait, but wait. In the benzene ring, the protons ortho to a substituent can be more acidic if the substituent is electron-withdrawing. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group (due to its electronegativity and inductive effect), so the ortho protons would be more acidic than benzene's protons. So, the protons in positions 2 and 6 (relative to the bromine at position 1) are more acidic.

So, in 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, the ortho positions to bromine are positions 2 and 6. Wait, position 2 already has a methyl group, so the only available ortho position is position 6. So, the base could deprotonate the hydrogen at position 6, leading to a benzene ring with a negative charge at position 6 and the bromine at position 1.

Wait, but deprotonation would lead to a carbanion intermediate. So, perhaps the base (NH2^-) abstracts a proton from position 6, leading to a carbanion at position 6. Then, the bromide ion could leave, resulting in a ring contraction or expansion, or perhaps a benzene ring with a triple bond.

Wait, but benzene can't form a triple bond easily. Alternatively, if the ring has a double bond, but that's not possible. Hmm, maybe it's a case of forming a benzene ring with a triple bond, which would require elimination of H and Br.

Wait, but the ring has six members. If you eliminate H and Br, you would form a triple bond, which would imply a smaller ring. Wait, that's not possible, because benzene is six-membered, so eliminating two atoms (H and Br) would require the ring to contract to five members, which is unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. Wait, but that wouldn't fit because that's where the bromine is. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the base causes elimination of H and Br, forming a triple bond between positions 2 and 3, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the possible products. The reaction of an aryl bromide with a strong base like NaNH2 in ammonia is typically used for dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of benzynes. Benzynes are aryne intermediates, which can undergo various reactions, including ring expansion or contraction, or cycloaddition.

But in this case, the reaction is in ammonia, which is a protic solvent. Wait, no, actually, NaNH2 is used in a deprotonation reaction. Wait, no, wait: NaNH2 is a strong base, but the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a good solvent for such reactions.

Hmm, let me try to think of the specific structure. Let's assume the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So, the benzene ring has bromine at position 1, methyl groups at 2 and 4. Then, the structure would be symmetrical.

In that case, treating with NaNH2 would deprotonate where? The positions adjacent to the bromine (positions 2 and 6) are ortho, but position 2 has a methyl group. So the available ortho position is position 6. But wait, if the ring has methyl groups at 2 and 4, then the positions adjacent to the bromine are 2 (methyl) and 6 (if it's H). So, the base would abstract a proton at position 6, leading to a carbanion.

Then, the bromide would leave, but wait, the ring is already substituted. If the bromide leaves, perhaps it would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 6 (but that's not adjacent). No, wait, when the carbanion is at position 6, and the bromide leaves, the ring would lose H and Br, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 6? That would require a five-membered ring, which isn't possible. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a triple bond in the ring. Wait, benzynes have a triple bond, but they are typically formed from dihalobenzenes. For example, 1,2-dibromobenzene can form benzyne upon treatment with a strong base. So, maybe if our starting material is a di-substituted benzene with bromine and another group, perhaps elimination can occur.

Wait, but in our case, the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is a tri-substituted benzene. So, when we deprotonate, say, position 6, and the bromide leaves, then positions 1 and 6 would have a triple bond. But that's not possible because that would require a five-membered ring. So perhaps that's not the right path.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but rather a substitution. But NaNH2 is more of a base than a nucleophile, so perhaps substitution isn't the main pathway here.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a triple bond. So, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, upon deprotonation at position 2, elimination of H and Br would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. But wait, position 2 has a methyl group; that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Then, the substituents are at positions 1 (Br), 2 (Me), and 4 (Me). So, the structure is symmetric. Now, the base could deprotonate either the ortho position relative to Br, but in this case, position 6 is available (since 2 is occupied by a methyl, and 4 is methyl, but 6 is adjacent to Br at 1). So, deprotonating at 6 would give a carbanion. Then, the bromide would leave, leading to a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. But that's a six-membered ring, so a triple bond between positions 1 and 6 would require a longer bond, which isn't possible in a six-membered ring.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the benzene ring. Positions are 1 (Br), 2 (Me), 4 (Me). So, the ring looks like this: Br at 1, Me at 2 and 4. The remaining positions are 3, 5, and 6. So, if the base abstracts a proton from position 3 or 5, which are next to the methyl groups.

Wait, but position 3 is next to Me at 2 and 4. Position 5 is next to Me at 4 and Br at 1. Hmm, maybe the base can abstract a proton from position 5. Let's see: the base removes a proton from position 5, leading to a carbanion at 5. Then, perhaps the bromide leaves, forming a triple bond between 1 and 5. Wait, but that's not adjacent. Alternatively, perhaps elimination leads to a triple bond between positions 5 and 6, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 2 and 3. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of possible products. If the reaction produces a benzyne, which is a triple bond in the benzene ring, then the number of possible products depends on the symmetry of the starting material.

So, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is symmetric (since positions 2 and 4 are both methyl), the elimination would lead to the same product regardless of which side the elimination occurs. Because the starting material is symmetrical, the benzyne would form in a way that doesn't create new stereoisomers or positional isomers.

Wait, but benzyne itself is a planar molecule, so all possible positions lead to the same structure. Alternatively, the elimination would form a triple bond between two adjacent positions, but in a symmetric starting material, only one benzyne product is possible.

Wait, but let me think. In 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, the bromine is at position 1, and methyl groups at 2 and 4. So, the structure is symmetrical across the axis through position 1 and the center between 3 and 5. So, if elimination occurs between positions 1 and 2, the triple bond would be between 1 and 2. Alternatively, if elimination occurs between positions 1 and 6, the triple bond would be between 1 and 6.

But wait, position 6 is adjacent to position 1. But in this structure, position 6 is next to position 1, but also next to position 5. Hmm, but in the starting material, position 6 is a hydrogen. So, the base could deprotonate position 6, and then eliminate the bromide.

If that happens, the triple bond would be between 1 and 6. But in that case, the ring would have a triple bond, but that's a six-membered ring, which can't form a triple bond because that would make it four-membered if you have a triple bond between adjacent positions. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a triple bond in the ring, but the ring remains six-membered. So, the triple bond would be between positions 1 and 2, making the ring have a triple bond between adjacent carbons. But that's not possible in a six-membered ring because that would require a longer bond, which is impossible. So, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction differently. Another possibility is that the base deprotonates a hydrogen adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which can then eliminate the bromide to form a triple bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but forms a benzene ring with a methyl group and a nitro group or something, but I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 in ammonia can also act as a strong base to induce elimination in aliphatic systems. But in this case, the substituents are on the benzene ring, so perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But for that to happen, the ring should be activated towards substitution, which usually requires electron-donating groups. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, so the ring is deactivated, making nucleophilic substitution unlikely. So, more likely, elimination is the pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a benzene ring substituents leading to multiple products. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps the base could deprotonate different positions, leading to different products. For example, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, the base could deprotonate either position 3, 5, or 6, leading to different elimination products. But I'm not sure.

Let me try to draw this structure. So, benzene ring with Br at position 1, Me at 2 and 4. So, positions 2 and 4 are methyl, position 1 is Br, and the other positions are H.

So, positions available for deprotonation are 3, 5, and 6.

If the base abstracts a proton from position 3, which is adjacent to the methyl at position 2, then elimination would occur between position 3 and Br. But wait, position 3 is meta to Br. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, abstracting a proton from position 5, which is adjacent to the methyl at position 4. So, after deprotonation, elimination of Br would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 5? But that's not adjacent, so that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the elimination would form a triple bond between positions 2 and 3. Let me think: if the base abstracts a proton from position 3, which is adjacent to methyl at position 2, then elimination of H and Br would form a triple bond between 2 and 3. But wait, the Br is at position 1, so that's not adjacent.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at 1. So, deprotonation at 6, then elimination of Br would form a triple bond between 1 and 6. But that's adjacent, so it's possible.

Wait, but benzene can't have a triple bond between two adjacent positions because that would make a four-membered ring if you eliminate. No, wait, the benzene ring remains six-membered. So, if you have a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, that would require the ring to have triple bond, but benzene can't do that. So perhaps that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent that is a propargyl group. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think of the starting material as 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene, which would have two methyl groups at position 2. So, the structure is more like a isopropyl group attached to the benzene at position 2, with bromine at position 1. So, when treated with NaNH2, perhaps the base deprotonates position 3 (next to the isopropyl group), leading to elimination of H and Br, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. But again, that would require a triple bond between adjacent carbons in a six-membered ring, which isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a double bond. Wait, but how? Benzene already has three double bonds. Hmm.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so maybe I should think about what the possible products are when an aryl bromide is treated with a strong base like NaNH2. Typically, this is used for the synthesis of benzynes. Benzynes are aryne intermediates formed by dehydrohalogenation of dihalobenzenes. But in this case, the starting material is mono-brominated, so perhaps it's not possible to form a benzyne directly. Unless there's another leaving group.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is mono-brominated, so perhaps elimination isn't possible. Or maybe the methyl groups act as leaving groups? No, methyl groups aren't good leaving groups. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. If the base deprotonates a hydrogen, making a carbanion, which then substitutes the bromide. But that would require a good leaving group, which bromide is, but substitution on an aromatic ring requires specific conditions. Since the ring is deactivated, it's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the base causes the formation of a benzene ring with a methyl group and a nitro group, but that doesn't make sense with the reagent given.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a methyl group and a carbanion, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the number of possible products. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4. If the starting material is symmetric, like 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, then the elimination would lead to only one product, because the structure is symmetric. Alternatively, if there are multiple positions where elimination can occur, leading to different products.

Wait, but in this starting material, the two methyl groups are at positions 2 and 4. So, if the base deprotonates at position 6, which is adjacent to the bromine, elimination would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. But that's a six-membered ring; however, a triple bond between 1 and 6 would not be adjacent, so that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps elimination occurs between positions 2 and 3, but that's not adjacent to the bromine.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination doesn't occur, and the reaction doesn't proceed. But that's unlikely because the question is asking about possible products.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. For example, perhaps the base induces a ring expansion. But that would require a substituent that can form a larger ring.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a new substituent on the benzene ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the formation of phenol. No, because NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile. Plus, the reaction conditions don't involve water or other nucleophiles.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction involves the formation of a methyl group adjacent to the bromine, leading to a possible elimination. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, which is o-bromotoluene. So, when treated with NaNH2, the base deprotonates the methyl group's hydrogen. But wait, methyl protons are not very acidic; their pKa is around 48, which is higher than that of the benzylic position. So, perhaps the base can abstract a proton from the aromatic ring.

In o-bromotoluene, the ortho position to bromine is the position where the methyl group is. So, the available ortho position to bromine is position 6. So, the base could abstract a proton from position 6, leading to a carbanion. Then, the bromide leaves, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. But that's a six-membered ring with a triple bond, which is not possible. So perhaps a different approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 3, which is meta to bromine, leading to a different elimination. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the methyl group, but as I thought earlier, methyl protons are not very acidic. So maybe that's not feasible.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a nucleophilic substitution. But I don't think so because the ring is deactivated, and NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what the possible products are.

If the reaction forms a benzyne, then the number of possible products depends on the starting material's symmetry. For instance, if the starting material is symmetric, then only one benzyne product is possible. But if the starting material is asymmetric, multiple products could form.

In our case, the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is symmetric. So, elimination would lead to only one benzyne product. So, the number of products would be one.

Wait, but the question is about possible organic products. So, if the reaction forms benzyne, which is a diene, perhaps it can undergo other reactions, but in the given conditions, perhaps it just forms benzyne as the product, leading to only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but the question implies that a reaction occurs.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that the reaction doesn't form a triple bond but results in the loss of H and Br, leading to a benzene ring with a double bond. But that's not possible because the benzene ring is already fully conjugated.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction removes H and Br, leading to a ring contraction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B) 1, implying only one product forms.

But wait, I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again. If the starting material is symmetric, like 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, then the elimination would occur in a way that produces only one benzyne product. So, one product.

Alternatively, if the starting material were asymmetric, multiple products could form. But in this case, it's symmetric, so only one product.

So, the number of possible organic products is 1. So, the answer would be option B.

The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene with NaNHâ‚‚ in condensed ammonia. NaNHâ‚‚ is a strong base that typically induces dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of benzynes (aryne intermediates) by eliminating a proton and the leaving group (bromine) from adjacent positions on the benzene ring. 

In the given structure, bromine is at position 1, and methyl groups are at positions 2 and 4, making the molecule symmetric. The base can abstract a proton from position 6, which is ortho to the bromine. This deprotonation leads to the elimination of the bromine atom, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. Due to the symmetry of the starting material, only one benzyne product is possible, as the elimination occurs in a single, well-defined manner.

Thus, the reaction produces only one organic product.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So the available ortho position is position 6. But wait, if the ring has methyl groups at 2 and 4, then the positions adjacent to the bromine are 2 (methyl) and 6 (if it's H). So, the base would abstract a proton at position 6, leading to a carbanion.

Then, the bromide would leave, but wait, the ring is already substituted. If the bromide leaves, perhaps it would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 6 (but that's not adjacent). No, wait, when the carbanion is at position 6, and the bromide leaves, the ring would lose H and Br, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 6? That would require a five-membered ring, which isn't possible. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a triple bond in the ring. Wait, benzynes have a triple bond, but they are typically formed from dihalobenzenes. For example, 1,2-dibromobenzene can form benzyne upon treatment with a strong base. So, maybe if our starting material is a di-substituted benzene with bromine and another group, perhaps elimination can occur.

Wait, but in our case, the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is a tri-substituted benzene. So, when we deprotonate, say, position 6, and the bromide leaves, then positions 1 and 6 would have a triple bond. But that's not possible because that would require a five-membered ring. So perhaps that's not the right path.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but rather a substitution. But NaNH2 is more of a base than a nucleophile, so perhaps substitution isn't the main pathway here.

Wait, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of a triple bond. So, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, upon deprotonation at position 2, elimination of H and Br would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. But wait, position 2 has a methyl group; that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the correct structure is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Then, the substituents are at positions 1 (Br), 2 (Me), and 4 (Me). So, the structure is symmetric. Now, the base could deprotonate either the ortho position relative to Br, but in this case, position 6 is available (since 2 is occupied by a methyl, and 4 is methyl, but 6 is adjacent to Br at 1). So, deprotonating at 6 would give a carbanion. Then, the bromide would leave, leading to a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. But that's a six-membered ring, so a triple bond between positions 1 and 6 would require a longer bond, which isn't possible in a six-membered ring.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the benzene ring. Positions are 1 (Br), 2 (Me), 4 (Me). So, the ring looks like this: Br at 1, Me at 2 and 4. The remaining positions are 3, 5, and 6. So, if the base abstracts a proton from position 3 or 5, which are next to the methyl groups.

Wait, but position 3 is next to Me at 2 and 4. Position 5 is next to Me at 4 and Br at 1. Hmm, maybe the base can abstract a proton from position 5. Let's see: the base removes a proton from position 5, leading to a carbanion at 5. Then, perhaps the bromide leaves, forming a triple bond between 1 and 5. Wait, but that's not adjacent. Alternatively, perhaps elimination leads to a triple bond between positions 5 and 6, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a benzene ring with a triple bond between positions 2 and 3. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of possible products. If the reaction produces a benzyne, which is a triple bond in the benzene ring, then the number of possible products depends on the symmetry of the starting material.

So, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is symmetric (since positions 2 and 4 are both methyl), the elimination would lead to the same product regardless of which side the elimination occurs. Because the starting material is symmetrical, the benzyne would form in a way that doesn't create new stereoisomers or positional isomers.

Wait, but benzyne itself is a planar molecule, so all possible positions lead to the same structure. Alternatively, the elimination would form a triple bond between two adjacent positions, but in a symmetric starting material, only one benzyne product is possible.

Wait, but let me think. In 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, the bromine is at position 1, and methyl groups at 2 and 4. So, the structure is symmetrical across the axis through position 1 and the center between 3 and 5. So, if elimination occurs between positions 1 and 2, the triple bond would be between 1 and 2. Alternatively, if elimination occurs between positions 1 and 6, the triple bond would be between 1 and 6.

But wait, position 6 is adjacent to position 1. But in this structure, position 6 is next to position 1, but also next to position 5. Hmm, but in the starting material, position 6 is a hydrogen. So, the base could deprotonate position 6, and then eliminate the bromide.

If that happens, the triple bond would be between 1 and 6. But in that case, the ring would have a triple bond, but that's a six-membered ring, which can't form a triple bond because that would make it four-membered if you have a triple bond between adjacent positions. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination leads to a triple bond in the ring, but the ring remains six-membered. So, the triple bond would be between positions 1 and 2, making the ring have a triple bond between adjacent carbons. But that's not possible in a six-membered ring because that would require a longer bond, which is impossible. So, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reaction differently. Another possibility is that the base deprotonates a hydrogen adjacent to the bromine, leading to the formation of a benzene ring with a negative charge, which can then eliminate the bromide to form a triple bond elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but forms a benzene ring with a methyl group and a nitro group or something, but I don't see how that would happen.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 in ammonia can also act as a strong base to induce elimination in aliphatic systems. But in this case, the substituents are on the benzene ring, so perhaps the reaction is different.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a nucleophilic aromatic substitution. But for that to happen, the ring should be activated towards substitution, which usually requires electron-donating groups. Bromine is an electron-withdrawing group, so the ring is deactivated, making nucleophilic substitution unlikely. So, more likely, elimination is the pathway.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a benzene ring substituents leading to multiple products. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps the base could deprotonate different positions, leading to different products. For example, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, the base could deprotonate either position 3, 5, or 6, leading to different elimination products. But I'm not sure.

Let me try to draw this structure. So, benzene ring with Br at position 1, Me at 2 and 4. So, positions 2 and 4 are methyl, position 1 is Br, and the other positions are H.

So, positions available for deprotonation are 3, 5, and 6.

If the base abstracts a proton from position 3, which is adjacent to the methyl at position 2, then elimination would occur between position 3 and Br. But wait, position 3 is meta to Br. Hmm, perhaps not.

Alternatively, abstracting a proton from position 5, which is adjacent to the methyl at position 4. So, after deprotonation, elimination of Br would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 5? But that's not adjacent, so that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps the elimination would form a triple bond between positions 2 and 3. Let me think: if the base abstracts a proton from position 3, which is adjacent to methyl at position 2, then elimination of H and Br would form a triple bond between 2 and 3. But wait, the Br is at position 1, so that's not adjacent.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 6, which is adjacent to Br at 1. So, deprotonation at 6, then elimination of Br would form a triple bond between 1 and 6. But that's adjacent, so it's possible.

Wait, but benzene can't have a triple bond between two adjacent positions because that would make a four-membered ring if you eliminate. No, wait, the benzene ring remains six-membered. So, if you have a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, that would require the ring to have triple bond, but benzene can't do that. So perhaps that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a substituent that is a propargyl group. Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think of the starting material as 1-bromo-2-dimethylbenzene, which would have two methyl groups at position 2. So, the structure is more like a isopropyl group attached to the benzene at position 2, with bromine at position 1. So, when treated with NaNH2, perhaps the base deprotonates position 3 (next to the isopropyl group), leading to elimination of H and Br, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 2. But again, that would require a triple bond between adjacent carbons in a six-membered ring, which isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction forms a benzene ring with a double bond. Wait, but how? Benzene already has three double bonds. Hmm.

I'm getting a bit stuck, so maybe I should think about what the possible products are when an aryl bromide is treated with a strong base like NaNH2. Typically, this is used for the synthesis of benzynes. Benzynes are aryne intermediates formed by dehydrohalogenation of dihalobenzenes. But in this case, the starting material is mono-brominated, so perhaps it's not possible to form a benzyne directly. Unless there's another leaving group.

Wait, but in this case, the starting material is mono-brominated, so perhaps elimination isn't possible. Or maybe the methyl groups act as leaving groups? No, methyl groups aren't good leaving groups. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution. If the base deprotonates a hydrogen, making a carbanion, which then substitutes the bromide. But that would require a good leaving group, which bromide is, but substitution on an aromatic ring requires specific conditions. Since the ring is deactivated, it's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe the base causes the formation of a benzene ring with a methyl group and a nitro group, but that doesn't make sense with the reagent given.

Wait, perhaps the reaction leads to the formation of a benzene ring with a methyl group and a carbanion, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the number of possible products. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4. If the starting material is symmetric, like 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, then the elimination would lead to only one product, because the structure is symmetric. Alternatively, if there are multiple positions where elimination can occur, leading to different products.

Wait, but in this starting material, the two methyl groups are at positions 2 and 4. So, if the base deprotonates at position 6, which is adjacent to the bromine, elimination would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. But that's a six-membered ring; however, a triple bond between 1 and 6 would not be adjacent, so that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps elimination occurs between positions 2 and 3, but that's not adjacent to the bromine.

Alternatively, perhaps the elimination doesn't occur, and the reaction doesn't proceed. But that's unlikely because the question is asking about possible products.

Wait, maybe the reaction isn't elimination but something else. For example, perhaps the base induces a ring expansion. But that would require a substituent that can form a larger ring.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction forms a new substituent on the benzene ring. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is about the formation of phenol. No, because NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile. Plus, the reaction conditions don't involve water or other nucleophiles.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the reaction involves the formation of a methyl group adjacent to the bromine, leading to a possible elimination. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is 1-bromo-2-methylbenzene, which is o-bromotoluene. So, when treated with NaNH2, the base deprotonates the methyl group's hydrogen. But wait, methyl protons are not very acidic; their pKa is around 48, which is higher than that of the benzylic position. So, perhaps the base can abstract a proton from the aromatic ring.

In o-bromotoluene, the ortho position to bromine is the position where the methyl group is. So, the available ortho position to bromine is position 6. So, the base could abstract a proton from position 6, leading to a carbanion. Then, the bromide leaves, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. But that's a six-membered ring with a triple bond, which is not possible. So perhaps a different approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from position 3, which is meta to bromine, leading to a different elimination. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a proton from the methyl group, but as I thought earlier, methyl protons are not very acidic. So maybe that's not feasible.

Wait, perhaps the reaction isn't elimination but a nucleophilic substitution. But I don't think so because the ring is deactivated, and NaNH2 is a strong base, not a nucleophile.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what the possible products are.

If the reaction forms a benzyne, then the number of possible products depends on the starting material's symmetry. For instance, if the starting material is symmetric, then only one benzyne product is possible. But if the starting material is asymmetric, multiple products could form.

In our case, the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is symmetric. So, elimination would lead to only one benzyne product. So, the number of products would be one.

Wait, but the question is about possible organic products. So, if the reaction forms benzyne, which is a diene, perhaps it can undergo other reactions, but in the given conditions, perhaps it just forms benzyne as the product, leading to only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed, but the question implies that a reaction occurs.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that the reaction doesn't form a triple bond but results in the loss of H and Br, leading to a benzene ring with a double bond. But that's not possible because the benzene ring is already fully conjugated.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction removes H and Br, leading to a ring contraction, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B) 1, implying only one product forms.

But wait, I'm not entirely certain. Let me think again. If the starting material is symmetric, like 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, then the elimination would occur in a way that produces only one benzyne product. So, one product.

Alternatively, if the starting material were asymmetric, multiple products could form. But in this case, it's symmetric, so only one product.

So, the number of possible organic products is 1. So, the answer would be option B.


The reaction involves treating 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene with NaNHâ‚‚ in condensed ammonia. NaNHâ‚‚ is a strong base that typically induces dehydrohalogenation, leading to the formation of benzynes (aryne intermediates) by eliminating a proton and the leaving group (bromine) from adjacent positions on the benzene ring. 

In the given structure, bromine is at position 1, and methyl groups are at positions 2 and 4, making the molecule symmetric. The base can abstract a proton from position 6, which is ortho to the bromine. This deprotonation leads to the elimination of the bromine atom, forming a triple bond between positions 1 and 6. Due to the symmetry of the starting material, only one benzyne product is possible, as the elimination occurs in a single, well-defined manner.

Thus, the reaction produces only one organic product.

Answer: B
