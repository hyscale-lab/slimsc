Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the scenario is that we have a single atom, and we're monitoring it. The question gives me some information: the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So, if we have a bunch of these atoms, after 100 minutes, 32% of them would have decayed. But this is a single atom, so we're dealing with probabilities here.

Wait, so the question is about the probability that this particular atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, but we've already waited 50 minutes and it hasn't decayed yet. Hmm. So the total time from when we started monitoring is 50 minutes, and we're looking at the next 150, so 200 minutes in total. But I think that's not the right way to look at it. Let me clarify.

No, wait, the initial 100 minutes refers to the half-life or something else? Oh no, wait, the decay probability is 32% within 100 minutes. So maybe it's using a different model than the half-life. Because 32% is less than half, so perhaps it's using an exponential decay model where the probability is given for a certain time period.

Wait a second, I remember that in radioactive decay, the decay process is memoryless, meaning that the probability of decay doesn't depend on how much time has already passed. So the fact that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed shouldn't affect the probability of it decaying in the next 150. But wait, that's only if the decay is modeled with a half-life, right?

Wait, no. Let's think again. The key here is whether the decay follows an exponential decay model, which it does. So the probability that the atom decays in a given time period is independent of how much time has already passed. So the 32% is the probability that the atom decays within the first 100 minutes. But after 50 minutes, the remaining time is 150 minutes. So is the probability for the next 150 minutes the same as for 100 minutes? Or is it additive?

Wait, no. The 32% is the probability for the first 100 minutes. So the decay constant is such that in 100 minutes, 32% decay. Let me model this.

In exponential decay, the probability that a nucleus decays in a time interval t is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). So for t=100 minutes, P(100) = 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Which means e^(-λ*100) = 0.68. Take natural log: -λ*100 = ln(0.68), so λ = - ln(0.68)/100 ≈ (0.3857)/100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me calculate that again. If e^(-λ T) = 1 - P, where P is the probability of decay. Wait, no. Wait, the probability that it hasn't decayed by time T is e^(-λ T). So the probability it decays by time T is 1 - e^(-λ T). So in this case, 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32. So e^(-λ *100) = 0.68. So λ = -ln(0.68) / 100. Let me compute that. ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but let me get precise. ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is, given that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, what is the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But the process is memoryless, so the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200.

Alternatively, the probability that it hasn't decayed by t=50 is e^(-λ *50). Then, the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 is [1 - e^(-λ *200)] - [1 - e^(-λ *50)] = e^(-λ *50) - e^(-λ *200).

Alternatively, since the decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute interval. So P = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. The initial 32% is the probability of decay in the first 100 minutes. So the decay constant λ is such that in 100 minutes, 32% decay.

But when we wait 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed yet. So the remaining time to consider is 150 minutes. But if the decay is exponential, the survival probability after 50 minutes is e^(-λ *50). So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in any 150-minute period, because the memoryless property says that the past doesn't affect the future.

Alternatively, the probability of decaying between t=50 and t=200 is [1 - e^(-λ *200)] - [1 - e^(-λ *50)] = e^(-λ *50) - e^(-λ *200).

Wait, but let me calculate both approaches.

Approach 1: Calculate the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

So the conditional probability P( decay in next 150 | not decayed in first 50 ) = [Probability that it decays in 50-200] / [Probability that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes].

Which is [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50) ) = 1 - e^(-λ*150). Because when you compute that fraction, the e^(-λ*50) cancels out, leaving 1 - e^(-λ *150 ).

Ah, so it's the same as the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes without any prior time. Because the memoryless property makes the conditional probability depend only on the remaining time. So P = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

So now, I can compute this.

First, find λ from the 100-minute data.

As before, 1 - e^(-λ *100) = 0.32 → e^(-λ *100) = 0.68 → λ = - ln(0.68) / 100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

Now, compute 1 - e^(-λ *150) → 1 - e^(-0.003857 *150).

Calculate 0.003857 * 150 = 0.57855.

So e^(-0.57855) ≈ Let me compute that. e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. So 0.57855 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Maybe I can compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 0.57855:

Using calculator:

e^(-0.57855) ≈ 0.5615 (I think, but let me compute it precisely.

Wait, perhaps I can use a calculator-like approach. Let me think:

We can approximate e^-x using the Taylor series around x=0. But 0.57855 is not very small, so the approximation might not be precise. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it using known values.

Alternatively, use the fact that ln(2) ≈ 0.6931. Oh wait, but 0.57855 is less than that, so e^-0.57855 ≈ 0.562.

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Another approach: Let's compute ln(0.56) = ?

Wait, perhaps I can compute e^-0.57855.

Let me think, for x = 0.57855,

We can write e^-x = 1/(e^x) ≈ 1/(1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6 + x^4/24).

But maybe that's too tedious. Alternatively, knowing that e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488, e^-0.57855 is between those two.

The difference between 0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1 in x, and 0.57855 is 0.07855 above 0.5. So 78.55% of the way from 0.5 to 0.6. Let's see.

The value at x=0.5 is ~0.6065, at x=0.6 it's ~0.5488. The drop from 0.6065 to 0.5488 is about 0.0577 over 0.1 x. So per 0.01 x, that's about 0.577 per x. So for 0.07855, how much?

Wait, maybe a better approach: Using linear approximation between 0.5 and 0.6. At x=0.5, e^-x = 0.6065. The derivative is -e^-x, which at x=0.5 is about -0.6065.

So for a small change Δx, e^-(0.5 + Δx) ≈ e^-0.5 - 0.6065 * Δx.

Here, Δx is 0.07855. So substituting:

Approx e^-0.57855 ≈ 0.6065 - 0.6065 * 0.07855 → 0.6065 * (1 - 0.07855) = 0.6065 * 0.92145 ≈ 0.6065 * 0.92145.

Compute 0.6 * 0.92145 ≈ 0.55287, 0.0065 * 0.92145 ≈ 0.005989. Adding gives approximately 0.55886.

But that's a rough approximation. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator, e^(-0.57855) is approximately 0.5615.

Wait, perhaps a more accurate way: Use the fact that ln(0.5615) is approximately 0.5785.

So e^-0.5785 ≈ 0.5615.

So then, 1 - e^(-0.57855) ≈ 1 - 0.5615 = 0.4385, which is 43.85%.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%, which is close to that.

But wait, let me double-check because earlier I thought the answer would be 32% * (150/100) = 48%, but that's not correct because the decay isn't linear; it's exponential.

Wait, no, I think the initial approach is correct. The 32% is for 100 minutes. So the probability for 150 would be higher than 32%, but according to the calculation, it's about 43.85%, which is 44%, option A.

But wait, the options suggest other numbers. Let me check my calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating λ. Let me go back.

We have 1 - e^(-λ *100) = 0.32 → e^(-100λ) = 0.68 → -100λ = ln(0.68) → λ = ( - ln(0.68) ) / 100.

Compute ln(0.68) numerically. Let me think, ln(1)=0, ln(0.7)=approx -0.35667, ln(0.68) is a bit more negative. Let's compute it accurately.

Using a calculator: ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566.

So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.

Then, for 150 minutes, the exponent is λ *150 = 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849.

Compute e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.5615.

So 1 - 0.5615 = 0.4385, or 43.85% → 44% which is option A.

But wait, the options given are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer would be 32%*(150/100)=48%, but that's incorrect because the decay is exponential, not linear.

Wait, but another approach: The decay probability in a time t is P = 1 - e^(-λ t).

We can compute λ using t=100, P=0.32. Then compute P for t=150.

So yes, as above, which gives 43.85%, so 44%, option A.

But wait, perhaps the question is about the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes after 50, which would be from 50 to 200. So the total time from the start is 200 minutes. So the probability that the atom has decayed by 200 is 1 - e^(-λ *200). Then, the probability that it decayed between 50 and 200 is [1 - e^(-200λ)] - [1 - e^(-50λ)] = e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ).

Wait, but earlier approach using memoryless gives us that the conditional probability is 1-e^(-150λ) =43.85%, which is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from now, regardless of how much time has passed prior. So the 44% is correct.

But another approach: Alternatively, since the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability that it decays in the next 150 is the same as the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200.

So P = [1 - e^(-λ *200)] - [1 - e^(-λ *50)] = e^(-λ *50) - e^(-λ *200).

So let's compute that.

Compute λ=0.0038566 per minute.

e^(-50λ) = e^(-50 * 0.0038566) = e^(-0.19283) ≈ 0.8245.

e^(-200λ) = e^(-200 * 0.0038566) = e^(-0.77132) ≈ 0.4614.

So P = 0.8245 - 0.4614 ≈ 0.3631, which is 36.31%. Hmm, that's not matching my earlier approach. So which approach is correct?

Wait, there's a contradiction here. Why?

Because I think the confusion comes from whether the 32% is the probability up to 100 minutes, or per 100 minutes.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

The key is to model the decay correctly. The decay is an exponential process, so the probability of decay in any interval depends on the time.

The correct approach when we're given that the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes is to calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, the probability is the same as if we were looking at a fresh atom over 150 minutes.

Wait, no. Wait, the memoryless property states that the probability of decay in the next t minutes, given it hasn't decayed for the past T minutes, is the same as the probability of decay in the next t minutes for a new atom. So it's 1 - e^(-λ t), regardless of T.

So in our case, t is 150. So the probability is 1 - e^(-λ *150) = 43.85%, which is option A.

But wait, the other approach gave me 36.31%, which doesn't match. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in that calculation. Let me compute e^(-50λ) and e^(-200λ) again.

λ=0.0038566.

Compute 50λ =50 * 0.0038566 = 0.19283.

e^(-0.19283) is approximately 0.8245, correct.

200λ=200 *0.0038566 = 0.77132.

e^(-0.77132) ≈ 0.4614, correct.

So 0.8245 - 0.4614 = 0.3631 → 36.31% which is 36%, but that's not one of the options. Hmm, so perhaps that approach is wrong.

Wait, but wait. The first approach (the memoryless approach) gave me 43.85%, which is 44%, option A. The second approach, which considers the difference between t=200 and t=50, gave me 36%.

So which one is correct?

Ah! Because when you condition on the fact that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability that it decays in the next 150 is [Probability it decays by 200] minus [Probability it decays by 50] divided by [Probability it hasn't decayed by 50]. Because the conditional probability P(A|B) is P(A and B) / P(B).

In this case, event A is that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., by 200), and event B is that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.

So P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = [P( decay by 200 ) - P( decay by 50 ) ] / [ P( not decay by 50 ) ].

Wait, no. Alternatively, the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 is P( decay by 200 ) - P( decay by 50 ). Which is [1 - e^(-λ *200)] - [1 - e^(-λ *50)] = e^(-λ *50) - e^(-λ *200).

But to get the conditional probability, you divide that by the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50, which is e^(-λ *50).

So P = [e^(-λ *50) - e^(-λ *200)] / e^(-λ *50) ) = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Which brings us back to the same result as the memoryless approach.

So this confirms that the conditional probability is indeed 1 - e^(-λ *150) ≈0.4385 →44%.

So the correct answer is A)44%.

Wait, but why did the other approach give me a different answer? Because I computed the absolute probability of decaying between 50 and 200, which is 36.31%, but that's not the conditional probability. The conditional probability (given it hasn't decayed by 50) is higher, 43.85%.

So the correct answer is A)44%.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves calculating the probability that a single atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. The decay follows an exponential model, and the memoryless property of radioactive decay implies that the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on the remaining time, not on how much time has already passed.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Given Data**: The probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. Using the exponential decay formula:
   \[
   P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
   \]
   where \(P(t)\) is the probability of decay by time \(t\), and \(\lambda\) is the decay constant. For \(t = 100\) minutes:
   \[
   0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
   \]
   Solving for \(\lambda\):
   \[
   e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda = \frac{-\ln(0.68)}{100} \approx 0.003857 \, \text{per minute}.
   \]

2. **Memoryless Property**: Since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval. Using the exponential decay formula for \(t = 150\) minutes:
   \[
   P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}.
   \]
   Substituting \(\lambda \approx 0.003857\):
   \[
   \lambda \cdot 150 = 0.003857 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57855.
   \]
   Compute \(e^{-0.57855}\):
   \[
   e^{-0.57855} \approx 0.5615.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   P(150) = 1 - 0.5615 = 0.4385 \, \text{or} \, 43.85\%.
   \]

3. **Final Answer**: The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%, which corresponds to option **A**.

### Conclusion:
The memoryless property ensures that the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the 50 minutes already passed. The calculation confirms that the probability is approximately 44%.

Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

So the fact that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed shouldn't affect the probability of it decaying in the next 150.

Wait, no. Let's think again. The key here is whether the decay follows an exponential decay model, which it does. So the probability that the atom decays in a given time period is independent of how much time has already passed. So the 32% is the probability that the atom decays within the first 100 minutes. But after 50 minutes, the remaining time is 150 minutes. So is the probability for the next 150 minutes the same as for 100 minutes? Or is it additive?

Wait, no. The 32% is the probability for the first 100 minutes. So the decay constant is such that in 100 minutes, 32% decay. Let me model this.

In exponential decay, the probability that a nucleus decays in a time interval t is given by P(t) = 1 - e^(-λt). So for t=100 minutes, P(100) = 0.32. So 0.32 = 1 - e^(-λ * 100). Which means e^(-λ*100) = 0.68. Take natural log: -λ*100 = ln(0.68), so λ = - ln(0.68)/100 ≈ (0.3857)/100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

Wait, but wait, no. Let me calculate that again. If e^(-λ T) = 1 - P, where P is the probability of decay. Wait, no. Wait, the probability that it hasn't decayed by time T is e^(-λ T). So the probability it decays by time T is 1 - e^(-λ T). So in this case, 1 - e^(-λ * 100) = 0.32. So e^(-λ *100) = 0.68. So λ = -ln(0.68) / 100. Let me compute that. ln(0.68) is approximately ln(2/3) is about -0.405, but let me get precise. ln(0.68) is approximately -0.38566. So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 ≈ 0.0038566 per minute.

Now, the question is, given that 50 minutes have passed and the atom hasn't decayed, what is the probability that it will decay in the next 150 minutes. So the total time from the start would be 50 + 150 = 200 minutes. But the process is memoryless, so the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200.

Alternatively, the probability that it hasn't decayed by t=50 is e^(-λ *50). Then, the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 is [1 - e^(-λ *200)] - [1 - e^(-λ *50)] = e^(-λ *50) - e^(-λ *200).

Alternatively, since the decay is memoryless, the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decaying in any 150-minute interval. So P = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think. The initial 32% is the probability of decay in the first 100 minutes. So the decay constant λ is such that in 100 minutes, 32% decay.

But when we wait 50 minutes, the atom hasn't decayed yet. So the remaining time to consider is 150 minutes. But if the decay is exponential, the survival probability after 50 minutes is e^(-λ *50). So the probability that it decays in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability that it decays in any 150-minute period, because the memoryless property says that the past doesn't affect the future.

Alternatively, the probability of decaying between t=50 and t=200 is [1 - e^(-λ *200)] - [1 - e^(-λ *50)] = e^(-λ *50) - e^(-λ *200).

Wait, but let me calculate both approaches.

Approach 1: Calculate the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes, given that it hasn't decayed in the first 50.

So the conditional probability P( decay in next 150 | not decayed in first 50 ) = [Probability that it decays in 50-200] / [Probability that it hasn't decayed in 50 minutes].

Which is [e^(-λ*50) - e^(-λ*200)] / e^(-λ*50) ) = 1 - e^(-λ*150). Because when you compute that fraction, the e^(-λ*50) cancels out, leaving 1 - e^(-λ *150 ).

Ah, so it's the same as the probability of decaying in the next 150 minutes without any prior time. Because the memoryless property makes the conditional probability depend only on the remaining time. So P = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

So now, I can compute this.

First, find λ from the 100-minute data.

As before, 1 - e^(-λ *100) = 0.32 → e^(-λ *100) = 0.68 → λ = - ln(0.68) / 100 ≈ 0.003857 per minute.

Now, compute 1 - e^(-λ *150) → 1 - e^(-0.003857 *150).

Calculate 0.003857 * 150 = 0.57855.

So e^(-0.57855) ≈ Let me compute that. e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488. So 0.57855 is between 0.5 and 0.6. Maybe I can compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 0.57855:

Using calculator:

e^(-0.57855) ≈ 0.5615 (I think, but let me compute it precisely.

Wait, perhaps I can use a calculator-like approach. Let me think:

Wait, but perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Another approach: Let's compute ln(0.56) = ?

Wait, perhaps I can compute e^-0.57855.

Let me think, for x = 0.57855,

We can write e^-x = 1/(e^x) ≈ 1/(1 + x + x²/2 + x³/6 + x^4/24).

But maybe that's too tedious. Alternatively, knowing that e^-0.5 is about 0.6065, e^-0.6 is about 0.5488, e^-0.57855 is between those two.

The difference between 0.5 and 0.6 is 0.1 in x, and 0.57855 is 0.07855 above 0.5. So 78.55% of the way from 0.5 to 0.6. Let's see.

The value at x=0.5 is ~0.6065, at x=0.6 it's ~0.5488. The drop from 0.6065 to 0.5488 is about 0.0577 over 0.1 x. So per 0.01 x, that's about 0.577 per x. So for 0.07855, how much?

Wait, maybe a better approach: Using linear approximation between 0.5 and 0.6. At x=0.5, e^-x = 0.6065. The derivative is -e^-x, which at x=0.5 is about -0.6065.

So for a small change Δx, e^-(0.5 + Δx) ≈ e^-0.5 - 0.6065 * Δx.

Here, Δx is 0.07855. So substituting:

Approx e^-0.57855 ≈ 0.6065 - 0.6065 * 0.07855 → 0.6065 * (1 - 0.07855) = 0.6065 * 0.92145 ≈ 0.6065 * 0.92145.

Compute 0.6 * 0.92145 ≈ 0.55287, 0.0065 * 0.92145 ≈ 0.005989. Adding gives approximately 0.55886.

But that's a rough approximation. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator, e^(-0.57855) is approximately 0.5615.

Wait, perhaps a more accurate way: Use the fact that ln(0.5615) is approximately 0.5785.

So e^-0.5785 ≈ 0.5615.

So then, 1 - e^(-0.57855) ≈ 1 - 0.5615 = 0.4385, which is 43.85%.

Looking at the options, option A is 44%, which is close to that.

But wait, let me double-check because earlier I thought the answer would be 32% * (150/100) = 48%, but that's not correct because the decay isn't linear; it's exponential.

Wait, no, I think the initial approach is correct. The 32% is for 100 minutes. So the probability for 150 would be higher than 32%, but according to the calculation, it's about 43.85%, which is 44%, option A.

But wait, the options suggest other numbers. Let me check my calculation again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating λ. Let me go back.

We have 1 - e^(-λ *100) = 0.32 → e^(-100λ) = 0.68 → -100λ = ln(0.68) → λ = ( - ln(0.68) ) / 100.

Compute ln(0.68) numerically. Let me think, ln(1)=0, ln(0.7)=approx -0.35667, ln(0.68) is a bit more negative. Let's compute it accurately.

Using a calculator: ln(0.68) ≈ -0.38566.

So λ ≈ 0.38566 / 100 = 0.0038566 per minute.

Then, for 150 minutes, the exponent is λ *150 = 0.0038566 * 150 = 0.57849.

Compute e^-0.57849 ≈ 0.5615.

So 1 - 0.5615 = 0.4385, or 43.85% → 44% which is option A.

But wait, the options given are A)44%, B)40%, C)52%, D)48%.

Wait, but earlier I thought the answer would be 32%*(150/100)=48%, but that's incorrect because the decay is exponential, not linear.

Wait, but another approach: The decay probability in a time t is P = 1 - e^(-λ t).

We can compute λ using t=100, P=0.32. Then compute P for t=150.

So yes, as above, which gives 43.85%, so 44%, option A.

But wait, perhaps the question is about the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes after 50, which would be from 50 to 200. So the total time from the start is 200 minutes. So the probability that the atom has decayed by 200 is 1 - e^(-λ *200). Then, the probability that it decayed between 50 and 200 is [1 - e^(-200λ)] - [1 - e^(-50λ)] = e^(-50λ) - e^(-200λ).

Wait, but earlier approach using memoryless gives us that the conditional probability is 1-e^(-150λ) =43.85%, which is the same as the probability of decaying in 150 minutes from now, regardless of how much time has passed prior. So the 44% is correct.

But another approach: Alternatively, since the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability that it decays in the next 150 is the same as the probability that it decays between t=50 and t=200.

So P = [1 - e^(-λ *200)] - [1 - e^(-λ *50)] = e^(-λ *50) - e^(-λ *200).

So let's compute that.

Compute λ=0.0038566 per minute.

e^(-50λ) = e^(-50 * 0.0038566) = e^(-0.19283) ≈ 0.8245.

e^(-200λ) = e^(-200 * 0.0038566) = e^(-0.77132) ≈ 0.4614.

So P = 0.8245 - 0.4614 ≈ 0.3631, which is 36.31%. Hmm, that's not matching my earlier approach. So which approach is correct?

Wait, there's a contradiction here. Why?

Because I think the confusion comes from whether the 32% is the probability up to 100 minutes, or per 100 minutes.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

The key is to model the decay correctly. The decay is an exponential process, so the probability of decay in any interval depends on the time.

The correct approach when we're given that the atom hasn't decayed for 50 minutes is to calculate the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes. Because of the memoryless property, the probability is the same as if we were looking at a fresh atom over 150 minutes.

Wait, no. Wait, the memoryless property states that the probability of decay in the next t minutes, given it hasn't decayed for the past T minutes, is the same as the probability of decay in the next t minutes for a new atom. So it's 1 - e^(-λ t), regardless of T.

So in our case, t is 150. So the probability is 1 - e^(-λ *150) = 43.85%, which is option A.

But wait, the other approach gave me 36.31%, which doesn't match. So why the discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in that calculation. Let me compute e^(-50λ) and e^(-200λ) again.

λ=0.0038566.

Compute 50λ =50 * 0.0038566 = 0.19283.

e^(-0.19283) is approximately 0.8245, correct.

200λ=200 *0.0038566 = 0.77132.

e^(-0.77132) ≈ 0.4614, correct.

So 0.8245 - 0.4614 = 0.3631 → 36.31% which is 36%, but that's not one of the options. Hmm, so perhaps that approach is wrong.

Wait, but wait. The first approach (the memoryless approach) gave me 43.85%, which is 44%, option A. The second approach, which considers the difference between t=200 and t=50, gave me 36%.

So which one is correct?

Ah! Because when you condition on the fact that the atom hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes, the probability that it decays in the next 150 is [Probability it decays by 200] minus [Probability it decays by 50] divided by [Probability it hasn't decayed by 50]. Because the conditional probability P(A|B) is P(A and B) / P(B).

In this case, event A is that the atom decays in the next 150 minutes (i.e., by 200), and event B is that it hasn't decayed in the first 50 minutes.

So P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = [P( decay by 200 ) - P( decay by 50 ) ] / [ P( not decay by 50 ) ].

Wait, no. Alternatively, the probability that it decays between 50 and 200 is P( decay by 200 ) - P( decay by 50 ). Which is [1 - e^(-λ *200)] - [1 - e^(-λ *50)] = e^(-λ *50) - e^(-λ *200).

But to get the conditional probability, you divide that by the probability that it hasn't decayed by 50, which is e^(-λ *50).

So P = [e^(-λ *50) - e^(-λ *200)] / e^(-λ *50) ) = 1 - e^(-λ *150).

Which brings us back to the same result as the memoryless approach.

So this confirms that the conditional probability is indeed 1 - e^(-λ *150) ≈0.4385 →44%.

So the correct answer is A)44%.

Wait, but why did the other approach give me a different answer? Because I computed the absolute probability of decaying between 50 and 200, which is 36.31%, but that's not the conditional probability. The conditional probability (given it hasn't decayed by 50) is higher, 43.85%.

So the correct answer is A)44%.


The question involves calculating the probability that a single atom will decay in the next 150 minutes, given that it has not decayed in the first 50 minutes. The decay follows an exponential model, and the memoryless property of radioactive decay implies that the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes depends only on the remaining time, not on how much time has already passed.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Given Data**: The probability of decay within 100 minutes is 32%. Using the exponential decay formula:
   \[
   P(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}
   \]
   where \(P(t)\) is the probability of decay by time \(t\), and \(\lambda\) is the decay constant. For \(t = 100\) minutes:
   \[
   0.32 = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 100}
   \]
   Solving for \(\lambda\):
   \[
   e^{-\lambda \cdot 100} = 0.68 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \lambda = \frac{-\ln(0.68)}{100} \approx 0.003857 \, \text{per minute}.
   \]

2. **Memoryless Property**: Since the decay process is memoryless, the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is the same as the probability of decay in any 150-minute interval. Using the exponential decay formula for \(t = 150\) minutes:
   \[
   P(150) = 1 - e^{-\lambda \cdot 150}.
   \]
   Substituting \(\lambda \approx 0.003857\):
   \[
   \lambda \cdot 150 = 0.003857 \cdot 150 \approx 0.57855.
   \]
   Compute \(e^{-0.57855}\):
   \[
   e^{-0.57855} \approx 0.5615.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   P(150) = 1 - 0.5615 = 0.4385 \, \text{or} \, 43.85\%.
   \]

3. **Final Answer**: The probability that the atom will decay in the next 150 minutes is approximately 44%, which corresponds to option **A**.

### Conclusion:
The memoryless property ensures that the probability of decay in the next 150 minutes is independent of the 50 minutes already passed. The calculation confirms that the probability is approximately 44%.
