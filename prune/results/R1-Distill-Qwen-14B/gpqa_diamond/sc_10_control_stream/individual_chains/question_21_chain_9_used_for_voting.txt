Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about isomers. It mentions constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. I remember that constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but different connectivity of atoms. Like how isomers of butane can have different structures. On the other hand, stereoisomers are when the molecules have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements, like in enantiomers or diastereomers.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's tackle them one by one.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which one does NOT show tautomerism?

Hmm. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between adjacent atoms, leading to the formation of different isomers. The most common example is between a keto form and an enol form. For this to happen, the compound must have a structure that allows such a shift, usually involving adjacent carbonyl groups.

Let's look at benzoquinone first. Benzoquinone (I think it's 1,4-benzoquinone) has two ketone groups on a benzene ring, opposite each other. Are there any alpha hydrogens that can shift? Well, the carbonyl groups are on the benzene, so the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring. Benzene rings are stable, and the carbons are sp² hybridized. Typically, in aromatic rings, the carbonyl groups are attached directly without any adjacent hydrogens that can shift, because the adjacent carbons are part of the ring and don't have hydrogens attached. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure of 1,4-benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, so each oxygen is attached to a benzene ring. The carbons next to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring and are sp² hybridized. So, each of those is attached to other ring carbons, not hydrogens. So, I don't think benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens adjacent to carbonyl groups. Without alpha hydrogens, tautomerism isn't possible because there's nothing to shift. So benzoquinone probably doesn't show tautomerism.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. So the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C. Let me visualize it: each of the three ketones is attached to the ring at every other carbon. So the ring has alternating single and double bonds? Or wait, no, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a fully saturated ring with three ketone groups. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring where three of the carbons (1,3,5) are double-bonded to oxygen. Wait, no, ketones are R-CO-R, so each of those carbons is a carbonyl. So the ring is cyclohexane with three ketone groups. So the structure is O=C-C-O-C-C-O-C, arranged in the ring.

Wait, but the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups—so the carbons next to the carbonyls—are they CH2 groups? Because in cyclohexane, each carbon is connected to two others. So positions 1 is a carbonyl, position 2 is connected to 1 and 3, etc. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls (like position 2, 4, 6) would each have two CH2 groups (since they're part of the ring and have two adjacent carbons). So each of those (positions 2,4,6) would have two CH2 groups. Wait, but wait: in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure must have each of the carbonyl groups attached to a CH2 group on each side? No, wait, maybe not. Let me think: the ring is six-membered. Positions 1,3,5 have carbonyl groups. So each O is attached to a carbon in the ring. The adjacent carbons (positions 2,6; 4,2; 6,4, etc.) would be CH2 groups. So, each carbonyl is attached to two CH2 groups. Wait, no—each carbonyl is a C=O, so each is at a position where it's connected to two other carbons in the ring. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (like position 2) would have two substituents: from the ring, they're connected to position 1 (which is a carbonyl) and position 3 (which is another carbonyl). Hmm, but that might mean that position 2 is between two carbonyls, so each position 2,4,6 is a CH2 group, perhaps.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure. But regardless, the key thing is whether the compound has alpha hydrogens—hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. If it does, then tautomerism is possible.

In benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are on a benzene ring, so the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring, which doesn't have hydrogens (since each C in benzene has only one H if any). Wait, no, each carbon in a benzene ring is bonded to one hydrogen. But in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are on the benzene, which is a 6-membered ring with two ketone groups. So, for example, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=O, which would have each carbonyl group attached to a benzene carbon. So each of those carbonyl carbons is connected to two other ring carbons. The adjacent carbons (like positions 2 and 6 for the 1 position) are part of the ring and have one hydrogen each. But wait, in the case of benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (like position 2) are connected to a carbonyl (position 1) and another ring carbon (position 3). So the position 2 carbon is connected to a carbonyl group, a ring carbon (position 3), and has two hydrogens? Or wait, no: each carbon in the benzene ring has one hydrogen, assuming it's not substituted elsewhere. Wait, no, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the ring is fully conjugated with two ketone groups. So the structure is O=C-C6H4=O. So the ring has two oxygen substituents at 1 and 4 positions. So the adjacent carbons (like 2 and 6 for 1, and 3 and 5 for 4) have each a hydrogen because each of those positions is a CH group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, but the main point is whether benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens. Alpha hydrogens are on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. So if the carbonyl is on a benzene ring, the adjacent carbons (like positions 2 and 6) have hydrogens. So, does that mean they are alpha hydrogens and thus can lead to tautomerism?

Wait, wait. For tautomerism to occur, there needs to be a hydrogen on the alpha carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl) that can shift between adjacent positions. But in the case of benzoquinone, the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring, which is conjugated. But I'm not sure if the structure allows for the necessary hydrogen shift. Alternatively, maybe the two carbonyl groups are in positions that don't allow for enol formation because the adjacent positions are already occupied by other carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism because the enol form would require a double bond between the two adjacent carbonyls, but that would create a conjugated dienone, which might not be favorable, or perhaps it's already a quinone structure, so tautomerism isn't possible.

Wait, but wait a second. Let's think about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Each of the three ketone groups is attached to a cyclohexane ring. So the carbons adjacent to each ketone (like positions 2,4,6) have two CH2 groups? Or each is adjacent to another ketone?

Wait, no, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbonyl groups are at positions 1,3,5, which are every other position on the ring. So each of these carbons is connected to two other ring carbons, which are not carbonyls. For example, the carbon at position 1 is connected to positions 6 and 2. Both position 2 and 6 have CH2 groups (since they are not carbonyls). So each of the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (positions 2,4,6) have two CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps each adjacent carbon is a CH2 group. So the carbonyl is at 1, so position 2 has two CH2 groups? No, wait, in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two others. So position 1 is connected to 6 and 2. Position 2 is connected to 1 and 3. If position 3 is a carbonyl, then position 2 is connected to 1 (carbonyl) and 3 (carbonyl). So position 2 would have two carbonyl adjacent carbons, which would make it a CH2 group. So each of the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (positions 2,4,6) would be CH2 groups.

So, for each of the three carbonyl groups in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the adjacent carbons have two CH2 groups. So each of those carbons (positions 2,4,6) have two CH2 groups. So each of these adjacent carbons has two hydrogens. Thus, the molecule has alpha hydrogens on each carbonyl's adjacent carbon. So, can it undergo tautomerism?

Tautomerism typically involves the movement of a hydrogen from an alpha carbon to a carbonyl oxygen, leading to the formation of an enol (if moving from a ketone). So, in this case, could a hydrogen from position 2 shift to the carbonyl at position 1, forming an enol? But wait, if the same ring has a carbonyl at position 3, which is adjacent to position 2, would that affect the possibility? Hmm.

Wait, but each of the alpha carbons (positions 2,4,6) has two CH2 groups. So each alpha carbon (like position 2) is connected to two carbonyls (positions 1 and 3). So if a hydrogen from position 2 moves to position 1's carbonyl, that would form a double bond between 1 and 2, making an enol. But wait, position 2 is adjacent to two carbonyls, so shifting a hydrogen from position 2 would create a double bond between 1 and 2 (making an enol), but position 2 is also next to position 3, which is another carbonyl. So would that lead to a conjugated system? Like, the enol would form a double bond between 1 and 2, and position 2 would be adjacent to another carbonyl (position 3).

Wait, but if the cyclohexane ring is fully saturated, the enol would cause the ring to have a double bond. Hmm, maybe that's possible. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can't undergo tautomerism because the enol form is not more stable. Or maybe the presence of three ketone groups and adjacent CH2 groups allows for tautomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of specific examples. For example, cyclohexanone has alpha hydrogens and can undergo tautomerism (enol formation). But in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each alpha carbon is adjacent to two carbonyl groups. So if a hydrogen from position 2 moves to position 1, the structure would have a double bond between 1 and 2, and position 2 would be a double bond to 3 (since position 3 is a carbonyl). Wait, that would mean position 2 is double bonded to both 1 and 3, which is impossible. So maybe in this case, the molecule can't undergo tautomerism because the shift would create an impossible structure.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The initial structure is a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at 1,3,5. The alpha carbons (positions 2,4,6) each have two CH2 groups. So each of those carbons has two hydrogens. If a hydrogen from position 2 shifts to position 1's carbonyl, that would form a double bond between 1 and 2, turning the carbonyl at 1 into a C-O with a double bond to 2. But then, position 3 is a carbonyl, and position 2 is now double bonded to position 1. So the structure would have a double bond between 1 and 2, and position 3 is a carbonyl, so position 2 is adjacent to a carbonyl on both sides. That seems possible.

Wait, but in that case, the enol form would have a double bond between 1 and 2 and another between 2 and 3? But that would require position 2 to have two double bonds, which isn't possible. So perhaps the molecule can't undergo tautomerism because the structure doesn't allow for a stable enol form.

Alternatively, maybe each shift only affects one position. Like, the hydrogen from position 2 moves to position 1, creating a double bond between 1 and 2. But then, position 3 is a carbonyl, so the structure would have a double bond between 1 and 2, and position 3 is also a carbonyl. So the ring would have two double bonds: 1-2 and 3-4 (if any, but wait, in this case, the shift only affects 1 and 2. So the ring would have a double bond between 1 and 2, but the rest are single bonds. That would make the ring non-aromatic, but it's cyclohexane, which is a six-membered ring with single bonds. So perhaps the enol form is possible, but it's not as stable, but still, the molecule could exhibit tautomerism.

Hmm, now I'm really confused. Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm trying to compare the two compounds. Benzoquinone: two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Each has adjacent carbon atoms that have hydrogens. So, can they form enols? Well, in the case of 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. So each carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring. The adjacent carbons (like positions 2 and 6) each have a hydrogen. So, if a hydrogen from position 2 shifts to the carbonyl at position 1, would that form an enol?

But wait, the benzene ring is aromatic, and the movement would disrupt the conjugation. So the enol form would have a double bond between 1 and 2, making the ring non-aromatic. But that's not favorable, so perhaps benzoquinone doesn't undergo tautomerism.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. Each alpha carbon (like position 2) has two hydrogens. So, the molecule can undergo tautomerism because the enol form is possible without disrupting the ring's conjugation, as it's not a benzene ring.

Wait, but in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the ring isn't aromatic, it's fully saturated (cyclohexane). So the enol form would not affect the aromaticity because it isn't aromatic. So the tautomerism would be possible.

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. The presence of alpha hydrogens is the key here. So, if a compound has alpha hydrogens adjacent to carbonyl groups, it can undergo tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: Each carbonyl group is attached to a benzene ring, and the adjacent carbons have hydrogens. So benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens and should, in theory, undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I thought that in aromatic systems, the conjugation isn't broken, but perhaps the enol form isn't possible because the movement would require a hydrogen to shift to a carbonyl, but the adjacent positions are part of the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens. Wait, no, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl in benzene are part of the ring and each have one hydrogen. So those are alpha hydrogens.

Wait, but in 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are CH groups (each has one hydrogen). So, yes, those are alpha hydrogens. So, they can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but if they can, then both compounds would show tautomerism, but that's not the case, as the question suggests that one doesn't. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe in benzoquinone, the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring, and the hydrogen is on a carbon that's part of the ring. So, when the hydrogen shifts, it would form an enol, but that would mean the ring becomes non-aromatic, which is not favorable. Hence, benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a saturated ring, so shifting a hydrogen from position 2 to position 1's carbonyl would form a double bond between 1 and 2, making a cyclohexene ring. But that's possible, so the molecule can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, so that would mean that benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism (so A is benzoquinone) and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does. Or am I getting it backwards?

Wait, the question asks which compound does NOT show tautomerism. So if benzoquinone doesn't, then A is benzoquinone.

So for part A, the answer is A = benzoquinone.

Now, part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, leading to enantiomers. Alternatively, it can occur due to other forms of asymmetry, like in allenes or certain ring structures.

Let me look at each compound.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. The formula for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. When it's the methyl ester, it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write the structure correctly.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So, structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, the -OH is replaced by -OCH3. So the structure becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or wait, wait, no. Let me think: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but wait, no. The correct structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think in terms of the carbon chain. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but wait, no: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the three carbons are in a straight chain. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be formed between the hydroxyl group and methanol, so it would be CH2(OCH3)CH2COOH? No, wait, esterification occurs between the carboxylic acid and an alcohol. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the carboxylic acid (COOH) is esterified with methanol, and the hydroxyl is on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. It's O

The structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C-OH
|
CH3

Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to write it as CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but in any case, the molecule would have a hydroxyl group on the second carbon and an ester group on the third. So, the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's count the substituents on each carbon.

The central carbon (second carbon) has:

- One hydroxyl group (-OH)
- One CH2 group (attached to the first carbon)
- One CH2COOCH3 group (attached to the third carbon)
- And the fourth substituent: wait, wait, no. Wait, the second carbon is attached to the first (CH2-), the third (CH2COOCH3), an OH, and another CH2? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the structure is:

The molecule is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, the second carbon is connected to:

- The first carbon (CH2-)
- The third carbon (CH2COOCH3)
- An OH group
- And what's the fourth substituent? Oh wait, the second carbon is CH, so it has four substituents: two CH2 groups, an OH, and a hydrogen. Wait, no, wait. Let's number the carbons.

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me arrange it properly.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So carbon 1: CH3, carbon 2: CH(OH), carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, methyl ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3. 2-hydroxy would mean a hydroxyl on the second carbon.

So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, looking at the second carbon (the one with the OH), what are its substituents? It's attached to:

1. The first carbon: CH2- (maybe a methyl group if it's the end, but no, in this case, the first carbon is CH2(OH) connected to another CH2.)

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure.

The molecule is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. No, that can't be right because that would only be three carbons (propanoate has three carbons including the COO- group). Wait, no, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, the second carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to:

- Two CH2 groups (one leading to the methyl group, and one leading to the COOCH3 group)
- An OH group
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, wait. The structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, no, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the molecule is:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
Carbon 2: CH2 connected to carbon 1 and carbon 3.
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, but Carbon 2 would be a CH2, which has two CH2 groups attached, but that can't be right because each carbon can only have four bonds.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think differently. The formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is C4H8O3.

But perhaps it's better to think about the presence of a chiral center. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents.

In the structure, the second carbon (from the left) has:

- A hydroxyl group (-OH)
- A CH3 group (if the first carbon is CH3)
Wait, no, perhaps in the structure, the second carbon is attached to:

- A CH2 group (from carbon 1)
- A COOCH3 group (from carbon 3)
- An OH group
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, let's see:

If the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (CH(OH)) has:

- CH3 group (from the left)
- COOCH3 group (from the right)
- OH group
- And a hydrogen.

So, all four substituents are different: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Thus, the central carbon is a chiral center. So the molecule has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, the other compound is dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. The structure of fumarate is (Z)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester, with two methyl ester groups on each end of the double bond.

The structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So its structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
|
O

Wait, no. The correct structure of fumarate is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, no, that's for succinic acid. Fumarate is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So dimethyl fumarate would be MeO2CCH=CHCO2Me. So the structure is MeO-C-O=C-CH=CH-CO-O-Me.

Wait, no, more accurately, it's CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3)? No, wait, no. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So the structure is O

So dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3? No, wait, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
|
O

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

The structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3? No, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, it's MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOme, but that's succinate. Fumarate has a double bond.

So dimethyl fumarate is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOME? No, that's succinate. Fumarate has a double bond, so it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOme.

Ah, right. So dimethyl fumarate is (Z)- or (E)-dimethyl fumarate. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans (E) isomer of maleic acid, so the double bond is trans.

So, the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOme for succinate, but for fumarate, it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOme, with the double bond between the two middle carbons, and the ester groups on either end.

Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Let's see. Each of the middle carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to two ester groups and two CH2 groups? No, the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOme for succinate, but for fumarate, it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOme. Wait, no, fumarate is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, so the dimethyl ester would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COOme.

Each carbon in the double bond (the two CHs) is connected to two ester groups. So each of those carbons is attached to an OMe group on one side and a COOMe group on the other. Wait, no, each of the double bond carbons is connected to one ester group and one CH group.

Wait, perhaps each double bond carbon is attached to two identical groups. Let me think. For dimethyl fumarate, each double bond carbon is attached to a methyl ester group (OCH3) and a carbonyl group (COOCH3). Wait, no, the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOme for succinate, but for fumarate, it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOme.

Wait, no, that's not right. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, the structure of fumarate is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, which when esterified with methanol would become MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. So each of the double bond carbons (the CH=CH part) has an OCOOCH3 group on one side and a CH on the other. Wait, perhaps each double bond carbon has two different substituents: one from each ester group and one from the double bond.

Wait, perhaps each of the double bond carbons is connected to two different groups. Let me think: each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH group. Wait, but that would make each of those carbons have two identical substituents (COOCH3 and CH?), but wait, no. Let me count:

For each double bond carbon, the substituents are:

- One COOCH3 group (from the ester)
- One CH2 group (if any), but in fumarate, it's CH=CH. So each CH in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and another CH group (from the double bond). So each of those carbons is attached to:

- COOCH3
- CH (from the double bond)
- And two hydrogens.

Wait, no, because each carbon in the double bond has only three substituents (since it's double-bonded to the other carbon). So each of the double bond carbons in dimethyl fumarate is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group
- One CH (from the other double bond carbon)
- And two hydrogens.

So, each of those carbons has two identical substituents (the CH and two H's and COOCH3). Wait, no, each CH has:

- COOCH3
- CH2 (if part of a longer chain, but in fumarate, it's CH=CH. So each is CH connected to another CH via double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers. Since the molecule has a double bond, it can exhibit geometric isomerism, but in terms of optical isomerism (chirality), does it have any chiral centers?

Looking at the molecule, each of the double bond carbons has two COOCH3 groups? No, each has one COOCH3 and one CH connected via double bond. So, each has:

- COOCH3
- A double bond (so each is attached to one CH)
- And two H's.

Wait, each of the double bond carbons is attached to:

- COOCH3
- CH (from the other end of the double bond)
- Two H's.

So, each has substituents: COOCH3, CH, H, H. So, two H's, which are identical. So, for a carbon to be chiral, all four substituents must be different. In this case, one substituent is COOCH3, another is CH-, another is H, and another is H. So, two substituents are H's. Therefore, each of the double bond carbons has only three different substituents, so they are not chiral centers.

So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. But wait, could it have a plane of symmetry? Let's see. The structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOme for succinate, but for fumarate, it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOme. The molecule is symmetrical along the central double bond. So, it has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but dimethyl maleate (the cis isomer) actually does have a chiral center. No, wait, no. Because the substituents on each double bond carbon are the same. For example, in dimethyl maleate, each double bond carbon is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups (but I'm not sure). Alternatively, perhaps in maleate (cis), each double bond carbon is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, leading to two identical substituents, so no chiral centers.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. In dimethyl fumarate (trans), each of the double bond carbons is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group
- One CH group (from the other double bond carbon)
- Two H's.

So, substituents are COOCH3, CH, H, H. So, two H's are identical. So, this carbon does not have four different substituents, so no chiral center.

Wait, but what about the other parts of the molecule? Are there any other chiral centers? No, because the other carbons (the ones attached to the ester groups) are either CH3 (methyl) or connected to the double bond, which doesn't have any chiral centers.

So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: Could the molecule have a center of symmetry, making it achiral? Yes, because the molecule is symmetrical. So, it doesn't have any chiral centers.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (the central carbon) and can exhibit optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. I thought that dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate, but that's in terms of geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. So, for optical isomerism, the presence of a chiral center is necessary.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (central carbon with four different groups: OH, CH3, COOCH3, and H), so it can show optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate does not have any chiral centers, so it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Thus, for part B, the correct answer is that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Another possibility is that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. For example, if the molecule is symmetrical around the central carbon, it would not be chiral.

Wait, but in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, if the central carbon has four different groups, then it's a chiral center. But if the molecule is symmetrical, perhaps the groups are arranged symmetrically.

Wait, the central carbon in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is connected to:

- OH group
- COOCH3 group
- CH3 group (from carbon 1)
- And a hydrogen.

So, all four substituents are different. Therefore, it's a chiral center, and the molecule can exhibit optical isomerism.

So, part B's answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

Now, putting it all together.

Part A: The compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.

Part B: The compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option B says A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option C: A = cyclohexane, B = dimethyl fumarate. But we concluded A is benzoquinone and B is methyl.

So the correct option is B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the compounds and their properties based on the question:

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift a hydrogen atom and a lone pair of electrons between adjacent atoms, typically involving carbonyl groups. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring, which does not allow for the formation of enols due to the aromaticity and stability of the benzene ring. Thus, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are CH₂ groups, which have alpha hydrogens. These alpha hydrogens can shift to the carbonyl oxygen, allowing the formation of enols. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does exhibit tautomerism.

**Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

---

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, leading to enantiomers.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a methyl group (CH₃), a hydroxyl group (OH), and an ester group (COOCH₃). This makes it a chiral center, and the compound can exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The double bond in the trans configuration creates geometric isomerism, but neither of the double-bonded carbons has four different substituents. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

---

### Final Answer:
From the analysis, **benzoquinone** does not show tautomerism, and **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** shows optical isomerism. This corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about isomers. It mentions constitutional isomers and stereoisomers. I remember that constitutional isomers have the same molecular formula but different connectivity of atoms. Like how isomers of butane can have different structures. On the other hand, stereoisomers are when the molecules have the same connectivity but different spatial arrangements, like in enantiomers or diastereomers.

The question has two parts, A and B. Let's tackle them one by one.

Part A: Among benzoquinone and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, which one does NOT show tautomerism?

Hmm. Tautomerism is when a compound can shift a hydrogen and a lone pair between adjacent atoms, leading to the formation of different isomers. The most common example is between a keto form and an enol form. For this to happen, the compound must have a structure that allows such a shift, usually involving adjacent carbonyl groups.

Let's look at benzoquinone first. Benzoquinone (I think it's 1,4-benzoquinone) has two ketone groups on a benzene ring, opposite each other. Are there any alpha hydrogens that can shift? Well, the carbonyl groups are on the benzene, so the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring. Benzene rings are stable, and the carbons are sp² hybridized. Typically, in aromatic rings, the carbonyl groups are attached directly without any adjacent hydrogens that can shift, because the adjacent carbons are part of the ring and don't have hydrogens attached. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the structure of 1,4-benzoquinone is O=C6H4=O, so each oxygen is attached to a benzene ring. The carbons next to the carbonyl groups are part of the ring and are sp² hybridized. So, each of those is attached to other ring carbons, not hydrogens. So, I don't think benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens adjacent to carbonyl groups. Without alpha hydrogens, tautomerism isn't possible because there's nothing to shift. So benzoquinone probably doesn't show tautomerism.

Now, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. That's a six-membered ring with three ketone groups at positions 1, 3, and 5. So the structure is O=C-C-O=C-C-O=C. Let me visualize it: each of the three ketones is attached to the ring at every other carbon. So the ring has alternating single and double bonds? Or wait, no, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a fully saturated ring with three ketone groups. So the structure is a cyclohexane ring where three of the carbons (1,3,5) are double-bonded to oxygen. Wait, no, ketones are R-CO-R, so each of those carbons is a carbonyl. So the ring is cyclohexane with three ketone groups. So the structure is O=C-C-O-C-C-O-C, arranged in the ring.

Wait, but the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups—so the carbons next to the carbonyls—are they CH2 groups? Because in cyclohexane, each carbon is connected to two others. So positions 1 is a carbonyl, position 2 is connected to 1 and 3, etc. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls (like position 2, 4, 6) would each have two CH2 groups (since they're part of the ring and have two adjacent carbons). So each of those (positions 2,4,6) would have two CH2 groups. Wait, but wait: in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the structure must have each of the carbonyl groups attached to a CH2 group on each side? No, wait, maybe not. Let me think: the ring is six-membered. Positions 1,3,5 have carbonyl groups. So each O is attached to a carbon in the ring. The adjacent carbons (positions 2,6; 4,2; 6,4, etc.) would be CH2 groups. So, each carbonyl is attached to two CH2 groups. Wait, no—each carbonyl is a C=O, so each is at a position where it's connected to two other carbons in the ring. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (like position 2) would have two substituents: from the ring, they're connected to position 1 (which is a carbonyl) and position 3 (which is another carbonyl). Hmm, but that might mean that position 2 is between two carbonyls, so each position 2,4,6 is a CH2 group, perhaps.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure. But regardless, the key thing is whether the compound has alpha hydrogens—hydrogens on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. If it does, then tautomerism is possible.

In benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are on a benzene ring, so the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring, which doesn't have hydrogens (since each C in benzene has only one H if any). Wait, no, each carbon in a benzene ring is bonded to one hydrogen. But in benzoquinone, the carbonyl groups are on the benzene, which is a 6-membered ring with two ketone groups. So, for example, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C6H4=O, which would have each carbonyl group attached to a benzene carbon. So each of those carbonyl carbons is connected to two other ring carbons. The adjacent carbons (like positions 2 and 6 for the 1 position) are part of the ring and have one hydrogen each. But wait, in the case of benzoquinone, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (like position 2) are connected to a carbonyl (position 1) and another ring carbon (position 3). So the position 2 carbon is connected to a carbonyl group, a ring carbon (position 3), and has two hydrogens? Or wait, no: each carbon in the benzene ring has one hydrogen, assuming it's not substituted elsewhere. Wait, no, in 1,4-benzoquinone, the ring is fully conjugated with two ketone groups. So the structure is O=C-C6H4=O. So the ring has two oxygen substituents at 1 and 4 positions. So the adjacent carbons (like 2 and 6 for 1, and 3 and 5 for 4) have each a hydrogen because each of those positions is a CH group.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, but the main point is whether benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens. Alpha hydrogens are on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group. So if the carbonyl is on a benzene ring, the adjacent carbons (like positions 2 and 6) have hydrogens. So, does that mean they are alpha hydrogens and thus can lead to tautomerism?

Wait, wait. For tautomerism to occur, there needs to be a hydrogen on the alpha carbon (the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl) that can shift between adjacent positions. But in the case of benzoquinone, the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring, which is conjugated. But I'm not sure if the structure allows for the necessary hydrogen shift. Alternatively, maybe the two carbonyl groups are in positions that don't allow for enol formation because the adjacent positions are already occupied by other carbonyl groups.

Alternatively, maybe benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism because the enol form would require a double bond between the two adjacent carbonyls, but that would create a conjugated dienone, which might not be favorable, or perhaps it's already a quinone structure, so tautomerism isn't possible.

Wait, but wait a second. Let's think about cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione. Each of the three ketone groups is attached to a cyclohexane ring. So the carbons adjacent to each ketone (like positions 2,4,6) have two CH2 groups? Or each is adjacent to another ketone?

Wait, no, in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the carbonyl groups are at positions 1,3,5, which are every other position on the ring. So each of these carbons is connected to two other ring carbons, which are not carbonyls. For example, the carbon at position 1 is connected to positions 6 and 2. Both position 2 and 6 have CH2 groups (since they are not carbonyls). So each of the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl (positions 2,4,6) have two CH2 groups. Wait, perhaps each adjacent carbon is a CH2 group. So the carbonyl is at 1, so position 2 has two CH2 groups? No, wait, in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two others. So position 1 is connected to 6 and 2. Position 2 is connected to 1 and 3. If position 3 is a carbonyl, then position 2 is connected to 1 (carbonyl) and 3 (carbonyl). So position 2 would have two carbonyl adjacent carbons, which would make it a CH2 group. So each of the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups (positions 2,4,6) would be CH2 groups.

So, for each of the three carbonyl groups in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the adjacent carbons have two CH2 groups. So each of those carbons (positions 2,4,6) have two CH2 groups. So each of these adjacent carbons has two hydrogens. Thus, the molecule has alpha hydrogens on each carbonyl's adjacent carbon. So, can it undergo tautomerism?

Tautomerism typically involves the movement of a hydrogen from an alpha carbon to a carbonyl oxygen, leading to the formation of an enol (if moving from a ketone). So, in this case, could a hydrogen from position 2 shift to the carbonyl at position 1, forming an enol? But wait, if the same ring has a carbonyl at position 3, which is adjacent to position 2, would that affect the possibility? Hmm.

Wait, but each of the alpha carbons (positions 2,4,6) has two CH2 groups. So each alpha carbon (like position 2) is connected to two carbonyls (positions 1 and 3). So if a hydrogen from position 2 moves to position 1's carbonyl, that would form a double bond between 1 and 2, making an enol. But wait, position 2 is adjacent to two carbonyls, so shifting a hydrogen from position 2 would create a double bond between 1 and 2 (making an enol), but position 2 is also next to position 3, which is another carbonyl. So would that lead to a conjugated system? Like, the enol would form a double bond between 1 and 2, and position 2 would be adjacent to another carbonyl (position 3).

Wait, but if the cyclohexane ring is fully saturated, the enol would cause the ring to have a double bond. Hmm, maybe that's possible. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule can't undergo tautomerism because the enol form is not more stable. Or maybe the presence of three ketone groups and adjacent CH2 groups allows for tautomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of specific examples. For example, cyclohexanone has alpha hydrogens and can undergo tautomerism (enol formation). But in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, each alpha carbon is adjacent to two carbonyl groups. So if a hydrogen from position 2 moves to position 1, the structure would have a double bond between 1 and 2, and position 2 would be a double bond to 3 (since position 3 is a carbonyl). Wait, that would mean position 2 is double bonded to both 1 and 3, which is impossible. So maybe in this case, the molecule can't undergo tautomerism because the shift would create an impossible structure.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. The initial structure is a cyclohexane ring with three ketone groups at 1,3,5. The alpha carbons (positions 2,4,6) each have two CH2 groups. So each of those carbons has two hydrogens. If a hydrogen from position 2 shifts to position 1's carbonyl, that would form a double bond between 1 and 2, turning the carbonyl at 1 into a C-O with a double bond to 2. But then, position 3 is a carbonyl, and position 2 is now double bonded to position 1. So the structure would have a double bond between 1 and 2, and position 3 is a carbonyl, so position 2 is adjacent to a carbonyl on both sides. That seems possible.

Wait, but in that case, the enol form would have a double bond between 1 and 2 and another between 2 and 3? But that would require position 2 to have two double bonds, which isn't possible. So perhaps the molecule can't undergo tautomerism because the structure doesn't allow for a stable enol form.

Alternatively, maybe each shift only affects one position. Like, the hydrogen from position 2 moves to position 1, creating a double bond between 1 and 2. But then, position 3 is a carbonyl, so the structure would have a double bond between 1 and 2, and position 3 is also a carbonyl. So the ring would have two double bonds: 1-2 and 3-4 (if any, but wait, in this case, the shift only affects 1 and 2. So the ring would have a double bond between 1 and 2, but the rest are single bonds. That would make the ring non-aromatic, but it's cyclohexane, which is a six-membered ring with single bonds. So perhaps the enol form is possible, but it's not as stable, but still, the molecule could exhibit tautomerism.

Hmm, now I'm really confused. Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone can't undergo tautomerism, while cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione can. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm trying to compare the two compounds. Benzoquinone: two ketone groups on a benzene ring. Each has adjacent carbon atoms that have hydrogens. So, can they form enols? Well, in the case of 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. So each carbonyl is attached to a benzene ring. The adjacent carbons (like positions 2 and 6) each have a hydrogen. So, if a hydrogen from position 2 shifts to the carbonyl at position 1, would that form an enol?

But wait, the benzene ring is aromatic, and the movement would disrupt the conjugation. So the enol form would have a double bond between 1 and 2, making the ring non-aromatic. But that's not favorable, so perhaps benzoquinone doesn't undergo tautomerism.

On the other hand, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a six-membered ring with three ketone groups. Each alpha carbon (like position 2) has two hydrogens. So, the molecule can undergo tautomerism because the enol form is possible without disrupting the ring's conjugation, as it's not a benzene ring.

Wait, but in cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione, the ring isn't aromatic, it's fully saturated (cyclohexane). So the enol form would not affect the aromaticity because it isn't aromatic. So the tautomerism would be possible.

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. The presence of alpha hydrogens is the key here. So, if a compound has alpha hydrogens adjacent to carbonyl groups, it can undergo tautomerism.

Benzoquinone: Each carbonyl group is attached to a benzene ring, and the adjacent carbons have hydrogens. So benzoquinone has alpha hydrogens and should, in theory, undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I thought that in aromatic systems, the conjugation isn't broken, but perhaps the enol form isn't possible because the movement would require a hydrogen to shift to a carbonyl, but the adjacent positions are part of the ring.

Alternatively, perhaps benzoquinone doesn't have alpha hydrogens. Wait, no, the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl in benzene are part of the ring and each have one hydrogen. So those are alpha hydrogens.

Wait, but in 1,4-benzoquinone, the structure is O=C-C6H4-C=O. So the carbons adjacent to the carbonyls are CH groups (each has one hydrogen). So, yes, those are alpha hydrogens. So, they can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, but if they can, then both compounds would show tautomerism, but that's not the case, as the question suggests that one doesn't. So perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, maybe in benzoquinone, the adjacent carbons are part of the aromatic ring, and the hydrogen is on a carbon that's part of the ring. So, when the hydrogen shifts, it would form an enol, but that would mean the ring becomes non-aromatic, which is not favorable. Hence, benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism.

In contrast, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione is a saturated ring, so shifting a hydrogen from position 2 to position 1's carbonyl would form a double bond between 1 and 2, making a cyclohexene ring. But that's possible, so the molecule can undergo tautomerism.

Wait, so that would mean that benzoquinone doesn't show tautomerism (so A is benzoquinone) and cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does. Or am I getting it backwards?

Wait, the question asks which compound does NOT show tautomerism. So if benzoquinone doesn't, then A is benzoquinone.

So for part A, the answer is A = benzoquinone.

Now, part B: Among methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate and dimethyl fumarate, which shows optical isomerism.

Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, leading to enantiomers. Alternatively, it can occur due to other forms of asymmetry, like in allenes or certain ring structures.

Let me look at each compound.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COOCH3. Wait, no, wait. The formula for 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. When it's the methyl ester, it's CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, no, perhaps it's better to write the structure correctly.

Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So, structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. When esterified with methanol, the -OH is replaced by -OCH3. So the structure becomes CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3? Or wait, wait, no. Let me think: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but wait, no. The correct structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think in terms of the carbon chain. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, but wait, no: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the three carbons are in a straight chain. So 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be formed between the hydroxyl group and methanol, so it would be CH2(OCH3)CH2COOH? No, wait, esterification occurs between the carboxylic acid and an alcohol. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester where the carboxylic acid (COOH) is esterified with methanol, and the hydroxyl is on the adjacent carbon.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. It's O

The structure is:

O
|
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C-OH
|
CH3

Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to write it as CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but in any case, the molecule would have a hydroxyl group on the second carbon and an ester group on the third. So, the molecule is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's count the substituents on each carbon.

The central carbon (second carbon) has:

- One hydroxyl group (-OH)
- One CH2 group (attached to the first carbon)
- One CH2COOCH3 group (attached to the third carbon)
- And the fourth substituent: wait, wait, no. Wait, the second carbon is attached to the first (CH2-), the third (CH2COOCH3), an OH, and another CH2? No, wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, the structure is:

The molecule is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, the second carbon is connected to:

- The first carbon (CH2-)
- The third carbon (CH2COOCH3)
- An OH group
- And what's the fourth substituent? Oh wait, the second carbon is CH, so it has four substituents: two CH2 groups, an OH, and a hydrogen. Wait, no, wait. Let's number the carbons.

Carbon 1: CH3
Carbon 2: CH(OH)
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me arrange it properly.

Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: The structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. So carbon 1: CH3, carbon 2: CH(OH), carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So, methyl ester would be CH2CH2COOCH3. 2-hydroxy would mean a hydroxyl on the second carbon.

So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, looking at the second carbon (the one with the OH), what are its substituents? It's attached to:

1. The first carbon: CH2- (maybe a methyl group if it's the end, but no, in this case, the first carbon is CH2(OH) connected to another CH2.)

Wait, perhaps I should draw the structure.

The molecule is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. No, that can't be right because that would only be three carbons (propanoate has three carbons including the COO- group). Wait, no, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-.

So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Now, the second carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to:

- Two CH2 groups (one leading to the methyl group, and one leading to the COOCH3 group)
- An OH group
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, no, wait. The structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
Carbon 2: CH2
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, no, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So, the molecule is:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
Carbon 2: CH2 connected to carbon 1 and carbon 3.
Carbon 3: COOCH3.

Wait, but Carbon 2 would be a CH2, which has two CH2 groups attached, but that can't be right because each carbon can only have four bonds.

Wait, I'm getting stuck on the structure. Let me think differently. The formula for methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is C4H8O3.

But perhaps it's better to think about the presence of a chiral center. For a carbon to be chiral, it must have four different substituents.

In the structure, the second carbon (from the left) has:

- A hydroxyl group (-OH)
- A CH3 group (if the first carbon is CH3)
Wait, no, perhaps in the structure, the second carbon is attached to:

- A CH2 group (from carbon 1)
- A COOCH3 group (from carbon 3)
- An OH group
- And a hydrogen.

Wait, let's see:

If the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3, then the central carbon (CH(OH)) has:

- CH3 group (from the left)
- COOCH3 group (from the right)
- OH group
- And a hydrogen.

So, all four substituents are different: CH3, COOCH3, OH, and H. Thus, the central carbon is a chiral center. So the molecule has a chiral center and can exhibit optical isomerism.

Now, the other compound is dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the di-ester of maleic acid. The structure of fumarate is (Z)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would be the diester, with two methyl ester groups on each end of the double bond.

The structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So its structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
|
O

Wait, no. The correct structure of fumarate is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait, no, that's for succinic acid. Fumarate is HO2CCH=CHCO2H. So dimethyl fumarate would be MeO2CCH=CHCO2Me. So the structure is MeO-C-O=C-CH=CH-CO-O-Me.

Wait, no, more accurately, it's CH2=C(COOCH3)CH2(COOCH3)? No, wait, no. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleate. So the structure is O

So dimethyl fumarate is CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3? No, wait, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
    C=C
   /
O-C-OCH3
|
O

Wait, no, perhaps it's:

The structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)COOCH3? No, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, it's MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOme, but that's succinate. Fumarate has a double bond.

So dimethyl fumarate is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOME? No, that's succinate. Fumarate has a double bond, so it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOme.

Ah, right. So dimethyl fumarate is (Z)- or (E)-dimethyl fumarate. Wait, no, fumarate is the trans (E) isomer of maleic acid, so the double bond is trans.

So, the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOme for succinate, but for fumarate, it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOme, with the double bond between the two middle carbons, and the ester groups on either end.

Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Let's see. Each of the middle carbons (the ones in the double bond) is connected to two ester groups and two CH2 groups? No, the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOme for succinate, but for fumarate, it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOme. Wait, no, fumarate is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, so the dimethyl ester would be MeOOC-CH=CH-COOme.

Each carbon in the double bond (the two CHs) is connected to two ester groups. So each of those carbons is attached to an OMe group on one side and a COOMe group on the other. Wait, no, each of the double bond carbons is connected to one ester group and one CH group.

Wait, perhaps each double bond carbon is attached to two identical groups. Let me think. For dimethyl fumarate, each double bond carbon is attached to a methyl ester group (OCH3) and a carbonyl group (COOCH3). Wait, no, the structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOme for succinate, but for fumarate, it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOme.

Wait, no, that's not right. Fumarate is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So, the structure of fumarate is HO2C-CH=CH-COOH, which when esterified with methanol would become MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me. So each of the double bond carbons (the CH=CH part) has an OCOOCH3 group on one side and a CH on the other. Wait, perhaps each double bond carbon has two different substituents: one from each ester group and one from the double bond.

Wait, perhaps each of the double bond carbons is connected to two different groups. Let me think: each CH in the double bond is connected to a COOCH3 group and a CH group. Wait, but that would make each of those carbons have two identical substituents (COOCH3 and CH?), but wait, no. Let me count:

For each double bond carbon, the substituents are:

- One COOCH3 group (from the ester)
- One CH2 group (if any), but in fumarate, it's CH=CH. So each CH in the double bond is attached to a COOCH3 group and another CH group (from the double bond). So each of those carbons is attached to:

- COOCH3
- CH (from the double bond)
- And two hydrogens.

Wait, no, because each carbon in the double bond has only three substituents (since it's double-bonded to the other carbon). So each of the double bond carbons in dimethyl fumarate is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group
- One CH (from the other double bond carbon)
- And two hydrogens.

So, each of those carbons has two identical substituents (the CH and two H's and COOCH3). Wait, no, each CH has:

- COOCH3
- CH2 (if part of a longer chain, but in fumarate, it's CH=CH. So each is CH connected to another CH via double bond.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is whether dimethyl fumarate has any chiral centers. Since the molecule has a double bond, it can exhibit geometric isomerism, but in terms of optical isomerism (chirality), does it have any chiral centers?

Looking at the molecule, each of the double bond carbons has two COOCH3 groups? No, each has one COOCH3 and one CH connected via double bond. So, each has:

- COOCH3
- A double bond (so each is attached to one CH)
- And two H's.

Wait, each of the double bond carbons is attached to:

- COOCH3
- CH (from the other end of the double bond)
- Two H's.

So, each has substituents: COOCH3, CH, H, H. So, two H's, which are identical. So, for a carbon to be chiral, all four substituents must be different. In this case, one substituent is COOCH3, another is CH-, another is H, and another is H. So, two substituents are H's. Therefore, each of the double bond carbons has only three different substituents, so they are not chiral centers.

So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers. But wait, could it have a plane of symmetry? Let's see. The structure is MeOOC-CH2-CH2-COOme for succinate, but for fumarate, it's MeOOC-CH=CH-COOme. The molecule is symmetrical along the central double bond. So, it has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, but dimethyl maleate (the cis isomer) actually does have a chiral center. No, wait, no. Because the substituents on each double bond carbon are the same. For example, in dimethyl maleate, each double bond carbon is attached to two COOCH3 groups and two CH2 groups (but I'm not sure). Alternatively, perhaps in maleate (cis), each double bond carbon is attached to a COOCH3 and a CH2 group, leading to two identical substituents, so no chiral centers.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. In dimethyl fumarate (trans), each of the double bond carbons is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group
- One CH group (from the other double bond carbon)
- Two H's.

So, substituents are COOCH3, CH, H, H. So, two H's are identical. So, this carbon does not have four different substituents, so no chiral center.

Wait, but what about the other parts of the molecule? Are there any other chiral centers? No, because the other carbons (the ones attached to the ester groups) are either CH3 (methyl) or connected to the double bond, which doesn't have any chiral centers.

So, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: Could the molecule have a center of symmetry, making it achiral? Yes, because the molecule is symmetrical. So, it doesn't have any chiral centers.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (the central carbon) and can exhibit optical isomerism, while dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. I thought that dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate, but that's in terms of geometric isomerism, not optical isomerism. So, for optical isomerism, the presence of a chiral center is necessary.

So, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate has a chiral center (central carbon with four different groups: OH, CH3, COOCH3, and H), so it can show optical isomerism.

Dimethyl fumarate does not have any chiral centers, so it doesn't show optical isomerism.

Thus, for part B, the correct answer is that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Another possibility is that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. For example, if the molecule is symmetrical around the central carbon, it would not be chiral.

Wait, but in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, if the central carbon has four different groups, then it's a chiral center. But if the molecule is symmetrical, perhaps the groups are arranged symmetrically.

Wait, the central carbon in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is connected to:

- OH group
- COOCH3 group
- CH3 group (from carbon 1)
- And a hydrogen.

So, all four substituents are different. Therefore, it's a chiral center, and the molecule can exhibit optical isomerism.

So, part B's answer is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate shows optical isomerism.

Now, putting it all together.

Part A: The compound that does not show tautomerism is benzoquinone.

Part B: The compound that shows optical isomerism is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Looking at the options:

Option B says A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Option C: A = cyclohexane, B = dimethyl fumarate. But we concluded A is benzoquinone and B is methyl.

So the correct option is B: A = benzoquinone, B = methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.


To determine the correct answer, we analyze the compounds and their properties based on the question:

### Part A: Which compound does not show tautomerism?
Tautomerism occurs when a compound can shift a hydrogen atom and a lone pair of electrons between adjacent atoms, typically involving carbonyl groups. 

1. **Benzoquinone**: This compound has two ketone groups on a benzene ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are part of the aromatic ring, which does not allow for the formation of enols due to the aromaticity and stability of the benzene ring. Thus, benzoquinone does not exhibit tautomerism.

2. **Cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione**: This compound has three ketone groups on a cyclohexane ring. The carbons adjacent to the carbonyl groups are CH₂ groups, which have alpha hydrogens. These alpha hydrogens can shift to the carbonyl oxygen, allowing the formation of enols. Therefore, cyclohexane-1,3,5-trione does exhibit tautomerism.

**Conclusion for Part A**: The compound that does not show tautomerism is **benzoquinone**.

### Part B: Which compound shows optical isomerism?
Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has a chiral center, leading to enantiomers.

1. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**: The structure of this compound is CH₃-CH(OH)-COOCH₃. The second carbon (the one with the hydroxyl group) is bonded to four different groups: a hydrogen atom, a methyl group (CH₃), a hydroxyl group (OH), and an ester group (COOCH₃). This makes it a chiral center, and the compound can exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Dimethyl fumarate**: The structure of dimethyl fumarate is CH₃OOC-CH=CH-COOCH₃. The double bond in the trans configuration creates geometric isomerism, but neither of the double-bonded carbons has four different substituents. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate does not exhibit optical isomerism.

**Conclusion for Part B**: The compound that shows optical isomerism is **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**.

### Final Answer:
From the analysis, **benzoquinone** does not show tautomerism, and **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate** shows optical isomerism. This corresponds to **Option B**.

**Answer: B**
