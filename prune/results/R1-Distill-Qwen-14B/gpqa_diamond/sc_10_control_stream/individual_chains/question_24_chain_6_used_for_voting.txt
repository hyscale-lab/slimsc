Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down.

The problem starts by talking about an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, I remember that decolorizing bromine water is a test for unsaturation, like alkenes or alkynes. So mixture X must have compounds with double bonds or triple bonds because those can react with bromine.

Next, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. The reaction is called a disproportionation, which means that a single substance is both oxidized and reduced. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the mixture X is two liquids, and after the reaction, it becomes two other liquids Y. Oh wait, no, the problem says the result is a disproportionation, which means each component in X might be undergoing a disproportionation or perhaps one of them does. Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids, so maybe one of them is undergoing a disproportionation reaction. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the products of this reaction Y don't decolorize bromine water. So whatever Y is, it doesn't have any double or triple bonds anymore. So if the mixture X has compounds that can add bromine (like alkenes or alkynes), after the reaction, those have been hydrogenated or something else, perhaps adding hydrogen.

Then, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, they give only one substance Z. So Z is a hydrocarbon, and it's present in Y as one of the components. Also, Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. 

Wait, 14.28% hydrogen. Let me calculate that. So the molecular formula of Z can be found. Let's suppose Z has a molecular formula CnHm. The mass fraction of H is (m/(12n + m)) * 100 = 14.28. Let me compute this:

14.28% is approximately 1/7, so m/(12n + m) ≈ 1/7. Let me rearrange:

7m = 12n + m → 6m = 12n → m = 2n.

So each molecule has twice as many H as C. So the formula is CnH2n. That's the formula for an alkene, but wait, Z is a hydrocarbon that doesn't react further with hydrogen. So if it's CnH2n, and it doesn't react with H2, that suggests it's a single bond structure. Wait, alkenes would react with H2. Oh wait, maybe it's something else. Wait, maybe it's a cyclic structure, like cyclopropane or something that can't hydrogenate further because all double bonds are consumed. Hmm, but wait, another possibility is that Z is a fully saturated compound, but that's not possible if it's CnH2n because that's the formula for an alkene. Unless it's a ring, which doesn't have double bonds anymore. Wait, maybe Z is a cycloalkane.

Alternatively, maybe Z is a di-substituted alkene that's already fully hydrogenated? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps Z is an aromatic compound, but that would have a higher H percentage. Wait, benzene is C6H6, which has a H percentage of (6/(78)) *100 ≈ 7.69%. Wait, but our Z has 14.28%, which is higher. So that's not benzene.

Wait, let's think again. CnH2n. Let's see possible n values. For n=1: CH2. Not possible. n=2: C2H4. That's ethylene. But ethylene would react with H2 under hydrogenation. So if Z doesn't react further, it can't be ethylene. Hmm, so maybe it's a cyclic compound, like cyclopropane (C3H6) or cyclobutane (C4H8). Let me check the H percentage for these.

Cyclopropane: C3H6. Molar mass is 3*12 +6=42. H mass is 6. (6/42)= 0.1428 → 14.28%. Yes! That's exactly the percentage given. So Z is cyclopropane, which is C3H6. Wait, but cyclopropane has a ring and no double bonds, so it won't react with H2 further. Because cyclopropane is a strained alkane. So that fits.

So Z is cyclopropane, C3H6. So when X and Y are hydrogenated, they both produce only cyclopropane. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only one substance Z. So both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So that suggests that X and Y are either the same as Z or can be converted into Z upon hydrogenation. Hmm.

Wait, X is a mixture of two liquids that can decolorize bromine, which suggests they have double or triple bonds. When X is treated with Pt and heat, it undergoes a disproportionation to form Y, which doesn't react with bromine. So Y must consist of fully saturated compounds, perhaps alkanes.

Hydrogenation refers to the addition of H2. So perhaps the components of X are unsaturated, and upon hydrogenation, they become alkanes. But in the problem, when X and Y are hydrogenated, both give only Z. So perhaps both X and Y, when hydrogenated, form cyclopropane. That implies that the starting materials in X and Y have structures that upon hydrogenation form cyclopropane.

Wait, let me think again. X is a mixture of two liquids; upon treatment with platinum and heat, it becomes Y. This reaction is a disproportionation. So one of the components of X is undergoing a disproportionation when heated with Pt. But wait, what kind of reaction is that? Maybe the breakdown of an alkene into two different products. Or maybe an alkyne?

Wait, Pt is a catalyst for hydrogenation, but in this context, when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation. Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or something else. Alternatively, perhaps X contains an alkyne, which upon heating with Pt, undergoes a reaction. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe X contains a compound that can undergo a hydrogenation but in a way that results in different products. Wait, but the problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, the result is Y, which is a mixture of two other liquids. So perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, and upon reaction, they form two alkanes, but that's not a disproportionation. Wait, but the problem says it's a disproportionation reaction. So a single compound in X is disproportionated into two different products. So X is a mixture, but one of the components is undergoing a disproportionation into two products, making Y a mixture of three components? No, the question says Y is a mixture of two liquids, so X must have two components, and each undergoes some reaction. Or perhaps one of the components is undergoing a disproportionation, breaking into two, while the other component remains as is. But the problem states Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids, possibly formed from X's components.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the hydrogenation of an alkyne. Let's say X contains an alkyne. When hydrogenated in the presence of a catalyst, an alkyne can add two H2 molecules to become an alkane (if fully hydrogenated) or an alkene (if partially). But wait, the problem says it's a disproportionation. So perhaps one of the components in X is an alkyne, which upon reaction with Pt and heat, disproportionates into an alkene and an alkyne? No, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps into two alkenes? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the hydrogenation of X and Y. Both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z, which is cyclopropane. So what would need to be hydrogenated to form cyclopropane?

Wait, cyclopropane could be formed by the hydrogenation of a strained alkyne or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials in X and Y are alkenes and alkynes that hydrogenate to form cyclopropane.

Wait, but cyclopropane is a saturated molecule. So if X and Y are alkenes or alkynes, their hydrogenation would add hydrogen to form alkanes. Wait, but if Z is C3H6, which is cyclopropane, then perhaps X and Y are alkenes or something else that upon hydrogenation forms cyclopropane.

Hmm, maybe X and Y are dienes, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps X and Y have rings that upon hydrogenation open up to form cyclopropane. Wait, that seems a stretch.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, and Y is a mixture of their hydrogenation products. But then X's hydrogenation would give alkanes, but Z is a cyclopropane. Hmm, not fitting.

Wait, another angle. Since Z is a constituent of Y, and Y doesn't decolorize bromine, Y must consist of alkanes. So Y is a mixture of alkanes, and Z is one of them. But upon hydrogenation, both X and Y give Z. So perhaps X consists of alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form alkanes, but Z is a particular product.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to summarize the information:

1. X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water (so they have double or triple bonds).

2. X upon treatment with Pt and heat undergoes disproportionation to form Y, a mixture of two other liquids which don't decolorize bromine (so alkanes).

3. Hydrogenating X and Y with Pt under severe conditions gives only Z, which is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% H. As we found, Z is cyclopropane, C3H6.

So, when X is hydrogenated, all components must turn into cyclopropane. Similarly, when Y is hydrogenated, all components turn into cyclopropane. Wait, but Y is a mixture of alkanes. If Y's components are alkanes, then hydrogenation (adding H2) would not change them because alkanes are already saturated. So that can't be. Therefore, perhaps the hydrogenation is under more severe conditions, and maybe it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait, perhaps X and Y are alkenes and alkynes. Let's think about the hydrogenation process. If X is a mixture of an alkene and an alkyne, then hydrogenation would add H2 across the double and triple bonds. But if the hydrogenation of X gives only cyclopropane, that suggests that the starting materials must be such that adding H2 would form cyclopropane.

Wait, that seems tricky. Alternatively, perhaps X contains a compound that upon hydrogenation forms cyclopropane. How?

Wait, cyclopropane could be formed from a three-membered ring, but how? Maybe from a di-substituted alkene? No, hydrogenation of an alkene would saturate it, not form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene, and under hydrogenation, it forms a ring. For example, 1,3-butadiene hydrogenated could form cyclobutane, but that's not cyclopropane. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an alkyne. Let's think: an alkyne has a triple bond. When hydrogenated, it can become an alkene (if partially hydrogenated) or an alkane (if fully). But how would that lead to cyclopropane? Not sure.

Wait, maybe Z is the result of hydrogenation of X's components. So if X contains, say, an alkene and an alkyne, then hydrogenation would produce alkanes and an alkene. But that would require multiple products, but the problem states that both X and Y's hydrogenation gives only Z. So that suggests that all components in X and Y, when hydrogenated, give only Z.

Wait, perhaps X contains a compound that, when hydrogenated, releases H2 and forms Z. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which, when hydrogenated, gives Z. So each alkene in X is such that adding H2 gives cyclopropane. Wait, but alkenes hydrogenate to alkanes. So, for example, cyclopropane has the formula C3H6. So if I have an alkene with the formula C3H4, adding two H's would make it C3H6. So, for example, propene (C3H6 when hydrogenated becomes propane, but that's not cyclopropane. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the components of X are such that when hydrogenated, they form cyclopropane. So let's think about the possible structures. If X is a mixture of 1,2-dienes or something, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the key is that X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which, when hydrogenated, gives the same alkane, which is cyclopropane. But that's not possible because alkenes hydrogenate to alkanes, not cyclopropane.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains a cyclopropane derivative with unsaturated bonds that can hydrogenate. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two different dienes or something else that upon hydrogenation forms cyclopropane. But I'm not making progress here.

Let me think about the information again. Mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so it's alkanes. When Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z, which is cyclopropane. But how? Because alkanes don't react with H2 under normal conditions. So maybe the hydrogenation of Y isn't adding H2 but doing something else. Alternatively, perhaps Y contains some other functional group that upon hydrogenation gives cyclopropane. Wait, maybe Y has a ring structure that upon hydrogenation (like ring-opening) forms cyclopropane. Not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the overall problem. We're supposed to find the number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Since X is equimolar, it has two components, each with their own structure.

We know that when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z as the only product, which is cyclopropane. So each of X's components, when hydrogenated, must form cyclopropane.

So, for each component in X, hydrogenation would add H2 to form Z.

Wait, but cyclopropane is C3H6, so the starting material must be C3H4 (since adding H2 would give C3H6). So each component in X is C3H4, an alkyne or an alkene.

But wait, what is C3H4? It can be propyne (HC≡CCH2), or propene (CH2=CHCH3), or possibly allene (CH2=C=CH2). But all of these would decolorize bromine water.

So, if X is a mixture of two C3H4 compounds, each would hydrogenate to cyclopropane? But no, because propene would hydrogenate to propane, propyne would hydrogenate to propane as well. Hmm, but that would give propane, not cyclopropane.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe X's components are not C3H4. Let's calculate the H percentage. Wait, Z is 14.28% H, which we determined is cyclopropane, C3H6.

So, when X is hydrogenated, the products are only Z. So X must be a mixture of two unsaturated compounds that, upon hydrogenation, produce cyclopropane.

Wait, but cyclopropane is a saturated compound. So how can hydrogenation of an unsaturated compound lead to cyclopropane?

Wait, hydrogenation is adding H2 across double or triple bonds. So if X's components have double bonds that, when hydrogenated, form cyclopropane.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclopropane derivatives with double bonds. For example, if you have an allyl group attached to cyclopropane. But that's getting too speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are such that when they add H2, they form cyclopropane.

Wait, maybe X contains two different dienes or something else, but I'm not making progress.

Perhaps I should think about the reaction that X undergoes to form Y. It's a disproportionation, which suggests that a single species is both oxidized and reduced. So perhaps a compound in X is undergoing a reaction where one part is reduced and another part is oxidized.

Wait, for example, in the case of H2O2 decomposing into H2O and O2, that's a disproportionation. But in this case, it's a hydrocarbon undergoing such a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps a compound with multiple bonds is breaking into smaller fragments. For example, if a molecule with a triple bond and a double bond undergoes a reaction where the triple bond becomes a double bond and a single bond, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the breakdown of an alkyne into an alkene and an alkyne, but that doesn't seem like a disproportionation.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of an alkyne and an alkene, and upon reaction with Pt and heat, the alkyne is partially hydrogenated. But then Y would be a mixture of an alkene and an alkane, perhaps. Hmm.

Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so it must be alkanes. So if X contained an alkyne and an alkene, upon hydrogenation, the alkyne would become an alkene (if partial) or an alkane (if full). But the problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heat, it forms Y, which is a mixture of two liquids that don't react with bromine. So Y must be alkanes.

Wait, but then the transformation from X to Y would involve adding H2 across triple and double bonds. But if X is a mixture of an alkyne and an alkene, then Y would be a mixture of an alkene and an alkane, but alkenes would still decolorize bromine. So that can't be, because Y doesn't decolorize bromine. Therefore, perhaps X's components are such that when hydrogenated, they become alkanes.

Wait, but if X is a mixture of an alkyne and an alkene, then upon full hydrogenation (adding H2 to triple and double bonds), they would become alkanes, which would form Y. But in the problem, treating X with Pt and heat gives Y, which doesn't react with bromine, so that makes sense.

Wait, but then why is the reaction called a disproportionation? Because a single component in X is undergoing a disproportionation reaction. So perhaps one of the components of X is undergoing a disproportionation, not just hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps the component in X is an alkyne that upon reaction with Pt and heat, undergoes a reaction to produce two different products, one of which is an alkene and another an alkyne, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X contains a compound with a triple bond and a double bond, which upon reaction, breaks into two different products. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrogenolysis of a triple bond to form two alkenes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the components of X are such that one is an alkyne and the other is an alkene, and upon hydrogenation, they become alkanes, which make Y.

Wait, but then the problem says X is treated with Pt and heat, which leads to Y. So that's hydrogenation conditions. So X's components are hydrogenated to form Y. But when Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z.

Wait, but Y is an alkane, so hydrogenation wouldn't do anything. So that can't be right because the problem says that Y's hydrogenation gives Z. So maybe Y isn't an alkane. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the hydrogenation part again. Since hydrogenating Y gives Z, which is cyclopropane, but Y doesn't contain any double bonds, so maybe Y has a ring that upon hydrogenation opens to form cyclopropane. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe Y contains a cyclopropane derivative with a functional group that upon hydrogenation forms cyclopropane. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that Z is a byproduct of the hydrogenation process. Wait, but the problem says that both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give only Z. So both X and Y's components, when hydrogenated, form Z. So perhaps X and Y are such that their hydrogenation leads to the same product.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which, when hydrogenated, gives the same alkane, which is cyclopropane. But that would require that each alkene is such that adding H2 forms cyclopropane. For example, if the alkene is part of a ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the molecular formula. Z is C3H6. So if X's components, when hydrogenated, form C3H6, their formulas must be C3H4. Because adding two H's (from H2) would take C3H4 to C3H6.

So, the components of X must have the formula C3H4. So each component is either propyne (HC≡C-CH3) or propene (CH2=CH2CH3), or allene (CH2=C=CH2).

But wait, each would be a different compound, so X is a mixture of two such compounds.

So, the two components of X would each be C3H4.

Now, the question is, how many H atoms are in each of these two components? Each has 4 H. So if X is an equimolar mixture of two such components, each molecule has 4 H. So for two moles, each with 4 H, the total H would be 2 * 4 * n, where n is the number of moles, but since it's equimolar, each component contributes the same number of H.

Wait, but the question is about the total number of H atoms in two liquids of mixture X. So, if mixture X is two equimolar components, each with formula C3H4, then each molecule has 4 H. So two components, each with 4 H. So the total H in two molecules would be 4 +4 =8. But wait, but the options don't have 8 as a choice. The options are 16, 18, 22, 12.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the question says, "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X." So each component is a liquid (so two components), and each has a certain number of H atoms. So, if each component is C3H4, each has 4 H. So two components, each has 4 H. So total H per molecule in X is 4 (from component A) + 4 (from component B), giving 8 H atoms per pair of molecules? No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the mixture X is two different C3H4 compounds, each with 4 H. But the question is about the total number of H atoms in the two liquids of X. So the two liquids are each a different compound in X. So each has a certain number of H atoms, and the question is the sum of H atoms in both.

Wait, no, the question is phrased as "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X." So perhaps each liquid is a separate component, and each has a certain number of H atoms. So if each component is C3H4, each has 4 H. So two components, each with 4 H, so total 8 H. But the options don't include 8. So maybe I'm wrong about the formulas.

Alternatively, perhaps the components of X are C4H6 or something else. Let me recalculate.

Wait, if Z is C3H6, and X's hydrogenation gives Z, perhaps X's components are C3H4. So, for each molecule in X, adding two H's (from H2) would make it C3H6. So each X component is C3H4. So, each has 4 H. So two components, so two molecules in X would have 4 +4 =8 H? No, but the options don't have 8.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in determining Z's formula. Let me recheck. The mass fraction of H is 14.28%, which is 1/7. So (m/(12n +m)) = 1/7 → 7m=12n +m → 6m=12n → m=2n. So the formula is CnH2n.

So, possible n and m:

n=1 → C H2 → not possible.
n=2 → C2H4 → ethylene. But ethylene would react with H2, which contradicts Z being unreactive.
n=3 → C3H6 → cyclopropane, which is correct because it's a saturated ring and wouldn't react further with H2.

So Z is C3H6, which is correct.

So X's components are C3H4. So each has 4 H. So each component in X is C3H4.

So, each molecule of X's component has 4 H.

Since X is a mixture of two equimolar components, each of which has 4 H, then each component contributes 4 H.

So, for two components, the total H atoms per molecule (for two molecules) would be 4 + 4 =8. But the options don't have 8. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe X's components are each C4H6, which would have 6 H each. So two components would give 6 +6=12 H. That would match option D) 12.

But why would X's components be C4H6?

Wait, because when hydrogenated, C4H6 would become C4H8. But Z is C3H6, so that can't be. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that X's components are not C3H4 but something else. Let me think about the hydrogenation again.

If X's hydrogenation produces Z (C3H6), which is cyclopropane, then perhaps the components in X are alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclopropane. But alkenes hydrogenate to alkanes, which would be larger than C3H6.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think about the number of H atoms in X's two components. The question is asking for the total number of H atoms in two liquids of mixture X. So if each component has a certain number of H, what's the sum.

Wait, perhaps the two components of X each have 12 H atoms. So the total would be 24, but that's not an option. Alternatively, each has 6 H, so total 12. That's option D) 12.

But why would the components have 6 H each? Let's see. For example, if each component is C3H6, but that can't be because X's components have double bonds and would decolorize bromine. Wait, but X's components are C3H4, which is less H than C3H6, so that's more unsaturated.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the components of X are CH2 groups or something. Alternatively, I'm getting stuck, so maybe I should look at the options.

The options given are A)16, B)18, C)22, D)12.

We thought that each component of X has 4 H, so two components would have 8 H. But that's not an option. So perhaps each component has 6 H. Then two would sum to 12, which is option D.

So perhaps the components of X are C4H6. Each has 6 H, two components sum to 12 H.

But how? Let me think about C4H6. It could be 1-butene (but that's C4H8, which is more H). Wait, no, 1,3-butadiene is C4H6, which is a diene. So, if X is a mixture of two C4H6 compounds, each with 6 H, then two would have 12 H in total. That would make option D correct.

But earlier I thought that the X components are C3H4, but perhaps I was wrong.

Wait, let me consider if each component is C4H6. Upon hydrogenation, adding 2 H (from H2) would give C4H8. But Z is C3H6, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe the components of X are C3H4 and C4H6. So their hydrogenation products would be C3H6 and C4H8. But the problem states that both X and Y hydrogenate to give only Z, which is C3H6. So this can't be.

Wait, maybe the components of X are such that when hydrogenated, they form cyclopropane. So their formulas must be C3H4. So each has 4 H. So two components would give 8 H, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of H atoms in each component, not the sum. But no, the question says "total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X." So perhaps each liquid (component) has 8 H, making 16 total. Hmm, option A is 16.

Wait, but why would each component have 8 H? Let me think of a compound with 8 H. For example, C4H8. But that's an alkane, which wouldn't decolorize bromine. So X can't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the components are C5H8. Each would have 8 H. But then, upon hydrogenation, would it become C5H10, which isn't cyclopropane.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible structures of X and Y.

Since Y is formed via a disproportionation, perhaps one component in X is breaking into two. For example, suppose X has a compound that, upon reaction, splits into two smaller compounds.

Wait, another idea: perhaps X contains an alkyne and a diene. Upon hydrogenation, the alkyne becomes an alkane, and the diene becomes another alkane, but both alkanes would not decolorize bromine. So Y would be a mixture of alkanes.

But when Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z, which is cyclopropane. So Y must have a structure that upon hydrogenation forms cyclopropane. But alkanes don't react with H2, so that's impossible. So perhaps Y isn't an alkane, but another structure.

Wait, perhaps Y is an alkene. No, because Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so it's an alkane. So I'm stuck.

Wait, another angle. Since when X is treated with Pt and heated, it forms Y via a disproportionation, perhaps X contains a molecule that can both add and remove H in the same reaction. For example, maybe it's a molecule with both double and triple bonds. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains a benzene derivative, but the H percentage of 14.28% doesn't fit. Wait, benzene is C6H6, which has a mass of 78. H is (6/78)*100≈7.69%, which is lower than 14.28.

Wait, perhaps X contains an alkyne. For example, propyne is C3H4. Upon hydrogenation, it becomes propane (C3H8), but that's not cyclopropane. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, I'm going around in circles. Let's try to think of possible X and Y structures.

Let me think of X as a mixture of two alkenes. Suppose they are propene and something else. But when X is hydrogenated, they become alkanes, which don't form cyclopropane. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but the problem says that both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So perhaps Y is also made up of compounds that hydrogenate to Z.

Wait, if Z is C3H6, then Y must be something like C3H4, which hydrogenates to C3H6. But Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so it can't have double bonds. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps Y contains a ring that upon hydrogenation (like ring-opening) forms cyclopropane. But I don't know of such a reaction.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let's consider that the answer is 8 H, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that X's components are C3H4. Maybe each has more H.

Wait, let's think again about the problem. The question is about the total number of H in two liquids (components) of mixture X.

If each component is C3H4, each has 4 H. So two components: 4 +4 =8. Not an option.

If each component is C4H6, each has 6 H. So two: 6+6=12 → option D.

Alternatively, each component is C5H8 → 8 H each. Two would be 16 → option A.

But I need to find which is correct.

Wait, another thought: the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's components. So perhaps X's components have isolated double bonds or triple bonds, but not conjugated.

So, if X's components are C4H6 with isolated double bonds, like 1,3-pentadiene (but that's longer), but perhaps something else.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should make a guess based on the earlier calculation that Z is C3H6, so X's components are C3H4, which have 4 H each. So two components would sum to 8 H. But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of H atoms in each of the two liquids (components), not the sum. So each component has 8 H, so 8 each → 16 total. So the answer would be A) 16.

But why would each component have 8 H? For example, if each is C4H8, which is an alkane, but X's components can't be alkanes because they decolorize bromine. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe each component is C5H8, which has 8 H. But that's an alkene, which decolorizes bromine. So that fits. So each is C5H8, each with 8 H. Two components, so 16 H. That would be option A.

But when you hydrogenate C5H8 (an alkene), it becomes C5H10, which is an alkane. But Z is C3H6, so that doesn't fit because C5H10 is larger. So that's not correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck again. Let me try to think differently.

If the two components of X are each C3H4, each has 4 H. So two components have 8 H. But since the options don't include 8, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the question is about the number of H atoms in each liquid (component), so each has 8, making total 16 → option A.

But why would each component have 8 H? Let's think of a compound with 8 H. For example, C4H8. But that's an alkane, which doesn't decolorize bromine, so X can't have that.

Alternatively, maybe the components are C4H6. Each has 6 H. Two would sum to 12 → option D.

If X is mixture of C4H6 (each component), then when hydrogenated, they would become C4H8, which is an alkane. But Z is C3H6, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: maybe X's components are C3H4 and C2H2. Let's see:

C3H4 has 4 H, C2H2 has 2 H. So two components would sum to 6 H. But 6 isn't an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps each component is C3H4, and each has 4 H. So two components have 8 H. But no option has 8. So perhaps I'm looking for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the total number of H atoms in each molecule of the two liquids, not per mole. So if X's two components are C3H4 and C4H6, their H counts are 4 and 6, sum to 10. Not an option.

Wait, maybe the two components are C3H4 and C3H4. So each has 4 H, sum to 8. So again, no option.

Alternatively, perhaps each liquid is a different structure, and each has 12 H. But that would be for a larger molecule.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the earlier calculation, Z is C3H6, so X's components must be C3H4, each with 4 H. But since the options don't have 8, perhaps the answer is D) 12, assuming each has 6 H. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the two components of X are each C4H6, which have 6 H each. So two components have 12 H → option D.

But then, hydrogenating C4H6 would give C4H8, not C3H6. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe each component is C2H4. Each has 4 H. Two components sum to 8. Again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps each component is C5H8, which has 8 H. Two components sum to 16 → option A.

But when you hydrogenate C5H8, you get C5H10, which is not Z.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should go with option D)12, as it's the sum of 6 H per component, which is plausible if each is C4H6.

But I'm not confident. Another thought: perhaps X's components are two different C3H4 compounds. Each has 4 H, so two components sum to 8 H. But since 8 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is 12, but I don't know why.

Wait, maybe each component has 6 H. Let's think of a C3H6 compound, but that's an alkene, which would decolorize bromine. But wait, Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so perhaps X's components are C3H4, which would hydrogenate to C3H6 (Z), and Y's components are C3H8, which hydrogenate to C3H10, but that's not possible.

I think I'm stuck. The only way to proceed is to make an educated guess. Based on the earlier calculation, each component of X is C3H4, which has 4 H. Two components sum to 8, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is 12, option D.

The problem involves analyzing a chemical reaction sequence and determining the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Key Observations**:
   - Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of unsaturated bonds (alkenes or alkynes).
   - When X is treated with platinum and heat, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, implying Y consists of saturated compounds (alkanes).
   - Hydrogenation of both X and Y under severe conditions produces only one substance, Z, which is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen equal to 14.28%. This corresponds to cyclopropane (C₃H₆), as the mass fraction calculation shows that the molecular formula must be CₙH₂ₙ, and cyclopropane fits the given percentage.
   - Z is a constituent of Y and is widely used as a solvent, further supporting that Z is cyclopropane.

2. **Analysis of X and Y**:
   - Since X contains unsaturated compounds (alkenes or alkynes) and Y contains saturated compounds (alkanes), the reaction from X to Y involves hydrogenation.
   - Both X and Y, when hydrogenated, yield only Z (C₃H₆), indicating that the components of X and Y are structured such that their hydrogenation leads exclusively to cyclopropane.

3. **Hydrogenation and Molecular Formulas**:
   - Z is C₃H₆, so the components of X must be unsaturated compounds that hydrogenate to form C₃H₆. This suggests that the components of X are likely C₃H₄ (e.g., propyne or propene), as adding two hydrogens (from H₂) to C₃H₄ produces C₃H₆.
   - Each component of X has 4 hydrogen atoms. Since X is an equimolar mixture of two such components, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of X is 4 (from the first component) + 4 (from the second component) = 8.

4. **Conflict with Options**:
   - The calculated total of 8 hydrogen atoms does not match any of the provided options (A: 16, B: 18, C: 22, D: 12). This discrepancy suggests a possible misinterpretation of the question or an issue with the options provided.

5. **Reevaluation and Best Guess**:
   - If the components of X were instead C₄H₆ (each with 6 hydrogen atoms), the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids would be 6 + 6 = 12, which corresponds to option D. While this does not perfectly align with the earlier analysis, it is the closest match to the given options.

Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible answer is **D) 12**, assuming the components of X are C₄H₆. 

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down.

The problem starts by talking about an equimolar mixture X of two liquids that decolorizes bromine water. Hmm, I remember that decolorizing bromine water is a test for unsaturation, like alkenes or alkynes. So mixture X must have compounds with double bonds or triple bonds because those can react with bromine.

Next, when mixture X is treated with platinum and heated, it undergoes a reaction to form mixture Y. The reaction is called a disproportionation, which means that a single substance is both oxidized and reduced. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the mixture X is two liquids, and after the reaction, it becomes two other liquids Y. Oh wait, no, the problem says the result is a disproportionation, which means each component in X might be undergoing a disproportionation or perhaps one of them does. Wait, but X is a mixture of two liquids, so maybe one of them is undergoing a disproportionation reaction. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the products of this reaction Y don't decolorize bromine water. So whatever Y is, it doesn't have any double or triple bonds anymore. So if the mixture X has compounds that can add bromine (like alkenes or alkynes), after the reaction, those have been hydrogenated or something else, perhaps adding hydrogen.

Then, when both X and Y are hydrogenated with platinum under severe conditions, they give only one substance Z. So Z is a hydrocarbon, and it's present in Y as one of the components. Also, Z has a mass fraction of hydrogen as 14.28%. 

Wait, 14.28% hydrogen. Let me calculate that. So the molecular formula of Z can be found. Let's suppose Z has a molecular formula CnHm. The mass fraction of H is (m/(12n + m)) * 100 = 14.28. Let me compute this:

14.28% is approximately 1/7, so m/(12n + m) ≈ 1/7. Let me rearrange:

7m = 12n + m → 6m = 12n → m = 2n.

So each molecule has twice as many H as C. So the formula is CnH2n. That's the formula for an alkene, but wait, Z is a hydrocarbon that doesn't react further with hydrogen. So if it's CnH2n, and it doesn't react with H2, that suggests it's a single bond structure. Wait, alkenes would react with H2. Oh wait, maybe it's something else. Wait, maybe it's a cyclic structure, like cyclopropane or something that can't hydrogenate further because all double bonds are consumed. Hmm, but wait, another possibility is that Z is a fully saturated compound, but that's not possible if it's CnH2n because that's the formula for an alkene. Unless it's a ring, which doesn't have double bonds anymore. Wait, maybe Z is a cycloalkane.

Alternatively, maybe Z is a di-substituted alkene that's already fully hydrogenated? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps Z is an aromatic compound, but that would have a higher H percentage. Wait, benzene is C6H6, which has a H percentage of (6/(78)) *100 ≈ 7.69%. Wait, but our Z has 14.28%, which is higher. So that's not benzene.

Wait, let's think again. CnH2n. Let's see possible n values. For n=1: CH2. Not possible. n=2: C2H4. That's ethylene. But ethylene would react with H2 under hydrogenation. So if Z doesn't react further, it can't be ethylene. Hmm, so maybe it's a cyclic compound, like cyclopropane (C3H6) or cyclobutane (C4H8). Let me check the H percentage for these.

Cyclopropane: C3H6. Molar mass is 3*12 +6=42. H mass is 6. (6/42)= 0.1428 → 14.28%. Yes! That's exactly the percentage given. So Z is cyclopropane, which is C3H6. Wait, but cyclopropane has a ring and no double bonds, so it won't react with H2 further. Because cyclopropane is a strained alkane. So that fits.

So Z is cyclopropane, C3H6. So when X and Y are hydrogenated, they both produce only cyclopropane. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the problem says hydrogenation of both X and Y gives only one substance Z. So both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So that suggests that X and Y are either the same as Z or can be converted into Z upon hydrogenation. Hmm.

Wait, X is a mixture of two liquids that can decolorize bromine, which suggests they have double or triple bonds. When X is treated with Pt and heat, it undergoes a disproportionation to form Y, which doesn't react with bromine. So Y must consist of fully saturated compounds, perhaps alkanes.

Hydrogenation refers to the addition of H2. So perhaps the components of X are unsaturated, and upon hydrogenation, they become alkanes. But in the problem, when X and Y are hydrogenated, both give only Z. So perhaps both X and Y, when hydrogenated, form cyclopropane. That implies that the starting materials in X and Y have structures that upon hydrogenation form cyclopropane.

Wait, let me think again. X is a mixture of two liquids; upon treatment with platinum and heat, it becomes Y. This reaction is a disproportionation. So one of the components of X is undergoing a disproportionation when heated with Pt. But wait, what kind of reaction is that? Maybe the breakdown of an alkene into two different products. Or maybe an alkyne?

Wait, Pt is a catalyst for hydrogenation, but in this context, when X is treated with Pt and heated, it undergoes a disproportionation. Wait, maybe it's a dehydrohalogenation or something else. Alternatively, perhaps X contains an alkyne, which upon heating with Pt, undergoes a reaction. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe X contains a compound that can undergo a hydrogenation but in a way that results in different products. Wait, but the problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heated, the result is Y, which is a mixture of two other liquids. So perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, and upon reaction, they form two alkanes, but that's not a disproportionation. Wait, but the problem says it's a disproportionation reaction. So a single compound in X is disproportionated into two different products. So X is a mixture, but one of the components is undergoing a disproportionation into two products, making Y a mixture of three components? No, the question says Y is a mixture of two liquids, so X must have two components, and each undergoes some reaction. Or perhaps one of the components is undergoing a disproportionation, breaking into two, while the other component remains as is. But the problem states Y is an equimolar mixture of two other liquids, possibly formed from X's components.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the reaction is the hydrogenation of an alkyne. Let's say X contains an alkyne. When hydrogenated in the presence of a catalyst, an alkyne can add two H2 molecules to become an alkane (if fully hydrogenated) or an alkene (if partially). But wait, the problem says it's a disproportionation. So perhaps one of the components in X is an alkyne, which upon reaction with Pt and heat, disproportionates into an alkene and an alkyne? No, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps into two alkenes? Hmm, not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the hydrogenation of X and Y. Both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z, which is cyclopropane. So what would need to be hydrogenated to form cyclopropane?

Wait, cyclopropane could be formed by the hydrogenation of a strained alkyne or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials in X and Y are alkenes and alkynes that hydrogenate to form cyclopropane.

Wait, but cyclopropane is a saturated molecule. So if X and Y are alkenes or alkynes, their hydrogenation would add hydrogen to form alkanes. Wait, but if Z is C3H6, which is cyclopropane, then perhaps X and Y are alkenes or something else that upon hydrogenation forms cyclopropane.

Hmm, maybe X and Y are dienes, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps X and Y have rings that upon hydrogenation open up to form cyclopropane. Wait, that seems a stretch.

Wait, perhaps X is a mixture of two alkenes, and Y is a mixture of their hydrogenation products. But then X's hydrogenation would give alkanes, but Z is a cyclopropane. Hmm, not fitting.

Wait, another angle. Since Z is a constituent of Y, and Y doesn't decolorize bromine, Y must consist of alkanes. So Y is a mixture of alkanes, and Z is one of them. But upon hydrogenation, both X and Y give Z. So perhaps X consists of alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form alkanes, but Z is a particular product.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to summarize the information:

1. X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water (so they have double or triple bonds).

2. X upon treatment with Pt and heat undergoes disproportionation to form Y, a mixture of two other liquids which don't decolorize bromine (so alkanes).

3. Hydrogenating X and Y with Pt under severe conditions gives only Z, which is a hydrocarbon with 14.28% H. As we found, Z is cyclopropane, C3H6.

So, when X is hydrogenated, all components must turn into cyclopropane. Similarly, when Y is hydrogenated, all components turn into cyclopropane. Wait, but Y is a mixture of alkanes. If Y's components are alkanes, then hydrogenation (adding H2) would not change them because alkanes are already saturated. So that can't be. Therefore, perhaps the hydrogenation is under more severe conditions, and maybe it's a different kind of reaction.

Wait, perhaps X and Y are alkenes and alkynes. Let's think about the hydrogenation process. If X is a mixture of an alkene and an alkyne, then hydrogenation would add H2 across the double and triple bonds. But if the hydrogenation of X gives only cyclopropane, that suggests that the starting materials must be such that adding H2 would form cyclopropane.

Wait, that seems tricky. Alternatively, perhaps X contains a compound that upon hydrogenation forms cyclopropane. How?

Wait, cyclopropane could be formed from a three-membered ring, but how? Maybe from a di-substituted alkene? No, hydrogenation of an alkene would saturate it, not form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a diene, and under hydrogenation, it forms a ring. For example, 1,3-butadiene hydrogenated could form cyclobutane, but that's not cyclopropane. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an alkyne. Let's think: an alkyne has a triple bond. When hydrogenated, it can become an alkene (if partially hydrogenated) or an alkane (if fully). But how would that lead to cyclopropane? Not sure.

Wait, maybe Z is the result of hydrogenation of X's components. So if X contains, say, an alkene and an alkyne, then hydrogenation would produce alkanes and an alkene. But that would require multiple products, but the problem states that both X and Y's hydrogenation gives only Z. So that suggests that all components in X and Y, when hydrogenated, give only Z.

Wait, perhaps X contains a compound that, when hydrogenated, releases H2 and forms Z. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe X is a mixture of two different alkenes, each of which, when hydrogenated, gives Z. So each alkene in X is such that adding H2 gives cyclopropane. Wait, but alkenes hydrogenate to alkanes. So, for example, cyclopropane has the formula C3H6. So if I have an alkene with the formula C3H4, adding two H's would make it C3H6. So, for example, propene (C3H6 when hydrogenated becomes propane, but that's not cyclopropane. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the components of X are such that when hydrogenated, they form cyclopropane. So let's think about the possible structures. If X is a mixture of 1,2-dienes or something, but that's getting complicated.

Wait, perhaps the key is that X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which, when hydrogenated, gives the same alkane, which is cyclopropane. But that's not possible because alkenes hydrogenate to alkanes, not cyclopropane.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains a cyclopropane derivative with unsaturated bonds that can hydrogenate. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two different dienes or something else that upon hydrogenation forms cyclopropane. But I'm not making progress here.

Let me think about the information again. Mixture Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so it's alkanes. When Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z, which is cyclopropane. But how? Because alkanes don't react with H2 under normal conditions. So maybe the hydrogenation of Y isn't adding H2 but doing something else. Alternatively, perhaps Y contains some other functional group that upon hydrogenation gives cyclopropane. Wait, maybe Y has a ring structure that upon hydrogenation (like ring-opening) forms cyclopropane. Not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the overall problem. We're supposed to find the number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of mixture X. Since X is equimolar, it has two components, each with their own structure.

We know that when X is hydrogenated, it gives Z as the only product, which is cyclopropane. So each of X's components, when hydrogenated, must form cyclopropane.

So, for each component in X, hydrogenation would add H2 to form Z.

Wait, but cyclopropane is C3H6, so the starting material must be C3H4 (since adding H2 would give C3H6). So each component in X is C3H4, an alkyne or an alkene.

But wait, what is C3H4? It can be propyne (HC≡CCH2), or propene (CH2=CHCH3), or possibly allene (CH2=C=CH2). But all of these would decolorize bromine water.

So, if X is a mixture of two C3H4 compounds, each would hydrogenate to cyclopropane? But no, because propene would hydrogenate to propane, propyne would hydrogenate to propane as well. Hmm, but that would give propane, not cyclopropane.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe X's components are not C3H4. Let's calculate the H percentage. Wait, Z is 14.28% H, which we determined is cyclopropane, C3H6.

So, when X is hydrogenated, the products are only Z. So X must be a mixture of two unsaturated compounds that, upon hydrogenation, produce cyclopropane.

Wait, but cyclopropane is a saturated compound. So how can hydrogenation of an unsaturated compound lead to cyclopropane?

Wait, hydrogenation is adding H2 across double or triple bonds. So if X's components have double bonds that, when hydrogenated, form cyclopropane.

Wait, maybe the starting materials are cyclopropane derivatives with double bonds. For example, if you have an allyl group attached to cyclopropane. But that's getting too speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are such that when they add H2, they form cyclopropane.

Wait, maybe X contains two different dienes or something else, but I'm not making progress.

Perhaps I should think about the reaction that X undergoes to form Y. It's a disproportionation, which suggests that a single species is both oxidized and reduced. So perhaps a compound in X is undergoing a reaction where one part is reduced and another part is oxidized.

Wait, for example, in the case of H2O2 decomposing into H2O and O2, that's a disproportionation. But in this case, it's a hydrocarbon undergoing such a reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps a compound with multiple bonds is breaking into smaller fragments. For example, if a molecule with a triple bond and a double bond undergoes a reaction where the triple bond becomes a double bond and a single bond, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is the breakdown of an alkyne into an alkene and an alkyne, but that doesn't seem like a disproportionation.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of an alkyne and an alkene, and upon reaction with Pt and heat, the alkyne is partially hydrogenated. But then Y would be a mixture of an alkene and an alkane, perhaps. Hmm.

Wait, but Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so it must be alkanes. So if X contained an alkyne and an alkene, upon hydrogenation, the alkyne would become an alkene (if partial) or an alkane (if full). But the problem says that when X is treated with Pt and heat, it forms Y, which is a mixture of two liquids that don't react with bromine. So Y must be alkanes.

Wait, but then the transformation from X to Y would involve adding H2 across triple and double bonds. But if X is a mixture of an alkyne and an alkene, then Y would be a mixture of an alkene and an alkane, but alkenes would still decolorize bromine. So that can't be, because Y doesn't decolorize bromine. Therefore, perhaps X's components are such that when hydrogenated, they become alkanes.

Wait, but if X is a mixture of an alkyne and an alkene, then upon full hydrogenation (adding H2 to triple and double bonds), they would become alkanes, which would form Y. But in the problem, treating X with Pt and heat gives Y, which doesn't react with bromine, so that makes sense.

Wait, but then why is the reaction called a disproportionation? Because a single component in X is undergoing a disproportionation reaction. So perhaps one of the components of X is undergoing a disproportionation, not just hydrogenation.

Wait, perhaps the component in X is an alkyne that upon reaction with Pt and heat, undergoes a reaction to produce two different products, one of which is an alkene and another an alkyne, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, another thought: perhaps X contains a compound with a triple bond and a double bond, which upon reaction, breaks into two different products. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydrogenolysis of a triple bond to form two alkenes, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the components of X are such that one is an alkyne and the other is an alkene, and upon hydrogenation, they become alkanes, which make Y.

Wait, but then the problem says X is treated with Pt and heat, which leads to Y. So that's hydrogenation conditions. So X's components are hydrogenated to form Y. But when Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z.

Wait, but Y is an alkane, so hydrogenation wouldn't do anything. So that can't be right because the problem says that Y's hydrogenation gives Z. So maybe Y isn't an alkane. Hmm, I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should focus on the hydrogenation part again. Since hydrogenating Y gives Z, which is cyclopropane, but Y doesn't contain any double bonds, so maybe Y has a ring that upon hydrogenation opens to form cyclopropane. But that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe Y contains a cyclopropane derivative with a functional group that upon hydrogenation forms cyclopropane. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that Z is a byproduct of the hydrogenation process. Wait, but the problem says that both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give only Z. So both X and Y's components, when hydrogenated, form Z. So perhaps X and Y are such that their hydrogenation leads to the same product.

Wait, maybe X is a mixture of two alkenes, each of which, when hydrogenated, gives the same alkane, which is cyclopropane. But that would require that each alkene is such that adding H2 forms cyclopropane. For example, if the alkene is part of a ring, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the molecular formula. Z is C3H6. So if X's components, when hydrogenated, form C3H6, their formulas must be C3H4. Because adding two H's (from H2) would take C3H4 to C3H6.

So, the components of X must have the formula C3H4. So each component is either propyne (HC≡C-CH3) or propene (CH2=CH2CH3), or allene (CH2=C=CH2).

But wait, each would be a different compound, so X is a mixture of two such compounds.

So, the two components of X would each be C3H4.

Now, the question is, how many H atoms are in each of these two components? Each has 4 H. So if X is an equimolar mixture of two such components, each molecule has 4 H. So for two moles, each with 4 H, the total H would be 2 * 4 * n, where n is the number of moles, but since it's equimolar, each component contributes the same number of H.

Wait, but the question is about the total number of H atoms in two liquids of mixture X. So, if mixture X is two equimolar components, each with formula C3H4, then each molecule has 4 H. So two components, each with 4 H. So the total H in two molecules would be 4 +4 =8. But wait, but the options don't have 8 as a choice. The options are 16, 18, 22, 12.

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the question says, "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X." So each component is a liquid (so two components), and each has a certain number of H atoms. So, if each component is C3H4, each has 4 H. So two components, each has 4 H. So total H per molecule in X is 4 (from component A) + 4 (from component B), giving 8 H atoms per pair of molecules? No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the mixture X is two different C3H4 compounds, each with 4 H. But the question is about the total number of H atoms in the two liquids of X. So the two liquids are each a different compound in X. So each has a certain number of H atoms, and the question is the sum of H atoms in both.

Wait, no, the question is phrased as "the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X." So perhaps each liquid is a separate component, and each has a certain number of H atoms. So if each component is C3H4, each has 4 H. So two components, each with 4 H, so total 8 H. But the options don't include 8. So maybe I'm wrong about the formulas.

Alternatively, perhaps the components of X are C4H6 or something else. Let me recalculate.

Wait, if Z is C3H6, and X's hydrogenation gives Z, perhaps X's components are C3H4. So, for each molecule in X, adding two H's (from H2) would make it C3H6. So each X component is C3H4. So, each has 4 H. So two components, so two molecules in X would have 4 +4 =8 H? No, but the options don't have 8.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in determining Z's formula. Let me recheck. The mass fraction of H is 14.28%, which is 1/7. So (m/(12n +m)) = 1/7 → 7m=12n +m → 6m=12n → m=2n. So the formula is CnH2n.

So, possible n and m:

n=1 → C H2 → not possible.
n=2 → C2H4 → ethylene. But ethylene would react with H2, which contradicts Z being unreactive.
n=3 → C3H6 → cyclopropane, which is correct because it's a saturated ring and wouldn't react further with H2.

So Z is C3H6, which is correct.

So X's components are C3H4. So each has 4 H. So each component in X is C3H4.

So, each molecule of X's component has 4 H.

Since X is a mixture of two equimolar components, each of which has 4 H, then each component contributes 4 H.

So, for two components, the total H atoms per molecule (for two molecules) would be 4 + 4 =8. But the options don't have 8. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe X's components are each C4H6, which would have 6 H each. So two components would give 6 +6=12 H. That would match option D) 12.

But why would X's components be C4H6?

Wait, because when hydrogenated, C4H6 would become C4H8. But Z is C3H6, so that can't be. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that X's components are not C3H4 but something else. Let me think about the hydrogenation again.

If X's hydrogenation produces Z (C3H6), which is cyclopropane, then perhaps the components in X are alkenes that, upon hydrogenation, form cyclopropane. But alkenes hydrogenate to alkanes, which would be larger than C3H6.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think about the number of H atoms in X's two components. The question is asking for the total number of H atoms in two liquids of mixture X. So if each component has a certain number of H, what's the sum.

Wait, perhaps the two components of X each have 12 H atoms. So the total would be 24, but that's not an option. Alternatively, each has 6 H, so total 12. That's option D) 12.

But why would the components have 6 H each? Let's see. For example, if each component is C3H6, but that can't be because X's components have double bonds and would decolorize bromine. Wait, but X's components are C3H4, which is less H than C3H6, so that's more unsaturated.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the components of X are CH2 groups or something. Alternatively, I'm getting stuck, so maybe I should look at the options.

The options given are A)16, B)18, C)22, D)12.

We thought that each component of X has 4 H, so two components would have 8 H. But that's not an option. So perhaps each component has 6 H. Then two would sum to 12, which is option D.

So perhaps the components of X are C4H6. Each has 6 H, two components sum to 12 H.

But how? Let me think about C4H6. It could be 1-butene (but that's C4H8, which is more H). Wait, no, 1,3-butadiene is C4H6, which is a diene. So, if X is a mixture of two C4H6 compounds, each with 6 H, then two would have 12 H in total. That would make option D correct.

But earlier I thought that the X components are C3H4, but perhaps I was wrong.

Wait, let me consider if each component is C4H6. Upon hydrogenation, adding 2 H (from H2) would give C4H8. But Z is C3H6, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe the components of X are C3H4 and C4H6. So their hydrogenation products would be C3H6 and C4H8. But the problem states that both X and Y hydrogenate to give only Z, which is C3H6. So this can't be.

Wait, maybe the components of X are such that when hydrogenated, they form cyclopropane. So their formulas must be C3H4. So each has 4 H. So two components would give 8 H, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of H atoms in each component, not the sum. But no, the question says "total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X." So perhaps each liquid (component) has 8 H, making 16 total. Hmm, option A is 16.

Wait, but why would each component have 8 H? Let me think of a compound with 8 H. For example, C4H8. But that's an alkane, which wouldn't decolorize bromine. So X can't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the components are C5H8. Each would have 8 H. But then, upon hydrogenation, would it become C5H10, which isn't cyclopropane.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible structures of X and Y.

Since Y is formed via a disproportionation, perhaps one component in X is breaking into two. For example, suppose X has a compound that, upon reaction, splits into two smaller compounds.

Wait, another idea: perhaps X contains an alkyne and a diene. Upon hydrogenation, the alkyne becomes an alkane, and the diene becomes another alkane, but both alkanes would not decolorize bromine. So Y would be a mixture of alkanes.

But when Y is hydrogenated, it gives Z, which is cyclopropane. So Y must have a structure that upon hydrogenation forms cyclopropane. But alkanes don't react with H2, so that's impossible. So perhaps Y isn't an alkane, but another structure.

Wait, perhaps Y is an alkene. No, because Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so it's an alkane. So I'm stuck.

Wait, another angle. Since when X is treated with Pt and heated, it forms Y via a disproportionation, perhaps X contains a molecule that can both add and remove H in the same reaction. For example, maybe it's a molecule with both double and triple bonds. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X contains a benzene derivative, but the H percentage of 14.28% doesn't fit. Wait, benzene is C6H6, which has a mass of 78. H is (6/78)*100≈7.69%, which is lower than 14.28.

Wait, perhaps X contains an alkyne. For example, propyne is C3H4. Upon hydrogenation, it becomes propane (C3H8), but that's not cyclopropane. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, I'm going around in circles. Let's try to think of possible X and Y structures.

Let me think of X as a mixture of two alkenes. Suppose they are propene and something else. But when X is hydrogenated, they become alkanes, which don't form cyclopropane. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, but the problem says that both X and Y, when hydrogenated, give Z. So perhaps Y is also made up of compounds that hydrogenate to Z.

Wait, if Z is C3H6, then Y must be something like C3H4, which hydrogenates to C3H6. But Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so it can't have double bonds. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps Y contains a ring that upon hydrogenation (like ring-opening) forms cyclopropane. But I don't know of such a reaction.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let's consider that the answer is 8 H, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that X's components are C3H4. Maybe each has more H.

Wait, let's think again about the problem. The question is about the total number of H in two liquids (components) of mixture X.

If each component is C3H4, each has 4 H. So two components: 4 +4 =8. Not an option.

If each component is C4H6, each has 6 H. So two: 6+6=12 → option D.

Alternatively, each component is C5H8 → 8 H each. Two would be 16 → option A.

But I need to find which is correct.

Wait, another thought: the problem states that there are no conjugated multiple bonds in X's components. So perhaps X's components have isolated double bonds or triple bonds, but not conjugated.

So, if X's components are C4H6 with isolated double bonds, like 1,3-pentadiene (but that's longer), but perhaps something else.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should make a guess based on the earlier calculation that Z is C3H6, so X's components are C3H4, which have 4 H each. So two components would sum to 8 H. But since that's not an option, perhaps I'm wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the number of H atoms in each of the two liquids (components), not the sum. So each component has 8 H, so 8 each → 16 total. So the answer would be A) 16.

But why would each component have 8 H? For example, if each is C4H8, which is an alkane, but X's components can't be alkanes because they decolorize bromine. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe each component is C5H8, which has 8 H. But that's an alkene, which decolorizes bromine. So that fits. So each is C5H8, each with 8 H. Two components, so 16 H. That would be option A.

But when you hydrogenate C5H8 (an alkene), it becomes C5H10, which is an alkane. But Z is C3H6, so that doesn't fit because C5H10 is larger. So that's not correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck again. Let me try to think differently.

If the two components of X are each C3H4, each has 4 H. So two components have 8 H. But since the options don't include 8, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the question is about the number of H atoms in each liquid (component), so each has 8, making total 16 → option A.

But why would each component have 8 H? Let's think of a compound with 8 H. For example, C4H8. But that's an alkane, which doesn't decolorize bromine, so X can't have that.

Alternatively, maybe the components are C4H6. Each has 6 H. Two would sum to 12 → option D.

If X is mixture of C4H6 (each component), then when hydrogenated, they would become C4H8, which is an alkane. But Z is C3H6, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: maybe X's components are C3H4 and C2H2. Let's see:

C3H4 has 4 H, C2H2 has 2 H. So two components would sum to 6 H. But 6 isn't an option.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps each component is C3H4, and each has 4 H. So two components have 8 H. But no option has 8. So perhaps I'm looking for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem refers to the total number of H atoms in each molecule of the two liquids, not per mole. So if X's two components are C3H4 and C4H6, their H counts are 4 and 6, sum to 10. Not an option.

Wait, maybe the two components are C3H4 and C3H4. So each has 4 H, sum to 8. So again, no option.

Alternatively, perhaps each liquid is a different structure, and each has 12 H. But that would be for a larger molecule.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the earlier calculation, Z is C3H6, so X's components must be C3H4, each with 4 H. But since the options don't have 8, perhaps the answer is D) 12, assuming each has 6 H. But I'm not confident.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the two components of X are each C4H6, which have 6 H each. So two components have 12 H → option D.

But then, hydrogenating C4H6 would give C4H8, not C3H6. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe each component is C2H4. Each has 4 H. Two components sum to 8. Again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps each component is C5H8, which has 8 H. Two components sum to 16 → option A.

But when you hydrogenate C5H8, you get C5H10, which is not Z.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should go with option D)12, as it's the sum of 6 H per component, which is plausible if each is C4H6.

But I'm not confident. Another thought: perhaps X's components are two different C3H4 compounds. Each has 4 H, so two components sum to 8 H. But since 8 isn't an option, perhaps the correct answer is 12, but I don't know why.

Wait, maybe each component has 6 H. Let's think of a C3H6 compound, but that's an alkene, which would decolorize bromine. But wait, Y doesn't decolorize bromine, so perhaps X's components are C3H4, which would hydrogenate to C3H6 (Z), and Y's components are C3H8, which hydrogenate to C3H10, but that's not possible.

I think I'm stuck. The only way to proceed is to make an educated guess. Based on the earlier calculation, each component of X is C3H4, which has 4 H. Two components sum to 8, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is 12, option D.


The problem involves analyzing a chemical reaction sequence and determining the total number of hydrogen atoms in two liquids of mixture X. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Key Observations**:
   - Mixture X is an equimolar mixture of two liquids that decolorize bromine water, indicating the presence of unsaturated bonds (alkenes or alkynes).
   - When X is treated with platinum and heat, it undergoes a disproportionation reaction to form mixture Y, which does not decolorize bromine water, implying Y consists of saturated compounds (alkanes).
   - Hydrogenation of both X and Y under severe conditions produces only one substance, Z, which is a hydrocarbon with a mass fraction of hydrogen equal to 14.28%. This corresponds to cyclopropane (C₃H₆), as the mass fraction calculation shows that the molecular formula must be CₙH₂ₙ, and cyclopropane fits the given percentage.
   - Z is a constituent of Y and is widely used as a solvent, further supporting that Z is cyclopropane.

2. **Analysis of X and Y**:
   - Since X contains unsaturated compounds (alkenes or alkynes) and Y contains saturated compounds (alkanes), the reaction from X to Y involves hydrogenation.
   - Both X and Y, when hydrogenated, yield only Z (C₃H₆), indicating that the components of X and Y are structured such that their hydrogenation leads exclusively to cyclopropane.

3. **Hydrogenation and Molecular Formulas**:
   - Z is C₃H₆, so the components of X must be unsaturated compounds that hydrogenate to form C₃H₆. This suggests that the components of X are likely C₃H₄ (e.g., propyne or propene), as adding two hydrogens (from H₂) to C₃H₄ produces C₃H₆.
   - Each component of X has 4 hydrogen atoms. Since X is an equimolar mixture of two such components, the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids of X is 4 (from the first component) + 4 (from the second component) = 8.

4. **Conflict with Options**:
   - The calculated total of 8 hydrogen atoms does not match any of the provided options (A: 16, B: 18, C: 22, D: 12). This discrepancy suggests a possible misinterpretation of the question or an issue with the options provided.

5. **Reevaluation and Best Guess**:
   - If the components of X were instead C₄H₆ (each with 6 hydrogen atoms), the total number of hydrogen atoms in the two liquids would be 6 + 6 = 12, which corresponds to option D. While this does not perfectly align with the earlier analysis, it is the closest match to the given options.

Based on the reasoning above, the most plausible answer is **D) 12**, assuming the components of X are C₄H₆. 

Answer: D
