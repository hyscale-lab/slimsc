Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the same goes for their masses—Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive. 

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, right, the problem says that the wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are the same. Oh, right, that's about the peak wavelength of their blackbody radiation. I remember something about Wien's Law here. Wien's displacement law says that the peak wavelength is inversely proportional to the temperature of the blackbody. So, if both stars have the same peak wavelength, their temperatures must be the same. That's interesting.

So, T1 = T2 because their peak wavelengths (λ_max) are the same. Because according to Wien's Law, λ_max * T = constant. So if λ_max is same for both, T must be same. Okay, so both stars have the same temperature.

Now, the question is about the luminosity. Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, right? L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Since both have the same T, and we know the radius of each, we can compare their luminosities.

Star_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's. Let's denote R2 as the radius of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So when we plug into the luminosity formula, L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)² σ T⁴. And L2 = 4π (R2)² σ T⁴.

So L1/L2 would be [(1.5 R2)^2] / [R2^2] = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. But wait, that's if all else is equal. But wait, the problem says that the masses are also 1.5 times larger, but does that affect the luminosity? Well, no, because in this problem, the luminosity is determined by radius and temperature. But wait, what if the mass affects the temperature? Oh, but the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same, so T must be same regardless of mass. So mass doesn't directly affect the luminosity here, except maybe through other factors not mentioned.

Wait, but the options given are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. So if the ratio is exactly 2.25, then A would be the answer. But why are the other options close to that? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait another thought: the problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is the component of the star's velocity along the line of sight. But how does that affect luminosity? Hmm. Luminosity is an intrinsic property, so it shouldn't depend on velocity. Unless the velocity affects the observed brightness due to Doppler shift. Oh! Wait, that's a possibility.

So, if a star is moving towards us, its light gets blueshifted, and moving away, it's redshifted. But in this case, Star_1 has 0 radial velocity, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s. Wait, but since Star_2's light is redshifted, would that affect the observed brightness? Oh, but the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosities assuming blackbody radiation. So perhaps they corrected for any Doppler shifts, because otherwise, the observed wavelength would differ, but the problem states they found the same λ_max. Hmm, perhaps the Doppler shift would cause a shift in the observed wavelength, but since the computed λ_max is the same, it's possible that the shift was accounted for.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. Luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, which is the total energy emitted per second. But when a star is moving, the observed flux (which is what we measure) changes due to the Doppler effect. Oh, right! So the observed flux F is given by F = L / (4π d²) * (1 - v/c), where v is the velocity along the line of sight. Wait, no, the Doppler factor for flux is (1 + v_r/c) for receding, but I'm a bit hazy on the exact formula. Alternatively, the observed flux is F = F0 * (1 - v_r/c), where v_r is the radial velocity. Or maybe the other way around. Actually, I think the flux is affected by the Doppler shift. The observed flux depends on the luminosity and the Doppler factor.

Wait, the observed flux would be F = L (1 - v_r / c) / (4π d²). So if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, its observed flux would be lower than what it would be at rest. But in this problem, the peak wavelengths are the same, which could mean that the Doppler shifts are accounted for, or perhaps the stars are at the same distance. Alternatively, maybe the problem is saying that after considering the Doppler shift, the peak wavelengths are the same. Hmm. 

Wait, but the problem states that astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest, and found that they are the same. So perhaps they have adjusted for the Doppler shift. Because if Star_2 is moving towards or away, its emission would be shifted, but if the observed λ_max is same, then perhaps the actual temperatures are same, or the shift was considered.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the rest frame of the stars, not the observer's frame. So the peak λ is same, implying same T. So the radial velocities (Doppler shifts) would affect the observed temperature, but since the problem says that the observed λ_max is same, perhaps the T is same. But perhaps the velocities are causing the observed fluxes to differ, but the problem is about the intrinsic luminosity, not the observed flux.

Wait, the problem says that after determining the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest (so in their own frames, perhaps?), then their temperatures are same. So maybe the Doppler shift is irrelevant for the calculation of the luminosity, because the luminosity is an intrinsic property. So L is 4pi R² sigma T^4, so the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, but not the actual luminosity.

So in that case, the luminosity ratio is (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the answer would be A) ~2.25.

But wait, the options have B ~2.32, which is approximately (1.5)^2 * something. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the luminosity is not just based on radius and temperature, but also on mass? But in this problem, the stars are treated as blackbodies, so their luminosity depends on R^2 and T^4. The mass is given, but the problem doesn't directly tie mass to temperature. Unless using the mass-radius relation for stars. Wait, for main-sequence stars, hotter (more massive) stars are larger. But in this problem, Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive and 1.5 times larger in radius than Star_2. So it's consistent with main-sequence scaling. But it's not necessary for this problem because the temperature is given to be same.

Alternatively, perhaps the velocities affect the radius via Doppler broadening, but I don't think that would change the actual radius. The radius is an intrinsic property.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The problem says that the stars are treated as black bodies, and the luminosity is computed. So the formula is L = 4pi R^2 sigma T^4. Since R1 = 1.5 R2, and T1 = T2, then L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25. So the correct answer would be A) ~2.25.

But wait, why is option B) ~2.32 present? 2.32 is approximately (1.5)^2 * (1.02), something like that. What if there's another factor, like the Doppler shift? Let's re-examine.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, would that affect the observed temperature or the observed radius? Hmm. If Star_2 is moving towards us, it's blueshifted, so the observed wavelengths are shorter. But the problem says the peak wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift is accounted for, meaning that the actual T would be different. Wait, but that complicates things.

Wait, let me think again. If the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelengths are shorter. So the observed λ_max is λ observed = λ_rest * (1 - v_r/c). But in the problem, the observed λ_max is same for both. So if Star_2 has a higher velocity, perhaps its actual (rest) frame λ_max is different. Hmm, but the problem says the astronomers found the same λ_max, so perhaps that's in their rest frames. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is entirely about the intrinsic luminosity, so the Doppler shift doesn't affect the calculation. So the answer is 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but why would the problem mention the velocities then? Maybe it's a red herring. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, another angle: Luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, but the observed flux is affected by the Doppler shift. The observed flux F is L * (1 - v_r / c) / (4pi d^2), where v_r is the radial velocity. So if both stars are at the same distance, the observed flux would differ due to their velocities. But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are same, so perhaps the problem is about the flux, not the intrinsic luminosity.

Wait, but the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So it's about the intrinsic L, not the observed F. So the velocities shouldn't matter because L is an intrinsic property. So the answer is 2.25, option A.

Hmm, but that doesn't match why the velocities are part of the problem. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed temperature, but the problem says that the peak wavelengths are same, so perhaps the temperatures are same, hence T1 = T2. So the velocities don't influence the T as they are accounted for.

Wait, but the problem says that through spectroscopy, the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed wavelength would be shorter. But the problem says that the wavelengths are same, so perhaps after correcting for the Doppler shift, the actual temperatures are same. So the T is same for both stars.

So in this case, L1 = (R1/R2)^2 * L2. R1=1.5 R2. So L1/L2 = (2.25). So again, the answer is A.

But why are there options like ~2.32? Maybe I should think about relativistic effects, but 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s), so relativistic effects would be negligible. So (1 + v/c) would be about 1.0023, which isn't significant enough to change 2.25 to 2.32.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else. Oh wait, maybe the blackbody radiation formula is scaled by the Doppler factor. Because the observed flux is F = F0 (1 - v_r / c), where F0 is the flux at rest. So when computing the luminosity, perhaps the observers account for the Doppler effect. Or perhaps the problem is about the observed fluxes.

Wait, but the problem says they computed the luminosities, so they must have accounted for the Doppler shifts. So perhaps L1 is the intrinsic luminosity, and L2 is (intrinsic luminosity) * (1 - v_r / c) / (1 - v1_r/c), but no, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed fluxes are same, but that's not stated. The problem says that the peak wavelengths are same, which would imply same T after accounting for Doppler. But I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, maybe the problem is not accounting for the Doppler shift in temperature. Let me think again. If Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its observed wavelength is shorter, so the observed T is higher. But in the problem, the observed λ_max is same, so the observed T must be same. So their actual temperatures (in their rest frames) must be different. Wait, but that would complicate things because then T1 and T2 wouldn't be same.

Wait, wait. Let me approach this more carefully. The problem states that the peak wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are same. So that's the observed λ_max. So using Wien's law, the observed temperature is T_observed = T_rest * (1 - v_r / c). So if the observed λ_max is same for both, then T1_obs = T2_obs. So:

T1 * (1 - v1_r/c) = T2 * (1 - v2_r/c)

Because Star_1 has v1_r = 0, and Star_2 has v2_r = 700 km/s (assuming moving away, but I'm not sure about the sign). Wait, actually, the formula depends on whether the star is moving towards or away. If a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so T_obs = T_rest * (1 + v_r/c) for receding (v_r positive if moving away). Or I might have the sign wrong. Alternatively, the Doppler shift formula can be written as λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is positive for moving away. So T_obs = c / (λ_obs) = (c / (λ_rest (1 + v_r/c))) ) = T_rest / (1 + v_r/c).

So T_obs = T_rest * (1 - v_r/c) / (1 + v_r/c) ? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me get the correct Doppler shift formula for wavelength.

The relativistic Doppler effect formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) ), but for non-relativistic speeds, v << c, this can be approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r / c). So if a star is moving away, v_r is positive, so observed wavelength is longer, and hence the observed temperature is lower, as T_obs = c / λ_obs = c / [λ_rest (1 + v_r/c)] ≈ (c / λ_rest) * (1 - v_r/c) = T_rest (1 - v_r/c).

So for small velocities, T_obs ≈ T_rest (1 - v_r/c).

In the problem, both stars have same observed λ_max, so same T_obs. So:

T1_obs = T2_obs.

Which can be written as:

T1 (1 - v1_r/c) = T2 (1 - v2_r/c).

But Star_1's radial velocity is 0, so v1_r =0. So:

T1 = T2 (1 - v2_r/c) / (1 - 0) ) = T2 (1 - v2_r/c )

Wait, no, because for Star_2, if it's moving away, v_r is positive. So v2_r =700 km/s.

So T1 = T2 * (1 - (700e3 m/s) / (3e8 m/s)) )

Calculating that:

700e3 /3e8 = 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333.

So 1 - 0.02333 ≈ 0.97667.

So T1 = T2 * 0.97667.

So T1 is about 0.97667 times T2.

Wait, but the problem states that the stars appear brightest at same wavelength. So their observed λ_max are same, implying same observed T. But their actual (intrinsic) temperatures are different.

But the problem says that the luminosity is to be computed as black bodies. So L =4π R² σ T^4. But since T here is the intrinsic temperature, not the observed, then Star_1 has T = T1, Star_2 has T = T2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that since the observed T is same, T1*(1 - v1/c) = T2*(1 - v2/c). But if v1 is zero and v2 is 700 km/s, then T1 = T2 * (1 - (700e3 /3e8)).

So T1 ≈ T2 * 0.976667.

So when computing the luminosity, L1 =4π (1.5 R2)^2 σ (T1)^4.

L2 =4π R2^2 σ (T2)^4.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

But T1 = T2 * 0.976667.

So (T1/T2) = 0.976667.

So (0.976667)^4 ≈ let's compute that.

0.976667^2 ≈ 0.9538 (since 0.976667 ≈ 1 - 0.02333, and (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x + x², which is about 0.9538 for x=0.02333).

Then, 0.9538^2 ≈ 0.9097.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9097.

So L1/L2 = (2.25) * 0.9097 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9097 ≈ 2.040.

Wait, that's lower than 2.25. But that would be if the luminosity is calculated using T_rest, but the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming blackbody radiation. Hmm, but wait, I'm confusing observed and intrinsic parameters.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the observed flux is affected by the Doppler shift, so when computing luminosity, you have to correct for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the luminosity calculation uses the observed temperature, not the intrinsic. Because the astronomers are determining the luminosity based on the observed wavelengths.

But that's getting complicated. Let me try to clarify.

If the observed λ_max is same, meaning the observed T is same, then the intrinsic T is different. So when computing luminosity using the observed T, you might get a different ratio.

Wait, but the problem says that the stars are assumed to be black bodies, so the luminosity is computed based on their true radius and temperature.

So when computing L1 and L2, the astronomers would need the true T1 and T2.

But if the observed T is same, then T1 = T_observed * (1 - v1_r/c) = T_obs.

Wait, no. Wait, the observed T is T_obs = T_rest * (1 - v_r/c).

So if T_obs is same for both stars, then:

T1_rest * (1 - 0) = T2_rest * (1 - 700e3/3e8 )

So T1_rest = T2_rest * (1 - v2_r/c ) = T2_rest * (1 - 0.02333) ≈ 0.97667 T2_rest.

So T1 is about 0.97667 T2.

So when calculating L1 and L2:

L1 = 4 pi (1.5 R2)^2 sigma (T1)^4.

L2 = 4 pi (R2)^2 sigma (T2)^4.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

We've already found T1/T2 ≈ 0.97667.

So (0.97667)^4 ≈ ~0.9097.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9097 ≈ 2.04.

Wait, but that's lower than 2.25. But none of the options are close to 2.04. The options are A) 2.25, B)2.32, etc.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem treats the observed T as the actual T, which would mean that T1 = T2. Because the observed λ_max is same, so T1_obs = T2_obs. But then, the Doppler shift would imply that T1_rest = T1_obs / (1 - v1_r/c ) = T2_obs / (1 - v2_r/c ), but v1_r is zero, so T1_rest = T2_rest / (1 - v2_r/c ). Which is similar to what I did earlier.

But perhaps the problem is not considering the Doppler effect, treating the observed λ_max as the actual λ_max, hence same T. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25, so answer A.

But why would the problem include velocity data then? It might be a distractor, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the observed flux, but the question is about the computed luminosity.

Wait, perhaps the astronomers computed the luminosity using (R^2 * T^4), where T is the observed temperature. So if the observed T is same, then L would be (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

But in reality, the true T is higher for Star_2, but the problem says the computed luminosity is based on their observed properties.

Wait, no, the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming blackbody. So perhaps they used the observed T, but the observed T is same for both. So they would compute L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T_obs^4.

Similarly, L2 =4 pi R2^2 sigma T_obs^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 =2.25.

So the correct answer would be A) ~2.25.

But the problem includes the velocity information, so perhaps that affects the calculation in a way I'm not seeing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the intrinsic luminosity but the observed flux, but the question says they computed the luminosity, which is an intrinsic property.

So I'm going to think that the answer is A) ~2.25.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, based on their radii and the fact that their peak wavelengths (λ_max) are the same. The key steps to solve the problem are as follows:

1. **Wien's Law and Temperature**: The peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature \( T \) of a blackbody, given by \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \cdot T = \text{constant} \). Since the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, their temperatures must be the same (\( T_1 = T_2 \)).

2. **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity \( L \) of a star is given by \( L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \), where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature. Since \( T_1 = T_2 \), the luminosity ratio depends only on the ratio of their radii.

3. **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2 (\( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)). Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the luminosity ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
   \]

4. **Radial Velocities and Doppler Shift**: The problem mentions radial velocities of 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. However, since the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, the Doppler shift has already been accounted for, and the intrinsic temperatures are effectively the same. Thus, the radial velocities do not affect the calculation of the intrinsic luminosities.

5. **Conclusion**: The luminosity ratio is determined solely by the radius ratio, giving \( L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 \). The other options (B, C, D) are close to this value but do not align with the calculation.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question is about the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. The problem says that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2, and the same goes for their masses—Star_1 is 1.5 times more massive.

So, T1 = T2 because their peak wavelengths (λ_max) are the same. Because according to Wien's Law, λ_max * T = constant. So if λ_max is same for both, T must be same. Okay, so both stars have the same temperature.

Now, the question is about the luminosity. Luminosity of a star is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, right? L = 4π R² σ T⁴. Since both have the same T, and we know the radius of each, we can compare their luminosities.

Star_1's radius is 1.5 times Star_2's. Let's denote R2 as the radius of Star_2. So R1 = 1.5 R2. So when we plug into the luminosity formula, L1 = 4π (1.5 R2)² σ T⁴. And L2 = 4π (R2)² σ T⁴.

So L1/L2 would be [(1.5 R2)^2] / [R2^2] = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So L1 is 2.25 times L2. But wait, that's if all else is equal. But wait, the problem says that the masses are also 1.5 times larger, but does that affect the luminosity? Well, no, because in this problem, the luminosity is determined by radius and temperature. But wait, what if the mass affects the temperature? Oh, but the problem states that the peak wavelengths are the same, so T must be same regardless of mass. So mass doesn't directly affect the luminosity here, except maybe through other factors not mentioned.

Wait, but the options given are A) ~2.25, B) ~2.32, C) ~2.35, D) ~2.23. So if the ratio is exactly 2.25, then A would be the answer. But why are the other options close to that? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait another thought: the problem mentions radial velocities. Star_1 has a radial velocity of 0 km/s and Star_2 has 700 km/s. Wait, radial velocity is the component of the star's velocity along the line of sight. But how does that affect luminosity? Hmm. Luminosity is an intrinsic property, so it shouldn't depend on velocity. Unless the velocity affects the observed brightness due to Doppler shift. Oh! Wait, that's a possibility.

So, if a star is moving towards us, its light gets blueshifted, and moving away, it's redshifted. But in this case, Star_1 has 0 radial velocity, so no Doppler shift. Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s.

So the observed flux F is given by F = L / (4π d²) * (1 - v/c), where v is the velocity along the line of sight. Wait, no, the Doppler factor for flux is (1 + v_r/c) for receding, but I'm a bit hazy on the exact formula. Alternatively, the observed flux is F = F0 * (1 - v_r/c), where v_r is the radial velocity. Or maybe the other way around. Actually, I think the flux is affected by the Doppler shift. The observed flux depends on the luminosity and the Doppler factor.

Wait, the observed flux would be F = L (1 - v_r / c) / (4π d²). So if Star_2 is moving away at 700 km/s, its observed flux would be lower than what it would be at rest. But in this problem, the peak wavelengths are the same, which could mean that the Doppler shifts are accounted for, or perhaps the stars are at the same distance.

So L is 4pi R² sigma T^4, so the Doppler shift affects the observed flux, but not the actual luminosity.

So in that case, the luminosity ratio is (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25. So the answer would be A) ~2.25.

But wait, why is option B) ~2.32 present? 2.32 is approximately (1.5)^2 * (1.02), something like that. What if there's another factor, like the Doppler shift? Let's re-examine.

Wait, if Star_2 is moving at 700 km/s, would that affect the observed temperature or the observed radius? Hmm. If Star_2 is moving towards us, it's blueshifted, so the observed wavelengths are shorter. But the problem says the peak wavelengths are the same. So perhaps the Doppler shift is accounted for, meaning that the actual T would be different. Wait, but that complicates things.

Wait, let me think again. If the star is moving towards us, the observed wavelengths are shorter. So the observed λ_max is λ observed = λ_rest * (1 - v_r/c). But in the problem, the observed λ_max is same for both. So if Star_2 has a higher velocity, perhaps its actual (rest) frame λ_max is different. Hmm, but the problem says the astronomers found the same λ_max, so perhaps that's in their rest frames. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is entirely about the intrinsic luminosity, so the Doppler shift doesn't affect the calculation. So the answer is 2.25, which is option A.

Wait, but why would the problem mention the velocities then? Maybe it's a red herring. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, another angle: Luminosity is the intrinsic brightness, but the observed flux is affected by the Doppler shift. The observed flux F is L * (1 - v_r / c) / (4pi d^2), where v_r is the radial velocity. So if both stars are at the same distance, the observed flux would differ due to their velocities. But the problem states that the observed wavelengths are same, so perhaps the problem is about the flux, not the intrinsic luminosity.

Wait, but the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity of Star_1 to be greater than Star_2 by a factor. So it's about the intrinsic L, not the observed F. So the velocities shouldn't matter because L is an intrinsic property. So the answer is 2.25, option A.

Hmm, but that doesn't match why the velocities are part of the problem. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the Doppler shift affects the observed temperature, but the problem says that the peak wavelengths are same, so perhaps the temperatures are same, hence T1 = T2. So the velocities don't influence the T as they are accounted for.

Wait, but the problem says that through spectroscopy, the astronomers determined the wavelengths at which the stars appeared brightest. So if Star_2 is moving towards us, the observed wavelength would be shorter. But the problem says that the wavelengths are same, so perhaps after correcting for the Doppler shift, the actual temperatures are same. So the T is same for both stars.

So in this case, L1 = (R1/R2)^2 * L2. R1=1.5 R2. So L1/L2 = (2.25). So again, the answer is A.

But why are there options like ~2.32? Maybe I should think about relativistic effects, but 700 km/s is much less than the speed of light (which is about 3e5 km/s), so relativistic effects would be negligible. So (1 + v/c) would be about 1.0023, which isn't significant enough to change 2.25 to 2.32.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else. Oh wait, maybe the blackbody radiation formula is scaled by the Doppler factor. Because the observed flux is F = F0 (1 - v_r / c), where F0 is the flux at rest. So when computing the luminosity, perhaps the observers account for the Doppler effect. Or perhaps the problem is about the observed fluxes.

Wait, but the problem says they computed the luminosities, so they must have accounted for the Doppler shifts. So perhaps L1 is the intrinsic luminosity, and L2 is (intrinsic luminosity) * (1 - v_r / c) / (1 - v1_r/c), but no, that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the observed fluxes are same, but that's not stated. The problem says that the peak wavelengths are same, which would imply same T after accounting for Doppler. But I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, maybe the problem is not accounting for the Doppler shift in temperature. Let me think again. If Star_2 is moving towards us at 700 km/s, its observed wavelength is shorter, so the observed T is higher. But in the problem, the observed λ_max is same, so the observed T must be same. So their actual temperatures (in their rest frames) must be different. Wait, but that would complicate things because then T1 and T2 wouldn't be same.

Wait, wait. Let me approach this more carefully. The problem states that the peak wavelengths at which the stars appear brightest are same. So that's the observed λ_max. So using Wien's law, the observed temperature is T_observed = T_rest * (1 - v_r / c). So if the observed λ_max is same for both, then T1_obs = T2_obs. So:

T1 * (1 - v1_r/c) = T2 * (1 - v2_r/c)

Because Star_1 has v1_r = 0, and Star_2 has v2_r = 700 km/s (assuming moving away, but I'm not sure about the sign). Wait, actually, the formula depends on whether the star is moving towards or away. If a star is moving away, the observed wavelength is longer, so T_obs = T_rest * (1 + v_r/c) for receding (v_r positive if moving away). Or I might have the sign wrong. Alternatively, the Doppler shift formula can be written as λ_obs = λ_rest * (1 + v_r/c), where v_r is positive for moving away. So T_obs = c / (λ_obs) = (c / (λ_rest (1 + v_r/c))) ) = T_rest / (1 + v_r/c).

So T_obs = T_rest * (1 - v_r/c) / (1 + v_r/c) ? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me get the correct Doppler shift formula for wavelength.

The relativistic Doppler effect formula is λ_obs = λ_rest * sqrt( (1 + v_r / c) / (1 - v_r / c) ), but for non-relativistic speeds, v << c, this can be approximated as λ_obs ≈ λ_rest (1 + v_r / c). So if a star is moving away, v_r is positive, so observed wavelength is longer, and hence the observed temperature is lower, as T_obs = c / λ_obs = c / [λ_rest (1 + v_r/c)] ≈ (c / λ_rest) * (1 - v_r/c) = T_rest (1 - v_r/c).

So for small velocities, T_obs ≈ T_rest (1 - v_r/c).

In the problem, both stars have same observed λ_max, so same T_obs. So:

T1_obs = T2_obs.

Which can be written as:

T1 (1 - v1_r/c) = T2 (1 - v2_r/c).

But Star_1's radial velocity is 0, so v1_r =0. So:

T1 = T2 (1 - v2_r/c) / (1 - 0) ) = T2 (1 - v2_r/c )

Wait, no, because for Star_2, if it's moving away, v_r is positive. So v2_r =700 km/s.

So T1 = T2 * (1 - (700e3 m/s) / (3e8 m/s)) )

Calculating that:

700e3 /3e8 = 7e5 /3e8 = 7/(300) ≈ 0.02333.

So 1 - 0.02333 ≈ 0.97667.

So T1 = T2 * 0.97667.

So T1 is about 0.97667 times T2.

Wait, but the problem states that the stars appear brightest at same wavelength. So their observed λ_max are same, implying same observed T. But their actual (intrinsic) temperatures are different.

But the problem says that the luminosity is to be computed as black bodies. So L =4π R² σ T^4. But since T here is the intrinsic temperature, not the observed, then Star_1 has T = T1, Star_2 has T = T2.

Wait, but earlier I thought that since the observed T is same, T1*(1 - v1/c) = T2*(1 - v2/c). But if v1 is zero and v2 is 700 km/s, then T1 = T2 * (1 - (700e3 /3e8)).

So T1 ≈ T2 * 0.976667.

So when computing the luminosity, L1 =4π (1.5 R2)^2 σ (T1)^4.

L2 =4π R2^2 σ (T2)^4.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

But T1 = T2 * 0.976667.

So (T1/T2) = 0.976667.

So (0.976667)^4 ≈ let's compute that.

0.976667^2 ≈ 0.9538 (since 0.976667 ≈ 1 - 0.02333, and (1 - x)^2 ≈ 1 - 2x + x², which is about 0.9538 for x=0.02333).

Then, 0.9538^2 ≈ 0.9097.

So (T1/T2)^4 ≈ 0.9097.

So L1/L2 = (2.25) * 0.9097 ≈ 2.25 * 0.9097 ≈ 2.040.

Wait, that's lower than 2.25. But that would be if the luminosity is calculated using T_rest, but the problem says that the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming blackbody radiation. Hmm, but wait, I'm confusing observed and intrinsic parameters.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the observed flux is affected by the Doppler shift, so when computing luminosity, you have to correct for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the luminosity calculation uses the observed temperature, not the intrinsic. Because the astronomers are determining the luminosity based on the observed wavelengths.

But that's getting complicated. Let me try to clarify.

If the observed λ_max is same, meaning the observed T is same, then the intrinsic T is different. So when computing luminosity using the observed T, you might get a different ratio.

Wait, but the problem says that the stars are assumed to be black bodies, so the luminosity is computed based on their true radius and temperature.

So when computing L1 and L2, the astronomers would need the true T1 and T2.

But if the observed T is same, then T1 = T_observed * (1 - v1_r/c) = T_obs.

Wait, no. Wait, the observed T is T_obs = T_rest * (1 - v_r/c).

So if T_obs is same for both stars, then:

T1_rest * (1 - 0) = T2_rest * (1 - 700e3/3e8 )

So T1_rest = T2_rest * (1 - v2_r/c ) = T2_rest * (1 - 0.02333) ≈ 0.97667 T2_rest.

So T1 is about 0.97667 T2.

So when calculating L1 and L2:

L1 = 4 pi (1.5 R2)^2 sigma (T1)^4.

L2 = 4 pi (R2)^2 sigma (T2)^4.

So L1/L2 = (1.5)^2 * (T1/T2)^4.

We've already found T1/T2 ≈ 0.97667.

So (0.97667)^4 ≈ ~0.9097.

So L1/L2 = 2.25 * 0.9097 ≈ 2.04.

Wait, but that's lower than 2.25. But none of the options are close to 2.04. The options are A) 2.25, B)2.32, etc.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the problem treats the observed T as the actual T, which would mean that T1 = T2. Because the observed λ_max is same, so T1_obs = T2_obs. But then, the Doppler shift would imply that T1_rest = T1_obs / (1 - v1_r/c ) = T2_obs / (1 - v2_r/c ), but v1_r is zero, so T1_rest = T2_rest / (1 - v2_r/c ). Which is similar to what I did earlier.

But perhaps the problem is not considering the Doppler effect, treating the observed λ_max as the actual λ_max, hence same T. So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25, so answer A.

But why would the problem include velocity data then? It might be a distractor, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about the observed flux, but the question is about the computed luminosity.

Wait, perhaps the astronomers computed the luminosity using (R^2 * T^4), where T is the observed temperature. So if the observed T is same, then L would be (R1/R2)^2 = 2.25.

But in reality, the true T is higher for Star_2, but the problem says the computed luminosity is based on their observed properties.

Wait, no, the problem says the astronomers computed the luminosity assuming blackbody. So perhaps they used the observed T, but the observed T is same for both. So they would compute L1 = 4 pi R1^2 sigma T_obs^4.

Similarly, L2 =4 pi R2^2 sigma T_obs^4.

So L1/L2 = (R1/R2)^2 = (1.5)^2 =2.25.

So the correct answer would be A) ~2.25.

But the problem includes the velocity information, so perhaps that affects the calculation in a way I'm not seeing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about the intrinsic luminosity but the observed flux, but the question says they computed the luminosity, which is an intrinsic property.

So I'm going to think that the answer is A) ~2.25.


The problem involves determining the ratio of the luminosities of two stars, Star_1 and Star_2, based on their radii and the fact that their peak wavelengths (λ_max) are the same. The key steps to solve the problem are as follows:

1. **Wien's Law and Temperature**: The peak wavelength λ_max is inversely proportional to the temperature \( T \) of a blackbody, given by \( \lambda_{\text{max}} \cdot T = \text{constant} \). Since the observed λ_max for both stars is the same, their temperatures must be the same (\( T_1 = T_2 \)).

2. **Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The luminosity \( L \) of a star is given by \( L = 4\pi R^2 \sigma T^4 \), where \( R \) is the radius and \( T \) is the temperature. Since \( T_1 = T_2 \), the luminosity ratio depends only on the ratio of their radii.

3. **Radius Ratio**: The problem states that Star_1 has a radius 1.5 times larger than Star_2 (\( R_1 = 1.5 R_2 \)). Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the luminosity ratio is:
   \[
   \frac{L_1}{L_2} = \left(\frac{R_1}{R_2}\right)^2 = (1.5)^2 = 2.25
   \]

4. **Radial Velocities and Doppler Shift**: The problem mentions radial velocities of 0 km/s for Star_1 and 700 km/s for Star_2. However, since the observed λ_max is the same for both stars, the Doppler shift has already been accounted for, and the intrinsic temperatures are effectively the same. Thus, the radial velocities do not affect the calculation of the intrinsic luminosities.

5. **Conclusion**: The luminosity ratio is determined solely by the radius ratio, giving \( L_1 / L_2 = 2.25 \). The other options (B, C, D) are close to this value but do not align with the calculation.
