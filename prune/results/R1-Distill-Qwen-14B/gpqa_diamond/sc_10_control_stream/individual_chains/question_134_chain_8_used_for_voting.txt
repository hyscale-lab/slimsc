Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy of neutralization when some acids and a base are mixed. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy of neutralization is usually about the heat released when an acid reacts with a base. But wait, this problem has more than one acid and a base, and I'm a bit confused about how to approach it.

Let me read the problem again. It says 500 mL of 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL of 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL of 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. So, I think I need to figure out how much acid and base there is in total and then see which one is in excess because the neutralization depends on that.

Wait, HCl is a strong acid and H2SO4 is also strong. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base. When these are mixed, the H+ ions from the acids will react with the OH- ions from the base. The reaction should produce water and the corresponding salts.

But I need to calculate the moles of H+ and OH- first. Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, each molecule can donate two H+ ions. Ba(OH)2, on the other hand, each molecule provides two OH- ions since Ba is +2 and OH is -1 each.

Let me start by calculating moles for each solution.

First, moles of HCl: Molarity is 0.2 M, volume is 0.5 L. Moles = M x V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 moles. And since HCl is a strong acid, it will donate one H+ per molecule. So H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles.

Next, moles of H2SO4: 0.3 M, 0.3 L (300 mL). Moles = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 moles. Since H2SO4 is diprotic, each gives 2 H+ ions. So H+ from H2SO4 is 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 moles.

Total H+ from acids: 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 moles.

Now, the base: Ba(OH)2. Molarity is 0.5 M, volume 0.2 L. Moles = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 moles. Each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH- ions. So OH- is 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles.

Wait, so we have 0.28 moles H+ and 0.2 moles OH-.

The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH- → H2O. So the limiting reagent here is OH-, because there's only 0.2 moles of OH- but 0.28 moles of H+.

So the OH- will completely react, and some H+ will be left. The amount of H+ that reacts is 0.2 moles, leaving 0.08 moles unreacted.

But wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of H+ or OH-? I think it's typically per mole of H+ reacting. Oh, but wait the enthalpy of neutralization is usually given as the heat released when one mole of H+ reacts with one mole of OH-.

Wait, but neutralization enthalpy is often calculated based on the strong acid and strong base reacting. So for each mole of H+ reacting, the enthalpy change is about -57 kJ/mol, I think. Or wait, was it -57 or -80? Wait, no, I remember that the standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (since each mole of H+ neutralizes with a mole of OH-). Or wait, another thought: Maybe it's per mole of acid or base? Let me think. For example, when 1 mole HCl reacts with 1 mole NaOH, the enthalpy change is about -57 kJ. So per mole of acid or base, it's -57 kJ. But for H2SO4, since it's diprotic, each mole would contribute 2 moles of H+.

So in this problem, the reaction will involve 0.2 moles of H+ reacting with 0.2 moles of OH-. So the total enthalpy change would be 0.2 moles * (-57 kJ/mol) = -11.4 kJ. But wait, the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the options again.

Options are: A: -2.72 kcal, B: -11.42 kcal, C: -3.80 kcal, D: -16.0 kJ.

Wait, oh wait, I think I might have gotten the units wrong. Because sometimes enthalpy is given in kcal/mol. 1 kcal is about 4.184 kJ. So 57 kJ is approximately 13.6 kcal, because 57 / 4.184 is about 13.6. Wait, wait, maybe I should calculate it.

Wait, 1 cal is 4.184 J, so 1 kcal is 4184 J. So 57,000 J (57 kJ) is 57,000 / 4184 ≈ 13.6 kcal. So the enthalpy per mole is about -13.6 kcal per mole.

Wait, but that's per mole of H+ reacting. So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ react, so the total enthalpy is 0.2 * (-13.6) = -2.72 kcal. Hmm, that's option A.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me make sure. Because H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, each mole contributes two H+ ions. So when it's neutralized, each mole gives 2 H+ which react. But in the problem, H2SO4 is 0.09 moles, but only 0.2 moles of H+ are needed because of the OH-.

Wait, the initial H+ from HCl is 0.1 moles and H2SO4 gives 0.18 moles, totaling 0.28. The OH- is 0.2. So after neutralization, 0.28 -0.2=0.08 H+ left.

But the enthalpy is based on the amount that actually reacts. So 0.2 moles of H+ reacting. Each mole of H+ releases about 13.6 kcal (since 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal) of energy, so 0.2 *13.6 = 2.72. So the enthalpy is -2.72 kcal. So the answer is A.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option A is -2.72 kcal. So that would be the correct answer.

But wait, I have a confusion here. Because sometimes the enthalpy of neutralization is given per mole of acid, not per mole of H+. For example, HCl is a monoprotic acid, so 1 mole HCl → 1 mole H+. H2SO4 is diprotic, so 1 mole → 2 H+. So when you do the neutralization, each mole of H2SO4 would release 2 * 57 kJ. Wait, but that's assuming they react completely. But in our problem, we have limited OH-, so only part of the H+ reacts.

Hmm, maybe another approach: calculate the moles of H+ and OH- available, and find out which is the limiting reagent.

So, H+ total: 0.28 moles.

OH- total: 0.2 moles.

So OH- is the limiting reagent. So 0.2 moles of H+ will react, each releasing 57 kJ per mole H+.

Wait, but 57 kJ per mole H+ is the value. So 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ. But wait, the options have a -11.42 kcal. Wait, so 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (since 11.4 /4.184 ≈ 2.72). Oh wait, no, because 11.4 kJ is 11400 J, which is 11400 / 4184 ≈ 2.72 kcal.

So 0.2 moles H+ neutralized would release 2.72 kcal. So the answer is A) -2.72 kcal.

But wait, why is option B) -11.42 kcal? Let me think again. If we calculate in kJ and then convert to kcal, for 0.2 moles H+.

Each mole H+ gives 57 kJ, so 0.2 *57 =11.4 kJ. 11.4 kJ is 11400 J. To convert to kcal, divide by 4184 J/kcal. 11400 /4184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy is -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer is A.

Another thought: Wait, maybe I made a mistake about the enthalpy value. What's the standard enthalpy of neutralization? I think it's about -57 kJ per mole of H+ (for strong acids and strong bases). So for each mole of H+ reacting, it's -57 kJ. So 0.2 moles → 0.2 *57 =11.4 kJ, which is about -2.72 kcal.

So the answer is A.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate moles of H⁺ from acids:**
   - **HCl (monoprotic):**  
     Moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since HCl is monoprotic, moles of H⁺ = 0.1 moles.  
   - **H₂SO₄ (diprotic):**  
     Moles of H₂SO₄ = \( 0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L} = 0.09 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since H₂SO₄ is diprotic, moles of H⁺ = \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{moles} \).  
   - **Total H⁺ from acids:**  
     \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{moles} \).

2. **Calculate moles of OH⁻ from base:**
   - **Ba(OH)₂ (strong base):**  
     Moles of Ba(OH)₂ = \( 0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{moles} \).  
     Since Ba(OH)₂ provides 2 OH⁻ ions per formula unit, moles of OH⁻ = \( 0.1 \times 2 = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \).

3. **Determine the limiting reagent:**
   - The reaction is \( \text{H⁺} + \text{OH⁻} \to \text{H₂O} \).  
   - Total H⁺ available = 0.28 moles, and total OH⁻ available = 0.2 moles.  
   - OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, as it will completely react with 0.2 moles of H⁺, leaving \( 0.28 - 0.2 = 0.08 \, \text{moles of H⁺ unreacted} \).

4. **Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization:**
   - The standard enthalpy of neutralization for strong acids and strong bases is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of H⁺.  
   - Since 0.2 moles of H⁺ react, the total enthalpy change is:  
     \[
     \Delta H = 0.2 \, \text{moles} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
     \]
   - Convert \( -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \) to kcal:  
     \[
     -11.4 \, \text{kJ} \div 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} \approx -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The enthalpy of neutralization is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), corresponding to option A.
