Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound that has 8 carbon atoms in total. Oh wait, and there are specific peaks in the FTIR indicating a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, right? And it's a 6-membered ring, so benzene is 6 carbons. But the total is 8 carbons. So two substituents must account for 2 more carbons. Because 6 (from benzene) plus 2 (substituents) equals 8.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the substituents can be more complicated. Oh, wait, no, because the total is 8 carbons. Benzene is 6, so substituents add 2. So each substituent must be a single carbon? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other none? No, because it's di-substituted, so two substituents. So each substituent is a single carbon, perhaps.

But wait, the substituents could be groups with more carbons. Like, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to something else. Oh right, the IR has a carbonyl peak, so probably a ketone or an aldehyde group. Also, there's an aromatic-halogen bond, so one substituent is a halogen, like Cl, Br, maybe I.

Wait, the IR shows a carbonyl group, so that's probably a ketone or aldehyde. And a halogen on the ring (aromatic-halogen bond) so one substituent is a halogen. So, the two substituents are a halogen (like Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group, like a ketone (maybe as a substituent like -COCH3?), but wait, let's think.

Wait, the compound has 8 carbons. Benzene (6 carbons) plus two substituents. Let's say one substituent is a halogen, which doesn't add any carbons. The other substituent must add two carbons. Oh wait, no. Wait, if one substituent is a halogen (which is one atom, no carbons), then the other substituent must contribute two carbons. So that means the substituent is a group with two carbons, like maybe a ketone group attached to a CH2 group or something.

Wait, wait. Let me think of possible structures. The ring is six-membered, aromatic, di-substituted. So substituents are at positions that could be para, meta, or ortho. But for NMR, the arrangement would affect the splitting and the chemical shifts.

So the substituents are a halogen (say, Cl) and a carbonyl group. For a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a ketone. So maybe something like a benzoyl chloride? No, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent like a -COCH3 group (an acetyl group) and a Cl.

Wait, let's consider the structure. If the ring has two substituents: one Cl and one COCH3. So the ring would be 6 carbons, plus COCH3 (which is 2 carbons in the substituent) and Cl (0 carbons). So 6 + 2 = 8, which fits. So that's a possible structure.

So the substituents would be Cl and COCH3. Now, where are they positioned? If they're in the para positions, that would lead to certain symmetry in NMR. Or perhaps meta.

Wait, but let me think about the NMR options. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s).

Hmm, 9.9 ppm is a strong singlet. That might be an aldehyde proton, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, in aromatic compounds, if there's a substituent with an aldehyde, that would fit. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic proton in a very deshielded environment, like adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. But then, the others are at 7.8 and 7.6, which could be aromatic protons.

Option B: 4.8 and 4.6 ppm (each 2H, d), and 1.3 (3H, s). These look like groups with adjacent CH2 groups, maybe an ester or a ketone with a CH2O structure. Maybe like a methylene next to oxygen. But not sure. Not seeing any aromatic protons here, but that can't be because the compound is aromatic. So maybe option B isn't the right answer.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The 2.3 ppm is a singlet, maybe a methyl group attached to something de-shielded, like a ketone (as in COCH3). The aromatic protons at 7.8 and 7.6 as doublets. So perhaps the substituents are in para positions. For example, a Cl and a COCH3 group in para positions.

Wait, if the substituents are para, then the aromatic protons might be split into two doublets. Let me think. In a para-disubstituted benzene, the protons are typically two doublets (each 2H), but sometimes as a singlet if the substituents are symmetrical. Hmm, but wait, in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other, so perhaps the ring has two substituents, Cl and COCH3, in para positions. Then the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets, each two H. So that matches option C.

Wait, but the substituents are Cl and COCH3. So the ring would have substituents at para positions. So the aromatic protons would be two pairs of doublets. That's what option C shows: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). So that fits.

Wait, but wait. In para substitution, sometimes the coupling can lead to a triplet or a doublet, depending on the substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the meta positions, but I think in that case, the H would be as a triplet or a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are ortho, but in that case, the aromatic protons would integrate differently.

So option C shows aromatic protons as 2H and 2H, each as doublets. That suggests that the substituents are in a way that leads to two sets of two equivalent protons.

Wait, but wait a second. If the substituents are para, then the ring would have four equivalent H's, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are meta, leading to two doublets.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. When benzene has two substituents in para positions, the ring is symmetrical. So the H's adjacent to substituents are equivalent. So for each substituent, the adjacent H's would be equivalent. So for example, if substituents are Cl and COCH3 in para, then the H's next to Cl would be one set, and the H's next to COCH3 would be another set.

Wait, but if the substituents are in para, then each substituent is opposite each other. So the ring would have H's in positions 2 and 6 (next to Cl) and positions 3 and 5 (next to COCH3?), but wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to imagine the structure.

Let's say the benzene ring has Cl at position 1 and COCH3 at position 3. No, that would be meta. Alternatively, Cl at position 1 and COCH3 at position 4, making them para.

Wait, but in para positions, the substituents are opposite each other. So the ring would be symmetric. The H's ortho to Cl would be in positions 2 and 6, and ortho to COCH3 would be in positions 3 and 5. So each pair would be equivalent.

So the H at position 2 would be next to Cl and would have certain coupling. Similarly, position 3 would be next to COCH3. So the H's at 2 and 6 (ortho to Cl) would be one set, and those at 3 and 5 (ortho to COCH3) would be another set.

So their chemical shifts would differ because the substituents are different.

In that case, the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that's what option C shows: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). The singlet at 2.3 ppm would be the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (COCH3).

So option C's data would fit a para-substituted benzene with Cl and COCH3.

But wait, what about the other substituents? Let me make sure. The total carbons: benzene is 6, plus the COCH3 group adds 2 more (the carbonyl is C=O, and the methyl is CH3). So 6+2=8. Correct.

Now, the FTIR: a carbonyl peak, which would be around 1700-1800 cm^-1 for a ketone. And an aromatic-halogen bond (like C-Cl stretch around 600 cm^-1). That makes sense.

So for the NMR, option C's aromatic protons are in two doublets, which fits the para substitution. The methyl at 2.3 ppm is a singlet, which fits the COCH3 group.

But wait, let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s). That's a strong singlet. Could that be an aldehyde group? If so, then the substituents would be an aldehyde and a halogen. But if the substituents are Cl and CHO, then the structure would be something like 4-chlorobenzaldehyde. But wait, benzaldehyde has a formula of C7H6O. But our compound has 8 carbons. So maybe it's 4-chlorobenzaldehyde with another substituent? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the benzene. If one is Cl and the other is CHO, that's two substituents. So 6 (benzene) + CHO (1 C) + Cl (0). But that would only add one C, so total 7 C. But the compound has 8 C. Therefore, option A can't be correct because the substituents only add one C, not two. So option A is out.

Option B: 4.8 and 4.6 ppm as doublets, and 1.3 as a singlet. These look like maybe a diastereotopic CH2 groups. Like, perhaps a CH2OCH2CH3 or something. But where are the aromatic protons? The option doesn't show any aromatic peaks. So perhaps this isn't the correct option because the compound is aromatic, so there should be aromatic protons.

Option D: 6.9 ppm (1H, s), 4.8 and 4.6 ppm (each 2H, d), and 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 is an aromatic proton, but the other signals might belong to an ethylene group or something. But again, the aromatic protons would have more, unless it's a mono-substituted ring. But the compound is di-substituted, so more than one H should appear. Maybe this structure is something else, perhaps with a substituent that's a ketone or ether, but not involving a carbonyl attached to the ring.

So, going back, option C seems correct. The substituents are Cl and COCH3 in para positions. The NMR shows two doublets for the aromatic protons, and a singlet for the methyl group attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, but wait another thing. When a ring is para-substituted with a strong de-shielding group like Cl and a COCH3 (which is also de-shielding), the aromatic protons adjacent to Cl would be more deshielded than those adjacent to COCH3. So the H adjacent to Cl would be at a higher ppm than those adjacent to COCH3.

Wait, Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, which would deshield the adjacent protons, causing them to appear downfield. Similarly, the COCH3 group is also electron-withdrawing, so the adjacent H's would also be deshielded but perhaps not as much as Cl.

So in the NMR, the H's next to Cl would appear at higher ppm (like 7.8) and those next to COCH3 at lower ppm (like 7.6). That makes sense. So option C's data would fit that.

Therefore, the correct NMR is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons, so the two substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond, suggesting the substituents are a halogen (e.g., Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., COCH3). This makes the structure likely to be a para-substituted benzene with Cl and COCH3 groups.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: The NMR shows a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which could correspond to an aldehyde proton. However, the total number of carbons in this structure would be 7 (6 from benzene, 1 from the aldehyde group, and 0 from Cl), which does not match the compound's total of 8 carbons. Thus, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: The NMR signals at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm suggest methylene groups adjacent to oxygen, and the singlet at 1.3 ppm could be a methyl group. However, there are no aromatic proton signals in this option, which contradicts the compound's aromatic nature. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

3. **Option C**: The NMR shows two doublets at 7.8 ppm (2H) and 7.6 ppm (2H), consistent with aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. The singlet at 2.3 ppm corresponds to a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (COCH3). This matches the expected structure of a para-substituted benzene with Cl and COCH3 groups, accounting for all 8 carbons. This option is correct.

4. **Option D**: The NMR includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm (1H), which could correspond to an aromatic proton, and signals at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm for methylene groups. However, the total number of aromatic protons does not align with a di-substituted benzene ring, and the signals do not match the expected pattern for the compound. Thus, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct NMR data corresponds to a para-substituted benzene ring with Cl and COCH3 groups, as described in **Option C**.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about identifying the correct 1H NMR spectrum for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound that has 8 carbon atoms in total. Oh wait, and there are specific peaks in the FTIR indicating a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond.

Wait, wait. Let me think. The compound is a di-substituted benzene ring, right? And it's a 6-membered ring, so benzene is 6 carbons. But the total is 8 carbons. So two substituents must account for 2 more carbons. Because 6 (from benzene) plus 2 (substituents) equals 8.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the substituents can be more complicated. Oh, wait, no, because the total is 8 carbons. Benzene is 6, so substituents add 2. So each substituent must be a single carbon? Or maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other none? No, because it's di-substituted, so two substituents. So each substituent is a single carbon, perhaps.

But wait, the substituents could be groups with more carbons. Like, maybe one substituent is a carbonyl group attached to something else. Oh right, the IR has a carbonyl peak, so probably a ketone or an aldehyde group. Also, there's an aromatic-halogen bond, so one substituent is a halogen, like Cl, Br, maybe I.

Wait, the IR shows a carbonyl group, so that's probably a ketone or aldehyde. And a halogen on the ring (aromatic-halogen bond) so one substituent is a halogen. So, the two substituents are a halogen (like Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group, like a ketone (maybe as a substituent like -COCH3?), but wait, let's think.

Wait, the compound has 8 carbons. Benzene (6 carbons) plus two substituents. Let's say one substituent is a halogen, which doesn't add any carbons. The other substituent must add two carbons. Oh wait, no. Wait, if one substituent is a halogen (which is one atom, no carbons), then the other substituent must contribute two carbons. So that means the substituent is a group with two carbons, like maybe a ketone group attached to a CH2 group or something.

Wait, wait. Let me think of possible structures. The ring is six-membered, aromatic, di-substituted. So substituents are at positions that could be para, meta, or ortho. But for NMR, the arrangement would affect the splitting and the chemical shifts.

So the substituents are a halogen (say, Cl) and a carbonyl group. For a carbonyl group, perhaps it's a ketone. So maybe something like a benzoyl chloride? No, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's a substituent like a -COCH3 group (an acetyl group) and a Cl.

Wait, let's consider the structure. If the ring has two substituents: one Cl and one COCH3. So the ring would be 6 carbons, plus COCH3 (which is 2 carbons in the substituent) and Cl (0 carbons). So 6 + 2 = 8, which fits. So that's a possible structure.

So the substituents would be Cl and COCH3. Now, where are they positioned? If they're in the para positions, that would lead to certain symmetry in NMR. Or perhaps meta.

Wait, but let me think about the NMR options. Let's look at the options:

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s).

Hmm, 9.9 ppm is a strong singlet. That might be an aldehyde proton, but aldehyde protons are usually around 9-10 ppm. But wait, in aromatic compounds, if there's a substituent with an aldehyde, that would fit. Alternatively, maybe an aromatic proton in a very deshielded environment, like adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. But then, the others are at 7.8 and 7.6, which could be aromatic protons.

Option B: 4.8 and 4.6 ppm (each 2H, d), and 1.3 (3H, s). These look like groups with adjacent CH2 groups, maybe an ester or a ketone with a CH2O structure. Maybe like a methylene next to oxygen. But not sure. Not seeing any aromatic protons here, but that can't be because the compound is aromatic. So maybe option B isn't the right answer.

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). The 2.3 ppm is a singlet, maybe a methyl group attached to something de-shielded, like a ketone (as in COCH3). The aromatic protons at 7.8 and 7.6 as doublets. So perhaps the substituents are in para positions. For example, a Cl and a COCH3 group in para positions.

Wait, if the substituents are para, then the aromatic protons might be split into two doublets. Let me think. In a para-disubstituted benzene, the protons are typically two doublets (each 2H), but sometimes as a singlet if the substituents are symmetrical. Hmm, but wait, in para substitution, each substituent is opposite each other, so perhaps the ring has two substituents, Cl and COCH3, in para positions. Then the aromatic protons would be in two sets of doublets, each two H. So that matches option C.

Wait, but the substituents are Cl and COCH3. So the ring would have substituents at para positions. So the aromatic protons would be two pairs of doublets. That's what option C shows: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). So that fits.

Wait, but wait. In para substitution, sometimes the coupling can lead to a triplet or a doublet, depending on the substituents. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are in the meta positions, but I think in that case, the H would be as a triplet or a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are ortho, but in that case, the aromatic protons would integrate differently.

So option C shows aromatic protons as 2H and 2H, each as doublets. That suggests that the substituents are in a way that leads to two sets of two equivalent protons.

Wait, but wait a second. If the substituents are para, then the ring would have four equivalent H's, perhaps. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are meta, leading to two doublets.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. When benzene has two substituents in para positions, the ring is symmetrical. So the H's adjacent to substituents are equivalent. So for each substituent, the adjacent H's would be equivalent. So for example, if substituents are Cl and COCH3 in para, then the H's next to Cl would be one set, and the H's next to COCH3 would be another set.

Wait, but if the substituents are in para, then each substituent is opposite each other. So the ring would have H's in positions 2 and 6 (next to Cl) and positions 3 and 5 (next to COCH3?), but wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to imagine the structure.

Let's say the benzene ring has Cl at position 1 and COCH3 at position 3. No, that would be meta. Alternatively, Cl at position 1 and COCH3 at position 4, making them para.

Wait, but in para positions, the substituents are opposite each other. So the ring would be symmetric. The H's ortho to Cl would be in positions 2 and 6, and ortho to COCH3 would be in positions 3 and 5. So each pair would be equivalent.

So the H at position 2 would be next to Cl and would have certain coupling. Similarly, position 3 would be next to COCH3. So the H's at 2 and 6 (ortho to Cl) would be one set, and those at 3 and 5 (ortho to COCH3) would be another set.

So their chemical shifts would differ because the substituents are different.

In that case, the NMR would show two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that's what option C shows: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). The singlet at 2.3 ppm would be the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (COCH3).

So option C's data would fit a para-substituted benzene with Cl and COCH3.

But wait, what about the other substituents? Let me make sure. The total carbons: benzene is 6, plus the COCH3 group adds 2 more (the carbonyl is C=O, and the methyl is CH3). So 6+2=8. Correct.

Now, the FTIR: a carbonyl peak, which would be around 1700-1800 cm^-1 for a ketone. And an aromatic-halogen bond (like C-Cl stretch around 600 cm^-1). That makes sense.

So for the NMR, option C's aromatic protons are in two doublets, which fits the para substitution. The methyl at 2.3 ppm is a singlet, which fits the COCH3 group.

But wait, let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s). That's a strong singlet. Could that be an aldehyde group? If so, then the substituents would be an aldehyde and a halogen. But if the substituents are Cl and CHO, then the structure would be something like 4-chlorobenzaldehyde. But wait, benzaldehyde has a formula of C7H6O. But our compound has 8 carbons. So maybe it's 4-chlorobenzaldehyde with another substituent? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the compound is di-substituted, so two substituents on the benzene. If one is Cl and the other is CHO, that's two substituents. So 6 (benzene) + CHO (1 C) + Cl (0). But that would only add one C, so total 7 C. But the compound has 8 C. Therefore, option A can't be correct because the substituents only add one C, not two. So option A is out.

Option B: 4.8 and 4.6 ppm as doublets, and 1.3 as a singlet. These look like maybe a diastereotopic CH2 groups. Like, perhaps a CH2OCH2CH3 or something. But where are the aromatic protons? The option doesn't show any aromatic peaks. So perhaps this isn't the correct option because the compound is aromatic, so there should be aromatic protons.

Option D: 6.9 ppm (1H, s), 4.8 and 4.6 ppm (each 2H, d), and 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 is an aromatic proton, but the other signals might belong to an ethylene group or something. But again, the aromatic protons would have more, unless it's a mono-substituted ring. But the compound is di-substituted, so more than one H should appear. Maybe this structure is something else, perhaps with a substituent that's a ketone or ether, but not involving a carbonyl attached to the ring.

So, going back, option C seems correct. The substituents are Cl and COCH3 in para positions. The NMR shows two doublets for the aromatic protons, and a singlet for the methyl group attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, but wait another thing. When a ring is para-substituted with a strong de-shielding group like Cl and a COCH3 (which is also de-shielding), the aromatic protons adjacent to Cl would be more deshielded than those adjacent to COCH3. So the H adjacent to Cl would be at a higher ppm than those adjacent to COCH3.

Wait, Cl is an electron-withdrawing group, which would deshield the adjacent protons, causing them to appear downfield. Similarly, the COCH3 group is also electron-withdrawing, so the adjacent H's would also be deshielded but perhaps not as much as Cl.

So in the NMR, the H's next to Cl would appear at higher ppm (like 7.8) and those next to COCH3 at lower ppm (like 7.6). That makes sense. So option C's data would fit that.

Therefore, the correct NMR is option C.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons, so the two substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond, suggesting the substituents are a halogen (e.g., Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., COCH3). This makes the structure likely to be a para-substituted benzene with Cl and COCH3 groups.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: The NMR shows a singlet at 9.9 ppm, which could correspond to an aldehyde proton. However, the total number of carbons in this structure would be 7 (6 from benzene, 1 from the aldehyde group, and 0 from Cl), which does not match the compound's total of 8 carbons. Thus, this option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: The NMR signals at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm suggest methylene groups adjacent to oxygen, and the singlet at 1.3 ppm could be a methyl group. However, there are no aromatic proton signals in this option, which contradicts the compound's aromatic nature. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

3. **Option C**: The NMR shows two doublets at 7.8 ppm (2H) and 7.6 ppm (2H), consistent with aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. The singlet at 2.3 ppm corresponds to a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (COCH3). This matches the expected structure of a para-substituted benzene with Cl and COCH3 groups, accounting for all 8 carbons. This option is correct.

4. **Option D**: The NMR includes a singlet at 6.9 ppm (1H), which could correspond to an aromatic proton, and signals at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm for methylene groups. However, the total number of aromatic protons does not align with a di-substituted benzene ring, and the signals do not match the expected pattern for the compound. Thus, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The correct NMR data corresponds to a para-substituted benzene ring with Cl and COCH3 groups, as described in **Option C**.
