Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that the state of a system at time t is given by a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, I think in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually represented as column vectors, and they should be normalized, meaning their length (or norm) should be 1. But let me check that.

So the state vector is a column vector with components [-1, 2, 1]. To find its norm, I should calculate the square root of the sum of the squares of each component. That would be sqrt((-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). Oh, right, so the state isn't normalized yet. Because in quantum mechanics, the state vector must have a norm of 1. So maybe the given vector isn't the actual state but just the components, and I need to normalize it before proceeding.

Wait, the question asks about an observable P, and we need to find the probability of measuring 0. So I think the process involves finding the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0, then projecting the state vector onto those eigenvectors, and the sum of the squares of the absolute values of those projections gives the probability.

But first, let's get the state vector. The given vector is [-1, 2, 1]. The norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]. I'll have to keep that in mind because all quantum states are supposed to be normalized for probabilities to add up to 1.

Next, the observable P is given as a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So P looks like this:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Wait, no, the way it's written, the third row starts with 0, then 1/√2, then 0. So the matrix is:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Now, to find the probability that a measurement yields 0, we need to find all the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. The probability is the sum of the squares of the projections of the state onto each of these eigenvectors.

So the first step is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Since P is a 3x3 matrix, this might take some time. Let me try to find its eigenvalues.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and λ represents the eigenvalues.

So, P - λI is:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]

[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]

[ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]

Calculating the determinant of this matrix:

|P - λI| = -λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 [ ... ]

Wait, maybe expanding along the first row. The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 [ something ]

So:

-λ [ λ² - (1/2) ] - (1/√2) [ (-λ/√2 ) ] 

Simplifying:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + (1/√2)(λ/√2 )

Which is:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2 )

So, -λ³ + λ.

So the characteristic equation is -λ³ + λ = 0. Let's factor this:

λ (-λ² + 1) = 0 → λ (1 - λ²) = 0 → So eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. So when the question asks for the probability of getting 0, we're looking for the eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0.

Now, let's find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We need to solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the system is:

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0.

(1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v3 = -v1.

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → again, v2=0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 must satisfy v2=0 and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvectors are any scalar multiples of the vector [1, 0, -1], because if v1=1, v3=-1, and v2=0.

Wait, let me check the equations again. The first equation is (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0. The third equation is (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0. The second equation is (1/√2)(v1 + v3)=0 → v1 + v3=0 → v3= -v1.

So the solution is any vector where v2=0 and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvectors are all vectors of the form [a, 0, -a] where a is a scalar. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by [1, 0, -1].

So the eigenvalue 0 has a one-dimensional eigenspace with eigenvector [1, 0, -1].

Wait, but let me check. Let me plug in the vector [1, 0, -1] into P to see if it's indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

P * [1, 0, -1]^T = first component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.

Second component: (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1) = (1/√2 - 1/√2) = 0.

Third component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.

So yes, P multiplied by [1,0,-1] gives the zero vector, so it's indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

Now, to find the probability of measuring 0, I need to find the projection of the state vector onto this eigenvector. But wait, the state vector is given as [-1, 2, 1], but it's not normalized. Let me normalize it first.

The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ].

The eigenvector for 0 is [1, 0, -1], but to find the projection, I can take the inner product of the state with this eigenvector and then square its magnitude.

Wait, but wait: the eigenvector isn't normalized yet. Because [1, 0, -1] has a norm of sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So to make it a unit vector, I should divide by sqrt(2), giving (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1 ].

So the projection is the inner product of the state vector and the unit eigenvector.

Let me write the steps:

The state vector is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].

The unit eigenvector for λ=0 is |v> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1 ].

The inner product <v|ψ> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1 ] • (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].

Which equals (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) * [ (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) ].

Calculating the numerator: (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.

So <v|ψ> = (-2)/(sqrt(12)).

Wait, sqrt(2)*sqrt(6) is sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3). So sqrt(12) = 2√3.

So (-2)/(2√3) ) = (-1)/√3.

The probability is |<v|ψ>|² = [ (-1)/√3 ]² = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3. Looking at the options, option C is 1/3. So the answer should be C.

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, because the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so the probability is just the square of the amplitude. But wait, in quantum mechanics, when you have multiple eigenstates for the same eigenvalue, you have to sum the squares of each component. Here, since there's only one eigenvector, that's the only term. So yes, 1/3 is correct.

So the correct answer is C) 1/3.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The state of the system is given as the column vector \( \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), but it is not normalized. The norm is calculated as:

\[
\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4 + 1} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix} 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\ 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ 
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the probability of measuring 0, we need the eigenvectors of \( P \) corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. Solving \( P \mathbf{v} = 0 \), the eigenvectors are of the form \( \mathbf{v} = a \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \), where \( a \) is a scalar. The normalized eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring 0 is the square of the projection of \( |\psi\rangle \) onto \( |v\rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Calculating the dot product:

\[
\langle v | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{6}} \left( (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) \right) = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
|\langle v | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

Next, the observable P is given as a 3x3 matrix. The first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. So P looks like this:

Row 1: 0, 1/√2, 0

Row 2: 1/√2, 0, 1/√2

Row 3: 0, 1/√2, 0

Wait, no, the way it's written, the third row starts with 0, then 1/√2, then 0. So the matrix is:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Now, to find the probability that a measurement yields 0, we need to find all the eigenvectors of P corresponding to the eigenvalue 0. The probability is the sum of the squares of the projections of the state onto each of these eigenvectors.

So the first step is to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P. Since P is a 3x3 matrix, this might take some time. Let me try to find its eigenvalues.

The characteristic equation is det(P - λI) = 0, where I is the identity matrix and λ represents the eigenvalues.

So, P - λI is:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]

[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]

[ 0, 1/√2, -λ ]

Calculating the determinant of this matrix:

|P - λI| = -λ [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 [ ... ]

Wait, maybe expanding along the first row. The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 [ something ]

So:

-λ [ λ² - (1/2) ] - (1/√2) [ (-λ/√2 ) ] 

Simplifying:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + (1/√2)(λ/√2 )

Which is:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2 )

So, -λ³ + λ.

So the characteristic equation is -λ³ + λ = 0. Let's factor this:

λ (-λ² + 1) = 0 → λ (1 - λ²) = 0 → So eigenvalues are λ = 0, λ = 1, λ = -1.

So the eigenvalues are 0, 1, and -1. So when the question asks for the probability of getting 0, we're looking for the eigenvectors corresponding to λ=0.

Now, let's find the eigenvectors for λ=0.

We need to solve (P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the system is:

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0.

(1/√2) v1 + 0*v2 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → (1/√2)(v1 + v3) = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v3 = -v1.

0*v1 + (1/√2) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → again, v2=0.

So the eigenvectors for λ=0 must satisfy v2=0 and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvectors are any scalar multiples of the vector [1, 0, -1], because if v1=1, v3=-1, and v2=0.

Wait, let me check the equations again. The first equation is (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0. The third equation is (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2=0. The second equation is (1/√2)(v1 + v3)=0 → v1 + v3=0 → v3= -v1.

So the solution is any vector where v2=0 and v3 = -v1. So the eigenvectors are all vectors of the form [a, 0, -a] where a is a scalar. So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by [1, 0, -1].

So the eigenvalue 0 has a one-dimensional eigenspace with eigenvector [1, 0, -1].

Wait, but let me check. Let me plug in the vector [1, 0, -1] into P to see if it's indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

P * [1, 0, -1]^T = first component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.

Second component: (1/√2)*1 + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(-1) = (1/√2 - 1/√2) = 0.

Third component: 0*1 + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(-1) = 0.

So yes, P multiplied by [1,0,-1] gives the zero vector, so it's indeed an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

Now, to find the probability of measuring 0, I need to find the projection of the state vector onto this eigenvector. But wait, the state vector is given as [-1, 2, 1], but it's not normalized. Let me normalize it first.

The norm is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 ) = sqrt(1 +4 +1) = sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ].

The eigenvector for 0 is [1, 0, -1], but to find the projection, I can take the inner product of the state with this eigenvector and then square its magnitude.

Wait, but wait: the eigenvector isn't normalized yet. Because [1, 0, -1] has a norm of sqrt(1^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(2). So to make it a unit vector, I should divide by sqrt(2), giving (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1 ].

So the projection is the inner product of the state vector and the unit eigenvector.

Let me write the steps:

The state vector is |ψ> = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].

The unit eigenvector for λ=0 is |v> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1 ].

The inner product <v|ψ> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1 ] • (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ].

Which equals (1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6))) * [ (1)(-1) + (0)(2) + (-1)(1) ].

Calculating the numerator: (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.

So <v|ψ> = (-2)/(sqrt(12)).

Wait, sqrt(2)*sqrt(6) is sqrt(12) = 2*sqrt(3). So sqrt(12) = 2√3.

So (-2)/(2√3) ) = (-1)/√3.

The probability is |<v|ψ>|² = [ (-1)/√3 ]² = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3. Looking at the options, option C is 1/3. So the answer should be C.

Wait, wait a minute. Wait, because the eigenspace is one-dimensional, so the probability is just the square of the amplitude. But wait, in quantum mechanics, when you have multiple eigenstates for the same eigenvalue, you have to sum the squares of each component. Here, since there's only one eigenvector, that's the only term. So yes, 1/3 is correct.

So the correct answer is C) 1/3.

\]

The probability is:

\[
|\langle v | \psi \rangle|^2 = \left( \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.

Thus, the probability of measuring 0 is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
