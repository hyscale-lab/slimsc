Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents on unknown compounds A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. Wait, no, let me check again. Oh right, A was treated with LiBH4 and H+, producing (R) product, and B was treated with BH3 and H+, giving the (S) product.

Hmm, I remember that LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents, but maybe they work differently. Oh wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used for ketones, aldehydes, esters, maybe even amides. BH3 is also used in reductions, but I think BH3 (with things like THF as a catalyst) is used in hydroboration reactions, which are about adding boron to alkenes in a specific way.

Wait, wait, no. No, wait. I'm mixing up things. Actually, BH3 is often used in the formation of alcohols from alkenes through hydroboration-oxidation. But when it comes to reducing carbonyl groups, perhaps LiBH4 is stronger. Or is there a difference in how they reduce carbonyl groups? Let me think. Oh, wait, I think BH3 isn't typically used for reducing ketones. Oh wait, wait a second. Alternatively, maybe this is about the types of carbonyl groups being reduced.

Wait, but wait, the product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one. That's a cyclic ether, like a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is an ester or a ketone that, when reduced, forms this structure. Let me think: tetrahydropyran-2-one would have a ring structure with an oxygen, like an ether, and a ketone group.

So the product is a five-membered ring? Wait, no. Wait, tetrahydropyran is a six-membered ring, right? Because pyran is a six-membered oxygen-containing ring, similar to pyrone, which is a lactone. So, 4-ethyl... so the ethyl is at position 4, and the ketone is at position 2.

So, the product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one, which suggests that the starting material for each reaction must have been a carbonyl group connected in such a way that upon reduction, it forms the ring structure.

Wait, but wait, what's the role of the reducing agents here? LiBH4 is used to reduce carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes) to alcohols. Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the product is a ketone, so maybe the starting material was something else that gets converted into a ketone. Or perhaps the starting material had an ester group which, upon reduction, becomes a secondary alcohol, but that doesn't fit with the product being a ketone.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's think again. The product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic structure, so perhaps the starting material was a cyclic ester (like a lactone) or a cyclic ketone, but that doesn't seem right because LiBH4 would reduce a ketone to a secondary alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the starting material was an epoxide? No, LiBH4 isn't typically used for epoxide ring opening. Alternatively, maybe the starting material was a cyclic ether with a ketone, but that seems unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the reaction conditions. The first reaction uses LiBH4 and H+ (probably an acid workup). The second uses BH3 and H+.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the reducing agents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent for carbonyl groups. BH3, perhaps in the presence of something like THF (a Lewis acid?), is used for hydroboration reactions, which aren't about reducing carbonyls but for adding boron across double bonds, then oxidizing to form alcohols. But wait, in this case, the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material had an ester or a nitrile or something else that gets reduced.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else that upon treatment becomes the ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters, and when reduced, form the cyclic structure.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the products. The product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one. So perhaps the starting material was a gamma-keto ester or something that, upon reduction, forms a cyclic hemiacetal or something else that closes into a ring.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's about the formation of a cyclic ether via a ketone. So, if the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, then upon reduction of the ester group, you get an alcohol that can form a ring.

Wait, let me think: if the starting material is an ester, like an acyloxy compound, then treatment with LiBH4 would reduce the ester to an alcohol. For example, if you have R-O-CO-O-R', LiBH4 would reduce the ester group (RCOOR') to RCH2-O-R'. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, a lactone. When reduced, it would open the ring. But that might not form a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options.

The options give A and B as (S) or (R) 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure is pentanoic acid with substituents at positions 3 and 5. At position 5, there's an isobutoxy (OCH(CH2CH3)2) and an oxo group (a ketone), and at position 3, an ethyl group.

So, the structure is:

CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)CO-O-isobutyl and a COOH group at the end?

Wait, no. Let me draw the structure.

Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. But here, it's 3-ethyl, which would be on the third carbon of the pentanoic chain. So numbering from the COOH end, the first carbon is COOH, second is CH2, third is CH(CH2CH3), fourth is CH2, fifth is CH3? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, but the substituents are on the third carbon. So, the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(O-something)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. The formula given is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So pentanoic acid has five carbons, with COOH on the first. So the structure is:

Carboxylic acid (carbon 1), then carbons 2, 3, 4, and 5.

At position 3 (carbon 3), there's an ethyl group. At position 5 (carbon 5), there's an isobutoxy (OCH(CH2CH3)2) and an oxo group (a ketone). So the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(OIsobutyl)-

Wait, but wait, carbon 5 can't have both isobutoxy and oxo groups. Oh, wait, no, the nomenclature is such that 5-isobutoxy-5-oxo would imply that on carbon 5, there are two substituents: an oxygen from isobutoxy and an oxo group (a ketone). Wait, but that would mean the same carbon has both an oxygen (as in OCH(CH2CH3)2) and a carbonyl group. That can't be right because a carbon can't have both an OCH2CH2CH3 group and a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Wait, perhaps 5-oxo is a carbonyl group, so the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-isobutyl.

Wait, but that's not possible because the pentanoic acid chain would have five carbons. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-O-CH(CH2CH3)2)-CH2- ?

Wait, maybe the structure is:

The five carbons are arranged as:

1: COOH

2: CH2

3: CH(CH2CH3)

4: C(O-)

5: O-isobutyl?

No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The carboxylic acid is at one end (C1), then C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH2CH3), C4 is C(O), and C5 is connected to the oxygen (O-isobutyl). But then, how does that form a five-carbon chain? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The main chain is five carbons, starting with the COOH. So:

COOH (C1) - CH2 (C2) - CH(CH2CH3) (C3) - C(O) (C4) - O-CH(CH2CH3)2 (C5).

But that's a five-carbon chain? Wait, but if C5 is the O-isobutyl group, that's not part of the main chain but a substituent on C4.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction. The product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one. So, the product is a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone at position 2.

So the starting material must have a structure that, upon reduction, forms this ring. How?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) that, when reduced, opens to form a diol, which then forms the ring upon dehydration? Hmm, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Gamma-keto esters can undergo various cyclizations. Wait, if you have a gamma-keto ester, like something with the structure RCOCH2COOR', then upon treatment with a reducing agent, the ester part gets reduced to an alcohol, but the ketone remains. But wait, in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, such as a gamma-lactone. When LiBH4 is used to reduce the ester group, it would open the ring and form an alcohol, but that would lead to a chain, not a ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone. But LiBH4 would reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol, not form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone attached. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach. If the product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one, which is a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone, perhaps the starting material is a diol or another structure that, when treated with a reducing agent, forms this ring.

Wait, but the reactions involve different reducing agents. Maybe the starting materials are enol ethers or something else where the reducing agents would act differently.

Alternatively, perhaps we're dealing with the reduction of an ester group to form an alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester with a structure that allows for ring formation upon reduction. So, when the ester is reduced, the oxygen becomes an alcohol, and the molecule cyclizes to form a six-membered ring, including the oxygen.

Wait, so for example, if the starting material is something like CH2CH2CH(OCH2CH2CH3)COOR, and when reduced, the ester group (COOR) becomes CH2OH. Then, the OH and the adjacent CH2 groups could form a ring.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a keto ester, which upon reduction forms a secondary alcohol that can form the ring structure.

Wait, let's think about the stereochemistry. The products are enantiomers: (R) and (S). So the starting materials must have been enantiomers as well, because the reducing agents may not change the configuration of any chiral centers except those involved in the reduction.

Wait, but wait. When you reduce a ketone to an alcohol using a reducing agent like LiBH4, the configuration of any existing chiral centers not involved in the reduction would remain the same. So if the starting material is a chiral compound, the product would retain that configuration, but the new chiral center (from the reduction) would have a specific configuration based on the reduction.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, which is a new structure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a carbonyl group that's part of a ring, and the reduction breaks the ring. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal that, upon treatment with a reducing agent, gets opened or modified to form the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, let me step back. The product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one, which is a cyclic ether with a ketone. So the starting material must have had a structure that, upon reduction, forms this ring.

Perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a ketone. No, because reducing an acetal would typically require acid conditions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters, and upon reduction, they form the ring structure. Wait, let's consider that. If the starting material is an ester where the oxygen is part of a ring, perhaps a lactone. Then, reducing the lactone would open it. For example, a gamma-lactone would, upon reduction, become a diol, but that's not forming a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. Beta-keto esters can undergo various condensations, but I'm not sure how that would form the ring in this case.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The options for A and B are (S) or (R) 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the structure is a pentanoic acid (five carbons) with an ethyl group on C3, an isobutoxy group and a ketone on C5.

Wait, but how does that lead to a six-membered ring upon reduction?

Ah, maybe because the starting material is an ester. Wait, the acid is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So if it's an acid, perhaps the starting material would have been the corresponding ester, but the options here are the acids.

Wait, but the reactions are treating A and B with LiBH4 and BH3, respectively. So if the starting material is a carboxylic acid, how would the reducing agents act?

Wait, LiBH4 typically doesn't reduce carboxylic acids; they are generally resistant to LiBH4. However, if the compound has another reducible group, like an ester or a ketone, LiBH4 would reduce that.

Looking at the structure, the starting material (the acid) has a 5-oxo group (a ketone) and an isobutoxy group (an ether). So, perhaps the ketone is being reduced.

Wait, if the starting material is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, then when treated with LiBH4, the ketone (5-oxo) would be reduced to a secondary alcohol. So the product would have an alcohol group at position 5, along with the isobutoxy group.

But wait, how would that form the cyclic structure? Let me think: the starting material is a pentanoic acid with substituents on C3 and C5.

Upon reduction of the ketone (C5), you get a secondary alcohol. So the structure becomes 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.

Wait, but that's a five-carbon chain with a hydroxyl and isobutoxy groups on C5. How does that form a six-membered ring?

Ah! Wait, perhaps the hydroxyl group on C5 can form a ring by losing water, connecting to another part of the molecule. For example, an intramolecular esterification or some kind of cyclization.

Wait, if the hydroxyl on C5 attacks the adjacent carbonyl or another position, perhaps forming a ring.

Wait, let me imagine the structure. The starting material after reduction has a hydroxyl on C5, which is adjacent to the isobutoxy group.

Wait, but the molecule is 5-isobutoxy-5-hydroxypentanoic acid. So, the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(OH)(OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxo-pentanoic acid. So, the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, no, the 5-oxo implies a ketone, so:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, no, that can't be right because the substituents on C5 would be the oxo group and the isobutoxy group. So, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, no, that would be a four-carbon chain, not five. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think again.

Pentanoic acid is five carbons, so:

Position 1: COOH.

Position 2: CH2.

Position 3: CH(CH2CH3).

Position 4: CH2.

Position 5: C(=O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2.

Wait, that would make it a five-carbon chain, but then the 5 position is a carbonyl group attached to an isobutoxy group. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2.

So, it's a pentanoic acid with a keto group on C5, which is an ester (since it's O-linked to isobutyl). So, the group is an acetoxy group? Or perhaps a lactone? No, because it's an ester.

Wait, but then, when LiBH4 is used, it would reduce the carbonyl group (the ketone) to an alcohol. So the product would be a secondary alcohol on C5.

Structure after reduction: COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH(OH)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2.

Wait, but how does that form a ring? Maybe the OH can attack the carbonyl group, but in this case, the carbonyl is already reduced. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one, which is a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone.

So perhaps the starting material is designed such that when the ketone is reduced, the molecule cyclizes to form the ring. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester that, upon reduction, forms a diol which then undergoes cyclization. Let me think: if the ester is at position 5, and when reduced, you get an alcohol, and perhaps another hydroxyl group elsewhere, allowing the formation of a ring via an elimination reaction.

Wait, maybe it's more about the stereochemistry of the reduction. The question is about which starting materials (A and B) would, upon treatment with different reducing agents, produce the R and S products.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that, upon reduction, forms the desired product. But I'm not sure how the reducing agents would affect that.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketal or acetal. But in that case, the reducing agents would open the ring.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the stereochemistry of the starting materials and the products.

The product from A is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. From B, it's (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

So the products are enantiomers. That suggests that the starting materials must have been enantiomers as well, because the reducing agents would reduce the same functional group, leading to products with opposite configurations if the starting materials were enantiomers.

Wait, but why would the starting materials need to be enantiomers? Because the two reactions (with LiBH4 and BH3) give enantiomeric products, which suggests that the starting materials are enantiomers.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 (with H+ workup) are both reducing agents, but perhaps they affect the stereochemistry differently.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epimers, but that's more about adjacent stereocenters.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials have a chiral center that, upon reduction, leads to the R and S configurations in the product.

Wait, but the product has a new chiral center at C4 (the ethyl group is at position 4). So when the starting material is reduced, the configuration at that center is determined by the starting material.

Assuming that the starting material is an ester or ketone that, when reduced, forms a new chiral center, the configuration of that center would depend on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester with a specific configuration that, upon reduction, leads to the R or S product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with a specific configuration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's consider the reaction in detail. If the starting material (A) is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, then when treated with LiBH4, the ketone (5-oxo) is reduced to a secondary alcohol. The same would happen for B, but perhaps with a different configuration.

Wait, but how does the reduction of the ketone lead to the formation of the cyclic product? Unless the starting material is part of a larger ring structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester with a structure that, upon reduction, forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the tetrahydropyran ring.

Wait, let's imagine that the starting material is a gamma-keto ester with a structure that allows for cyclization upon reduction. For example, if the ester is at the end of a chain, and upon reduction, it forms an alcohol that can attack a carbonyl group elsewhere, forming a ring.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry first.

The product's configuration is determined by the starting material's configuration because the reduction step creates a new chiral center. So perhaps the starting materials A and B are enantiomers, leading to the R and S products.

Looking at the options:

Option D) A is (R) configuration, B is (S). So if A is R, when reduced, it gives R product; B is S, when reduced, gives S product. But why would the reducing agents produce R or S based on the starting material's configuration?

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are different. Wait, perhaps LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce certain carbonyl groups that BH3 cannot. Wait, no, BH3 is more selective for certain groups, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: maybe the reaction is about the reduction of an ester group. LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols, while BH3 might not, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps BH3 is used in a different kind of reaction, like hydroboration.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, so maybe the starting materials have ketones that are being reduced. Or perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting materials are acyloxy compounds (like esters), and when treated with LiBH4, the ester is reduced to an alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the tetrahydropyran ring.

For example, if the starting material is an ester with the structure R-O-CO-R', then LiBH4 would reduce the ester to R-O-CH2-OH (or something like that). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an alpha-keto ester. The reduction would form a secondary alcohol, which could then undergo cyclization to form the ring.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible configurations of the starting materials.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydropyran-2-one. The ethyl is at position 4, and the ketone is at position 2. So, the ring is six-membered, with substituents at positions 2 and 4.

The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid with R or S configuration.

When the ketone (5-oxo) is reduced to a secondary alcohol, the molecule would have an OH group on C5. Now, how would that OH group form a ring?

Perhaps the OH can attack the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid, but that's a five-carbon chain, so maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule cyclizes via the OH and another part. For example, the OH on C5 could attack the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid, but that would require a five-membered ring, which is possible, but the product is a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has an ester group and a ketone, and upon reduction of the ketone, the molecule can form a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and when reduced, it forms a diol that can cyclize.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an alpha-keto acid ester. So, when reduced, the ketone becomes an alcohol, which can then form a ring.

Wait, but I'm not making progress on the structural aspect. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) A and B are both (S) configuration.

B) Both (R).

C) A is (S), B is (R).

D) A is (R), B is (S).

The products are (R) and (S), respectively. So A, when reduced by LiBH4, gives (R), and B, when reduced by BH3, gives (S).

So the question is, which starting materials would lead to these configurations upon reduction.

Assuming that the configuration at the chiral center in the product is influenced by the starting material's configuration, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers.

If A is (R) and B is (S), then treating them with different reducing agents would produce the R and S products.

Wait, but why would the reducing agents (LiBH4 vs. BH3) affect the configuration? Maybe because one agent leads to retention of configuration, and the other leads to inversion.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols, the configuration of the resulting alcohol is typically syn addition. Wait, but that's for alkenes. For ketones, the reduction with LiBH4 would form the secondary alcohol with the same configuration as the ketone's carbonyl group, but since ketones are planar, the new chiral center's configuration would depend on the approach of the hydride.

Wait, when a ketone is reduced, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, which is sp² hybridized and planar. The hydride can approach from either side, leading to a racemic mixture. But wait, if the starting material is already chiral, would that influence the configuration of the new chiral center?

Ah, this is crucial. If the starting material has a chiral center, the approach of the hydride during reduction could be influenced by the existing configuration, leading to a specific stereochemistry in the product.

So, if the starting material is R, the hydride may approach from a specific face, leading to R or S in the product, depending on the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the existing chiral center in the starting material determines the configuration of the new chiral center formed during reduction.

So, in the starting material, the chiral center is at C3 (the ethyl group) and at C5 (the oxo group). Wait, but in the starting material, the oxo group is a carbonyl, which is not a chiral center. So perhaps the only chiral center is at C3.

Wait, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the substituents at C3 are: CH2CH3, CH2 (from C2), and two others (from C4 and the COOH group?).

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2.

In this case, the chiral center would be at C3, which is CH(CH2CH3). The groups attached are: CH2CH2 (from C2), CH2C(=O)... (from C4), and the rest.

Wait, perhaps the configuration at C3 affects the approach of the hydride during reduction, which would determine the configuration at the new chiral center (C5) in the product.

So, when the ketone at C5 is reduced, the hydride (from LiBH4 or BH3) attacks the carbonyl carbon. The configuration of the new chiral center (C5) would depend on which face the hydride approaches from, which in turn depends on the configuration of C3.

So, if the starting material is R at C3, the hydride would approach from a specific side, leading to R configuration at C5 in the product. Similarly, if the starting material is S at C3, the hydride would approach from the opposite side, leading to S configuration at C5 in the product.

Wait, but that would mean that the configuration of the product's new chiral center (C5) is the same as the starting material's C3 configuration. So, if A is R, the product would be R; if B is S, the product would be S.

But in the question, the product from A is R, and from B is S. So, if A is R, the product is R; if B is S, the product is S. Thus, the starting materials A and B must be R and S, respectively. So, looking at the options:

Option D says A is R, B is S.

So, the correct answer would be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the proper starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that produce enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 for A and BH3 for B. The starting materials are given as (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Materials**:  
   The starting materials are pentanoic acids with:
   - An ethyl group at position 3.
   - An isobutoxy group and a ketone group at position 5.

   The stereochemistry at position 3 determines the configuration of the starting material (R or S).

2. **Reaction Mechanism**:  
   - The ketone group at position 5 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by the reducing agents.  
   - The stereochemistry of the new chiral center at position 5 in the product is influenced by the stereochemistry of the starting material at position 3.  
   - The reduction proceeds via syn addition of the hydride to the planar carbonyl group. The stereochemistry of the starting material at position 3 dictates the face of the carbonyl group that the hydride attacks, thereby determining the configuration of the product.

3. **Enantiomeric Products**:  
   - The product (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed from the (R)-configured starting material.  
   - The product (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed from the (S)-configured starting material.

4. **Options Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S)-configured. This would result in both products being (S), which contradicts the question.  
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R)-configured. This would result in both products being (R), which also contradicts the question.  
   - **Option C**: A is (S)-configured, and B is (R)-configured. This would produce (S) and (R) products, respectively, which matches the question.  
   - **Option D**: A is (R)-configured, and B is (S)-configured. This would produce (R) and (S) products, respectively, which also matches the question.

5. **Correct Option**:  
   Since the question specifies that A produces (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and B produces (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the correct starting materials are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for A and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for B.

ANSWER: D

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that a chemist performed two reactions using two different reducing agents on unknown compounds A and B. The products are both (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, respectively. Wait, no, let me check again. Oh right, A was treated with LiBH4 and H+, producing (R) product, and B was treated with BH3 and H+, giving the (S) product.

Hmm, I remember that LiBH4 and BH3 are both reducing agents, but maybe they work differently. Oh wait, LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, usually used for ketones, aldehydes, esters, maybe even amides. BH3 is also used in reductions, but I think BH3 (with things like THF as a catalyst) is used in hydroboration reactions, which are about adding boron to alkenes in a specific way.

Wait, wait, no. No, wait. I'm mixing up things. Actually, BH3 is often used in the formation of alcohols from alkenes through hydroboration-oxidation. But when it comes to reducing carbonyl groups, perhaps LiBH4 is stronger. Or is there a difference in how they reduce carbonyl groups? Let me think. Oh, wait, I think BH3 isn't typically used for reducing ketones. Oh wait, wait a second. Alternatively, maybe this is about the types of carbonyl groups being reduced.

Wait, but wait, the product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one. That's a cyclic ether, like a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone. So perhaps the starting material is an ester or a ketone that, when reduced, forms this structure. Let me think: tetrahydropyran-2-one would have a ring structure with an oxygen, like an ether, and a ketone group.

So the product is a five-membered ring? Wait, no. Wait, tetrahydropyran is a six-membered ring, right? Because pyran is a six-membered oxygen-containing ring, similar to pyrone, which is a lactone. So, 4-ethyl... so the ethyl is at position 4, and the ketone is at position 2.

So, the product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one, which suggests that the starting material for each reaction must have been a carbonyl group connected in such a way that upon reduction, it forms the ring structure.

Wait, but wait, what's the role of the reducing agents here? LiBH4 is used to reduce carbonyl groups (like ketones, aldehydes) to alcohols. Wait, but in this case, the product is a ketone. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the product is a ketone, so maybe the starting material was something else that gets converted into a ketone. Or perhaps the starting material had an ester group which, upon reduction, becomes a secondary alcohol, but that doesn't fit with the product being a ketone.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's think again. The product is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. That's a cyclic structure, so perhaps the starting material was a cyclic ester (like a lactone) or a cyclic ketone, but that doesn't seem right because LiBH4 would reduce a ketone to a secondary alcohol.

Wait, perhaps the starting material was an epoxide? No, LiBH4 isn't typically used for epoxide ring opening. Alternatively, maybe the starting material was a cyclic ether with a ketone, but that seems unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the reaction conditions. The first reaction uses LiBH4 and H+ (probably an acid workup). The second uses BH3 and H+.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the reducing agents. LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent for carbonyl groups. BH3, perhaps in the presence of something like THF (a Lewis acid?), is used for hydroboration reactions, which aren't about reducing carbonyls but for adding boron across double bonds, then oxidizing to form alcohols. But wait, in this case, the product is a ketone, so perhaps the starting material had an ester or a nitrile or something else that gets reduced.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or something else that upon treatment becomes the ketone. Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are esters, and when reduced, form the cyclic structure.

Wait, another approach: let's consider the products. The product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one. So perhaps the starting material was a gamma-keto ester or something that, upon reduction, forms a cyclic hemiacetal or something else that closes into a ring.

Wait, wait, perhaps it's about the formation of a cyclic ether via a ketone. So, if the starting material is a gamma-keto ester, then upon reduction of the ester group, you get an alcohol that can form a ring.

Wait, let me think: if the starting material is an ester, like an acyloxy compound, then treatment with LiBH4 would reduce the ester to an alcohol. For example, if you have R-O-CO-O-R', LiBH4 would reduce the ester group (RCOOR') to RCH2-O-R'. But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, a lactone. When reduced, it would open the ring. But that might not form a ketone. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's look at the options.

The options give A and B as (S) or (R) 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So the structure is pentanoic acid with substituents at positions 3 and 5. At position 5, there's an isobutoxy (OCH(CH2CH3)2) and an oxo group (a ketone), and at position 3, an ethyl group.

So, the structure is:

CH2CH2CH(CH2CH3)CO-O-isobutyl and a COOH group at the end?

Wait, no. Let me draw the structure.

Pentanoic acid is CH2CH2CH2CH2COOH. But here, it's 3-ethyl, which would be on the third carbon of the pentanoic chain. So numbering from the COOH end, the first carbon is COOH, second is CH2, third is CH(CH2CH3), fourth is CH2, fifth is CH3? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, pentanoic acid is CH3CH2CH2CH2COOH, but the substituents are on the third carbon. So, the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(O-something)-CH2-CH3? No, wait. The formula given is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So pentanoic acid has five carbons, with COOH on the first. So the structure is:

Carboxylic acid (carbon 1), then carbons 2, 3, 4, and 5.

At position 3 (carbon 3), there's an ethyl group. At position 5 (carbon 5), there's an isobutoxy (OCH(CH2CH3)2) and an oxo group (a ketone). So the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH(OIsobutyl)-

Wait, but wait, carbon 5 can't have both isobutoxy and oxo groups. Oh, wait, no, the nomenclature is such that 5-isobutoxy-5-oxo would imply that on carbon 5, there are two substituents: an oxygen from isobutoxy and an oxo group (a ketone). Wait, but that would mean the same carbon has both an oxygen (as in OCH(CH2CH3)2) and a carbonyl group. That can't be right because a carbon can't have both an OCH2CH2CH3 group and a carbonyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the structure. Wait, perhaps 5-oxo is a carbonyl group, so the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CO-O-isobutyl.

Wait, but that's not possible because the pentanoic acid chain would have five carbons. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-O-CH(CH2CH3)2)-CH2- ?

Wait, maybe the structure is:

The five carbons are arranged as:

1: COOH

2: CH2

3: CH(CH2CH3)

4: C(O-)

5: O-isobutyl?

No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

The carboxylic acid is at one end (C1), then C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH2CH3), C4 is C(O), and C5 is connected to the oxygen (O-isobutyl). But then, how does that form a five-carbon chain? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The main chain is five carbons, starting with the COOH. So:

COOH (C1) - CH2 (C2) - CH(CH2CH3) (C3) - C(O) (C4) - O-CH(CH2CH3)2 (C5).

But that's a five-carbon chain? Wait, but if C5 is the O-isobutyl group, that's not part of the main chain but a substituent on C4.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction. The product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one. So, the product is a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone at position 2.

So the starting material must have a structure that, upon reduction, forms this ring. How?

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester (lactone) that, when reduced, opens to form a diol, which then forms the ring upon dehydration? Hmm, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a gamma-keto ester. Gamma-keto esters can undergo various cyclizations. Wait, if you have a gamma-keto ester, like something with the structure RCOCH2COOR', then upon treatment with a reducing agent, the ester part gets reduced to an alcohol, but the ketone remains. But wait, in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ester, such as a gamma-lactone. When LiBH4 is used to reduce the ester group, it would open the ring and form an alcohol, but that would lead to a chain, not a ring. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is a cyclic ketone. But LiBH4 would reduce the ketone to a secondary alcohol, not form a ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ether with a ketone attached. No, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, another approach. If the product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one, which is a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone, perhaps the starting material is a diol or another structure that, when treated with a reducing agent, forms this ring.

Wait, but the reactions involve different reducing agents. Maybe the starting materials are enol ethers or something else where the reducing agents would act differently.

Alternatively, perhaps we're dealing with the reduction of an ester group to form an alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester with a structure that allows for ring formation upon reduction. So, when the ester is reduced, the oxygen becomes an alcohol, and the molecule cyclizes to form a six-membered ring, including the oxygen.

Wait, so for example, if the starting material is something like CH2CH2CH(OCH2CH2CH3)COOR, and when reduced, the ester group (COOR) becomes CH2OH. Then, the OH and the adjacent CH2 groups could form a ring.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a keto ester, which upon reduction forms a secondary alcohol that can form the ring structure.

Wait, let's think about the stereochemistry. The products are enantiomers: (R) and (S). So the starting materials must have been enantiomers as well, because the reducing agents may not change the configuration of any chiral centers except those involved in the reduction.

Wait, but wait. When you reduce a ketone to an alcohol using a reducing agent like LiBH4, the configuration of any existing chiral centers not involved in the reduction would remain the same. So if the starting material is a chiral compound, the product would retain that configuration, but the new chiral center (from the reduction) would have a specific configuration based on the reduction.

Wait, but in this case, the product is a cyclic ketone, which is a new structure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material has a carbonyl group that's part of a ring, and the reduction breaks the ring. No, that doesn't fit.

Wait, another thought: maybe the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal or acetal that, upon treatment with a reducing agent, gets opened or modified to form the product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials are epoxides, but I don't think that's the case here.

Wait, let me step back. The product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one, which is a cyclic ether with a ketone. So the starting material must have had a structure that, upon reduction, forms this ring.

Perhaps the starting material is a diethyl acetal of a ketone. No, because reducing an acetal would typically require acid conditions, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketone, but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are esters, and upon reduction, they form the ring structure. Wait, let's consider that. If the starting material is an ester where the oxygen is part of a ring, perhaps a lactone. Then, reducing the lactone would open it. For example, a gamma-lactone would, upon reduction, become a diol, but that's not forming a ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a beta-keto ester. Beta-keto esters can undergo various condensations, but I'm not sure how that would form the ring in this case.

Wait, let me think about the options again. The options for A and B are (S) or (R) 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

So, the structure is a pentanoic acid (five carbons) with an ethyl group on C3, an isobutoxy group and a ketone on C5.

Wait, but how does that lead to a six-membered ring upon reduction?

Ah, maybe because the starting material is an ester. Wait, the acid is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So if it's an acid, perhaps the starting material would have been the corresponding ester, but the options here are the acids.

Wait, but the reactions are treating A and B with LiBH4 and BH3, respectively. So if the starting material is a carboxylic acid, how would the reducing agents act?

Wait, LiBH4 typically doesn't reduce carboxylic acids; they are generally resistant to LiBH4. However, if the compound has another reducible group, like an ester or a ketone, LiBH4 would reduce that.

Looking at the structure, the starting material (the acid) has a 5-oxo group (a ketone) and an isobutoxy group (an ether). So, perhaps the ketone is being reduced.

Wait, if the starting material is (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, then when treated with LiBH4, the ketone (5-oxo) would be reduced to a secondary alcohol. So the product would have an alcohol group at position 5, along with the isobutoxy group.

But wait, how would that form the cyclic structure? Let me think: the starting material is a pentanoic acid with substituents on C3 and C5.

Upon reduction of the ketone (C5), you get a secondary alcohol. So the structure becomes 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-hydroxypentanoic acid.

Wait, but that's a five-carbon chain with a hydroxyl and isobutoxy groups on C5. How does that form a six-membered ring?

Ah! Wait, perhaps the hydroxyl group on C5 can form a ring by losing water, connecting to another part of the molecule. For example, an intramolecular esterification or some kind of cyclization.

Wait, if the hydroxyl on C5 attacks the adjacent carbonyl or another position, perhaps forming a ring.

Wait, let me imagine the structure. The starting material after reduction has a hydroxyl on C5, which is adjacent to the isobutoxy group.

Wait, but the molecule is 5-isobutoxy-5-hydroxypentanoic acid. So, the structure would be:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(OH)(OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxo-pentanoic acid. So, the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, no, the 5-oxo implies a ketone, so:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2 ?

Wait, no, that can't be right because the substituents on C5 would be the oxo group and the isobutoxy group. So, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-C(O-OCH(CH2CH3)2)

Wait, no, that would be a four-carbon chain, not five. Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me think again.

Pentanoic acid is five carbons, so:

Position 1: COOH.

Position 2: CH2.

Position 3: CH(CH2CH3).

Position 4: CH2.

Position 5: C(=O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2.

Wait, that would make it a five-carbon chain, but then the 5 position is a carbonyl group attached to an isobutoxy group. So the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2.

So, it's a pentanoic acid with a keto group on C5, which is an ester (since it's O-linked to isobutyl). So, the group is an acetoxy group? Or perhaps a lactone? No, because it's an ester.

Wait, but then, when LiBH4 is used, it would reduce the carbonyl group (the ketone) to an alcohol. So the product would be a secondary alcohol on C5.

Structure after reduction: COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-CH(OH)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2.

Wait, but how does that form a ring? Maybe the OH can attack the carbonyl group, but in this case, the carbonyl is already reduced. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The product is a tetrahydropyran-2-one, which is a six-membered ring with an oxygen and a ketone.

So perhaps the starting material is designed such that when the ketone is reduced, the molecule cyclizes to form the ring. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester that, upon reduction, forms a diol which then undergoes cyclization. Let me think: if the ester is at position 5, and when reduced, you get an alcohol, and perhaps another hydroxyl group elsewhere, allowing the formation of a ring via an elimination reaction.

Wait, maybe it's more about the stereochemistry of the reduction. The question is about which starting materials (A and B) would, upon treatment with different reducing agents, produce the R and S products.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting material is a cyclic hemiacetal that, upon reduction, forms the desired product. But I'm not sure how the reducing agents would affect that.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a cyclic ketal or acetal. But in that case, the reducing agents would open the ring.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the stereochemistry of the starting materials and the products.

The product from A is (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. From B, it's (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one.

So the products are enantiomers. That suggests that the starting materials must have been enantiomers as well, because the reducing agents would reduce the same functional group, leading to products with opposite configurations if the starting materials were enantiomers.

Wait, but why would the starting materials need to be enantiomers? Because the two reactions (with LiBH4 and BH3) give enantiomeric products, which suggests that the starting materials are enantiomers.

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 (with H+ workup) are both reducing agents, but perhaps they affect the stereochemistry differently.

Wait, perhaps the starting materials are epimers, but that's more about adjacent stereocenters.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting materials have a chiral center that, upon reduction, leads to the R and S configurations in the product.

Wait, but the product has a new chiral center at C4 (the ethyl group is at position 4). So when the starting material is reduced, the configuration at that center is determined by the starting material.

Assuming that the starting material is an ester or ketone that, when reduced, forms a new chiral center, the configuration of that center would depend on the starting material's configuration.

Wait, perhaps the starting material is an ester with a specific configuration that, upon reduction, leads to the R or S product.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is a ketone with a specific configuration, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's consider the reaction in detail. If the starting material (A) is (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid, then when treated with LiBH4, the ketone (5-oxo) is reduced to a secondary alcohol. The same would happen for B, but perhaps with a different configuration.

Wait, but how does the reduction of the ketone lead to the formation of the cyclic product? Unless the starting material is part of a larger ring structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester with a structure that, upon reduction, forms a diol, which then cyclizes to form the tetrahydropyran ring.

Wait, let's imagine that the starting material is a gamma-keto ester with a structure that allows for cyclization upon reduction. For example, if the ester is at the end of a chain, and upon reduction, it forms an alcohol that can attack a carbonyl group elsewhere, forming a ring.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should think about the stereochemistry first.

The product's configuration is determined by the starting material's configuration because the reduction step creates a new chiral center. So perhaps the starting materials A and B are enantiomers, leading to the R and S products.

Looking at the options:

Option D) A is (R) configuration, B is (S). So if A is R, when reduced, it gives R product; B is S, when reduced, gives S product. But why would the reducing agents produce R or S based on the starting material's configuration?

Wait, but LiBH4 and BH3 are different. Wait, perhaps LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent that can reduce certain carbonyl groups that BH3 cannot. Wait, no, BH3 is more selective for certain groups, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: maybe the reaction is about the reduction of an ester group. LiBH4 can reduce esters to alcohols, while BH3 might not, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps BH3 is used in a different kind of reaction, like hydroboration.

Wait, but the product is a ketone, so maybe the starting materials have ketones that are being reduced. Or perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the starting materials are acyloxy compounds (like esters), and when treated with LiBH4, the ester is reduced to an alcohol, which then undergoes cyclization to form the tetrahydropyran ring.

For example, if the starting material is an ester with the structure R-O-CO-R', then LiBH4 would reduce the ester to R-O-CH2-OH (or something like that). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the starting material is an alpha-keto ester. The reduction would form a secondary alcohol, which could then undergo cyclization to form the ring.

But I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the possible configurations of the starting materials.

The product is 4-ethyltetrahydropyran-2-one. The ethyl is at position 4, and the ketone is at position 2. So, the ring is six-membered, with substituents at positions 2 and 4.

The starting materials are 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid with R or S configuration.

When the ketone (5-oxo) is reduced to a secondary alcohol, the molecule would have an OH group on C5. Now, how would that OH group form a ring?

Perhaps the OH can attack the carbonyl of the carboxylic acid, but that's a five-carbon chain, so maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule cyclizes via the OH and another part. For example, the OH on C5 could attack the carbonyl carbon of the carboxylic acid, but that would require a five-membered ring, which is possible, but the product is a six-membered ring.

Wait, perhaps the starting material has an ester group and a ketone, and upon reduction of the ketone, the molecule can form a six-membered ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the starting material is an ester, and when reduced, it forms a diol that can cyclize.

Wait, maybe the starting material is an alpha-keto acid ester. So, when reduced, the ketone becomes an alcohol, which can then form a ring.

Wait, but I'm not making progress on the structural aspect. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A) A and B are both (S) configuration.

B) Both (R).

C) A is (S), B is (R).

D) A is (R), B is (S).

The products are (R) and (S), respectively. So A, when reduced by LiBH4, gives (R), and B, when reduced by BH3, gives (S).

So the question is, which starting materials would lead to these configurations upon reduction.

Assuming that the configuration at the chiral center in the product is influenced by the starting material's configuration, perhaps the starting materials are enantiomers.

If A is (R) and B is (S), then treating them with different reducing agents would produce the R and S products.

Wait, but why would the reducing agents (LiBH4 vs. BH3) affect the configuration? Maybe because one agent leads to retention of configuration, and the other leads to inversion.

Wait, but LiBH4 is a strong reducing agent, and in the reduction of ketones to secondary alcohols, the configuration of the resulting alcohol is typically syn addition. Wait, but that's for alkenes. For ketones, the reduction with LiBH4 would form the secondary alcohol with the same configuration as the ketone's carbonyl group, but since ketones are planar, the new chiral center's configuration would depend on the approach of the hydride.

Wait, when a ketone is reduced, the hydride attacks the carbonyl carbon, which is sp² hybridized and planar. The hydride can approach from either side, leading to a racemic mixture. But wait, if the starting material is already chiral, would that influence the configuration of the new chiral center?

Ah, this is crucial. If the starting material has a chiral center, the approach of the hydride during reduction could be influenced by the existing configuration, leading to a specific stereochemistry in the product.

So, if the starting material is R, the hydride may approach from a specific face, leading to R or S in the product, depending on the setup.

Alternatively, perhaps the configuration of the existing chiral center in the starting material determines the configuration of the new chiral center formed during reduction.

So, in the starting material, the chiral center is at C3 (the ethyl group) and at C5 (the oxo group). Wait, but in the starting material, the oxo group is a carbonyl, which is not a chiral center. So perhaps the only chiral center is at C3.

Wait, the starting material is 3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid. So, the substituents at C3 are: CH2CH3, CH2 (from C2), and two others (from C4 and the COOH group?).

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOH-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-CH2-C(=O)-O-CH(CH2CH3)2.

In this case, the chiral center would be at C3, which is CH(CH2CH3). The groups attached are: CH2CH2 (from C2), CH2C(=O)... (from C4), and the rest.

Wait, perhaps the configuration at C3 affects the approach of the hydride during reduction, which would determine the configuration at the new chiral center (C5) in the product.

So, when the ketone at C5 is reduced, the hydride (from LiBH4 or BH3) attacks the carbonyl carbon. The configuration of the new chiral center (C5) would depend on which face the hydride approaches from, which in turn depends on the configuration of C3.

So, if the starting material is R at C3, the hydride would approach from a specific side, leading to R configuration at C5 in the product. Similarly, if the starting material is S at C3, the hydride would approach from the opposite side, leading to S configuration at C5 in the product.

Wait, but that would mean that the configuration of the product's new chiral center (C5) is the same as the starting material's C3 configuration. So, if A is R, the product would be R; if B is S, the product would be S.

But in the question, the product from A is R, and from B is S. So, if A is R, the product is R; if B is S, the product is S. Thus, the starting materials A and B must be R and S, respectively. So, looking at the options:

Option D says A is R, B is S.

So, the correct answer would be option D.


The question involves determining the proper starting materials (A and B) for two reactions that produce enantiomeric products: (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one. The reactions use different reducing agents: LiBH4 for A and BH3 for B. The starting materials are given as (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid and (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Structure of the Starting Materials**:  
   The starting materials are pentanoic acids with:
   - An ethyl group at position 3.
   - An isobutoxy group and a ketone group at position 5.

   The stereochemistry at position 3 determines the configuration of the starting material (R or S).

2. **Reaction Mechanism**:  
   - The ketone group at position 5 is reduced to a secondary alcohol by the reducing agents.  
   - The stereochemistry of the new chiral center at position 5 in the product is influenced by the stereochemistry of the starting material at position 3.  
   - The reduction proceeds via syn addition of the hydride to the planar carbonyl group. The stereochemistry of the starting material at position 3 dictates the face of the carbonyl group that the hydride attacks, thereby determining the configuration of the product.

3. **Enantiomeric Products**:  
   - The product (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed from the (R)-configured starting material.  
   - The product (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one is formed from the (S)-configured starting material.

4. **Options Analysis**:  
   - **Option A**: Both A and B are (S)-configured. This would result in both products being (S), which contradicts the question.  
   - **Option B**: Both A and B are (R)-configured. This would result in both products being (R), which also contradicts the question.  
   - **Option C**: A is (S)-configured, and B is (R)-configured. This would produce (S) and (R) products, respectively, which matches the question.  
   - **Option D**: A is (R)-configured, and B is (S)-configured. This would produce (R) and (S) products, respectively, which also matches the question.

5. **Correct Option**:  
   Since the question specifies that A produces (R)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one and B produces (S)-4-ethyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-one, the correct starting materials are (R)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for A and (S)-3-ethyl-5-isobutoxy-5-oxopentanoic acid for B.

ANSWER: D
