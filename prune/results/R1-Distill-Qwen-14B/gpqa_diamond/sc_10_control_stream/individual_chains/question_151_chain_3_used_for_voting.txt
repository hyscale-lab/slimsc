Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, those are just three numbers, so it's a 3x1 column vector. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, meaning their length (or norm) should be 1. But wait, let me check that first because it's important for probabilities.

So the state vector is |ψ⟩ = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. To find its norm, I need to compute the dot product of the vector with itself. That would be (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6), which is more than 1. That means this state isn't normalized yet. But wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as unit vectors. So perhaps I need to normalize it? Or does the problem not require it because the observable's probabilities might not depend on it? Hmm, but for calculating the probabilities correctly, I think normalization is necessary. So I should probably divide each component by sqrt(6) to make it a unit vector.

But wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about normalization. Oh wait, the question is about the probability of measuring the observable P to give 0. So perhaps I can proceed without normalizing because the probabilities are based on eigenvectors, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should proceed and see where it leads.

Next, the observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix is given as having first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So writing it out:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

I remember that observables are Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues are real. Let me quickly check if P is Hermitian. The conjugate transpose of P should equal P. The elements are real, so the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. Let's see:

The (1,2) element is 1/√2, so the (2,1) should be 1/√2 as well. It is. The (1,3) is 0, same as the (3,1). The (2,3) is 1/√2, so (3,2) is 1/√2. Correct. So yes, P is Hermitian. So the eigenvalues are real—so 0 is a possible eigenvalue.

We need to find the probability that a measurement of P yields 0. The probability is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 in the state vector.

So the plan is:

1. Find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

2. Ensure they are orthonormal.

3. For each eigenvector |v⟩, compute the inner product ⟨v | ψ⟩.

4. The probability is the square of the absolute value of this inner product.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

Let me write down P again:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

So to find eigenvalues, we solve det(P - λ I) = 0.

The matrix P - λ I is:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ],
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ],
[0, 1/√2, -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0 [ ... ]

Wait, calculating the determinant for a 3x3 might be a bit long. Let me compute it step by step.

The determinant can be expanded along the first row.

det = (-λ) * det [ (-λ, 1/√2), (1/√2, -λ) ) ] 
        - (1/√2) * det [ (1/√2, 1/√2), (0, -λ) ) ]
        + 0 * det[ ... ]

So the third term is zero.

First minor determinant:
[ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] = λ² - (1/2).

Second minor determinant:
[ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] = (-λ / √2) 

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2) * (-λ / √2 )

Simplify each term:

First term: (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ / 2)

Second term: -(1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = (λ) (1/√2 * 1/√2) ) = λ (1/2 )

So combining the two terms:

det = (-λ^3 + (λ/2)) + (λ/2 ) = -λ^3 + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ^3 + λ.

So the determinant equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0.

Factor this: λ ( -λ² +1 ) = 0 → λ (1 - λ² ) = 0.

So eigenvalues are λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So one of the eigenvalues is 0, which is what we're interested in.

Now, find the eigenvector(s) for λ=0.

We solve (P - 0 I)|v> = 0 → P |v> =0.

The equations are:

[0, 1/√2, 0] [x]   [0]
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2] [y] = [0]
[0, 1/√2, 0] [z]   [0]

So writing out the equations:

1) 0*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0 → y = 0.

2) (1/√2)x + 0*y + (1/√2) z = 0 → x + z = 0.

3) 0*x + (1/√2) y + 0*z = 0 → same as equation 1, y=0.

So from equation 1, y=0.

From equation 2, x = -z.

So the eigenvectors are of the form [x, 0, -x]. Let me write this as x [1, 0, -1 ].

Thus, the eigenvectors are any scalar multiples of [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.

But wait, wait. Wait a minute. Let me double-check the equations.

Wait, equation 3: 0*x + (1/√2) y + 0*z = 0 → same as equation 1, so only two equations, but three variables.

So the solution is that y=0, and x = -z.

So the general solution is (x, 0, x') where x' is -x. So the vector is [x, 0, -x]^T. So any vector of this form is an eigenvector for λ=0.

Thus, the eigenvectors are multiples of [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, and the normalized eigenvector would be [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

Wait, let me compute the norm of [1,0,-1]. It's sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) )^T.

Now, the state vector given is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. But wait, earlier I thought it's not normalized. Let me compute its norm.

Norm squared is (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So norm is sqrt(6), so |ψ> is not a unit vector. Hmm, but when calculating probabilities, we need the state to be normalized. So perhaps I should normalize |ψ> before computing the inner product.

Ah, but the probability is |⟨v|ψ⟩|^2, where |v⟩ is the normalized eigenvector. Alternatively, perhaps the inner product can be calculated without normalization of |ψ>, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, the state can be any vector, not necessarily normalized. So the probabilities are calculated by taking the square of the amplitudes relative to the eigenvectors. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state must be normalized because the probabilities should sum to 1. So perhaps I should first normalize |ψ>.

So |ψ> is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Its norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

But wait, the problem statement doesn't mention normalization. Hmm. Let me see. The state is not necessarily normalized, but in quantum mechanics, states are represented as vectors in a projective Hilbert space, so perhaps the probabilities are computed as the square of the inner product, but I think the state vector has to be normalized. Otherwise, the probabilities wouldn't sum to 1.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the probability of measuring 0. So maybe I can proceed by computing the inner product without normalizing, but perhaps the answer depends on that. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed as follows:

Compute the inner product between the state vector and the eigenvector, then square the absolute value to get the probability.

But since the state is not normalized, the probability would be (|⟨v|ψ⟩|^2 ) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩). Because the standard formula is P = |⟨v|ψ⟩|^2 / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩, ensuring that probabilities sum to 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is not normalized, but the probabilities are calculated as the square of the inner product, regardless of the state's normalization. Wait, no, that can't be right because if the state isn't normalized, the probabilities would sum to more than 1. So for example, if |ψ> is [2,0,0], the norm is 2, and the inner product with itself would be 4, so the probabilities would be 4/4=1 for the first component.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the probability is |⟨v|ψ⟩|^2 divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩.

So in this problem, perhaps I should compute the inner product between |v> and |ψ>, square it, and then divide by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩.

So let's proceed.

First, the eigenvector |v> is (1, 0, -1 )^T, but normalized as (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ).

But wait, the state |ψ> is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Let me compute the inner product ⟨v | ψ⟩.

⟨v | ψ⟩ = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1.

Which is (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) = (-2)/(sqrt(2)) ) = -sqrt(2).

Wait, wait. Let me compute this again.

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) = -1/sqrt(2)
0 * 2 = 0
(-1/sqrt(2)) * 1 = -1/sqrt(2)
Adding together: (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) )= (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

So the inner product is -sqrt(2).

The absolute value squared is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

But wait, the norm of |ψ> is sqrt(6), so ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ is 6.

So the probability is (2) / 6 = 1/3.

Wait, that gives 1/3, which is option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me re-examine the eigenvector.

Earlier, I thought that the eigenvector for λ=0 is [1, 0, -1 ]^T. But when I normalized it, I took (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) )^T.

Wait, actually, the eigenvector is any non-zero multiple, so perhaps I can choose it as [1, 0, -1 ]^T, but without normalizing. Because when computing the inner product, the probability would be |⟨v|ψ⟩|^2 / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩.

Wait, no. The correct approach is to first express the state as a unit vector. So let me proceed again.

The state |ψ> is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Its norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state is |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

The eigenvector |v> corresponding to λ=0 is [1, 0, -1 ]^T, but normalized. So |v> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1 ]^T.

The inner product between |v> and |ψ_normalized> is:

⟨v | ψ_normalized⟩ = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + ( -1/sqrt(2) )*(1/sqrt(6)).

Which is [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + [ 0 ] + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]

So that's (-1)/(sqrt(12)) + (-1)/(sqrt(12)) ) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

So the absolute value squared is (1/3).

So the probability is 1/3.

So the correct answer is option C, which is 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it without normalizing the state vector. Let's try that.

The inner product between |v> (unnormalized) and |ψ> (unnormalized) is [1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 ] = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.

The norm squared of |ψ> is 6.

The norm squared of |v> is 1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 = 2.

So the probability is |⟨v|ψ⟩|^2 / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩ * ⟨v|v⟩ )

Which is [ (-2)^2 ] / (6 * 2 ) = 4 / 12 = 1/3.

Same result. So either way, the probability is 1/3, which is option C.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) to yield 0 for the given state vector \( |\psi\rangle = [-1, 2, 1]^T \). The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
To find the eigenvalues of \( P \), we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). The determinant calculation yields:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = -\lambda^3 + \lambda = 0.
\]

Factoring, we get:

\[
\lambda (\lambda^2 - 1) = 0 \implies \lambda = 0, \pm 1.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

### Step 2: Eigenvector for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), we solve \( (P - 0I)|v\rangle = 0 \), which gives the system of equations:

1. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} y = 0 \implies y = 0 \),
2. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} x + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} z = 0 \implies x + z = 0 \),
3. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} y = 0 \implies y = 0 \).

From these, \( y = 0 \) and \( z = -x \). Thus, the eigenvectors are of the form \( [x, 0, -x]^T \), or equivalently, spanned by \( [1, 0, -1]^T \). Normalizing this vector gives:

\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} [1, 0, -1]^T.
\]

### Step 3: Inner Product and Probability
The state vector \( |\psi\rangle = [-1, 2, 1]^T \) is not normalized. Its norm is:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

The normalized state is:

\[
|\psi_{\text{norm}}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} [-1, 2, 1]^T.
\]

The inner product between \( |v\rangle \) and \( |\psi_{\text{norm}}\rangle \) is:

\[
\langle v | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of this inner product:

\[
P(P=0) = \left| \langle v | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle \right|^2 = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, those are just three numbers, so it's a 3x1 column vector. I remember that in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are usually normalized, meaning their length (or norm) should be 1.

So the state vector is |ψ⟩ = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. To find its norm, I need to compute the dot product of the vector with itself. That would be (-1)^2 + (2)^2 + (1)^2 = 1 + 4 + 1 = 6. Oh, so the norm is sqrt(6), which is more than 1. That means this state isn't normalized yet. But wait, in quantum mechanics, states are usually represented as unit vectors. So perhaps I need to normalize it? Or does the problem not require it because the observable's probabilities might not depend on it? Hmm, but for calculating the probabilities correctly, I think normalization is necessary. So I should probably divide each component by sqrt(6) to make it a unit vector.

But wait, the problem doesn't mention anything about normalization. Oh wait, the question is about the probability of measuring the observable P to give 0. So perhaps I can proceed without normalizing because the probabilities are based on eigenvectors, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should proceed and see where it leads.

Next, the observable is represented by the matrix P. The matrix is given as having first row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0), second row (1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)), and third row (0, 1/sqrt(2), 0). So writing it out:

P = [ [0, 1/√2, 0],
       [1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
       [0, 1/√2, 0] ]

I remember that observables are Hermitian matrices because their eigenvalues are real. Let me quickly check if P is Hermitian. The conjugate transpose of P should equal P. The elements are real, so the conjugate transpose is just the transpose. Let's see:

The (1,2) element is 1/√2, so the (2,1) should be 1/√2 as well. It is. The (1,3) is 0, same as the (3,1). The (2,3) is 1/√2, so (3,2) is 1/√2. Correct. So yes, P is Hermitian. So the eigenvalues are real—so 0 is a possible eigenvalue.

We need to find the probability that a measurement of P yields 0. The probability is the square of the amplitude of the eigenvector corresponding to eigenvalue 0 in the state vector.

So the plan is:

1. Find the eigenvectors of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0.

2. Ensure they are orthonormal.

3. For each eigenvector |v⟩, compute the inner product ⟨v | ψ⟩.

4. The probability is the square of the absolute value of this inner product.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

Let me write down P again:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

So to find eigenvalues, we solve det(P - λ I) = 0.

The matrix P - λ I is:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ],
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ],
[0, 1/√2, -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] - (1/√2) [ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] + 0 [ ... ]

Wait, calculating the determinant for a 3x3 might be a bit long. Let me compute it step by step.

The determinant can be expanded along the first row.

det = (-λ) * det [ (-λ, 1/√2), (1/√2, -λ) ) ] 
        - (1/√2) * det [ (1/√2, 1/√2), (0, -λ) ) ]
        + 0 * det[ ... ]

So the third term is zero.

First minor determinant:
[ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ) ] = λ² - (1/2).

Second minor determinant:
[ (1/√2)(-λ) - (1/√2)(0) ) ] = (-λ / √2) 

So putting it all together:

det = (-λ) * (λ² - 1/2) - (1/√2) * (-λ / √2 )

Simplify each term:

First term: (-λ)(λ² - 1/2) = -λ^3 + (λ / 2)

Second term: -(1/√2) * (-λ/√2) = (λ) (1/√2 * 1/√2) ) = λ (1/2 )

So combining the two terms:

det = (-λ^3 + (λ/2)) + (λ/2 ) = -λ^3 + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ^3 + λ.

So the determinant equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0.

Factor this: λ ( -λ² +1 ) = 0 → λ (1 - λ² ) = 0.

So eigenvalues are λ=0, λ=1, λ=-1.

So one of the eigenvalues is 0, which is what we're interested in.

Now, find the eigenvector(s) for λ=0.

We solve (P - 0 I)|v> = 0 → P |v> =0.

The equations are:

[0, 1/√2, 0] [x]   [0]
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2] [y] = [0]
[0, 1/√2, 0] [z]   [0]

So writing out the equations:

1) 0*x + (1/√2)*y + 0*z = 0 → y = 0.

2) (1/√2)x + 0*y + (1/√2) z = 0 → x + z = 0.

3) 0*x + (1/√2) y + 0*z = 0 → same as equation 1, y=0.

So from equation 1, y=0.

From equation 2, x = -z.

So the eigenvectors are of the form [x, 0, -x]. Let me write this as x [1, 0, -1 ].

Thus, the eigenvectors are any scalar multiples of [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, spanned by this vector.

But wait, wait. Wait a minute. Let me double-check the equations.

Wait, equation 3: 0*x + (1/√2) y + 0*z = 0 → same as equation 1, so only two equations, but three variables.

So the solution is that y=0, and x = -z.

So the general solution is (x, 0, x') where x' is -x. So the vector is [x, 0, -x]^T. So any vector of this form is an eigenvector for λ=0.

Thus, the eigenvectors are multiples of [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the eigenspace is one-dimensional, and the normalized eigenvector would be [1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)]^T.

Wait, let me compute the norm of [1,0,-1]. It's sqrt(1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 )= sqrt(2). So the normalized vector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) )^T.

Now, the state vector given is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. But wait, earlier I thought it's not normalized. Let me compute its norm.

Norm squared is (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So norm is sqrt(6), so |ψ> is not a unit vector. Hmm, but when calculating probabilities, we need the state to be normalized. So perhaps I should normalize |ψ> before computing the inner product.

Ah, but the probability is |⟨v|ψ⟩|^2, where |v⟩ is the normalized eigenvector. Alternatively, perhaps the inner product can be calculated without normalization of |ψ>, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, the state can be any vector, not necessarily normalized. So the probabilities are calculated by taking the square of the amplitudes relative to the eigenvectors. But wait, in quantum mechanics, the state must be normalized because the probabilities should sum to 1. So perhaps I should first normalize |ψ>.

So |ψ> is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Its norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state would be (1/sqrt(6)) * [-1, 2, 1]^T.

But wait, the problem statement doesn't mention normalization. Hmm. Let me see. The state is not necessarily normalized, but in quantum mechanics, states are represented as vectors in a projective Hilbert space, so perhaps the probabilities are computed as the square of the inner product, but I think the state vector has to be normalized. Otherwise, the probabilities wouldn't sum to 1.

Wait, but the problem is asking for the probability of measuring 0. So maybe I can proceed by computing the inner product without normalizing, but perhaps the answer depends on that. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed as follows:

Compute the inner product between the state vector and the eigenvector, then square the absolute value to get the probability.

But since the state is not normalized, the probability would be (|⟨v|ψ⟩|^2 ) / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩). Because the standard formula is P = |⟨v|ψ⟩|^2 / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩, ensuring that probabilities sum to 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial state is not normalized, but the probabilities are calculated as the square of the inner product, regardless of the state's normalization. Wait, no, that can't be right because if the state isn't normalized, the probabilities would sum to more than 1. So for example, if |ψ> is [2,0,0], the norm is 2, and the inner product with itself would be 4, so the probabilities would be 4/4=1 for the first component.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the probability is |⟨v|ψ⟩|^2 divided by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩.

So in this problem, perhaps I should compute the inner product between |v> and |ψ>, square it, and then divide by ⟨ψ|ψ⟩.

So let's proceed.

First, the eigenvector |v> is (1, 0, -1 )^T, but normalized as (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) ).

But wait, the state |ψ> is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Let me compute the inner product ⟨v | ψ⟩.

⟨v | ψ⟩ = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1/sqrt(2))*1.

Which is (-1/sqrt(2)) + 0 + (-1/sqrt(2)) = (-2)/(sqrt(2)) ) = -sqrt(2).

Wait, wait. Let me compute this again.

(1/sqrt(2))*(-1) = -1/sqrt(2)
0 * 2 = 0
(-1/sqrt(2)) * 1 = -1/sqrt(2)
Adding together: (-1/sqrt(2)) + (-1/sqrt(2)) )= (-2)/sqrt(2) = -sqrt(2).

So the inner product is -sqrt(2).

The absolute value squared is (sqrt(2))^2 = 2.

But wait, the norm of |ψ> is sqrt(6), so ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ is 6.

So the probability is (2) / 6 = 1/3.

Wait, that gives 1/3, which is option C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me re-examine the eigenvector.

Earlier, I thought that the eigenvector for λ=0 is [1, 0, -1 ]^T. But when I normalized it, I took (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2) )^T.

Wait, actually, the eigenvector is any non-zero multiple, so perhaps I can choose it as [1, 0, -1 ]^T, but without normalizing. Because when computing the inner product, the probability would be |⟨v|ψ⟩|^2 / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩.

Wait, no. The correct approach is to first express the state as a unit vector. So let me proceed again.

The state |ψ> is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Its norm is sqrt(6), so the normalized state is |ψ_normalized> = (1/sqrt(6)) [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T.

The eigenvector |v> corresponding to λ=0 is [1, 0, -1 ]^T, but normalized. So |v> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1 ]^T.

The inner product between |v> and |ψ_normalized> is:

⟨v | ψ_normalized⟩ = (1/sqrt(2))*(-1/sqrt(6)) + 0*(2/sqrt(6)) + ( -1/sqrt(2) )*(1/sqrt(6)).

Which is [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ] + [ 0 ] + [ (-1)/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(6)) ) ]

So that's (-1)/(sqrt(12)) + (-1)/(sqrt(12)) ) = (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

So the absolute value squared is (1/3).

So the probability is 1/3.

So the correct answer is option C, which is 1/3.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it without normalizing the state vector. Let's try that.

The inner product between |v> (unnormalized) and |ψ> (unnormalized) is [1*(-1) + 0*2 + (-1)*1 ] = (-1) + 0 + (-1) = -2.

The norm squared of |ψ> is 6.

The norm squared of |v> is 1^2 + 0 + (-1)^2 = 2.

So the probability is |⟨v|ψ⟩|^2 / (⟨ψ|ψ⟩ * ⟨v|v⟩ )

Which is [ (-2)^2 ] / (6 * 2 ) = 4 / 12 = 1/3.

Same result. So either way, the probability is 1/3, which is option C.


To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) to yield 0 for the given state vector \( |\psi\rangle = [-1, 2, 1]^T \). The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Eigenvalues of \( P \)
To find the eigenvalues of \( P \), we solve the characteristic equation \( \det(P - \lambda I) = 0 \). The determinant calculation yields:

\[
\det(P - \lambda I) = -\lambda^3 + \lambda = 0.
\]

Factoring, we get:

\[
\lambda (\lambda^2 - 1) = 0 \implies \lambda = 0, \pm 1.
\]

Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda = 0, 1, -1 \).

### Step 2: Eigenvector for \( \lambda = 0 \)
For \( \lambda = 0 \), we solve \( (P - 0I)|v\rangle = 0 \), which gives the system of equations:

1. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} y = 0 \implies y = 0 \),
2. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} x + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} z = 0 \implies x + z = 0 \),
3. \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} y = 0 \implies y = 0 \).

From these, \( y = 0 \) and \( z = -x \). Thus, the eigenvectors are of the form \( [x, 0, -x]^T \), or equivalently, spanned by \( [1, 0, -1]^T \). Normalizing this vector gives:

\[
|v\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} [1, 0, -1]^T.
\]

### Step 3: Inner Product and Probability
The state vector \( |\psi\rangle = [-1, 2, 1]^T \) is not normalized. Its norm is:

\[
\|\psi\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

The normalized state is:

\[
|\psi_{\text{norm}}\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} [-1, 2, 1]^T.
\]

The inner product between \( |v\rangle \) and \( |\psi_{\text{norm}}\rangle \) is:

\[
\langle v | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{-1}{\sqrt{6}} + 0 \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} + \frac{-1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of this inner product:

\[
P(P=0) = \left| \langle v | \psi_{\text{norm}} \rangle \right|^2 = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
