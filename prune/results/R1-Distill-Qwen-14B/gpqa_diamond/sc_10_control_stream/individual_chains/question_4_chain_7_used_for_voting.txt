Okay, so I've got this question about Maxwell's equations in a universe where magnets can have isolated North or South poles. Hmm, I remember that in our universe, that's not the case—magnets always have both poles, right? So if in this other universe they can have isolated poles, what does that mean for Maxwell's equations?

Wait, Maxwell's equations are four in total. Let me think about each one. The first one is about the divergence of the electric field. Oh right, Gauss's law for electricity. That equation relates charge density to the electric field. I don't think that would change if we have isolated magnetic poles because that's about electric charges, not magnetic ones.

The second equation is about the circulation of the electric field, which is Faraday's law of induction. It deals with changing magnetic fields and induced electric fields. But wait, if there are isolated magnetic poles, maybe that affects something else. Or does it?

The third equation is Gauss's law for magnetism, which states that the divergence of the magnetic field is zero. In our universe, this is true because magnetic monopoles don't exist. So if in this universe they do exist, the divergence of B wouldn't be zero anymore. That equation would have to change. So that's one equation that would alter.

The fourth equation is Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition, which involves the curl of the magnetic field and the current. But if magnetic monopoles exist, does that affect this? Wait, Ampère's law relates the curl of H to the current plus the displacement current. I think the presence of monopoles would modify Ampère's law as well. Or wait, maybe not. Because Ampère's law relates to how the magnetic field circulates around currents. If you have monopoles, perhaps the divergence of B isn't zero and that affects other equations.

Wait, let me think again. Maxwell's equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀ (Gauss's law for E)
2. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t (Faraday's law)
3. ∇·B = 0       (Gauss's law for B)
4. ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t (Ampère's law with Maxwell's term)

In our universe, equation 3 holds because there are no isolated magnetic charges. If in this universe, magnetic monopoles exist, equation 3 would change. It would become ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m, where ρ_m is the magnetic charge density. So that's one equation that's different.

What about the others? Equation 1 deals with electric charges, so probably stays the same. Equation 2 is about induced E fields from changing B, which doesn't directly involve monopoles, so maybe it remains the same. Equation 4 is Ampère's law. Wait, Ampère's law includes the current density J and displacement current. If there are magnetic monopoles, does that affect the current? Because monopoles would have a kind of magnetic current. So maybe equation 4 would change as well.

Wait, Ampère's law is about the curl of H. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, would H's equation change? Or maybe the other way around. Let me think: If monopoles exist, the divergence of B is non-zero, which would affect equation 3. But Ampère's law deals with the curl, not the divergence. So equation 4 might not change. Or maybe equation 2 might change? Because if there's a magnetic charge, maybe the way B changes would induce E fields differently?

Alternatively, another approach: Maxwell's equations in the presence of magnetic monopoles. I think that when magnetic monopoles exist, two of Maxwell's equations change. Because Gauss's law for B changes, and Ampère's law also changes to include magnetic current. Or maybe not Ampère's law, but another equation.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look up a reference in my mind. Oh right, in theories that include magnetic monopoles, two equations are modified: the divergence of B is no longer zero, and another equation—maybe Ampère's or Faraday's—changes as well.

Wait, Gauss's law for B becomes non-zero, which is equation 3. Then, Ampère's law (equation 4) is about the curl of H, which would relate to the current density. But if there are magnetic currents, maybe that equation changes. Alternatively, maybe Faraday's Law (equation 2) would have a term related to the time derivative of some magnetic current.

Wait, no. Faraday's law describes the induced electric field from a changing magnetic field. If there are magnetic monopoles, the time derivative of B would still be involved. So maybe equation 2 doesn't change. Let me think again.

Alternatively, I remember that when magnetic monopoles are present, the modified Maxwell's equations have two changes: the divergence of B is no longer zero, and the curl of E is no longer just the negative time derivative of B. Because in the presence of a magnetic current, the curl of E would include a term related to the magnetic current density.

Wait, let me get this straight. If magnetic monopoles exist, then equation 3 changes to ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m. And equation 2, Faraday’s law, which is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t, would not have a term with magnetic current. Or does it?

Wait, no. Wait, Ampère's law is about the curl of H. Wait, no, equation 2 is about the curl of E. So equation 2 is about induced E fields due to changing B. But if there are magnetic monopoles, maybe that affects the time derivative of B? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the other Maxwell equation that changes is Ampère's law. Because Ampère's law includes the term for the displacement current, which is ∂D/∂t. But if there's a magnetic current, perhaps a new term is added. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, when magnetic monopoles are present, Maxwell's equations are modified in two ways. The divergence of B is no longer zero, and the curl of E is no longer just the time derivative. Let me think: in the presence of monopoles, you can have a magnetic current, so the curl of E would have a term involving the magnetic current density.

So equation 2 (curl E) would have an additional term. Let me think about the form. In standard Maxwell's equations, equation 2 is ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. With magnetic monopoles, perhaps it becomes ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m, where J_m is the magnetic current density. Or maybe with a different coefficient. So equation 2 would change.

So equation 3 (∇·B = 0) becomes ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m.

Equation 2 would change to include J_m.

So which options are we looking for? The question is asking which equations are different.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The one related to divergence of magnetic field. So equation 3 is different. But which others?

Option B: The ones related to circulation of electric field (equation 2) and divergence of magnetic field (equation 3). So two equations.

Option C: The ones related to circulation of magnetic field (equation 4?) and flux of electric field. Hmm, not sure.

Option D: The ones related to divergence and curl of B. So equations 3 and 4.

Wait, equation 4 is the curl of H, which relates to currents. If equation 4 changes, it would be because of the presence of magnetic current. Or no? I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.

In standard Maxwell, equation 3 says ∇·B = 0. With monopoles, equation 3 becomes ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m. That's one change.

Equation 2, ∇×E = -∂B/∂t. If there's a magnetic current, then perhaps ∇×E would have another term. Or maybe not. Let me think about the four-force. Or maybe the other equation that changes is Ampère's law. Wait, Ampère's law is equation 4: ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t. If I have a magnetic current, perhaps there is another term in that equation.

Wait, I'm not too confident. Alternatively, perhaps in the presence of magnetic monopoles, both Gauss's law for B (∇·B) and Ampère's law change. Because Ampère's law would involve not just the electric current but also the magnetic current.

Alternatively, let's think about the structure. Without monopoles, the four equations are:

1. ∇·E = ρ/ε₀
2. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t
3. ∇·B = 0
4. ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t

With monopoles, equation 3 becomes ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m.

Equation 4 would become ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t + something involving the magnetic current.

Wait, perhaps equation 4 is ∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t + J_m. Or maybe equation 2 is the one that gains a term.

Alternatively, perhaps equation 2 would have an extra term. For example, ∇×E = -∂B/∂t + J_m. Or maybe not. Wait, let's think about symmetry. If electric charges have Gauss's law and a certain form in Ampère's law, perhaps magnetic monopoles would have a symmetric treatment.

In the standard case, the equations are symmetric except for the time derivatives and the absence of magnetic charges. So if you have magnetic charges, the equations become more symmetric.

So maybe equation 2 and equation 3 change. Because equation 3's divergence of B becomes non-zero, and equation 2's curl of E would have another term. Let's see.

Wait, another approach: The Maxwell equations in a theory with magnetic monopoles. According to what I remember, the equations become:

1. ∇·E = ρ_e / ε₀ (unchanged)
2. ∇×E = -∂B/∂t - J_m (added magnetic current)
3. ∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m (changed)
4. ∇×B = μ₀ ε₀ ∂E/∂t + μ₀ J_e (unchanged except for J_e)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps equation 4 also changes to include the magnetic current. So equations 2 and 3 change, making option B correct.

Wait, let me think about another perspective. In the presence of magnetic monopoles, the divergence of the magnetic field is non-zero, so equation 3 is modified. Also, the curl of the electric field equation (equation 2) should include a term from the magnetic current, because changing B can come from both time variation and the presence of a current.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think that in the presence of monopoles, two of the equations change: equation 3 (div B) and equation 2 (curl E). So the correct option would be B: the ones related to the circulation of the electric field and the divergence of the magnetic field.

In a universe where magnetic monopoles exist, Maxwell's equations would differ from their standard form in our universe. In our universe, the divergence of the magnetic field (∇·B) is zero because magnetic monopoles do not exist. However, in a universe with magnetic monopoles, the divergence of the magnetic field would no longer be zero, as it would be proportional to the magnetic charge density (∇·B = μ₀ ρ_m). This modifies the third of Maxwell's equations.

Additionally, the circulation of the electric field (∇×E) would also change. In the standard form, Faraday's law states that ∇×E = -∂B/∂t, which describes the induction of electric fields by changing magnetic fields. However, in the presence of magnetic monopoles, the electric field would also be influenced by magnetic currents, introducing an additional term related to the magnetic current density (J_m). This modifies the second of Maxwell's equations.

The other two equations—Gauss's law for the electric field (∇·E = ρ/ε₀) and Ampère's law with Maxwell's addition (∇×H = J + ∂D/∂t)—remain largely unchanged, as they pertain to electric charges and currents, which are not directly affected by the existence of magnetic monopoles.

Thus, the two equations that are different in this scenario are the ones related to the divergence of the magnetic field and the circulation of the electric field.
