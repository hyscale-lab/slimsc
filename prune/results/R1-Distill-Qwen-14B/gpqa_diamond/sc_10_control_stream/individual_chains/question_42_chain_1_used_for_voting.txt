Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about three exoplanets, Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They were discovered using the TTV method, which I remember stands for Transit Timing Variations. But I'm not sure how that affects this problem, so maybe I can ignore that part for now.

The problem gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. So, T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3. So if I multiply those, T1/T3 would be 1.4 * 2.3, which is about 3.22.

But wait, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula I recall is T = T_star * (L/L_sun)^(1/4) * (d/1AU)^(-1/2). Wait, no, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star. So T is proportional to (L)^(1/4) * (d)^(-1/2). But if all the planets are orbiting the same star, the L is constant, so T is proportional to d^(-1/2). So T ∝ d^(-1/2).

But wait, the problem gives me the temperature ratios, so maybe I can relate that to the distances. Let me see. If T1 is 1.4 times T2, then (d1/d2)^(1/2) = T2/T1. Because T ∝ d^(-1/2) → d ∝ T^(-2). Hmm, let me think again.

Wait, T is proportional to (L/(16πσd^2))^(1/4), where L is star's luminosity, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, but since L is same for all, T ∝ (1/d^2)^(1/4) = 1/d^(1/2). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(d). So d ∝ 1/T^2. Wait, no, because T = C / sqrt(d), where C is a constant. So d = (C / T)^2 → but that's not the way to relate ratios.

Wait, since T1/T2 = 1.4, and T is proportional to 1/sqrt(d), then T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1) → because T1 = C / sqrt(d1), T2 = C/sqrt(d2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1). So 1.4 = sqrt(d2/d1) → (d2/d1) = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So d2 = 1.96 * d1. So Planet2 is about 1.96 times farther from the star than Planet1.

Similarly, the ratio T2/T3 is 2.3. So 2.3 = sqrt(d3/d2). Squaring both sides, (T2/T3)^2 = (d3/d2). So (2.3)^2 = d3/d2 → 5.29 = d3/d2 → d3 =5.29 * d2.

So now, let's compute d3 in terms of d1. d3 =5.29 * d2, and d2 =1.96 * d1 → d3=5.29 *1.96 *d1.

Calculating 5.29 *1.96. 5 *2 is 10, but more accurately: 5.29 *2=10.58, minus 5.29*0.04 (since 1.96 is 2-0.04). Wait, 5.29 * 0.04 is 0.2116. So 10.58 - 0.2116 = 10.3684? Wait, wait, that's not the right way. Let me compute 5.29 *1.96 accurately.

5.29 * 1.96 = ?

Let me compute 5*1.96=9.8, 0.29*1.96= approx 0.5684. Adding together: 9.8 + 0.5684=10.3684. So d3=10.3684 *d1.

So the distances are in the ratio d1 : d2 : d3 = 1 : 1.96 : 10.3684.

Now, the problem is to find the orbital period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1. So P3/P1 = ?

I remember Kepler's third law, which states that (P^2)/(a^3) = 4π²/(G(M+m)), but when M is much larger than m (planet mass is negligible), it simplifies to P² ∝ a³/(M), but M is the mass of the star. But in this problem, the masses given are for the planets, not the star. So perhaps the star's mass is much larger, so M is approximately the same for all planets. So Kepler's law for each planet is P² ∝ a³.

So for each planet, P² = k * a³, where k is same for all since same star.

Therefore, the ratio P3/P1 would be sqrt( (a3/a1)^3 ).

But wait, because a is the semi-major axis, which is the same as d in this case, since the orbits are circular. So a = d.

So, a3/a1 =10.3684. So (a3/a1)³= (10.3684)^3.

Compute (10.3684)^3. Let's compute 10^3=1000. 10.3684 is about 10 +0.3684.

Using the binomial approximation: (10 + x)^3 ≈ 1000 + 3*(10)^2 *x + 3*(10)*(x)^2 + x^3.

x=0.3684.

So 3*100*0.3684= 3*36.84=110.52.

3*10*(0.3684)^2 =30*(0.1357)≈ 4.071.

x^3= (0.3684)^3 ≈ 0.0505.

So total is approximately 1000 + 110.52 +4.071 + 0.0505 ≈ 1114.6415.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Maybe I should calculate 10.3684^3 more accurately.

10.3684 *10.3684 = ?

Compute 10 *10.3684 =103.684, 0.3684 *10.3684 = ~3.81. So 10.3684² ≈ 107.51 (wait, more accurately: 10.3684 *10.3684.

Compute 10 *10 =100, 10*0.3684=3.684, 0.3684*10=3.684, 0.3684*0.3684≈0.1357.

So 10.3684² = (10 + 0.3684)^2 = 100 + 2*10*0.3684 + (0.3684)^2 → 100 + 7.368 +0.1357≈107.5037.

Then, 107.5037 *10.3684 = ?

This is a bit tedious, but let's do it roughly.

107.5037 *10 = 1075.037.

107.5037 *0.3684 ≈ 107.5037 *0.3 =32.2511, 107.5037 *0.0684≈7.360. So total ≈32.2511 +7.360=39.6111.

So total is 1075.037 +39.6111 ≈1114.648.

So 10.3684³≈1114.648.

So (a3/a1)^3=1114.648.

So P3/P1 = sqrt(1114.648) → what's the square root of 1114.648?

Hmm, 33^2=1089, 34^2=1156.

33^2=1089. 33.4^2= (33 +0.4)^2=33² + 2*33*0.4 +0.4²=1089 +26.4 +0.16=1115.56.

Wait, 33.4^2=1115.56, but the value is 1114.648, which is just a bit less. So the square root is just a little under 33.4.

Let me compute 33.38^2.

33.38^2 = ?

33^2=1089.

0.38^2=0.1444.

2*33*0.38=25.08.

So 33.38^2=1089 +25.08 +0.1444=1114.2244.

That's close to 1114.648.

Difference is 1114.648-1114.2244=0.4236.

So each 0.01 increase in x adds about 2*33.38*0.01=0.6676 to x².

So how much more beyond 33.38 do we need to reach 0.4236?

Let Δx be the additional amount beyond 33.38.

So (33.38 + Δx)^2 = 1114.2244 + 2*33.38*Δx + (Δx)^2.

We need this to be ≈1114.648.

So 0.4236 ≈ 2*33.38 * Δx → 66.76 *Δx ≈0.4236 → Δx≈0.4236/66.76 ≈ approx 0.00634.

So x≈33.38 +0.00634=33.3863.

So sqrt(1114.648)≈33.386.

So P3/P1≈33.386.

Wait, but that's a big number. Let me check the options: the options are A) ~10.4, B) ~3.2, C) ~4.4, D) ~33.4.

So option D is about 33.4. So that's our answer?

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the problem gives the mass ratios between the planets. The ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15 (Planet1 is 1.15 times Planet2?), and between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 1.35. So masses: M1/M2=1.15 → M1=1.15 M2. M2/M3=1.35 → M2=1.35 M3. So M1=1.15 *1.35 M3 =1.5525 M3.

But how does this affect the period?

Wait, Kepler's law is P² ∝ a³ / (M_star + M_planet). But if the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_star >> M_planet, so M_planet can be neglected, and P² ∝ a³. So the mass of the planet doesn't affect the period much. So the given mass ratios probably don't impact the orbital period. So the answer is based solely on the distance ratios.

So the orbital period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times that of Planet1, so the answer is D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply Kepler's third law. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star, \( T \propto d^{-1/2} \). Using the temperature ratios provided:

1. **Temperature Ratios and Distances**:
   - \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \) implies \( \sqrt{d_2 / d_1} = 1.4 \), so \( d_2 / d_1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \).
   - \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \) implies \( \sqrt{d_3 / d_2} = 2.3 \), so \( d_3 / d_2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \).

   Combining these, \( d_3 / d_1 = d_3 / d_2 \cdot d_2 / d_1 = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 = 10.3684 \). Thus, \( d_3 = 10.3684 \cdot d_1 \).

2. **Kepler's Third Law**:
   Kepler's third law states \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), where \( a \) is the semi-major axis (equal to the distance \( d \) for circular orbits). Therefore, the ratio of orbital periods is given by:
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{d_3}{d_1}\right)^3}.
   \]

   Substituting \( d_3 / d_1 = 10.3684 \):
   \[
   \left(\frac{d_3}{d_1}\right)^3 = (10.3684)^3 \approx 1114.65.
   \]
   Taking the square root:
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \sqrt{1114.65} \approx 33.4.
   \]

3. **Mass Ratios**:
   The mass ratios between the planets (e.g., \( M_1 / M_2 = 1.15 \) and \( M_2 / M_3 = 1.35 \)) do not significantly affect the orbital period because the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass in Kepler's law.

Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.

Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully. Let me try to break it down.

The problem gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4, and between Planet2 and Planet3 is about 2.3. So, T1/T2 = 1.4 and T2/T3 = 2.3. So if I multiply those, T1/T3 would be 1.4 * 2.3, which is about 3.22.

But wait, equilibrium temperature... I remember that the equilibrium temperature depends on the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula I recall is T = T_star * (L/L_sun)^(1/4) * (d/1AU)^(-1/2). Wait, no, more accurately, the equilibrium temperature is inversely proportional to the square root of the distance from the star. So T is proportional to (L)^(1/4) * (d)^(-1/2). But if all the planets are orbiting the same star, the L is constant, so T is proportional to d^(-1/2). So T ∝ d^(-1/2).

But wait, the problem gives me the temperature ratios, so maybe I can relate that to the distances. Let me see. If T1 is 1.4 times T2, then (d1/d2)^(1/2) = T2/T1. Because T ∝ d^(-1/2) → d ∝ T^(-2). Hmm, let me think again.

Wait, T is proportional to (L/(16πσd^2))^(1/4), where L is star's luminosity, σ is Stefan-Boltzmann constant, but since L is same for all, T ∝ (1/d^2)^(1/4) = 1/d^(1/2). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(d). So d ∝ 1/T^2. Wait, no, because T = C / sqrt(d), where C is a constant. So d = (C / T)^2 → but that's not the way to relate ratios.

Wait, since T1/T2 = 1.4, and T is proportional to 1/sqrt(d), then T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1) → because T1 = C / sqrt(d1), T2 = C/sqrt(d2). So T1/T2 = sqrt(d2/d1). So 1.4 = sqrt(d2/d1) → (d2/d1) = (1.4)^2 = 1.96. So d2 = 1.96 * d1. So Planet2 is about 1.96 times farther from the star than Planet1.

Similarly, the ratio T2/T3 is 2.3. So 2.3 = sqrt(d3/d2). Squaring both sides, (T2/T3)^2 = (d3/d2). So (2.3)^2 = d3/d2 → 5.29 = d3/d2 → d3 =5.29 * d2.

So now, let's compute d3 in terms of d1. d3 =5.29 * d2, and d2 =1.96 * d1 → d3=5.29 *1.96 *d1.

Calculating 5.29 *1.96. 5 *2 is 10, but more accurately: 5.29 *2=10.58, minus 5.29*0.04 (since 1.96 is 2-0.04). Wait, 5.29 * 0.04 is 0.2116. So 10.58 - 0.2116 = 10.3684? Wait, wait, that's not the right way. Let me compute 5.29 *1.96 accurately.

5.29 * 1.96 = ?

Let me compute 5*1.96=9.8, 0.29*1.96= approx 0.5684. Adding together: 9.8 + 0.5684=10.3684. So d3=10.3684 *d1.

So the distances are in the ratio d1 : d2 : d3 = 1 : 1.96 : 10.3684.

Now, the problem is to find the orbital period ratio between Planet3 and Planet1. So P3/P1 = ?

I remember Kepler's third law, which states that (P^2)/(a^3) = 4π²/(G(M+m)), but when M is much larger than m (planet mass is negligible), it simplifies to P² ∝ a³/(M), but M is the mass of the star. But in this problem, the masses given are for the planets, not the star. So perhaps the star's mass is much larger, so M is approximately the same for all planets. So Kepler's law for each planet is P² ∝ a³.

So for each planet, P² = k * a³, where k is same for all since same star.

Therefore, the ratio P3/P1 would be sqrt( (a3/a1)^3 ).

But wait, because a is the semi-major axis, which is the same as d in this case, since the orbits are circular. So a = d.

So, a3/a1 =10.3684. So (a3/a1)³= (10.3684)^3.

Compute (10.3684)^3. Let's compute 10^3=1000. 10.3684 is about 10 +0.3684.

Using the binomial approximation: (10 + x)^3 ≈ 1000 + 3*(10)^2 *x + 3*(10)*(x)^2 + x^3.

x=0.3684.

So 3*100*0.3684= 3*36.84=110.52.

3*10*(0.3684)^2 =30*(0.1357)≈ 4.071.

x^3= (0.3684)^3 ≈ 0.0505.

So total is approximately 1000 + 110.52 +4.071 + 0.0505 ≈ 1114.6415.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Maybe I should calculate 10.3684^3 more accurately.

10.3684 *10.3684 = ?

Compute 10 *10.3684 =103.684, 0.3684 *10.3684 = ~3.81. So 10.3684² ≈ 107.51 (wait, more accurately: 10.3684 *10.3684.

Compute 10 *10 =100, 10*0.3684=3.684, 0.3684*10=3.684, 0.3684*0.3684≈0.1357.

So 10.3684² = (10 + 0.3684)^2 = 100 + 2*10*0.3684 + (0.3684)^2 → 100 + 7.368 +0.1357≈107.5037.

Then, 107.5037 *10.3684 = ?

This is a bit tedious, but let's do it roughly.

107.5037 *10 = 1075.037.

107.5037 *0.3684 ≈ 107.5037 *0.3 =32.2511, 107.5037 *0.0684≈7.360. So total ≈32.2511 +7.360=39.6111.

So total is 1075.037 +39.6111 ≈1114.648.

So 10.3684³≈1114.648.

So (a3/a1)^3=1114.648.

So P3/P1 = sqrt(1114.648) → what's the square root of 1114.648?

Hmm, 33^2=1089, 34^2=1156.

33^2=1089. 33.4^2= (33 +0.4)^2=33² + 2*33*0.4 +0.4²=1089 +26.4 +0.16=1115.56.

Wait, 33.4^2=1115.56, but the value is 1114.648, which is just a bit less. So the square root is just a little under 33.4.

Let me compute 33.38^2.

33.38^2 = ?

33^2=1089.

0.38^2=0.1444.

2*33*0.38=25.08.

So 33.38^2=1089 +25.08 +0.1444=1114.2244.

That's close to 1114.648.

Difference is 1114.648-1114.2244=0.4236.

So each 0.01 increase in x adds about 2*33.38*0.01=0.6676 to x².

So how much more beyond 33.38 do we need to reach 0.4236?

Let Δx be the additional amount beyond 33.38.

So (33.38 + Δx)^2 = 1114.2244 + 2*33.38*Δx + (Δx)^2.

We need this to be ≈1114.648.

So 0.4236 ≈ 2*33.38 * Δx → 66.76 *Δx ≈0.4236 → Δx≈0.4236/66.76 ≈ approx 0.00634.

So x≈33.38 +0.00634=33.3863.

So sqrt(1114.648)≈33.386.

So P3/P1≈33.386.

Wait, but that's a big number. Let me check the options: the options are A) ~10.4, B) ~3.2, C) ~4.4, D) ~33.4.

So option D is about 33.4. So that's our answer?

Wait, but wait a second. Wait, the problem gives the mass ratios between the planets. The ratio of the masses between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 1.15 (Planet1 is 1.15 times Planet2?), and between Planet2 and Planet3, it's about 1.35. So masses: M1/M2=1.15 → M1=1.15 M2. M2/M3=1.35 → M2=1.35 M3. So M1=1.15 *1.35 M3 =1.5525 M3.

But how does this affect the period?

Wait, Kepler's law is P² ∝ a³ / (M_star + M_planet). But if the planet's mass is much smaller than the star's, M_star >> M_planet, so M_planet can be neglected, and P² ∝ a³. So the mass of the planet doesn't affect the period much. So the given mass ratios probably don't impact the orbital period. So the answer is based solely on the distance ratios.

So the orbital period of Planet3 is about 33.4 times that of Planet1, so the answer is D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we analyze the given data and apply Kepler's third law. The equilibrium temperature of a planet is inversely proportional to the square root of its distance from the star, \( T \propto d^{-1/2} \). Using the temperature ratios provided:

1. **Temperature Ratios and Distances**:
   - \( T_1 / T_2 = 1.4 \) implies \( \sqrt{d_2 / d_1} = 1.4 \), so \( d_2 / d_1 = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \).
   - \( T_2 / T_3 = 2.3 \) implies \( \sqrt{d_3 / d_2} = 2.3 \), so \( d_3 / d_2 = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \).

   Combining these, \( d_3 / d_1 = d_3 / d_2 \cdot d_2 / d_1 = 5.29 \cdot 1.96 = 10.3684 \). Thus, \( d_3 = 10.3684 \cdot d_1 \).

2. **Kepler's Third Law**:
   Kepler's third law states \( P^2 \propto a^3 \), where \( a \) is the semi-major axis (equal to the distance \( d \) for circular orbits). Therefore, the ratio of orbital periods is given by:
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{d_3}{d_1}\right)^3}.
   \]

   Substituting \( d_3 / d_1 = 10.3684 \):
   \[
   \left(\frac{d_3}{d_1}\right)^3 = (10.3684)^3 \approx 1114.65.
   \]
   Taking the square root:
   \[
   \frac{P_3}{P_1} = \sqrt{1114.65} \approx 33.4.
   \]

3. **Mass Ratios**:
   The mass ratios between the planets (e.g., \( M_1 / M_2 = 1.15 \) and \( M_2 / M_3 = 1.35 \)) do not significantly affect the orbital period because the planet's mass is negligible compared to the star's mass in Kepler's law.

Thus, the orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1.

**Answer: D**
