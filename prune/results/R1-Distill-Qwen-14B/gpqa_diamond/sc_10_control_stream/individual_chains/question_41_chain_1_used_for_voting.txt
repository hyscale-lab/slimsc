Okay, so I'm looking at this physics problem here. Hmm, it's about the speed of light in a moving glass medium. Let me try to break it down.

Wait, the question says a light beam is propagating through glass with index of refraction n. The glass itself is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and towards the observer in the lab. The question is asking what the speed of light in the glass is relative to the observer.

Hmm, right. So, I remember that when light travels through a medium, its speed is c/n, right? Because the index of refraction n is c divided by the speed of light in the medium, v_medium = c/n.

But wait, the glass is moving. So does the motion of the glass affect the speed of light as observed in the lab frame? Oh, this might involve some relativity. Or maybe it's a Doppler effect problem. Or perhaps it's just about adding velocities because the medium is moving.

Wait, but in special relativity, velocities don't just add up linearly. The velocity addition formula is different. So, normally, in Newtonian mechanics, if an object is moving at speed u in a medium that's moving at speed v, the object's speed relative to the medium is u', but when the medium itself is moving relative to the lab, you have to use the velocity addition formula.

But wait, the light is moving through the glass, which is itself moving. So the light's speed in the glass is v_glass = c/n (relative to the glass). But since the glass is moving, how does that affect the observed speed in the lab?

Alternatively, think about the lab frame. The glass is moving at velocity v towards the observer. The light is moving in the same direction as the glass, as per the problem statement. So from the lab's perspective, the light's speed would be the speed of light in the glass plus the speed of the glass? Or is it more complicated?

Wait, but according to relativity, velocities don't add up that way when you reach speeds comparable to the speed of light. So maybe I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

But wait, in this case, the light's speed in the glass is u = c/n, and the glass is moving at speed v. So in the lab frame, the light's speed would be (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c² )

But wait, the problem states that the speed of light in a vacuum is c=1. So c is 1 here. So u is (1/n), since c is 1. So u = 1/n.

So substituting into the formula, we get:

u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / ( 1 + ( (1/n) * v ) )

Hmm, let me compute that. Let me factor it:

u' = (1 + n v) / (n + n v )

Wait, wait, no. Let me re-express the denominator correctly.

Wait, denominator is 1 + ( (1/n) v )

Hmm, so 1 + (v/n) = (n + v)/n

So the entire expression becomes:

u' = [ (1 + n v ) / (n) ] / [ (n + v)/n ) ] 

Wait, no, let me do it step by step.

u = (1/n), v is the glass's speed.

u' = [ (1/n ) + v ] / [ 1 + ( (1/n ) * v ) ]

Which is equal to [ (1 + n v ) / n ] / [ (n + v ) / n ]

Because the denominator is 1 + (v/n ) = (n + v)/n.

So when you divide these two fractions, the n in the numerator and denominator cancel out.

So u' = (1 + n v ) / (n + v )

Wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options.

Option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v). Option B is 1, but that can't be right because if the glass moves, the light speed shouldn't be 1. So the correct answer would be A.

Wait, but wait a second. Is this correct? Because the speed of light in the medium is u = 1/n, and then the medium is moving at v. So the observed speed of the light in the lab is u' = (u + v)/(1 + (u v)/c² )

But c is 1, so that's (u + v)/(1 + u v )

Which with u = 1/n gives [ (1/n + v) ] / [ 1 + (v/n ) ]

Which simplifies to (1 + n v ) / (n + v ), as before. So yes, option A is the result.

Wait, but I thought in reality, the speed of light in a medium is c/n regardless of the medium's motion. But that's in the rest frame of the medium. So when the medium is moving, the observed speed is different because the medium's motion affects the light's speed in the lab frame.

So, yes, the observed speed would be (1 + n v)/(n + v), which is option A.

But wait, another thought: Is the problem considering relativistic effects? Because if the velocity v is small, then the terms would be approximately 1/n + v, but if v is a significant fraction of c, using the relativistic addition is necessary.

But the problem doesn't specify that v is small, so we have to use the correct formula regardless.

So I think the correct answer is option A.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we consider the following:

1. **Speed of light in the medium**: The speed of light in a medium with refractive index \( n \) is \( u = \frac{c}{n} \). Since \( c = 1 \) in this problem, the speed of light in the glass relative to the glass is \( u = \frac{1}{n} \).

2. **Relative motion of the glass**: The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, toward the observer. To find the speed of light relative to the observer in the laboratory, we use the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   \[
   u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{u v}{c^2}}
   \]
   Substituting \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) and \( c = 1 \), this becomes:
   \[
   u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]

3. **Simplification**: Simplify the numerator and denominator:
   \[
   u' = \frac{\frac{1 + n v}{n}}{\frac{n + v}{n}} = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
   \]

4. **Comparison with options**: The result \( u' = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v} \) matches option A.

Thus, the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory is given by option A.
