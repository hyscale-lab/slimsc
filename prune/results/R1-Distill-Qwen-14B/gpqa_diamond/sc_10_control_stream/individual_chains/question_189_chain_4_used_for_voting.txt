Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about particles and symmetry breaking. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which effective particle is not associated with a spontaneously broken symmetry. The options are A) Phonon, B) Skyrmion, C) Magnon, D) Pion.

First, I remember that spontaneous symmetry breaking leads to the appearance of new particles, which are called Goldstone bosons. These particles are massless or have very low mass, right? Because the symmetry is broken, the vacuum (the ground state) doesn't respect the original symmetry, but the particles themselves are related to that broken symmetry.

So, let's go through each option.

Option D: Pion. I'm pretty sure pions are Goldstone bosons. They arise from the spontaneous symmetry breaking in the strong interaction. The chiral symmetry breaking in QCD leads to pions as the Goldstone bosons. Oh wait, but wait—pions are actually massive because of the explicit symmetry breaking due to quark masses, but I think they're still considered as related to the spontaneous breaking. So D is associated with broken symmetry.

Option B: Skyrmion. Skyrmions are a bit more complex. They are topological solitons in certain field theories, like in the Skyrme model, which is an effective theory for low-energy QCD. Skyrmions are associated with baryon number and are related to the pions. Since pions are Goldstone bosons, Skyrmions might arise from a broken symmetry. So B is probably linked to symmetry breaking.

Option A: Phonon. Phonons are related to the quantized vibrations in a crystal lattice. They arise from the breaking of translational symmetry due to the periodic structure of the crystal. Wait, but is that a spontaneous symmetry breaking? Hmm. Because in a crystal, the translational symmetry is broken explicitly by the lattice structure, not spontaneously. Spontaneous symmetry breaking would be like a phase transition where the system chooses a particular state without an external cause. Phonons are more about the lattice's periodicity, which is an explicit symmetry breaking. So maybe phonons are not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

Option C: Magnon. Magnons are the quasiparticles for spin waves in magnetic materials. They come from the spontaneous breaking of symmetry in magnetic systems. For example, in ferromagnetism, the system chooses a particular direction for magnetization, breaking the rotational symmetry. So magnons are Goldstone bosons in that context, arising from the broken symmetry. So option C is associated with broken symmetry.

So putting it together, the question is which is NOT associated. So the phonon (option A) is linked to explicit symmetry breaking (crystal structure), not spontaneous. The others (Skyrmion, Magnon, Pion) are from spontaneous breaking.

Therefore, the answer should be A) Phonon.

To determine which particle is not associated with a spontaneously-broken symmetry, we analyze each option:

- **Option D: Pion**  
  Pions are Goldstone bosons that arise from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Although they acquire mass due to explicit symmetry breaking from quark masses, they are still linked to the spontaneous breaking of symmetry. Thus, pions are associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

- **Option B: Skyrmion**  
  Skyrmions are topological solitons in the Skyrme model, which is an effective theory for low-energy QCD. They are related to the pions, which are Goldstone bosons of spontaneous symmetry breaking. Therefore, skyrmions are also associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

- **Option A: Phonon**  
  Phonons represent quantized vibrations in a crystal lattice and arise from the breaking of translational symmetry due to the periodic structure of the lattice. This is an explicit symmetry breaking, not spontaneous, as the lattice structure explicitly defines the breaking. Thus, phonons are not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.

- **Option C: Magnon**  
  Magnons are quasiparticles representing spin waves in magnetic materials. They arise from the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry in systems like ferromagnets, where the system chooses a specific magnetization direction. Magnons are Goldstone bosons of this spontaneous symmetry breaking, so they are associated with it.

From this analysis, the particle not associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking is the phonon.
