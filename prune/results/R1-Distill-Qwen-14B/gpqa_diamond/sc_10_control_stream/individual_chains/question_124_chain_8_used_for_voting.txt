Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about particles in a detector and their Lorentz factors. Oh right, Lorentz factors are related to relativity, so I remember they come into play when objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light.

The question says that particles are collided at the center of a spherical detector. New particles are produced, and these are fast-decaying. They travel at ultra-relativistic velocities with a Lorentz factor around 20. On average, one third of these particles reach the inner walls. The radius of the detector is 30 meters. Now, they're asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of the particles reach the inner walls.

Wait, so the initial situation is that with a Lorentz factor of 20, only one third make it. We need to find a higher Lorentz factor where two-thirds make it. So the key here must be how the particles' speed and lifetime affect whether they reach the detector's walls before decaying.

I remember that in relativity, the proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) is shorter than the dilated lifetime in the lab frame. But wait, no, actually, the proper lifetime is the shortest. Oh wait, the lifetime experienced by the particle is shorter compared to the lab frame. So from the lab's perspective, the particle lives longer, allowing it to travel further before decaying.

But how does this affect how many reach the detector's walls? Let me think. The particles are produced at the center of the sphere. So the maximum distance a particle can travel before decaying is its lifetime multiplied by its speed. The detector's radius is 30 meters. So if the particles don't live long enough, they won't reach the wall. The fraction that reaches the wall depends on whether their maximum possible travel distance is enough.

So the particles are moving at a speed such that their Lorentz factor γ is given. The lifetime in the lab frame is γ times the proper lifetime τ. So the proper lifetime is τ, and the lab lifetime is τγ.

The distance a particle can travel before decaying is speed multiplied by time. Speed is approximately the speed of light c, since they're ultra-relativistic. So distance D = c * τγ.

But wait, the particles are moving in all directions, but the detector is a sphere. So the particles that reach the detector walls are those that have a distance D ≥ 30 meters. So the probability of a particle reaching the wall depends on whether it can travel that far before decaying.

But the problem states that on average, one third reach the walls when γ is 20. So I think we can model this with the assumption that the particles are moving isotropically and their decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle lives long enough to reach the wall is determined by the distance.

Wait, perhaps the probability is related to the ratio of the mean decay length to the detector radius. The mean decay length L is c * τγ. The probability that the particle's decay length is at least 30 meters would depend on the ratio 30/L.

Wait, but in particle physics, the decay length is often defined as the average distance a particle travels before decaying. So the probability that the particle reaches a certain distance R is given by the survival probability, which is exp(-R / L), where L is the decay length. Because the decay follows an exponential distribution, the probability that a particle hasn't decayed after traveling a distance R is exp(-R/(c τ γ)).

So the survival probability P is exp(-R/(c τ γ)). We need to find when this probability is about two-thirds, given that at γ=20 it's one third.

Wait, in the first scenario, when γ=20, the survival probability is 1/3. So:

1/3 = exp(-30 / (c τ γ)).

Wait, but when R = 30 m, the survival probability is 1/3. So let's solve for c τ.

But wait, perhaps I should set up the equation. Let me write that as:

At γ1 =20, P1 = 1/3.

P1 = exp( - R / (c τ γ1) ) = 1/3.

We can take the natural log of both sides:

ln(1/3) = - R/(c τ γ1).

Which gives:

R/(c τ γ1 ) = ln(3).

So R = c τ γ1 ln(3) / 1.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps it's better to set up the ratio between the two scenarios. Let's think about the two scenarios: initial γ1=20, P1=1/3; desired γ2=?, P2=2/3.

We can write:

P1 = exp( - R/(c τ γ1) ) = 1/3.

P2 = exp( - R/(c τ γ2) ) = 2/3.

We can take the ratio of the two equations. Let's take ln(P1) and ln(P2):

ln(1/3) = - R/(c τ γ1 )

ln(2/3) = - R/(c τ γ2 )

But perhaps it's easier to take the ratio P2 / P1 = (2/3)/(1/3) )= 2. So:

P2 = 2 * P1.

Wait, but that might not help directly. Alternatively, we can take the ratio of the equations.

Let me write:

ln(P1) = - R/(c τ γ1 )

ln(P2) = - R/(c τ γ2 )

So the ratio γ2/γ1 = [ ln(P1) - ln(P2) ] / ( ln(P1) - ln(P1) )? Hmm, maybe it's better to take the ratio of the two equations.

Let me subtract the two equations.

Wait, let me think again. For P1: 1/3 = exp( - R/(c τ γ1) )

For P2: 2/3 = exp( - R/(c τ γ2) )

Take the natural logs:

ln(1/3) = - R/(c τ γ1 )

ln(2/3) = - R/(c τ γ2 )

So:

ln(1/3) = ln(3)^-1 = - ln(3)

Similarly, ln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) = ln(2/3)

So,

From P1: R/(c τ γ1 ) = ln(3) ≈ 1.0986.

From P2: R/(c τ γ2 ) = ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

Because ln(2/3) is negative, but taking absolute values, perhaps. Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, ln(1/3) is negative. So:

ln(1/3) = - ln(3) ≈ -1.0986.

So equation for P1:

-1.0986 = - R/(c τ γ1 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

1.0986 = R/(c τ γ1 )

Similarly, equation for P2:

ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055 = - R/(c τ γ2 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.4055 = R/(c τ γ2 )

So now, divide the two equations:

(R/(c τ γ1 )) / (R/(c τ γ2 )) ) = (1.0986) / (0.4055 )

Simplify:

(γ2) / (γ1 ) = (1.0986)/(0.4055 )

Compute that: 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.709.

So γ2 = γ1 * 2.709 ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18.

Looking at the options, option A is 54, which is close to this value.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation. Wait, 20 * 2.709 is 54.18, which rounds to 54. So option A is 54. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the equations. Another way: from the two equations:

R = c τ γ1 * ln(3)

R = c τ γ2 * ln(3/2 )

Wait, wait a minute, wait. Let me re-examine.

Wait, when P = 1/3, it's exp(-R/(c τ γ)) = 1/3.

So taking ln of both sides: - R/(c τ γ) = ln(1/3) → R/(c τ γ) = ln(3) ≈ 1.0986.

When P = 2/3, exp(- R/(c τ γ)) = 2/3 → ln(2/3) = - R/(c τ γ) → R/(c τ γ) = ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

So for the first case, R = c τ γ1 * ln(3), and for the second case, R = c τ γ2 * ln(3/2).

But since in both cases, R is the same (30 meters), we can set them equal:

c τ γ1 ln(3) = c τ γ2 ln(3/2 )

Cancel c τ from both sides:

γ1 ln(3) = γ2 ln(3/2 )

Solve for γ2:

γ2 = γ1 * ln(3) / ln(3/2 )

Compute the ratio ln(3)/ln(3/2).

Calculate ln(3) ≈ 1.0986.

ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055.

So ln(3)/ln(3/2) ≈ 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.709.

So γ2 = 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18, which is approximately 54. So option A is 54, which is the answer.

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the survival probability of the particles and their Lorentz factor. The survival probability is given by:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{c \tau \gamma}\right),
\]

where \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \) is the detector radius, \( c \) is the speed of light, \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle, and \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor.

### Step 1: Relating the two scenarios
- For the initial case (\( \gamma_1 = 20 \)), the survival probability is \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} \).
- For the desired case (\( \gamma_2 \)), the survival probability is \( P_2 = \frac{2}{3} \).

Taking the natural logarithm of the survival probabilities:

\[
\ln(P_1) = -\frac{R}{c \tau \gamma_1}, \quad \ln(P_2) = -\frac{R}{c \tau \gamma_2}.
\]

Substituting \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( P_2 = \frac{2}{3} \):

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{R}{c \tau \gamma_1}, \quad \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{R}{c \tau \gamma_2}.
\]

Simplify the logarithms:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\ln(3), \quad \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \ln(2) - \ln(3).
\]

Thus:

\[
-\ln(3) = -\frac{R}{c \tau \gamma_1}, \quad \ln(2) - \ln(3) = -\frac{R}{c \tau \gamma_2}.
\]

### Step 2: Solving for \( \gamma_2 \)
From the first equation:

\[
\frac{R}{c \tau \gamma_1} = \ln(3).
\]

From the second equation:

\[
\frac{R}{c \tau \gamma_2} = \ln(3) - \ln(2).
\]

Dividing the two equations:

\[
\frac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_1} = \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln(3) - \ln(2)}.
\]

Substitute \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \) and \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
\frac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_1} = \frac{1.0986}{1.0986 - 0.6931} = \frac{1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 2.709.
\]

Thus:

\[
\gamma_2 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2.709 = 20 \cdot 2.709 \approx 54.18.
\]

### Step 3: Final answer
The closest option to \( \gamma_2 \approx 54.18 \) is **54**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

So I think we can model this with the assumption that the particles are moving isotropically and their decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability that a particle lives long enough to reach the wall is determined by the distance.

Wait, perhaps the probability is related to the ratio of the mean decay length to the detector radius. The mean decay length L is c * τγ. The probability that the particle's decay length is at least 30 meters would depend on the ratio 30/L.

Wait, but in particle physics, the decay length is often defined as the average distance a particle travels before decaying. So the probability that the particle reaches a certain distance R is given by the survival probability, which is exp(-R / L), where L is the decay length. Because the decay follows an exponential distribution, the probability that a particle hasn't decayed after traveling a distance R is exp(-R/(c τ γ)).

So the survival probability P is exp(-R/(c τ γ)). We need to find when this probability is about two-thirds, given that at γ=20 it's one third.

Wait, in the first scenario, when γ=20, the survival probability is 1/3. So:

1/3 = exp(-30 / (c τ γ)).

Wait, but when R = 30 m, the survival probability is 1/3. So let's solve for c τ.

But wait, perhaps I should set up the equation. Let me write that as:

At γ1 =20, P1 = 1/3.

P1 = exp( - R / (c τ γ1) ) = 1/3.

We can take the natural log of both sides:

ln(1/3) = - R/(c τ γ1).

Which gives:

R/(c τ γ1 ) = ln(3).

So R = c τ γ1 ln(3) / 1.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps it's better to set up the ratio between the two scenarios. Let's think about the two scenarios: initial γ1=20, P1=1/3; desired γ2=?, P2=2/3.

We can write:

P1 = exp( - R/(c τ γ1) ) = 1/3.

P2 = exp( - R/(c τ γ2) ) = 2/3.

We can take the ratio of the two equations. Let's take ln(P1) and ln(P2):

ln(1/3) = - R/(c τ γ1 )

ln(2/3) = - R/(c τ γ2 )

But perhaps it's easier to take the ratio P2 / P1 = (2/3)/(1/3) )= 2. So:

P2 = 2 * P1.

Wait, but that might not help directly. Alternatively, we can take the ratio of the equations.

Let me write:

ln(P1) = - R/(c τ γ1 )

ln(P2) = - R/(c τ γ2 )

So the ratio γ2/γ1 = [ ln(P1) - ln(P2) ] / ( ln(P1) - ln(P1) )? Hmm, maybe it's better to take the ratio of the two equations.

Let me subtract the two equations.

Wait, let me think again. For P1: 1/3 = exp( - R/(c τ γ1) )

For P2: 2/3 = exp( - R/(c τ γ2) )

Take the natural logs:

ln(1/3) = - R/(c τ γ1 )

ln(2/3) = - R/(c τ γ2 )

So:

ln(1/3) = ln(3)^-1 = - ln(3)

Similarly, ln(2/3) = ln(2) - ln(3) = ln(2/3)

So,

From P1: R/(c τ γ1 ) = ln(3) ≈ 1.0986.

From P2: R/(c τ γ2 ) = ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

Because ln(2/3) is negative, but taking absolute values, perhaps. Wait, let me recheck.

Wait, ln(1/3) is negative. So:

ln(1/3) = - ln(3) ≈ -1.0986.

So equation for P1:

-1.0986 = - R/(c τ γ1 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

1.0986 = R/(c τ γ1 )

Similarly, equation for P2:

ln(2/3) ≈ -0.4055 = - R/(c τ γ2 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

0.4055 = R/(c τ γ2 )

So now, divide the two equations:

(R/(c τ γ1 )) / (R/(c τ γ2 )) ) = (1.0986) / (0.4055 )

Simplify:

(γ2) / (γ1 ) = (1.0986)/(0.4055 )

Compute that: 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.709.

So γ2 = γ1 * 2.709 ≈ 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18.

Looking at the options, option A is 54, which is close to this value.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation. Wait, 20 * 2.709 is 54.18, which rounds to 54. So option A is 54. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the equations. Another way: from the two equations:

R = c τ γ1 * ln(3)

R = c τ γ2 * ln(3/2 )

Wait, wait a minute, wait. Let me re-examine.

Wait, when P = 1/3, it's exp(-R/(c τ γ)) = 1/3.

But since in both cases, R is the same (30 meters), we can set them equal:

c τ γ1 ln(3) = c τ γ2 ln(3/2 )

Cancel c τ from both sides:

γ1 ln(3) = γ2 ln(3/2 )

Solve for γ2:

γ2 = γ1 * ln(3) / ln(3/2 )

Compute the ratio ln(3)/ln(3/2).

Calculate ln(3) ≈ 1.0986.

ln(3/2) = ln(1.5) ≈ 0.4055.

So ln(3)/ln(3/2) ≈ 1.0986 / 0.4055 ≈ 2.709.

So γ2 = 20 * 2.709 ≈ 54.18, which is approximately 54. So option A is 54, which is the answer.


To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector's inner walls, we analyze the relationship between the survival probability of the particles and their Lorentz factor. The survival probability is given by:

\[
P = \exp\left(-\frac{R}{c \tau \gamma}\right),
\]

where \( R = 30 \, \text{m} \) is the detector radius, \( c \) is the speed of light, \( \tau \) is the proper lifetime of the particle, and \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor.

### Step 1: Relating the two scenarios
- For the initial case (\( \gamma_1 = 20 \)), the survival probability is \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} \).
- For the desired case (\( \gamma_2 \)), the survival probability is \( P_2 = \frac{2}{3} \).

Taking the natural logarithm of the survival probabilities:

\[
\ln(P_1) = -\frac{R}{c \tau \gamma_1}, \quad \ln(P_2) = -\frac{R}{c \tau \gamma_2}.
\]

Substituting \( P_1 = \frac{1}{3} \) and \( P_2 = \frac{2}{3} \):

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{R}{c \tau \gamma_1}, \quad \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{R}{c \tau \gamma_2}.
\]

Simplify the logarithms:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\ln(3), \quad \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = \ln(2) - \ln(3).
\]

Thus:

\[
-\ln(3) = -\frac{R}{c \tau \gamma_1}, \quad \ln(2) - \ln(3) = -\frac{R}{c \tau \gamma_2}.
\]

### Step 2: Solving for \( \gamma_2 \)
From the first equation:

\[
\frac{R}{c \tau \gamma_1} = \ln(3).
\]

From the second equation:

\[
\frac{R}{c \tau \gamma_2} = \ln(3) - \ln(2).
\]

Dividing the two equations:

\[
\frac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_1} = \frac{\ln(3)}{\ln(3) - \ln(2)}.
\]

Substitute \( \ln(3) \approx 1.0986 \) and \( \ln(2) \approx 0.6931 \):

\[
\frac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_1} = \frac{1.0986}{1.0986 - 0.6931} = \frac{1.0986}{0.4055} \approx 2.709.
\]

Thus:

\[
\gamma_2 = \gamma_1 \cdot 2.709 = 20 \cdot 2.709 \approx 54.18.
\]

### Step 3: Final answer
The closest option to \( \gamma_2 \approx 54.18 \) is **54**, which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A
