Okay, so I've got this science question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Hmm, regularization. I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theory to deal with divergences—like infinite terms that pop up when you calculate certain processes. So regularization is a way to make these calculations finite or manageable, right?

Wait, so the question is which theory doesn't need this regularization when dealing with high energies. High energies usually mean we're probing short distance scales because of the uncertainty principle—so maybe high energy implies looking at the theory at its most fundamental level, where maybe some issues like divergences are absent or handled differently.

Let me think about each option.

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. That's the theory of electromagnetism without quantum mechanics. In classical E&M, do you have any issues with divergences or infinities? I think in electromagnetism, you can have things like the infinite charge density at a point charge, like the electron. But wait, those are more like mathematical artifacts. Also, in Maxwell's equations, you don't have the same kind of infinities that come from loop corrections in quantum theories. Because in QED, for example, you get divergent loop integrals which require renormalization.

So if the question is about whether regularization is needed, then for a classical theory, maybe regularization isn't a thing. Because regularization is a quantum field theory technique. So in classical E&M, you don't need it. So option D might be the correct answer.

Wait, but the question is about high energies. For high energies, does classical E&M break down? Oh right, because at high energies, quantum effects become important, so you need a quantum theory. But the question is about which theory never requires regularization. So if the theory is classical, perhaps it doesn't require regularization because those divergences don't come into play in the same way.

Alternatively, maybe when considering classical E&M as a theory on its own, it doesn't have the same divergences that quantum theories have, so regularization isn't needed. So the answer would be D.

Let me think about the other options. Option C is QED. I know that QED requires renormalization because of the divergences in loop diagrams. So regularization is used as part of the renormalization process. So QED definitely needs regularization, so option C is not the answer.

Option B is Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). QCD is the theory of the strong interaction. It's a non-Abelian gauge theory, and I remember that it does have issues with things like Landau poles at high energies, which suggests that you might need to use techniques like regularization to handle divergences. Also, QCD has asymptotic freedom, but I think it still requires renormalization, so regularization is needed. So B is not the answer.

Option A is Superstring Theory. String theory is an attempt to unify quantum mechanics with general relativity by replacing point particles with strings. I think string theories have to deal with high energies and different dimensional theories. But how does regularization apply? Well, in string theory, some infinities are tamed because the theory is background-dependent or maybe because it's a different framework. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Do string theories require regularization? I think that because they're background-dependent and perhaps have a more complete framework, they might not require the same kind of regularization as in QFT. Or maybe they don't because the perturbative expansions are different. Alternatively, string theories deal with different energy scales and perhaps don't have the same divergences that QED or QCD have. But I'm not 100% certain about this. However, the question is about which theory never requires regularization. If string theory doesn't require it, then A would be the answer. But I'm a bit shaky on this point.

Wait, but string theory is a candidate for a theory that doesn't have the same divergences as QFT. Because in string theory, the perturbative expansion is in terms of strings rather than point particles, which could lead to better behaved theories. So perhaps in string theory, you don't need regularization because the divergences are absent.

But wait, the question is about which theory never requires regularization, regardless of the energy. So if the theory is free from divergences, it doesn't need regularization. But I thought that string theory still has its own issues, but perhaps they are handled without the same kind of regularization techniques, or maybe they don't need it because the theory is finite. Or maybe I'm mixing things up.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the other theories besides classical E&M don't require regularization. Because in QED, QCD, and string theory, you have to deal with divergences, so they require regularization. Only classical E&M, being a non-quantum theory, doesn't have the same issues. But wait, wait—classical E&M isn't a quantum theory, so when we talk about regularization, which is a quantum field concept, it's not applicable. So the statement in the question is: which theory never requires regularization. So for classical E&M, since it's a classical theory, you don't use regularization because it's not part of the framework. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the question is about high energies. At high energies, we'd expect quantum effects to dominate, so the classical theory would break down. But the question is asking about the theory itself, regardless of the energies. Or perhaps, in the high energy limit, certain theories don't require it because the divergences don't occur.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. Among the options, which theory doesn't use regularization at any point. For example, classical E&M doesn't require regularization because it's not a quantum theory. So the answer is D.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options based on their need for regularization, a technique used in quantum field theory to handle divergences (infinite terms) in calculations.

### Option A: Superstring Theory  
Superstring Theory is a candidate for unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity by replacing point particles with strings. While it addresses high energies and operates in a different theoretical framework, it still involves perturbative expansions and infinities that require regularization. Thus, it does require regularization techniques.

### Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)  
QCD is the theory of the strong interaction, describing quarks and gluons. It is a non-Abelian gauge theory and suffers from divergences in loop diagrams, particularly at high energies. Regularization is necessary in QCD to handle these divergences, so it is not the correct answer.

### Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)  
QED is the quantum field theory of electromagnetism. It is well-known for requiring renormalization to deal with divergences in loop integrals. Regularization is an essential part of the renormalization process in QED, so it is not the correct answer.

### Option D: Classical Electrodynamics  
Classical Electrodynamics is the non-quantum theory of electromagnetism. It does not involve the divergences or infinities that arise in quantum field theories like QED, QCD, or Superstring Theory. Since regularization is a quantum field theory concept, it is not required in classical theories. Therefore, classical electrodynamics never requires regularization.

### Conclusion  
Among the given options, only Classical Electrodynamics does not require regularization at high energies because it is a classical theory and does not encounter the divergences that necessitate regularization techniques.
