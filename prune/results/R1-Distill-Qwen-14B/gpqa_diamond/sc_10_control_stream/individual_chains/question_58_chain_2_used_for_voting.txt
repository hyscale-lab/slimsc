Okay, so I've got this question about physical theories and regularization. Hmm. Let me think. The question is asking which theory never requires regularization at high energies. The options are A) Superstring Theory, B) Quantum Chromodynamics, C) Quantum Electrodynamics, D) Classical Electrodynamics.

Wait, I remember that regularization is a technique used in quantum field theories to deal with divergences, right? Like when calculations give infinite results, you need to regularize them to make sense of the math. So regularization is needed when the theory has these kinds of divergences, especially at high energies where the calculations might break down.

Let me go through each option. 

Option D is Classical Electrodynamics. Oh, right! Classical theories don't have the same kind of issues as quantum ones. Wait, but wait—Classical Electrodynamics does have issues like the infinite charge density at the center of a point charge, but that's more of a classical problem. But when you quantize it into QED, which is option C, that's where you get into trouble with divergences. So in classical E&M, maybe you don't need regularization because you're not dealing with the same divergent integrals as in quantum theories.

But wait, the question is about which one never requires regularization. So if a theory is free of such divergences, then it doesn't need regularization.

So, looking at each theory:

- Superstring Theory (A): I think string theory deals with high energies better because it's a theory that incorporates gravity and has a higher energy behavior without the same divergences as in certain quantum field theories. But wait, string theories still might require some form of regularization or maybe they have a different approach to handling high energies. Alternatively, they might not need it because they're background-independent or have different mathematics.

- Quantum Chromodynamics (B): QCD is a quantum field theory. At high energies, the coupling becomes weak (asymptotic freedom), but I think QCD calculations still require renormalization, which includes dealing with divergences, so regularization would be needed.

- Quantum Electrodynamics (C): QED is a quantum field theory which definitely has issues like divergent loop diagrams. So it definitely requires regularization and renormalization techniques.

So the only option left is D, Classical Electrodynamics. Because in classical theory, you don't quantize, so you don't have the same kinds of divergences that require regularization. Or wait, are there any situations where classical E&M needs regularization? Hmm, for example, in the classical treatment of point charges, you get infinities, but those are handled differently, perhaps by redefining charges or using distributions. But in the context of high energy physics, perhaps the question is about the quantum theories.

Wait the question specifically says "at high energies." So in the quantum theories, at high energies, you get issues that require regularization. But in classical theories, even at high energies, perhaps the mathematics don't require regularization because they don't have the same divergences as quantum theories.

So the correct answer would be D, Classical Electrodynamics, because it's a classical theory and doesn't need regularization, unlike the quantum ones which do.

To determine which physical theory never requires regularization at high energies, we analyze the options based on their mathematical frameworks and the necessity of regularization, a technique used to handle divergences in quantum field theories.

- **Option A: Superstring Theory**  
  While superstring theory is a quantum theory that incorporates gravity and high-energy behavior, it often requires regularization or similar techniques to handle divergences, especially in perturbative calculations. Thus, it does not meet the criteria of never requiring regularization.

- **Option B: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)**  
  QCD is a quantum field theory that describes the strong interaction. At high energies, QCD exhibits asymptotic freedom, but it still requires regularization to deal with divergences in calculations. Therefore, it does need regularization.

- **Option C: Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)**  
  QED is another quantum field theory, and it is well-known for requiring regularization to handle divergent loop diagrams. This makes it a theory that does need regularization at high energies.

- **Option D: Classical Electrodynamics**  
  Classical Electrodynamics is a classical theory and does not involve the same divergences that occur in quantum field theories. While it may have classical infinities (e.g., infinite charge density at a point), these are handled differently and do not require the same type of regularization used in quantum theories. Therefore, classical Electrodynamics never requires regularization in the context of high-energy physics.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is **Classical Electrodynamics**, as it is the only theory among the options that does not require regularization at high energies.
