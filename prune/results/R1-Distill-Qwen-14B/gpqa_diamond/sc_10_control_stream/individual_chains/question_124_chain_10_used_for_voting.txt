Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reaches the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm, so I think this has to do with the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls and whether they decay before that. Since the particles are fast-decaying, most of them might decay before traveling the entire distance if their lifetime is too short.

Wait, right. So the particles are produced at the center, so they need to travel a distance equal to the radius of the detector to reach the inner walls. The radius is 30 meters, so the distance is 30 meters.

But wait, because they're moving at relativistic speeds, we have to consider time dilation. The proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma would give the dilated lifetime in the lab frame. If the particle's lifetime is t_proper, then the observed lifetime is gamma * t_proper.

So the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is the distance divided by the speed. But since they're ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately the speed of light, c. So time t = distance / c = 30 m / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds, which is 0.1 microseconds.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 30 / (3e8) is 1e-7, which is 0.1e-6 seconds, so 0.1 microseconds.

So the time t is the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall. The particle's lifetime is gamma * t_proper. If the particle's lifetime is longer than t, then it will reach the wall before decaying. Otherwise, it decays on the way.

In the given scenario, the initial Lorentz factor is gamma = 20, and only one third reach the wall. Wait, no, the initial situation is that when gamma is about 20, one third reach the walls. So probably, that's because the decay length isn't enough for most of them.

Wait, the particles are fast-decaying, so their mean lifetime is short. So the decay length is c * t_half-life or something like that. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying.

In the lab frame, the decay length L is c * gamma * t_proper, where t_proper is the mean lifetime of the particle in its rest frame.

So for a particle to reach the detector wall (30 meters), L must be greater than or equal to 30 meters. The fraction that reach the wall is the probability that the particle hasn't decayed before traveling that distance.

Alternatively, the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability P that a particle hasn't decayed after traveling distance L is exp(-L / L Decay), where L Decay is the decay length.

Wait, no, the decay length L Decay is c * gamma * t_proper. So the probability of a particle surviving to reach the wall is exp(-30 / (c * gamma * t_proper)).

But the problem gives that when gamma is 20, one third reach the wall. So P = 1/3 when gamma = 20.

So that gives us an equation:

1/3 = exp( -30 / (c * gamma * t_proper) )

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure about the relation between gamma and t_proper. Maybe I should think in terms of the time it takes to reach the wall. The time is t = 30 / c.

The proper lifetime is t_proper = t / gamma. So the probability of survival is exp( -t_proper * gamma' ), wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the lifetime of the particle as seen in the lab frame is gamma * t_proper. The time it takes to reach the wall is t = 30 / c. So the probability that the particle hasn't decayed is exp( -t / (gamma * t_proper) ) = exp( -30/(c gamma t_proper) ).

Wait, that makes sense. So in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is longer by gamma, so the probability it survives the travel time t is exp( - t / (gamma t_proper) ).

So when gamma is 20, the probability P is 1/3.

So:

1/3 = exp( - (30/(c)) / (gamma * t_proper) )

Take natural log of both sides:

ln(1/3) = - (30) / (c * gamma * t_proper)

Because 30/(c) is t, so t = 30/(c).

So:

ln(1/3) = - (30) / (c * gamma * t_proper )

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3) = 30/(c gamma t_proper)

So 30/(c gamma t_proper) = ln(3)

So c gamma t_proper = 30 / ln(3)

Hmm. Let's compute ln(3) approximately. ln(3) is about 1.0986.

So 30 / 1.0986 ≈ 27.3 meters.

So c gamma t_proper ≈ 27.3 meters.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the decay length L Decay is c * gamma * t_proper, which is the average distance the particle travels before decaying.

So L Decay = c gamma t_proper ≈ 27.3 meters.

So when gamma is 20, the decay length is 27.3 meters, meaning that on average, the particles decay after 27.3 meters. So when the detector is 30 meters in radius, the probability to reach the wall is P=1/3.

So if we want P to be 2/3, what gamma would we need?

Because for a higher gamma, the decay length L Decay increases. Because L Decay is proportional to gamma.

Wait, wait, no. Because L Decay = c gamma t_proper.

So if gamma increases, L Decay increases. So for higher gamma, the particles are more likely to reach the wall, because their decay length is longer.

So for the initial case, with gamma=20, L Decay ≈ 27.3 meters, so the detector radius is 30 meters.

So the probability is P = exp( -30 / L Decay ) = exp( -30 / 27.3 ) ≈ exp( -1.098 ) ≈ 1/3. Which fits.

Now, in the problem, we need P=2/3. So we need 2/3 = exp( -30 / L Decay )

Taking ln both sides:

ln(2/3) = -30 / L Decay

So 30 / L Decay = -ln(2/3) = ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

So L Decay = 30 / 0.4055 ≈ 74.0 meters.

Wait, wait, because L Decay = c gamma t_proper.

So, using the same formula as before:

30 / L Decay = ln(3/2) → L Decay = 30 / ln(3/2).

Wait, no. Let me re-express:

We have for the first case, L Decay = 27.3 m when gamma=20.

In the second case, we need L Decay to be such that P = 2/3.

So for the second case, P = 2/3 = exp(-30 / L Decay2 )

Taking ln:

ln(2/3) = -30 / L Decay2 → 30 / L Decay2 = -ln(2/3) → 30 / L Decay2 = ln(3/2).

So L Decay2 = 30 / ln(3/2 )

Compute ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

So L Decay2 ≈ 30 / 0.4055 ≈74.0 m.

But L Decay is proportional to gamma, since L Decay = c gamma t_proper.

So L Decay2 = gamma2 * (c t_proper )

But from the first case, L Decay1 = gamma1 * (c t_proper ) = 27.3 m.

So gamma2 = (L Decay2) / (L Decay1) * gamma1.

So gamma2 = (74.0 m) / (27.3 m) * 20 ≈ 2.71 * 20 ≈54.2.

So gamma is approximately 54.

Looking at the options, option A is 54.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again.

Wait, the initial calculation gave us that when gamma=20, L Decay=27.3 m, and P=1/3.

We need to find gamma2 where L Decay2=74.0 m, which is about 2.71 times L Decay1.

So gamma2 = gamma1 * (L Decay2 / L Decay1) = 20 * (74/27.3) ≈20 * 2.71 ≈54.2.

So gamma2 is approximately 54.2, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the ratio.

Wait, the decay length is proportional to gamma. So if we have L Decay2 = (gamma2 / gamma1) * L Decay1.

So gamma2 = (L Decay2 / L Decay1) * gamma1.

L Decay2 is 74, L Decay1 is 27.3.

So 74/27.3 is approximately 2.71.

So 2.71 * 20 = 54.2.

So gamma2 is about 54, which is option A.

So the correct answer is option A:54.

To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the decay length, the probability of survival, and the Lorentz factor.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Decay Length and Probability**:  
   The decay length \( L_{\text{Decay}} \) is proportional to the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) and is given by \( L_{\text{Decay}} = c \gamma t_{\text{proper}} \), where \( t_{\text{proper}} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle. The probability \( P \) that a particle reaches the detector walls is given by:  
   \[
   P = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{L_{\text{Decay}}}\right)
   \]  
   where the detector radius is \( 30 \, \text{m} \).

2. **Initial Case (\( \gamma = 20 \))**:  
   When \( \gamma = 20 \), only one-third of the particles (\( P = \frac{1}{3} \)) reach the walls. Using the formula for \( P \), we find:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{L_{\text{Decay}}}\right)
   \]  
   Taking the natural logarithm:  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{L_{\text{Decay}}}
   \]  
   \[
   L_{\text{Decay}} = \frac{30}{\ln(3)} \approx 27.3 \, \text{m}
   \]  
   Thus, \( L_{\text{Decay}} \propto \gamma \), so \( L_{\text{Decay}} = c \gamma t_{\text{proper}} \), and \( \gamma = \frac{L_{\text{Decay}}}{c t_{\text{proper}}} \). For \( \gamma = 20 \), \( L_{\text{Decay}} \approx 27.3 \, \text{m} \).

3. **Desired Case (\( P = \frac{2}{3} \))**:  
   For \( P = \frac{2}{3} \), we solve:  
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{L_{\text{Decay}}}\right)
   \]  
   Taking the natural logarithm:  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{L_{\text{Decay}}}
   \]  
   \[
   L_{\text{Decay}} = \frac{30}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)} \approx 74.0 \, \text{m}
   \]  

4. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( L_{\text{Decay}} \)**:  
   Since \( L_{\text{Decay}} \propto \gamma \), the ratio of the new Lorentz factor \( \gamma_2 \) to the initial \( \gamma_1 = 20 \) is:  
   \[
   \frac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_1} = \frac{L_{\text{Decay,2}}}{L_{\text{Decay,1}}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( L_{\text{Decay,2}} \approx 74.0 \, \text{m} \) and \( L_{\text{Decay,1}} \approx 27.3 \, \text{m} \):  
   \[
   \gamma_2 = \gamma_1 \cdot \frac{L_{\text{Decay,2}}}{L_{\text{Decay,1}}} = 20 \cdot \frac{74.0}{27.3} \approx 54.2
   \]  

### Conclusion:
The Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls is approximately \( \gamma_2 \approx 54 \).

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about particles being collided at the center of a spherical detector. These particles are new types that decay quickly and travel at ultra-relativistic speeds with a Lorentz factor of about 20. On average, one third of these particles reaches the inner walls of the detector. The detector has a radius of 30 meters. Now, the question is asking what Lorentz factor is needed so that about two-thirds of these particles reach the inner walls.

Hmm, so I think this has to do with the time it takes for the particles to reach the detector walls and whether they decay before that. Since the particles are fast-decaying, most of them might decay before traveling the entire distance if their lifetime is too short.

Wait, right. So the particles are produced at the center, so they need to travel a distance equal to the radius of the detector to reach the inner walls. The radius is 30 meters, so the distance is 30 meters.

But wait, because they're moving at relativistic speeds, we have to consider time dilation. The proper lifetime (the lifetime measured in the particle's rest frame) multiplied by the Lorentz factor gamma would give the dilated lifetime in the lab frame. If the particle's lifetime is t_proper, then the observed lifetime is gamma * t_proper.

So the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall is the distance divided by the speed. But since they're ultra-relativistic, their speed is approximately the speed of light, c. So time t = distance / c = 30 m / (3e8 m/s) = 1e-7 seconds, which is 0.1 microseconds.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 30 / (3e8) is 1e-7, which is 0.1e-6 seconds, so 0.1 microseconds.

So the time t is the time it takes for the particle to reach the wall. The particle's lifetime is gamma * t_proper. If the particle's lifetime is longer than t, then it will reach the wall before decaying. Otherwise, it decays on the way.

In the given scenario, the initial Lorentz factor is gamma = 20, and only one third reach the wall. Wait, no, the initial situation is that when gamma is about 20, one third reach the walls. So probably, that's because the decay length isn't enough for most of them.

Wait, the particles are fast-decaying, so their mean lifetime is short. So the decay length is c * t_half-life or something like that. The decay length is the average distance a particle travels before decaying.

In the lab frame, the decay length L is c * gamma * t_proper, where t_proper is the mean lifetime of the particle in its rest frame.

So for a particle to reach the detector wall (30 meters), L must be greater than or equal to 30 meters. The fraction that reach the wall is the probability that the particle hasn't decayed before traveling that distance.

Alternatively, the decay follows an exponential distribution. The probability P that a particle hasn't decayed after traveling distance L is exp(-L / L Decay), where L Decay is the decay length.

Wait, no, the decay length L Decay is c * gamma * t_proper. So the probability of a particle surviving to reach the wall is exp(-30 / (c * gamma * t_proper)).

But the problem gives that when gamma is 20, one third reach the wall. So P = 1/3 when gamma = 20.

So that gives us an equation:

1/3 = exp( -30 / (c * gamma * t_proper) )

Wait, but wait, I'm not sure about the relation between gamma and t_proper. Maybe I should think in terms of the time it takes to reach the wall. The time is t = 30 / c.

The proper lifetime is t_proper = t / gamma. So the probability of survival is exp( -t_proper * gamma' ), wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the lifetime of the particle as seen in the lab frame is gamma * t_proper. The time it takes to reach the wall is t = 30 / c. So the probability that the particle hasn't decayed is exp( -t / (gamma * t_proper) ) = exp( -30/(c gamma t_proper) ).

Wait, that makes sense. So in the lab frame, the particle's lifetime is longer by gamma, so the probability it survives the travel time t is exp( - t / (gamma t_proper) ).

So when gamma is 20, the probability P is 1/3.

So:

1/3 = exp( - (30/(c)) / (gamma * t_proper) )

Take natural log of both sides:

ln(1/3) = - (30) / (c * gamma * t_proper)

Because 30/(c) is t, so t = 30/(c).

So:

ln(1/3) = - (30) / (c * gamma * t_proper )

Multiply both sides by -1:

ln(3) = 30/(c gamma t_proper)

So 30/(c gamma t_proper) = ln(3)

So c gamma t_proper = 30 / ln(3)

Hmm. Let's compute ln(3) approximately. ln(3) is about 1.0986.

So 30 / 1.0986 ≈ 27.3 meters.

So c gamma t_proper ≈ 27.3 meters.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the decay length L Decay is c * gamma * t_proper, which is the average distance the particle travels before decaying.

So L Decay = c gamma t_proper ≈ 27.3 meters.

So when gamma is 20, the decay length is 27.3 meters, meaning that on average, the particles decay after 27.3 meters. So when the detector is 30 meters in radius, the probability to reach the wall is P=1/3.

So if we want P to be 2/3, what gamma would we need?

Because for a higher gamma, the decay length L Decay increases. Because L Decay is proportional to gamma.

Wait, wait, no. Because L Decay = c gamma t_proper.

So if gamma increases, L Decay increases. So for higher gamma, the particles are more likely to reach the wall, because their decay length is longer.

So for the initial case, with gamma=20, L Decay ≈ 27.3 meters, so the detector radius is 30 meters.

So the probability is P = exp( -30 / L Decay ) = exp( -30 / 27.3 ) ≈ exp( -1.098 ) ≈ 1/3. Which fits.

Now, in the problem, we need P=2/3. So we need 2/3 = exp( -30 / L Decay )

Taking ln both sides:

ln(2/3) = -30 / L Decay

So 30 / L Decay = -ln(2/3) = ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

So L Decay = 30 / 0.4055 ≈ 74.0 meters.

Wait, wait, because L Decay = c gamma t_proper.

So, using the same formula as before:

30 / L Decay = ln(3/2) → L Decay = 30 / ln(3/2).

Wait, no. Let me re-express:

We have for the first case, L Decay = 27.3 m when gamma=20.

In the second case, we need L Decay to be such that P = 2/3.

So for the second case, P = 2/3 = exp(-30 / L Decay2 )

Taking ln:

ln(2/3) = -30 / L Decay2 → 30 / L Decay2 = -ln(2/3) → 30 / L Decay2 = ln(3/2).

So L Decay2 = 30 / ln(3/2 )

Compute ln(3/2) ≈ 0.4055.

So L Decay2 ≈ 30 / 0.4055 ≈74.0 m.

But L Decay is proportional to gamma, since L Decay = c gamma t_proper.

So L Decay2 = gamma2 * (c t_proper )

But from the first case, L Decay1 = gamma1 * (c t_proper ) = 27.3 m.

So gamma2 = (L Decay2) / (L Decay1) * gamma1.

So gamma2 = (74.0 m) / (27.3 m) * 20 ≈ 2.71 * 20 ≈54.2.

So gamma is approximately 54.

Looking at the options, option A is 54.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again.

Wait, the initial calculation gave us that when gamma=20, L Decay=27.3 m, and P=1/3.

We need to find gamma2 where L Decay2=74.0 m, which is about 2.71 times L Decay1.

So gamma2 = gamma1 * (L Decay2 / L Decay1) = 20 * (74/27.3) ≈20 * 2.71 ≈54.2.

So gamma2 is approximately 54.2, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the ratio.

Wait, the decay length is proportional to gamma. So if we have L Decay2 = (gamma2 / gamma1) * L Decay1.

So gamma2 = (L Decay2 / L Decay1) * gamma1.

L Decay2 is 74, L Decay1 is 27.3.

So 74/27.3 is approximately 2.71.

So 2.71 * 20 = 54.2.

So gamma2 is about 54, which is option A.

So the correct answer is option A:54.


To determine the Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls, we analyze the relationship between the decay length, the probability of survival, and the Lorentz factor.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Decay Length and Probability**:  
   The decay length \( L_{\text{Decay}} \) is proportional to the Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) and is given by \( L_{\text{Decay}} = c \gamma t_{\text{proper}} \), where \( t_{\text{proper}} \) is the proper lifetime of the particle. The probability \( P \) that a particle reaches the detector walls is given by:  
   \[
   P = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{L_{\text{Decay}}}\right)
   \]  
   where the detector radius is \( 30 \, \text{m} \).

2. **Initial Case (\( \gamma = 20 \))**:  
   When \( \gamma = 20 \), only one-third of the particles (\( P = \frac{1}{3} \)) reach the walls. Using the formula for \( P \), we find:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{L_{\text{Decay}}}\right)
   \]  
   Taking the natural logarithm:  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{L_{\text{Decay}}}
   \]  
   \[
   L_{\text{Decay}} = \frac{30}{\ln(3)} \approx 27.3 \, \text{m}
   \]  
   Thus, \( L_{\text{Decay}} \propto \gamma \), so \( L_{\text{Decay}} = c \gamma t_{\text{proper}} \), and \( \gamma = \frac{L_{\text{Decay}}}{c t_{\text{proper}}} \). For \( \gamma = 20 \), \( L_{\text{Decay}} \approx 27.3 \, \text{m} \).

3. **Desired Case (\( P = \frac{2}{3} \))**:  
   For \( P = \frac{2}{3} \), we solve:  
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} = \exp\left(-\frac{30}{L_{\text{Decay}}}\right)
   \]  
   Taking the natural logarithm:  
   \[
   \ln\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{30}{L_{\text{Decay}}}
   \]  
   \[
   L_{\text{Decay}} = \frac{30}{\ln\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)} \approx 74.0 \, \text{m}
   \]  

4. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( L_{\text{Decay}} \)**:  
   Since \( L_{\text{Decay}} \propto \gamma \), the ratio of the new Lorentz factor \( \gamma_2 \) to the initial \( \gamma_1 = 20 \) is:  
   \[
   \frac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_1} = \frac{L_{\text{Decay,2}}}{L_{\text{Decay,1}}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( L_{\text{Decay,2}} \approx 74.0 \, \text{m} \) and \( L_{\text{Decay,1}} \approx 27.3 \, \text{m} \):  
   \[
   \gamma_2 = \gamma_1 \cdot \frac{L_{\text{Decay,2}}}{L_{\text{Decay,1}}} = 20 \cdot \frac{74.0}{27.3} \approx 54.2
   \]  

### Conclusion:
The Lorentz factor needed for two-thirds of the particles to reach the detector walls is approximately \( \gamma_2 \approx 54 \).  

Answer: A
