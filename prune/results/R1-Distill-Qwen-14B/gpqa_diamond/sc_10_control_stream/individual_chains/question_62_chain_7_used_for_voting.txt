Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents needed to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Let me first understand what the target molecule is and what reactions are involved.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down. The main structure seems to have a cyclohexane ring, and attached to it is a group that's cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. Also, there's a carbaldehyde group, which is a formyl group (CHO) attached to the cyclohexane.

Starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (C≡CH) attached. So the starting point is a substituted cyclohexane with an alkyne.

I think the reaction pathway involves several steps, possibly including alkyne modifications, functional group transformations, and maybe some oxidation or reduction steps. Let me sketch out possible steps.

First, perhaps the alkyne is functionalized. NaNH2 and methyl chloride could be a possibility. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. Maybe an alkylation step. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond—could that be undergoing some kind of alkylation? Or maybe a substitution.

Wait, NaNH2 is also used in the formation of Grignard reagents. Oh, but methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is a methylating agent. So maybe they're doing a deprotonation followed by alkylation. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is C6H11-C≡CH. Deprotonating that... where would the acidic proton be? The alkyne protons are acidic, but in ethynylcyclohexane, the alkyne is terminal. So maybe the NaNH2 (a strong base) deprotonates the triple bond, making it a cyclohexyl acetylide.

Once we have the acetylide, perhaps we can alkylate it with methyl chloride. But wait, methyl chloride is a primary alkylating agent; maybe it's adding a methyl group to the acetylide.

Wait, but the target molecule has a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So perhaps the acetylide is being converted into an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is being converted into something else.

Let me think about the possible steps. The target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane, which is also attached to another cyclohexane ring. So perhaps we are doing some kind of cyclopropanation or ring expansion? Or perhaps it's a case of adding a substituent and then oxidizing.

Wait, another approach: the target compound has a formyl group (CHO) attached. So maybe we're oxidizing an alcohol to a carbonyl group. That would require an oxidation step. For that, I remember that oxidizing agents like KMnO4 under acidic conditions (H2SO4, HgSO4 as catalyst) can oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but wait, maybe in this case, it's just a formyl group. Or maybe using another oxidizing agent like O3 (ozone) for ozonolysis.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is being converted into a carbonyl group. Let me think: The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (C6H11-C≡CH). If we first convert the triple bond into a ketone, that would give cyclohexylacetophenone or something similar. Wait, but that's not exactly what we have.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated. So, H2 with a catalyst like Pd. That would turn the triple bond into a single bond with two hydrogens added. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane hydrogenated would become cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group? No, wait, adding H2 across the triple bond would make it a single bond, so C6H11-CH2CH3. But that's ethylcyclohexane. Hmm, but that doesn’t immediately lead to the target.

Wait, maybe the triple bond is being converted into a diol. Using H2SO4 and HgSO4 (as in a hydration reaction). So, the triple bond becomes a ketone, but wait, that's more like a hydration of an alkyne to a ketone. Or, maybe using O3 for ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of ethynylcyclohexane would break the triple bond into two carbonyl groups. But then, each end would have a carbonyl. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane is C6H11-C≡CH. Ozonolysis would break the triple bond, and then work up with something like (CH3)2S (which is a reductive workup) would give two ketones? Or maybe something else.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is being converted into an enol, then something else.

Wait, perhaps the first step is deprotonating the alkyne to form an acetylide. Then, using methyl chloride to methylate the acetylide. So the triple bond becomes C≡C-Me. Then, maybe hydrogenating that to CH2-CH2-Me, but that doesn't seem right. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let me look at the options given and see what reagents are used. The options are A, B, C, D. Each has a sequence of 3 or 4 reagents.

Option A: Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride. Step 2: H2/Pd. Step 3: Ba(OH)2. Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, but the options have step 3 as Ba(OH)2, but then step 4 as H2SO4, etc. So maybe four steps?

Wait, perhaps option C: Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride. Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. Step 4: Ba(OH)2.

Hmm, not sure. Let me think about each possible reagent sequence.

The target molecule has a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So perhaps the compound has a hydroxyl group attached to a methyl group, which is attached to a cyclohexane ring, which is also attached to another cyclohexane ring. So maybe this is a case of forming a vicinal diol or some kind of ring expansion.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the alkyne is first converted into a trans-diol. Using H2SO4 and HgSO4 as catalysts, which would hydrate the triple bond to a diol. But wait, the hydration of an alkyne typically gives a ketone, not a diol. Oh wait, no—wait, in some cases, like using H2SO4 and HgSO4, the triple bond can be hydrated to a ketone. So, ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexylacetone, I think, which would be (cyclohexyl)propan-2-one. But the target doesn't have a ketone; it has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is being converted into a carbonyl group, but then modified.

Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, perhaps the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a CH(OH)CH2 group attached, and also a formyl group (CHO) on the same carbon? Or maybe the formyl is on a different position.

Let me try to imagine the structure. So the main cyclohexane ring has two substituents: a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group, and a formyl group. So perhaps it's a cyclohexane with a branch that includes a hydroxymethyl and a formyl.

Wait, maybe it's a case of forming a bicyclic compound or a substituent with a formyl and a hydroxymethyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of forming a cyclohexane ring with a CH(OH)CH2-cyclohexyl group and a formyl group on another carbon.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the possible reactions each reagent would perform.

Looking at the options:

Option C:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: So this is likely deprotonation and alkylation. Deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then methyl chloride would methylate it. So the triple bond becomes C≡C-Me.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: This is hydrogenation, so the triple bond becomes single bond with two hydrogens. So the C≡C-Me would become CH2CH2-Me? Wait, no, hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would give a single bond, so (CH2)2-Me. Wait, no, the triple bond is C≡C, adding two H2 gives double bonds? No, wait, hydrogenation of triple bonds usually goes all the way to single bonds. So the triple bond becomes single bond with two H's added to each carbon.

So after step 2, the structure would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me? Wait, that doesn't make much sense because the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (C6H11-C≡CH). So after methylating to C6H11-C≡C-Me, then hydrogenation would convert that to C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me. So ethyl group attached to the cyclohexane. Then, step 3 is O3 followed by (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis of a single bond? Wait, no, ozonolysis is for alkenes and alkynes. Wait, if after step 2, we have CH2CH2-Me, which is a single bond with maybe a double bond somewhere else? Or perhaps, wait, in step 2, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, so that's just a single bond. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, but that requires a double bond. So maybe after step 2, the molecule is something else.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. After step 1, the triple bond becomes C6H11-C≡C-Me. Step 2 is hydrogenation, which would turn the triple into a single bond, so C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me. Then, step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis on a single bond doesn't do much. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation that leaves a double bond. Wait, but H2/Pd is typically for full hydrogenation. Unless perhaps the conditions are such that not all the hydrogenation occurs. But that's unlikely.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the target molecule again. It's an aldehyde (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane. So perhaps the starting alkyne is being converted into an aldehyde via some steps.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then reduced to an alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a diol, which then undergoes some elimination or oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a Grignard reagent, which is then quenched to form an alcohol. But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liquid NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

NaNH2 and methanol—well, methanol is a methylating agent. So perhaps deprotonation to form acetylide, then quench with methanol would give CH3 group. So step 1 gives C6H11-C≡C-OCH3? No, wait, perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol as an electrophile, giving C6H11-C≡C-OCH3. Then, step 2 is Li and liquid NH3. That's typically a Birch reduction condition, but more commonly, it's used for deprotonation and alkylation. Alternatively, it could be used to form a Grignard-like reagent. Alternatively, maybe it's for alkyne to alkene conversion.

Wait, another possibility: Li in liquid NH3 is used to deprotonate and form a strong base, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's for reducing the alkyne to an alkene. Wait, no. Oh, maybe it's for a cyclopropanation? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, the alkyne is converted to a propargyl alcohol or something. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step in option D is forming a ketone. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methanol is a methylating agent. If the alkyne is deprotonated to form an acetylide, then treated with methanol, which would have an OCH3 group. But I'm not exactly sure how that would add. Maybe it's a substitution.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here, so let me try to think about the target structure. It has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a cyclohexyl-(hydroxymethyl) group, and another substituent which is an aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a trans-diol. Then, the diol is oxidized to a carbonyl group. Or maybe the diol is treated with a base to form a cyclic intermediate.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone, then the ketone is reduced to an alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has both a hydroxymethyl and a formyl group. So maybe the molecule has a CH(OH)CH2 group attached to a cyclohexane, and a CHO group on another carbon.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a benzyl-type compound, then undergoes some kind of elimination or oxidation.

Another approach: Let's consider each reagent in each option and see which sequence makes sense.

Option B: Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride. So again, deprotonate alkyne to acetylide, then ethyl chloride would alkylate it. So C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3? Then step 2 is Li/liq. NH3, which I'm not exactly sure about. Maybe it's for deprotonation or reduction. Step 3: O3 and H2O. Then step 4: NH4OH.

Alternatively, maybe after step 1, the triple bond is converted into a longer chain. Then, step 2 could be a reduction or something else. Ozonolysis would break double bonds, but if step 2 is something else, maybe we have a double bond.

Wait, another thought: Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base and could induce elimination reactions. So perhaps step 2 is dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the first step in option B is a deprotonation and alkylation to make a longer alkyne. Then, step 2 could be a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would break that alkene into two carbonyl groups. Then, step 4 with NH4OH (a mild acid) would perhaps do a workup, maybe leading to some aldehyde groups.

But the target has only one aldehyde group, so maybe that's not the right way.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed via a ring expansion or some kind of addition.

Now, looking at option C: Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride. So the alkyne becomes C6H11-C≡C-Me. Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Hydrogenation of the triple bond to CH2CH2-Me. So now, the molecule is C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me. Then step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis of what? If step 2 gives a single bond, then ozonolysis wouldn't react. So maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a partial hydrogenation, leaving a double bond.

Wait, H2/Pd is usually for full hydrogenation, but perhaps under certain conditions, it can stop at the alkene. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a double bond. But that would require a different catalyst, like Lindlar's for cis addition or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe step 3 is not ozonolysis but some other reaction. Wait, (CH3)2S is a reagent used in reductive workup after ozonolysis. So if step 3 is ozonolysis, then the previous step must have a double bond.

Wait, perhaps in option C, step 2 produces a double bond. How? Oh, maybe the hydrogenation is done in a way that stops at the alkene, but I thought H2/Pd usually goes all the way to single bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different catalyst. Or maybe it's a transfer hydrogenation.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a different reaction. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate could be for hydrogenating a carbonyl group, but that doesn't fit here.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the target molecule again. It's a cyclohexane with a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group and a formyl group. So perhaps the molecule is formed via a coupling reaction, where the alkyne is transformed into an aldehyde and another substituent.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, then reduced to an alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde. So the steps would involve oxidation and reduction.

Wait, but how to get the hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a trans-diol using H2SO4 and HgSO4. Then, the diol is treated with Ba(OH)2, which would cause elimination, perhaps forming a carbonyl group.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base used in the elimination reactions, like the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but more commonly, it's used for epoxide ring openings or for elimination in certain conditions.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could cause a diol to undergo elimination, forming a carbonyl group. So, if the diol is HO-C6H11-CH2-CH2-OH, treating with Ba(OH)2 would eliminate water and form a carbonyl group, giving a ketone. But how does that lead to the target aldehyde?

Wait, perhaps the diol is HO-CH2-C6H11-CH2-OH, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, if the diol is vicinal (adjacent), then elimination would form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a ketone (using H2SO4 and HgSO4), then reduced to a secondary alcohol, then oxidized to a ketone again. Not sure.

Wait, let me try to think about each option's possible reactions.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: form an acetylide, then methylate to C6H11-C≡C-Me.
2. H2/Pd: hydrogenate triple bond to single bond, giving C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me.
3. Ba(OH)2: perhaps elimination, but on what? If the molecule is ethylcyclohexane, Ba(OH)2 might not do much. Unless there's an alcohol present.
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: this is the Jones oxidation condition, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but maybe in this case, it's used for something else.

Hmm, not seeing it.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: form C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3.
2. Li/liq NH3: could be a Birch reduction, but more likely a deprotonation or alkylation.
3. O3, (CH3)2S: ozonolysis, which would break any double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. NH4OH: workup.

So, after step 1, we have a longer alkyne. Step 2, maybe Li in NH3 induces elimination, forming a double bond. Then ozonolysis would break that double bond into two carbonyl groups. But how does that form the target molecule?

Alternatively, if the alkyne is first converted to an alkyne with an ethyl group, then step 2 could form a double bond, which is then ozonolyzed into two carbonyl groups. Then, workup with NH4OH could form aldehyde or ketone groups.

But the target molecule has both a formyl and a hydroxymethyl group attached to cyclohexane. So perhaps one of the ozonolysis products is a formyl group and another part is a diol. Hmm.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: form C6H11-C≡C-Me.
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate triple bond to single bond, so CH2CH2-Me.
3. O3, (CH3)2S: but no double bond, so can't do ozonolysis. Hmm, maybe step 2 doesn't hydrogenate fully. Maybe it stops at a double bond? But I thought H2/Pd usually goes all the way.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a transfer hydrogenation. Alternatively, perhaps the H2 is used in a different way.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: form acetylide, then quench with methanol; would that give C6H11-C≡C-OCH3? Or maybe a substitution, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's more about forming a ketone.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 is a strong base and can deprotonate the alkyne. Methanol may then act as an electrophile, but I'm not certain how that would proceed. Maybe it's adding a hydroxymethyl group.

Then, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3: perhaps this is a Birch reduction, which would reduce aromatic rings but not sure if applicable here. Alternatively, it could be a deprotonation step leading to some elimination.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for deprotonation and alkylation again, adding another group.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 in option D is ozonolysis, but without a double bond, it wouldn't do anything. So maybe the earlier steps form a double bond.

Wait, maybe after step 1, the alkyne is converted into an alkyne with an OCH3 group, then step 2 is Li in NH3, which could induce some elimination, forming a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would break that into carbonyl groups.

But I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the target again. The structure has a cyclohexyl-(hydroxy)methyl group and a formyl group. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding a hydroxymethyl group and a formyl group to the cyclohexane.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the alkyne is first converted into a benzyl-type compound, then undergoes some kind of annulation or addition to form the rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a Grignard reagent, which is then quenched to form an alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

But I'm not connecting the steps.

Wait, let's think about the possible order of reactions. The triple bond could be converted into a carbonyl group via hydration. Then, that carbonyl could be reduced to an alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

But the target has two different substituents, so maybe the starting alkyne is used to form a longer chain that can then be split into two parts via ozonolysis to form the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, for example, if the alkyne is converted into a longer chain with a carbonyl group, then ozonolysis could break it into two aldehydes. But how to get the hydroxymethyl part.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl group, and another part is reduced to a hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted via hydrogenation into a single bond, then undergoes some kind of ring-opening or addition.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide.
2. Alkylation to add a methyl group.
3. Hydrogenation to form a single bond.
4. Ozonolysis to break into carbonyl groups.
5. Workup to form aldehyde and alcohol.

But I'm not matching this with the options.

Looking at option C:

Steps: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → acetylide methylated.
2. H2/Pd-c → hydrogenate triple bond.
3. O3, (CH3)2S → but without a double bond, nothing happens.
4. Ba(OH)2 → not sure.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps option C has another approach. Let me think: After step 1, the molecule is C6H11-C≡C-Me. Step 2 is hydrogenation to C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me. Now, perhaps step 3 is ozonolysis, but that requires a double bond. So maybe I'm missing a step that introduces a double bond.

Wait, perhaps during step 2, the hydrogenation doesn't go to completion, leaving a double bond? But I thought H2/Pd fully hydrogenates triple bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is stopped at the alkene stage, but that requires a different catalyst, like Lindlar's, which is poisoned to stop at cis addition. So maybe step 2 in option C is not full hydrogenation. But the catalyst is Pd, which usually goes to full hydrogenation.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about each reagent's typical use.

NaNH2 and methyl chloride: likely deprotonation and alkylation to form an acetylide and then a methyl group addition. So the triple bond becomes C≡C-Me.

H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: probably hydrogenates the triple bond to single bond, making CH2-CH2-Me.

O3 and (CH3)2S: Ozonolysis, but if the molecule is now C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me, then there's no double bond. So this can't be right. So perhaps this option is incorrect.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe the triple bond is converted into a ketone. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol could be a methylating agent, but perhaps it's used in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step forms a Grignard reagent. NaNH2 can deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, and then methanol might react as an electrophile. But I'm not sure.

Step 2: Li in liq NH3. Maybe this is a Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings to diols, but our starting material isn't aromatic. Alternatively, it could be a deprotonation to form a strong base, leading to elimination.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis again, but unless there's a double bond, it's not useful.

So, perhaps option D isn't the right sequence either.

Going back, maybe the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne with NaNH2 to form an acetylide.
2. Quench with a methylating agent (methyl chloride) to add a methyl group, making C6H11-C≡C-Me.
3. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond (using H2/Pd), making C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me.
4. Ozonolysis won't work, so perhaps another step.

Wait, perhaps the next step is Ba(OH)2, which can cause elimination. If the molecule is C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me, perhaps Ba(OH)2 isn't doing much. Alternatively, maybe after hydrogenation, the molecule undergoes some kind of oxidation or reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the target requires a ring-opening or some kind of aldehyde formation via oxidation.

Wait, another angle: The target molecule has a formyl group. Formyl groups can be formed by oxidizing primary alcohols. So perhaps the pathway includes forming a primary alcohol, then oxidizing it.

So, starting from ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a primary alcohol. How?

Hydration of the alkyne in acidic conditions with HgSO4 would give a ketone, which can then be reduced to a secondary alcohol. Alternatively, using a different reagent, perhaps the alkyne can be converted into an aldehyde.

Wait, maybe using O3 for ozonolysis of the alkyne. Ozonolysis of an internal alkyne would give two carbonyl groups. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne. Ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne would give a ketone and an aldehyde. Because the terminal alkyne (R-C≡CH) would, upon ozonolysis, give R-C=O and HCHO. But wait, in the presence of (CH3)2S as a reductive workup, perhaps the aldehyde would be preserved, while the other part would be a ketone.

So, for example, ethynylcyclohexane (C6H11-C≡CH) upon ozonolysis with (CH3)2S would break into C6H11-C=O and HCHO. So, one part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C6H11-CO-CHO?), no, wait, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, ozonolysis of R-C≡C-R’ would produce R-O and R’-O, but for a terminal alkyne R-C≡CH, ozonolysis would give R-C=O and H-C=O. But with (CH3)2S as a reductive workup, the aldehyde would be formed. So, ethynylcyclohexane would break into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C6H11-CO-CHO?) No, wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne R-C≡CH would yield R-C=O and HCHO (formaldehyde). So, if R is cyclohexyl, then we would get cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde (C6H11-CO-CHO?), but wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the correct product would be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and formaldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the correct product is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C6H11-CHO) and formaldehyde (HCHO). So, after ozonolysis, you would have two carbonyl compounds: one being the aldehyde from the alkyne and the other formaldehyde.

But how does that help in forming the target molecule, which is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde?

Hmm, perhaps the target is formed by combining the aldehyde and another part. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Another thought: Maybe after ozonolysis, the aldehyde is further modified. For example, the aldehyde could be reduced to a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a carboxylic acid or remains as an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde group is where the formyl group in the target comes from.

Wait, looking back at the target molecule: it's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, on the cyclohexane ring, there's a substituent that is a cyclohexyl group connected via a hydroxymethyl group, and also a formyl group.

So perhaps the formyl comes from ozonolysis, and the hydroxymethyl comes from another part.

But I'm not getting it. Let me think about each option again and see which sequence logically leads to the target.

Option C: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → form C6H11-C≡C-Me.

2. H2/Pd-c → hydrogenate triple to single, making C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → but no double bond, so no reaction.

4. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination, but on what?

Wait, perhaps step 4 is a way to form a carbonyl group. For example, Ba(OH)2 could cause elimination of water, forming a double bond. But in the molecule after step 2, it's C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me. No hydroxyl groups present, so Ba(OH)2 wouldn't do much. So this sequence doesn't seem right.

Option B: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li/liq NH3 → maybe deprotonate and eliminate, forming a double bond.

3. O3, H2O → ozonolysis of the double bond.

4. NH4OH → workup, maybe to form aldehydes.

So, after step 2, the molecule has a double bond. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Then, in step 4, those would become aldehydes or ketones.

But the target has both an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps one part becomes the aldehyde, and the other part becomes an alcohol, which is then oxidized. But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Alternatively, maybe the ethyl group is involved in forming the hydroxymethyl.

Hmm.

Another approach: Let's look for the correct sequence of reactions.

The target has a formyl group, which suggests that somewhere, an oxidation of a primary alcohol must have occurred. So perhaps the steps should include converting an alcohol to an aldehyde.

So, perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into a diol, then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has a hydroxymethyl group, which is an alcohol. So maybe we need a step that forms an alcohol, which is then converted into a hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve adding a methyl group, then oxidizing.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis to break a double bond (but how is the double bond formed? Maybe from an elimination step.)

4. Workup to form an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence in option C is:

1. Acetylide methylated.

2. Hydrogenate to single bond.

3. Ozonolysis can't react, so no.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm a bit stuck. So perhaps I should look for the correct reagent sequence that would form the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group.

Another thought: The target has a formyl group, which could be formed by oxidizing a primary alcohol. So, perhaps somewhere in the steps, an alcohol is formed and then oxidized.

So, looking for a sequence that includes a reduction step to form an alcohol and then an oxidation step to form the aldehyde.

Looking through the options:

Option B: Steps include O3, which could form carbonyl groups, and then NH4OH, which is a mild acid.

Option C: includes O3 but no obvious alcohol formation.

Option D: includes O3 but again, not seeing the connection.

Wait, option D's step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this forms a ketone, then step 2 is Li in NH3 which could reduce the ketone to an alcohol. Then step 3 is ozonolysis, which doesn't apply, so probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me think again.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → C6H11-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: H2/Pd-c → C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: O3, (CH3)2S → but no double bond, so nothing.

Hmm, but maybe I'm missing something. What if after step 2, the molecule is C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me, and then step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which does elimination to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can cause elimination of water if there's an alcohol present. But in this molecule, after step 2, there's no hydroxyl group. So Ba(OH)2 wouldn't do much.

Alternatively, maybe step 4 in option C is Ba(OH)2, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to first form an aldehyde via ozonolysis, then add a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C because it includes ozonolysis, which would form the aldehyde, and some other step would form the hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another thought: The target has a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So perhaps the hydroxymethyl is formed from an epoxide opening, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxymethyl comes from a Grignard addition to a carbonyl.

But without a clear path, I'm not making progress.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Option C includes ozonolysis, which seems relevant for forming a carbonyl group, which would then become the aldehyde. But without a double bond, ozonolysis doesn't work. So perhaps the prior step introduces a double bond.

Wait, perhaps step 2 in option C is not full hydrogenation. If the hydrogenation is stopped at the alkene, then ozonolysis would work. But I thought H2/Pd would fully hydrogenate the triple bond.

Alternatively, the H2/Pd-c could be a transfer hydrogenation, not fully hydrogenating the triple bond.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate and methylate the alkyne.

2. Partially hydrogenate to an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form two aldehydes.

4. Use Ba(OH)2 to form a hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, because it's the only one that includes ozonolysis and then Ba(OH)2, which could be used to form the hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: the target has a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group (CH(OH)R).

So, perhaps the steps are:

- Convert the alkyne to a diol.

- Then, oxidize one part to a carbonyl (formyl) and reduce another part to a hydroxymethyl.

But without knowing the exact steps, it's hard.

Given the time I've spent, I'll make a guess. Based on the reagents, option C seems to include ozonolysis, which is likely needed to form the aldehyde. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

The question involves identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule contains a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a formyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which is then methylated to C₆H₁₁-C≡C-Me.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in C₆H₁₁-CH₂-CH₂-Me.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, typically used for elimination or epoxide opening, but no clear reaction pathway is apparent here.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Oxidation conditions, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with an ethyl group, forming C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₂CH₃.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely induces elimination or reduction, potentially forming a double bond.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis would break a double bond into carbonyl groups, but the sequence does not clearly explain how the hydroxymethyl group is formed.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild acid for workup, but the pathway remains unclear.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and methylates it, forming C₆H₁₁-C≡C-Me.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in C₆H₁₁-CH₂-CH₂-Me.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is absent after step 2. This step seems irrelevant unless the hydrogenation is incomplete, which is unlikely.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, but no clear reaction pathway is apparent here.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne and quenches it with methanol, potentially forming a ketone or an alcohol.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely induces elimination or reduction, but the exact reaction is unclear.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is not evident in the sequence.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild acid for workup, but the pathway does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
The target molecule contains both a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The formyl group suggests an oxidation step, possibly involving ozonolysis, but this requires a double bond. However, none of the options provide a clear and logical sequence of reactions to achieve the target molecule. Among the options, **Option C** includes ozonolysis, which is relevant for forming carbonyl groups, but the sequence does not fully align with the target structure. Despite some uncertainties, **Option C** is the most plausible choice based on the reagents provided.

Answer: C

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this organic chemistry problem. The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents needed to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Let me first understand what the target molecule is and what reactions are involved.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, that's a bit of a mouthful. Let me break it down. The main structure seems to have a cyclohexane ring, and attached to it is a group that's cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl. Also, there's a carbaldehyde group, which is a formyl group (CHO) attached to the cyclohexane.

Starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (C≡CH) attached. So the starting point is a substituted cyclohexane with an alkyne.

I think the reaction pathway involves several steps, possibly including alkyne modifications, functional group transformations, and maybe some oxidation or reduction steps. Let me sketch out possible steps.

First, perhaps the alkyne is functionalized. NaNH2 and methyl chloride could be a possibility. NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in deprotonation reactions. Maybe an alkylation step. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane has a triple bond—could that be undergoing some kind of alkylation? Or maybe a substitution.

Wait, NaNH2 is also used in the formation of Grignard reagents. Oh, but methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is a methylating agent. So maybe they're doing a deprotonation followed by alkylation. Wait, but ethynylcyclohexane is C6H11-C≡CH. Deprotonating that... where would the acidic proton be? The alkyne protons are acidic, but in ethynylcyclohexane, the alkyne is terminal. So maybe the NaNH2 (a strong base) deprotonates the triple bond, making it a cyclohexyl acetylide.

Once we have the acetylide, perhaps we can alkylate it with methyl chloride. But wait, methyl chloride is a primary alkylating agent; maybe it's adding a methyl group to the acetylide.

Wait, but the target molecule has a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So perhaps the acetylide is being converted into an alcohol. Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is being converted into something else.

Let me think about the possible steps. The target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane, which is also attached to another cyclohexane ring. So perhaps we are doing some kind of cyclopropanation or ring expansion? Or perhaps it's a case of adding a substituent and then oxidizing.

Wait, another approach: the target compound has a formyl group (CHO) attached. So maybe we're oxidizing an alcohol to a carbonyl group. That would require an oxidation step. For that, I remember that oxidizing agents like KMnO4 under acidic conditions (H2SO4, HgSO4 as catalyst) can oxidize primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but wait, maybe in this case, it's just a formyl group. Or maybe using another oxidizing agent like O3 (ozone) for ozonolysis.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is being converted into a carbonyl group. Let me think: The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (C6H11-C≡CH). If we first convert the triple bond into a ketone, that would give cyclohexylacetophenone or something similar. Wait, but that's not exactly what we have.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the triple bond is hydrogenated. So, H2 with a catalyst like Pd. That would turn the triple bond into a single bond with two hydrogens added. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane hydrogenated would become cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group? No, wait, adding H2 across the triple bond would make it a single bond, so C6H11-CH2CH3. But that's ethylcyclohexane. Hmm, but that doesn’t immediately lead to the target.

Wait, maybe the triple bond is being converted into a diol. Using H2SO4 and HgSO4 (as in a hydration reaction). So, the triple bond becomes a ketone, but wait, that's more like a hydration of an alkyne to a ketone. Or, maybe using O3 for ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of ethynylcyclohexane would break the triple bond into two carbonyl groups. But then, each end would have a carbonyl. But wait, ethynylcyclohexane is C6H11-C≡CH. Ozonolysis would break the triple bond, and then work up with something like (CH3)2S (which is a reductive workup) would give two ketones? Or maybe something else.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is being converted into an enol, then something else.

Wait, perhaps the first step is deprotonating the alkyne to form an acetylide. Then, using methyl chloride to methylate the acetylide. So the triple bond becomes C≡C-Me. Then, maybe hydrogenating that to CH2-CH2-Me, but that doesn't seem right. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Let me look at the options given and see what reagents are used. The options are A, B, C, D. Each has a sequence of 3 or 4 reagents.

Option A: Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride. Step 2: H2/Pd. Step 3: Ba(OH)2. Step 4: H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Wait, but the options have step 3 as Ba(OH)2, but then step 4 as H2SO4, etc. So maybe four steps?

Wait, perhaps option C: Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride. Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. Step 4: Ba(OH)2.

Hmm, not sure. Let me think about each possible reagent sequence.

The target molecule has a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So perhaps the compound has a hydroxyl group attached to a methyl group, which is attached to a cyclohexane ring, which is also attached to another cyclohexane ring. So maybe this is a case of forming a vicinal diol or some kind of ring expansion.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the alkyne is first converted into a trans-diol. Using H2SO4 and HgSO4 as catalysts, which would hydrate the triple bond to a diol. But wait, the hydration of an alkyne typically gives a ketone, not a diol. Oh wait, no—wait, in some cases, like using H2SO4 and HgSO4, the triple bond can be hydrated to a ketone. So, ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexylacetone, I think, which would be (cyclohexyl)propan-2-one. But the target doesn't have a ketone; it has a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is being converted into a carbonyl group, but then modified.

Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, perhaps the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a CH(OH)CH2 group attached, and also a formyl group (CHO) on the same carbon? Or maybe the formyl is on a different position.

Let me try to imagine the structure. So the main cyclohexane ring has two substituents: a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group, and a formyl group. So perhaps it's a cyclohexane with a branch that includes a hydroxymethyl and a formyl.

Wait, maybe it's a case of forming a bicyclic compound or a substituent with a formyl and a hydroxymethyl.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a case of forming a cyclohexane ring with a CH(OH)CH2-cyclohexyl group and a formyl group on another carbon.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the possible reactions each reagent would perform.

Looking at the options:

Option C:
1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: So this is likely deprotonation and alkylation. Deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then methyl chloride would methylate it. So the triple bond becomes C≡C-Me.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: This is hydrogenation, so the triple bond becomes single bond with two hydrogens. So the C≡C-Me would become CH2CH2-Me? Wait, no, hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would give a single bond, so (CH2)2-Me. Wait, no, the triple bond is C≡C, adding two H2 gives double bonds? No, wait, hydrogenation of triple bonds usually goes all the way to single bonds. So the triple bond becomes single bond with two H's added to each carbon.

So after step 2, the structure would be cyclohexyl-CH2-CH2-Me? Wait, that doesn't make much sense because the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (C6H11-C≡CH). So after methylating to C6H11-C≡C-Me, then hydrogenation would convert that to C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me. So ethyl group attached to the cyclohexane. Then, step 3 is O3 followed by (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis of a single bond? Wait, no, ozonolysis is for alkenes and alkynes. Wait, if after step 2, we have CH2CH2-Me, which is a single bond with maybe a double bond somewhere else? Or perhaps, wait, in step 2, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, so that's just a single bond. Then, step 3 is ozonolysis, but that requires a double bond. So maybe after step 2, the molecule is something else.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. After step 1, the triple bond becomes C6H11-C≡C-Me. Step 2 is hydrogenation, which would turn the triple into a single bond, so C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me. Then, step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis on a single bond doesn't do much. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a hydrogenation that leaves a double bond. Wait, but H2/Pd is typically for full hydrogenation. Unless perhaps the conditions are such that not all the hydrogenation occurs. But that's unlikely.

Hmm. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the target molecule again. It's an aldehyde (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane. So perhaps the starting alkyne is being converted into an aldehyde via some steps.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then reduced to an alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a diol, which then undergoes some elimination or oxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a Grignard reagent, which is then quenched to form an alcohol. But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking at option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; Li/liquid NH3; O3/(CH3)2S; NH4OH.

NaNH2 and methanol—well, methanol is a methylating agent. So perhaps deprotonation to form acetylide, then quench with methanol would give CH3 group. So step 1 gives C6H11-C≡C-OCH3? No, wait, perhaps the acetylide reacts with methanol as an electrophile, giving C6H11-C≡C-OCH3. Then, step 2 is Li and liquid NH3. That's typically a Birch reduction condition, but more commonly, it's used for deprotonation and alkylation. Alternatively, it could be used to form a Grignard-like reagent. Alternatively, maybe it's for alkyne to alkene conversion.

Wait, another possibility: Li in liquid NH3 is used to deprotonate and form a strong base, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's for reducing the alkyne to an alkene. Wait, no. Oh, maybe it's for a cyclopropanation? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, the alkyne is converted to a propargyl alcohol or something. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step in option D is forming a ketone. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, and methanol is a methylating agent. If the alkyne is deprotonated to form an acetylide, then treated with methanol, which would have an OCH3 group. But I'm not exactly sure how that would add. Maybe it's a substitution.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting stuck here, so let me try to think about the target structure. It has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that is a cyclohexyl-(hydroxymethyl) group, and another substituent which is an aldehyde group.

Wait, perhaps ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a trans-diol. Then, the diol is oxidized to a carbonyl group. Or maybe the diol is treated with a base to form a cyclic intermediate.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone, then the ketone is reduced to an alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has both a hydroxymethyl and a formyl group. So maybe the molecule has a CH(OH)CH2 group attached to a cyclohexane, and a CHO group on another carbon.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the ethynylcyclohexane is first converted into a benzyl-type compound, then undergoes some kind of elimination or oxidation.

Another approach: Let's consider each reagent in each option and see which sequence makes sense.

Option B: Step 1: NaNH2, ethyl chloride. So again, deprotonate alkyne to acetylide, then ethyl chloride would alkylate it. So C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3? Then step 2 is Li/liq. NH3, which I'm not exactly sure about. Maybe it's for deprotonation or reduction. Step 3: O3 and H2O. Then step 4: NH4OH.

Alternatively, maybe after step 1, the triple bond is converted into a longer chain. Then, step 2 could be a reduction or something else. Ozonolysis would break double bonds, but if step 2 is something else, maybe we have a double bond.

Wait, another thought: Li in liquid NH3 is a strong base and could induce elimination reactions. So perhaps step 2 is dehydrohalogenation, forming a double bond.

Wait, perhaps the first step in option B is a deprotonation and alkylation to make a longer alkyne. Then, step 2 could be a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkene. Then, ozonolysis would break that alkene into two carbonyl groups. Then, step 4 with NH4OH (a mild acid) would perhaps do a workup, maybe leading to some aldehyde groups.

But the target has only one aldehyde group, so maybe that's not the right way.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed via a ring expansion or some kind of addition.

Now, looking at option C: Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride. So the alkyne becomes C6H11-C≡C-Me. Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. Hydrogenation of the triple bond to CH2CH2-Me. So now, the molecule is C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me. Then step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis of what? If step 2 gives a single bond, then ozonolysis wouldn't react. So maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a partial hydrogenation, leaving a double bond.

Wait, H2/Pd is usually for full hydrogenation, but perhaps under certain conditions, it can stop at the alkene. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a double bond. But that would require a different catalyst, like Lindlar's for cis addition or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe step 3 is not ozonolysis but some other reaction. Wait, (CH3)2S is a reagent used in reductive workup after ozonolysis. So if step 3 is ozonolysis, then the previous step must have a double bond.

Wait, perhaps in option C, step 2 produces a double bond. How? Oh, maybe the hydrogenation is done in a way that stops at the alkene, but I thought H2/Pd usually goes all the way to single bond. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different catalyst. Or maybe it's a transfer hydrogenation.

Alternatively, maybe step 2 is a different reaction. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate could be for hydrogenating a carbonyl group, but that doesn't fit here.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the target molecule again. It's a cyclohexane with a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group and a formyl group. So perhaps the molecule is formed via a coupling reaction, where the alkyne is transformed into an aldehyde and another substituent.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, then reduced to an alcohol, then oxidized to an aldehyde. So the steps would involve oxidation and reduction.

Wait, but how to get the hydroxymethyl group attached to the cyclohexane.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a trans-diol using H2SO4 and HgSO4. Then, the diol is treated with Ba(OH)2, which would cause elimination, perhaps forming a carbonyl group.

Wait, Ba(OH)2 is a strong base used in the elimination reactions, like the Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but more commonly, it's used for epoxide ring openings or for elimination in certain conditions.

Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 could cause a diol to undergo elimination, forming a carbonyl group. So, if the diol is HO-C6H11-CH2-CH2-OH, treating with Ba(OH)2 would eliminate water and form a carbonyl group, giving a ketone. But how does that lead to the target aldehyde?

Wait, perhaps the diol is HO-CH2-C6H11-CH2-OH, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, if the diol is vicinal (adjacent), then elimination would form a carbonyl.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a ketone (using H2SO4 and HgSO4), then reduced to a secondary alcohol, then oxidized to a ketone again. Not sure.

Wait, let me try to think about each option's possible reactions.

Option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: form an acetylide, then methylate to C6H11-C≡C-Me.
2. H2/Pd: hydrogenate triple bond to single bond, giving C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me.
3. Ba(OH)2: perhaps elimination, but on what? If the molecule is ethylcyclohexane, Ba(OH)2 might not do much. Unless there's an alcohol present.
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: this is the Jones oxidation condition, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, but maybe in this case, it's used for something else.

Hmm, not seeing it.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride: form C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3.
2. Li/liq NH3: could be a Birch reduction, but more likely a deprotonation or alkylation.
3. O3, (CH3)2S: ozonolysis, which would break any double bonds into carbonyl groups.
4. NH4OH: workup.

So, after step 1, we have a longer alkyne. Step 2, maybe Li in NH3 induces elimination, forming a double bond. Then ozonolysis would break that double bond into two carbonyl groups. But how does that form the target molecule?

Alternatively, if the alkyne is first converted to an alkyne with an ethyl group, then step 2 could form a double bond, which is then ozonolyzed into two carbonyl groups. Then, workup with NH4OH could form aldehyde or ketone groups.

But the target molecule has both a formyl and a hydroxymethyl group attached to cyclohexane. So perhaps one of the ozonolysis products is a formyl group and another part is a diol. Hmm.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: form C6H11-C≡C-Me.
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate triple bond to single bond, so CH2CH2-Me.
3. O3, (CH3)2S: but no double bond, so can't do ozonolysis. Hmm, maybe step 2 doesn't hydrogenate fully. Maybe it stops at a double bond? But I thought H2/Pd usually goes all the way.

Wait, perhaps step 2 is a transfer hydrogenation. Alternatively, perhaps the H2 is used in a different way.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol: form acetylide, then quench with methanol; would that give C6H11-C≡C-OCH3? Or maybe a substitution, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's more about forming a ketone.

Wait, another thought: NaNH2 is a strong base and can deprotonate the alkyne. Methanol may then act as an electrophile, but I'm not certain how that would proceed. Maybe it's adding a hydroxymethyl group.

Then, step 2 is Li in liquid NH3: perhaps this is a Birch reduction, which would reduce aromatic rings but not sure if applicable here. Alternatively, it could be a deprotonation step leading to some elimination.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is for deprotonation and alkylation again, adding another group.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 in option D is ozonolysis, but without a double bond, it wouldn't do anything. So maybe the earlier steps form a double bond.

Wait, maybe after step 1, the alkyne is converted into an alkyne with an OCH3 group, then step 2 is Li in NH3, which could induce some elimination, forming a double bond. Then, ozonolysis would break that into carbonyl groups.

But I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about the target again. The structure has a cyclohexyl-(hydroxy)methyl group and a formyl group. So perhaps the synthesis involves adding a hydroxymethyl group and a formyl group to the cyclohexane.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the alkyne is first converted into a benzyl-type compound, then undergoes some kind of annulation or addition to form the rings.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is used to form a Grignard reagent, which is then quenched to form an alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone or aldehyde.

But I'm not connecting the steps.

Wait, let's think about the possible order of reactions. The triple bond could be converted into a carbonyl group via hydration. Then, that carbonyl could be reduced to an alcohol, which is then oxidized to an aldehyde.

But the target has two different substituents, so maybe the starting alkyne is used to form a longer chain that can then be split into two parts via ozonolysis to form the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, for example, if the alkyne is converted into a longer chain with a carbonyl group, then ozonolysis could break it into two aldehydes. But how to get the hydroxymethyl part.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol, which is then oxidized to a carbonyl group, and another part is reduced to a hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted via hydrogenation into a single bond, then undergoes some kind of ring-opening or addition.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide.
2. Alkylation to add a methyl group.
3. Hydrogenation to form a single bond.
4. Ozonolysis to break into carbonyl groups.
5. Workup to form aldehyde and alcohol.

But I'm not matching this with the options.

Looking at option C:

Steps: 1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → acetylide methylated.
2. H2/Pd-c → hydrogenate triple bond.
3. O3, (CH3)2S → but without a double bond, nothing happens.
4. Ba(OH)2 → not sure.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps option C has another approach. Let me think: After step 1, the molecule is C6H11-C≡C-Me. Step 2 is hydrogenation to C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me. Now, perhaps step 3 is ozonolysis, but that requires a double bond. So maybe I'm missing a step that introduces a double bond.

Wait, perhaps during step 2, the hydrogenation doesn't go to completion, leaving a double bond? But I thought H2/Pd fully hydrogenates triple bonds.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation is stopped at the alkene stage, but that requires a different catalyst, like Lindlar's, which is poisoned to stop at cis addition. So maybe step 2 in option C is not full hydrogenation. But the catalyst is Pd, which usually goes to full hydrogenation.

This is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about each reagent's typical use.

NaNH2 and methyl chloride: likely deprotonation and alkylation to form an acetylide and then a methyl group addition. So the triple bond becomes C≡C-Me.

H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: probably hydrogenates the triple bond to single bond, making CH2-CH2-Me.

O3 and (CH3)2S: Ozonolysis, but if the molecule is now C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me, then there's no double bond. So this can't be right. So perhaps this option is incorrect.

Option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe the triple bond is converted into a ketone. Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol could be a methylating agent, but perhaps it's used in a different way.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step forms a Grignard reagent. NaNH2 can deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, and then methanol might react as an electrophile. But I'm not sure.

Step 2: Li in liq NH3. Maybe this is a Birch reduction, which reduces aromatic rings to diols, but our starting material isn't aromatic. Alternatively, it could be a deprotonation to form a strong base, leading to elimination.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis again, but unless there's a double bond, it's not useful.

So, perhaps option D isn't the right sequence either.

Going back, maybe the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne with NaNH2 to form an acetylide.
2. Quench with a methylating agent (methyl chloride) to add a methyl group, making C6H11-C≡C-Me.
3. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond (using H2/Pd), making C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me.
4. Ozonolysis won't work, so perhaps another step.

Wait, perhaps the next step is Ba(OH)2, which can cause elimination. If the molecule is C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me, perhaps Ba(OH)2 isn't doing much. Alternatively, maybe after hydrogenation, the molecule undergoes some kind of oxidation or reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps the target requires a ring-opening or some kind of aldehyde formation via oxidation.

Wait, another angle: The target molecule has a formyl group. Formyl groups can be formed by oxidizing primary alcohols. So perhaps the pathway includes forming a primary alcohol, then oxidizing it.

So, starting from ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a primary alcohol. How?

Hydration of the alkyne in acidic conditions with HgSO4 would give a ketone, which can then be reduced to a secondary alcohol. Alternatively, using a different reagent, perhaps the alkyne can be converted into an aldehyde.

Wait, maybe using O3 for ozonolysis of the alkyne. Ozonolysis of an internal alkyne would give two carbonyl groups. Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a terminal alkyne. Ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne would give a ketone and an aldehyde. Because the terminal alkyne (R-C≡CH) would, upon ozonolysis, give R-C=O and HCHO. But wait, in the presence of (CH3)2S as a reductive workup, perhaps the aldehyde would be preserved, while the other part would be a ketone.

So, for example, ethynylcyclohexane (C6H11-C≡CH) upon ozonolysis with (CH3)2S would break into C6H11-C=O and HCHO. So, one part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C6H11-CO-CHO?), no, wait, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, ozonolysis of R-C≡C-R’ would produce R-O and R’-O, but for a terminal alkyne R-C≡CH, ozonolysis would give R-C=O and H-C=O. But with (CH3)2S as a reductive workup, the aldehyde would be formed. So, ethynylcyclohexane would break into cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C6H11-CO-CHO?) No, wait, I think I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. The ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne R-C≡CH would yield R-C=O and HCHO (formaldehyde). So, if R is cyclohexyl, then we would get cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde (C6H11-CO-CHO?), but wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the correct product would be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and formaldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the correct product is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (C6H11-CHO) and formaldehyde (HCHO). So, after ozonolysis, you would have two carbonyl compounds: one being the aldehyde from the alkyne and the other formaldehyde.

But how does that help in forming the target molecule, which is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde?

Hmm, perhaps the target is formed by combining the aldehyde and another part. But I'm not seeing the connection.

Another thought: Maybe after ozonolysis, the aldehyde is further modified. For example, the aldehyde could be reduced to a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a carboxylic acid or remains as an alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the aldehyde group is where the formyl group in the target comes from.

Wait, looking back at the target molecule: it's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, on the cyclohexane ring, there's a substituent that is a cyclohexyl group connected via a hydroxymethyl group, and also a formyl group.

So perhaps the formyl comes from ozonolysis, and the hydroxymethyl comes from another part.

But I'm not getting it. Let me think about each option again and see which sequence logically leads to the target.

Option C: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → form C6H11-C≡C-Me.

2. H2/Pd-c → hydrogenate triple to single, making C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me.

3. O3, (CH3)2S → but no double bond, so no reaction.

4. Ba(OH)2 → maybe elimination, but on what?

Wait, perhaps step 4 is a way to form a carbonyl group. For example, Ba(OH)2 could cause elimination of water, forming a double bond. But in the molecule after step 2, it's C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me. No hydroxyl groups present, so Ba(OH)2 wouldn't do much. So this sequence doesn't seem right.

Option B: Steps are:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → C6H11-C≡C-CH2CH3.

2. Li/liq NH3 → maybe deprotonate and eliminate, forming a double bond.

3. O3, H2O → ozonolysis of the double bond.

4. NH4OH → workup, maybe to form aldehydes.

So, after step 2, the molecule has a double bond. Ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups. Then, in step 4, those would become aldehydes or ketones.

But the target has both an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps one part becomes the aldehyde, and the other part becomes an alcohol, which is then oxidized. But I'm not seeing the exact steps.

Alternatively, maybe the ethyl group is involved in forming the hydroxymethyl.

Hmm.

Another approach: Let's look for the correct sequence of reactions.

The target has a formyl group, which suggests that somewhere, an oxidation of a primary alcohol must have occurred. So perhaps the steps should include converting an alcohol to an aldehyde.

So, perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into a diol, then oxidized to an aldehyde.

Wait, but the target has a hydroxymethyl group, which is an alcohol. So maybe we need a step that forms an alcohol, which is then converted into a hydroxymethyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps involve adding a methyl group, then oxidizing.

Wait, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then alkylation to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond.

3. Ozonolysis to break a double bond (but how is the double bond formed? Maybe from an elimination step.)

4. Workup to form an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct sequence in option C is:

1. Acetylide methylated.

2. Hydrogenate to single bond.

3. Ozonolysis can't react, so no.

Hmm.

At this point, I'm a bit stuck. So perhaps I should look for the correct reagent sequence that would form the aldehyde and the hydroxymethyl group.

Another thought: The target has a formyl group, which could be formed by oxidizing a primary alcohol. So, perhaps somewhere in the steps, an alcohol is formed and then oxidized.

So, looking for a sequence that includes a reduction step to form an alcohol and then an oxidation step to form the aldehyde.

Looking through the options:

Option B: Steps include O3, which could form carbonyl groups, and then NH4OH, which is a mild acid.

Option C: includes O3 but no obvious alcohol formation.

Option D: includes O3 but again, not seeing the connection.

Wait, option D's step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this forms a ketone, then step 2 is Li in NH3 which could reduce the ketone to an alcohol. Then step 3 is ozonolysis, which doesn't apply, so probably not.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C. Let me think again.

Option C:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → C6H11-C≡C-Me.

Step 2: H2/Pd-c → C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: O3, (CH3)2S → but no double bond, so nothing.

Hmm, but maybe I'm missing something. What if after step 2, the molecule is C6H11-CH2-CH2-Me, and then step 3 is Ba(OH)2, which does elimination to form a carbonyl group.

Wait, but Ba(OH)2 is a strong base and can cause elimination of water if there's an alcohol present. But in this molecule, after step 2, there's no hydroxyl group. So Ba(OH)2 wouldn't do much.

Alternatively, maybe step 4 in option C is Ba(OH)2, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is to first form an aldehyde via ozonolysis, then add a hydroxymethyl group.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is option C because it includes ozonolysis, which would form the aldehyde, and some other step would form the hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, another thought: The target has a (cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl) group. So perhaps the hydroxymethyl is formed from an epoxide opening, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxymethyl comes from a Grignard addition to a carbonyl.

But without a clear path, I'm not making progress.

Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Option C includes ozonolysis, which seems relevant for forming a carbonyl group, which would then become the aldehyde. But without a double bond, ozonolysis doesn't work. So perhaps the prior step introduces a double bond.

Wait, perhaps step 2 in option C is not full hydrogenation. If the hydrogenation is stopped at the alkene, then ozonolysis would work. But I thought H2/Pd would fully hydrogenate the triple bond.

Alternatively, the H2/Pd-c could be a transfer hydrogenation, not fully hydrogenating the triple bond.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Deprotonate and methylate the alkyne.

2. Partially hydrogenate to an alkene.

3. Ozonolysis to form two aldehydes.

4. Use Ba(OH)2 to form a hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, because it's the only one that includes ozonolysis and then Ba(OH)2, which could be used to form the hydroxymethyl group.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: the target has a formyl group (CHO) and a hydroxymethyl group (CH(OH)R).

So, perhaps the steps are:

- Convert the alkyne to a diol.

- Then, oxidize one part to a carbonyl (formyl) and reduce another part to a hydroxymethyl.

But without knowing the exact steps, it's hard.

Given the time I've spent, I'll make a guess. Based on the reagents, option C seems to include ozonolysis, which is likely needed to form the aldehyde. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.


The question involves identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule contains a cyclohexane ring with a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group and a formyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Options:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne to form an acetylide, which is then methylated to C₆H₁₁-C≡C-Me.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in C₆H₁₁-CH₂-CH₂-Me.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, typically used for elimination or epoxide opening, but no clear reaction pathway is apparent here.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Oxidation conditions, but the sequence does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and alkylates it with an ethyl group, forming C₆H₁₁-C≡C-CH₂CH₃.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely induces elimination or reduction, potentially forming a double bond.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis would break a double bond into carbonyl groups, but the sequence does not clearly explain how the hydroxymethyl group is formed.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild acid for workup, but the pathway remains unclear.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Deprotonates the alkyne and methylates it, forming C₆H₁₁-C≡C-Me.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond, resulting in C₆H₁₁-CH₂-CH₂-Me.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is absent after step 2. This step seems irrelevant unless the hydrogenation is incomplete, which is unlikely.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, but no clear reaction pathway is apparent here.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: Deprotonates the alkyne and quenches it with methanol, potentially forming a ketone or an alcohol.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: Likely induces elimination or reduction, but the exact reaction is unclear.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis requires a double bond, which is not evident in the sequence.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild acid for workup, but the pathway does not clearly lead to the target molecule.

### Conclusion:
The target molecule contains both a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl group. The formyl group suggests an oxidation step, possibly involving ozonolysis, but this requires a double bond. However, none of the options provide a clear and logical sequence of reactions to achieve the target molecule. Among the options, **Option C** includes ozonolysis, which is relevant for forming carbonyl groups, but the sequence does not fully align with the target structure. Despite some uncertainties, **Option C** is the most plausible choice based on the reagents provided.
