Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question gives me data about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a different mass: 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But wait, I don't think the masses directly affect the elemental abundances in this context. The problem is about the ratios of elements, so maybe mass isn't super relevant here. I'll put that aside for now.

The elemental abundances are given using the EW method under LTE. I remember that EW stands for equivalent width, and LTE is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which means the gas in the star's atmosphere is in equilibrium. So the measurements are based on that assumption.

The data given are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the photospheric composition of the Sun is:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16 × 10^-5.
Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) for the Sun is 7.5 -12 = same as Fe? Wait wait, wait. Wait, the Sun's data says 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7. So log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=10^-5.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The Sun's photosphere composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5. Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

So for the Sun, nFe/nH is about 3.16e-5, and nMg/nH is 1e-5.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So [nSi_1 / nSi_2]?

Wait, no. The ratio is nSi_1 / nSi_2? Or is it [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] that determine the ratios?

Wait, let's think about this. The [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY / (nX_sun / nY_sun)) )

Wait, no, it's [X/Y] = log( (nX/nY) / (nX_sun / nY_sun) ) )

Which can be rewritten as log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun).

So, for Star 1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means (nSi/nFe)_1 / (nSi/nFe)_sun = 10^0.3.

Wait, wait, no. The [Si/Fe] is defined as log10( (nSi/nFe) / (nSi/nFe)_sun ) ).

So [Si/Fe] = log( (nSi/nFe) / (nSi/nFe)_sun )

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe] =0.3 → (nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (nMg/nSi)_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_sun.

So I need to find nSi_1 / nSi_2.

Wait, but nSi_1 and nSi_2 are the number densities of Si in each star. So to find the ratio, I need to express each in terms relative to their respective stars and then compare.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to express each abundance in terms of H, since [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are given. Because [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (nFe/nH)/(nFe_sun/nH_sun). So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0, which means (nFe_1/nH_1) = (nFe_sun /nH_sun).

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2=0 → (nMg_2/nH_2) = (nMg_sun /nH_sun).

So let's break it down.

First, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log( (nFe_1 /nH_1) / (nFe_sun /nH_sun) ) ) =0 → (nFe_1/nH_1) = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) → so nFe_1 = nH_1 * (nFe_sun /nH_sun) = nH_1 * (3.16e-5) because for Sun, nFe/nH is 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log( (nSi_1/nFe_1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) )) =0.3 → (nSi_1/nFe_1) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

We know that for the Sun, nSi_sun / nFe_sun is (nSi_sun /nH_sun) / (nFe_sun /nH_sun) ) → (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun.

Wait, the Sun's nSi/nH is given by 12 + log(nSi/nH) = 7 → log(nSi/nH) =7-12= -5 → nSi/nH=1e-5.

So nSi_sun/nFe_sun = (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun ) → (1e-5) / (3.16e-5) ≈ 0.316.

So, (nSi_1/nFe_1) = 10^0.3 * 0.316 ≈ (2) *0.316 ≈0.632.

But wait, 10^0.3 is approximately 2, since 10^0.3= about 2 (since 10^0.3 is ~2 because 10^0.3010 = 2 exactly). So 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So (nSi_1/nFe_1) = 2 *0.316 ≈0.632.

But we can express nSi_1 in terms of nFe_1 and nH_1.

Wait, but nFe_1 is (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH_1 = (3.16e-5) *nH_1.

So nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * 0.632 = (3.16e-5 * nH_1) * 0.632 ≈ (3.16e-5 *0.632) *nH_1 ≈ 1.99e-5 *nH_1.

So approximately nSi_1 ≈ 2e-5 *nH_1.

Wait, that's the number density of Si in Star_1.

Now, moving to Star_2.

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. So log( (nMg_2 /nSi_2) / (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) ) )=0.3 → (nMg_2/nSi_2) =10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → (nMg_2/nH_2) = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) =1e-5.

So nMg_2 = (1e-5) *nH_2.

Now, nMg_sun /nSi_sun = (nMg/nH)_sun / (nSi/nH)_sun = (1e-5) / (1e-5) )=1.

So (nMg_2 /nSi_2) = 10^0.3 * 1 → nMg_2 =10^0.3 *nSi_2.

But nMg_2 is also (1e-5) nH_2.

So 1e-5 *nH_2 =10^0.3 *nSi_2 → nSi_2 = (1e-5 *nH_2 ) /10^0.3.

Which is nSi_2 ≈ (1e-5 /2 ) *nH_2 → since 10^0.3≈2 → nSi_2≈5e-6 *nH_2.

So now, we have nSi_1 = approx 2e-5 *nH_1 and nSi_2=5e-6*nH_2.

Wait, but we need the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2.

So ratio = (2e-5 *nH_1) / (5e-6 *nH_2) )= (2e-5/5e-6) * (nH_1 /nH_2) ) = (4) * (nH_1/nH_2).

But wait, how do we find nH_1 /nH_2?

Wait, the issue is that the stars have different H densities. But since we don't have any data about their temperatures, pressures, etc., maybe we can assume that the hydrogen number density is the same as the Sun's? Or perhaps the ratio is not needed because H cancels out. Hmm, I'm not so sure.

Wait, no. Because the stars have different masses, but the photosphere's composition is about element ratios, not absolute densities. So perhaps the H density is not the same. But without information about their temperatures or other factors, perhaps the ratio of H in each star is the same as in the Sun? Or not. Hmm.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let's think differently. Maybe it's better to express everything in terms of solar ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the H density is the same in both stars as in the Sun. But that might not be correct because the stars have different masses, but the photosphere's H density can vary based on temperature and pressure. But perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the H density ratio is 1, meaning nH_1 =nH_2. Let me proceed under that assumption. If that's wrong, the answer might be incorrect, but perhaps it's the intended approach.

So if nH_1 = nH_2, then the ratio is 4 *1 =4.

Wait, but 2e-5 / 5e-6 is 4, yes. So nSi_1 /nSi_2 =4.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which is close to 4. But wait, I approximated 10^0.3 as 2, but actually, 10^0.3 is approximately 2 (since log10(2) ≈0.3010). So 10^0.3 is about 1.995, which is roughly 2, so the approximation is okay.

So the ratio would be around 4. But wait, the options have 3.9 as option A. That's close. But wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations without approximating 10^0.3 as 2.

Compute 10^0.3 exactly. Let me remember that 10^0.3 is about 1.99526, so approximately 2. So maybe it's better to use 2 for simplicity.

Wait, but let's compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 10^0.3.

Using calculator-like thinking: 10^0.3 = e^(0.3 * ln10) ) ≈ e^(0.3*2.302585) )= e^(0.6907755) ≈ 1.99526.

So, in the calculation for Star_2:

nSi_2 = (1e-5 *nH_2 ) / (10^0.3) → (1e-5 /1.99526) *nH_2 ≈5.012e-6 *nH_2.

nSi_1 = (3.16e-5 *0.632) *nH_1 → Wait, no. Wait, earlier we have:

nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (nSi_1/nFe_1) → nFe_1 = (3.16e-5)*nH_1. So nSi_1 = (3.16e-5)*(0.632)*nH_1.

0.632 is from 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun), which is 10^0.3 * ( (1e-5) / (3.16e-5) )= (1e-5/3.16e-5) )= (1/3.16) ≈0.316. So 10^0.3 *0.316 ≈2 *0.316=0.632.

So nSi_1 =3.16e-5 *0.632 *nH_1 →3.16e-5 is 3.16*1e-5.

3.16e-5 *0.632 =3.16 *0.632 *1e-5.

3.16 *0.632 is approximately 2 (since 3 *0.6 is 1.8, 3.16*0.632 is about 2. So 2e-5 *nH_1.

So nSi_1 ≈2e-5 *nH_1.

nSi_2 = (1e-5 /1.99526) *nH_2 → approximately 5e-6 *nH_2.

So the ratio (nSi_1 /nSi_2) = (2e-5 *nH_1) / (5e-6 *nH_2) ) = (2e-5 /5e-6) * (nH_1/nH_2) )= (4) * (nH_1 /nH_2).

Wait, but we don't know the ratio of nH_1 to nH_2. Because the stars have different masses, but their photospheric H densities could vary. Hmm. How to handle that?

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that both stars have the same hydrogen density as the Sun, meaning nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2= nH_sun. But that might not be correct because the stars have different masses, but the photosphere's composition is about the ratios, not absolute densities.

Alternatively, perhaps the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] being zero indicates that the metallicity (Fe and Mg relative to H) is the same as the Sun. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 means nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun → so the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as Sun. Similarly, for Star_2, Mg/H is solar.

Wait, but that doesn't directly tell us about nH_1 and nH_2. Hmm. Maybe the problem expects us to assume that the overall H density is the same in both stars as in the Sun, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio nH_1/nH_2 is irrelevant because in the calculation it cancels out. Wait, no, in the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2, the H terms are in the same ratio as nH_1/nH_2.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that I'm misunderstanding the [X/Fe] and [Mg/H] definitions. Let me double-check.

Wait, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 → Fe/H = Sun's Fe/H.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 → Mg/H = Sun's Mg/H.

So, for Star_1:

nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

For Star_2:

nMg_2 /nH_2 =nMg_sun /nH_sun.

But what about nH_1 and nH_2? We don't have any data about how H compares between the stars. So perhaps the problem assumes that the H density is the same in both stars as in the Sun. But that's an assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the ratio of nH_1 and nH_2 using other information. But I don't see any other data given.

Wait, maybe the problem doesn't require considering nH_1 and nH_2. Because the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2 is (2e-5 *nH_1) / (5e-6 *nH_2) )= (4 *nH_1) /nH_2.

So what if nH_1/nH_2 =1? Then the ratio is 4. But wait, the options don't have exactly 4. Option A is ~3.9, which is very close.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through again.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (nSi_1/nFe_1) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

We have nSi_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

nFe_sun =3.16e-5 *nH_sun.

So nSi_sun /nFe_sun = (1e-5) / (3.16e-5) )= 1/3.16 ≈0.316.

Thus, (nSi_1/nFe_1) = 10^0.3 * 0.316 ≈1.995 *0.316 ≈0.632.

And nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH_1 =3.16e-5 *nH_1.

So nSi_1 = (nFe_1) *0.632 =3.16e-5 *nH_1 *0.632.

3.16e-5 *0.632 =approx 1.99e-5.

So nSi_1 ≈1.99e-5 *nH_1.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (nMg_2/nSi_2) =10^0.3*(nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

nSi_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

So nMg_sun/nSi_sun=1.

Thus, (nMg_2/nSi_2)=1.995 → nMg_2=1.995 *nSi_2.

But [Mg/H]_2=0 →nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun) )=1e-5 *nH_2.

Wait, because nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun →nMg_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH_2=1e-5 *nH_2.

So putting it together:

nMg_2 =1.995 *nSi_2 → 1e-5 *nH_2 =1.995 *nSi_2 → nSi_2= (1e-5 *nH_2 ) /1.995 ≈5.017e-6 *nH_2.

Thus, nSi_1≈1.99e-5 *nH_1.

nSi_2≈5.017e-6 *nH_2.

So the ratio is (1.99e-5 *nH_1)/(5.017e-6 *nH_2 )= (1.99e-5/5.017e-6) * (nH_1/nH_2 )= (approx 3.96) * (nH_1/nH_2 ).

Wait, 1.99e-5 /5.017e-6 = (1.99 /5.017) * (1e-5/1e-6) )= (0.3965) *10 ≈3.965.

So the ratio is approximately 3.965 * (nH_1/nH_2 ).

But without knowing nH_1/nH_2, we cannot proceed. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] data can help us find nH_1/nH_2.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 → nFe_1/nH_1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun → which I think we've already used.

For Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 →nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun → which we've also used.

But how does that help with nH_1 and nH_2?

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio nH_1/nH_2 using the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] abundances.

Wait, no, because both stars have [Fe/H]=0 and [Mg/H]=0. So their Fe and Mg are at solar abundance relative to H. But that doesn't give any info about the total H density in each star.

Wait, unless I'm missing something. Oh wait, the problem statement is about the photospheric composition, so perhaps the total number of atoms is the same as the Sun. No, that's probably not the case. The problem doesn't state that.

Hmm, I think I might be stuck because I can't find a way to determine the ratio of nH_1 to nH_2. But perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the H density is the same in both stars as in the Sun. That would make nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun. Then nH_1/nH_2=1, and the ratio would be ~3.965, which is approximately 3.9, so option A.

Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check:

Wait, when I calculated nSi_1 and nSi_2, I wrote:

nSi_1 =1.99e-5 *nH_1.

nSi_2≈5.017e-6 *nH_2.

Thus, the ratio is (1.99e-5 *nH_1 )/(5.017e-6 *nH_2 )= (1.99/5.017) *10 * (nH_1/nH_2 )

Which is approximately (0.3965) *10 =3.965.

So if nH_1/nH_2 =1, ratio is ~3.965.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

But wait, the options are A) ~3.9, B) ~12.6, etc. So A is the closest.

But wait, could there be another approach to this problem?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Another approach is to express the silicon abundance in each star relative to the Sun and then take the ratio.

Let me try that.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → (nSi_1/nFe_1) =10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) → as before.

But also, [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

So nSi_1 =nFe_1 * (nSi_1/nFe_1) =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) * (10^0.3) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But nSi_sun = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *nH_sun.

So substituting: nSi_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) → simplifies to nSi_1 = (nFe_sun *nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) * (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^0.3 → nSi_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^0.3.

But wait, nSi_sun = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *nH_sun.

Hmm, perhaps another way. Let me compute [Si/H] for Star_1.

[Si/H]_1= [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 =0.3 +0=0.3.

So [Si/H]_1=0.3 → log( (nSi_1/nH_1)/(nSi_sun/nH_sun) )=0.3 → (nSi_1/nH_1)=10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun) → nSi_1 =10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *nH_1.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log( (nMg_2/nSi_2)/(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0.3 → (nMg_2/nSi_2) =10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But [Mg/H]_2=0 → (nMg_2/nH_2)= (nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH_2.

From the Sun's data, nMg_sun/nH_sun =1e-5.

nSi_sun/nH_sun =1e-5.

So nMg_sun/nSi_sun = (1e-5)/(1e-5)=1.

So (nMg_2/nSi_2)=10^0.3 *1 → nMg_2 =10^0.3 *nSi_2.

But nMg_2 = (1e-5) *nH_2.

So 1e-5 *nH_2 =1.995 *nSi_2 → nSi_2 = (1e-5 /1.995) *nH_2 ≈5.017e-6 *nH_2.

So nSi_1 is 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *nH_1 → 1.995 * (1e-5) *nH_1 → 1.995e-5 *nH_1.

nSi_2 is 5.017e-6 *nH_2.

So the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2)= (1.995e-5 *nH_1 ) / (5.017e-6 *nH_2 )= (1.995/5.017) *10 * (nH_1/nH_2).

As before, which is approximately 3.965 * (nH_1/nH_2).

But without knowing nH_1/nH_2, how can I proceed?

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the stars have the same hydrogen density as the Sun, meaning nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun → then nH_1/nH_2=1, and the ratio is ~3.965 → around 3.96.

So the option A is ~3.9, which is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Wait, maybe the [Fe/H] data is not directly about H, but about the star's overall metallicity. Hmm, no, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun.

Wait, another approach: perhaps express the silicon abundance in both stars relative to the Sun and then take the ratio.

For Star_1:

[Si/H]_1= [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 =0.3 +0=0.3.

So [Si/H]_1=0.3 → (nSi_1/nH_1) =10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2, we can compute [Si/H]_2.

Wait, but Star_2's [Mg/Si] is given, so perhaps I can compute [Si/H]_2.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (nMg_2/nSi_2)/(nMg_sun/nSi_sun)=10^0.3 → (nMg_2/nSi_2) =10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But [Mg/H]_2=0 →nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

So, from [Mg/Si]_2:

nMg_2/nSi_2=10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) → nMg_2=10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *nSi_2.

But nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

So:

nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun) =10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *nSi_2.

Divide both sides by nMg_sun:

(nH_2/nH_sun) =10^0.3 * (1/nSi_sun) *nSi_2.

So, nSi_2 = (nH_2/nH_sun) *nSi_sun *10^-0.3.

But nSi_sun = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) *nH_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

So,

nSi_2= (nH_2/nH_sun) *1e-5 *nH_sun *10^-0.3 → nSi_2 =1e-5 *nH_2 *10^-0.3.

But 10^-0.3 is 1/(10^0.3)=1/1.995≈0.501.

So,

nSi_2=1e-5 *nH_2 *0.501 → approx 5.01e-6 *nH_2.

Which matches what I had earlier.

For Star_1, [Si/H]_1=0.3 → nSi_1=10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *nH_1.

nSi_sun/nH_sun=1e-5.

So nSi_1=1.995e-5 *nH_1.

So the ratio is nSi_1/nSi_2= (1.995e-5 nH_1)/(5.01e-6 nH_2 )= (1.995e-5 /5.01e-6) * (nH_1/nH_2 )= (≈3.98) * (nH_1/nH_2 ).

But without knowing nH_1/nH_2, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the H density is the same in both stars as in the Sun. So nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun. Then, the ratio is 3.98, approximately 3.98, which is close to option A, 3.9.

But another thought: perhaps the ratio nH_1/nH_2 can be determined from other aspects. For example, the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero, but perhaps it's about the overall metallicity. But I can't find a way to get the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem expects the ratio to be about 4, so option A is correct.

To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar photospheric composition. The key steps are as follows:

### Star_1 Analysis:
1. **[Fe/H]_1 = 0**: This indicates that the iron-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Thus, \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
2. **[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3**: Using the definition of the abundance ratio:
   \[
   \log_{10} \left( \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}} \right) = 0.3
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Fe,1}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe,sun}}}.
   \]
   Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}} \), we find:
   \[
   n_{\text{Si,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe,sun}}}.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   n_{\text{Si,1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{Si,sun}}.
   \]
   Using \( n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} = 10^{-5} \), we get:
   \[
   n_{\text{Si,1}} = 1.995 \cdot 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}}.
   \]

### Star_2 Analysis:
1. **[Mg/H]_2 = 0**: This indicates that the magnesium-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun. Thus, \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
2. **[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3**: Using the definition of the abundance ratio:
   \[
   \log_{10} \left( \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}} \right) = 0.3
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg,sun}}}{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}.
   \]
   Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}} \), we find:
   \[
   n_{\text{Si,2}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{10^{0.3}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg,sun}} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}}{10^{0.3}}.
   \]
   Using \( n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} = 10^{-5} \), we get:
   \[
   n_{\text{Si,2}} = \frac{10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}}}{10^{0.3}} = 5.017 \cdot 10^{-6} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}}.
   \]

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{1.995 \cdot 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}}}{5.017 \cdot 10^{-6} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{1.995}{5.017} \cdot 10 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}.
\]
Assuming \( n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = 1 \) (i.e., the hydrogen density is the same in both stars), the ratio becomes:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} \approx 3.96.
\]

### Final Answer:
The closest option to the calculated ratio is **A) ~3.9**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this problem about stars and their elemental abundances. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question gives me data about two stars, Star_1 and Star_2. Each has a different mass: 1.5 and 1.2 times the Sun's mass, respectively. But wait, I don't think the masses directly affect the elemental abundances in this context. The problem is about the ratios of elements, so maybe mass isn't super relevant here. I'll put that aside for now.

The elemental abundances are given using the EW method under LTE. I remember that EW stands for equivalent width, and LTE is Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium, which means the gas in the star's atmosphere is in equilibrium. So the measurements are based on that assumption.

The data given are:
- [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 dex
- [Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3 dex
- [Fe/H]_1 = 0 dex
- [Mg/H]_2 = 0 dex

And the photospheric composition of the Sun is:
12 + log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 → so log10(nFe/nH) = 7.5 - 12 = -4.5 → nFe/nH = 10^(-4.5) ≈ 3.16 × 10^-5.
Similarly, log10(nMg/nH) for the Sun is 7.5 -12 = same as Fe? Wait wait, wait. Wait, the Sun's data says 12 + log(nMg/nH) =7. So log(nMg/nH) =7-12= -5 → nMg/nH=10^-5.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. The Sun's photosphere composition is given as 12 + log10(nFe/nH) =7.5. So log(nFe/nH) = 7.5 -12 = -4.5. So nFe/nH = 10^-4.5 ≈ 3.16e-5. Similarly, 12 + log10(nMg/nH) =7 → log(nMg/nH)=7-12= -5 → nMg/nH =1e-5.

So for the Sun, nFe/nH is about 3.16e-5, and nMg/nH is 1e-5.

The question asks for the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2. So [nSi_1 / nSi_2]?

Wait, no. The ratio is nSi_1 / nSi_2? Or is it [Si/Fe] and [Mg/Si] that determine the ratios?

Wait, let's think about this. The [X/Y] notation is the logarithm of the ratio of X to Y abundances relative to the Sun. So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY) - log(nX/nY)_sun.

So [X/Y] = log(nX/nY / (nX_sun / nY_sun)) )

Wait, no, it's [X/Y] = log( (nX/nY) / (nX_sun / nY_sun) ) )

Which can be rewritten as log(nX/nY) - log(nX_sun/nY_sun).

So, for Star 1, [Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3. That means (nSi/nFe)_1 / (nSi/nFe)_sun = 10^0.3.

Wait, wait, no. The [Si/Fe] is defined as log10( (nSi/nFe) / (nSi/nFe)_sun ) ).

So [Si/Fe] = log( (nSi/nFe) / (nSi/nFe)_sun )

So for Star_1, [Si/Fe] =0.3 → (nSi/nFe)_1 = 10^0.3 * (nSi/nFe)_sun.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (nMg/nSi)_2 = 10^0.3 * (nMg/nSi)_sun.

So I need to find nSi_1 / nSi_2.

Wait, but nSi_1 and nSi_2 are the number densities of Si in each star. So to find the ratio, I need to express each in terms relative to their respective stars and then compare.

But wait, perhaps it's easier to express each abundance in terms of H, since [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are given. Because [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (nFe/nH)/(nFe_sun/nH_sun). So for Star_1, [Fe/H]_1=0, which means (nFe_1/nH_1) = (nFe_sun /nH_sun).

Similarly, [Mg/H]_2=0 → (nMg_2/nH_2) = (nMg_sun /nH_sun).

So let's break it down.

First, for Star_1:

[Fe/H]_1 = 0 → log( (nFe_1 /nH_1) / (nFe_sun /nH_sun) ) ) =0 → (nFe_1/nH_1) = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) → so nFe_1 = nH_1 * (nFe_sun /nH_sun) = nH_1 * (3.16e-5) because for Sun, nFe/nH is 3.16e-5.

Similarly, for [Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → log( (nSi_1/nFe_1) / (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) )) =0.3 → (nSi_1/nFe_1) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

We know that for the Sun, nSi_sun / nFe_sun is (nSi_sun /nH_sun) / (nFe_sun /nH_sun) ) → (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun.

Wait, the Sun's nSi/nH is given by 12 + log(nSi/nH) = 7 → log(nSi/nH) =7-12= -5 → nSi/nH=1e-5.

So nSi_sun/nFe_sun = (nSi/nH)_sun / (nFe/nH)_sun ) → (1e-5) / (3.16e-5) ≈ 0.316.

So, (nSi_1/nFe_1) = 10^0.3 * 0.316 ≈ (2) *0.316 ≈0.632.

But wait, 10^0.3 is approximately 2, since 10^0.3= about 2 (since 10^0.3 is ~2 because 10^0.3010 = 2 exactly). So 10^0.3 ≈ 2.

So (nSi_1/nFe_1) = 2 *0.316 ≈0.632.

But we can express nSi_1 in terms of nFe_1 and nH_1.

Wait, but nFe_1 is (nFe_sun/nH_sun) *nH_1 = (3.16e-5) *nH_1.

So nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * 0.632 = (3.16e-5 * nH_1) * 0.632 ≈ (3.16e-5 *0.632) *nH_1 ≈ 1.99e-5 *nH_1.

So approximately nSi_1 ≈ 2e-5 *nH_1.

Wait, that's the number density of Si in Star_1.

Now, moving to Star_2.

Star_2 has [Mg/Si]_2=0.3. So log( (nMg_2 /nSi_2) / (nMg_sun /nSi_sun) ) )=0.3 → (nMg_2/nSi_2) =10^0.3 * (nMg_sun /nSi_sun).

And [Mg/H]_2=0 → (nMg_2/nH_2) = (nMg_sun /nH_sun) =1e-5.

So nMg_2 = (1e-5) *nH_2.

Now, nMg_sun /nSi_sun = (nMg/nH)_sun / (nSi/nH)_sun = (1e-5) / (1e-5) )=1.

So (nMg_2 /nSi_2) = 10^0.3 * 1 → nMg_2 =10^0.3 *nSi_2.

But nMg_2 is also (1e-5) nH_2.

So 1e-5 *nH_2 =10^0.3 *nSi_2 → nSi_2 = (1e-5 *nH_2 ) /10^0.3.

Which is nSi_2 ≈ (1e-5 /2 ) *nH_2 → since 10^0.3≈2 → nSi_2≈5e-6 *nH_2.

So now, we have nSi_1 = approx 2e-5 *nH_1 and nSi_2=5e-6*nH_2.

Wait, but we need the ratio nSi_1 /nSi_2.

So ratio = (2e-5 *nH_1) / (5e-6 *nH_2) )= (2e-5/5e-6) * (nH_1 /nH_2) ) = (4) * (nH_1/nH_2).

But wait, how do we find nH_1 /nH_2?

Wait, the issue is that the stars have different H densities. But since we don't have any data about their temperatures, pressures, etc., maybe we can assume that the hydrogen number density is the same as the Sun's? Or perhaps the ratio is not needed because H cancels out. Hmm, I'm not so sure.

Wait, no. Because the stars have different masses, but the photosphere's composition is about element ratios, not absolute densities. So perhaps the H density is not the same. But without information about their temperatures or other factors, perhaps the ratio of H in each star is the same as in the Sun? Or not. Hmm.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let's think differently. Maybe it's better to express everything in terms of solar ratios.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the H density is the same in both stars as in the Sun. But that might not be correct because the stars have different masses, but the photosphere's H density can vary based on temperature and pressure. But perhaps the problem expects us to assume that the H density ratio is 1, meaning nH_1 =nH_2. Let me proceed under that assumption. If that's wrong, the answer might be incorrect, but perhaps it's the intended approach.

So if nH_1 = nH_2, then the ratio is 4 *1 =4.

Wait, but 2e-5 / 5e-6 is 4, yes. So nSi_1 /nSi_2 =4.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is ~3.9, which is close to 4. But wait, I approximated 10^0.3 as 2, but actually, 10^0.3 is approximately 2 (since log10(2) ≈0.3010). So 10^0.3 is about 1.995, which is roughly 2, so the approximation is okay.

So the ratio would be around 4. But wait, the options have 3.9 as option A. That's close. But wait, maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations without approximating 10^0.3 as 2.

Compute 10^0.3 exactly. Let me remember that 10^0.3 is about 1.99526, so approximately 2. So maybe it's better to use 2 for simplicity.

Wait, but let's compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 10^0.3.

Using calculator-like thinking: 10^0.3 = e^(0.3 * ln10) ) ≈ e^(0.3*2.302585) )= e^(0.6907755) ≈ 1.99526.

So, in the calculation for Star_2:

nSi_2 = (1e-5 *nH_2 ) / (10^0.3) → (1e-5 /1.99526) *nH_2 ≈5.012e-6 *nH_2.

nSi_1 = (3.16e-5 *0.632) *nH_1 → Wait, no. Wait, earlier we have:

nSi_1 = (nFe_1) * (nSi_1/nFe_1) → nFe_1 = (3.16e-5)*nH_1. So nSi_1 = (3.16e-5)*(0.632)*nH_1.

0.632 is from 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun /nFe_sun), which is 10^0.3 * ( (1e-5) / (3.16e-5) )= (1e-5/3.16e-5) )= (1/3.16) ≈0.316. So 10^0.3 *0.316 ≈2 *0.316=0.632.

So nSi_1 =3.16e-5 *0.632 *nH_1 →3.16e-5 is 3.16*1e-5.

3.16e-5 *0.632 =3.16 *0.632 *1e-5.

3.16 *0.632 is approximately 2 (since 3 *0.6 is 1.8, 3.16*0.632 is about 2. So 2e-5 *nH_1.

So nSi_1 ≈2e-5 *nH_1.

nSi_2 = (1e-5 /1.99526) *nH_2 → approximately 5e-6 *nH_2.

So the ratio (nSi_1 /nSi_2) = (2e-5 *nH_1) / (5e-6 *nH_2) ) = (2e-5 /5e-6) * (nH_1/nH_2) )= (4) * (nH_1 /nH_2).

Wait, but we don't know the ratio of nH_1 to nH_2. Because the stars have different masses, but their photospheric H densities could vary. Hmm. How to handle that?

Wait, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that both stars have the same hydrogen density as the Sun, meaning nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2= nH_sun. But that might not be correct because the stars have different masses, but the photosphere's composition is about the ratios, not absolute densities.

Alternatively, perhaps the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] being zero indicates that the metallicity (Fe and Mg relative to H) is the same as the Sun. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 means nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun → so the Fe abundance relative to H is the same as Sun. Similarly, for Star_2, Mg/H is solar.

Wait, but that doesn't directly tell us about nH_1 and nH_2. Hmm. Maybe the problem expects us to assume that the overall H density is the same in both stars as in the Sun, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ratio nH_1/nH_2 is irrelevant because in the calculation it cancels out. Wait, no, in the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2, the H terms are in the same ratio as nH_1/nH_2.

Wait, but perhaps the problem is that I'm misunderstanding the [X/Fe] and [Mg/H] definitions. Let me double-check.

Wait, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun. So for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 → Fe/H = Sun's Fe/H.

Similarly, for Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 → Mg/H = Sun's Mg/H.

So, for Star_1:

nFe_1 /nH_1 = nFe_sun /nH_sun.

For Star_2:

nMg_2 /nH_2 =nMg_sun /nH_sun.

But what about nH_1 and nH_2? We don't have any data about how H compares between the stars. So perhaps the problem assumes that the H density is the same in both stars as in the Sun. But that's an assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the ratio of nH_1 and nH_2 using other information. But I don't see any other data given.

Wait, maybe the problem doesn't require considering nH_1 and nH_2. Because the ratio nSi_1/nSi_2 is (2e-5 *nH_1) / (5e-6 *nH_2) )= (4 *nH_1) /nH_2.

So what if nH_1/nH_2 =1? Then the ratio is 4. But wait, the options don't have exactly 4. Option A is ~3.9, which is very close.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me go through again.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3 → (nSi_1/nFe_1) = 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

We have nSi_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

nFe_sun =3.16e-5 *nH_sun.

So nSi_sun /nFe_sun = (1e-5) / (3.16e-5) )= 1/3.16 ≈0.316.

Thus, (nSi_1/nFe_1) = 10^0.3 * 0.316 ≈1.995 *0.316 ≈0.632.

And nFe_1 = (nFe_sun /nH_sun) *nH_1 =3.16e-5 *nH_1.

So nSi_1 = (nFe_1) *0.632 =3.16e-5 *nH_1 *0.632.

3.16e-5 *0.632 =approx 1.99e-5.

So nSi_1 ≈1.99e-5 *nH_1.

For Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (nMg_2/nSi_2) =10^0.3*(nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

nMg_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

nSi_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

So nMg_sun/nSi_sun=1.

Thus, (nMg_2/nSi_2)=1.995 → nMg_2=1.995 *nSi_2.

But [Mg/H]_2=0 →nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2 /nH_sun) )=1e-5 *nH_2.

Wait, because nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun →nMg_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH_2=1e-5 *nH_2.

So putting it together:

nMg_2 =1.995 *nSi_2 → 1e-5 *nH_2 =1.995 *nSi_2 → nSi_2= (1e-5 *nH_2 ) /1.995 ≈5.017e-6 *nH_2.

Thus, nSi_1≈1.99e-5 *nH_1.

nSi_2≈5.017e-6 *nH_2.

So the ratio is (1.99e-5 *nH_1)/(5.017e-6 *nH_2 )= (1.99e-5/5.017e-6) * (nH_1/nH_2 )= (approx 3.96) * (nH_1/nH_2 ).

Wait, 1.99e-5 /5.017e-6 = (1.99 /5.017) * (1e-5/1e-6) )= (0.3965) *10 ≈3.965.

So the ratio is approximately 3.965 * (nH_1/nH_2 ).

But without knowing nH_1/nH_2, we cannot proceed. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] data can help us find nH_1/nH_2.

Wait, for Star_1, [Fe/H]=0 → nFe_1/nH_1 =nFe_sun/nH_sun → which I think we've already used.

For Star_2, [Mg/H]=0 →nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun → which we've also used.

But how does that help with nH_1 and nH_2?

Wait, perhaps I can find the ratio nH_1/nH_2 using the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] abundances.

Wait, no, because both stars have [Fe/H]=0 and [Mg/H]=0. So their Fe and Mg are at solar abundance relative to H. But that doesn't give any info about the total H density in each star.

Wait, unless I'm missing something. Oh wait, the problem statement is about the photospheric composition, so perhaps the total number of atoms is the same as the Sun. No, that's probably not the case. The problem doesn't state that.

Hmm, I think I might be stuck because I can't find a way to determine the ratio of nH_1 to nH_2. But perhaps the problem expects me to assume that the H density is the same in both stars as in the Sun. That would make nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun. Then nH_1/nH_2=1, and the ratio would be ~3.965, which is approximately 3.9, so option A.

Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check:

Wait, when I calculated nSi_1 and nSi_2, I wrote:

nSi_1 =1.99e-5 *nH_1.

nSi_2≈5.017e-6 *nH_2.

Thus, the ratio is (1.99e-5 *nH_1 )/(5.017e-6 *nH_2 )= (1.99/5.017) *10 * (nH_1/nH_2 )

Which is approximately (0.3965) *10 =3.965.

So if nH_1/nH_2 =1, ratio is ~3.965.

Looking at the options, option A is ~3.9.

But wait, the options are A) ~3.9, B) ~12.6, etc. So A is the closest.

But wait, could there be another approach to this problem?

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Another approach is to express the silicon abundance in each star relative to the Sun and then take the ratio.

Let me try that.

For Star_1:

[Si/Fe]_1=0.3 → (nSi_1/nFe_1) =10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) → as before.

But also, [Fe/H]_1=0 → nFe_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun).

So nSi_1 =nFe_1 * (nSi_1/nFe_1) =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) * (10^0.3) * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun).

But nSi_sun = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *nH_sun.

So substituting: nSi_1 =nFe_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nFe_sun) ) → simplifies to nSi_1 = (nFe_sun *nSi_sun /nFe_sun) ) * (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^0.3 → nSi_sun * (nH_1/nH_sun) *10^0.3.

But wait, nSi_sun = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *nH_sun.

Hmm, perhaps another way. Let me compute [Si/H] for Star_1.

[Si/H]_1= [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 =0.3 +0=0.3.

So [Si/H]_1=0.3 → log( (nSi_1/nH_1)/(nSi_sun/nH_sun) )=0.3 → (nSi_1/nH_1)=10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun) → nSi_1 =10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *nH_1.

Similarly, for Star_2:

[Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → log( (nMg_2/nSi_2)/(nMg_sun/nSi_sun) )=0.3 → (nMg_2/nSi_2) =10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But [Mg/H]_2=0 → (nMg_2/nH_2)= (nMg_sun/nH_sun) → nMg_2 = (nMg_sun/nH_sun) *nH_2.

From the Sun's data, nMg_sun/nH_sun =1e-5.

nSi_sun/nH_sun =1e-5.

So nMg_sun/nSi_sun = (1e-5)/(1e-5)=1.

So (nMg_2/nSi_2)=10^0.3 *1 → nMg_2 =10^0.3 *nSi_2.

But nMg_2 = (1e-5) *nH_2.

So 1e-5 *nH_2 =1.995 *nSi_2 → nSi_2 = (1e-5 /1.995) *nH_2 ≈5.017e-6 *nH_2.

So nSi_1 is 10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *nH_1 → 1.995 * (1e-5) *nH_1 → 1.995e-5 *nH_1.

nSi_2 is 5.017e-6 *nH_2.

So the ratio (nSi_1/nSi_2)= (1.995e-5 *nH_1 ) / (5.017e-6 *nH_2 )= (1.995/5.017) *10 * (nH_1/nH_2).

As before, which is approximately 3.965 * (nH_1/nH_2).

But without knowing nH_1/nH_2, how can I proceed?

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the stars have the same hydrogen density as the Sun, meaning nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun → then nH_1/nH_2=1, and the ratio is ~3.965 → around 3.96.

So the option A is ~3.9, which is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Wait, maybe the [Fe/H] data is not directly about H, but about the star's overall metallicity. Hmm, no, [Fe/H] is the logarithm of (Fe/H) relative to the Sun.

Wait, another approach: perhaps express the silicon abundance in both stars relative to the Sun and then take the ratio.

For Star_1:

[Si/H]_1= [Si/Fe]_1 + [Fe/H]_1 =0.3 +0=0.3.

So [Si/H]_1=0.3 → (nSi_1/nH_1) =10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun).

Similarly, for Star_2, we can compute [Si/H]_2.

Wait, but Star_2's [Mg/Si] is given, so perhaps I can compute [Si/H]_2.

Wait, [Mg/Si]_2=0.3 → (nMg_2/nSi_2)/(nMg_sun/nSi_sun)=10^0.3 → (nMg_2/nSi_2) =10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun).

But [Mg/H]_2=0 →nMg_2/nH_2 =nMg_sun/nH_sun → nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

So, from [Mg/Si]_2:

nMg_2/nSi_2=10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) → nMg_2=10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *nSi_2.

But nMg_2 =nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun).

So:

nMg_sun * (nH_2/nH_sun) =10^0.3 * (nMg_sun/nSi_sun) *nSi_2.

Divide both sides by nMg_sun:

(nH_2/nH_sun) =10^0.3 * (1/nSi_sun) *nSi_2.

So, nSi_2 = (nH_2/nH_sun) *nSi_sun *10^-0.3.

But nSi_sun = (nSi_sun/nH_sun) ) *nH_sun =1e-5 *nH_sun.

So,

nSi_2= (nH_2/nH_sun) *1e-5 *nH_sun *10^-0.3 → nSi_2 =1e-5 *nH_2 *10^-0.3.

But 10^-0.3 is 1/(10^0.3)=1/1.995≈0.501.

So,

nSi_2=1e-5 *nH_2 *0.501 → approx 5.01e-6 *nH_2.

Which matches what I had earlier.

For Star_1, [Si/H]_1=0.3 → nSi_1=10^0.3 * (nSi_sun/nH_sun) *nH_1.

nSi_sun/nH_sun=1e-5.

So nSi_1=1.995e-5 *nH_1.

So the ratio is nSi_1/nSi_2= (1.995e-5 nH_1)/(5.01e-6 nH_2 )= (1.995e-5 /5.01e-6) * (nH_1/nH_2 )= (≈3.98) * (nH_1/nH_2 ).

But without knowing nH_1/nH_2, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the H density is the same in both stars as in the Sun. So nH_1 =nH_sun and nH_2 =nH_sun. Then, the ratio is 3.98, approximately 3.98, which is close to option A, 3.9.

But another thought: perhaps the ratio nH_1/nH_2 can be determined from other aspects. For example, the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] are zero, but perhaps it's about the overall metallicity. But I can't find a way to get the ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem expects the ratio to be about 4, so option A is correct.


To determine the ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2, we analyze the given elemental abundances and use the provided solar photospheric composition. The key steps are as follows:

### Star_1 Analysis:
1. **[Fe/H]_1 = 0**: This indicates that the iron-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_1 is the same as in the Sun. Thus, \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} / n_{\text{H,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
2. **[Si/Fe]_1 = 0.3**: Using the definition of the abundance ratio:
   \[
   \log_{10} \left( \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}} / n_{\text{Fe,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{Fe,sun}}} \right) = 0.3
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Fe,1}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe,sun}}}.
   \]
   Substituting \( n_{\text{Fe,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}} \), we find:
   \[
   n_{\text{Si,1}} = n_{\text{Fe,sun}} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}{n_{\text{Fe,sun}}}.
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   n_{\text{Si,1}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,sun}}} \cdot n_{\text{Si,sun}}.
   \]
   Using \( n_{\text{Si,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} = 10^{-5} \), we get:
   \[
   n_{\text{Si,1}} = 1.995 \cdot 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}}.
   \]

### Star_2 Analysis:
1. **[Mg/H]_2 = 0**: This indicates that the magnesium-to-hydrogen ratio in Star_2 is the same as in the Sun. Thus, \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} \).
2. **[Mg/Si]_2 = 0.3**: Using the definition of the abundance ratio:
   \[
   \log_{10} \left( \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}} / n_{\text{Si,2}}}{n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{Si,sun}}} \right) = 0.3
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = 10^{0.3} \cdot \frac{n_{\text{Mg,sun}}}{n_{\text{Si,sun}}}.
   \]
   Substituting \( n_{\text{Mg,2}} = n_{\text{Mg,sun}} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}} \), we find:
   \[
   n_{\text{Si,2}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg,2}}}{10^{0.3}} = \frac{n_{\text{Mg,sun}} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}} / n_{\text{H,sun}}}{10^{0.3}}.
   \]
   Using \( n_{\text{Mg,sun}} / n_{\text{H,sun}} = 10^{-5} \), we get:
   \[
   n_{\text{Si,2}} = \frac{10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}}}{10^{0.3}} = 5.017 \cdot 10^{-6} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}}.
   \]

### Ratio of Silicon Atoms:
The ratio of silicon atoms in the photospheres of Star_1 and Star_2 is:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{1.995 \cdot 10^{-5} \cdot n_{\text{H,1}}}{5.017 \cdot 10^{-6} \cdot n_{\text{H,2}}}.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} = \frac{1.995}{5.017} \cdot 10 \cdot \frac{n_{\text{H,1}}}{n_{\text{H,2}}}.
\]
Assuming \( n_{\text{H,1}} / n_{\text{H,2}} = 1 \) (i.e., the hydrogen density is the same in both stars), the ratio becomes:
\[
\frac{n_{\text{Si,1}}}{n_{\text{Si,2}}} \approx 3.96.
\]

### Final Answer:
The closest option to the calculated ratio is **A) ~3.9**.
