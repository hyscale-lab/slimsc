Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about electrons in p orbitals. Hmm. Let's try to break it down step by step.

The question says that we have two electrons in p orbital angular momentum states. We're ignoring their spin angular momentum, so I don't have to worry about that part. The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. So, that means each electron has an orbital angular momentum quantum number l of 1, right? Because l1 and l2 are both 1. The total angular momentum quantum number l is 2, and m is -1.

Wait, the state is |l1, l2, l, m> = |1,1,2,-1>. So l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1. I need to find the joint probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues of -ħ. That is, when I measure L1z and L2z, both give me -ħ.

So, L1z is the z-component of the orbital angular momentum of the first electron, and L2z for the second. Each of these operators would have eigenvalues mħ, right? Because Lz |l, m> = mħ |l, m>.

Wait, but in this case, the electrons are in a coupled state, so I think I need to express this state in terms of the product of individual states. Because the given state is a coupled state, combining the individual angular momenta.

I remember that when combining angular momenta, you can express the coupled state |l1, l2, L, M> as a linear combination of the product states |l1, m1> |l2, m2> where m1 + m2 = M. Or wait, is that right? Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, no, actually, the coupled states are built from the product states. The total state is a combination of the possible ways to get M from m1 and m2. So for each possible m1 and m2 such that m1 + m2 = M, you have a term in the expansion.

So in this case, M is -1. So the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a combination of |1, m1> |1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

What are the possible m1 and m2? For each electron, m can be -1, 0, +1. So for two electrons, all possible combinations where m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible pairs:
m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum is -1
m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum is -1

Wait, any others? m1 = -2? No, because each electron's m can only be from -1 to +1. So those are the two possibilities.

So the coupled state |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1> would be a linear combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

But wait, there's a normalization factor involved. The exact coefficients depend on how these product states combine to give the coupled state. The general formula for the state is:

|L, M> = sum_{m1, m2} [ <m1, m2 | L, M> ] |m1, m2>

Where the coefficients are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. I'm a bit rusty on that, but I think for L=2, M=-1, the state would be a combination of the product states where m1 + m2 = -1.

So for M=-1, the possible combinations are m1=-1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1. The coefficients for these two terms are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two l=1 (p orbital) angular momenta. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

I remember that for L=2, the possible M values are 2, 1, 0, -1, -2.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=2, M=-1 would be the expansion into the m1 and m2 states where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the expansion is:

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( (1/6) ) |m1=-1, m2=0> + sqrt( (5/6) ) |m1=0, m2=-1>

Wait, no. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are sqrt(1/6) and sqrt(5/6). Because the coefficients depend on the possible ways to get M from the product states.

Wait, another approach: the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 particles for L=2, M=-1 would be:

The state |2, -1> is a sum of |1, m1> |1, m2>, where m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible (m1, m2) pairs:

(-1, 0), (0, -1)

The coefficients would be given by some combination. Let me look up the formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

Alternatively, I remember that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients can be determined using recursion relations or known tables. Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for L=2, M=-1, the expansion is:

sqrt( (2)/3 ) |m1=0, m2=-1> + sqrt( (1)/3 ) |m1=-1, m2=0> ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of the possible ways. For two p orbitals (l=1 each), the possible total L can be 0, 1, or 2.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=2 and M=-1 would be the sum of the possible product states that add up to M=-1.

The coefficient for each term is calculated based on the Wigner 3-j symbols or some other method. Alternatively, perhaps I can look for a pattern.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think about the ladder operators. The raising and lowering operators for angular momentum.

Wait, another approach: the probability of each term in the expansion is the square of the coefficient. Since we're looking for the probability that both L1z and L2z have eigenvalues -ħ, we're looking for the term in the expansion where m1 = -1 and m2 = -1. Oh wait, no, because each m corresponds to Lz eigenvalue mħ. So if both m1 and m2 are -1, then M would be m1 + m2 = -2. But the state here is M=-1, so that can't happen.

So in the state |1,1,2,-1>, the possible terms are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

If I want both m1 and m2 to be -1, that would correspond to M=-2. But our state is M=-1, so the m1 and m2 can't both be -1. So in this state, there are no terms where both m1 and m2 are -1.

Which means the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ is zero.

Wait, but wait a second. The possible terms are m1=-1 and m2=0, and m1=0 and m2=-1. So in both cases, one electron has m=-1 and the other has m=0.

So when you measure L1z, you can get either -ħ or 0. Similarly for L2z, either 0 or -ħ.

So the joint probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ is zero because in the state |1,1,2,-1>, there are no terms where both m1 and m2 are -1.

Therefore, the probability is zero.

Let me confirm that. Another way: the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a linear combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1. So, the possible m1 and m2 are:

m1 = -1, m2 = 0

m1 = 0, m2 = -1

So in each term, only one electron has m=-1, the other has m=0. So when you measure L1z and L2z, one would be -ħ and the other 0.

So the joint probability that both are -ħ is zero.

Hence, the correct answer is D) 0.

The problem involves two electrons in a coupled angular momentum state $|1,1,2,-1>$, where $l_1 = 1$, $l_2 = 1$, $L = 2$, and $M = -1$. The goal is to determine the joint probability of measuring the eigenvalues of $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ as $-\hbar$ for both electrons.

The coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ can be expressed as a linear combination of product states $|m_1, m_2>$, where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the $z$-components of the orbital angular momentum for the two electrons. Since $M = -1$, the possible pairs $(m_1, m_2)$ must satisfy $m_1 + m_2 = -1$. These pairs are:

- $m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0$
- $m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1$

Thus, the coupled state is a superposition of these two product states. For example, it might look like:

\[
|1,1,2,-1> = c_1 |m_1=-1, m_2=0> + c_2 |m_1=0, m_2=-1>,
\]

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are coefficients determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. Regardless of the exact values of $c_1$ and $c_2$, the state does not include a term where both $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$, as this would correspond to $M = -2$, which is not the case here.

If both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ were measured to have eigenvalues $-\hbar$, this would require $m_1 = -1$ and $m_2 = -1$. However, since the coupled state $|1,1,2,-1>$ does not include such a term, the probability of this outcome is zero.

Therefore, the joint probability of measuring $-\hbar$ for both $L_{1z}$ and $L_{2z}$ is:

Wait, any others? m1 = -2? No, because each electron's m can only be from -1 to +1. So those are the two possibilities.

So the coupled state |l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1> would be a linear combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

But wait, there's a normalization factor involved. The exact coefficients depend on how these product states combine to give the coupled state. The general formula for the state is:

|L, M> = sum_{m1, m2} [ <m1, m2 | L, M> ] |m1, m2>

Where the coefficients are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients. I'm a bit rusty on that, but I think for L=2, M=-1, the state would be a combination of the product states where m1 + m2 = -1.

So for M=-1, the possible combinations are m1=-1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1. The coefficients for these two terms are determined by the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

Wait, I think the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two l=1 (p orbital) angular momenta. The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

I remember that for L=2, the possible M values are 2, 1, 0, -1, -2.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=2, M=-1 would be the expansion into the m1 and m2 states where m1 + m2 = -1.

So the expansion is:

|1,1,2,-1> = sqrt( (1/6) ) |m1=-1, m2=0> + sqrt( (5/6) ) |m1=0, m2=-1>

Wait, no. Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the coefficients are sqrt(1/6) and sqrt(5/6). Because the coefficients depend on the possible ways to get M from the product states.

Wait, another approach: the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining two l=1 particles for L=2, M=-1 would be:

The state |2, -1> is a sum of |1, m1> |1, m2>, where m1 + m2 = -1.

Possible (m1, m2) pairs:

(-1, 0), (0, -1)

The coefficients would be given by some combination. Let me look up the formula for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1, L=2, M=-1.

Alternatively, I remember that the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients can be determined using recursion relations or known tables. Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that for L=2, M=-1, the expansion is:

sqrt( (2)/3 ) |m1=0, m2=-1> + sqrt( (1)/3 ) |m1=-1, m2=0> ?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of the possible ways. For two p orbitals (l=1 each), the possible total L can be 0, 1, or 2.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for L=2 and M=-1 would be the sum of the possible product states that add up to M=-1.

So in the state |1,1,2,-1>, the possible terms are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

If I want both m1 and m2 to be -1, that would correspond to M=-2. But our state is M=-1, so the m1 and m2 can't both be -1. So in this state, there are no terms where both m1 and m2 are -1.

Which means the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ħ is zero.

Wait, but wait a second. The possible terms are m1=-1 and m2=0, and m1=0 and m2=-1. So in both cases, one electron has m=-1 and the other has m=0.

So when you measure L1z, you can get either -ħ or 0. Similarly for L2z, either 0 or -ħ.

So the joint probability of both L1z and L2z being -ħ is zero because in the state |1,1,2,-1>, there are no terms where both m1 and m2 are -1.

Therefore, the probability is zero.

Let me confirm that. Another way: the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a linear combination of |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1. So, the possible m1 and m2 are:

m1 = -1, m2 = 0

m1 = 0, m2 = -1

So in each term, only one electron has m=-1, the other has m=0. So when you measure L1z and L2z, one would be -ħ and the other 0.

So the joint probability that both are -ħ is zero.

Hence, the correct answer is D) 0.
