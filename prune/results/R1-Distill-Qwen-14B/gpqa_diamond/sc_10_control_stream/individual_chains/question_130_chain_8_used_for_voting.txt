Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, specifically about detecting hydrogen clouds using optical telescopes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. I remember that Lyman alpha is a specific emission line in hydrogen, usually in the ultraviolet range. So when these clouds absorb this light, it's called the Lyman-alpha forest, I think.

The question is asking about the lower limit on the redshift of these objects such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. So redshift determines how much the wavelength has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe. The higher the redshift, the more the wavelength shifts to the red end.

Optical telescopes can't see ultraviolet light because the atmosphere absorbs it. So if the quasar's Lyman-alpha emission is shifted into the optical range, that's when it becomes detectable from the ground. Wait, but wait—when the quasar's light is redshifted, the absorption lines (like Lyman alpha) also get redshifted. So the hydrogen cloud's absorption line needs to be in the optical range for us to see it.

So the Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 Angstroms, which is 121.6 nm, right? That's in the far ultraviolet. For ground-based optical telescopes, the usable wavelength is from about 400 nm (violet) up to maybe 700 nm (red). So we need to find the redshift z where 1216 Angstroms is redshifted into the optical range.

The formula for redshift is lambda_observed = lambda_rest * (1 + z). So we need lambda_observed to be less than or equal to the maximum wavelength that optical telescopes can observe, which I think is around 700 nm or 7000 Angstroms. Wait, no—wait, optical wavelengths are up to about 1 micrometer (1000 nm), which is 10,000 Angstroms. But maybe the question is more about just getting into the range that's accessible through the atmosphere, which is visible light, so maybe up to around 700 nm.

So the Lyman-alpha wavelength at rest is 1216 Angstroms (121.6 nm). To get it into the optical range, say up to 700 nm (7000 Angstroms), we set up the equation:

lambda_observed = 1216 * (1 + z) <= 7000 Angstroms.

Wait, no, wait: 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. Wait, no, I think I messed up the units. Let me clarify. 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. Optical wavelengths are about 400 nm to 700 nm (violet to red). So to get the Lyman-alpha line into the optical range, the observed wavelength must be between 400 nm and 700 nm.

Wait, no, wait. Because when something is redshifted, its wavelength increases. So if the cloud is at redshift z, the Lyman-alpha absorption line will be at 1216*(1+z) Angstroms. But wait, wait—if the quasar's light is emitted at 1216 Angstroms, but when it's emitted by the quasar, which is at a higher redshift, and then the hydrogen cloud is at a lower redshift. Wait, no—wait, the quasar is a background object, so the hydrogen cloud is in front of it. So the light from the quasar passes through the cloud, which is at some redshift z. So the cloud's own Lyman alpha absorption is at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame. But when we observe it, the wavelength would have been shifted by the cloud's redshift.

Wait, but actually, the quasar's light is emitted at a certain redshift, and the hydrogen cloud is between us and the quasar, so the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's. So when the quasar's light passes through the cloud, the cloud absorbs at the quasar's frame's Lyman alpha, which is itself redshifted. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the observed wavelength. The Lyman alpha line from the cloud is at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's rest frame. But when we observe it, the wavelength is stretched by (1 + z_cloud). So the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z_cloud). We need this observed wavelength to be in the optical range so that ground-based telescopes can see it.

Wait, but wait. No, no, no. Wait, the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud. The hydrogen cloud is at a redshift z. So the quasar's emitted Lyman alpha is at 1216 Angstroms, but when the light reaches the cloud, the cloud sees the quasar's light redshifted. Wait, no: the cloud's frame sees the quasar's light redshifted. So in the cloud's frame, the quasar's Lyman alpha would be at a longer wavelength than 1216 Angstroms.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The quasar emits light, which then passes through the hydrogen cloud. The cloud causes absorption at the quasar's Lyman alpha wavelength in the cloud's frame. So if the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud, then in the cloud's frame, the quasar's light is redshifted. So the cloud's own Lyman alpha is at 1216 Angstroms in its rest frame, but the quasar's Lyman alpha (emitted at 1216) would be longer.

Wait, maybe I'm making this more complicated. Let me try to approach it differently.

The problem is about the Lyman-alpha forest. These are clouds of hydrogen at various redshifts z. Each cloud will absorb the quasar's light at a wavelength of 1216*(1 + z) Angstroms in our observed frame. Because each cloud is at a higher redshift than the quasar, no, wait: the quasar is behind the cloud, so the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's. Wait, no, wait: the quasar is at a higher redshift than the cloud because the cloud is in front of it. So the cloud's redshift is lower than the quasar's.

But the absorption line we see is at 1216*(1 + z_cloud). Because for each cloud, the Lyman-alpha absorption occurs at a wavelength of 1216*(1 + z_cloud). So for us to observe this absorption in the optical range, 1216*(1 + z_cloud) must be less than or equal to the maximum optical wavelength our telescope can observe. Let's assume the maximum is around 700 nm, which is 7000 Angstroms.

So 1216*(1 + z) <= 7000.

Wait, 1216 Angstroms is the rest wavelength. So when we observe it, if the cloud is at redshift z, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z). So we need 1216*(1 + z) <= 7000 Angstroms (which is 700 nm, red end of visible spectrum).

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the units right. 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms. So the maximum wavelength in optical is 7000 Angstroms.

So 1216*(1 + z) <= 7000.

Divide both sides by 1216:

(1 + z) <= 7000 / 1216.

Calculating that: 7000 / 1216 ≈ 5.756.

So 1 + z ≈ 5.756 → z ≈ 4.756.

Wait, but wait—that would mean that the cloud's redshift must be less than or equal to ~4.756 for the Lyman-alpha line to be observed in the optical. But wait, no. Because if the observed wavelength is larger than 7000 Angstroms, it's beyond the optical range (into infrared, perhaps), which we can't see with ground-based optical telescopes.

Wait, but if the cloud is at a higher redshift, the observed wavelength is longer, which is beyond optical. So the maximum redshift where Lyman-alpha is still in optical is when 1216*(1 + z) = 7000.

So solving for z, we get z = (7000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 5.756 - 1 = 4.756. So z = about 4.756.

Wait, but that's the upper limit, not the lower limit. The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift. So I'm getting a bit confused here. Oh wait, no—the lower limit would be when the Lyman-alpha line is just entering the optical range. Wait, no, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the Lyman-alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame. When observed, it's at 1216*(1 + z). For the line to be in the optical, the observed wavelength needs to be longer than the ultraviolet. So the minimum redshift would be when the observed wavelength is just at the start of the optical range, which is about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms).

So for the line to be in the optical, 1216*(1 + z) >= 4000 Angstroms.

Wait, because if (1216)*(1 + z) is less than 4000, the wavelength would be in the UV, which optical telescopes can't see. So the lower limit is when (1 + z) = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.290.

So z ≈ 3.290 - 1 = 2.290.

Wait, so the redshift z must be at least about 2.29 for the Lyman-alpha absorption line to be observed in the optical. So the lower limit is z ≈ 2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is just above that. Option D is 1.9, which is below, so the lower limit would be around 2.29, so the minimum z is about 2.29, meaning any cloud with z >= 2.29 can be detected. So the lower limit is when z is about 2.29, so the lower limit is approximately 2.3.

Wait, but wait—did I mix up the lower and upper limits? Because if the redshift is higher, the observed wavelength is longer (more into the infrared), which would be outside the optical range. So the maximum z where the line is still in optical is when observed wavelength is 7000 Angstroms (as we calculated earlier, z≈4.756). So the lower limit on z is when the observed wavelength is at the start of the optical range, 4000 Angstroms.

So z = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ (3.290) -1 = 2.290.

So the minimum redshift is approximately 2.29, meaning any z >= 2.29 would have their Lyman-alpha lines in the optical. So the lower limit on the redshift is about z=2.29. So looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is just above this, and option D is 1.9, which is below. So the lower limit is 2.29, so the correct answer would be the option just above that, which is 2.4 (option C).

Wait, but wait. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. So any cloud with z >= lower_limit will have their Lyman-alpha line in the optical. So the lower limit is the minimum z required for the line to be in the optical range. So if the cloud has a z less than that, the line would be in the UV, not observable by optical telescopes.

So the lower limit z is about 2.29, which is approximately 2.3. So the options are C) 2.4 and D) 1.9. So 2.4 is the closest higher value. So the lower limit is about 2.3, which is just below 2.4. So does that mean that the lower limit is 2.3, so anything higher than that is acceptable?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let's calculate 4000 / 1216.

Calculating 4000 ÷ 1216:

1216 * 3 = 3648 → 3.290 gives 4000.

Wait, 1216 * 3.290 = ?

Let me compute it:

1216 * 3 = 3648.

1216 * 0.29 = let's compute 0.2 * 1216 = 243.2, 0.09*1216=109.44 → total 243.2 +109.44=352.64.

So 3.29 *1216 = 3648 + 352.64= 4000.64 → which is just over 4000. So 3.29 *1216 = 4000.64 Angstroms.

So 1 + z = 3.29 → z ≈ 2.29.

So the minimum z is approximately 2.29. So the lower limit is about 2.29, so any cloud with z >= 2.29 can be observed in optical.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29, but the options don't have that. So the question is about the lower limit, so the minimal z where the absorption can be detected. So the minimal z is when 1216*(1 + z) = 4000 Angstroms.

So the correct answer would be the option closest to 2.29, which is option C, 2.4 (since 2.4 is the next higher option). Or perhaps the question is about the minimal z so that the line is in the optical, so the lower limit is z=2.3.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the question is asking. It says, "Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this object such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes."

So the lower limit is when the Lyman-alpha absorption is just entering the optical range. So the minimal z is when 1216*(1 + z) = 4000 Angstroms.

So z=(4000/1216) -1 = 3.290 -1 = 2.29.

So any clouds with z >= 2.29 can be detected. So the lower limit is 2.29; any object with z above that would have their Lyman-alpha lines in the optical.

So the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So the correct lower limit is approximately 2.29, which is closest to option C) 2.4. So the answer should be C) 2.4.

To determine the lower limit on the redshift \( z \) of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman-alpha absorption lines can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the redshifted wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line. The rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line is \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \). For the line to be observed in the optical range, the observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) must satisfy \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \leq \lambda_{\text{obs}} \leq 7000 \, \text{Å} \), as optical telescopes cannot detect wavelengths shorter than 4000 Å (ultraviolet).

The relationship between the observed wavelength and redshift is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

To find the lower limit on \( z \), we consider the minimum observed wavelength in the optical range, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 4000 \, \text{Å} \). Solving for \( z \):

\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1 = \frac{4000}{1216} - 1 \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z \approx 2.29 \). Any cloud with \( z \geq 2.29 \) will have its Lyman-alpha absorption line in the optical range and can be detected with ground-based optical telescopes.

Among the given options:

- **A) 3**: This is higher than the calculated lower limit and would correspond to a redshift where the Lyman-alpha line is well into the optical range.
- **B) 1.2**: This is much lower than the calculated lower limit and would result in the Lyman-alpha line being in the ultraviolet, undetectable by optical telescopes.
- **C) 2.4**: This is slightly higher than the calculated lower limit (\( 2.29 \)) and is the closest option to the actual value.
- **D) 1.9**: This is also lower than the calculated lower limit and would result in the Lyman-alpha line being in the ultraviolet.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C) 2.4**, as it is the smallest option that satisfies the condition \( z \geq 2.29 \).

Let's assume the maximum is around 700 nm, which is 7000 Angstroms.

So 1216*(1 + z) <= 7000.

Wait, 1216 Angstroms is the rest wavelength. So when we observe it, if the cloud is at redshift z, the observed wavelength is 1216*(1 + z). So we need 1216*(1 + z) <= 7000 Angstroms (which is 700 nm, red end of visible spectrum).

Wait, no, wait. Let me get the units right. 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. 700 nm is 7000 Angstroms. So the maximum wavelength in optical is 7000 Angstroms.

So 1216*(1 + z) <= 7000.

Divide both sides by 1216:

(1 + z) <= 7000 / 1216.

Calculating that: 7000 / 1216 ≈ 5.756.

So 1 + z ≈ 5.756 → z ≈ 4.756.

Wait, but wait—that would mean that the cloud's redshift must be less than or equal to ~4.756 for the Lyman-alpha line to be observed in the optical. But wait, no. Because if the observed wavelength is larger than 7000 Angstroms, it's beyond the optical range (into infrared, perhaps), which we can't see with ground-based optical telescopes.

Wait, but if the cloud is at a higher redshift, the observed wavelength is longer, which is beyond optical. So the maximum redshift where Lyman-alpha is still in optical is when 1216*(1 + z) = 7000.

So solving for z, we get z = (7000 / 1216) - 1 ≈ 5.756 - 1 = 4.756. So z = about 4.756.

Wait, but that's the upper limit, not the lower limit. The question asks for the lower limit on the redshift. So I'm getting a bit confused here. Oh wait, no—the lower limit would be when the Lyman-alpha line is just entering the optical range. Wait, no, no. Let me think again.

Wait, the Lyman-alpha line is at 1216 Angstroms in the cloud's frame. When observed, it's at 1216*(1 + z). For the line to be in the optical, the observed wavelength needs to be longer than the ultraviolet. So the minimum redshift would be when the observed wavelength is just at the start of the optical range, which is about 400 nm (4000 Angstroms).

So for the line to be in the optical, 1216*(1 + z) >= 4000 Angstroms.

Wait, because if (1216)*(1 + z) is less than 4000, the wavelength would be in the UV, which optical telescopes can't see. So the lower limit is when (1 + z) = 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.290.

So z ≈ 3.290 - 1 = 2.290.

Wait, so the redshift z must be at least about 2.29 for the Lyman-alpha absorption line to be observed in the optical. So the lower limit is z ≈ 2.29.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is just above that. Option D is 1.9, which is below, so the lower limit would be around 2.29, so the minimum z is about 2.29, meaning any cloud with z >= 2.29 can be detected. So the lower limit is when z is about 2.29, so the lower limit is approximately 2.3.

Wait, but wait—did I mix up the lower and upper limits? Because if the redshift is higher, the observed wavelength is longer (more into the infrared), which would be outside the optical range. So the maximum z where the line is still in optical is when observed wavelength is 7000 Angstroms (as we calculated earlier, z≈4.756). So the lower limit on z is when the observed wavelength is at the start of the optical range, 4000 Angstroms.

So z = (4000/1216) -1 ≈ (3.290) -1 = 2.290.

So the minimum redshift is approximately 2.29, meaning any z >= 2.29 would have their Lyman-alpha lines in the optical. So the lower limit on the redshift is about z=2.29. So looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is just above this, and option D is 1.9, which is below. So the lower limit is 2.29, so the correct answer would be the option just above that, which is 2.4 (option C).

Wait, but wait. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. So any cloud with z >= lower_limit will have their Lyman-alpha line in the optical. So the lower limit is the minimum z required for the line to be in the optical range. So if the cloud has a z less than that, the line would be in the UV, not observable by optical telescopes.

So the lower limit z is about 2.29, which is approximately 2.3. So the options are C) 2.4 and D) 1.9. So 2.4 is the closest higher value. So the lower limit is about 2.3, which is just below 2.4. So does that mean that the lower limit is 2.3, so anything higher than that is acceptable?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Let's calculate 4000 / 1216.

Calculating 4000 ÷ 1216:

1216 * 3 = 3648 → 3.290 gives 4000.

Wait, 1216 * 3.290 = ?

Let me compute it:

1216 * 3 = 3648.

1216 * 0.29 = let's compute 0.2 * 1216 = 243.2, 0.09*1216=109.44 → total 243.2 +109.44=352.64.

So 3.29 *1216 = 3648 + 352.64= 4000.64 → which is just over 4000. So 3.29 *1216 = 4000.64 Angstroms.

So 1 + z = 3.29 → z ≈ 2.29.

So the minimum z is approximately 2.29. So the lower limit is about 2.29, so any cloud with z >= 2.29 can be observed in optical.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is higher than 2.29. So the lower limit is 2.29, but the options don't have that. So the question is about the lower limit, so the minimal z where the absorption can be detected. So the minimal z is when 1216*(1 + z) = 4000 Angstroms.

So the correct answer would be the option closest to 2.29, which is option C, 2.4 (since 2.4 is the next higher option). Or perhaps the question is about the minimal z so that the line is in the optical, so the lower limit is z=2.3.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the question is asking. It says, "Estimate the lower limit on the redshift of this object such that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes."

So the lower limit is when the Lyman-alpha absorption is just entering the optical range. So the minimal z is when 1216*(1 + z) = 4000 Angstroms.

So z=(4000/1216) -1 = 3.290 -1 = 2.29.

So any clouds with z >= 2.29 can be detected. So the lower limit is 2.29; any object with z above that would have their Lyman-alpha lines in the optical.

So the options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

So the correct lower limit is approximately 2.29, which is closest to option C) 2.4. So the answer should be C) 2.4.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift \( z \) of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman-alpha absorption lines can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the redshifted wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line. The rest wavelength of the Lyman-alpha line is \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \). For the line to be observed in the optical range, the observed wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} \) must satisfy \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \leq \lambda_{\text{obs}} \leq 7000 \, \text{Å} \), as optical telescopes cannot detect wavelengths shorter than 4000 Å (ultraviolet).

The relationship between the observed wavelength and redshift is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = \lambda_{\text{rest}} \cdot (1 + z)
\]

To find the lower limit on \( z \), we consider the minimum observed wavelength in the optical range, \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 4000 \, \text{Å} \). Solving for \( z \):

\[
z = \frac{\lambda_{\text{obs}}}{\lambda_{\text{rest}}} - 1 = \frac{4000}{1216} - 1 \approx 3.29 - 1 = 2.29
\]

Thus, the lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z \approx 2.29 \). Any cloud with \( z \geq 2.29 \) will have its Lyman-alpha absorption line in the optical range and can be detected with ground-based optical telescopes.

Among the given options:

- **A) 3**: This is higher than the calculated lower limit and would correspond to a redshift where the Lyman-alpha line is well into the optical range.
- **B) 1.2**: This is much lower than the calculated lower limit and would result in the Lyman-alpha line being in the ultraviolet, undetectable by optical telescopes.
- **C) 2.4**: This is slightly higher than the calculated lower limit (\( 2.29 \)) and is the closest option to the actual value.
- **D) 1.9**: This is also lower than the calculated lower limit and would result in the Lyman-alpha line being in the ultraviolet.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C) 2.4**, as it is the smallest option that satisfies the condition \( z \geq 2.29 \).
