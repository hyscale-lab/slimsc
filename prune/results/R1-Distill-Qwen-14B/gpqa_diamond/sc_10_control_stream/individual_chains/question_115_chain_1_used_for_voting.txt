Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate and produce two photons. The energies of both photons are the same. One photon is moving in the upper-right direction, and the other in the lower-right direction. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm. So, first, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and energy and momentum are conserved. Since the two photons have equal energy, their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction in some way. Wait, no, the question says each photon has the same energy, but their directions are upper-right and lower-right.

Wait, but photons carry momentum, right? The momentum of a photon is p = E/c, and because E is the same for both photons, their magnitudes of momentum are the same. But their directions are symmetric in some way.

Let me think about the setup. Electron is moving left to right (let's say positive x-direction) with gamma =4. Positron is moving right to left (so negative x-direction) with gamma=2.

Wait, wait. No, the positron is moving from the right. So if the electron is coming from the left (so moving to the right), and the positron is coming from the right (so moving to the left). So their velocities are in opposite directions.

Wait, but their gamma factors are given. The electron has gamma=4, positron gamma=2. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1-(v^2/c^2)), so it depends on the speed.

The problem says they collide and annihilate into two photons. So the initial total energy and momentum must equal the total energy and momentum of the photons.

But wait, the annihilation of an electron and positron typically produces two photons moving in opposite directions to conserve momentum. But in this case, it's two photons moving in upper and lower right directions. So that's interesting. So maybe they're moving at some angle relative to the original direction.

Let me think about conservation of momentum. The initial momentum of the system is the sum of the momenta of the electron and the positron.

So for the electron, moving to the right (positive x direction). Its momentum is gamma * m_e * v_e. But since gamma is 4, and we can write it as gamma = 4, so the momentum p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Similarly, the positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is negative in the x direction. So its momentum p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p. But since it's moving to the left, its velocity is negative, so p_p is negative.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute their relativistic momenta in terms of gamma and mass.

Wait, the relativistic momentum for a particle is p = gamma * m * v. Alternatively, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and v can be expressed in terms of beta (beta = v/c). So p = gamma m_e beta c.

Alternatively, since for a particle, E^2 = (pc c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. But maybe using energy and momentum conservation is the way to go.

But let's first compute the initial total energy and momentum.

The electron and positron are each other's antiparticles. So their rest mass energies are each m_e c^2.

The electron's energy is E_e = gamma_e * m_e c^2.

Similarly, the positron's energy is E_p = gamma_p * m_e c^2.

So E_e = 4 m_e c², E_p = 2 m_e c².

Total initial energy is E_total = E_e + E_p = (4 + 2) m_e c² = 6 m_e c².

Momentum: the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m_e v_e. The positron is moving opposite, so its momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e v_p (but v_p is opposite, so the sign of p_p is negative? Wait, no, because v_p is in the opposite direction. So if the positron is moving to the left, its velocity is negative, so p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p, which would be negative.

So let's compute the velocities. Well, we can use the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), where beta = v/c.

For the electron, gamma_e =4. So beta_e = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_e)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4.

Similarly, positron's gamma_p =2. Beta_p = sqrt(1 - (1/4)) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

So velocity of electron v_e = beta_e c = (sqrt(15)/4) c, in positive x direction.

Velocity of positron v_p = beta_p c in negative x direction, so v_p = - (sqrt(3)/2) c.

Now, their momenta:

p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e c sqrt(15).

Similarly, p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 * m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2 c) ) = - m_e c sqrt(3).

So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because the positron's velocity is to the left, so its momentum should be negative. So the total momentum is p_e (positive) plus p_p (negative).

Wait, let me recompute.

p_e = 4 m_e (sqrt(15)/4 c) = m_e c sqrt(15). Positive.

p_p = 2 m_e * ( - sqrt(3)/2 c ) = - m_e c sqrt(3).

So total momentum is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Hmm. So the initial momentum is along the positive x-direction.

Now, after annihilation, two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E_photon. Since both have same energy, E_photon = same value.

Let me think about the momentum of each photon. Since photons carry momentum p = E/c, but direction matters. The first photon is moving in the upper-right direction, so its momentum has x and y components. The second is moving in the lower-right direction, which also has x and y components, but the y component is negative.

Let me denote the first photon as photon 1, moving at (theta) above the x-axis, and photon 2 moving at (theta) below the x-axis, but since they're symmetric, perhaps the angle is the same in magnitude but opposite in sign. Wait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So their angles are theta and -theta relative to the x-axis.

Wait, but in reality, the problem says one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So their angles are in the upper right and lower right quadrants. Hmm, but that would imply that both are moving to the right, which would make the total momentum in the x-direction larger, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, wait. The total momentum after annihilation must match the initial momentum. So the sum of the two photons' momenta must equal the initial momentum.

Each photon's momentum is a vector. So photon 1 has components (p_x, p_y) and photon 2 has (p_x', p_y').

But the problem states that both photons have the same energy. So their magnitudes of momentum are same since p = E/c. So |p1| = |p2| =E_photon/c.

But wait, they have same energy, so their momenta have same magnitude. So p1 = E_photon/(c) in direction (theta), p2 = E_photon/(c) in direction (phi), but the problem says one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So perhaps both are moving to the right, but one upward and the other downward, making their momenta vectors in the right and up/down directions.

Wait, but that would mean their x-components would add, and the y-components would cancel each other in a way. Hmm, but that might not be the case. Let me think.

Wait, but let's define the angles. Let me say photon 1 is moving at angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 is moving at angle -theta below the x-axis. So their y-components would be p sin theta and p sin(-theta), which would cancel each other. But their x-components would be p cos theta and p cos(-theta) = p cos theta. So together, the total x-momentum would be 2 p cos theta.

But wait, the initial total momentum was p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So the sum of the x-components of the photons must equal p_initial.

So, 2 p_photon cos theta = p_initial.

But wait, p_photon is E_photon / c. But E_photon is same for both, so p_photon = E_photon /c = same for both.

So, 2 (E_photon/c) cos theta = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But also, the total energy of the system must be conserved. The initial total energy is E_initial = 6 m_e c², as I calculated earlier.

The total energy after annihilation is E_photon * 2, since there are two photons.

So, 2 E_photon = 6 m_e c² → E_photon = 3 m_e c².

So substituting E_photon = 3 m_e c² into the momentum equation:

2 * (3 m_e c² / c ) cos theta = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Simplify:

2 * 3 m_e c cos theta = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

The m_e c terms cancel:

2 * 3 cos theta = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So 6 cos theta = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

Wait, sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 2.14.

So 6 cos theta = 2.14 → cos theta ≈ 2.14 /6 ≈ 0.3567.

So theta = arccos(0.3567) ≈ 69 degrees? Hmm, but wait, let me compute more accurately.

Wait, sqrt(15) is approx 3.87298, sqrt(3) is approx 1.73205.

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 -1.73205 = 2.14093.

Divided by 6: 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.35682.

So cos theta ≈ 0.35682 → theta ≈ arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, but wait. If both photons are moving at angle theta above and below the x-axis, then the angle between them would be 2 theta. Because one is at +theta, the other at -theta. So the angle between them would be 180 - 2 theta? Or 2 theta?

Wait, no. If photon 1 is at angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 is at angle theta below the x-axis, the angle between them would be 2 theta, because the angle from photon 1 to photon 2 is from theta to -theta, which is 2 theta. Wait, but that's assuming they're symmetric. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.

Wait, let me visualize this. Photon 1 is going to the upper right at angle theta, and photon 2 is going to the lower right at angle theta (which would be -theta). So the angle between the two photons would be theta - (-theta) = 2 theta. But wait, that's the case only if they're symmetric. But in this problem, their directions are upper-right and lower-right, which suggests they're both moving to the right, but one upward and the other downward. But I'm not sure if the angle between them is 2 theta. Because if each is at theta from the x-axis, the angle between the two would be 180 - 2 theta perhaps? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of their vector directions.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the angle between the two photons. Let me denote the first photon's direction as making an angle theta with the x-axis, and the second as making an angle phi with the x-axis. But the problem says one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So for example, the first is at theta above x-axis, the second at theta below x-axis. So theta and -theta.

Wait, but the question is, what is the angle between the two photons' directions? So if each is at theta above and below the x-axis, then the angle between them is 2 theta.

Wait, for example, if theta is 30 degrees, then the first is at +30, the second at -30. The angle between them is 60 degrees.

But wait, because the angle between two vectors is the smallest angle between them. So if photon 1 is at +theta, photon 2 at -theta, then the angle between them would be 2 theta.

Alternatively, if they are symmetric above and below, but the angle is measured as the angle from the first to the second, which would be 180 - 2 theta, but that's larger than 180, which can't be the case because the maximum angle between two vectors is 180 degrees.

Wait, no. The angle between two vectors should be the smallest angle between them. So if photon 1 is at theta above x, photon 2 is at theta below x. So from photon 1 to photon 2, the angle would be 180 - 2 theta. Wait, but if the photons are moving in the same general direction, but one is above and the other is below, perhaps the angle between them is 2 theta. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, let me think in terms of the vectors. Photon 1's momentum is (p_x, p_y) = (p cos theta, p sin theta). Photon 2's is (p cos phi, p sin phi).

If phi is - theta, then the vectors are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. The angle between them would be theta + theta = 2 theta. But perhaps the angle between them is 180 - 2 theta? Let me calculate the angle between the two vectors.

The angle between two vectors can be found using the dot product:

cos(angle) = (v1 . v2) / (|v1||v2|).

Since both vectors have magnitude p (same for both), the dot product is (p cos theta)(p cos phi) + (p sin theta)(p sin phi) = p^2 [ cos theta cos phi + sin theta sin phi ].

Which simplifies to p^2 cos(theta - phi), since cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B.

Wait, that's correct. So the angle between the two vectors is (theta - phi). But in our case, if photon 1 is at theta above x, and photon 2 is at -theta below x, then phi = -theta.

So theta_photon1 = theta, theta_photon2 = -theta.

So the angle between them would be theta - (-theta) )= 2 theta.

But wait, wait, the angle between two vectors is the absolute value of the angle between their directions. So the angle between the two photons would be |theta_photon1 - theta_photon2|.

In this case, theta_photon1 is theta, theta_photon2 is -theta. So the angle between them is theta - (-theta) = 2 theta.

But wait, if photon 1 is at theta, and photon 2 is at -theta, then the angle between them is 2 theta. But if theta is 60 degrees, then the angle between them is 120 degrees. But if they're symmetric, like theta=30, angle would be 60 degrees.

So in our case, theta is about 69 degrees, so the angle between the photons would be 2 * 69 = 138 degrees.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The initial momentum was in the positive x direction. So after annihilation, the total momentum must still be in the positive x direction, because photons' momenta add up.

But how does that affect the angles? Let me think.

We have the two photons' momenta p1 and p2. Their sum is p_initial.

p_initial = p1 + p2.

p1 is (p_photon cos theta, p_photon sin theta).

p2 is (p_photon cos (-theta), p_photon sin (-theta)) = (p_photon cos theta, - p_photon sin theta).

So the sum p1 + p2 is (2 p_photon cos theta, 0).

Which is along the x-axis, as expected.

So the initial momentum was along x, and the photons' combined momentum is along x, so that's correct.

But wait, the initial momentum wasn't zero, it was m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, so the sum of the two photons' x-components must equal the initial momentum.

So 2 p_photon cos theta = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But earlier, I found that E_photon = 3 m_e c².

So p_photon = E_photon / c = (3 m_e c²) / c = 3 m_e c.

So substituting:

2 * 3 m_e c * cos theta = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Cancel m_e c from both sides:

6 cos theta = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So cos theta = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6.

Compute that value.

Let me compute sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298

sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 = 2.14093.

Divide by 6: 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.35682.

So cos theta ≈ 0.35682 → theta ≈ arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69 degrees.

So the angle between the two photons is 2 theta, which is about 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138 degrees.

So the answer should be C) 138.

To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation process using conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron collide, annihilate, and produce two photons of equal energy. The photons move in the upper-right and lower-right directions, and we are tasked with finding the angle between their directions.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Initial Energy and Momentum**:
   - The electron has a Lorentz factor $\gamma_e = 4$, and the positron has $\gamma_p = 2$. Both have the same rest mass $m_e$.
   - Total energy before annihilation is:
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = (4 + 2)m_e c^2 = 6m_e c^2.
     \]
   - Total momentum before annihilation is:
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_e m_e v_e - \gamma_p m_e v_p,
     \]
     where $v_e$ and $v_p$ are the velocities of the electron and positron, respectively. Using $\beta = v/c$ and $\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-\beta^2}$:
     \[
     \beta_e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_e^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}, \quad \beta_p = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
     \]
     Substituting:
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_e m_e c \beta_e - \gamma_p m_e c \beta_p = m_e c \sqrt{15} - m_e c \sqrt{3}.
     \]

2. **Photon Properties**:
   - After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energy $E_{\text{photon}}$. Since $E = \text{total energy}/2$, we find:
     \[
     E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = 3m_e c^2.
     \]
   - The momentum of each photon is:
     \[
     p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{3m_e c^2}{c} = 3m_e c.
     \]

3. **Photon Directions and Momentum Conservation**:
   - Let the photons move at angles $\theta$ and $-\theta$ relative to the x-axis. Their momentum components are:
     \[
     p_1 = (p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta, p_{\text{photon}} \sin\theta), \quad p_2 = (p_{\text{photon}} \cos(-\theta), p_{\text{photon}} \sin(-\theta)).
     \]
   - The total momentum after annihilation is:
     \[
     p_{\text{total}} = p_1 + p_2 = (2p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta, 0).
     \]
   - Equating to the initial momentum:
     \[
     2p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
     \]
     Substituting $p_{\text{photon}} = 3m_e c$:
     \[
     2(3m_e c) \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}.
     \]
     Compute $\sqrt{15} \approx 3.873$ and $\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732$:
     \[
     6 \cos\theta = 3.873 - 1.732 = 2.141 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \cos\theta = \frac{2.141}{6} \approx 0.3568.
     \]
     Thus:
     \[
     \theta = \arccos(0.3568) \approx 69^\circ.
     \]

4. **Angle Between Photons**:
   - The angle between the two photons is $2\theta$, as one photon moves at $+\theta$ and the other at $-\theta$ relative to the x-axis. Substituting $\theta \approx 69^\circ$:
     \[
     \text{Angle between photons} = 2\theta \approx 2(69^\circ) = 138^\circ.
     \]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

An electron is moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. A positron is also moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. After colliding, both annihilate and produce two photons. The energies of both photons are the same. One photon is moving in the upper-right direction, and the other in the lower-right direction. I need to find the angle between them.

Hmm. So, first, I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and energy and momentum are conserved. Since the two photons have equal energy, their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction in some way. Wait, no, the question says each photon has the same energy, but their directions are upper-right and lower-right.

Wait, but photons carry momentum, right? The momentum of a photon is p = E/c, and because E is the same for both photons, their magnitudes of momentum are the same. But their directions are symmetric in some way.

Let me think about the setup. Electron is moving left to right (let's say positive x-direction) with gamma =4. Positron is moving right to left (so negative x-direction) with gamma=2.

Wait, wait. No, the positron is moving from the right. So if the electron is coming from the left (so moving to the right), and the positron is coming from the right (so moving to the left). So their velocities are in opposite directions.

Wait, but their gamma factors are given. The electron has gamma=4, positron gamma=2. Gamma is the Lorentz factor, which is 1/sqrt(1-(v^2/c^2)), so it depends on the speed.

The problem says they collide and annihilate into two photons. So the initial total energy and momentum must equal the total energy and momentum of the photons.

But wait, the annihilation of an electron and positron typically produces two photons moving in opposite directions to conserve momentum. But in this case, it's two photons moving in upper and lower right directions. So that's interesting. So maybe they're moving at some angle relative to the original direction.

Let me think about conservation of momentum. The initial momentum of the system is the sum of the momenta of the electron and the positron.

So for the electron, moving to the right (positive x direction). Its momentum is gamma * m_e * v_e. But since gamma is 4, and we can write it as gamma = 4, so the momentum p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. Similarly, the positron is moving to the left, so its velocity is negative in the x direction. So its momentum p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p. But since it's moving to the left, its velocity is negative, so p_p is negative.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute their relativistic momenta in terms of gamma and mass.

Wait, the relativistic momentum for a particle is p = gamma * m * v. Alternatively, since gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and v can be expressed in terms of beta (beta = v/c). So p = gamma m_e beta c.

Alternatively, since for a particle, E^2 = (pc c)^2 + (m c^2)^2. But maybe using energy and momentum conservation is the way to go.

But let's first compute the initial total energy and momentum.

The electron and positron are each other's antiparticles. So their rest mass energies are each m_e c^2.

The electron's energy is E_e = gamma_e * m_e c^2.

Similarly, the positron's energy is E_p = gamma_p * m_e c^2.

So E_e = 4 m_e c², E_p = 2 m_e c².

Total initial energy is E_total = E_e + E_p = (4 + 2) m_e c² = 6 m_e c².

Momentum: the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m_e v_e. The positron is moving opposite, so its momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e v_p (but v_p is opposite, so the sign of p_p is negative? Wait, no, because v_p is in the opposite direction. So if the positron is moving to the left, its velocity is negative, so p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p, which would be negative.

So let's compute the velocities. Well, we can use the relation gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), where beta = v/c.

For the electron, gamma_e =4. So beta_e = sqrt(1 - (1/gamma_e)^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4.

Similarly, positron's gamma_p =2. Beta_p = sqrt(1 - (1/4)) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

So velocity of electron v_e = beta_e c = (sqrt(15)/4) c, in positive x direction.

Velocity of positron v_p = beta_p c in negative x direction, so v_p = - (sqrt(3)/2) c.

Now, their momenta:

p_e = gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e c sqrt(15).

Similarly, p_p = gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 * m_e * (-sqrt(3)/2 c) ) = - m_e c sqrt(3).

So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake here. Because the positron's velocity is to the left, so its momentum should be negative. So the total momentum is p_e (positive) plus p_p (negative).

Wait, let me recompute.

p_e = 4 m_e (sqrt(15)/4 c) = m_e c sqrt(15). Positive.

p_p = 2 m_e * ( - sqrt(3)/2 c ) = - m_e c sqrt(3).

So total momentum is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Hmm. So the initial momentum is along the positive x-direction.

Now, after annihilation, two photons are produced. Each photon has energy E_photon. Since both have same energy, E_photon = same value.

Let me think about the momentum of each photon. Since photons carry momentum p = E/c, but direction matters. The first photon is moving in the upper-right direction, so its momentum has x and y components. The second is moving in the lower-right direction, which also has x and y components, but the y component is negative.

Let me denote the first photon as photon 1, moving at (theta) above the x-axis, and photon 2 moving at (theta) below the x-axis, but since they're symmetric, perhaps the angle is the same in magnitude but opposite in sign. Wait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other lower-right. So their angles are theta and -theta relative to the x-axis.

Wait, but in reality, the problem says one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So their angles are in the upper right and lower right quadrants. Hmm, but that would imply that both are moving to the right, which would make the total momentum in the x-direction larger, but I'm not sure if that's the case.

Wait, wait. The total momentum after annihilation must match the initial momentum. So the sum of the two photons' momenta must equal the initial momentum.

Each photon's momentum is a vector. So photon 1 has components (p_x, p_y) and photon 2 has (p_x', p_y').

But the problem states that both photons have the same energy. So their magnitudes of momentum are same since p = E/c. So |p1| = |p2| =E_photon/c.

But wait, they have same energy, so their momenta have same magnitude. So p1 = E_photon/(c) in direction (theta), p2 = E_photon/(c) in direction (phi), but the problem says one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So perhaps both are moving to the right, but one upward and the other downward, making their momenta vectors in the right and up/down directions.

Wait, but that would mean their x-components would add, and the y-components would cancel each other in a way. Hmm, but that might not be the case. Let me think.

Wait, but let's define the angles. Let me say photon 1 is moving at angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 is moving at angle -theta below the x-axis. So their y-components would be p sin theta and p sin(-theta), which would cancel each other. But their x-components would be p cos theta and p cos(-theta) = p cos theta. So together, the total x-momentum would be 2 p cos theta.

But wait, the initial total momentum was p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So the sum of the x-components of the photons must equal p_initial.

So, 2 p_photon cos theta = p_initial.

But wait, p_photon is E_photon / c. But E_photon is same for both, so p_photon = E_photon /c = same for both.

So, 2 (E_photon/c) cos theta = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But also, the total energy of the system must be conserved. The initial total energy is E_initial = 6 m_e c², as I calculated earlier.

The total energy after annihilation is E_photon * 2, since there are two photons.

So, 2 E_photon = 6 m_e c² → E_photon = 3 m_e c².

So substituting E_photon = 3 m_e c² into the momentum equation:

2 * (3 m_e c² / c ) cos theta = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Simplify:

2 * 3 m_e c cos theta = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

The m_e c terms cancel:

2 * 3 cos theta = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So 6 cos theta = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

Wait, sqrt(15) is about 3.872, sqrt(3) is about 1.732, so sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 2.14.

So 6 cos theta = 2.14 → cos theta ≈ 2.14 /6 ≈ 0.3567.

So theta = arccos(0.3567) ≈ 69 degrees? Hmm, but wait, let me compute more accurately.

Wait, sqrt(15) is approx 3.87298, sqrt(3) is approx 1.73205.

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 -1.73205 = 2.14093.

Divided by 6: 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.35682.

So cos theta ≈ 0.35682 → theta ≈ arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69 degrees.

Wait, but wait. If both photons are moving at angle theta above and below the x-axis, then the angle between them would be 2 theta. Because one is at +theta, the other at -theta. So the angle between them would be 180 - 2 theta? Or 2 theta?

Wait, no. If photon 1 is at angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 is at angle theta below the x-axis, the angle between them would be 2 theta, because the angle from photon 1 to photon 2 is from theta to -theta, which is 2 theta. Wait, but that's assuming they're symmetric. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.

Wait, let me visualize this. Photon 1 is going to the upper right at angle theta, and photon 2 is going to the lower right at angle theta (which would be -theta). So the angle between the two photons would be theta - (-theta) = 2 theta. But wait, that's the case only if they're symmetric. But in this problem, their directions are upper-right and lower-right, which suggests they're both moving to the right, but one upward and the other downward. But I'm not sure if the angle between them is 2 theta. Because if each is at theta from the x-axis, the angle between the two would be 180 - 2 theta perhaps? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of their vector directions.

Wait, perhaps it's better to calculate the angle between the two photons. Let me denote the first photon's direction as making an angle theta with the x-axis, and the second as making an angle phi with the x-axis. But the problem says one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So for example, the first is at theta above x-axis, the second at theta below x-axis. So theta and -theta.

Wait, but the question is, what is the angle between the two photons' directions? So if each is at theta above and below the x-axis, then the angle between them is 2 theta.

Wait, for example, if theta is 30 degrees, then the first is at +30, the second at -30. The angle between them is 60 degrees.

But wait, because the angle between two vectors is the smallest angle between them. So if photon 1 is at +theta, photon 2 at -theta, then the angle between them would be 2 theta.

Alternatively, if they are symmetric above and below, but the angle is measured as the angle from the first to the second, which would be 180 - 2 theta, but that's larger than 180, which can't be the case because the maximum angle between two vectors is 180 degrees.

Wait, no. The angle between two vectors should be the smallest angle between them. So if photon 1 is at theta above x, photon 2 is at theta below x. So from photon 1 to photon 2, the angle would be 180 - 2 theta. Wait, but if the photons are moving in the same general direction, but one is above and the other is below, perhaps the angle between them is 2 theta. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, let me think in terms of the vectors. Photon 1's momentum is (p_x, p_y) = (p cos theta, p sin theta). Photon 2's is (p cos phi, p sin phi).

If phi is - theta, then the vectors are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. The angle between them would be theta + theta = 2 theta. But perhaps the angle between them is 180 - 2 theta? Let me calculate the angle between the two vectors.

The angle between two vectors can be found using the dot product:

cos(angle) = (v1 . v2) / (|v1||v2|).

Since both vectors have magnitude p (same for both), the dot product is (p cos theta)(p cos phi) + (p sin theta)(p sin phi) = p^2 [ cos theta cos phi + sin theta sin phi ].

Which simplifies to p^2 cos(theta - phi), since cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B.

Wait, that's correct. So the angle between the two vectors is (theta - phi). But in our case, if photon 1 is at theta above x, and photon 2 is at -theta below x, then phi = -theta.

So theta_photon1 = theta, theta_photon2 = -theta.

So the angle between them would be theta - (-theta) )= 2 theta.

But wait, wait, the angle between two vectors is the absolute value of the angle between their directions. So the angle between the two photons would be |theta_photon1 - theta_photon2|.

In this case, theta_photon1 is theta, theta_photon2 is -theta. So the angle between them is theta - (-theta) = 2 theta.

But wait, if photon 1 is at theta, and photon 2 is at -theta, then the angle between them is 2 theta. But if theta is 60 degrees, then the angle between them is 120 degrees. But if they're symmetric, like theta=30, angle would be 60 degrees.

So in our case, theta is about 69 degrees, so the angle between the photons would be 2 * 69 = 138 degrees.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The initial momentum was in the positive x direction. So after annihilation, the total momentum must still be in the positive x direction, because photons' momenta add up.

But how does that affect the angles? Let me think.

We have the two photons' momenta p1 and p2. Their sum is p_initial.

p_initial = p1 + p2.

p1 is (p_photon cos theta, p_photon sin theta).

p2 is (p_photon cos (-theta), p_photon sin (-theta)) = (p_photon cos theta, - p_photon sin theta).

So the sum p1 + p2 is (2 p_photon cos theta, 0).

Which is along the x-axis, as expected.

So the initial momentum was along x, and the photons' combined momentum is along x, so that's correct.

But wait, the initial momentum wasn't zero, it was m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, so the sum of the two photons' x-components must equal the initial momentum.

So 2 p_photon cos theta = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But earlier, I found that E_photon = 3 m_e c².

So p_photon = E_photon / c = (3 m_e c²) / c = 3 m_e c.

So substituting:

2 * 3 m_e c * cos theta = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Cancel m_e c from both sides:

6 cos theta = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So cos theta = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] / 6.

Compute that value.

Let me compute sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298

sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205

So sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 = 2.14093.

Divide by 6: 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.35682.

So cos theta ≈ 0.35682 → theta ≈ arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69 degrees.

So the angle between the two photons is 2 theta, which is about 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138 degrees.

So the answer should be C) 138.


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation process using conservation of energy and momentum. The electron and positron collide, annihilate, and produce two photons of equal energy. The photons move in the upper-right and lower-right directions, and we are tasked with finding the angle between their directions.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Initial Energy and Momentum**:
   - The electron has a Lorentz factor $\gamma_e = 4$, and the positron has $\gamma_p = 2$. Both have the same rest mass $m_e$.
   - Total energy before annihilation is:
     \[
     E_{\text{total}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = (4 + 2)m_e c^2 = 6m_e c^2.
     \]
   - Total momentum before annihilation is:
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_e m_e v_e - \gamma_p m_e v_p,
     \]
     where $v_e$ and $v_p$ are the velocities of the electron and positron, respectively. Using $\beta = v/c$ and $\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-\beta^2}$:
     \[
     \beta_e = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_e^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4}, \quad \beta_p = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
     \]
     Substituting:
     \[
     p_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_e m_e c \beta_e - \gamma_p m_e c \beta_p = m_e c \sqrt{15} - m_e c \sqrt{3}.
     \]

2. **Photon Properties**:
   - After annihilation, two photons are produced with equal energy $E_{\text{photon}}$. Since $E = \text{total energy}/2$, we find:
     \[
     E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{2} = 3m_e c^2.
     \]
   - The momentum of each photon is:
     \[
     p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = \frac{3m_e c^2}{c} = 3m_e c.
     \]

3. **Photon Directions and Momentum Conservation**:
   - Let the photons move at angles $\theta$ and $-\theta$ relative to the x-axis. Their momentum components are:
     \[
     p_1 = (p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta, p_{\text{photon}} \sin\theta), \quad p_2 = (p_{\text{photon}} \cos(-\theta), p_{\text{photon}} \sin(-\theta)).
     \]
   - The total momentum after annihilation is:
     \[
     p_{\text{total}} = p_1 + p_2 = (2p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta, 0).
     \]
   - Equating to the initial momentum:
     \[
     2p_{\text{photon}} \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
     \]
     Substituting $p_{\text{photon}} = 3m_e c$:
     \[
     2(3m_e c) \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
     \]
     Simplify:
     \[
     6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}.
     \]
     Compute $\sqrt{15} \approx 3.873$ and $\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732$:
     \[
     6 \cos\theta = 3.873 - 1.732 = 2.141 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \cos\theta = \frac{2.141}{6} \approx 0.3568.
     \]
     Thus:
     \[
     \theta = \arccos(0.3568) \approx 69^\circ.
     \]

4. **Angle Between Photons**:
   - The angle between the two photons is $2\theta$, as one photon moves at $+\theta$ and the other at $-\theta$ relative to the x-axis. Substituting $\theta \approx 69^\circ$:
     \[
     \text{Angle between photons} = 2\theta \approx 2(69^\circ) = 138^\circ.
     \]

### Final Answer:
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
