Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? So they have chiral centers. I remember that chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which show optical isomerism. Let's go one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyls can have different conformations, but for isomerism, especially optical, I think about whether there are any stereogenic centers. Biphenyls themselves usually don't have chiral centers, but wait, the substituents might create some. Let me see: each phenyl has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So on the central carbon (the one connecting the two phenyls), maybe? Wait, no, the structure is 1,1'-biphenyl, so the central carbon is connected to two phenyl rings. Each phenyl has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. Wait, does the central carbon have four different groups attached? The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and two other substituents (like OMe groups from the esters)? Or maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Oh wait, if the substituents are in certain positions, they might be symmetric. Let me think: if both phenyl rings have the same substituents in symmetrical positions, like 6 and 2 on each, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. So, if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule planar, then it wouldn't have a chiral center. But wait, if the two substituents (like the nitro groups) are in positions that aren't mirror images, could that lead to a chiral center?

Wait, considering the biphenyl structure. The two phenyls are connected at the 1 position. Each has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. For each phenyl, 2 and 6 are symmetric positions because the phenyl is a benzene ring. So each substituent on the two rings is symmetrical. So the central carbon is attached to two identical phenyl groups with the same substituents. Wait, so the substituents on each phenyl are in 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So, each phenyl has two substituents at opposite ends.

Wait, but from the central carbon, each phenyl is attached, and each has substituents at 2 and 6. So each substituent on the two phenyls is the same. So the groups attached to the central carbon would be the same on both sides. So maybe the central carbon doesn't have four different groups. For optical isomerism, you need a chiral center. If the central carbon isn't chiral, then no optical isomerism. So maybe compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each phenyl are arranged in such a way that the entire molecule isn't symmetrical. Let me imagine the structure: each phenyl has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, looking at the central carbon, each phenyl is connected, and each has two substituents. But the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups (which are the same), and perhaps two other groups, like the OMe from the ester. Wait, no, the structure is dimethyl ester, so two methyl ester groups. So the central carbon is connected to two phenyls, two OMe groups? That can't be because the central carbon is part of the biphenyl. Wait, perhaps each phenyl has a substituent at 2 and 6, but the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups and two other substituents. Maybe the substituents are such that the four groups are all different. So for the central carbon, groups are: phenyl (with substituents), phenyl (same?), methyl ester, methyl ester. Wait, no, the dimethyl ester would be on each phenyl, not on the central carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each phenyl are at positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other, making each phenyl symmetric. So the two phenyls are identical in their substituents. Therefore, the central carbon is attached to two identical phenyl groups, making the groups on either side the same. So central carbon has two identical phenyl groups, two methyl ester groups? Or maybe each phenyl has its own substituents, but the central carbon isn't a chiral center. So I'm not sure, but maybe this compound doesn't have optical isomerism. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, so no chiral center. So, I'll tentatively say compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see. The structure is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. So the structure is OMe group, then the ester oxygen connected to a CH2 group. Wait, no, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? Let me correct: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH3CH2COO-OCH3. But 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So the structure is OMe connected to COO-, which is connected to CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2COOH. So the ester would be HOCH2COO-OCH3. So the structure is OMe-O-CO-CH2-OH, with a CH3 group? Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. For 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is HOCH2COO-OCH3. So the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH
|
CH3?

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the structure is: the ester is methyl ester, so OMe is attached to the carbonyl. The carbonyl is connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to an OH and another CH3. So the structure is OMe-O-CO-CH2-OH-CH3. Wait, that can't be because that would be four substituents on the CH2. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OMe-O-CO-CH(OH)CH3. No, because 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. So the ester would be CH3-CH(OH)-COO-OCH3. So the structure is:

COO-OCH3
|
CH(OH)
|
CH3

So the central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- COO-OCH3 (carbonyl group from ester),
- OH,
- CH3,
- and the other CH group (the other side of CH(OH)).

Wait, but wait: structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO-OCH3. Wait, no, that would be 1-hydroxypropanoate. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's HOCH2COO-OCH2CH3, but that's different. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is HOCH2COO-OCH3. So the ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which would be:

The propanoate part is CH2(OH)COO-OCH3. So the carbonyl is connected to a CH2OH and a OCH3. So the carbon next to the carbonyl is CH2OH, which is attached to the carbonyl, a hydrogen, and two other groups? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-OCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2OH
|
CH2-

Wait, no, the structure is:

The ester is OCH3 attached to the carbonyl. The carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to an OH and another CH2 group. So the carbon connected to the carbonyl is CH2OH, but wait, it can't be because the formula is CH2(OH)CH2COO-OCH3. So the structure has three carbons: the carbonyl is the third carbon, then the second is CH2OH, and the first is CH2. So the second carbon (next to carbonyl) is CH2OH. So the groups attached to the second carbon are: COO-OCH3, OH, two CH2 groups? Wait, no, the second carbon is CH2OH, so it's connected to:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- two CH2 groups? Or perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, the second carbon is connected to the carbonyl group (COO-OCH3), an OH, a CH2 group, and another CH2 group. No, wait, that can't be. Each carbon can only have four bonds. So for the second carbon (the one with the OH), the four substituents are: the carbonyl oxygen (from COO-OCH3), an OH group, a CH2 group (from the chain), and another CH3 perhaps? No, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the actual structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the possibility of a chiral center. So if the structure has a carbon with four different groups, then it can have optical isomerism. So in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the carbon that's adjacent to the carbonyl (the alpha carbon) would be the one with the OH. Let's say the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH
|
CH2-

Wait, no, that's not possible because the chain would be longer. Alternatively, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH3

So the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl is a CH(OH)CH3. That carbon would be connected to:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- CH3,
- and another CH2 perhaps? Wait, no. Let me try to imagine: the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COO-OCH3. So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COO-OCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COO-OCH3,
- and the adjacent CH group (the one from CH(OH)).

Wait, that can't be right because the adjacent group would be another CH3. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The carbonyl group is at the end, so the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH
|
CH3

So the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the alpha carbon) is CH2OH. But then it's connected to:

- COO-OCH3,
- two H's,
- and a CH3.

Wait, no, that's not four different groups. If the alpha carbon is CH2OH, then it's connected to COO-OCH3, two Hs, and a CH3. So that's not four different groups. Therefore, no chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the OH is on the same carbon as CH3 and another group. Let me think again. The correct structure is important here.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOOC-CH2-OH? No, that can't be right. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So 2-hydroxypropanoate is HO-CH2-COO-OCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH

So the alpha carbon (next to carbonyl) is CH2-OH. So the substituents are:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- two CH2's (wait, no). No, the alpha carbon is CH2-OH, which is connected to the carbonyl, two H's, and a CH2 group? Hmm, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to CH2OH. So the CH2OH is connected to the COO-OCH3. But then the CH2OH is attached to, perhaps, another CH3? No, maybe the structure is:

The structure is:
COO-OCH3 is connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to an OH and another CH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH
|
CH3

Wait, no, that can't be because the chain would be longer. Alternatively, maybe the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to CH(OH)CH3. So the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl is CH(OH)CH3. So the groups attached to that carbon are:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- CH3,
- and another CH3? No, because CH(OH)CH3 implies the carbon is connected to OH, two CH3 groups, and the COO group. Wait, but that would be three CH3 groups and an OH. So that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's connected to COO-OCH3, OH, CH3, and another CH2. No, I think I'm getting stuck, but perhaps the correct way is that the carbon has four different groups. So, if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COO-OCH3, then the central carbon is CH(OH) connected to:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- CH3,
- and another CH3? No, that wouldn't work. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO-OCH3. So the alpha carbon is CH2OH. Then, the groups attached are:

- COO-OCH3,
- two H's,
- and a CH2 group (from CH2OH).

Wait, that's only three substituents. So that can't be a chiral center. Hmm, I'm not confident about this. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center because the alpha carbon is attached to four different groups. Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to a CH(OH)CH3 group. So the alpha carbon is CH(OH)CH3. Therefore, the four groups attached are:

- O=C-OCH3,
- OH,
- CH3,
- and another CH3 (no, wait, because the CH(OH)CH3 would have three substituents: the COO group, OH, and two CH3 groups, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's connected to the COO group, OH, a CH3, and a CH2. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center because the alpha carbon is attached to two identical groups. Alternatively, perhaps it does have a chiral center, making it exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, maybe I should think about the molecular structure more clearly. Let me draw it out mentally. The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COO-OCH3. So the carbonyl is at the end, and the chain is CH2-CH(OH)-COO-OCH3. So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- a CH3 group (from CH2),
- an OH,
- the carbonyl group (COO-OCH3),
- and another CH2 group attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to OH and another CH3. So the structure is O=C-OCH3-CH2-OH-CH3. No, that can't be because that would be a four-carbon chain. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to conclude that compound 2 has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism. Alternatively, maybe it's not a chiral center because of symmetry. I think I made a mistake earlier, and compound 2 does have a chiral center. For example, if the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to a CH(OH)CH3 group, then the central carbon is attached to four different groups: O=C-OCH3, OH, CH3, and another CH3? No, that can't be because it's attached to two CH3 groups. So that's not four different groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's connected to COO-OCH3, OH, CH3, and CH2. No, that doesn't seem right. I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should move on and come back.

3. Benzophenone. Structure is (Ph)2CO. So two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two phenyl groups and another R group? Wait, no. Benzophenone is diphenyl ketone: Ph-CO-Ph. The central carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O and attached to two phenyl groups. So the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The carbonyl carbon has double bond to O and two phenyl groups. So it's not a chiral center because it's double-bonded, and the carbon is trigonal, not tetrahedral. Also, adjacent carbons don't have four different groups. So benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the diester of maleic acid. Structure: the central double bond is between two carbons, each substituted with an ester group. The structure is CH2=CH(COO-OCH3)2. Wait, no, more accurately, it's O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
C=C
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that can't be. Fumarate is a diester of maleic acid. So the structure is (Z) and (E) isomer. Wait, no, fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is:

O           O
||         ||
O-C-OCH3   O-C-OCH3
   \          /
     C=C

Wait, but that's the trans configuration. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides. Now, does dimethyl fumarate have any stereoisomerism? Well, fumarate itself is a trans-dioic acid. When esterified, the substituents are on opposite sides. But wait, in the ester, are there any stereogenic centers? No, because each ester group is attached to a carbon that's part of a double bond. Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is CH2=C(COO-OCH3)2. Each of the two carbons in the double bond has two ester groups and two CH3 groups? No, wait, each has an ester group and a methyl group? Let me think again. The structure of fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. No, wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CHCH-COOH, where the double bond is between the two CH groups. So fumarate is the trans isomer: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is (Z)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, and fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when you make dimethyl fumarate, it's (E)-CH2(COO-OCH3)CH(COO-OCH3)CH2. Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to say that each of the two carbons in the double bond has an ester group. So the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each of the two carbons in the double bond. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
C=C
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

So each of the two carbons in the double bond has two ester groups (O-C-OCH3) attached. Wait, that can't be because each carbon can only have two substituents besides the double bond. So each carbon in the double bond has one ester group and one CH3? No, wait, each would have two ester groups. So the structure would have two ester groups on each carbon of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me think again. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H. No, that's not right. Wait, no, butenedioic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So fumarate is the trans isomer, while maleate is the cis. So when esterified, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid. So each carboxylic acid group becomes a methyl ester. So the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, but that's not possible because each CH in the double bond would have two COOCH3 groups. So each of the two carbons in the double bond has two ester groups attached. So each has COOCH3 on both sides of the double bond. Wait, that can't be because each carbon can only have two substituents (the double bond and two COOCH3 groups). So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
C=C
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

In this case, each of the two carbons in the double bond has two identical groups (the ester groups). So each carbon has two OCOOCH3 groups. But wait, if the substituents on each side are the same, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral. So, does this compound have any stereoisomerism? Well, the molecule has a central double bond with substituents on either side. If the substituents are the same on each side, then it's symmetrical and can't have stereoisomers. But wait, in this case, the substituents are the same on both sides (each has two ester groups). So it's symmetrical, so no stereoisomerism. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are different. Wait, no, both substituents on each carbon are ester groups, which are the same. So, the molecule is symmetrical and thus doesn't have any optical isomerism. Wait, but I thought fumarate can have cis and trans isomers. Oh wait, wait. Wait, no, dimethyl fumarate is derived from fumaric acid, which is the trans isomer. But in the ester, the substituents are attached such that the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making the molecule have a plane of symmetry. So, the molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, I recall that dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Wait, no, wait. Wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans. So their diesters would have the same structure as the acid, just with ester groups instead of COOH. So, dimethyl maleate would have the two ester groups on the same side of the double bond, while dimethyl fumarate would have them on opposite sides. So, in that case, the molecule would have two stereoisomers: the cis (maleate) and trans (fumarate). But wait, the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chirality. So, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. So for a molecule to have optical isomers, it must be chiral, meaning it doesn't have a plane of symmetry and has a chiral center or a chiral axis. So, dimethyl fumarate, since it's the trans diastereomer, is symmetrical, right? Because each substituent on either side of the double bond is the same. So, if I imagine looking at the molecule, it's symmetrical along the plane bisecting the double bond. So, the molecule isn't chiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, that can't be right because I thought that fumarate is a trans isomer and is a meso compound. Oh wait, meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters. For example, meso-tartaric acid is achiral but has stereocenters. So, if dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, then it doesn't have optical isomerism. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Another approach: consider whether the molecule has a central plane of symmetry. If the two substituents on each side of the double bond are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical. So in dimethyl fumarate, each carbon in the double bond has two ester groups. So the molecule would be symmetrical, making it achiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier. Alternatively, perhaps I got the structure wrong. Wait, maybe the structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond, but in a trans configuration. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides. But if each carbon in the double bond has two ester groups, then the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism. Hmm, but I remember that maleic anhydride is a planar molecule (due to the double bond), but when it's esterified, does it have any chiral centers? No, because each ester group is attached to a carbon in the double bond, which is sp² hybridized and thus not a chiral center. So, in that case, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and isn't chiral, so no optical isomerism. Wait, but that can't be right. Because if the substituents are on opposite sides, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical. Wait, let me think again. If the two substituents on each carbon are the same (both ester groups), then the molecule is symmetrical. So the two ends are mirror images, making the molecule achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about another approach. The question is which of these compounds show optical isomerism. So, which have chiral centers or other forms of chirality.

Going back to the four compounds:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. If the central carbon has four different groups, it's chiral. Earlier, I thought it might not, but perhaps it does. Let me imagine: each phenyl has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, each phenyl is symmetric in a way, but perhaps the arrangement makes the substituents on the central carbon different. For example, if the substituents are arranged such that each phenyl has a nitro and a carboxylate, but the positions relative to the central carbon are different, leading to four different groups attached to the central carbon. So, perhaps the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups (each with nitro and carboxylate in certain positions), but if their substituents are arranged in a way that makes the groups on either side different, then the central carbon would have four different substituents. For example, one phenyl might have nitro in a position that's mirror image of the other. Thus, the central carbon would have four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. If the alpha carbon has four different groups, it would be chiral. Earlier confusion about the structure aside, I think this molecule does have a chiral center. For example, if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COO-OCH3, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- CH3,
- and another group. Wait, if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COO-OCH3, then the carbon next to the OH is connected to:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- CH3,
- and another CH2 group? Or perhaps the structure is such that the alpha carbon is CH(OH) with four different groups. I think I'm getting stuck again, but perhaps I'll assume that it does have a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. No chiral centers. No optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. As discussed, it's a symmetrical molecule, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts about compound 1. Let me try to visualize it again. The structure is a biphenyl system (two phenyl rings connected at position 1). Each phenyl has nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. So, the substituents on each phenyl are at positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So on each phenyl, the substituents are opposite each other. Now, the central carbon (the one connecting the two phenyl rings) would have two phenyl groups attached. But each phenyl has a nitro and a carboxylate. Wait, but if the substituents are in para positions, then each phenyl is symmetric, meaning that the two phenyl groups attached to the central carbon are identical. So, the central carbon is attached to two identical phenyl groups, making its substituents not all different. So, the central carbon isn't a chiral center. Therefore, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, so going back:

Which compounds have optical isomerism?

Looking at each again:

1. No.

2. Let's think again. If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COO-OCH3, then the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- CH3,
- and another CH2 group? No, because that would require four bonds. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH2-

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO-OCH3. So the alpha carbon is CH2OH. Then, the groups attached are:

- COO-OCH3,
- two H's,
- and a CH2 group leading to another CH3. No, that's not four different groups. So, no chiral center.

Wait, maybe the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to a CH(OH)CH3 group. So the CH(OH)CH3 is connected to COO-OCH3. So the substituents on the CH(OH)CH3 are:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- CH3,
- and another CH3. So that's three substituents, but wait, that would imply the carbon is connected to four groups, but two are CH3. So, groups are COO-OCH3, OH, CH3, and CH3. So, two CH3 groups, same, so not four different. So no chiral center. That would mean compound 2 doesn't have optical isomerism either. But that contradicts my earlier thought.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier, and in reality, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center. So, which compounds do have optical isomerism?

Looking again, the options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4: I think 1 and 2 don't, 4 doesn't.

B) 3 and 4: 3 no, 4 no.

C) 2 and 3: 2 maybe, 3 no.

D) 1 and 2: probably no.

Wait, but according to my earlier confusion, perhaps I'm wrong. So let's see:

Which of the four have a chiral center or are capable of optical isomerism?

1. No chiral center, so no.

2. I'm really unsure, but perhaps it does have a chiral center.

3. No.

4. No.

So, only compound 2 would have optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of the options have only 2. Let's look at the options again.

Options:

A) 1, 2, 4

B) 3,4

C) 2,3

D) 1,2

Wait, the correct answer isn't among the options with just 2, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about which compounds have a chiral center.

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The structure is HOCH2COO-OCH3. So the alpha carbon (the one next to the carbonyl) is CH2OH. So, the substituents are:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- two H's.

So, not four different groups. No chiral center.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the structure is HOCH2COO-OCH3, where the alpha carbon is CH2OH. That would be:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- two H's.

No, same as before.

Wait, but perhaps the structure is different. I'm getting stuck on this, but perhaps I should reconsider. Suppose the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COO-OCH3. Then the central carbon (the one with OH) is CH(OH). The substituents are:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- CH3,
- and another CH2 group? No, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon is CH(OH) connected to COO-OCH3, CH3, and another CH2 group. Wait, but that's four groups, making it a chiral center. So if the substituents are:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- CH3,
- and another CH2 group (from the chain), which is also a CH3.

Wait, no, the chain would have to be longer. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon is connected to four different groups, making it chiral.

Another approach: perhaps 2-hydroxypropanoate is the same as lactic acid's ester. Lactic acid has a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center, making it exhibit optical isomerism.

Ah! So if 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of lactic acid, then the ester would have a chiral center. So in that case, compound 2 would exhibit optical isomerism.

In that case, which compounds have optical isomerism?

- Only compound 2.

But looking at the options, none have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the options:

A) 1, 2, 4 → 3 compounds.

B) 3,4 → no.

C) 2,3 → 2 and 3.

D) 1,2 → 1 and 2.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps compound 4 does have optical isomerism. Let me re-examine it.

Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, which is the trans isomer. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
C=C
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But in this case, each substituent on the double bond is an ester group. So, each carbon in the double bond is attached to two ester groups. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure isn't symmetrical because the substituents are in a certain configuration. Wait, but if each carbon in the double bond has two identical groups, the molecule is symmetrical. So, I think dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2. But looking at the options, none have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier analysis.

Wait, perhaps compound 4 is a diastereomer, but not a chiral compound. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that compound 4 has a trans configuration which allows for a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, back to the options.

Option A: 1,2,4 → but I think 1 and 4 don't have optical isomerism, so 2 is the only one.

But none of the options have only 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1. Let me re-examine it.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The biphenyl structure is such that each phenyl has nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. So, each phenyl has substituents in positions that are opposite each other on the ring.

The central carbon (the one connecting the two phenyl rings) is connected to two phenyl groups, each with their own substituents. But are the substituents arranged in a way that the groups attached to the central carbon are all different?

Wait, each phenyl group has a nitro and a carboxylate. Are these substituents in positions that make each phenyl group identical on either side of the central carbon? Or is there a possibility that the substituents are arranged such that each phenyl group is chiral?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule as a whole lacks symmetry, making the central carbon a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps each phenyl group has a nitro and a carboxylate, but their positions relative to the central carbon are such that the substituents are not identical on both sides. For example, the nitro could be on one side of the phenyl and the carboxylate on the other, making the groups attached to the central carbon different. So, the substituents on the central carbon would be:

- Phenyl group A (with nitro and carboxylate in specific positions),
- Phenyl group B (same as A),
- Two ester groups (OCH3).

Wait, but if the substituents on each phenyl are in positions that make the two phenyl groups identical, then the central carbon would have two identical phenyl groups and two ester groups (which are identical as well), making it not a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

But perhaps the substituents on the phenyls are arranged in a way that makes the two phenyl groups different when attached to the central carbon. For example, if the nitro is on one side and the carboxylate on the other, leading to each phenyl being a mirror image of the other. So, the central carbon would have four different groups: two phenyl groups (each with different substituent arrangements) and two ester groups. Hmm, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, making it not chiral.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to summarize:

- Compound 1: No optical isomerism.

- Compound 2: Yes.

- Compound 3: No.

- Compound 4: No.

So, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't include an option where only 2 is correct. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I missed that compound 4 can have geometric isomerism, but that's not optical isomerism. Geometric isomerism is about cis and trans, which is different from optical isomerism (chirality). So, compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps compound 1 does have a chiral center. Let me imagine that the substituents on each phenyl are arranged in such a way that the central carbon is connected to four different groups. For example, each phenyl has a nitro and a carboxylate, but their positions relative to the central carbon are such that each phenyl is different. So, the central carbon is connected to:

- Phenyl A (with nitro at a certain position and carboxylate at another),
- Phenyl B (mirror image of A),
- two ester groups.

Wait, but if Phenyl B is a mirror image of Phenyl A, then the central carbon would have two identical phenyl groups, making it not chiral.

I think I'm going in circles. Perhaps I should conclude based on the options given.

The correct answer, I think, is that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing compound 4.

Wait, another angle: dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. But are they optical isomers? No, because diastereomers aren't mirror images. Optical isomers are enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. So dimethyl fumarate itself doesn't have optical isomerism because it's a symmetrical compound. So, only compound 2 is correct.

But the options don't include an option where only 2 is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes compounds 1, 2, and 4. But I thought 1 and 4 don't have optical isomerism. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 1. Let me think again. If the substituents on each phenyl are in positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other, then each phenyl is symmetric. Therefore, the central carbon is connected to two identical phenyl groups and two ester groups (which are identical). So, the central carbon has two identical phenyl groups and two identical ester groups, making it not a chiral center. So, compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, the only correct compound is 2, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that compound 4 has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, the only correct answer is compound 2. But again, the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 2. Let me imagine that the structure is such that the alpha carbon is a chiral center. For example, if the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COO-OCH3. Then, the carbon in the middle (the one with OH and H) would be a chiral center. So, if the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COO-OCH3, the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- H,
- COO-OCH3.

That's four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, compound 2 would exhibit optical isomerism.

In that case, the correct answer would be that only compound 2 does. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps compound 4 has a chiral center. Let me think. If the structure of dimethyl fumarate has a stereogenic center. No, because the double bond is in the middle, and each carbon in the double bond is attached to two ester groups, which are the same. So, no chiral centers.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Based on the analysis, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2. But the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for other possibilities. Let me quickly think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 1,2,4 → 3 compounds.

B) 3,4 → 2.

C) 2,3 → 2.

D)1,2 → 2.

From earlier analysis, I think only 2 is correct. But perhaps the correct answer is option A, meaning compounds 1, 2, and 4 exhibit optical isomerism. But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) does have a chiral center. No, because the carbons in the double bond are sp² hybridized and not chiral centers. So, no.

Another approach: perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm wrong about compound 1 and 4.

Wait, perhaps in dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetric, making the central carbon a chiral center. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side of their respective phenyl rings, leading the central carbon to have four different substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro groups are meta to each other on their respective phenyl rings, leading to a chiral center. So, in that case, compound 1 would have a chiral center and exhibit optical isomerism.

But without a clear structure, it's hard to say. Given the time I've spent, I'll make a decision based on the earlier analysis that only compound 2 has optical isomerism, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps compound 4 does have optical isomerism. Let me think again. If the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that the substituents are on opposite sides, but each carbon in the double bond has two different substituents, making them chiral centers. But no, because each substituent is an ester group, which is the same as the other substituent on the same carbon. So, the substituents are same, so no chiral center.

Hmm. I think I'll have to go with my initial analysis. The correct answer is that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A, which includes compounds 1, 2, and 4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and compound 1 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 1. Let me recheck:

If the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged in a way that each phenyl is not identical when attached to the central carbon, then the central carbon would have four different groups, making it chiral.

For example, if the nitro group on one phenyl is in a position that makes it different from the nitro group on the other phenyl, leading the central carbon to have four different substituents.

So, if one phenyl has nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2, and the other phenyl has nitro at 3 and carboxylate at 5 (as a possibility), but that's not the case. Wait, the question says 6,6' and 2,2'. So each phenyl has nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. So the substituents are in the same positions on both phenyls, making the molecule symmetric. So the central carbon is connected to two identical phenyl groups and two identical ester groups, making it not a chiral center.

Therefore, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Given all this, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2. But the options don't include this, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct answer elsewhere. Another way to approach is to look for which of these compounds have chiral centers.

Compound 1: No.

Compound 2: Yes.

Compound 3: No.

Compound 4: No.

So the answer should be only compound 2. But the options don't have that, so perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1,2,4. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4. Let me think again. Maybe dimethyl fumarate is a cis diastereomer, but it's not chiral. So, no.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps compound 4 is a meso compound, which is achiral but has stereocenters. For example, if the molecule has stereocenters but is achiral due to a plane of symmetry. So, dimethyl fumarate could be a meso compound, hence no optical isomerism.

So, after all that, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A, including compounds 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident, and I think I'm running out of time. Based on the analysis, I'll conclude that the correct answer is option A.

To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of a chiral center or other forms of chirality. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has non-superimposable mirror images, typically due to a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   The structure consists of two phenyl rings connected at the 1-position, with nitro groups at the 6-position and carboxylate groups at the 2-position on each phenyl ring. Each phenyl ring has identical substituents (nitro and carboxylate) in symmetrical positions (para to each other). The central carbon, which connects the two phenyl rings, is attached to two identical phenyl groups and two identical ester groups. Since all four substituents are not different, the central carbon is not a chiral center. Therefore, this compound does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COO-OCH₃. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the alpha carbon) is bonded to four different groups:  
   - A hydroxyl group (OH),  
   - A methyl group (CH₃),  
   - An ester group (COO-OCH₃),  
   - And a hydrogen atom (H).  
   Since this carbon is a chiral center, the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   The structure is (Ph)₂C=O, where Ph represents a phenyl group. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two identical phenyl groups. This carbon is trigonal planar and not a chiral center. Therefore, benzophenone does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   The structure is CH₂=C(COOCH₃)₂, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond (trans configuration). Each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two identical ester groups, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the double bond. Since the molecule is achiral, it does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2)** exhibits optical isomerism. However, none of the provided options include only compound 2. Given the structure of the question and the options provided, the most reasonable answer is **option A (1, 2, and 4)**, assuming a potential error in the analysis of compound 1 or 4.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism in organic compounds. Hmm, optical isomerism is when compounds are non-superimposable mirror images of each other, right? So they have chiral centers. I remember that chiral centers are carbons attached to four different groups.

The question lists four compounds, and I need to determine which show optical isomerism. Let's go one by one.

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. Biphenyls can have different conformations, but for isomerism, especially optical, I think about whether there are any stereogenic centers. Biphenyls themselves usually don't have chiral centers, but wait, the substituents might create some. Let me see: each phenyl has a nitro group at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So on the central carbon (the one connecting the two phenyls), maybe? Wait, no, the structure is 1,1'-biphenyl, so the central carbon is connected to two phenyl rings. Each phenyl has substituents at 2 and 6 positions. Wait, does the central carbon have four different groups attached? The central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and two other substituents (like OMe groups from the esters)? Or maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the substituents are such that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Oh wait, if the substituents are in certain positions, they might be symmetric. Let me think: if both phenyl rings have the same substituents in symmetrical positions, like 6 and 2 on each, maybe the molecule is symmetrical. So, if the substituents are in positions that make the molecule planar, then it wouldn't have a chiral center. But wait, if the two substituents (like the nitro groups) are in positions that aren't mirror images, could that lead to a chiral center?

Wait, considering the biphenyl structure. The two phenyls are connected at the 1 position. Each has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. For each phenyl, 2 and 6 are symmetric positions because the phenyl is a benzene ring. So each substituent on the two rings is symmetrical. So the central carbon is attached to two identical phenyl groups with the same substituents. Wait, so the substituents on each phenyl are in 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So, each phenyl has two substituents at opposite ends.

Wait, but from the central carbon, each phenyl is attached, and each has substituents at 2 and 6. So each substituent on the two phenyls is the same. So the groups attached to the central carbon would be the same on both sides. So maybe the central carbon doesn't have four different groups. For optical isomerism, you need a chiral center. If the central carbon isn't chiral, then no optical isomerism. So maybe compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused here. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each phenyl are arranged in such a way that the entire molecule isn't symmetrical. Let me imagine the structure: each phenyl has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, looking at the central carbon, each phenyl is connected, and each has two substituents. But the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups (which are the same), and perhaps two other groups, like the OMe from the ester. Wait, no, the structure is dimethyl ester, so two methyl ester groups. So the central carbon is connected to two phenyls, two OMe groups? That can't be because the central carbon is part of the biphenyl. Wait, perhaps each phenyl has a substituent at 2 and 6, but the central carbon is attached to two phenyl groups and two other substituents. Maybe the substituents are such that the four groups are all different. So for the central carbon, groups are: phenyl (with substituents), phenyl (same?), methyl ester, methyl ester. Wait, no, the dimethyl ester would be on each phenyl, not on the central carbon. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each phenyl are at positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other, making each phenyl symmetric. So the two phenyls are identical in their substituents. Therefore, the central carbon is attached to two identical phenyl groups, making the groups on either side the same. So central carbon has two identical phenyl groups, two methyl ester groups? Or maybe each phenyl has its own substituents, but the central carbon isn't a chiral center. So I'm not sure, but maybe this compound doesn't have optical isomerism. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical, so no chiral center. So, I'll tentatively say compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Let's see. The structure is CH3-O-CO-CH(OH)-CH3? Wait, wait, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol. So the structure is OMe group, then the ester oxygen connected to a CH2 group. Wait, no, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, no, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-? Let me correct: propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH3CH2COO-OCH3. But 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid, which is CH2(OH)CH2COO-. So the structure is OMe connected to COO-, which is connected to CH2CH(OH)CH3? Wait, no. Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is HOCH2COOH. So the ester would be HOCH2COO-OCH3. So the structure is OMe-O-CO-CH2-OH, with a CH3 group? Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me think: propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. For 2-hydroxypropanoate, the structure is HOCH2COO-OCH3. So the molecule is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH
|
CH3?

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, the structure is: the ester is methyl ester, so OMe is attached to the carbonyl. The carbonyl is connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to an OH and another CH3. So the structure is OMe-O-CO-CH2-OH-CH3. Wait, that can't be because that would be four substituents on the CH2. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is OMe-O-CO-CH(OH)CH3. No, because 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH3-C(OH)H-COOH. So the ester would be CH3-CH(OH)-COO-OCH3. So the structure is:

COO-OCH3
|
CH(OH)
|
CH3

So the central carbon (the one with the OH) is attached to:

- COO-OCH3 (carbonyl group from ester),
- OH,
- CH3,
- and the other CH group (the other side of CH(OH)).

Wait, but wait: structure of 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO-, but 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO-OCH3. Wait, no, that would be 1-hydroxypropanoate. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's HOCH2COO-OCH2CH3, but that's different. Wait, perhaps the correct structure is HOCH2COO-OCH3. So the ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, which would be:

The propanoate part is CH2(OH)COO-OCH3. So the carbonyl is connected to a CH2OH and a OCH3. So the carbon next to the carbonyl is CH2OH, which is attached to the carbonyl, a hydrogen, and two other groups? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The compound is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoic acid is CH3CH2COOH. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. So the ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-OCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2OH
|
CH2-

Wait, no, the structure is:

The ester is OCH3 attached to the carbonyl. The carbonyl is attached to a CH2 group, which is attached to an OH and another CH2 group. So the carbon connected to the carbonyl is CH2OH, but wait, it can't be because the formula is CH2(OH)CH2COO-OCH3. So the structure has three carbons: the carbonyl is the third carbon, then the second is CH2OH, and the first is CH2. So the second carbon (next to carbonyl) is CH2OH. So the groups attached to the second carbon are: COO-OCH3, OH, two CH2 groups? Wait, no, the second carbon is CH2OH, so it's connected to:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- two CH2 groups? Or perhaps I'm getting it wrong. Alternatively, the second carbon is connected to the carbonyl group (COO-OCH3), an OH, a CH2 group, and another CH2 group. No, wait, that can't be. Each carbon can only have four bonds. So for the second carbon (the one with the OH), the four substituents are: the carbonyl oxygen (from COO-OCH3), an OH group, a CH2 group (from the chain), and another CH3 perhaps? No, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to think in terms of the actual structure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think about the possibility of a chiral center. So if the structure has a carbon with four different groups, then it can have optical isomerism. So in methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, the carbon that's adjacent to the carbonyl (the alpha carbon) would be the one with the OH. Let's say the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH
|
CH2-

Wait, no, that's not possible because the chain would be longer. Alternatively, the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH3

So the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl is a CH(OH)CH3. That carbon would be connected to:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- CH3,
- and another CH2 perhaps? Wait, no. Let me try to imagine: the molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COO-OCH3. So the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COO-OCH3.

So the central carbon (the one with the OH) is connected to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- COO-OCH3,
- and the adjacent CH group (the one from CH(OH)).

Wait, that can't be right because the adjacent group would be another CH3. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The carbonyl group is at the end, so the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH
|
CH3

So the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the alpha carbon) is CH2OH. But then it's connected to:

- COO-OCH3,
- two H's,
- and a CH3.

Wait, no, that's not four different groups. If the alpha carbon is CH2OH, then it's connected to COO-OCH3, two Hs, and a CH3. So that's not four different groups. Therefore, no chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center, so no optical isomerism. Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the OH is on the same carbon as CH3 and another group. Let me think again. The correct structure is important here.

Wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOOC-CH2-OH? No, that can't be right. Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxy would be on the second carbon. So 2-hydroxypropanoate is HO-CH2-COO-OCH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH

So the alpha carbon (next to carbonyl) is CH2-OH. So the substituents are:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- two CH2's (wait, no). No, the alpha carbon is CH2-OH, which is connected to the carbonyl, two H's, and a CH2 group? Hmm, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to CH2OH. So the CH2OH is connected to the COO-OCH3. But then the CH2OH is attached to, perhaps, another CH3? No, maybe the structure is:

The structure is:
COO-OCH3 is connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to an OH and another CH3. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-OH
|
CH3

Wait, no, that can't be because the chain would be longer. Alternatively, maybe the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to CH(OH)CH3. So the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl is CH(OH)CH3. So the groups attached to that carbon are:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- CH3,
- and another CH3? No, because CH(OH)CH3 implies the carbon is connected to OH, two CH3 groups, and the COO group. Wait, but that would be three CH3 groups and an OH. So that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps it's connected to COO-OCH3, OH, CH3, and another CH2. No, I think I'm getting stuck, but perhaps the correct way is that the carbon has four different groups. So, if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COO-OCH3, then the central carbon is CH(OH) connected to:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- CH3,
- and another CH3? No, that wouldn't work. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO-OCH3. So the alpha carbon is CH2OH. Then, the groups attached are:

- COO-OCH3,
- two H's,
- and a CH2 group (from CH2OH).

Wait, that's only three substituents. So that can't be a chiral center. Hmm, I'm not confident about this. Maybe I should think about whether the molecule has a plane of symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it can't be chiral. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a chiral center because the alpha carbon is attached to four different groups. Wait, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to a CH(OH)CH3 group. So the alpha carbon is CH(OH)CH3. Therefore, the four groups attached are:

- O=C-OCH3,
- OH,
- CH3,
- and another CH3 (no, wait, because the CH(OH)CH3 would have three substituents: the COO group, OH, and two CH3 groups, but that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe it's connected to the COO group, OH, a CH3, and a CH2. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think that methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center because the alpha carbon is attached to two identical groups. Alternatively, perhaps it does have a chiral center, making it exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, maybe I should think about the molecular structure more clearly. Let me draw it out mentally. The molecule is CH3-CH(OH)-COO-OCH3. So the carbonyl is at the end, and the chain is CH2-CH(OH)-COO-OCH3. So the central carbon (CH(OH)) is connected to:

- a CH3 group (from CH2),
- an OH,
- the carbonyl group (COO-OCH3),
- and another CH2 group attached to the carbonyl.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to a CH2 group, which is connected to OH and another CH3. So the structure is O=C-OCH3-CH2-OH-CH3. No, that can't be because that would be a four-carbon chain. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe it's better to conclude that compound 2 has a chiral center and thus exhibits optical isomerism. Alternatively, maybe it's not a chiral center because of symmetry. I think I made a mistake earlier, and compound 2 does have a chiral center. For example, if the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to a CH(OH)CH3 group, then the central carbon is attached to four different groups: O=C-OCH3, OH, CH3, and another CH3? No, that can't be because it's attached to two CH3 groups. So that's not four different groups. Alternatively, perhaps it's connected to COO-OCH3, OH, CH3, and CH2. No, that doesn't seem right. I'm getting stuck here, so perhaps I should move on and come back.

3. Benzophenone. Structure is (Ph)2CO. So two phenyl groups attached to a ketone. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two phenyl groups and another R group? Wait, no. Benzophenone is diphenyl ketone: Ph-CO-Ph. The central carbon is the carbonyl carbon, which is double-bonded to O and attached to two phenyl groups. So the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph. The carbonyl carbon has double bond to O and two phenyl groups. So it's not a chiral center because it's double-bonded, and the carbon is trigonal, not tetrahedral. Also, adjacent carbons don't have four different groups. So benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers, so no optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. Fumarate is the diester of maleic acid. Structure: the central double bond is between two carbons, each substituted with an ester group. The structure is CH2=CH(COO-OCH3)2. Wait, no, more accurately, it's O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
C=C
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that can't be. Fumarate is a diester of maleic acid. So the structure is (Z) and (E) isomer. Wait, no, fumaric acid is the trans isomer of maleic acid. So dimethyl fumarate would have the structure where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. So the structure is:

O           O
||         ||
O-C-OCH3   O-C-OCH3
   \          /
     C=C

Wait, but that's the trans configuration. So the two ester groups are on opposite sides. Now, does dimethyl fumarate have any stereoisomerism? Well, fumarate itself is a trans-dioic acid. When esterified, the substituents are on opposite sides. But wait, in the ester, are there any stereogenic centers? No, because each ester group is attached to a carbon that's part of a double bond. Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is CH2=C(COO-OCH3)2. Each of the two carbons in the double bond has two ester groups and two CH3 groups? No, wait, each has an ester group and a methyl group? Let me think again. The structure of fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid. So the diacid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. No, wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is HOOC-CHCH-COOH, where the double bond is between the two CH groups. So fumarate is the trans isomer: HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, maleic acid is (Z)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, and fumaric acid is (E)-HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So when you make dimethyl fumarate, it's (E)-CH2(COO-OCH3)CH(COO-OCH3)CH2. Wait, no, perhaps it's more accurate to say that each of the two carbons in the double bond has an ester group. So the structure is O=C-OCH3 attached to each of the two carbons in the double bond. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
C=C
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

So each of the two carbons in the double bond has two ester groups (O-C-OCH3) attached. Wait, that can't be because each carbon can only have two substituents besides the double bond. So each carbon in the double bond has one ester group and one CH3? No, wait, each would have two ester groups. So the structure would have two ester groups on each carbon of the double bond.

Wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me think again. Fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid, which is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H. No, that's not right. Wait, no, butenedioic acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH. So fumarate is the trans isomer, while maleate is the cis. So when esterified, dimethyl fumarate would be the diester of fumaric acid. So each carboxylic acid group becomes a methyl ester. So the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)2.

Wait, but that's not possible because each CH in the double bond would have two COOCH3 groups. So each of the two carbons in the double bond has two ester groups attached. So each has COOCH3 on both sides of the double bond. Wait, that can't be because each carbon can only have two substituents (the double bond and two COOCH3 groups). So the structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
C=C
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

In this case, each of the two carbons in the double bond has two identical groups (the ester groups). So each carbon has two OCOOCH3 groups. But wait, if the substituents on each side are the same, then the molecule might have a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral. So, does this compound have any stereoisomerism? Well, the molecule has a central double bond with substituents on either side. If the substituents are the same on each side, then it's symmetrical and can't have stereoisomers. But wait, in this case, the substituents are the same on both sides (each has two ester groups). So it's symmetrical, so no stereoisomerism. Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are different. Wait, no, both substituents on each carbon are ester groups, which are the same. So, the molecule is symmetrical and thus doesn't have any optical isomerism. Wait, but I thought fumarate can have cis and trans isomers. Oh wait, wait. Wait, no, dimethyl fumarate is derived from fumaric acid, which is the trans isomer. But in the ester, the substituents are attached such that the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, making the molecule have a plane of symmetry. So, the molecule is symmetrical, so no optical isomerism. Hmm, but wait, another thought: perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. But wait, I recall that dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. Wait, no, wait. Wait, maleic acid is the cis isomer, and fumaric acid is the trans. So their diesters would have the same structure as the acid, just with ester groups instead of COOH. So, dimethyl maleate would have the two ester groups on the same side of the double bond, while dimethyl fumarate would have them on opposite sides. So, in that case, the molecule would have two stereoisomers: the cis (maleate) and trans (fumarate). But wait, the question is about optical isomerism, which is about chirality. So, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's not chiral. So for a molecule to have optical isomers, it must be chiral, meaning it doesn't have a plane of symmetry and has a chiral center or a chiral axis. So, dimethyl fumarate, since it's the trans diastereomer, is symmetrical, right? Because each substituent on either side of the double bond is the same. So, if I imagine looking at the molecule, it's symmetrical along the plane bisecting the double bond. So, the molecule isn't chiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, that can't be right because I thought that fumarate is a trans isomer and is a meso compound. Oh wait, meso compounds are achiral despite having stereocenters. For example, meso-tartaric acid is achiral but has stereocenters. So, if dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound, then it doesn't have optical isomerism. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Another approach: consider whether the molecule has a central plane of symmetry. If the two substituents on each side of the double bond are the same, then the molecule is symmetrical. So in dimethyl fumarate, each carbon in the double bond has two ester groups. So the molecule would be symmetrical, making it achiral. Therefore, it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier. Alternatively, perhaps I got the structure wrong. Wait, maybe the structure of dimethyl fumarate is O=C-OCH3 attached to each end of the double bond, but in a trans configuration. So, the two ester groups are on opposite sides. But if each carbon in the double bond has two ester groups, then the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism. Hmm, but I remember that maleic anhydride is a planar molecule (due to the double bond), but when it's esterified, does it have any chiral centers? No, because each ester group is attached to a carbon in the double bond, which is sp² hybridized and thus not a chiral center. So, in that case, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any chiral centers and isn't chiral, so no optical isomerism. Wait, but that can't be right. Because if the substituents are on opposite sides, perhaps the molecule isn't symmetrical. Wait, let me think again. If the two substituents on each carbon are the same (both ester groups), then the molecule is symmetrical. So the two ends are mirror images, making the molecule achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't exhibit optical isomerism. Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about another approach. The question is which of these compounds show optical isomerism. So, which have chiral centers or other forms of chirality.

Going back to the four compounds:

1. Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate. If the central carbon has four different groups, it's chiral. Earlier, I thought it might not, but perhaps it does. Let me imagine: each phenyl has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, each phenyl is symmetric in a way, but perhaps the arrangement makes the substituents on the central carbon different. For example, if the substituents are arranged such that each phenyl has a nitro and a carboxylate, but the positions relative to the central carbon are different, leading to four different groups attached to the central carbon. So, perhaps the central carbon is connected to two phenyl groups (each with nitro and carboxylate in certain positions), but if their substituents are arranged in a way that makes the groups on either side different, then the central carbon would have four different substituents. For example, one phenyl might have nitro in a position that's mirror image of the other. Thus, the central carbon would have four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, compound 1 would exhibit optical isomerism.

2. Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. If the alpha carbon has four different groups, it would be chiral. Earlier confusion about the structure aside, I think this molecule does have a chiral center. For example, if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COO-OCH3, the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- CH3,
- and another group. Wait, if the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COO-OCH3, then the carbon next to the OH is connected to:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- CH3,
- and another CH2 group? Or perhaps the structure is such that the alpha carbon is CH(OH) with four different groups. I think I'm getting stuck again, but perhaps I'll assume that it does have a chiral center, leading to optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone. No chiral centers. No optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate. As discussed, it's a symmetrical molecule, so no optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts about compound 1. Let me try to visualize it again. The structure is a biphenyl system (two phenyl rings connected at position 1). Each phenyl has nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. So, the substituents on each phenyl are at positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other. So on each phenyl, the substituents are opposite each other. Now, the central carbon (the one connecting the two phenyl rings) would have two phenyl groups attached. But each phenyl has a nitro and a carboxylate. Wait, but if the substituents are in para positions, then each phenyl is symmetric, meaning that the two phenyl groups attached to the central carbon are identical. So, the central carbon is attached to two identical phenyl groups, making its substituents not all different. So, the central carbon isn't a chiral center. Therefore, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, so going back:

Which compounds have optical isomerism?

Looking at each again:

1. No.

2. Let's think again. If the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COO-OCH3, then the central carbon (CH(OH)) is attached to:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- CH3,
- and another CH2 group? No, because that would require four bonds. Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH(OH)CH2-

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COO-OCH3. So the alpha carbon is CH2OH. Then, the groups attached are:

- COO-OCH3,
- two H's,
- and a CH2 group leading to another CH3. No, that's not four different groups. So, no chiral center.

Wait, maybe the structure is O=C-OCH3 connected to a CH(OH)CH3 group. So the CH(OH)CH3 is connected to COO-OCH3. So the substituents on the CH(OH)CH3 are:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- CH3,
- and another CH3. So that's three substituents, but wait, that would imply the carbon is connected to four groups, but two are CH3. So, groups are COO-OCH3, OH, CH3, and CH3. So, two CH3 groups, same, so not four different. So no chiral center. That would mean compound 2 doesn't have optical isomerism either. But that contradicts my earlier thought.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier, and in reality, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate doesn't have a chiral center. So, which compounds do have optical isomerism?

Looking again, the options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4: I think 1 and 2 don't, 4 doesn't.

B) 3 and 4: 3 no, 4 no.

C) 2 and 3: 2 maybe, 3 no.

D) 1 and 2: probably no.

Wait, but according to my earlier confusion, perhaps I'm wrong. So let's see:

Which of the four have a chiral center or are capable of optical isomerism?

1. No chiral center, so no.

2. I'm really unsure, but perhaps it does have a chiral center.

3. No.

4. No.

So, only compound 2 would have optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of the options have only 2. Let's look at the options again.

Options:

A) 1, 2, 4

B) 3,4

C) 2,3

D) 1,2

Wait, the correct answer isn't among the options with just 2, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about which compounds have a chiral center.

Compound 2: methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

The structure is HOCH2COO-OCH3. So the alpha carbon (the one next to the carbonyl) is CH2OH. So, the substituents are:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- two H's.

So, not four different groups. No chiral center.

Wait, but another possibility: perhaps the structure is HOCH2COO-OCH3, where the alpha carbon is CH2OH. That would be:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- two H's.

No, same as before.

Wait, but perhaps the structure is different. I'm getting stuck on this, but perhaps I should reconsider. Suppose the structure is CH3-CH(OH)-COO-OCH3. Then the central carbon (the one with OH) is CH(OH). The substituents are:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- CH3,
- and another CH2 group? No, that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon is CH(OH) connected to COO-OCH3, CH3, and another CH2 group. Wait, but that's four groups, making it a chiral center. So if the substituents are:

- COO-OCH3,
- OH,
- CH3,
- and another CH2 group (from the chain), which is also a CH3.

Wait, no, the chain would have to be longer. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that the central carbon is connected to four different groups, making it chiral.

Another approach: perhaps 2-hydroxypropanoate is the same as lactic acid's ester. Lactic acid has a chiral center. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a chiral center, making it exhibit optical isomerism.

Ah! So if 2-hydroxypropanoate is the ester of lactic acid, then the ester would have a chiral center. So in that case, compound 2 would exhibit optical isomerism.

In that case, which compounds have optical isomerism?

- Only compound 2.

But looking at the options, none have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, the options:

A) 1, 2, 4 → 3 compounds.

B) 3,4 → no.

C) 2,3 → 2 and 3.

D) 1,2 → 1 and 2.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps compound 4 does have optical isomerism. Let me re-examine it.

Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, which is the trans isomer. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
   \
C=C
   /
O
||
O-C-OCH3

But in this case, each substituent on the double bond is an ester group. So, each carbon in the double bond is attached to two ester groups. Therefore, the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure isn't symmetrical because the substituents are in a certain configuration. Wait, but if each carbon in the double bond has two identical groups, the molecule is symmetrical. So, I think dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2. But looking at the options, none have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier analysis.

Wait, perhaps compound 4 is a diastereomer, but not a chiral compound. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing that compound 4 has a trans configuration which allows for a plane of symmetry, making it not chiral. So, no optical isomerism.

So, back to the options.

Option A: 1,2,4 → but I think 1 and 4 don't have optical isomerism, so 2 is the only one.

But none of the options have only 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake about compound 1. Let me re-examine it.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The biphenyl structure is such that each phenyl has nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. So, each phenyl has substituents in positions that are opposite each other on the ring.

The central carbon (the one connecting the two phenyl rings) is connected to two phenyl groups, each with their own substituents. But are the substituents arranged in a way that the groups attached to the central carbon are all different?

Wait, each phenyl group has a nitro and a carboxylate. Are these substituents in positions that make each phenyl group identical on either side of the central carbon? Or is there a possibility that the substituents are arranged such that each phenyl group is chiral?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule as a whole lacks symmetry, making the central carbon a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps each phenyl group has a nitro and a carboxylate, but their positions relative to the central carbon are such that the substituents are not identical on both sides. For example, the nitro could be on one side of the phenyl and the carboxylate on the other, making the groups attached to the central carbon different. So, the substituents on the central carbon would be:

- Phenyl group A (with nitro and carboxylate in specific positions),
- Phenyl group B (same as A),
- Two ester groups (OCH3).

Wait, but if the substituents on each phenyl are in positions that make the two phenyl groups identical, then the central carbon would have two identical phenyl groups and two ester groups (which are identical as well), making it not a chiral center. So, no optical isomerism.

But perhaps the substituents on the phenyls are arranged in a way that makes the two phenyl groups different when attached to the central carbon. For example, if the nitro is on one side and the carboxylate on the other, leading to each phenyl being a mirror image of the other. So, the central carbon would have four different groups: two phenyl groups (each with different substituent arrangements) and two ester groups. Hmm, that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, making it not chiral.

I think I'm stuck. Let me try to summarize:

- Compound 1: No optical isomerism.

- Compound 2: Yes.

- Compound 3: No.

- Compound 4: No.

So, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But the options don't include an option where only 2 is correct. So, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I missed that compound 4 can have geometric isomerism, but that's not optical isomerism. Geometric isomerism is about cis and trans, which is different from optical isomerism (chirality). So, compound 4 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps compound 1 does have a chiral center. Let me imagine that the substituents on each phenyl are arranged in such a way that the central carbon is connected to four different groups. For example, each phenyl has a nitro and a carboxylate, but their positions relative to the central carbon are such that each phenyl is different. So, the central carbon is connected to:

- Phenyl A (with nitro at a certain position and carboxylate at another),
- Phenyl B (mirror image of A),
- two ester groups.

Wait, but if Phenyl B is a mirror image of Phenyl A, then the central carbon would have two identical phenyl groups, making it not chiral.

I think I'm going in circles. Perhaps I should conclude based on the options given.

The correct answer, I think, is that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing compound 4.

Wait, another angle: dimethyl fumarate is a diastereomer of dimethyl maleate. But are they optical isomers? No, because diastereomers aren't mirror images. Optical isomers are enantiomers, which are non-superimposable mirror images. So dimethyl fumarate itself doesn't have optical isomerism because it's a symmetrical compound. So, only compound 2 is correct.

But the options don't include an option where only 2 is correct. So perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes compounds 1, 2, and 4. But I thought 1 and 4 don't have optical isomerism. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 1. Let me think again. If the substituents on each phenyl are in positions 2 and 6, which are para to each other, then each phenyl is symmetric. Therefore, the central carbon is connected to two identical phenyl groups and two ester groups (which are identical). So, the central carbon has two identical phenyl groups and two identical ester groups, making it not a chiral center. So, compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, the only correct compound is 2, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that compound 4 has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, the only correct answer is compound 2. But again, the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 2. Let me imagine that the structure is such that the alpha carbon is a chiral center. For example, if the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COO-OCH3. Then, the carbon in the middle (the one with OH and H) would be a chiral center. So, if the structure is CH3-C(OH)H-COO-OCH3, the central carbon is attached to:

- CH3,
- OH,
- H,
- COO-OCH3.

That's four different groups, making it a chiral center. Therefore, compound 2 would exhibit optical isomerism.

In that case, the correct answer would be that only compound 2 does. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps compound 4 has a chiral center. Let me think. If the structure of dimethyl fumarate has a stereogenic center. No, because the double bond is in the middle, and each carbon in the double bond is attached to two ester groups, which are the same. So, no chiral centers.

Hmm. I think I'm stuck. Based on the analysis, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2. But the options don't have that. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for other possibilities. Let me quickly think about the options again.

The options are:

A) 1,2,4 → 3 compounds.

B) 3,4 → 2.

C) 2,3 → 2.

D)1,2 → 2.

From earlier analysis, I think only 2 is correct. But perhaps the correct answer is option A, meaning compounds 1, 2, and 4 exhibit optical isomerism. But I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps compound 4 (dimethyl fumarate) does have a chiral center. No, because the carbons in the double bond are sp² hybridized and not chiral centers. So, no.

Another approach: perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm wrong about compound 1 and 4.

Wait, perhaps in dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate, the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule is not symmetric, making the central carbon a chiral center. For example, if the nitro groups are on the same side of their respective phenyl rings, leading the central carbon to have four different substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the nitro groups are meta to each other on their respective phenyl rings, leading to a chiral center. So, in that case, compound 1 would have a chiral center and exhibit optical isomerism.

But without a clear structure, it's hard to say. Given the time I've spent, I'll make a decision based on the earlier analysis that only compound 2 has optical isomerism, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps compound 4 does have optical isomerism. Let me think again. If the structure of dimethyl fumarate is such that the substituents are on opposite sides, but each carbon in the double bond has two different substituents, making them chiral centers. But no, because each substituent is an ester group, which is the same as the other substituent on the same carbon. So, the substituents are same, so no chiral center.

Hmm. I think I'll have to go with my initial analysis. The correct answer is that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A, which includes compounds 1, 2, and 4.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and compound 1 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong about compound 1. Let me recheck:

If the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged in a way that each phenyl is not identical when attached to the central carbon, then the central carbon would have four different groups, making it chiral.

For example, if the nitro group on one phenyl is in a position that makes it different from the nitro group on the other phenyl, leading the central carbon to have four different substituents.

So, if one phenyl has nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2, and the other phenyl has nitro at 3 and carboxylate at 5 (as a possibility), but that's not the case. Wait, the question says 6,6' and 2,2'. So each phenyl has nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. So the substituents are in the same positions on both phenyls, making the molecule symmetric. So the central carbon is connected to two identical phenyl groups and two identical ester groups, making it not a chiral center.

Therefore, compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Given all this, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2. But the options don't include this, so perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct answer elsewhere. Another way to approach is to look for which of these compounds have chiral centers.

Compound 1: No.

Compound 2: Yes.

Compound 3: No.

Compound 4: No.

So the answer should be only compound 2. But the options don't have that, so perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1,2,4. But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating compound 4. Let me think again. Maybe dimethyl fumarate is a cis diastereomer, but it's not chiral. So, no.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is option A, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: perhaps compound 4 is a meso compound, which is achiral but has stereocenters. For example, if the molecule has stereocenters but is achiral due to a plane of symmetry. So, dimethyl fumarate could be a meso compound, hence no optical isomerism.

So, after all that, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A, including compounds 1,2,4.

But I'm not confident, and I think I'm running out of time. Based on the analysis, I'll conclude that the correct answer is option A.


To determine which compounds exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of a chiral center or other forms of chirality. Optical isomerism occurs when a compound has non-superimposable mirror images, typically due to a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups).

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   The structure consists of two phenyl rings connected at the 1-position, with nitro groups at the 6-position and carboxylate groups at the 2-position on each phenyl ring. Each phenyl ring has identical substituents (nitro and carboxylate) in symmetrical positions (para to each other). The central carbon, which connects the two phenyl rings, is attached to two identical phenyl groups and two identical ester groups. Since all four substituents are not different, the central carbon is not a chiral center. Therefore, this compound does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure is CH₃-CH(OH)-COO-OCH₃. The carbon adjacent to the carbonyl group (the alpha carbon) is bonded to four different groups:  
   - A hydroxyl group (OH),  
   - A methyl group (CH₃),  
   - An ester group (COO-OCH₃),  
   - And a hydrogen atom (H).  
   Since this carbon is a chiral center, the compound exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   The structure is (Ph)₂C=O, where Ph represents a phenyl group. The central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two identical phenyl groups. This carbon is trigonal planar and not a chiral center. Therefore, benzophenone does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   The structure is CH₂=C(COOCH₃)₂, where the two ester groups are on opposite sides of the double bond (trans configuration). Each carbon in the double bond is bonded to two identical ester groups, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry bisecting the double bond. Since the molecule is achiral, it does **not** exhibit optical isomerism.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2)** exhibits optical isomerism. However, none of the provided options include only compound 2. Given the structure of the question and the options provided, the most reasonable answer is **option A (1, 2, and 4)**, assuming a potential error in the analysis of compound 1 or 4.
