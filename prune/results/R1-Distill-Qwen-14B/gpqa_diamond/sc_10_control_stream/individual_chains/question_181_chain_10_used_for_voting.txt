Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a specific branch of the proton-proton chain stops. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several steps, and the pp-III branch is one of them. Let me try to think this through.

Wait, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. Oh right, that's the approximate time it takes for sunlight to travel from the Sun's core to Earth. So any changes in the Sun's core would take that long to be felt here on Earth. But wait, neutrinos are different because they can pass through the Sun almost unaffected, right? So the neutrinos we detect have already left the Sun, so their production isn't immediately affected by the stoppage. Or wait, no, because the question is about the production rate. Oh, wait no, neutrinos are produced in the core, so if the pp-III stops, the production of neutrinos from that process would stop, but the ones already on their way would still reach us.

Wait, but the question is about the flux ratio now, so the neutrinos detected now would have been produced just before the pp-III branch stopped. Or wait, because the time lag is the same as the light travel time, which is about 8.5 minutes. So any changes in the Sun's core neutrino production would take that time to reach us. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos detected now have been emitted in the last 8.5 minutes.

Wait, but neutrinos are produced in the Sun's core, and the pp-III chain produces neutrinos. If the pp-III stops, the production of these neutrinos stops. The other reactions, like the CNO cycle, continue as usual. So the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are part of the solar neutrino flux. So the flux from pp-III would drop to zero after the stoppage, but the other sources, like the CNO cycle, continue to produce neutrinos.

But wait, the neutrinos from the pp-III process... what's their energy? So the pp-III branch, I think, is the main proton-proton chain, and produces positrons via the reaction that emits a neutrino. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. In the pp-I, II, III branches... I think the main pp chain (pp-I) produces a neutrino when a proton converts into a neutron. The other branches might produce neutrinos as well. Or maybe only the main branch does.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III branch is a specific part of the proton-proton cycle. Wait, the standard model is that the proton-proton chain is the dominant process in the Sun, and it produces neutrinos as part of the reaction. The main pp chain produces a neutrino when a boron-8 nucleus undergoes beta decay. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the details. Alternatively, the pp chain leads to the production of carbon, which then goes into the CNO cycle. Hmm, not sure about that.

Wait, let me get this straight. The pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain. The main proton-proton chain, pp-I, produces a helium-4 nucleus and emits a positron and a neutrino. The other branches (like pp-II and pp-III) are variations that occur under different conditions, perhaps at lower temperatures or densities. If the pp-III branch stops, it would mean that a certain part of the proton-proton reactions is no longer happening. But would that affect the production of neutrinos?

So, neutrinos from the Sun are primarily produced via the proton-proton chain, the CNO cycle, and maybe other processes. The CNO cycle is more efficient at higher temperatures and is dominant in hotter stars, but in the Sun, the pp chain is dominant. 

If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of neutrinos from that specific part would stop. But the CNO cycle continues. So the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So what determines the energy of the neutrinos?

Wait, the pp chain produces neutrinos with lower energies compared to the CNO cycle. Because in the pp chain, the neutrinos are emitted when a proton becomes a neutron (I think), which would be around 0.5-1 MeV. Whereas the CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps up to a few MeV.

Wait, but the energies given here are in the hundreds of keV. So, 700 keV is 0.7 MeV, 800 is 0.8, 900 is 0.9. So the neutrinos in these bands would be from which processes?

Wait, the main solar neutrinos come from the pp chain. The Beryllium-7 in the CNO cycle can also produce neutrinos when it captures a proton to form Boron-8. That process emits a neutrino, which is the pep neutrino, and I think it has a higher energy than the main pp neutrinos.

Alternatively, maybe the energy spectrum of the neutrinos from the pp chain peaks around 0.5 MeV, so the 700-800 keV band is within that. The CNO cycle's neutrinos might be higher energy, perhaps around 1-4 MeV, but I'm not sure.

Wait, so if the pp-III branch stops, and that was a significant source of the lower-energy neutrinos, then the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) would decrease, but the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) might not be affected as much, because it's possibly from the CNO cycle or the pp-I branch.

Wait, but the question says that the pp-III branch stopped, so all other reactions remained as they were. So the CNO cycle continues, so any neutrinos from the CNO would still be produced.

So, if band 1 is from the pp-III process, and band 2 from other processes, then the flux in band 1 would drop, while band 2 remains the same. But the question is about the flux ratio (band 1 / band 2), so if band 1 goes down and band 2 doesn't, the ratio would decrease.

Wait, but let me think about the neutrino energies. The main pp chain produces neutrinos around 0.5 MeV. So 700 keV is 0.7 MeV, which is in band1. So if pp-III is part of the main pp chain, which produces neutrinos in that range, then stopping it would reduce the flux in band1.

But then, what about band 2, 800-900 keV? Are there other sources for that? The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, like the pep neutrino at around 1.4 MeV I think. So band 2 is 0.8-0.9 MeV, which is lower than the pep neutrino. Hmm, maybe the CNO cycle also produces some neutrinos in this range?

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO cycle contributes neutrinos at higher energies, so band2 would mainly be from the pp chain. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: the total neutrino flux from the Sun is mostly from the pp chain. The CNO cycle contributes a smaller fraction, about 1-2% or something. So if the pp-III branch (which is a major part of the pp chain) stops, the total neutrino flux would drop, but maybe the CNO-derived neutrinos remain.

So, the question is about the ratio of two specific bands. Let's say both bands are from the pp chain. Then, if the pp-III branch stops, which produces a certain part of the spectrum.

Wait, but in the pp chain, the neutrino energies are all about 0.5 MeV. So the 700-800 is part of that. If pp-III is a branch that contributes a specific part of the spectrum, perhaps a higher energy part.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp chain (pp-I) produces neutrinos around 0.5 MeV, and the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos. If pp-III stops, then the 700-800 band (0.7 MeV) would be affected more than 800-900 (0.8-0.9 MeV), if the latter are from the pp-I or CNO.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is a minor contributor, so stopping it would not drastically change the flux ratio.

Wait, the options are A) 10, B) 0.01, C)1, D)0.1.

If the ratio is 1, that implies that both bands are equally affected, which would happen if both are from the same source. But if band1 is from pp-III, which is stopped, and band2 is from other sources, then the ratio would go down. So if band1's flux is reduced to zero, and band2 remains the same, the ratio would be zero. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, but the question says that the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. So the neutrinos from the pp-III branch would stop arriving, but the others continue. So for the neutrinos that are currently being detected, since they take about 8.5 minutes to reach us, the ones emitted during the last 8.5 minutes are the ones since the pp-III stopped.

Wait, so the neutrinos detected now would consist of those emitted in the last 8.5 minutes (which would be zero from pp-III), and the ones emitted before that (which have both pp-III and other sources). Hmm, no, because the neutrinos are already emitted and traveling. So any neutrino emitted after the pp-III stopped would not contribute, but neutrinos emitted before would still be arriving.

Wait, but neutrinos are emitted in all directions, so the ones that reach us now are those that were emitted in the last 8.5 minutes (since they take that long to travel from the core to the surface, then to Earth). So any neutrinos emitted after the pp-III stopped (which was 8.5 minutes ago) would not have been emitted yet. So all the neutrinos we're detecting now were emitted before the stoppage, so they still include the pp-III flux.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the time is 8.5 minutes ago that the pp-III stopped. So neutrinos emitted after that time (i.e., in the last 8.5 minutes) would have been emitted without the pp-III contribution. But neutrinos take 8.5 minutes to reach Earth, so the neutrinos emitted just now (from the perspective of the Sun) would arrive here 8.5 minutes later. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos emitted during those 8.5 minutes (from the Sun's perspective) would reach Earth now. So any neutrinos emitted in the last 8.5 minutes on the Sun would be from a time when pp-III was stopped.

Wait, that is, if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, then the neutrinos emitted since then (the last 8.5 minutes) were emitted without pp-III. So the neutrinos that reach Earth now are those emitted in the last 8.5 minutes on the Sun. So the pp-III neutrinos would not contribute to the current flux.

Therefore, the neutrino flux detected now is from the time when the pp-III had already stopped. So band1 (700-800 keV) would be mostly from pp-III, which has stopped, so its flux would drop. Band2 (800-900 keV) would be from other sources, like the CNO cycle or the pp-I branch, which are still active.

So, if the pp-III was a major source of band1, then the flux in band1 would drop significantly, while band2 remains roughly the same.

So the ratio would be (flux_band1)/(flux_band2) = (something small)/ (something unchanged). So the ratio would be a small number.

But what was the relative contributions? Let me think. The pp chain contributes about 99% of the solar neutrinos, and CNO contributes about 1%. So, if the pp-III is part of the pp chain, and it's a big part, then stopping it would reduce the total pp flux.

Assuming that before the stoppage, the pp chain contributed almost all the neutrinos. So the flux in band1 (700-800 keV) is dominated by the pp-III, and band2 (800-900 keV) is from other pp branches or CNO.

Wait, but I thought that the pp chain neutrinos are all around ~0.5 MeV, so 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) is part of the pp neutrinos. So if the pp-III stops, the flux in that band would drop, but the CNO neutrinos, which are higher energy (like 1-4 MeV), would be in band2 only if the band2 is 0.8-0.9, which is lower than their typical energies.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, so band2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) is actually lower than the typical CNO neutrinos. Hmm. So perhaps most of the neutrinos in band2 are from the pp chain as well, but from a different branch.

Wait, another approach: the solar neutrino spectrum peaks around 0.5 MeV. So band1 (0.7-0.8) is towards the higher end of the pp neutrinos. Band2 (0.8-0.9) is a bit higher. So if the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos than the pp-I branch, then stopping pp-III would reduce band1 more than band2.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch doesn't contribute much to the neutrino flux. So stopping it would have a minor effect on the total flux. But the question is about the ratio of two specific bands.

Wait, but I'm not getting much further. Let me think of possible scenarios.

If the pp-III branch produces a significant fraction of the neutrinos in band1 but not in band2, then the ratio would drop. For example, if band1 was 50% from pp-III and 50% from others, and band2 was 90% from others and 10% from pp-III. Then, if pp-III stops, band1 would drop to 50% of its original, and band2 to 90% + 10%*0=90% of its original.

But this is speculative. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is responsible for a certain fraction of the flux in band1 but not in band2. So if band1 was 90% pp-III and 10% CNO, and band2 was 5% pp-III and 95% CNO, then after pp-III stops, band1 is 10% of original, band2 is 95% of original. So the ratio would be (0.1)/(0.95) ≈ 0.105. So about 0.1, which is option D.

But the options include 0.1 (D), 0.01 (B), etc. Alternatively, if the pp-III contributes more to band1 and less to band2, the ratio would be lower.

Alternatively, if the pp-III contributes 100% of band1 and 0% of band2, but that's unlikely because the neutrinos come from various processes.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact energy distribution. Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from pp-III are at lower energies than those from CNO. So band1 (700-800) might be more from pp, and band2 (800-900) could be from other sources.

So if the pp-III stops, band1 would have less, band2 would remain same. So the ratio would be (something less) / (same as before).

But, considering that the CNO contributes a small fraction, perhaps the majority of band2 is from pp as well.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III produces a specific part of the spectrum. For example, pp-III might produce neutrinos at around 0.7-0.8 MeV, which is band1, and the other processes (like pp-I or CNO) produce 0.8-0.9 MeV (band2).

So if pp-III stops, the flux in band1 would drop to zero, and band2 remains the same. Thus, the ratio would be zero. But that's not an option. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III produces a significant fraction of band1 but not the entire thing. So if, say, 90% of band1 comes from pp-III, and 10% from the CNO, and band2 is 95% CNO and 5% pp-III. So after the stoppage, band1 is 10% of original, and band2 is 95% of original. Then the ratio is (0.1)/(0.95)= approx 0.105, so option D (0.1).

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III produces more neutrinos in band1 than the others. So the ratio could be lower. For example, 90% in band1 from pp-III, 10% from others. Band2 is 95% from others, 5% from pp-III. So after stopping, band1 is 10% of original, band2 is 95% of original. So 0.1 / 0.95 is about 0.105, which is close to 0.1.

Alternatively, if band1 was 90% from pp-III and 10% from CNO, and band2 was 85% from CNO and 15% from pp-III. Then, after pp-III stops, band1 is 10% of original, band2 is 85% of original. Ratio is 10/85 = approx 0.117, which is about 0.1.

So the ratio would be approximately 0.1, which is option D.

Alternatively, if the pp-III produces more in band2 than I thought, then the ratio would be higher.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: neutrinos from the CNO cycle are higher energy than those from the pp chain. So, CNO neutrinos are like 1-4 MeV. So band2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) is lower than that. So the neutrinos in band2 are probably from the pp chain. So if the pp-III is a branch that contributes a certain part of the pp neutrinos, which are all around 0.5 MeV, then perhaps the band1 and band2 are both from the pp chain.

But in that case, stopping the pp-III would reduce both bands, but perhaps more in band1. So if the pp-III is responsible for 50% of band1 and 20% of band2, then the ratio after stoppage would be (0.5 * original_band1) / (0.8 * original_band2). But without knowing the original ratio, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if both bands are from the same process (pp chain), then the ratio would remain the same. But that would suggest the answer is C) 1, but that doesn't fit with the idea that pp-III stopped.

Wait, but maybe the pp-III doesn't contribute much to the neutrino flux in the first place. So stopping it would have a minor effect, making the ratio close to 1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III produces a small fraction of the neutrinos, so stopping it wouldn't change the ratio much. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: what's the typical neutrino energy from the pp chain? I think it's around 0.5 MeV. So 700 keV is 0.7 MeV, which is higher than the average. So perhaps only a small fraction of pp neutrinos are in band1. Band2 is even higher, 0.8-0.9 MeV.

If the pp-III produces higher-energy neutrinos than the pp-I, then stopping pp-III would reduce the number in band1 more than band2. So if pp-III contributes, say, 30% of the neutrinos in band1 and 10% of band2, then after stopping, band1 is 70% of its original, and band2 is 90% of original. So ratio is 0.7 / 0.9 = approx 0.77. That's not an option.

Hmm, this is getting more complicated. Maybe I should think about the relative contributions.

In the Sun, the dominant neutrino production is via the pp chain, specifically the main pp-I branch. The pp-III branch is a minor part of the pp chain. So if the pp-III stops, the total pp flux would decrease by a small amount, but the CNO flux remains the same.

Thus, the neutrinos in band1 (700-800) are mostly from the pp chain, so if the pp-III is a minor contributor, the flux in band1 wouldn't drop by much. Similarly, band2 (800-900) is also from the pp chain, but if pp-III contributes less to band2 than band1, then stopping it might not change band2 as much. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the pp-III doesn't produce many neutrinos in these bands. So the ratio remains approximately the same. So the answer is C) 1.

But I'm not confident. Another angle: the question asks about the ratio of the flux. If the pp-III branch stopped, which neutrinos would be affected?

Wait, neutrinos from the pp chain are emitted when a proton converts into a neutron, releasing a positron and a neutrino. The energy of the neutrino is related to the mass difference in the reaction. The main pp chain produces neutrinos around 0.5 MeV. So 700 keV is higher than that. So maybe band1 is higher than the typical pp neutrinos. So perhaps the neutrinos in band1 are from a different process, like the CNO cycle's Beryllium-7 decay, which emits a neutrino at around 0.8-0.9 MeV. Wait, no, I think the Beryllium-7 decay emits a neutrino when it captures a proton to form Boron-8, which is the pep neutrino, and that's about 1.4 MeV.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the CNO cycle produces a continuous spectrum of neutrinos, including some in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range. If that's the case, then stopping the pp-III (which contributes to lower-energy neutrinos) would affect band1 more than band2.

But I'm getting stuck. I think I need to make an educated guess based on the options. The possible answers are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1. 

If the pp-III contributes significantly to band1 but not to band2, the ratio could be 0.1. So option D.

The question involves the sudden stoppage of the pp-III branch in the Sun's core, 8.5 minutes ago, and its impact on the flux ratio of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). Neutrinos are produced in the Sun through processes like the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle, with the pp chain being the dominant contributor. The pp-III branch is a specific part of the pp chain, and its stoppage would reduce the neutrino flux from that process.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Energy Spectra**:
   - The pp chain produces neutrinos with energies typically around 0.5 MeV. Band 1 (700-800 keV or 0.7-0.8 MeV) is within this range, suggesting it is primarily influenced by the pp chain.
   - Band 2 (800-900 keV or 0.8-0.9 MeV) is slightly higher in energy. While the CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos (e.g., the pep neutrino at ~1.4 MeV), it is a minor contributor to the total solar neutrino flux (~1-2%).

2. **Impact of pp-III Stoppage**:
   - The pp-III branch is assumed to contribute significantly to the neutrino flux in band 1. If it stops, the flux in band 1 would decrease substantially.
   - Band 2 is less affected because it is not dominated by the pp-III branch. The CNO cycle and other pp branches likely continue to contribute neutrinos in this range.

3. **Flux Ratio**:
   - The flux ratio (band 1 / band 2) would decrease because band 1 loses a significant fraction of its neutrinos from the pp-III branch, while band 2 remains relatively unaffected.
   - Based on the reasoning, the ratio is expected to drop to approximately 0.1, as band 1's flux is reduced more than band 2's.

### Conclusion:
The stoppage of the pp-III branch significantly impacts band 1 but has a smaller effect on band 2, leading to a flux ratio of approximately 0.1.

Okay, so I've got this question about neutrinos from the Sun and what happens when a specific branch of the proton-proton chain stops. Hmm, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several steps, and the pp-III branch is one of them. Let me try to think this through.

Wait, the question says that the pp-III branch suddenly stopped about 8 and a half minutes ago. Oh right, that's the approximate time it takes for sunlight to travel from the Sun's core to Earth.

Oh, wait no, neutrinos are produced in the core, so if the pp-III stops, the production of neutrinos from that process would stop, but the ones already on their way would still reach us.

Wait, but the question is about the flux ratio now, so the neutrinos detected now would have been produced just before the pp-III branch stopped. Or wait, because the time lag is the same as the light travel time, which is about 8.5 minutes. So any changes in the Sun's core neutrino production would take that time to reach us. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos detected now have been emitted in the last 8.5 minutes.

Wait, but neutrinos are produced in the Sun's core, and the pp-III chain produces neutrinos. If the pp-III stops, the production of these neutrinos stops. The other reactions, like the CNO cycle, continue as usual. So the neutrinos from the pp-III branch are part of the solar neutrino flux. So the flux from pp-III would drop to zero after the stoppage, but the other sources, like the CNO cycle, continue to produce neutrinos.

But wait, the neutrinos from the pp-III process... what's their energy? So the pp-III branch, I think, is the main proton-proton chain, and produces positrons via the reaction that emits a neutrino.

The other branches might produce neutrinos as well. Or maybe only the main branch does.

The main pp chain produces a neutrino when a boron-8 nucleus undergoes beta decay. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the details. Alternatively, the pp chain leads to the production of carbon, which then goes into the CNO cycle. Hmm, not sure about that.

Wait, let me get this straight. The pp-III branch is part of the proton-proton chain. The main proton-proton chain, pp-I, produces a helium-4 nucleus and emits a positron and a neutrino. The other branches (like pp-II and pp-III) are variations that occur under different conditions, perhaps at lower temperatures or densities. If the pp-III branch stops, it would mean that a certain part of the proton-proton reactions is no longer happening. But would that affect the production of neutrinos?

So, neutrinos from the Sun are primarily produced via the proton-proton chain, the CNO cycle, and maybe other processes. The CNO cycle is more efficient at higher temperatures and is dominant in hotter stars, but in the Sun, the pp chain is dominant. 

If the pp-III branch stops, then the production of neutrinos from that specific part would stop. But the CNO cycle continues. So the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). So what determines the energy of the neutrinos?

Wait, the pp chain produces neutrinos with lower energies compared to the CNO cycle. Because in the pp chain, the neutrinos are emitted when a proton becomes a neutron (I think), which would be around 0.5-1 MeV. Whereas the CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, perhaps up to a few MeV.

Wait, the main solar neutrinos come from the pp chain. The Beryllium-7 in the CNO cycle can also produce neutrinos when it captures a proton to form Boron-8. That process emits a neutrino, which is the pep neutrino, and I think it has a higher energy than the main pp neutrinos.

Alternatively, maybe the energy spectrum of the neutrinos from the pp chain peaks around 0.5 MeV, so the 700-800 keV band is within that. The CNO cycle's neutrinos might be higher energy, perhaps around 1-4 MeV, but I'm not sure.

Wait, so if the pp-III branch stops, and that was a significant source of the lower-energy neutrinos, then the flux in band 1 (700-800 keV) would decrease, but the flux in band 2 (800-900 keV) might not be affected as much, because it's possibly from the CNO cycle or the pp-I branch.

Wait, but the question says that the pp-III branch stopped, so all other reactions remained as they were. So the CNO cycle continues, so any neutrinos from the CNO would still be produced.

So, if band 1 is from the pp-III process, and band 2 from other processes, then the flux in band 1 would drop, while band 2 remains the same. But the question is about the flux ratio (band 1 / band 2), so if band 1 goes down and band 2 doesn't, the ratio would decrease.

Wait, but let me think about the neutrino energies. The main pp chain produces neutrinos around 0.5 MeV. So 700 keV is 0.7 MeV, which is in band1. So if pp-III is part of the main pp chain, which produces neutrinos in that range, then stopping it would reduce the flux in band1.

But then, what about band 2, 800-900 keV? Are there other sources for that? The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, like the pep neutrino at around 1.4 MeV I think. So band 2 is 0.8-0.9 MeV, which is lower than the pep neutrino. Hmm, maybe the CNO cycle also produces some neutrinos in this range?

Alternatively, perhaps the CNO cycle contributes neutrinos at higher energies, so band2 would mainly be from the pp chain. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach: the total neutrino flux from the Sun is mostly from the pp chain. The CNO cycle contributes a smaller fraction, about 1-2% or something. So if the pp-III branch (which is a major part of the pp chain) stops, the total neutrino flux would drop, but maybe the CNO-derived neutrinos remain.

So, the question is about the ratio of two specific bands. Let's say both bands are from the pp chain. Then, if the pp-III branch stops, which produces a certain part of the spectrum.

Wait, but in the pp chain, the neutrino energies are all about 0.5 MeV. So the 700-800 is part of that. If pp-III is a branch that contributes a specific part of the spectrum, perhaps a higher energy part.

Alternatively, perhaps the main pp chain (pp-I) produces neutrinos around 0.5 MeV, and the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos. If pp-III stops, then the 700-800 band (0.7 MeV) would be affected more than 800-900 (0.8-0.9 MeV), if the latter are from the pp-I or CNO.

Wait, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is a minor contributor, so stopping it would not drastically change the flux ratio.

Wait, the options are A) 10, B) 0.01, C)1, D)0.1.

If the ratio is 1, that implies that both bands are equally affected, which would happen if both are from the same source. But if band1 is from pp-III, which is stopped, and band2 is from other sources, then the ratio would go down. So if band1's flux is reduced to zero, and band2 remains the same, the ratio would be zero. But that's not one of the options.

Wait, but the question says that the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago. So the neutrinos from the pp-III branch would stop arriving, but the others continue. So for the neutrinos that are currently being detected, since they take about 8.5 minutes to reach us, the ones emitted during the last 8.5 minutes are the ones since the pp-III stopped.

Wait, so the neutrinos detected now would consist of those emitted in the last 8.5 minutes (which would be zero from pp-III), and the ones emitted before that (which have both pp-III and other sources). Hmm, no, because the neutrinos are already emitted and traveling. So any neutrino emitted after the pp-III stopped would not contribute, but neutrinos emitted before would still be arriving.

Wait, but neutrinos are emitted in all directions, so the ones that reach us now are those that were emitted in the last 8.5 minutes (since they take that long to travel from the core to the surface, then to Earth). So any neutrinos emitted after the pp-III stopped (which was 8.5 minutes ago) would not have been emitted yet. So all the neutrinos we're detecting now were emitted before the stoppage, so they still include the pp-III flux.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the time is 8.5 minutes ago that the pp-III stopped. So neutrinos emitted after that time (i.e., in the last 8.5 minutes) would have been emitted without the pp-III contribution. But neutrinos take 8.5 minutes to reach Earth, so the neutrinos emitted just now (from the perspective of the Sun) would arrive here 8.5 minutes later. So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos emitted during those 8.5 minutes (from the Sun's perspective) would reach Earth now. So any neutrinos emitted in the last 8.5 minutes on the Sun would be from a time when pp-III was stopped.

Wait, that is, if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, then the neutrinos emitted since then (the last 8.5 minutes) were emitted without pp-III. So the neutrinos that reach Earth now are those emitted in the last 8.5 minutes on the Sun. So the pp-III neutrinos would not contribute to the current flux.

Therefore, the neutrino flux detected now is from the time when the pp-III had already stopped. So band1 (700-800 keV) would be mostly from pp-III, which has stopped, so its flux would drop. Band2 (800-900 keV) would be from other sources, like the CNO cycle or the pp-I branch, which are still active.

So, if the pp-III was a major source of band1, then the flux in band1 would drop significantly, while band2 remains roughly the same.

So the ratio would be (flux_band1)/(flux_band2) = (something small)/ (something unchanged). So the ratio would be a small number.

But what was the relative contributions? Let me think. The pp chain contributes about 99% of the solar neutrinos, and CNO contributes about 1%. So, if the pp-III is part of the pp chain, and it's a big part, then stopping it would reduce the total pp flux.

Assuming that before the stoppage, the pp chain contributed almost all the neutrinos. So the flux in band1 (700-800 keV) is dominated by the pp-III, and band2 (800-900 keV) is from other pp branches or CNO.

Wait, but I thought that the pp chain neutrinos are all around ~0.5 MeV, so 700-800 keV (0.7-0.8 MeV) is part of the pp neutrinos. So if the pp-III stops, the flux in that band would drop, but the CNO neutrinos, which are higher energy (like 1-4 MeV), would be in band2 only if the band2 is 0.8-0.9, which is lower than their typical energies.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. The CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos, so band2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) is actually lower than the typical CNO neutrinos. Hmm. So perhaps most of the neutrinos in band2 are from the pp chain as well, but from a different branch.

Wait, another approach: the solar neutrino spectrum peaks around 0.5 MeV. So band1 (0.7-0.8) is towards the higher end of the pp neutrinos. Band2 (0.8-0.9) is a bit higher. So if the pp-III branch produces higher-energy neutrinos than the pp-I branch, then stopping pp-III would reduce band1 more than band2.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch doesn't contribute much to the neutrino flux. So stopping it would have a minor effect on the total flux. But the question is about the ratio of two specific bands.

Wait, but I'm not getting much further. Let me think of possible scenarios.

If the pp-III branch produces a significant fraction of the neutrinos in band1 but not in band2, then the ratio would drop. For example, if band1 was 50% from pp-III and 50% from others, and band2 was 90% from others and 10% from pp-III. Then, if pp-III stops, band1 would drop to 50% of its original, and band2 to 90% + 10%*0=90% of its original.

But this is speculative. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III branch is responsible for a certain fraction of the flux in band1 but not in band2. So if band1 was 90% pp-III and 10% CNO, and band2 was 5% pp-III and 95% CNO, then after pp-III stops, band1 is 10% of original, band2 is 95% of original. So the ratio would be (0.1)/(0.95) ≈ 0.105. So about 0.1, which is option D.

But the options include 0.1 (D), 0.01 (B), etc. Alternatively, if the pp-III contributes more to band1 and less to band2, the ratio would be lower.

Alternatively, if the pp-III contributes 100% of band1 and 0% of band2, but that's unlikely because the neutrinos come from various processes.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact energy distribution. Alternatively, perhaps the neutrinos from pp-III are at lower energies than those from CNO. So band1 (700-800) might be more from pp, and band2 (800-900) could be from other sources.

So if the pp-III stops, band1 would have less, band2 would remain same. So the ratio would be (something less) / (same as before).

But, considering that the CNO contributes a small fraction, perhaps the majority of band2 is from pp as well.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III produces a specific part of the spectrum. For example, pp-III might produce neutrinos at around 0.7-0.8 MeV, which is band1, and the other processes (like pp-I or CNO) produce 0.8-0.9 MeV (band2).

So if pp-III stops, the flux in band1 would drop to zero, and band2 remains the same. Thus, the ratio would be zero. But that's not an option. So maybe that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III produces a significant fraction of band1 but not the entire thing. So if, say, 90% of band1 comes from pp-III, and 10% from the CNO, and band2 is 95% CNO and 5% pp-III. So after the stoppage, band1 is 10% of original, and band2 is 95% of original. Then the ratio is (0.1)/(0.95)= approx 0.105, so option D (0.1).

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III produces more neutrinos in band1 than the others. So the ratio could be lower. For example, 90% in band1 from pp-III, 10% from others. Band2 is 95% from others, 5% from pp-III. So after stopping, band1 is 10% of original, band2 is 95% of original. So 0.1 / 0.95 is about 0.105, which is close to 0.1.

Alternatively, if band1 was 90% from pp-III and 10% from CNO, and band2 was 85% from CNO and 15% from pp-III. Then, after pp-III stops, band1 is 10% of original, band2 is 85% of original. Ratio is 10/85 = approx 0.117, which is about 0.1.

So the ratio would be approximately 0.1, which is option D.

Alternatively, if the pp-III produces more in band2 than I thought, then the ratio would be higher.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: neutrinos from the CNO cycle are higher energy than those from the pp chain. So, CNO neutrinos are like 1-4 MeV. So band2 (0.8-0.9 MeV) is lower than that. So the neutrinos in band2 are probably from the pp chain. So if the pp-III is a branch that contributes a certain part of the pp neutrinos, which are all around 0.5 MeV, then perhaps the band1 and band2 are both from the pp chain.

But in that case, stopping the pp-III would reduce both bands, but perhaps more in band1. So if the pp-III is responsible for 50% of band1 and 20% of band2, then the ratio after stoppage would be (0.5 * original_band1) / (0.8 * original_band2). But without knowing the original ratio, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, if both bands are from the same process (pp chain), then the ratio would remain the same. But that would suggest the answer is C) 1, but that doesn't fit with the idea that pp-III stopped.

Wait, but maybe the pp-III doesn't contribute much to the neutrino flux in the first place. So stopping it would have a minor effect, making the ratio close to 1. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III produces a small fraction of the neutrinos, so stopping it wouldn't change the ratio much. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: what's the typical neutrino energy from the pp chain? I think it's around 0.5 MeV. So 700 keV is 0.7 MeV, which is higher than the average. So perhaps only a small fraction of pp neutrinos are in band1. Band2 is even higher, 0.8-0.9 MeV.

If the pp-III produces higher-energy neutrinos than the pp-I, then stopping pp-III would reduce the number in band1 more than band2. So if pp-III contributes, say, 30% of the neutrinos in band1 and 10% of band2, then after stopping, band1 is 70% of its original, and band2 is 90% of original. So ratio is 0.7 / 0.9 = approx 0.77. That's not an option.

Hmm, this is getting more complicated. Maybe I should think about the relative contributions.

In the Sun, the dominant neutrino production is via the pp chain, specifically the main pp-I branch. The pp-III branch is a minor part of the pp chain. So if the pp-III stops, the total pp flux would decrease by a small amount, but the CNO flux remains the same.

Thus, the neutrinos in band1 (700-800) are mostly from the pp chain, so if the pp-III is a minor contributor, the flux in band1 wouldn't drop by much. Similarly, band2 (800-900) is also from the pp chain, but if pp-III contributes less to band2 than band1, then stopping it might not change band2 as much. But I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the pp-III doesn't produce many neutrinos in these bands. So the ratio remains approximately the same. So the answer is C) 1.

But I'm not confident. Another angle: the question asks about the ratio of the flux. If the pp-III branch stopped, which neutrinos would be affected?

Wait, neutrinos from the pp chain are emitted when a proton converts into a neutron, releasing a positron and a neutrino. The energy of the neutrino is related to the mass difference in the reaction. The main pp chain produces neutrinos around 0.5 MeV. So 700 keV is higher than that. So maybe band1 is higher than the typical pp neutrinos. So perhaps the neutrinos in band1 are from a different process, like the CNO cycle's Beryllium-7 decay, which emits a neutrino at around 0.8-0.9 MeV. Wait, no, I think the Beryllium-7 decay emits a neutrino when it captures a proton to form Boron-8, which is the pep neutrino, and that's about 1.4 MeV.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, maybe the CNO cycle produces a continuous spectrum of neutrinos, including some in the 0.7-0.9 MeV range. If that's the case, then stopping the pp-III (which contributes to lower-energy neutrinos) would affect band1 more than band2.

But I'm getting stuck. I think I need to make an educated guess based on the options. The possible answers are 10, 0.01, 1, 0.1. 

If the pp-III contributes significantly to band1 but not to band2, the ratio could be 0.1. So option D.


The question involves the sudden stoppage of the pp-III branch in the Sun's core, 8.5 minutes ago, and its impact on the flux ratio of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). Neutrinos are produced in the Sun through processes like the proton-proton (pp) chain and the CNO cycle, with the pp chain being the dominant contributor. The pp-III branch is a specific part of the pp chain, and its stoppage would reduce the neutrino flux from that process.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Neutrino Energy Spectra**:
   - The pp chain produces neutrinos with energies typically around 0.5 MeV. Band 1 (700-800 keV or 0.7-0.8 MeV) is within this range, suggesting it is primarily influenced by the pp chain.
   - Band 2 (800-900 keV or 0.8-0.9 MeV) is slightly higher in energy. While the CNO cycle produces higher-energy neutrinos (e.g., the pep neutrino at ~1.4 MeV), it is a minor contributor to the total solar neutrino flux (~1-2%).

2. **Impact of pp-III Stoppage**:
   - The pp-III branch is assumed to contribute significantly to the neutrino flux in band 1. If it stops, the flux in band 1 would decrease substantially.
   - Band 2 is less affected because it is not dominated by the pp-III branch. The CNO cycle and other pp branches likely continue to contribute neutrinos in this range.

3. **Flux Ratio**:
   - The flux ratio (band 1 / band 2) would decrease because band 1 loses a significant fraction of its neutrinos from the pp-III branch, while band 2 remains relatively unaffected.
   - Based on the reasoning, the ratio is expected to drop to approximately 0.1, as band 1's flux is reduced more than band 2's.

### Conclusion:
The stoppage of the pp-III branch significantly impacts band 1 but has a smaller effect on band 2, leading to a flux ratio of approximately 0.1.
