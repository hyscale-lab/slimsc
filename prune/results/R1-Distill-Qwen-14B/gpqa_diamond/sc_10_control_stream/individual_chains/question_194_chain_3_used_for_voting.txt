Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for three spins. Hmm, I remember that partition functions are all about summing over all possible states, each weighted by their Boltzmann factor. The energy here is given by E = -J(S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Each spin can be +1 or -1. 

Wait, so each spin has two possible states. Since there are three spins, S1, S2, S3, the total number of possible states is 2^3 = 8. Each state can be represented by the combination of their spins. For example, one state could be (+1, +1, +1), another (+1, +1, -1), and so on.

The partition function Z is the sum over all these states of exp(-β E), where β is 1/(kT). But wait, E is given in terms of the spins. So for each state, I need to compute E and then the exponential term.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Let me think about the energy expression. E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So each pair contributes a term. Let me see what each possible value of each term can be.

Each S_i is ±1, so S_i S_j is also ±1. So each term S_i S_j can be 1 or -1. Let's denote each term as t_ij. So E = -J (t12 + t13 + t23). 

Wait, but each t_ij is either +1 or -1. So the sum t12 + t13 + t23 can range from -3 to +3 in steps of 2, I think. Because each term is ±1, the total sum can be 3 (if all +1), 1 (if two +1 and one -1), -1 (if two -1 and one +1), or -3 (if all -1). So the possible sums are 3, 1, -1, -3.

Therefore, the energy E is -J multiplied by that sum. So E can be -J*(3), -J*(1), -J*(-1) = J, or -J*(-3) = 3J.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. If the sum is 3, then E = -J*3 = -3J. If the sum is 1, E = -J. If the sum is -1, E = J. If sum is -3, E = 3J.

So each state will have an energy of either -3J, -J, J, or 3J. Then, the Boltzmann factor for each state is exp(-β E). So for each energy level, we'll calculate how many states have that energy, multiply by the exponential term, and sum them all.

So first, I need to find how many states correspond to each possible energy.

Let me think about the possible values of the sum S = t12 + t13 + t23.

Let me denote each t_ij as S_i S_j. For three spins, the possible sums:

Case 1: S=3. This happens when all t_ij are +1. So S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. What does that imply about the spins?

If S1S2=1, S1 and S2 are the same. Similarly, S1S3=1, so S3 is same as S1. So all three spins are the same. So either all +1 or all -1. So how many such states? Two: (+1,+1,+1) and (-1,-1,-1). So N=2 when S=3.

Case 2: S=1. This happens when two t_ij are +1 and one is -1. Let's see, the sum is 1. So for example, two +1 and one -1. How many states have this sum?

Wait, but how does the sum of the three t_ij terms being 1 happen? Let's think. Suppose t12=1, t13=1, t23= -1. So sum is 1+1-1=1. But what's the condition for this?

t12=1 → S1=S2
t13=1 → S1=S3
t23=-1 → S2=-S3

Wait, but if S1=S2 and S1=S3, then S2=S3. But t23 would be 1, not -1. So that's a contradiction. So perhaps this particular combination isn't possible. Hmm, maybe my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of looking at t_ij, I should look at the actual spin configurations and compute their energies.

Let me list all possible 8 states and compute their energies.

Each state is (S1, S2, S3), each being +1 or -1.

1. (1,1,1)
Compute the sum: S1S2 = 1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1 → sum=3. E= -J *3 = -3J.

2. (1,1,-1)
sum: 1*(1) =1, 1*(-1) =-1, 1*(-1)= -1. Sum= 1-1-1 =-1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. (1,-1,1)
sum: (1*-1) =-1, (1*1)=1, (-1*1)=-1. Sum = -1 +1 -1 =-1. E= J.

4. (1,-1,-1)
sum: (1*-1)=-1, (1*-1)=-1, (-1*-1)=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 =-1. E= J.

5. (-1,1,1)
sum: (-1*1)=-1, (-1*1)=-1, (1*1)=1. Sum: -1-1+1= -1. E= J.

6. (-1,1,-1)
sum: (-1*1)=-1, (-1*-1)=1, (1*-1)=-1. Sum: -1 +1 -1 =-1. E= J.

7. (-1,-1,1)
sum: (-1*-1)=1, (-1*1)=-1, (-1*1)=-1. Sum: 1-1-1=-1. E= J.

8. (-1,-1,-1)
sum: (-1*-1)=1, (-1*-1)=1, (-1*-1)=1. Sum=3. E= -3J.

Wait, so from this, states 1 and 8 have E= -3J. All the other 6 states have E= J. Oh, wait no: no, wait, in state 2, which is (1,1,-1), the sum was -1, but earlier I thought that sum was -1, giving E= J. Similarly, states 3 through 7 all have sum=-1, so E= J. So wait, all 6 of those states have E= J except for 1 and 8.

Wait, but when I calculated state 2: (1,1,-1), the sum was (1)(1) =1, (1)(-1)=-1, (1)(-1)=-1 → sum=1 -1 -1= -1 → E= -J*(-1) = J.

So wait, all the states except the two all-same have energy J?

So that gives:

Number of states with E = -3J: 2
Number of states with E = J: 6
Wait, but in the problem statement, J is a coupling constant. Wait, in the energy formula, E is given as -J [ ... ], so when the sum is positive, the energy is negative. So, if the sum is 3, E is -3J. If the sum is 1, E is -J. Sum is -1, E is J. Sum is -3, E is 3J.

Wait, wait a minute, earlier I thought that when the sum is -1, E is J. But in the calculation for state 2, E is J. But for state 1, the sum is 3, E is -3J.

Wait, but in state 2, the sum is -1, so E is (-J)*(-1) = J. So, yes, correct.

But looking at all the states:

Number of states where sum is 3: 2 (states 1 and 8)
Number of states where sum is -3: 2 (does any state have sum -3?) Wait no, in the states I listed, the sums were 3, -1, -1, etc. Let me double-check.

Wait, let me recalculate a few states.

For example, state 5: (-1,1,1). S1S2 = (-1)(1) = -1. S1S3 = (-1)(1)=-1. S2S3= (1)(1)=1. So sum = -1 + (-1) + 1 = -1 → E= J.

State 7: (-1, -1, 1). S1S2 = (+1), S1S3= (-1), S2S3= (-1). Sum is 1 -1 -1 = -1. E= J.

Wait, so all the other states (6 of them) have sum=-1, E=J.

But what about the sum being 1? I thought earlier that was possible, but in the 8 states, none have E=-J. Did I miss any state where the sum is 1?

Hmm, let's re-examine. Is there a state where the sum of the three pairs is +1?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the enumeration. Let me think: for three spins, how can t12 + t13 + t23 equal +1?

This would require two of the t_ij to be +1 and one to be -1.

For example, t12=1, t13=1, t23=-1. Let's see what this implies.

t12 = S1 S2 =1 → S1 = S2.

t13 = S1 S3 =1 → S3 = S1.

t23 = S2 S3 = -1 → S3 = - S2.

But from S1 = S2 and S3 = S1, S3 = S2. So t23 = S2 S3 = S2^2 =1. But that's +1, which contradicts t23 being -1. So this combination isn't possible.

Another possibility: t12=1, t13=-1, t23=1.

t12=1 → S1 = S2.

t13=-1→ S3 = -S1.

t23=1 → S2 = S3.

But from S1 = S2 and S3 = -S1, S3 = -S2. So t23 = S2 S3 = S2*(-S2) = -S2^2 = -1. But t23 is supposed to be 1. Contradiction again.

Hmm, perhaps it's impossible to have the sum be +1 or -3 in this setup. Wait, in the 8 states, the sum for each state is either 3 or -1. Wait, but earlier when I listed all the states, the sums were 3 (for state 1 and 8) and -1 for all others.

Wait, but that can't be, because when I calculated state 2, the sum was -1. So that suggests that the sum can be 3 or -1. So the possible energies are -3J (sum 3) and J (sum -1).

Wait, but wait, what about the sum being -3? Because that would require all t_ij to be -1.

t12=-1 → S1 = -S2.

t13=-1 → S1 = -S3.

t23=-1 → S2 = -S3.

So, from t12 and t13: S3 = S2. Then t23 = S2 * S3 = S2^2 =1. But in this scenario, t23 is supposed to be -1. So that's a contradiction. So it's impossible for all three t_ij to be -1. So the sum can't be -3. So the possible sums are 3 and -1. So possible energies are -3J and J.

Wait, but in the 8 states, when does the sum equal 3? Only states 1 and 8 have sum 3, giving E=-3J. The other 6 states have sum=-1, E=J.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-β E).

Each state contributes exp(-β E). So for the two states with E=-3J, each contributes exp(3βJ). For the six states with E=J, each contributes exp(-β J).

So Z = 2 exp(3β J) + 6 exp(-β J).

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check.

Option A: Z = 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ) → No, because E=-3J → exp(-β E) = exp(3J β), which is what I have.

Option B: Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → Yes, that's what I have.

So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any possibilities. Because in my initial approach, I thought the sum could be 3, 1, -1, -3, but in practice, the sums only came out to 3 or -1. So the possible energies are only -3J and J.

Therefore, the partition function is 2 e^{3β J} + 6 e^{-β J}.

To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), and the energy is given by \( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \), we proceed as follows:

### Key Observations:
1. **Energy Expression**: Each term \( S_iS_j \) can be \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), so the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \) can take the values \( 3, 1, -1, -3 \). Thus, the energy \( E \) can be \( -3J, -J, J, 3J \).

2. **Possible States**: There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible spin configurations. By enumerating all states, we find:
   - **States with \( E = -3J \):** These occur when all pairs \( S_iS_j = +1 \), which corresponds to the two states \( (+1, +1, +1) \) and \( (-1, -1, -1) \). Thus, there are \( N = 2 \) states with \( E = -3J \).
   - **States with \( E = J \):** These occur when the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 \), which corresponds to the remaining 6 states. Thus, there are \( N = 6 \) states with \( E = J \).

3. **Partition Function**: The partition function is given by:
   \[
   Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
   \]
   where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Substituting the energies:
   - For \( E = -3J \), the contribution is \( 2e^{3J\beta} \).
   - For \( E = J \), the contribution is \( 6e^{-J\beta} \).

   Therefore:
   \[
   Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
   \]

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) is incorrect because the signs of the exponents are reversed.
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) matches the derived expression.
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) is incorrect because the exponents are scaled incorrectly.
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) is also incorrect for the same reason.

### Final Answer:
The correct partition function is \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \).

Therefore, the energy E is -J multiplied by that sum. So E can be -J*(3), -J*(1), -J*(-1) = J, or -J*(-3) = 3J.

Wait, no. Let me correct that. If the sum is 3, then E = -J*3 = -3J. If the sum is 1, E = -J. If the sum is -1, E = J. If sum is -3, E = 3J.

Wait, but how does the sum of the three t_ij terms being 1 happen? Let's think. Suppose t12=1, t13=1, t23= -1. So sum is 1+1-1=1. But what's the condition for this?

2. (1,1,-1)
sum: 1*(1) =1, 1*(-1) =-1, 1*(-1)= -1. Sum= 1-1-1 =-1. E = -J*(-1) = J.

3. (1,-1,1)
sum: (1*-1) =-1, (1*1)=1, (-1*1)=-1. Sum = -1 +1 -1 =-1. E= J.

4. (1,-1,-1)
sum: (1*-1)=-1, (1*-1)=-1, (-1*-1)=1. Sum: -1 -1 +1 =-1. E= J.

5. (-1,1,1)

8. (-1,-1,-1)
sum: (-1*-1)=1, (-1*-1)=1, (-1*-1)=1. Sum=3. E= -3J.

Wait, so from this, states 1 and 8 have E= -3J. All the other 6 states have E= J. Oh, wait no: no, wait, in state 2, which is (1,1,-1), the sum was -1, but earlier I thought that sum was -1, giving E= J. Similarly, states 3 through 7 all have sum=-1, so E= J.

Wait, but when I calculated state 2: (1,1,-1), the sum was (1)(1) =1, (1)(-1)=-1, (1)(-1)=-1 → sum=1 -1 -1= -1 → E= -J*(-1) = J.

So wait, all the states except the two all-same have energy J?

So that gives:

Number of states with E = -3J: 2
Number of states with E = J: 6
Wait, but in the problem statement, J is a coupling constant. Wait, in the energy formula, E is given as -J [ ... ], so when the sum is positive, the energy is negative. So, if the sum is 3, E is -3J. If the sum is 1, E is -J. Sum is -1, E is J. Sum is -3, E is 3J.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-β E).

Each state contributes exp(-β E). So for the two states with E=-3J, each contributes exp(3βJ). For the six states with E=J, each contributes exp(-β J).

So Z = 2 exp(3β J) + 6 exp(-β J).

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check.

Option A: Z = 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ) → No, because E=-3J → exp(-β E) = exp(3J β), which is what I have.

Option B: Z=2 e^{3Jβ} +6 e^{-Jβ} → Yes, that's what I have.

So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any possibilities. Because in my initial approach, I thought the sum could be 3, 1, -1, -3, but in practice, the sums only came out to 3 or -1. So the possible energies are only -3J and J.

Therefore, the partition function is 2 e^{3β J} + 6 e^{-β J}.


To find the partition function \( Z \) for the system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), and the energy is given by \( E = -J(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3) \), we proceed as follows:

### Key Observations:
1. **Energy Expression**: Each term \( S_iS_j \) can be \( +1 \) or \( -1 \), so the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \) can take the values \( 3, 1, -1, -3 \). Thus, the energy \( E \) can be \( -3J, -J, J, 3J \).

2. **Possible States**: There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible spin configurations. By enumerating all states, we find:
   - **States with \( E = -3J \):** These occur when all pairs \( S_iS_j = +1 \), which corresponds to the two states \( (+1, +1, +1) \) and \( (-1, -1, -1) \). Thus, there are \( N = 2 \) states with \( E = -3J \).
   - **States with \( E = J \):** These occur when the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = -1 \), which corresponds to the remaining 6 states. Thus, there are \( N = 6 \) states with \( E = J \).

3. **Partition Function**: The partition function is given by:
   \[
   Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E},
   \]
   where \( \beta = 1/(kT) \). Substituting the energies:
   - For \( E = -3J \), the contribution is \( 2e^{3J\beta} \).
   - For \( E = J \), the contribution is \( 6e^{-J\beta} \).

   Therefore:
   \[
   Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
   \]

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) is incorrect because the signs of the exponents are reversed.
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) matches the derived expression.
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) is incorrect because the exponents are scaled incorrectly.
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) is also incorrect for the same reason.

### Final Answer:
