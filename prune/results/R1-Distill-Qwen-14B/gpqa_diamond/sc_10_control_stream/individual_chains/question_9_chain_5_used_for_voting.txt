Okay, so I've got this question about molecular symmetry, specifically which molecule has C3H symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules is all about the different operations that leave the molecule looking the same. C3H... wait, no, wait. Oh right, C3H is a type of symmetry called the cyclic group of order 3 with a horizontal mirror plane. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the notation. Let me think: Oh yeah, the notation for symmetry groups can be a bit tricky. C3H would mean a three-fold rotational axis combined with a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's a different type of symmetry element.

Wait, another way to think: The C3 refers to a three-fold rotation axis. H means a horizontal mirror plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotation and a mirror plane that's horizontal relative to that axis. Alternatively, sometimes the notation is a bit different, but I think that's the general idea.

So the question is, which of the given molecules has this symmetry. The options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. The options are labeled A to D.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. I remember that triisopropyl borate has a structure where boron is in the center, attached to three isopropyl groups. Isopropyl groups have a certain symmetry. So the molecule has a trigonal planar structure around boron. Wait, but does that give it three-fold symmetry? Each isopropyl group is symmetric, so maybe the molecule has a C3 axis. But is there a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, if the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane would be possible. Alternatively, maybe it's non-planar, like a trigonal pyramid? No, wait, triisopropyl borate is a planar molecule because the three isopropyl groups are around B in a trigonal planar arrangement. So it's symmetric. So would it have C3H symmetry? I'm not entirely sure, but I think it has C3 symmetry at least.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, a bridge structure. Its structure is like a cube with two substituents on adjacent corners. Wait, no, quinuclidine is actually a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure, which is a norbornane-like structure. So it has a bridge structure with three bridges of two carbons each. I think quinuclidine has a certain symmetry. Let me think about its rotation. It has a threefold rotation axis? I'm not so sure. I think norbornane derivatives have C2 symmetry or maybe C3. Wait, quinuclidine's structure: if the molecule has threefold symmetry, then rotating 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's D3h symmetry, which includes a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, no, D3h is a point group that includes a three-fold axis plus a horizontal mirror plane and other elements. But I think quinuclidine might not have that. Alternatively, perhaps it's C3v symmetry. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. I need to think more clearly.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize it. It's a trifuran system, meaning three fused furan rings? Or maybe it's a tricyclic system. The numbering suggests that. Alternatively, it could be a benzo-fused system with multiple furan rings. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the name benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran implies that there are three furan rings connected in a certain way. Wait, maybe it's a molecule where each of the three furan rings is connected in a way that creates a larger ring system. If the molecule is symmetric, perhaps it has a three-fold axis.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Hmm, so this is similar to option B but with a triphenylene group attached. Triphenylene is a tricyclic benzene system, I think. So perhaps this molecule has a more complex structure with three benzene rings fused into a structure that's symmetric. So maybe this has a higher symmetry, including a C3H group.

So, the question is which of these has C3H symmetry. Let me think about each structure again.

Triisopropyl borate (option C) has three identical isopropyl groups attached to a central boron atom. The molecule is trigonal planar, so it has a three-fold rotational axis (C3). Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane (H)? If the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane would be the same as a mirror plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. So, for a trigonal planar molecule, would that be the case? Wait, in planar molecules, the mirror planes are often present. For example, benzene has multiple mirror planes. So maybe triisopropyl borate, being planar, would have a horizontal mirror plane. So that would make the symmetry C3H or maybe D3h? Wait, because D3h includes the three-fold axis, the mirror planes, and the inversion. Hmm, but I'm not sure if triisopropyl borate has inversion symmetry. Alternatively, maybe it only has C3 symmetry because it's planar but not necessarily with the H plane. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Quinuclidine (option D) is a bridged bicyclic molecule. Its structure is like a cube corner. So, it has a three-dimensional structure. I think quinuclidine has C3 symmetry. How? Let me think. If you rotate it 120 degrees, does the structure look the same? Because the molecule has three equivalent bridge positions. Yes, I think it does have a three-fold axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, a horizontal plane would pass through the center. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry that is perpendicular to the three-fold axis, then yes. For quinuclidine, I think the structure is symmetric in such a way that it has a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, I remember that quinuclidine has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, so its symmetry group is C3h. So maybe option D is correct.

Wait, but I thought option C might have C3H as well. Let me think again. Triisopropyl borate: the molecule is trigonal planar, so rotating 120 degrees would leave it the same. So C3 is present. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? The mirror plane would have to be perpendicular to the C3 axis. So, for example, a plane that goes through the boron atom and bisects the opposite side. In a trigonal planar structure, like BF3, the molecule has three mirror planes, each through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side. So for triisopropyl borate, which is similar, if it's planar, it would have a horizontal mirror plane. So that would make it C3h symmetry. So both options C and D could have C3h symmetry? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, but quinuclidine is a non-planar molecule. It's a bicyclic structure. So, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? The mirror plane would cut through the molecule in a way that reflects it onto itself. For instance, in quinuclidine, the mirror plane would pass through the center and bisect the molecule into two halves. If the molecule is symmetrical in that way, then yes, it would have a horizontal mirror plane. So, quinuclidine has C3h symmetry. But does triisopropyl borate have a horizontal mirror plane? Since it's planar, it might have multiple mirror planes, including the horizontal one.

Wait, wait. The term 'horizontal' is relative. If the rotation axis is vertical (as in triisopropyl borate), then a horizontal mirror plane would be perpendicular to it. So, in triisopropyl borate, which is a trigonal planar molecule, the mirror planes are vertical, i.e., they pass through the B atom and a midpoint of each isopropyl group. So the mirror planes are vertical, not horizontal. So a horizontal mirror plane would be one that is perpendicular to the rotation axis, which for that molecule is the same as the vertical. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps a 'horizontal' mirror plane in the context of C3h refers to a plane that is perpendicular to the rotation axis, regardless of the molecule's orientation.

Wait, maybe I should think about the point groups. The C3h point group consists of a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒh). So a molecule with C3h symmetry has both a three-fold axis and a mirror plane that is perpendicular to it.

Triisopropyl borate: trigonal planar geometry. So, it has a three-fold axis (C3) and three vertical mirror planes. So it's in the D3h point group, which includes the C3 axis, the three vertical mirror planes, and a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, so D3h includes a horizontal mirror plane. So, if triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, then it's more than just C3h. Because C3h is a subgroup of D3h. So, if the molecule has both a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it's in the D3h group. But the question is about C3h symmetry, which is a lower symmetry. So, maybe triisopropyl borate has higher symmetry than C3h.

On the other hand, quinuclidine: I'm not sure about its point group. Quinuclidine's structure is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a norbornane-like structure. Wait, norbornane itself has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Because if you look down the three-fold axis, the structure is symmetric. So, norbornane (quinuclidine) has C3h symmetry. So, that would make option D correct.

But earlier I thought triisopropyl borate might have D3h symmetry, which would mean it has more symmetry elements than C3h, but the question is about C3h, so maybe it doesn't have that. Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate doesn't have any mirror planes, but that can't be right because it's planar.

Wait, no, triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule, so it must have mirror planes. For example, each isopropyl group is symmetric, so the molecule has three vertical mirror planes. So, in that case, it would have D3h symmetry, which includes the C3 axis, the three vertical mirrors, and the horizontal mirror plane. So the point group is D3h.

The question is about C3h symmetry. So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, does it also have C3h symmetry? Well, C3h is a subgroup of D3h. So any molecule with D3h symmetry would also have C3h symmetry. Wait, but the question is which has C3h symmetry. So both triisopropyl borate and quinuclidine would have C3h symmetry, but perhaps quinuclidine only has C3h and not higher symmetry.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the other options.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. The structure is a tricyclic system with three rings. The name suggests that benzo groups are fused with furan rings. So, perhaps the molecule is a tricyclic structure with three rings in a row. If this structure is symmetric, perhaps it has a three-fold axis. For example, if the three rings are arranged symmetrically, then a rotation of 120 degrees would leave it the same. But does it have a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is planar, but that's unlikely given the fused rings.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Triphenylene is a tricyclic benzene system, so attaching that to a trifuran might create a highly symmetric molecule. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule could have a three-fold axis. Also, perhaps it has a horizontal mirror plane. So this molecule might also have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm trying to figure out which among the options is correct. Let's consider each option's possible symmetry.

So, if the question is about which molecule has C3h symmetry, and given that:

- Option C: triisopropyl borate. It has a trigonal planar structure, so D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. So it does have C3h.

- Option D: quinuclidine. It has a bicyclo structure with three bridges. So, it's three-fold symmetric, and I think it has a horizontal mirror plane, so C3h.

But I'm not certain whether all the options are correct. Wait, the question provides four options, each as a separate choice, labeled A to D. The options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran...
B) benzo[...]trifuran...
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

Wait, the question asks which of the following has C3h symmetry. So, perhaps more than one option might have it, but the options are only A to D, each being a different molecule.

Wait, perhaps I should think about which of these molecules has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Triisopropyl borate (option C): 3-fold axis, and multiple mirror planes. So it's D3h, which includes C3h. So it must have C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine (option D): It's a bridged bicyclic structure. Does it have a three-fold axis and a mirror plane perpendicular to it? I'm pretty sure that it does. So it has C3h symmetry.

So both options C and D have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but that can't be right because the question is a multiple-choice with one correct answer. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the symmetry of triisopropyl borate. Let me think again. Triisopropyl borate has a planar structure, trigonal. So, it has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and three mirror planes (each passing through a B-O and the midpoint of the opposite isopropyl group). So, the point group is D3h, which definitely includes C3h symmetry. So option C has C3h.

Quinuclidine: I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about its structure. Quinuclidine is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. The structure has three bridges, each of two carbons. So, if you imagine looking down the three-fold axis, the molecule would appear symmetric with three equivalent positions. So, rotating 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Yes, because the molecule is symmetric across a plane that bisects the bridge. So it has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h.

So both options C and D have C3h. But the question lists only these four options. Wait, looking back, the options are labeled A, B, C, D as in the options given. So the answer options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]
B) benzo[...]
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

Wait, but the question is among these four, which has C3h. So, if both options C and D have C3h, then the question must have a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm incorrect in assuming both have it. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps in triisopropyl borate, the mirror planes are vertical relative to the C3 axis, so the horizontal mirror plane isn't present. Because, in a trigonal planar molecule, the mirror planes are the ones that pass through the B atom and bisect the opposite isopropyl groups. So these are vertical planes, not horizontal. So the horizontal mirror plane would be perpendicular to the C3 axis, which is pointing vertically. So a horizontal mirror plane would be in the plane of the molecule, which in this case is the same as the plane of the B and the three O atoms. Wait, but in that case, is there a horizontal mirror plane?

Hmm, perhaps triisopropyl borate doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane because the mirror planes are vertical. So, the horizontal plane would be the same as the plane of the molecule, which is a plane of symmetry. Wait, but that's not a mirror plane in the same way. Maybe the presence of a horizontal mirror plane is present as the plane of the molecule.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the terminology wrong. So, in the C3h point group, the molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, the horizontal mirror plane is sigma_h, which is perpendicular to the C3 axis.

In triisopropyl borate, if the mirror planes are vertical, then the horizontal plane (sigma_h) would be perpendicular to the C3 axis, which is vertical. So, if the molecule is in a plane, then sigma_h is the same as the plane itself. In that case, the molecule would have a mirror plane in its own plane, which is a horizontal mirror plane. So, triisopropyl borate would have sigma_h, the horizontal mirror plane, and the C3 axis. So, it would have C3h symmetry.

But wait, if the molecule lies in the horizontal plane (sigma_h), then any reflection across that plane would be a symmetry. So, in that case, the mirror plane is the same as the plane of the molecule. But in reality, the mirror planes of triisopropyl borate are the vertical planes, not the horizontal. So, perhaps it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane, but only vertical ones. Thus, it belongs to point group C3v instead of C3h.

Wait, that's a possibility. So, if the molecule has a three-fold axis and vertical mirror planes, then the point group is C3v. Because in C3v, the mirror planes are vertical, not horizontal. So, triisopropyl borate would have C3v symmetry, not C3h.

So, in that case, only quinuclidine would have C3h symmetry. Because quinuclidine has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, but I thought quinuclidine's mirror planes are not horizontal. Let me think again.

Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. So, it's a three-dimensional structure with three bridges. Let's imagine looking along the three-fold axis. The molecule would look like a triangle. Each bridge is equivalent. So, a rotation of 120 degrees would leave the molecule unchanged. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? A horizontal plane would be one that is perpendicular to the three-fold axis. So, for quinuclidine, if you slice it along a plane that bisects the molecule, you would see a mirror image on each side. Yes, I think that's correct. So, quinuclidine has C3h symmetry.

Meanwhile, triisopropyl borate has C3v symmetry because its mirror planes are vertical relative to the C3 axis. So, it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane.

So, the correct answer is option D: quinuclidine.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I'm not 100% confident about the mirror planes in triisopropyl borate. Let me do a quick mental check. In a trigonal planar molecule like BF3, the point group is D3h. So, BF3 has a horizontal mirror plane. Similarly, triisopropyl borate is similar, so it would have a horizontal mirror plane. So, then why did I think earlier that the mirror planes are vertical? Because in BF3, the mirror planes are vertical, but the horizontal plane (the plane of the molecule) is also a mirror plane, which would be the sigma_h.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The point group of BF3 is D3h, which includes a three-fold axis (C3), three vertical mirror planes (each containing the C atom and bisecting the opposite bond), and a horizontal mirror plane (sigma_h), which is perpendicular to the C3 axis and lies in the plane of the molecule.

So, in that case, triisopropyl borate would have a horizontal mirror plane. So, it would have C3h symmetry. Which would mean option C has C3h symmetry.

But wait, then quinuclidine may also have C3h.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps only quinuclidine has C3h symmetry, and triisopropyl borate has D3h.

Wait, the question is about which has C3h symmetry. If a molecule has D3h, does it have C3h? Because D3h is a higher symmetry group that includes C3h.

So, any molecule with D3h symmetry also has C3h symmetry. So, option C's molecule (triisopropyl borate) would have C3h symmetry.

But then, quinuclidine (option D) also has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I can't have two correct answers. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing quinuclidine's symmetry.

Let me try to think of quinuclidine's structure. It's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. So, three bridges each of two carbons. The molecule is symmetric. So, the three-fold axis passes through the bridgeheads, and each of the three bridges is equivalent. So, looking down the three-fold axis, it's a triangle.

Now, the mirror planes: any plane that passes through the center and a pair of opposite bridgeheads (if any). But since all bridgeheads are equivalent, perhaps the horizontal mirror plane is present. Alternatively, maybe the mirror planes are not present. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has a three-fold axis but no mirror planes, making it C3. But that doesn't make sense, because the structure is symmetric.

Another approach: Let me think about the number of symmetry elements. Quinuclidine has a three-fold axis, and perhaps a mirror plane that is perpendicular to it. But I'm not certain.

Wait, someone told me before that quinuclidine has a point group of C3h. So, perhaps it does.

But then, triisopropyl borate also has C3h. So, both options C and D have C3h, but the answer options are four, each as A, B, C, D.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at a different point group in each.

Wait, perhaps triphenyleno[...]trifuran (option A) has C3h symmetry. Let me consider that.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran. Triphenylene is a symmetric tricyclic benzene system, with three benzene rings fused together. When attached to a trifuran (three fused furan rings?), the symmetry could be higher. If the molecule is symmetric with three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane, then option A could have C3h.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps benzo[...]trifuran (option B) is less symmetric and lacks the C3h symmetry.

Wait, perhaps only one of the four options has C3h. I'm getting a bit confused, but I think the correct answer is option D: quinuclidine.

But earlier I thought that triisopropyl borate has C3h symmetry as part of D3h. So, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, I'm not confident, but perhaps the correct answer is option C: triisopropyl borate.

But then why is quinuclidine not correct? Because I thought quinuclidine has C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps neither has C3h. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me look for another approach.

Another approach: The problem is to find which molecule has C3h symmetry.

C3h symmetry implies a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

So, looking at each molecule:

- Triisopropyl borate: trigonal planar, so D3h symmetry. So it has C3h as a subgroup.

- Quinuclidine: bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. This has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So C3h symmetry.

So both options C and D have C3h. But wait, the options are given as four separate molecules, and the answer is among them.

Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken that triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry. Let me think again.

Wait, in the case of triisopropyl borate, the molecule is planar, so it lies in a plane. The three-fold rotation axis is perpendicular to this plane. The mirror planes for this molecule are three vertical planes (each passing through the B atom and the midpoint of each isopropyl group). So, the point group is D3h. So, it has a horizontal mirror plane (sigma_h) which is the same as the plane of the molecule.

So, if sigma_h is present, then the molecule has C3h symmetry (as part of D3h). Therefore, option C (triisopropyl borate) has C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine: as a three-dimensional molecule, has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So it also has C3h.

Wait, but the options are A, B, C, D. So, perhaps both C and D have C3h symmetry.

But the question says 'which of the following', implying only one correct answer.

Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong about one of them.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate does not have a horizontal mirror plane. Because the mirror planes are vertical, not horizontal. So, the horizontal plane would be the same as the plane of the molecule. So, reflection across this plane would leave the molecule unchanged. So, yes, it would have a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the mirror plane is the plane of the molecule, which is the sigma_h plane.

Therefore, both options C and D have C3h. But since the question is a multiple-choice, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the answer options. The options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]...

B) benzo[...]...

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

In that case, perhaps both C and D are correct. But since the options are given as four, and the answer is one letter, perhaps the intended answer is D) quinuclidine.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing quinuclidine's symmetry. Maybe quinuclidine has a different point group.

Wait, another approach: what is the structure of quinuclidine? It's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a norbornane-like structure. The point group for norbornane is C3v. Wait, but perhaps for quinuclidine, which is the saturated version, it's C3h.

Wait, norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, and its point group is C3h. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between bicyclo systems.

Wait, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane (quinuclidine) has three bridges, each of two carbons. So, the point group is C3h because it has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the point group is C3v.

Wait, I think I need to look for another way. Maybe the correct answer is option D, quinuclidine, as it's known for having a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

To determine which molecule has **Câ‚ƒH** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structures and symmetry elements. **Câ‚ƒH** symmetry refers to the presence of a three-fold rotational axis (Câ‚ƒ) and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒáµ£) perpendicular to the Câ‚ƒ axis.

### Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a triphenylene group fused with a trifuran system. While it may have some symmetry due to the fused rings, its structure is complex, and it does not clearly exhibit a three-fold rotational axis or a horizontal mirror plane. Thus, it does not have **Câ‚ƒH** symmetry.

### Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule is a benzo-fused trifuran system. The fusion creates a tricyclic structure, but the symmetry is not sufficient to support a three-fold rotational axis or a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it does not have **Câ‚ƒH** symmetry.

### Option C: triisopropyl borate  
Triisopropyl borate is a planar molecule with a trigonal planar geometry. It has a three-fold rotational axis (Câ‚ƒ) and multiple vertical mirror planes. However, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒáµ£) perpendicular to the Câ‚ƒ axis. Instead, its point group is **Dâ‚ƒh**, which includes **Câ‚ƒh** as a subgroup. Since the question specifically asks for **Câ‚ƒH** symmetry, this molecule satisfies the criteria.

### Option D: quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure. It has a three-fold rotational axis (Câ‚ƒ) and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒáµ£) perpendicular to the Câ‚ƒ axis. This makes it a classic example of a molecule with **Câ‚ƒH** symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Both **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) and **quinuclidine** (Option D) have **Câ‚ƒH** symmetry. However, since the question implies a single correct answer, **quinuclidine** is the most definitive choice due to its clear three-dimensional **Câ‚ƒH** symmetry.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this question about molecular symmetry, specifically which molecule has C3H symmetry. Hmm, I remember that symmetry in molecules is all about the different operations that leave the molecule looking the same. C3H... wait, no, wait. Oh right, C3H is a type of symmetry called the cyclic group of order 3 with a horizontal mirror plane. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing up the notation. Let me think: Oh yeah, the notation for symmetry groups can be a bit tricky. C3H would mean a three-fold rotational axis combined with a horizontal mirror plane. Alternatively, maybe it's a different type of symmetry element.

Wait, another way to think: The C3 refers to a three-fold rotation axis. H means a horizontal mirror plane that's perpendicular to the rotation axis. So the molecule should have a three-fold rotation and a mirror plane that's horizontal relative to that axis. Alternatively, sometimes the notation is a bit different, but I think that's the general idea.

So the question is, which of the given molecules has this symmetry. The options are four molecules: triisopropyl borate, quinuclidine, benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone, and triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. The options are labeled A to D.

Let me look at each option one by one.

Option C is triisopropyl borate. I remember that triisopropyl borate has a structure where boron is in the center, attached to three isopropyl groups. Isopropyl groups have a certain symmetry. So the molecule has a trigonal planar structure around boron. Wait, but does that give it three-fold symmetry? Each isopropyl group is symmetric, so maybe the molecule has a C3 axis. But is there a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, if the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane would be possible. Alternatively, maybe it's non-planar, like a trigonal pyramid? No, wait, triisopropyl borate is a planar molecule because the three isopropyl groups are around B in a trigonal planar arrangement. So it's symmetric. So would it have C3H symmetry? I'm not entirely sure, but I think it has C3 symmetry at least.

Option D is quinuclidine. Quinuclidine is a bicyclic molecule, a bridge structure. Its structure is like a cube with two substituents on adjacent corners. Wait, no, quinuclidine is actually a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure, which is a norbornane-like structure. So it has a bridge structure with three bridges of two carbons each. I think quinuclidine has a certain symmetry. Let me think about its rotation. It has a threefold rotation axis? I'm not so sure. I think norbornane derivatives have C2 symmetry or maybe C3. Wait, quinuclidine's structure: if the molecule has threefold symmetry, then rotating 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's D3h symmetry, which includes a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, no, D3h is a point group that includes a three-fold axis plus a horizontal mirror plane and other elements. But I think quinuclidine might not have that. Alternatively, perhaps it's C3v symmetry. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. I need to think more clearly.

Option B is benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. Wait, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize it. It's a trifuran system, meaning three fused furan rings? Or maybe it's a tricyclic system. The numbering suggests that. Alternatively, it could be a benzo-fused system with multiple furan rings. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the name benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran implies that there are three furan rings connected in a certain way. Wait, maybe it's a molecule where each of the three furan rings is connected in a way that creates a larger ring system. If the molecule is symmetric, perhaps it has a three-fold axis.

Option A is triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Hmm, so this is similar to option B but with a triphenylene group attached. Triphenylene is a tricyclic benzene system, I think. So perhaps this molecule has a more complex structure with three benzene rings fused into a structure that's symmetric. So maybe this has a higher symmetry, including a C3H group.

So, the question is which of these has C3H symmetry. Let me think about each structure again.

Triisopropyl borate (option C) has three identical isopropyl groups attached to a central boron atom. The molecule is trigonal planar, so it has a three-fold rotational axis (C3). Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane (H)? If the molecule is planar, then a horizontal mirror plane would be the same as a mirror plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. So, for a trigonal planar molecule, would that be the case? Wait, in planar molecules, the mirror planes are often present. For example, benzene has multiple mirror planes. So maybe triisopropyl borate, being planar, would have a horizontal mirror plane. So that would make the symmetry C3H or maybe D3h? Wait, because D3h includes the three-fold axis, the mirror planes, and the inversion. Hmm, but I'm not sure if triisopropyl borate has inversion symmetry. Alternatively, maybe it only has C3 symmetry because it's planar but not necessarily with the H plane. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Quinuclidine (option D) is a bridged bicyclic molecule. Its structure is like a cube corner. So, it has a three-dimensional structure. I think quinuclidine has C3 symmetry. How? Let me think. If you rotate it 120 degrees, does the structure look the same? Because the molecule has three equivalent bridge positions. Yes, I think it does have a three-fold axis. But does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Hmm, a horizontal plane would pass through the center. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry that is perpendicular to the three-fold axis, then yes. For quinuclidine, I think the structure is symmetric in such a way that it has a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, I remember that quinuclidine has a C3 axis and a horizontal mirror plane, so its symmetry group is C3h. So maybe option D is correct.

Wait, but I thought option C might have C3H as well. Let me think again. Triisopropyl borate: the molecule is trigonal planar, so rotating 120 degrees would leave it the same. So C3 is present. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? The mirror plane would have to be perpendicular to the C3 axis. So, for example, a plane that goes through the boron atom and bisects the opposite side. In a trigonal planar structure, like BF3, the molecule has three mirror planes, each through a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side. So for triisopropyl borate, which is similar, if it's planar, it would have a horizontal mirror plane. So that would make it C3h symmetry. So both options C and D could have C3h symmetry? Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, but quinuclidine is a non-planar molecule. It's a bicyclic structure. So, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? The mirror plane would cut through the molecule in a way that reflects it onto itself. For instance, in quinuclidine, the mirror plane would pass through the center and bisect the molecule into two halves. If the molecule is symmetrical in that way, then yes, it would have a horizontal mirror plane. So, quinuclidine has C3h symmetry. But does triisopropyl borate have a horizontal mirror plane? Since it's planar, it might have multiple mirror planes, including the horizontal one.

Wait, wait. The term 'horizontal' is relative. If the rotation axis is vertical (as in triisopropyl borate), then a horizontal mirror plane would be perpendicular to it. So, in triisopropyl borate, which is a trigonal planar molecule, the mirror planes are vertical, i.e., they pass through the B atom and a midpoint of each isopropyl group. So the mirror planes are vertical, not horizontal. So a horizontal mirror plane would be one that is perpendicular to the rotation axis, which for that molecule is the same as the vertical. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps a 'horizontal' mirror plane in the context of C3h refers to a plane that is perpendicular to the rotation axis, regardless of the molecule's orientation.

Wait, maybe I should think about the point groups. The C3h point group consists of a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒh). So a molecule with C3h symmetry has both a three-fold axis and a mirror plane that is perpendicular to it.

Triisopropyl borate: trigonal planar geometry. So, it has a three-fold axis (C3) and three vertical mirror planes. So it's in the D3h point group, which includes the C3 axis, the three vertical mirror planes, and a horizontal mirror plane. Wait, so D3h includes a horizontal mirror plane. So, if triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry, then it's more than just C3h. Because C3h is a subgroup of D3h. So, if the molecule has both a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, then it's in the D3h group. But the question is about C3h symmetry, which is a lower symmetry. So, maybe triisopropyl borate has higher symmetry than C3h.

On the other hand, quinuclidine: I'm not sure about its point group. Quinuclidine's structure is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a norbornane-like structure. Wait, norbornane itself has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. Because if you look down the three-fold axis, the structure is symmetric. So, norbornane (quinuclidine) has C3h symmetry. So, that would make option D correct.

But earlier I thought triisopropyl borate might have D3h symmetry, which would mean it has more symmetry elements than C3h, but the question is about C3h, so maybe it doesn't have that. Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate doesn't have any mirror planes, but that can't be right because it's planar.

Wait, no, triisopropyl borate is a trigonal planar molecule, so it must have mirror planes. For example, each isopropyl group is symmetric, so the molecule has three vertical mirror planes. So, in that case, it would have D3h symmetry, which includes the C3 axis, the three vertical mirrors, and the horizontal mirror plane. So the point group is D3h.

The question is about C3h symmetry. So if a molecule has D3h symmetry, does it also have C3h symmetry? Well, C3h is a subgroup of D3h. So any molecule with D3h symmetry would also have C3h symmetry. Wait, but the question is which has C3h symmetry. So both triisopropyl borate and quinuclidine would have C3h symmetry, but perhaps quinuclidine only has C3h and not higher symmetry.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the other options.

Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone. The structure is a tricyclic system with three rings. The name suggests that benzo groups are fused with furan rings. So, perhaps the molecule is a tricyclic structure with three rings in a row. If this structure is symmetric, perhaps it has a three-fold axis. For example, if the three rings are arranged symmetrically, then a rotation of 120 degrees would leave it the same. But does it have a mirror plane perpendicular to that axis? I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the molecule is planar, but that's unlikely given the fused rings.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone. Triphenylene is a tricyclic benzene system, so attaching that to a trifuran might create a highly symmetric molecule. If the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule could have a three-fold axis. Also, perhaps it has a horizontal mirror plane. So this molecule might also have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I'm trying to figure out which among the options is correct. Let's consider each option's possible symmetry.

So, if the question is about which molecule has C3h symmetry, and given that:

- Option C: triisopropyl borate. It has a trigonal planar structure, so D3h symmetry, which includes C3h. So it does have C3h.

- Option D: quinuclidine. It has a bicyclo structure with three bridges. So, it's three-fold symmetric, and I think it has a horizontal mirror plane, so C3h.

But I'm not certain whether all the options are correct. Wait, the question provides four options, each as a separate choice, labeled A to D. The options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]trifuran...
B) benzo[...]trifuran...
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

Wait, the question asks which of the following has C3h symmetry. So, perhaps more than one option might have it, but the options are only A to D, each being a different molecule.

Wait, perhaps I should think about which of these molecules has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Triisopropyl borate (option C): 3-fold axis, and multiple mirror planes. So it's D3h, which includes C3h. So it must have C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine (option D): It's a bridged bicyclic structure. Does it have a three-fold axis and a mirror plane perpendicular to it? I'm pretty sure that it does. So it has C3h symmetry.

So both options C and D have C3h symmetry.

Wait, but that can't be right because the question is a multiple-choice with one correct answer. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the symmetry of triisopropyl borate. Let me think again. Triisopropyl borate has a planar structure, trigonal. So, it has a three-fold rotation axis (C3) and three mirror planes (each passing through a B-O and the midpoint of the opposite isopropyl group). So, the point group is D3h, which definitely includes C3h symmetry. So option C has C3h.

Quinuclidine: I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about its structure. Quinuclidine is bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. The structure has three bridges, each of two carbons. So, if you imagine looking down the three-fold axis, the molecule would appear symmetric with three equivalent positions. So, rotating 120 degrees would map the molecule onto itself. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? Yes, because the molecule is symmetric across a plane that bisects the bridge. So it has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane, making it C3h.

So both options C and D have C3h. But the question lists only these four options. Wait, looking back, the options are labeled A, B, C, D as in the options given. So the answer options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]
B) benzo[...]
C) triisopropyl borate
D) quinuclidine

Wait, but the question is among these four, which has C3h. So, if both options C and D have C3h, then the question must have a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm incorrect in assuming both have it. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps in triisopropyl borate, the mirror planes are vertical relative to the C3 axis, so the horizontal mirror plane isn't present. Because, in a trigonal planar molecule, the mirror planes are the ones that pass through the B atom and bisect the opposite isopropyl groups. So these are vertical planes, not horizontal. So the horizontal mirror plane would be perpendicular to the C3 axis, which is pointing vertically. So a horizontal mirror plane would be in the plane of the molecule, which in this case is the same as the plane of the B and the three O atoms. Wait, but in that case, is there a horizontal mirror plane?

Hmm, perhaps triisopropyl borate doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane because the mirror planes are vertical. So, the horizontal plane would be the same as the plane of the molecule, which is a plane of symmetry. Wait, but that's not a mirror plane in the same way. Maybe the presence of a horizontal mirror plane is present as the plane of the molecule.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the terminology wrong. So, in the C3h point group, the molecule has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So, the horizontal mirror plane is sigma_h, which is perpendicular to the C3 axis.

In triisopropyl borate, if the mirror planes are vertical, then the horizontal plane (sigma_h) would be perpendicular to the C3 axis, which is vertical. So, if the molecule is in a plane, then sigma_h is the same as the plane itself. In that case, the molecule would have a mirror plane in its own plane, which is a horizontal mirror plane. So, triisopropyl borate would have sigma_h, the horizontal mirror plane, and the C3 axis. So, it would have C3h symmetry.

But wait, if the molecule lies in the horizontal plane (sigma_h), then any reflection across that plane would be a symmetry. So, in that case, the mirror plane is the same as the plane of the molecule. But in reality, the mirror planes of triisopropyl borate are the vertical planes, not the horizontal. So, perhaps it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane, but only vertical ones. Thus, it belongs to point group C3v instead of C3h.

Wait, that's a possibility. So, if the molecule has a three-fold axis and vertical mirror planes, then the point group is C3v. Because in C3v, the mirror planes are vertical, not horizontal. So, triisopropyl borate would have C3v symmetry, not C3h.

So, in that case, only quinuclidine would have C3h symmetry. Because quinuclidine has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

Wait, but I thought quinuclidine's mirror planes are not horizontal. Let me think again.

Quinuclidine's structure is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. So, it's a three-dimensional structure with three bridges. Let's imagine looking along the three-fold axis. The molecule would look like a triangle. Each bridge is equivalent. So, a rotation of 120 degrees would leave the molecule unchanged. Now, does it have a horizontal mirror plane? A horizontal plane would be one that is perpendicular to the three-fold axis. So, for quinuclidine, if you slice it along a plane that bisects the molecule, you would see a mirror image on each side. Yes, I think that's correct. So, quinuclidine has C3h symmetry.

Meanwhile, triisopropyl borate has C3v symmetry because its mirror planes are vertical relative to the C3 axis. So, it doesn't have a horizontal mirror plane.

So, the correct answer is option D: quinuclidine.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because I'm not 100% confident about the mirror planes in triisopropyl borate. Let me do a quick mental check. In a trigonal planar molecule like BF3, the point group is D3h. So, BF3 has a horizontal mirror plane. Similarly, triisopropyl borate is similar, so it would have a horizontal mirror plane. So, then why did I think earlier that the mirror planes are vertical? Because in BF3, the mirror planes are vertical, but the horizontal plane (the plane of the molecule) is also a mirror plane, which would be the sigma_h.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The point group of BF3 is D3h, which includes a three-fold axis (C3), three vertical mirror planes (each containing the C atom and bisecting the opposite bond), and a horizontal mirror plane (sigma_h), which is perpendicular to the C3 axis and lies in the plane of the molecule.

So, in that case, triisopropyl borate would have a horizontal mirror plane. So, it would have C3h symmetry. Which would mean option C has C3h symmetry.

But wait, then quinuclidine may also have C3h.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps only quinuclidine has C3h symmetry, and triisopropyl borate has D3h.

Wait, the question is about which has C3h symmetry. If a molecule has D3h, does it have C3h? Because D3h is a higher symmetry group that includes C3h.

So, any molecule with D3h symmetry also has C3h symmetry. So, option C's molecule (triisopropyl borate) would have C3h symmetry.

But then, quinuclidine (option D) also has C3h symmetry.

Wait, but I can't have two correct answers. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing quinuclidine's symmetry.

Let me try to think of quinuclidine's structure. It's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. So, three bridges each of two carbons. The molecule is symmetric. So, the three-fold axis passes through the bridgeheads, and each of the three bridges is equivalent. So, looking down the three-fold axis, it's a triangle.

Now, the mirror planes: any plane that passes through the center and a pair of opposite bridgeheads (if any). But since all bridgeheads are equivalent, perhaps the horizontal mirror plane is present. Alternatively, maybe the mirror planes are not present. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps quinuclidine has a three-fold axis but no mirror planes, making it C3. But that doesn't make sense, because the structure is symmetric.

Another approach: Let me think about the number of symmetry elements. Quinuclidine has a three-fold axis, and perhaps a mirror plane that is perpendicular to it. But I'm not certain.

Wait, someone told me before that quinuclidine has a point group of C3h. So, perhaps it does.

But then, triisopropyl borate also has C3h. So, both options C and D have C3h, but the answer options are four, each as A, B, C, D.

Wait, perhaps I'm looking at a different point group in each.

Wait, perhaps triphenyleno[...]trifuran (option A) has C3h symmetry. Let me consider that.

Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran. Triphenylene is a symmetric tricyclic benzene system, with three benzene rings fused together. When attached to a trifuran (three fused furan rings?), the symmetry could be higher. If the molecule is symmetric with three-fold rotation and a horizontal mirror plane, then option A could have C3h.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps benzo[...]trifuran (option B) is less symmetric and lacks the C3h symmetry.

Wait, perhaps only one of the four options has C3h. I'm getting a bit confused, but I think the correct answer is option D: quinuclidine.

But earlier I thought that triisopropyl borate has C3h symmetry as part of D3h. So, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, I'm not confident, but perhaps the correct answer is option C: triisopropyl borate.

But then why is quinuclidine not correct? Because I thought quinuclidine has C3h.

Alternatively, perhaps neither has C3h. Let me think again.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck. Let me look for another approach.

Another approach: The problem is to find which molecule has C3h symmetry.

C3h symmetry implies a three-fold rotation axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

So, looking at each molecule:

- Triisopropyl borate: trigonal planar, so D3h symmetry. So it has C3h as a subgroup.

- Quinuclidine: bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. This has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So C3h symmetry.

So both options C and D have C3h. But wait, the options are given as four separate molecules, and the answer is among them.

Wait, perhaps I'm mistaken that triisopropyl borate has D3h symmetry. Let me think again.

Wait, in the case of triisopropyl borate, the molecule is planar, so it lies in a plane. The three-fold rotation axis is perpendicular to this plane. The mirror planes for this molecule are three vertical planes (each passing through the B atom and the midpoint of each isopropyl group). So, the point group is D3h. So, it has a horizontal mirror plane (sigma_h) which is the same as the plane of the molecule.

So, if sigma_h is present, then the molecule has C3h symmetry (as part of D3h). Therefore, option C (triisopropyl borate) has C3h symmetry.

Quinuclidine: as a three-dimensional molecule, has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane. So it also has C3h.

Wait, but the options are A, B, C, D. So, perhaps both C and D have C3h symmetry.

But the question says 'which of the following', implying only one correct answer.

Hmm, perhaps I'm wrong about one of them.

Alternatively, perhaps triisopropyl borate does not have a horizontal mirror plane. Because the mirror planes are vertical, not horizontal. So, the horizontal plane would be the same as the plane of the molecule. So, reflection across this plane would leave the molecule unchanged. So, yes, it would have a horizontal mirror plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the mirror plane is the plane of the molecule, which is the sigma_h plane.

Therefore, both options C and D have C3h. But since the question is a multiple-choice, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the answer options. The options are:

A) triphenyleno[...]...

B) benzo[...]...

C) triisopropyl borate

D) quinuclidine

In that case, perhaps both C and D are correct. But since the options are given as four, and the answer is one letter, perhaps the intended answer is D) quinuclidine.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing quinuclidine's symmetry. Maybe quinuclidine has a different point group.

Wait, another approach: what is the structure of quinuclidine? It's a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, which is a norbornane-like structure. The point group for norbornane is C3v. Wait, but perhaps for quinuclidine, which is the saturated version, it's C3h.

Wait, norbornane is bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, and its point group is C3h. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between bicyclo systems.

Wait, bicyclo[2.2.2]octane (quinuclidine) has three bridges, each of two carbons. So, the point group is C3h because it has a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the point group is C3v.

Wait, I think I need to look for another way. Maybe the correct answer is option D, quinuclidine, as it's known for having a three-fold axis and a horizontal mirror plane.


To determine which molecule has **Câ‚ƒH** symmetry, we analyze the given options based on their structures and symmetry elements. **Câ‚ƒH** symmetry refers to the presence of a three-fold rotational axis (Câ‚ƒ) and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒáµ£) perpendicular to the Câ‚ƒ axis.

### Option A: triphenyleno[1,2-c:5,6-c':9,10-c'']trifuran-1,3,6,8,11,13-hexaone  
This molecule consists of a triphenylene group fused with a trifuran system. While it may have some symmetry due to the fused rings, its structure is complex, and it does not clearly exhibit a three-fold rotational axis or a horizontal mirror plane. Thus, it does not have **Câ‚ƒH** symmetry.

### Option B: benzo[1,2-c:3,4-c':5,6-c'']trifuran-1,3,4,6,7,9-hexaone  
This molecule is a benzo-fused trifuran system. The fusion creates a tricyclic structure, but the symmetry is not sufficient to support a three-fold rotational axis or a horizontal mirror plane. Therefore, it does not have **Câ‚ƒH** symmetry.

### Option C: triisopropyl borate  
Triisopropyl borate is a planar molecule with a trigonal planar geometry. It has a three-fold rotational axis (Câ‚ƒ) and multiple vertical mirror planes. However, it does not have a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒáµ£) perpendicular to the Câ‚ƒ axis. Instead, its point group is **Dâ‚ƒh**, which includes **Câ‚ƒh** as a subgroup. Since the question specifically asks for **Câ‚ƒH** symmetry, this molecule satisfies the criteria.

### Option D: quinuclidine  
Quinuclidine is a bicyclo[2.2.2]octane structure. It has a three-fold rotational axis (Câ‚ƒ) and a horizontal mirror plane (Ïƒáµ£) perpendicular to the Câ‚ƒ axis. This makes it a classic example of a molecule with **Câ‚ƒH** symmetry.

### Conclusion  
Both **triisopropyl borate** (Option C) and **quinuclidine** (Option D) have **Câ‚ƒH** symmetry. However, since the question implies a single correct answer, **quinuclidine** is the most definitive choice due to its clear three-dimensional **Câ‚ƒH** symmetry.

**Answer: D**
