Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism, and I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question lists four organic moieties and asks which of them show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations of the four compounds.

Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. These are also called enantiomers. For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center, or some other form of asymmetry, like a planar chirality. Oh right, like in allenes or certain cyclopropane structures, but I think the common case is a chiral center.

So, I need to check each compound one by one to see if any have a chiral center or another source of chirality.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
Wait, biphenyl rings connected at 1,1' positions. The substituents are on the 2 and 6 positions of each ring. Let me visualize it. The structure is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Each ring has a nitro group at 6' and 6, and a carboxylate at 2 and 2'. So each benzene ring has two substituents: one nitro and one carboxylate methyl ester.

Wait, but how do the substituents arrange on the biphenyl? So for each ring, the 2-position is one substituent (the ester) and the 6 is a nitro group. Since the biphenyl is connected at 1 and 1', each ring's substituents are on positions that are para to each other.

But does this create any chiral centers? Hmm. Wait, the substituents on each benzene ring are in specific positions. Let me think about the possibility of the molecule having a plane of symmetry. If the two rings are connected in a way that makes the molecule symmetric, then maybe it doesn't have a chiral center. Alternatively, if the substituents create an asymmetric center.

Wait, wait. The molecule has two methyl ester groups on the 2 positions, but each ring also has a nitro group on the 6. So each ring has two substituents: one nitro and one ester. Since biphenyls can have different conformations, but in terms of structural isomerism, is there a possibility of the molecule being chiral?

Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is about the molecule's ability to rotate plane-polarized light. So the molecule must have a chiral center or another form of chirality.

In this case, the molecule is a biphenyl with substituents at 2,2' and 6,6'. Wait, could the central bond (the single bond connecting the two rings) allow for free rotation or not? Because if the rings can rotate freely, then the arrangement of substituents might not be fixed, which could lead to different isomers.

But if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. Let me imagine the structure. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate at position 2. So, the substituents on each ring are in the para position relative to the connecting bond.

Wait, but each ring has two substituents, but none on the same ring that would lead to a chiral center. The chiral center would be a carbon attached to four different groups.

Wait, but the substituents on the benzene rings are not on the same carbon. The carbons attached to the rings are part of the aromatic rings, which are spÂ² hybridized, not chiral centers. So, unless the molecule has some other form of stereochemistry, like a stereogenic center elsewhere.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement of the substituents on the biphenyl leads to axial chirality. Biphenyls can have axial chirality if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, for biphenyls to have axial chirality, the substituents should be in positions that prevent free rotation, like if there are bulky groups that make rotation difficult. But in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring, which are para positions. So the molecule might have a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule lacks symmetry, then it could be chiral. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. If both rings have the same substituents, the molecule would be symmetrical, and thus not chiral. But in this case, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate ester group. So each ring is identical in terms of substituents. So the molecule is symmetrical, and thus not chiral. So maybe compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. The substituents are on 2 and 6 positions. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Since the two rings are connected in a way that the substituents are symmetric, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Hmm. So I think compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Let me draw the structure. Propanoate would be CH2CH2COO- but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, the structure is CH3-C(OH)(CH3)-COOCH3? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH(COOH)2? No, wait.

Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. But as an ester, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, but wait that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of the propanoate ester.

Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. Wait, but that can't be because the propanoate has three carbons. So the structure would be:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3 ? No, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- as in, the carbonyl is on C3, then C2, C1.

2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on C2, so the structure is:

O
|
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2-C-OH ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

The ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. As an ester, it would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the structure. The molecule is:

The ester is OMe-O-C-O-C. So the propanoate would have three carbons: the first CH3, the second CH(OH), the third COOCH3.

Wait, no, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-.

Wait, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Now, does this molecule have a chiral center?

Looking at the hydroxyl-bearing carbon (the second carbon): what are the four substituents attached? Let's see. The carbon is attached to:

1. OH group,
2. CH2- group (which is connected to the next carbon, which is the COOCH3),
3. another CH2 (the first carbon, CH3),
4. and the rest?

Wait, wait. Let me number the carbons. The ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C-OH
|
CH3

Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO^- as the acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COO^- as the acid is HOCH2CH2COOH.

So as an ester, it's HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- OH,
- CH2CH2COOCH3 (Wait, no, that's the rest of the chain.)

Wait, the structure is CH3CH2COOCH3 is methyl propanoate. But with a hydroxyl on the middle carbon.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me properly draw the structure.

Propanoate is:

O
||
O-C-O-R (where R is methyl)

The propanoate ion is CH2CH2COO^-.

So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a hydroxyl on the middle carbon, so the structure is:

HO-CH2-COO^- connected to a methyl group (as ester).

Wait, no. Wait, the ester is formed from the acid and an alcohol. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol.

So the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no. Let's think of the acid: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon is the one attached to the hydroxyl. Let's check the substituents on that carbon.

Carbon 2 (the one with the OH):

- Two CH2 groups? Wait, no.

Wait, the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Wait, no, the chain is:

The first carbon is CH2(OH), the second is CH2 connected to the COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me number the carbons from the COOCH3 group. The COOCH3 is on the third carbon. So:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, no, the ester is formed from the acid, so the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the carbons are:

1: CH2(OH)

2: CH2-

3: COOCH3

Wait, then the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:

- CH2(OH) group (left side),
- CH2-COOCH3 (right side),
- two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

So the middle carbon (CH2) is attached to:

- HO-CH2- on one side,
- CH2-COOCH3 on the other.

Wait, but that carbon is CH2, which is connected to two CH2 groups, an OH, and a CH2COOCH3. But wait, that's not four different groups. So the middle carbon is attached to:

Group 1: -CH2OH (left),
Group 2: -CH2COOCH3 (right),
Group 3: two H's?

Wait, no. The middle carbon is CH2, so it's connected to two CH2 groups, an OH, and a CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, that's not possible. Let me think again.

Wait, the correct structure: the molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Or no, wait. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of it as:

The ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is three carbons, with the COO- group on the third carbon. So the structure would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one in the middle of the chain) is the second carbon. So:

- Attached groups: one OH, one CH2COOCH3, two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. Let me think of the second carbon as having four substituents.

Wait, the second carbon is CH2. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
Carbon 2: CH2 connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, but Carbon 2 would have two CH2 groups attached? No, that can't be. I'm getting myself tangled, perhaps I should try to imagine the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the structure as:

The ester is from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The formula would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, that's another possibility. Because propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxy would be CH(OH)CH2COOH. As an ester, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure would be:

COOCH3 is on the third carbon. The second carbon has an OH group and is attached to the first and third carbons. So the structure is:

CH2CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, but that would make the second carbon (with OH) attached to:

- Two CH2 groups? No, perhaps not. Let me write it as:

The second carbon has:

- One OH,
- One CH2- (from the first carbon),
- One CH2COOCH3 (from the third carbon),
- And one H.

Wait, no, because that would be four substituents.

Wait, the second carbon is CH(OH), so attached to:

- OH,
- CH2 (from first carbon, which is CH3),
- CH2COOCH3 (from third carbon),
- and another H.

Wait no, let me think again. The structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the second carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

1. CH3 (from the first carbon),
2. OH,
3. COOCH3 (from the third carbon),
4. and a H.

Wait, no. Because the second carbon is CH(OH), so it's connected to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and a single H.

So four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Oh wait, that's four different groups attached to the same carbon! So that carbon is a chiral center. So this molecule has a chiral center, so it can have enantiomers. Therefore, compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone.

Benzophenone is (phenyl)2CO. So the structure is Ph-CO-Ph. Does this have any chiral centers? No, because the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two phenyl groups. So the structure is Ar-C(=O)-Ar.

Wait, the central carbon is C=O, so it's a carbonyl group. The carbon is double-bonded to O, and attached to two phenyl groups and another phenyl? No, wait, benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, so the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

Wait, that's two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the carbonyl carbon has a double bond to O and two phenyl groups, and another substituent? Wait, no. The structure is:

Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

So the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and double-bonded to O. It doesn't have four substituents; it has three: two Ph and one O. So it's not a chiral center. Are there any other chiral centers in benzophenone? No, because the molecule is symmetrical around the carbonyl group. So benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate.

Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid with methanol.

The structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait no, wait fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two double bonds in the trans configuration. So the structure is trans-dioic acid.

So dimethyl fumarate would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Fumarate is the di-ester. So the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2CH2-CO2H, but wait no. Wait, maleic acid is HO2C-CHCH-CO2H with the double bond in the cis (Z) configuration. Fumaric acid is the trans (E) diacid. So the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH? No, no. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but with the double bond in the trans configuration. So the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the dimethyl ester would replace each -OH of the carboxylic acid with OCH3, so each COOH becomes COOCH3.

So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3, but wait, no. Wait, the correct structure is:

The diacid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H? No, that can't be. No, wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So when esterified with methanol, it becomes MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct that. The structure is dimethyl fumarate as MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. So the two ester groups (COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, does this molecule exhibit optical isomerism?

Well, the molecule has a double bond with substituents on either end. The substituents are the two methyl ester groups (COOCH3) and two hydrogen atoms.

Wait, but in fumarate, the substituents on either end of the double bond are the same. Each end has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group? No, wait, actually, each end of the double bond is a CH and a COOCH3.

Wait, no. Let me think of the structure again. The double bond is between the two middle carbons. Each of those carbons has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group? No, wait. Let me number the carbons:

The molecule is:

COOCH3 - C = C - COOCH3.

But wait, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3)? No, no. Wait, no, fumarate is:

The structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, that can't be right. I think I'm mixing up fumaric acid and maleic acid.

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, but that's succinic acid. No, wait, but I'm getting confused with the structures.

Let me get this straight. Maleic acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid: HOOC-CHCH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on the same side. Fumaric acid is the (E)-isomer, so the two COOH groups are on opposite sides.

So when esterified with methanol, dimethyl fumarate is formed: MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Let's look for a chiral center.

Wait, the double bond in dimethyl fumarate is between two carbons, each of which has two substituents: one COOCH3 and one CH2 group.

Wait, no, the structure is:

The double bond is between C2 and C3.

Each of those carbons (C2 and C3) is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group,
- One CH2 group (from C1 and C4, which are both CH2 groups? No, wait, the structure is:

The molecule is:

CH2(COOMe) - CH2 - CH2 - COOMe.

No, that's not right. Wait, no. The correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe.

Each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So each of those carbons is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- two CH groups (since it's a double bond, each carbon is CH with the double bond),
- and another substituent.

Wait, no, each of the double-bond carbons has two substituents besides the double bond. Let me write it as:

COOCH3
|
C = C
|
COOCH3

But that's not correct because each double bond carbon would have only one substituent. Wait, perhaps each double bond carbon has two substituents: one COOCH3 and one H.

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think again. The structure is:

CH2(COOCH3) is connected via double bond to CH2(COOCH3), but that can't be right because that would make it a single bond. Hmm.

Wait, the correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that can't be right. I think I'm getting stuck here, perhaps I should approach this differently.

In any case, the question is whether dimethyl fumarate exhibits optical isomerism. Optical isomerism arises when a molecule has a chiral center or a plane of asymmetry leading to enantiomers.

Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with substituents on either side. If the substituents on each end are the same, then the molecule may not be chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are different, it could lead to chirality.

In dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group? No, perhaps each end has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Wait, but in the trans configuration, would that lead to a plane of symmetry?

Wait, in the trans configuration, the substituents on either side of the double bond are on opposite sides. But if each substituent is the same (COOCH3 on both ends), then the molecule may have a plane of symmetry. For example, if it's symmetric, then it's not chiral.

Wait, in the structure of dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So the molecule is symmetric with respect to the double bond. Therefore, it doesn't have a chiral center and is achiral, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

But wait, wait. Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C = C
|
COOCH3

No, that's not possible because that would imply each C in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and nothing else, which isn't possible. Each carbon in the double bond must have two other substituents besides the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond between the two CH2s. No, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps the structure is (COOCH3)CH2-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should think about the possibility of a plane of symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't have optical isomerism.

In dimethyl fumarate, since both ends are identical (each has a COOCH3 group), the molecule is symmetrical. So even though the substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond, the molecule as a whole is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Wait, but wait. Fumarate is an E diastereomer. That is, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But if the substituents on each end are the same, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. For example, if the structure is symmetric, then it would not have optical isomerism.

But wait, another possibility: if the molecule has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. So, in dimethyl fumarate, since each substituent on the double bond is the same (COOCH3), the molecule is symmetrical. So, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about another example. For instance, maleic anhydride is (Z) and has a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. Fumaric acid (E) doesn't have a plane of symmetry, so it is chiral. Wait, wait, no. Fumaric acid is chiral because it lacks a plane of symmetry. Wait, but wait, I might be getting this wrong.

No, wait, fumaric acid has two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule is symmetrical in terms of the substituents, but the overall structure may not have a plane of symmetry. Wait, let me imagine the structure:

         O
         ||
O   O=C-OCH3
 \ /
  C=C
 / \
O   O=C-OCH3
         O

No, that can't be right because the substituents are on opposite sides. So the molecule isn't symmetrical and thus can have enantiomers. Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on each end are the same (COOCH3), so the molecule has a center of symmetry. Wait, no, because the configuration is E, the substituents are trans, but the molecule is still symmetrical along the plane perpendicular to the double bond. So the molecule is achiral, meaning no optical isomerism.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the substituents are the same, then the molecule would be symmetrical, so it's not chiral.

Wait, but fumaric acid is a meso compound? Or not? Let me think. No, fumaric acid is not a meso compound. Because in fumaric acid, the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, but the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. Let me think about the structure of fumaric acid. It's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the substituents on opposite sides. So, the structure is symmetrical across the center. So, it has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Wait, that's not correct. Because if the substituents are on opposite sides, the molecule is symmetric, so it's not chiral.

Wait, but if you have a molecule like (E)-butenedioic acid, it's symmetrical. Because flipping it over would result in the same structure. So it's not chiral. So dimethyl fumarate (the ester) would also be symmetrical and not chiral.

Wait, but wait. That would mean that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism. But I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents on each end are different. Wait, no, both are COOCH3, so they are same. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry.

So, in conclusion, dimethyl fumarate (compound 4) does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Let me think of another example. For instance, maleic anhydride is (Z) and has a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. Fumaric acid (E) doesn't have a plane of symmetry, so it's chiral. Or wait, no. If the substituents are the same, then E or Z would not affect the symmetry. Wait, in the E configuration, each substituent is opposite, but if they are same, the molecule is symmetric.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up things. So, if the substituents on each end of a double bond are identical, then the molecule is symmetric and not chiral. So, in dimethyl fumarate, since both substituents on each end are COOCH3, the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, it's not chiral and doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, summarizing each compound:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: No chiral centers, symmetric. No optical isomerism.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Has a chiral center. Yes, optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone: No chiral centers, symmetric. No optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: Symmetrical due to same substituents on each end. No optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2.

Wait, but the options given are:

Options:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Wait, wait, this can't be right. Because according to my analysis, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me reevaluate.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate.

If the structure is (E)-dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans isomer, then does it have a plane of symmetry?

If the substituents on each end are same (both COOCH3), then the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the center of the double bond. So, it's not chiral.

But wait, if a molecule has a double bond with same groups on each side but in trans configuration, it's not chiral because the molecule is symmetrical.

So, dimethyl fumarate is not chiral. Therefore, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. The options are:

A) 1, 2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

Wait, so according to my analysis, only 2 is correct. But none of the options have only 2. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

Wait, what if the substituents on each end are different. For example, if the structure is CH2(COOCH3) and CH(CH2COOCH3), but that's not the case for fumarate. Fumarate has the same groups on each end.

Wait, so maybe I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think of another approach. Are there any other possibilities where a molecule can exhibit optical isomerism without a chiral center? Like in allenes or cyclopropane rings, but I think in this case, the relevant point is chiral centers.

Wait, another possibility: maybe in compound 1, there's some axial chirality, like in biphenyl compounds. Let me reconsider compound 1.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is a biphenyl (two benzene rings connected by a single bond) with substituents at 2 and 2' (each has a methyl ester of a carboxylate group) and at 6 and 6' (nitro groups).

So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. The two rings are connected at 1 and 1'.

So, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Are these positions para to each other?

Yes, because on each benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are para.

So, each ring has two para-substituents: a nitro and a carboxylate.

Now, can this molecule have axial chirality? Axial chirality refers to the chirality arising from the rotation around the central bond in a biaryl system. For the biaryl to exhibit axial chirality, the substituents on each ring must be arranged in a way that makes the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image.

In biphenyl systems, when the substituents on each ring are in positions that are not symmetrical across the central bond, the molecule can have axial chirality.

In this case, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 (para positions). So, looking at the molecule, the substituents on each ring are in the same positions relative to the central bond.

Wait, but looking from the top, each ring is symmetric. So, if the substituents on each ring are in the same positions (same substituents in the same positions), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

But wait, in this case, the substituents on each ring are both nitro and carboxylate. So, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate in para positions. So, the arrangement on each ring is the same. Therefore, the entire molecule is symmetrical across the central bond. Thus, it's achiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, so that brings me back. So, according to this, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A (1,2,4), option D (1,2), option C (2,3), and option A also has 4.

Wait, but according to my analysis, only 2 is correct, but none of the options have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in assessing one or more compounds.

Let me think about compound 4 again. Perhaps I was wrong.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl fumarate, which is a trans diastereomer. But does it have any chirality?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure again. Dimethyl fumarate has the structure:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

Wait, that's not correct because each C in the double bond must have two substituents besides the double bond. So the correct structure is:

Each C in the double bond has two substituents. So the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me think again. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

(CH2(COOCH3))2C=C(CH2(COOCH3))2? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups.

Wait, no. Fumarate is the trans (E) diacid, so the di-ester would have the same structure but with ester groups instead of COOH.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

But with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but with the substituents on opposite sides.

Wait, that's not correct because if it's a double bond, each carbon is CH, not CH2.

Ah! I think I was making a mistake earlier. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

So each of the two central carbons (in the double bond) is attached to one COOCH3 group and one H. So the structure is:

COOCH3-C=C-COOCH3, but with substituents on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans).

Wait, no, in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on each end are the same (COOCH3), and the double bond is between two CH groups.

In this case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the substituents are in the trans (E) configuration. Because each substituent is mirrored on the other side.

Wait, but if the substituents are in the trans configuration, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, that brings me back. Only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is A (1,2,4), D (1,2), C (2,3), and A includes 4 which I think doesn't.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think about it again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6.

If each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, then each ring's substituents are para to each other.

Now, the question is whether the molecule has any chiral centers or axial chirality.

In biphenyl systems, if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it can exhibit axial chirality.

In this case, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, each ring's substituents are in para positions.

But looking at the entire molecule, the two rings are connected at 1 and 1', so the substituents are arranged symmetrically. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, so only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But according to the options, none of the options have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing one of the compounds.

Wait, looking back at the question. Maybe I misread one of the compounds. Let me check again.

Wait, the compounds are:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

3. benzophenone.

4. dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl fumarate, which is also known as the trans isomer.

In the case of (E)-dimethyl fumarate, does it have any chiral centers? No, because each substituent on the double bond is the same. But wait, if the substituents are same, the molecule can't be chiral. So, no.

Wait, but what if the molecule is a meso compound? For example, something like meso-tartaric acid, which is achiral despite having stereocenters because of an internal plane of symmetry.

But in this case, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have stereocenters because of the double bond; it's a trans di-substituted compound.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for another approach. Which of these compounds have a chiral center?

Only compound 2 has a chiral center. So, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

So, the answer would be only 2 is correct. But looking back at the options:

The options are:

A) 1,2 and 4

B)3 and4

C) 2 and3

D)1 and2

So, none of the options have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think about the possibility of compound 4 having a chiral center.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate has the structure where each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. No chiral centers, but what about the double bond? No, double bonds with same substituents on each end don't contribute to chirality.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again. Could compound 1 have axial chirality?

In biphenyl systems, substituents can lead to axial chirality when the substituents are in such positions that they break symmetry.

In this case, each ring has two substituents: nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. So, each ring's substituents are in para positions.

But considering the arrangement, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no.

Wait, what if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry? For example, if the substituents on each ring are not symmetric.

But in this case, each ring has the same substituents in para positions, so the entire molecule is symmetric.

Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, I'm back to the conclusion that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But since the options don't include this, maybe I made a mistake in the assessment of compound 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound. But wait, a meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.

Wait, but dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any stereocenters. It's a diastereomer, but not a chiral compound.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility that compound 4 can have geometric isomerism but not optical isomerism. Because geometric isomerism (E/Z) doesn't imply optical activity. Only compounds with chirality (enantiomers) exhibit optical isomerism.

So, I think I'm confident that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

Looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A (1,2,4) and D (1 and 2), but I think 1 is not correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2.

The biphenyl is connected at 1 and 1'. So, each ring has substituents in the 2 and 6 positions, which are para.

Now, considering the biphenyl structure, the two rings are connected by a single bond, allowing rotation. Unless the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral.

In this case, each ring's substituents are symmetrically placed, so the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, it's not chiral.

So, back to only compound 2.

But the options don't have an option with only 2. So, perhaps the question is considering other possibilities.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think about the possibility of diastereomers and enantiomers.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl fumarate. But I'm thinking about whether it can have optical isomerism. I think not.

So, perhaps the correct answer is only compound 2, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again.

Another possibility: if the substituents on the biphenyl are such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it can have axial chirality.

In this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, the positions are such that on each ring, the substituents are in the para positions relative to the connecting bond.

But considering the three-dimensional arrangement, perhaps the molecule can have axial chirality, making it chiral.

Wait, but in that case, the substituents on each ring would be arranged in such a way that their positions relative to each other create a lack of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are on the same side of the ring, leading to a chiral arrangement.

But I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is meso, meaning it has stereocenters but is achiral.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has two nitro groups and two ester groups arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetrical, so not chiral.

I think I'm stuck, but based on my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But since the options don't include that, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2

So, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis of compound 1. Let me think again.

If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. For example, if on each ring, the nitro and carboxylate are on opposite sides.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para. So, if the rings are connected at 1 and 1', then the substituents are arranged such that each ring's substituents are in the same orientation relative to the central bond.

So, if both rings have the same arrangement, the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry. But I can't visualize it; perhaps it's better to think that compound 1 is not chiral.

So, given all that, I think I'll conclude that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism, but since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake and should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl fumarate. So, its structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

But wait, each C in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two H's. So, each C is attached to two identical groups, so no chiral centers. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, I'm confident that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But in the options, the only option that includes 2 is A (1,2,4), D (1 and 2), and C (2 and 3). None of these are correct if only 2 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound 4. Let me think again. Maybe dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center.

Wait, no, the structure doesn't have any chiral centers. Each C in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two H's. So, no.

Hmm. Well, perhaps I should proceed with the conclusion that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism, but since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1,2,4.

But I think that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again.

If the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

For example, if one ring has a nitro group in a certain position and the other ring has it in a different position, leading to asymmetry.

Wait, but in compound 1, both rings have nitro groups at 6 and carboxylate at 2. So, each ring is identical in terms of substituents, making the molecule symmetrical.

Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, perhaps the correct answer is only compound 2, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound 4. Let me think about the possibility of substituents leading to a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is not as I thought. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe dimethyl fumarate is not (COOCH3)2C=C(COOCH3)2. No, that's not possible. The correct structure is (COOCH3)CH2-CH2(COOCH3) but with a double bond.

Wait, no, that would make it a single bond. So, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond between the middle two CH2 groups.

Wait, but that would make the substituents on each end of the double bond different, leading to possible chirality.

Wait, that's a different structure. So, if the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond between the second and third CH2 groups, then each end of the double bond would have a CH2(COOCH3) group on one end and a CH2CH2(COOCH3) group on the other, which are different.

Wait, but that would make the substituents on each end different, leading to a possibility of a chiral center. But wait, each C in the double bond would have two CH2 groups attached, so no chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the structure again.

The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid's di-ester. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

But each C in the double bond is attached to one COOCH3 and one H.

So, each C in the double bond has two substituents: COOCH3 and H. So, each C is CH, not CH2. So, each C is attached to two H's and a COOCH3.

So, each C has two H's, which are identical, and one COOCH3. So, each C is attached to three groups: COOCH3 and two H's. Thus, they are not chiral centers because they have two identical substituents (the H's).

Therefore, no chiral centers in compound 4.

So, I'm confident that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But the options don't include that, so perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4), but I think that is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 1.

Wait, another angle: perhaps compound 1 is a meso compound. But I don't think so.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since none of the options have that, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. Maybe dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center.

Wait, no. The structure I described doesn't have any chiral centers.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let's say that compound 1 has axial chirality due to the substituents arrangement.

In biphenyl compounds, axial chirality occurs when the substituents on each ring are not symmetrical. For example, if the substituents are on the same side, the molecule can have axial chirality.

In compound 1, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, if the substituents on each ring are on the same side relative to the central bond, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, that's possible. Let me visualize this.

If the two nitro groups are on the same side of the biphenyl, and the two carboxylate groups are on the same side, then the arrangement might lack symmetry.

Wait, but in that case, each substituent is in the same position relative to their respective rings, which could create a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are not aligned in the same way, the molecule could lack symmetry.

But without knowing the exact spatial arrangement, it's hard to say.

But given that each ring has the same substituents in the same positions, I think the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl fumarate. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

In this structure, each C in the double bond has two substituents: COOCH3 and H. So, each C is CH, not CH2.

But in this case, each C is attached to two H's and one COOCH3 group. So, each C is CH, and there are two identical substituents (H's), meaning no chiral centers.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate (compound 4) doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the only correct option is compound 2.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound 2.

Wait, compound 2 is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, earlier I thought that the middle carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH2OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- two H's.

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think again.

The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The propanoate ester is formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol.

The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So, the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Now, looking at the C(OH): the substituents are:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- two H's.

Wait, no, the C(OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and another CH2 group? No, it's a secondary carbon.

Wait, no, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, the middle carbon (C2) has:

- CH3 (from C1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from C3),
- and another H.

So, four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. All four are different. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and capable of optical isomerism.

So, yes, compound 2 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the correct answer must be option A, which includes 1,2,4. But I don't think 1 and 4 exhibit optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a double bond that's not symmetric, making it chiral.

Wait, but if each substituent on the double bond is the same, then the molecule is symmetric and not chiral.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the answer is option A.

But based on my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which arises when a molecule has a non-superimposable mirror image. Chirality typically occurs due to a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality in certain systems like biphenyls.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions, with nitro groups at 6 and 6' and carboxylate ester groups at 2 and 2'. Each ring has substituents in para positions, and the molecule is symmetric due to the identical substituents on both rings. This symmetry prevents chirality, so no optical isomerism is observed.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The carbon atom at the second position (C2) is bonded to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and has identical substituents (two phenyl groups), making it achiral. No optical isomerism is observed.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure (COOCH3)-C=C-(COOCH3) in the trans (E) configuration. Each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical groups (COOCH3 and H), preventing the formation of a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. No optical isomerism is observed.

### Conclusion:
Among the four compounds, only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2)** exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center. None of the other compounds (1, 3, or 4) are chiral or exhibit optical isomerism.

However, none of the provided options include only compound 2. Based on the analysis, the most reasonable answer is **option A (1, 2, and 4)**, even though compounds 1 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about optical isomerism, and I'm a bit rusty on my organic chemistry, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question lists four organic moieties and asks which of them show optical isomerism. The options are A, B, C, D, each with different combinations of the four compounds.

Hmm, optical isomerism has to do with molecules that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. These are also called enantiomers. For a molecule to have optical isomerism, it must have a chiral center, or some other form of asymmetry, like a planar chirality. Oh right, like in allenes or certain cyclopropane structures, but I think the common case is a chiral center.

So, I need to check each compound one by one to see if any have a chiral center or another source of chirality.

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.
Wait, biphenyl rings connected at 1,1' positions. The substituents are on the 2 and 6 positions of each ring. Let me visualize it. The structure is two benzene rings connected by a single bond. Each ring has a nitro group at 6' and 6, and a carboxylate at 2 and 2'. So each benzene ring has two substituents: one nitro and one carboxylate methyl ester.

Wait, but how do the substituents arrange on the biphenyl? So for each ring, the 2-position is one substituent (the ester) and the 6 is a nitro group. Since the biphenyl is connected at 1 and 1', each ring's substituents are on positions that are para to each other.

But does this create any chiral centers? Hmm. Wait, the substituents on each benzene ring are in specific positions. Let me think about the possibility of the molecule having a plane of symmetry. If the two rings are connected in a way that makes the molecule symmetric, then maybe it doesn't have a chiral center. Alternatively, if the substituents create an asymmetric center.

Wait, wait. The molecule has two methyl ester groups on the 2 positions, but each ring also has a nitro group on the 6. So each ring has two substituents: one nitro and one ester. Since biphenyls can have different conformations, but in terms of structural isomerism, is there a possibility of the molecule being chiral?

Wait, but the question is about optical isomerism, which is about the molecule's ability to rotate plane-polarized light. So the molecule must have a chiral center or another form of chirality.

In this case, the molecule is a biphenyl with substituents at 2,2' and 6,6'. Wait, could the central bond (the single bond connecting the two rings) allow for free rotation or not? Because if the rings can rotate freely, then the arrangement of substituents might not be fixed, which could lead to different isomers.

But if the substituents are in such a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. Let me imagine the structure. Each ring has a nitro group at position 6 and a carboxylate at position 2. So, the substituents on each ring are in the para position relative to the connecting bond.

Wait, but each ring has two substituents, but none on the same ring that would lead to a chiral center. The chiral center would be a carbon attached to four different groups.

Wait, but the substituents on the benzene rings are not on the same carbon. The carbons attached to the rings are part of the aromatic rings, which are spÂ² hybridized, not chiral centers. So, unless the molecule has some other form of stereochemistry, like a stereogenic center elsewhere.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the arrangement of the substituents on the biphenyl leads to axial chirality. Biphenyls can have axial chirality if the substituents are arranged in a way that makes the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image. But I'm not sure about that.

Wait, for biphenyls to have axial chirality, the substituents should be in positions that prevent free rotation, like if there are bulky groups that make rotation difficult. But in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6 positions on each ring, which are para positions. So the molecule might have a plane of symmetry through the central bond, making it achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are arranged such that the molecule lacks symmetry, then it could be chiral. But I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. If both rings have the same substituents, the molecule would be symmetrical, and thus not chiral. But in this case, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate ester group. So each ring is identical in terms of substituents. So the molecule is symmetrical, and thus not chiral. So maybe compound 1 doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but wait. The substituents are on 2 and 6 positions. So each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. Since the two rings are connected in a way that the substituents are symmetric, perhaps the molecule is symmetrical. Hmm. So I think compound 1 doesn't have optical isomerism.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

Let me draw the structure. Propanoate would be CH2CH2COO- but wait, 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, the structure is CH3-C(OH)(CH3)-COOCH3? No, wait. Propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH(COOH)2? No, wait.

Wait, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. 2-hydroxypropanoic acid would be HOCH2CH2COOH. But as an ester, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COOCH3. Wait, but wait that can't be right. Alternatively, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, 2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on the second carbon of the propanoate ester.

Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxy would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-. Wait, but that can't be because the propanoate has three carbons. So the structure would be:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3 ? No, wait. Propanoate is CH2CH2COO- as in, the carbonyl is on C3, then C2, C1.

2-hydroxypropanoate would have the hydroxyl on C2, so the structure is:

O
|
O-CO-OCH3
|
CH2-C-OH ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to write it as:

The ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate, so the acid is 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The structure would be CH2(OH)CH2COOH. As an ester, it would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's think about the structure. The molecule is:

The ester is OMe-O-C-O-C. So the propanoate would have three carbons: the first CH3, the second CH(OH), the third COOCH3.

Wait, no, propanoate is CH2CH2COO-. So 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH2(OH)CH2COO-.

Wait, the structure is:

CH2(OH)-CH2-COOCH3.

Now, does this molecule have a chiral center?

Looking at the hydroxyl-bearing carbon (the second carbon): what are the four substituents attached? Let's see. The carbon is attached to:

1. OH group,
2. CH2- group (which is connected to the next carbon, which is the COOCH3),
3. another CH2 (the first carbon, CH3),
4. and the rest?

Wait, wait. Let me number the carbons. The ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-C-OH
|
CH3

Wait, no. Wait, propanoate is CH3CH2COO^- as the acid is CH3CH2COOH. So the 2-hydroxypropanoate would be HOCH2CH2COO^- as the acid is HOCH2CH2COOH.

So as an ester, it's HOCH2CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the second carbon) is attached to:

- OH,
- CH2CH2COOCH3 (Wait, no, that's the rest of the chain.)

Wait, the structure is CH3CH2COOCH3 is methyl propanoate. But with a hydroxyl on the middle carbon.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me properly draw the structure.

Propanoate is:

O
||
O-C-O-R (where R is methyl)

The propanoate ion is CH2CH2COO^-.

So 2-hydroxypropanoate would have a hydroxyl on the middle carbon, so the structure is:

HO-CH2-COO^- connected to a methyl group (as ester).

Wait, no. Wait, the ester is formed from the acid and an alcohol. So methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be the ester of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol.

So the structure is:

CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no. Let's think of the acid: 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH2(OH)CH2COOH. The ester would be CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon is the one attached to the hydroxyl. Let's check the substituents on that carbon.

Carbon 2 (the one with the OH):

- Two CH2 groups? Wait, no.

Wait, the structure is:

CH2(OH) - CH2 - COOCH3.

Wait, no, the chain is:

The first carbon is CH2(OH), the second is CH2 connected to the COOCH3.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the numbering wrong. Let me number the carbons from the COOCH3 group. The COOCH3 is on the third carbon. So:

Carbon 1: CH3-

Carbon 2: CH2-

Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, no, the ester is formed from the acid, so the structure is:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the carbons are:

1: CH2(OH)

2: CH2-

3: COOCH3

Wait, then the central carbon (carbon 2) is attached to:

- CH2(OH) group (left side),
- CH2-COOCH3 (right side),
- two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is:

HO-CH2-CH2-COOCH3.

So the middle carbon (CH2) is attached to:

- HO-CH2- on one side,
- CH2-COOCH3 on the other.

Wait, but that carbon is CH2, which is connected to two CH2 groups, an OH, and a CH2COOCH3. But wait, that's not four different groups. So the middle carbon is attached to:

Group 1: -CH2OH (left),
Group 2: -CH2COOCH3 (right),
Group 3: two H's?

Wait, no. The middle carbon is CH2, so it's connected to two CH2 groups, an OH, and a CH2COOCH3. Wait, no, that's not possible. Let me think again.

Wait, the correct structure: the molecule is CH3CH(OH)COOCH3? Or no, wait. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of it as:

The ester is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. Propanoate is three carbons, with the COO- group on the third carbon. So the structure would be:

CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the central carbon (the one in the middle of the chain) is the second carbon. So:

- Attached groups: one OH, one CH2COOCH3, two CH2 groups?

Wait, no. Let me think of the second carbon as having four substituents.

Wait, the second carbon is CH2. So the structure is:

Carbon 1: CH2(OH)
Carbon 2: CH2 connected to Carbon 1 and Carbon 3
Carbon 3: COOCH3

Wait, but Carbon 2 would have two CH2 groups attached? No, that can't be. I'm getting myself tangled, perhaps I should try to imagine the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the structure as:

The ester is from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid. The formula would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3. Wait, that's another possibility. Because propanoic acid is CH2CH2COOH, so 2-hydroxy would be CH(OH)CH2COOH. As an ester, methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate would be CH(OH)CH2COOCH3.

So the structure would be:

COOCH3 is on the third carbon. The second carbon has an OH group and is attached to the first and third carbons. So the structure is:

CH2CH(OH)COOCH3.

Wait, but that would make the second carbon (with OH) attached to:

- Two CH2 groups? No, perhaps not. Let me write it as:

The second carbon has:

- One OH,
- One CH2- (from the first carbon),
- One CH2COOCH3 (from the third carbon),
- And one H.

Wait, no, because that would be four substituents.

Wait, the second carbon is CH(OH), so attached to:

- OH,
- CH2 (from first carbon, which is CH3),
- CH2COOCH3 (from third carbon),
- and another H.

Wait no, let me think again. The structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

So the second carbon (the one with OH) is attached to:

1. CH3 (from the first carbon),
2. OH,
3. COOCH3 (from the third carbon),
4. and a H.

Wait, no. Because the second carbon is CH(OH), so it's connected to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and a single H.

So four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. Oh wait, that's four different groups attached to the same carbon! So that carbon is a chiral center. So this molecule has a chiral center, so it can have enantiomers. Therefore, compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone.

Benzophenone is (phenyl)2CO. So the structure is Ph-CO-Ph. Does this have any chiral centers? No, because the central carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and attached to two phenyl groups. So the structure is Ar-C(=O)-Ar.

Wait, the central carbon is C=O, so it's a carbonyl group. The carbon is double-bonded to O, and attached to two phenyl groups and another phenyl? No, wait, benzophenone is (Ph)2CO, so the structure is Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

Wait, that's two phenyl groups attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the carbonyl carbon has a double bond to O and two phenyl groups, and another substituent? Wait, no. The structure is:

Ph-C(=O)-Ph.

So the carbonyl carbon is connected to two phenyl groups and double-bonded to O. It doesn't have four substituents; it has three: two Ph and one O. So it's not a chiral center. Are there any other chiral centers in benzophenone? No, because the molecule is symmetrical around the carbonyl group. So benzophenone doesn't have any chiral centers and thus doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate.

Fumaric acid is a diastereomer of maleic acid. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid. So dimethyl fumarate is the di-ester of fumaric acid with methanol.

The structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH, but wait no, wait fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, with the two double bonds in the trans configuration. So the structure is trans-dioic acid.

So dimethyl fumarate would be:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

Wait, no, that's not right. Fumarate is the di-ester. So the structure is:

CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, wait. Fumaric acid is HO2C-CH2CH2-CO2H, but wait no. Wait, maleic acid is HO2C-CHCH-CO2H with the double bond in the cis (Z) configuration. Fumaric acid is the trans (E) diacid. So the structure of fumaric acid is HOOC-CH2CH2-COOH? No, no. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, fumaric acid is HOOC-CH=CH-COOH, but with the double bond in the trans configuration. So the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond.

So the dimethyl ester would replace each -OH of the carboxylic acid with OCH3, so each COOH becomes COOCH3.

So the structure is CH2=C(COOCH3)-COOCH3, but wait, no. Wait, the correct structure is:

The diacid is HO2C-CH2-CH2-CO2H? No, that can't be. No, wait, fumaric acid is HO2C-CH=CH-CO2H, with the two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So when esterified with methanol, it becomes MeO2C-CH=CH-CO2Me.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me correct that. The structure is dimethyl fumarate as MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe. So the two ester groups (COOCH3) are on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, does this molecule exhibit optical isomerism?

Well, the molecule has a double bond with substituents on either end. The substituents are the two methyl ester groups (COOCH3) and two hydrogen atoms.

Wait, but in fumarate, the substituents on either end of the double bond are the same. Each end has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group? No, wait, actually, each end of the double bond is a CH and a COOCH3.

Wait, no. Let me think of the structure again. The double bond is between the two middle carbons. Each of those carbons has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group? No, wait. Let me number the carbons:

The molecule is:

COOCH3 - C = C - COOCH3.

But wait, the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3)? No, no. Wait, no, fumarate is:

The structure is O=C(OCH3)-CH2-CH2-C(O)OCH3? No, that can't be right. I think I'm mixing up fumaric acid and maleic acid.

Wait, no. Fumaric acid is (E)-butenedioic acid, so the structure is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH? No, wait, no. Wait, but that's succinic acid. No, wait, but I'm getting confused with the structures.

Let me get this straight. Maleic acid is (Z)-butenedioic acid: HOOC-CHCH-COOH, with the two COOH groups on the same side. Fumaric acid is the (E)-isomer, so the two COOH groups are on opposite sides.

So when esterified with methanol, dimethyl fumarate is formed: MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe, with the two ester groups on opposite sides of the double bond.

Now, does this molecule have any chiral centers? Let's look for a chiral center.

Wait, the double bond in dimethyl fumarate is between two carbons, each of which has two substituents: one COOCH3 and one CH2 group.

Wait, no, the structure is:

The double bond is between C2 and C3.

Each of those carbons (C2 and C3) is attached to:

- One COOCH3 group,
- One CH2 group (from C1 and C4, which are both CH2 groups? No, wait, the structure is:

The molecule is:

CH2(COOMe) - CH2 - CH2 - COOMe.

No, that's not right. Wait, no. The correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is MeOOC-CH=CH-COOMe.

Each of the central carbons (the ones in the double bond) has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group. So each of those carbons is attached to:

- COOCH3,
- two CH groups (since it's a double bond, each carbon is CH with the double bond),
- and another substituent.

Wait, no, each of the double-bond carbons has two substituents besides the double bond. Let me write it as:

COOCH3
|
C = C
|
COOCH3

But that's not correct because each double bond carbon would have only one substituent. Wait, perhaps each double bond carbon has two substituents: one COOCH3 and one H.

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think again. The structure is:

CH2(COOCH3) is connected via double bond to CH2(COOCH3), but that can't be right because that would make it a single bond. Hmm.

Wait, the correct structure for dimethyl fumarate is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

No, that can't be right. I think I'm getting stuck here, perhaps I should approach this differently.

In any case, the question is whether dimethyl fumarate exhibits optical isomerism. Optical isomerism arises when a molecule has a chiral center or a plane of asymmetry leading to enantiomers.

Dimethyl fumarate has a double bond with substituents on either side. If the substituents on each end are the same, then the molecule may not be chiral. Alternatively, if the substituents are different, it could lead to chirality.

In dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group and a CH2 group? No, perhaps each end has a COOCH3 and a CH2 group. Wait, but in the trans configuration, would that lead to a plane of symmetry?

Wait, in the trans configuration, the substituents on either side of the double bond are on opposite sides. But if each substituent is the same (COOCH3 on both ends), then the molecule may have a plane of symmetry. For example, if it's symmetric, then it's not chiral.

Wait, in the structure of dimethyl fumarate, each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. So the molecule is symmetric with respect to the double bond. Therefore, it doesn't have a chiral center and is achiral, so it doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

But wait, wait. Wait, in dimethyl fumarate, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C = C
|
COOCH3

No, that's not possible because that would imply each C in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and nothing else, which isn't possible. Each carbon in the double bond must have two other substituents besides the double bond.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So it's CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond between the two CH2s. No, that's not correct. Wait, perhaps the structure is (COOCH3)CH2-CH2(COOCH3), but with a double bond.

Wait, I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should think about the possibility of a plane of symmetry. If the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it won't have optical isomerism.

In dimethyl fumarate, since both ends are identical (each has a COOCH3 group), the molecule is symmetrical. So even though the substituents are on opposite sides of the double bond, the molecule as a whole is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Wait, but wait. Fumarate is an E diastereomer. That is, the two COOCH3 groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. But if the substituents on each end are the same, the molecule could have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. For example, if the structure is symmetric, then it would not have optical isomerism.

But wait, another possibility: if the molecule has a center of inversion or a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral. So, in dimethyl fumarate, since each substituent on the double bond is the same (COOCH3), the molecule is symmetrical. So, it doesn't have optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think about another example. For instance, maleic anhydride is (Z) and has a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. Fumaric acid (E) doesn't have a plane of symmetry, so it is chiral. Wait, wait, no. Fumaric acid is chiral because it lacks a plane of symmetry. Wait, but wait, I might be getting this wrong.

No, wait, fumaric acid has two COOH groups on opposite sides of the double bond. So the molecule is symmetrical in terms of the substituents, but the overall structure may not have a plane of symmetry. Wait, let me imagine the structure:

         O
         ||
O   O=C-OCH3
 \ /
  C=C
 / \
O   O=C-OCH3
         O

No, that can't be right because the substituents are on opposite sides. So the molecule isn't symmetrical and thus can have enantiomers. Wait, but in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on each end are the same (COOCH3), so the molecule has a center of symmetry. Wait, no, because the configuration is E, the substituents are trans, but the molecule is still symmetrical along the plane perpendicular to the double bond. So the molecule is achiral, meaning no optical isomerism.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the substituents are the same, then the molecule would be symmetrical, so it's not chiral.

Wait, but fumaric acid is a meso compound? Or not? Let me think. No, fumaric acid is not a meso compound. Because in fumaric acid, the two COOH groups are on opposite sides of the double bond, but the molecule doesn't have a plane of symmetry. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. Let me think about the structure of fumaric acid. It's HOOC-CH=CH-COOH with the substituents on opposite sides. So, the structure is symmetrical across the center. So, it has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Wait, that's not correct. Because if the substituents are on opposite sides, the molecule is symmetric, so it's not chiral.

Wait, but if you have a molecule like (E)-butenedioic acid, it's symmetrical. Because flipping it over would result in the same structure. So it's not chiral. So dimethyl fumarate (the ester) would also be symmetrical and not chiral.

Wait, but wait. That would mean that dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism. But I'm not confident about this. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the substituents on each end are different. Wait, no, both are COOCH3, so they are same. So the molecule would have a plane of symmetry.

So, in conclusion, dimethyl fumarate (compound 4) does not exhibit optical isomerism.

Wait, but I'm getting confused here. Let me think of another example. For instance, maleic anhydride is (Z) and has a plane of symmetry, so it's not chiral. Fumaric acid (E) doesn't have a plane of symmetry, so it's chiral. Or wait, no. If the substituents are the same, then E or Z would not affect the symmetry. Wait, in the E configuration, each substituent is opposite, but if they are same, the molecule is symmetric.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up things. So, if the substituents on each end of a double bond are identical, then the molecule is symmetric and not chiral. So, in dimethyl fumarate, since both substituents on each end are COOCH3, the molecule is symmetrical. Therefore, it's not chiral and doesn't show optical isomerism.

So, summarizing each compound:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate: No chiral centers, symmetric. No optical isomerism.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate: Has a chiral center. Yes, optical isomerism.

3. Benzophenone: No chiral centers, symmetric. No optical isomerism.

4. Dimethyl fumarate: Symmetrical due to same substituents on each end. No optical isomerism.

So, the only compound that exhibits optical isomerism is compound 2.

Wait, but the options given are:

Options:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B) 3 and 4

C) 2 and 3

D) 1 and 2

Wait, wait, this can't be right. Because according to my analysis, only compound 2 shows optical isomerism. But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me reevaluate.

Compound 4: dimethyl fumarate.

If the structure is (E)-dimethyl fumarate, which is the trans isomer, then does it have a plane of symmetry?

If the substituents on each end are same (both COOCH3), then the molecule has a plane of symmetry through the center of the double bond. So, it's not chiral.

But wait, if a molecule has a double bond with same groups on each side but in trans configuration, it's not chiral because the molecule is symmetrical.

So, dimethyl fumarate is not chiral. Therefore, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, none of them have only 2. The options are:

A) 1, 2,4

B)3,4

C)2,3

D)1,2

Wait, so according to my analysis, only 2 is correct. But none of the options have only 2. Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

Wait, what if the substituents on each end are different. For example, if the structure is CH2(COOCH3) and CH(CH2COOCH3), but that's not the case for fumarate. Fumarate has the same groups on each end.

Wait, so maybe I was wrong about compound 4. Let me think of another approach. Are there any other possibilities where a molecule can exhibit optical isomerism without a chiral center? Like in allenes or cyclopropane rings, but I think in this case, the relevant point is chiral centers.

Wait, another possibility: maybe in compound 1, there's some axial chirality, like in biphenyl compounds. Let me reconsider compound 1.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

The structure is a biphenyl (two benzene rings connected by a single bond) with substituents at 2 and 2' (each has a methyl ester of a carboxylate group) and at 6 and 6' (nitro groups).

So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2. The two rings are connected at 1 and 1'.

So, the substituents are at 2 and 6 on each ring. Are these positions para to each other?

Yes, because on each benzene ring, positions 2 and 6 are para.

So, each ring has two para-substituents: a nitro and a carboxylate.

Now, can this molecule have axial chirality? Axial chirality refers to the chirality arising from the rotation around the central bond in a biaryl system. For the biaryl to exhibit axial chirality, the substituents on each ring must be arranged in a way that makes the molecule non-superimposable on its mirror image.

In biphenyl systems, when the substituents on each ring are in positions that are not symmetrical across the central bond, the molecule can have axial chirality.

In this case, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6 (para positions). So, looking at the molecule, the substituents on each ring are in the same positions relative to the central bond.

Wait, but looking from the top, each ring is symmetric. So, if the substituents on each ring are in the same positions (same substituents in the same positions), then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

But wait, in this case, the substituents on each ring are both nitro and carboxylate. So, each ring has a nitro and a carboxylate in para positions. So, the arrangement on each ring is the same. Therefore, the entire molecule is symmetrical across the central bond. Thus, it's achiral and doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

Hmm, so that brings me back. So, according to this, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A (1,2,4), option D (1,2), option C (2,3), and option A also has 4.

Wait, but according to my analysis, only 2 is correct, but none of the options have only 2. So perhaps I made a mistake in assessing one or more compounds.

Let me think about compound 4 again. Perhaps I was wrong.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl fumarate, which is a trans diastereomer. But does it have any chirality?

Wait, perhaps I should think about the structure again. Dimethyl fumarate has the structure:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

Wait, that's not correct because each C in the double bond must have two substituents besides the double bond. So the correct structure is:

Each C in the double bond has two substituents. So the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-COOCH3

Wait, no, that's not right either. Let me think again. The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is:

(CH2(COOCH3))2C=C(CH2(COOCH3))2? No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

COOCH3-CH2-CH2-COOCH3, but with a double bond between the two CH2 groups.

Wait, no. Fumarate is the trans (E) diacid, so the di-ester would have the same structure but with ester groups instead of COOH.

So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
CH2-CH2
|
COOCH3

But with a double bond between the two CH2 groups. So, it's (E)-CH2(COOCH3)-CH2(COOCH3), but with the substituents on opposite sides.

Wait, that's not correct because if it's a double bond, each carbon is CH, not CH2.

Ah! I think I was making a mistake earlier. The structure is:

O
||
O-C-OCH3
|
C=C
|
O
||
O-C-OCH3

So each of the two central carbons (in the double bond) is attached to one COOCH3 group and one H. So the structure is:

COOCH3-C=C-COOCH3, but with substituents on the same side (cis) or opposite sides (trans).

Wait, no, in dimethyl fumarate, the substituents on each end are the same (COOCH3), and the double bond is between two CH groups.

In this case, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry if the substituents are in the trans (E) configuration. Because each substituent is mirrored on the other side.

Wait, but if the substituents are in the trans configuration, then the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. Therefore, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have optical isomerism.

So, that brings me back. Only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is A (1,2,4), D (1,2), C (2,3), and A includes 4 which I think doesn't.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think about it again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

Each ring has substituents at 2 and 6.

If each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2, then each ring's substituents are para to each other.

Now, the question is whether the molecule has any chiral centers or axial chirality.

In biphenyl systems, if the substituents on each ring are in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it can exhibit axial chirality.

In this case, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, each ring's substituents are in para positions.

But looking at the entire molecule, the two rings are connected at 1 and 1', so the substituents are arranged symmetrically. So, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no optical isomerism.

Hmm, so only compound 2 has optical isomerism.

But according to the options, none of the options have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing one of the compounds.

Wait, looking back at the question. Maybe I misread one of the compounds. Let me check again.

Wait, the compounds are:

1. dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

2. methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate.

3. benzophenone.

4. dimethyl fumarate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl fumarate, which is also known as the trans isomer.

In the case of (E)-dimethyl fumarate, does it have any chiral centers? No, because each substituent on the double bond is the same. But wait, if the substituents are same, the molecule can't be chiral. So, no.

Wait, but what if the molecule is a meso compound? For example, something like meso-tartaric acid, which is achiral despite having stereocenters because of an internal plane of symmetry.

But in this case, dimethyl fumarate doesn't have stereocenters because of the double bond; it's a trans di-substituted compound.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for another approach. Which of these compounds have a chiral center?

Only compound 2 has a chiral center. So, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

So, the answer would be only 2 is correct. But looking back at the options:

The options are:

A) 1,2 and 4

B)3 and4

C) 2 and3

D)1 and2

So, none of the options have only 2. So, perhaps I made a mistake. Maybe I should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think about the possibility of compound 4 having a chiral center.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate has the structure where each end of the double bond has a COOCH3 group. No chiral centers, but what about the double bond? No, double bonds with same substituents on each end don't contribute to chirality.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again. Could compound 1 have axial chirality?

In biphenyl systems, substituents can lead to axial chirality when the substituents are in such positions that they break symmetry.

In this case, each ring has two substituents: nitro at 6 and carboxylate at 2. So, each ring's substituents are in para positions.

But considering the arrangement, the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. So, no.

Wait, what if the substituents are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry? For example, if the substituents on each ring are not symmetric.

But in this case, each ring has the same substituents in para positions, so the entire molecule is symmetric.

Therefore, no optical isomerism.

Hmm. So, I'm back to the conclusion that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But since the options don't include this, maybe I made a mistake in the assessment of compound 4.

Wait, perhaps dimethyl fumarate is a meso compound. But wait, a meso compound has stereocenters but is achiral due to an internal plane of symmetry.

Wait, but dimethyl fumarate doesn't have any stereocenters. It's a diastereomer, but not a chiral compound.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility that compound 4 can have geometric isomerism but not optical isomerism. Because geometric isomerism (E/Z) doesn't imply optical activity. Only compounds with chirality (enantiomers) exhibit optical isomerism.

So, I think I'm confident that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

Looking at the options, the only option that includes 2 is option A (1,2,4) and D (1 and 2), but I think 1 is not correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again.

Compound 1: dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate.

So, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate ester at 2.

The biphenyl is connected at 1 and 1'. So, each ring has substituents in the 2 and 6 positions, which are para.

Now, considering the biphenyl structure, the two rings are connected by a single bond, allowing rotation. Unless the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, it won't be chiral.

In this case, each ring's substituents are symmetrically placed, so the entire molecule has a plane of symmetry. So, it's not chiral.

So, back to only compound 2.

But the options don't have an option with only 2. So, perhaps the question is considering other possibilities.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think about the possibility of diastereomers and enantiomers.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl fumarate. But I'm thinking about whether it can have optical isomerism. I think not.

So, perhaps the correct answer is only compound 2, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again.

Another possibility: if the substituents on the biphenyl are such that the molecule isn't symmetrical, then it can have axial chirality.

In this case, each ring has a nitro at 6 and a carboxylate at 2. So, the positions are such that on each ring, the substituents are in the para positions relative to the connecting bond.

But considering the three-dimensional arrangement, perhaps the molecule can have axial chirality, making it chiral.

Wait, but in that case, the substituents on each ring would be arranged in such a way that their positions relative to each other create a lack of symmetry.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents on each ring are on the same side of the ring, leading to a chiral arrangement.

But I'm not confident about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is meso, meaning it has stereocenters but is achiral.

Wait, perhaps the molecule has two nitro groups and two ester groups arranged in a way that creates a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, maybe the molecule is symmetrical, so not chiral.

I think I'm stuck, but based on my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But since the options don't include that, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) 1, 2 and 4

B)3 and4

C)2 and3

D)1 and2

So, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis of compound 1. Let me think again.

If the substituents on each ring are arranged in a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral. For example, if on each ring, the nitro and carboxylate are on opposite sides.

Wait, but in this case, the substituents are at 2 and 6, which are para. So, if the rings are connected at 1 and 1', then the substituents are arranged such that each ring's substituents are in the same orientation relative to the central bond.

So, if both rings have the same arrangement, the molecule is symmetrical, making it achiral.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged in a way that the molecule has no plane of symmetry. But I can't visualize it; perhaps it's better to think that compound 1 is not chiral.

So, given all that, I think I'll conclude that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism, but since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake and should reevaluate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

Dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl fumarate. So, its structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

But wait, each C in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two H's. So, each C is attached to two identical groups, so no chiral centers. Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, I'm confident that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But in the options, the only option that includes 2 is A (1,2,4), D (1 and 2), and C (2 and 3). None of these are correct if only 2 is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound 4. Let me think again. Maybe dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center.

Wait, no, the structure doesn't have any chiral centers. Each C in the double bond is connected to two COOCH3 groups and two H's. So, no.

Hmm. Well, perhaps I should proceed with the conclusion that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism, but since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which includes 1,2,4.

But I think that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let me think again.

If the substituents on the biphenyl are arranged in such a way that the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry, then it would be chiral.

For example, if one ring has a nitro group in a certain position and the other ring has it in a different position, leading to asymmetry.

Wait, but in compound 1, both rings have nitro groups at 6 and carboxylate at 2. So, each ring is identical in terms of substituents, making the molecule symmetrical.

Therefore, no optical isomerism.

So, perhaps the correct answer is only compound 2, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound 4. Let me think about the possibility of substituents leading to a chiral center.

Wait, perhaps the structure of dimethyl fumarate is not as I thought. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe dimethyl fumarate is not (COOCH3)2C=C(COOCH3)2. No, that's not possible. The correct structure is (COOCH3)CH2-CH2(COOCH3) but with a double bond.

Wait, no, that would make it a single bond. So, perhaps the structure is:

CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond between the middle two CH2 groups.

Wait, but that would make the substituents on each end of the double bond different, leading to possible chirality.

Wait, that's a different structure. So, if the structure is CH2(COOCH3)-CH2-CH2-CH2(COOCH3) with a double bond between the second and third CH2 groups, then each end of the double bond would have a CH2(COOCH3) group on one end and a CH2CH2(COOCH3) group on the other, which are different.

Wait, but that would make the substituents on each end different, leading to a possibility of a chiral center. But wait, each C in the double bond would have two CH2 groups attached, so no chiral center.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the structure again.

The correct structure of dimethyl fumarate is (E)-butenedioic acid's di-ester. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

But each C in the double bond is attached to one COOCH3 and one H.

So, each C in the double bond has two substituents: COOCH3 and H. So, each C is CH, not CH2. So, each C is attached to two H's and a COOCH3.

So, each C has two H's, which are identical, and one COOCH3. So, each C is attached to three groups: COOCH3 and two H's. Thus, they are not chiral centers because they have two identical substituents (the H's).

Therefore, no chiral centers in compound 4.

So, I'm confident that only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism.

But the options don't include that, so perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4), but I think that is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assessing compound 1.

Wait, another angle: perhaps compound 1 is a meso compound. But I don't think so.

I think I've spent enough time on this. Based on my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since none of the options have that, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again. Maybe dimethyl fumarate has a chiral center.

Wait, no. The structure I described doesn't have any chiral centers.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 1. Let's say that compound 1 has axial chirality due to the substituents arrangement.

In biphenyl compounds, axial chirality occurs when the substituents on each ring are not symmetrical. For example, if the substituents are on the same side, the molecule can have axial chirality.

In compound 1, each ring has substituents at 2 and 6. So, if the substituents on each ring are on the same side relative to the central bond, the molecule could be chiral.

Wait, that's possible. Let me visualize this.

If the two nitro groups are on the same side of the biphenyl, and the two carboxylate groups are on the same side, then the arrangement might lack symmetry.

Wait, but in that case, each substituent is in the same position relative to their respective rings, which could create a plane of symmetry.

Alternatively, if the substituents on each ring are not aligned in the same way, the molecule could lack symmetry.

But without knowing the exact spatial arrangement, it's hard to say.

But given that each ring has the same substituents in the same positions, I think the molecule is symmetrical and thus not chiral.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not confident.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

Wait, dimethyl fumarate is (E)-dimethyl fumarate. So, the structure is:

COOCH3
|
C=C
|
COOCH3

In this structure, each C in the double bond has two substituents: COOCH3 and H. So, each C is CH, not CH2.

But in this case, each C is attached to two H's and one COOCH3 group. So, each C is CH, and there are two identical substituents (H's), meaning no chiral centers.

Therefore, dimethyl fumarate (compound 4) doesn't exhibit optical isomerism.

So, the only correct option is compound 2.

But the options don't have that. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis of compound 2.

Wait, compound 2 is methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate. The structure is CH3-C(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, no, the structure is CH2(OH)CH2COOCH3.

Wait, earlier I thought that the middle carbon (C2) is attached to:

- CH2OH,
- CH2COOCH3,
- two H's.

Wait, no, that can't be. Let me think again.

The structure of methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate is:

The propanoate ester is formed from 2-hydroxypropanoic acid and methanol.

The structure of 2-hydroxypropanoic acid is CH3CH(OH)COOH. So, the ester would be CH3CH(OH)COOCH3.

So, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Now, looking at the C(OH): the substituents are:

- CH3,
- COOCH3,
- two H's.

Wait, no, the C(OH) is attached to:

- CH3 (from the left),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from the right),
- and another CH2 group? No, it's a secondary carbon.

Wait, no, the structure is:

CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3.

Wait, the middle carbon (C2) has:

- CH3 (from C1),
- OH,
- COOCH3 (from C3),
- and another H.

So, four substituents: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. All four are different. Therefore, this carbon is a chiral center, making the molecule chiral and capable of optical isomerism.

So, yes, compound 2 does exhibit optical isomerism.

Thus, the correct answer must be option A, which includes 1,2,4. But I don't think 1 and 4 exhibit optical isomerism.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 4. Let me think again.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps dimethyl fumarate has a double bond that's not symmetric, making it chiral.

Wait, but if each substituent on the double bond is the same, then the molecule is symmetric and not chiral.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A (1,2,4), but I'm not confident. Alternatively, maybe the answer is option A.

But based on my analysis, only compound 2 exhibits optical isomerism. So, perhaps the correct answer is option A, but I'm not sure.


To determine which organic moieties exhibit optical isomerism, we analyze each compound for the presence of chirality, which arises when a molecule has a non-superimposable mirror image. Chirality typically occurs due to a chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or axial chirality in certain systems like biphenyls.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **Dimethyl 6,6'-dinitro-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-dicarboxylate**  
   This compound consists of two benzene rings connected at the 1 and 1' positions, with nitro groups at 6 and 6' and carboxylate ester groups at 2 and 2'. Each ring has substituents in para positions, and the molecule is symmetric due to the identical substituents on both rings. This symmetry prevents chirality, so no optical isomerism is observed.

2. **Methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate**  
   The structure of this compound is CH3-CH(OH)-COOCH3. The carbon atom at the second position (C2) is bonded to four different groups: CH3, OH, COOCH3, and H. This makes it a chiral center, and the molecule exhibits optical isomerism.

3. **Benzophenone**  
   Benzophenone has the structure Ph-C(=O)-Ph, where two phenyl groups are attached to a carbonyl carbon. The carbonyl carbon is double-bonded to oxygen and has identical substituents (two phenyl groups), making it achiral. No optical isomerism is observed.

4. **Dimethyl Fumarate**  
   Dimethyl fumarate is the diester of fumaric acid, with the structure (COOCH3)-C=C-(COOCH3) in the trans (E) configuration. Each carbon in the double bond is attached to two identical groups (COOCH3 and H), preventing the formation of a chiral center. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. No optical isomerism is observed.

### Conclusion:
Among the four compounds, only **methyl 2-hydroxypropanoate (compound 2)** exhibits optical isomerism due to the presence of a chiral center. None of the other compounds (1, 3, or 4) are chiral or exhibit optical isomerism.

However, none of the provided options include only compound 2. Based on the analysis, the most reasonable answer is **option A (1, 2, and 4)**, even though compounds 1 and 4 do not exhibit optical isomerism.
