Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed is when all its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things are different. Oh right, relativistic effects come into play, so I can't just use the simple classical formula.

The question gives F = -kx, which is Hooke's law, so it's a harmonic oscillator. The mass is m, and maximum amplitude is A. The speed of light is c, so we have to consider relativistic terms.

In special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy includes a gamma factor. The relativistic kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², where γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy E is γmc², and the kinetic energy is E - mc².

In the classical case, the potential energy at maximum amplitude is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². They're equal at the equilibrium point, so v_max squared is (kA²)/m. But that's non-relativistic.

But here, we're dealing with relativistic speeds. So the energy considerations must include the relativistic terms.

Wait, the total energy of the oscillator should still be conserved. At maximum displacement (amplitude A), all the energy is potential, and at equilibrium (where speed is max), all the energy is kinetic. But in relativity, the total energy isn't just kinetic; it's the sum of rest mass energy plus kinetic.

So, let's think about the total energy. At maximum amplitude, the oscillator is at rest, right? No, wait, that's not right. No, wait, when it's at maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. But in the classical case, that's when velocity is max. Wait, no, no: in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is maximum at the extremes (x=A), and the kinetic is maximum at x=0. So for the maximum speed, the kinetic energy is maximum, and the potential is zero. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is still part of the total energy.

Wait, but wait: in the relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of rest mass and kinetic. So, when the oscillator is at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². Let's call that V_max. At that point, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is equal to V_max.

But when the oscillator is at equilibrium (x=0), the potential energy is zero, so all the energy is kinetic. So the kinetic energy at that point is E. But in relativity, kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc².

So, setting up the equation: the potential energy at x=A is (1/2)kA². That equals the total energy, which is E = γ mc² when the oscillator is at x=0 (since at x=0, all energy is kinetic, so E = γ mc²).

Wait, no, no. At x=A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. Hence, the total energy E is equal to the potential energy at x=A, which is (1/2)kA². At x=0, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is all kinetic energy, which is (γ - 1)mc². So (1/2)kA² = (γ - 1)mc².

Wait, but that can't be right. Because in the non-relativistic case, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv². So v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But that's non-relativistic. However, we have to consider the relativistic case.

Wait, maybe I should write the equation correctly. At x=A, velocity is zero, so the total energy E is (1/2)kA². Wait no, wait, in the relativistic scenario, the total energy when the velocity is zero is just the rest mass energy plus any potential energy? Or is the potential energy part of the total energy?

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the correct relativistic energy expressions. The total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) should equal the total relativistic energy, which includes the rest mass energy.

Wait, no, that's not right. The total energy in relativity is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is part of the mechanical energy. But maybe this is where I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to say that the mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) equals the total relativistic energy, which is γ mc². Because in the relativistic case, the total energy includes rest mass plus kinetic.

So, let's model it this way. The total mechanical energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential energies.

At x=A, velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. Potential energy is (1/2)kA². So E = (1/2)kA². But E is also the total energy, which is γ mc². So (1/2)kA² = γ mc². But wait, that can't be right because when the particle is at maximum displacement, its velocity is zero, so γ would be 1 (since v=0). So E would be mc². So (1/2)kA² = mc². That would mean kA² = 2mc², but that seems like a very strong force. Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the approach is incorrect. Maybe the potential energy in the relativistic oscillator is different, but I think the problem states it's obeying Hooke's law, so F = -kx, so the potential is (1/2)kx².

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to consider that the total energy E is (1/2)kA², which is the sum of the potential and kinetic energies. So at maximum displacement, E = (1/2)kA². At equilibrium, E = KE = (γ - 1) mc².

So setting (1/2)kA² = (γ - 1) mc². So γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²). Then, γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²) = [2 mc² + kA² ]/(2 mc²).

Wait, but γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So we can write:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

Let me write that as:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

We can solve for v_max.

Let me denote (kA²)/(2m c²) as some variable for simplicity. Let's say (kA^2)/(2 m c²) = α. Then,

gamma = 1 + α.

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + α.

Let's square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + α)^2.

Take reciprocal:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + α)^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + α)^2.

v^2 = c² [1 - 1/(1 + α)^2 ].

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + α)^2. Let me compute 1 + alpha as (some value). Let me compute 1 - 1/(1+alpha)^2 = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Wait, [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 - 1 = 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (2 alpha + alpha^2 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ].

But alpha is (kA^2)/(2 m c^2). Let's see if this can be simplified.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another thought: maybe the total energy is not just the sum of rest energy and kinetic, but in the oscillator, the potential energy is part of the mechanical energy, and the total energy is E = (1/2)kA². So when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic, which is (gamma - 1) mc². So E = (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

Wait, that makes sense. So,

(1/2)kA^2 = (gamma - 1) mc^2.

So,

gamma = 1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2).

Which is the same as before. So proceeding with that.

Let me write gamma = 1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2).

Wait, let's see which option matches this.

Looking at the options:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2 m c^2)) )

Wait, that doesn't match.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2 m)) ) multiplied by c.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, let's go back to the expression for v in terms of gamma.

We have v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

Because:

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

So,

1/gamma^2 = 1 - v^2/c^2.

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2.

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

So,

gamma = 1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2).

Thus,

1/gamma = 1/[1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2) ].

So,

1/gamma^2 = 1/[ (1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 ].

Then,

1 - 1/gamma^2 = [ (1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 -1 ] / (1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2))^2.

Wait, let me compute numerator:

(1 + x)^2 -1 = 1 + 2x +x² -1 = 2x +x².

So,

v = c * sqrt( [2x + x²] / (1 +x)^2 ), where x = (kA^2)/(2 m c^2).

Simplify numerator: 2x + x² = x(2 + x).

Denominator: (1 + x)^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( x (2 + x) ) / (1 +x)^2 )

Wait, can this be simplified further?

Let me factor x as (kA^2)/(2 m c^2).

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a better way to manipulate the equation.

Wait, let's write gamma as (2 m c^2 + kA^2) / (2 m c^2).

Wait,

gamma = 1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2) = [2 m c^2 + kA^2 ] / (2 m c^2).

So,

gamma = (2 m c^2 + kA^2) / (2 m c^2).

So,

gamma squared is [ (2 m c^2 + kA^2)^2 ] / [ (2 m c^2)^2 ].

So,

1 - 1/gamma^2 = 1 - [ (2 m c^2)^2 ] / (2 m c^2 + kA^2)^2.

= [ (2 m c^2 + kA^2)^2 - (2 m c^2)^2 ] / (2 m c^2)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(2mc² + kA²)^2 - (2mc²)^2 = (4 m² c^4 + 4 mc² kA² + k² A^4) -4 m² c^4

= 4 mc² k A² + k² A^4.

Factor numerator:

= k A² (4 m c² + k A²).

Wait, that's 4 mc² k A² + k² A^4 = kA² (4 mc² +k A²).

So,

1 - 1/gamma^2 = [k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / (2 m c^2)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [k A² (4 m c^2 + k A²) ] / (4 m² c^4).

Simplify.

v^2 = [k A² (4 m c^2 + k A²) ] / (4 m² c²).

Hmm, maybe this isn't leading me anywhere. Let's try another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should square both sides of the equation for v.

We have:

v= c sqrt( 1 - 1/(gamma^2) )

But gamma = 1 + (kA^2)/(2 mc^2) = [2 m c^2 + kA^2 ]/(2 m c^2).

So,

gamma^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + kA^2 )^2 ] / (4 m^2 c^4).

So,

1/gamma^2 = [4 m^2 c^4 ] / [ (2 m c^2 + kA^2 )^2 ].

So,

1 - 1/gamma^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + kA^2 )^2 - 4 m^2 c^4 ] / (4 m^2 c^4).

The numerator is (2 m c^2 + kA^2)^2 - (2 m c^2)^2.

Which is [ (a + b)^2 - a^2 ] where a=2mc² and b=kA².

So,

= a² + 2ab + b² -a² = 2ab + b² = b(2a + b).

So,

= (kA^2)(2*(2 m c^2) + kA^2 ) =kA² (4 m c^2 + k A^2).

So,

1 - 1/gamma^2 = [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2)] / [4 m^2 c^4 ].

Putting it back into v:

v = c * sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2)] / [4 m^2 c^4] )

Simplify the fraction inside the sqrt:

= sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2) ] / (4 m² c^4) )

= sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2) ] ) / (2 m c² )

Factor numerator:

= [A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2) ) ] / (2 m c^2 )

Hmm, not sure if this is helpful. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, perhaps the expression can be rewritten in terms of the denominator or numerator.

Wait, another approach: perhaps it's easier to look for the velocity expression in terms of gamma.

We have gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

So,

gamma = (2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c² )

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) as beta.

So, gamma = 1 + beta.

So,

gamma = (1 + beta )

So,

gamma^2 = (1 + beta )^2 = 1 + 2 beta + beta^2.

So,

1/gamma^2 = 1 / (1 + beta )^2.

So,

1 - 1/gamma^2 = [ (1 + beta )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + beta )^2.

= [ 1 + 2 beta + beta^2 -1 ] / (1 + beta )^2.

= [ 2 beta + beta^2 ] / (1 + beta )^2.

Factor numerator: beta (2 + beta ).

So,

v^2/c^2 = beta (2 + beta ) / (1 + beta )^2.

v = c sqrt( [ beta (2 + beta ) ] / (1 + beta )^2 )

= c sqrt( [ beta (2 + beta) ] ) / (1 + beta )

But beta is (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

beta = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Let me substitute back.

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2/(2 m c² )) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ] ) / ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

Hmm, this looks complicated. Let me see if any option matches this structure.

Looking at the options:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, no, that seems different.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + x )^2, where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ).

1 - 1/(1+x)^2 = [ (1+x)^2 - 1 ]/(1+x)^2.

= (2x + x²)/(1 + x )^2.

Which is the same as [x (2 + x ) ]/(1+x )^2.

So,

sqrt( [x (2 +x ) ] )/(1 + x ) ) = sqrt( [ x (2 +x ) ] ) / (1 +x )

So,

v = c * sqrt( x (2 +x ) )/(1 +x )

Which matches our earlier expression.

Wait, but according to option D, it's sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 ), which is the same as sqrt( [x (2 +x ) ] / (1 +x )^2 ), so yes, that's correct.

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ x (2+x) ] ) / (1+x )

But looking at option D:

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is equal to c * sqrt( [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) (2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) ] ) / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

Which is the same as what we have. So option D gives v_max as c multiplied by sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ), which is correct.

Wait, but looking back, another approach: when you have (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2) k A^2. So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So, gamma is greater than 1, which makes sense.

So, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 )

Which can be written as v = c * sqrt( (gamma² -1 ) / gamma² )

But gamma² is (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

So,

gamma² -1 = [ (1 + x )^2 - 1 ] where x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

= 2x + x².

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2x + x² ) ) / (1 + x )

Which is the same as sqrt( x (2 + x ) ) / (1 + x ) * c.

Looking at the options, option D seems to fit.

Wait, but let me compute option D.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - [ 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] )

Which is equal to c * sqrt( [ (1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 -1 ) ] / [ (1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) ] )

Wait, no, actually,

Option D says: 1 - [ 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) ]

Wait, no, no, no. Let me re-read option D.

Option D is: c * sqrt( 1 - [ 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ] )

Which is exactly what we have: 1 - 1/(1 + x )^2, where x= (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So yes, option D is correct.

Wait, but looking back at another approach: the maximum speed in option C is the non-relativistic case, which would be correct only if the relativistic effects are negligible. But in this problem, we have to account for relativity, so option C is likely incorrect.

So, the correct answer is option B or D. Wait, no, earlier steps led us to option D.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Yes, that's correct based on our derivation.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we must account for relativistic energy considerations. The total energy of the oscillator is conserved and includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Conservation**:  
   At maximum amplitude \( x = A \), the oscillator's velocity is zero, and all energy is potential energy:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]  
   At equilibrium \( x = 0 \), all energy is kinetic. The total relativistic energy is given by:  
   \[
   E = \gamma mc^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]  
   At equilibrium, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{kinetic}} = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
   \]  
   Equating the potential energy at \( x = A \) to the kinetic energy at \( x = 0 \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
   \]  
   Solving for \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   The relativistic relation between \( \gamma \) and velocity is:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2
   \]  
   Taking the reciprocal and solving for \( v^2/c^2 \):  
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) with the given options, it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option D**, as it accurately accounts for the relativistic effects on the maximum speed of the oscillator.

Answer: D

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the maximum speed of a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I remember that in classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator's maximum speed is when all its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. But wait, this is a relativistic case, so things are different. Oh right, relativistic effects come into play, so I can't just use the simple classical formula.

The question gives F = -kx, which is Hooke's law, so it's a harmonic oscillator. The mass is m, and maximum amplitude is A. The speed of light is c, so we have to consider relativistic terms.

In special relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv². Instead, the total energy includes a gamma factor. The relativistic kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc², where γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So the total energy E is γmc², and the kinetic energy is E - mc².

In the classical case, the potential energy at maximum amplitude is (1/2)kA², and the kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_max². They're equal at the equilibrium point, so v_max squared is (kA²)/m. But that's non-relativistic.

But here, we're dealing with relativistic speeds. So the energy considerations must include the relativistic terms.

Wait, the total energy of the oscillator should still be conserved. At maximum displacement (amplitude A), all the energy is potential, and at equilibrium (where speed is max), all the energy is kinetic. But in relativity, the total energy isn't just kinetic; it's the sum of rest mass energy plus kinetic.

So, let's think about the total energy. At maximum amplitude, the oscillator is at rest, right? No, wait, that's not right. No, wait, when it's at maximum displacement (x=A), the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. But in the classical case, that's when velocity is max. Wait, no, no: in a harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is maximum at the extremes (x=A), and the kinetic is maximum at x=0. So for the maximum speed, the kinetic energy is maximum, and the potential is zero. But in the relativistic case, the kinetic energy is still part of the total energy.

Wait, but wait: in the relativistic case, the total energy is the sum of rest mass and kinetic. So, when the oscillator is at x=A, the potential energy is (1/2)kA². Let's call that V_max. At that point, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. So the total energy E is equal to V_max.

But when the oscillator is at equilibrium (x=0), the potential energy is zero, so all the energy is kinetic. So the kinetic energy at that point is E. But in relativity, kinetic energy is (γ-1)mc².

So, setting up the equation: the potential energy at x=A is (1/2)kA². That equals the total energy, which is E = γ mc² when the oscillator is at x=0 (since at x=0, all energy is kinetic, so E = γ mc²).

Wait, no, no. At x=A, the velocity is zero, so the kinetic energy is zero. Hence, the total energy E is equal to the potential energy at x=A, which is (1/2)kA². At x=0, the potential energy is zero, so the total energy is all kinetic energy, which is (γ - 1)mc². So (1/2)kA² = (γ - 1)mc².

Wait, but that can't be right. Because in the non-relativistic case, (1/2)kA² = (1/2)mv². So v_max would be sqrt(kA²/m), which is option C. But that's non-relativistic. However, we have to consider the relativistic case.

Wait, maybe I should write the equation correctly. At x=A, velocity is zero, so the total energy E is (1/2)kA². Wait no, wait, in the relativistic scenario, the total energy when the velocity is zero is just the rest mass energy plus any potential energy? Or is the potential energy part of the total energy?

Wait, perhaps I should model this using the correct relativistic energy expressions. The total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) should equal the total relativistic energy, which includes the rest mass energy.

Wait, no, that's not right. The total energy in relativity is the sum of rest mass energy and kinetic energy. So in the harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is part of the mechanical energy. But maybe this is where I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to say that the mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential) equals the total relativistic energy, which is γ mc². Because in the relativistic case, the total energy includes rest mass plus kinetic.

So, let's model it this way. The total mechanical energy E is the sum of kinetic and potential energies.

At x=A, velocity is zero, so kinetic energy is zero. Potential energy is (1/2)kA². So E = (1/2)kA². But E is also the total energy, which is γ mc². So (1/2)kA² = γ mc². But wait, that can't be right because when the particle is at maximum displacement, its velocity is zero, so γ would be 1 (since v=0). So E would be mc². So (1/2)kA² = mc². That would mean kA² = 2mc², but that seems like a very strong force. Hmm, perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the approach is incorrect. Maybe the potential energy in the relativistic oscillator is different, but I think the problem states it's obeying Hooke's law, so F = -kx, so the potential is (1/2)kx².

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to consider that the total energy E is (1/2)kA², which is the sum of the potential and kinetic energies. So at maximum displacement, E = (1/2)kA². At equilibrium, E = KE = (γ - 1) mc².

So setting (1/2)kA² = (γ - 1) mc². So γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²). Then, γ = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²) = [2 mc² + kA² ]/(2 mc²).

Wait, but γ is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So we can write:

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + (kA²)/(2 mc²).

Let me write that as:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c²).

We can solve for v_max.

Let me denote (kA²)/(2m c²) as some variable for simplicity. Let's say (kA^2)/(2 m c²) = α. Then,

gamma = 1 + α.

So, 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 1 + α.

Let's square both sides:

1/(1 - v²/c²) = (1 + α)^2.

Take reciprocal:

1 - v²/c² = 1/(1 + α)^2.

So,

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/(1 + α)^2.

v^2 = c² [1 - 1/(1 + α)^2 ].

Let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + α)^2. Let me compute 1 + alpha as (some value). Let me compute 1 - 1/(1+alpha)^2 = [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] / (1 + alpha)^2.

Wait, [ (1 + alpha)^2 - 1 ] = 1 + 2 alpha + alpha^2 - 1 = 2 alpha + alpha^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 [ (2 alpha + alpha^2 ) / (1 + alpha)^2 ) ].

But alpha is (kA^2)/(2 m c^2). Let's see if this can be simplified.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another thought: maybe the total energy is not just the sum of rest energy and kinetic, but in the oscillator, the potential energy is part of the mechanical energy, and the total energy is E = (1/2)kA². So when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic, which is (gamma - 1) mc². So E = (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2)kA².

Wait, that makes sense. So,

(1/2)kA^2 = (gamma - 1) mc^2.

So,

gamma = 1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2).

Which is the same as before. So proceeding with that.

Let me write gamma = 1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2).

Wait, let's see which option matches this.

Looking at the options:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2 m c^2)) )

Wait, that doesn't match.

Option A: sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (kA^2)/(2 m)) ) multiplied by c.

Wait, perhaps not.

Wait, let's go back to the expression for v in terms of gamma.

We have v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

Because:

gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2).

So,

1/gamma^2 = 1 - v^2/c^2.

v^2/c^2 = 1 - 1/gamma^2.

v = c sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2).

So,

gamma = 1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2).

Thus,

1/gamma = 1/[1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2) ].

So,

1/gamma^2 = 1/[ (1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 ].

Then,

1 - 1/gamma^2 = [ (1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2))^2 -1 ] / (1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2))^2.

Wait, let me compute numerator:

(1 + x)^2 -1 = 1 + 2x +x² -1 = 2x +x².

So,

v = c * sqrt( [2x + x²] / (1 +x)^2 ), where x = (kA^2)/(2 m c^2).

Simplify numerator: 2x + x² = x(2 + x).

Denominator: (1 + x)^2.

So,

v = c * sqrt( x (2 + x) ) / (1 +x)^2 )

Wait, can this be simplified further?

Let me factor x as (kA^2)/(2 m c^2).

Alternatively, perhaps we can find a better way to manipulate the equation.

Wait, let's write gamma as (2 m c^2 + kA^2) / (2 m c^2).

Wait,

gamma = 1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2) = [2 m c^2 + kA^2 ] / (2 m c^2).

So,

gamma = (2 m c^2 + kA^2) / (2 m c^2).

So,

gamma squared is [ (2 m c^2 + kA^2)^2 ] / [ (2 m c^2)^2 ].

So,

1 - 1/gamma^2 = 1 - [ (2 m c^2)^2 ] / (2 m c^2 + kA^2)^2.

= [ (2 m c^2 + kA^2)^2 - (2 m c^2)^2 ] / (2 m c^2)^2.

Expanding numerator:

(2mc² + kA²)^2 - (2mc²)^2 = (4 m² c^4 + 4 mc² kA² + k² A^4) -4 m² c^4

= 4 mc² k A² + k² A^4.

Factor numerator:

= k A² (4 m c² + k A²).

Wait, that's 4 mc² k A² + k² A^4 = kA² (4 mc² +k A²).

So,

1 - 1/gamma^2 = [k A² (4 m c² + k A²) ] / (2 m c^2)^2.

So,

v^2 = c^2 * [k A² (4 m c^2 + k A²) ] / (4 m² c^4).

Simplify.

v^2 = [k A² (4 m c^2 + k A²) ] / (4 m² c²).

Hmm, maybe this isn't leading me anywhere. Let's try another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should square both sides of the equation for v.

We have:

v= c sqrt( 1 - 1/(gamma^2) )

But gamma = 1 + (kA^2)/(2 mc^2) = [2 m c^2 + kA^2 ]/(2 m c^2).

So,

gamma^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + kA^2 )^2 ] / (4 m^2 c^4).

So,

1/gamma^2 = [4 m^2 c^4 ] / [ (2 m c^2 + kA^2 )^2 ].

So,

1 - 1/gamma^2 = [ (2 m c^2 + kA^2 )^2 - 4 m^2 c^4 ] / (4 m^2 c^4).

The numerator is (2 m c^2 + kA^2)^2 - (2 m c^2)^2.

Which is [ (a + b)^2 - a^2 ] where a=2mc² and b=kA².

So,

= a² + 2ab + b² -a² = 2ab + b² = b(2a + b).

So,

= (kA^2)(2*(2 m c^2) + kA^2 ) =kA² (4 m c^2 + k A^2).

So,

1 - 1/gamma^2 = [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2)] / [4 m^2 c^4 ].

Putting it back into v:

v = c * sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2)] / [4 m^2 c^4] )

Simplify the fraction inside the sqrt:

= sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2) ] / (4 m² c^4) )

= sqrt( [k A^2 (4 m c^2 + k A^2) ] ) / (2 m c² )

Factor numerator:

= [A sqrt( k (4 m c^2 + k A^2) ) ] / (2 m c^2 )

Hmm, not sure if this is helpful. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, perhaps the expression can be rewritten in terms of the denominator or numerator.

Wait, another approach: perhaps it's easier to look for the velocity expression in terms of gamma.

We have gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2 m c²).

So,

gamma = (2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c² )

So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) as beta.

So, gamma = 1 + beta.

So,

gamma = (1 + beta )

So,

gamma^2 = (1 + beta )^2 = 1 + 2 beta + beta^2.

So,

1/gamma^2 = 1 / (1 + beta )^2.

So,

1 - 1/gamma^2 = [ (1 + beta )^2 - 1 ] / (1 + beta )^2.

= [ 1 + 2 beta + beta^2 -1 ] / (1 + beta )^2.

= [ 2 beta + beta^2 ] / (1 + beta )^2.

Factor numerator: beta (2 + beta ).

So,

v^2/c^2 = beta (2 + beta ) / (1 + beta )^2.

v = c sqrt( [ beta (2 + beta ) ] / (1 + beta )^2 )

= c sqrt( [ beta (2 + beta) ] ) / (1 + beta )

But beta is (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

So,

beta = (k A^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Let me substitute back.

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A^2/(2 m c² )) * (2 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) ] ) / ( 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) )

Hmm, this looks complicated. Let me see if any option matches this structure.

Looking at the options:

Option B: v_max = c sqrt( 1 + 1/(1 - (k A²)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Wait, no, that seems different.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, let me compute 1 - 1/(1 + x )^2, where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ).

1 - 1/(1+x)^2 = [ (1+x)^2 - 1 ]/(1+x)^2.

= (2x + x²)/(1 + x )^2.

Which is the same as [x (2 + x ) ]/(1+x )^2.

So,

sqrt( [x (2 +x ) ] )/(1 + x ) ) = sqrt( [ x (2 +x ) ] ) / (1 +x )

So,

v = c * sqrt( x (2 +x ) )/(1 +x )

Which matches our earlier expression.

Wait, but according to option D, it's sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + x )^2 ), which is the same as sqrt( [x (2 +x ) ] / (1 +x )^2 ), so yes, that's correct.

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ x (2+x) ] ) / (1+x )

But looking at option D:

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is equal to c * sqrt( [ (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) (2 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) ) ] ) / (1 + (k A^2/(2 m c^2 )) )

Which is the same as what we have. So option D gives v_max as c multiplied by sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ), which is correct.

Wait, but looking back, another approach: when you have (gamma - 1) mc² = (1/2) k A^2. So,

gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So, gamma is greater than 1, which makes sense.

So, v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 )

Which can be written as v = c * sqrt( (gamma² -1 ) / gamma² )

But gamma² is (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2.

So,

gamma² -1 = [ (1 + x )^2 - 1 ] where x is (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

= 2x + x².

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2x + x² ) ) / (1 + x )

Which is the same as sqrt( x (2 + x ) ) / (1 + x ) * c.

Looking at the options, option D seems to fit.

Wait, but let me compute option D.

Option D: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - [ 1/(1 + (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] )

Which is equal to c * sqrt( [ (1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 -1 ) ] / [ (1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) ] )

Wait, no, actually,

Option D says: 1 - [ 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ) ]

Wait, no, no, no. Let me re-read option D.

Option D is: c * sqrt( 1 - [ 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 ] )

Which is exactly what we have: 1 - 1/(1 + x )^2, where x= (kA^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So yes, option D is correct.

Wait, but looking back at another approach: the maximum speed in option C is the non-relativistic case, which would be correct only if the relativistic effects are negligible. But in this problem, we have to account for relativity, so option C is likely incorrect.

So, the correct answer is option B or D. Wait, no, earlier steps led us to option D.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (kA^2/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Yes, that's correct based on our derivation.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a 1-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and obeying Hooke's law \( F = -kx \), we must account for relativistic energy considerations. The total energy of the oscillator is conserved and includes both rest mass energy and kinetic energy.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Relativistic Energy Conservation**:  
   At maximum amplitude \( x = A \), the oscillator's velocity is zero, and all energy is potential energy:  
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]  
   At equilibrium \( x = 0 \), all energy is kinetic. The total relativistic energy is given by:  
   \[
   E = \gamma mc^2 \quad \text{where} \quad \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]  
   At equilibrium, the kinetic energy is the total energy minus the rest mass energy:  
   \[
   E_{\text{kinetic}} = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
   \]  
   Equating the potential energy at \( x = A \) to the kinetic energy at \( x = 0 \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}kA^2 = (\gamma - 1)mc^2
   \]  
   Solving for \( \gamma \):  
   \[
   \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]

2. **Relating \( \gamma \) to \( v_{\text{max}} \)**:  
   The relativistic relation between \( \gamma \) and velocity is:  
   \[
   \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \):  
   \[
   \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
   \]  
   Squaring both sides:  
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = \left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2
   \]  
   Taking the reciprocal and solving for \( v^2/c^2 \):  
   \[
   1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   \[
   \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}
   \]  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

3. **Matching with Options**:  
   Comparing the derived expression for \( v_{\text{max}} \) with the given options, it matches **Option D**:  
   \[
   v_{\text{max}} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
   \]

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option D**, as it accurately accounts for the relativistic effects on the maximum speed of the oscillator.

Answer: D
