Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see, the question is about identifying the correct 1H NMR data for a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The compound has a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond, as indicated by the FTIR peaks.

Hmm, first, I should probably sketch this out. A di-substituted benzene ring—wait, but it says 8 carbons in total. Benzene has 6 carbons. So two substituents must add 2 carbons each? Or maybe one substituent has more than one carbon.

Wait, di-substituted means two substituents. So, the aromatic ring has two substituents attached. Let me think—each substituent could be a single atom or a group. Since there's a carbonyl group (like a ketone or aldehyde) and an aromatic-halogen bond (so a halogen attached directly to the ring).

Wait, carbonyl groups in aromatic compounds—like maybe a ketone substituent. For example, something like acetophenone or similar. Alternatively, maybe a nitro group isn't involved here because the IR shows a carbonyl, not a nitro.

Wait, the carbonyl could be part of a substituent attached to the benzene ring. Let's think about substituents. Let's say one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group, like an ester, ketone, or maybe an acetyl group.

Wait, but the aromatic ring has two substituents. So if one is a halogen (like Cl or Br) attached directly, and the other is a carbonyl-containing group.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the substituents are an aldehyde (CHO) and a halogen. But aldehyde is a carbonyl, and halogen is another substituent. But wait, the aldehyde would be a substituent on the ring, but I'm not sure if that's possible in a di-substituted case. Or maybe both substituents are part of a larger group.

Wait, the total carbon count is 8. Benzene has 6, so the two substituents contribute 2 carbons in total. So perhaps each substituent has one carbon each. Then, one substituent could be a halogen (like Cl, which is one atom but zero carbons), but that's not possible because 6 + 2=8. Wait, if each substituent is a single carbon, then the total is 6 +2=8. But halogens (like Cl, Br) are substituents without adding carbons. Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let's recalculate. The compound has a benzene ring (6 C) plus two substituents. The total carbons are 8, so the substituents add 2 carbons. So each substituent must have one carbon, or one substituent has two carbons and the other has none.

Wait, a halogen substituent (like Cl) doesn't add any carbons. So if you have a benzene ring with two substituents: one Cl and another group with one carbon, that's 6 + 0 +1 =7 C. Doesn't reach 8. So maybe one substituent has two carbons and the other has zero.

Wait, let's see: Benzene (6 C) + substituent X (with m C) + substituent Y (with n C) = 6 + m +n =8. So m +n=2.

Possible combinations: m=2, n=0; m=1, n=1.

If substituent Y is a halogen (n=0), then substituent X must contribute 2 carbons. So substituent X is a two-carbon group. What's a two-carbon substituent that has a carbonyl group?

Hmm, perhaps an acetyloxy group (like OAc, which is O-CO-CH3). Wait, that's two carbons in the substituent (the methyl from the acetyl). Wait, the substituent would be something like -O-CO-CH3. So the substituent would add two carbons (from the methyl group). So total would be 6 (benzene) + 0 (Cl) + 2 (OAc) =8? Wait, but OAc is O-CO-CH3, which is part of a larger substituent. So that substituent would add two carbons (the CH3), but the substituent itself is OAc (O-CO-CH3), which has no C attached to the benzene except O.

Wait, maybe substituent X is a carbonyl group. Let me think of the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a ketone substituent. For example, a benzophenone derivative, but that's a bit more complex.

Wait, another approach: The molecule has a carbonyl group (so either ketone, aldehyde, ester, etc.) and a halogen attached to the ring.

Let me think of the structure. Maybe something like 4-bromoacetophenone. So benzene with a Br in one position and an acetyl group (COCH3) in another. That would make the substituents: Br (0 carbons) and COCH3 (2 carbons: the CO is part of the substituent, but the CH3 is the extra carbon). Wait, but the substituent is -COCH3, which is a ketone. So, the substituent adds two carbons (the CO is from the benzene's substituent, but wait, the benzene is the ring. Hmm, the substituent is -COCH3, which has two carbons: the C from CO and the CH3. So benzene (6) + 2 (from substituent) = 8? Wait, no, benzene is 6, substituent is COCH3 (which is 2 carbons), and another substituent. Wait, the molecule is di-substituted, so two substituents. So in this scenario, one substituent is Br (0 C), the other is COCH3 (2 C). So total: 6 +0 +2=8. Okay, that fits.

So the structure would be, say, 4-bromoacetophenone. Or another di-substituted arrangement.

Now, looking at the NMR options, I need to figure out which one matches the structure.

In 4-bromoacetophenone, the substituents are in the para positions. The Br is in one position, the COCH3 in another. Wait, wait, no, if it's di-substituted, substituents could be in para, meta, or ortho positions. But for acetophenone with another substituent, perhaps the positions would affect the NMR.

Wait, but let's think about the NMR signals.

In acetophenone, the COCH3 group would give a singlet for the methyl group attached to the carbonyl, around δ 2.6 maybe? Or wait, in acetophenone, the methyl is a singlet around δ 2.6. But in some cases, if there's another substituent, perhaps the ring's coupling would change.

Wait, but in the structure I'm considering, the substituents are Br and COCH3 on the benzene ring.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons would be in certain regions.

In 4-bromoacetophenone, the ring would have two substituents in para positions: Br and COCH3. So the ring would have two sets of protons: the two H adjacent to the Br (ortho), and the two H adjacent to the COCH3 (ortho), and the two H in the meta positions. Wait, no, in para substitution, the substituents are opposite each other, so the protons adjacent to each substituent would be in certain positions.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the splitting. Alternatively, maybe it's a different structure. Let me think about the substituents again.

Alternatively, maybe one substituent is an acetyl group (COCH3) and the other is Cl.

So the molecule is di-substituted: one substituent is Cl, another is COCH3. Let's say the substituents are para to each other.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be in two sets: the protons ortho to Cl (which is an electron-withdrawing group, so they would be deshielded), and the protons ortho to COCH3 (also deshielded because COCH3 is also electron-withdrawing). The para protons to both substituents would be in between.

Wait, but in such a case, the aromatic protons would be two doublets. Because each substituent would cause the adjacent protons to split into doublets. Alternatively, maybe it's a more complex splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is such that the substituents are in such a way that the aromatic protons give a specific pattern.

Wait, looking at the NMR options:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s)

Option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s)

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s)

Option B seems to have peaks at 4.8 and 4.6, which are more like CH2 groups, perhaps adjacent to an oxygen, like an ether or ester.

Wait, but in our case, we're expecting a carbonyl group. So which options have a peak that could be a carbonyl-adjacent CH3?

Option A: 3.7 ppm, which is a singlet of 2H. That could be something like OCH2O (but I'm not sure). Or maybe an aromatic CH2 group.

Option C: 2.3 ppm, singlet of 3H. That's more like a CH3 attached to a carbonyl group, like COCH3. Because the CH3 next to a carbonyl typically appears around 2.1-2.6 ppm. So 2.3 seems about right. So in option C, the 2.3 (3H, s) would correspond to the CH3 of COCH3.

So the aromatic protons in option C are 7.8 (d) and 7.6 (d), each integrating to 2H. So that suggests two sets of two equivalent protons each. Which would happen if the substituents are in a para arrangement. So for example, in p-xylene, the protons are in two doublets. But in our case, the substituents are Br and COCH3. So the ring would have four protons in total: two ortho to Br, two ortho to COCH3. Each set would be a doublet.

Wait, but in a para-substituted benzene with two different substituents, each substituent would cause the adjacent protons to split into doublets. So if you have substituents in the para positions, each substituent's adjacent protons are in a pair. So in the case of para-substituted di-substituted benzene, you'll have two doublets in the aromatic region.

So that matches option C, where the aromatic region has two doublets each integrating to 2H. So the protons ortho to Br would be one doublet, and those ortho to COCH3 would be another, but in this case, perhaps the substituents are in such a way that the two doublets are each 2H.

Wait, but wait—in para substitution, the two substituents are on opposite positions. So the four ortho and para positions are filled. Wait, no, in a di-substituted benzene with substituents in para positions, the ring has four equivalent protons? Or not?

Wait, let me think. If the substituents are in para positions, the ring is symmetrical. So the two substituents are opposite each other. The protons adjacent to each substituent would be equivalent in pairs.

So for benzene with substituents A and B in para positions, the four ortho protons would be in two sets: two next to A, two next to B. But if A and B are different, then those two sets would be different, and thus split into two doublets.

So in the NMR, you would see two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that would match option C: 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). That suggests two doublets, each 2H.

Additionally, option C has a peak at 2.3 ppm integrating to 3H, which is likely the CH3 attached to the carbonyl group (COCH3). So that fits with the presence of the carbonyl group.

Looking at the other options:

Option A: The singlet at 9.9 ppm could be an aldehyde proton. But the question states that the carbonyl is present, which could be a ketone, aldehyde, etc. But an aldehyde would have a strong absorption in IR (stretching around 2820 and 2720 cm^-1 for the aldehyde C-H), but the FTIR here only mentions a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen. So perhaps it's a ketone, not an aldehyde. So option A's 9.9 ppm is probably an aldehyde, which may not fit.

Option B: Peaks at 4.8 and 4.6, which are likely for CH2 groups. Maybe in an acetal or something with two adjacent CH2 groups. But our compound has a carbonyl group, so if it's an ester, perhaps, but the substituent would be more complex. But I'm not sure how that fits with the carbonyl and aromatic substituents. Also, not seeing any aromatic protons in the right regions.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s) could be a para-substituted aromatic proton, but in a di-substituted ring with substituents in positions that leave one proton as a singlet, but that's less common. Alternatively, it could be a proton in a meta arrangement, but with some symmetry. The other peaks in D are 4.8 and 4.6, which again are like CH2 groups, similar to option B. So that doesn't fit with the COCH3 group.

So, putting it together, option C seems to fit the scenario where the substituents are a halogen (Br or Cl) and a COCH3 group, with the aromatic protons appearing as two doublets each integrating to 2H, and a singlet for the CH3 at 2.3 ppm.

Wait, but the FTIR also shows an aromatic-halogen bond. So the substituent must be an aromatic halogen, like Cl or Br attached directly to the ring. So in option C, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, which would be consistent with substituents in para positions. So that makes sense.

Therefore, the correct NMR should be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. This suggests the benzene ring has two substituents: one halogen (e.g., Br or Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group, such as a methyl ketone (-COCH₃). The total carbon count (8) confirms that the substituents contribute 2 carbons, consistent with the -COCH₃ group (2 carbons) and the halogen (0 carbons).

In the ¹H NMR spectrum, the aromatic protons adjacent to the substituents will split into doublets due to coupling with neighboring protons. For a para-substituted benzene, the protons ortho to the halogen and the protons ortho to the carbonyl group will each form a doublet, integrating to 2H each. Additionally, the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (CH₃ in -COCH₃) will appear as a singlet around 2.3 ppm.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: The singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton, which is inconsistent with the presence of a ketone (as indicated by the carbonyl group). This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggest CH₂ groups, which are not consistent with the expected structure. This option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: Peaks at 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d) correspond to the aromatic protons ortho to the halogen and the carbonyl group, respectively. The singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H) corresponds to the methyl group of the -COCH₃ group. This option matches the expected structure.
- **Option D**: The singlet at 6.9 ppm (1H) does not align with the expected aromatic splitting pattern for a para-substituted benzene. Additionally, peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggest CH₂ groups, which are inconsistent with the structure. This option is incorrect.

The correct ¹H NMR data is provided in **Option C**, as it matches the expected splitting pattern for a para-substituted benzene with a halogen and a -COCH₃ group.

The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. This suggests the benzene ring has two substituents: one halogen (e.g., Br or Cl) and a carbonyl-containing group, such as a methyl ketone (-COCH₃). The total carbon count (8) confirms that the substituents contribute 2 carbons, consistent with the -COCH₃ group (2 carbons) and the halogen (0 carbons).

In the ¹H NMR spectrum, the aromatic protons adjacent to the substituents will split into doublets due to coupling with neighboring protons. For a para-substituted benzene, the protons ortho to the halogen and the protons ortho to the carbonyl group will each form a doublet, integrating to 2H each. Additionally, the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (CH₃ in -COCH₃) will appear as a singlet around 2.3 ppm.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: The singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton, which is inconsistent with the presence of a ketone (as indicated by the carbonyl group). This option is incorrect.
- **Option B**: Peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggest CH₂ groups, which are not consistent with the expected structure. This option is incorrect.
- **Option C**: Peaks at 7.8 ppm (2H, d) and 7.6 ppm (2H, d) correspond to the aromatic protons ortho to the halogen and the carbonyl group, respectively. The singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H) corresponds to the methyl group of the -COCH₃ group. This option matches the expected structure.
- **Option D**: The singlet at 6.9 ppm (1H) does not align with the expected aromatic splitting pattern for a para-substituted benzene. Additionally, peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggest CH₂ groups, which are inconsistent with the structure. This option is incorrect.

The correct ¹H NMR data is provided in **Option C**, as it matches the expected splitting pattern for a para-substituted benzene with a halogen and a -COCH₃ group.

Answer: C
