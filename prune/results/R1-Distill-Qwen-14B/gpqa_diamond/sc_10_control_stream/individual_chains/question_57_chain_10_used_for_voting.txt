Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, let me recall what I know about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Oh right, in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed in terms of the partial wave expansion. The formula I remember is something like f(θ) equals the sum over l of (2l + 1)/(2k) times (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) times the Legendre polynomial P_l(cosθ). 

Wait, but wait. Legendre polynomials are involved here. The problem is asking about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh, right, the incident beam direction is when θ=0 degrees. So cosθ is 1 in that case.

So for θ=0, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because P_0(1)=1, P_1(1)=1, P_2(1)=1, etc. Wait, no, actually, isn't that correct? Because Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 are 1. Or wait, no, maybe not. Wait, P_0(x) is 1, P_1(x)=x, so at x=1, P_1 is 1. Similarly, P_2(x) is (3x²-1)/2, so at x=1, it's (3-1)/2=1. Oh, right, so all P_l(1) equal 1.

So then the scattering amplitude f(0) simplifies to the sum over l of (2l+1)/(2k) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * 1.

But the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So let's compute Im(f(0)).

Let's break this down. For each l, the term (2l+1)/(2k) is a real number. The other term is (e^{2iδ_l} - 1), which can be written in terms of its real and imaginary parts.

We know that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ. So e^{2iδ} -1 = cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ) -1. 

So the imaginary part of each term would be the imaginary part of (e^{2iδ} -1) multiplied by the real coefficient (2l+1)/(2k). Because when you sum terms to get the imaginary part, only the imaginary components from each term contribute.

So Im(f(0)) = sum over l of [ (2l+1)/(2k) ) * sin(2δ_l) ].

Wait, because the imaginary part of (e^{2iδ} -1) is sin(2δ), right? Because the imaginary part is sin(2δ), and real part is cos(2δ) -1.

So each term contributes [(2l +1)/(2k)] * sin(2δ_l). 

But wait, what about the specific l values given? The problem gives phase shifts δ_0=90°, δ_1=67°, δ_2=55°, δ_3=30°, δ_4=13°, and we're to ignore the rest. So l goes from 0 to 4 here.

So I'll need to compute each term for l=0,1,2,3,4.

But wait, what's the value of k? Because the formula has 1/(2k). Hmm, I think k is the wave number, which is related to the momentum of the electrons. The electrons have energy E=50 MeV, so I need to calculate k.

Electrons have rest mass m_e = 0.511 MeV/c². So the energy E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than the rest mass. So we can use the relativistic approximation for high energies. The momentum p is sqrt(2mE), where E is the kinetic energy, but wait, wait, maybe it's better to use the relation E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ) /c²? Hmm, perhaps I should think more carefully.

Wait, the energy of the electron is given as 50 MeV. So E = 50 MeV. The rest energy is m_e c² = 0.511 MeV. Since E >> m c², we can approximate p c ≈ sqrt( E² c^4 - (m c²)^2 ). Or, since E is in MeV, and m c² is 0.511 MeV, E is much larger, so p ≈ E / c. Because for high energies, relativistic electrons, the momentum p is approximately E/(c). 

But let me think about it. The relation is E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2. So p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c. But since E is 50 MeV and m c² is 0.511 MeV, E^2 is much larger than (m c²)^2, so we can approximate p ≈ E / c.

So for E = 50 MeV, p ≈ 50 MeV/c. Therefore, the wave number k is p/(ħ c). Wait, let's get the units right.

Wait, the wave number k is given by k = p/(ħ c) * c? Wait, no. The momentum p is in units of MeV/c. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm (since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm). So k = p / (ħ c). 

Wait, let me think. p is in MeV/c. ħ c is about 197.33 MeV·fm. So p/(ħ c) is (MeV/c) / (MeV·fm) * c ) → units are 1/fm. So k has units of 1/fm.

So p is approximately 50 MeV/c. So k = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) × c → Wait, no, let me compute it. 

Wait, p = E / c (approximate, since E >> m c²). So p = 50 MeV/c.

ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So k = p / (ħ c) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) → The MeV cancels, c in denominator and numerator would cancel, but wait, let's compute it.

Wait, p is 50 MeV/c. So p = 50 / (c) MeV. ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm. So k = (50 / c ) / (197.33 MeV·fm ) * c? Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it as:

k = p / (ħ c) = (p c) / (ħ c²) ) * c? Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to compute numerically.

Wait, let's compute p c: p is 50 MeV/c, so p c =50 MeV.

Then, ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm. So k = (p c) / (ħ c^2) ) * c? Wait, no, because k is p/(ħ c).

Wait, since p c = 50 MeV, and ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, then k = (p c) / (ħ c^2) ) * (c) → I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think in terms of units.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the relation k = (2mE)^{1/2}/ħ, but that's for non-relativistic cases. Wait, but I'm dealing with a relativistic electron here.

Hmm, perhaps I should use the relativistic formula for the de Broglie wavelength. The de Broglie wavelength λ is h / p. So λ = h / p. But h = 2π ħ, so λ = (2π ħ) / p. Then k = 2π / λ = p/( ħ ). So k = p / ħ. But p is in units of MeV/c. So let me make sure about the units.

Let me compute k numerically. Since p =50 MeV/c, and ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, but I'm getting mixed units. Let's convert everything into appropriate units.

Alternatively, considering that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, so 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1/(197.33 MeV·fm).

So p =50 MeV/c → k = p/(ħ c) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) → The MeV cancels, and c appears in the denominator. Wait, but 1 MeV/c divided by MeV·fm gives 1/(c fm). Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of natural units where c=1.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of natural units where c=1 and ħ=1. Then, p =50 MeV, and k = p =50 MeV^{-1} (since in natural units, k = p). Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the value numerically. Let me take the wave number k as approximately 50 / (197.33) ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, because 50 MeV / 197.33 MeV·fm = 50 / 197.33 per fm, which is about 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the units. Maybe it's better to proceed with the formula and see what comes out.

So going back, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is the sum over l of (2l+1)/(2k) * sin(2δ_l).

So for each l from 0 to 4, I'll compute (2l+1)/(2k) * sin(2δ_l), then sum all these.

Wait, but let's plug in the numbers.

First, let me compute 2k. Since k is approximately 0.253 fm^{-1}, 2k is 0.506 fm^{-1}.

Now, for each l and δ_l:

l=0: 2l+1 =1. δ=90°, so 2δ=180°, sin(180)=0. So this term is 1/(2k)*0=0.

l=1: 2l+1=3. δ=67°, 2δ=134°. sin(134) is sin(180-46)=sin(46)≈0.7193.

So term is (3)/(2k) * 0.7193.

l=2: 2l+1=5. δ=55°, 2δ=110°. sin(110)=sin(70)=≈0.9397. So term is 5/(2k) * 0.9397.

l=3: 2l+1=7. δ=30°, 2δ=60°. sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660. Term is 7/(2k) * 0.8660.

l=4: 2l+1=9. δ=13°, 2δ=26°. sin(26)≈0.4384. Term is 9/(2k) * 0.4384.

So now, compute each term:

First, let's compute 1/(2k) ≈ 1/(0.506) ≈ 1.976 fm.

Wait, because 1/(0.506) is approximately 1.976. So 1/(2k) is about 1.976 fm, but wait, 2k is 0.506 fm^{-1}, so 1/(2k) is (1 fm) / 0.506 ≈ 1.976 fm.

So for each term:

l=0: 1 * 1.976 * 0 = 0 fm.

l=1: 3 * 1.976 * 0.7193 ≈ 3 * 1.976 * 0.7193.

Let me compute 1.976 *0.7193 ≈ 1.425. Then multiply by 3: 4.275 fm.

l=2:5 *1.976 *0.9397.

1.976 *0.9397 ≈1.854. Multiply by 5: 9.27 fm.

l=3:7 *1.976 *0.8660.

1.976 *0.866≈1.717. Multiply by7: ~12.02 fm.

l=4:9 *1.976 *0.4384.

1.976 *0.4384≈0.866. Multiply by9: ~7.794 fm.

Now sum all these terms:

0 +4.275 +9.27 +12.02 +7.794 = let's compute step by step.

4.275 +9.27 =13.545.

13.545+12.02=25.565.

25.565+7.794=33.359 fm.

Wait, but wait a minute. The options given are much larger, like option A is 87163 fm, which is way bigger than my calculation. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me re-examine that.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation of k. Let me try that again.

The electron energy is E=50 MeV. The rest mass energy is 0.511 MeV, so E is much larger, so we can approximate the momentum as p ≈ E/c. But let me compute it accurately.

The correct relation is p c = sqrt( E² c^4 - (m c^2)^2 ). 

But since E is 50 MeV, much larger than m c^2 (0.511 MeV), we can approximate p c ≈ E. So p c =50 MeV.

So p =50 MeV / c.

But we need k, which is p/(ħ c). Because k = p/( ħ c ).

Wait, but let me get the units right.

ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm.

So p/( ħ c ) = (50 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV·fm ) * c.

Wait, no, because p has units of MeV/c, so p / ( ħ c ) would be (MeV/c) / ( MeV·fm ) ) → which is 1/( fm c ), but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of natural units where c=1 and ħ=1.

In natural units, ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, so when we set c=1, ħ=197.33 MeV·fm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute k in units of 1/fm.

So k = p/( ħ c ) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) → The MeV cancels, c in denominator and numerator (since p is in MeV/c), so the c's cancel, and we're left with 50/(197.33) per fm.

So 50/197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 2k is 0.506 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So that seems correct.

Hmm, but according to my earlier calculation, the sum of the terms is approximately 33.359 fm, but the options are way larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (2l +1) e^{2i δ_l} instead of (e^{2i δ_l} -1). No, the formula is (e^{2i δ} - 1). So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given in units of length (like the optical theorem), so perhaps I should consider that the imaginary part is actually Im(f) = (sum terms) * (ħ^2) or something. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, I might have missed a factor of ħ^2 somewhere. Let me think again about the formula.

The partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^infty (2l + 1)/(2k) [ e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ] P_l (cosθ)

But in terms of units, the amplitude f has units of length (since it's a scattering length). So each term in the sum must have units of length.

The term (2l +1)/(2k) has units of (dimensionless)/(1/length) ) → length.

So e^{2i δ} -1 is dimensionless, as is P_l.

So each term contributes correctly to f in units of length. So my calculation should be correct, but why am I getting 33 fm and the options are about 177 fm, etc.?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculation of the sum. Let me recompute the terms.

Let's recompute each term step by step.

Each term is (2l+1) * [ sin(2 δ_l) ] / (2k )

Wait, because the term is [ (2l+1)/(2k) ] * sin(2 δ_l )

So 2k is 0.506 fm^{-1} → 1/(2k) is approx 1.976 fm.

So for each l:

l=0: (2*0+1) * sin(180°) * 1.976 → 1 *0*1.976 → 0.

l=1: 3 * sin(134°) * 1.976.

sin(134°) is sin(180-46)=sin(46)=~0.7193.

So 3 *0.7193 *1.976.

Compute 3 *0.7193=2.1579.

2.1579 *1.976 ≈ let's compute:

1.976 *2 =3.952.

But 2.1579 is a bit more than 2. So 3.952 + 0.1579 *1.976.

Wait, 0.1579 *1.976 ≈ 0.312.

So total is approx 4.264 fm.

l=2: 5 * sin(110) *1.976.

sin(110) is sin(70)=0.9397.

5 * 0.9397 =4.6985.

4.6985 *1.976 ≈ approx 9.27 fm.

l=3:7 * sin(60) *1.976.

sin(60)=0.8660.

7 *0.8660=6.062.

6.062 *1.976 ≈12.02 fm.

l=4:9 * sin(26) *1.976.

sin(26)=0.4384.

9 *0.4384=3.9456.

3.9456 *1.976 ≈7.795 fm.

Adding all terms: 0 +4.264 +9.27 +12.02 +7.795.

Compute 4.264 +9.27 =13.534.

13.534 +12.02=25.554.

25.554 +7.795=33.349 fm.

Hmm, that's about 33.35 fm. But the options are much higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula for k. Let me think again.

The wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ, but that's for non-relativistic. But since the electron is relativistic, that formula wouldn't apply. But in our earlier approach, we used k = p/(ħ c), with p≈E/c.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate k more accurately.

Let me compute p exactly. Since E=50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV/c².

The relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 )

So (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2.

E=50 MeV, m c^2=0.511 MeV.

So (pc)^2 = (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈ 2500 (MeV)^2.

So pc = 50 MeV → p = 50 MeV/c.

So k = p/(ħ c) = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ c )

But ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm.

So k = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) → The MeV cancels, and 1/c divided by fm → so units are 1/(fm c).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, perhaps I should take into account that ħ is in units of J·s, but perhaps it's easier to use natural units where c=1 and ħ=1. But perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the wave number k is given by k = (2mE)^1/2 / ħ, but that's for non-relativistic. But in relativistic case, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the Compton wavelength of the electron, which is ħ/(m c). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute k in terms of the de Broglie wavelength. The de Broglie wavelength λ is h/(p), where h is Planck's constant. Since p =50 MeV/c, then:

λ = h/(p) = (6.626e-34 Js) / (50e6 eV / (3e8 m/s) ) )

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me compute it numerically.

But perhaps this is getting too involved, and I might be missing a key point here. Let's think about the options given.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for Im(f). Because another way to compute Im(f(0)) is using the optical theorem, which says that the total cross-section is (4π/ k^2) * Im(f) averaged over angles. But wait, but the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the beam direction, not the total cross-section.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach for the amplitude. Maybe the imaginary part of the amplitude is directly sum(l) [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ].

Wait, but that can't be right because units wouldn't match. Because (2l+1) is dimensionless, and sin(2δ_l) is dimensionless, so the sum would be dimensionless, but the imaginary part of f has units of length.

So maybe I missed a factor of 1/(2k), as in the formula. So perhaps my earlier approach is correct, but the problem is that I've computed the sum correctly and the options don't match. But the options are much bigger, like option C is 177 fm. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the sum.

Wait, let's recalculate the sum.

Each term is (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l) / (2k)

But 2k is 0.506 fm^{-1}, so 1/(2k) is 1.976 fm.

So for l=1:

3 * sin(134) *1.976.

Sin 134 is about 0.7193.

3 * 0.7193 =2.1579.

2.1579 *1.976 → let's compute 2 *1.976=3.952.

Then 0.1579 *1.976 ≈ 0.312. So total is 4.264 fm.

l=2:5 * sin(110) *1.976.

Sin110=0.9397.

5 *0.9397=4.6985.

4.6985 *1.976 → let me compute 4 *1.976=7.904, 0.6985 *1.976≈1.381. So total ≈9.285 fm.

l=3:7 * sin60 *1.976.

Sin60=0.8660.

7 *0.866=6.062.

6.062 *1.976 → 6 *1.976=11.856, 0.062*1.976≈0.122. So total ≈11.978 fm.

l=4:9 * sin26 *1.976.

Sin26 ≈0.4384.

9 *0.4384=3.9456.

3.9456 *1.976 → let's compute:

3.9456 *2=7.8912, but since it's 1.976, which is 0.024 less than 2.

So 7.8912 - 3.9456 *0.024 → 3.9456 *0.024≈0.0947. So 7.8912 -0.0947≈7.7965 fm.

Now sum all terms:

l=0:0

l=1:4.264

l=2:9.285

l=3:11.978

l=4:7.7965

Adding up:

4.264 +9.285 =13.549

13.549 +11.978 =25.527

25.527 +7.7965=33.3235 fm.

Hmm, same result as before. So about 33.32 fm.

But the options are way higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the scattering amplitude f has a factor of 1/(2k) for each term, but maybe the actual formula includes a factor of (2l +1) times (e^{2iδ} -1) times (1/(2k)).

Wait, but that's what I used. So why is the result not matching any option?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude includes a factor of (1/k) somewhere else, not just in each term.

Wait, let me think again. The full formula is f(θ) = sum_l (2l+1)/(2k) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ)

So the imaginary part is sum_l (2l+1)/(2k) [ sin(2 δ_l) ] P_l (cosθ).

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so the sum is as I calculated.

Hmm, but the options are way higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me recompute k correctly.

Electron energy E=50 MeV.

The correct way to calculate k is:

k = (E² - m² c^4 )^(1/2) / (ħ c) )

But since E is much larger than m c², E² >> m² c^4, so k ≈ E / (ħ c)

Wait, but E is in MeV, and ħ c is about 197.33 MeV·fm.

So k ≈ (50 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → 50 /197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 2k is 0.506 fm^{-1}, as before.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (1/(2k)) * (ħ^2 / (2m)) ), but I'm not sure. Or perhaps I'm missing a factor related to the reduced mass or something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude includes a factor of (m_e c^2)^2/(2 E), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, but the problem is that the wave number k is expressed in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for k. Let me think about the units again.

The wave number k has units of inverse length (like 1/fm).

In the formula, 2k is in 1/fm, and each term is (2l+1)/(2k) * sin(2δ_l), which gives units of length (fm).

So that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe I should compute the sum again, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Let me compute each term:

l=1: 3 * sin(134 degrees) = 3 * 0.7193 = 2.1579.

Multiply by 1.976 → 2.1579 * 1.976 → 4.264 fm.

l=2:5 *0.9397=4.6985.

4.6985 *1.976 → 4 *1.976=7.904; 0.6985 *1.976= ~1.381.

Total 7.904 +1.381=9.285 fm.

l=3:7 *0.8660=6.062.

6.062 *1.976 = 6 *1.976=11.856; 0.062 *1.976≈0.122.

Total 11.978 fm.

l=4:9 *0.4384=3.9456.

3.9456 *1.976 → 3.9456 *2=7.8912 minus 3.9456 *0.024=0.0947 → 7.8912 -0.0947=7.7965 fm.

Sum: 4.264 +9.285=13.549; +11.978=25.527; +7.7965=33.3235 fm.

Hmm, same as before.

But the options are much higher. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the phase shifts are given in radians, not degrees. But the question states the phase shifts are in degrees. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum ... ?

Ah! Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake in the initial formula. I think the correct formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ )

So the factor is (1/(2ik)), not (1/(2k)).

Ah, that's probably where I went wrong.

So, the correct formula is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty [ (2l+1)/(2ik) ) ] (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) P_l (cosθ )

So the imaginary part would be Im(f) = sum [ (2l+1)/(2k) ) * sin(2δ_l) ] / i * P_l (cosθ )

Wait, no. Let's compute Im(f) correctly.

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ} -1 ] P_l (cosθ )

So each term is (2l+1) [ (e^{2iδ} -1) ] P_l (cosθ ) / (2ik )

The imaginary part of f(θ) would be the sum of the imaginary parts of each term.

The term is [ (2l+1) [ (e^{2iδ} -1) ] P_l ] / (2ik )

But since k is real and positive, and in the denominator 2ik is imaginary, the denominator is imaginary.

So, the term becomes (2l+1) [ (e^{2iδ} -1) ] P_l / (2ik )

The imaginary part of this term is the imaginary part of the numerator multiplied by 1/(2ik), which is a real negative number because 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write 1/(2ik) as [ -i/(2k) ]

So, the term is (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ} -1 ] P_l (cosθ ) * (-i/(2k) )

= (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ) ) -1 ] P_l (cosθ ) * (-i/(2k) )

= (2l+1)/(2k) [ (cos(2δ) -1 ) + i sin(2δ) ] * (-i) P_l (cosθ )

= (2l+1)/(2k) [ ( -i (cos(2δ) -1 ) ) - i^2 sin(2δ) ) ] P_l (cosθ )

Since i^2 = -1:

= (2l+1)/(2k) [ -i (cos2δ -1) + sin(2δ) ] P_l (cosθ )

The imaginary part of this term is the coefficient of i. So:

Imaginary part = (2l+1)/(2k) [ - (cos(2δ) -1) ] * P_l(cosθ )

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because earlier when I summed the terms, I get a value around 33 fm, but the options suggest a larger value. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think again. The correct formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = sum_l [ (2l+1)/(2k) ) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l (cosθ) ]

But this is only correct when k is multiplied by i, perhaps. Oh, wait, I remember now. The correct formula is f(θ) = sum_l [ (2l+1)/(2ik) ) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l (cosθ) ]

Because in quantum mechanics, the scattering amplitude often has a factor of 1/k, and in the relativistic case, the wave number is imaginary? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_l (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ )

The imaginary part of this would then be:

Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum_l (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) P_l (cosθ )

Because the exponential term is (e^{iθ} -1) which when expanded gives terms with sine.

So, at θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_l (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

Wait, but earlier I had (1/(2k)) as 1.976 fm. So each term is (2l+1)*sin(2δ_l) * (1/(2k)).

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So why is the result not matching the options?

Wait, perhaps the factor is (1/k) instead of (1/(2k)). Let me check the formula again.

Looking up the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude:

The correct formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum_l (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ )

Ah! So I was wrong earlier; the factor is (1/k), not (1/(2k)).

Oh no, this changes everything. Because previously I used (1/(2k)), but the correct factor is (1/k).

So that's where I made the mistake.

So the correct formula for Im(f(0)) is sum_l (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l) * (1/k )

Because 1/k is real, and for each term, the imaginary part comes from the sine term.

So now, let me recompute with this correction.

k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

1/k ≈ 3.953 fm.

Now, compute the sum again:

l=0: 1 * sin(180) → 0 → term=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134) =3 *0.7193=2.1579.

Multiply by 1/k=3.953 → 2.1579 *3.953 ≈8.50 fm.

l=2:5 * sin(110) →5 *0.9397=4.6985.

4.6985 *3.953 ≈18.51 fm.

l=3:7 * sin(60) →7 *0.866=6.062.

6.062 *3.953 ≈23.94 fm.

l=4:9 * sin(26) →9 *0.4384=3.9456.

3.9456 *3.953 ≈15.58 fm.

Now sum all the terms:

l=0:0

l=1:8.50

l=2:18.51 → sum 27.01.

l=3:23.94 → sum 50.95.

l=4:15.58 → sum 66.53 fm.

Hmm, that's about 66.53 fm. But the options are 87163 fm (option A), 355.35 fm (option B), 177.67 fm (option C), 251.27 fm (option D).

Still not matching. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is sum_l (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * ħ^2/(2m) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should include the factor of 2 from the denominator correction. Wait, earlier I thought the formula was (1/k), but perhaps it's (1/(2k)).

Wait, confusion arises. Let me look up the correct formula.

Upon checking, the correct partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ )

So, the factor is (1/k), not 1/(2k). So the earlier correction was correct.

So, the sum is 66.53 fm. But the options are much higher. So I must have made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, wait a second. Let me re-express k correctly. If E is 50 MeV, and m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, then (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2.

So, pc = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2) ≈50 MeV.

So p =50 MeV/c.

Then, k = p/(ħ c) = (50 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm )

So 50/197.33 ≈0.253 → 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈3.953 fm.

So the sum is approximately 66.53 fm.

But the options are 177.675 fm (option C), which is about twice that.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts. Let me check the given phase shifts.

The phase shifts given are δ_0=90°, δ_1=67°, δ_2=55°, δ_3=30°, δ_4=13°. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (1/k), and not (1/(2k)).

Wait, but the formula says (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l), which is what I did.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should include all phase shifts up to l=4, but perhaps the problem says to ignore the rest beyond l=4, which I did.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians. But the question says they are in degrees, so they are correct as given.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Let me recompute the sum with accurate numbers.

Compute each term:

l=1:3 * sin(134) →3 * 0.7193 =2.1579.

Multiply by 3.953 → 2.1579 *3.953.

Let me compute 2 *3.953=7.906.

0.1579 *3.953 → approximately 0.624.

Total 7.906 +0.624=8.53 fm.

l=2:5 *0.9397=4.6985.

4.6985 *3.953 → compute 4 *3.953=15.812, 0.6985 *3.953≈2.749.

Total 15.812+2.749=18.561 fm.

l=3:7 *0.866=6.062.

6.062 *3.953 → 6 *3.953=23.718, 0.062 *3.953≈0.245. So total 23.718+0.245=23.963 fm.

l=4:9 *0.4384=3.9456.

3.9456 *3.953 →3 *3.953=11.859, 0.9456 *3.953≈3.729.

Total 11.859 +3.729=15.588 fm.

Now sum all terms:

8.53 +18.561 =27.091.

27.091 +23.963=51.054.

51.054 +15.588=66.642 fm.

Still about 66.64 fm.

But the options don't have this number. The closest is option C:177.675 fm, which is about 2.67 times higher.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me think.

Another approach: Perhaps I should compute k correctly in terms of E.

The correct formula for the wave number k is:

k = sqrt( (2mE) ) / ħ,

Wait, but that's for non-relativistic. Since E is 50 MeV, much larger than m c², perhaps relativistic corrections are needed. Alternatively, perhaps the wave number in the relativistic case is given by:

k = (E c) / ħ c^2 ) → No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute k using the momentum p and the relation k = p/(ħ c).

Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the value of k in terms of 1/(fm), but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Another approach: The Compton wavelength of the electron is λ_c = ħ/(m_e c) ≈ 2.426e-12 m = 0.2426 fm.

So 1/(m_e c) = ħ/(λ_c) → but perhaps this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute k as (E)/(ħ c).

E=50 MeV.

ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

So k=50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → 50/197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is (1/(2ik)) sum..., which would make the imaginary part different.

Wait, let me try that.

So f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ )

So Im(f(θ)) = Im( (1/(2ik)) sum ... )

The term 1/(2ik) is -i/(2k).

So each term becomes -i/(2k) * (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l.

The imaginary part of this is the real part of [ (2l+1)/(2k) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l ] multiplied by i, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of the term is (2l+1)/(2k) * sin(2δ_l) * P_l.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier, leading to about 33 fm.

So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Im(f) = sum_l (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (ħ^2 )/(2m c^2) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the factor is (m c^2)^2/(2 E), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the reduced mass, but since the target is a nucleus, perhaps it's a heavy nucleus, so the reduced mass μ ≈ m_e.

But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to choose the closest option to my earlier result.

Wait, my initial result with the correct formula (sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (1/k) ) is about 66.6 fm. But the options don't have that. The closest is option C: 177.675 fm, which is about 2.67 times higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 1/k.

Wait, let me recompute 1/k.

k = 0.253 fm^{-1} → 1/k ≈3.953 fm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

k =50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) =50/197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k=3.953 fm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula uses 1/(k) multiplied by (2l+1) and sin(2δ_l), but including a factor of 2.

Wait, the initial formula I used after correction was Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (1/k )

But perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (1/(2k) )

Which would give Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (1/(2k) )

In that case, 1/(2k)=1.976 fm.

So for each term:

l=1:3 *0.7193 *1.976=4.264 fm.

l=2:5 *0.9397 *1.976=9.285 fm.

l=3:7 *0.866 *1.976=12.02 fm.

l=4:9 *0.4384 *1.976=7.796 fm.

Sum: 4.264 +9.285=13.549 +12.02=25.569 +7.796=33.365 fm.

Which is about 33.365 fm. Still not matching any option.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of the amplitude is (sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ) * ħ^2/(2 m c^2 )

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = sum_l (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (1/(2k) )

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct Im(f) is sum_l (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (1/k) * (ħ c )^2/(2m c^2 )

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the amplitude in the Born approximation, but that's unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 177.675 fm, which is about twice my initial 88.8 fm.

Wait, perhaps I should include all the phase shifts up to l=4, but I think I did that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 1/k.

Wait, perhaps the correct value of k is 0.1265 fm^{-1}, which would give 1/k=7.90 fm.

Then, sum would be 33.365 *2=66.73 fm. Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things, and the correct answer is option C: 177.675 fm, which is approximately 2.67 times my initial 66.6 fm.

But I can't see how to get that factor.

Wait, perhaps I should multiply the sum by 2.67, but I don't know why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the wave number k. Let me think again.

Wait, the wave number k is given by:

k = sqrt( (2mE)/(ħ^2) )

But that's for non-relativistic. Since E is 50 MeV, which is relativistic, this formula wouldn't apply.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k using relativistic energy:

E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

So, p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

Using E=50 MeV, m c^2=0.511 MeV.

So p = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) / c ≈50 MeV/c.

Then, k = p/(ħ c ) = (50 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm ) = 50/(197.33) ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So, same as before.

I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but considering the options, the closest I have is 33.365 fm, which isn't present. So perhaps the correct approach is to re-examine the initial formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of the amplitude is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (2k) )

But that brings us back to 33.365 fm, which doesn't match any option.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is 5.32 times my initial sum of 33.365 fm. I'm not sure why that would be.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (ħ^2)/(2m c^2) ), which would require calculating with actual physical constants.

Let me compute that.

Compute (ħ c )^2 = (197.33 MeV fm )^2 = (197.33 )^2 (MeV^2 fm^2 )

m c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

So (ħ c )^2/(2 m c^2 ) = (197.33^2 ) / (2 * 0.511 ) MeV fm^2 / MeV → (197.33^2 )/(1.022 ) fm.

Compute 197.33^2 = approx (200)^2 =40000, minus 2*200*2.67 + (2.67)^2 → wait, 197.33 is approximately 200 -2.67.

So 197.33^2 ≈ (200 -2.67)^2 =200^2 - 2*200*2.67 + (2.67)^2 →40000 - 1068 +7.1289≈38940.1289.

So (38940.1289) / (1.022 ) ≈38108.7 fm.

Now, compute sum_l (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ):

sum = 0 (l=0) + 3*0.7193 (l=1) +5*0.9397 (l=2) +7*0.866 (l=3) +9*0.4384 (l=4)

Compute each:

3*0.7193=2.1579

5*0.9397=4.6985

7*0.866=6.062

9*0.4384=3.9456

Sum: 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

So sum=16.864.

Then, multiply by (ħ c )^2/(2 m c^2 )=38108.7 fm.

So 16.864 *38108.7 fm → 16.864 *38108.7 ≈643,630 fm.

But that's way larger than the options.

Hmm, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula uses (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) multiplied by (ħ^2)/(2m), which would give units of length.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = sum (2l+1)/(2k) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ )

Which would imply that the imaginary part is sum (2l+1)/(2k) sin(2δ_l) * P_l (cosθ )

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (2k )

Which is what I did earlier, giving about 33.365 fm.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is exactly twice my initial result.

So perhaps the correct factor is (1/k), not (1/(2k)), which would give 66.6 fm, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the correct factor is (1/k) * (m_e c^2)/(E), because sometimes in relativistic calculations, you have factors involving the rest energy.

So let's compute (1/k) * (0.511 MeV)/(50 MeV) =3.953 fm * (0.01022) ≈0.0404 fm.

So Im(f) = sum terms * 0.0404.

Which would bring the sum down to about 33.365 *0.0404 ≈1.35 fm. Which is even smaller.

Hmm, not matching any option.

At this point, I'm really stuck. I'll have to make a guess based on the options provided. Given my earlier sum of 33.365 fm, which is close to option C being roughly twice that, but it doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula, and the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for Im(f) is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (ħ^2)/(2m c^2 ), which would give:

sum=16.864.

(ħ c )^2/(2m c^2 ) = (197.33^2 )/(2 *0.511 ) fm.

Wait, (197.33)^2 is about 38940.

38940/(2*0.511)=38940/(1.022)≈38108 fm.

So 16.864 *38108 ≈642,993 fm. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (ħ^2)/(2m), but that would be in fm.

But I'm not confident.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the sum as (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (2k ), but with k in a different unit.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that the wave number k is in units of 1/(fm), but the formula requires it in a different unit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses k = (m c^2)/(ħ c ) * E → but that doesn't make sense.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Given the options, the closest I can get is around 66.6 fm, but that's not an option. Therefore, the most plausible answer from the options provided, perhaps due to a miscalculation in the problem statement or a different approach, is option C:177.675 fm.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the partial wave expansion formula for the scattering amplitude:

\[
f(θ) = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{(2l + 1)}{2k} \left(e^{2i\delta_l} - 1\right) P_l(\cosθ),
\]

where \(P_l(\cosθ)\) is the Legendre polynomial, \(k\) is the wave number, and \(\delta_l\) are the phase shifts. At \(\theta = 0\), \(P_l(1) = 1\), simplifying the expression for the imaginary part of \(f(0)\) to:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{(2l + 1)}{2k} \sin(2\delta_l).
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \(k\)
The wave number \(k\) is related to the electron's momentum \(p\) and energy \(E = 50 \, \text{MeV}\). Using the relativistic relation \(p \approx E/c\) for high-energy electrons and \(k = p / (\hbar c)\), where \(\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}\), we find:

\[
k = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

Thus, \(1/(2k) \approx 1.976 \, \text{fm}\).

### Step 2: Compute the contributions from each \(l\)
The phase shifts are given as \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). For each \(l\), the contribution to \(\text{Im}(f(0))\) is:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0))_l = \frac{(2l + 1)}{2k} \sin(2\delta_l).
\]

#### For \(l = 0\):
\[
\text{Im}(f(0))_0 = \frac{1}{2k} \sin(180^\circ) = 0.
\]

#### For \(l = 1\):
\[
\text{Im}(f(0))_1 = \frac{3}{2k} \sin(134^\circ) \approx \frac{3}{0.506} \cdot 0.7193 \approx 4.264 \, \text{fm}.
\]

#### For \(l = 2\):
\[
\text{Im}(f(0))_2 = \frac{5}{2k} \sin(110^\circ) \approx \frac{5}{0.506} \cdot 0.9397 \approx 9.285 \, \text{fm}.
\]

#### For \(l = 3\):
\[
\text{Im}(f(0))_3 = \frac{7}{2k} \sin(60^\circ) \approx \frac{7}{0.506} \cdot 0.8660 \approx 12.02 \, \text{fm}.
\]

#### For \(l = 4\):
\[
\text{Im}(f(0))_4 = \frac{9}{2k} \sin(26^\circ) \approx \frac{9}{0.506} \cdot 0.4384 \approx 7.796 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 3: Sum the contributions
Adding the contributions from all \(l\):

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = 0 + 4.264 + 9.285 + 12.02 + 7.796 \approx 33.365 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated value of \(33.365 \, \text{fm}\) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **C) 177.675 fm**, which is approximately \(2.67 \times 33.365 \, \text{fm}\). This discrepancy may arise from missing factors in the problem setup or differences in the interpretation of the formula.

### Final Answer:
Based on the given options and the calculations, the most plausible answer is:

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. The question gives me some phase shifts and asks me to calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, let me recall what I know about scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Oh right, in scattering theory, the scattering amplitude f(θ) can be expressed in terms of the partial wave expansion. The formula I remember is something like f(θ) equals the sum over l of (2l + 1)/(2k) times (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) times the Legendre polynomial P_l(cosθ). 

Wait, but wait. Legendre polynomials are involved here. The problem is asking about the imaginary part along the incident beam direction. Oh, right, the incident beam direction is when θ=0 degrees. So cosθ is 1 in that case.

So for θ=0, the Legendre polynomial P_l(1) is 1 for all l, because P_0(1)=1, P_1(1)=1, P_2(1)=1, etc. Wait, no, actually, isn't that correct? Because Legendre polynomials evaluated at 1 are 1. Or wait, no, maybe not. Wait, P_0(x) is 1, P_1(x)=x, so at x=1, P_1 is 1. Similarly, P_2(x) is (3x²-1)/2, so at x=1, it's (3-1)/2=1. Oh, right, so all P_l(1) equal 1.

So then the scattering amplitude f(0) simplifies to the sum over l of (2l+1)/(2k) * (e^{2iδ_l} - 1) * 1.

But the question is about the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude. So let's compute Im(f(0)).

Let's break this down. For each l, the term (2l+1)/(2k) is a real number. The other term is (e^{2iδ_l} - 1), which can be written in terms of its real and imaginary parts.

We know that e^{iθ} = cosθ + i sinθ. So e^{2iδ} -1 = cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ) -1. 

So the imaginary part of each term would be the imaginary part of (e^{2iδ} -1) multiplied by the real coefficient (2l+1)/(2k). Because when you sum terms to get the imaginary part, only the imaginary components from each term contribute.

So Im(f(0)) = sum over l of [ (2l+1)/(2k) ) * sin(2δ_l) ].

Wait, because the imaginary part of (e^{2iδ} -1) is sin(2δ), right? Because the imaginary part is sin(2δ), and real part is cos(2δ) -1.

So each term contributes [(2l +1)/(2k)] * sin(2δ_l). 

But wait, what about the specific l values given? The problem gives phase shifts δ_0=90°, δ_1=67°, δ_2=55°, δ_3=30°, δ_4=13°, and we're to ignore the rest. So l goes from 0 to 4 here.

So I'll need to compute each term for l=0,1,2,3,4.

But wait, what's the value of k? Because the formula has 1/(2k). Hmm, I think k is the wave number, which is related to the momentum of the electrons. The electrons have energy E=50 MeV, so I need to calculate k.

Electrons have rest mass m_e = 0.511 MeV/c². So the energy E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than the rest mass. So we can use the relativistic approximation for high energies. The momentum p is sqrt(2mE), where E is the kinetic energy, but wait, wait, maybe it's better to use the relation E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ) /c²? Hmm, perhaps I should think more carefully.

Wait, the energy of the electron is given as 50 MeV. So E = 50 MeV. The rest energy is m_e c² = 0.511 MeV. Since E >> m c², we can approximate p c ≈ sqrt( E² c^4 - (m c²)^2 ). Or, since E is in MeV, and m c² is 0.511 MeV, E is much larger, so p ≈ E / c. Because for high energies, relativistic electrons, the momentum p is approximately E/(c). 

But let me think about it. The relation is E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So (pc)^2 = E² - (m c²)^2. So p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c. But since E is 50 MeV and m c² is 0.511 MeV, E^2 is much larger than (m c²)^2, so we can approximate p ≈ E / c.

So for E = 50 MeV, p ≈ 50 MeV/c. Therefore, the wave number k is p/(ħ c). Wait, let's get the units right.

Wait, the wave number k is given by k = p/(ħ c) * c? Wait, no. The momentum p is in units of MeV/c. Planck's constant ħ is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm (since ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm). So k = p / (ħ c). 

Wait, let me think. p is in MeV/c. ħ c is about 197.33 MeV·fm. So p/(ħ c) is (MeV/c) / (MeV·fm) * c ) → units are 1/fm. So k has units of 1/fm.

So p is approximately 50 MeV/c. So k = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) × c → Wait, no, let me compute it. 

Wait, p = E / c (approximate, since E >> m c²). So p = 50 MeV/c.

ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm.

So k = p / (ħ c) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) → The MeV cancels, c in denominator and numerator would cancel, but wait, let's compute it.

Wait, p is 50 MeV/c. So p = 50 / (c) MeV. ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm. So k = (50 / c ) / (197.33 MeV·fm ) * c? Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it as:

k = p / (ħ c) = (p c) / (ħ c²) ) * c? Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to compute numerically.

Wait, let's compute p c: p is 50 MeV/c, so p c =50 MeV.

Then, ħ c is 197.33 MeV·fm. So k = (p c) / (ħ c^2) ) * c? Wait, no, because k is p/(ħ c).

Wait, since p c = 50 MeV, and ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, then k = (p c) / (ħ c^2) ) * (c) → I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think in terms of units.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use the relation k = (2mE)^{1/2}/ħ, but that's for non-relativistic cases. Wait, but I'm dealing with a relativistic electron here.

Hmm, perhaps I should use the relativistic formula for the de Broglie wavelength. The de Broglie wavelength λ is h / p. So λ = h / p. But h = 2π ħ, so λ = (2π ħ) / p. Then k = 2π / λ = p/( ħ ). So k = p / ħ. But p is in units of MeV/c. So let me make sure about the units.

Let me compute k numerically. Since p =50 MeV/c, and ħ is approximately 6.582×10^-25 GeV·s. Wait, but I'm getting mixed units. Let's convert everything into appropriate units.

Alternatively, considering that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV·fm, so 1/(ħ c) ≈ 1/(197.33 MeV·fm).

So p =50 MeV/c → k = p/(ħ c) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) → The MeV cancels, and c appears in the denominator. Wait, but 1 MeV/c divided by MeV·fm gives 1/(c fm). Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of natural units where c=1.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of natural units where c=1 and ħ=1. Then, p =50 MeV, and k = p =50 MeV^{-1} (since in natural units, k = p). Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the value numerically. Let me take the wave number k as approximately 50 / (197.33) ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, because 50 MeV / 197.33 MeV·fm = 50 / 197.33 per fm, which is about 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

But wait, I'm not entirely sure about the units. Maybe it's better to proceed with the formula and see what comes out.

So going back, the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is the sum over l of (2l+1)/(2k) * sin(2δ_l).

So for each l from 0 to 4, I'll compute (2l+1)/(2k) * sin(2δ_l), then sum all these.

Wait, but let's plug in the numbers.

First, let me compute 2k. Since k is approximately 0.253 fm^{-1}, 2k is 0.506 fm^{-1}.

Now, for each l and δ_l:

l=0: 2l+1 =1. δ=90°, so 2δ=180°, sin(180)=0. So this term is 1/(2k)*0=0.

l=1: 2l+1=3. δ=67°, 2δ=134°. sin(134) is sin(180-46)=sin(46)≈0.7193.

So term is (3)/(2k) * 0.7193.

l=2: 2l+1=5. δ=55°, 2δ=110°. sin(110)=sin(70)=≈0.9397. So term is 5/(2k) * 0.9397.

l=3: 2l+1=7. δ=30°, 2δ=60°. sin(60)=√3/2≈0.8660. Term is 7/(2k) * 0.8660.

l=4: 2l+1=9. δ=13°, 2δ=26°. sin(26)≈0.4384. Term is 9/(2k) * 0.4384.

So now, compute each term:

First, let's compute 1/(2k) ≈ 1/(0.506) ≈ 1.976 fm.

Wait, because 1/(0.506) is approximately 1.976. So 1/(2k) is about 1.976 fm, but wait, 2k is 0.506 fm^{-1}, so 1/(2k) is (1 fm) / 0.506 ≈ 1.976 fm.

So for each term:

l=0: 1 * 1.976 * 0 = 0 fm.

l=1: 3 * 1.976 * 0.7193 ≈ 3 * 1.976 * 0.7193.

Let me compute 1.976 *0.7193 ≈ 1.425. Then multiply by 3: 4.275 fm.

l=2:5 *1.976 *0.9397.

1.976 *0.9397 ≈1.854. Multiply by 5: 9.27 fm.

l=3:7 *1.976 *0.8660.

1.976 *0.866≈1.717. Multiply by7: ~12.02 fm.

l=4:9 *1.976 *0.4384.

1.976 *0.4384≈0.866. Multiply by9: ~7.794 fm.

Now sum all these terms:

0 +4.275 +9.27 +12.02 +7.794 = let's compute step by step.

4.275 +9.27 =13.545.

13.545+12.02=25.565.

25.565+7.794=33.359 fm.

Wait, but wait a minute. The options given are much larger, like option A is 87163 fm, which is way bigger than my calculation. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me re-examine that.

Wait, I think I messed up the calculation of k. Let me try that again.

The electron energy is E=50 MeV. The rest mass energy is 0.511 MeV, so E is much larger, so we can approximate the momentum as p ≈ E/c. But let me compute it accurately.

The correct relation is p c = sqrt( E² c^4 - (m c^2)^2 ). 

But since E is 50 MeV, much larger than m c^2 (0.511 MeV), we can approximate p c ≈ E. So p c =50 MeV.

So p =50 MeV / c.

But we need k, which is p/(ħ c). Because k = p/( ħ c ).

Wait, but let me get the units right.

ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm.

So p/( ħ c ) = (50 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV·fm ) * c.

Wait, no, because p has units of MeV/c, so p / ( ħ c ) would be (MeV/c) / ( MeV·fm ) ) → which is 1/( fm c ), but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of natural units where c=1 and ħ=1.

In natural units, ħ c = 197.33 MeV·fm, so when we set c=1, ħ=197.33 MeV·fm.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute k in units of 1/fm.

So k = p/( ħ c ) = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) → The MeV cancels, c in denominator and numerator (since p is in MeV/c), so the c's cancel, and we're left with 50/(197.33) per fm.

So 50/197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 2k is 0.506 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So that seems correct.

Hmm, but according to my earlier calculation, the sum of the terms is approximately 33.359 fm, but the options are way larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the formula uses (2l +1) e^{2i δ_l} instead of (e^{2i δ_l} -1). No, the formula is (e^{2i δ} - 1). So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the scattering amplitude f(θ) is given in units of length (like the optical theorem), so perhaps I should consider that the imaginary part is actually Im(f) = (sum terms) * (ħ^2) or something. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, I might have missed a factor of ħ^2 somewhere. Let me think again about the formula.

The partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^infty (2l + 1)/(2k) [ e^{2i δ_l} - 1 ] P_l (cosθ)

But in terms of units, the amplitude f has units of length (since it's a scattering length). So each term in the sum must have units of length.

The term (2l +1)/(2k) has units of (dimensionless)/(1/length) ) → length.

So e^{2i δ} -1 is dimensionless, as is P_l.

So each term contributes correctly to f in units of length. So my calculation should be correct, but why am I getting 33 fm and the options are about 177 fm, etc.?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in calculation of the sum. Let me recompute the terms.

Let's recompute each term step by step.

Each term is (2l+1) * [ sin(2 δ_l) ] / (2k )

Wait, because the term is [ (2l+1)/(2k) ] * sin(2 δ_l )

So 2k is 0.506 fm^{-1} → 1/(2k) is approx 1.976 fm.

So for each l:

l=0: (2*0+1) * sin(180°) * 1.976 → 1 *0*1.976 → 0.

l=1: 3 * sin(134°) * 1.976.

sin(134°) is sin(180-46)=sin(46)=~0.7193.

So 3 *0.7193 *1.976.

Compute 3 *0.7193=2.1579.

2.1579 *1.976 ≈ let's compute:

1.976 *2 =3.952.

But 2.1579 is a bit more than 2. So 3.952 + 0.1579 *1.976.

Wait, 0.1579 *1.976 ≈ 0.312.

So total is approx 4.264 fm.

l=2: 5 * sin(110) *1.976.

sin(110) is sin(70)=0.9397.

5 * 0.9397 =4.6985.

4.6985 *1.976 ≈ approx 9.27 fm.

l=3:7 * sin(60) *1.976.

sin(60)=0.8660.

7 *0.8660=6.062.

6.062 *1.976 ≈12.02 fm.

l=4:9 * sin(26) *1.976.

sin(26)=0.4384.

9 *0.4384=3.9456.

3.9456 *1.976 ≈7.795 fm.

Adding all terms: 0 +4.264 +9.27 +12.02 +7.795.

Compute 4.264 +9.27 =13.534.

13.534 +12.02=25.554.

25.554 +7.795=33.349 fm.

Hmm, that's about 33.35 fm. But the options are much higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula for k. Let me think again.

The wave number k is given by k = sqrt(2mE) / ħ, but that's for non-relativistic. But since the electron is relativistic, that formula wouldn't apply. But in our earlier approach, we used k = p/(ħ c), with p≈E/c.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate k more accurately.

Let me compute p exactly. Since E=50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV/c².

The relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 )

So (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2.

E=50 MeV, m c^2=0.511 MeV.

So (pc)^2 = (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ≈ 2500 (MeV)^2.

So pc = 50 MeV → p = 50 MeV/c.

So k = p/(ħ c) = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ c )

But ħ c is approximately 197.33 MeV·fm.

So k = (50 MeV/c) / (197.33 MeV·fm) ) → The MeV cancels, and 1/c divided by fm → so units are 1/(fm c).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Oh, wait, perhaps I should take into account that ħ is in units of J·s, but perhaps it's easier to use natural units where c=1 and ħ=1. But perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the wave number k is given by k = (2mE)^1/2 / ħ, but that's for non-relativistic. But in relativistic case, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the Compton wavelength of the electron, which is ħ/(m c). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute k in terms of the de Broglie wavelength. The de Broglie wavelength λ is h/(p), where h is Planck's constant. Since p =50 MeV/c, then:

λ = h/(p) = (6.626e-34 Js) / (50e6 eV / (3e8 m/s) ) )

Wait, but this is getting complicated. Let me compute it numerically.

But perhaps this is getting too involved, and I might be missing a key point here. Let's think about the options given.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for Im(f). Because another way to compute Im(f(0)) is using the optical theorem, which says that the total cross-section is (4π/ k^2) * Im(f) averaged over angles. But wait, but the question is specifically about the imaginary part along the beam direction, not the total cross-section.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach for the amplitude. Maybe the imaginary part of the amplitude is directly sum(l) [ (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ].

Wait, but that can't be right because units wouldn't match. Because (2l+1) is dimensionless, and sin(2δ_l) is dimensionless, so the sum would be dimensionless, but the imaginary part of f has units of length.

So maybe I missed a factor of 1/(2k), as in the formula. So perhaps my earlier approach is correct, but the problem is that I've computed the sum correctly and the options don't match. But the options are much bigger, like option C is 177 fm. So perhaps I made a miscalculation in the sum.

Wait, let's recalculate the sum.

Each term is (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l) / (2k)

But 2k is 0.506 fm^{-1}, so 1/(2k) is 1.976 fm.

So for l=1:

3 * sin(134) *1.976.

Sin 134 is about 0.7193.

3 * 0.7193 =2.1579.

2.1579 *1.976 → let's compute 2 *1.976=3.952.

Then 0.1579 *1.976 ≈ 0.312. So total is 4.264 fm.

l=2:5 * sin(110) *1.976.

Sin110=0.9397.

5 *0.9397=4.6985.

4.6985 *1.976 → let me compute 4 *1.976=7.904, 0.6985 *1.976≈1.381. So total ≈9.285 fm.

l=3:7 * sin60 *1.976.

Sin60=0.8660.

7 *0.866=6.062.

6.062 *1.976 → 6 *1.976=11.856, 0.062*1.976≈0.122. So total ≈11.978 fm.

l=4:9 * sin26 *1.976.

Sin26 ≈0.4384.

9 *0.4384=3.9456.

3.9456 *1.976 → let's compute:

3.9456 *2=7.8912, but since it's 1.976, which is 0.024 less than 2.

So 7.8912 - 3.9456 *0.024 → 3.9456 *0.024≈0.0947. So 7.8912 -0.0947≈7.7965 fm.

Now sum all terms:

l=0:0

l=1:4.264

l=2:9.285

l=3:11.978

l=4:7.7965

Adding up:

4.264 +9.285 =13.549

13.549 +11.978 =25.527

25.527 +7.7965=33.3235 fm.

Hmm, same result as before. So about 33.32 fm.

But the options are way higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that the scattering amplitude f has a factor of 1/(2k) for each term, but maybe the actual formula includes a factor of (2l +1) times (e^{2iδ} -1) times (1/(2k)).

Wait, but that's what I used. So why is the result not matching any option?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude includes a factor of (1/k) somewhere else, not just in each term.

Wait, let me think again. The full formula is f(θ) = sum_l (2l+1)/(2k) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ)

So the imaginary part is sum_l (2l+1)/(2k) [ sin(2 δ_l) ] P_l (cosθ).

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so the sum is as I calculated.

Hmm, but the options are way higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me recompute k correctly.

Electron energy E=50 MeV.

The correct way to calculate k is:

k = (E² - m² c^4 )^(1/2) / (ħ c) )

But since E is much larger than m c², E² >> m² c^4, so k ≈ E / (ħ c)

Wait, but E is in MeV, and ħ c is about 197.33 MeV·fm.

So k ≈ (50 MeV) / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → 50 /197.33 ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 2k is 0.506 fm^{-1}, as before.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (1/(2k)) * (ħ^2 / (2m)) ), but I'm not sure. Or perhaps I'm missing a factor related to the reduced mass or something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude includes a factor of (m_e c^2)^2/(2 E), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is correct, but the problem is that the wave number k is expressed in a different way.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for k. Let me think about the units again.

The wave number k has units of inverse length (like 1/fm).

In the formula, 2k is in 1/fm, and each term is (2l+1)/(2k) * sin(2δ_l), which gives units of length (fm).

So that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe I should compute the sum again, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Let me compute each term:

l=1: 3 * sin(134 degrees) = 3 * 0.7193 = 2.1579.

Multiply by 1.976 → 2.1579 * 1.976 → 4.264 fm.

l=2:5 *0.9397=4.6985.

4.6985 *1.976 → 4 *1.976=7.904; 0.6985 *1.976= ~1.381.

Total 7.904 +1.381=9.285 fm.

l=3:7 *0.8660=6.062.

6.062 *1.976 = 6 *1.976=11.856; 0.062 *1.976≈0.122.

Total 11.978 fm.

l=4:9 *0.4384=3.9456.

3.9456 *1.976 → 3.9456 *2=7.8912 minus 3.9456 *0.024=0.0947 → 7.8912 -0.0947=7.7965 fm.

Sum: 4.264 +9.285=13.549; +11.978=25.527; +7.7965=33.3235 fm.

Hmm, same as before.

But the options are much higher. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the phase shifts are given in radians, not degrees. But the question states the phase shifts are in degrees. So that's not it.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum ... ?

Ah! Wait a minute, I think I made a mistake in the initial formula. I think the correct formula for the scattering amplitude is:

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_{l=0}^∞ (2l + 1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ )

So the factor is (1/(2ik)), not (1/(2k)).

Ah, that's probably where I went wrong.

So, the correct formula is:

f(θ) = sum_{l=0}^\infty [ (2l+1)/(2ik) ) ] (e^{2iδ_l} -1 ) P_l (cosθ )

So the imaginary part would be Im(f) = sum [ (2l+1)/(2k) ) * sin(2δ_l) ] / i * P_l (cosθ )

Wait, no. Let's compute Im(f) correctly.

f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ} -1 ] P_l (cosθ )

So each term is (2l+1) [ (e^{2iδ} -1) ] P_l (cosθ ) / (2ik )

The imaginary part of f(θ) would be the sum of the imaginary parts of each term.

The term is [ (2l+1) [ (e^{2iδ} -1) ] P_l ] / (2ik )

But since k is real and positive, and in the denominator 2ik is imaginary, the denominator is imaginary.

So, the term becomes (2l+1) [ (e^{2iδ} -1) ] P_l / (2ik )

The imaginary part of this term is the imaginary part of the numerator multiplied by 1/(2ik), which is a real negative number because 1/(2ik) = -i/(2k).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write 1/(2ik) as [ -i/(2k) ]

So, the term is (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ} -1 ] P_l (cosθ ) * (-i/(2k) )

= (2l+1) [ (cos(2δ) + i sin(2δ) ) -1 ] P_l (cosθ ) * (-i/(2k) )

= (2l+1)/(2k) [ (cos(2δ) -1 ) + i sin(2δ) ] * (-i) P_l (cosθ )

= (2l+1)/(2k) [ ( -i (cos(2δ) -1 ) ) - i^2 sin(2δ) ) ] P_l (cosθ )

Since i^2 = -1:

= (2l+1)/(2k) [ -i (cos2δ -1) + sin(2δ) ] P_l (cosθ )

The imaginary part of this term is the coefficient of i. So:

Imaginary part = (2l+1)/(2k) [ - (cos(2δ) -1) ] * P_l(cosθ )

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because earlier when I summed the terms, I get a value around 33 fm, but the options suggest a larger value. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let me think again. The correct formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = sum_l [ (2l+1)/(2k) ) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l (cosθ) ]

But this is only correct when k is multiplied by i, perhaps. Oh, wait, I remember now. The correct formula is f(θ) = sum_l [ (2l+1)/(2ik) ) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l (cosθ) ]

Because in quantum mechanics, the scattering amplitude often has a factor of 1/k, and in the relativistic case, the wave number is imaginary? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the correct formula is f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum_l (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ )

The imaginary part of this would then be:

Im(f) = (1/(2k)) sum_l (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) P_l (cosθ )

Because the exponential term is (e^{iθ} -1) which when expanded gives terms with sine.

So, at θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So Im(f(0)) = (1/(2k)) sum_l (2l+1) sin(2δ_l )

Wait, but earlier I had (1/(2k)) as 1.976 fm. So each term is (2l+1)*sin(2δ_l) * (1/(2k)).

Wait, that's what I did earlier. So why is the result not matching the options?

Wait, perhaps the factor is (1/k) instead of (1/(2k)). Let me check the formula again.

Looking up the partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude:

The correct formula is f(θ) = (1/k) sum_l (2l+1) [ e^{2i δ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ )

Ah! So I was wrong earlier; the factor is (1/k), not (1/(2k)).

Oh no, this changes everything. Because previously I used (1/(2k)), but the correct factor is (1/k).

So that's where I made the mistake.

So the correct formula for Im(f(0)) is sum_l (2l+1) * sin(2δ_l) * (1/k )

Because 1/k is real, and for each term, the imaginary part comes from the sine term.

So now, let me recompute with this correction.

k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

1/k ≈ 3.953 fm.

Now, compute the sum again:

l=0: 1 * sin(180) → 0 → term=0.

l=1:3 * sin(134) =3 *0.7193=2.1579.

Multiply by 1/k=3.953 → 2.1579 *3.953 ≈8.50 fm.

l=2:5 * sin(110) →5 *0.9397=4.6985.

4.6985 *3.953 ≈18.51 fm.

l=3:7 * sin(60) →7 *0.866=6.062.

6.062 *3.953 ≈23.94 fm.

l=4:9 * sin(26) →9 *0.4384=3.9456.

3.9456 *3.953 ≈15.58 fm.

Now sum all the terms:

l=0:0

l=1:8.50

l=2:18.51 → sum 27.01.

l=3:23.94 → sum 50.95.

l=4:15.58 → sum 66.53 fm.

Hmm, that's about 66.53 fm. But the options are 87163 fm (option A), 355.35 fm (option B), 177.67 fm (option C), 251.27 fm (option D).

Still not matching. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of something else.

Wait, perhaps the formula for Im(f) is sum_l (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * ħ^2/(2m) ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should include the factor of 2 from the denominator correction. Wait, earlier I thought the formula was (1/k), but perhaps it's (1/(2k)).

Wait, confusion arises. Let me look up the correct formula.

Upon checking, the correct partial wave expansion for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is:

f(θ) = (1/k) sum_{l=0}^\infty (2l + 1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ )

So, the factor is (1/k), not 1/(2k). So the earlier correction was correct.

So, the sum is 66.53 fm. But the options are much higher. So I must have made a mistake in calculating k.

Wait, wait a second. Let me re-express k correctly. If E is 50 MeV, and m_e c^2 is 0.511 MeV, then (pc)^2 = E^2 - (m c^2)^2.

So, pc = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2) ≈50 MeV.

So p =50 MeV/c.

Then, k = p/(ħ c) = (50 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm )

So 50/197.33 ≈0.253 → 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k ≈3.953 fm.

So the sum is approximately 66.53 fm.

But the options are 177.675 fm (option C), which is about twice that.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the phase shifts. Let me check the given phase shifts.

The phase shifts given are δ_0=90°, δ_1=67°, δ_2=55°, δ_3=30°, δ_4=13°. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (1/k), and not (1/(2k)).

Wait, but the formula says (1/k) sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l), which is what I did.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should include all phase shifts up to l=4, but perhaps the problem says to ignore the rest beyond l=4, which I did.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the phase shifts are given in radians. But the question says they are in degrees, so they are correct as given.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Let me recompute the sum with accurate numbers.

Compute each term:

l=1:3 * sin(134) →3 * 0.7193 =2.1579.

Multiply by 3.953 → 2.1579 *3.953.

Let me compute 2 *3.953=7.906.

0.1579 *3.953 → approximately 0.624.

Total 7.906 +0.624=8.53 fm.

l=2:5 *0.9397=4.6985.

4.6985 *3.953 → compute 4 *3.953=15.812, 0.6985 *3.953≈2.749.

Total 15.812+2.749=18.561 fm.

l=3:7 *0.866=6.062.

6.062 *3.953 → 6 *3.953=23.718, 0.062 *3.953≈0.245. So total 23.718+0.245=23.963 fm.

l=4:9 *0.4384=3.9456.

3.9456 *3.953 →3 *3.953=11.859, 0.9456 *3.953≈3.729.

Total 11.859 +3.729=15.588 fm.

Now sum all terms:

8.53 +18.561 =27.091.

27.091 +23.963=51.054.

51.054 +15.588=66.642 fm.

Still about 66.64 fm.

But the options don't have this number. The closest is option C:177.675 fm, which is about 2.67 times higher.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me think.

Another approach: Perhaps I should compute k correctly in terms of E.

The correct formula for the wave number k is:

k = sqrt( (2mE) ) / ħ,

Wait, but that's for non-relativistic. Since E is 50 MeV, much larger than m c², perhaps relativistic corrections are needed. Alternatively, perhaps the wave number in the relativistic case is given by:

k = (E c) / ħ c^2 ) → No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute k using the momentum p and the relation k = p/(ħ c).

Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the value of k in terms of 1/(fm), but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Another approach: The Compton wavelength of the electron is λ_c = ħ/(m_e c) ≈ 2.426e-12 m = 0.2426 fm.

So 1/(m_e c) = ħ/(λ_c) → but perhaps this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute k as (E)/(ħ c).

E=50 MeV.

ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

So k=50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm) ) → 50/197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}, same as before.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the formula for the scattering amplitude f(θ) is (1/(2ik)) sum..., which would make the imaginary part different.

Wait, let me try that.

So f(θ) = (1/(2ik)) sum (2l+1) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ )

So Im(f(θ)) = Im( (1/(2ik)) sum ... )

The term 1/(2ik) is -i/(2k).

So each term becomes -i/(2k) * (2l+1) [e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l.

The imaginary part of this is the real part of [ (2l+1)/(2k) (e^{2iδ_l} -1) P_l ] multiplied by i, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the imaginary part of the term is (2l+1)/(2k) * sin(2δ_l) * P_l.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier, leading to about 33 fm.

So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Im(f) = sum_l (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (ħ^2 )/(2m c^2) )

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the factor is (m c^2)^2/(2 E), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the reduced mass, but since the target is a nucleus, perhaps it's a heavy nucleus, so the reduced mass μ ≈ m_e.

But I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to choose the closest option to my earlier result.

Wait, my initial result with the correct formula (sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (1/k) ) is about 66.6 fm. But the options don't have that. The closest is option C: 177.675 fm, which is about 2.67 times higher.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 1/k.

Wait, let me recompute 1/k.

k = 0.253 fm^{-1} → 1/k ≈3.953 fm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

k =50 MeV / (197.33 MeV fm ) =50/197.33 ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So 1/k=3.953 fm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula uses 1/(k) multiplied by (2l+1) and sin(2δ_l), but including a factor of 2.

Wait, the initial formula I used after correction was Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (1/k )

But perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (1/(2k) )

Which would give Im(f) = sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (1/(2k) )

In that case, 1/(2k)=1.976 fm.

So for each term:

l=1:3 *0.7193 *1.976=4.264 fm.

l=2:5 *0.9397 *1.976=9.285 fm.

l=3:7 *0.866 *1.976=12.02 fm.

l=4:9 *0.4384 *1.976=7.796 fm.

Sum: 4.264 +9.285=13.549 +12.02=25.569 +7.796=33.365 fm.

Which is about 33.365 fm. Still not matching any option.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of the amplitude is (sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) ) * ħ^2/(2 m c^2 )

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is Im(f) = sum_l (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (1/(2k) )

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct Im(f) is sum_l (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (1/k) * (ħ c )^2/(2m c^2 )

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the imaginary part of the amplitude in the Born approximation, but that's unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C: 177.675 fm, which is about twice my initial 88.8 fm.

Wait, perhaps I should include all the phase shifts up to l=4, but I think I did that.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 1/k.

Wait, perhaps the correct value of k is 0.1265 fm^{-1}, which would give 1/k=7.90 fm.

Then, sum would be 33.365 *2=66.73 fm. Still not matching.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating things, and the correct answer is option C: 177.675 fm, which is approximately 2.67 times my initial 66.6 fm.

But I can't see how to get that factor.

Wait, perhaps I should multiply the sum by 2.67, but I don't know why.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the wave number k. Let me think again.

Wait, the wave number k is given by:

k = sqrt( (2mE)/(ħ^2) )

But that's for non-relativistic. Since E is 50 MeV, which is relativistic, this formula wouldn't apply.

Wait, perhaps I should compute k using relativistic energy:

E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2 )

So, p = sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) / c.

Using E=50 MeV, m c^2=0.511 MeV.

So p = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) / c ≈50 MeV/c.

Then, k = p/(ħ c ) = (50 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm ) = 50/(197.33) ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

So, same as before.

I'm stuck. Perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, but considering the options, the closest I have is 33.365 fm, which isn't present. So perhaps the correct approach is to re-examine the initial formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of the amplitude is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (2k) )

But that brings us back to 33.365 fm, which doesn't match any option.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is 5.32 times my initial sum of 33.365 fm. I'm not sure why that would be.

Wait, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (ħ^2)/(2m c^2) ), which would require calculating with actual physical constants.

Let me compute that.

Compute (ħ c )^2 = (197.33 MeV fm )^2 = (197.33 )^2 (MeV^2 fm^2 )

m c^2 = 0.511 MeV.

So (ħ c )^2/(2 m c^2 ) = (197.33^2 ) / (2 * 0.511 ) MeV fm^2 / MeV → (197.33^2 )/(1.022 ) fm.

Compute 197.33^2 = approx (200)^2 =40000, minus 2*200*2.67 + (2.67)^2 → wait, 197.33 is approximately 200 -2.67.

So 197.33^2 ≈ (200 -2.67)^2 =200^2 - 2*200*2.67 + (2.67)^2 →40000 - 1068 +7.1289≈38940.1289.

So (38940.1289) / (1.022 ) ≈38108.7 fm.

Now, compute sum_l (2l+1) sin(2δ_l ):

sum = 0 (l=0) + 3*0.7193 (l=1) +5*0.9397 (l=2) +7*0.866 (l=3) +9*0.4384 (l=4)

Compute each:

3*0.7193=2.1579

5*0.9397=4.6985

7*0.866=6.062

9*0.4384=3.9456

Sum: 2.1579 +4.6985=6.8564 +6.062=12.9184 +3.9456=16.864.

So sum=16.864.

Then, multiply by (ħ c )^2/(2 m c^2 )=38108.7 fm.

So 16.864 *38108.7 fm → 16.864 *38108.7 ≈643,630 fm.

But that's way larger than the options.

Hmm, perhaps this approach is incorrect.

I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula uses (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) multiplied by (ħ^2)/(2m), which would give units of length.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = sum (2l+1)/(2k) [ e^{2iδ_l} -1 ] P_l (cosθ )

Which would imply that the imaginary part is sum (2l+1)/(2k) sin(2δ_l) * P_l (cosθ )

At θ=0, P_l(1)=1.

So Im(f(0)) = sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (2k )

Which is what I did earlier, giving about 33.365 fm.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm, which is exactly twice my initial result.

So perhaps the correct factor is (1/k), not (1/(2k)), which would give 66.6 fm, but that's not an option either.

Wait, perhaps the correct factor is (1/k) * (m_e c^2)/(E), because sometimes in relativistic calculations, you have factors involving the rest energy.

So let's compute (1/k) * (0.511 MeV)/(50 MeV) =3.953 fm * (0.01022) ≈0.0404 fm.

So Im(f) = sum terms * 0.0404.

Which would bring the sum down to about 33.365 *0.0404 ≈1.35 fm. Which is even smaller.

Hmm, not matching any option.

At this point, I'm really stuck. I'll have to make a guess based on the options provided. Given my earlier sum of 33.365 fm, which is close to option C being roughly twice that, but it doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula, and the correct answer is option C:177.675 fm.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for Im(f) is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (ħ^2)/(2m c^2 ), which would give:

sum=16.864.

(ħ c )^2/(2m c^2 ) = (197.33^2 )/(2 *0.511 ) fm.

Wait, (197.33)^2 is about 38940.

38940/(2*0.511)=38940/(1.022)≈38108 fm.

So 16.864 *38108 ≈642,993 fm. Not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is sum (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) * (ħ^2)/(2m), but that would be in fm.

But I'm not confident.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to calculate the sum as (2l+1) sin(2δ_l) / (2k ), but with k in a different unit.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is that the wave number k is in units of 1/(fm), but the formula requires it in a different unit.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses k = (m c^2)/(ħ c ) * E → but that doesn't make sense.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Given the options, the closest I can get is around 66.6 fm, but that's not an option. Therefore, the most plausible answer from the options provided, perhaps due to a miscalculation in the problem statement or a different approach, is option C:177.675 fm.


To calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction, we use the partial wave expansion formula for the scattering amplitude:

\[
f(θ) = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{(2l + 1)}{2k} \left(e^{2i\delta_l} - 1\right) P_l(\cosθ),
\]

where \(P_l(\cosθ)\) is the Legendre polynomial, \(k\) is the wave number, and \(\delta_l\) are the phase shifts. At \(\theta = 0\), \(P_l(1) = 1\), simplifying the expression for the imaginary part of \(f(0)\) to:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = \sum_{l=0}^\infty \frac{(2l + 1)}{2k} \sin(2\delta_l).
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \(k\)
The wave number \(k\) is related to the electron's momentum \(p\) and energy \(E = 50 \, \text{MeV}\). Using the relativistic relation \(p \approx E/c\) for high-energy electrons and \(k = p / (\hbar c)\), where \(\hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV·fm}\), we find:

\[
k = \frac{50}{197.33} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

Thus, \(1/(2k) \approx 1.976 \, \text{fm}\).

### Step 2: Compute the contributions from each \(l\)
The phase shifts are given as \(\delta_0 = 90^\circ\), \(\delta_1 = 67^\circ\), \(\delta_2 = 55^\circ\), \(\delta_3 = 30^\circ\), and \(\delta_4 = 13^\circ\). For each \(l\), the contribution to \(\text{Im}(f(0))\) is:

\[
\text{Im}(f(0))_l = \frac{(2l + 1)}{2k} \sin(2\delta_l).
\]

#### For \(l = 0\):
\[
\text{Im}(f(0))_0 = \frac{1}{2k} \sin(180^\circ) = 0.
\]

#### For \(l = 1\):
\[
\text{Im}(f(0))_1 = \frac{3}{2k} \sin(134^\circ) \approx \frac{3}{0.506} \cdot 0.7193 \approx 4.264 \, \text{fm}.
\]

#### For \(l = 2\):
\[
\text{Im}(f(0))_2 = \frac{5}{2k} \sin(110^\circ) \approx \frac{5}{0.506} \cdot 0.9397 \approx 9.285 \, \text{fm}.
\]

#### For \(l = 3\):
\[
\text{Im}(f(0))_3 = \frac{7}{2k} \sin(60^\circ) \approx \frac{7}{0.506} \cdot 0.8660 \approx 12.02 \, \text{fm}.
\]

#### For \(l = 4\):
\[
\text{Im}(f(0))_4 = \frac{9}{2k} \sin(26^\circ) \approx \frac{9}{0.506} \cdot 0.4384 \approx 7.796 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 3: Sum the contributions
Adding the contributions from all \(l\):

\[
\text{Im}(f(0)) = 0 + 4.264 + 9.285 + 12.02 + 7.796 \approx 33.365 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Compare with the options
The calculated value of \(33.365 \, \text{fm}\) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **C) 177.675 fm**, which is approximately \(2.67 \times 33.365 \, \text{fm}\). This discrepancy may arise from missing factors in the problem setup or differences in the interpretation of the formula.

### Final Answer:
Based on the given options and the calculations, the most plausible answer is:

**Answer: C**
