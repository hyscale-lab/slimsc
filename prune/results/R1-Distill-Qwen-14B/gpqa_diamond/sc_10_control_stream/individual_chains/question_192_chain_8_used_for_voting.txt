Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and conductors. Hmm, let me try to picture what's going on. The setup is a bit complex, but I'll break it down.

So, there's this uncharged spherical conductor with radius R. Inside it, there's a small spherical cavity. The center of the cavity is not at the center of the conductor; it's offset by a distance s. So s is the distance between the two centers. The cavity has radius r, which is smaller than R.

Now, a small positive charge +q is placed somewhere inside this cavity. The question is about finding the electric field at a point P outside the conductor. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. Also, the distance from P to the center of the cavity is l, and l is greater than R. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so the setup is like a conductor with a cavity off-center, and the charge is inside that cavity. The point P is outside the conductor, so the conductor's properties must influence the electric field there.

I remember that for conductors, the charges reside on the surface. But since the conductor is initially uncharged, any charges inside the cavity would induce charges on the inner and outer surfaces. Oh wait, but this conductor is uncharged, so when we place a charge inside the cavity, it will induce an equal and opposite charge on the inner surface of the conductor. Then, the outer surface would have no net charge because the conductor was neutral. So the inner surface has -q, and the outer surface has +q to balance, but wait, no, because the conductor was neutral. If the conductor had a charge Q, then the inner would be -q and the outer would be Q + q. But here, the conductor is neutral, so the inner surface must have -q, and the outer surface would have +q so that the total is zero. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the conductor itself is neutral, so the sum of inner and outer charges must be zero. If the inner surface has -q, then the outer surface must have +q, so that the total is zero. So the conductor's outer surface has charge +q.

Wait, but wait, originally the conductor is neutral. So the charge inside the cavity is +q. So the inner surface of the conductor (cavity) must have an induced charge of -q, and the outer surface must have +q. Because the conductor's total charge is zero, so (-q) + (+q) = 0. That makes sense.

Now, the point P is outside the conductor. So the electric field at P would be due to the charges on the outer surface of the conductor. Because the inner charges (like the -q on the inner surface) are enclosed within the conductor, so they don't contribute to the field outside. Because the conductor acts as a shield.

So the outer surface has +q. But wait, wait. The conductor is a spherical shell, right? So the outer surface charge distribution is uniform only if the conductor is a perfect sphere. But in this case, the cavity is not at the center. Oh, right, so the cavity is off-center, so the conductor is a sphere, but the cavity is not at the center. So the inner surface charge won't distribute uniformly. But since the conductor itself is a conductor, the charges on the outer surface will distribute in such a way that the field inside the conductor is zero.

Wait, but regardless of how the inner charges are arranged, the outer charges will arrange themselves to make the conductor's exterior field as if the charge is at the center. Because a spherical shell of charge with charge Q creates an electric field outside as if the charge were at the center. So even if the inner charges are off-center, the outer charges will adjust to ensure that the external field is as though the charge were at the center of the conductor.

So for the point P outside, the electric field would be due to the +q charge on the outer surface of the conductor. The conductor's radius is R, and point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor. So the field would be E = (1/(4πε₀)) * (q)/(L²), because the charge is on the outer surface, and the point is outside.

Wait, but wait, the problem gives l and theta. Let me see. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the center of the cavity is at a distance s from the conductor's center, and the point P's distance to the cavity's center is l. So l is the distance between P and the cavity's center. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so perhaps the field from the outer charge (which is the +q on the conductor's outer surface) is as if it's a point charge at the center of the conductor. So the electric field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because L is the distance from the conductor's center to P. So that's option B.

Wait, but let me think again. The conductor's outer surface has a charge +q. So the field outside is that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. So regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is placed, the external field is as if all the charge were at the center of the conductor.

Wait, no, that's only the case if the outer surface is a spherical shell. But in this case, the conductor is a sphere, but the presence of an off-center cavity with a charge inside... would that affect the distribution of the outer charge?

I think the outer charge distribution is still spherically symmetric. Because the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface must have a uniform charge distribution, regardless of the inner cavity's position. Because any excess charge on the outer surface will move to maintain the electric field inside the conductor as zero. So if the inner cavity is not centered, the inner charges rearrange, but the outer charges still distribute uniformly, making it so that the external field is as if the charge were at the center of the conductor.

Wait, but wait. No, I think that if the cavity is not at the center, the outer charge distribution might not be uniform. Because the presence of the inner charge off-center could create an electric field within the conductor, which would cause the outer charges to redistribute. But wait, the conductor is a conductor, so the E-field inside it must be zero. So the charges must arrange themselves such that the E inside the conductor is zero.

Wait, let me think. The conductor as a whole is neutral. The inner surface has induced -q (from the +q inside the cavity). The outer surface has +q. Since the conductor is a sphere, the outer surface charge would arrange itself uniformly because any excess charge on a spherical conductor distributes uniformly. So the outer charge is a spherical shell of +q, which would produce an external field as if the charge were at the center.

So regardless of where the inner charge is (as long as it's inside the cavity), the outer charges arrange to make the field outside as if the charge were at the center. So the point P's distance from the conductor's center is L, so E is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

Looking at the options, option B is (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L².

But wait, the problem gives l and theta. Why are those variables present in the options? Because if the point P is at a distance L from the conductor's center, but the charge is at the center, then the field at P should only depend on L, not on l or theta. So that suggests that the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but let's think again. What if the conductor's outer charge isn't a perfect shell? No, because the conductor is a sphere, and the outer charge would distribute uniformly. So the electric field outside is due to the +q at the center, hence only L matters.

So I think the correct answer is option B.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor and Induced Charges**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge $+q$ to balance the total charge.

2. **Outer Surface Charge Distribution**: The outer surface of the conductor is a spherical shell with charge $+q$. For a spherical shell, the electric field outside the shell is as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere, regardless of the distribution of charge on the shell.

3. **Electric Field at Point $P$**: The point $P$ is located outside the conductor at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The electric field at $P$ is due to the charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor. Since the outer surface charge behaves as a point charge located at the center of the conductor, the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Relevance of $l$ and $\theta$**: The variables $l$ (distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity) and $\theta$ (angle between $l$ and $s$) are not relevant here because the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The off-center placement of the cavity and the charge inside it does not affect the external field.

5. **Correct Option**: Among the given options, the one that matches the derived expression is:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is **B**.

The conductor's radius is R, and point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor.

Wait, but wait, the problem gives l and theta. Let me see. Point P is at a distance L from the center of the conductor, and the center of the cavity is at a distance s from the conductor's center, and the point P's distance to the cavity's center is l. So l is the distance between P and the cavity's center. The angle between l and s is theta.

Wait, so perhaps the field from the outer charge (which is the +q on the conductor's outer surface) is as if it's a point charge at the center of the conductor. So the electric field at P would be (1/(4πε₀)) * q / L², because L is the distance from the conductor's center to P. So that's option B.

Wait, but let me think again. The conductor's outer surface has a charge +q. So the field outside is that of a point charge +q at the center of the conductor. So regardless of where the charge inside the cavity is placed, the external field is as if all the charge were at the center of the conductor.

To determine the electric field $\vec{E}$ at a point $P$ outside the spherical conductor, we analyze the setup as follows:

1. **Conductor and Induced Charges**: The spherical conductor is initially uncharged. When a charge $+q$ is placed inside the cavity, it induces an equal and opposite charge $-q$ on the inner surface of the conductor. Since the conductor is neutral, the outer surface must have a charge $+q$ to balance the total charge.

2. **Outer Surface Charge Distribution**: The outer surface of the conductor is a spherical shell with charge $+q$. For a spherical shell, the electric field outside the shell is as if the charge were concentrated at the center of the sphere, regardless of the distribution of charge on the shell.

3. **Electric Field at Point $P$**: The point $P$ is located outside the conductor at a distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The electric field at $P$ is due to the charge $+q$ on the outer surface of the conductor. Since the outer surface charge behaves as a point charge located at the center of the conductor, the electric field at $P$ is given by:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

4. **Relevance of $l$ and $\theta$**: The variables $l$ (distance from $P$ to the center of the cavity) and $\theta$ (angle between $l$ and $s$) are not relevant here because the electric field outside the conductor depends only on the total charge on the outer surface and the distance $L$ from the center of the conductor. The off-center placement of the cavity and the charge inside it does not affect the external field.

5. **Correct Option**: Among the given options, the one that matches the derived expression is:
   \[
   E = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{L^2}.
   \]

Thus, the correct answer is **B**.
