Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

First, let me look at the given data. The compound has IR and 1H NMR spectra. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates either O-H or N-H stretches, but more likely O-H since we're dealing with organic compounds here. The strong peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester or acid. Then there's a peak at 1610 cm-1, which is around where aromatic C=C stretches appear. The 1450 cm-1 peak might be from aromatic ring substitution or possibly some kind of conjugated system.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows several signals. The first is a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, which makes me think of an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, the IR had a strong peak at 1720, which could correspond to an ester or maybe an acid (if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad around 2500-3000 as well, but perhaps the 1720 is the carbonyl). Alternatively, an aldehyde would have a peak around 9-10 ppm, but this is 10.5, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, but the IR has a peak in 3400-2500, which can be due to O-H stretching. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Because in carboxylic acids, the O-H is broad and strong, and the carbonyl is around 1700. So that fits with 10.5 ppm being the O-H proton of a carboxylic acid. But wait, the integration is 1H. So a single OH group. So maybe a benzoic acid derivative, since the aromatic signals are present.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Maybe a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other. The two doublets suggest two sets of protons, possibly on adjacent carbons. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, if there's another group attached, like an ester or a ketone, the protons would split into doublets.

Then there's a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That's a multiplet, probably for a CH or CH2 group near an electronegative atom or a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be adjacent to that, maybe a CH2 next to a carbonyl. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH(CH3) group. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl, perhaps from an ethyl group.

Putting this together: the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. The substituents might be an acid group and another group, but in the IR, the 1720 cm-1 could be an ester or a ketone. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is about 1700, so 1720 is a bit higher, which might be more indicative of an ester or maybe a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like a benzoyl group.

Wait, the IR also has a peak at 1610 cm-1, which is a strong peak for aromatic C=C. The 1450 cm-1 might be the C-O stretch in an ester or the C-O-C stretch in a carbonyl group.

Let me think about the NMR again. The 10.5 ppm is probably a carbonyl group attached to the ring. Wait, if it's a benzene ring with a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and an ester, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid with an ester substituent. Wait, but the NMR shows a singlet at 10.5, which could be the COOH proton. But wait, in the NMR, it's a broad singlet, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid. So if the molecule is a para-substituted benzoic acid, then the substituent would be another group.

Wait, looking at the 1H NMR, the 8.0 ppm (d,2H) and 7.2 ppm (d,2H) could be a para-substituted benzene with two groups. For example, a substituent at the para position, and perhaps another substituent elsewhere. But wait, if the ring has two substituents, but the data shows two doublets, maybe it's a simple para-substituted benzene. Let's think: if you have a substituent at the para position, and the substituent itself has another group, but that might complicate the splitting.

Alternatively, maybe the ring has an ester group and a substituent like an ethyl group. Wait, perhaps the structure is something like para-substituted benzene with a side chain that includes a carbonyl.

Let me try to imagine the structure. Suppose it's a benzene ring with a substituent in the para position. That substituent could be something like an ester or a ketone. Let's think about the NMR shifts:

The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm are for the aromatic protons. So, in a para-substituted benzene, the two sets of protons are para to each other, resulting in two doublets. So substituent X is at position 4, and substituent Y is perhaps a carbonyl group.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the possible structures.

Another approach: let's look at the options. The options are A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, okay, the products after reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Wait, red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids, but wait, another thought: red phosphorus with HI is a way to convert alkyl halides to alcohols, but more importantly, it's used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines. Wait, no, wait, I think I might be mixing things up.

Alternatively, red phosphorus with HI is used in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes. Or wait, in the context of elimination reactions, perhaps. Wait, but the initial compound has an IR that suggests a carbonyl, so perhaps it's an ester. Alternatively, if the initial compound is a nitrile, but the IR doesn't show the nitrile peak at around 2220 cm-1, which it doesn't. So maybe the initial compound is an ester.

Wait, but let me get back to the problem. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I think that's a classic reaction for the hydrolysis of an ester. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cleavage reaction. Wait, another thought: the reaction of esters with red phosphorus and HI is a method for the cleavage of esters to acids and alkanes. Or wait, no, perhaps it's a method for converting esters into alkenes via the formation of an ylide. Wait, I'm a bit unsure.

Wait, another angle: red phosphorus and HI is used in the dehydrohalogenation or perhaps for elimination reactions. Alternatively, in the hydrolysis of nitriles. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should first figure out the structure of compound X using the spectroscopic data, then think about the reaction.

So, structure of compound X.

From IR: O-H (carboxylic acid) maybe, and a carbonyl (ester or acid). But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H is broad and strong. The 1720 cm-1 would be the carbonyl of the acid. Wait, but wait, carboxylic acids have carbonyls around 1700, but perhaps if it's a conjugated acid, the carbonyl could be higher.

Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1720-1740. So the IR suggests either ester or acid.

Looking at the NMR again. The 10.5 singlet (1H) could be a COOH proton. Then, the aromatic signals would suggest a para-substituted benzene. Let's say the substituent is a COOH group and another group.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are as two doublets. So, if the substituent is at position 4, perhaps there's another substituent elsewhere. Wait, but if the substituent is an ester, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with an ester group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a side chain that includes a carbonyl group. For example, a benzene ring with an acyl group attached, like a phenylpropanoic acid or something similar.

Wait, looking into the NMR again. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH near a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be another CH2 group adjacent to that. The 1.4 (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, so maybe a CH(CH3) group. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal CH3, so perhaps an ethyl group.

Putting that together, perhaps there's a side chain like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH or something similar. Or maybe it's a propyl chain attached to the ring.

Wait, let me try to draw the structure. Suppose the benzene ring has a substituent like CH2-CO-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a group like CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH? Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a -CO-O-R group, which would be an ester. But then the IR would have a strong O-H peak, which could be from the ester's O-H, but esters don't have O-H (they have OR). Wait, no, wait. Ester's O-H is not present. Wait, no, no, the O-H in the IR is from the compound, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a -COOH group in the para position and another substituent. But how does that fit the NMR?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene. Let's say the structure is something like 4-(propanoic acid)benzene. But then the NMR would need to show that.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group. Let me think: the 10.5 ppm is the COOH proton. The aromatic protons are at 8 and 7.2, which are a couple of doublets, so the substituent is para to each other.

Wait, maybe it's a benzoic acid with an ethyl group attached. No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, let's consider the options. Let's look at the options given.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So that's benzene with ethyl group at position 4, and propanoic acid at position 2. But wait, the 2 substituent on benzene would make the ring substitution meta, not para. Wait, no, if the benzene has substituents at positions 2 and 4, that's meta.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted benzene, perhaps with two substituents in the para positions. Alternatively, perhaps a substituent that's para and another group attached elsewhere.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The 1H NMR of the aromatic region is 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests two sets of two protons each, each set being a doublet. So in a para-substituted benzene, if the substituent is something that causes the ring protons to split into two doublets. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is another group that breaks the symmetry.

Wait, if the substituent is a -COOH group at position 4, then the adjacent protons would be two sets. Let me imagine the structure: benzene with -COOH at position 4 and another substituent at position 1. Wait, but that would be meta, but in terms of NMR, perhaps it's giving two doublets.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -COOR group (ester), and another group attached.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, or something similar.

Wait, another approach: the NMR data for the non-aromatic regions.

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) is maybe a CH2 next to a CH, perhaps part of a chain. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH (like a CH(CH3) group). The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal methyl, so perhaps an ethyl group.

So, putting this together, the substituent on the benzene could be something like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. Wait, but would that fit?

Wait, if the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH, then the chain would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH attached to the benzene. So the structure would be benzene with a side chain of CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH at the para position. But then the NMR would have to show the appropriate signals for each part.

Let me think: the COOH proton is at 10.5, which matches. Then, the CH(CH2CH3) group would have the methyl attached. So, the CH2 adjacent to the CH would be at 1.7 ppm, maybe as a triplet or multiplet. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be the CH group connected to the CH2 and the COOH. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be the methyl group on the CH.

Wait, but that methyl is on a CH that's connected to a CH2, which is connected to the benzene. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH?

Wait, but that would make the chain Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH. Then, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 (from benzene) would be at around 2.9 ppm (maybe as a quartet if next to a CH that's split into multiple peaks). Alternatively, the CH2 could be next to a CH, giving a multiplet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. Then, the CH group would have neighboring groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene, but with a COOH at the end. So, benzene-CH2-CH2-COOH. But then the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -COO-ethyl group, making it an ester. Then, the IR carbonyl would be an ester (1720 cm-1), and the O-H in the IR would be from another source, but wait, if it's an ester, there wouldn't be an O-H peak, unless it's another part of the molecule, like a hydroxyl group elsewhere.

Wait, but the IR has a peak in 3400-2500, which is broad, so maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the structure would have a COOH group.

So, putting it all together, perhaps the structure is a para-substituted benzene with a COOH group and another substituent. But how does that fit the NMR?

Wait, maybe the structure is 4-ethyl-2-carboxybenzene. That would have the COOH group at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. But in that case, the aromatic protons would be at positions 3 and 5, which would each have two protons. But that might complicate the splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a side chain like CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, let me consider the NMR shifts again.

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is probably a CH next to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) is likely the adjacent CH2. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to the CH. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal methyl, which would be part of an ethyl group, perhaps as part of the substituent.

So, perhaps the substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH. So the chain is benzene-(CH2)-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. So the benzene is connected to a CH2, which is connected to a CH(CH2CH3), which is connected to the COOH group.

In that structure, the CH2 would be between the benzene and the CH, so the CH2 would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH group. That might explain the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) for the CH group and the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) for the CH2.

The CH group (CH(CH2CH3)) would have a methyl group (from CH2CH3) attached, which would show up as a triplet or something else. Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, so that would be the CH(CH3) group. Then, the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is the terminal methyl of an ethyl group. So perhaps the substituent has an ethyl group attached elsewhere.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to sketch it out.

Benzene ring with a substituent R. R is a chain: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. So, the benzene is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH that has a CH2CH3 group and a COOH group.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The COOH proton as a broad singlet around 10.5 ppm.

- The aromatic protons as two doublets, since the substituent is at a certain position and breaks the symmetry.

- The CH2 next to the benzene would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH. That might give a multiplet around 2.9 ppm (1H), but wait, CH2 has two protons, so perhaps a triplet or quartet.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group with a side chain leading to a COOH.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group leading to COOH, but with a branch.

Wait, another approach: let's analyze the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the structure would be a benzoic acid (COOH) with a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Benzoic acid has a COOH group, so the IR would show a strong O-H and a carbonyl around 1700. So the IR would have the 1720 cm-1 as the carbonyl of the acid, but wait, usually acids are around 1700. Hmm, perhaps it's a conjugated acid, so higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester.

Wait, but if it's benzoic acid, then the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be:

Ph-(C(O)OH) with a sec-butyl group at the para position.

But wait, the substituent is at position 4, so the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

In that case, the aromatic ring would have the COOH at position 1 and the sec-butyl at position 4. Wait, no, the benzoic acid is at position 1, and the substituent is at position 4, so it's para.

Wait, but then the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. So, for a para-substituted benzoic acid, the H on positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent, and the H on positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent. That would give two doublets in the NMR, which matches the data.

So, the aromatic protons would be as follows: the two H's at positions 2 and 6 would be deshielded and appear downfield, perhaps around 8.0 ppm as a doublet (since they're adjacent to the substituent). The H's at positions 3 and 5 would be less deshielded and appear around 7.2 ppm as a doublet.

That fits with the given NMR data.

Now, the substituent is a sec-butyl group (CH2-C(CH3)2). So, the structure is:

Ph-COOH at position 1, and at position 4, a sec-butyl group: CH2-C(CH3)2- attached to the ring.

Wait, no, the substituent would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3) if it's a sec-butyl. Wait, wait. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, no. Let me think: the sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)-, with the chain branching at the second carbon. So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, wait. The correct structure for sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, that's not correct. Wait, butyl is C4H9. The sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, no, that's not right. Let me get this straight: the butyl group can be straight chain (n-butyl), iso-butyl (where branching is at the first carbon), or sec-butyl (branching at the second carbon).

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think: butyl groups:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, no, more accurately, n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3. But that's not correct. Actually, n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3. Hmm, perhaps I should think of the structure as:

n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3.

sec-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)CH2.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to represent the substituent as CH2-CH(CH3)-, but that would be a 2-methylpropyl group, which is iso-butyl. Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

In any case, the substituent would have a CH2 group near the ring, then a CH group with two methyl groups attached.

So, the substituent would have a CH2 (attached to the ring), then a CH connected to two methyl groups, and perhaps another CH2 group.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data, the substituent has a CH2 (maybe at 1.7 ppm) and a CH (at 2.9 ppm), which is attached to a methyl group (1.4 ppm, d), and an ethyl group (0.9 ppm, t). So, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, the substituent could be a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. But that would make it a iso-butyl group, perhaps.

Wait, but the NMR shows a 0.9 ppm triplet for 3H, which is a terminal methyl group. So, that's likely from an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is probably a methyl attached to a CH, so maybe a CH(CH3) group.

If the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-, then the CH2 would be next to the ring, and the CH(CH3) would be next. The terminal CH3 would be the ethyl group.

So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, that would be a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think.

Given the NMR data, the substituent has the following features:

- A CH group (1H, m at 2.9 ppm)

- A CH2 group (2H, m at 1.7 ppm)

- A CH3 group (3H, d at 1.4 ppm)

- A CH2CH3 group (3H, t at 0.9 ppm)

So, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a branch. Let's see:

The substituent could be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that would have a CH2 group attached to the ring, then a CH connected to a CH2CH3 group. Then the ethyl group would be at the end.

Wait, but then the substituent would be a propyl group with a branching. Let me try to structure it:

- The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

But that's a 3-pentyl group? No, perhaps not.

Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group.

Wait, considering the NMR, the CH group (2.9 ppm) is connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm) and a CH3 (1.4 ppm, d), which is a methyl group attached to the CH. The CH2 (1.7 ppm) would be connected to another CH2 (maybe the ethyl group's CH2), which ends with a CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t).

So, putting it together, the substituent is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group with a branch. But that might not match the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the ring, with a methyl branch. So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-.

But that would be a 2-methylpropyl group, which is an iso-butyl group. But then the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, but that's a problem because that would be a three-carbon substituent.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think of the substituent as a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. That would have the CH2 attached to the ring, then a CH attached to a CH2CH3. So, the substituent would be a 3-pentyl group, but that's getting too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but again, that's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 group. So, it's a iso-butyl group, but that would be -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, another approach: the substituent's NMR shows a CH group (2.9 ppm, m, 1H) connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm, m, 2H), a methyl group (1.4 ppm, d, 3H), and a terminal methyl (0.9 ppm, t, 3H). So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 group.

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain. Let me count: the ring is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH (with a methyl group), which is attached to another CH2, which ends with a CH3. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. But that would make the substituent a pentyl group with a branch, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch. For example, -CH2-CH(CH3)-.

So, substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-.

In that case, the CH2 would be next to the ring, the CH would have a methyl group attached, and perhaps another CH2CH3 group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR shows a terminal methyl at 0.9 ppm (t), which is a triplet. That's typical for a CH2CH3 group at the end of a chain. So, perhaps the substituent ends with a CH2CH3.

Putting it all together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's a four-carbon chain, where the ring is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH(CH3), which is attached to a CH2CH3.

In that case, the substituent would be a 3-methylbutyl group, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an iso-butyl group. The iso-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. Wait, but that would have a terminal CH(CH3)2, which wouldn't give a terminal methyl group in the NMR.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group at position 4. The structure would be:

Benzoic acid (COOH at position 1) with a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-, but I'm not sure. Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, but I'm not confident.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure of a sec-butyl group. The correct structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think, the butyl group is C4H9. The possible structures are:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3.

- iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)2.

- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, no, perhaps the correct structure for sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, no. Wait, butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3. The substituent for the sec-butyl would be on the second carbon. So, the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to represent the substituent as:

Ph-COOH (at position 1), and at position 4, a substituent that is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that would be longer.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the reaction part. The compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What reaction occurs when a compound is treated with red phosphorus and HI?

I recall that red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. Wait, but more accurately, I think that when an ester is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes cleavage to form an acid and an alkane. Alternatively, it could be a method for converting esters to alkenes via the formation of ylides, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another possibility: red phosphorus and HI can be used to perform a substitution reaction. Alternatively, in the presence of an ester, perhaps it's a method for converting the ester to a carboxylic acid. But wait, HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction where the ester is converted to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if the initial compound is an ester, then treating it with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, in the case of an acid chloride, red phosphorus would reduce it, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, the reaction could be a nucleophilic substitution. For example, if the compound has an alkyl halide, HI would substitute it. But the initial data doesn't suggest an alkyl halide.

Wait, but the initial compound has a carbonyl group, as per the IR. So perhaps it's an ester.

Wait, if the initial structure is an ester, and it's treated with red phosphorus and HI, it would hydrolyze to form a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is converted to a carboxylic acid.

But, looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the initial compound is the corresponding ester, and the reaction converts it to the acid.

Wait, but the initial compound's NMR shows a COOH proton, so it's already a carboxylic acid. So that might not fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

The reaction of an ester with red phosphorus and HI typically leads to the formation of a ketone. For example, in the cleavage of esters using HX (like HI) and red phosphorus, the ester is converted into an alkyl halide, which can then undergo elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could involve the formation of an ylide. For example, when an ester is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it can form an ylide that then undergoes elimination to form an alkene. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but again, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a more accurate understanding of the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but that's another context.

Wait, another thought: when an ester reacts with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it can undergo a cleavage reaction. The mechanism involves the attack of iodide on the carbonyl, forming an intermediate, which then breaks down to form an alkyl iodide and the corresponding carboxylic acid.

Wait, for example:

R-O-CO-R' + HI (with red phosphorus) → R-OH + R'COOH.

But in this case, if the initial compound is an ester, the product after reaction would be a carboxylic acid.

But in the problem, the initial compound has the IR and NMR data that suggests it's already a carboxylic acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound is a nitrile. But the IR doesn't show the nitrile peak at around 2220 cm-1, so it's probably not a nitrile.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is an alkyne, but the IR doesn't show the sp-hybridized C-H stretch around 3300 cm-1, so that's unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe I should first focus on identifying the initial compound.

Given the NMR data, the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. The substituent likely has a COOH group and another group. The NMR shows a substituent with a chain that includes a CH, CH2, and a terminal CH3.

Looking back at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the structure would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent at the para position.

If the initial compound is option C, then after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Wait, but if the initial compound is already a carboxylic acid, what reaction would occur? Perhaps nothing, unless the reaction is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is an ester, and the product is the corresponding acid.

Wait, but the NMR data suggests a carboxylic acid already. So, maybe the reaction is something else.

Alternatively, maybe the initial compound is a nitrile. Let me think again, but the IR doesn't support that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration or some kind of elimination.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a substitution. For example, if the initial compound has a leaving group, like a bromide, and HI performs a nucleophilic substitution. But the initial data doesn't indicate the presence of a bromide or other leaving group.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me consider the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Its structure would have a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

In the NMR, the substituent would have the following features:

- The sec-butyl group would show a CH2 (maybe at 1.7 ppm), a CH (at 2.9 ppm), and a CH3 (at 1.4 ppm, perhaps as a doublet). The terminal CH3 of the ethyl group would be at 0.9 ppm (t).

So, the substituent in option C would be:

-CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, but that's a three-carbon group. How does that fit the NMR data?

In option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene. Then, the CH2 would be next to the ring, the CH would have a methyl group attached, and perhaps another CH2CH3 group. But where is the CH2CH3?

Wait, maybe the substituent is a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the substituent's structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent in option C is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, making it a pentyl group with a branch. But that would require more carbons than the NMR suggests.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but again, that's a longer chain.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck and need to make a decision based on the data.

The IR suggests a carboxylic acid, supported by the broad peak at 10.5 ppm in the NMR. The substituent has a chain that includes a CH, CH2, and a terminal CH3.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If that's the initial compound, what reaction would occur with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is a nitrile, and the reaction converts it into an amine, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced.

Wait, maybe the initial compound is an ester, and the reaction converts it to a carboxylic acid. But the NMR data suggests it's already a carboxylic acid, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus with HI is often used in the hydrolysis of esters to produce carboxylic acids and alkanes. The mechanism involves the attack of HI on the ester, followed by cleavage with red phosphorus.

So, if the initial compound is an ester, RCOOR', treatment with HI and red phosphorus would give RCOOH and R'HI.

But if the initial compound is a benzoic ester, like benzoyl acetate, then the product would be benzoic acid.

But in this case, the initial compound's NMR suggests a carboxylic acid, so perhaps the reaction is not hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is a benzylic bromide, and the reaction with HI would substitute it with iodide, but that's not supported by the data.

Hmm, maybe I should make an educated guess. The correct answer is likely option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, because the NMR data fits that structure, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would not change it if it's already a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is something else, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the reaction is supposed to produce a product from the initial compound. So perhaps the initial compound is an ester, and the reaction converts it to a carboxylic acid. But the options include C as a carboxylic acid, so perhaps the initial compound is the ester, and the reaction forms the acid.

Wait, but the data suggests the initial compound is the acid. So, perhaps the reaction doesn't change it, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is more indicative of an ester than a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids usually have a peak around 1700 cm-1, but perhaps with some conjugation, it could be higher. The 3400-2500 cm-1 peak is broad, which is more typical of an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. So, if the IR has a strong peak at 1720, it's more likely an ester, and the broad peak could be from an alcohol group elsewhere, but that complicates the structure.

But the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid proton. So perhaps the initial compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound is an ester with a hydroxyl group. For example, a phenyl ester with a hydroxyl substituent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is a methyl benzoate with a substituent that includes a hydroxyl group. But again, I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the initial compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction doesn't change it, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts it into something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. If the initial compound is a carboxylic acid, what would happen? Maybe nothing, unless the acid is further reacted. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on a benzyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is a benzyl bromide, but that's not supported by the NMR data.

Wait, I'm stuck. I think I'll go with the NMR data pointing to option C as the initial compound, and the reaction doesn't change it, which would make the product option C. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the ester to an acid, but since the initial compound is already an acid, perhaps the reaction isn't applicable, and the product remains the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is an ester, and the reaction forms a carboxylic acid. But the options don't have that.

Wait, the correct approach is probably to identify the initial compound, then determine the product after the reaction.

Based on the NMR and IR data, the initial compound is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent that contains a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 group. So, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But wait, the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH3)-. So, the substituent would have a CH2 attached to the ring, then a CH attached to a methyl group. The CH2 would be next to the ring, the CH would be attached to the methyl, and perhaps another CH2CH3 group.

Wait, but the NMR data shows a CH2 group at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and a CH at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). The substituent in option C (sec-butyl) would have a CH2 and a CH, which fits.

So, the initial compound is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Now, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Since the initial compound is a carboxylic acid, perhaps the reaction doesn't change it, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution or elimination reaction involving the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which has a structure that could undergo some reaction. For example, if the substituent is a secondary alkyl group, it might undergo elimination under certain conditions.

But I'm not certain about the exact reaction here. Maybe the reaction doesn't affect the substituent but affects another part of the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration, but without a hydroxyl group in the substituent, that's unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps the correct product is option C, and the reaction doesn't change it. So the final product would be the same as the initial compound. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the ester to a carboxylic acid, but since the initial compound is already an acid, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me think again.

The IR data shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is more indicative of an ester than a carboxylic acid. The 3400-2500 cm-1 peak could be from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But if the initial compound is an ester, then the O-H peak would be from another part, like an alcohol group elsewhere in the molecule.

But the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is very high for an ester's O-H (if any), so more likely a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, perhaps the initial compound is an ester with a hydroxyl group. For example, a phenyl ester with a hydroxyl substituent.

But I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to make a choice based on the data pointing to option C as the initial compound, and the reaction not changing it, making option C the product. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the ester to the acid, but the initial data suggests it's already the acid.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options again. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene.

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

If the reaction is hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, then the product would be option C.

But in the problem statement, the initial compound has the data that suggests it's option C. So the reaction would not change it, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is something else, like an elimination.

Wait, I think I'm stuck, but based on the NMR and IR data, the initial compound is option C, and perhaps the reaction doesn't change it. So the product is the same as the reactant, which is option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (indicative of an O-H group), 1720 cm⁻¹ (a carbonyl group, likely a carboxylic acid or ester), 1610 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C stretch), and 1450 cm⁻¹ (aromatic ring substitution or conjugation). The NMR data includes a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (likely a carboxylic acid proton), two doublets in the aromatic region at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H) (suggesting a para-substituted benzene), and signals for a CH group (2.9 ppm, m, 1H), a CH₂ group (1.7 ppm, m, 2H), a CH₃ group (1.4 ppm, d, 3H), and a terminal CH₃ group (0.9 ppm, t, 3H), indicating a branched alkyl chain.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**  
   This structure suggests a meta-substituted benzene ring, which is inconsistent with the NMR data showing two doublets in the aromatic region, indicative of a para-substituted benzene. Additionally, the branching pattern in the NMR does not match this structure.

2. **Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**  
   This structure lacks a carboxylic acid group, which is supported by the IR and NMR data. The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm and the carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ are inconsistent with this option.

3. **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**  
   This structure features a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl substituent. The NMR data matches well: the aromatic protons appear as two doublets (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm), and the sec-butyl group explains the signals at 2.9 ppm (CH), 1.7 ppm (CH₂), 1.4 ppm (CH₃), and 0.9 ppm (CH₃). The IR data also aligns, with the broad O-H peak and the carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ consistent with a carboxylic acid.

4. **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**  
   Similar to Option B, this structure lacks a carboxylic acid group, making it inconsistent with the IR and NMR data. Additionally, the branching pattern does not match the NMR signals.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
The reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) are typically used for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. However, the initial compound is already identified as a carboxylic acid (Option C). Since the compound is not an ester, the reaction would not alter its structure. Therefore, the product remains the same as the initial compound.

### Conclusion:
The initial compound is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (Option C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI does not change the structure, so the final product is also **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

**Answer: C**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying a compound based on its spectroscopic data and then predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI.

First, let me look at the given data. The compound has IR and 1H NMR spectra. The IR shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm-1, which usually indicates either O-H or N-H stretches, but more likely O-H since we're dealing with organic compounds here. The strong peak at 1720 cm-1 suggests a carbonyl group, maybe a ketone or ester or acid. Then there's a peak at 1610 cm-1, which is around where aromatic C=C stretches appear. The 1450 cm-1 peak might be from aromatic ring substitution or possibly some kind of conjugated system.

Looking at the NMR data now. The 1H NMR shows several signals. The first is a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm. That's a high chemical shift, which makes me think of an aldehyde proton or a carboxylic acid proton. But wait, the IR had a strong peak at 1720, which could correspond to an ester or maybe an acid (if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be broad around 2500-3000 as well, but perhaps the 1720 is the carbonyl). Alternatively, an aldehyde would have a peak around 9-10 ppm, but this is 10.5, which is a bit higher. Hmm.

Wait, but the IR has a peak in 3400-2500, which can be due to O-H stretching. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid. Because in carboxylic acids, the O-H is broad and strong, and the carbonyl is around 1700. So that fits with 10.5 ppm being the O-H proton of a carboxylic acid. But wait, the integration is 1H. So a single OH group. So maybe a benzoic acid derivative, since the aromatic signals are present.

Looking at the other NMR signals: 8.0 ppm (d, 2H), 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That looks like a para-substituted aromatic ring. Maybe a benzene ring with two substituents opposite each other. The two doublets suggest two sets of protons, possibly on adjacent carbons. For example, in a para-substituted benzene, if there's another group attached, like an ester or a ketone, the protons would split into doublets.

Then there's a peak at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). That's a multiplet, probably for a CH or CH2 group near an electronegative atom or a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be adjacent to that, maybe a CH2 next to a carbonyl. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to something, maybe a CH(CH3) group. The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl, perhaps from an ethyl group.

Putting this together: the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. The substituents might be an acid group and another group, but in the IR, the 1720 cm-1 could be an ester or a ketone. Wait, but if it's a carboxylic acid, the carbonyl is about 1700, so 1720 is a bit higher, which might be more indicative of an ester or maybe a ketone. Alternatively, maybe it's a conjugated carbonyl, like a benzoyl group.

Wait, the IR also has a peak at 1610 cm-1, which is a strong peak for aromatic C=C. The 1450 cm-1 might be the C-O stretch in an ester or the C-O-C stretch in a carbonyl group.

Let me think about the NMR again. The 10.5 ppm is probably a carbonyl group attached to the ring. Wait, if it's a benzene ring with a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and an ester, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a benzoic acid with an ester substituent. Wait, but the NMR shows a singlet at 10.5, which could be the COOH proton. But wait, in the NMR, it's a broad singlet, which is consistent with a carboxylic acid. So if the molecule is a para-substituted benzoic acid, then the substituent would be another group.

Wait, looking at the 1H NMR, the 8.0 ppm (d,2H) and 7.2 ppm (d,2H) could be a para-substituted benzene with two groups. For example, a substituent at the para position, and perhaps another substituent elsewhere. But wait, if the ring has two substituents, but the data shows two doublets, maybe it's a simple para-substituted benzene. Let's think: if you have a substituent at the para position, and the substituent itself has another group, but that might complicate the splitting.

Alternatively, maybe the ring has an ester group and a substituent like an ethyl group. Wait, perhaps the structure is something like para-substituted benzene with a side chain that includes a carbonyl.

Let me try to imagine the structure. Suppose it's a benzene ring with a substituent in the para position. That substituent could be something like an ester or a ketone. Let's think about the NMR shifts:

The 8.0 and 7.2 ppm are for the aromatic protons. So, in a para-substituted benzene, the two sets of protons are para to each other, resulting in two doublets. So substituent X is at position 4, and substituent Y is perhaps a carbonyl group.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the possible structures.

Another approach: let's look at the options. The options are A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid, B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene, C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

Wait, okay, the products after reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Wait, red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids, but wait, another thought: red phosphorus with HI is a way to convert alkyl halides to alcohols, but more importantly, it's used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines. Wait, no, wait, I think I might be mixing things up.

Alternatively, red phosphorus with HI is used in the hydrohalogenation of alkenes. Or wait, in the context of elimination reactions, perhaps. Wait, but the initial compound has an IR that suggests a carbonyl, so perhaps it's an ester. Alternatively, if the initial compound is a nitrile, but the IR doesn't show the nitrile peak at around 2220 cm-1, which it doesn't. So maybe the initial compound is an ester.

Wait, but let me get back to the problem. The reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. I think that's a classic reaction for the hydrolysis of an ester. Alternatively, perhaps it's a cleavage reaction. Wait, another thought: the reaction of esters with red phosphorus and HI is a method for the cleavage of esters to acids and alkanes. Or wait, no, perhaps it's a method for converting esters into alkenes via the formation of an ylide. Wait, I'm a bit unsure.

Wait, another angle: red phosphorus and HI is used in the dehydrohalogenation or perhaps for elimination reactions. Alternatively, in the hydrolysis of nitriles. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should first figure out the structure of compound X using the spectroscopic data, then think about the reaction.

So, structure of compound X.

From IR: O-H (carboxylic acid) maybe, and a carbonyl (ester or acid). But if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H is broad and strong. The 1720 cm-1 would be the carbonyl of the acid. Wait, but wait, carboxylic acids have carbonyls around 1700, but perhaps if it's a conjugated acid, the carbonyl could be higher.

Alternatively, if it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1720-1740. So the IR suggests either ester or acid.

Looking at the NMR again. The 10.5 singlet (1H) could be a COOH proton. Then, the aromatic signals would suggest a para-substituted benzene. Let's say the substituent is a COOH group and another group.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are as two doublets. So, if the substituent is at position 4, perhaps there's another substituent elsewhere. Wait, but if the substituent is an ester, maybe the structure is a benzene ring with an ester group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a side chain that includes a carbonyl group. For example, a benzene ring with an acyl group attached, like a phenylpropanoic acid or something similar.

Wait, looking into the NMR again. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH near a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) could be another CH2 group adjacent to that. The 1.4 (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, so maybe a CH(CH3) group. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal CH3, so perhaps an ethyl group.

Putting that together, perhaps there's a side chain like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH or something similar. Or maybe it's a propyl chain attached to the ring.

Wait, let me try to draw the structure. Suppose the benzene ring has a substituent like CH2-CO-O-R, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a group like CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH? Hmm, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a -CO-O-R group, which would be an ester. But then the IR would have a strong O-H peak, which could be from the ester's O-H, but esters don't have O-H (they have OR). Wait, no, wait. Ester's O-H is not present. Wait, no, no, the O-H in the IR is from the compound, so maybe it's a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a -COOH group in the para position and another substituent. But how does that fit the NMR?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene. Let's say the structure is something like 4-(propanoic acid)benzene. But then the NMR would need to show that.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propionyl group. Let me think: the 10.5 ppm is the COOH proton. The aromatic protons are at 8 and 7.2, which are a couple of doublets, so the substituent is para to each other.

Wait, maybe it's a benzoic acid with an ethyl group attached. No, that might not fit.

Alternatively, let's consider the options. Let's look at the options given.

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So that's benzene with ethyl group at position 4, and propanoic acid at position 2. But wait, the 2 substituent on benzene would make the ring substitution meta, not para. Wait, no, if the benzene has substituents at positions 2 and 4, that's meta.

Wait, but in the NMR, the aromatic protons are split into two doublets, which suggests a para-substituted benzene, perhaps with two substituents in the para positions. Alternatively, perhaps a substituent that's para and another group attached elsewhere.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The 1H NMR of the aromatic region is 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H). That suggests two sets of two protons each, each set being a doublet. So in a para-substituted benzene, if the substituent is something that causes the ring protons to split into two doublets. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is another group that breaks the symmetry.

Wait, if the substituent is a -COOH group at position 4, then the adjacent protons would be two sets. Let me imagine the structure: benzene with -COOH at position 4 and another substituent at position 1. Wait, but that would be meta, but in terms of NMR, perhaps it's giving two doublets.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -COOR group (ester), and another group attached.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH2CH3) group, or something similar.

Wait, another approach: the NMR data for the non-aromatic regions.

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be a CH group adjacent to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) is maybe a CH2 next to a CH, perhaps part of a chain. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH (like a CH(CH3) group). The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal methyl, so perhaps an ethyl group.

So, putting this together, the substituent on the benzene could be something like CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. Wait, but would that fit?

Wait, if the substituent is CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH, then the chain would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH attached to the benzene. So the structure would be benzene with a side chain of CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH at the para position. But then the NMR would have to show the appropriate signals for each part.

Let me think: the COOH proton is at 10.5, which matches. Then, the CH(CH2CH3) group would have the methyl attached. So, the CH2 adjacent to the CH would be at 1.7 ppm, maybe as a triplet or multiplet. The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) could be the CH group connected to the CH2 and the COOH. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) would be the methyl group on the CH.

Wait, but that methyl is on a CH that's connected to a CH2, which is connected to the benzene. So the structure would be Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH?

Wait, but that would make the chain Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-COOH. Then, the NMR would show:

- The CH2 (from benzene) would be at around 2.9 ppm (maybe as a quartet if next to a CH that's split into multiple peaks). Alternatively, the CH2 could be next to a CH, giving a multiplet.

Wait, perhaps the structure is Ph-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. Then, the CH group would have neighboring groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene, but with a COOH at the end. So, benzene-CH2-CH2-COOH. But then the NMR would show a triplet for the CH2, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -COO-ethyl group, making it an ester. Then, the IR carbonyl would be an ester (1720 cm-1), and the O-H in the IR would be from another source, but wait, if it's an ester, there wouldn't be an O-H peak, unless it's another part of the molecule, like a hydroxyl group elsewhere.

Wait, but the IR has a peak in 3400-2500, which is broad, so maybe it's an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. If it's a carboxylic acid, then the structure would have a COOH group.

So, putting it all together, perhaps the structure is a para-substituted benzene with a COOH group and another substituent. But how does that fit the NMR?

Wait, maybe the structure is 4-ethyl-2-carboxybenzene. That would have the COOH group at position 2 and an ethyl group at position 4. But in that case, the aromatic protons would be at positions 3 and 5, which would each have two protons. But that might complicate the splitting.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a side chain like CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH attached to the benzene ring.

Wait, let me consider the NMR shifts again.

The 2.9 ppm (m,1H) is probably a CH next to a carbonyl. The 1.7 ppm (m,2H) is likely the adjacent CH2. The 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to the CH. The 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is a terminal methyl, which would be part of an ethyl group, perhaps as part of the substituent.

So, perhaps the substituent is CH2CH(CH2CH3)COOH. So the chain is benzene-(CH2)-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. So the benzene is connected to a CH2, which is connected to a CH(CH2CH3), which is connected to the COOH group.

In that structure, the CH2 would be between the benzene and the CH, so the CH2 would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH group. That might explain the 2.9 ppm (m,1H) for the CH group and the 1.7 ppm (m,2H) for the CH2.

The CH group (CH(CH2CH3)) would have a methyl group (from CH2CH3) attached, which would show up as a triplet or something else. Wait, the 1.4 ppm (d,3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, so that would be the CH(CH3) group. Then, the 0.9 ppm (t,3H) is the terminal methyl of an ethyl group. So perhaps the substituent has an ethyl group attached elsewhere.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try to sketch it out.

Benzene ring with a substituent R. R is a chain: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-COOH. So, the benzene is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH that has a CH2CH3 group and a COOH group.

In that case, the NMR would show:

- The COOH proton as a broad singlet around 10.5 ppm.

- The aromatic protons as two doublets, since the substituent is at a certain position and breaks the symmetry.

- The CH2 next to the benzene would have protons that are split by the adjacent CH. That might give a multiplet around 2.9 ppm (1H), but wait, CH2 has two protons, so perhaps a triplet or quartet.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl group with a side chain leading to a COOH.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group leading to COOH, but with a branch.

Wait, another approach: let's analyze the options.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the structure would be a benzoic acid (COOH) with a sec-butyl group at position 4.

Benzoic acid has a COOH group, so the IR would show a strong O-H and a carbonyl around 1700. So the IR would have the 1720 cm-1 as the carbonyl of the acid, but wait, usually acids are around 1700. Hmm, perhaps it's a conjugated acid, so higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester.

Wait, but if it's benzoic acid, then the substituent is a sec-butyl group. So the structure would be:

Ph-(C(O)OH) with a sec-butyl group at the para position.

But wait, the substituent is at position 4, so the structure would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

In that case, the aromatic ring would have the COOH at position 1 and the sec-butyl at position 4. Wait, no, the benzoic acid is at position 1, and the substituent is at position 4, so it's para.

Wait, but then the aromatic protons would be at positions 2,3,5,6. So, for a para-substituted benzoic acid, the H on positions 3 and 5 would be equivalent, and the H on positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent. That would give two doublets in the NMR, which matches the data.

So, the aromatic protons would be as follows: the two H's at positions 2 and 6 would be deshielded and appear downfield, perhaps around 8.0 ppm as a doublet (since they're adjacent to the substituent). The H's at positions 3 and 5 would be less deshielded and appear around 7.2 ppm as a doublet.

That fits with the given NMR data.

Now, the substituent is a sec-butyl group (CH2-C(CH3)2). So, the structure is:

Ph-COOH at position 1, and at position 4, a sec-butyl group: CH2-C(CH3)2- attached to the ring.

Wait, no, the substituent would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3) if it's a sec-butyl. Wait, wait. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, no. Let me think: the sec-butyl group is -CH2CH(CH3)-, with the chain branching at the second carbon. So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, wait. The correct structure for sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. No, wait, that's not correct. Wait, butyl is C4H9. The sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but wait, no, that's not right. Let me get this straight: the butyl group can be straight chain (n-butyl), iso-butyl (where branching is at the first carbon), or sec-butyl (branching at the second carbon).

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think: butyl groups:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3.

Wait, no, more accurately, n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3. But that's not correct. Actually, n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, n-butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3. Hmm, perhaps I should think of the structure as:

n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3.

sec-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)CH2.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to represent the substituent as CH2-CH(CH3)-, but that would be a 2-methylpropyl group, which is iso-butyl. Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, the correct structure for a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that's not right. Wait, perhaps it's -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- attached to the ring. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

In any case, the substituent would have a CH2 group near the ring, then a CH group with two methyl groups attached.

So, the substituent would have a CH2 (attached to the ring), then a CH connected to two methyl groups, and perhaps another CH2 group.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data, the substituent has a CH2 (maybe at 1.7 ppm) and a CH (at 2.9 ppm), which is attached to a methyl group (1.4 ppm, d), and an ethyl group (0.9 ppm, t). So, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch.

Wait, the substituent could be a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. But that would make it a iso-butyl group, perhaps.

Wait, but the NMR shows a 0.9 ppm triplet for 3H, which is a terminal methyl group. So, that's likely from an ethyl group (-CH2CH3). The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is probably a methyl attached to a CH, so maybe a CH(CH3) group.

If the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-, then the CH2 would be next to the ring, and the CH(CH3) would be next. The terminal CH3 would be the ethyl group.

So, the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3? No, that would be a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think.

Given the NMR data, the substituent has the following features:

- A CH group (1H, m at 2.9 ppm)

- A CH2 group (2H, m at 1.7 ppm)

- A CH3 group (3H, d at 1.4 ppm)

- A CH2CH3 group (3H, t at 0.9 ppm)

So, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group with a branch. Let's see:

The substituent could be -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-, but that would have a CH2 group attached to the ring, then a CH connected to a CH2CH3 group. Then the ethyl group would be at the end.

Wait, but then the substituent would be a propyl group with a branching. Let me try to structure it:

- The substituent is -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

But that's a 3-pentyl group? No, perhaps not.

Alternatively, the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH3)-CH2- group. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that would be a longer chain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group.

Wait, considering the NMR, the CH group (2.9 ppm) is connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm) and a CH3 (1.4 ppm, d), which is a methyl group attached to the CH. The CH2 (1.7 ppm) would be connected to another CH2 (maybe the ethyl group's CH2), which ends with a CH3 at 0.9 ppm (t).

So, putting it together, the substituent is:

Ph-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that would make the substituent a pentyl group with a branch. But that might not match the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the ring, with a methyl branch. So, the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-.

But that would be a 2-methylpropyl group, which is an iso-butyl group. But then the substituent would be -CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, but that's a problem because that would be a three-carbon substituent.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think of the substituent as a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that doesn't fit the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH2CH3)- group. That would have the CH2 attached to the ring, then a CH attached to a CH2CH3. So, the substituent would be a 3-pentyl group, but that's getting too long.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but again, that's a longer chain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 group. So, it's a iso-butyl group, but that would be -CH2CH(CH3)2. Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, another approach: the substituent's NMR shows a CH group (2.9 ppm, m, 1H) connected to a CH2 (1.7 ppm, m, 2H), a methyl group (1.4 ppm, d, 3H), and a terminal methyl (0.9 ppm, t, 3H). So, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 group.

Wait, but that would be a four-carbon chain. Let me count: the ring is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH (with a methyl group), which is attached to another CH2, which ends with a CH3. So the substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3. But that would make the substituent a pentyl group with a branch, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a propyl group with a methyl branch. For example, -CH2-CH(CH3)-.

So, substituent is -CH2-CH(CH3)-.

In that case, the CH2 would be next to the ring, the CH would have a methyl group attached, and perhaps another CH2CH3 group. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the NMR shows a terminal methyl at 0.9 ppm (t), which is a triplet. That's typical for a CH2CH3 group at the end of a chain. So, perhaps the substituent ends with a CH2CH3.

Putting it all together, perhaps the substituent is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's a four-carbon chain, where the ring is attached to a CH2, which is attached to a CH(CH3), which is attached to a CH2CH3.

In that case, the substituent would be a 3-methylbutyl group, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an iso-butyl group. The iso-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)2. Wait, but that would have a terminal CH(CH3)2, which wouldn't give a terminal methyl group in the NMR.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group at position 4. The structure would be:

Benzoic acid (COOH at position 1) with a sec-butyl group at position 4.

The sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-, but I'm not sure. Wait, the structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH(CH2CH2CH3)-, but I'm not confident.

Wait, maybe I should draw the structure of a sec-butyl group. The correct structure of a sec-butyl group is -CH2-CH(CH3)-. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think, the butyl group is C4H9. The possible structures are:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3.

- iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)2.

- sec-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, no, perhaps the correct structure for sec-butyl is CH2CH(CH2CH3).

Wait, no. Wait, butyl is CH2CH2CH2CH3. The substituent for the sec-butyl would be on the second carbon. So, the structure would be CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to represent the substituent as:

Ph-COOH (at position 1), and at position 4, a substituent that is a -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2- group. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but that would be longer.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me go back to the reaction part. The compound reacts with red phosphorus and HI. What reaction occurs when a compound is treated with red phosphorus and HI?

I recall that red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. Wait, but more accurately, I think that when an ester is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes cleavage to form an acid and an alkane. Alternatively, it could be a method for converting esters to alkenes via the formation of ylides, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another possibility: red phosphorus and HI can be used to perform a substitution reaction. Alternatively, in the presence of an ester, perhaps it's a method for converting the ester to a carboxylic acid. But wait, HI is a strong acid and a good nucleophile. Alternatively, perhaps it's a hydrolysis reaction where the ester is converted to a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but if the initial compound is an ester, then treating it with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, perhaps it's a different reaction.

Alternatively, in the case of an acid chloride, red phosphorus would reduce it, but that's probably not relevant here.

Alternatively, the reaction could be a nucleophilic substitution. For example, if the compound has an alkyl halide, HI would substitute it. But the initial data doesn't suggest an alkyl halide.

Wait, but the initial compound has a carbonyl group, as per the IR. So perhaps it's an ester.

Wait, if the initial structure is an ester, and it's treated with red phosphorus and HI, it would hydrolyze to form a carboxylic acid and an alcohol. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the ester is converted to a carboxylic acid.

But, looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is a carboxylic acid. So perhaps the initial compound is the corresponding ester, and the reaction converts it to the acid.

Wait, but the initial compound's NMR shows a COOH proton, so it's already a carboxylic acid. So that might not fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again.

The reaction of an ester with red phosphorus and HI typically leads to the formation of a ketone. For example, in the cleavage of esters using HX (like HI) and red phosphorus, the ester is converted into an alkyl halide, which can then undergo elimination to form an alkene.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could involve the formation of an ylide. For example, when an ester is treated with red phosphorus and HI, it can form an ylide that then undergoes elimination to form an alkene. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation, but again, I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I should look for a more accurate understanding of the reaction conditions. Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to amines, but that's another context.

Wait, another thought: when an ester reacts with HI in the presence of red phosphorus, it can undergo a cleavage reaction. The mechanism involves the attack of iodide on the carbonyl, forming an intermediate, which then breaks down to form an alkyl iodide and the corresponding carboxylic acid.

Wait, for example:

R-O-CO-R' + HI (with red phosphorus) → R-OH + R'COOH.

But in this case, if the initial compound is an ester, the product after reaction would be a carboxylic acid.

But in the problem, the initial compound has the IR and NMR data that suggests it's already a carboxylic acid. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound is a nitrile. But the IR doesn't show the nitrile peak at around 2220 cm-1, so it's probably not a nitrile.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is an alkyne, but the IR doesn't show the sp-hybridized C-H stretch around 3300 cm-1, so that's unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Maybe I should first focus on identifying the initial compound.

Given the NMR data, the aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene. The substituent likely has a COOH group and another group. The NMR shows a substituent with a chain that includes a CH, CH2, and a terminal CH3.

Looking back at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the structure would be a benzoic acid with a sec-butyl substituent at the para position.

If the initial compound is option C, then after reaction with red phosphorus and HI, what would happen?

Wait, but if the initial compound is already a carboxylic acid, what reaction would occur? Perhaps nothing, unless the reaction is something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is an ester, and the product is the corresponding acid.

Wait, but the NMR data suggests a carboxylic acid already. So, maybe the reaction is something else.

Alternatively, maybe the initial compound is a nitrile. Let me think again, but the IR doesn't support that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration or some kind of elimination.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction could be a substitution. For example, if the initial compound has a leaving group, like a bromide, and HI performs a nucleophilic substitution. But the initial data doesn't indicate the presence of a bromide or other leaving group.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for another approach. Let me consider the options again.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. Its structure would have a COOH group at position 1 and a sec-butyl group at position 4.

In the NMR, the substituent would have the following features:

- The sec-butyl group would show a CH2 (maybe at 1.7 ppm), a CH (at 2.9 ppm), and a CH3 (at 1.4 ppm, perhaps as a doublet). The terminal CH3 of the ethyl group would be at 0.9 ppm (t).

So, the substituent in option C would be:

-CH2-CH(CH3)-.

Wait, but that's a three-carbon group. How does that fit the NMR data?

In option C, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH3)- attached to the benzene. Then, the CH2 would be next to the ring, the CH would have a methyl group attached, and perhaps another CH2CH3 group. But where is the CH2CH3?

Wait, maybe the substituent is a longer chain. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the substituent's structure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent in option C is -CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, making it a pentyl group with a branch. But that would require more carbons than the NMR suggests.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a -CH(CH2CH2CH3)- group, but again, that's a longer chain.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck and need to make a decision based on the data.

The IR suggests a carboxylic acid, supported by the broad peak at 10.5 ppm in the NMR. The substituent has a chain that includes a CH, CH2, and a terminal CH3.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. If that's the initial compound, what reaction would occur with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is a nitrile, and the reaction converts it into an amine, but that doesn't fit the NMR data.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution where a leaving group is replaced.

Wait, maybe the initial compound is an ester, and the reaction converts it to a carboxylic acid. But the NMR data suggests it's already a carboxylic acid, so that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus with HI is often used in the hydrolysis of esters to produce carboxylic acids and alkanes. The mechanism involves the attack of HI on the ester, followed by cleavage with red phosphorus.

So, if the initial compound is an ester, RCOOR', treatment with HI and red phosphorus would give RCOOH and R'HI.

But if the initial compound is a benzoic ester, like benzoyl acetate, then the product would be benzoic acid.

But in this case, the initial compound's NMR suggests a carboxylic acid, so perhaps the reaction is not hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is a benzylic bromide, and the reaction with HI would substitute it with iodide, but that's not supported by the data.

Hmm, maybe I should make an educated guess. The correct answer is likely option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, because the NMR data fits that structure, and the reaction with red phosphorus and HI would not change it if it's already a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is something else, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, but the reaction is supposed to produce a product from the initial compound. So perhaps the initial compound is an ester, and the reaction converts it to a carboxylic acid. But the options include C as a carboxylic acid, so perhaps the initial compound is the ester, and the reaction forms the acid.

Wait, but the data suggests the initial compound is the acid. So, perhaps the reaction doesn't change it, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The IR shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is more indicative of an ester than a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids usually have a peak around 1700 cm-1, but perhaps with some conjugation, it could be higher. The 3400-2500 cm-1 peak is broad, which is more typical of an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. So, if the IR has a strong peak at 1720, it's more likely an ester, and the broad peak could be from an alcohol group elsewhere, but that complicates the structure.

But the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is more consistent with a carboxylic acid proton. So perhaps the initial compound is a benzoic acid derivative.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound is an ester with a hydroxyl group. For example, a phenyl ester with a hydroxyl substituent. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is a methyl benzoate with a substituent that includes a hydroxyl group. But again, I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that the initial compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), and the reaction doesn't change it, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts it into something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the reaction is with red phosphorus and HI. If the initial compound is a carboxylic acid, what would happen? Maybe nothing, unless the acid is further reacted. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on a benzyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is a benzyl bromide, but that's not supported by the NMR data.

Wait, I'm stuck. I think I'll go with the NMR data pointing to option C as the initial compound, and the reaction doesn't change it, which would make the product option C. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the ester to an acid, but since the initial compound is already an acid, perhaps the reaction isn't applicable, and the product remains the same.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial compound is an ester, and the reaction forms a carboxylic acid. But the options don't have that.

Wait, the correct approach is probably to identify the initial compound, then determine the product after the reaction.

Based on the NMR and IR data, the initial compound is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent that contains a CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2CH3 group. So, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

But wait, the substituent in option C is a sec-butyl group, which is -CH2-CH(CH3)-. So, the substituent would have a CH2 attached to the ring, then a CH attached to a methyl group. The CH2 would be next to the ring, the CH would be attached to the methyl, and perhaps another CH2CH3 group.

Wait, but the NMR data shows a CH2 group at 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) and a CH at 2.9 ppm (m, 1H). The substituent in option C (sec-butyl) would have a CH2 and a CH, which fits.

So, the initial compound is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

Now, the reaction with red phosphorus and HI. Since the initial compound is a carboxylic acid, perhaps the reaction doesn't change it, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a substitution or elimination reaction involving the substituent.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which has a structure that could undergo some reaction. For example, if the substituent is a secondary alkyl group, it might undergo elimination under certain conditions.

But I'm not certain about the exact reaction here. Maybe the reaction doesn't affect the substituent but affects another part of the molecule.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydration, but without a hydroxyl group in the substituent, that's unlikely.

Hmm, perhaps the correct product is option C, and the reaction doesn't change it. So the final product would be the same as the initial compound. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the ester to a carboxylic acid, but since the initial compound is already an acid, I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me think again.

The IR data shows a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is more indicative of an ester than a carboxylic acid. The 3400-2500 cm-1 peak could be from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But if the initial compound is an ester, then the O-H peak would be from another part, like an alcohol group elsewhere in the molecule.

But the NMR has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is very high for an ester's O-H (if any), so more likely a carboxylic acid.

Hmm, perhaps the initial compound is an ester with a hydroxyl group. For example, a phenyl ester with a hydroxyl substituent.

But I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I think I'll have to make a choice based on the data pointing to option C as the initial compound, and the reaction not changing it, making option C the product. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction converts the ester to the acid, but the initial data suggests it's already the acid.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the options again. The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene.

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

If the reaction is hydrolysis of an ester to a carboxylic acid, then the product would be option C.

But in the problem statement, the initial compound has the data that suggests it's option C. So the reaction would not change it, which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is something else, like an elimination.

Wait, I think I'm stuck, but based on the NMR and IR data, the initial compound is option C, and perhaps the reaction doesn't change it. So the product is the same as the reactant, which is option C.


The problem involves identifying a compound based on its IR and NMR data and predicting the product after a reaction with red phosphorus and HI. The IR data shows peaks at 3400–2500 cm⁻¹ (indicative of an O-H group), 1720 cm⁻¹ (a carbonyl group, likely a carboxylic acid or ester), 1610 cm⁻¹ (aromatic C=C stretch), and 1450 cm⁻¹ (aromatic ring substitution or conjugation). The NMR data includes a broad singlet at 10.5 ppm (likely a carboxylic acid proton), two doublets in the aromatic region at 8.0 ppm (2H) and 7.2 ppm (2H) (suggesting a para-substituted benzene), and signals for a CH group (2.9 ppm, m, 1H), a CH₂ group (1.7 ppm, m, 2H), a CH₃ group (1.4 ppm, d, 3H), and a terminal CH₃ group (0.9 ppm, t, 3H), indicating a branched alkyl chain.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**  
   This structure suggests a meta-substituted benzene ring, which is inconsistent with the NMR data showing two doublets in the aromatic region, indicative of a para-substituted benzene. Additionally, the branching pattern in the NMR does not match this structure.

2. **Option B: 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**  
   This structure lacks a carboxylic acid group, which is supported by the IR and NMR data. The broad singlet at 10.5 ppm and the carbonyl peak at 1720 cm⁻¹ are inconsistent with this option.

3. **Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**  
   This structure features a para-substituted benzene ring with a carboxylic acid group and a sec-butyl substituent. The NMR data matches well: the aromatic protons appear as two doublets (8.0 ppm and 7.2 ppm), and the sec-butyl group explains the signals at 2.9 ppm (CH), 1.7 ppm (CH₂), 1.4 ppm (CH₃), and 0.9 ppm (CH₃). The IR data also aligns, with the broad O-H peak and the carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ consistent with a carboxylic acid.

4. **Option D: 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**  
   Similar to Option B, this structure lacks a carboxylic acid group, making it inconsistent with the IR and NMR data. Additionally, the branching pattern does not match the NMR signals.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
The reaction conditions (red phosphorus and HI) are typically used for the hydrolysis of esters to carboxylic acids. However, the initial compound is already identified as a carboxylic acid (Option C). Since the compound is not an ester, the reaction would not alter its structure. Therefore, the product remains the same as the initial compound.

### Conclusion:
The initial compound is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid** (Option C). The reaction with red phosphorus and HI does not change the structure, so the final product is also **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

**Answer: C**
