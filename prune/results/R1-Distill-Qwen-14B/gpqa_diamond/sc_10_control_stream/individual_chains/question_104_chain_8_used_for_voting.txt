Okay, so I have this question about exoplanets and the radial velocity method. I've heard a bit about this before, but I'm a bit rusty, so I'll need to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, so the setup is that there are two stars, same mass as the Sun, and each has a planet with mass similar to Neptune. They found these using the radial velocity (RV) method. RV detects planets by the Doppler shift in the star's spectrum as the planet's gravity makes the star wobble.

The key data points here are the periodic shifts in the spectral lines. Planet #1 causes a shift of up to 5 milliangstroms, and planet #2 causes a 7 milliangstrom shift. The question is asking how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1.

Wait, I remember that the RV method measures the star's velocity towards and away from us, which is related to the planet's mass and the size of the orbit. The formula I think relates the velocity semi-amplitude (K) to the mass of the planet and the orbital period.

The formula I vaguely recall is K = (v) = (2πG)^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (P)^(1/3) ) )^(1/1) ), but I might be mixing up terms. Alternatively, another formula I remember is that the semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p / (M_star^2))^(1/3) * (1/P)^(1/3), but I'm not sure if that's right. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about the relation between the velocity shift and the period. The RV shift (K) is proportional to the star's velocity due to the planet. So K is the semi-amplitude of the star's velocity. The star's velocity is given by v = (2πa) / P, where a is the semi-major axis of the star's orbit around the barycenter. But since the planet is much less massive than the star, a is approximately (M_p/(M_star + M_p)) * a_total, where a_total is the semi-major axis of the planet's orbit.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the mass function and the Keplerian equations.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p)^3 * sin^3 i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 * (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2π)) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3))

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the formula for K in terms of the planet's orbital parameters.

The formula I remember is:

K = [ (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) ) ] * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But maybe a more simplified version is:

K ∝ (M_p / M_star^2)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but since the planets have similar masses to Neptune, which is much less than the Sun's mass, M_p << M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So we can approximate M_star + M_p as M_star for both planets.

Therefore, the formula simplifies. Let's denote K1 and K2 as the velocity semi-amplitudes for planet 1 and 2 respectively.

K = ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (2π / (P G^(1/3)) )^(something) )

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for K from the RV method:

K = (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) * (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P) )^(1/3)

But since e is zero (because the orbits are circular), and M_p << M_star, this simplifies.

Let me think again. I think the correct formula is:

K = [ ( (G * M_p^3 ) / ( (M_star)^2 ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * c))^(1/3)

Wait, perhaps that's not right. Alternatively, maybe K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) )

Wait, here's a better approach: the RV semi-amplitude K can be written as:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But since M_p << M_star, this reduces to:

K ≈ ( constant ) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

So, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) )

But in this problem, both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar masses to Neptune. So M_p is the same for both planets, and M_star is the same for both stars. Therefore, the ratio of K1 to K2 depends only on the inverse cube root of the periods.

Wait, but K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitude shifts for the two planets. So for each planet, K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3).

So, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) )

But in the question, the shift for planet 1 is 5 milliangstrom, and for planet 2 it's 7. So K1 is 5, K2 is7.

Wait, actually, no. Correction: the question says that planet #1 has a shift up to 5 milliangstrom, and planet #2's shift is 7. So K1 =5, K2=7.

So, K1/K2 =5/7.

But from the proportionality, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

So,

5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So,

P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

Wait, that would make P2 smaller than P1. Because (5/7) is less than 1, and cubed is even smaller.

But the question is asking, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1. So, that would be P2 / P1.

From (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So that would make the orbital period of planet #2 about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter? Wait, no. Wait, K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), so if K is larger, that would imply a smaller P.

Because K increases as P decreases. Because K is inversely proportional to the cube root of P.

So if K1=5, K2=7, which is larger than K1, so K2 is larger, so P2 must be smaller than P1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1.

So the ratio is P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1, meaning it's shorter.

So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's? It's shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be ~0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula to make sure I didn't get the proportion reversed.

So if K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is some constant.

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So 5/7 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Cube both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1 → P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3 → which is P2 = (125/343) P1 ≈ 0.364 P1.

So P2 is shorter than P1, so the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1. So the factor is 0.364, which is option A.

But wait, let me make sure that the formula is correct. Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * ( (2π) / (c * P) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps a better formula is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But since e=0 and M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (27 pi G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But since M_p and M_* are same for both planets, the ratio K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → so rearranged, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, wait, no. Let me see.

If K1 = (C) / P1^(1/3), and K2 = (C) / P2^(1/3), then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So, 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2 is (5/7)^3 of P1, which is approximately 0.364 times.

So yes, the ratio P2/P1 is 0.364.

So the answer is option A.

The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given their respective radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude shifts. Both planets orbit stars with the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar masses to Neptune. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period. Since the stars and planets are otherwise identical, the ratio of the periods can be derived from the ratio of the RV shifts.

The RV semi-amplitude shifts are given as \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for planet #1 and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for planet #2. Using the proportionality \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), the relationship between the periods is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}.
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):

\[
\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately \( 0.364 \) times the orbital period of planet #1. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1 by a factor of \( 0.364 \).

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the mass function and the Keplerian equations.

The RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = [ (G * (M_p)^3 * sin^3 i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^2 * (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (2π)) )^(1/3) * (1 / (P)^(1/3))

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to consider the formula for K in terms of the planet's orbital parameters.

The formula I remember is:

K = [ (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) ) ] * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But maybe a more simplified version is:

K ∝ (M_p / M_star^2)^(1/3) * (1 / P^(1/3)) )

Wait, but since the planets have similar masses to Neptune, which is much less than the Sun's mass, M_p << M_star. So M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So we can approximate M_star + M_p as M_star for both planets.

Therefore, the formula simplifies. Let's denote K1 and K2 as the velocity semi-amplitudes for planet 1 and 2 respectively.

K = ( (M_p sin i) / (M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (2π / (P G^(1/3)) )^(something) )

K = (v) = [ (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) * (1 - e^2) ) ) ]^(1/3) * (2π / P) )^(1/3)

But since e is zero (because the orbits are circular), and M_p << M_star, this simplifies.

Let me think again. I think the correct formula is:

K = [ ( (G * M_p^3 ) / ( (M_star)^2 ) ) ]^(1/3) * (1 / (P * c))^(1/3)

Wait, perhaps that's not right. Alternatively, maybe K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) * P^(1/3)) )

Wait, here's a better approach: the RV semi-amplitude K can be written as:

K = ( (27 * pi * G) / (4 * c^3) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / (P^(1/3)) )

But since M_p << M_star, this reduces to:

K ≈ ( constant ) * (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3)) * (1/P^(1/3)) )

So, K is proportional to (M_p) / (M_star^(2/3) P^(1/3)) )

But in this problem, both stars have the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar masses to Neptune. So M_p is the same for both planets, and M_star is the same for both stars. Therefore, the ratio of K1 to K2 depends only on the inverse cube root of the periods.

Wait, but K1 and K2 are the semi-amplitude shifts for the two planets. So for each planet, K is proportional to 1 / P^(1/3).

So, K1/K2 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3) )

But in the question, the shift for planet 1 is 5 milliangstrom, and for planet 2 it's 7. So K1 is 5, K2 is7.

Wait, actually, no. Correction: the question says that planet #1 has a shift up to 5 milliangstrom, and planet #2's shift is 7. So K1 =5, K2=7.

So, K1/K2 =5/7.

But from the proportionality, K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) )

So,

5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

Raise both sides to the power of 3:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1

So,

P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3

Wait, that would make P2 smaller than P1. Because (5/7) is less than 1, and cubed is even smaller.

But the question is asking, how many times longer is the orbital period of planet #2 than that of planet #1. So, that would be P2 / P1.

From (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 = 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So that would make the orbital period of planet #2 about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So planet #2's period is shorter? Wait, no. Wait, K is proportional to 1/(P^(1/3)), so if K is larger, that would imply a smaller P.

Because K increases as P decreases. Because K is inversely proportional to the cube root of P.

So if K1=5, K2=7, which is larger than K1, so K2 is larger, so P2 must be smaller than P1.

Wait, but the question is asking how many times longer is P2 than P1.

So the ratio is P2/P1 = (5/7)^3 ≈ 125/343 ≈ 0.364.

So P2 is about 0.364 times P1, meaning it's shorter.

So the period of planet #2 is about 0.36 times that of planet #1. So how many times longer is planet #2's period than planet #1's? It's shorter, so it's 0.36 times as long. So the answer would be ~0.36, which is option A.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula to make sure I didn't get the proportion reversed.

So if K is proportional to 1/P^(1/3), then K1 = C / P1^(1/3), K2 = C / P2^(1/3), where C is some constant.

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3)

So 5/7 = (P2 / P1)^(1/3)

Cube both sides:

(5/7)^3 = P2/P1 → P2 = P1 * (5/7)^3 → which is P2 = (125/343) P1 ≈ 0.364 P1.

So P2 is shorter than P1, so the question is, how many times longer is P2 than P1. So the factor is 0.364, which is option A.

But wait, let me make sure that the formula is correct. Another approach: the RV semi-amplitude K is given by the formula:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(1/3) ) ) * ( (2π) / (c * P) ) )^(1/3) )

Wait, no, perhaps a better formula is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_* + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But since e=0 and M_p << M_*, this simplifies to:

K ≈ ( (27 pi G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p ) / ( M_*^(2/3) ) * (1 / (P)^(1/3) )

But since M_p and M_* are same for both planets, the ratio K1/K2 = (P2 / P1 )^(1/3 )

So K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → so rearranged, P2/P1 = (K1/K2)^3.

Wait, wait, no. Let me see.

If K1 = (C) / P1^(1/3), and K2 = (C) / P2^(1/3), then K1/K2 = (P2/P1)^(1/3).

So, 5/7 = (P2/P1)^(1/3) → (5/7)^3 = P2/P1.

So P2 is (5/7)^3 of P1, which is approximately 0.364 times.

So yes, the ratio P2/P1 is 0.364.

So the answer is option A.


The question involves determining how many times longer the orbital period of planet #2 is compared to planet #1, given their respective radial velocity (RV) semi-amplitude shifts. Both planets orbit stars with the same mass as the Sun, and the planets have similar masses to Neptune. The RV semi-amplitude \( K \) is proportional to \( \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), where \( P \) is the orbital period. Since the stars and planets are otherwise identical, the ratio of the periods can be derived from the ratio of the RV shifts.

The RV semi-amplitude shifts are given as \( K_1 = 5 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for planet #1 and \( K_2 = 7 \, \text{milliangstroms} \) for planet #2. Using the proportionality \( K \propto \frac{1}{P^{1/3}} \), the relationship between the periods is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\frac{5}{7} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Cubing both sides:

\[
\left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 = \frac{P_2}{P_1}.
\]

Calculating \( \left(\frac{5}{7}\right)^3 \):

\[
\frac{5^3}{7^3} = \frac{125}{343} \approx 0.364.
\]

Thus, the orbital period of planet #2 is approximately \( 0.364 \) times the orbital period of planet #1. This means the orbital period of planet #2 is shorter than that of planet #1 by a factor of \( 0.364 \).

The correct answer is:

**Answer: A**
