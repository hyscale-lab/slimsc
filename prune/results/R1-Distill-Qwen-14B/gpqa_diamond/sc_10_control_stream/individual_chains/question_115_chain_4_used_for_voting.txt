Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down.

So, the setup: there's an electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured—one is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Hmm. I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and energy and momentum must be conserved. Since both particles are moving along the horizontal axis, the collision is probably head-on. Also, the positron is the antimatter counterpart of the electron, so when they collide, they annihilate into energy, which in this case is two photons.

Wait, but the photon directions are both to the right. So one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So the angle between them would be the angle between two vectors that are both in the right half-plane, one above the x-axis, the other below.

Since the problem states that the two photons have the same energy, their magnitudes of momentum are the same because photons have E = pc. So each photon's momentum vector has the same magnitude.

So, let's model this. Before the collision, we have the electron and positron moving towards each other. Let's set up a coordinate system where the electron is moving along the positive x-direction, and the positron along the negative x-direction. Wait no, the problem says the positron is moving from the right, so maybe in the same direction as the electron? Wait no, the electron is moving from the left, positron from the right, so they're moving towards each other along the same line. So their velocities are in opposite directions along the x-axis.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma. So for the electron, gamma is 4, and for the positron, gamma is 2.

Wait, but wait, when considering momentum, we have to take into account the direction. So the electron's momentum is positive x, and the positron's is negative x? Or positive x for both? Let me clarify.

The electron is moving from the left, so along positive x; the positron is moving from the right, so along negative x. So their momenta are in opposite directions.

Wait, but wait: I think I might have that wrong. The positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, so that's the same direction as the electron if the electron is moving from the left. Wait no, the positron is moving from the right towards the left? Or is it moving along the same direction as the electron? Hmm.

Wait, the question says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if the electron is moving from left to right, the positron is moving from right to left? Or wait, no, "from the right" might mean it's moving towards the left. So their velocities are in opposite directions.

So when they collide, they annihilate. Now, after annihilation, the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So both have a positive x-component of momentum. Wait, that's interesting, because the initial momenta of the electron and positron were in opposite directions.

Wait, but let's think about momentum conservation. The total momentum before annihilation must equal the total momentum after.

So let's compute the initial momentum. For the electron, moving left to right (so positive x), gamma is 4. Its momentum p_e = gamma * m_e * v_e. Wait, but wait—v_e can be expressed as (sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)) c. But perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of gamma.

Wait, but in terms of momentum, the magnitude is p = gamma * m_e * v, but since v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2), perhaps I can compute it as p = (gamma m_e v).

But maybe a better approach is to consider that for a particle moving at speed v, the momentum is p = gamma m v. Alternatively, since v = c * beta, p = gamma m_e beta c.

Wait, but for a positron, which is the same mass as an electron, but with opposite charge. But in terms of momentum, since the positron is moving from the right (so in the opposite direction to the electron), its velocity is in the negative x direction. So, the positron's momentum is negative.

So, the initial momentum is the sum of the electron's momentum and the positron's momentum.

Electron: gamma_e =4, moving right, so p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But v_e is positive.

Positron: gamma_p =2, moving left, so p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p, but since it's moving left, v_p is negative. So p_p is negative.

So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p.

But wait, what are the velocities? Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), beta is v/c. So beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_e^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682 c.

Similarly, beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660 c.

So the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e c.

Similarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p (-c) [since it's moving left].

So:

p_initial = gamma_e m_e beta_e c + gamma_p m_e beta_p (-c)

Plugging in the numbers:

gamma_e =4, beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682,

gamma_p=2, beta_p = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So,

p_initial = [4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c ] + [2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) (-c) ]

Simplify each term:

First term: 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e sqrt(15) c.

Second term: 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) (-c) = m_e sqrt(3) (-c).

So, p_initial = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c.

Factor out m_e c:

p_initial = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )

Now, the photons after annihilation must have a combined momentum equal to this.

Each photon has momentum p = E/c, since for photons E = pc. Also, the problem says both photons have the same energy, so same magnitude of momentum. Let's denote each photon's momentum as p1 and p2.

Since the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, their momentum vectors have positive x-components and positive and negative y-components, respectively.

Wait, no. No, wait, the upper-right has a positive x and positive y component. The lower-right would have positive x and negative y. So their y components are opposite.

So, the momentum vectors are p1 = (p_x, p_y) and p2 = (p_x', p_y').

But the photons have the same energy, so |p1| = |p2| = E/c. Let me denote E_photon = E. So, p1 = (E_x, E_y) and p2 = (F_x, F_y), but with |p1|=|p2|=E/c.

Wait, no, each photon's momentum vector has magnitude E/c, and direction at some angle. So for photon 1, direction is theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 is phi below the x-axis.

Wait, but since both are moving to the right, their x-components are positive, and the y-components are positive and negative, respectively.

So, the sum of their momenta must equal the initial total momentum.

So, the total momentum after annihilation is p_final = p1 + p2.

Each photon's momentum is a vector. Let's denote the angles of the photons as theta and (360 - theta), but since they are in opposite quadrants, it's more likely theta and -theta, but in terms of direction, perhaps theta and 360 - theta. Wait, no, if one is upper right, the other is lower right, their angles would be theta and -theta, but measured from the x-axis.

Wait, but in the question, the directions are upper-right and lower-right. So perhaps both have positive x-components, and one has a positive y, and the other negative.

So, for photon 1, the direction is at an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 is at an angle theta below the x-axis, but since directions are symmetric, maybe the angles are symmetric about the x-axis. But wait, the problem says they have the same energy, so same magnitude of momentum vectors. So their momenta are symmetric in the y-axis.

Wait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So their y-components are opposite in sign. So when you add their momentum vectors, the y-components would cancel each other if they are symmetric. But is that the case?

Wait, no. Because the initial momentum is along the x-axis, so the total y-component after must be zero. So the sum of the y-components of the two photons must be zero. So, if photon 1 has a y-component of +p_y, photon 2 must have a y-component of -p_y. So their magnitudes are the same but directions opposite.

So, let me model this.

Photon 1: momentum vector (p_x, p_y)

Photon 2: momentum vector (p_x', -p_y)

Because the sum of their y-components must be zero. So, p_y - p_y = 0. So p1_y = p2_y in magnitude but opposite in sign.

Wait, but their magnitudes are the same because their energies are the same. So |p1| = |p2|.

So, |p1|^2 = (p_x)^2 + (p_y)^2.

|p2|^2 = (p_x')^2 + (p_y)^2.

Since |p1| = |p2|, then (p_x)^2 + (p_y)^2 = (p_x')^2 + (p_y)^2.

So, p_x^2 = p_x'^2. So, p_x = p_x' or p_x = -p_x'.

But since both photons are moving to the right, their p_x must be positive. So, p_x = p_x'.

So both photons have the same x-component of momentum.

So, the sum of the x-components is p_x + p_x' = 2 p_x.

But the initial total momentum along x is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So, the sum of the x-momentum of the photons must be equal to this.

So, 2 p_x = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But also, each photon's momentum magnitude is E/c. Let's denote E as the energy of each photon, so |p1| = |p2| = E/c.

So, for photon 1:

p_x^2 + p_y^2 = (E/c)^2.

Similarly for photon 2, but since p2's y-component is -p_y, but same equation applies.

Since p_x is the same for both, we can write:

p_x = (E/c) cos(theta), where theta is the angle of photon 1 above the x-axis.

p_y = (E/c) sin(theta).

Similarly, for photon 2, the angle is -theta, but the same applies.

So, p_x = (E/c) cos(theta) for both.

But according to the earlier equation, 2 p_x = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So,

2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But wait, since E is the energy of each photon, and each has momentum (E/c), we can write E as pc, but perhaps that's complicating.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of E.

We have for each photon:

p_x = (E/c) cos(theta).

p_y = (E/c) sin(theta).

So, the sum of the x-components is 2*(E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So,

(E/c) cos(theta) = [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / 2.

But we can write E in terms of momentum. So,

E = p c.

Wait, but each photon's momentum is E/c, so that's consistent.

Wait, maybe I can find E in terms of the initial momentum.

Alternatively, let's think about energy conservation. The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the electron's and positron's energies.

The electron's energy is gamma_e m_e c^2, and the positron's energy is gamma_p m_e c^2.

So,

E_initial = gamma_e m_e c^2 + gamma_p m_e c^2 = (4 + 2) m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.

After annihilation, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the two photons, which is 2E.

So,

2E = 6 m_e c^2 → E = 3 m_e c^2.

So each photon has energy E = 3 m_e c^2.

Wait, that's interesting. So each photon's energy is 3 m_e c^2.

But wait, that can't be right. Because when an electron and positron annihilate, they produce two photons each with energy equal to the rest mass energy of the electron, which is 0.511 MeV each. So two photons, each about 0.511 MeV. But here, the total energy is 6 m_e c^2, which is 6 * 0.511 MeV, so two photons each with 3 * 0.511 MeV? Hmm, but wait, that's possible because the particles are moving and have kinetic energy.

Wait, but in this problem, the initial particles are moving with Lorentz factors of 4 and 2, so their energies are much larger than their rest mass energy.

Wait, but let's proceed.

So each photon has E = 3 m_e c^2.

So, E = 3 m_e c^2.

Then, the momentum of each photon is E/c = 3 m_e c.

So, |p| = 3 m_e c for each photon.

So, the momentum vectors of the two photons are (3 m_e c cos(theta), 3 m_e c sin(theta)) and (3 m_e c cos(theta'), 3 m_e c sin(theta')).

But wait, earlier we concluded that the y-components must cancel, so one photon has positive y and the other negative. So, theta' = -theta.

Wait, no. Because in our earlier analysis, the positron is moving left, the electron right, leading to initial momentum along the x-axis.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The two photons have their y-components opposite, so their sum is zero. So, for the two photons, their y-components are +p_y and -p_y, so p_y = 3 m_e c sin(theta), and -p_y = ... So, to get p_y = - p_y for the two, that implies that one photon has theta and the other has -theta, so their y-components are +p_y and -p_y. But since both are going to the right, their x-components are positive.

So, each photon's momentum is:

Photon 1: (3 m_e c cos(theta), 3 m_e c sin(theta)).

Photon 2: (3 m_e c cos(theta), -3 m_e c sin(theta)).

Wait, but that's not correct because if photon 2 has the same theta, then the y-components would cancel. Alternatively, if they have opposite angles, like theta and -theta, then their y-components would cancel.

Wait, but the problem states that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right, which suggests that their angles are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. So, if one is at angle theta above the x-axis, the other is at theta below, but both have positive x-components.

So, their momentum vectors would be (p_x, p_y) and (p_x, -p_y).

So, summing their x-components: 2 p_x = initial x momentum.

Sum their y-components: p_y - p_y = 0.

So, yes, that's correct.

Now, each photon's magnitude of momentum is 3 m_e c.

So, for photon 1,

p_x = 3 m_e c cos(theta),

p_y = 3 m_e c sin(theta).

Similarly, photon 2 has p_x = 3 m_e c cos(theta), p_y = -3 m_e c sin(theta).

So, the sum of their x-components is 2 * 3 m_e c cos(theta) = 6 m_e c cos(theta).

And this must equal the initial momentum along x, which is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So,

6 m_e c cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

We can cancel m_e c from both sides:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So,

cos(theta) = [ sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ] / 6.

Let me compute that.

Compute numerator: sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205.

So, sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.

Divide by 6: 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.35682.

So, cos(theta) ≈ 0.35682.

Now, theta is the angle above the x-axis for photon 1.

So, theta ≈ arccos(0.35682) ≈ around 69 degrees (since cos(60) is 0.5, cos(90)=0, so 0.356 is about 69 degrees.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator: arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69 degrees. Let me check:

cos(69 degrees) is approximately 0.3584, which is close to 0.3568. So approximately 69 degrees.

So, theta is about 69 degrees, so the two photons are at angles theta and -theta from the x-axis.

The angle between them is 2 theta, since one is at +theta and the other at -theta.

So, the angle between the two photons is 2 * 69 ≈ 138 degrees.

Wait, but let me be precise. Let me compute it with the exact values.

Wait, cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] /6.

Let me compute [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] ≈ 3.872983 - 1.7320508 ≈ 2.14093.

Divide by 6: 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.35682.

So theta ≈ arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69 degrees.

So, the angle between the photons is 2*69=138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138 degrees.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with the initial momentum calculation.

Wait, initial momentum was p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

sqrt(15)=3.872983346, sqrt(3)=1.7320508075.

So, sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 3.872983346 -1.7320508075 = 2.1409325385.

So,

6 cos(theta) = 2.1409325385.

cos(theta) = 2.1409325385 /6 ≈ 0.3568220898.

Now, what angle has a cosine of approximately 0.3568?

Using a calculator:

arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69 degrees.

But wait, let me check.

cos(69 degrees) = cos(1.204 radians) ≈ approximately 0.3584.

Which is close to 0.3568.

So, the angle theta is approximately 69 degrees.

Thus, the two photons are each 69 degrees above and below the x-axis, so the angle between them is 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138.

So, the answer should be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of the electron and positron, followed by the production of two photons. The key principles are conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.

### Step 1: Initial Momentum
The electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis with Lorentz factors of 4 and 2, respectively. Their momenta are:

- **Electron momentum**:  
  \[
  p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_e^2}} = 4 m_e c \cdot \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} = m_e c \sqrt{15}.
  \]

- **Positron momentum**:  
  \[
  p_p = \gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}} = 2 m_e c \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = m_e c \sqrt{3}.
  \]

Since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative. The total initial momentum is:  
\[
p_{\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]

### Step 2: Energy Conservation
The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:  
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.
\]

After annihilation, the total energy is shared equally between the two photons:  
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{initial}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2.
\]

### Step 3: Photon Momentum
Each photon has energy \( E_{\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c^2 \), and since \( E = pc \) for photons, the magnitude of the momentum of each photon is:  
\[
p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = 3 m_e c.
\]

The two photons are moving in directions symmetric about the x-axis, with angles \( \theta \) above and below the x-axis. Their momentum components are:  
- Photon 1: \( p_x = 3 m_e c \cos\theta, \, p_y = 3 m_e c \sin\theta \),
- Photon 2: \( p_x = 3 m_e c \cos\theta, \, p_y = -3 m_e c \sin\theta \).

### Step 4: Conservation of Momentum
The total momentum after annihilation is the sum of the photon momenta:  
\[
p_{\text{final}} = (2 \cdot 3 m_e c \cos\theta, \, 0).
\]

Equating this to the initial momentum along the x-axis:  
\[
2 \cdot 3 m_e c \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]

Simplify:  
\[
6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}.
\]

\[
\cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
\]

### Step 5: Compute \( \theta \)
Using approximations:  
\[
\sqrt{15} \approx 3.873, \, \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732.
\]

\[
\cos\theta = \frac{3.873 - 1.732}{6} = \frac{2.141}{6} \approx 0.3568.
\]

\[
\theta \approx \arccos(0.3568) \approx 69^\circ.
\]

### Step 6: Angle Between Photons
The two photons are symmetrically placed at angles \( \theta \) and \( -\theta \) relative to the x-axis. The angle between them is:  
\[
\phi = 2\theta \approx 2 \cdot 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
\]

### Final Answer
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again and break it down.

So, the setup: there's an electron moving along the horizontal axis from the left with a Lorentz factor of 4. Then there's a positron moving along the same horizontal axis but from the right with a Lorentz factor of 2. They collide and annihilate, producing two photons. Both photons have the same energy, and their directions are measured—one is moving upper-right, the other lower-right. The question is asking for the angle between their directions.

Hmm. I remember that when particles annihilate, they produce photons, and energy and momentum must be conserved. Since both particles are moving along the horizontal axis, the collision is probably head-on. Also, the positron is the antimatter counterpart of the electron, so when they collide, they annihilate into energy, which in this case is two photons.

Wait, but the photon directions are both to the right. So one is upper-right, the other lower-right. So the angle between them would be the angle between two vectors that are both in the right half-plane, one above the x-axis, the other below.

Since the problem states that the two photons have the same energy, their magnitudes of momentum are the same because photons have E = pc. So each photon's momentum vector has the same magnitude.

So, let's model this. Before the collision, we have the electron and positron moving towards each other. Let's set up a coordinate system where the electron is moving along the positive x-direction, and the positron along the negative x-direction. Wait no, the problem says the positron is moving from the right, so maybe in the same direction as the electron? Wait no, the electron is moving from the left, positron from the right, so they're moving towards each other along the same line. So their velocities are in opposite directions along the x-axis.

Wait, Lorentz factor is gamma. So for the electron, gamma is 4, and for the positron, gamma is 2.

Wait, but wait, when considering momentum, we have to take into account the direction. So the electron's momentum is positive x, and the positron's is negative x? Or positive x for both? Let me clarify.

The electron is moving from the left, so along positive x; the positron is moving from the right, so along negative x. So their momenta are in opposite directions.

Wait, but wait: I think I might have that wrong. The positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right, so that's the same direction as the electron if the electron is moving from the left. Wait no, the positron is moving from the right towards the left? Or is it moving along the same direction as the electron? Hmm.

Wait, the question says the positron is moving along the horizontal axis from the right. So if the electron is moving from left to right, the positron is moving from right to left? Or wait, no, "from the right" might mean it's moving towards the left. So their velocities are in opposite directions.

So when they collide, they annihilate. Now, after annihilation, the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions. So both have a positive x-component of momentum. Wait, that's interesting, because the initial momenta of the electron and positron were in opposite directions.

Wait, but let's think about momentum conservation. The total momentum before annihilation must equal the total momentum after.

So let's compute the initial momentum. For the electron, moving left to right (so positive x), gamma is 4. Its momentum p_e = gamma * m_e * v_e. Wait, but wait—v_e can be expressed as (sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2)) c. But perhaps it's easier to compute in terms of gamma.

Wait, but in terms of momentum, the magnitude is p = gamma * m_e * v, but since v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2), perhaps I can compute it as p = (gamma m_e v).

But maybe a better approach is to consider that for a particle moving at speed v, the momentum is p = gamma m v. Alternatively, since v = c * beta, p = gamma m_e beta c.

Wait, but for a positron, which is the same mass as an electron, but with opposite charge. But in terms of momentum, since the positron is moving from the right (so in the opposite direction to the electron), its velocity is in the negative x direction. So, the positron's momentum is negative.

So, the initial momentum is the sum of the electron's momentum and the positron's momentum.

Electron: gamma_e =4, moving right, so p_e = gamma_e * m_e * v_e. But v_e is positive.

Positron: gamma_p =2, moving left, so p_p = gamma_p * m_e * v_p, but since it's moving left, v_p is negative. So p_p is negative.

So the total initial momentum is p_initial = p_e + p_p.

But wait, what are the velocities? Since gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - beta^2), beta is v/c. So beta_e = sqrt(1 - 1/gamma_e^2) = sqrt(1 - 1/16) = sqrt(15/16) = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682 c.

Similarly, beta_p = sqrt(1 - 1/4) = sqrt(3/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660 c.

So the electron's momentum is p_e = gamma_e * m_e * beta_e c.

Similarly, the positron's momentum is p_p = gamma_p * m_e * beta_p (-c) [since it's moving left].

So:

p_initial = gamma_e m_e beta_e c + gamma_p m_e beta_p (-c)

Plugging in the numbers:

gamma_e =4, beta_e = sqrt(15)/4 ≈ 0.9682,

gamma_p=2, beta_p = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

So,

p_initial = [4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c ] + [2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) (-c) ]

Simplify each term:

First term: 4 * m_e * (sqrt(15)/4) c = m_e sqrt(15) c.

Second term: 2 * m_e * (sqrt(3)/2) (-c) = m_e sqrt(3) (-c).

So, p_initial = m_e sqrt(15) c - m_e sqrt(3) c.

Factor out m_e c:

p_initial = m_e c ( sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) )

Now, the photons after annihilation must have a combined momentum equal to this.

Each photon has momentum p = E/c, since for photons E = pc. Also, the problem says both photons have the same energy, so same magnitude of momentum. Let's denote each photon's momentum as p1 and p2.

Since the photons are moving in the upper-right and lower-right directions, their momentum vectors have positive x-components and positive and negative y-components, respectively.

Wait, no. No, wait, the upper-right has a positive x and positive y component. The lower-right would have positive x and negative y. So their y components are opposite.

So, the momentum vectors are p1 = (p_x, p_y) and p2 = (p_x', p_y').

But the photons have the same energy, so |p1| = |p2| = E/c. Let me denote E_photon = E. So, p1 = (E_x, E_y) and p2 = (F_x, F_y), but with |p1|=|p2|=E/c.

Wait, no, each photon's momentum vector has magnitude E/c, and direction at some angle. So for photon 1, direction is theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 is phi below the x-axis.

Wait, but since both are moving to the right, their x-components are positive, and the y-components are positive and negative, respectively.

So, the sum of their momenta must equal the initial total momentum.

So, the total momentum after annihilation is p_final = p1 + p2.

Each photon's momentum is a vector. Let's denote the angles of the photons as theta and (360 - theta), but since they are in opposite quadrants, it's more likely theta and -theta, but in terms of direction, perhaps theta and 360 - theta. Wait, no, if one is upper right, the other is lower right, their angles would be theta and -theta, but measured from the x-axis.

Wait, but in the question, the directions are upper-right and lower-right. So perhaps both have positive x-components, and one has a positive y, and the other negative.

So, for photon 1, the direction is at an angle theta above the x-axis, and photon 2 is at an angle theta below the x-axis, but since directions are symmetric, maybe the angles are symmetric about the x-axis. But wait, the problem says they have the same energy, so same magnitude of momentum vectors. So their momenta are symmetric in the y-axis.

Wait, but the problem says one is upper-right and the other is lower-right. So their y-components are opposite in sign. So when you add their momentum vectors, the y-components would cancel each other if they are symmetric. But is that the case?

Wait, no. Because the initial momentum is along the x-axis, so the total y-component after must be zero. So the sum of the y-components of the two photons must be zero. So, if photon 1 has a y-component of +p_y, photon 2 must have a y-component of -p_y. So their magnitudes are the same but directions opposite.

So, let me model this.

Photon 1: momentum vector (p_x, p_y)

Photon 2: momentum vector (p_x', -p_y)

Because the sum of their y-components must be zero. So, p_y - p_y = 0. So p1_y = p2_y in magnitude but opposite in sign.

Wait, but their magnitudes are the same because their energies are the same. So |p1| = |p2|.

So, |p1|^2 = (p_x)^2 + (p_y)^2.

|p2|^2 = (p_x')^2 + (p_y)^2.

Since |p1| = |p2|, then (p_x)^2 + (p_y)^2 = (p_x')^2 + (p_y)^2.

So, p_x^2 = p_x'^2. So, p_x = p_x' or p_x = -p_x'.

But since both photons are moving to the right, their p_x must be positive. So, p_x = p_x'.

So both photons have the same x-component of momentum.

So, the sum of the x-components is p_x + p_x' = 2 p_x.

But the initial total momentum along x is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So, the sum of the x-momentum of the photons must be equal to this.

So, 2 p_x = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But also, each photon's momentum magnitude is E/c. Let's denote E as the energy of each photon, so |p1| = |p2| = E/c.

So, for photon 1:

p_x^2 + p_y^2 = (E/c)^2.

Similarly for photon 2, but since p2's y-component is -p_y, but same equation applies.

Since p_x is the same for both, we can write:

p_x = (E/c) cos(theta), where theta is the angle of photon 1 above the x-axis.

p_y = (E/c) sin(theta).

Similarly, for photon 2, the angle is -theta, but the same applies.

So, p_x = (E/c) cos(theta) for both.

But according to the earlier equation, 2 p_x = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So,

2 (E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

But wait, since E is the energy of each photon, and each has momentum (E/c), we can write E as pc, but perhaps that's complicating.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express everything in terms of E.

We have for each photon:

p_x = (E/c) cos(theta).

p_y = (E/c) sin(theta).

So, the sum of the x-components is 2*(E/c) cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So,

(E/c) cos(theta) = [ m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)) ] / 2.

But we can write E in terms of momentum. So,

E = p c.

Wait, but each photon's momentum is E/c, so that's consistent.

Wait, maybe I can find E in terms of the initial momentum.

Alternatively, let's think about energy conservation. The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the electron's and positron's energies.

The electron's energy is gamma_e m_e c^2, and the positron's energy is gamma_p m_e c^2.

So,

E_initial = gamma_e m_e c^2 + gamma_p m_e c^2 = (4 + 2) m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.

After annihilation, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the two photons, which is 2E.

So,

2E = 6 m_e c^2 → E = 3 m_e c^2.

So each photon has energy E = 3 m_e c^2.

Wait, that's interesting. So each photon's energy is 3 m_e c^2.

But wait, that can't be right. Because when an electron and positron annihilate, they produce two photons each with energy equal to the rest mass energy of the electron, which is 0.511 MeV each. So two photons, each about 0.511 MeV. But here, the total energy is 6 m_e c^2, which is 6 * 0.511 MeV, so two photons each with 3 * 0.511 MeV? Hmm, but wait, that's possible because the particles are moving and have kinetic energy.

Wait, but in this problem, the initial particles are moving with Lorentz factors of 4 and 2, so their energies are much larger than their rest mass energy.

Wait, but let's proceed.

So each photon has E = 3 m_e c^2.

So, E = 3 m_e c^2.

Then, the momentum of each photon is E/c = 3 m_e c.

So, |p| = 3 m_e c for each photon.

So, the momentum vectors of the two photons are (3 m_e c cos(theta), 3 m_e c sin(theta)) and (3 m_e c cos(theta'), 3 m_e c sin(theta')).

But wait, earlier we concluded that the y-components must cancel, so one photon has positive y and the other negative. So, theta' = -theta.

Wait, no. Because in our earlier analysis, the positron is moving left, the electron right, leading to initial momentum along the x-axis.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The two photons have their y-components opposite, so their sum is zero. So, for the two photons, their y-components are +p_y and -p_y, so p_y = 3 m_e c sin(theta), and -p_y = ... So, to get p_y = - p_y for the two, that implies that one photon has theta and the other has -theta, so their y-components are +p_y and -p_y. But since both are going to the right, their x-components are positive.

So, each photon's momentum is:

Photon 1: (3 m_e c cos(theta), 3 m_e c sin(theta)).

Photon 2: (3 m_e c cos(theta), -3 m_e c sin(theta)).

Wait, but that's not correct because if photon 2 has the same theta, then the y-components would cancel. Alternatively, if they have opposite angles, like theta and -theta, then their y-components would cancel.

Wait, but the problem states that one is moving upper-right and the other lower-right, which suggests that their angles are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. So, if one is at angle theta above the x-axis, the other is at theta below, but both have positive x-components.

So, their momentum vectors would be (p_x, p_y) and (p_x, -p_y).

So, summing their x-components: 2 p_x = initial x momentum.

Sum their y-components: p_y - p_y = 0.

So, yes, that's correct.

Now, each photon's magnitude of momentum is 3 m_e c.

So, for photon 1,

p_x = 3 m_e c cos(theta),

p_y = 3 m_e c sin(theta).

Similarly, photon 2 has p_x = 3 m_e c cos(theta), p_y = -3 m_e c sin(theta).

So, the sum of their x-components is 2 * 3 m_e c cos(theta) = 6 m_e c cos(theta).

And this must equal the initial momentum along x, which is m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

So,

6 m_e c cos(theta) = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

We can cancel m_e c from both sides:

6 cos(theta) = sqrt(15) - sqrt(3).

So,

cos(theta) = [ sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ] / 6.

Let me compute that.

Compute numerator: sqrt(15) ≈ 3.87298, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.73205.

So, sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) ≈ 3.87298 - 1.73205 ≈ 2.14093.

Divide by 6: 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.35682.

So, cos(theta) ≈ 0.35682.

Now, theta is the angle above the x-axis for photon 1.

So, theta ≈ arccos(0.35682) ≈ around 69 degrees (since cos(60) is 0.5, cos(90)=0, so 0.356 is about 69 degrees.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator: arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69 degrees. Let me check:

cos(69 degrees) is approximately 0.3584, which is close to 0.3568. So approximately 69 degrees.

So, theta is about 69 degrees, so the two photons are at angles theta and -theta from the x-axis.

The angle between them is 2 theta, since one is at +theta and the other at -theta.

So, the angle between the two photons is 2 * 69 ≈ 138 degrees.

Wait, but let me be precise. Let me compute it with the exact values.

Wait, cos(theta) = [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] /6.

Let me compute [sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)] ≈ 3.872983 - 1.7320508 ≈ 2.14093.

Divide by 6: 2.14093 /6 ≈ 0.35682.

So theta ≈ arccos(0.35682) ≈ 69 degrees.

So, the angle between the photons is 2*69=138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138 degrees.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake with the initial momentum calculation.

Wait, initial momentum was p_initial = m_e c (sqrt(15) - sqrt(3)).

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

sqrt(15)=3.872983346, sqrt(3)=1.7320508075.

So, sqrt(15) - sqrt(3) = 3.872983346 -1.7320508075 = 2.1409325385.

So,

6 cos(theta) = 2.1409325385.

cos(theta) = 2.1409325385 /6 ≈ 0.3568220898.

Now, what angle has a cosine of approximately 0.3568?

Using a calculator:

arccos(0.3568) ≈ 69 degrees.

But wait, let me check.

cos(69 degrees) = cos(1.204 radians) ≈ approximately 0.3584.

Which is close to 0.3568.

So, the angle theta is approximately 69 degrees.

Thus, the two photons are each 69 degrees above and below the x-axis, so the angle between them is 138 degrees.

Looking at the options, option C is 138.

So, the answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we analyze the collision and annihilation of the electron and positron, followed by the production of two photons. The key principles are conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.

### Step 1: Initial Momentum
The electron and positron are moving along the horizontal axis with Lorentz factors of 4 and 2, respectively. Their momenta are:

- **Electron momentum**:  
  \[
  p_e = \gamma_e m_e v_e = 4 m_e c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_e^2}} = 4 m_e c \cdot \frac{\sqrt{15}}{4} = m_e c \sqrt{15}.
  \]

- **Positron momentum**:  
  \[
  p_p = \gamma_p m_e v_p = 2 m_e c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma_p^2}} = 2 m_e c \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = m_e c \sqrt{3}.
  \]

Since the positron is moving to the left, its momentum is negative. The total initial momentum is:  
\[
p_{\text{initial}} = p_e - p_p = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]

### Step 2: Energy Conservation
The total energy before annihilation is the sum of the energies of the electron and positron:  
\[
E_{\text{initial}} = \gamma_e m_e c^2 + \gamma_p m_e c^2 = 4 m_e c^2 + 2 m_e c^2 = 6 m_e c^2.
\]

After annihilation, the total energy is shared equally between the two photons:  
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{initial}}}{2} = 3 m_e c^2.
\]

### Step 3: Photon Momentum
Each photon has energy \( E_{\text{photon}} = 3 m_e c^2 \), and since \( E = pc \) for photons, the magnitude of the momentum of each photon is:  
\[
p_{\text{photon}} = \frac{E_{\text{photon}}}{c} = 3 m_e c.
\]

The two photons are moving in directions symmetric about the x-axis, with angles \( \theta \) above and below the x-axis. Their momentum components are:  
- Photon 1: \( p_x = 3 m_e c \cos\theta, \, p_y = 3 m_e c \sin\theta \),
- Photon 2: \( p_x = 3 m_e c \cos\theta, \, p_y = -3 m_e c \sin\theta \).

### Step 4: Conservation of Momentum
The total momentum after annihilation is the sum of the photon momenta:  
\[
p_{\text{final}} = (2 \cdot 3 m_e c \cos\theta, \, 0).
\]

Equating this to the initial momentum along the x-axis:  
\[
2 \cdot 3 m_e c \cos\theta = m_e c (\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}).
\]

Simplify:  
\[
6 \cos\theta = \sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}.
\]

\[
\cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{15} - \sqrt{3}}{6}.
\]

### Step 5: Compute \( \theta \)
Using approximations:  
\[
\sqrt{15} \approx 3.873, \, \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732.
\]

\[
\cos\theta = \frac{3.873 - 1.732}{6} = \frac{2.141}{6} \approx 0.3568.
\]

\[
\theta \approx \arccos(0.3568) \approx 69^\circ.
\]

### Step 6: Angle Between Photons
The two photons are symmetrically placed at angles \( \theta \) and \( -\theta \) relative to the x-axis. The angle between them is:  
\[
\phi = 2\theta \approx 2 \cdot 69^\circ = 138^\circ.
\]

### Final Answer
The angle between the directions of the photons is **138 degrees**.
