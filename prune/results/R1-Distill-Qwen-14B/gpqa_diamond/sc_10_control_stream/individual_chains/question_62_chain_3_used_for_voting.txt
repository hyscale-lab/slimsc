Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let's break this down.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, the main chain is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent attached. The substituent is a methyl group connected to another cyclohexane ring, and that methyl also has a hydroxyl group. Plus, the cyclohexane ring has a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde). So the structure would be something like a cyclohexane ring with a CH2 group attached, which is connected to another cyclohexyl group and an OH. And there's an aldehyde group on the same ring.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a carbon-carbon triple bond) attached. So, it's like cyclohexane-CC≡CH.

I need to figure out the reagents that transform ethynylcyclohexane into the target compound. Let's think about the possible reactions and the reagents involved.

Let me outline the possible steps. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a methyl group that also has an OH. So, probably some kind of alkylation or addition reaction. Also, the aldehyde suggests oxidation somewhere.

Looking at the options, the reagents vary, so I need to plan the synthesis pathway.

First, perhaps the triple bond in ethynylcyclohexane can be functionalized. Maybe a Grignard reaction? Or some kind of alkyne chemistry.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4 and HgSO4 with H2O. Let's see what each step does.

NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride is an alkylating agent. So first step might be deprotonating to form a cyclohexide (like a cyclohexyl lithium? Or a cyclohexanide), then methyl chloride would alkylate it. Wait, but NaNH2 and methyl chloride could be for a methylation. But then H2/Pd is hydrogenation, which would reduce triple bonds. So ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group? Wait, wait, ethynyl is CH2-C triple bond CH? No, ethynyl is just C≡CH attached. So hydrogenating the triple bond would make it CH2CH2? No, wait, when you hydrogenate an alkyne with H2 and Pd, it becomes an alkane. So ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CC≡CH) would become cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, maybe it's CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, let me think. The structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. When hydrogenated, the triple bond becomes single, so we'd get cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? But that doesn't seem to fit with the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial step is a deprotonation and alkylation to form a larger ring. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)- group, which is attached to a cyclohexane ring that has a CHO group.

So perhaps the steps are: functionalize the triple bond, introduce a substituent, then perform some kind of oxidation.

The reagents need to add groups in the correct positions.

Let me think about each option.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; then O3/(CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2. Let's see. First step: NaNH2 is a strong base. Maybe deprotonating to form a cyclohexyl lithium. Then methyl chloride would methylate it. But what's the structure after that? Then H2 with Pd and CaCO3 is a hydrogenation catalyst. So the triple bond would hydrogenate to a single bond. Wait, maybe the initial compound is ethynylcyclohexane, which after deprotonation and alkylation becomes something else.

Wait, maybe the first step is a deprotonation to form a cyclohexyl anion, which then gets methylated. So NaNH2 (a base) would deprotonate the alkyne at the alpha position, creating a cyclohexanide. Then methyl chloride would alkylate it, adding a methyl group. So the structure after step 1 would be cyclohexane with a CH2-Me group attached, but perhaps the triple bond is still there?

Wait, maybe I should draw this. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane attached to a C≡CH. Deprotonating with NaNH2 would abstract a proton adjacent to the triple bond, making a cyclohexyl lithium or similar. Then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would methylate, so the alkyne would have a methyl added to the adjacent carbon. Wait, but that's a 1,2-addition. So the triple bond becomes CH2-C-Me. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is deprotonation and alkylation to form a new substituent, and then hydrogenation of the triple bond.

Wait, maybe I'll approach this by considering each possible option and the steps they suggest.

The target molecule has a hydroxyl group on a methyl that's attached to a cyclohexane, which is itself attached to another cyclohexane. So perhaps that methyl comes from an addition reaction.

Wait, maybe I should think about the steps needed:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → Grignard or similar addition → form a new substituent.

But perhaps more accurately, the triple bond needs to be converted into something else. For example, perhaps it's first hydrogenated into a double bond, then something else happens.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is functionalized via a cyano addition, but that doesn't fit the target. Alternatively, maybe it's a diels-alder reaction, but that's probably not in the options.

Wait, looking at the target, the substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. So that's CH2-OH- and CH2-cyclohexane. So perhaps a Grignard addition would form that, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group. Wait, oxidation of an alkyne can form a ketone or a carboxylic acid, depending on conditions.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. So maybe the aldehyde is formed by oxidation of a secondary alcohol. So perhaps the steps involve adding a group, then oxidizing.

Wait, let me think about the possible reagent sequences.

Looking at the options, they all involve multiple steps, so let me think step by step for each.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3/(CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

First step: NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol as an electrophile. Deprotonating to form a cyclohexanide, which would then react with methanol. Wait, but methanol is an alcohol. If the cyclohexanide (from deprotonation of ethynylcyclohexane) reacts with methanol, would that perform an alkylation? Or perhaps the alkyne reacts with methanol in some way.

Wait, maybe the first step is deprotonating the alkyne with NaNH2, then alkylation with CH3Cl to add a methyl group. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes something like CH2-C≡C-... but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step in option D is to deprotonate the alkyne with NaNH2, then perform a methanol alkylation. But I'm not certain about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to deprotonate the alkyne and add a methyl group via methyl chloride, forming an enol ether or something. Hmm.

Another approach: let's think about the target. The aldehyde group suggests that perhaps a ketone was oxidized. Or maybe a secondary alcohol was oxidized.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. So perhaps an oxidation step is involved.

Looking at the reagents, option C includes O3 and (CH3)2S. That's ozonolysis with a reductive workup, perhaps, which would cleave double bonds into carbonyls.

Option B's third step is O3 and H2O, which is more oxidative, leading to ketones or acids.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde, which is a primary carbonyl. So if a double bond is cleaved via ozonolysis, perhaps it produces an aldehyde.

So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diene, then cleaving it with ozone to form two carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, which is then cleaved.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Functionalize the triple bond to add a substituent.
2. Hydrogenate to form a double bond.
3. Ozonolyse to form carbonyl groups.
4. Further reactions to form the hydroxyl group.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a hydroxyl group. So maybe a Grignard reaction is used to form that substituent.

Wait, let's think about each option's steps.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: deprotonate, then methylate. So the alkyne becomes CH2-C-MeCl? Or maybe adds a methyl group to the cyclohexane.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the alkyne. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CC≡CH. If I deprotonate with NaNH2, which is a strong base, it would abstract a proton from the triple bond. So the structure would have a negative charge on the carbon adjacent to the triple bond. Then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would methylate that carbon. So the structure becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me? Wait, I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol or similar. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps NaNH2 and methyl chloride is for a Corey-Fuchs reaction or something else. Or maybe it's for the formation of a propargyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is a alkyne alkylation. So the alkyne is treated with a base, a methylating agent, which adds a methyl group.

After that, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated. So H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a methylene group.

Wait, but if the alkyne is CH2-C≡CH, and we methylate to get CH2-C-Me-C≡CH? No, wait, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation adds a methyl group to the triple bond, making a propargyl methyl group. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes (cyclohexyl)propargyl methyl. Then, upon hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so (cyclohexyl)methylene? Not sure.

Let me consider the target again. The substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, which implies that the cyclohexane is attached to a CH2-OH group, which is attached to another cyclohexane ring which has the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl-type group. So maybe the initial steps involve adding a methyl group adjacent to the triple bond, then hydrogenating to form a CH2 group, which can then undergo further reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, then some dienophile reaction occurs, but that might not be in the reagents listed.

Another angle: the target has a hydroxyl group on the methyl. So perhaps after forming that methyl group, an oxidation or epoxidation occurs, followed by some opening. Or maybe a hydroxylation via oxymercuration or something else.

Wait, the target's substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. So that's a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexane and an OH group.

To form that, perhaps a Grignard reagent is used. But how?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the synthesis goes through a propargyl alcohol stage. Let me think.

If I have ethynylcyclohexane, and I add a hydroxyl group to the triple bond, then I have cyclohexylpropargyl alcohol. Then, perhaps that can undergo oxidation or other reactions.

But I'm not seeing the connection to the target. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, but that would form a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, maybe the target's aldehyde comes from oxidizing a secondary alcohol. So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → add a substituent via alkylation or Grignard.
2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to form a CH2 group.
3. Perform an oxidation to form an aldehyde.

Wait, but how would oxidation form an aldehyde from a secondary alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, then ozonolysis is performed to cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis would require a double bond. So if I hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups, possibly.

Let me try to map this out. For example, if I have ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CC≡CH), and I hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond, making cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, hydrogenating the triple bond to a double bond would produce a cis or trans double bond. So, cyclohexane-CH2-C=CH2.

Wait, no, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. If hydrogenated with H2 and a catalyst, it would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2? Hmm, no, wait. The triple bond (≡) would become a single bond (−) after full hydrogenation. So the structure would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3, right? Because adding two hydrogens to each carbon of the triple bond. So the alkyne becomes an alkane.

But that's not helpful for forming an aldehyde. So perhaps hydrogenation isn't the first step.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is to convert the alkyne into a diol, but that doesn't seem to fit the target.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the alkyne is used in a conjugate addition. For example, using a Grignard reagent to add to the triple bond, forming a substituted cyclohexane with a new substituent.

Wait, but the reagents in the options don't seem to include Grignard reagents, but some do include Li and liquid NH3, which is for Birch reductions or for forming Grignard-like reagents.

Wait, looking at option B: steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH.

So first step: NaNH2 (strong base) and ethyl chloride. Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane and then ethylate. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes ethylated on the triple carbon, adding an ethyl group. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Et.

Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3. This is typically for Birch reductions or for deprotonating to form organometallics. So perhaps the triple bond is reduced to a cis or trans double bond. Wait, Li and NH3 can be used in the presence of ethylene to form cyclopropane, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li and NH3 is for a 1,2-reduction of the triple bond to a cis double bond? Or maybe for a 1,4-addition.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is reduced to a double bond using Li/NH3. So cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Et would become cyclohexane-CH2-C=CEt. Then, step 3 is O3 followed by H2O. Ozonolysis of the double bond would break it into two carbonyl groups.

So ozonolysis of a double bond R1-CH2-CH2-R2 would give R1-CHO and R2-CHO if it's symmetric. But in this case, the double bond would be between the cyclohexyl group and the ethyl group. So ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups: cyclohexane-CHO and Et-CHO (acetaldehyde). But the target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group, which is cyclohexane-CHO, so that could fit. But wait, the target also has a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't leading me correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed via a Grignard reaction where the alkyne is converted into a ketone or aldehyde, which then undergoes alkylation.

Wait, perhaps the correct path is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → add a substituent via alkylation (using NaNH2 and methyl chloride, for example).
2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to form a single bond (CH2 group).
3. Oxidize to form an aldehyde.
4. Introduce the hydroxyl group via some reaction, like epoxidation and then ring-opening.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back, the target structure has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to a cyclohexane that has an aldehyde. So perhaps the CH(OH) group comes from some kind of oxidation or hydroxylation.

Another thought: maybe the synthesis involves forming a benzyl-type group, which is then oxidized to introduce the hydroxyl and aldehyde groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct path is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate with NaNH2, then methylate with CH3Cl to add a methyl group adjacent to the triple bond.

So the structure becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me attached to cyclohexane.

2. Then, hydrogenate the triple bond with H2/Pd to make CH2-CH2-CH2-Me (but that seems like a single bond, so maybe the structure becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-Me attached to cyclohexane? Or wait, maybe the triple bond becomes a single bond, so CH2-CH2-CH2-Me is just a three-carbon chain. Hmm.

3. Then, perform ozonolysis. Wait, but if the triple bond was hydrogenated to a single bond, there's no double bond for ozonolysis. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation, the triple bond is still present, and then it's hydrogenated to a double bond, which is then ozonolyzed.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → maybe deprotonate and then do something with methanol.
2. Li/liq. NH3 → perhaps a Birch reduction or some deprotonation.
3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis with a reductive workup.
4. NH4OH → ammonium hydroxide, maybe for acid workup.

But I'm not sure how these steps would build the target.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → add methyl group.
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate triple bond to single.
3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, which would break a double bond, but if the triple was hydrogenated to single, maybe that's not applicable. Unless another double bond is formed elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, there's a double bond in the structure. Let me think.

Wait, after step 1, perhaps the structure has a methyl group added to the triple bond. Then step 2, hydrogenation, would make a single bond. So, for example, if after step 1, we have CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me, then hydrogenation would make CH2-CH2-CH2-Me. But that's a single bond, so no double bond for ozonolysis. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are different.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH) to another cyclohexane with an aldehyde. So maybe the steps involve forming a diol, then oxidizing to form the aldehyde.

Wait, but how would that happen from ethynylcyclohexane?

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a diol via hydroxylation, then some kind of elimination happens.

Wait, perhaps the correct reagents involve:

1. Deprotonation and alkylation to add a substituent.
2. Hydrogenation of the triple bond to a double bond.
3. Ozonolysis to cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.
4. Hydroboration or another reaction to introduce the hydroxyl group.

But I'm getting a bit stuck, so maybe I should think about each option's possible outcome.

Looking at option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this is a deprotonation and then an alkylation with methanol. But I'm not sure.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. It can deprotonate the alkyne to form a propargide anion. Then, reacting with methanol might lead to an alkylation, perhaps adding a methyl group. But I'm not sure of the specifics.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a typical condition for Birch reductions or for deprotonating to form organolithium reagents. Maybe this reduces the triple bond to a double bond or something else.

Step 3: Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis tends to cleave double bonds into carbonyls. So if step 2 forms a double bond, step 3 would break it.

Step 4: NH4OH, which is a acidic workup. So the ozonolysis products would be aldehydes or ketones, depending on the structure.

But how does this lead to the target?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a diol, then...

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a key reaction.

Wait, another thought: the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So perhaps a Grignard addition to a carbonyl group.

But where would the carbonyl come from?

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → add a methyl group via deprotonation and alkylation (NaNH2, CH3Cl).
2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond (H2/Pd), forming a longer chain.
3. Ozonolysis to cleave a double bond into carbonyls (but I thought after step 2, the triple becomes single, so maybe no double bond exists. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.)

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, the alkyne is alkylated, then step 2 is hydrogenation to form a double bond, not a single bond. Because if I use H2 and a Lindlar catalyst, I could hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond. But in option C, it's H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is for full hydrogenation to single bond.

Wait, that would mean no double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't work. So perhaps option C is not the right choice.

Alternatively, perhaps another option's steps are better.

Looking at option B: after NaNH2 and ethyl chloride, alkylation, then Li and liq. NH3 (maybe for deprotonation to form a cyclohexyl lithium), then ozonolysis and H2O, then ammonium hydroxide.

Wait, after alkylation, the structure would be ethynylcyclohexane with an ethyl group added. Then, Li and NH3 could reduce the triple bond to a cis double bond, perhaps. Then ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyls. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So maybe the aldehyde comes from one end, and the hydroxymethyl from another.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into a ketone, then undergoes some alkylation or addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride to add a methyl group, making a propargyl methyl group.
2. Then, H2/Pd is used to hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a propane chain.
3. Ozonolysis cleaves the propane into two carbonyls. But wait, if it's a single bond, ozonolysis won't work. So that's a problem.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride to add a methyl group, making CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me.
2. Then, hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis or trans double bond using H2 and a poisoned catalyst (like Lindlar's), making CH2-C=CH-CH2-Me.
3. Then, ozonolysis would break this into two aldehyde groups: CH2-CHO and Me-CHO.

But wait, the target has only one aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Alternatively, maybe after adding the methyl group, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, and then another functional group is introduced.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C, but I'm not seeing how.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → add methyl group.
2. H2/Pd-calc → hydrogenate triple to single bond.
3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, but if the triple is now a single bond, perhaps that doesn't work. Unless there's a new double bond formed elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the structure has a new double bond, maybe via some elimination.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is an oxidation that doesn't require a double bond.

Wait, another thought: (CH3)2S is a reductive workup in ozonolysis. So when you ozonolyse a double bond, you get aldehydes or ketones, depending on the substituents, and (CH3)2S is used to prevent over-oxidation.

But if the structure after step 2 has a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it.

Wait, let me think: after step 1, ethynylcyclohexane becomes a propargyl methyl group. Step 2, hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a longer chain. But then, how would a double bond form for ozonolysis?

Hmm. Maybe I'm stuck here, so perhaps I should consider each option and see which sequence logically leads to the target.

The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl, and an aldehyde group.

Another thought: perhaps the aldehyde is formed by the oxidation of a secondary alcohol.

So, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → add a substituent (like via alkylation) to form a new group.
2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to form a CH2 group.
3. Perform an oxidation to form a secondary alcohol, which then is oxidized to an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the target's structure has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH) group. So that's a CHOH group attached to another cyclohexane which has the aldehyde.

So perhaps the CHOH comes from a Grignard reaction adding to a ketone, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a ketone, then a Grignard reagent adds to form the CHOH group.

But I'm not seeing how the reagents in the options would do that.

Wait, perhaps the correct reagents are:

1. Deprotonate and alkylate to add a methyl group.
2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a CH2 group.
3. Introduce a double bond elsewhere.
4. Ozonolyse to form carbonyl groups and then introduce the hydroxyl.

But I'm not seeing a clear path.

Perhaps I should look for another approach, such as considering the number of steps and the transformations each reagent can perform.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: maybe deprotonate and then undergo some reaction with methanol. Maybe methanol acts as an electrophile, adding a methyl group. So the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-OCH3? Not sure.

2. Li and liq. NH3: could be a Birch reduction or a deprotonation. If the alkyne is treated with Li/NH3, perhaps it reduces the triple bond to a cis double bond.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S: cleaves the double bond to form carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH: workup, perhaps forming aldehydes.

But I'm not sure how this forms the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option C again.

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride. So deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form a propargide anion, then methylate to add a methyl group. So structure becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2-Me. So now we have a CH2CH2CH2Me group attached to cyclohexane.

Wait, but that's just a straight chain. Then step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. But there's no double bond to ozonolyse, so maybe this step isn't applicable. So perhaps option C isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond, which would require a different catalyst, like Lindlar's, but in option C, it's H2/Pd-calc, which is for full hydrogenation.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what each reagent does in the options.

Looking at option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol may act as a methylating agent. So, deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane, then methylate to add a methyl group. So the structure becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2-OCH3? Or perhaps a different addition.

Wait, but methanol is CH3OH. If the alkyne is deprotonated, then methyl chloride would be a better methylating agent. But in option D, it's methanol. So perhaps the methyl group is added as an O-methyl ether? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first step forms a propargyl alcohol after workup, but I'm not certain.

Step 2: Li in liq. NH3. This could deprotonate or reduce the alkyne. If the alkyne is reduced, perhaps it becomes a trans double bond.

Then, step 3: ozonolysis. So the double bond is cleaved into two carbonyl groups.

But the target only has one aldehyde group, so maybe one of the carbonyls is further processed.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the correct option is D.

But I'm not making much progress. I think I need to make an educated guess, considering that the target has an aldehyde group, which would be formed from oxidizing a secondary alcohol. So perhaps a step involving oxidation with something like KMnO4 or other oxidizing agents.

Looking at the options, steps 3 in options A and B involve H2SO4 and HgSO4, which is a Jones oxidation, typically for oxidizing alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids. So perhaps that's involved in forming the aldehyde.

Wait, let's look at option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: add methyl group.
2. H2/Pd: hydrogenate triple to single.
3. Ba(OH)2: perhaps some elimination or epoxidation? Not sure.
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: Jones oxidation.

So after step 2, perhaps we have a CH2 group. Then Ba(OH)2 could induce some kind of elimination, perhaps forming a double bond. Then, Jones oxidation would oxidize an alcohol to a ketone or aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing how this forms the target.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is for forming an epoxide, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is as follows:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate and add a methyl group (step 1).
2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond (step 2).
3. Introduce an OH group via some reaction, perhaps via Ba(OH)2 (step 3).
4. Oxidize to form an aldehyde (step 4).

But I'm not sure.

Overall, I'm a bit stuck, but considering the target has an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group, and the reagents in option D include ozonolysis which can form carbonyls, perhaps that's the way to go. But I'm not entirely convinced.

Wait, another thought: if the alkyne is converted into a ketone via oxidation, then a Grignard reagent can add to form the necessary substituents.

But the reagents in the options don't include Grignard reagents directly, but Li and NH3 could be part of that.

Wait, perhaps option D's steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane deprotonated and methylated to form a propargyl methyl ether.
2. Li and NH3 reduces the triple bond to a cis double bond.
3. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into aldehydes.
4. NH4OH workup forms the final product.

But I'm not seeing how that would form the hydroxymethyl group.

Hmm. I think I'll have to make a best guess. Based on the target structure, I think the correct sequence involves adding a methyl group via alkylation, hydrogenating the triple bond to a single bond, then oxidizing to form an aldehyde. But I'm not entirely sure which option matches that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, option C's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: add methyl group.
2. H2/Pd-calc: hydrogenate triple to single.
3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S: cleaves any double bonds, but if triple was hydrogenated to single, perhaps another double bond is formed elsewhere. Not sure.
4. Ba(OH)2: maybe for elimination or epoxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for some kind of elimination reaction to form a double bond, which is then ozonolyzed in a subsequent step. But I'm not following.

I'm getting stuck, so I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option D.

Wait, no, option D's step 3 is ozonolysis, which requires a double bond. So perhaps after step 2, the structure has a double bond, which was formed via reduction of the triple bond.

Wait, maybe in option D, step 2 is a partial hydrogenation of the triple bond to a double bond. But I thought Li and NH3 typically leads to full reduction, but maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Hmm. I'm not entirely confident, but I'll go with option C.

The question involves identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule contains a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a hydroxymethyl group and an aldehyde group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride likely deprotonate and alkylate the alkyne.
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd reduces the triple bond to a single bond.
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)₂ may induce elimination or epoxidation.
   - Step 4: H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O (Jones oxidation) could oxidize an alcohol to a carbonyl.
   - However, the sequence does not clearly explain the formation of the hydroxymethyl group or the aldehyde.

2. **Option B**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride alkylate the alkyne.
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ could reduce the triple bond to a double bond.
   - Step 3: O₃/H₂O cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH workup forms aldehydes.
   - While ozonolysis can form carbonyl groups, the sequence does not account for the hydroxymethyl group.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride deprotonate and alkylate the alkyne, forming a propargyl methyl group.
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate fully hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond.
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S cleaves any double bonds (if formed) into carbonyl groups.
   - Step 4: Ba(OH)₂ may facilitate elimination or oxidation.
   - This sequence partially aligns with the target structure but does not clearly explain the formation of the hydroxymethyl group.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methanol deprotonate and methylate the alkyne.
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ reduces the triple bond to a double bond.
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH workup forms aldehydes.
   - This sequence could form carbonyl groups but does not clearly explain the introduction of the hydroxymethyl group.

### Conclusion:
The target molecule requires the formation of a hydroxymethyl group and an aldehyde. While none of the options perfectly align with the synthesis pathway, **Option C** appears to be the most plausible based on the steps involving alkylation, hydrogenation, and ozonolysis, which could contribute to the formation of the necessary functional groups.

ANSWER: C

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit stuck, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane. Hmm, let's break this down.

The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Wow, that's a mouthful. Let me try to visualize its structure. So, the main chain is a cyclohexane ring with a substituent attached. The substituent is a methyl group connected to another cyclohexane ring, and that methyl also has a hydroxyl group. Plus, the cyclohexane ring has a carbonyl group (since it's a carbaldehyde). So the structure would be something like a cyclohexane ring with a CH2 group attached, which is connected to another cyclohexyl group and an OH. And there's an aldehyde group on the same ring.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (a carbon-carbon triple bond) attached. So, it's like cyclohexane-CC≡CH.

I need to figure out the reagents that transform ethynylcyclohexane into the target compound. Let's think about the possible reactions and the reagents involved.

Let me outline the possible steps. The target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a methyl group that also has an OH. So, probably some kind of alkylation or addition reaction. Also, the aldehyde suggests oxidation somewhere.

Looking at the options, the reagents vary, so I need to plan the synthesis pathway.

First, perhaps the triple bond in ethynylcyclohexane can be functionalized. Maybe a Grignard reaction? Or some kind of alkyne chemistry.

Option A: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; then Ba(OH)2; then H2SO4 and HgSO4 with H2O. Let's see what each step does.

NaNH2 is a strong base, used for deprotonation. Methyl chloride is an alkylating agent. So first step might be deprotonating to form a cyclohexide (like a cyclohexyl lithium? Or a cyclohexanide), then methyl chloride would alkylate it. Wait, but NaNH2 and methyl chloride could be for a methylation. But then H2/Pd is hydrogenation, which would reduce triple bonds. So ethynylcyclohexane would become cyclohexane with a CH2CH2 group? Wait, wait, ethynyl is CH2-C triple bond CH? No, ethynyl is just C≡CH attached. So hydrogenating the triple bond would make it CH2CH2? No, wait, when you hydrogenate an alkyne with H2 and Pd, it becomes an alkane. So ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CC≡CH) would become cyclohexane-CH2CH2CH2? No, wait, maybe it's CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, let me think. The structure is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. When hydrogenated, the triple bond becomes single, so we'd get cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3? But that doesn't seem to fit with the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial step is a deprotonation and alkylation to form a larger ring. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH)- group, which is attached to a cyclohexane ring that has a CHO group.

So perhaps the steps are: functionalize the triple bond, introduce a substituent, then perform some kind of oxidation.

The reagents need to add groups in the correct positions.

Let me think about each option.

Option C: Steps are NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; then O3/(CH3)2S; then Ba(OH)2. Let's see. First step: NaNH2 is a strong base. Maybe deprotonating to form a cyclohexyl lithium. Then methyl chloride would methylate it. But what's the structure after that? Then H2 with Pd and CaCO3 is a hydrogenation catalyst. So the triple bond would hydrogenate to a single bond. Wait, maybe the initial compound is ethynylcyclohexane, which after deprotonation and alkylation becomes something else.

Wait, maybe the first step is a deprotonation to form a cyclohexyl anion, which then gets methylated. So NaNH2 (a base) would deprotonate the alkyne at the alpha position, creating a cyclohexanide. Then methyl chloride would alkylate it, adding a methyl group. So the structure after step 1 would be cyclohexane with a CH2-Me group attached, but perhaps the triple bond is still there?

Wait, maybe I should draw this. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane attached to a C≡CH. Deprotonating with NaNH2 would abstract a proton adjacent to the triple bond, making a cyclohexyl lithium or similar. Then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would methylate, so the alkyne would have a methyl added to the adjacent carbon. Wait, but that's a 1,2-addition. So the triple bond becomes CH2-C-Me. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is deprotonation and alkylation to form a new substituent, and then hydrogenation of the triple bond.

Wait, maybe I'll approach this by considering each possible option and the steps they suggest.

The target molecule has a hydroxyl group on a methyl that's attached to a cyclohexane, which is itself attached to another cyclohexane. So perhaps that methyl comes from an addition reaction.

Wait, maybe I should think about the steps needed:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → Grignard or similar addition → form a new substituent.

But perhaps more accurately, the triple bond needs to be converted into something else. For example, perhaps it's first hydrogenated into a double bond, then something else happens.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is functionalized via a cyano addition, but that doesn't fit the target. Alternatively, maybe it's a diels-alder reaction, but that's probably not in the options.

Wait, looking at the target, the substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. So that's CH2-OH- and CH2-cyclohexane. So perhaps a Grignard addition would form that, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group. Wait, oxidation of an alkyne can form a ketone or a carboxylic acid, depending on conditions.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. So maybe the aldehyde is formed by oxidation of a secondary alcohol. So perhaps the steps involve adding a group, then oxidizing.

Wait, let me think about the possible reagent sequences.

Looking at the options, they all involve multiple steps, so let me think step by step for each.

Option D: Steps are NaNH2, methanol; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3/(CH3)2S; then NH4OH.

First step: NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol as an electrophile. Deprotonating to form a cyclohexanide, which would then react with methanol. Wait, but methanol is an alcohol. If the cyclohexanide (from deprotonation of ethynylcyclohexane) reacts with methanol, would that perform an alkylation? Or perhaps the alkyne reacts with methanol in some way.

Wait, maybe the first step is deprotonating the alkyne with NaNH2, then alkylation with CH3Cl to add a methyl group. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes something like CH2-C≡C-... but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step in option D is to deprotonate the alkyne with NaNH2, then perform a methanol alkylation. But I'm not certain about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step is to deprotonate the alkyne and add a methyl group via methyl chloride, forming an enol ether or something. Hmm.

Another approach: let's think about the target. The aldehyde group suggests that perhaps a ketone was oxidized. Or maybe a secondary alcohol was oxidized.

Wait, the target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group. So perhaps an oxidation step is involved.

Looking at the reagents, option C includes O3 and (CH3)2S. That's ozonolysis with a reductive workup, perhaps, which would cleave double bonds into carbonyls.

Option B's third step is O3 and H2O, which is more oxidative, leading to ketones or acids.

Wait, but the target has an aldehyde, which is a primary carbonyl. So if a double bond is cleaved via ozonolysis, perhaps it produces an aldehyde.

So perhaps the synthesis involves forming a diene, then cleaving it with ozone to form two carbonyl groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, which is then cleaved.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Functionalize the triple bond to add a substituent.
2. Hydrogenate to form a double bond.
3. Ozonolyse to form carbonyl groups.
4. Further reactions to form the hydroxyl group.

Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a hydroxyl group. So maybe a Grignard reaction is used to form that substituent.

Wait, let's think about each option's steps.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: deprotonate, then methylate. So the alkyne becomes CH2-C-MeCl? Or maybe adds a methyl group to the cyclohexane.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the alkyne. Ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CC≡CH. If I deprotonate with NaNH2, which is a strong base, it would abstract a proton from the triple bond. So the structure would have a negative charge on the carbon adjacent to the triple bond. Then methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would methylate that carbon. So the structure becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me? Wait, I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a propargyl alcohol or similar. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps NaNH2 and methyl chloride is for a Corey-Fuchs reaction or something else. Or maybe it's for the formation of a propargyl group.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is a alkyne alkylation. So the alkyne is treated with a base, a methylating agent, which adds a methyl group.

After that, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated. So H2 and Pd would hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a methylene group.

Wait, but if the alkyne is CH2-C≡CH, and we methylate to get CH2-C-Me-C≡CH? No, wait, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation adds a methyl group to the triple bond, making a propargyl methyl group. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes (cyclohexyl)propargyl methyl. Then, upon hydrogenation, the triple bond becomes a single bond, so (cyclohexyl)methylene? Not sure.

Let me consider the target again. The substituent is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl, which implies that the cyclohexane is attached to a CH2-OH group, which is attached to another cyclohexane ring which has the aldehyde.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a benzyl-type group. So maybe the initial steps involve adding a methyl group adjacent to the triple bond, then hydrogenating to form a CH2 group, which can then undergo further reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, then some dienophile reaction occurs, but that might not be in the reagents listed.

Another angle: the target has a hydroxyl group on the methyl. So perhaps after forming that methyl group, an oxidation or epoxidation occurs, followed by some opening. Or maybe a hydroxylation via oxymercuration or something else.

Wait, the target's substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group. So that's a CH2 group attached to a cyclohexane and an OH group.

To form that, perhaps a Grignard reagent is used. But how?

Wait, another approach: perhaps the synthesis goes through a propargyl alcohol stage. Let me think.

If I have ethynylcyclohexane, and I add a hydroxyl group to the triple bond, then I have cyclohexylpropargyl alcohol. Then, perhaps that can undergo oxidation or other reactions.

But I'm not seeing the connection to the target. Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a carbonyl group, but that would form a ketone or aldehyde.

Wait, maybe the target's aldehyde comes from oxidizing a secondary alcohol. So, perhaps the steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → add a substituent via alkylation or Grignard.
2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to form a CH2 group.
3. Perform an oxidation to form an aldehyde.

Wait, but how would oxidation form an aldehyde from a secondary alcohol.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, then ozonolysis is performed to cleave it into two carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis would require a double bond. So if I hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it into two carbonyl groups, possibly.

Let me try to map this out. For example, if I have ethynylcyclohexane (cyclohexane-CC≡CH), and I hydrogenate the triple bond to a double bond, making cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, hydrogenating the triple bond to a double bond would produce a cis or trans double bond. So, cyclohexane-CH2-C=CH2.

Wait, no, ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-CH2-C≡CH. If hydrogenated with H2 and a catalyst, it would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH2? Hmm, no, wait. The triple bond (≡) would become a single bond (−) after full hydrogenation. So the structure would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-CH3, right? Because adding two hydrogens to each carbon of the triple bond. So the alkyne becomes an alkane.

But that's not helpful for forming an aldehyde. So perhaps hydrogenation isn't the first step.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is to convert the alkyne into a diol, but that doesn't seem to fit the target.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the alkyne is used in a conjugate addition. For example, using a Grignard reagent to add to the triple bond, forming a substituted cyclohexane with a new substituent.

Wait, but the reagents in the options don't seem to include Grignard reagents, but some do include Li and liquid NH3, which is for Birch reductions or for forming Grignard-like reagents.

Wait, looking at option B: steps are NaNH2, ethyl chloride; then Li/liq. NH3; then O3/H2O; then NH4OH.

So first step: NaNH2 (strong base) and ethyl chloride. Deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane and then ethylate. So ethynylcyclohexane becomes ethylated on the triple carbon, adding an ethyl group. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Et.

Then step 2: Li in liquid NH3. This is typically for Birch reductions or for deprotonating to form organometallics. So perhaps the triple bond is reduced to a cis or trans double bond. Wait, Li and NH3 can be used in the presence of ethylene to form cyclopropane, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the Li and NH3 is for a 1,2-reduction of the triple bond to a cis double bond? Or maybe for a 1,4-addition.

Wait, perhaps the triple bond is reduced to a double bond using Li/NH3. So cyclohexane-CH2-C≡C-Et would become cyclohexane-CH2-C=CEt. Then, step 3 is O3 followed by H2O. Ozonolysis of the double bond would break it into two carbonyl groups.

So ozonolysis of a double bond R1-CH2-CH2-R2 would give R1-CHO and R2-CHO if it's symmetric. But in this case, the double bond would be between the cyclohexyl group and the ethyl group. So ozonolysis would break it into two carbonyl groups: cyclohexane-CHO and Et-CHO (acetaldehyde). But the target has a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde group, which is cyclohexane-CHO, so that could fit. But wait, the target also has a hydroxymethyl group attached to another cyclohexane.

Hmm, perhaps this isn't leading me correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the target is formed via a Grignard reaction where the alkyne is converted into a ketone or aldehyde, which then undergoes alkylation.

Wait, perhaps the correct path is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → add a substituent via alkylation (using NaNH2 and methyl chloride, for example).
2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to form a single bond (CH2 group).
3. Oxidize to form an aldehyde.
4. Introduce the hydroxyl group via some reaction, like epoxidation and then ring-opening.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back, the target structure has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to a cyclohexane that has an aldehyde. So perhaps the CH(OH) group comes from some kind of oxidation or hydroxylation.

Another thought: maybe the synthesis involves forming a benzyl-type group, which is then oxidized to introduce the hydroxyl and aldehyde groups.

Wait, perhaps the correct path is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate with NaNH2, then methylate with CH3Cl to add a methyl group adjacent to the triple bond.

So the structure becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me attached to cyclohexane.

2. Then, hydrogenate the triple bond with H2/Pd to make CH2-CH2-CH2-Me (but that seems like a single bond, so maybe the structure becomes CH2-CH2-CH2-Me attached to cyclohexane? Or wait, maybe the triple bond becomes a single bond, so CH2-CH2-CH2-Me is just a three-carbon chain. Hmm.

3. Then, perform ozonolysis. Wait, but if the triple bond was hydrogenated to a single bond, there's no double bond for ozonolysis. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps after alkylation, the triple bond is still present, and then it's hydrogenated to a double bond, which is then ozonolyzed.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me consider each option's steps and see which makes sense.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol → maybe deprotonate and then do something with methanol.
2. Li/liq. NH3 → perhaps a Birch reduction or some deprotonation.
3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis with a reductive workup.
4. NH4OH → ammonium hydroxide, maybe for acid workup.

But I'm not sure how these steps would build the target.

Option C:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → add methyl group.
2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate triple bond to single.
3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, which would break a double bond, but if the triple was hydrogenated to single, maybe that's not applicable. Unless another double bond is formed elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, there's a double bond in the structure. Let me think.

Wait, after step 1, perhaps the structure has a methyl group added to the triple bond. Then step 2, hydrogenation, would make a single bond. So, for example, if after step 1, we have CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me, then hydrogenation would make CH2-CH2-CH2-Me. But that's a single bond, so no double bond for ozonolysis. Hmm, that's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are different.

Wait, another approach: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH) to another cyclohexane with an aldehyde. So maybe the steps involve forming a diol, then oxidizing to form the aldehyde.

Wait, but how would that happen from ethynylcyclohexane?

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is converted into a diol via hydroxylation, then some kind of elimination happens.

Wait, perhaps the correct reagents involve:

1. Deprotonation and alkylation to add a substituent.
2. Hydrogenation of the triple bond to a double bond.
3. Ozonolysis to cleave the double bond into carbonyl groups.
4. Hydroboration or another reaction to introduce the hydroxyl group.

But I'm getting a bit stuck, so maybe I should think about each option's possible outcome.

Looking at option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. Maybe this is a deprotonation and then an alkylation with methanol. But I'm not sure.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. It can deprotonate the alkyne to form a propargide anion. Then, reacting with methanol might lead to an alkylation, perhaps adding a methyl group. But I'm not sure of the specifics.

Step 2: Li in liquid NH3. That's a typical condition for Birch reductions or for deprotonating to form organolithium reagents. Maybe this reduces the triple bond to a double bond or something else.

Step 3: Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis tends to cleave double bonds into carbonyls. So if step 2 forms a double bond, step 3 would break it.

Step 4: NH4OH, which is a acidic workup. So the ozonolysis products would be aldehydes or ketones, depending on the structure.

But how does this lead to the target?

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a diol, then...

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a key reaction.

Wait, another thought: the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane. So perhaps a Grignard addition to a carbonyl group.

But where would the carbonyl come from?

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → add a methyl group via deprotonation and alkylation (NaNH2, CH3Cl).
2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond (H2/Pd), forming a longer chain.
3. Ozonolysis to cleave a double bond into carbonyls (but I thought after step 2, the triple becomes single, so maybe no double bond exists. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.)

Alternatively, perhaps after step 1, the alkyne is alkylated, then step 2 is hydrogenation to form a double bond, not a single bond. Because if I use H2 and a Lindlar catalyst, I could hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond. But in option C, it's H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is for full hydrogenation to single bond.

Wait, that would mean no double bond, so ozonolysis wouldn't work. So perhaps option C is not the right choice.

Alternatively, perhaps another option's steps are better.

Looking at option B: after NaNH2 and ethyl chloride, alkylation, then Li and liq. NH3 (maybe for deprotonation to form a cyclohexyl lithium), then ozonolysis and H2O, then ammonium hydroxide.

Wait, after alkylation, the structure would be ethynylcyclohexane with an ethyl group added. Then, Li and NH3 could reduce the triple bond to a cis double bond, perhaps. Then ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyls. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the target is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So maybe the aldehyde comes from one end, and the hydroxymethyl from another.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the starting alkyne is converted into a ketone, then undergoes some alkylation or addition.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride to add a methyl group, making a propargyl methyl group.
2. Then, H2/Pd is used to hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a propane chain.
3. Ozonolysis cleaves the propane into two carbonyls. But wait, if it's a single bond, ozonolysis won't work. So that's a problem.

Hmm. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane is treated with NaNH2 and methyl chloride to add a methyl group, making CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me.
2. Then, hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis or trans double bond using H2 and a poisoned catalyst (like Lindlar's), making CH2-C=CH-CH2-Me.
3. Then, ozonolysis would break this into two aldehyde groups: CH2-CHO and Me-CHO.

But wait, the target has only one aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps this isn't the case.

Alternatively, maybe after adding the methyl group, the triple bond is hydrogenated to a single bond, and then another functional group is introduced.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is C, but I'm not seeing how.

Option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → add methyl group.
2. H2/Pd-calc → hydrogenate triple to single bond.
3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis, but if the triple is now a single bond, perhaps that doesn't work. Unless there's a new double bond formed elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps after step 2, the structure has a new double bond, maybe via some elimination.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps step 3 is an oxidation that doesn't require a double bond.

Wait, another thought: (CH3)2S is a reductive workup in ozonolysis. So when you ozonolyse a double bond, you get aldehydes or ketones, depending on the substituents, and (CH3)2S is used to prevent over-oxidation.

But if the structure after step 2 has a double bond, then ozonolysis would cleave it.

Wait, let me think: after step 1, ethynylcyclohexane becomes a propargyl methyl group. Step 2, hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making a longer chain. But then, how would a double bond form for ozonolysis?

Hmm. Maybe I'm stuck here, so perhaps I should consider each option and see which sequence logically leads to the target.

The target has a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a cyclohexyl group, a hydroxymethyl, and an aldehyde group.

Another thought: perhaps the aldehyde is formed by the oxidation of a secondary alcohol.

So, perhaps the sequence is:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → add a substituent (like via alkylation) to form a new group.
2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to form a CH2 group.
3. Perform an oxidation to form a secondary alcohol, which then is oxidized to an aldehyde.

But I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the target's structure has a cyclohexyl group attached via a CH(OH) group. So that's a CHOH group attached to another cyclohexane which has the aldehyde.

So perhaps the CHOH comes from a Grignard reaction adding to a ketone, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is first converted into a ketone, then a Grignard reagent adds to form the CHOH group.

But I'm not seeing how the reagents in the options would do that.

Wait, perhaps the correct reagents are:

1. Deprotonate and alkylate to add a methyl group.
2. Hydrogenate the alkyne to a CH2 group.
3. Introduce a double bond elsewhere.
4. Ozonolyse to form carbonyl groups and then introduce the hydroxyl.

But I'm not seeing a clear path.

Perhaps I should look for another approach, such as considering the number of steps and the transformations each reagent can perform.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: maybe deprotonate and then undergo some reaction with methanol. Maybe methanol acts as an electrophile, adding a methyl group. So the alkyne becomes CH2-C≡C-OCH3? Not sure.

2. Li and liq. NH3: could be a Birch reduction or a deprotonation. If the alkyne is treated with Li/NH3, perhaps it reduces the triple bond to a cis double bond.

3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S: cleaves the double bond to form carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH: workup, perhaps forming aldehydes.

But I'm not sure how this forms the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Wait, let me think about the steps in option C again.

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride. So deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane to form a propargide anion, then methylate to add a methyl group. So structure becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2-Me.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate: hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond, making CH2-CH2-CH2-Me. So now we have a CH2CH2CH2Me group attached to cyclohexane.

Wait, but that's just a straight chain. Then step 3: O3/(CH3)2S. But there's no double bond to ozonolyse, so maybe this step isn't applicable. So perhaps option C isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the triple bond is hydrogenated to a double bond, which would require a different catalyst, like Lindlar's, but in option C, it's H2/Pd-calc, which is for full hydrogenation.

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about what each reagent does in the options.

Looking at option D:

Step 1: NaNH2 and methanol. NaNH2 is a strong base. Methanol may act as a methylating agent. So, deprotonate ethynylcyclohexane, then methylate to add a methyl group. So the structure becomes CH2-C≡C-CH2-OCH3? Or perhaps a different addition.

Wait, but methanol is CH3OH. If the alkyne is deprotonated, then methyl chloride would be a better methylating agent. But in option D, it's methanol. So perhaps the methyl group is added as an O-methyl ether? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the first step forms a propargyl alcohol after workup, but I'm not certain.

Step 2: Li in liq. NH3. This could deprotonate or reduce the alkyne. If the alkyne is reduced, perhaps it becomes a trans double bond.

Then, step 3: ozonolysis. So the double bond is cleaved into two carbonyl groups.

But the target only has one aldehyde group, so maybe one of the carbonyls is further processed.

Hmm.

Another possibility: perhaps the correct option is D.

But I'm not making much progress. I think I need to make an educated guess, considering that the target has an aldehyde group, which would be formed from oxidizing a secondary alcohol. So perhaps a step involving oxidation with something like KMnO4 or other oxidizing agents.

Looking at the options, steps 3 in options A and B involve H2SO4 and HgSO4, which is a Jones oxidation, typically for oxidizing alcohols to ketones or carboxylic acids. So perhaps that's involved in forming the aldehyde.

Wait, let's look at option A:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: add methyl group.
2. H2/Pd: hydrogenate triple to single.
3. Ba(OH)2: perhaps some elimination or epoxidation? Not sure.
4. H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: Jones oxidation.

So after step 2, perhaps we have a CH2 group. Then Ba(OH)2 could induce some kind of elimination, perhaps forming a double bond. Then, Jones oxidation would oxidize an alcohol to a ketone or aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing how this forms the target.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is for forming an epoxide, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is as follows:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → deprotonate and add a methyl group (step 1).
2. Hydrogenate the triple bond to a single bond (step 2).
3. Introduce an OH group via some reaction, perhaps via Ba(OH)2 (step 3).
4. Oxidize to form an aldehyde (step 4).

But I'm not sure.

Overall, I'm a bit stuck, but considering the target has an aldehyde and a hydroxymethyl group, and the reagents in option D include ozonolysis which can form carbonyls, perhaps that's the way to go. But I'm not entirely convinced.

Wait, another thought: if the alkyne is converted into a ketone via oxidation, then a Grignard reagent can add to form the necessary substituents.

But the reagents in the options don't include Grignard reagents directly, but Li and NH3 could be part of that.

Wait, perhaps option D's steps are:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane deprotonated and methylated to form a propargyl methyl ether.
2. Li and NH3 reduces the triple bond to a cis double bond.
3. Ozonolysis cleaves the double bond into aldehydes.
4. NH4OH workup forms the final product.

But I'm not seeing how that would form the hydroxymethyl group.

Hmm. I think I'll have to make a best guess. Based on the target structure, I think the correct sequence involves adding a methyl group via alkylation, hydrogenating the triple bond to a single bond, then oxidizing to form an aldehyde. But I'm not entirely sure which option matches that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is C.

Wait, option C's steps are:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride: add methyl group.
2. H2/Pd-calc: hydrogenate triple to single.
3. Ozonolysis with (CH3)2S: cleaves any double bonds, but if triple was hydrogenated to single, perhaps another double bond is formed elsewhere. Not sure.
4. Ba(OH)2: maybe for elimination or epoxidation.

Alternatively, perhaps Ba(OH)2 is used for some kind of elimination reaction to form a double bond, which is then ozonolyzed in a subsequent step. But I'm not following.

I'm getting stuck, so I think I'll have to conclude that the correct answer is option D.

Wait, no, option D's step 3 is ozonolysis, which requires a double bond. So perhaps after step 2, the structure has a double bond, which was formed via reduction of the triple bond.

Wait, maybe in option D, step 2 is a partial hydrogenation of the triple bond to a double bond. But I thought Li and NH3 typically leads to full reduction, but maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C.

Hmm. I'm not entirely confident, but I'll go with option C.


The question involves identifying the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule contains a cyclohexane ring with a substituent that includes a hydroxymethyl group and an aldehyde group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride likely deprotonate and alkylate the alkyne.
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd reduces the triple bond to a single bond.
   - Step 3: Ba(OH)₂ may induce elimination or epoxidation.
   - Step 4: H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O (Jones oxidation) could oxidize an alcohol to a carbonyl.
   - However, the sequence does not clearly explain the formation of the hydroxymethyl group or the aldehyde.

2. **Option B**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and ethyl chloride alkylate the alkyne.
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ could reduce the triple bond to a double bond.
   - Step 3: O₃/H₂O cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH workup forms aldehydes.
   - While ozonolysis can form carbonyl groups, the sequence does not account for the hydroxymethyl group.

3. **Option C**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methyl chloride deprotonate and alkylate the alkyne, forming a propargyl methyl group.
   - Step 2: H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate fully hydrogenates the triple bond to a single bond.
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S cleaves any double bonds (if formed) into carbonyl groups.
   - Step 4: Ba(OH)₂ may facilitate elimination or oxidation.
   - This sequence partially aligns with the target structure but does not clearly explain the formation of the hydroxymethyl group.

4. **Option D**:
   - Step 1: NaNH₂ and methanol deprotonate and methylate the alkyne.
   - Step 2: Li/liq. NH₃ reduces the triple bond to a double bond.
   - Step 3: O₃/(CH₃)₂S cleaves the double bond into carbonyl groups.
   - Step 4: NH₄OH workup forms aldehydes.
   - This sequence could form carbonyl groups but does not clearly explain the introduction of the hydroxymethyl group.

### Conclusion:
The target molecule requires the formation of a hydroxymethyl group and an aldehyde. While none of the options perfectly align with the synthesis pathway, **Option C** appears to be the most plausible based on the steps involving alkylation, hydrogenation, and ozonolysis, which could contribute to the formation of the necessary functional groups.
