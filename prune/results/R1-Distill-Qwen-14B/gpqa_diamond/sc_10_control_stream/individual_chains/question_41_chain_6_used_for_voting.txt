Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question is about a light beam propagating through a glass slab. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam, and it's moving toward the observer in the laboratory. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer. The options are A to D, and I have to choose the right one.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with velocities, especially in relativity, we sometimes need to use the velocity addition formulas. But wait, the problem says the glass is moving at a constant velocity, so maybe it's in the realm of classical mechanics, not special relativity. Because if v is not close to the speed of light, classical approaches would suffice.

Wait, but light's speed in a medium depends on the medium's index of refraction. The speed of light in the glass is c/n, where n is the index of refraction. But wait, the glass is moving, so I guess we have to consider how the movement of the medium affects the observed speed of light.

So in the rest frame of the glass, the light is moving at c/n. Now, since the glass is moving towards the observer with velocity v, we might need to transform the velocities using the Galilean transformations. Because if the glass is moving, the light's speed as observed in the lab frame could be different.

Galilean transformations state that if an object moves at velocity u in the frame S, and frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then the velocity u' of the object in S' is u' = u - v.

Wait, but wait, that's when the frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. Let me think: in this problem, the lab frame is where the observer is, and the glass is moving at velocity v. So from the lab frame's perspective, the glass is moving with velocity v. So the light in the glass would have its speed as observed in the lab frame being the speed in the glass's frame minus v? Or plus v?

Wait, no. Because the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion. So in the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed v_light = c/n. The glass is moving towards the observer at v, so the light's speed in the lab frame would be v_light + v_glass's velocity relative to the medium.

Wait, no. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this more methodically.

First, the speed of light in the glass (in the glass's rest frame) is c/n.

Now, the glass itself is moving at velocity v in the lab frame. So, according to Galilean addition, the speed of the light in the lab frame would be the speed of the light in the glass's frame plus the speed of the glass. But wait, the direction matters. Since the glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, and towards the observer, I think the light's speed in the lab frame is (c/n) + v.

Wait, but that can't be right because the speed of light shouldn't depend on the motion of the source in classical physics. Oh wait, no, that's only when the source is emitting light. For light propagating through a moving medium, the speed would change according to the medium's motion. Wait, no, that's not quite right either.

Wait, in classical electromagnetism, the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties. When the medium is moving, the velocity of light in the lab frame would be the vector sum of the medium's velocity and the speed of light in the medium. But I'm not entirely certain about this. Alternatively, maybe the index of refraction n is a property that already accounts for the motion of the medium, but I don't think so.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. Let me think: in the lab frame, the glass is moving with velocity v. The light is moving through the glass, so the speed of light in the glass is c/n. But relative to the lab, the speed would be the sum of the glass's velocity and the light's velocity in the glass.

Wait, but the direction is the same. So if the glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass's motion, then the lab frame would measure the light's speed as (c/n) + v.

But wait, that can't be correct because, according to special relativity, the speed of light should always be c in any inertial frame. But this problem is presented in a classical context, perhaps, because it's talking about a glass moving at velocity v, not something close to c. So maybe we're supposed to use Galilean velocity addition here.

Wait, but in that case, the speed would be (c/n) + v, but none of the answer options seem to match that. Let me look at the options again.

Options are A: (1 + n v)/(n +v), B: 1, C: (1 +n v)/(n -v), D: (1 - n v)/(n +v).

Wait, but none of these options directly match (c/n + v), since c is given as 1. So (c/n + v) would be (1 + n v)/n. But none of the options are that either.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe it's a problem about the relativistic addition of velocities, but that's when the object's speed is significant compared to c.

Wait, but the problem states that the glass is moving at velocity v, but there's no mention of v being a significant fraction of c, so perhaps it's a classical problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the relative velocity of the light as seen by the observer, taking into account the movement of the glass. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed u = c/n. The glass is moving at speed v in the lab frame. So the observer in the lab would see the light moving at u' = u + v, which would be (c/n) + v. But again, with c=1, this would be (1/n) + v.

But looking at the options, none of them directly match that. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, another thought: When the medium is moving, the index of refraction might change, but that's probably beyond the scope here. The problem states that n is the index of refraction of the glass, so we can take that as fixed.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed of light as measured in the lab is c/n, but adjusted due to the motion of the medium. Wait, I'm getting more confused.

Wait a moment. Let's think about the frame of the glass. In the glass's frame, the light is moving at speed 1/n. The glass is moving at speed v in the lab frame. So according to Galilean addition, the speed observed in the lab would be u = (1/n) + v. But wait, that's if the glass is moving in the same direction as the light.

Wait, but the problem says the glass is moving in the same direction as the beam. So the beam's velocity in the glass frame is 1/n, and the glass is moving at v.

So in the lab, the beam's velocity would be the sum: 1/n + v. But none of the options look like that. Let me compute what that would be with c=1.

Wait, 1/n + v is equal to (1 + n v)/n. But looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n +v), which is different. So that doesn't match.

Wait, maybe I should think about it in terms of the medium's velocity and how it affects the light's speed. Another approach: The speed of light in the medium is determined by the medium's properties, and the motion of the medium affects the observed speed. But in the lab frame, the medium is moving, so the light's speed in the lab frame would be the vector sum of the medium's velocity and the light's velocity in the medium.

But that would give us u = v + (1/n), but again, that doesn't match any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the velocity of the light as observed, but using a relativistic approach. Wait, but if v is not near c, the relativistic approach might not be necessary. But let's think.

In special relativity, the velocity addition formula is:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

But u here is the velocity of the light in the medium's frame, which is 1/n. So substituting, we get:

u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1 )

Which simplifies to:

u' = [ (1 + n v) / n ] / ( (n + v) / n )

The denominators cancel out, so u' = (1 + n v)/(n + v). Which matches option A.

So according to the relativistic velocity addition formula, the speed is (1 +n v)/(n +v), which is option A.

But wait, the question says that the glass is moving at a constant velocity, so maybe it's in an inertial frame, making the relativistic approach applicable. But the problem didn't specify any relativistic considerations, so I'm a bit confused. But the fact that none of the classical approaches matched any of the options made me think that maybe the relativistic approach is intended here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question. Because in reality, the speed of light in the lab frame should always be c, regardless of the motion of the source or the medium. But that's according to special relativity. So if the problem is using special relativity, then the speed of light in the lab would be c, which is option B.

Wait, that's a possibility. Because according to Einstein's postulate, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. So the glass moving or not, the light speed remains c. So the correct answer would be B) 1.

But wait, the problem says, "the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory." Hmm, maybe that's a misinterpretation. Because in the glass's frame, light's speed is 1/n, but in the lab frame, it's always c. Because the problem says the light is propagating in the glass; but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem is phrased as "the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory." So maybe the question is considering the speed of light in the medium as measured in the lab frame.

But according to relativity, the speed is always c, so in the lab frame, the light's speed is c, so option B.

But that seems too straightforward, and the presence of the other options suggests that the problem expects a more involved calculation.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the relativistic Doppler effect or something else. Or perhaps the question is about the speed of the light within the moving medium, which would involve the medium's velocity.

Wait, let me think again.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed 1/n. The glass is moving at speed v in the lab frame. So the speed of light in the lab frame would be c, according to relativity, but if the medium is moving, the speed of light in the medium would be 1/n, but how does the medium's motion affect that?

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering relativity, so the speed is simply 1/n plus v, but that gives (1 +n v)/n, which isn't any of the options except if there's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the relative velocity of the light as observed, considering the movement of the glass. So the light's speed relative to the lab is the speed in the medium plus the medium's speed, but that would be 1/n + v. But again, that doesn't match any options except if we rearrange.

Wait, let me compute (1 +n v)/(n +v). If I plug in some numbers, say n=1 and v=0, then (1+0)/(1+0)=1, which is correct. If the glass isn't moving, the speed is 1, which is correct.

Another test: if v approaches 0, then the expression (1 +n v)/(n +v) approximates to (1 +0)/(n +0) = 1/n, which is the speed in the glass's frame. So that matches the scenario where the glass isn't moving.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the speed should be close to 1 if the glass is moving towards the observer at a high speed. Wait, that doesn't make sense, because according to relativity, the speed of light is always c, regardless of the source's motion. So if the glass is moving, but the light's speed is c, then option B is correct.

So I'm now getting conflicting conclusions. On one hand, using relativistic velocity addition gives option A, but according to the postulate of relativity, the speed should be c, option B.

But wait, the problem says, "the speed of light in glass relative to the observer." Oh, perhaps the question is asking for the speed as measured inside the glass, considering the glass's motion. But that's a bit unclear.

Wait, no. The question is asking, "What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory?" So it's the speed of the light beam as observed in the laboratory. So according to relativity, that's always c. So the answer should be B) 1.

But then why is there an option A that gives a different expression? Maybe the problem is intended to be solved using Galilean addition, which would give (1/n) + v, but none of the options directly match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the relativistic calculation. Let me re-calculate the relativistic addition formula.

In the medium's rest frame (glass), the light's speed is u = 1/n.

The medium is moving at speed v relative to the lab frame, in the same direction as the light.

So the lab frame's speed u' is given by:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

Since c=1, this becomes:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + u v )

Substituting u = 1/n,

u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate the denominator:

u' = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Which is exactly option A. So according to the relativistic approach, the answer is A.

But according to relativity, the speed of light should be c regardless of the frame. So why is that? Because in this case, u' would be (1 +n v)/(n +v), which won't be 1 unless the numerator and denominator are equal, which happens when (1 +n v) = (n +v), which would require 1 -n v = n -v, which only holds for specific values of n and v.

So there's a contradiction here. If the speed of light is always c, then the answer must be B. But according to the velocity addition formula, it's A. So which is correct?

Ah, wait a second. The confusion arises because the velocity addition formula gives the speed of an object in another frame, but the speed of light is always c regardless.

So when you apply the velocity addition formula to light, you get c, not the expression in option A. Let me check that.

Let me substitute u = c. Then, u' = (c + v)/(1 + c v) )

But wait, that's only correct if we're adding velocities in the same direction. Wait, but in any case, for light, substituting u = c, the equation becomes:

u' = (c + v) / (1 + (c * v)/c² )

Which simplifies to (c + v)/(1 + v/c )

Multiply numerator and denominator by c:

(c + v) c / (c + v) ) = c.

So yes, the velocity addition formula correctly gives u' = c, which is option B.

Wait, so the problem is that when you compute the velocity addition formula, if u is c, then u' is c. So in our case, the light in the medium's frame has u = 1/n, but that's incorrect because in any frame, the speed of light is c. So I must have made a mistake in thinking that in the medium's frame, light's speed is 1/n.

Wait, so maybe the correct approach is that in the medium's rest frame, the speed of light is c, not 1/n. But that's not correct. Because the speed of light in a medium is c/n, as per the refractive index.

Wait, but according to relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is c. So if the medium is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame is still c.

So the initial assumption that in the medium's frame, the light's speed is 1/n must be incorrect. Because according to relativity, the speed is always c.

So perhaps the problem is assuming a classical scenario where the speed of light in the medium is 1/n, and the medium's motion affects the observed speed.

In that case, using Galilean addition, the lab frame's speed is (1/n) + v.

But since none of the options match that, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the velocity of the light as seen by the observer, who is in the lab frame. The light is moving through a medium that's itself moving. So the observer would see the light's speed as c, but that's not one of the options except for B.

But why is option B correct? Because according to relativity, the observer would always measure the light's speed as c, regardless of the medium's motion. So the answer is B.

But earlier, when I used the relativistic velocity addition formula with u = (1/n), I got option A, but that must have been incorrect because u can't be (1/n) in any frame—it has to be c.

Wait, so perhaps the correct approach is that the speed of light in any frame is c, so the answer is B, option B.

But why is the problem giving other options then? It's possible that the problem is considering the speed of the light within the moving medium, not the speed as observed in the lab. Or perhaps it's a trick question.

Wait, the question says, "the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory." So it's the speed at which the light is moving through the glass as measured by the lab observer.

But according to relativity, the speed of light in the lab frame is always c, regardless of the glass's motion. So the answer is B.

So after all this thinking, I think the correct answer is B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Speed of Light in the Glass**: In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is given by \( \frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the index of refraction of the glass.

2. **Motion of the Glass**: The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. This introduces a relative motion between the glass and the laboratory frame.

3. **Relativistic Considerations**: According to Einstein's postulate of special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum (and in any inertial frame) is always \( c \), regardless of the motion of the source or the medium. However, the problem specifies the "speed of light in glass," which depends on the refractive index \( n \). This suggests the problem is not directly invoking relativistic principles but instead focusing on the speed of light within the medium.

4. **Classical Velocity Addition**: Using classical velocity addition, the speed of light in the laboratory frame would be the sum of the speed of light in the glass (\( \frac{1}{n} \)) and the velocity of the glass (\( v \)), i.e., \( \frac{1}{n} + v \). However, this result does not match any of the given options.

5. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**: Applying the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   \[
   u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{uv}{c^2}}
   \]
   where \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) (speed of light in the glass) and \( c = 1 \), we get:
   \[
   u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   u' = \frac{1 + nv}{n + v}
   \]
   This matches **Option A**.

6. **Interpretation of the Question**: The problem asks for the "speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory." This implies the speed of light within the moving medium, not the absolute speed of light in a vacuum. While special relativity ensures the speed of light in a vacuum is always \( c \), the speed of light within a medium depends on the medium's properties and its motion.

7. **Conclusion**: Based on the relativistic velocity addition formula and the interpretation of the problem, the correct answer is:
   \[
   \frac{1 + nv}{n + v}
   \]
   which corresponds to **Option A**.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The question is about a light beam propagating through a glass slab.

Because if the glass is moving, the light's speed as observed in the lab frame could be different.

Galilean transformations state that if an object moves at velocity u in the frame S, and frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then the velocity u' of the object in S' is u' = u - v.

Wait, but wait, that's when the frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to S. Let me think: in this problem, the lab frame is where the observer is, and the glass is moving at velocity v.

But looking at the options, none of them directly match that. So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Wait, another thought: When the medium is moving, the index of refraction might change, but that's probably beyond the scope here. The problem states that n is the index of refraction of the glass, so we can take that as fixed.

But in the lab frame, the medium is moving, so the light's speed in the lab frame would be the vector sum of the medium's velocity and the light's velocity in the medium.

But that would give us u = v + (1/n), but again, that doesn't match any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the velocity of the light as observed, but using a relativistic approach. Wait, but if v is not near c, the relativistic approach might not be necessary. But let's think.

In special relativity, the velocity addition formula is:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

But u here is the velocity of the light in the medium's frame, which is 1/n. So substituting, we get:

u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (1/n) * v ) / 1 )

Which simplifies to:

u' = [ (1 + n v) / n ] / ( (n + v) / n )

The denominators cancel out, so u' = (1 + n v)/(n + v). Which matches option A.

So according to the relativistic velocity addition formula, the speed is (1 +n v)/(n +v), which is option A.

But wait, the question says that the glass is moving at a constant velocity, so maybe it's in an inertial frame, making the relativistic approach applicable. But the problem didn't specify any relativistic considerations, so I'm a bit confused. But the fact that none of the classical approaches matched any of the options made me think that maybe the relativistic approach is intended here.

Wait, that's a possibility. Because according to Einstein's postulate, the speed of light is always c in any inertial frame. So the glass moving or not, the light speed remains c. So the correct answer would be B) 1.

But wait, the problem says, "the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory." Hmm, maybe that's a misinterpretation. Because in the glass's frame, light's speed is 1/n, but in the lab frame, it's always c. Because the problem says the light is propagating in the glass; but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the problem is using the relativistic Doppler effect or something else. Or perhaps the question is about the speed of the light within the moving medium, which would involve the medium's velocity.

Wait, let me think again.

In the glass's rest frame, the light is moving at speed 1/n. The glass is moving at speed v in the lab frame. So the speed of light in the lab frame would be c, according to relativity, but if the medium is moving, the speed of light in the medium would be 1/n, but how does the medium's motion affect that?

Wait, perhaps the problem is not considering relativity, so the speed is simply 1/n plus v, but that gives (1 +n v)/n, which isn't any of the options except if there's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the relative velocity of the light as observed, considering the movement of the glass. So the light's speed relative to the lab is the speed in the medium plus the medium's speed, but that would be 1/n + v. But again, that doesn't match any options except if we rearrange.

Wait, let me compute (1 +n v)/(n +v). If I plug in some numbers, say n=1 and v=0, then (1+0)/(1+0)=1, which is correct. If the glass isn't moving, the speed is 1, which is correct.

Another test: if v approaches 0, then the expression (1 +n v)/(n +v) approximates to (1 +0)/(n +0) = 1/n, which is the speed in the glass's frame. So that matches the scenario where the glass isn't moving.

Wait, but in the lab frame, the speed should be close to 1 if the glass is moving towards the observer at a high speed. Wait, that doesn't make sense, because according to relativity, the speed of light is always c, regardless of the source's motion. So if the glass is moving, but the light's speed is c, then option B is correct.

So I'm now getting conflicting conclusions. On one hand, using relativistic velocity addition gives option A, but according to the postulate of relativity, the speed should be c, option B.

But wait, the problem says, "the speed of light in glass relative to the observer." Oh, perhaps the question is asking for the speed as measured inside the glass, considering the glass's motion. But that's a bit unclear.

Wait, no. The question is asking, "What is the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory?" So it's the speed of the light beam as observed in the laboratory. So according to relativity, that's always c. So the answer should be B) 1.

But then why is there an option A that gives a different expression? Maybe the problem is intended to be solved using Galilean addition, which would give (1/n) + v, but none of the options directly match that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the relativistic calculation. Let me re-calculate the relativistic addition formula.

In the medium's rest frame (glass), the light's speed is u = 1/n.

The medium is moving at speed v relative to the lab frame, in the same direction as the light.

So the lab frame's speed u' is given by:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

Since c=1, this becomes:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + u v )

Substituting u = 1/n,

u' = ( (1/n) + v ) / (1 + (1/n) v )

Multiply numerator and denominator by n to eliminate the denominator:

u' = (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Which is exactly option A. So according to the relativistic approach, the answer is A.

But according to relativity, the speed of light should be c regardless of the frame. So why is that? Because in this case, u' would be (1 +n v)/(n +v), which won't be 1 unless the numerator and denominator are equal, which happens when (1 +n v) = (n +v), which would require 1 -n v = n -v, which only holds for specific values of n and v.

So there's a contradiction here. If the speed of light is always c, then the answer must be B. But according to the velocity addition formula, it's A. So which is correct?

Ah, wait a second. The confusion arises because the velocity addition formula gives the speed of an object in another frame, but the speed of light is always c regardless.

So when you apply the velocity addition formula to light, you get c, not the expression in option A. Let me check that.

Let me substitute u = c. Then, u' = (c + v)/(1 + c v) )

But wait, that's only correct if we're adding velocities in the same direction. Wait, but in any case, for light, substituting u = c, the equation becomes:

u' = (c + v) / (1 + (c * v)/c² )

Which simplifies to (c + v)/(1 + v/c )

Multiply numerator and denominator by c:

(c + v) c / (c + v) ) = c.

So yes, the velocity addition formula correctly gives u' = c, which is option B.

Wait, so the problem is that when you compute the velocity addition formula, if u is c, then u' is c. So in our case, the light in the medium's frame has u = 1/n, but that's incorrect because in any frame, the speed of light is c. So I must have made a mistake in thinking that in the medium's frame, light's speed is 1/n.

Wait, so maybe the correct approach is that in the medium's rest frame, the speed of light is c, not 1/n. But that's not correct. Because the speed of light in a medium is c/n, as per the refractive index.

Wait, but according to relativity, the speed of light in any inertial frame is c. So if the medium is moving, the light's speed in the lab frame is still c.

So the initial assumption that in the medium's frame, the light's speed is 1/n must be incorrect. Because according to relativity, the speed is always c.

So perhaps the problem is assuming a classical scenario where the speed of light in the medium is 1/n, and the medium's motion affects the observed speed.

In that case, using Galilean addition, the lab frame's speed is (1/n) + v.

But since none of the options match that, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the velocity of the light as seen by the observer, who is in the lab frame. The light is moving through a medium that's itself moving. So the observer would see the light's speed as c, but that's not one of the options except for B.

But why is option B correct? Because according to relativity, the observer would always measure the light's speed as c, regardless of the medium's motion. So the answer is B.

But earlier, when I used the relativistic velocity addition formula with u = (1/n), I got option A, but that must have been incorrect because u can't be (1/n) in any frame—it has to be c.

Wait, so perhaps the correct approach is that the speed of light in any frame is c, so the answer is B, option B.

But why is the problem giving other options then? It's possible that the problem is considering the speed of the light within the moving medium, not the speed as observed in the lab. Or perhaps it's a trick question.

Wait, the question says, "the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in laboratory." So it's the speed at which the light is moving through the glass as measured by the lab observer.

But according to relativity, the speed of light in the lab frame is always c, regardless of the glass's motion. So the answer is B.

So after all this thinking, I think the correct answer is B.


To determine the speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation as follows:

1. **Speed of Light in the Glass**: In the rest frame of the glass, the speed of light is given by \( \frac{1}{n} \), where \( n \) is the index of refraction of the glass.

2. **Motion of the Glass**: The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam and toward the observer in the laboratory. This introduces a relative motion between the glass and the laboratory frame.

3. **Relativistic Considerations**: According to Einstein's postulate of special relativity, the speed of light in a vacuum (and in any inertial frame) is always \( c \), regardless of the motion of the source or the medium. However, the problem specifies the "speed of light in glass," which depends on the refractive index \( n \). This suggests the problem is not directly invoking relativistic principles but instead focusing on the speed of light within the medium.

4. **Classical Velocity Addition**: Using classical velocity addition, the speed of light in the laboratory frame would be the sum of the speed of light in the glass (\( \frac{1}{n} \)) and the velocity of the glass (\( v \)), i.e., \( \frac{1}{n} + v \). However, this result does not match any of the given options.

5. **Relativistic Velocity Addition**: Applying the relativistic velocity addition formula:
   \[
   u' = \frac{u + v}{1 + \frac{uv}{c^2}}
   \]
   where \( u = \frac{1}{n} \) (speed of light in the glass) and \( c = 1 \), we get:
   \[
   u' = \frac{\frac{1}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{v}{n}}
   \]
   Simplifying:
   \[
   u' = \frac{1 + nv}{n + v}
   \]
   This matches **Option A**.

6. **Interpretation of the Question**: The problem asks for the "speed of light in glass relative to the observer in the laboratory." This implies the speed of light within the moving medium, not the absolute speed of light in a vacuum. While special relativity ensures the speed of light in a vacuum is always \( c \), the speed of light within a medium depends on the medium's properties and its motion.

7. **Conclusion**: Based on the relativistic velocity addition formula and the interpretation of the problem, the correct answer is:
   \[
   \frac{1 + nv}{n + v}
   \]
   which corresponds to **Option A**.
