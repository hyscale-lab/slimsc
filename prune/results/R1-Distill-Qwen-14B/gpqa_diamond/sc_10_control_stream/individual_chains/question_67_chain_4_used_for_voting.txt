Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, so the question is about two electrons in p orbitals. Wait, p orbitals have a principal quantum number l equal to 1, right? Because s is 0, p is 1, d is 2, and so on. So each electron has l1 and l2 both equal to 1.

The coupled angular momentum state is given as |1,1,2,-1>. Wait, what do these numbers mean? Oh right, I think the notation is |l1, l2, l, m>. So l1 is 1 for the first electron, l2 is 1 for the second. The total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1. So the combined state is a state of total angular momentum L=2 with m=-1.

The question is about the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ℏ each. So I need to find the joint probability that L1z is -ℏ and L2z is -ℏ.

Wait, but each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction, Lz, is given by m multiplied by ℏ. Oh wait, no. Wait, for each particle, L1z can be m1 ℏ, and L2z can be m2 ℏ. But since we're talking about the total m, which is m = m1 + m2. So for the state |1,1,2,-1>, m is -1. So m = m1 + m2 = -1.

If we're measuring L1z and L2z, each of them has eigenvalues m1 ℏ and m2 ℏ. So for the state |l1,l2,l,m>, which is |1,1,2,-1>, the possible m1 and m2 values must sum to m = -1.

But the question asks, what's the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1. Because L1z = m1 ℏ, so m1 = -1 implies L1z = -ℏ. Similarly for m2.

Wait, but m1 and m2 are the individual m quantum numbers. So the product m1 * m2 would give (m1 ℏ)(m2 ℏ) but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

So the state is a coupled state, which is a combination of the product states of m1 and m2. Let me think about how to express |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the product states |m1, m2>.

The total state for coupled angular momentum is given by |l1, l2, l, m> = sum over m1, m2 [ Clebsch-Gordan coefficients ] |m1, m2>, where m1 + m2 = m.

So for l=2 and m=-1, the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a sum of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1.

But I'm not sure about the exact Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for this case. I remember that for adding two angular momenta, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients can be found in tables or via recursion relations. Alternatively, I can think about possible m1 and m2 combinations.

So possible m1 and m2 pairs that sum to m=-1 would be:

m1 = -1, m2=0 → sum -1.

m1=0, m2=-1 → sum -1.

m1=-2, m2=1 → sum -1.

Wait, wait. Each electron has l=1, so m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, or +1. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to m=-1 are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1), (-2, 1), (1, -2). Wait, but wait, l=1, so m can't be -2 or +2. So the possible pairs are only (-1,0) and (0,-1). Because m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, wait, no. If l1=1, m1 can be -1, 0, +1. Similarly, m2 can be -1, 0, +1. So the sum m1 + m2 = -1.

So possible pairs are:

m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum -1.

m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum -1.

Also, m1 = -2? No, because m1 can't be -2 when l1 is 1. So no, the only possible pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

Wait, but wait. Let's compute m1 + m2 for all possible pairs:

m1 can be -1, 0, +1.

m2 can be -1, 0, +1.

So possible sums:

-1 + (-1) = -2.

-1 + 0 = -1.

-1 + +1 = 0.

0 + (-1) = -1.

0 + 0 = 0.

0 + +1 = +1.

+1 + (-1) = 0.

+1 + 0 = +1.

+1 + +1 = 2.

So the pairs that sum to -1 are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

So the state |1,1,2,-1> must be a combination of these two product states.

So the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1> is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

But what's the exact coefficient? I think the CG coefficient for |l=2, m=-1> is (sqrt( ( (2 - (-1) + 1) ) / something ))... Wait, maybe I should look up the standard Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1.

Alternatively, I remember that for two spin-1 particles (which is analogous here), the possible total spins are 2 and 0. So for l=2, the states are built from combinations.

Wait, the coefficients for the state |2, m=-1> are:

It's a symmetric combination of |1,-1, 1,0> and |1,0,1,-1>?

Wait, no, perhaps. Let me think about the general approach.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two angular momenta j1 and j2. For j1=1 and j2=1, the CG coefficients can be determined using the recursion relations.

Alternatively, I can recall that when adding two p orbitals (l=1 each), the possible total l's are 2 and 0.

For l_total=2:

The m values go from -2 to +2.

The states |m=2> is |1,1> → CG coefficient is 1.

For |m=1>, it's (sqrt(2)/2) |1,0> + (sqrt(2)/2) |0,1>.

Wait, maybe not. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of ladder operators.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the possible states for m=-1.

So, the state |l=2, m=-1> is a combination of the product states |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

As we found, the only possible product states are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

So how are these combined?

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l=2, m=-1 is a normalization factor multiplied by some combination.

Wait, I think for two j=1 particles, the CG coefficients can be found as follows.

For l=2, m=2: |1,1>.

For l=2, m=1: (|1,0> + |0,1>)/sqrt(2).

For l=2, m=0: (|1,-1> + |0,0> + |-1,1>)/sqrt(3).

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to look up the standard CG coefficients for j1=1, j2=1, l=2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can construct them using the formula for CG coefficients.

The CG coefficient for |j1, m1; j2, m2; J, M> is zero unless m1 + m2 = M.

So for J=2, M=-1, we need to consider all (m1, m2) such that m1 + m2 = -1. As established, only (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1).

Let me call them |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The CG coefficient for |J=2, M=-1> is given by:

⟨ m1, m2 | J, M ⟩ = [ ( (2 + 1) choose (m1, m2) )^(1/2) ) ] * something.

Wait, actually, perhaps it's better to look for a formula. The CG coefficient for j1=1, j2=1, J=2, M=-1 is given by:

sqrt( ( (2 + 1) * ( (m1, m2) ) )) / something.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to write down all the coefficients for l=2, m=-1.

Wait, I remember that for two spin-1 particles, the state |2, -1> is symmetric in some way.

Wait, perhaps the state is ( |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ) multiplied by a normalization factor.

Because when you add two p orbitals, the state with m=-1 would be symmetric in the two electrons.

Wait, but wait, angular momentum states are symmetric under exchange if the particles are bosons, but electrons are fermions. Oh wait, but here we're talking about orbital angular momentum, which doesn't affect the exchange symmetry because electrons are spin-1/2 particles. So in this case, we're dealing with orbital angular momentum, not spin. So the state should be symmetric under exchange if the overall wavefunction is antisymmetric, but I'm not sure. Maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just find the coefficients.

I recall that for two spin-1 particles, the state |2, -1> is ( |1,-1, 1,0> + |1,0, 1,-1> ) multiplied by 1/sqrt(2), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the CG coefficient using the formula.

The CG coefficient can be expressed as:

⟨ j1 m1 j2 m2 | J M ⟩ = [ ( (2J +1) (J - m1)(J + m1) ) / ( (j1 + j2 - J)(j1 + j2 + J) ) ) ]^(1/2) × some factors?

Alternatively, I think the CG coefficients for j1 = j2 = 1, J = l=2, and M=-1.

The general formula for CG coefficients is:

⟨ j1 m1 j2 m2 | J M ⟩ = (-1)^{J - j1 + m2} * [ ( (2J +1) ( (J - j1 + m2)! (J + j1 - m2 -1)! ) ) / ( (J + j1 + m2 +1)! (J - j1 - m2 +1)! ) ) ]^(1/2) * something.

Hmm, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the explicit values.

I found a table online (in my mind, of course) that for j1=1, j2=1, and J=2, the CG coefficients are:

For M=2: 1.

For M=1: (1/sqrt(2)) ( |1,0> + |0,1> )

For M=0: (1/sqrt(3)) ( |1,-1> + |0,0> + |-1,1> )

For M=-1: (1/sqrt(2)) ( | -1, 0> + |0, -1> )

For M=-2: 1.

Wait, that makes sense. So the state |2, -1> is (| -1, 0> + |0, -1> ) / sqrt(2).

So the state is a sum of those two product states, each with coefficient 1/sqrt(2).

So the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as 1/sqrt(2) [ |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ].

Now, the question is: what is the probability of measuring both m1 and m2 as -1. So, each electron's L_z would be -ℏ.

But wait, in the state |1,1,2,-1>, the product states are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>. So in this state, the possible outcomes are either m1=-1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1.

So in neither case do both m1 and m2 equal -1. So the coefficients for |m1=-1, m2=-1> is zero in this state. Because the state is a combination of |(-1,0)> and (0,-1), not involving (-1,-1).

So the probability of both L1z and L2z being -ℏ is zero.

Wait, but let's think again. The state is |1,1,2,-1> which is ( | -1, 0> + |0, -1> ) / sqrt(2). So if I were to measure m1 and m2, the possible outcomes are:

Case 1: m1=-1, m2=0. So L1z = -ℏ, L2z = 0 * ℏ = 0.

Case 2: m1=0, m2=-1. So L1z=0 * ℏ=0, L2z=-ℏ.

So in both possible measurement outcomes, one of them is -ℏ, the other is 0. There's no component where both are -1. So the probability of both being -1 is zero.

So the correct answer should be D) 0.

The problem involves two electrons in p orbitals, where each electron has orbital angular momentum quantum number \( l = 1 \). The coupled angular momentum state of the system is given as \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \), where \( l_1 = 1 \), \( l_2 = 1 \), \( l = 2 \) (total angular momentum), and \( m = -1 \) (the z-component of total angular momentum). The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \), which corresponds to \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Coupled Angular Momentum State**: The state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) is a combination of product states \( |m_1, m_2\rangle \), where \( m_1 + m_2 = -1 \). The possible pairs \( (m_1, m_2) \) that satisfy this condition are:
   - \( (-1, 0) \)
   - \( (0, -1) \)

   Thus, the state can be expressed as:
   \[
   |1,1,2,-1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = 0\rangle + |m_1 = 0, m_2 = -1\rangle \right).
   \]

2. **Measurement of \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \)**: The eigenvalues of \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) are \( m_1 \hbar \) and \( m_2 \hbar \), respectively. For both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) to be \( -\hbar \), we require \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \).

3. **Probability of Joint Measurement**: The state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) does not include the product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \). Therefore, the coefficient of \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) in the coupled state is zero. This means the probability of measuring \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \) is zero.

### Conclusion:
The joint probability of measuring \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) is zero because the coupled state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) does not include the \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) component.

So l1 is 1 for the first electron, l2 is 1 for the second. The total angular momentum quantum numbers are l=2 and m=-1. So the combined state is a state of total angular momentum L=2 with m=-1.

The question is about the probability of measuring both L1z and L2z to be -ℏ each. So I need to find the joint probability that L1z is -ℏ and L2z is -ℏ.

Wait, but each electron's orbital angular momentum in the z-direction, Lz, is given by m multiplied by ℏ. Oh wait, no. Wait, for each particle, L1z can be m1 ℏ, and L2z can be m2 ℏ. But since we're talking about the total m, which is m = m1 + m2. So for the state |1,1,2,-1>, m is -1. So m = m1 + m2 = -1.

If we're measuring L1z and L2z, each of them has eigenvalues m1 ℏ and m2 ℏ. So for the state |l1,l2,l,m>, which is |1,1,2,-1>, the possible m1 and m2 values must sum to m = -1.

But the question asks, what's the probability that both m1 and m2 are -1. Because L1z = m1 ℏ, so m1 = -1 implies L1z = -ℏ. Similarly for m2.

Wait, but m1 and m2 are the individual m quantum numbers. So the product m1 * m2 would give (m1 ℏ)(m2 ℏ) but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

So the state is a coupled state, which is a combination of the product states of m1 and m2. Let me think about how to express |1,1,2,-1> in terms of the product states |m1, m2>.

The total state for coupled angular momentum is given by |l1, l2, l, m> = sum over m1, m2 [ Clebsch-Gordan coefficients ] |m1, m2>, where m1 + m2 = m.

So for l=2 and m=-1, the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as a sum of |m1, m2> states where m1 + m2 = -1.

But I'm not sure about the exact Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for this case. I remember that for adding two angular momenta, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients can be found in tables or via recursion relations. Alternatively, I can think about possible m1 and m2 combinations.

So possible m1 and m2 pairs that sum to m=-1 would be:

m1 = -1, m2=0 → sum -1.

m1=0, m2=-1 → sum -1.

m1=-2, m2=1 → sum -1.

Wait, wait. Each electron has l=1, so m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, or +1. So the possible (m1, m2) pairs that sum to m=-1 are:

(-1, 0), (0, -1), (-2, 1), (1, -2). Wait, but wait, l=1, so m can't be -2 or +2. So the possible pairs are only (-1,0) and (0,-1). Because m1 and m2 can be -1, 0, +1.

Wait, wait, no. If l1=1, m1 can be -1, 0, +1. Similarly, m2 can be -1, 0, +1. So the sum m1 + m2 = -1.

So possible pairs are:

m1 = -1, m2 = 0 → sum -1.

m1 = 0, m2 = -1 → sum -1.

Also, m1 = -2? No, because m1 can't be -2 when l1 is 1. So no, the only possible pairs are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

Wait, but wait. Let's compute m1 + m2 for all possible pairs:

m1 can be -1, 0, +1.

m2 can be -1, 0, +1.

So possible sums:

-1 + (-1) = -2.

-1 + 0 = -1.

-1 + +1 = 0.

0 + (-1) = -1.

0 + 0 = 0.

0 + +1 = +1.

+1 + (-1) = 0.

+1 + 0 = +1.

+1 + +1 = 2.

So the pairs that sum to -1 are (-1,0) and (0,-1).

So the state |1,1,2,-1> must be a combination of these two product states.

So the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for |l1=1, l2=1, l=2, m=-1> is a combination of |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

But what's the exact coefficient? I think the CG coefficient for |l=2, m=-1> is (sqrt( ( (2 - (-1) + 1) ) / something ))... Wait, maybe I should look up the standard Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for l1=1, l2=1.

Alternatively, I remember that for two spin-1 particles (which is analogous here), the possible total spins are 2 and 0. So for l=2, the states are built from combinations.

Wait, the coefficients for the state |2, m=-1> are:

It's a symmetric combination of |1,-1, 1,0> and |1,0,1,-1>?

Wait, no, perhaps. Let me think about the general approach.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for adding two angular momenta j1 and j2. For j1=1 and j2=1, the CG coefficients can be determined using the recursion relations.

Alternatively, I can recall that when adding two p orbitals (l=1 each), the possible total l's are 2 and 0.

For l_total=2:

The m values go from -2 to +2.

The states |m=2> is |1,1> → CG coefficient is 1.

For |m=1>, it's (sqrt(2)/2) |1,0> + (sqrt(2)/2) |0,1>.

Wait, maybe not. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of ladder operators.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the possible states for m=-1.

So, the state |l=2, m=-1> is a combination of the product states |m1, m2> where m1 + m2 = -1.

As we found, the only possible product states are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

So how are these combined?

For l=2, m=1: (|1,0> + |0,1>)/sqrt(2).

For l=2, m=0: (|1,-1> + |0,0> + |-1,1>)/sqrt(3).

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to look up the standard CG coefficients for j1=1, j2=1, l=2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can construct them using the formula for CG coefficients.

The CG coefficient for |j1, m1; j2, m2; J, M> is zero unless m1 + m2 = M.

So for J=2, M=-1, we need to consider all (m1, m2) such that m1 + m2 = -1. As established, only (m1=-1, m2=0) and (m1=0, m2=-1).

Let me call them |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>.

The CG coefficient for |J=2, M=-1> is given by:

⟨ m1, m2 | J, M ⟩ = [ ( (2 + 1) choose (m1, m2) )^(1/2) ) ] * something.

Wait, actually, perhaps it's better to look for a formula. The CG coefficient for j1=1, j2=1, J=2, M=-1 is given by:

sqrt( ( (2 + 1) * ( (m1, m2) ) )) / something.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to write down all the coefficients for l=2, m=-1.

Wait, I remember that for two spin-1 particles, the state |2, -1> is symmetric in some way.

Wait, perhaps the state is ( |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ) multiplied by a normalization factor.

Because when you add two p orbitals, the state with m=-1 would be symmetric in the two electrons.

Wait, but wait, angular momentum states are symmetric under exchange if the particles are bosons, but electrons are fermions. Oh wait, but here we're talking about orbital angular momentum, which doesn't affect the exchange symmetry because electrons are spin-1/2 particles.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the CG coefficient using the formula.

The CG coefficient can be expressed as:

⟨ j1 m1 j2 m2 | J M ⟩ = [ ( (2J +1) (J - m1)(J + m1) ) / ( (j1 + j2 - J)(j1 + j2 + J) ) ) ]^(1/2) × some factors?

Alternatively, I think the CG coefficients for j1 = j2 = 1, J = l=2, and M=-1.

The general formula for CG coefficients is:

⟨ j1 m1 j2 m2 | J M ⟩ = (-1)^{J - j1 + m2} * [ ( (2J +1) ( (J - j1 + m2)! (J + j1 - m2 -1)! ) ) / ( (J + j1 + m2 +1)! (J - j1 - m2 +1)! ) ) ]^(1/2) * something.

Hmm, maybe that's getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the explicit values.

I found a table online (in my mind, of course) that for j1=1, j2=1, and J=2, the CG coefficients are:

For M=2: 1.

For M=1: (1/sqrt(2)) ( |1,0> + |0,1> )

For M=0: (1/sqrt(3)) ( |1,-1> + |0,0> + |-1,1> )

For M=-1: (1/sqrt(2)) ( | -1, 0> + |0, -1> )

For M=-2: 1.

Wait, that makes sense. So the state |2, -1> is (| -1, 0> + |0, -1> ) / sqrt(2).

So the state is a sum of those two product states, each with coefficient 1/sqrt(2).

So the state |1,1,2,-1> can be written as 1/sqrt(2) [ |m1=-1, m2=0> + |m1=0, m2=-1> ].

Now, the question is: what is the probability of measuring both m1 and m2 as -1. So, each electron's L_z would be -ℏ.

But wait, in the state |1,1,2,-1>, the product states are |m1=-1, m2=0> and |m1=0, m2=-1>. So in this state, the possible outcomes are either m1=-1 and m2=0, or m1=0 and m2=-1.

So in neither case do both m1 and m2 equal -1. So the coefficients for |m1=-1, m2=-1> is zero in this state. Because the state is a combination of |(-1,0)> and (0,-1), not involving (-1,-1).

So the probability of both L1z and L2z being -ℏ is zero.

Wait, but let's think again. The state is |1,1,2,-1> which is ( | -1, 0> + |0, -1> ) / sqrt(2). So if I were to measure m1 and m2, the possible outcomes are:

Case 1: m1=-1, m2=0. So L1z = -ℏ, L2z = 0 * ℏ = 0.

Case 2: m1=0, m2=-1. So L1z=0 * ℏ=0, L2z=-ℏ.

So in both possible measurement outcomes, one of them is -ℏ, the other is 0. There's no component where both are -1. So the probability of both being -1 is zero.

So the correct answer should be D) 0.

The coupled angular momentum state of the system is given as \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \), where \( l_1 = 1 \), \( l_2 = 1 \), \( l = 2 \) (total angular momentum), and \( m = -1 \) (the z-component of total angular momentum). The task is to determine the joint probability of measuring both \( L_{1z} \) and \( L_{2z} \) as \( -\hbar \), which corresponds to \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \).

### Key Analysis:

   - \( (-1, 0) \)

3. **Probability of Joint Measurement**: The state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) does not include the product state \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \). Therefore, the coefficient of \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) in the coupled state is zero. This means the probability of measuring \( m_1 = -1 \) and \( m_2 = -1 \) is zero.

### Conclusion:
The joint probability of measuring \( L_{1z} = -\hbar \) and \( L_{2z} = -\hbar \) is zero because the coupled state \( |1,1,2,-1\rangle \) does not include the \( |m_1 = -1, m_2 = -1\rangle \) component.
