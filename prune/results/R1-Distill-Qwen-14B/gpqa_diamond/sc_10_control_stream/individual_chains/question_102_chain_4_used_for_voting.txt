Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the eGFP isn't showing up in the fluorescent confocal microscopy after the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre. Let me try to unpack all the details given.

So, the setup involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. From what I remember, bicistronic means it has two ORFs in one vector, so two proteins can be expressed from the same transcript. The ligand's ORF is first, and it's fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF comes after, with the IRES element upstream. Oh wait, IRES is involved in internal ribosome entry sites, so it allows for the translation of the second ORF without the need for a stop codon and another start. 

Looking at the construct: between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, it's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites and can flip them. So, when Cre is present, the stop cassette would be excised, allowing the ORFs to be expressed.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, so the ligand should be expressed when the construct is active. The receptor is under the control of the IRES, which I think requires the preceding ORF (ligand) to be translated first, but I'm not entirely sure.

The antibodies were made against the overexpressed proteins, so they should detect both ligand and receptor. When they tested on Western blot, the actin loading is a control, so that's fine. The problem is after breeding the mice and using SOX10-Cre.

Wait, SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. So the Cre is under SOX10's control, meaning it's expressed in neural crest cells. The mice are homozygous for the construct, so each allele has the bicistronic vector. When crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre should excise the stop cassettes in the neural crest cells, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But in the experiment, the eGFP isn't showing up. What's going on?

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the vector is for the same cell to express both. The construct is in the same cell, so if Cre is active, both ligand and receptor should be expressed. I'm not sure how this would affect eGFP expression directly. Maybe the ligand-receptor interaction is paracrine, but that's about their function, not expression in the construct.

B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. So the eGFP isn't getting to the cell surface. But the construct is designed with the stop cassette, so when Cre is active, the stop is removed. If the eGFP is not in frame, maybe the protein isn't made properly. But if it's stuck in the Golgi, you might not see the GFP signal. But would that happen specifically in the transfection to astrocytes, or in the mice? The Western blot was on primary astrocyte culture, but the question is about the mouse model.

Wait, but the problem said they breed mice homozygous for the construct. So the construct is present in the genome. When they cross with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. The Cre should excise the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But in the mouse, why isn't eGFP showing up? Maybe the stop cassette wasn't excised correctly. Let's think about the lox sites. The ligand has loxP sites, and the receptor has lox2272. Cre recognizes loxP, but lox2272 is a variant. I think lox2272 is a mutant that is recognized by Cre but not FLP. So, the way the vector is set up, the ligand and mCherry are separated by a loxP-stop-loxP. When Cre is present, it should excise this, so ligand and mCherry are expressed as a single ORF. Same for the receptor; the stop cassette is between receptor and eGFP, with lox2272. Wait, Cre can't cut lox2272 unless it's a specific variant or if the construct uses the right recombinase.

Wait, no. Wait, the loxP is recognized by Cre, and lox2272 is a mutant that requires Cre to recombine, but with a different efficiency. So, if the vector is designed so that both stops are under the same Cre excision, then using Cre should remove both stops.

But wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, so ligand expression is driven by that. The receptor is after the IRES, which is dependent on the translation of the ligand. So, when Cre is active, the ligand should be expressed, which might allow the receptor to be translated as well.

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic. The CBA promoter drives the transcription of both the ligand and the receptor. The IRES allows the receptor's ORF to be translated after the ligand. But without the stop cassette being removed, the mCherry and eGFP fusions might not be expressed because the stop codons are in place.

But when Cre is present, it would remove the stop cassettes. So, in neural crest cells, both ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

But in the mouse, they don't see green (eGFP). So what's wrong?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop cassette wasn't excised correctly, then the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop codon is still present. So the receptor-eGFP would not be expressed. Wait, but if the stop is correctly excised, then the ORF would be continuous: receptor followed by eGFP.

Wait, another thought: The loxP and lox2272 sites are different. Suppose the Cre used here doesn't recognize lox2272. So, the stop between the receptor and eGFP isn't excised. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the stop is still there. But does Cre recognize lox2272?

I think lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by Cre but perhaps less efficiently. Or maybe requires Cre with certain modifications. Alternatively, maybe the vector was designed so that both stops are flanked by loxP sites, but in this case, one is loxP and the other is lox2272. So, the Cre would only excise the loxP site, not the lox2272. So, the eGFP would be stuck because the stop isn't removed.

Wait, the ligand ORF is between loxP-stop-loxP, so Cre would excise that, allowing the ligand-mCherry to be expressed. The receptor is followed by lox2272-stop-lox2272. If the mouse's Cre doesn't recognize lox2272, then the stop remains, so the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed. So, in the Western blot, perhaps the ligand is expressed but not the receptor, which is what would happen. But in the mouse, they're only seeing the ligand, so the eGFP (receptor) isn't expressed. But why aren't they seeing either in the Western blot? Wait, no, the Western blot was after transfecting the plasmid into astrocytes. So the plasmid may not have Cre (unless transfected with Cre as well), so the stops would remain. But the mouse model uses Cre to excise. Wait, in the mouse, the construct is in the genome, and when crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the stops should be removed, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But in the question, after the mice are born, they look for eGFP. They don't see it. So, perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop wasn't removed. So why?

Wait, the vector has the ligand ORF at 5', with mCherry, and the receptor ORF at 3' with eGFP, but the ligand is under CBA promoter. The IRES is upstream of the receptor. So without the Cre, the stop cassettes block the expression of mCherry and eGFP. But Cre is supposed to remove them.

But if the Cre can only excise the loxP sites but not the lox2272, then the eGFP's stop remains. So, the ligand-mCherry would be expressed (since the loxP is excised), but the receptor-eGFP would not be. So, in the confocal, you might see mCherry (red) but not eGFP (green). But the question says they don't see green. But in the options, the correct answer would relate to why eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is constitutive, but the receptor is under IRES, which is dependent on the prior translation of the ligand. So, if the ligand is expressed (because the loxP is excised), then the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed as well.

But if the stop between receptor and eGFP isn't excised, then the eGFP would not be expressed. So, the problem is that the lox2272 site isn't being cut.

Alternatively, maybe the stop is still present because the lox2272 wasn't correctly recognized by Cre. Or perhaps the vector design is such that only the loxP is cut, and the lox2272 remains.

So, in the bicistronic vector, the ligand and mCherry are separated by a loxP-stop, and the receptor and eGFP are separated by lox2272-stop. If Cre is present, it can cut the loxP sites but not the lox2272. So, the ligand-mCherry would be expressed, but the receptor-eGFP would not. Hence, in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed, which is why the confocal doesn't show green.

But why is the lox2272 stop not cut? Because perhaps the Cre used doesn't recognize lox2272? Or maybe the plasmid uses a different Cre variant, but in the mouse, the SOX10-Cre is standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 is designed to be cut by Cre but perhaps only when in a certain configuration. Or maybe the vector uses a different type of recombinase.

Wait, another angle: SOX10-Cre is active in neural crest cells. If the Cre can't recognize lox2272, then the stop between receptor and eGFP remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Thus, the eGFP wouldn't show up in the confocal. But why would the Cre not recognize lox2272?

I think lox2272 is a variant that can be recognized by Cre, but perhaps in a different orientation or requires a longer stretch. Alternatively, maybe the vector is designed in a way that the lox2272 is in a different reading frame, so even if Cre cuts it, the ORF isn't correctly restored. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop isn't excised because the recombinase isn't active in that region. But the SOX10-Cre is supposed to be active in the neural crest cells, which is where the construct is supposed to be active.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES isn't working. The IRES is upstream of the receptor ORF. So, the ligand is expressed, then the IRES drives translation of the receptor. But without the eGFP being expressed, perhaps the IRES isn't functional. But that would affect the receptor expression regardless of the stop.

Alternatively, perhaps the frame isn't correct. If the ORF of the receptor is in a different reading frame after the stop is excised, the eGFP won't be expressed. Oh wait, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF isn't continuous, then eGFP isn't expressed. How would that happen?

In the construct, the receptor's ORF is followed by the stop in lox2272. If the Cre excises the stop, the reading frame must continue into eGFP. If the stop wasn't excised, no problem. But if the stop is excised, the eGFP should be in frame. So why would it not be?

Unless the vector was designed incorrectly. Wait, perhaps the ORFs are in the same frame. If the stop is between the receptor and eGFP, then when the stop is excised, the ORF continues. But if the lox2272 sites are in a way that disrupts the frame, then after excision, the ORF is out of frame, leading to a premature stop codon or no eGFP being expressed.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the expression of the construct isn't happening because the IRES isn't working. But why would that happen? The IRES allows for the translation of the second ORF after the first.

Another point: the Western blot was done on transfected astrocytes. If the astrocytes don't express Cre, then the stop cassettes remain, so neither mCherry nor eGFP would be expressed. But the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, so maybe the Western didn't show expression because the stops weren't excised, but in the mouse model, they should have been.

Wait, but the mouse model uses SOX10-Cre, which is only active in neural crest-derived cells. So in the mouse, the construct is only active there, but the Western was done on primary astrocytes, which are not neural crest cells, so the Cre wasn't active, so the stops weren't excised. Hence, in the Western, the proteins may not be expressed, but why did they test it on astrocytes? Maybe that's a separate issue, but the question is about the mouse model.

So back to the mouse. The offspring are visualized, and no green signal. So the eGFP isn't expressed. Why?

Looking at the options again:

Option C is about enhancer missing. If the enhancer is missing, the ligand and receptor aren't expressed. But the CBA promoter is strong, so it should drive expression regardless of enhancer.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If they're not in frame, then even if the stop is excised, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop between the receptor and eGFP wasn't excised because the Cre didn't cut the lox2272 sites. So the eGFP isn't expressed. But why would that be?

Wait, lox2272 is a mutant site that can be recognized by Cre but isn't efficiently cut unless specific conditions are met. For example, the loxP and lox2272 can recombine with each other but not in a way that efficiently removes the stop. Or perhaps the orientation is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector uses loxP and lox2272 in a way that their recombination requires FLP instead of Cre, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, another thought: the vector has the ligand under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is after the IRES. So when Cre excises the loxP stop (between ligand and mCherry), the ligand is expressed, which allows the IRES to drive translation of the receptor. But the eGFP is after the receptor, and its stop is in lox2272. So if the stop is not excised, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So if the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the stop is still present because the Cre didn't cut the lox2272 sites. Then, the question is why.

Another angle: the vector is a bicistronic construct where the two cassettes are under different recombinase sites. So, if only one of the lox sites is cut, you get partial expression. For both to be expressed, both lox sites need to be cut. But if the Cre can't cut both, then perhaps only the ligand is expressed, not the receptor.

But why would the Cre not cut the lox2272 sites? I thought Cre can cut lox2272, but maybe it's less efficient or requires a different configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 sites were in a way that the stop isn't excised. So, the eGFP isn't expressed.

In that case, the reason for no eGFP is that the stop in the lox2272 cassette wasn't excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But looking at the options, none directly state that. The options are A to D.

Wait, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop wasn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. If the stop was excised, but the ORF is out of frame, that also causes no eGFP. So which is more likely?

If the vector wasn't designed correctly, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor. So, when the stop is excised, the ORF of the receptor is correctly expressed, but the eGFP is in a different reading frame, leading to a frameshift and no eGFP expression.

But how would that happen? The vector's design must have the correct reading frame. If the vector wasn't correctly designed, then eGFP isn't in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 is inserted in a way that the ORF is disrupted when Cre recombination occurs. For example, if the lox2272 is inserted between the receptor and eGFP, and upon recombination, the eGFP is inserted out of frame.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of the possible outcomes.

If the lox2272 isn't recognized by Cre, then the stop remains. So, the eGFP isn't expressed. The IRES allows the receptor to be expressed, but without the eGFP. So, the receptor is expressed, but not tagged with eGFP.

So when the mouse is visualized, you'd expect to see the ligand (if mCherry is expressed). But the question is about the eGFP not showing up. So why isn't the eGFP expressed?

If the stop wasn't excised, because Cre didn't cut the lox2272, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

But why would the Cre not cut the lox2272? Maybe because the Cre variant doesn't recognize it, or perhaps the vector isn't designed for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 is in the opposite orientation, making it unrecognizable to Cre. So, the stop isn't excised.

Wait, the lox2272 is a variant of loxP, but when Cre is present, it can still cut. However, if the lox2272 sites are in the same orientation as the loxP, then perhaps the Cre can't efficiently cut them, leading to the stop remaining.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 is on the same chromosome, but in a different orientation, so the Cre can't cut, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct uses a different strain of Cre, but that's probably not the case.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, but maybe the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if the lox sites are in a way that after excision, the ORF is disrupted, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the stop wasn't excised because the Cre isn't active, but the question uses SOX10-Cre, which should be active in the neural crest.

Wait, perhaps the lox2272 is a lox site that requires FLP recombinase, not Cre. But that's unlikely because the construct is designed for Cre.

Wait, no, FLP recombinase is used with FRT sites, whereas Cre uses loxP. So, lox2272 is a variant of loxP, not FRT.

So, if the construct uses lox2272, which is recognized by Cre, but the Cre isn't working properly, then the stop remains. But why would that be?

Another possibility: the vector has two lox sites: one for the ligand (loxP) and one for the receptor (lox2272). If the Cre used is not active in the cells (neural crest) for some reason, the stops remain. But the SOX10-Cre should be active.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But then why would the eGFP not be expressed? Because the eGFP is part of the receptor construct.

Wait, no. The eGFP is after the receptor. So, if the IRES isn't working, the receptor ORF isn't translated, so eGFP isn't either.

But the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed. If the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor and eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the ligand would be, since it's under CBA.

But again, the question is about the eGFP not showing, not the ligand.

Wait, the IRES is upstream of the receptor, so the ligand is expressed first, then the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed. So, if the IRES is functional, the receptor is expressed, including the eGFP.

But if the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor wouldn't be expressed. However, the IRES is a known element that allows for internal initiation of translation, so that's less likely.

So, in the case where the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps it's because the stop between receptor and eGFP isn't excised. That would prevent eGFP from being expressed.

If the Cre isn't able to excise the lox2272 site, the stop remains, and the eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, the eGFP wouldn't be visible.

So, the possible reason is that the lox2272 sites aren't recognized by Cre. But looking at the options, none directly address that. The closest option is D, about the frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette isn't excised because the IRES isn't working, but that would affect both ORFs.

Another thought: the IRES may not be functional in the mouse, leading to the receptor not being expressed. But the ligand would be expressed since it's under a strong promoter. So, perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed because the IRES isn't allowing the receptor to be expressed.

But the options don't mention IRES function.

So, looking again at the options, which one is more plausible?

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So when the stop is excised, the ORF of the receptor and eGFP is not continuous, leading to no eGFP expression.

Or, the stop wasn't excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But why?

Wait, the vector could have the lox2272 sites in a way that when Cre is active, the stop isn't excised. For example, if the lox sites are arranged in a way that the stop remains.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed so that the stop is between the receptor and eGFP, and Cre doesn't cut the lox2272, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But why would the Cre not cut it? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps it's because the lox2272 is a different site and is not efficiently cut by Cre, leading to the stop remaining.

But if the stop remains, then the eGFP isn't expressed. So, the answer might be D, but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, another possibility: the IRES is after the ligand, so the receptor is expressed only if the ligand is expressed. But if the ligand is expressed but the receptor isn't, then the eGFP isn't expressed. But why?

Wait, the ligand is expressed because the loxP site was excised. The IRES allows the receptor to be expressed. So, the receptor should be expressed. But if the stop after the receptor isn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the problem is that the stop after the receptor isn't excised. Thus, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But why is the stop not excised?

Maybe the Cre isn't active, but the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should be active.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach.

Looking at the answer options again:

Option D suggests that the ORF of the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, so the eGFP isn't expressed. If the stop is excised, but the frame is wrong, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

But how would that happen? It would require that the vector's design was incorrect, placing the eGFP out of frame relative to the receptor.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector's design is correct, and the stop wasn't excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed when the Cre is present. The only way I can think it's not expressed is if the stop wasn't removed, perhaps because the lox2272 wasn't cut.

But none of the options directly address that.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, but if the stop is excised, the ORF would be continuous. If the eGFP is in a different frame, then no.

Alternatively, maybe the vector has a stop codon in the same frame, so even if the lox sites are cut, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in a different frame, leading to a premature stop codon. So, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But how would that happen? It would depend on how the vector was designed.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector's design for the eGFP is such that it's not in frame, so when the stop is cut, the ORF is disrupted.

But without more information, it's hard to say.

Wait, another angle: the vector could be a 'stop cassette' that remains, preventing the eGFP from being expressed. But if the Cre is active, the stop should be removed.

So, if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. So why isn't the stop being removed?

Perhaps the lox2272 isn't recognized by Cre. But I thought lox2272 is recognized by Cre.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has a lox2272 that's in the same orientation as the loxP, but in a way that the Cre doesn't recognize it.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is using a different type of lox site. For example, if the lox2272 sites are on the same arm, leading to a deletion that doesn't remove the stop.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed such that the lox2272 is in a location that doesn't allow the stop to be excised.

But without knowing the specific vector design, it's hard to say.

In the absence of more info, I think the most plausible answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if they are not in frame, even if the stop is excised, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. Stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 sites separate the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP constructs. SOX10-Cre mice were used to excise the stop cassettes in neural crest cells, but no green signal (eGFP) was observed under confocal microscopy. The task is to determine the most likely reason for the lack of eGFP expression.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on nearby cells. However, the construct is designed for co-expression of both proteins in the same cell, not in a paracrine relationship. This does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.  

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would not reach the cell surface, preventing fluorescence. However, this issue would likely affect all cells expressing the receptor, and the construct design does not suggest such a problem. This is unlikely to be the primary reason.  

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, which should drive robust expression regardless of enhancers. The IRES element further ensures translation of the receptor. There is no evidence to suggest an enhancer is missing, making this option less plausible.  

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the removal of the stop cassette by Cre would not restore a continuous ORF, leading to no eGFP expression. This could occur if the vector was designed incorrectly, placing the eGFP out of frame with the receptor. This is a plausible explanation for the lack of eGFP fluorescence.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the lack of eGFP expression is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, preventing proper translation of the eGFP after the stop cassette is excised. This aligns with the design of the construct and explains the absence of fluorescence in the confocal microscopy.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the eGFP isn't showing up in the fluorescent confocal microscopy after the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre. Let me try to unpack all the details given.

So, the setup involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector. From what I remember, bicistronic means it has two ORFs in one vector, so two proteins can be expressed from the same transcript. The ligand's ORF is first, and it's fused to mCherry. The receptor's ORF comes after, with the IRES element upstream. Oh wait, IRES is involved in internal ribosome entry sites, so it allows for the translation of the second ORF without the need for a stop codon and another start. 

Looking at the construct: between ligand and mCherry, there's a loxP-stop-loxP cassette. And between receptor and eGFP, it's a lox2272-stop-lox2272 cassette. Cre recombinase recognizes loxP sites and can flip them. So, when Cre is present, the stop cassette would be excised, allowing the ORFs to be expressed.

The ligand is under the CBA promoter. CBA is a strong promoter, so the ligand should be expressed when the construct is active. The receptor is under the control of the IRES, which I think requires the preceding ORF (ligand) to be translated first, but I'm not entirely sure.

The antibodies were made against the overexpressed proteins, so they should detect both ligand and receptor. When they tested on Western blot, the actin loading is a control, so that's fine. The problem is after breeding the mice and using SOX10-Cre.

Wait, SOX10 is a transcription factor involved in neural crest development. So the Cre is under SOX10's control, meaning it's expressed in neural crest cells. The mice are homozygous for the construct, so each allele has the bicistronic vector. When crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre should excise the stop cassettes in the neural crest cells, allowing the ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But in the experiment, the eGFP isn't showing up. What's going on?

Looking at the options:

A) Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship. Paracrine means they act on nearby cells. But the vector is for the same cell to express both. The construct is in the same cell, so if Cre is active, both ligand and receptor should be expressed. I'm not sure how this would affect eGFP expression directly. Maybe the ligand-receptor interaction is paracrine, but that's about their function, not expression in the construct.

B) The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi. So the eGFP isn't getting to the cell surface. But the construct is designed with the stop cassette, so when Cre is active, the stop is removed. If the eGFP is not in frame, maybe the protein isn't made properly. But if it's stuck in the Golgi, you might not see the GFP signal. But would that happen specifically in the transfection to astrocytes, or in the mice? The Western blot was on primary astrocyte culture, but the question is about the mouse model.

Wait, but the problem said they breed mice homozygous for the construct. So the construct is present in the genome. When they cross with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. The Cre should excise the stop cassettes, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But in the mouse, why isn't eGFP showing up? Maybe the stop cassette wasn't excised correctly. Let's think about the lox sites. The ligand has loxP sites, and the receptor has lox2272. Cre recognizes loxP, but lox2272 is a variant. I think lox2272 is a mutant that is recognized by Cre but not FLP. So, the way the vector is set up, the ligand and mCherry are separated by a loxP-stop-loxP. When Cre is present, it should excise this, so ligand and mCherry are expressed as a single ORF. Same for the receptor; the stop cassette is between receptor and eGFP, with lox2272. Wait, Cre can't cut lox2272 unless it's a specific variant or if the construct uses the right recombinase.

Wait, no. Wait, the loxP is recognized by Cre, and lox2272 is a mutant that requires Cre to recombine, but with a different efficiency. So, if the vector is designed so that both stops are under the same Cre excision, then using Cre should remove both stops.

But wait, the ligand is under the CBA promoter, so ligand expression is driven by that. The receptor is after the IRES, which is dependent on the translation of the ligand. So, when Cre is active, the ligand should be expressed, which might allow the receptor to be translated as well.

Wait, but the vector is bicistronic. The CBA promoter drives the transcription of both the ligand and the receptor. The IRES allows the receptor's ORF to be translated after the ligand. But without the stop cassette being removed, the mCherry and eGFP fusions might not be expressed because the stop codons are in place.

But when Cre is present, it would remove the stop cassettes. So, in neural crest cells, both ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP should be expressed.

But in the mouse, they don't see green (eGFP). So what's wrong?

Option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop cassette wasn't excised correctly, then the eGFP isn't expressed because the stop codon is still present. So the receptor-eGFP would not be expressed. Wait, but if the stop is correctly excised, then the ORF would be continuous: receptor followed by eGFP.

Wait, another thought: The loxP and lox2272 sites are different. Suppose the Cre used here doesn't recognize lox2272. So, the stop between the receptor and eGFP isn't excised. So the eGFP wouldn't be expressed because the stop is still there. But does Cre recognize lox2272?

I think lox2272 is a variant that is recognized by Cre but perhaps less efficiently. Or maybe requires Cre with certain modifications. Alternatively, maybe the vector was designed so that both stops are flanked by loxP sites, but in this case, one is loxP and the other is lox2272. So, the Cre would only excise the loxP site, not the lox2272. So, the eGFP would be stuck because the stop isn't removed.

Wait, the ligand ORF is between loxP-stop-loxP, so Cre would excise that, allowing the ligand-mCherry to be expressed. The receptor is followed by lox2272-stop-lox2272. If the mouse's Cre doesn't recognize lox2272, then the stop remains, so the receptor-eGFP isn't expressed. So, in the Western blot, perhaps the ligand is expressed but not the receptor, which is what would happen. But in the mouse, they're only seeing the ligand, so the eGFP (receptor) isn't expressed. But why aren't they seeing either in the Western blot? Wait, no, the Western blot was after transfecting the plasmid into astrocytes. So the plasmid may not have Cre (unless transfected with Cre as well), so the stops would remain. But the mouse model uses Cre to excise. Wait, in the mouse, the construct is in the genome, and when crossed with SOX10-Cre, the Cre is expressed in neural crest cells. So in those cells, the stops should be removed, allowing both ligand and receptor to be expressed.

But in the question, after the mice are born, they look for eGFP. They don't see it. So, perhaps the eGFP isn't being expressed because the stop wasn't removed. So why?

Wait, the vector has the ligand ORF at 5', with mCherry, and the receptor ORF at 3' with eGFP, but the ligand is under CBA promoter. The IRES is upstream of the receptor. So without the Cre, the stop cassettes block the expression of mCherry and eGFP. But Cre is supposed to remove them.

But if the Cre can only excise the loxP sites but not the lox2272, then the eGFP's stop remains. So, the ligand-mCherry would be expressed (since the loxP is excised), but the receptor-eGFP would not be. So, in the confocal, you might see mCherry (red) but not eGFP (green). But the question says they don't see green. But in the options, the correct answer would relate to why eGFP isn't expressed.

Wait, the ligand is under CBA promoter, which is constitutive, but the receptor is under IRES, which is dependent on the prior translation of the ligand. So, if the ligand is expressed (because the loxP is excised), then the IRES would allow the receptor to be expressed as well.

But if the stop between receptor and eGFP isn't excised, then the eGFP would not be expressed. So, the problem is that the lox2272 site isn't being cut.

Alternatively, maybe the stop is still present because the lox2272 wasn't correctly recognized by Cre. Or perhaps the vector design is such that only the loxP is cut, and the lox2272 remains.

So, in the bicistronic vector, the ligand and mCherry are separated by a loxP-stop, and the receptor and eGFP are separated by lox2272-stop. If Cre is present, it can cut the loxP sites but not the lox2272. So, the ligand-mCherry would be expressed, but the receptor-eGFP would not. Hence, in the mouse, the eGFP isn't expressed, which is why the confocal doesn't show green.

But why is the lox2272 stop not cut? Because perhaps the Cre used doesn't recognize lox2272? Or maybe the plasmid uses a different Cre variant, but in the mouse, the SOX10-Cre is standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 is designed to be cut by Cre but perhaps only when in a certain configuration. Or maybe the vector uses a different type of recombinase.

Wait, another angle: SOX10-Cre is active in neural crest cells. If the Cre can't recognize lox2272, then the stop between receptor and eGFP remains, so the eGFP isn't expressed. Thus, the eGFP wouldn't show up in the confocal. But why would the Cre not recognize lox2272?

I think lox2272 is a variant that can be recognized by Cre, but perhaps in a different orientation or requires a longer stretch. Alternatively, maybe the vector is designed in a way that the lox2272 is in a different reading frame, so even if Cre cuts it, the ORF isn't correctly restored. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop isn't excised because the recombinase isn't active in that region. But the SOX10-Cre is supposed to be active in the neural crest cells, which is where the construct is supposed to be active.

Alternatively, maybe the IRES isn't working. The IRES is upstream of the receptor ORF. So, the ligand is expressed, then the IRES drives translation of the receptor. But without the eGFP being expressed, perhaps the IRES isn't functional. But that would affect the receptor expression regardless of the stop.

Alternatively, perhaps the frame isn't correct. If the ORF of the receptor is in a different reading frame after the stop is excised, the eGFP won't be expressed. Oh wait, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the ORF isn't continuous, then eGFP isn't expressed. How would that happen?

In the construct, the receptor's ORF is followed by the stop in lox2272. If the Cre excises the stop, the reading frame must continue into eGFP. If the stop wasn't excised, no problem. But if the stop is excised, the eGFP should be in frame. So why would it not be?

Unless the vector was designed incorrectly. Wait, perhaps the ORFs are in the same frame. If the stop is between the receptor and eGFP, then when the stop is excised, the ORF continues. But if the lox2272 sites are in a way that disrupts the frame, then after excision, the ORF is out of frame, leading to a premature stop codon or no eGFP being expressed.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, perhaps the expression of the construct isn't happening because the IRES isn't working. But why would that happen? The IRES allows for the translation of the second ORF after the first.

Another point: the Western blot was done on transfected astrocytes. If the astrocytes don't express Cre, then the stop cassettes remain, so neither mCherry nor eGFP would be expressed. But the antibodies were raised against the overexpressed proteins, so maybe the Western didn't show expression because the stops weren't excised, but in the mouse model, they should have been.

Wait, but the mouse model uses SOX10-Cre, which is only active in neural crest-derived cells. So in the mouse, the construct is only active there, but the Western was done on primary astrocytes, which are not neural crest cells, so the Cre wasn't active, so the stops weren't excised. Hence, in the Western, the proteins may not be expressed, but why did they test it on astrocytes? Maybe that's a separate issue, but the question is about the mouse model.

So back to the mouse. The offspring are visualized, and no green signal. So the eGFP isn't expressed. Why?

Looking at the options again:

Option C is about enhancer missing. If the enhancer is missing, the ligand and receptor aren't expressed. But the CBA promoter is strong, so it should drive expression regardless of enhancer.

Option D: receptor and eGFP not in frame. If they're not in frame, then even if the stop is excised, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop between the receptor and eGFP wasn't excised because the Cre didn't cut the lox2272 sites. So the eGFP isn't expressed. But why would that be?

Wait, lox2272 is a mutant site that can be recognized by Cre but isn't efficiently cut unless specific conditions are met. For example, the loxP and lox2272 can recombine with each other but not in a way that efficiently removes the stop. Or perhaps the orientation is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector uses loxP and lox2272 in a way that their recombination requires FLP instead of Cre, but that's probably not the case.

Wait, another thought: the vector has the ligand under CBA, which is a strong promoter. The receptor is after the IRES. So when Cre excises the loxP stop (between ligand and mCherry), the ligand is expressed, which allows the IRES to drive translation of the receptor. But the eGFP is after the receptor, and its stop is in lox2272. So if the stop is not excised, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So if the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps the stop is still present because the Cre didn't cut the lox2272 sites. Then, the question is why.

Another angle: the vector is a bicistronic construct where the two cassettes are under different recombinase sites. So, if only one of the lox sites is cut, you get partial expression. For both to be expressed, both lox sites need to be cut. But if the Cre can't cut both, then perhaps only the ligand is expressed, not the receptor.

But why would the Cre not cut the lox2272 sites? I thought Cre can cut lox2272, but maybe it's less efficient or requires a different configuration.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 sites were in a way that the stop isn't excised. So, the eGFP isn't expressed.

In that case, the reason for no eGFP is that the stop in the lox2272 cassette wasn't excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But looking at the options, none directly state that. The options are A to D.

Wait, option D says the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. If the stop wasn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed. If the stop was excised, but the ORF is out of frame, that also causes no eGFP. So which is more likely?

If the vector wasn't designed correctly, perhaps the eGFP is not in frame with the receptor. So, when the stop is excised, the ORF of the receptor is correctly expressed, but the eGFP is in a different reading frame, leading to a frameshift and no eGFP expression.

But how would that happen? The vector's design must have the correct reading frame. If the vector wasn't correctly designed, then eGFP isn't in frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 is inserted in a way that the ORF is disrupted when Cre recombination occurs. For example, if the lox2272 is inserted between the receptor and eGFP, and upon recombination, the eGFP is inserted out of frame.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of the possible outcomes.

If the lox2272 isn't recognized by Cre, then the stop remains. So, the eGFP isn't expressed. The IRES allows the receptor to be expressed, but without the eGFP. So, the receptor is expressed, but not tagged with eGFP.

So when the mouse is visualized, you'd expect to see the ligand (if mCherry is expressed). But the question is about the eGFP not showing up. So why isn't the eGFP expressed?

If the stop wasn't excised, because Cre didn't cut the lox2272, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

But why would the Cre not cut the lox2272? Maybe because the Cre variant doesn't recognize it, or perhaps the vector isn't designed for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 is in the opposite orientation, making it unrecognizable to Cre. So, the stop isn't excised.

Wait, the lox2272 is a variant of loxP, but when Cre is present, it can still cut. However, if the lox2272 sites are in the same orientation as the loxP, then perhaps the Cre can't efficiently cut them, leading to the stop remaining.

Alternatively, perhaps the lox2272 is on the same chromosome, but in a different orientation, so the Cre can't cut, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the construct uses a different strain of Cre, but that's probably not the case.

Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck, but maybe the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if the lox sites are in a way that after excision, the ORF is disrupted, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

Alternatively, another possibility is that the stop wasn't excised because the Cre isn't active, but the question uses SOX10-Cre, which should be active in the neural crest.

Wait, perhaps the lox2272 is a lox site that requires FLP recombinase, not Cre. But that's unlikely because the construct is designed for Cre.

Wait, no, FLP recombinase is used with FRT sites, whereas Cre uses loxP. So, lox2272 is a variant of loxP, not FRT.

So, if the construct uses lox2272, which is recognized by Cre, but the Cre isn't working properly, then the stop remains. But why would that be?

Another possibility: the vector has two lox sites: one for the ligand (loxP) and one for the receptor (lox2272). If the Cre used is not active in the cells (neural crest) for some reason, the stops remain. But the SOX10-Cre should be active.

Alternatively, perhaps the IRES isn't working, so the receptor isn't expressed. But then why would the eGFP not be expressed? Because the eGFP is part of the receptor construct.

Wait, no. The eGFP is after the receptor. So, if the IRES isn't working, the receptor ORF isn't translated, so eGFP isn't either.

But the problem is that the eGFP isn't expressed. If the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor and eGFP wouldn't be expressed. But the ligand would be, since it's under CBA.

But again, the question is about the eGFP not showing, not the ligand.

Wait, the IRES is upstream of the receptor, so the ligand is expressed first, then the IRES allows the receptor to be expressed. So, if the IRES is functional, the receptor is expressed, including the eGFP.

But if the IRES isn't functional, then the receptor wouldn't be expressed. However, the IRES is a known element that allows for internal initiation of translation, so that's less likely.

So, in the case where the eGFP isn't expressed, perhaps it's because the stop between receptor and eGFP isn't excised. That would prevent eGFP from being expressed.

If the Cre isn't able to excise the lox2272 site, the stop remains, and the eGFP isn't expressed. Therefore, the eGFP wouldn't be visible.

So, the possible reason is that the lox2272 sites aren't recognized by Cre. But looking at the options, none directly address that. The closest option is D, about the frame.

Alternatively, perhaps the stop cassette isn't excised because the IRES isn't working, but that would affect both ORFs.

Another thought: the IRES may not be functional in the mouse, leading to the receptor not being expressed. But the ligand would be expressed since it's under a strong promoter. So, perhaps the eGFP isn't expressed because the IRES isn't allowing the receptor to be expressed.

But the options don't mention IRES function.

So, looking again at the options, which one is more plausible?

Option D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. So when the stop is excised, the ORF of the receptor and eGFP is not continuous, leading to no eGFP expression.

Or, the stop wasn't excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed. But why?

Wait, the vector could have the lox2272 sites in a way that when Cre is active, the stop isn't excised. For example, if the lox sites are arranged in a way that the stop remains.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed so that the stop is between the receptor and eGFP, and Cre doesn't cut the lox2272, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But why would the Cre not cut it? I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps it's because the lox2272 is a different site and is not efficiently cut by Cre, leading to the stop remaining.

But if the stop remains, then the eGFP isn't expressed. So, the answer might be D, but I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, another possibility: the IRES is after the ligand, so the receptor is expressed only if the ligand is expressed. But if the ligand is expressed but the receptor isn't, then the eGFP isn't expressed. But why?

Wait, the ligand is expressed because the loxP site was excised. The IRES allows the receptor to be expressed. So, the receptor should be expressed. But if the stop after the receptor isn't excised, the eGFP isn't expressed.

So the problem is that the stop after the receptor isn't excised. Thus, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But why is the stop not excised?

Maybe the Cre isn't active, but the mice were crossed with SOX10-Cre, which should be active.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try another approach.

Looking at the answer options again:

Option D suggests that the ORF of the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, so the eGFP isn't expressed. If the stop is excised, but the frame is wrong, then the eGFP isn't expressed.

But how would that happen? It would require that the vector's design was incorrect, placing the eGFP out of frame relative to the receptor.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector's design is correct, and the stop wasn't excised, so the eGFP isn't expressed.

But the question is about why the eGFP isn't expressed when the Cre is present. The only way I can think it's not expressed is if the stop wasn't removed, perhaps because the lox2272 wasn't cut.

But none of the options directly address that.

So, perhaps the correct answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame.

Wait, but if the stop is excised, the ORF would be continuous. If the eGFP is in a different frame, then no.

Alternatively, maybe the vector has a stop codon in the same frame, so even if the lox sites are cut, the eGFP isn't expressed.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the eGFP is in a different frame, leading to a premature stop codon. So, the eGFP isn't expressed.

But how would that happen? It would depend on how the vector was designed.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector's design for the eGFP is such that it's not in frame, so when the stop is cut, the ORF is disrupted.

But without more information, it's hard to say.

Wait, another angle: the vector could be a 'stop cassette' that remains, preventing the eGFP from being expressed. But if the Cre is active, the stop should be removed.

So, if the stop isn't removed, the eGFP isn't expressed. So why isn't the stop being removed?

Perhaps the lox2272 isn't recognized by Cre. But I thought lox2272 is recognized by Cre.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector has a lox2272 that's in the same orientation as the loxP, but in a way that the Cre doesn't recognize it.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is using a different type of lox site. For example, if the lox2272 sites are on the same arm, leading to a deletion that doesn't remove the stop.

Alternatively, perhaps the vector is designed such that the lox2272 is in a location that doesn't allow the stop to be excised.

But without knowing the specific vector design, it's hard to say.

In the absence of more info, I think the most plausible answer is D: the receptor and eGFP are not in frame. Because if they are not in frame, even if the stop is excised, the eGFP wouldn't be expressed.


The question involves a bicistronic lox-Cre vector designed to express a ligand and receptor pair in neural crest cells. The ligand is fused to mCherry, and the receptor is fused to eGFP. The ligand is under the CBA promoter, and the receptor is under an IRES regulatory element. Stop cassettes with loxP and lox2272 sites separate the ligand-mCherry and receptor-eGFP constructs. SOX10-Cre mice were used to excise the stop cassettes in neural crest cells, but no green signal (eGFP) was observed under confocal microscopy. The task is to determine the most likely reason for the lack of eGFP expression.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Ligand and receptor are in a paracrine relationship**  
   This option suggests that the ligand and receptor act on nearby cells. However, the construct is designed for co-expression of both proteins in the same cell, not in a paracrine relationship. This does not explain the lack of eGFP expression.  

2. **Option B: The receptor-eGFP construct is stuck in the Golgi**  
   If the receptor-eGFP were stuck in the Golgi, it would not reach the cell surface, preventing fluorescence. However, this issue would likely affect all cells expressing the receptor, and the construct design does not suggest such a problem. This is unlikely to be the primary reason.  

3. **Option C: The enhancer for the ligand and receptor expression is missing**  
   The ligand is under the strong CBA promoter, which should drive robust expression regardless of enhancers. The IRES element further ensures translation of the receptor. There is no evidence to suggest an enhancer is missing, making this option less plausible.  

4. **Option D: The receptor and eGFP are not in frame**  
   If the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, the removal of the stop cassette by Cre would not restore a continuous ORF, leading to no eGFP expression. This could occur if the vector was designed incorrectly, placing the eGFP out of frame with the receptor. This is a plausible explanation for the lack of eGFP fluorescence.

### Conclusion:
The most likely reason for the lack of eGFP expression is that the receptor and eGFP are not in frame, preventing proper translation of the eGFP after the stop cassette is excised. This aligns with the design of the construct and explains the absence of fluorescence in the confocal microscopy.

**Answer: D**
