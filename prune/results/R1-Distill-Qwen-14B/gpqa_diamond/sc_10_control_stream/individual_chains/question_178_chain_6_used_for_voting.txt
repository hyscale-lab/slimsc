Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a Lagrangian and figuring out the mass dimension of a coupling constant and whether the theory is renormalizable. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me think through this step by step.

The Lagrangian given is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}. Oh right, σ_{μν} is defined as (i/2)[γ_μ, γ_ν], which is the antisymmetric product of gamma matrices. So, this term involves the field strength tensor F, which usually comes from electromagnetism or non-Abelian gauge fields. But wait, here I think we're probably dealing with QED, so F is the electromagnetic field tensor.

First, I need to find the mass dimension of κ. To do that, I should remember how to determine the mass dimension of each term in the Lagrangian. The Lagrangian has to be dimensionless in natural units (since the action S = ∫ L d^4x is dimensionless, and d^4x has dimension [Mass]^-4). So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4, because when you integrate over four dimensions, the dimensions have to cancel out.

Let me break down each part of the term: κ ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F^{μν}.

Each field has a mass dimension. I recall that for a Dirac spinor ψ, the mass dimension is 3/2. Because the Dirac equation is (iγ^μ ∂_μ - m)ψ = 0. The derivative ∂ has dimension 1, so the term with ∂ must match the mass term. So, ψ has [ψ] = 3/2.

The field strength tensor F^{μν} comes from the gauge field A. The gauge field A has mass dimension 1. Because the field strength is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ, which would have the same dimension as A. So [F^{μν}] = 1.

Now let's look at σ_{μν}. Since it's a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless (they're just matrices), the structure σ_{μν} itself is dimensionless. So the term ψ̄ σ ψ would have the same dimension as ψ̄ ψ, which is 3/2 + 3/2 = 3.

Wait, wait. So ψ̄ is the adjoint, which also has dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ would be [ψ̄][σ][ψ] = (3/2) * 1 * (3/2) = 9/4? Wait, no, wait. No, because σ is an operator made from the gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So [σ_{μν}] is dimensionless. So ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ would have the same dimension as ψ̄ ψ, which is 3. Because 3/2 + 3/2 =3.

So the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F is κ multiplied by [ψ̄ σ ψ] [F]. [ψ̄ σ ψ] is 3, [F] is 1. So the whole term has dimension [κ] + 3 + 1 = [κ] +4.

But the Lagrangian has to have dimension 4. So [κ] +4 =4 → [κ] = 0. Wait, but wait, that's not matching any of the options. Because the options give either -1 or 1. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, no. Let me double-check each part. I might have messed up the dimensions of F or ψ.

Wait, let's think again. The Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4 because when you integrate over four dimensions, each term in L must have dimension 4 to balance the volume element (d^4x, which has dimension [Mass]^4, but since the action is dimensionless, the Lagrangian must have [Mass]^4, but wait, no. Actually, the integral is ∫ L d^4x, which must be dimensionless. So [L] [d^4x] = dimensionless. [d^4x] is [Mass]^-4. So [L] must be [Mass]^4.

Wait no, in natural units, [d^4x] is [Energy]^-4, which is [Mass]^-4. So [Lagrangian density] must have dimension [Mass]^4 so that when multiplied by [Mass]^-4 from d^4x, the whole thing is dimensionless.

Wait, wait. Let me get this right: the action S is ∫ L d^4x. The units of S must be dimensionless. But d^4x has units of [Mass]^-4. So L must have units of [Mass]^4 to make the integral dimensionless. So each term in L must have dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So let me re-calculate each part.

ψ̄ σ ψ F: each field's dimension.

ψ̄ and ψ each have dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3/2 + 3/2 =3. F has dimension 1. So the product is 3 + 1=4. So the term κ times that must have dimension 4. So [κ] must be [4 - (3+1)]? Wait, no. Wait, the term is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ ψ F). So that term's dimension is [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F]. Wait, no, because σ is made from gammas, which are dimensionless. So [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = [ψ̄][ψ][F] because [σ]=0.

Wait, no, [σ_{μν}] is dimensionless. So [ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F] = [ψ̄][ψ][F] = (3/2) + (3/2) +1 = 3 +1 =4.

So the entire term is κ multiplied by something that has dimension 4. So [κ] +4 =4 → [κ]=0.

Wait, but the options don't have [κ]=0 as an option. Hmm. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, the Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. Alternatively, maybe I have the wrong expression. Let me make sure. It's written as L_int = κ bar{psi} sigma_{mu nu} psi F^{mu nu}. So yes, four fields: ψ, ψ, F, and sigma. But sigma is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So the dimensions:

[κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + 3/2 + 3/2 +1 = [κ] +4. So the term must have dimension 4, so [κ] +4 =4 → [κ]=0.

But the options are either -1 or 1. Hmm, so I must have messed up somewhere. Let me think about the field strengths.

Wait, F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor of the gauge field. In QED, F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So each derivative ∂ has dimension 1, and A has dimension 1. So F has dimension 1 + 1 = 2? Wait, no. Wait, if A has dimension 1, then ∂μ Aν has dimension 1 +1 =2. So F^{mu nu} has dimension 2.

Wait, wait, so I think I messed that up earlier. So [F] is 2. So let's recompute.

So [ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}] = [ψ̄][σ][ψ][F] = (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) +2 = 3/2 +3/2 +2 = 3 +2=5.

Wait, so the term is κ multiplied by a quantity with dimension 5. So the entire term must have dimension 4. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]=-1.

Ah, that gives [κ]=-1, which is option A or C.

So now, the first part is [κ]=-1. So the options A and C are possibilities.

Next, determine if the theory is renormalizable. A theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive mass dimension (or zero). Because, in general, the mass dimension d of a coupling κ is determined by d=4 - (sum of fields' dimensions). For a renormalizable interaction, d >=0. So if [κ] is negative, then the interaction is non-renormalizable.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The dimension of the coupling is [κ] = (4 - sum of fields' dimensions). If [κ] is positive, the interaction is renormalizable. If [κ] is negative, it's non-renormalizable.

Wait, no, wait. The general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian with a coupling constant κ has [κ] =4 - (sum of fields in the term). If [κ] is positive or zero, the term is renormalizable. If [κ] is negative, it's non-renormalizable.

In this case, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. The fields are bar{psi} (3/2), psi (3/2), F (2). So sum is 3/2 +3/2 +2 = 3 +2 =5.

So [κ] =4 -5 = -1. Negative, so the interaction is not renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. So the coupling κ has dimension -1, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is non-renormalizable.

So putting it together: [κ] is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. So the correct option is C.

To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ is dimensionless, and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The adjoint field $\bar{\psi}$ also has $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$ (since it is derived from the gauge field $A_\mu$, which has $[A_\mu] = 1$).

### Step 2: Mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ must have mass dimension $4$ because the action $S = \int \mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} \, d^4x$ is dimensionless, and $d^4x$ has dimension $[Mass]^{-4}$. The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes to $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$, so its dimension must be $4$.

The dimension of the term is:
\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = [\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = [\kappa] + 4.
\]
Setting this equal to $4$, we solve for $[\kappa]$:
\[
[\kappa] + 4 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.

Because 3/2 + 3/2 =3.

So the term κ ψ̄ σ ψ F is κ multiplied by [ψ̄ σ ψ] [F]. [ψ̄ σ ψ] is 3, [F] is 1. So the whole term has dimension [κ] + 3 + 1 = [κ] +4.

But the Lagrangian has to have dimension 4. So [κ] +4 =4 → [κ] = 0. Wait, but wait, that's not matching any of the options. Because the options give either -1 or 1. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait no, in natural units, [d^4x] is [Energy]^-4, which is [Mass]^-4. So [Lagrangian density] must have dimension [Mass]^4 so that when multiplied by [Mass]^-4 from d^4x, the whole thing is dimensionless.

Wait, wait. Let me get this right: the action S is ∫ L d^4x. The units of S must be dimensionless. But d^4x has units of [Mass]^-4. So L must have units of [Mass]^4 to make the integral dimensionless. So each term in L must have dimension 4.

So each term in the Lagrangian must have mass dimension 4.

So let me re-calculate each part.

ψ̄ σ ψ F: each field's dimension.

ψ̄ and ψ each have dimension 3/2. So ψ̄ σ ψ has dimension 3/2 + 3/2 =3. F has dimension 1. So the product is 3 + 1=4. So the term κ times that must have dimension 4. So [κ] must be [4 - (3+1)]? Wait, no. Wait, the term is κ multiplied by (ψ̄ σ ψ F). So that term's dimension is [κ] + [ψ̄] + [σ] + [ψ] + [F]. Wait, no, because σ is made from gammas, which are dimensionless. So [ψ̄ σ ψ F] = [ψ̄][ψ][F] because [σ]=0.

Wait, no, [σ_{μν}] is dimensionless. So [ψ̄ σ_{μν} ψ F] = [ψ̄][ψ][F] = (3/2) + (3/2) +1 = 3 +1 =4.

So the entire term is κ multiplied by something that has dimension 4. So [κ] +4 =4 → [κ]=0.

Wait, but the options don't have [κ]=0 as an option. Hmm. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, wait, the Lagrangian is L_int = κ ψ̄ σ F ψ. Alternatively, maybe I have the wrong expression. Let me make sure. It's written as L_int = κ bar{psi} sigma_{mu nu} psi F^{mu nu}. So yes, four fields: ψ, ψ, F, and sigma. But sigma is a product of gamma matrices, which are dimensionless. So the dimensions:

[κ] + [ψ̄] + [ψ] + [F] = [κ] + 3/2 + 3/2 +1 = [κ] +4. So the term must have dimension 4, so [κ] +4 =4 → [κ]=0.

But the options are either -1 or 1. Hmm, so I must have messed up somewhere. Let me think about the field strengths.

Wait, F^{mu nu} is the field strength tensor of the gauge field. In QED, F is ∂μ Aν - ∂ν Aμ. So each derivative ∂ has dimension 1, and A has dimension 1. So F has dimension 1 + 1 = 2? Wait, no. Wait, if A has dimension 1, then ∂μ Aν has dimension 1 +1 =2. So F^{mu nu} has dimension 2.

Wait, wait, so I think I messed that up earlier. So [F] is 2. So let's recompute.

So [ψ̄ σ_{mu nu} ψ F^{mu nu}] = [ψ̄][σ][ψ][F] = (3/2) + 0 + (3/2) +2 = 3/2 +3/2 +2 = 3 +2=5.

Wait, so the term is κ multiplied by a quantity with dimension 5. So the entire term must have dimension 4. So [κ] +5 =4 → [κ]=-1.

Ah, that gives [κ]=-1, which is option A or C.

So now, the first part is [κ]=-1. So the options A and C are possibilities.

Next, determine if the theory is renormalizable. A theory is renormalizable if all the coupling constants have positive mass dimension (or zero). Because, in general, the mass dimension d of a coupling κ is determined by d=4 - (sum of fields' dimensions). For a renormalizable interaction, d >=0. So if [κ] is negative, then the interaction is non-renormalizable.

Wait, wait. Let me clarify. The dimension of the coupling is [κ] = (4 - sum of fields' dimensions). If [κ] is positive, the interaction is renormalizable. If [κ] is negative, it's non-renormalizable.

Wait, no, wait. The general rule is that a term in the Lagrangian with a coupling constant κ has [κ] =4 - (sum of fields in the term). If [κ] is positive or zero, the term is renormalizable. If [κ] is negative, it's non-renormalizable.

In this case, the term is κ ψ̄ σ ψ F. The fields are bar{psi} (3/2), psi (3/2), F (2). So sum is 3/2 +3/2 +2 = 3 +2 =5.

So [κ] =4 -5 = -1. Negative, so the interaction is not renormalizable.

Wait, but wait. So the coupling κ has dimension -1, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is non-renormalizable.

So putting it together: [κ] is -1, and the theory is not renormalizable. So the correct option is C.


To determine the mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$ and whether the theory is renormalizable, we analyze the given Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} = \kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu},
\]
where $\sigma_{\mu\nu} = \frac{i}{2}[\gamma_\mu, \gamma_\nu]$ is dimensionless, and $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the field strength tensor.

### Step 1: Mass dimensions of the fields
- The Dirac spinor $\psi$ has mass dimension $[\psi] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The adjoint field $\bar{\psi}$ also has $[\bar{\psi}] = \frac{3}{2}$.
- The field strength tensor $F^{\mu\nu}$ has mass dimension $[F^{\mu\nu}] = 2$ (since it is derived from the gauge field $A_\mu$, which has $[A_\mu] = 1$).

### Step 2: Mass dimension of the coupling constant $\kappa$
The Lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$ must have mass dimension $4$ because the action $S = \int \mathcal{L}_{\text{int}} \, d^4x$ is dimensionless, and $d^4x$ has dimension $[Mass]^{-4}$. The term $\kappa \bar{\psi} \sigma_{\mu\nu} \psi F^{\mu\nu}$ contributes to $\mathcal{L}_{\text{int}}$, so its dimension must be $4$.

The dimension of the term is:
\[
[\kappa] + [\bar{\psi}] + [\psi] + [F^{\mu\nu}] = [\kappa] + \frac{3}{2} + \frac{3}{2} + 2 = [\kappa] + 4.
\]
Setting this equal to $4$, we solve for $[\kappa]$:
\[
[\kappa] + 4 = 4 \implies [\kappa] = 0.
\]

### Step 3: Renormalizability of the theory
A theory is renormalizable if all coupling constants have non-negative mass dimensions. Here, $[\kappa] = -1$, which is negative. Therefore, the theory is **not renormalizable**.

### Final Answer
The mass dimension of $\kappa$ is $[\kappa]_M = -1$, and the theory is not renormalizable.
