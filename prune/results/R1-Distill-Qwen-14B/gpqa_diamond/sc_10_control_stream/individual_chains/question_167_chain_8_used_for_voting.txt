Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, let me read the problem again carefully. The state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to compute the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure, which is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the state's density matrix and tau is a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, wait, non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is. Gaussian states are those like coherent states or squeezed states, which have density matrices that are Gaussian distributions in phase space. Non-Gaussian states, like cat states, are superpositions of such states and have non-Gaussian Wigner functions.

The relative entropy method involves comparing the given state (rho) to a reference Gaussian state (tau). The non-Gaussianity is the difference in their entropies. But wait, the way it's phrased, del_b is rho's entropy minus tau's entropy. So if the state is Gaussian, rho would equal tau, and del_b would be zero. But if it's non-Gaussian, rho would differ, leading to a non-zero del_b.

But wait, another thought: does the reference Gaussian state matter here? Because the problem says "using relative entropy measure" between the given state and a reference Gaussian. However, I'm not exactly sure which Gaussian state to choose as a reference. Or maybe in this case, because the given state is a specific type of superposition, the reference might be the completely mixed Gaussian state, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reference is the maximally mixed Gaussian, or maybe the state itself is compared to a specific Gaussian like a coherent state.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the structure of the state. The state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>. Those are coherent states. So |alpha> is a coherent state with amplitude alpha, and |-alpha> is another coherent state. So when you take a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases, you get a cat state, which is known to be non-Gaussian.

But the problem is asking for the non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. So the del_b would be the entropy of the state minus the entropy of the reference Gaussian state.

Wait, but wait. Von Neumann entropy is S = -Tr(rho log rho). So if tau is a Gaussian state, and rho is the non-Gaussian state, then del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)].

But wait, the problem says "relative entropy measure" but von Neumann entropy is the entropy of a single state. Oh wait, no, relative entropy is usually between two states, but the question defines del_b as the difference between the two entropies. So perhaps this is called the "relative entropy of non-Gaussianity" or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a specific reference Gaussian state. For example, maybe the reference is the state that rho would reduce to if it were Gaussian. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state tau is the completely mixed Gaussian state. Or perhaps it's the maximally mixed state, but that's usually a completely mixed state, which is a Gaussian in the case of a single mode? Hmm.

Wait, I remember that the von Neumann entropy for a pure state is zero. So if rho is pure, then S(rho) is zero. But wait, the state given is a superposition of two coherent states, which would make it a pure state. Because |psi> is expressed in terms of |alpha> and |-alpha>, and they are orthogonal (if alpha is non-zero). Wait, wait, let me think: coherent states |alpha> and |beta> are orthogonal if alpha and beta differ by a phase and magnitude, but wait, |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal. Let me compute their inner product: <alpha | -alpha> = exp(-|alpha|² - |-alpha|²/2 + alpha*(-alpha)* something). Wait, no. The inner product between |alpha> and |-alpha> is exp(-|alpha|²) * exp(-|alpha|²/2) ? Wait, perhaps I should compute it properly.

Wait, coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. The inner product <alpha | beta> is exp( -|alpha|²/2 - |beta|²/2 + alpha* beta ). So for <alpha| -alpha>, alpha is 0.5 in this case, so |alpha|=0.5. So:

<alpha| -alpha> = exp( -(|alpha|²)/2 - |alpha|²/2 + alpha*(-alpha) )
= exp( - (0.25)/2 * 2  + (-alpha²) )
Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute each term again:

|alpha|² = (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So the first two terms in the exponent are (-0.25/2) - (0.25/2) = -0.25. The third term is alpha*(-alpha) = -alpha^2. So putting it all together:

exp( -0.25 - (alpha^2) )

Wait, alpha is 0.5, so alpha^2 is 0.25. So exponent becomes -0.25 - 0.25 = -0.5. So <alpha| -alpha> = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

Wait, but that's not zero, so |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal. Hmm, that complicates the calculation of rho.

So the state |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. With phi = -pi/4.

Let me compute cos(phi) and sin(phi) for phi = -pi/4. Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So |psi> = [ (sqrt(2)/2)|alpha> + (-sqrt(2)/2)|-alpha> ] / N.

Since the state is a superposition of two coherent states, the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. Which would be a pure state, so rho has rank 1, and its von Neumann entropy is zero. Because for a pure state, S(rho) = 0.

Wait, wait, but wait. Wait, in the problem statement, the relative entropy del_b is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. If rho is a pure state, then trace(rho ln rho) is zero (since rho is a projection operator, so only one non-zero eigenvalue, which is 1, so ln(1)=0, so the trace is zero). So if rho is pure, then the first term is zero.

But what about tau? Tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix. If tau is a mixed Gaussian state, its von Neumann entropy would be non-zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The state |psi> is a pure state, so rho is pure. So the von Neumann entropy S(rho) is zero. So then, del_b = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But del_b can't be negative because entropy is non-negative. Hmm, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says, del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So if I compute this, and rho is pure, then the first term is zero, so del_b = - S(tau). But that would mean the non-Gaussianity is negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I have the formula wrong. Alternatively, maybe the formula is the other way around: S(tau) - S(rho), but the problem says it's rho's entropy minus tau's.

Wait, but another thought. Maybe tau is the completely mixed Gaussian state. If tau is a maximally mixed Gaussian state, but wait, the maximally mixed state is a completely mixed state, which for a single mode would have entropy S(tau) = 1 (in natural units). But if rho is a pure state, then S(rho)=0, so del_b becomes -1. That can't be, because non-Gaussianity measures should be positive.

Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood the reference state tau. Maybe tau is the closest Gaussian state to rho, which would minimize the relative entropy. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The state |psi> is a superposition of coherent states, making it a non-Gaussian state. The reference state tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps a coherent state or a thermal state.

Wait, but if the state is pure, then rho is a pure state, which would have S(rho) = 0. So if tau is a Gaussian state, then S(tau) would be the entropy of the reference. So the non-Gaussianity would be 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But that can't be right because non-Gaussianity should be positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be the other way around, that is, S(tau) - S(rho). But the problem defines it as rho minus tau.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the relative entropy between rho and tau. The relative entropy D(rho||tau) is defined as Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But the problem's formula is Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau), which is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the "entropic measure" of non-Gaussianity as the difference between the state's entropy and the reference Gaussian state's entropy. So non-Gaussianity would be S(rho) - S(tau). But if rho is a pure state, S(rho)=0, so non-Gaussianity would be - S(tau), which would be negative if tau is a mixed state. That doesn't make sense, so I must have misunderstood.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is defined as the relative entropy between the state rho and the reference Gaussian state tau, which would be D(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But then that's different from what the problem states.

Wait, but the problem says del_b is Tr(rho ln rho) minus Tr(tau ln tau). So in this case, the non-Gaussianity would be S(rho) - S(tau).

So if rho is a pure state (S(rho)=0), then del_b = -S(tau). But S(tau) is positive, so del_b would be negative. That can't be right because non-Gaussianity should be a positive measure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is using the opposite definition, where the non-Gaussianity is S(tau) - S(rho), which would be positive if rho is more mixed than tau. But wait, if rho is a pure state, S(rho)=0, and S(tau) is positive, so the non-Gaussianity would be positive.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the setup again. The state |psi> is a superposition, so it's a pure state, making rho a pure state. So S(rho)=0, and tau is a Gaussian state. If tau is also pure, like a coherent state (which is a minimum uncertainty state, hence pure), then S(tau)=0, so del_b would be zero. But that can't be, because the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is a maximally mixed state. Wait, but a single-mode Gaussian state can't be maximally mixed. Wait, the maximally mixed state for a single mode would have the maximum possible entropy, but I'm not sure if that's a Gaussian state.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is the vacuum state. The vacuum state is a Gaussian state, and it's pure, so S(tau)=0. Then del_b would be 0 - 0 = 0, which again would make the non-Gaussianity zero, which is not correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing the point here. Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is not defined as zero when the state is Gaussian, but perhaps the relative entropy is being used differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the relative entropy between the state and the closest Gaussian state, which would be minimal when the state itself is Gaussian.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me try to approach this differently. The problem is asking to compute the non-Gaussianity as del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where rho is the state given, and tau is a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, but if rho is a pure state, then S(rho) = 0. So del_b = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But that would be negative. That doesn't make sense, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the definition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relative entropy in a different way. Maybe they're using the relative entropy between rho and tau, which is D(rho || tau) = S(rho) - S(rho, tau), where S(rho, tau) is the cross entropy. But the formula given doesn't match that either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement has a typo, and the correct formula is D(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau), which is the standard relative entropy. But according to the problem statement, the formula is Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau).

Wait, another thought. In quantum information theory, the relative entropy can sometimes be expressed as the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and the mutual information or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is not the standard relative entropy but another measure. Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is defined as S(tau) - S(rho), which would be positive if rho is a pure state and tau is a mixed state. But given that the problem statement defines it as the opposite, I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that del_b is calculated as S(rho) - S(tau), and evaluate that.

So, rho is a pure state, so S(rho) is zero.

So del_b = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau).

But that would give a negative value, which doesn't align with non-Gaussianity measures being positive. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong in thinking that the reference state tau is a pure state. Maybe tau is a mixed Gaussian state. For example, perhaps it's a thermal state with some temperature. Or it's a coherent state, which is pure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is the vacuum, which is a pure Gaussian state. Then, S(tau) is zero, and del_b would be zero, which would imply that the non-Gaussianity is zero, but that's not correct for a cat state.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the given parameters. Let's compute N first.

Given phi = -pi/4, alpha = 0.5.

Compute N:

N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha^2)).

sin(2*phi) = sin(2*(-pi/4)) = sin(-pi/2) = -1.

alpha^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25.

2*alpha^2 = 0.5.

exp(-2 alpha^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)*0.6065 ) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state is [ cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Which simplifies to [ (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Which is [ (|0.5> - | -0.5> ) * sqrt(2)/2 ] / 0.6275.

Wait, let me compute the normalization factor N correctly.

Wait, N = sqrt(1 + (-1)*exp(-0.5)).

Wait, 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935. So sqrt(0.3935) is approximately 0.6275.

So the state |psi> is (1/sqrt(2)) (|0.5> - | -0.5> ) / 0.6275.

Wait, because cos(-pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(-pi/4)=-sqrt(2)/2. So the coefficients are sqrt(2)/2 and -sqrt(2)/2, which sum to (|0.5> - | -0.5> ) * sqrt(2)/2.

So the state becomes (1/(0.6275)) * (|0.5> - | -0.5> ) * sqrt(2)/2.

But perhaps I should proceed to compute the density matrix rho = |psi><psi|.

But wait, perhaps I can find the Wigner function or the density matrix of the state and then compute the entropy.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to compute the entropy of a general state. Alternatively, perhaps for this specific state, the entropy can be computed analytically.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a two-mode squeezed state, but no, it's a superposition of two coherent states on the same mode.

Wait, but for a single-mode state that's a superposition of two coherent states, the Wigner function becomes non-Gaussian, and the entropy might be higher than that of a Gaussian state.

But I'm getting stuck because I don't remember the exact way to compute the von Neumann entropy for such a state. Alternatively, perhaps the state is a maximally entangled state, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but wait. Since the state is a pure state, rho is a pure state, so S(rho) = 0. So del_b would be 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But that can't be right because non-Gaussianity should be positive.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in assuming that tau is a pure Gaussian state. Let me think again. If the reference state tau is a maximally mixed Gaussian state, but wait, for a single mode, you can't have a maximally mixed Gaussian state. Because the maximum entropy for a single mode is the vacuum state, and the vacuum state is pure.

Wait, maybe the reference state is a thermal state, which is a mixed Gaussian state. The thermal state has a density matrix proportional to exp(-beta (a†a + 1/2)). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is the vacuum state, so S(tau) = 0, which would lead to del_b = 0 - 0 = 0. But that can't be correct because the state is non-Gaussian, and the non-Gaussianity should be positive.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 0. So perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero. But that's only possible if the state is Gaussian, which it's not. So that can't be the case.

Hmm, perhaps the problem's reference state tau is the same as rho when it's Gaussian. So for a Gaussian state, the non-Gaussianity would be zero, but for a non-Gaussian state, it's positive. So how can that be?

Wait, perhaps the non-Gaussianity del_b is the relative entropy between rho and the closest Gaussian state. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where tau is the state that rho would become if it were Gaussian. In that case, for a Gaussian state, tau would be rho, so del_b would be zero. For a non-Gaussian state, del_b would be positive.

But in this case, rho is a pure state, so S(rho)=0. So del_b would be 0 - S(tau). But then for a non-Gaussian state, if the closest Gaussian state has higher entropy, then 0 - S(tau) would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Another approach: perhaps the state is Gaussian after all. Let me think, is the given state a Gaussian state?

A Gaussian state is one where all the moments are Gaussian, meaning that the Wigner function is Gaussian. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions are not—except when the superposition is between two orthogonal coherent states with the same phase, which is not the case here.

Wait, no. Wait, wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. The state |alpha> is a coherent state, which is Gaussian. But a superposition of two coherent states is non-Gaussian. So the state |psi> is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be positive.

But according to the problem, the non-Gaussianity is computed as del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)]. So if rho is non-Gaussian and pure, and tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps a maximally mixed Gaussian state, but as I said, single-mode can't be maximally mixed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reference state tau is the vacuum state. So for tau, S(tau)=0.

In that case, del_b = S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - 0 = 0. But that can't be correct because the state is non-Gaussian. So perhaps the reference state is a different Gaussian state.

Alternatively, maybe the reference state is the state that would be rho if it were Gaussian. For example, the closest Gaussian state to rho. But then the non-Gaussianity would be the difference in their entropies, which may be positive.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to compute that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, assuming that the reference state is a maximally mixed state, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options. The options given are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C) 1.38, D) 0.

If the non-Gaussianity is calculated as [S(rho) - S(tau)], and rho is a pure state, then S(rho)=0. So del_b = - S(tau). But this would be negative, which isn't one of the options. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is [S(tau) - S(rho)], which would be positive if tau is more mixed than rho. But in this case, rho is pure, so S(rho)=0. So del_b = S(tau) - 0 = S(tau). So if tau is a maximally mixed Gaussian state, then S(tau) would be maximum. But what is the maximum entropy for a single-mode Gaussian state?

Wait, the maximum entropy for a single-mode Gaussian state is achieved by the vacuum state, which has entropy zero. Wait, no, the vacuum state is the pure state with minimal entropy. The maximum entropy for a single-mode Gaussian state would be when it's a completely mixed Gaussian state, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the problem again. Perhaps the problem expects me to realize that the state is a coherent state, hence Gaussian, leading to a non-Gaussianity of zero. But wait, no, the state is a superposition of two coherent states, so it's non-Gaussian.

Alternatively, perhaps the given state is actually a Gaussian state. How? Let me think again. For a single mode, a cat state is not Gaussian, but perhaps in some cases, it can be. Wait, no, I think cat states are always non-Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps for specific values of phi, the state becomes Gaussian. Let me see: when phi is zero, the state becomes |psi> = |alpha>, which is Gaussian. Similarly, when phi=pi/2, it becomes | -alpha>, which is also Gaussian. But for other values of phi, it's a superposition, hence non-Gaussian.

In our case, phi is -pi/4, which is not 0 or pi/2, so it's a non-Gaussian state.

So, if the state is non-Gaussian, then its non-Gaussianity should be positive. So the answer can't be D) 0.

But wait, the options don't include a negative value, so perhaps del_b is computed as [S(tau) - S(rho)], making the non-Gaussianity positive.

In that case, del_b = S(tau) - S(rho) = S(tau) - 0 = S(tau). So I need to find S(tau).

But what is tau? The reference Gaussian state. Perhaps it's the vacuum state, but that would lead to S(tau) = 0. So del_b would be zero, which is option D. But that contradicts our earlier conclusion that the state is non-Gaussian.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that rho is pure. Wait, let me think again. The state |psi> is a superposition, so it's a pure state. But perhaps rho is the density matrix of |psi>, which is pure, so yes, S(rho)=0.

Wait, but maybe the state |psi> is a mixed state. Let me think: is the state |psi> a pure state?

Yes, because it's expressed as a linear combination of coherent states, normalized. So the density matrix is |psi><psi|, which is a pure state, so S(rho)=0.

So, del_b is [0 - S(tau)] = - S(tau). But this is negative, which is not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is the other way around. Maybe it's [S(tau) - S(rho)]. Then del_b would be S(tau) -0 = S(tau), which is positive.

But then I need to find S(tau), the entropy of the reference Gaussian state.

But what is tau? The problem says "the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state." But which one? Without more information, perhaps it's the vacuum state, which has S(tau) = 0, leading to del_b = 0. But that can't be, because the state is non-Gaussian.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the same as the state when phi is 0. So when phi is zero, the state is |alpha>, which is Gaussian. So tau is |alpha><alpha|, which is pure, so S(tau)=0. Then del_b = 0 - 0 = 0, which is option D. But that can't be correct because the current state is a superposition, making it non-Gaussian.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the state is Gaussian despite being a superposition. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, a superposition of coherent states is non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity should be positive.

Another thought: perhaps the problem's definition of non-Gaussianity isn't using the relative entropy between rho and tau, but instead a specific measure that's known to be zero for Gaussian states and positive otherwise.

But I'm stuck. Let me try to think of what the answer might be. The options are A: 2.48, B:0.25, C:1.38, D:0.

I recall that the von Neumann entropy of a coherent state is zero because it's a pure state. So if the reference state is a coherent state, then S(tau)=0. So del_b = 0 - 0 =0, which would be option D. But that would mean the state is Gaussian, which it's not.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is a different Gaussian state, perhaps a thermal state with higher entropy. But I don't have enough information to compute S(tau).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting an answer based on the assumption that the non-Gaussianity is zero, which is option D. But that would be incorrect for a cat state.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the phase space distribution approach. The relative entropy between the Wigner function of rho and the closest Gaussian Wigner function. But again, without knowing the exact way to compute it, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is being computed using the logarithmic negativity or another measure, but the problem states that the relative entropy measure is being used.

Another approach: perhaps the state is actually Gaussian despite being written as a superposition. Let me check.

Wait, no. The state is a superposition of two coherent states, which is non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity should be positive, ruling out option D.

But among the options, I'm not sure how to compute the correct value. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem's relative entropy is not the von Neumann entropy but the classical relative entropy, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the purity of the state and compare it to the purity of a Gaussian state. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the relative entropy between the given state and a reference Gaussian state, but without knowing which Gaussian state, I can't proceed.

Wait, maybe the reference state is the mixed state resulting from the state when the phase phi is averaged out. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the non-Gaussianity using the formula for a cat state, which I recall has a certain expression.

Wait, I remember that the non-Gaussianity of a cat state can be quantified using the Hilbert-Schmidt distance to the nearest Gaussian state, but the problem uses relative entropy.

Alternatively, perhaps for the given state, the non-Gaussianity can be computed using the formula involving the logarithm of the overlap with a coherent state.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the parameters again.

phi is -pi/4, so the coefficients are cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2.

So the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, each multiplied by sqrt(2)/2.

The normalization factor N is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)).

With phi = -pi/4, sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1.

alpha = 0.5, so 2 alpha^2 = 0.5.

So N = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.6065) ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state is (sqrt(2)/2 (|0.5> - |-0.5>) ) / 0.6275.

Which simplifies to (|0.5> - |-0.5>) * sqrt(2)/(2 * 0.6275).

But I'm not sure how this helps me compute the non-Gaussianity.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the relative entropy between rho and a Gaussian state can be computed using the formula involving the Wigner function. The relative entropy would be the integral of rho's Wigner function multiplied by ln(rho's Wigner) minus the same for the Gaussian state.

But I'm not sure how to compute this without knowing the specific form of the Wigner functions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the density matrix of a Gaussian state can be written in terms of first and second moments, and the relative entropy can be simplified.

But I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should look for another angle.

Wait, perhaps the state is a pure state, so rho is pure, which implies that S(rho)=0. But if the reference Gaussian state tau is also pure, then S(tau)=0, so del_b=0. But that would mean the non-Gaussianity is zero, which is option D. But that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is a maximally mixed state, but that's not a Gaussian state.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is D) 0, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the state is actually Gaussian. For example, if the state can be rewritten as a Gaussian state, then the non-Gaussianity would be zero.

But how? A superposition of two coherent states is generally non-Gaussian, unless it's a specific case. But with phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5, I don't think it's Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps when alpha is zero, the state becomes a superposition of |0> and |0>, which is just |0>, Gaussian. But that's not the case here.

Hmm. Maybe I should give up and try to look for another way. Wait, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is Gaussian. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the state is Gaussian. Let me think: a cat state is non-Gaussian, but perhaps under certain conditions, the state becomes Gaussian. Maybe when phi is 0 or pi/2, but not otherwise.

In this case, phi is -pi/4, which is not 0 or pi/2, so the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity is positive, not zero.

But the only option that's positive is A, B, C. But without being able to compute the exact value, I can't choose between them.

Wait, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is calculated to be zero because the state is actually Gaussian. How?

Wait, no. A coherent state superposition is non-Gaussian. So I'm back to square one.

Perhaps the correct answer is D) 0, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute del_b as zero because the state is Gaussian.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the state is the same as a squeezed state, which is Gaussian. But a cat state is not a squeezed state; it's a superposition of coherent states.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. I think I'll have to go with the fact that the state is non-Gaussian and the non-Gaussianity is positive, but I don't know which option to choose. But looking at the options, option C is 1.38.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D) 0 because the state is Gaussian. But I don't think that's correct.

Wait, I'm going to make a guess here. Since the problem states to compute the non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy, and the state is non-Gaussian, the non-Gaussianity should be positive. So the correct answer is either A, B, or C. But without knowing how to compute it, I can't be sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D) 0, but I don't think so.

Wait, wait, perhaps the state is actually a pure Gaussian state, making del_b zero. How?

Alternatively, perhaps the state is expressed as a Gaussian state in some other basis. But I don't see how that would be the case.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the fact that the state is a coherent state, but no, it's a superposition. So no.

Well, given that I can't compute the exact value, I'll have to make an educated guess. The options are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C) 1.38, D) 0.

I think the correct answer is C) 1.38. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D) 0, but I'm not confident.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \( N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi) \exp(-2\alpha^2)} \), and the parameters are \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\). The non-Gaussianity is defined as:

\[
\Delta_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the given non-Gaussian state, and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

### Key Observations:
1. **State Properties**: The given state is a superposition of two coherent states \(|\alpha\rangle\) and \(|-\alpha\rangle\), which makes it a non-Gaussian state. Non-Gaussian states are known to have non-Gaussian Wigner functions and are distinguishable from Gaussian states (e.g., coherent, thermal, or squeezed states).

2. **Relative Entropy Formula**: The formula \(\Delta_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau)\) suggests that the non-Gaussianity is the difference in von Neumann entropies between the non-Gaussian state \(\rho\) and the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\). For a pure state, the von Neumann entropy \(S(\rho) = 0\), so \(\Delta_b = -S(\tau)\). However, this would yield a negative value, which is inconsistent with the definition of non-Gaussianity as a positive measure. This implies that the formula might effectively compute \(S(\tau) - S(\rho)\), ensuring a positive result.

3. **Reference Gaussian State**: The problem does not explicitly specify the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\). A plausible assumption is that \(\tau\) is the vacuum state, which is a pure Gaussian state with \(S(\tau) = 0\). If this is the case, \(\Delta_b = 0 - 0 = 0\), which would suggest the state is Gaussian. However, this contradicts the fact that the given state is a superposition of coherent states and is non-Gaussian.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (2.48)**: This value is positive and could represent the non-Gaussianity if the relative entropy computation yields a positive result for a non-Gaussian state.
   - **Option B (0.25)**: A small positive value, which might correspond to a weakly non-Gaussian state.
   - **Option C (1.38)**: Another plausible positive value for a non-Gaussian state.
   - **Option D (0)**: This would imply the state is Gaussian, which is inconsistent with the given superposition of coherent states.

### Conclusion:
The state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be positive. Among the options, the most reasonable choice is **C (1.38)**, as it aligns with the expectation that the non-Gaussianity is positive for a cat state. However, the exact computation of \(\Delta_b\) is not explicitly performed in the reasoning, and the choice is based on elimination and plausible assumptions.

Answer: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about calculating the non-Gaussianity of a Schrödinger cat state using relative entropy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, let me read the problem again carefully. The state is given as |psi> = [cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha>]/N. The normalization constant N is sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha²)). The parameters given are phi = -pi/4 and alpha = 0.5. I need to compute the non-Gaussianity (nG) using the relative entropy measure, which is del_b = trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau), where rho is the state's density matrix and tau is a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, wait, non-Gaussianity measures how non-Gaussian a state is. Gaussian states are those like coherent states or squeezed states, which have density matrices that are Gaussian distributions in phase space. Non-Gaussian states, like cat states, are superpositions of such states and have non-Gaussian Wigner functions.

The relative entropy method involves comparing the given state (rho) to a reference Gaussian state (tau). The non-Gaussianity is the difference in their entropies. But wait, the way it's phrased, del_b is rho's entropy minus tau's entropy. So if the state is Gaussian, rho would equal tau, and del_b would be zero. But if it's non-Gaussian, rho would differ, leading to a non-zero del_b.

But wait, another thought: does the reference Gaussian state matter here? Because the problem says "using relative entropy measure" between the given state and a reference Gaussian. However, I'm not exactly sure which Gaussian state to choose as a reference. Or maybe in this case, because the given state is a specific type of superposition, the reference might be the completely mixed Gaussian state, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the reference is the maximally mixed Gaussian, or maybe the state itself is compared to a specific Gaussian like a coherent state.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the structure of the state. The state |psi> is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>. Those are coherent states. So |alpha> is a coherent state with amplitude alpha, and |-alpha> is another coherent state. So when you take a superposition of two coherent states with opposite phases, you get a cat state, which is known to be non-Gaussian.

But the problem is asking for the non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy measure. The formula given is del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where S is the von Neumann entropy. So the del_b would be the entropy of the state minus the entropy of the reference Gaussian state.

Wait, but wait. Von Neumann entropy is S = -Tr(rho log rho). So if tau is a Gaussian state, and rho is the non-Gaussian state, then del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)].

But wait, the problem says "relative entropy measure" but von Neumann entropy is the entropy of a single state. Oh wait, no, relative entropy is usually between two states, but the question defines del_b as the difference between the two entropies. So perhaps this is called the "relative entropy of non-Gaussianity" or something similar.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a specific reference Gaussian state. For example, maybe the reference is the state that rho would reduce to if it were Gaussian. But I'm not exactly sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state tau is the completely mixed Gaussian state. Or perhaps it's the maximally mixed state, but that's usually a completely mixed state, which is a Gaussian in the case of a single mode? Hmm.

Wait, I remember that the von Neumann entropy for a pure state is zero. So if rho is pure, then S(rho) is zero. But wait, the state given is a superposition of two coherent states, which would make it a pure state. Because |psi> is expressed in terms of |alpha> and |-alpha>, and they are orthogonal (if alpha is non-zero). Wait, wait, let me think: coherent states |alpha> and |beta> are orthogonal if alpha and beta differ by a phase and magnitude, but wait, |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal. Let me compute their inner product: <alpha | -alpha> = exp(-|alpha|² - |-alpha|²/2 + alpha*(-alpha)* something). Wait, no. The inner product between |alpha> and |-alpha> is exp(-|alpha|²) * exp(-|alpha|²/2) ? Wait, perhaps I should compute it properly.

Wait, coherent states are eigenstates of the annihilation operator. The inner product <alpha | beta> is exp( -|alpha|²/2 - |beta|²/2 + alpha* beta ). So for <alpha| -alpha>, alpha is 0.5 in this case, so |alpha|=0.5. So:

<alpha| -alpha> = exp( -(|alpha|²)/2 - |alpha|²/2 + alpha*(-alpha) )
= exp( - (0.25)/2 * 2  + (-alpha²) )
Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute each term again:

|alpha|² = (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So the first two terms in the exponent are (-0.25/2) - (0.25/2) = -0.25. The third term is alpha*(-alpha) = -alpha^2. So putting it all together:

exp( -0.25 - (alpha^2) )

Wait, alpha is 0.5, so alpha^2 is 0.25. So exponent becomes -0.25 - 0.25 = -0.5. So <alpha| -alpha> = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

Wait, but that's not zero, so |alpha> and |-alpha> are not orthogonal. Hmm, that complicates the calculation of rho.

So the state |psi> is (cos(phi)|alpha> + sin(phi)|-alpha> ) / N. With phi = -pi/4.

Let me compute cos(phi) and sin(phi) for phi = -pi/4. Cos(-pi/4) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. Sin(-pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2 ≈ -0.7071.

So |psi> = [ (sqrt(2)/2)|alpha> + (-sqrt(2)/2)|-alpha> ] / N.

Since the state is a superposition of two coherent states, the density matrix rho is |psi><psi|. Which would be a pure state, so rho has rank 1, and its von Neumann entropy is zero. Because for a pure state, S(rho) = 0.

Wait, wait, but wait. Wait, in the problem statement, the relative entropy del_b is [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. If rho is a pure state, then trace(rho ln rho) is zero (since rho is a projection operator, so only one non-zero eigenvalue, which is 1, so ln(1)=0, so the trace is zero). So if rho is pure, then the first term is zero.

But what about tau? Tau is the reference Gaussian state's density matrix. If tau is a mixed Gaussian state, its von Neumann entropy would be non-zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The state |psi> is a pure state, so rho is pure. So the von Neumann entropy S(rho) is zero. So then, del_b = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But del_b can't be negative because entropy is non-negative. Hmm, that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me check the problem statement again.

The problem says, del_b = [trace(rho ln rho) - trace(tau ln tau)]. So if I compute this, and rho is pure, then the first term is zero, so del_b = - S(tau). But that would mean the non-Gaussianity is negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I have the formula wrong. Alternatively, maybe the formula is the other way around: S(tau) - S(rho), but the problem says it's rho's entropy minus tau's.

Wait, but another thought. Maybe tau is the completely mixed Gaussian state. If tau is a maximally mixed Gaussian state, but wait, the maximally mixed state is a completely mixed state, which for a single mode would have entropy S(tau) = 1 (in natural units). But if rho is a pure state, then S(rho)=0, so del_b becomes -1. That can't be, because non-Gaussianity measures should be positive.

Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood the reference state tau. Maybe tau is the closest Gaussian state to rho, which would minimize the relative entropy. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The state |psi> is a superposition of coherent states, making it a non-Gaussian state. The reference state tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps a coherent state or a thermal state.

Wait, but if the state is pure, then rho is a pure state, which would have S(rho) = 0. So if tau is a Gaussian state, then S(tau) would be the entropy of the reference. So the non-Gaussianity would be 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But that can't be right because non-Gaussianity should be positive.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be the other way around, that is, S(tau) - S(rho). But the problem defines it as rho minus tau.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think of the relative entropy between rho and tau. The relative entropy D(rho||tau) is defined as Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But the problem's formula is Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau), which is different.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the "entropic measure" of non-Gaussianity as the difference between the state's entropy and the reference Gaussian state's entropy. So non-Gaussianity would be S(rho) - S(tau). But if rho is a pure state, S(rho)=0, so non-Gaussianity would be - S(tau), which would be negative if tau is a mixed state. That doesn't make sense, so I must have misunderstood.

Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is defined as the relative entropy between the state rho and the reference Gaussian state tau, which would be D(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau). But then that's different from what the problem states.

Wait, but the problem says del_b is Tr(rho ln rho) minus Tr(tau ln tau). So in this case, the non-Gaussianity would be S(rho) - S(tau).

So if rho is a pure state (S(rho)=0), then del_b = -S(tau). But S(tau) is positive, so del_b would be negative. That can't be right because non-Gaussianity should be a positive measure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Maybe the problem is using the opposite definition, where the non-Gaussianity is S(tau) - S(rho), which would be positive if rho is more mixed than tau. But wait, if rho is a pure state, S(rho)=0, and S(tau) is positive, so the non-Gaussianity would be positive.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about the setup again. The state |psi> is a superposition, so it's a pure state, making rho a pure state. So S(rho)=0, and tau is a Gaussian state. If tau is also pure, like a coherent state (which is a minimum uncertainty state, hence pure), then S(tau)=0, so del_b would be zero. But that can't be, because the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be non-zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is a maximally mixed state. Wait, but a single-mode Gaussian state can't be maximally mixed. Wait, the maximally mixed state for a single mode would have the maximum possible entropy, but I'm not sure if that's a Gaussian state.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is the vacuum state. The vacuum state is a Gaussian state, and it's pure, so S(tau)=0. Then del_b would be 0 - 0 = 0, which again would make the non-Gaussianity zero, which is not correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing the point here. Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is not defined as zero when the state is Gaussian, but perhaps the relative entropy is being used differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to the relative entropy between the state and the closest Gaussian state, which would be minimal when the state itself is Gaussian.

Wait, but I'm not making progress. Let me try to approach this differently. The problem is asking to compute the non-Gaussianity as del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where rho is the state given, and tau is a reference Gaussian state.

Wait, but if rho is a pure state, then S(rho) = 0. So del_b = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But that would be negative. That doesn't make sense, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the definition.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the relative entropy in a different way. Maybe they're using the relative entropy between rho and tau, which is D(rho || tau) = S(rho) - S(rho, tau), where S(rho, tau) is the cross entropy. But the formula given doesn't match that either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement has a typo, and the correct formula is D(rho || tau) = Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(rho ln tau), which is the standard relative entropy. But according to the problem statement, the formula is Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau).

Wait, another thought. In quantum information theory, the relative entropy can sometimes be expressed as the difference between the von Neumann entropy of rho and the mutual information or something else. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is not the standard relative entropy but another measure. Alternatively, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is defined as S(tau) - S(rho), which would be positive if rho is a pure state and tau is a mixed state. But given that the problem statement defines it as the opposite, I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that del_b is calculated as S(rho) - S(tau), and evaluate that.

So, rho is a pure state, so S(rho) is zero.

So del_b = 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau).

But that would give a negative value, which doesn't align with non-Gaussianity measures being positive. So perhaps I'm making a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong in thinking that the reference state tau is a pure state. Maybe tau is a mixed Gaussian state. For example, perhaps it's a thermal state with some temperature. Or it's a coherent state, which is pure. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is the vacuum, which is a pure Gaussian state. Then, S(tau) is zero, and del_b would be zero, which would imply that the non-Gaussianity is zero, but that's not correct for a cat state.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way. Let me think about the given parameters. Let's compute N first.

Given phi = -pi/4, alpha = 0.5.

Compute N:

N = sqrt(1 + sin(2*phi) * exp(-2*alpha^2)).

sin(2*phi) = sin(2*(-pi/4)) = sin(-pi/2) = -1.

alpha^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25.

2*alpha^2 = 0.5.

exp(-2 alpha^2) = exp(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065.

So N = sqrt(1 + (-1)*0.6065 ) = sqrt(1 - 0.6065) = sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state is [ cos(-pi/4)|0.5> + sin(-pi/4)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Which simplifies to [ (sqrt(2)/2)|0.5> - (sqrt(2)/2)|-0.5> ] / 0.6275.

Which is [ (|0.5> - | -0.5> ) * sqrt(2)/2 ] / 0.6275.

Wait, let me compute the normalization factor N correctly.

Wait, N = sqrt(1 + (-1)*exp(-0.5)).

Wait, 1 - exp(-0.5) ≈ 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935. So sqrt(0.3935) is approximately 0.6275.

So the state |psi> is (1/sqrt(2)) (|0.5> - | -0.5> ) / 0.6275.

Wait, because cos(-pi/4)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(-pi/4)=-sqrt(2)/2. So the coefficients are sqrt(2)/2 and -sqrt(2)/2, which sum to (|0.5> - | -0.5> ) * sqrt(2)/2.

So the state becomes (1/(0.6275)) * (|0.5> - | -0.5> ) * sqrt(2)/2.

But perhaps I should proceed to compute the density matrix rho = |psi><psi|.

But wait, perhaps I can find the Wigner function or the density matrix of the state and then compute the entropy.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to compute the entropy of a general state. Alternatively, perhaps for this specific state, the entropy can be computed analytically.

Alternatively, perhaps the state is a two-mode squeezed state, but no, it's a superposition of two coherent states on the same mode.

Wait, but for a single-mode state that's a superposition of two coherent states, the Wigner function becomes non-Gaussian, and the entropy might be higher than that of a Gaussian state.

But I'm getting stuck because I don't remember the exact way to compute the von Neumann entropy for such a state. Alternatively, perhaps the state is a maximally entangled state, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but wait. Since the state is a pure state, rho is a pure state, so S(rho) = 0. So del_b would be 0 - S(tau) = - S(tau). But that can't be right because non-Gaussianity should be positive.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in assuming that tau is a pure Gaussian state. Let me think again. If the reference state tau is a maximally mixed Gaussian state, but wait, for a single mode, you can't have a maximally mixed Gaussian state. Because the maximum entropy for a single mode is the vacuum state, and the vacuum state is pure.

Wait, maybe the reference state is a thermal state, which is a mixed Gaussian state. The thermal state has a density matrix proportional to exp(-beta (a†a + 1/2)). But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is the vacuum state, so S(tau) = 0, which would lead to del_b = 0 - 0 = 0. But that can't be correct because the state is non-Gaussian, and the non-Gaussianity should be positive.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 0. So perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero. But that's only possible if the state is Gaussian, which it's not. So that can't be the case.

Hmm, perhaps the problem's reference state tau is the same as rho when it's Gaussian. So for a Gaussian state, the non-Gaussianity would be zero, but for a non-Gaussian state, it's positive. So how can that be?

Wait, perhaps the non-Gaussianity del_b is the relative entropy between rho and the closest Gaussian state. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula del_b = S(rho) - S(tau), where tau is the state that rho would become if it were Gaussian. In that case, for a Gaussian state, tau would be rho, so del_b would be zero. For a non-Gaussian state, del_b would be positive.

But in this case, rho is a pure state, so S(rho)=0. So del_b would be 0 - S(tau). But then for a non-Gaussian state, if the closest Gaussian state has higher entropy, then 0 - S(tau) would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Another approach: perhaps the state is Gaussian after all. Let me think, is the given state a Gaussian state?

A Gaussian state is one where all the moments are Gaussian, meaning that the Wigner function is Gaussian. Coherent states are Gaussian, but their superpositions are not—except when the superposition is between two orthogonal coherent states with the same phase, which is not the case here.

Wait, no. Wait, wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. The state |alpha> is a coherent state, which is Gaussian. But a superposition of two coherent states is non-Gaussian. So the state |psi> is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be positive.

But according to the problem, the non-Gaussianity is computed as del_b = [Tr(rho ln rho) - Tr(tau ln tau)]. So if rho is non-Gaussian and pure, and tau is a Gaussian state, perhaps a maximally mixed Gaussian state, but as I said, single-mode can't be maximally mixed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the reference state tau is the vacuum state. So for tau, S(tau)=0.

In that case, del_b = S(rho) - S(tau) = 0 - 0 = 0. But that can't be correct because the state is non-Gaussian. So perhaps the reference state is a different Gaussian state.

Alternatively, maybe the reference state is the state that would be rho if it were Gaussian. For example, the closest Gaussian state to rho. But then the non-Gaussianity would be the difference in their entropies, which may be positive.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to compute that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simplified, assuming that the reference state is a maximally mixed state, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options. The options given are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C) 1.38, D) 0.

If the non-Gaussianity is calculated as [S(rho) - S(tau)], and rho is a pure state, then S(rho)=0. So del_b = - S(tau). But this would be negative, which isn't one of the options. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is [S(tau) - S(rho)], which would be positive if tau is more mixed than rho. But in this case, rho is pure, so S(rho)=0. So del_b = S(tau) - 0 = S(tau). So if tau is a maximally mixed Gaussian state, then S(tau) would be maximum. But what is the maximum entropy for a single-mode Gaussian state?

Wait, the maximum entropy for a single-mode Gaussian state is achieved by the vacuum state, which has entropy zero. Wait, no, the vacuum state is the pure state with minimal entropy. The maximum entropy for a single-mode Gaussian state would be when it's a completely mixed Gaussian state, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the problem again. Perhaps the problem expects me to realize that the state is a coherent state, hence Gaussian, leading to a non-Gaussianity of zero. But wait, no, the state is a superposition of two coherent states, so it's non-Gaussian.

Alternatively, perhaps the given state is actually a Gaussian state. How? Let me think again. For a single mode, a cat state is not Gaussian, but perhaps in some cases, it can be. Wait, no, I think cat states are always non-Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps for specific values of phi, the state becomes Gaussian. Let me see: when phi is zero, the state becomes |psi> = |alpha>, which is Gaussian. Similarly, when phi=pi/2, it becomes | -alpha>, which is also Gaussian. But for other values of phi, it's a superposition, hence non-Gaussian.

In our case, phi is -pi/4, which is not 0 or pi/2, so it's a non-Gaussian state.

So, if the state is non-Gaussian, then its non-Gaussianity should be positive. So the answer can't be D) 0.

But wait, the options don't include a negative value, so perhaps del_b is computed as [S(tau) - S(rho)], making the non-Gaussianity positive.

In that case, del_b = S(tau) - S(rho) = S(tau) - 0 = S(tau). So I need to find S(tau).

But what is tau? The reference Gaussian state. Perhaps it's the vacuum state, but that would lead to S(tau) = 0. So del_b would be zero, which is option D. But that contradicts our earlier conclusion that the state is non-Gaussian.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that rho is pure. Wait, let me think again. The state |psi> is a superposition, so it's a pure state. But perhaps rho is the density matrix of |psi>, which is pure, so yes, S(rho)=0.

Wait, but maybe the state |psi> is a mixed state. Let me think: is the state |psi> a pure state?

Yes, because it's expressed as a linear combination of coherent states, normalized. So the density matrix is |psi><psi|, which is a pure state, so S(rho)=0.

So, del_b is [0 - S(tau)] = - S(tau). But this is negative, which is not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is the other way around. Maybe it's [S(tau) - S(rho)]. Then del_b would be S(tau) -0 = S(tau), which is positive.

But then I need to find S(tau), the entropy of the reference Gaussian state.

But what is tau? The problem says "the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state." But which one? Without more information, perhaps it's the vacuum state, which has S(tau) = 0, leading to del_b = 0. But that can't be, because the state is non-Gaussian.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference Gaussian state is the same as the state when phi is 0. So when phi is zero, the state is |alpha>, which is Gaussian. So tau is |alpha><alpha|, which is pure, so S(tau)=0. Then del_b = 0 - 0 = 0, which is option D. But that can't be correct because the current state is a superposition, making it non-Gaussian.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting me to recognize that the state is Gaussian despite being a superposition. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, a superposition of coherent states is non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity should be positive.

Another thought: perhaps the problem's definition of non-Gaussianity isn't using the relative entropy between rho and tau, but instead a specific measure that's known to be zero for Gaussian states and positive otherwise.

But I'm stuck. Let me try to think of what the answer might be. The options are A: 2.48, B:0.25, C:1.38, D:0.

I recall that the von Neumann entropy of a coherent state is zero because it's a pure state. So if the reference state is a coherent state, then S(tau)=0. So del_b = 0 - 0 =0, which would be option D. But that would mean the state is Gaussian, which it's not.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is a different Gaussian state, perhaps a thermal state with higher entropy. But I don't have enough information to compute S(tau).

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting an answer based on the assumption that the non-Gaussianity is zero, which is option D. But that would be incorrect for a cat state.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the phase space distribution approach. The relative entropy between the Wigner function of rho and the closest Gaussian Wigner function. But again, without knowing the exact way to compute it, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is being computed using the logarithmic negativity or another measure, but the problem states that the relative entropy measure is being used.

Another approach: perhaps the state is actually Gaussian despite being written as a superposition. Let me check.

Wait, no. The state is a superposition of two coherent states, which is non-Gaussian. So the non-Gaussianity should be positive, ruling out option D.

But among the options, I'm not sure how to compute the correct value. Perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem's relative entropy is not the von Neumann entropy but the classical relative entropy, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the purity of the state and compare it to the purity of a Gaussian state. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the relative entropy between the given state and a reference Gaussian state, but without knowing which Gaussian state, I can't proceed.

Wait, maybe the reference state is the mixed state resulting from the state when the phase phi is averaged out. But that's a stretch.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting me to compute the non-Gaussianity using the formula for a cat state, which I recall has a certain expression.

Wait, I remember that the non-Gaussianity of a cat state can be quantified using the Hilbert-Schmidt distance to the nearest Gaussian state, but the problem uses relative entropy.

Alternatively, perhaps for the given state, the non-Gaussianity can be computed using the formula involving the logarithm of the overlap with a coherent state.

But I'm not making progress. Let me think about the parameters again.

phi is -pi/4, so the coefficients are cos(phi) = sqrt(2)/2, sin(phi) = -sqrt(2)/2.

So the state is a superposition of |alpha> and |-alpha>, each multiplied by sqrt(2)/2.

The normalization factor N is sqrt(1 + sin(2 phi) exp(-2 alpha^2)).

With phi = -pi/4, sin(2 phi) = sin(-pi/2) = -1.

alpha = 0.5, so 2 alpha^2 = 0.5.

So N = sqrt(1 - exp(-0.5)) ≈ sqrt(1 - 0.6065) ≈ sqrt(0.3935) ≈ 0.6275.

So the state is (sqrt(2)/2 (|0.5> - |-0.5>) ) / 0.6275.

Which simplifies to (|0.5> - |-0.5>) * sqrt(2)/(2 * 0.6275).

But I'm not sure how this helps me compute the non-Gaussianity.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the relative entropy between rho and a Gaussian state can be computed using the formula involving the Wigner function. The relative entropy would be the integral of rho's Wigner function multiplied by ln(rho's Wigner) minus the same for the Gaussian state.

But I'm not sure how to compute this without knowing the specific form of the Wigner functions.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the fact that the density matrix of a Gaussian state can be written in terms of first and second moments, and the relative entropy can be simplified.

But I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should look for another angle.

Wait, perhaps the state is a pure state, so rho is pure, which implies that S(rho)=0. But if the reference Gaussian state tau is also pure, then S(tau)=0, so del_b=0. But that would mean the non-Gaussianity is zero, which is option D. But that can't be right because the state is non-Gaussian.

Alternatively, perhaps the reference state is a maximally mixed state, but that's not a Gaussian state.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Given the options, perhaps the correct answer is D) 0, but I'm not confident.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the state is actually Gaussian. For example, if the state can be rewritten as a Gaussian state, then the non-Gaussianity would be zero.

But how? A superposition of two coherent states is generally non-Gaussian, unless it's a specific case. But with phi=-pi/4 and alpha=0.5, I don't think it's Gaussian.

Wait, perhaps when alpha is zero, the state becomes a superposition of |0> and |0>, which is just |0>, Gaussian. But that's not the case here.

Hmm. Maybe I should give up and try to look for another way. Wait, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is zero because the state is Gaussian. But I don't think that's the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the state is Gaussian. Let me think: a cat state is non-Gaussian, but perhaps under certain conditions, the state becomes Gaussian. Maybe when phi is 0 or pi/2, but not otherwise.

In this case, phi is -pi/4, which is not 0 or pi/2, so the state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity is positive, not zero.

But the only option that's positive is A, B, C. But without being able to compute the exact value, I can't choose between them.

Wait, perhaps the non-Gaussianity is calculated to be zero because the state is actually Gaussian. How?

Wait, no. A coherent state superposition is non-Gaussian. So I'm back to square one.

Perhaps the correct answer is D) 0, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute del_b as zero because the state is Gaussian.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the state is the same as a squeezed state, which is Gaussian. But a cat state is not a squeezed state; it's a superposition of coherent states.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. I think I'll have to go with the fact that the state is non-Gaussian and the non-Gaussianity is positive, but I don't know which option to choose. But looking at the options, option C is 1.38.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D) 0 because the state is Gaussian. But I don't think that's correct.

Wait, I'm going to make a guess here. Since the problem states to compute the non-Gaussianity using the relative entropy, and the state is non-Gaussian, the non-Gaussianity should be positive. So the correct answer is either A, B, or C. But without knowing how to compute it, I can't be sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D) 0, but I don't think so.

Wait, wait, perhaps the state is actually a pure Gaussian state, making del_b zero. How?

Alternatively, perhaps the state is expressed as a Gaussian state in some other basis. But I don't see how that would be the case.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is using the fact that the state is a coherent state, but no, it's a superposition. So no.

Well, given that I can't compute the exact value, I'll have to make an educated guess. The options are A) 2.48, B) 0.25, C) 1.38, D) 0.

I think the correct answer is C) 1.38. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D) 0, but I'm not confident.


The problem involves calculating the non-Gaussianity (nG) of a Schrödinger cat state using the relative entropy measure. The state is defined as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \frac{\cos(\phi)|\alpha\rangle + \sin(\phi)|-\alpha\rangle}{N},
\]
where \( N = \sqrt{1 + \sin(2\phi) \exp(-2\alpha^2)} \), and the parameters are \(\phi = -\pi/4\) and \(\alpha = 0.5\). The non-Gaussianity is defined as:

\[
\Delta_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau),
\]
where \(\rho\) is the density matrix of the given non-Gaussian state, and \(\tau\) is the density matrix of a reference Gaussian state.

### Key Observations:
1. **State Properties**: The given state is a superposition of two coherent states \(|\alpha\rangle\) and \(|-\alpha\rangle\), which makes it a non-Gaussian state. Non-Gaussian states are known to have non-Gaussian Wigner functions and are distinguishable from Gaussian states (e.g., coherent, thermal, or squeezed states).

2. **Relative Entropy Formula**: The formula \(\Delta_b = \text{Tr}(\rho \ln \rho) - \text{Tr}(\tau \ln \tau)\) suggests that the non-Gaussianity is the difference in von Neumann entropies between the non-Gaussian state \(\rho\) and the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\). For a pure state, the von Neumann entropy \(S(\rho) = 0\), so \(\Delta_b = -S(\tau)\). However, this would yield a negative value, which is inconsistent with the definition of non-Gaussianity as a positive measure. This implies that the formula might effectively compute \(S(\tau) - S(\rho)\), ensuring a positive result.

3. **Reference Gaussian State**: The problem does not explicitly specify the reference Gaussian state \(\tau\). A plausible assumption is that \(\tau\) is the vacuum state, which is a pure Gaussian state with \(S(\tau) = 0\). If this is the case, \(\Delta_b = 0 - 0 = 0\), which would suggest the state is Gaussian. However, this contradicts the fact that the given state is a superposition of coherent states and is non-Gaussian.

4. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option A (2.48)**: This value is positive and could represent the non-Gaussianity if the relative entropy computation yields a positive result for a non-Gaussian state.
   - **Option B (0.25)**: A small positive value, which might correspond to a weakly non-Gaussian state.
   - **Option C (1.38)**: Another plausible positive value for a non-Gaussian state.
   - **Option D (0)**: This would imply the state is Gaussian, which is inconsistent with the given superposition of coherent states.

### Conclusion:
The state is non-Gaussian, so the non-Gaussianity should be positive. Among the options, the most reasonable choice is **C (1.38)**, as it aligns with the expectation that the non-Gaussianity is positive for a cat state. However, the exact computation of \(\Delta_b\) is not explicitly performed in the reasoning, and the choice is based on elimination and plausible assumptions.
