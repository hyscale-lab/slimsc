Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the hydrogen atom. Hmm, the question is about the decay of a specific state and the transition probabilities. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The state in question is |3,0,0⟩. I remember that in hydrogen atom notation, the first number is n (the principal quantum number), the second is l (the azimuthal or angular momentum), and the third is m (the magnetic quantum number). So here, n=3, l=0, m=0. That means it's a 3s orbital, right?

The decay is to |1,0,0⟩, which is 1s. So, the electron is transitioning from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting some photons. The process involves two dipole transitions. Dipole transitions are electric dipole, I think, which have certain selection rules.

I remember the selection rules for electric dipole transitions. For hydrogen, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh wait, but wait, there's another rule: Δn can be any integer except zero, but for hydrogen, since it's a one-electron atom, these selection rules hold.

So first, from n=3, l=0 to... Well, the first transition must go to a state where l increases by 1 because l was 0, so it must go to l=1. Because Δl can be +1 or -1. But since l can't be negative (it's 0 in the initial state), the only option is l=+1.

So the first transition is from |3,0,0⟩ to a state with n' = ?, l=1, m= ?

Wait, but wait. When you have a transition, the n can change as long as it's allowed by the selection rules, but for hydrogen, the specific transition is determined by the dipole matrix elements. But perhaps I should think about the possible intermediate states.

Wait, the problem says it's a two-step dipole transition. So first, |3,0,0⟩ → some state |n', l', m'⟩ via dipole, then from there to |1,0,0⟩ via another dipole transition.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and the final is |1,0,0⟩. Let's think about the two steps.

First transition: from n=3, l=0 to some intermediate state.

The selection rules say Δl = ±1, so from l=0, it can only go to l=1. Because if l were to go to -1, which isn't possible, so only l=1.

So the intermediate state must have l=1. So options for the first step are |n',1,m'⟩ where n' is either 2 or 4? Because n can increase or decrease.

Wait, but the second transition has to get to |1,0,0⟩. So the second step must have the intermediate state decay into n=1, l=0.

So the intermediate state must have l=1. So, for the second step, from |n',1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

Now, applying the selection rules again. From l=1, the next l must be l=0 (since Δl can be ±1). So that fits because the final state is l=0.

So for the second transition, l goes from 1 to 0.

Now, the n in the intermediate state must be such that it can transition to n=1.

In the first step, n=3 → n' could be 2 or 4, but let's see.

From n=3 to n'=2: that's a possible transition. Because Δn can be any non-zero integer. So, in the first transition, n goes from 3 to 2.

Then, from n'=2, l=1, to n=1, l=0. That's a Δn of -1, which is allowed.

Alternatively, could the first transition be to n'=4, l=1? Then the second transition would need to go from n'=4 → n=1, which is Δn=-3. But wait, from n=4, l=1, can it transition to n=1, l=0?

Wait, for dipole transitions, Δn can be ±1, ±2, etc., but in hydrogen, the main transitions are usually those where l changes by ±1. So in the first step, 3 → 2 is more likely because 2 is one step below 3.

So the intermediate state is probably |2,1,m'⟩.

Now, what about m? The selection rule is Δm=0, ±1. So in the first step, m starts at 0. So m can go to -1, 0, or +1.

So the first transition could be to m=0, +1, or -1.

So the possible intermediate states are |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

Then, the second transition from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. Let's check the m selection.

In the second transition, m must change by 0, ±1 again.

So for the intermediate m', let's see:

If the intermediate state is |2,1,1⟩.

Then, in the second transition, m' must go to m_final=0.

So Δm = -1.

Which is allowed. Because 1 → 0 is Δm=-1.

Similarly, if the intermediate state is |2,1,0⟩, then m can go to -1, 0, or +1. But the final state is m=0, so Δm could be 0 (if the intermediate m is 0), or ±1.

Wait, no. The final state is m=0, so from m'=1, Δm=-1. From m'=0, Δm=0. From m'=-1, Δm=+1.

So all three are possible.

Wait, but the question states that the transition goes through two dipole transitions. So what's the probability of each route?

Wait, but I'm not just thinking about the allowed transitions, but the probabilities. So each possible dipole transition has a certain probability.

The matrix elements in dipole transitions depend on the integral of the wavefunctions multiplied by the dipole operator, which involves spherical harmonics Y_{l=1,m}.

The transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element for each possible transition.

Wait, but perhaps a simpler approach is to think about the possible transitions and their selection rules.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩.

In the first transition, it can go to |2,1,m⟩ where m can be -1, 0, +1.

Similarly, in the second transition, from |2,1,m⟩, it can go to |1,0,0⟩ only if m changes by 0, ±1.

So let's list all possible two-step paths.

Option 1: 3,0,0 → 2,1,1 → 1,0,0.

In the second step, m goes from 1 → 0. Δm=-1.

Option 2: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0.

Here, m stays the same (Δm=0).

Option 3: 3,0,0 → 2,1,-1 → 1,0,0.

Here, m goes from -1 →0. Δm=+1.

So all three transitions are possible. But what's the probability?

Wait, but the question says the transition is via two dipole transitions. So each step is dipole allowed.

So each of these paths is a possible route, but the probabilities depend on the square of the matrix elements for each transition.

But perhaps, in the nonrelativistic theory, the transition probabilities are determined by the selection rules, and the dipole matrix elements are non-zero only when certain conditions are met.

But I think the main point here is to figure out which of the options given correspond to allowed transitions and what their probabilities are.

Looking at the options:

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, probability 1/3.

Option B: ... to |2,1,1⟩, probability 1/4.

Option C: ... to |2,1,-1⟩, probability 1/4.

Option D: not sure, perhaps a typo.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D says |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and probability 2/3. But wait, the initial part of D says " \rangle\rightarrow |2,1,0\rangle", which seems like a typo. Maybe it was meant to say |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3. So perhaps it's a formatting error, and the intended option is that.

So the options have different probabilities. How do we calculate the probability?

Each dipole transition has a certain probability, and the overall probability for each two-step process would be the product of the probabilities of each step.

But I think in this case, the problem is more about the allowed transitions and the selection of the correct path(s), and the probabilities might be given based on some symmetry or the number of possible paths.

Wait, but wait. The total number of possible first transitions is three: m can be -1, 0, +1. So for each of these, the second transition must go to m=0. So each initial transition has a possible path.

So, the total number of allowed two-step paths is three: each m in the first step can lead to m=0 in the second.

But what determines the probability for each path? The transition probability is the square of the matrix element for each step. If all m transitions are equally probable, then each path would have the same probability, and the total would be the sum of the probabilities.

Wait, but let's think about the matrix elements. For the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_{00} Y_{1m} Y_{21}^*?

Wait, no. The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1m}, so the matrix element for the transition is proportional to the integral of ψ_{300}^* (r Y_{1m}) ψ_{n'l'm'}.

So, the matrix element for the first transition (3,0,0 → 2,1,m) would be proportional to the integral of Y_{00} Y_{1m} Y_{10}^* ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, from the properties of spherical harmonics, the integral for the matrix element for the transition would only be non-zero when certain conditions are met.

Wait, the matrix element for dipole transition is proportional to the integral of Y_{l=0}^{m=0} Y_{1 m'}^* Y_{l' m}.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of selection rules for each step.

In the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩, so l=0, m=0.

The dipole operator has l=1, so when you go from l=0 to l'=1, the integral will involve Y_{00} Y_{1 m}^*. The integral is non-zero only for certain m values.

Wait, the integral ∫ Y_{00}^* Y_{1m} Y_{1m'} dΩ is zero unless m' = m.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the matrix element for the first transition would be non-zero only if l' = l ±1. So from l=0 to l=1, which is allowed.

But the m selection is that m' can be m ±1 or m.

Wait, for the first transition, m_initial is 0.

So m_final in the intermediate state can be -1, 0, +1.

So each of these three possibilities is allowed, I think.

Now, the probability for each dipole transition is proportional to the square of the matrix element. But I'm not sure how to compute the exact value.

Wait, but perhaps the number of possible paths from the initial state to the final state would determine the probabilities. Since each of the three possible m values in the first step is possible, and each could lead to the final state.

But wait, each of the three m's in the first step would require a specific second step.

So, for each of the three possible m's in the first step, there's one possible path to the final state.

But the probabilities for each first step are not necessarily the same.

Wait, perhaps the matrix elements for the first transition depend on m.

Hmm, for the first transition, the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_{00} Y_{1m} Y_{1m}^* ?

Wait, perhaps the matrix element for the first transition (3,0,0 → 2,1,m) is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining Y00 and Y1m to get Y1m.

Wait, that's getting complicated, but I think the selection rule for m is Δm=0, ±1, so each m is allowed.

But perhaps the matrix elements have different weights. For example, when m=0, the integral might be larger than when m=+1 or -1.

Wait, the dipole operator is proportional to Y_{1, -1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1} components. So the matrix element for each transition would involve integrating these against the initial and final states.

So the matrix element for the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ would be proportional to:

⟨2,1,m | e r Y_{1m'} |3,0,0⟩,

where m' is the m component of the dipole operator.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think that the transition can only occur if certain conditions are met.

In the first transition, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The dipole operator has components with l=1, m=-1, 0, +1.

So the matrix element for the transition is non-zero only if, when you combine the angular parts, there's a non-zero integral.

Wait, the integral of Y_{00}^* Y_{1m} Y_{1m'} dΩ must be non-zero.

Wait, no. The dipole operator is Y_{1m'}, so the integral is ∫ Y_{00}^* Y_{1m'} Y_{1m} dΩ.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, the matrix element is proportional to the product of the matrix elements for l and m.

But I'm getting stuck on the exact calculation. Maybe I should think about the possible m transitions in each step and how many possible paths each has.

Wait, the problem is about the transition probabilities. The options given have probabilities as fractions like 1/3, 1/4, 2/3.

So, perhaps the probability is determined by the number of allowed paths.

In the first step, there are three possible m values (from 0 to -1, 0, +1).

Each of these can lead to the final state via another transition.

So, the total number of paths is three.

If each path is equally likely, then each has a probability of 1/3.

Wait, but the options A and D have 1/3 and 2/3, respectively. Hmm.

Wait, option A says the path is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, with probability 1/3.

Option D (if the typo is fixed) would have the same path and 2/3 probability.

Wait, but in reality, the probabilities might not be equal because the dipole matrix elements depend on m.

Wait, another approach: The states |2,1,1⟩ and |2,1,-1⟩ are degenerate in energy, while |2,1,0⟩ is another state.

But in the context of dipole transitions, the probability might be higher for certain m values.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of possible ways the transition can happen for each m is different.

Wait, considering that the initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0), the transition probabilities for different m in the intermediate state might be the same because the initial state is symmetric in all directions.

So, the three possible m values in the first step have equal probabilities. So each has a probability of 1/3.

Then, in the second step, each of these three m's can transition to m=0 with probability depending on their m.

Wait, but the second transition's matrix element depends on the m of the intermediate state.

Specifically, the second transition is from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

The matrix element for this transition is non-zero only if the integral of Y_{1m} Y_{1m'} Y_{00} is non-zero.

Wait, perhaps the matrix element is non-zero only when m' = m ±1 or 0.

But in this case, the final state has m=0. So, for each intermediate state m, the possible transition to m=0 is allowed.

Wait, but the matrix elements for the second transition might differ based on the initial m.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is possible only if m is 0, because the integral ∫ Y_{1m} Y_{1m'} Y_{00} dΩ is non-zero only when m = m'.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the selection rules for each transition (first and second) are applied, and the product of each step determines the overall probability.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about the possible options.

Looking back at the options, options A, B, C, D have different m's and different probabilities.

Option A: m=0 in the first step, probability 1/3.

Option B: m=1 in the first step, 1/4.

Option C: m=-1 in the first step, 1/4.

Option D: m=0, 2/3.

Wait, but according to our earlier reasoning, all three m's are possible, each with a certain probability.

But the options only give single paths, not all possible.

So the question is, which of the options correctly describes the transition route and the corresponding probability.

Wait, perhaps the overall probability is the sum of the probabilities for each possible path.

For example, if each path has a probability of 1/3, then the total probability is 3*(1/3) = 1, which makes sense.

But the options only present individual paths, not the sum.

But the question says "the transition route and the corresponding probability" are given in the options.

So perhaps the correct option is the one where the path is via a specific intermediate state, and the given probability is the correct one.

But how to determine which m gives which probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is determined by the number of possible ways the transitions can happen.

Wait, another approach: The transition from 3s to 1s via two dipole transitions. So, first to 2p, then to 1s.

The 2p state can have m = -1, 0, +1.

In the first step, the probability for each m is the same because the initial state is spherically symmetric.

So, each of the three m's has equal probability in the first transition.

Then, from each 2p state, the probability to transition to 1s (which is m=0) depends on the m of the intermediate state.

But I'm not sure how the second transition's probability varies with m.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition amplitude from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is proportional to m.

Because the dipole matrix element involves integrating m terms.

Wait, the dipole operator has components proportional to Y_{1, -1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}.

Wait, the dipole operator in spherical harmonics is proportional to r times (Y11 + Y1-1, Y10, Y1-1 - Y11)/i√2, etc. Not exactly sure, but perhaps the matrix element for the transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is proportional to m.

Because when you have Y_{1m} multiplied by Y_{1, m'}, the integral will have terms that depend on m and m'.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the matrix element for the transition |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

The matrix element ⟨1,0,0 | e r Y_{1m'} |2,1,m⟩ is proportional to the integral of Y_{00} Y_{1m'} Y_{1m}.

Hmm, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

The product Y_{1m} Y_{1m'} can be expressed as a sum over l and m of Y_{l, m''} terms. The integral of Y_{00} with this product will be non-zero only when l=0, which requires certain combinations.

Wait, perhaps the integral is zero unless m + m' =0.

Because Y_{1m} Y_{1m'} must have a component with m''=0.

So, for the integral ∫ Y_{00} Y_{1m} Y_{1m'} dΩ, it is non-zero only if m + m' =0, which implies m' = -m.

Because the integral involves the product of Y_{1m} and Y_{1m'}, which can be expressed as a sum over l=0,1,2 of ... and the only term that contributes for l=0 is when m + m' = 0.

Wait, but wait. The integral of three spherical harmonics Y_{l1 m1} Y_{l2 m2} Y_{l3 m3} is non-zero only if certain angular momentum conditions are satisfied, like m1 + m2 = m3, and the triangle inequality for l's.

In our case, l1=1 (from Y_{1m}), l2=1 (from Y_{1m'}), and l3=0 (from Y_{00}).

So, the integral is non-zero only if m + m' =0, and |1-1| ≤ 0 ≤ 1+1 → 0 ≤0 ≤2. So 0 is allowed.

But wait, 0 is within the range, so the integral is non-zero only when m + m' =0 and the sum of l's is ≥ l3.

Wait, for the product Y_{1m} Y_{1m'}, the integral with Y_{00} is non-zero only when m + m' =0 and the angular momentum addition allows l=0.

So the only way that can happen is if m' = -m.

So, for the transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the dipole operator must have a component with m' = -m.

Because the matrix element would be proportional to the integral of Y_{1m} Y_{1m'} Y_{00}.

But wait, the dipole operator has all m' values (-1, 0, +1), so for each m, there's a corresponding m' in the operator that can make the integral non-zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1m'}, where m' can be -1, 0, +1.

So the matrix element for the second transition is:

⟨1,0,0 | e r Y_{1m'} |2,1,m⟩.

Which is proportional to ∫ Y_{00}^* Y_{1m'} Y_{1m}^* dΩ.

Wait, that's not exactly right. The dipole operator is Y_{1m'}, so the matrix element is:

⟨1,0,0 | e r Y_{1m'} | 2,1,m ⟩.

Which is proportional to ∫ Y_{00}^* Y_{1m'} Y_{1m} dΩ.

Which is zero unless m + m' =0, because the integral of Y_{00}^* Y_{1m'} Y_{1m} is non-zero only when m + m' =0.

Wait, that's because the product Y_{1m'} Y_{1m} will have terms with m'' = m' + m. For the integral with Y_{00} (which has m=0), this requires m' + m =0.

So m' = -m.

So, for the matrix element to be non-zero, m' must be equal to -m.

But the dipole operator has m' = -1, 0, +1. So for m=0 in the intermediate state, m' can be 0.

So the matrix element for the second transition when m=0 is non-zero only if m' =0.

Similarly, for m=1, m' must be -1.

For m=-1, m' must be +1.

So, the matrix elements for the second transition are non-zero only in these cases.

So, for each intermediate state |2,1,m⟩:

- If m=0, then the dipole operator must have m' =0. So the matrix element is non-zero only when m'=0.

- If m=1, then m' must be -1.

- If m=-1, then m' must be +1.

So, for the second transition, each path has a non-zero matrix element.

But what is the probability for each?

Well, the probability is the square of the amplitude. The amplitude is proportional to the integral we were talking about.

But since the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which is spherically symmetric, the first transition's matrix elements for each m are the same.

Wait, no. Because the matrix element for the first transition (3,0,0 → 2,1,m) depends on m.

Wait, the matrix element for the first transition is proportional to the integral of Y_{00}^* Y_{1m} Y_{1m} dΩ. Because the dipole operator Y_{1m} is involved.

Wait, no, actually, the dipole operator has all three components, so the transition to |2,1,m⟩ would involve only the Y_{1m} component of the dipole operator.

Wait, perhaps the matrix element for the first transition is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining Y_{00} and Y_{1m}.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1.

The coefficient is non-zero only when m_initial + m_dipole = m_final.

In this case, the initial state has m=0, so m_dipole must be m_final.

So, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l=0 (m=0) and l=1 (m= m_final) is 1, because l=0 and l=1 can only combine to l=1, and m_final = 0 + m_dipole.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the matrix element for the first transition is proportional to the integral of Y_{00} Y_{1m} Y_{1m}.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Maybe I should think about the possible transitions and their probabilities.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each option.

Option A: path is 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0; probability 1/3.

Option B: path is 3,0,0 → 2,1,1 → 1,0,0; probability 1/4.

Option C: path is 3,0,0 → 2,1,-1 → 1,0,0; probability 1/4.

Option D: same as A, but probability 2/3.

But I'm not sure about the probabilities.

Wait, perhaps each of the three possible paths (m=0,1,-1) has an equal probability, so each would contribute 1/3. But the options only present single paths. So perhaps the correct option is A, the one with m=0, which would have a 1/3 probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is the sum of all possible paths. But the question says "the transition route and the corresponding probability", implying that the correct option lists the entire route and its probability.

Wait, but the problem states that the decay occurs via two dipole transitions. So it's a two-step process, and the probability given in the options is the probability for that specific two-step path.

So, the overall probability for the entire decay (both steps) must be calculated.

Each step's probability is the square of the matrix element, and the total probability is the product of the two.

But without knowing the exact matrix elements, how can I determine which option's probability is correct?

Wait, perhaps the matrix elements for the first transition are the same for all m, and the second transition's matrix elements vary with m.

But the initial state is spherically symmetric, so the first transition's probability for each m is the same.

So, the probability for the first step is 1/3 for each m.

Now, for the second step, the transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

The matrix element is proportional to something involving m.

Wait, perhaps it's proportional to m.

Because the dipole operator involves Y_{1m'}, and the integral would depend on m.

Wait, the matrix element for the second transition would be proportional to m * something.

Wait, let's think about the dipole operator as being proportional to Y_{1,1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,-1}.

So, for the transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the dipole operator's component Y_{1m'} must contribute to the integral.

As I thought earlier, the integral is non-zero only when m + m' =0.

So, for m=0, m' must be 0.

The matrix element would be proportional to the integral of Y_{00} Y_{10} Y_{10}.

Which is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which for combining Y_{10} and Y_{10} to get Y_{00} is zero, because 1 +1 cannot produce 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm getting the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients wrong.

Alternatively, the product Y_{10} Y_{10} can be expressed as a sum of terms with l=0,1,2.

For l=0, m=0: So, the integral would involve the Y_{00} component.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining two l=1 states with m=0 each to get l=0, m=0 is zero?

Wait, no, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding two angular momenta j1=1, m1=0 and j2=1, m2=0 to get j=0, m=0 is zero.

Because the possible j values are |1-1| =0, 1, 2. So j=0 is allowed, but the coefficient is zero because the symmetric combination (for even j) doesn't allow m=0 to come from two m=0 states.

Wait, I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps the integral is zero. That would mean the transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is forbidden? But that's not right because the option A says it's allowed.

Hmm, but that can't be correct because option A is an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Alternatively, I'm confusing the matrix elements for the dipole operator. The dipole operator has all three components, so perhaps the matrix element for m=0 is non-zero.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should recall that the dipole transition for hydrogen from 2p to 1s is possible only if m=0 in the 2p state.

Wait, no. Because the 1s state is spherically symmetric (m=0), the transition must conserve m in some way.

Wait, for the second transition, the initial state is |2,1,m⟩, and the final is |1,0,0⟩.

The dipole operator must have a component with m' such that m + m' =0.

Wait, because the matrix element is:

⟨1,0,0 | e r Y_{1m'} |2,1,m⟩.

Which is proportional to the integral of Y_{00} Y_{1m'} Y_{1m}.

Which is zero unless m + m' =0.

So, when m=0, m' must be 0.

When m=1, m' must be -1.

When m=-1, m' must be +1.

So, the matrix elements for the second transition are non-zero only when m' = -m.

Now, the dipole operator has components for m' =-1, 0, +1.

So, for each m in the intermediate state:

- m=0: m' must be 0.

- m=1: m' must be -1.

- m=-1: m' must be +1.

So, the matrix elements for each case:

For m=0, the dipole operator uses m'=0. So the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_{00} Y_{10} Y_{10}.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that integral is zero. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the integral is non-zero when m=0? Because Y_{10} squared can have a component in Y_{00}.

Wait, the product Y_{10} Y_{10} can be expressed using the spherical harmonics addition formulas.

The product Y_{10} Y_{10} can be written as (1/(4π)) [Y_{00} + 2 Y_{20}] ?

Wait, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the integral of Y_{10}^2 is proportional to Y_{00}.

If that's the case, then the integral of Y_{00} Y_{10} Y_{10} would be non-zero.

But I'm not confident about this. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities for the second step are the same regardless of m.

If that's the case, then each of the three possible paths would have a probability of (1/3) * (probability for second step).

But if the second step has the same probability for each m, then the total probability for each path would be (1/3) * same value, say P.

But without knowing P, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability for the second transition is the same for all m's. Then, each path would have a probability of (1/3) * same P.

But the question is about the total probability for the entire two-step process.

Wait, another approach: The possible two-step transitions from 3s to 1s via a 2p state are three in number, each with a certain probability.

The sum of their probabilities would be the total probability for 3s →1s via two dipole transitions.

But I don't know the total probability, but the options give specific probabilities for each path.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which has the path via |2,1,0⟩ and a probability of 1/3.

But why?

Because if the first transition has three possible m's, each with probability 1/3, and the second transition from each m has the same probability, then the total for each path is (1/3) * (1/ something). But I don't know.

Wait, perhaps the probability for the first transition depends on the value of m.

If m=0, the probability is higher.

Wait, but the initial state is spherically symmetric, so the probability for m=0 should be higher than for m=±1.

Because when you have spherical symmetry, transitions to m=0 are more probable due to higher overlap.

So, for the first transition, the probability for m=0 is higher than for m=±1.

But how much higher?

In the case of dipole transitions, the transition probabilities for different m's are proportional to (2l+1)δ_{m,m'}, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I remember that the transition probability for a dipole transition is proportional to |⟨f| e r |i⟩ |².

For the initial state |i⟩ = |3,0,0⟩ and final state |f⟩ = |n', l', m'⟩.

The matrix element is e times the integral of Y_{l',m'} Y_{1,m''} Y_{l,m}.

But I'm not making progress.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that in the first transition, the state |2,1,0⟩ is more probable than the others, and thus the path via |2,1,0⟩ has a higher probability, such as 2/3.

But why 2/3?

Wait, perhaps the matrix elements for m=0 are larger.

But I don't know the exact values.

Another angle: in the hydrogen atom, the transition from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1 is allowed, and from n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0 is also allowed.

But I'm not sure about the exact probabilities.

Perhaps the probability for each step is 1/2.

Wait, if each step has a probability of 1/2, the total would be 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4. But the options have 1/3 and 1/4.

Alternatively, perhaps the total probability is 1/3, as in option A.

But without knowing the exact matrix elements, it's hard to be certain.

Wait, another approach: The possible transitions from 3s to 1s via 2p are three, as discussed.

The total probability would be the sum of the probabilities of each path.

If each path has a probability of 1/3, then the total is 1, which is correct.

But the options don't present the sum; each option presents a single path and its probability.

So perhaps the correct option is the one that describes a possible path and assigns the correct probability.

But how to choose between the options.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option A, because the probability is 1/3, which corresponds to the case where the first transition has three possible m's, each with 1/3 probability, and the second transition is certain for each.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition via m=0 is more probable because the dipole operator's m=0 component is larger.

So, the probability for m=0 in the first step is higher than for m=±1.

The dipole operator's Y_{1,0} component is larger than Y_{1,1} and Y_{1,-1} because the weight for m=0 is higher.

Wait, the spherical harmonics have |Y_{lm}(θ,φ)|² that depends on l and m.

For l=1, |Y_{1,0}|² is 3/(4π) * cos²θ, which has a higher value when θ is small (aligned with z-axis), but the integral over all angles would be the same for each m.

Wait, no, because the integral of |Y_{1m}|² over all solid angles is the same for each m, 4π/(2(1)+1) ) = 2π/3.

So each m component has the same normalization.

Thus, each m has the same probability in the first transition.

Thus, each of the three possible m's in the first step has an equal probability of 1/3.

Then, for the second step, each m's transition to m=0 would have the same probability, perhaps.

Thus, the probability for each two-step path is (1/3) * (1/ number of possible m's in the second step).

Wait, in the second step, from |2,1,m⟩, you can transition to m=0 via a specific m' in the dipole operator.

But each of these has the same probability.

So, each two-step path has a probability of (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9, but that can't be right because the sum would be 3*(1/9)=1/3, which is less than 1.

Hmm, this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, perhaps the second transition has the same probability regardless of the m of the intermediate state.

So each two-step path has a probability of (1/3) * P, where P is the probability of the second transition.

But without knowing P, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, because it's the only one with a probability of 1/3, which makes sense if all paths have equal probabilities.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, option D (if correctly written) has a probability of 2/3, which could be the case if the path via m=0 has a higher probability.

Wait, another thought: The transition from 3s to 2p might have a higher probability for m=0 because the dipole operator's m=0 component has a higher value.

But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Option A: path via m=0, probability 1/3.

Option D (if correct) is the same path with 2/3.

But the question says the transition is via two dipole transitions. I think the correct answer is A, because the probability is 1/3.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves the decay of the hydrogen atom state \(|3,0,0\rangle\) to \(|1,0,0\rangle\) via two dipole transitions. The analysis begins by identifying the selection rules for electric dipole transitions: \(\Delta l = \pm 1\) and \(\Delta m = 0, \pm 1\). The initial state \(|3,0,0\rangle\) (3s orbital) decays through an intermediate state \(|2,1,m\rangle\) (2p orbital) to the final state \(|1,0,0\rangle\) (1s orbital).

### Key Points:
1. **First Transition**: From \(|3,0,0\rangle\) to \(|2,1,m\rangle\):
   - The intermediate state must have \(l = 1\), and \(m\) can be \(-1, 0, +1\) due to the \(\Delta m = 0, \pm 1\) rule.
   - The probabilities for the three possible \(m\) values (\(-1, 0, +1\)) are initially assumed to be equal, giving each a probability of \(1/3\).

2. **Second Transition**: From \(|2,1,m\rangle\) to \(|1,0,0\rangle\):
   - The final state has \(l = 0\) and \(m = 0\), so the intermediate state's \(m\) must change by \(\Delta m = 0, \pm 1\).
   - The transition probabilities depend on the matrix elements of the dipole operator, which are proportional to spherical harmonic integrals. These integrals are non-zero only if \(m + m' = 0\), where \(m'\) is the \(m\)-component of the dipole operator.

3. **Total Probability**:
   - Each two-step path (e.g., \(|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,0\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle\)) has a probability that is the product of the probabilities of the first and second transitions.
   - The initial state is spherically symmetric (\(l = 0\)), so the first transition probabilities for \(m = -1, 0, +1\) are equal, each with a probability of \(1/3\).
   - The second transition probabilities depend on the intermediate \(m\), but the problem does not provide explicit values for these probabilities.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: \(|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,0\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle\) with probability \(1/3\). This path is valid, and the probability \(1/3\) aligns with the assumption that all three possible \(m\) values in the first transition are equally likely.
- **Option B**: \(|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,1\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle\) with probability \(1/4\). This path is valid, but the probability \(1/4\) does not align with the assumption of equal probabilities for the first transition.
- **Option C**: \(|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,-1\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle\) with probability \(1/4\). This path is valid, but the probability \(1/4\) is inconsistent with the equal probability assumption for the first transition.
- **Option D**: \(|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,0\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle\) with probability \(2/3\). This path is valid, but the probability \(2/3\) suggests that the \(m = 0\) transition is more likely than the others, which is inconsistent with the assumption of equal probabilities for the first transition.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent option is **A**, as it correctly describes the transition route and assigns a probability of \(1/3\), which aligns with the assumption of equal probabilities for the first transition.

Answer: A

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about the hydrogen atom. Hmm, the question is about the decay of a specific state and the transition probabilities. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The state in question is |3,0,0⟩. I remember that in hydrogen atom notation, the first number is n (the principal quantum number), the second is l (the azimuthal or angular momentum), and the third is m (the magnetic quantum number). So here, n=3, l=0, m=0. That means it's a 3s orbital, right?

The decay is to |1,0,0⟩, which is 1s. So, the electron is transitioning from a higher energy level to a lower one, emitting some photons. The process involves two dipole transitions. Dipole transitions are electric dipole, I think, which have certain selection rules.

I remember the selection rules for electric dipole transitions. For hydrogen, the selection rules are Δl = ±1 and Δm = 0, ±1. Oh wait, but wait, there's another rule: Δn can be any integer except zero, but for hydrogen, since it's a one-electron atom, these selection rules hold.

So first, from n=3, l=0 to... Well, the first transition must go to a state where l increases by 1 because l was 0, so it must go to l=1. Because Δl can be +1 or -1. But since l can't be negative (it's 0 in the initial state), the only option is l=+1.

So the first transition is from |3,0,0⟩ to a state with n' = ?, l=1, m= ?

Wait, but wait. When you have a transition, the n can change as long as it's allowed by the selection rules, but for hydrogen, the specific transition is determined by the dipole matrix elements. But perhaps I should think about the possible intermediate states.

Wait, the problem says it's a two-step dipole transition. So first, |3,0,0⟩ → some state |n', l', m'⟩ via dipole, then from there to |1,0,0⟩ via another dipole transition.

So the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, and the final is |1,0,0⟩. Let's think about the two steps.

First transition: from n=3, l=0 to some intermediate state.

The selection rules say Δl = ±1, so from l=0, it can only go to l=1. Because if l were to go to -1, which isn't possible, so only l=1.

So the intermediate state must have l=1. So options for the first step are |n',1,m'⟩ where n' is either 2 or 4? Because n can increase or decrease.

Wait, but the second transition has to get to |1,0,0⟩. So the second step must have the intermediate state decay into n=1, l=0.

So the intermediate state must have l=1. So, for the second step, from |n',1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

Now, applying the selection rules again. From l=1, the next l must be l=0 (since Δl can be ±1). So that fits because the final state is l=0.

So for the second transition, l goes from 1 to 0.

Now, the n in the intermediate state must be such that it can transition to n=1.

In the first step, n=3 → n' could be 2 or 4, but let's see.

From n=3 to n'=2: that's a possible transition. Because Δn can be any non-zero integer. So, in the first transition, n goes from 3 to 2.

Then, from n'=2, l=1, to n=1, l=0. That's a Δn of -1, which is allowed.

Alternatively, could the first transition be to n'=4, l=1? Then the second transition would need to go from n'=4 → n=1, which is Δn=-3. But wait, from n=4, l=1, can it transition to n=1, l=0?

Wait, for dipole transitions, Δn can be ±1, ±2, etc., but in hydrogen, the main transitions are usually those where l changes by ±1. So in the first step, 3 → 2 is more likely because 2 is one step below 3.

So the intermediate state is probably |2,1,m'⟩.

Now, what about m? The selection rule is Δm=0, ±1. So in the first step, m starts at 0. So m can go to -1, 0, or +1.

So the first transition could be to m=0, +1, or -1.

So the possible intermediate states are |2,1,1⟩, |2,1,0⟩, or |2,1,-1⟩.

Then, the second transition from |2,1,m'⟩ to |1,0,0⟩. Let's check the m selection.

In the second transition, m must change by 0, ±1 again.

So for the intermediate m', let's see:

If the intermediate state is |2,1,1⟩.

Then, in the second transition, m' must go to m_final=0.

So Δm = -1.

Which is allowed. Because 1 → 0 is Δm=-1.

Similarly, if the intermediate state is |2,1,0⟩, then m can go to -1, 0, or +1. But the final state is m=0, so Δm could be 0 (if the intermediate m is 0), or ±1.

Wait, no. The final state is m=0, so from m'=1, Δm=-1. From m'=0, Δm=0. From m'=-1, Δm=+1.

So all three are possible.

Wait, but the question states that the transition goes through two dipole transitions. So what's the probability of each route?

Wait, but I'm not just thinking about the allowed transitions, but the probabilities. So each possible dipole transition has a certain probability.

The matrix elements in dipole transitions depend on the integral of the wavefunctions multiplied by the dipole operator, which involves spherical harmonics Y_{l=1,m}.

The transition probability is proportional to the square of the matrix element for each possible transition.

Wait, but perhaps a simpler approach is to think about the possible transitions and their selection rules.

The initial state is |3,0,0⟩.

In the first transition, it can go to |2,1,m⟩ where m can be -1, 0, +1.

Similarly, in the second transition, from |2,1,m⟩, it can go to |1,0,0⟩ only if m changes by 0, ±1.

So let's list all possible two-step paths.

Option 1: 3,0,0 → 2,1,1 → 1,0,0.

In the second step, m goes from 1 → 0. Δm=-1.

Option 2: 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0.

Here, m stays the same (Δm=0).

Option 3: 3,0,0 → 2,1,-1 → 1,0,0.

Here, m goes from -1 →0. Δm=+1.

So all three transitions are possible. But what's the probability?

Wait, but the question says the transition is via two dipole transitions. So each step is dipole allowed.

So each of these paths is a possible route, but the probabilities depend on the square of the matrix elements for each transition.

But perhaps, in the nonrelativistic theory, the transition probabilities are determined by the selection rules, and the dipole matrix elements are non-zero only when certain conditions are met.

But I think the main point here is to figure out which of the options given correspond to allowed transitions and what their probabilities are.

Looking at the options:

Option A: |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, probability 1/3.

Option B: ... to |2,1,1⟩, probability 1/4.

Option C: ... to |2,1,-1⟩, probability 1/4.

Option D: not sure, perhaps a typo.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option D says |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, and probability 2/3. But wait, the initial part of D says " \rangle\rightarrow |2,1,0\rangle", which seems like a typo. Maybe it was meant to say |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩ and 2/3. So perhaps it's a formatting error, and the intended option is that.

So the options have different probabilities. How do we calculate the probability?

Each dipole transition has a certain probability, and the overall probability for each two-step process would be the product of the probabilities of each step.

But I think in this case, the problem is more about the allowed transitions and the selection of the correct path(s), and the probabilities might be given based on some symmetry or the number of possible paths.

Wait, but wait. The total number of possible first transitions is three: m can be -1, 0, +1. So for each of these, the second transition must go to m=0. So each initial transition has a possible path.

So, the total number of allowed two-step paths is three: each m in the first step can lead to m=0 in the second.

But what determines the probability for each path? The transition probability is the square of the matrix element for each step. If all m transitions are equally probable, then each path would have the same probability, and the total would be the sum of the probabilities.

Wait, but let's think about the matrix elements. For the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩, the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_{00} Y_{1m} Y_{21}^*?

Wait, no. The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1m}, so the matrix element for the transition is proportional to the integral of ψ_{300}^* (r Y_{1m}) ψ_{n'l'm'}.

So, the matrix element for the first transition (3,0,0 → 2,1,m) would be proportional to the integral of Y_{00} Y_{1m} Y_{10}^* ?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, from the properties of spherical harmonics, the integral for the matrix element for the transition would only be non-zero when certain conditions are met.

Wait, the matrix element for dipole transition is proportional to the integral of Y_{l=0}^{m=0} Y_{1 m'}^* Y_{l' m}.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of selection rules for each step.

In the first transition, from |3,0,0⟩, so l=0, m=0.

The dipole operator has l=1, so when you go from l=0 to l'=1, the integral will involve Y_{00} Y_{1 m}^*. The integral is non-zero only for certain m values.

Wait, the integral ∫ Y_{00}^* Y_{1m} Y_{1m'} dΩ is zero unless m' = m.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, the matrix element for the first transition would be non-zero only if l' = l ±1. So from l=0 to l=1, which is allowed.

But the m selection is that m' can be m ±1 or m.

Wait, for the first transition, m_initial is 0.

So m_final in the intermediate state can be -1, 0, +1.

So each of these three possibilities is allowed, I think.

Now, the probability for each dipole transition is proportional to the square of the matrix element. But I'm not sure how to compute the exact value.

Wait, but perhaps the number of possible paths from the initial state to the final state would determine the probabilities. Since each of the three possible m values in the first step is possible, and each could lead to the final state.

But wait, each of the three m's in the first step would require a specific second step.

So, for each of the three possible m's in the first step, there's one possible path to the final state.

But the probabilities for each first step are not necessarily the same.

Wait, perhaps the matrix elements for the first transition depend on m.

Hmm, for the first transition, the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_{00} Y_{1m} Y_{1m}^* ?

Wait, perhaps the matrix element for the first transition (3,0,0 → 2,1,m) is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining Y00 and Y1m to get Y1m.

Wait, that's getting complicated, but I think the selection rule for m is Δm=0, ±1, so each m is allowed.

But perhaps the matrix elements have different weights. For example, when m=0, the integral might be larger than when m=+1 or -1.

Wait, the dipole operator is proportional to Y_{1, -1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1} components. So the matrix element for each transition would involve integrating these against the initial and final states.

So the matrix element for the first transition from |3,0,0⟩ to |2,1,m⟩ would be proportional to:

⟨2,1,m | e r Y_{1m'} |3,0,0⟩,

where m' is the m component of the dipole operator.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think that the transition can only occur if certain conditions are met.

In the first transition, the initial state is |3,0,0⟩. The dipole operator has components with l=1, m=-1, 0, +1.

So the matrix element for the transition is non-zero only if, when you combine the angular parts, there's a non-zero integral.

Wait, the integral of Y_{00}^* Y_{1m} Y_{1m'} dΩ must be non-zero.

Wait, no. The dipole operator is Y_{1m'}, so the integral is ∫ Y_{00}^* Y_{1m'} Y_{1m} dΩ.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right way. Alternatively, the matrix element is proportional to the product of the matrix elements for l and m.

But I'm getting stuck on the exact calculation. Maybe I should think about the possible m transitions in each step and how many possible paths each has.

Wait, the problem is about the transition probabilities. The options given have probabilities as fractions like 1/3, 1/4, 2/3.

So, perhaps the probability is determined by the number of allowed paths.

In the first step, there are three possible m values (from 0 to -1, 0, +1).

Each of these can lead to the final state via another transition.

So, the total number of paths is three.

If each path is equally likely, then each has a probability of 1/3.

Wait, but the options A and D have 1/3 and 2/3, respectively. Hmm.

Wait, option A says the path is |3,0,0⟩ → |2,1,0⟩ → |1,0,0⟩, with probability 1/3.

Option D (if the typo is fixed) would have the same path and 2/3 probability.

Wait, but in reality, the probabilities might not be equal because the dipole matrix elements depend on m.

Wait, another approach: The states |2,1,1⟩ and |2,1,-1⟩ are degenerate in energy, while |2,1,0⟩ is another state.

But in the context of dipole transitions, the probability might be higher for certain m values.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of possible ways the transition can happen for each m is different.

Wait, considering that the initial state is spherically symmetric (l=0), the transition probabilities for different m in the intermediate state might be the same because the initial state is symmetric in all directions.

So, the three possible m values in the first step have equal probabilities. So each has a probability of 1/3.

Then, in the second step, each of these three m's can transition to m=0 with probability depending on their m.

Wait, but the second transition's matrix element depends on the m of the intermediate state.

Specifically, the second transition is from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

The matrix element for this transition is non-zero only if the integral of Y_{1m} Y_{1m'} Y_{00} is non-zero.

Wait, perhaps the matrix element is non-zero only when m' = m ±1 or 0.

But in this case, the final state has m=0. So, for each intermediate state m, the possible transition to m=0 is allowed.

Wait, but the matrix elements for the second transition might differ based on the initial m.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is possible only if m is 0, because the integral ∫ Y_{1m} Y_{1m'} Y_{00} dΩ is non-zero only when m = m'.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the selection rules for each transition (first and second) are applied, and the product of each step determines the overall probability.

But I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should think about the possible options.

Looking back at the options, options A, B, C, D have different m's and different probabilities.

Option A: m=0 in the first step, probability 1/3.

Option B: m=1 in the first step, 1/4.

Option C: m=-1 in the first step, 1/4.

Option D: m=0, 2/3.

Wait, but according to our earlier reasoning, all three m's are possible, each with a certain probability.

But the options only give single paths, not all possible.

So the question is, which of the options correctly describes the transition route and the corresponding probability.

Wait, perhaps the overall probability is the sum of the probabilities for each possible path.

For example, if each path has a probability of 1/3, then the total probability is 3*(1/3) = 1, which makes sense.

But the options only present individual paths, not the sum.

But the question says "the transition route and the corresponding probability" are given in the options.

So perhaps the correct option is the one where the path is via a specific intermediate state, and the given probability is the correct one.

But how to determine which m gives which probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is determined by the number of possible ways the transitions can happen.

Wait, another approach: The transition from 3s to 1s via two dipole transitions. So, first to 2p, then to 1s.

The 2p state can have m = -1, 0, +1.

In the first step, the probability for each m is the same because the initial state is spherically symmetric.

So, each of the three m's has equal probability in the first transition.

Then, from each 2p state, the probability to transition to 1s (which is m=0) depends on the m of the intermediate state.

But I'm not sure how the second transition's probability varies with m.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition amplitude from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is proportional to m.

Because the dipole matrix element involves integrating m terms.

Wait, the dipole operator has components proportional to Y_{1, -1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,1}.

Wait, the dipole operator in spherical harmonics is proportional to r times (Y11 + Y1-1, Y10, Y1-1 - Y11)/i√2, etc. Not exactly sure, but perhaps the matrix element for the transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is proportional to m.

Because when you have Y_{1m} multiplied by Y_{1, m'}, the integral will have terms that depend on m and m'.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the matrix element for the transition |2,1,m⟩ → |1,0,0⟩.

The matrix element ⟨1,0,0 | e r Y_{1m'} |2,1,m⟩ is proportional to the integral of Y_{00} Y_{1m'} Y_{1m}.

Hmm, but I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

The product Y_{1m} Y_{1m'} can be expressed as a sum over l and m of Y_{l, m''} terms. The integral of Y_{00} with this product will be non-zero only when l=0, which requires certain combinations.

Wait, perhaps the integral is zero unless m + m' =0.

Because Y_{1m} Y_{1m'} must have a component with m''=0.

So, for the integral ∫ Y_{00} Y_{1m} Y_{1m'} dΩ, it is non-zero only if m + m' =0, which implies m' = -m.

Because the integral involves the product of Y_{1m} and Y_{1m'}, which can be expressed as a sum over l=0,1,2 of ... and the only term that contributes for l=0 is when m + m' = 0.

Wait, but wait. The integral of three spherical harmonics Y_{l1 m1} Y_{l2 m2} Y_{l3 m3} is non-zero only if certain angular momentum conditions are satisfied, like m1 + m2 = m3, and the triangle inequality for l's.

In our case, l1=1 (from Y_{1m}), l2=1 (from Y_{1m'}), and l3=0 (from Y_{00}).

So, the integral is non-zero only if m + m' =0, and |1-1| ≤ 0 ≤ 1+1 → 0 ≤0 ≤2. So 0 is allowed.

But wait, 0 is within the range, so the integral is non-zero only when m + m' =0 and the sum of l's is ≥ l3.

Wait, for the product Y_{1m} Y_{1m'}, the integral with Y_{00} is non-zero only when m + m' =0 and the angular momentum addition allows l=0.

So the only way that can happen is if m' = -m.

So, for the transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the dipole operator must have a component with m' = -m.

Because the matrix element would be proportional to the integral of Y_{1m} Y_{1m'} Y_{00}.

But wait, the dipole operator has all m' values (-1, 0, +1), so for each m, there's a corresponding m' in the operator that can make the integral non-zero.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The dipole operator is proportional to r Y_{1m'}, where m' can be -1, 0, +1.

So the matrix element for the second transition is:

⟨1,0,0 | e r Y_{1m'} |2,1,m⟩.

Which is proportional to ∫ Y_{00}^* Y_{1m'} Y_{1m}^* dΩ.

Wait, that's not exactly right. The dipole operator is Y_{1m'}, so the matrix element is:

⟨1,0,0 | e r Y_{1m'} | 2,1,m ⟩.

Which is proportional to ∫ Y_{00}^* Y_{1m'} Y_{1m} dΩ.

Which is zero unless m + m' =0, because the integral of Y_{00}^* Y_{1m'} Y_{1m} is non-zero only when m + m' =0.

Wait, that's because the product Y_{1m'} Y_{1m} will have terms with m'' = m' + m. For the integral with Y_{00} (which has m=0), this requires m' + m =0.

So m' = -m.

So, for the matrix element to be non-zero, m' must be equal to -m.

But the dipole operator has m' = -1, 0, +1. So for m=0 in the intermediate state, m' can be 0.

So the matrix element for the second transition when m=0 is non-zero only if m' =0.

Similarly, for m=1, m' must be -1.

For m=-1, m' must be +1.

So, the matrix elements for the second transition are non-zero only in these cases.

So, for each intermediate state |2,1,m⟩:

- If m=0, then the dipole operator must have m' =0. So the matrix element is non-zero only when m'=0.

- If m=1, then m' must be -1.

- If m=-1, then m' must be +1.

So, for the second transition, each path has a non-zero matrix element.

But what is the probability for each?

Well, the probability is the square of the amplitude. The amplitude is proportional to the integral we were talking about.

But since the initial state is |3,0,0⟩, which is spherically symmetric, the first transition's matrix elements for each m are the same.

Wait, no. Because the matrix element for the first transition (3,0,0 → 2,1,m) depends on m.

Wait, the matrix element for the first transition is proportional to the integral of Y_{00}^* Y_{1m} Y_{1m} dΩ. Because the dipole operator Y_{1m} is involved.

Wait, no, actually, the dipole operator has all three components, so the transition to |2,1,m⟩ would involve only the Y_{1m} component of the dipole operator.

Wait, perhaps the matrix element for the first transition is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining Y_{00} and Y_{1m}.

Wait, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for combining l=0 and l=1 to get l=1.

The coefficient is non-zero only when m_initial + m_dipole = m_final.

In this case, the initial state has m=0, so m_dipole must be m_final.

So, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding l=0 (m=0) and l=1 (m= m_final) is 1, because l=0 and l=1 can only combine to l=1, and m_final = 0 + m_dipole.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the matrix element for the first transition is proportional to the integral of Y_{00} Y_{1m} Y_{1m}.

Wait, perhaps that's not the right approach. Maybe I should think about the possible transitions and their probabilities.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each option.

Option A: path is 3,0,0 → 2,1,0 → 1,0,0; probability 1/3.

Option B: path is 3,0,0 → 2,1,1 → 1,0,0; probability 1/4.

Option C: path is 3,0,0 → 2,1,-1 → 1,0,0; probability 1/4.

Option D: same as A, but probability 2/3.

But I'm not sure about the probabilities.

Wait, perhaps each of the three possible paths (m=0,1,-1) has an equal probability, so each would contribute 1/3. But the options only present single paths. So perhaps the correct option is A, the one with m=0, which would have a 1/3 probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability is the sum of all possible paths. But the question says "the transition route and the corresponding probability", implying that the correct option lists the entire route and its probability.

Wait, but the problem states that the decay occurs via two dipole transitions. So it's a two-step process, and the probability given in the options is the probability for that specific two-step path.

So, the overall probability for the entire decay (both steps) must be calculated.

Each step's probability is the square of the matrix element, and the total probability is the product of the two.

But without knowing the exact matrix elements, how can I determine which option's probability is correct?

Wait, perhaps the matrix elements for the first transition are the same for all m, and the second transition's matrix elements vary with m.

But the initial state is spherically symmetric, so the first transition's probability for each m is the same.

So, the probability for the first step is 1/3 for each m.

Now, for the second step, the transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩.

The matrix element is proportional to something involving m.

Wait, perhaps it's proportional to m.

Because the dipole operator involves Y_{1m'}, and the integral would depend on m.

Wait, the matrix element for the second transition would be proportional to m * something.

Wait, let's think about the dipole operator as being proportional to Y_{1,1}, Y_{1,0}, Y_{1,-1}.

So, for the transition from |2,1,m⟩ to |1,0,0⟩, the dipole operator's component Y_{1m'} must contribute to the integral.

As I thought earlier, the integral is non-zero only when m + m' =0.

So, for m=0, m' must be 0.

The matrix element would be proportional to the integral of Y_{00} Y_{10} Y_{10}.

Which is proportional to the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient, which for combining Y_{10} and Y_{10} to get Y_{00} is zero, because 1 +1 cannot produce 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm getting the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients wrong.

Alternatively, the product Y_{10} Y_{10} can be expressed as a sum of terms with l=0,1,2.

For l=0, m=0: So, the integral would involve the Y_{00} component.

The Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for combining two l=1 states with m=0 each to get l=0, m=0 is zero?

Wait, no, the Clebsch-Gordan coefficient for adding two angular momenta j1=1, m1=0 and j2=1, m2=0 to get j=0, m=0 is zero.

Because the possible j values are |1-1| =0, 1, 2. So j=0 is allowed, but the coefficient is zero because the symmetric combination (for even j) doesn't allow m=0 to come from two m=0 states.

Wait, I'm not exactly sure, but perhaps the integral is zero. That would mean the transition from |2,1,0⟩ to |1,0,0⟩ is forbidden? But that's not right because the option A says it's allowed.

Hmm, but that can't be correct because option A is an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Alternatively, I'm confusing the matrix elements for the dipole operator. The dipole operator has all three components, so perhaps the matrix element for m=0 is non-zero.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should recall that the dipole transition for hydrogen from 2p to 1s is possible only if m=0 in the 2p state.

Wait, no. Because the 1s state is spherically symmetric (m=0), the transition must conserve m in some way.

Wait, for the second transition, the initial state is |2,1,m⟩, and the final is |1,0,0⟩.

The dipole operator must have a component with m' such that m + m' =0.

Wait, because the matrix element is:

⟨1,0,0 | e r Y_{1m'} |2,1,m⟩.

Which is proportional to the integral of Y_{00} Y_{1m'} Y_{1m}.

Which is zero unless m + m' =0.

So, when m=0, m' must be 0.

When m=1, m' must be -1.

When m=-1, m' must be +1.

So, the matrix elements for the second transition are non-zero only when m' = -m.

Now, the dipole operator has components for m' =-1, 0, +1.

So, for each m in the intermediate state:

- m=0: m' must be 0.

- m=1: m' must be -1.

- m=-1: m' must be +1.

So, the matrix elements for each case:

For m=0, the dipole operator uses m'=0. So the matrix element is proportional to the integral of Y_{00} Y_{10} Y_{10}.

Wait, but earlier, I thought that integral is zero. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the integral is non-zero when m=0? Because Y_{10} squared can have a component in Y_{00}.

Wait, the product Y_{10} Y_{10} can be expressed using the spherical harmonics addition formulas.

The product Y_{10} Y_{10} can be written as (1/(4π)) [Y_{00} + 2 Y_{20}] ?

Wait, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps the integral of Y_{10}^2 is proportional to Y_{00}.

If that's the case, then the integral of Y_{00} Y_{10} Y_{10} would be non-zero.

But I'm not confident about this. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition probabilities for the second step are the same regardless of m.

If that's the case, then each of the three possible paths would have a probability of (1/3) * (probability for second step).

But if the second step has the same probability for each m, then the total probability for each path would be (1/3) * same value, say P.

But without knowing P, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability for the second transition is the same for all m's. Then, each path would have a probability of (1/3) * same P.

But the question is about the total probability for the entire two-step process.

Wait, another approach: The possible two-step transitions from 3s to 1s via a 2p state are three in number, each with a certain probability.

The sum of their probabilities would be the total probability for 3s →1s via two dipole transitions.

But I don't know the total probability, but the options give specific probabilities for each path.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, which has the path via |2,1,0⟩ and a probability of 1/3.

But why?

Because if the first transition has three possible m's, each with probability 1/3, and the second transition from each m has the same probability, then the total for each path is (1/3) * (1/ something). But I don't know.

Wait, perhaps the probability for the first transition depends on the value of m.

If m=0, the probability is higher.

Wait, but the initial state is spherically symmetric, so the probability for m=0 should be higher than for m=±1.

Because when you have spherical symmetry, transitions to m=0 are more probable due to higher overlap.

So, for the first transition, the probability for m=0 is higher than for m=±1.

But how much higher?

In the case of dipole transitions, the transition probabilities for different m's are proportional to (2l+1)δ_{m,m'}, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I remember that the transition probability for a dipole transition is proportional to |⟨f| e r |i⟩ |².

For the initial state |i⟩ = |3,0,0⟩ and final state |f⟩ = |n', l', m'⟩.

The matrix element is e times the integral of Y_{l',m'} Y_{1,m''} Y_{l,m}.

But I'm not making progress.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that in the first transition, the state |2,1,0⟩ is more probable than the others, and thus the path via |2,1,0⟩ has a higher probability, such as 2/3.

But why 2/3?

Wait, perhaps the matrix elements for m=0 are larger.

But I don't know the exact values.

Another angle: in the hydrogen atom, the transition from n=3, l=0 to n=2, l=1 is allowed, and from n=2, l=1 to n=1, l=0 is also allowed.

But I'm not sure about the exact probabilities.

Perhaps the probability for each step is 1/2.

Wait, if each step has a probability of 1/2, the total would be 1/2 * 1/2 = 1/4. But the options have 1/3 and 1/4.

Alternatively, perhaps the total probability is 1/3, as in option A.

But without knowing the exact matrix elements, it's hard to be certain.

Wait, another approach: The possible transitions from 3s to 1s via 2p are three, as discussed.

The total probability would be the sum of the probabilities of each path.

If each path has a probability of 1/3, then the total is 1, which is correct.

But the options don't present the sum; each option presents a single path and its probability.

So perhaps the correct option is the one that describes a possible path and assigns the correct probability.

But how to choose between the options.

Wait, perhaps the answer is option A, because the probability is 1/3, which corresponds to the case where the first transition has three possible m's, each with 1/3 probability, and the second transition is certain for each.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the transition via m=0 is more probable because the dipole operator's m=0 component is larger.

So, the probability for m=0 in the first step is higher than for m=±1.

The dipole operator's Y_{1,0} component is larger than Y_{1,1} and Y_{1,-1} because the weight for m=0 is higher.

Wait, the spherical harmonics have |Y_{lm}(θ,φ)|² that depends on l and m.

For l=1, |Y_{1,0}|² is 3/(4π) * cos²θ, which has a higher value when θ is small (aligned with z-axis), but the integral over all angles would be the same for each m.

Wait, no, because the integral of |Y_{1m}|² over all solid angles is the same for each m, 4π/(2(1)+1) ) = 2π/3.

So each m component has the same normalization.

Thus, each m has the same probability in the first transition.

Thus, each of the three possible m's in the first step has an equal probability of 1/3.

Then, for the second step, each m's transition to m=0 would have the same probability, perhaps.

Thus, the probability for each two-step path is (1/3) * (1/ number of possible m's in the second step).

Wait, in the second step, from |2,1,m⟩, you can transition to m=0 via a specific m' in the dipole operator.

But each of these has the same probability.

So, each two-step path has a probability of (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9, but that can't be right because the sum would be 3*(1/9)=1/3, which is less than 1.

Hmm, this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, perhaps the second transition has the same probability regardless of the m of the intermediate state.

So each two-step path has a probability of (1/3) * P, where P is the probability of the second transition.

But without knowing P, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option A, because it's the only one with a probability of 1/3, which makes sense if all paths have equal probabilities.

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, option D (if correctly written) has a probability of 2/3, which could be the case if the path via m=0 has a higher probability.

Wait, another thought: The transition from 3s to 2p might have a higher probability for m=0 because the dipole operator's m=0 component has a higher value.

But I'm not sure.

Given the time I've spent and the confusion, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the options.

Option A: path via m=0, probability 1/3.

Option D (if correct) is the same path with 2/3.

But the question says the transition is via two dipole transitions. I think the correct answer is A, because the probability is 1/3.


The problem involves the decay of the hydrogen atom state \(|3,0,0\rangle\) to \(|1,0,0\rangle\) via two dipole transitions. The analysis begins by identifying the selection rules for electric dipole transitions: \(\Delta l = \pm 1\) and \(\Delta m = 0, \pm 1\). The initial state \(|3,0,0\rangle\) (3s orbital) decays through an intermediate state \(|2,1,m\rangle\) (2p orbital) to the final state \(|1,0,0\rangle\) (1s orbital).

### Key Points:
1. **First Transition**: From \(|3,0,0\rangle\) to \(|2,1,m\rangle\):
   - The intermediate state must have \(l = 1\), and \(m\) can be \(-1, 0, +1\) due to the \(\Delta m = 0, \pm 1\) rule.
   - The probabilities for the three possible \(m\) values (\(-1, 0, +1\)) are initially assumed to be equal, giving each a probability of \(1/3\).

2. **Second Transition**: From \(|2,1,m\rangle\) to \(|1,0,0\rangle\):
   - The final state has \(l = 0\) and \(m = 0\), so the intermediate state's \(m\) must change by \(\Delta m = 0, \pm 1\).
   - The transition probabilities depend on the matrix elements of the dipole operator, which are proportional to spherical harmonic integrals. These integrals are non-zero only if \(m + m' = 0\), where \(m'\) is the \(m\)-component of the dipole operator.

3. **Total Probability**:
   - Each two-step path (e.g., \(|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,0\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle\)) has a probability that is the product of the probabilities of the first and second transitions.
   - The initial state is spherically symmetric (\(l = 0\)), so the first transition probabilities for \(m = -1, 0, +1\) are equal, each with a probability of \(1/3\).
   - The second transition probabilities depend on the intermediate \(m\), but the problem does not provide explicit values for these probabilities.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: \(|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,0\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle\) with probability \(1/3\). This path is valid, and the probability \(1/3\) aligns with the assumption that all three possible \(m\) values in the first transition are equally likely.
- **Option B**: \(|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,1\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle\) with probability \(1/4\). This path is valid, but the probability \(1/4\) does not align with the assumption of equal probabilities for the first transition.
- **Option C**: \(|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,-1\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle\) with probability \(1/4\). This path is valid, but the probability \(1/4\) is inconsistent with the equal probability assumption for the first transition.
- **Option D**: \(|3,0,0\rangle \to |2,1,0\rangle \to |1,0,0\rangle\) with probability \(2/3\). This path is valid, but the probability \(2/3\) suggests that the \(m = 0\) transition is more likely than the others, which is inconsistent with the assumption of equal probabilities for the first transition.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent option is **A**, as it correctly describes the transition route and assigns a probability of \(1/3\), which aligns with the assumption of equal probabilities for the first transition.

Answer: A
