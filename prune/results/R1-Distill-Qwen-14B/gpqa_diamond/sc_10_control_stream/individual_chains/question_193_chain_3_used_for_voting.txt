Okay, so I've got this astronomy question here, and I'm a bit rusty on some of the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The problem states that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, number of stars (N) is proportional to 1/plx^5. I need to find how the number of stars changes with distance, per unit range of distance r.

Hmm, right. Parallax is related to distance. I remember that parallax (plx) is the reciprocal of distance. Oh wait, more precisely, distance (d) is roughly equal to 1 over parallax (since plx in arcseconds and distance in parsecs). So d ≈ 1/plx. So plx is inversely proportional to distance. 

Wait, but in this case, N is proportional to 1/(plx)^5. Let me write that down: N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx is 1/d, substituting that in, N ∝ 1/( (1/d) )^5. Let me compute that exponent. 1/( (1/d)^5 ) is the same as d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. Oh wait, but wait, that's the number of stars as a function of distance. But the question is asking how the number of stars change with distance, per unit range of distance r. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of differential relationships, like how N changes with a small change in r.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me step back. The number of stars in a region varies as 1/plx^5. So, N = k * (1/plx)^5, where k is a constant. But because plx is inversely proportional to distance, plx = 1/d. So substituting, N = k * (d)^5. So N is proportional to d^5.

Wait, but the question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. So perhaps I should think about the derivative of N with respect to d. Because if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dd would be proportional to 5*d^4. But wait, the question is about the change per unit distance. Alternatively, it's about the number of stars in a thin shell of radius r, which would depend on the derivative of N with respect to r. 

Wait, wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about what the question says again. It says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So when parallax is small (because distance is large), the number of stars increases. But how does the number of stars change as a function of distance? The way the question is phrased, when you look at a certain distance, the number of stars you observe is proportional to (1/plx)^5. But how does that translate into how the number of stars varies with distance as you move along it?

Wait, perhaps I should model this. Let's say that for a given distance, the number of stars is N ∝ d^5. So, for a particular shell at radius d, the number of stars would be proportional to d^5. But if you're considering a range of distances, like from d to d + dr, the change in the number of stars would be dN = (dN/dd) * dr. Since N ∝ d^5, dN/dd is 5d^4. So, dN is proportional to d^4 * dr. Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to d^4. 

Wait, but wait. The question is about the change in the number of stars per unit range of distance. So as you move from one point to another a small distance apart, how does the number of stars change? If dN/dr is proportional to d^4, then the number per unit distance increases with the fourth power of d. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see an option with r^4 as the answer. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:
A) ~ r^3
B) ~ r^5
C) ~ r^4
D) ~ r^2

Oh, option C is r^4. So according to this, the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't get confused with the initial setup. Alternatively, perhaps I should model the number of stars as a function of distance. Suppose that the number of stars in a unit volume is proportional to (1/plx)^5. But since plx is 1/d, that would make the number density N ∝ d^5. But wait, the number density is stars per volume, so the total number in a shell of thickness dr at distance d would be N = (number density) * (volume). Volume is 4πd² dr. So total stars in shell: N_shell = (k d^5) * (4πd² dr) = 4πk d^7 dr. So the number per unit distance dr would be proportional to d^7, but that doesn't match any of the options either.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again. The question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So N varies as 1/plx^5. But since plx is 1/d, N is proportional to d^5. So N = C d^5, where C is a constant. So the number of stars at a particular distance d is C d^5. Now, if we consider how the number of stars changes as we move a small distance dr, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit distance. So the number of stars in a thin shell between d and d+dr would be N_shell = C (d+dr)^5 - C d^5. But since dr is small, we can approximate this as N_shell ≈ C * 5 d^4 dr. So N_shell is proportional to d^4 dr. Therefore, the number of stars per unit dr is proportional to d^4, which would be r^4. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait, that's for a thin shell. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of stars as a function of distance, and how the count changes as you move from one distance to another. For example, if you have a region at distance d, and another at distance d+dr, how many more stars are there per unit dr. So in that case, the derivative dN/dr is 5 C d^4, implying the change is proportional to d^4, so the number of stars per unit distance is increasing with the fourth power. So the answer would be option C.

So looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4. So the correct answer should be C.

The problem states that the number of stars in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto \frac{1}{\text{plx}}^5 \). Since parallax (\( \text{plx} \)) is inversely proportional to distance (\( d \)), we can substitute \( \text{plx} = \frac{1}{d} \) into the equation, yielding \( N \propto d^5 \). This means the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance.

To determine how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)), we consider the derivative \( \frac{dN}{dd} \). Since \( N \propto d^5 \), the derivative is \( \frac{dN}{dd} \propto 5d^4 \). This indicates that the change in the number of stars per unit distance is proportional to \( d^4 \), or equivalently \( r^4 \).

Thus, the number of stars in the region changes with distance per unit range of distance as \( r^4 \), making the correct answer:

Because if N is proportional to d^5, then dN/dd would be proportional to 5*d^4. But wait, the question is about the change per unit distance.

Therefore, the number of stars per unit distance (dN/dr) is proportional to d^4. 

Wait, but wait. The question is about the change in the number of stars per unit range of distance. So as you move from one point to another a small distance apart, how does the number of stars change? If dN/dr is proportional to d^4, then the number per unit distance increases with the fourth power of d. But wait, looking at the options, I don't see an option with r^4 as the answer.

But since plx is 1/d, N is proportional to d^5. So N = C d^5, where C is a constant. So the number of stars at a particular distance d is C d^5. Now, if we consider how the number of stars changes as we move a small distance dr, perhaps the question is about the number of stars per unit distance. So the number of stars in a thin shell between d and d+dr would be N_shell = C (d+dr)^5 - C d^5. But since dr is small, we can approximate this as N_shell ≈ C * 5 d^4 dr. So N_shell is proportional to d^4 dr. Therefore, the number of stars per unit dr is proportional to d^4, which would be r^4. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but wait, that's for a thin shell. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the number of stars as a function of distance, and how the count changes as you move from one distance to another. For example, if you have a region at distance d, and another at distance d+dr, how many more stars are there per unit dr. So in that case, the derivative dN/dr is 5 C d^4, implying the change is proportional to d^4, so the number of stars per unit distance is increasing with the fourth power. So the answer would be option C.

So looking at the options, option C is ~ r^4. So the correct answer should be C.
