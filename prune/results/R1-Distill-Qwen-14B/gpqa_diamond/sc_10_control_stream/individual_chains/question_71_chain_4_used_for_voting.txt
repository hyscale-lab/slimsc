Okay, so I have this astronomy problem here, and I'm supposed to find the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Hmm. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, the question says the planets are in orbital resonance with periods in a ratio of 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has the shortest period, and Planet_5 the longest. Since the orbital periods are given in a ratio, I probably need to express each planet's period in terms of Planet_1's period.

Wait, but wait. The problem is about equilibrium temperatures. I remember that the equilibrium temperature of a planet depends on its distance from the star and its albedo. Oh, right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is T = T_star * ( (L / (16πσ)) )^(1/4) * ( (1 - a) / (d^2) )^(1/4 ), but maybe a simplified version is T ∝ ( (1 - a) / d )^(1/4 ) * ( L )^(1/4 ), but since all planets have the same albedo (given), a is the same for all. So albedo cancels out.

But since the planets are orbiting the same star, L (the star's luminosity) is the same for all. So the equilibrium temperature only depends on the distance from the star, d. Wait, but wait. The orbital period relates to the semi-major axis via Kepler's third law. Since the orbits are circular, the semi-major axis is the radius of the orbit, so d is the semi-major axis.

So, Kepler's third law states that (P^2) ∝ (a^3) / (M_star), assuming M_star is much larger than the planet masses, which it is. So for planets orbiting the same star, P^2 ∝ a^3. So a = (P^2 * k )^(1/3 ), where k is a constant for the star.

So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between two planets is ( T4 / T2 ) = ( ( a2 / a4 )^(1/2) ) because the equilibrium temperature formula, when considering only distance, is T ∝ (1/d)^(1/2). Wait, let me double-check. The equilibrium temperature formula: T_eq = T_star * sqrt(R_star / (2a)) * ( (1 - a) )^(1/4 ), but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me get this straight.

The equilibrium temperature formula is T = (L/(16πσ d²))^(1/4) * (1 - albedo)^(1/4). So T is proportional to (1/d²)^(1/4) = 1/d^(1/2). So T ∝ 1/sqrt(d). Alternatively, since d^3 ∝ P^2, from Kepler's law, then d ∝ P^(2/3). So T ∝ 1/( (P^(2/3) )^(1/2) ) = 1/( P^(1/3) ). So T is inversely proportional to P^(1/3).

Wait, that's another approach. So the equilibrium temperature ratio between two planets is (T4/T2) = (P2/P4)^(1/3). Because T ∝ 1/P^(1/3), so T4 = T2 * (P2 / P4)^(1/3).

Wait, let me think again. Let's say planet A has period P_A, planet B has P_B. Then from Kepler's law: (P_A^2)/(P_B^2) = (a_A^3)/(a_B^3). So a_A^3 = (P_A^2 / P_B^2) * a_B^3. Hmm, maybe it's easier to express a in terms of P.

So, a = k * P^(2/3), where k is a constant. So T_eq is proportional to 1/sqrt(a) = 1/( sqrt(k P^(2/3)) ) = 1/( (k)^(1/2) P^(1/3) ). So T_eq is proportional to 1/( P^(1/3) ). So the ratio of T4 to T2 is (P2 / P4)^(1/3), since T4 = T_eq4 and T2 = T_eq2.

So let me get the periods. The periods are in ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5.

So for Planet_2, the period is 2 units. Planet_4 has a period of 3.5 units.

So the ratio P2/P4 is 2 / 3.5 = 4/7. So T4/T2 = (4/7)^(1/3). Wait, no, because T is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so T4 = T2 * (P2 / P4)^(1/3). So T4/T2 = (P2/P4)^(1/3).

Yes, that's correct. So P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So 2/3.5 is 4/7. So (4/7)^(1/3).

What's 4/7 approximately? 4 divided by 7 is approximately 0.5714.

So the cube root of 0.5714. Hmm. Let's think about cube roots. The cube root of 1 is 1, cube root of 0.5 is about 0.7937, cube root of 0.729 (which is 0.9^3) is 0.9. Wait, but 0.5714 is less than 0.729, so the cube root would be less than 0.9 but more than 0.7937. Wait, perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, 0.5714 is approximately 0.571. So what's the cube of 0.8? 0.8^3 is 0.512. 0.82^3 is approximately 0.82 *0.82= 0.6724 *0.82 ≈ 0.551. Hmm, 0.83^3: 0.83 *0.83= 0.6889; 0.6889 * 0.83 ≈ 0.5717. Oh, that's very close to 0.5714. So cube root of 0.5714 is approximately 0.83. So the ratio T4/T2 is about 0.83.

Wait, but wait, wait! No. Wait. Because T_eq is inversely proportional to P^(1/3), so T4 is colder than T2 if P4 is longer than P2. Because 3.5 > 2, so P4 is larger than P2. So T4 < T2. So the ratio T4/T2 is less than 1, which matches the calculation of 0.83.

So looking at the options:

Option C is ~0.83.

So the answer would be option C.

To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we use the relationship between equilibrium temperature and orbital period. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the cube root of the orbital period \( P \), i.e., \( T \propto P^{-1/3} \). This relationship arises from Kepler's third law, which links orbital period to semi-major axis, and the equilibrium temperature formula, which depends on the distance from the star.

Given the orbital period ratios of the planets as \( 1:2:2.5:3.5:5 \), we identify the periods of Planet_2 and Planet_4 as \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \), respectively. The ratio of equilibrium temperatures is then:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \left(\frac{P_2}{P_4}\right)^{1/3}.
\]

Substituting \( P_2 = 2 \) and \( P_4 = 3.5 \), we calculate:

\[
\frac{P_2}{P_4} = \frac{2}{3.5} = \frac{4}{7} \approx 0.5714.
\]

Taking the cube root of \( 0.5714 \), we find:

\[
\left(0.5714\right)^{1/3} \approx 0.83.
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately \( 0.83 \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C) ~0.83**

Yes, that's correct. So P2 is 2, P4 is 3.5. So 2/3.5 is 4/7. So (4/7)^(1/3).
