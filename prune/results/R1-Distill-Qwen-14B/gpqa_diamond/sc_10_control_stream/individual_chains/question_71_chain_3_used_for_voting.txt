Okay, so I need to figure out the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Let me think about this step by step. 

First, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula I think is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo)/sigma )^0.25 or something like that. Wait, no, maybe it's simpler. Oh right, the basic formula is T = T_eff * (L / (16 pi sigma a²))^0.25. Wait, no, I think the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L/(a²))^(1/4), assuming a circular orbit and ignoring other factors like greenhouse effect or albedo. Oh but wait, the problem says all planets have the same albedo, so that cancels out. So I can ignore albedo for this problem.

The key thing is the distance from the star. But wait, the planets are in orbital resonance with periods in a ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P_1, Planet_2 has 2P_1, Planet_3 has 2.5P_1, Planet_4 is 3.5P_1, and Planet_5 is 5P_1.

The orbital period and distance are related by Kepler's third law: P² is proportional to a³. So a = (P^2)^(1/3) * constant. But because we're dealing with ratios, maybe I can express a_2 in terms of a_1, and a_4 in terms of a_1, then take the ratio a_4/a_2.

Let me write this out. Let’s denote a_i as the semi-major axis (distance) of planet i. 

For Planet_1: P1 = P
So a1 = (P^2 * (G M / (4 pi²)) )^(1/3) → but since all planets orbit the same star, the constant (G M/(4 pi²)) is the same for all. So a_i is proportional to P_i^(2/3).

So the ratio a_i / a_j is (P_i / P_j)^(2/3).

Wait, because a ∝ P^(2/3), so a_i = k * P_i^(2/3), where k is a constant. So a_i / a_j = (P_i / P_j)^(2/3).

So for Planet_4, which has period 3.5 P1, and Planet_2 with period 2 P1.

So a_2 = k * (2 P1)^(2/3)
a_4 = k * (3.5 P1)^(2/3)

The ratio a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3)

Wait, 3.5 is 7/2, so 3.5/2 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). Let me compute that.

Wait, 7/4 is 1.75. So I can compute 1.75^(2/3). Hmm, what's that approximately?

Alternatively, taking natural logs: ln(1.75) ≈ 0.5596. Multiply by (2/3), you get about 0.373. Then exponentiate e^0.373 ≈ 1.452.

Wait, but let me double-check: 1.75^ (2/3) = e^( (2/3)*ln(1.75) )

ln(1.75) is about 0.5596. So 2/3 of that is around 0.373. e^0.373 is approximately 1.452. So a4 is about 1.452 times a2.

Wait, but wait, no, because a4 is further out than a2, so a4 is larger. So the ratio a4/a2 is about 1.45.

But equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to a^0.5, since T ∝ (L/(a²))^(1/4) → T ∝ 1/(a^(1/2)).

So T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2) = (1 / (a4/a2) )^(1/2) = (1/1.452)^(0.5) ≈ (0.69)^(0.5) ≈ 0.83.

Wait, because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so T4 is (a2/a4)^(1/2) times T2.

So T4 = T2 * (a2/a4)^(1/2) = T2 * (2/3.5)^(1/3) ?

Wait no, wait: T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so T ∝ 1/a^0.5.

So T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(0.5)

But a4 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) * a2. So a2/a4 = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3)

So T4/T2 = (4/7)^(2/3 * 0.5) = (4/7)^(1/3)

Wait: 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. So (0.5714)^(1/3). Let me think about that. 

Cube root of 0.5714. Well, 0.8^3 is 0.512, 0.82^3 is about 0.82*0.82=0.6724, *0.82 → ~0.551, which is 0.82^3≈0.551. So 0.551 is a little higher than 0.5714? Wait no, 0.551 is less than 0.5714. Wait wait, I think I got that wrong. Let me calculate 0.83^3: 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889; 0.6889 * 0.83 ≈ 0.5717. Oh, so 0.83^3 ≈ ~0.5717, which is very close to 4/7 (≈0.5714). So the cube root of 4/7 is approximately 0.83. Therefore, T4/T2 ≈ 0.83. 

So the ratio is about 0.83, which is option C.

To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis \( a \), i.e., \( T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \). The semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) via Kepler's third law: \( a \propto P^{2/3} \). 

Given the orbital period ratios of the planets as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, we can express the semi-major axes of Planet_2 and Planet_4 as:

\[
a_2 \propto P_2^{2/3}, \quad a_4 \propto P_4^{2/3}.
\]

For Planet_2, \( P_2 = 2P_1 \), and for Planet_4, \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \). Thus, the ratio of their semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{3.5}{2}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{7}{4}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

Simplifying further, \( \frac{7}{4} = 1.75 \), so:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = 1.75^{2/3}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln(1.75) \approx 0.5596, \quad \frac{2}{3} \ln(1.75) \approx 0.373, \quad \text{and} \quad e^{0.373} \approx 1.452.
\]

Thus, \( \frac{a_4}{a_2} \approx 1.452 \).

Since \( T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \), the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\frac{a_4}{a_2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1.452}}.
\]

Approximating \( \frac{1}{1.452} \approx 0.69 \), we find:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{0.69} \approx 0.83.
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.

Okay, so I need to figure out the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2. Let me think about this step by step. 

First, I remember that equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity and the planet's distance from the star. The formula I think is T = T_star * sqrt(R_star/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo)/sigma )^0.25 or something like that. Wait, no, maybe it's simpler. Oh right, the basic formula is T = T_eff * (L / (16 pi sigma a²))^0.25. Wait, no, I think the equilibrium temperature is proportional to (L/(a²))^(1/4), assuming a circular orbit and ignoring other factors like greenhouse effect or albedo. Oh but wait, the problem says all planets have the same albedo, so that cancels out. So I can ignore albedo for this problem.

The key thing is the distance from the star. But wait, the planets are in orbital resonance with periods in a ratio 1:2:2.5:3.5:5. So Planet_1 has period P_1, Planet_2 has 2P_1, Planet_3 has 2.5P_1, Planet_4 is 3.5P_1, and Planet_5 is 5P_1.

The orbital period and distance are related by Kepler's third law: P² is proportional to a³. So a = (P^2)^(1/3) * constant. But because we're dealing with ratios, maybe I can express a_2 in terms of a_1, and a_4 in terms of a_1, then take the ratio a_4/a_2.

Let me write this out. Let’s denote a_i as the semi-major axis (distance) of planet i. 

For Planet_1: P1 = P
So a1 = (P^2 * (G M / (4 pi²)) )^(1/3) → but since all planets orbit the same star, the constant (G M/(4 pi²)) is the same for all. So a_i is proportional to P_i^(2/3).

So the ratio a_i / a_j is (P_i / P_j)^(2/3).

Wait, because a ∝ P^(2/3), so a_i = k * P_i^(2/3), where k is a constant. So a_i / a_j = (P_i / P_j)^(2/3).

So for Planet_4, which has period 3.5 P1, and Planet_2 with period 2 P1.

So a_2 = k * (2 P1)^(2/3)
a_4 = k * (3.5 P1)^(2/3)

The ratio a4/a2 = (3.5/2)^(2/3)

Wait, 3.5 is 7/2, so 3.5/2 is 7/4. So (7/4)^(2/3). Let me compute that.

Wait, 7/4 is 1.75. So I can compute 1.75^(2/3). Hmm, what's that approximately?

Alternatively, taking natural logs: ln(1.75) ≈ 0.5596. Multiply by (2/3), you get about 0.373. Then exponentiate e^0.373 ≈ 1.452.

Wait, but let me double-check: 1.75^ (2/3) = e^( (2/3)*ln(1.75) )

ln(1.75) is about 0.5596. So 2/3 of that is around 0.373. e^0.373 is approximately 1.452. So a4 is about 1.452 times a2.

Wait, but wait, no, because a4 is further out than a2, so a4 is larger. So the ratio a4/a2 is about 1.45.

But equilibrium temperature T is inversely proportional to a^0.5, since T ∝ (L/(a²))^(1/4) → T ∝ 1/(a^(1/2)).

So T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(1/2) = (1 / (a4/a2) )^(1/2) = (1/1.452)^(0.5) ≈ (0.69)^(0.5) ≈ 0.83.

Wait, because T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so T4 is (a2/a4)^(1/2) times T2.

So T4 = T2 * (a2/a4)^(1/2) = T2 * (2/3.5)^(1/3) ?

Wait no, wait: T is proportional to 1/sqrt(a), so T ∝ 1/a^0.5.

So T4 / T2 = (a2 / a4)^(0.5)

But a4 = (3.5/2)^(2/3) * a2. So a2/a4 = (2/3.5)^(2/3) = (4/7)^(2/3)

So T4/T2 = (4/7)^(2/3 * 0.5) = (4/7)^(1/3)

Wait: 4/7 is approximately 0.5714. So (0.5714)^(1/3). Let me think about that. 

Cube root of 0.5714. Well, 0.8^3 is 0.512, 0.82^3 is about 0.82*0.82=0.6724, *0.82 → ~0.551, which is 0.82^3≈0.551. So 0.551 is a little higher than 0.5714? Wait no, 0.551 is less than 0.5714. Wait wait, I think I got that wrong. Let me calculate 0.83^3: 0.83 * 0.83 = 0.6889; 0.6889 * 0.83 ≈ 0.5717. Oh, so 0.83^3 ≈ ~0.5717, which is very close to 4/7 (≈0.5714). So the cube root of 4/7 is approximately 0.83. Therefore, T4/T2 ≈ 0.83. 

So the ratio is about 0.83, which is option C.


To determine the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2, we start by noting that equilibrium temperature \( T \) is inversely proportional to the square root of the semi-major axis \( a \), i.e., \( T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \). The semi-major axis \( a \) is related to the orbital period \( P \) via Kepler's third law: \( a \propto P^{2/3} \). 

Given the orbital period ratios of the planets as 1:2:2.5:3.5:5, we can express the semi-major axes of Planet_2 and Planet_4 as:

\[
a_2 \propto P_2^{2/3}, \quad a_4 \propto P_4^{2/3}.
\]

For Planet_2, \( P_2 = 2P_1 \), and for Planet_4, \( P_4 = 3.5P_1 \). Thus, the ratio of their semi-major axes is:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = \left(\frac{P_4}{P_2}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{3.5}{2}\right)^{2/3} = \left(\frac{7}{4}\right)^{2/3}.
\]

Simplifying further, \( \frac{7}{4} = 1.75 \), so:

\[
\frac{a_4}{a_2} = 1.75^{2/3}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln(1.75) \approx 0.5596, \quad \frac{2}{3} \ln(1.75) \approx 0.373, \quad \text{and} \quad e^{0.373} \approx 1.452.
\]

Thus, \( \frac{a_4}{a_2} \approx 1.452 \).

Since \( T \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{a}} \), the ratio of equilibrium temperatures is:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_4}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\frac{a_4}{a_2}}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1.452}}.
\]

Approximating \( \frac{1}{1.452} \approx 0.69 \), we find:

\[
\frac{T_4}{T_2} = \sqrt{0.69} \approx 0.83.
\]

Thus, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet_4 and Planet_2 is approximately 0.83.
