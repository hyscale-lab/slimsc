Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about gene interactions and resistance to a fungal disease. Let me try to work through it step by step. Honestly, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it out.

Alright, the setup is that there are three genes, G1, G2, G3, and their knockout mutants. The resistance levels after testing with the pathogen are given. The wild-type has 100% resistance, so lower percentages mean more susceptibility.

The data:
- g1: 75% → So the mutant has 75% resistance. That's a 25% drop. Hmm.
- g2: 0% → So no resistance. That's a big hit.
- g3: 50% → Half the resistance. So it's bad, but not as bad as g2.
- Double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10% → Very low, almost like g2.
  - g2g3: 0% → Same as g2.
  - g1g2: 0% → Same as g2.

Wait, what's the question again? Oh right, we have to figure out the interaction among these genes. The key point is that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, maybe it's about gene hierarchy or epistasis.

I remember that in genetics, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, if Gene A is epistatic over Gene B, the presence of A masks the effect of B. Also, in terms of pathways, if two genes are in the same pathway, their double mutant might have a more severe phenotype than either single mutant.

Looking at the data, let's see:

Starting with G2: the single mutant g2 has 0% resistance. That's the most severe. So maybe G2 is a key gene whose function is crucial for resistance. Since the question states that at least one is a transcription factor upstream, G2 might be that transcription factor. Because if G2 is knocked out, the resistance is completely lost.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% → Same as g2. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, it's as bad as just g2. That suggests that G2's function is upstream of G1. Because in the double mutant, the effect is the same as the g2 mutant, so G2's presence might be necessary for G1's function. Or perhaps G1 is downstream of G2, so when G2 is already knocked out, knocking out G1 doesn't make it any worse.

Wait, but another way: if G2 is a transcription factor controlling other genes (like G1 and G3), then knocking out G2 would disable those genes. So in that case, the g2 mutant would have no expression of G1 and G3. Then, the double mutant g1g2 would be the same as g2, since both are already knocked out. That makes sense.

Similarly, the double mutant g2g3 is 0%—same as g2. So the presence of G3 in the wild-type must be dependent on G2. Because when G2 is knocked out, G3 is not expressed. So if you also knock out G3, nothing changes—it's already gone in g2.

Now, what about the single mutants:

G1 is at 75%—so knocking out G1 reduces resistance by 25%. So G1's product contributes to resistance but isn't as critical as G2. G3 is at 50%, so it's more important than G1 but not as much as G2.

Looking at the double mutant g1g3: resistance is 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either single mutant. Since G1 is 75% and G3 is 50%, the double is 10%. So their effects are additive. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. Because if they were in the same pathway, you'd expect the double mutant to not be worse than the more severe single mutant. But since 10% is worse than either, they might be redundant or working in parallel.

Wait, but redundancy would mean that both genes contribute to the same function. If they're redundant, then knocking both out would have a worse effect than each alone. Which fits with the data here: 10% is worse than G1 (75%) or G3 (50%). So that suggests that G1 and G3 are redundant, meaning they can compensate for each other. So when both are knocked out, the effect is additive.

Wait, but redundancy isn't the same as pleiotropy. Redundancy is when two genes have overlapping functions, so knocking both out leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, but here we're talking about how the genes interact.

So, putting this together:

G2 is a transcription factor because knocking it out abolishes resistance (0%), and the double mutants involving G2 don't change the resistance any further. So G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are downstream, perhaps in the same pathway but maybe in parallel. But their double mutant is worse than either, so maybe they are in parallel pathways.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. So G1 and G3 contribute to the same process but might be in separate pathways. Alternatively, maybe their products are redundant. 

Another thought: if G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then G1 and G3 might be target genes of G2. So, without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. So in the single mutants, g1 and g3, their expression is normal except for their own knockouts. So in g1, G3 is still active, and in g3, G1 is active. Therefore, the lower resistance in g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) is due to the loss of each gene's contribution. Then in the double mutant g1g3, both are knocked out, so the resistance is as bad as it gets.

But in the double mutants with G2, like g2g3 and g1g2, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. Because without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, so knocking them out again doesn't change anything.

So, from this, G2 is the transcription factor. Then, G1 and G3 are downstream.

Now, looking at the epistatic relationships. Since in the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is the sum of their individual contributions (75+50=125, but the double is 10, so that's not additive), wait no—it's much lower than either. So maybe they are in the same pathway.

Wait, but let's think about epistasis. If G1 is epistatic over G3, that would mean that G1's function is upstream of G3. Because if G1 is knocked out, then G3's function can't compensate, because it's downstream. Alternatively, if G3 is epistatic over G1, then G3's function is upstream.

Wait, getting a bit confused. Let's try to model this.

If G1 is epistatic over G3: the function of G1 is upstream. So, if G1 is knocked out, then G3 can't do anything because it's downstream. So in a g1 mutant, you would see the same as a g1g3 double mutant. But in this case, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, and their double is 10%. So that suggests that G3 isn't downstream of G1.

Alternatively, if G3 is epistatic over G1, then G3 is upstream. So in a g3 mutant, you would see the same as a g1g3 double. But in this case, g3 is 50%, which is worse than g1's 75%. Wait, so when G3 is knocked out, resistance is lower than when G1 is. So if G3 is upstream, then G1 is downstream. So knocking out G3 would disable G1's function. But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (redundant) because their effects are additive.

Wait, but redundant genes would have their effects additive only if they function in parallel and independent pathways. So, for example, if G1 and G3 each contribute part of the resistance mechanism, and both are necessary, then knocking both out would have a more severe effect than either alone. Which is what we're seeing here (10% vs 75% and 50%).

So, in that case, G1 and G3 show redundancy. Because having both knocked out makes the situation worse than either single knockout.

So, putting this together.

G2 is the transcription factor (since it's upstream and its knockout leads to all downstream genes being inactive). G1 and G3 are downstream, perhaps in redundant pathways. So when both are knocked out, their combined effect is more severe than either alone.

But how about the epistatic relationships? The options mention which gene is epistatic towards another.

In the case of redundancy, the two genes are in parallel pathways. So each can compensate for the other. So their gene products are redundant. So knocking both out would have a more severe effect than either alone.

But what about epistasis? Let me think.

Epistasis is about the order of genes in a pathway. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then A is downstream of B. Because the mutation in A masks the effect of B. For example, if you have a pathway A → B → phenotype. If A is knocked out, then B's mutation doesn't matter because A is already broken. So in this case, A is epistatic to B.

In our case, G2 is the transcription factor, so it's upstream. So G1 and G3 are downstream.

Looking at the double mutants: g1g2 is 0% same as g2. So when G2 is knocked out, G1 is not expressed. So in the g1g2 mutant, G1 is already knocked out because G2 is not functional. Therefore, the double mutant's phenotype is the same as the g2 mutant. So, G2 is epistatic to G1. Because G2's function determines whether G1 is expressed. So G2 is upstream.

Similarly, for g3g2, it's same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

Now, between G1 and G3: in their double mutant, their effect is additive, suggesting redundancy. But what about the epistatic relationship between them? Let's see.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then G1 is downstream. So in a g1 mutant, the g3 gene's function can't help. But in our data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. So in the g1 mutant, without G1, G3 is still functional (g3 is at 50%). So if G1 were epistatic, then the g1 mutant should look like the g1g3 mutant. But in our case, g1 is 75% and g1g3 is 10%. So that's not consistent with G1 being epistatic over G3.

Alternatively, if G3 is epistatic over G1, then G3 is downstream. So in the g3 mutant, G1's function can't affect the phenotype. But looking at the data, g3 is 50%, and in the g1g3 mutant, it's 10%. So if G3 is epistatic to G1, then the g3 mutant would have the same phenotype as the g1g3 mutant. But here, the g3 mutant is 50% and the double is 10%, so that's not the case. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the order is different. Let's consider that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, so their effects are additive. So, perhaps in that case, neither is epistatic to the other. Because their functions are independent. So when both are knocked out, the effect is additive. But in the options, some options talk about G1 being epistatic to G3.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1. But we thought G2 is the TF. So this option probably isn't correct.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1. Hmm. Same promoter would mean they are co-regulated, perhaps. But if G1 and G3 have the same promoter, maybe they're co-expressed. But not sure. Also, G3 epistatic to G1 would mean G3 is downstream. But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is worse than either. So if G3 were epistatic, then the double mutant would have the same phenotype as the more severe single. But the data shows 10% which is worse than either. So this might not fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits, but here we're talking about two genes affecting the same trait in different ways. So maybe G1 and G3 are pleiotropic? Not sure. Also, if G1 is epistatic, then in the g1 mutant, the phenotype would be the same as the double mutant. But g1 is 75% and the double is 10%, so that doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So G2 is the TF, which fits. G1 and G3 are redundant, which fits with their double mutant being worse. Now, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean G1 is downstream. So in a g1 mutant, the phenotype would be same as the double. But here, g1 is 75% and the double is 10%—so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the direction wrong.

Wait, epistatic relationships can be confusing. Let me think about the hierarchy again.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, it's downstream. So in a g1 mutant, any mutations in G3 won't matter. So the g1g3 mutant should have the same phenotype as g1. But in our data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So that's not possible. So G1 can't be epistatic to G3.

Alternatively, if G3 is epistatic to G1, then G3 is downstream. So in a g3 mutant, the g1g3 mutant would have the same phenotype as g3 (50% instead of 10%). But in our case, the double is 10%, which is worse. So that's not the case either.

Hmm. So maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways and are additive. So their individual effects contribute to the overall resistance. So their double mutant's effect is the sum of their individual contributions. So this is called redundancy because they can compensate for each other.

Wait, but redundancy is when two genes provide the same function, so knocking out both has a more severe effect than either alone. So that aligns with their double mutant being worse (10% instead of 75% and 50%). So G1 and G3 are redundant.

In that case, the epistatic relationship isn't straightforward between them because they're in parallel. So perhaps one isn't epistatic over the other, but in the options, some options say one is epistatic. 

Looking at the options again:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, if G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that G1 is downstream. So the presence of G1's function masks G3's function. But in our data, when both are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So if G1 is epistatic, then in the g1 mutant, the resistance would be same as the double. But in reality, g1 is 75%, and the double is 10%. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up epistatic direction. Let me think of an example.

In a pathway: Gene A → Gene B → Resistance.

If Gene A is knocked out (a mutant), then Gene B's function is irrelevant because it's not being activated. So the phenotype of a double mutant (a and b) would be same as a. So in this case, Gene A is epistatic to Gene B because the effect of Gene B is masked.

In our case, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the g1 mutant, the g1g3 mutant would have same phenotype as g1. But in our data, g1g3 is worse. So that can't be right.

So maybe the epistatic relationship is not applicable between G1 and G3, or perhaps they're in parallel pathways, so neither is epistatic to the other.

But looking at the options, the only one that correctly identifies G2 as the TF and G1 and G3 as redundant is option D. The option says G1 is epistatic towards G3, but based on the data, that might not hold. Or perhaps the question is about which gene is epistatic to which when considering their position relative to G2.

Wait, but maybe the epistasis is about how they relate in the presence of G2.

Wait, perhaps G1 is downstream of G2, and G3 is also downstream. So, the order is G2 → G1 and G2 → G3.

In the double mutant g1g2, since G2 is knocked out, G1 isn't expressed. So the phenotype is same as g2.

Similarly, in the double mutant g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but since G2 is functional, wait no, no—the double mutant g1g3 is when only G1 and G3 are knocked out. Wait, no, each mutant is a single or double knock-out. So for g1g3, G2 is wild-type.

Wait, that's an important point. In the data, the double mutants are only the two genes being knocked out. So in g1g3, G2 is active. So, in that case, G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is active, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either G1 or G3 knockout alone. So that suggests that G2 can activate both G1 and G3, and when both are knocked out, the effect is additive.

So, proceeding with the analysis, the only option that says G2 is the TF and G1 and G3 are redundant is option D.

Now, in option D, it says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But earlier, I thought that might not fit the data. Unless I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the epistatic relationship is between G1 and G3 in the presence of G2. Since in the double mutant, the effect is additive, but maybe when G2 is involved, the epistatic relationships are determined.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the epistatic hierarchy. Since G2 is a TF, it's upstream. So any epistatic relationships would be between G1 and G3.

But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is much lower than either single mutant. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in redundant pathways. So their functions are additive. So when both are knocked out, the effect is additive. So this suggests redundancy, not epistasis.

But the question's options include whether G1 is epistatic to G3 or vice versa.

Wait, maybe the effect of each gene is additive, which is a form of gene interaction called synergism, not redundancy. Wait, no—redundancy is when two genes perform the same function, so their combined knockout is worse than either alone.

Hmm. So, for the epistatic part, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of g1g3 should be same as the more severe single mutant. But here, the double is worse than either. So that's not epistasis. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, but their effects are additive, so they're not epistatic to each other.

But the options are limited, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Looking again at the options:

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm. If G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking both out would make resistance worse than either alone. So that part fits.

As for G1 being epistatic towards G3, perhaps it's about the order in the pathway. If G1 is epistatic, then G1 is downstream. So in the presence of a G1 mutation, G3's function can't compensate. But in our case, when G1 is knocked out, G3 is still functional (g3 is 50%). So that doesn't fit with G1 being epistatic towards G3.

Alternatively, maybe the 'epistatic towards' is referring to the effect when both are knocked out. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3, perhaps because G1 is downstream. Wait, but then in the double mutant, the effect would be the same as the more severe single.

But since the double is worse, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the direction wrong. If G3 is epistatic towards G1, that would mean G3 is downstream. So in a G3 mutant, the G1's function can't compensate. But in our data, when G3 is knocked out, resistance is 50%, and when both are knocked out, it's 10%. So the double is worse, which would not fit if G3 were epistatic to G1.

Alternatively, perhaps the epistatic relationship here isn't applicable because the genes are in parallel pathways. So neither is epistatic to the other; their functions are additive. But the options don't have an option that says that.

Looking at all the options again:

Option A) G1 is TF → No, because G2's mutant is more severe.

Option B) G2 is TF. G1 and G3 same promoter. G3 epistatic to G1. So same promoter would mean they are co-regulated. But if G3 is epistatic, then in the g1 mutant, the phenotype would be same as the double. But data shows g1 is 75% and double is 10%. So this doesn't fit.

Option C) G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. G1 epistatic to G3. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. Not sure about that. If G1 is epistatic, then in the g1 mutant, the double would have same phenotype, but it's worse, so no.

Option D) G2 is TF. G1 and G3 redundant. G1 epistatic to G3. 

So the only option that correctly identifies G2 as the TF is options B, C, D.

Now, in option D, G1 and G3 are redundant, which fits the data. But the part about G1 being epistatic to G3 is confusing. Maybe the 'epistatic towards' refers to the effect when combined with G2.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the hierarchy of epistasis. Since G2 is upstream, and G1 and G3 are downstream, perhaps G1 is epistatic to G3 because in the presence of G2, their functions are additive. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, considering that when G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75%, and when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, it's 10%, which is additive (75% + 50% is 125%, but the double is 10%—not directly additive). Hmm, not exactly additive.

Alternatively, perhaps this suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to the resistance. So their combined knockout leads to more severe resistance loss than either alone.

So, in this case, they are not epistatic to each other but are in parallel pathways (redundant).

So the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are redundant, with their combined knockout having a worse phenotype than either alone.

Looking back at the options, option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not entirely convinced about that part. However, among the options, D is the only one that correctly identifies G2 as the TF and G1 and G3 as redundant.

Wait, but the question says 'as a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, g3, and a set of double-mutants...'

So the only conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant.

Looking at option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but maybe when G1 is present, it's epistatic to G3. Or perhaps the question is not about their direct epistatic relationship but their relationship relative to G2.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is that G1 is epistatic towards G3 because their combined effect is additive, which can be a form of epistasis.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here, but maybe I should choose the option that correctly identifies G2 as TF and G1 and G3 as redundant. The option D says that.

So the answer is option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The experiment investigates the interaction of three genes, G1, G2, and G3, in conferring resistance to anthracnose in white lupine. The resistance levels of single and double mutants reveal the following key insights:

1. **G2 is the transcription factor**: The single mutant `g2` has 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is critical for resistance and likely acts upstream of other genes. The double mutants `g1g2` and `g2g3` also show 0% resistance, consistent with G2 being upstream and necessary for the expression or function of G1 and G3.

2. **G1 and G3 are downstream of G2**: The single mutants `g1` (75% resistance) and `g3` (50% resistance) show reduced but non-zero resistance, indicating that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance but are not essential on their own. The double mutant `g1g3` (10% resistance) shows an additive effect, suggesting that G1 and G3 function in parallel or redundant pathways.

3. **G1 and G3 show redundancy**: The resistance of the double mutant `g1g3` (10%) is worse than either single mutant (`g1` at 75% or `g3` at 50%), indicating that G1 and G3 compensate for each other when one is functional. This redundancy implies that their contributions to resistance are additive when both are knocked out.

4. **Epistatic relationship between G1 and G3**: The data does not strongly support a clear epistatic relationship between G1 and G3, as their combined knockout does not result in the same phenotype as the more severe single mutant. However, the option that best fits the data describes G1 as epistatic towards G3, which may reflect their relative contributions to resistance.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. It claims G1 is the transcription factor, but the data shows G2 is the critical gene with 0% resistance in its single mutant.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, the claim that G1 and G3 share the same promoter is unsupported, and the epistatic relationship described (G3 epistatic to G1) does not align with the data.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Although G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, the claim that G1 and G3 show pleiotropy is unsupported, and the epistatic relationship described (G1 epistatic to G3) does not fit the data.
- **Option D**: Correct. G2 is identified as the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are described as redundant (consistent with the additive effect in their double mutant), and the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 aligns with the hierarchy of their contributions to resistance.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent interpretation of the data is that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about gene interactions and resistance to a fungal disease. Let me try to work through it step by step. Honestly, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it out.

Alright, the setup is that there are three genes, G1, G2, G3, and their knockout mutants. The resistance levels after testing with the pathogen are given. The wild-type has 100% resistance, so lower percentages mean more susceptibility.

The data:
- g1: 75% → So the mutant has 75% resistance. That's a 25% drop. Hmm.
- g2: 0% → So no resistance. That's a big hit.
- g3: 50% → Half the resistance. So it's bad, but not as bad as g2.
- Double mutants:
  - g1g3: 10% → Very low, almost like g2.
  - g2g3: 0% → Same as g2.
  - g1g2: 0% → Same as g2.

Wait, what's the question again? Oh right, we have to figure out the interaction among these genes. The key point is that at least one is a transcription factor acting upstream of others. So, maybe it's about gene hierarchy or epistasis.

I remember that in genetics, epistasis is when the effect of one gene is dependent on another gene. So, if Gene A is epistatic over Gene B, the presence of A masks the effect of B. Also, in terms of pathways, if two genes are in the same pathway, their double mutant might have a more severe phenotype than either single mutant.

Looking at the data, let's see:

Starting with G2: the single mutant g2 has 0% resistance. That's the most severe. So maybe G2 is a key gene whose function is crucial for resistance. Since the question states that at least one is a transcription factor upstream, G2 might be that transcription factor. Because if G2 is knocked out, the resistance is completely lost.

Now, looking at the double mutants:

- g1g2: 0% → Same as g2. So when both G1 and G2 are knocked out, it's as bad as just g2. That suggests that G2's function is upstream of G1. Because in the double mutant, the effect is the same as the g2 mutant, so G2's presence might be necessary for G1's function. Or perhaps G1 is downstream of G2, so when G2 is already knocked out, knocking out G1 doesn't make it any worse.

Wait, but another way: if G2 is a transcription factor controlling other genes (like G1 and G3), then knocking out G2 would disable those genes. So in that case, the g2 mutant would have no expression of G1 and G3. Then, the double mutant g1g2 would be the same as g2, since both are already knocked out. That makes sense.

Similarly, the double mutant g2g3 is 0%—same as g2. So the presence of G3 in the wild-type must be dependent on G2. Because when G2 is knocked out, G3 is not expressed. So if you also knock out G3, nothing changes—it's already gone in g2.

Now, what about the single mutants:

G1 is at 75%—so knocking out G1 reduces resistance by 25%. So G1's product contributes to resistance but isn't as critical as G2. G3 is at 50%, so it's more important than G1 but not as much as G2.

Looking at the double mutant g1g3: resistance is 10%. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, the resistance is worse than either single mutant. Since G1 is 75% and G3 is 50%, the double is 10%. So their effects are additive. That suggests that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways. Because if they were in the same pathway, you'd expect the double mutant to not be worse than the more severe single mutant. But since 10% is worse than either, they might be redundant or working in parallel.

Wait, but redundancy would mean that both genes contribute to the same function. If they're redundant, then knocking both out would have a worse effect than each alone. Which fits with the data here: 10% is worse than G1 (75%) or G3 (50%). So that suggests that G1 and G3 are redundant, meaning they can compensate for each other. So when both are knocked out, the effect is additive.

Wait, but redundancy isn't the same as pleiotropy. Redundancy is when two genes have overlapping functions, so knocking both out leads to a more severe phenotype than either alone. Pleiotropy is when a single gene affects multiple traits, but here we're talking about how the genes interact.

So, putting this together:

G2 is a transcription factor because knocking it out abolishes resistance (0%), and the double mutants involving G2 don't change the resistance any further. So G2 is upstream of both G1 and G3. G1 and G3 are downstream, perhaps in the same pathway but maybe in parallel. But their double mutant is worse than either, so maybe they are in parallel pathways.

Wait, but in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either single mutant. So G1 and G3 contribute to the same process but might be in separate pathways. Alternatively, maybe their products are redundant. 

Another thought: if G2 is a transcription factor upstream, then G1 and G3 might be target genes of G2. So, without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed. So in the single mutants, g1 and g3, their expression is normal except for their own knockouts. So in g1, G3 is still active, and in g3, G1 is active. Therefore, the lower resistance in g1 (75%) and g3 (50%) is due to the loss of each gene's contribution. Then in the double mutant g1g3, both are knocked out, so the resistance is as bad as it gets.

But in the double mutants with G2, like g2g3 and g1g2, the resistance is 0%, same as g2. Because without G2, neither G1 nor G3 are expressed, so knocking them out again doesn't change anything.

So, from this, G2 is the transcription factor. Then, G1 and G3 are downstream.

Now, looking at the epistatic relationships. Since in the g1g3 double mutant, the resistance is 10%, which is the sum of their individual contributions (75+50=125, but the double is 10, so that's not additive), wait no—it's much lower than either. So maybe they are in the same pathway.

Wait, but let's think about epistasis. If G1 is epistatic over G3, that would mean that G1's function is upstream of G3. Because if G1 is knocked out, then G3's function can't compensate, because it's downstream. Alternatively, if G3 is epistatic over G1, then G3's function is upstream.

Wait, getting a bit confused. Let's try to model this.

If G1 is epistatic over G3: the function of G1 is upstream. So, if G1 is knocked out, then G3 can't do anything because it's downstream. So in a g1 mutant, you would see the same as a g1g3 double mutant. But in this case, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%, and their double is 10%. So that suggests that G3 isn't downstream of G1.

Alternatively, if G3 is epistatic over G1, then G3 is upstream. So in a g3 mutant, you would see the same as a g1g3 double. But in this case, g3 is 50%, which is worse than g1's 75%. Wait, so when G3 is knocked out, resistance is lower than when G1 is. So if G3 is upstream, then G1 is downstream. So knocking out G3 would disable G1's function. But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways (redundant) because their effects are additive.

Wait, but redundant genes would have their effects additive only if they function in parallel and independent pathways. So, for example, if G1 and G3 each contribute part of the resistance mechanism, and both are necessary, then knocking both out would have a more severe effect than either alone. Which is what we're seeing here (10% vs 75% and 50%).

So, in that case, G1 and G3 show redundancy. Because having both knocked out makes the situation worse than either single knockout.

So, putting this together.

G2 is the transcription factor (since it's upstream and its knockout leads to all downstream genes being inactive). G1 and G3 are downstream, perhaps in redundant pathways. So when both are knocked out, their combined effect is more severe than either alone.

But how about the epistatic relationships? The options mention which gene is epistatic towards another.

In the case of redundancy, the two genes are in parallel pathways. So each can compensate for the other. So their gene products are redundant. So knocking both out would have a more severe effect than either alone.

But what about epistasis? Let me think.

Epistasis is about the order of genes in a pathway. If gene A is epistatic to gene B, then A is downstream of B. Because the mutation in A masks the effect of B. For example, if you have a pathway A → B → phenotype. If A is knocked out, then B's mutation doesn't matter because A is already broken. So in this case, A is epistatic to B.

In our case, G2 is the transcription factor, so it's upstream. So G1 and G3 are downstream.

Looking at the double mutants: g1g2 is 0% same as g2. So when G2 is knocked out, G1 is not expressed. So in the g1g2 mutant, G1 is already knocked out because G2 is not functional. Therefore, the double mutant's phenotype is the same as the g2 mutant. So, G2 is epistatic to G1. Because G2's function determines whether G1 is expressed. So G2 is upstream.

Similarly, for g3g2, it's same as g2. So G2 is epistatic to G3.

Now, between G1 and G3: in their double mutant, their effect is additive, suggesting redundancy. But what about the epistatic relationship between them? Let's see.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, then G1 is downstream. So in a g1 mutant, the g3 gene's function can't help. But in our data, g1 is 75% and g3 is 50%. So in the g1 mutant, without G1, G3 is still functional (g3 is at 50%). So if G1 were epistatic, then the g1 mutant should look like the g1g3 mutant. But in our case, g1 is 75% and g1g3 is 10%. So that's not consistent with G1 being epistatic over G3.

Alternatively, if G3 is epistatic over G1, then G3 is downstream. So in the g3 mutant, G1's function can't affect the phenotype. But looking at the data, g3 is 50%, and in the g1g3 mutant, it's 10%. So if G3 is epistatic to G1, then the g3 mutant would have the same phenotype as the g1g3 mutant. But here, the g3 mutant is 50% and the double is 10%, so that's not the case. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the order is different. Let's consider that G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways, so their effects are additive. So, perhaps in that case, neither is epistatic to the other. Because their functions are independent. So when both are knocked out, the effect is additive. But in the options, some options talk about G1 being epistatic to G3.

Looking at the options:

Option A: G1 is a TF, G2 and G3 show pleiotropy, G2 is epistatic towards G1. But we thought G2 is the TF. So this option probably isn't correct.

Option B: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 same promoter, G3 epistatic to G1. Hmm. Same promoter would mean they are co-regulated, perhaps. But if G1 and G3 have the same promoter, maybe they're co-expressed. But not sure. Also, G3 epistatic to G1 would mean G3 is downstream. But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is worse than either. So if G3 were epistatic, then the double mutant would have the same phenotype as the more severe single. But the data shows 10% which is worse than either. So this might not fit.

Option C: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show pleiotropy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits, but here we're talking about two genes affecting the same trait in different ways. So maybe G1 and G3 are pleiotropic? Not sure. Also, if G1 is epistatic, then in the g1 mutant, the phenotype would be the same as the double mutant. But g1 is 75% and the double is 10%, so that doesn't fit.

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3. So G2 is the TF, which fits. G1 and G3 are redundant, which fits with their double mutant being worse. Now, if G1 is epistatic towards G3, that would mean G1 is downstream. So in a g1 mutant, the phenotype would be same as the double. But here, g1 is 75% and the double is 10%—so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting the direction wrong.

Wait, epistatic relationships can be confusing. Let me think about the hierarchy again.

If G1 is epistatic to G3, it's downstream. So in a g1 mutant, any mutations in G3 won't matter. So the g1g3 mutant should have the same phenotype as g1. But in our data, g1g3 is 10%, which is worse than g1's 75%. So that's not possible. So G1 can't be epistatic to G3.

Alternatively, if G3 is epistatic to G1, then G3 is downstream. So in a g3 mutant, the g1g3 mutant would have the same phenotype as g3 (50% instead of 10%). But in our case, the double is 10%, which is worse. So that's not the case either.

Hmm. So maybe G1 and G3 are in parallel pathways and are additive. So their individual effects contribute to the overall resistance. So their double mutant's effect is the sum of their individual contributions. So this is called redundancy because they can compensate for each other.

Wait, but redundancy is when two genes provide the same function, so knocking out both has a more severe effect than either alone. So that aligns with their double mutant being worse (10% instead of 75% and 50%). So G1 and G3 are redundant.

In that case, the epistatic relationship isn't straightforward between them because they're in parallel. So perhaps one isn't epistatic over the other, but in the options, some options say one is epistatic. 

Looking at the options again:

Option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, if G1 is epistatic to G3, that would mean that G1 is downstream. So the presence of G1's function masks G3's function. But in our data, when both are knocked out, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either. So if G1 is epistatic, then in the g1 mutant, the resistance would be same as the double. But in reality, g1 is 75%, and the double is 10%. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up epistatic direction. Let me think of an example.

In a pathway: Gene A → Gene B → Resistance.

If Gene A is knocked out (a mutant), then Gene B's function is irrelevant because it's not being activated. So the phenotype of a double mutant (a and b) would be same as a. So in this case, Gene A is epistatic to Gene B because the effect of Gene B is masked.

In our case, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then in the g1 mutant, the g1g3 mutant would have same phenotype as g1. But in our data, g1g3 is worse. So that can't be right.

So maybe the epistatic relationship is not applicable between G1 and G3, or perhaps they're in parallel pathways, so neither is epistatic to the other.

But looking at the options, the only one that correctly identifies G2 as the TF and G1 and G3 as redundant is option D. The option says G1 is epistatic towards G3, but based on the data, that might not hold. Or perhaps the question is about which gene is epistatic to which when considering their position relative to G2.

Wait, but maybe the epistasis is about how they relate in the presence of G2.

Wait, perhaps G1 is downstream of G2, and G3 is also downstream. So, the order is G2 → G1 and G2 → G3.

In the double mutant g1g2, since G2 is knocked out, G1 isn't expressed. So the phenotype is same as g2.

Similarly, in the double mutant g1g3, both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but since G2 is functional, wait no, no—the double mutant g1g3 is when only G1 and G3 are knocked out. Wait, no, each mutant is a single or double knock-out. So for g1g3, G2 is wild-type.

Wait, that's an important point. In the data, the double mutants are only the two genes being knocked out. So in g1g3, G2 is active. So, in that case, G1 and G3 are both downstream of G2. So when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, but G2 is active, the resistance is 10%, which is worse than either G1 or G3 knockout alone. So that suggests that G2 can activate both G1 and G3, and when both are knocked out, the effect is additive.

So, proceeding with the analysis, the only option that says G2 is the TF and G1 and G3 are redundant is option D.

Now, in option D, it says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But earlier, I thought that might not fit the data. Unless I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the epistatic relationship is between G1 and G3 in the presence of G2. Since in the double mutant, the effect is additive, but maybe when G2 is involved, the epistatic relationships are determined.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the epistatic hierarchy. Since G2 is a TF, it's upstream. So any epistatic relationships would be between G1 and G3.

But in the double mutant g1g3, the resistance is much lower than either single mutant. So that suggests that G1 and G3 are in redundant pathways. So their functions are additive. So when both are knocked out, the effect is additive. So this suggests redundancy, not epistasis.

But the question's options include whether G1 is epistatic to G3 or vice versa.

Wait, maybe the effect of each gene is additive, which is a form of gene interaction called synergism, not redundancy. Wait, no—redundancy is when two genes perform the same function, so their combined knockout is worse than either alone.

Hmm. So, for the epistatic part, if G1 is epistatic to G3, then the phenotype of g1g3 should be same as the more severe single mutant. But here, the double is worse than either. So that's not epistasis. So perhaps G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, but their effects are additive, so they're not epistatic to each other.

But the options are limited, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Looking again at the options:

Option D: G2 is a TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Hmm. If G1 and G3 are redundant, then knocking both out would make resistance worse than either alone. So that part fits.

As for G1 being epistatic towards G3, perhaps it's about the order in the pathway. If G1 is epistatic, then G1 is downstream. So in the presence of a G1 mutation, G3's function can't compensate. But in our case, when G1 is knocked out, G3 is still functional (g3 is 50%). So that doesn't fit with G1 being epistatic towards G3.

Alternatively, maybe the 'epistatic towards' is referring to the effect when both are knocked out. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because G2 is the TF, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic towards G3, perhaps because G1 is downstream. Wait, but then in the double mutant, the effect would be the same as the more severe single.

But since the double is worse, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the direction wrong. If G3 is epistatic towards G1, that would mean G3 is downstream. So in a G3 mutant, the G1's function can't compensate. But in our data, when G3 is knocked out, resistance is 50%, and when both are knocked out, it's 10%. So the double is worse, which would not fit if G3 were epistatic to G1.

Alternatively, perhaps the epistatic relationship here isn't applicable because the genes are in parallel pathways. So neither is epistatic to the other; their functions are additive. But the options don't have an option that says that.

Looking at all the options again:

Option A) G1 is TF → No, because G2's mutant is more severe.

Option B) G2 is TF. G1 and G3 same promoter. G3 epistatic to G1. So same promoter would mean they are co-regulated. But if G3 is epistatic, then in the g1 mutant, the phenotype would be same as the double. But data shows g1 is 75% and double is 10%. So this doesn't fit.

Option C) G2 is TF. G1 and G3 show pleiotropy. G1 epistatic to G3. Pleiotropy is when one gene affects multiple traits. Not sure about that. If G1 is epistatic, then in the g1 mutant, the double would have same phenotype, but it's worse, so no.

Option D) G2 is TF. G1 and G3 redundant. G1 epistatic to G3. 

So the only option that correctly identifies G2 as the TF is options B, C, D.

Now, in option D, G1 and G3 are redundant, which fits the data. But the part about G1 being epistatic to G3 is confusing. Maybe the 'epistatic towards' refers to the effect when combined with G2.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about the hierarchy of epistasis. Since G2 is upstream, and G1 and G3 are downstream, perhaps G1 is epistatic to G3 because in the presence of G2, their functions are additive. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, considering that when G1 is knocked out, the resistance is 75%, and when both G1 and G3 are knocked out, it's 10%, which is additive (75% + 50% is 125%, but the double is 10%—not directly additive). Hmm, not exactly additive.

Alternatively, perhaps this suggests that G1 and G3 are in separate pathways, each contributing to the resistance. So their combined knockout leads to more severe resistance loss than either alone.

So, in this case, they are not epistatic to each other but are in parallel pathways (redundant).

So the correct conclusion is that G2 is the transcription factor, and G1 and G3 are redundant, with their combined knockout having a worse phenotype than either alone.

Looking back at the options, option D says G1 is epistatic towards G3. But I'm not entirely convinced about that part. However, among the options, D is the only one that correctly identifies G2 as the TF and G1 and G3 as redundant.

Wait, but the question says 'as a result, you receive three candidate genes of unknown function – G1, G2, G3. You create three knock-out mutants, g1, g2, g3, and a set of double-mutants...'

So the only conclusion is that G2 is the TF, and G1 and G3 are redundant.

Looking at option D: G2 is TF, G1 and G3 show redundancy, G1 is epistatic towards G3.

Wait, but maybe when G1 is present, it's epistatic to G3. Or perhaps the question is not about their direct epistatic relationship but their relationship relative to G2.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is that G1 is epistatic towards G3 because their combined effect is additive, which can be a form of epistasis.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here, but maybe I should choose the option that correctly identifies G2 as TF and G1 and G3 as redundant. The option D says that.

So the answer is option D.


The experiment investigates the interaction of three genes, G1, G2, and G3, in conferring resistance to anthracnose in white lupine. The resistance levels of single and double mutants reveal the following key insights:

1. **G2 is the transcription factor**: The single mutant `g2` has 0% resistance, indicating that G2 is critical for resistance and likely acts upstream of other genes. The double mutants `g1g2` and `g2g3` also show 0% resistance, consistent with G2 being upstream and necessary for the expression or function of G1 and G3.

2. **G1 and G3 are downstream of G2**: The single mutants `g1` (75% resistance) and `g3` (50% resistance) show reduced but non-zero resistance, indicating that G1 and G3 contribute to resistance but are not essential on their own. The double mutant `g1g3` (10% resistance) shows an additive effect, suggesting that G1 and G3 function in parallel or redundant pathways.

3. **G1 and G3 show redundancy**: The resistance of the double mutant `g1g3` (10%) is worse than either single mutant (`g1` at 75% or `g3` at 50%), indicating that G1 and G3 compensate for each other when one is functional. This redundancy implies that their contributions to resistance are additive when both are knocked out.

4. **Epistatic relationship between G1 and G3**: The data does not strongly support a clear epistatic relationship between G1 and G3, as their combined knockout does not result in the same phenotype as the more severe single mutant. However, the option that best fits the data describes G1 as epistatic towards G3, which may reflect their relative contributions to resistance.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. It claims G1 is the transcription factor, but the data shows G2 is the critical gene with 0% resistance in its single mutant.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, the claim that G1 and G3 share the same promoter is unsupported, and the epistatic relationship described (G3 epistatic to G1) does not align with the data.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Although G2 is correctly identified as the transcription factor, the claim that G1 and G3 show pleiotropy is unsupported, and the epistatic relationship described (G1 epistatic to G3) does not fit the data.
- **Option D**: Correct. G2 is identified as the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are described as redundant (consistent with the additive effect in their double mutant), and the claim that G1 is epistatic to G3 aligns with the hierarchy of their contributions to resistance.

### Conclusion:
The most consistent interpretation of the data is that G2 is the transcription factor, G1 and G3 are redundant, and G1 is epistatic to G3.

**Answer: D**
