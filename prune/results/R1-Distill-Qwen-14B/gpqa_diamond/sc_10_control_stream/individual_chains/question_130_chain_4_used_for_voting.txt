Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this astronomy question. Let me read it again. It says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm. I remember that the Lyman alpha line is emitted by hydrogen when an electron transitions from the second energy level to the first. But in this case, it's about absorption. So when a quasar's light passes through a neutral hydrogen cloud, the hydrogen absorbs the light at the Lyman alpha wavelength, creating a absorption line.

Wait, but redshift comes into play here. The observed wavelength will be longer than the rest wavelength if the cloud is moving away from us due to the expansion of the universe. So the formula for redshift z is (observed wavelength)/(rest wavelength) - 1. Right, so z = λ_obs / λ_rest - 1.

The rest wavelength here is 1216 Angstroms. Now, the quasar's light is being absorbed by the hydrogen cloud. But wait, the quasar itself is at some redshift, and the hydrogen cloud might be between us and the quasar. Or maybe the cloud is the foreground object, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question is about detecting the absorption by the cloud. So if the cloud has a lower redshift than the quasar, then the quasar's light is at a longer wavelength because it's from a higher redshift. But the absorption line from the cloud would be at z_cloud * λ_rest. Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, let's think again. The quasar emits light at various wavelengths, including the Lyman alpha wavelength of 1216 Angstroms. But if the quasar is at a high redshift, that emission line would be redshifted to longer wavelengths. So the observed wavelength of the quasar's Lyman alpha emission line would be (1 + z_quasar) * 1216 A.

But wait, the question is about the absorption lines. So the hydrogen cloud is between us and the quasar. So the hydrogen would absorb the quasar's light at the cloud's rest frame Lyman alpha wavelength. But when the quasar's light comes to us, the absorption line would be at (z_cloud + 1) * 1216 A, because the quasar's light is redshifted by z_quasar.

Wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, the observed wavelength of the absorption line is λ_obs = (z_cloud + 1) * 1216 A, but the quasar's own emission line is at (z_quasar + 1)*1216.

Wait, but the absorption line is from the cloud, which is at a lower redshift than the quasar. So if the quasar is at z_quasar, and the cloud is at z_cloud < z_quasar, then the absorption line would be observed at λ_obs = (1 + z_cloud) * 1216 A.

But wait, the quasar's own light is at a longer wavelength. Let's think of an example. Suppose the quasar is at z=2, so the Lyman alpha emission is at (1+2)*1216 = 3648 A. Now, if there's a cloud at z=1.5, the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption would be at (1+1.5)*1216 = 2432 A. So the quasar's light at 3648 A would have an absorption line at 2432 A, but wait, that's in the quasar's frame. No, wait, the cloud is along the line of sight. So the quasar's light that reaches us has been redshifted by z_quasar, but any intervening material (like the cloud) would have imprinted absorption lines at (1 + z_cloud) * λ_rest.

But the problem is that the quasar's light is being observed through the cloud, which is at lower redshift. So the absorption line would be at (1 + z_cloud) * 1216 A. Wait, but if the cloud is at a higher redshift than the quasar, that can't be because the cloud is in front. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the cloud is in front of the quasar. So the quasar is at higher redshift than the cloud. So the cloud's z is lower than the quasar's z. So when we observe the quasar's light, any absorption from the cloud would be at z_cloud. Because the cloud is between us and the quasar, so the absorption occurs at the cloud's rest frame, but the quasar's light is redshifted beyond that.

Wait, but the quasar's light is at a higher redshift. So the observed wavelength of the quasar's light, including any absorption lines, would have the absorption line at (1 + z_cloud) * 1216 A, and the emission line at (1 + z_quasar) * 1216 A.

But the question is about detecting the absorption lines with optical telescopes. Optical wavelengths are roughly from 400 to 700 nm (4000 to 7000 Angstroms). Wait, no, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So optical is up to about 7000 Angstroms.

Wait, but if the absorption line is at 1216*(1+z_cloud) Angstroms, then for it to be in the optical range (so observable by ground-based telescopes), the wavelength must be less than about 7000 Angstroms. Because beyond that, it's infrared, which ground-based telescopes can't observe as effectively (since the atmosphere doesn't transmit well beyond ~7000 A in the infrared).

Wait, but wait. Wait, the absorption line would be at λ = (1 + z_cloud) * 1216 A. So to be in the optical range (i.e., <=7000 A), we have:

(1 + z_cloud) * 1216 <= 7000

So solving for z_cloud:

z_cloud + 1 <= 7000 / 1216

Calculating 7000/1216: Let's compute that. 1216 * 5 is 6080, which is less than 7000. 1216 * 5.75 = let's see: 1216 *5=6080; 1216*0.75=912; so 6080+912=6992. Close to 7000. So 5.75 gives 6992, which is just under 7000. So 5.75 is approximately 7000/1216. So 1 + z_cloud ≈ 5.75 → z_cloud ≈ 4.75. Wait, but that would mean the lower limit is z_cloud ≈4.75? But wait, that's a high redshift, perhaps higher than any of the options given.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Because the quasar's light is at a higher redshift, but the absorption line would be in the quasar's frame at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms. So wait, when the quasar is at a redshift z_q, the Lyman alpha emission is at 1216*(1+z_q). But any absorption from a cloud at z_cloud < z_q would be at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms. So the absorption line would be in the quasar's spectrum, but for us to see it, that line must be within the observed wavelength range.

Wait, let me think: The observed wavelength of the absorption line is (1 + z_cloud) * 1216 A, because the quasar's light is from z_q, but the absorption occurs at z_cloud. So for the absorption line to be in the optical range (i.e., observed wavelength <= 7000 A), we have:

(1 + z_cloud) * 1216 <= 7000

So solving for z_cloud:

z_cloud <= (7000/1216) - 1

7000 / 1216 ≈ 5.757 → so z_cloud ≈ 4.757. So the maximum z_cloud would be about 4.757. But wait, the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. Wait, that can't be right because higher redshift would make the wavelength longer, pushing it into the infrared, which ground-based telescopes can't see. So if the cloud's redshift is too high, the absorption line would be beyond 7000 A, making it undetectable in optical. So the lower limit would be when the absorption line is just entering the optical range. Hmm, wait, no. Let's think.

Wait, if the absorption line is at a wavelength longer than 7000 A, it's in the infrared and can't be detected with optical telescopes. So for the line to be detectable, the wavelength must be less than or equal to 7000 A. So the maximum z_cloud is when (1 + z_cloud)*1216 = 7000 → z_cloud = (7000/1216) -1 ≈5.757-1=4.757.

So clouds with z_cloud higher than this would have their absorption lines in the infrared, which ground-based telescopes can't detect. But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So what's the lower limit? Well, any z_cloud higher than some value would have the absorption line in the optical. But wait, no—the lower the z_cloud, the lower the observed wavelength. So the lower the z_cloud, the more blue the absorption line; so for the line to be in the optical, the z_cloud can be as low as zero (if the cloud is nearby), but the quasar has to be at a higher redshift than the cloud.

Wait, but if the cloud is too close (low redshift), the absorption line would be in the UV. Because if z_cloud is zero, the absorption is at 1216 A, which is in the far UV. Ground-based optical telescopes can't see that. So for the absorption line to be in the optical range, the observed wavelength must be at least in the UV part of optical. Wait, but optical starts at about 400 nm (4000 A). So 1216 A is in the UV, which is not observable from the ground. So the absorption line needs to be redshifted into the optical, which starts at about 4000 A.

Wait, no. Wait, the observed wavelength is (1+z_cloud)*1216 A. For this to be in the optical range (4000 A to 7000 A), we have:

4000 ≤ (1 + z_cloud) * 1216 ≤7000

So let's compute the lower and upper bounds for z_cloud.

Lower bound: (4000)/(1216) -1 = approx 3.29 -1 =2.29.

Upper bound: (7000/1216) -1 ≈5.757 -1=4.757.

So z_cloud must be between approximately 2.29 and 4.757 for the absorption line to be in the optical range. So the lower limit on the redshift is about 2.29. Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is just above this. Option B is 1.2, which is lower than 2.29, so would result in the absorption line being at 1216*(1+1.2)= 2678.4 Angstroms. 2678.4 A is about 268 nm, which is UV, which can't be seen by ground-based optical telescopes. So the lower limit is when the absorption line is just entering the optical range, i.e., 4000 A.

Wait, wait, 4000 A is 400 nm, which is violet. But ground-based optical telescopes can't observe below about 3000 A or so because the atmosphere is opaque. So perhaps the lower limit is when the absorption line is about 3200 A, which is in the near-UV, which is still not observable from the ground. Hmm, perhaps the question is considering the limit where the line is in the visible range, say above 400 nm (4000 A). Let me calculate:

4000 A /1216 A ≈3.29. So (1 + z_cloud) =3.29 → z_cloud≈2.29.

So the lower limit is about 2.29. The options given are 3, 1.2, 2.4, 1.9. So the nearest higher option is 2.4 (option C). Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So if the redshift is higher than 2.29, the line is observable in optical. So the lower limit is 2.29. So any object with z_cloud ≥2.29 can be detected. So the lower limit is 2.29, so the minimum z is about 2.3. The options are 2.4 (C) and 1.9 (D). So 2.4 is the closest option to 2.29. So the correct answer would be C) 2.4.

Wait, but wait. Let's think again. The question states that the clouds are in deep space and absorb the light from background quasars. So the clouds are at lower redshift than the quasars. So the quasars are at higher redshifts. But that doesn't directly affect the calculation of the cloud's z. The key is that the absorption line must be within the observed optical range (which can't see below ~3200-4000 A). So the lower limit on z is when the absorption line is at 3200 A, perhaps.

Wait, another approach: The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 A rest. To be observed in the optical (say, up to 4000 A), which is the lower end of optical. So (1+z)=4000/1216 ≈3.29 → z≈2.29.

But if the telescope can't observe wavelengths below 3200 A, then (1+z)=3200/1216≈2.63 → z≈1.63. So the lower limit would be around z=1.63. Looking at the options, option D is 1.9, which is just above that. So perhaps the correct answer is D)1.9.

Wait, but why would the lower limit be about 1.63? Because if the cloud is at z=1.63, the absorption line is at 1216*(2.63)=3195 A, which is just into the near-UV. But ground-based telescopes can't observe that because the atmosphere doesn't allow UV through. So the lower limit would be when the line is at the start of the atmospheric window, which is about 3200 A.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me look for another approach.

The Lyman alpha forest refers to absorption lines seen in the spectra of quasars. These lines are from neutral hydrogen clouds along the line of sight, at various redshifts. The forest is seen in the quasar's spectrum when the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha line is in the optical range. So the quasar's own light is redshifted, but each cloud imprints an absorption line at a wavelength (1 + z_cloud)*1216 A.

For the absorption line to be in the optical range, the observed wavelength (λ_obs) must be less than about 7000 A and greater than about 4000 A (or whatever the lower limit is for the telescope's capability).

So the condition is 4000 ≤ λ_obs ≤7000.

Which is 4000 ≤ (1 + z_cloud)*1216 ≤7000.

Divide each part by 1216:

4000/1216 ≤ 1 + z_cloud ≤7000/1216.

Compute 4000/1216 ≈3.29; 7000/1216≈5.76.

So 3.29 ≤1 + z_cloud ≤5.76 → 2.29 ≤ z_cloud ≤4.76.

So the lower limit is z_cloud ≥2.29. So the minimum redshift is approximately 2.29, so the options are C)2.4 and A)3, but option C is the closest.

Wait, but what's the exact calculation of 4000 /1216?

Let me compute 1216 multiplied by 3.29:

1216 x3 =3648

1216 x0.29= 1216 *0.2=243.2; 1216*0.09=109.44 → 243.2+109.44=352.64. So 3648 +352.64=4000.64. So exactly, 1216 *3.29=4000.64. So the lower limit is when (1+z)=3.29 → z=2.29.

So the minimum z is 2.29. So the options are 2.4 (C) and 1.9 (D). Since 2.29 is closer to 2.4 than to 1.9, the correct answer is C)2.4.

Wait, but wait: the question says "lower limit on the redshift of this objects." So the objects are the clouds. The lower limit on their redshift is when their z is as small as possible, but still allowing the absorption line to be in the optical. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So any cloud with z ≥2.29 would have its absorption line in the optical.

But looking at the options: option C is 2.4, which is above 2.29, so that's the minimum possible z (lower limit) for detection. So the answer would be C)2.4.

Wait, but the options also include B)1.2 and D)1.9. If the cloud's z is 1.9, then the absorption line is at 1216 * (2.9) = 3526.4 A. 3526 A is about 352 nm, which is near UV, which ground telescopes can't see. So the lower limit is higher than 2.29. So the correct answer is C)2.4.

To determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption lines (rest wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \)) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the observed wavelength of the absorption line. Optical telescopes can observe wavelengths approximately in the range \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \leq \lambda_{\text{obs}} \leq 7000 \, \text{Å} \). The relationship between the observed wavelength and redshift is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = (1 + z) \cdot \lambda_{\text{rest}}
\]

For the absorption line to be detectable in the optical range, the observed wavelength must satisfy:

\[
4000 \, \text{Å} \leq (1 + z) \cdot 1216 \, \text{Å} \leq 7000 \, \text{Å}
\]

Dividing through by \( 1216 \, \text{Å} \), we find:

\[
\frac{4000}{1216} \leq 1 + z \leq \frac{7000}{1216}
\]

Calculating the bounds:

\[
\frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{7000}{1216} \approx 5.76
\]

Thus:

\[
3.29 \leq 1 + z \leq 5.76 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2.29 \leq z \leq 4.76
\]

The lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z \geq 2.29 \). Among the given options, the closest value above this limit is \( z = 2.4 \) (option C). Lower redshifts, such as \( z = 1.9 \) (option D), would result in the absorption line being at \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + 1.9) = 3526 \, \text{Å} \), which is in the near-UV and undetectable by optical ground-based telescopes. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is \( z = 2.4 \).

But the absorption line from the cloud would be at z_cloud * λ_rest. Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

But if the quasar is at a high redshift, that emission line would be redshifted to longer wavelengths. So the observed wavelength of the quasar's Lyman alpha emission line would be (1 + z_quasar) * 1216 A.

So the hydrogen would absorb the quasar's light at the cloud's rest frame Lyman alpha wavelength. But when the quasar's light comes to us, the absorption line would be at (z_cloud + 1) * 1216 A, because the quasar's light is redshifted by z_quasar.

Wait, that might not be right. Alternatively, the observed wavelength of the absorption line is λ_obs = (z_cloud + 1) * 1216 A, but the quasar's own emission line is at (z_quasar + 1)*1216.

Now, if there's a cloud at z=1.5, the cloud's Lyman alpha absorption would be at (1+1.5)*1216 = 2432 A. So the quasar's light at 3648 A would have an absorption line at 2432 A, but wait, that's in the quasar's frame. No, wait, the cloud is along the line of sight. So the quasar's light that reaches us has been redshifted by z_quasar, but any intervening material (like the cloud) would have imprinted absorption lines at (1 + z_cloud) * λ_rest.

But the problem is that the quasar's light is being observed through the cloud, which is at lower redshift. So the absorption line would be at (1 + z_cloud) * 1216 A. Wait, but if the cloud is at a higher redshift than the quasar, that can't be because the cloud is in front. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, the cloud is in front of the quasar. So the quasar is at higher redshift than the cloud. So the cloud's z is lower than the quasar's z. So when we observe the quasar's light, any absorption from the cloud would be at z_cloud. Because the cloud is between us and the quasar, so the absorption occurs at the cloud's rest frame, but the quasar's light is redshifted beyond that.

Wait, but the quasar's light is at a higher redshift. So the observed wavelength of the quasar's light, including any absorption lines, would have the absorption line at (1 + z_cloud) * 1216 A, and the emission line at (1 + z_quasar) * 1216 A.

But the question is about detecting the absorption lines with optical telescopes. Optical wavelengths are roughly from 400 to 700 nm (4000 to 7000 Angstroms). Wait, no, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm, so 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms. So optical is up to about 7000 Angstroms.

Wait, but if the absorption line is at 1216*(1+z_cloud) Angstroms, then for it to be in the optical range (so observable by ground-based telescopes), the wavelength must be less than about 7000 Angstroms. Because beyond that, it's infrared, which ground-based telescopes can't observe as effectively (since the atmosphere doesn't transmit well beyond ~7000 A in the infrared).

Wait, but wait. Wait, the absorption line would be at λ = (1 + z_cloud) * 1216 A. So to be in the optical range (i.e., <=7000 A), we have:

(1 + z_cloud) * 1216 <= 7000

So solving for z_cloud:

z_cloud + 1 <= 7000 / 1216

Calculating 7000/1216: Let's compute that. 1216 * 5 is 6080, which is less than 7000. 1216 * 5.75 = let's see: 1216 *5=6080; 1216*0.75=912; so 6080+912=6992. Close to 7000. So 5.75 gives 6992, which is just under 7000. So 5.75 is approximately 7000/1216. So 1 + z_cloud ≈ 5.75 → z_cloud ≈ 4.75. Wait, but that would mean the lower limit is z_cloud ≈4.75? But wait, that's a high redshift, perhaps higher than any of the options given.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Because the quasar's light is at a higher redshift, but the absorption line would be in the quasar's frame at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms. So wait, when the quasar is at a redshift z_q, the Lyman alpha emission is at 1216*(1+z_q). But any absorption from a cloud at z_cloud < z_q would be at 1216*(1 + z_cloud) Angstroms. So the absorption line would be in the quasar's spectrum, but for us to see it, that line must be within the observed wavelength range.

Wait, let me think: The observed wavelength of the absorption line is (1 + z_cloud) * 1216 A, because the quasar's light is from z_q, but the absorption occurs at z_cloud. So for the absorption line to be in the optical range (i.e., observed wavelength <= 7000 A), we have:

(1 + z_cloud) * 1216 <= 7000

So solving for z_cloud:

z_cloud <= (7000/1216) - 1

7000 / 1216 ≈ 5.757 → so z_cloud ≈ 4.757. So the maximum z_cloud would be about 4.757. But wait, the question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift. Wait, that can't be right because higher redshift would make the wavelength longer, pushing it into the infrared, which ground-based telescopes can't see. So if the cloud's redshift is too high, the absorption line would be beyond 7000 A, making it undetectable in optical. So the lower limit would be when the absorption line is just entering the optical range. Hmm, wait, no. Let's think.

Wait, if the absorption line is at a wavelength longer than 7000 A, it's in the infrared and can't be detected with optical telescopes. So for the line to be detectable, the wavelength must be less than or equal to 7000 A. So the maximum z_cloud is when (1 + z_cloud)*1216 = 7000 → z_cloud = (7000/1216) -1 ≈5.757-1=4.757.

So clouds with z_cloud higher than this would have their absorption lines in the infrared, which ground-based telescopes can't detect. But the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So what's the lower limit? Well, any z_cloud higher than some value would have the absorption line in the optical. But wait, no—the lower the z_cloud, the lower the observed wavelength. So the lower the z_cloud, the more blue the absorption line; so for the line to be in the optical, the z_cloud can be as low as zero (if the cloud is nearby), but the quasar has to be at a higher redshift than the cloud.

Wait, but if the cloud is too close (low redshift), the absorption line would be in the UV. Because if z_cloud is zero, the absorption is at 1216 A, which is in the far UV. Ground-based optical telescopes can't see that. So for the absorption line to be in the optical range, the observed wavelength must be at least in the UV part of optical. Wait, but optical starts at about 400 nm (4000 A). So 1216 A is in the UV, which is not observable from the ground. So the absorption line needs to be redshifted into the optical, which starts at about 4000 A.

Wait, no. Wait, the observed wavelength is (1+z_cloud)*1216 A. For this to be in the optical range (4000 A to 7000 A), we have:

4000 ≤ (1 + z_cloud) * 1216 ≤7000

So let's compute the lower and upper bounds for z_cloud.

Lower bound: (4000)/(1216) -1 = approx 3.29 -1 =2.29.

Upper bound: (7000/1216) -1 ≈5.757 -1=4.757.

So z_cloud must be between approximately 2.29 and 4.757 for the absorption line to be in the optical range. So the lower limit on the redshift is about 2.29. Looking at the options, option C is 2.4, which is just above this. Option B is 1.2, which is lower than 2.29, so would result in the absorption line being at 1216*(1+1.2)= 2678.4 Angstroms. 2678.4 A is about 268 nm, which is UV, which can't be seen by ground-based optical telescopes. So the lower limit is when the absorption line is just entering the optical range, i.e., 4000 A.

Wait, wait, 4000 A is 400 nm, which is violet. But ground-based optical telescopes can't observe below about 3000 A or so because the atmosphere is opaque. So perhaps the lower limit is when the absorption line is about 3200 A, which is in the near-UV, which is still not observable from the ground. Hmm, perhaps the question is considering the limit where the line is in the visible range, say above 400 nm (4000 A). Let me calculate:

4000 A /1216 A ≈3.29. So (1 + z_cloud) =3.29 → z_cloud≈2.29.

So the lower limit is about 2.29. The options given are 3, 1.2, 2.4, 1.9. So the nearest higher option is 2.4 (option C). Wait, but the question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So if the redshift is higher than 2.29, the line is observable in optical. So the lower limit is 2.29. So any object with z_cloud ≥2.29 can be detected. So the lower limit is 2.29, so the minimum z is about 2.3. The options are 2.4 (C) and 1.9 (D). So 2.4 is the closest option to 2.29. So the correct answer would be C) 2.4.

Wait, but wait. Let's think again. The question states that the clouds are in deep space and absorb the light from background quasars. So the clouds are at lower redshift than the quasars. So the quasars are at higher redshifts. But that doesn't directly affect the calculation of the cloud's z. The key is that the absorption line must be within the observed optical range (which can't see below ~3200-4000 A). So the lower limit on z is when the absorption line is at 3200 A, perhaps.

Wait, another approach: The Lyman alpha wavelength is 1216 A rest. To be observed in the optical (say, up to 4000 A), which is the lower end of optical. So (1+z)=4000/1216 ≈3.29 → z≈2.29.

But if the telescope can't observe wavelengths below 3200 A, then (1+z)=3200/1216≈2.63 → z≈1.63. So the lower limit would be around z=1.63. Looking at the options, option D is 1.9, which is just above that. So perhaps the correct answer is D)1.9.

Wait, but why would the lower limit be about 1.63? Because if the cloud is at z=1.63, the absorption line is at 1216*(2.63)=3195 A, which is just into the near-UV. But ground-based telescopes can't observe that because the atmosphere doesn't allow UV through. So the lower limit would be when the line is at the start of the atmospheric window, which is about 3200 A.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me look for another approach.

The Lyman alpha forest refers to absorption lines seen in the spectra of quasars. These lines are from neutral hydrogen clouds along the line of sight, at various redshifts. The forest is seen in the quasar's spectrum when the observed wavelength of the Lyman alpha line is in the optical range. So the quasar's own light is redshifted, but each cloud imprints an absorption line at a wavelength (1 + z_cloud)*1216 A.

For the absorption line to be in the optical range, the observed wavelength (λ_obs) must be less than about 7000 A and greater than about 4000 A (or whatever the lower limit is for the telescope's capability).

So the condition is 4000 ≤ λ_obs ≤7000.

Which is 4000 ≤ (1 + z_cloud)*1216 ≤7000.

Divide each part by 1216:

4000/1216 ≤ 1 + z_cloud ≤7000/1216.

Compute 4000/1216 ≈3.29; 7000/1216≈5.76.

So 3.29 ≤1 + z_cloud ≤5.76 → 2.29 ≤ z_cloud ≤4.76.

So the lower limit is z_cloud ≥2.29. So the minimum redshift is approximately 2.29, so the options are C)2.4 and A)3, but option C is the closest.

Wait, but what's the exact calculation of 4000 /1216?

Let me compute 1216 multiplied by 3.29:

1216 x3 =3648

1216 x0.29= 1216 *0.2=243.2; 1216*0.09=109.44 → 243.2+109.44=352.64. So 3648 +352.64=4000.64. So exactly, 1216 *3.29=4000.64. So the lower limit is when (1+z)=3.29 → z=2.29.

So the minimum z is 2.29. So the options are 2.4 (C) and 1.9 (D). Since 2.29 is closer to 2.4 than to 1.9, the correct answer is C)2.4.

Wait, but wait: the question says "lower limit on the redshift of this objects." So the objects are the clouds. The lower limit on their redshift is when their z is as small as possible, but still allowing the absorption line to be in the optical. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So any cloud with z ≥2.29 would have its absorption line in the optical.

But looking at the options: option C is 2.4, which is above 2.29, so that's the minimum possible z (lower limit) for detection. So the answer would be C)2.4.

Wait, but the options also include B)1.2 and D)1.9. If the cloud's z is 1.9, then the absorption line is at 1216 * (2.9) = 3526.4 A. 3526 A is about 352 nm, which is near UV, which ground telescopes can't see. So the lower limit is higher than 2.29. So the correct answer is C)2.4.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift of neutral hydrogen clouds such that their Lyman alpha absorption lines (rest wavelength \( \lambda_{\text{rest}} = 1216 \, \text{Å} \)) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we analyze the observed wavelength of the absorption line. Optical telescopes can observe wavelengths approximately in the range \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \leq \lambda_{\text{obs}} \leq 7000 \, \text{Å} \). The relationship between the observed wavelength and redshift is given by:

\[
\lambda_{\text{obs}} = (1 + z) \cdot \lambda_{\text{rest}}
\]

For the absorption line to be detectable in the optical range, the observed wavelength must satisfy:

\[
4000 \, \text{Å} \leq (1 + z) \cdot 1216 \, \text{Å} \leq 7000 \, \text{Å}
\]

Dividing through by \( 1216 \, \text{Å} \), we find:

\[
\frac{4000}{1216} \leq 1 + z \leq \frac{7000}{1216}
\]

Calculating the bounds:

\[
\frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{7000}{1216} \approx 5.76
\]

Thus:

\[
3.29 \leq 1 + z \leq 5.76 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2.29 \leq z \leq 4.76
\]

The lower limit on the redshift is approximately \( z \geq 2.29 \). Among the given options, the closest value above this limit is \( z = 2.4 \) (option C). Lower redshifts, such as \( z = 1.9 \) (option D), would result in the absorption line being at \( \lambda_{\text{obs}} = 1216 \cdot (1 + 1.9) = 3526 \, \text{Å} \), which is in the near-UV and undetectable by optical ground-based telescopes. Therefore, the lower limit on the redshift is \( z = 2.4 \).
