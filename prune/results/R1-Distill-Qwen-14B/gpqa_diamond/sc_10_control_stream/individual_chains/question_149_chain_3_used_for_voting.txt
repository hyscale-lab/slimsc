Okay, so I've got this question about NMR and LC-MS analysis of a synthesized peptidic compound. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll think it through.

The question says that the 1H NMR of the crude compound looks mostly as expected, except for two peaks that correspond to the same alpha-proton. These two peaks have similar shifts and integrals that add up to 1H. So, it's not about splitting because of coupling because the question rules that out. Wait, the coupling pattern rules out spin-spin coupling. So that's not the issue here.

Then, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks of equal intensity, same mass. So the mass is right, but the retention times are different? Or same? No, two peaks, same mass. So same m/z. Oh, but in LC-MS, same mass but different retention times? Or same RT? Wait, wait, the LC-MS is at elevated temperature. Hmm.

Wait, the LC-MS analysis shows two peaks with the same mass. So same molecular weight, same mass spec. But two peaks. So what could cause that?

The options are A to D. Let's look at each.

Option A: Contaminated with a precursor. A precursor in mass spec usually refers to the molecular ion or something that loses a fragment. But if the compound is contaminated, the LC-MS would show an additional peak with a different mass, right? Because a precursor would have a different molecular weight, like the starting material or something. So in this case, both peaks have the same mass, so maybe A isn't it.

Option B: Mixture of enantiomers. Enantiomers are mirror images, non-superimposable. They have the same physical properties except for how they interact with chiral environments. So in an achiral environment, like a regular NMR, enantiomers can't be distinguished. But in an NMR, if the sample is pure, the peaks would look the same. Wait, but if it's a racemic mixture, would the NMR look different? For an alpha proton in a peptide, if it's a chiral center, then each enantiomer would have the same environment, so the NMR wouldn't split into separate peaks. Wait, but if the sample is a racemic mixture, the NMR would not show any splitting because the environments are identical. So the NMR would not have two separate peaks. Hmm.

Wait the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. So, the same proton is appearing as two, which suggests that in each molecule, the proton is in a different environment. So maybe diastereomers? Because diastereomers have different physical properties, so their NMR would split.

Wait, but the problem says the two peaks in NMR have similar shifts. So maybe they are diastereomers but with a small shift difference. Alternatively, maybe it's some kind of tautomerism or something else.

Wait, but the question also mentions that LC-MS shows two peaks of same mass. So same molecular weight, but different... what? Retention times. Because they're separated on the LC. So same mass, but LC separates them, so they have different structures but same mass? Hmm.

Wait, same mass implies same molecular formula. So, what structures have same molecular formula but different structures? Isomers. So if it's diastereomers, they would have same molecular formula, same mass. So LC can separate them, as they have different physical properties.

So option D is mixture of diastereoisomers. That could fit.

Option C: 'Double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not too sure about this. Double coupling... maybe during the formation of the amide, some coupling leads to two different products? Not sure what that means. Maybe if two different bonds formed, but I'm not certain. I'll come back to this.

Option B: Enantiomers. If the mixture is chiral, but the analysis for enantiomers in LC-MS would require a chiral column or some method to separate them. If the LC is not chiral, then enantiomers would co-elute. But the question says there are two peaks, so maybe they are separated, which would require a chiral LC setup. But the question doesn't mention that. So perhaps it's not enantiomers because the LC-MS is showing two peaks, which suggests they are separated. Enantiomers might not separate unless the column is chiral, so maybe it's not B.

Option D: Diastereoisomers. These would have the same molecular formula, same molecular weight, but different structures. So same mass in MS. And LC would separate them because their structures are different, so different retention times. That fits the LC-MS part.

Now, the NMR part: same alpha-proton appearing as two peaks, similar shifts. So diastereomers would have different environments, causing shifts, but why two similar shifts? Because perhaps the diastereomers have the same shift for that proton, but some other effect. Or maybe the two peaks are due to different diastereomers. Wait, but in a diastereomeric mixture, each diastereomer would contribute its own set of peaks.

Wait, but for that alpha-proton, each diastereomer would have its own shift. So if you have a 50:50 mixture, each peak would be from a different diastereomer, but if the shifts are similar, maybe they're close in chemical environment. Hence, two close peaks.

But wait, the problem says that the two peaks in NMR have similar shifts and their integrals add up to 1H. So perhaps each peak is 0.5H? That suggests that each is due to a different structure, but same environment for that proton, but perhaps in diastereomers, but if the diastereomers are such that the proton is in the same environment, maybe it's a different scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the two peaks are from two different diastereomers, each with the same integral, but similar shifts.

Wait, but the question says the 1H NMR of the crude compound appears consistent except for two peaks for the same alpha proton. So, same proton, but two peaks. How is that possible?

Ah! If the molecule exists as a pair of diastereomers that have the same structure except for the configuration around the alpha carbon. Wait, but that would be enantiomers. Oh wait, no. The alpha proton is in a chiral center. So if the molecule is a diastereomer, perhaps the alpha proton is in a different environment.

Wait, perhaps the synthesis led to a racemic mixture, but that's for enantiomers. But diastereomers have different structures. For example, if you have two different stereocenters, then the diastereomers would have different properties.

Wait, but in the case of diastereomers, each would have their own NMR peaks. So for a diastereomeric mixture, each diastereomer would produce a set of peaks. But the question says that the two peaks correspond to the same alpha-proton. So, perhaps each diastereomer has the same alpha proton, but in different environments.

Wait, but if the diastereomers have the same shift, that would mean same environment. That can't be, because diastereomers are supposed to have different physical properties.

Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

The NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha-proton. So each corresponds to a different structure, but same proton. That suggests that the environment of that proton is slightly different in each case. So perhaps, the molecule has two diastereomers which have the same alpha proton, but the environment is different, leading to two different shifts.

But why would the shifts be similar? Maybe the diastereomers are such that the alpha proton is in a similar environment. For example, two diastereomers where the alpha proton is on adjacent carbons with similar substituents.

Alternatively, perhaps the sample is a racemic mixture. Wait, but in a racemic mixture, the NMR of an alpha proton would not show two peaks. Because each enantiomer would have the same shift for that proton. So the NMR would not split the peak. Unless the sample is not pure. Wait, but the integrals add to 1H. So, perhaps each enantiomer contributes 0.5H? No, that doesn't make sense. Each enantiomer has the same number of protons. So if you have a racemic mixture, the NMR would look identical to a pure sample, because the shifts would be the same. So this can't explain two peaks. So probably not B.

Option D: diastereoisomers. If there are two diastereomers in the sample, each would have their own NMR peaks. But the question says that the two peaks are for the same alpha-proton. So each diastereomer has a different environment for that proton, hence two peaks. But why the same integral? Because each diastereomer contributes 1H in total, but they're split into two. Wait, but the integral together adds to 1H. So each peak is 0.5H. Hmm. Wait, that would imply that each diastereomer has the same number of that proton. Hmm, but for diastereomers, the number of protons would be same. So perhaps each diastereomer has one proton, but in the mixture, each is 50%, so each peak is 0.5H, together 1H.

But why would the chemical shifts be similar? Because the environment isn't too different. So perhaps the diastereomers are close in structure, making the shifts close.

And the LC-MS would show two peaks because the diastereomers have different retention times. So the same mass, but different structures, thus different RT.

So putting this together, it seems like D is the likely option.

Wait, what about option C: 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. I'm not too sure. What is 'double coupling'? Maybe during an amide bond formation, two different byproducts are formed, but I'm not exactly sure. Alternatively, perhaps when forming the amide, two different products are formed due to some coupling, but I'm not certain. It doesn't seem as straightforward as diastereomers.

So, between C and D. Hmm.

Wait, 'double coupling' during amide bond formation. Maybe it's about the formation of two different bonds, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the amide bond is formed between the wrong carbonyl or something. But the NMR isn't showing splitting due to coupling. So maybe it's not about coupling but about the structure.

Another thought: the NMR shows two peaks for the same alpha proton. This could be due to a diastereomeric mixture. Each diastereomer contributes a peak for that proton. Since diastereomers have different physical properties, the shifts would be different, but could be close. So, their combined signals would look like two peaks.

So, the conclusion is that the crude compound is a mixture of diastereoisomers. So the answer is D.

The question involves analyzing a peptidic compound where the 1H NMR spectrum shows two peaks corresponding to the same alpha-proton, with similar chemical shifts and integrals adding up to 1H. Additionally, LC-MS analysis reveals two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass. The goal is to determine the most likely explanation for these observations.

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **1H NMR Spectrum**:
   - Two peaks for the same alpha-proton suggest that the proton is in different environments in the sample.
   - The peaks have similar chemical shifts, indicating that the environments are not very different.
   - The integrals add up to 1H, suggesting a 50:50 mixture of two species, each contributing 0.5H to the integral.

2. **LC-MS Analysis**:
   - Two peaks of equal intensity with the same mass indicate that the two species have the same molecular formula but different physical properties (e.g., different structures or stereochemistry).
   - The same mass suggests the species are isomers, and the different retention times suggest they are separated by the LC column.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A (Contaminated with a precursor)**:
  - A precursor would have a different molecular weight, leading to a different mass in the LC-MS analysis. Since both peaks have the same mass, this option is unlikely.

- **Option B (Mixture of enantiomers)**:
  - Enantiomers have identical physical properties (e.g., NMR shifts) and would not result in separate peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum. Additionally, LC-MS would not separate enantiomers unless a chiral column is used, which is not mentioned in the question. Thus, this option is unlikely.

- **Option C ('Double coupling' during amide-bond forming reaction)**:
  - The term "double coupling" is unclear in this context. While side products could form during synthesis, the observations (similar chemical shifts, same mass, and LC separation) are better explained by structural isomerism rather than coupling artifacts. This option is less likely.

- **Option D (Mixture of diastereoisomers)**:
  - Diastereoisomers have the same molecular formula and mass, explaining the identical mass in LC-MS. They can have different physical properties, leading to different retention times in LC and distinct but similar chemical shifts in NMR. The 50:50 mixture would result in two peaks in NMR, each contributing 0.5H, matching the observations. This is the most plausible explanation.

### Conclusion:
The most likely explanation is that the crude compound exists as a mixture of diastereoisomers, which accounts for the observations in both the NMR and LC-MS analyses.
