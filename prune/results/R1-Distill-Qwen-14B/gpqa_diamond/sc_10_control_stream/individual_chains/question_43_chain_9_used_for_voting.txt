Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct IUPAC name for this benzene ring structure. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, I remember that IUPAC nomenclature for benzoic acid derivatives usually starts by numbering the benzene ring in such a way that the functional group with the highest priority gets the lowest possible number. The functional groups here are a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, a cyano group, a hydroxyl, a dimethyl amino, and a methoxy group.

Wait, but the main chain is based on the carboxylic acid, right? Because benzoic acid is the parent structure. So the numbering should start from the carboxylic acid at position 1. The substituents are attached to other positions based on their positions relative to the carboxylic acid.

Let me visualize the benzene ring. The carboxylic acid is at position 1. The other groups are meta to each other, meaning they are at positions 3, 5, or somewhere else? Wait, the question says that the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to one another. Oh, that means each is separated by two positions. So perhaps the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the carbaldehyde at position 3, and the cyano at position 5. Or is it another arrangement?

Wait, no. Let me think again. All three are meta to each other. So, if one is at position 1, another would be at 3, and the third at 5. Because in a benzene ring, each meta position is two away. So 1,3,5 are all meta to each other.

But wait, the question says the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to one another. So each is in a position such that they are meta to each other. So they can't all be at 1,3,5 because that makes them each meta to the others. So position 1 is the carboxylic acid, position 3 is the carbaldehyde, and position 5 is the cyano group. Or another arrangement where each is two positions apart.

But wait, the question says that the carboxylic acid has substituents ortho to it. The ortho positions would be 2 and 6. The problem states that ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. So at positions 2 and 6, we have -OH and -N(CH3)2. Wait, no. Carboxylic acid is at position 1. So positions 2 and 6 are ortho.

But the question says ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino. So one is at position 2, the other at position 6. Similarly, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The para position is position 4.

Wait, so the substituents are:

- Position 1: Carboxylic acid (COOH)
- Position 2: Either -OH or -N(CH3)2
- Position 3: Carbaldehyde (CHO)
- Position 4: Methoxy (OCH3)
- Position 5: Cyano (CN)
- Position 6: The other group between -OH and -N(CH3)2

Wait, but the problem says that the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile. So the nitrile (CN) is at position 5, methoxy is at 4, and OH is at 2. Wait, if CN is at 5, then the ortho positions are 4 and 6. So the methoxy is at 4 (ortho to CN), and perhaps the hydroxyl is at 6, but wait, the hydroxyl is ortho to the COOH, so it's at position 2.

Wait, let's make a table.

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6

1: COOH

2: OH or NMe2

3: CHO

4: OCH3

5: CN

6: the remaining group (NMe2 or OH)

But the problem states that the methoxy (OCH3) and the hydroxyl (OH) are both ortho to the nitrile (CN). So CN is at position X, OCH3 and OH are at positions adjacent to X.

So where is CN? If OCH3 is at position 4, then CN must be either at 3 or 5, because the ortho positions are 3 and 5 for position 4.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating. Let's try to arrange all substituents:

Main chain: benzoic acid. So position 1 is COOH.

Groups meta to each other: COOH, CHO, CN.

So, COOH is 1, CHO is 3, CN is 5.

Ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6): OH and NMe2. So 2 and 6 have OH and NMe2.

Para to COOH (position 4): OCH3.

Now, OCH3 is at 4, which is para to 1. The nitrile is at 5. So for the nitrile at 5, its ortho positions are 4 and 6.

So OCH3 is at 4 (ortho to CN at 5), and position 6 must be NMe2. Because the other group is OH at 2.

Because OCH3 is at 4, and that's ortho to 5 (CN). So methoxy is at 4, which is correct.

Additionally, the hydroxyl is at 2, which is ortho to COOH, and the dimethyl amino is at 6, which is ortho to COOH and also ortho to CN at 5.

So substituents:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CHO

4: OCH3

5: CN

6: NMe2 (dimethylamino)

Wait, but does that fit the problem statement?

The problem says: Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino. So 2 is OH, 6 is NMe2.

Also, para to the COOH is methoxy at 4.

Also, methoxy (4) and hydroxyl (2) are both ortho to the nitrile (CN at 5). Because CN is at 5, positions 4 and 6 are ortho. So OCH3 is at 4 (ortho to CN), and NMe2 is at 6 (also ortho to CN). So the hydroxyl is at 2, which is not ortho to CN. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, the problem says that the methoxy and the hydroxyl are also ortho to the nitrile. So both OCH3 and OH must be adjacent (ortho) to CN.

If CN is at 5, then its ortho positions are 4 and 6.

So OCH3 is at 4, which is ortho to 5.

OH must be either at 4 or 6, but 4 is occupied by OCH3. So OH has to be at 6.

Wait, but earlier the problem states that ortho to COOH are OH and NMe2. So positions 2 and 6 would have OH and NMe2.

But if OH is at 6, and NMe2 is at 2, then:

Substituents:

1: COOH

2: NMe2

3: CHO

4: OCH3

5: CN

6: OH

Now, OCH3 is at 4 (ortho to CN at 5), and OH is at 6 (which is adjacent to 5? No, position 6 is adjacent to 5 only if the ring is considered in that way. Wait, in a benzene ring, each position is connected to the next. So positions 5 and 6 are adjacent (ortho) because in the numbering, 5 is next to 6.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1 is between 6 and 2. So position 5 is between 4 and 6.

So, positions 5 and 6 are adjacent. So if CN is at 5, then 6 is ortho to it.

So in this arrangement, OH is at 6, which is ortho to CN at 5. OCH3 is at 4, which is ortho to CN at 5. So that fits the condition that both OCH3 and OH are ortho to the nitrile.

But then, the substituents ortho to the COOH (position 1) are at positions 2 and 6. In this arrangement, position 2 is NMe2, and position 6 is OH. That fits the problem statement: ortho to COOH are a hydroxyl (6) and a dimethyl amino (2).

So the substituents are:

1: COOH

2: N(CH3)2

3: CHO

4: OCH3

5: CN

6: OH

Now, the numbering for IUPAC starts with the COOH as position 1. Then, the substituents are in the order of their positions: 2, 3, 4, 5,6.

Wait, the IUPAC name lists substituents in alphabetical order, but their positions in the name are determined by their numbering.

So the substituents are:

Position 2: NMe2

Position 3: CHO

Position 4: OCH3

Position 5: CN

Position 6: OH

So the substituents in order of priority? Wait, the main chain is the benzoic acid. The substituents are arranged in alphabetical order. But the numbering is done to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers.

Wait, no. The substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions. So the name starts with the main group (benzoic acid), then the substituents in alphabetical order, each with their locants.

Wait, but the numbering is done to get the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So perhaps the positions may change if a lower set of numbers can be achieved by rotating the ring. Let me think: in this case, the substituents are 2,3,4,5,6 as above. Is there a way to number the ring so that the substituents have lower numbers?

Hmm, perhaps not. Because if I start numbering from another position, the numbers would be higher for some substituents. For example, if I number from position 3 as the COOH, but that would make other substituents have higher numbers.

So the numbering is correct as 1 for COOH.

Now, in the IUPAC name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order.

Let's list the substituents:

- Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) at position 2.

- Formyl (CHO) at position 3.

- Hydroxyl (OH) at position 6.

- Methoxy (OCH3) at position 4.

- Cyano (CN) at position 5.

Wait, wait. Wait, the substituent order in the name is based on alphabetical order, regardless of position.

The substituents are:

- 2-dimethylamino

- 3-formyl

- 4-methoxy

- 5-cyano

- 6-hydroxy

Wait, but the substituents are:

Formyl (CHO), which is an aldehyde group.

Hydroxyl (OH), a hydroxyl group.

Methoxy (OCH3), an ether group.

Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2), an amino group.

Cyano (CN), a nitrile group.

So, the alphabetical order is:

C comes first for cyano (CN).

Then formyl (CHO) comes next.

Then hydroxyl (OH) comes after.

Methoxy (OCH3) comes after.

Then dimethylamino (N(CH3)2). Wait, no. Wait, the alphabetical order is based on the substituent's name, regardless of the location.

Wait, I think the order is based on the substituent's name. So:

The substituents are:

- 2-dimethylamino

- 3-formyl

- 4-methoxy

- 5-cyano

- 6-hydroxy

But when sorted alphabetically, the substituent names in order are:

1. Cyano

2. Dimethylamino

3. Formyl

4. Hydroxy

5. Methoxy

Wait, no. Let's list them:

1. 5-cyano (CN)

2. 2-dimethylamino (NMe2)

3. 3-formyl (CHO)

4. 4-methoxy (OCH3)

5. 6-hydroxy (OH)

Wait, I think I'm confusing the order. Let me list the substituent types:

- Cyano (-CN)

- Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)

- Formyl (-CHO)

- Hydroxyl (-OH)

- Methoxy (-OCH3)

So, the alphabetical order is:

-C comes first: cyano.

Then D: dimethylamino.

Then F: formyl.

Then H: hydroxyl.

Then M: methoxy.

Wait, wait, no. The substituent names are listed in alphabetical order. So:

Alphabetical order of substituent types (prefixes):

1. Cyano (C)

2. Dimethylamino (D)

3. Formyl (F)

4. Hydroxyl (H)

5. Methoxy (M)

So the substituents are listed in the name in that order.

But the name starts with the parent acid: benzoic acid.

So the name will be:

[ substituents in alphabetical order ] benzoic acid.

Each substituent is listed with its position.

So substituent order:

1. 5-cyano

2. 2-dimethylamino

3. 3-formyl

4. 4-methoxy

5. 6-hydroxy

Wait, but wait. Let me check.

Wait, the substituents are at:

5: CN

2: NMe2

3: CHO

4: OCH3

6: OH

So in the name, they are arranged alphabetically.

So first comes CN (5-cyano), then dimethylamino (2), then formyl (3), then hydroxyl (6), then methoxy (4). Wait, no. Because methoxy is at 4, which comes after hydroxyl in the substituent list?

Wait, wait, here's the confusion. The substituent names are ordered alphabetically regardless of their positions.

So the substituents in order are:

CN (cyano), then dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxyl, methoxy.

So their positions are 5, 2, 3, 6, 4.

But in the name, each substituent is mentioned with their position. So the correct arrangement is:

5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Wait, but that would be the order. But when writing the IUPAC name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, so CN comes first, then dimethylamino, then formyl, then hydroxyl, then methoxy.

Wait, but wait. Let me look for the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Wait, that doesn't fit. Let me check option B.

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

That's not correct order. Let me see the substituents.

Option D: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Yes, that matches the order I thought. Let me see: 5-cyano comes first. Then 2-(dimethylamino), then 3-formyl, then 6-hydroxy, then 4-methoxy. So substituents in the order CN, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Wait, but the substituents in the correct order are: CN (5), dimethylamino (2), formyl (3), hydroxy (6), methoxy (4). So the name would be 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid, which is option D.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check:

Option D is: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the correct IUPAC name for the given molecule, we start by identifying the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring. The parent structure is benzoic acid, with the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1. The substituents are arranged as follows:

- **Position 1**: Carboxylic acid (-COOH).
- **Position 2**: Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂).
- **Position 3**: Carbaldehyde (-CHO).
- **Position 4**: Methoxy (-OCH₃).
- **Position 5**: Cyano (-CN).
- **Position 6**: Hydroxyl (-OH).

The problem specifies that the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano groups are all meta to one another, which aligns with their positions at 1, 3, and 5, respectively. Additionally, the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are ortho to the carboxylic acid, placing them at positions 6 and 2. The methoxy group is para to the carboxylic acid, at position 4, and both the methoxy and hydroxyl groups are ortho to the cyano group at position 5.

For IUPAC nomenclature, substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions. The substituents and their corresponding positions are:

1. **Cyano (-CN)**: Position 5.
2. **Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)**: Position 2.
3. **Formyl (-CHO)**: Position 3.
4. **Hydroxyl (-OH)**: Position 6.
5. **Methoxy (-OCH₃)**: Position 4.

Thus, the correct IUPAC name is **5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**, which matches **Option D**.

Answer: D

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct IUPAC name for this benzene ring structure. Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, I remember that IUPAC nomenclature for benzoic acid derivatives usually starts by numbering the benzene ring in such a way that the functional group with the highest priority gets the lowest possible number. The functional groups here are a carboxylic acid, a carbaldehyde, a cyano group, a hydroxyl, a dimethyl amino, and a methoxy group.

Wait, but the main chain is based on the carboxylic acid, right? Because benzoic acid is the parent structure. So the numbering should start from the carboxylic acid at position 1. The substituents are attached to other positions based on their positions relative to the carboxylic acid.

Let me visualize the benzene ring. The carboxylic acid is at position 1. The other groups are meta to each other, meaning they are at positions 3, 5, or somewhere else? Wait, the question says that the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to one another. Oh, that means each is separated by two positions. So perhaps the carboxylic acid is at position 1, the carbaldehyde at position 3, and the cyano at position 5. Or is it another arrangement?

Wait, no. Let me think again. All three are meta to each other. So, if one is at position 1, another would be at 3, and the third at 5. Because in a benzene ring, each meta position is two away. So 1,3,5 are all meta to each other.

But wait, the question says the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano are all meta to one another. So each is in a position such that they are meta to each other. So they can't all be at 1,3,5 because that makes them each meta to the others. So position 1 is the carboxylic acid, position 3 is the carbaldehyde, and position 5 is the cyano group. Or another arrangement where each is two positions apart.

But wait, the question says that the carboxylic acid has substituents ortho to it. The ortho positions would be 2 and 6. The problem states that ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino group. So at positions 2 and 6, we have -OH and -N(CH3)2. Wait, no. Carboxylic acid is at position 1. So positions 2 and 6 are ortho.

But the question says ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino. So one is at position 2, the other at position 6. Similarly, para to the carboxylic acid is a methoxy group. The para position is position 4.

Wait, so the substituents are:

- Position 1: Carboxylic acid (COOH)
- Position 2: Either -OH or -N(CH3)2
- Position 3: Carbaldehyde (CHO)
- Position 4: Methoxy (OCH3)
- Position 5: Cyano (CN)
- Position 6: The other group between -OH and -N(CH3)2

Wait, but the problem says that the methoxy and the hydroxyl are both ortho to the nitrile. So the nitrile (CN) is at position 5, methoxy is at 4, and OH is at 2. Wait, if CN is at 5, then the ortho positions are 4 and 6. So the methoxy is at 4 (ortho to CN), and perhaps the hydroxyl is at 6, but wait, the hydroxyl is ortho to the COOH, so it's at position 2.

Wait, let's make a table.

Positions: 1 2 3 4 5 6

1: COOH

2: OH or NMe2

3: CHO

4: OCH3

5: CN

6: the remaining group (NMe2 or OH)

But the problem states that the methoxy (OCH3) and the hydroxyl (OH) are both ortho to the nitrile (CN). So CN is at position X, OCH3 and OH are at positions adjacent to X.

So where is CN? If OCH3 is at position 4, then CN must be either at 3 or 5, because the ortho positions are 3 and 5 for position 4.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating. Let's try to arrange all substituents:

Main chain: benzoic acid. So position 1 is COOH.

Groups meta to each other: COOH, CHO, CN.

So, COOH is 1, CHO is 3, CN is 5.

Ortho to COOH (positions 2 and 6): OH and NMe2. So 2 and 6 have OH and NMe2.

Para to COOH (position 4): OCH3.

Now, OCH3 is at 4, which is para to 1. The nitrile is at 5. So for the nitrile at 5, its ortho positions are 4 and 6.

So OCH3 is at 4 (ortho to CN at 5), and position 6 must be NMe2. Because the other group is OH at 2.

Because OCH3 is at 4, and that's ortho to 5 (CN). So methoxy is at 4, which is correct.

Additionally, the hydroxyl is at 2, which is ortho to COOH, and the dimethyl amino is at 6, which is ortho to COOH and also ortho to CN at 5.

So substituents:

1: COOH

2: OH

3: CHO

4: OCH3

5: CN

6: NMe2 (dimethylamino)

Wait, but does that fit the problem statement?

The problem says: Ortho to the carboxylic acid are a hydroxyl and a dimethyl amino. So 2 is OH, 6 is NMe2.

Also, para to the COOH is methoxy at 4.

Also, methoxy (4) and hydroxyl (2) are both ortho to the nitrile (CN at 5). Because CN is at 5, positions 4 and 6 are ortho. So OCH3 is at 4 (ortho to CN), and NMe2 is at 6 (also ortho to CN). So the hydroxyl is at 2, which is not ortho to CN. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, the problem says that the methoxy and the hydroxyl are also ortho to the nitrile. So both OCH3 and OH must be adjacent (ortho) to CN.

If CN is at 5, then its ortho positions are 4 and 6.

So OCH3 is at 4, which is ortho to 5.

OH must be either at 4 or 6, but 4 is occupied by OCH3. So OH has to be at 6.

Wait, but earlier the problem states that ortho to COOH are OH and NMe2. So positions 2 and 6 would have OH and NMe2.

But if OH is at 6, and NMe2 is at 2, then:

Substituents:

1: COOH

2: NMe2

3: CHO

4: OCH3

5: CN

6: OH

Now, OCH3 is at 4 (ortho to CN at 5), and OH is at 6 (which is adjacent to 5? No, position 6 is adjacent to 5 only if the ring is considered in that way. Wait, in a benzene ring, each position is connected to the next. So positions 5 and 6 are adjacent (ortho) because in the numbering, 5 is next to 6.

Wait, benzene is a ring, so positions 1 is between 6 and 2. So position 5 is between 4 and 6.

So, positions 5 and 6 are adjacent. So if CN is at 5, then 6 is ortho to it.

So in this arrangement, OH is at 6, which is ortho to CN at 5. OCH3 is at 4, which is ortho to CN at 5. So that fits the condition that both OCH3 and OH are ortho to the nitrile.

But then, the substituents ortho to the COOH (position 1) are at positions 2 and 6. In this arrangement, position 2 is NMe2, and position 6 is OH. That fits the problem statement: ortho to COOH are a hydroxyl (6) and a dimethyl amino (2).

So the substituents are:

1: COOH

2: N(CH3)2

3: CHO

4: OCH3

5: CN

6: OH

Now, the numbering for IUPAC starts with the COOH as position 1. Then, the substituents are in the order of their positions: 2, 3, 4, 5,6.

Wait, the IUPAC name lists substituents in alphabetical order, but their positions in the name are determined by their numbering.

So the substituents are:

Position 2: NMe2

Position 3: CHO

Position 4: OCH3

Position 5: CN

Position 6: OH

So the substituents in order of priority? Wait, the main chain is the benzoic acid. The substituents are arranged in alphabetical order. But the numbering is done to give the substituents the lowest possible numbers.

Wait, no. The substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions. So the name starts with the main group (benzoic acid), then the substituents in alphabetical order, each with their locants.

Wait, but the numbering is done to get the substituents the lowest possible numbers. So perhaps the positions may change if a lower set of numbers can be achieved by rotating the ring. Let me think: in this case, the substituents are 2,3,4,5,6 as above. Is there a way to number the ring so that the substituents have lower numbers?

Hmm, perhaps not. Because if I start numbering from another position, the numbers would be higher for some substituents. For example, if I number from position 3 as the COOH, but that would make other substituents have higher numbers.

So the numbering is correct as 1 for COOH.

Now, in the IUPAC name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order.

Let's list the substituents:

- Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2) at position 2.

- Formyl (CHO) at position 3.

- Hydroxyl (OH) at position 6.

- Methoxy (OCH3) at position 4.

- Cyano (CN) at position 5.

Wait, wait. Wait, the substituent order in the name is based on alphabetical order, regardless of position.

The substituents are:

- 2-dimethylamino

- 3-formyl

- 4-methoxy

- 5-cyano

- 6-hydroxy

Wait, but the substituents are:

Formyl (CHO), which is an aldehyde group.

Hydroxyl (OH), a hydroxyl group.

Methoxy (OCH3), an ether group.

Dimethylamino (N(CH3)2), an amino group.

Cyano (CN), a nitrile group.

So, the alphabetical order is:

C comes first for cyano (CN).

Then formyl (CHO) comes next.

Then hydroxyl (OH) comes after.

Methoxy (OCH3) comes after.

Then dimethylamino (N(CH3)2). Wait, no. Wait, the alphabetical order is based on the substituent's name, regardless of the location.

Wait, I think the order is based on the substituent's name. So:

The substituents are:

- 2-dimethylamino

- 3-formyl

- 4-methoxy

- 5-cyano

- 6-hydroxy

But when sorted alphabetically, the substituent names in order are:

1. Cyano

2. Dimethylamino

3. Formyl

4. Hydroxy

5. Methoxy

Wait, no. Let's list them:

1. 5-cyano (CN)

2. 2-dimethylamino (NMe2)

3. 3-formyl (CHO)

4. 4-methoxy (OCH3)

5. 6-hydroxy (OH)

Wait, I think I'm confusing the order. Let me list the substituent types:

- Cyano (-CN)

- Dimethylamino (-N(CH3)2)

- Formyl (-CHO)

- Hydroxyl (-OH)

- Methoxy (-OCH3)

So, the alphabetical order is:

-C comes first: cyano.

Then D: dimethylamino.

Then F: formyl.

Then H: hydroxyl.

Then M: methoxy.

Wait, wait, no. The substituent names are listed in alphabetical order. So:

Alphabetical order of substituent types (prefixes):

1. Cyano (C)

2. Dimethylamino (D)

3. Formyl (F)

4. Hydroxyl (H)

5. Methoxy (M)

So the substituents are listed in the name in that order.

But the name starts with the parent acid: benzoic acid.

So the name will be:

[ substituents in alphabetical order ] benzoic acid.

Each substituent is listed with its position.

So substituent order:

1. 5-cyano

2. 2-dimethylamino

3. 3-formyl

4. 4-methoxy

5. 6-hydroxy

Wait, but wait. Let me check.

Wait, the substituents are at:

5: CN

2: NMe2

3: CHO

4: OCH3

6: OH

So in the name, they are arranged alphabetically.

So first comes CN (5-cyano), then dimethylamino (2), then formyl (3), then hydroxyl (6), then methoxy (4). Wait, no. Because methoxy is at 4, which comes after hydroxyl in the substituent list?

Wait, wait, here's the confusion. The substituent names are ordered alphabetically regardless of their positions.

So the substituents in order are:

CN (cyano), then dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxyl, methoxy.

So their positions are 5, 2, 3, 6, 4.

But in the name, each substituent is mentioned with their position. So the correct arrangement is:

5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Wait, but that would be the order. But when writing the IUPAC name, the substituents are listed in alphabetical order, so CN comes first, then dimethylamino, then formyl, then hydroxyl, then methoxy.

Wait, but wait. Let me look for the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-cyano-6-(dimethylamino)-5-formyl-2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Wait, that doesn't fit. Let me check option B.

Option B: 2-hydroxy-3-cyano-4-methoxy-5-formyl-6-(dimethylamino)benzoic acid.

That's not correct order. Let me see the substituents.

Option D: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Yes, that matches the order I thought. Let me see: 5-cyano comes first. Then 2-(dimethylamino), then 3-formyl, then 6-hydroxy, then 4-methoxy. So substituents in the order CN, dimethylamino, formyl, hydroxy, methoxy.

Wait, but the substituents in the correct order are: CN (5), dimethylamino (2), formyl (3), hydroxy (6), methoxy (4). So the name would be 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid, which is option D.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check:

Option D is: 5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid.

Yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be option D.


To determine the correct IUPAC name for the given molecule, we start by identifying the substituents and their positions on the benzene ring. The parent structure is benzoic acid, with the carboxylic acid group (-COOH) at position 1. The substituents are arranged as follows:

- **Position 1**: Carboxylic acid (-COOH).
- **Position 2**: Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂).
- **Position 3**: Carbaldehyde (-CHO).
- **Position 4**: Methoxy (-OCH₃).
- **Position 5**: Cyano (-CN).
- **Position 6**: Hydroxyl (-OH).

The problem specifies that the carboxylic acid, carbaldehyde, and cyano groups are all meta to one another, which aligns with their positions at 1, 3, and 5, respectively. Additionally, the hydroxyl and dimethylamino groups are ortho to the carboxylic acid, placing them at positions 6 and 2. The methoxy group is para to the carboxylic acid, at position 4, and both the methoxy and hydroxyl groups are ortho to the cyano group at position 5.

For IUPAC nomenclature, substituents are listed in alphabetical order, regardless of their positions. The substituents and their corresponding positions are:

1. **Cyano (-CN)**: Position 5.
2. **Dimethylamino (-N(CH₃)₂)**: Position 2.
3. **Formyl (-CHO)**: Position 3.
4. **Hydroxyl (-OH)**: Position 6.
5. **Methoxy (-OCH₃)**: Position 4.

Thus, the correct IUPAC name is **5-cyano-2-(dimethylamino)-3-formyl-6-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzoic acid**, which matches **Option D**.

Answer: D
