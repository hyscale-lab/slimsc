Okay, so I've got this question about the Mott-Gurney equation, and I'm a bit rusty on my solid-state physics, but I'll try to think it through. Let me break it down step by step.

The question asks which statement is true about the validity of the Mott-Gurney equation. The equation given is J = (9/8) * ε * μ * V² / L³. I remember that this equation describes the dark current in a semiconductor device under space-charge-limited conditions, which is the SCLC regime.

So, the Mott-Gurney equation is used when the current is limited by the space charge, meaning that the charge in the vicinity of the electrode is so high that it creates a potential gradient that opposes further injection of carriers. This usually happens in the dark, so no photon-induced currents.

Now, the equation itself: J is proportional to V squared. The derivation of this equation comes from the balance between the electric field due to the space charge and the injection of carriers. The equation assumes certain conditions, so the validity depends on those conditions.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which scenario each option describes and whether it fits with the assumptions needed for the Mott-Gurney equation.

Option A: Trap-free single-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. Hmm. Well, traps would cause carrier trapping, which would complicate the current transport, so a trap-free device makes sense. Single-carrier probably means it's either electrons or holes, not both. Ohmic contact means the contact doesn't have a significant barrier, so easy injection. But wait, Mott-Gurney is for space-charge-limited conditions, which usually requires that the current is limited by the charge build-up, not by injection barriers. So if it's Ohmic, maybe that's okay, but what about drift vs. diffusion? The equation is derived under the assumption that drift is the dominant current transport mechanism, I think. But the option says "negligible drift current." Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Wait, no. If drift is the main thing, then maybe it's not negligible. Or wait, wait. In the derivation, a high applied voltage leads to a situation where the space charge dominates, leading to a V^2 dependence. But if drift is negligible, maybe the current would be dominated by diffusion. So the Mott-Gurney equation might not hold if diffusion is significant.

Option B: Trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier and negligible diffusion current. No injection barrier (like a Schottky contact would have a barrier?). Wait, no, an Ohmic contact has no barrier. So this option says no injection barrier, so carriers can inject easily. If there's no barrier, that would imply Ohmic contact. But the main point here is the equation is valid when the current is limited by the space charge, not by the injection. So the injection should be easy, which this option provides. Also, the equation assumes that the current is in the regime where drift is dominant, so if diffusion is negligible, that aligns with the equation. Oh wait, the equation is derived under the assumption that the current is space-charge-limited, which occurs when the applied voltage is high enough that the built-up charge creates a potential gradient that limits further current. So other factors, like injection barriers (which would limit current at lower voltages) become negligible. So in this case, if there's no injection barrier (so carriers can be injected easily), and diffusion is negligible, so drift dominates. That makes sense because the derivation of Mott-Gurney involves drift current being proportional to the electric field, which in turn is determined by the space charge. So this option might be correct.

Option C: Single-carrier device with Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. A Schottky contact has a barrier. So that would imply a larger injection barrier, which in turn would require higher voltages to get current flowing. But the Mott-Gurney equation applies when the space charge is dominant, which occurs when the injection is already happening, so maybe a Schottky contact would complicate things because it would require more voltage to overcome the barrier. Also, if diffusion is negligible, then drift dominates, which is good for the equation's applicability. But the presence of a Schottky contact might mean that the current is injection-limited rather than space-charge-limited at lower voltages. So perhaps this scenario isn't the correct one for Mott-Gurney.

Option D: Two-carrier device with Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. Ohmic contact is good for easy injection. Two-carrier devices usually complicate things because you have both electrons and holes contributing, but Mott-Gurney is for single-carrier transport, I believe. Because in two-carrier cases, you might have more complex behavior, like the presence of both electrons and holes leading to different dependencies. The equation given is for a single carrier, as it's a function of one type of carrier. So option D is probably incorrect because it's a two-carrier device.

Now, going back to the options, the correct scenario should be a single-carrier, trap-free device (so no recombination or trapping), injection easy (no barrier, so Ohmic contact), and drift is dominant (so diffusion is negligible). So which option matches that?

Option A: Ohmic contact, but negligible drift? Wait, if drift is negligible, then perhaps the current would be dominated by diffusion, but Mott-Gurney relies on drift. So option A says negligible drift, which might make the equation invalid. So A is incorrect.

Option B: No carrier injection barrier (so easy injection, like Ohmic contact), and negligible diffusion (so drift is dominant). Yes, that fits. So option B is looking correct.

Wait, let me think again. The Mott-Gurney equation is derived under the assumption that the current is space-charge-limited, which implies that the electric field due to the space charge is the dominant factor. This typically occurs when the applied voltage is sufficiently high that the built-up charge creates a potential gradient that opposes further carrier injection. In this case, the current is limited by the space charge, not by the injection process itself. So the equation holds when the injection is efficient, which would be the case with an Ohmic contact (no barrier) and when the carriers can move primarily by drift (so drift is the main transport mechanism, hence diffusion is negligible).

So option B says "no carrier injection barrier" (so Ohmic contact), and "negligible diffusion current" (so drift dominates). That matches the conditions required for the Mott-Gurney equation to be valid.

Wait, what about option A? It says "Ohmic contact" and "negligible drift current." But if drift current is negligible, then the dominant current would be diffusion, which wouldn't fit the Mott-Gurney equation. Because Mott-Gurney assumes the current is due to drift in the space-charge region. So A is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The Mott-Gurney equation, \( J = \frac{9}{8} \epsilon \mu \frac{V^2}{L^3} \), describes the dark current (\(J\)) versus voltage (\(V\)) behavior of a semiconductor device in the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) regime. This equation is valid under specific conditions. It assumes a single-carrier device (either electrons or holes, not both) and that the current is dominated by drift rather than diffusion. The space-charge-limited regime occurs when the applied voltage is high enough that the charge build-up near the electrode creates a potential gradient opposing further carrier injection, making the current dependent on \(V^2\).

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: This describes a trap-free single-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible drift current. However, if drift current is negligible, the dominant current mechanism would be diffusion, which contradicts the assumptions of the Mott-Gurney equation. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

- **Option B**: This describes a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (e.g., Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current. This aligns with the conditions required for the Mott-Gurney equation to be valid, as the current is dominated by drift and injection is efficient due to the absence of barriers. This option is correct.

- **Option C**: This describes a single-carrier device with a Schottky contact and negligible diffusion current. A Schottky contact introduces a carrier injection barrier, which complicates the current transport and may make the device injection-limited rather than space-charge-limited at lower voltages. Thus, this option is incorrect.

- **Option D**: This describes a two-carrier device with an Ohmic contact and negligible diffusion current. The Mott-Gurney equation applies to single-carrier devices, as the derivation assumes the dominance of one type of carrier. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The Mott-Gurney equation is valid for a trap-free single-carrier device with no carrier injection barrier (e.g., Ohmic contact) and negligible diffusion current, which matches the conditions described in **Option B**.
