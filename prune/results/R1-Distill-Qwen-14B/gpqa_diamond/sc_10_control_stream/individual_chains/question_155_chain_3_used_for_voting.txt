Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, okay, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Let me start by understanding what each part of the problem says.

First, the problem describes the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each is given as a 3x3 matrix. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which probably means that the system is in the eigenbasis of P_z. But wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, so I need to find how this state relates to the P_z basis.

The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So the state is |ψ> = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ].

The uncertainty in P_z is ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). But since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, I'm not sure if it's an eigenstate of P_z. Probably not, since P_x and P_z don't commute. So I'll have to compute the expectation values.

Wait, the state is given in the P_z basis. Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, that means the state vector is already expressed in terms of P_z's eigenstates. Oh, that's helpful. So each component of the state vector corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z. 

So, for a 3x3 system, I think P_z has three eigenvalues. Looking at the matrix for P_z:

P_z matrix is:
[ ħ   0    0 ]
[ 0   0    0 ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ. So the basis vectors are |+ħ>, |0>, |-ħ> along the z-axis.

The state vector |ψ> is a combination of these states. So |ψ> = (-1/2)|+ħ> + (1/√2)|0> + (-1/2)|-ħ>.

Wait, but how are the basis vectors ordered? The first row is [ ħ 0 0 ], so the first basis vector is |+ħ>, the second is |0>, third is |-ħ>.

So, the state is |ψ> = a|+ħ> + b|0> + c|−ħ>, where a=-1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

Now, to find the expectation value <P_z>, which is <ψ| P_z |ψ>. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, this is simply the sum of |a|^2 * (+ħ) + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-ħ).

Let me compute each coefficient's magnitude squared.

|a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Wait, a is -1/2, so squared is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

|b|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

|c|^2 is also (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

So <P_z> is (1/4)*(+ħ) + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = [ (1/4) - (1/4) ] ħ = 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero.

Now, for the expectation value of P_z squared, <P_z^2>. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z^2 will have eigenvalues squared. So each term is |a|^2*(+ħ)^2 + |b|^2*(0)^2 + |c|^2*(−ħ)^2.

So that's (1/4) * ħ² + 0 + (1/4) * ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So, ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - ( <P_z> )² ) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ² ) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait a second, but I'm not sure. Let me double-check the calculations. 

Alternative approach: Maybe the state is not normalized. Let me check. The state vector has components (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let's compute the sum of the squares of the absolute values: 

(-1/2)^2 = 1/4,

(1/√2)^2 = 1/2,

(-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Sum is 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. So it's normalized. Good.

So <P_z> is 0, and <P_z^2> is (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = 1/2 ħ². So the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ / sqrt(2). That would be option B.

Wait, but let me think again. The state is in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. Since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, it's not an eigenstate of P_z, so the uncertainty should be non-zero. And the calculation supports that.

But wait, just to make sure I'm not missing anything else. For example, are there any cross terms or something else? No, since in the P_z basis, the state is expressed as a diagonal combination, so when calculating <P_z> and <P_z²>, cross terms would only come into play if the operator had off-diagonal elements in that basis, which it doesn't. So since P_z is diagonal, the expectation values are straightforward.

So the answer should be B) ħ/sqrt(2).

To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ in the $P_z$ operator, we start by noting that the system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\hbar$, and the state vector is given as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, and the eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. Since the state vector is expressed in the $P_z$ basis, the components of $|\psi\rangle$ correspond to the coefficients of the eigenstates $|+\hbar\rangle$, $|0\rangle$, and $|-\hbar\rangle$.

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value of $P_z$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle.
\]

Since $P_z$ is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 (\hbar) + |b|^2 (0) + |c|^2 (-\hbar),
\]

where $a = -\frac{1}{2}$, $b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $c = -\frac{1}{2}$. The squared magnitudes are:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The expectation value of $P_z^2$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle.
\]

Since $P_z^2$ is also diagonal in this basis, the expectation value is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 (\hbar^2) + |b|^2 (0^2) + |c|^2 (-\hbar)^2.
\]

Substituting the squared magnitudes and eigenvalues:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty in $P_z$ is given by:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty in $P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, okay, the question is about finding the uncertainty in the P_z operator, ΔP_z, given that the system is in an eigenstate of P_x with a specific eigenvalue. Let me start by understanding what each part of the problem says.

First, the problem describes the operators P_x, P_y, and P_z. Each is given as a 3x3 matrix. The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, which probably means that the system is in the eigenbasis of P_z. But wait, the system is in an eigenstate of P_x, so I need to find how this state relates to the P_z basis.

The state vector is given as a column vector with elements (-1/2, 1/sqrt(2), -1/2). So the state is |ψ> = [ -1/2; 1/√2; -1/2 ].

The uncertainty in P_z is ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - <P_z>² ). But since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, I'm not sure if it's an eigenstate of P_z. Probably not, since P_x and P_z don't commute. So I'll have to compute the expectation values.

Wait, the state is given in the P_z basis. Because the basis vectors are the eigenvectors of P_z, that means the state vector is already expressed in terms of P_z's eigenstates. Oh, that's helpful. So each component of the state vector corresponds to an eigenvalue of P_z. 

So, for a 3x3 system, I think P_z has three eigenvalues. Looking at the matrix for P_z:

P_z matrix is:
[ ħ   0    0 ]
[ 0   0    0 ]
[ 0   0  -ħ ]

So the eigenvalues are ħ, 0, and -ħ. So the basis vectors are |+ħ>, |0>, |-ħ> along the z-axis.

The state vector |ψ> is a combination of these states. So |ψ> = (-1/2)|+ħ> + (1/√2)|0> + (-1/2)|-ħ>.

Wait, but how are the basis vectors ordered? The first row is [ ħ 0 0 ], so the first basis vector is |+ħ>, the second is |0>, third is |-ħ>.

So, the state is |ψ> = a|+ħ> + b|0> + c|−ħ>, where a=-1/2, b=1/√2, c=-1/2.

Now, to find the expectation value <P_z>, which is <ψ| P_z |ψ>. Since P_z is diagonal in this basis, this is simply the sum of |a|^2 * (+ħ) + |b|^2 * 0 + |c|^2 * (-ħ).

Let me compute each coefficient's magnitude squared.

|a|^2 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Wait, a is -1/2, so squared is (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

|b|^2 = (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

|c|^2 is also (1/2)^2 = 1/4.

So <P_z> is (1/4)*(+ħ) + (1/2)*0 + (1/4)*(-ħ) = [ (1/4) - (1/4) ] ħ = 0.

Hmm, that's interesting. So the expectation value is zero.

Now, for the expectation value of P_z squared, <P_z^2>. Since P_z is diagonal, P_z^2 will have eigenvalues squared. So each term is |a|^2*(+ħ)^2 + |b|^2*(0)^2 + |c|^2*(−ħ)^2.

So that's (1/4) * ħ² + 0 + (1/4) * ħ² = (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = (1/2) ħ².

So, ΔP_z = sqrt( <P_z²> - ( <P_z> )² ) = sqrt( (1/2 ħ² ) - 0 ) = sqrt( (1/2) ħ² ) = ħ / sqrt(2).

Wait a second, but I'm not sure. Let me double-check the calculations. 

Alternative approach: Maybe the state is not normalized. Let me check. The state vector has components (-1/2, 1/√2, -1/2). Let's compute the sum of the squares of the absolute values: 

(-1/2)^2 = 1/4,

(1/√2)^2 = 1/2,

(-1/2)^2 = 1/4.

Sum is 1/4 + 1/2 + 1/4 = 1. So it's normalized. Good.

So <P_z> is 0, and <P_z^2> is (1/4 + 1/4) ħ² = 1/2 ħ². So the uncertainty is sqrt(1/2 ħ²) = ħ / sqrt(2). That would be option B.

Wait, but let me think again. The state is in the eigenstate of P_x with eigenvalue -ħ. Since the state is an eigenstate of P_x, it's not an eigenstate of P_z, so the uncertainty should be non-zero. And the calculation supports that.

But wait, just to make sure I'm not missing anything else. For example, are there any cross terms or something else? No, since in the P_z basis, the state is expressed as a diagonal combination, so when calculating <P_z> and <P_z²>, cross terms would only come into play if the operator had off-diagonal elements in that basis, which it doesn't. So since P_z is diagonal, the expectation values are straightforward.

So the answer should be B) ħ/sqrt(2).


To determine the uncertainty $\Delta P_z$ in the $P_z$ operator, we start by noting that the system is in the eigenstate of $P_x$ with eigenvalue $-\hbar$, and the state vector is given as:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -\frac{1}{2} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ -\frac{1}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The basis vectors are the eigenvectors of $P_z$, and the eigenvalues of $P_z$ are $\hbar$, $0$, and $-\hbar$. Since the state vector is expressed in the $P_z$ basis, the components of $|\psi\rangle$ correspond to the coefficients of the eigenstates $|+\hbar\rangle$, $|0\rangle$, and $|-\hbar\rangle$.

### Step 1: Compute $\langle P_z \rangle$
The expectation value of $P_z$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z | \psi \rangle.
\]

Since $P_z$ is diagonal in this basis, the expectation value is:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = |a|^2 (\hbar) + |b|^2 (0) + |c|^2 (-\hbar),
\]

where $a = -\frac{1}{2}$, $b = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, and $c = -\frac{1}{2}$. The squared magnitudes are:

\[
|a|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}, \quad |b|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \quad |c|^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Substituting these values:

\[
\langle P_z \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(-\hbar) = 0.
\]

### Step 2: Compute $\langle P_z^2 \rangle$
The expectation value of $P_z^2$ is given by:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \langle \psi | P_z^2 | \psi \rangle.
\]

Since $P_z^2$ is also diagonal in this basis, the expectation value is:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = |a|^2 (\hbar^2) + |b|^2 (0^2) + |c|^2 (-\hbar)^2.
\]

Substituting the squared magnitudes and eigenvalues:

\[
\langle P_z^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) + \frac{1}{2}(0) + \frac{1}{4}(\hbar^2) = \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 + \frac{1}{4} \hbar^2 = \frac{1}{2} \hbar^2.
\]

### Step 3: Compute $\Delta P_z$
The uncertainty in $P_z$ is given by:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\langle P_z^2 \rangle - \langle P_z \rangle^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta P_z = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2 - 0^2} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2} \hbar^2} = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The uncertainty in $P_z$ is $\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2}}$, which corresponds to option **B**.
