Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound that has a total of 8 carbon atoms. Oh wait, a di-substituted benzene ring would normally have 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. Because 6 + 2 = 8. So the substituents on the benzene ring are probably adding two carbons each or maybe one substituent adds two and another adds zero? Hmm.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group (so maybe a ketone or an aldehyde or something like that) and an aromatic-halogen bond. Oh, aromatic-halogen is like a halogen attached directly to the benzene ring. So substituents could be a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

Wait, so the molecule has a benzene ring with two substituents: one is probably a carbonyl group (like a ketone, since it's a di-substituted), and another is a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.). Or maybe the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and another group that includes a halogen, but I think it's more likely that each substituent is either a carbonyl group or a halogen. Wait, but the IR shows both a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen, so both substituents must be present.

Wait, but wait, di-substituted 6-membered ring with 8 carbons. So the benzene is 6 carbons. The substituents add two carbons. So each substituent is one carbon, but maybe one is a carbonyl-containing group and the other is a halogen. Wait, that doesn't add up because the substituents would be either one or two carbons each.

Wait, let me think: the molecule has 8 carbons in total. Benzene has 6, so the two substituents add 2 carbons. So perhaps each substituent is a methyl group (but that's 2 substituents each with 1 carbon, adding 2). But wait, but in the IR, there are signs of a carbonyl and a halogen. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl (like a ketone group), and the other is a chloro group?

Wait, wait, ketone is a carbonyl group. So maybe one substituent is a ketone, like a propanone substituent? No, that's more than one carbon. Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone, which is a carbonyl attached directly to the ring) and a halogen.

Wait, no, because a carbonyl group would require at least two carbons: R-CO-R'. Wait, maybe it's an acyl group attached. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group (like an acetyl group) and a halogen. Let me think about the structure.

If the ring is di-substituted, then the substituents are in positions that could be para, meta, or ortho. But the NMR will help us figure that out.

Looking at the options, each has different NMR signals. Let me think about each option.

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). 9.9 is a sharp singlet. That's a high chemical shift, possibly an aldehyde proton. The doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 suggest two sets of aromatic protons. The 3.7 ppm is probably an OCH3 group, but wait, that would be 3 protons if it's OCH3. But here, it's 2H, so maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe a methylene group attached to an oxygen, like an -OCH2- group?

But wait, if there's a carbonyl group, like a ketone, maybe the substituents are a ketone and a halogen. Let's think: if it's a para-substituted benzene with a ketone and a Cl, for example.

Wait, but benzaldehyde has a carbonyl group (CHO), so that would account for the 9.9 ppm singlet. But benzaldehyde is mono-substituted. If it's di-substituted with a Cl and a CHO, then in para positions, the aromatic protons would be two doublets in the NMR.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit lost. Let me think about the substituents.

The molecule has 8 carbons: benzene (6 C) + substituents (2 C). So the substituents must be two groups each contributing 1 carbon. But a carbonyl group (like a ketone) would be R-CO-R'. For example, if one substituent is a ketone group, like a methyl ketone (COCH3), that's 2 carbons (the CO and the CH3). Wait, no, the CO is one carbon, and the CH3 is another. So a ketone substituent would contribute 2 carbons. But the other substituent is a halogen, which is just one atom, not a carbon. So if one substituent is a ketone (2 C) and the other is a halogen (0 C), that would add 2 carbons to the benzene. Wait, that would make the total carbons 6 + 2 = 8. So that works.

So the structure would be benzene ring with a ketone substituent and a halogen substituent. Let's say the substituents are COCH3 and Cl. Wait, but COCH3 is an acetyl group, which is (CH3)CO-. So that's two carbons.

So the structure would be something like para-chloroacetophenone. So the substituents are Cl and COCH3.

In such a case, the IR would show a strong carbonyl peak (around 1700 cm^-1) and a peak for the aromatic C-Cl stretch (around 600-800 cm^-1? I'm a bit unsure about the exact region, but I know that C-H stretch for aromatic C-H is around 3000, and C-Cl is lower frequency).

So, in the NMR, the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern. Since the substituents are in para positions (Cl and COCH3), the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons as doublets. So in the NMR, you would see two doublets each integrating to 2H, which matches option A and option C.

Wait, option A has 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). So that fits the para substitution. But option C has 7.8 and 7.6 as d as well. What else?

Option A also has a peak at 9.9 ppm, which is a singlet for 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton. But wait, in the substituent I'm considering (COCH3), there's no aldehyde. Oh wait, maybe the substituent is an aldehyde and a halogen.

Wait, that's another possibility. If the substituents are CHO and Cl, then the ring would be di-substituted with aldehyde and Cl. Then the aldehyde proton would be a singlet around 9.9 ppm, which is option A. So in that case, the substituents would be CHO (1 carbon) and Cl (0 carbons). That would make the total carbons 6 (benzene) +1 (CHO) =7, but the question says 8 carbons. Oh, so that can't be right. Because 6 + 1 (CHO) =7, but total is 8. So that's a problem.

Wait, unless the substituent is a more complex group. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a ketone group, which has two carbons. For example, COCH2Cl? No, that would add more than two carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the total carbons are 8. So 6 in the ring, substituents add 2. So substituents could be a methyl ketone (COCH3) and a Cl. That's two substituents with 2 carbons and 0, respectively. So that makes 6+2=8.

So the structure is para-chloroacetophenone. So the substituents are Cl and COCH3.

In that structure, the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. So in the NMR, peaks at around 7.6 and 7.8 ppm, each as doublets. That's present in option A and option C.

But wait, option A also has a peak at 3.7 ppm (2H, s). Hmm, how does that fit in.

Wait, in para-chloroacetophenone, the substituents are Cl and COCH3. The COCH3 group would have the CH3 attached to the carbonyl, so the CH3 protons would be around 2.6 ppm as a singlet. But in option A, the 3.7 ppm is a singlet for 2H. So maybe it's something else.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group that's part of a larger substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group, but that may complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group with a methylene group attached. Wait, like a ketone with an adjacent methylene group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, but that would be COCH3.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and another group that has a methylene, like OCH2Cl or something. Hmm, but that might add more carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group (like COOCH3), but that would be an ester group. Let's think: benzene ring with COOCH3 and another substituent, but then the carbons would be 6 + 3 (COOCH3) =9, which is over.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options.

Option A: 9.9 ppm is a singlet for 1H. That's an aldehyde proton. So substituent would include an aldehyde group. But earlier, I thought that would add one carbon, making total 7, which is less than 8.

Wait, unless the substituent is a CH2CHO group. No, that would add more than one carbon.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a benzyl group with a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone, but not as COCH3. Maybe it's a group like COCH2Cl, but that would have another Cl and another CH2 group, which may complicate the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to a benzene ring. Wait, but that's the same as the ring itself.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Let's think about the NMR data.

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s) → likely aldehyde.

7.8 and 7.6 (each 2H, d) → aromatic protons, para substitution.

3.7 ppm (2H, s) → maybe a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom, like O. For example, OCH2. But why would there be a singlet? If it's a methylene group connected to something else, but since it's a singlet, maybe it's between two identical groups.

Wait, another possibility is that the 3.7 ppm is a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2O, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, considering the substituent is a ketone (COCH3) and something else. Wait, but in that case, the CH3 would be around 2.6 ppm as a singlet. But in option A, there's a peak at 3.7 ppm. So perhaps it's not a CH3 group.

Hmm, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to a benzyl group. Like benzophenone? No, that would have a different structure.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a carbonyl in the IR suggests a ketone, aldehyde, or another carbonyl-containing group. The presence of aromatic-halogen suggests a substituent like Cl, Br, etc.

Looking at option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 ppm (3H, s). The 2.3 ppm is a singlet for 3H, which is likely a CH3 group attached to something deshielded, like a carbonyl. So perhaps it's a COCH3 group.

So in that case, the substituent is COCH3 (2 carbons) and another substituent. But the total carbons must be 8. Benzene (6) + substituents (2) → total 8. So substituents are COCH3 and something else. But wait, COCH3 is two carbons, so the other substituent must be zero carbons. So the other substituent is a halogen (like Cl).

So the structure is para-substituted: COCH3 and Cl. Then, the NMR would show aromatic protons as two doublets, integrating to 2H each. And the COCH3 would have a singlet around 2.6 ppm for the CH3. But in option C, the singlet is at 2.3 ppm, which is a bit low for a CH3 attached to a ketone, but possible.

Wait, but in option C, the singlet is 3H, which is a CH3 group. So the substituent is COCH3 and Cl on the ring. So aromatic protons are two doublets, and the CH3 is a singlet at 2.3. So NMR would match option C.

But wait, what about the IR? The IR has a carbonyl peak. So that makes sense, as it's a ketone.

But then, why does option A have a peak at 9.9 ppm? That's an aldehyde. So perhaps the substituent includes an aldehyde group.

Wait, but if the substituent is an aldehyde (CHO), that's one carbon. So the total would be 6 (benzene) + 1 (CHO) + ? But the total is 8, so another substituent would have to be 1 carbon. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a ketone (COCH2-) and another substituent is a Cl. No, that would add more than two carbons.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group with a methylene bridge. For example, maybe the substituent is a COCH2 group, but that would require another substituent to make up the two carbons.

This is getting complicated. Let me think again about the options.

Option C has a singlet at 2.3 ppm, which is 3H. That suggests a CH3 attached to something electronegative, like a carbonyl. So perhaps the substituent is COCH3 and another substituent. If the other substituent is a halogen, that's acceptable.

So in that case, the aromatic ring would have a COCH3 and a Cl in para positions. The aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets, which aligns with option C.

Additionally, the IR would show a carbonyl peak and the aromatic C-Cl peak.

Now, looking at the NMR in option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). That fits with a para-substituted benzene with COCH3 and Cl. The aromatic protons would be as doublets, and the COCH3's CH3 would be a singlet around 2.3 ppm.

So option C seems to fit.

Wait, but another option is option A. Let me think again.

Option A has a singlet at 9.9 ppm (1H). That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton. So the substituent would have an aldehyde group. But earlier, I thought that would make the total carbons 7, which is less than 8. Therefore, perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, unless the substituent is a benzaldehyde group, but that's already a benzene ring. No, that wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2CHO group attached to the ring. That would add two carbons (the CH2 and CHO), so substituents would be CH2CHO and something else. But wait, that would require another substituent. Hmm, but the total substituents should add to two carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a CH2CO group and a Cl. Then substituents would be CH2COCl, but that's a substituent with more than two carbons.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me recap.

The structure has 8 carbons: benzene (6 C) + substituents (2 C). The substituents must include a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Which options have a singlet integrating to 3H (probably a CH3) or a singlet integrating to 1H (a CHO)?

Looking at the options:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s) → possibly aldehyde. The 3.7 (2H, s) → maybe a CH2 group attached to something. But that would require substituents that add up to 3 carbons (CHO is 1 C, CH2 is another 2 C), which would make total 6 +3 =9, which is more than 8. So that's impossible.

So option A is unlikely.

Option B: 4.8 and 4.6 (each 2H, d), and 1.3 (3H, s). That looks like two sets of -OCH2- groups. Maybe something like a diether or a gem-dialkoxy group. Not sure, but the presence of 1.3 ppm (3H, s) suggests a CH3 group attached to something. But where's the carbonyl group? Option B doesn't have a peak in the aromatic region, which is where the ring protons would be. So the compound in option B probably doesn't have an aromatic ring, which contradicts the question. So option B is out.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 and 4.6 (each 2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 is a singlet, maybe an aromatic proton in a symmetric environment. The other peaks suggest two sets of CH2 groups. But again, no peaks in the aromatic region except for 6.9, which is a single proton. So perhaps a mono-substituted ring? But the question says di-substituted, so D probably isn't correct.

So, that leaves option C. Which has aromatic peaks at 7.8 and 7.6, which are doublets, suggesting para substitution. The 2.3 ppm (3H, s) fits a COCH3 group. Plus, the IR would have a carbonyl peak from the ketone and a C-Cl stretch.

So the correct NMR would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound in question is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons, so the two substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond, suggesting the substituents are likely a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., a ketone) and a halogen (e.g., Cl).

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - Peaks: 9.9 ppm (1H, s), 7.8 ppm (2H, d), 7.6 ppm (2H, d), 3.7 ppm (2H, s).  
   - The 9.9 ppm singlet is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, but this would only add 1 carbon to the benzene ring. To reach a total of 8 carbons, the second substituent would need to contribute another carbon, which is inconsistent with the presence of a halogen (0 carbons).  
   - **Conclusion**: This option is unlikely.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Peaks: 4.8 ppm (2H, d), 4.6 ppm (2H, d), 1.3 ppm (3H, s).  
   - These peaks suggest the presence of CH2 groups and a CH3 group, likely part of an ether or similar structure. However, there are no peaks in the aromatic region (7.0–8.5 ppm), which contradicts the di-substituted aromatic ring described in the question.  
   - **Conclusion**: This option is incorrect.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Peaks: 7.8 ppm (2H, d), 7.6 ppm (2H, d), 2.3 ppm (3H, s).  
   - The two doublets at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm are consistent with aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. The singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H) corresponds to a CH3 group attached to a carbonyl, such as in a COCH3 group.  
   - This structure aligns with a para-substituted benzene ring with substituents COCH3 (2 carbons) and Cl (0 carbons), satisfying the total of 8 carbons.  
   - **Conclusion**: This option is correct.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Peaks: 6.9 ppm (1H, s), 4.8 ppm (2H, d), 4.6 ppm (2H, d), 1.3 ppm (2H, s).  
   - The single proton at 6.9 ppm suggests an aromatic proton in a unique environment, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring. Additionally, the peaks at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm suggest CH2 groups, which do not align with the aromatic and carbonyl-containing structure described.  
   - **Conclusion**: This option is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
The correct NMR data corresponds to **Option C**, which matches a para-substituted benzene ring with COCH3 and Cl as substituents. The aromatic protons appear as two doublets, and the CH3 group of the COCH3 substituent appears as a singlet at 2.3 ppm.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound that has a total of 8 carbon atoms. Oh wait, a di-substituted benzene ring would normally have 6 carbons, so the substituents must add up to 2 more carbons. Because 6 + 2 = 8. So the substituents on the benzene ring are probably adding two carbons each or maybe one substituent adds two and another adds zero? Hmm.

The FTIR spectrum shows peaks for a carbonyl group (so maybe a ketone or an aldehyde or something like that) and an aromatic-halogen bond. Oh, aromatic-halogen is like a halogen attached directly to the benzene ring. So substituents could be a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

Wait, so the molecule has a benzene ring with two substituents: one is probably a carbonyl group (like a ketone, since it's a di-substituted), and another is a halogen (like Cl, Br, etc.). Or maybe the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group and another group that includes a halogen, but I think it's more likely that each substituent is either a carbonyl group or a halogen. Wait, but the IR shows both a carbonyl and an aromatic-halogen, so both substituents must be present.

Wait, but wait, di-substituted 6-membered ring with 8 carbons. So the benzene is 6 carbons. The substituents add two carbons. So each substituent is one carbon, but maybe one is a carbonyl-containing group and the other is a halogen. Wait, that doesn't add up because the substituents would be either one or two carbons each.

Wait, let me think: the molecule has 8 carbons in total. Benzene has 6, so the two substituents add 2 carbons. So perhaps each substituent is a methyl group (but that's 2 substituents each with 1 carbon, adding 2). But wait, but in the IR, there are signs of a carbonyl and a halogen. So maybe one substituent is a carbonyl (like a ketone group), and the other is a chloro group?

Wait, wait, ketone is a carbonyl group. So maybe one substituent is a ketone, like a propanone substituent? No, that's more than one carbon. Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone, which is a carbonyl attached directly to the ring) and a halogen.

Wait, no, because a carbonyl group would require at least two carbons: R-CO-R'. Wait, maybe it's an acyl group attached. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are a carbonyl-containing group (like an acetyl group) and a halogen. Let me think about the structure.

If the ring is di-substituted, then the substituents are in positions that could be para, meta, or ortho. But the NMR will help us figure that out.

Looking at the options, each has different NMR signals. Let me think about each option.

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). 9.9 is a sharp singlet. That's a high chemical shift, possibly an aldehyde proton. The doublets at 7.8 and 7.6 suggest two sets of aromatic protons. The 3.7 ppm is probably an OCH3 group, but wait, that would be 3 protons if it's OCH3. But here, it's 2H, so maybe it's something else. Alternatively, maybe a methylene group attached to an oxygen, like an -OCH2- group?

But wait, if there's a carbonyl group, like a ketone, maybe the substituents are a ketone and a halogen. Let's think: if it's a para-substituted benzene with a ketone and a Cl, for example.

Wait, but benzaldehyde has a carbonyl group (CHO), so that would account for the 9.9 ppm singlet. But benzaldehyde is mono-substituted. If it's di-substituted with a Cl and a CHO, then in para positions, the aromatic protons would be two doublets in the NMR.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit lost. Let me think about the substituents.

The molecule has 8 carbons: benzene (6 C) + substituents (2 C). So the substituents must be two groups each contributing 1 carbon. But a carbonyl group (like a ketone) would be R-CO-R'. For example, if one substituent is a ketone group, like a methyl ketone (COCH3), that's 2 carbons (the CO and the CH3). Wait, no, the CO is one carbon, and the CH3 is another. So a ketone substituent would contribute 2 carbons. But the other substituent is a halogen, which is just one atom, not a carbon. So if one substituent is a ketone (2 C) and the other is a halogen (0 C), that would add 2 carbons to the benzene. Wait, that would make the total carbons 6 + 2 = 8. So that works.

So the structure would be benzene ring with a ketone substituent and a halogen substituent. Let's say the substituents are COCH3 and Cl. Wait, but COCH3 is an acetyl group, which is (CH3)CO-. So that's two carbons.

So the structure would be something like para-chloroacetophenone. So the substituents are Cl and COCH3.

In such a case, the IR would show a strong carbonyl peak (around 1700 cm^-1) and a peak for the aromatic C-Cl stretch (around 600-800 cm^-1? I'm a bit unsure about the exact region, but I know that C-H stretch for aromatic C-H is around 3000, and C-Cl is lower frequency).

So, in the NMR, the aromatic protons would be in a certain pattern. Since the substituents are in para positions (Cl and COCH3), the ring would have two sets of equivalent protons as doublets. So in the NMR, you would see two doublets each integrating to 2H, which matches option A and option C.

Wait, option A has 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). So that fits the para substitution. But option C has 7.8 and 7.6 as d as well. What else?

Option A also has a peak at 9.9 ppm, which is a singlet for 1H. That's probably an aldehyde proton. But wait, in the substituent I'm considering (COCH3), there's no aldehyde. Oh wait, maybe the substituent is an aldehyde and a halogen.

Wait, that's another possibility. If the substituents are CHO and Cl, then the ring would be di-substituted with aldehyde and Cl. Then the aldehyde proton would be a singlet around 9.9 ppm, which is option A. So in that case, the substituents would be CHO (1 carbon) and Cl (0 carbons). That would make the total carbons 6 (benzene) +1 (CHO) =7, but the question says 8 carbons. Oh, so that can't be right. Because 6 + 1 (CHO) =7, but total is 8. So that's a problem.

Wait, unless the substituent is a more complex group. Wait, perhaps the substituent is a ketone group, which has two carbons. For example, COCH2Cl? No, that would add more than two carbons. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the total carbons are 8. So 6 in the ring, substituents add 2. So substituents could be a methyl ketone (COCH3) and a Cl. That's two substituents with 2 carbons and 0, respectively. So that makes 6+2=8.

So the structure is para-chloroacetophenone. So the substituents are Cl and COCH3.

In that structure, the aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. So in the NMR, peaks at around 7.6 and 7.8 ppm, each as doublets. That's present in option A and option C.

But wait, option A also has a peak at 3.7 ppm (2H, s). Hmm, how does that fit in.

Wait, in para-chloroacetophenone, the substituents are Cl and COCH3. The COCH3 group would have the CH3 attached to the carbonyl, so the CH3 protons would be around 2.6 ppm as a singlet. But in option A, the 3.7 ppm is a singlet for 2H. So maybe it's something else.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group that's part of a larger substituent. Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is an ester group, but that may complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group with a methylene group attached. Wait, like a ketone with an adjacent methylene group.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a methyl group attached to a carbonyl, but that would be COCH3.

Wait, maybe the substituents are a carbonyl group (like a ketone) and another group that has a methylene, like OCH2Cl or something. Hmm, but that might add more carbons. Wait, maybe I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group (like COOCH3), but that would be an ester group. Let's think: benzene ring with COOCH3 and another substituent, but then the carbons would be 6 + 3 (COOCH3) =9, which is over.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options.

Option A: 9.9 ppm is a singlet for 1H. That's an aldehyde proton. So substituent would include an aldehyde group. But earlier, I thought that would add one carbon, making total 7, which is less than 8.

Wait, unless the substituent is a CH2CHO group. No, that would add more than one carbon.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a benzyl group with a carbonyl. Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a ketone, but not as COCH3. Maybe it's a group like COCH2Cl, but that would have another Cl and another CH2 group, which may complicate the structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to a benzene ring. Wait, but that's the same as the ring itself.

Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently. Let's think about the NMR data.

Option A: 9.9 ppm (1H, s) → likely aldehyde.

7.8 and 7.6 (each 2H, d) → aromatic protons, para substitution.

3.7 ppm (2H, s) → maybe a CH2 group attached to an electronegative atom, like O. For example, OCH2. But why would there be a singlet? If it's a methylene group connected to something else, but since it's a singlet, maybe it's between two identical groups.

Wait, another possibility is that the 3.7 ppm is a methylene group adjacent to an oxygen, like OCH2O, but that might not fit.

Alternatively, considering the substituent is a ketone (COCH3) and something else. Wait, but in that case, the CH3 would be around 2.6 ppm as a singlet. But in option A, there's a peak at 3.7 ppm. So perhaps it's not a CH3 group.

Hmm, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group attached to a benzyl group. Like benzophenone? No, that would have a different structure.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a carbonyl in the IR suggests a ketone, aldehyde, or another carbonyl-containing group. The presence of aromatic-halogen suggests a substituent like Cl, Br, etc.

Looking at option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), and 2.3 ppm (3H, s). The 2.3 ppm is a singlet for 3H, which is likely a CH3 group attached to something deshielded, like a carbonyl. So perhaps it's a COCH3 group.

So in that case, the substituent is COCH3 (2 carbons) and another substituent. But the total carbons must be 8. Benzene (6) + substituents (2) → total 8. So substituents are COCH3 and something else. But wait, COCH3 is two carbons, so the other substituent must be zero carbons. So the other substituent is a halogen (like Cl).

So the structure is para-substituted: COCH3 and Cl. Then, the NMR would show aromatic protons as two doublets, integrating to 2H each. And the COCH3 would have a singlet around 2.6 ppm for the CH3. But in option C, the singlet is at 2.3 ppm, which is a bit low for a CH3 attached to a ketone, but possible.

Wait, but in option C, the singlet is 3H, which is a CH3 group. So the substituent is COCH3 and Cl on the ring. So aromatic protons are two doublets, and the CH3 is a singlet at 2.3. So NMR would match option C.

But wait, what about the IR? The IR has a carbonyl peak. So that makes sense, as it's a ketone.

But then, why does option A have a peak at 9.9 ppm? That's an aldehyde. So perhaps the substituent includes an aldehyde group.

Wait, but if the substituent is an aldehyde (CHO), that's one carbon. So the total would be 6 (benzene) + 1 (CHO) + ? But the total is 8, so another substituent would have to be 1 carbon. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a ketone (COCH2-) and another substituent is a Cl. No, that would add more than two carbons.

Wait, maybe the substituent is a carbonyl group with a methylene bridge. For example, maybe the substituent is a COCH2 group, but that would require another substituent to make up the two carbons.

This is getting complicated. Let me think again about the options.

Option C has a singlet at 2.3 ppm, which is 3H. That suggests a CH3 attached to something electronegative, like a carbonyl. So perhaps the substituent is COCH3 and another substituent. If the other substituent is a halogen, that's acceptable.

So in that case, the aromatic ring would have a COCH3 and a Cl in para positions. The aromatic protons would be two sets of doublets, which aligns with option C.

Additionally, the IR would show a carbonyl peak and the aromatic C-Cl peak.

Now, looking at the NMR in option C: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s). That fits with a para-substituted benzene with COCH3 and Cl. The aromatic protons would be as doublets, and the COCH3's CH3 would be a singlet around 2.3 ppm.

So option C seems to fit.

Wait, but another option is option A. Let me think again.

Option A has a singlet at 9.9 ppm (1H). That's a strong indication of an aldehyde proton. So the substituent would have an aldehyde group. But earlier, I thought that would make the total carbons 7, which is less than 8. Therefore, perhaps that's not possible.

Wait, unless the substituent is a benzaldehyde group, but that's already a benzene ring. No, that wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a CH2CHO group attached to the ring. That would add two carbons (the CH2 and CHO), so substituents would be CH2CHO and something else. But wait, that would require another substituent. Hmm, but the total substituents should add to two carbons.

Wait, perhaps it's a benzene ring with a CH2CO group and a Cl. Then substituents would be CH2COCl, but that's a substituent with more than two carbons.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me recap.

The structure has 8 carbons: benzene (6 C) + substituents (2 C). The substituents must include a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Which options have a singlet integrating to 3H (probably a CH3) or a singlet integrating to 1H (a CHO)?

Looking at the options:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s) → possibly aldehyde. The 3.7 (2H, s) → maybe a CH2 group attached to something. But that would require substituents that add up to 3 carbons (CHO is 1 C, CH2 is another 2 C), which would make total 6 +3 =9, which is more than 8. So that's impossible.

So option A is unlikely.

Option B: 4.8 and 4.6 (each 2H, d), and 1.3 (3H, s). That looks like two sets of -OCH2- groups. Maybe something like a diether or a gem-dialkoxy group. Not sure, but the presence of 1.3 ppm (3H, s) suggests a CH3 group attached to something. But where's the carbonyl group? Option B doesn't have a peak in the aromatic region, which is where the ring protons would be. So the compound in option B probably doesn't have an aromatic ring, which contradicts the question. So option B is out.

Option D: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 and 4.6 (each 2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s). The 6.9 is a singlet, maybe an aromatic proton in a symmetric environment. The other peaks suggest two sets of CH2 groups. But again, no peaks in the aromatic region except for 6.9, which is a single proton. So perhaps a mono-substituted ring? But the question says di-substituted, so D probably isn't correct.

So, that leaves option C. Which has aromatic peaks at 7.8 and 7.6, which are doublets, suggesting para substitution. The 2.3 ppm (3H, s) fits a COCH3 group. Plus, the IR would have a carbonyl peak from the ketone and a C-Cl stretch.

So the correct NMR would be option C.


The compound in question is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The benzene ring contributes 6 carbons, so the two substituents must account for the remaining 2 carbons. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond, suggesting the substituents are likely a carbonyl-containing group (e.g., a ketone) and a halogen (e.g., Cl).

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - Peaks: 9.9 ppm (1H, s), 7.8 ppm (2H, d), 7.6 ppm (2H, d), 3.7 ppm (2H, s).  
   - The 9.9 ppm singlet is characteristic of an aldehyde proton, but this would only add 1 carbon to the benzene ring. To reach a total of 8 carbons, the second substituent would need to contribute another carbon, which is inconsistent with the presence of a halogen (0 carbons).  
   - **Conclusion**: This option is unlikely.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Peaks: 4.8 ppm (2H, d), 4.6 ppm (2H, d), 1.3 ppm (3H, s).  
   - These peaks suggest the presence of CH2 groups and a CH3 group, likely part of an ether or similar structure. However, there are no peaks in the aromatic region (7.0–8.5 ppm), which contradicts the di-substituted aromatic ring described in the question.  
   - **Conclusion**: This option is incorrect.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Peaks: 7.8 ppm (2H, d), 7.6 ppm (2H, d), 2.3 ppm (3H, s).  
   - The two doublets at 7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm are consistent with aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene ring. The singlet at 2.3 ppm (3H) corresponds to a CH3 group attached to a carbonyl, such as in a COCH3 group.  
   - This structure aligns with a para-substituted benzene ring with substituents COCH3 (2 carbons) and Cl (0 carbons), satisfying the total of 8 carbons.  
   - **Conclusion**: This option is correct.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Peaks: 6.9 ppm (1H, s), 4.8 ppm (2H, d), 4.6 ppm (2H, d), 1.3 ppm (2H, s).  
   - The single proton at 6.9 ppm suggests an aromatic proton in a unique environment, which is inconsistent with a di-substituted benzene ring. Additionally, the peaks at 4.8 ppm and 4.6 ppm suggest CH2 groups, which do not align with the aromatic and carbonyl-containing structure described.  
   - **Conclusion**: This option is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
The correct NMR data corresponds to **Option C**, which matches a para-substituted benzene ring with COCH3 and Cl as substituents. The aromatic protons appear as two doublets, and the CH3 group of the COCH3 substituent appears as a singlet at 2.3 ppm.

**Answer: C**
