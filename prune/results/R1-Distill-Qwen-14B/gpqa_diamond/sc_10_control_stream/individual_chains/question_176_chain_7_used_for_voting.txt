Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to think it through. Alright, the question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, on a quantum system. The state of the system is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1), and we have the matrices for the operators P and Q. The question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring them in that specific order.

Hmm, let me recall what I know about observables and measurements. Observables correspond to Hermitian operators, and when you measure an observable, you can only get one of its eigenvalues. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is determined by the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

Wait, the state is given as a column vector. Oh wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state is usually a unit vector, but this vector (-1, 2, 1) doesn't look normalized. Let me check: the magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the actual state vector is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

But wait, the problem statement says that the state is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So perhaps the state is already normalized? Because if I square those components, 1 +4 +1=6, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).

Wait, but perhaps the problem is presented in a way that ignores the normalization. Hmm, the problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix..." So I should probably treat it as a non-normalized state. Wait, but no, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are always normalized. So perhaps the problem statement is incorrect? Or maybe I should assume that the vector is actually normalized. Alternatively, maybe the probabilities will be the same regardless, but I'm not sure. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed considering that the given vector is normalized, but I'm not confident.

Wait, let me think again. The given vector is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Its squared norm is 6. So to get a normalized state, I need to divide each component by sqrt(6). So the actual state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. So I should probably use this normalized state for calculations.

Now, the first step is to measure P. The operator P has a matrix given with elements in the first row as (0, 1/√2, 0), second row as (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), third row as (0, 1/√2, 0). Let me write this matrix out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Wait, that looks familiar. It's a symmetric matrix, so it's Hermitian, which is correct for an observable.

I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P because the possible outcomes of the measurement are the eigenvalues, and the probability depends on the projection of the state onto the eigenvectors.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the eigenvalues of P. Let me think about the structure. The matrix P is symmetric and seems to have some pattern. Let me see if it's diagonalizable.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to notice that P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me compute its eigenvalues. The matrix has a particular form. Maybe I can find the eigenvalues by looking for patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that P^2 might be a simple matrix. Let me compute P squared.

P squared = P * P.

Let me compute each element:

First row of P is [0, 1/√2, 0].
Multiplying P by this row:

Element (1,1): 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2.
Element (1,2): 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0.
Element (1,3): 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2.

Wait, so the first row of P^2 would be [1/2, 0, 1/2].

Similarly, the second row of P is [1/√2, 0, 1/√2].

Multiplying P by this row:

Element (2,1): (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0.
Element (2,2): (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.
Element (2,3): (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0.

Third row of P is [0, 1/√2, 0].

Multiplying P by this row:

Element (3,1): 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2.
Element (3,2): 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0.
Element (3,3): 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 =1/2.

So P squared is:

[ [1/2, 0, 1/2],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [1/2, 0, 1/2] ]

Hmm, I wonder if P squared is the identity matrix? Let's see. The diagonal elements are 1/2, 1, and 1/2. Not 1, so no. Alternatively, perhaps P squared is (1/2) times something.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues of P can be found. Let me calculate the characteristic equation.

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(P - λ I) = 0.

So for P:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]
[0, 1/√2, -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps expanding it:

The determinant is calculated as:

-λ * [ (λ^2) - (1/2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) ] + 0 * something.

Wait, so:

= -λ (λ^2 - 1/2) - (1/√2)( -λ /√2 )
= -λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2)
= -λ^3 + λ.

So the characteristic equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ (λ² - 1) = 0 → λ = 0, 1, -1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

So when measuring P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.

The question is about the probability of getting 0 for P. So we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to P's eigenvalue 0.

Let me find the eigenvectors for P.

For λ=0:

(P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[0, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, 0]

We can write the equations:

Row 1: (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v1 = -v3.

Row3: (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is of the form (v1, 0, -v1). Choosing v1=1, we get (1, 0, -1). But we need to normalize it.

The norm squared is 1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 = 2 → norm is sqrt(2). So the eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, but let me double-check. The eigenvector is (v1, 0, -v1). So if I set v1 =1, it's (1, 0, -1), which is correct.

Now, the eigenvectors for P=0,1,-1 are needed, but perhaps for this problem, only the eigenvectors for P=0 and Q=-1 are needed.

Wait, but after measuring P=0, the state collapses to the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0. Then, we measure Q on that state. So the process is:

1. Measure P. The outcome is 0. The state becomes the normalized eigenvector for P=0.

2. Then measure Q on this new state. The outcome is -1. Find the probability of this.

But wait, the question is about measuring P and then Q. So the probabilities are the product of the probability of P=0 and, given that P=0, the probability of Q=-1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the state after measuring P=0, then compute the probability for Q=-1.

Wait, but perhaps another approach is to compute the probability of P=0 and Q=-1, in sequence.

So the overall probability would be P_P0 * P_Q-1_given_P0.

So let me take the initial state vector |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).

First, compute the probability of measuring P=0.

The eigenvector for P=0 is |e0> = [1, 0, -1]/sqrt(2).

The inner product between |ψ> and |e0> is:

( (-1)/sqrt(6) )*(1/sqrt(2)) + (2/sqrt(6))*0 + (1/sqrt(6))*(-1/sqrt(2)) )

= [ (-1) + (-1) ] / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) )
= (-2) / (sqrt(12)) )
= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )
= -1/sqrt(3)

The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So P_P0 is 1/3.

Then, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to |e0>, which is [1,0,-1]/sqrt(2).

Now, we measure Q on this state. What is the probability of getting Q=-1?

The operator Q is given by the matrix:

Q = [
[1, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, -1]
]

Hmm, this is a diagonal matrix with entries 1, 0, -1. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

Eigenvector for Q=1 is |e1> = [1,0,0]^T.

Eigenvector for Q=0 is |e0_Q> = [0,1,0]^T.

Eigenvector for Q=-1 is |e-1> = [0,0,1]^T.

So to find the probability of measuring Q=-1, we need the component of the state |e0> in the direction of |e-1>.

The state after P=0 is |e0> = [1,0,-1]/sqrt(2).

The projection onto |e-1> is the inner product:

< e-1 | e0 > = (0)(1) + (0)(0) + (1)(-1) / sqrt(2) ) → (-1)/sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the absolute value: (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

Wait, no. Wait, |e-1> is [0,0,1]^T, so the inner product is (0)(1) + 0 + (1)(-1)/sqrt(2) → (-1)/sqrt(2). The square is (1/2).

So the probability of Q=-1 given that P=0 is 1/2.

Therefore, the overall probability is P_P0 (1/3) multiplied by P_Q-1_given_P0 (1/2) → (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, but let me make sure. When we have the state after P=0, it's |e0> = [1,0,-1]/sqrt(2). To measure Q, which is diagonal, the probabilities are based on the components in the Q eigenbasis.

So the components of |e0> in the Q basis are:

Component of Q=1: (1)(1)/sqrt(2) → 1/sqrt(2).

Component of Q=0: 0.

Component of Q=-1: (-1)/sqrt(2).

So the probabilities are (1/sqrt(2))^2 for Q=1 → 1/2, 0 for Q=0, and (1/sqrt(2))^2 → 1/2 for Q=-1.

So the probability of Q=-1 is indeed 1/2.

Therefore, the overall probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Wait, but wait another thing. The initial state is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ] / sqrt(6). So when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 0,1,-1. So the probability of P=0 is 1/3, as calculated.

But wait, when you measure P, the state collapses into an eigenvector of P. So in this case, only the component of |ψ> in the direction of |e0> (the eigenvector for P=0) survives.

So after that, the state is |e0>, and when you measure Q, the probability is 1/2 for Q=-1.

So yes, the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

So looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the normalization. Let me double-check the inner product calculation for P=0.

The initial state is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ] / sqrt(6).

The eigenvector |e0> for P=0 is [1, 0, -1] / sqrt(2).

Their inner product is ( (-1)/sqrt(6) ) * (1/sqrt(2)) + (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * ( -1/sqrt(2) )

= [ (-1) / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1) / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ]

= [ (-1) + (-1) ] / (sqrt(12) )

= (-2) / (2*sqrt(3)) ) → -1/sqrt(3).

The absolute square is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3. So that's correct.

I think the calculation is correct. So the probability is 1/6, which is option D.

The problem involves measuring two observables, \( P \) and \( Q \), on a quantum system. The state of the system is given as the column vector \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), which is not normalized. The norm is calculated as \( \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6} \), so the normalized state is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Measure \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found to be \( 0, 1, -1 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( P = 0 \) is:

\[
| e_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is determined by the projection of \( | \psi \rangle \) onto \( | e_0 \rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle e_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) \right] \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is the square of the absolute value:

\[
P(P=0) = \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 2: Measure \( Q \) after \( P = 0 \)
The operator \( Q \) is represented by the diagonal matrix:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding eigenvectors \( | e_1 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), \( | e_0 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), and \( | e_{-1} \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to \( | e_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is determined by the projection of \( | e_0 \rangle \) onto \( | e_{-1} \rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle e_{-1} | e_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (0)(1) + (0)(0) + (1)(-1) \right] = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is the square of the absolute value:

\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Combined Probability
The overall probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but let me try to think it through. Alright, the question is about measuring two observables, P and Q, on a quantum system. The state of the system is given as a column matrix (-1, 2, 1), and we have the matrices for the operators P and Q. The question asks for the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q when measuring them in that specific order.

Hmm, let me recall what I know about observables and measurements. Observables correspond to Hermitian operators, and when you measure an observable, you can only get one of its eigenvalues. The probability of getting a particular eigenvalue is determined by the square of the amplitude of the corresponding eigenvector in the state.

Wait, the state is given as a column vector. Oh wait, but in quantum mechanics, the state is usually a unit vector, but this vector (-1, 2, 1) doesn't look normalized. Let me check: the magnitude squared is (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1=6. So the norm is sqrt(6). Therefore, the actual state vector is (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

But wait, the problem statement says that the state is given by the column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). So perhaps the state is already normalized? Because if I square those components, 1 +4 +1=6, so the norm is sqrt(6). So the state vector is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).

Wait, but perhaps the problem is presented in a way that ignores the normalization. Hmm, the problem says "the state of a system at time t is given by the column matrix..." So I should probably treat it as a non-normalized state. Wait, but no, in quantum mechanics, the state vectors are always normalized. So perhaps the problem statement is incorrect? Or maybe I should assume that the vector is actually normalized. Alternatively, maybe the probabilities will be the same regardless, but I'm not sure. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed considering that the given vector is normalized, but I'm not confident.

Wait, let me think again. The given vector is [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. Its squared norm is 6. So to get a normalized state, I need to divide each component by sqrt(6). So the actual state is (1/sqrt(6)) * [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T. So I should probably use this normalized state for calculations.

Now, the first step is to measure P. The operator P has a matrix given with elements in the first row as (0, 1/√2, 0), second row as (1/√2, 0, 1/√2), third row as (0, 1/√2, 0). Let me write this matrix out:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

Wait, that looks familiar. It's a symmetric matrix, so it's Hermitian, which is correct for an observable.

I should find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P because the possible outcomes of the measurement are the eigenvalues, and the probability depends on the projection of the state onto the eigenvectors.

Alternatively, maybe I can find the eigenvalues of P. Let me think about the structure. The matrix P is symmetric and seems to have some pattern. Let me see if it's diagonalizable.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to notice that P is a 3x3 matrix. Let me compute its eigenvalues. The matrix has a particular form. Maybe I can find the eigenvalues by looking for patterns.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that P^2 might be a simple matrix. Let me compute P squared.

P squared = P * P.

Let me compute each element:

First row of P is [0, 1/√2, 0].
Multiplying P by this row:

Element (1,1): 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2.
Element (1,2): 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0.
Element (1,3): 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2.

Wait, so the first row of P^2 would be [1/2, 0, 1/2].

Similarly, the second row of P is [1/√2, 0, 1/√2].

Multiplying P by this row:

Element (2,1): (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0.
Element (2,2): (1/√2)*(1/√2) + 0*0 + (1/√2)*(1/√2) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.
Element (2,3): (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 = 0.

Third row of P is [0, 1/√2, 0].

Multiplying P by this row:

Element (3,1): 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 = 1/2.
Element (3,2): 0*(1/√2) + (1/√2)*0 + 0*(1/√2) = 0.
Element (3,3): 0*0 + (1/√2)(1/√2) + 0*0 =1/2.

So P squared is:

[ [1/2, 0, 1/2],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [1/2, 0, 1/2] ]

Hmm, I wonder if P squared is the identity matrix? Let's see. The diagonal elements are 1/2, 1, and 1/2. Not 1, so no. Alternatively, perhaps P squared is (1/2) times something.

Alternatively, perhaps the eigenvalues of P can be found. Let me calculate the characteristic equation.

The eigenvalues λ satisfy det(P - λ I) = 0.

So for P:

[ -λ, 1/√2, 0 ]
[1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]
[0, 1/√2, -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/√2)(1/√2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) - 0 ] + 0 * [ ... ]

Wait, perhaps expanding it:

The determinant is calculated as:

-λ * [ (λ^2) - (1/2) ] - (1/√2) * [ (1/√2)(-λ) ] + 0 * something.

Wait, so:

= -λ (λ^2 - 1/2) - (1/√2)( -λ /√2 )
= -λ^3 + (λ/2) + (λ/2)
= -λ^3 + λ.

So the characteristic equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0 → λ (λ² - 1) = 0 → λ = 0, 1, -1.

So the eigenvalues of P are 0, 1, and -1.

So when measuring P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.

The question is about the probability of getting 0 for P. So we need to find the eigenvector corresponding to P's eigenvalue 0.

Let me find the eigenvectors for P.

For λ=0:

(P - 0 I) v = 0 → P v = 0.

So the matrix becomes:

[0, 1/√2, 0]
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2]
[0, 1/√2, 0]

We can write the equations:

Row 1: (1/√2) v2 = 0 → v2 = 0.

Row 2: (1/√2) v1 + (1/√2) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v1 = -v3.

Row3: (1/√2) v2 =0 → v2=0.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 is of the form (v1, 0, -v1). Choosing v1=1, we get (1, 0, -1). But we need to normalize it.

The norm squared is 1^2 +0 + (-1)^2 = 2 → norm is sqrt(2). So the eigenvector is (1/sqrt(2), 0, -1/sqrt(2)).

Wait, but let me double-check. The eigenvector is (v1, 0, -v1). So if I set v1 =1, it's (1, 0, -1), which is correct.

Now, the eigenvectors for P=0,1,-1 are needed, but perhaps for this problem, only the eigenvectors for P=0 and Q=-1 are needed.

Wait, but after measuring P=0, the state collapses to the eigenvector of P corresponding to 0. Then, we measure Q on that state. So the process is:

1. Measure P. The outcome is 0. The state becomes the normalized eigenvector for P=0.

2. Then measure Q on this new state. The outcome is -1. Find the probability of this.

But wait, the question is about measuring P and then Q. So the probabilities are the product of the probability of P=0 and, given that P=0, the probability of Q=-1.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the state after measuring P=0, then compute the probability for Q=-1.

Wait, but perhaps another approach is to compute the probability of P=0 and Q=-1, in sequence.

So the overall probability would be P_P0 * P_Q-1_given_P0.

So let me take the initial state vector |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ]^T / sqrt(6).

First, compute the probability of measuring P=0.

The eigenvector for P=0 is |e0> = [1, 0, -1]/sqrt(2).

The inner product between |ψ> and |e0> is:

( (-1)/sqrt(6) )*(1/sqrt(2)) + (2/sqrt(6))*0 + (1/sqrt(6))*(-1/sqrt(2)) )

= [ (-1) + (-1) ] / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) )
= (-2) / (sqrt(12)) )
= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )
= -1/sqrt(3)

The probability is the square of the absolute value, which is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So P_P0 is 1/3.

Then, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to |e0>, which is [1,0,-1]/sqrt(2).

Now, we measure Q on this state. What is the probability of getting Q=-1?

The operator Q is given by the matrix:

Q = [
[1, 0, 0],
[0, 0, 0],
[0, 0, -1]
]

Hmm, this is a diagonal matrix with entries 1, 0, -1. So the eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1.

The corresponding eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

Eigenvector for Q=1 is |e1> = [1,0,0]^T.

Eigenvector for Q=0 is |e0_Q> = [0,1,0]^T.

Eigenvector for Q=-1 is |e-1> = [0,0,1]^T.

So to find the probability of measuring Q=-1, we need the component of the state |e0> in the direction of |e-1>.

The state after P=0 is |e0> = [1,0,-1]/sqrt(2).

The projection onto |e-1> is the inner product:

< e-1 | e0 > = (0)(1) + (0)(0) + (1)(-1) / sqrt(2) ) → (-1)/sqrt(2).

The probability is the square of the absolute value: (1/√2)^2 = 1/2.

Wait, no. Wait, |e-1> is [0,0,1]^T, so the inner product is (0)(1) + 0 + (1)(-1)/sqrt(2) → (-1)/sqrt(2). The square is (1/2).

So the probability of Q=-1 given that P=0 is 1/2.

Therefore, the overall probability is P_P0 (1/3) multiplied by P_Q-1_given_P0 (1/2) → (1/3)*(1/2) = 1/6.

Wait, but let me make sure. When we have the state after P=0, it's |e0> = [1,0,-1]/sqrt(2). To measure Q, which is diagonal, the probabilities are based on the components in the Q eigenbasis.

So the components of |e0> in the Q basis are:

Component of Q=1: (1)(1)/sqrt(2) → 1/sqrt(2).

Component of Q=0: 0.

Component of Q=-1: (-1)/sqrt(2).

So the probabilities are (1/sqrt(2))^2 for Q=1 → 1/2, 0 for Q=0, and (1/sqrt(2))^2 → 1/2 for Q=-1.

So the probability of Q=-1 is indeed 1/2.

Therefore, the overall probability is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Wait, but wait another thing. The initial state is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ] / sqrt(6). So when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 0,1,-1. So the probability of P=0 is 1/3, as calculated.

But wait, when you measure P, the state collapses into an eigenvector of P. So in this case, only the component of |ψ> in the direction of |e0> (the eigenvector for P=0) survives.

So after that, the state is |e0>, and when you measure Q, the probability is 1/2 for Q=-1.

So yes, the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

So looking at the options, option D is 1/6.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the normalization. Let me double-check the inner product calculation for P=0.

The initial state is |ψ> = [ -1, 2, 1 ] / sqrt(6).

The eigenvector |e0> for P=0 is [1, 0, -1] / sqrt(2).

Their inner product is ( (-1)/sqrt(6) ) * (1/sqrt(2)) + (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 + (1/sqrt(6)) * ( -1/sqrt(2) )

= [ (-1) / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ] + 0 + [ (-1) / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) ]

= [ (-1) + (-1) ] / (sqrt(12) )

= (-2) / (2*sqrt(3)) ) → -1/sqrt(3).

The absolute square is (1/sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3. So that's correct.

I think the calculation is correct. So the probability is 1/6, which is option D.


The problem involves measuring two observables, \( P \) and \( Q \), on a quantum system. The state of the system is given as the column vector \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \), which is not normalized. The norm is calculated as \( \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6} \), so the normalized state is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 1: Measure \( P \)
The operator \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found to be \( 0, 1, -1 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( P = 0 \) is:

\[
| e_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is determined by the projection of \( | \psi \rangle \) onto \( | e_0 \rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle e_0 | \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (1)(-1) \right] \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is the square of the absolute value:

\[
P(P=0) = \left| -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 2: Measure \( Q \) after \( P = 0 \)
The operator \( Q \) is represented by the diagonal matrix:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding eigenvectors \( | e_1 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), \( | e_0 \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), and \( | e_{-1} \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

After measuring \( P = 0 \), the state collapses to \( | e_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is determined by the projection of \( | e_0 \rangle \) onto \( | e_{-1} \rangle \). The inner product is:

\[
\langle e_{-1} | e_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[ (0)(1) + (0)(0) + (1)(-1) \right] = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

The probability is the square of the absolute value:

\[
P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Combined Probability
The overall probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P=0, Q=-1) = P(P=0) \cdot P(Q=-1 | P=0) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and \( Q = -1 \) is \( \frac{1}{6} \).
