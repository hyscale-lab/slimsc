Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give me the components P_x, P_y, and P_z as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, quantum operators... I remember that when dealing with angular momentum or spin, the operator components are defined in terms of their matrices. Since the problem is about a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operator components are represented by these 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

The direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. So the direction vector can be expressed as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in x-z, the y-component is zero. Or wait, maybe it's (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? Wait, no, the standard spherical coordinates have θ from the z-axis, so x is cosθ and z is sinθ. Wait, no, actually, in spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ is from the z-axis. So the position vector is (r sinθ cosφ, r sinθ sinφ, r cosθ). But here, the direction is in the x-z plane, which means φ is zero. So the direction vector would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because φ is zero, so the y-component is zero. Wait no, wait: if θ is measured from the z-axis, then the x-component is r sinθ cosφ. But since φ is zero in the x-z plane, cosφ is 1, so the x component is r sinθ. So the direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but since it's a unit vector, r=1, so it's (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the operator P is P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z) = sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z.

Wait, but the operator's direction is along n. So the operator for the component along n would be P_n = n · P, which is sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z.

So the operator we need to find the eigenvector for is P_n, which has eigenvalue +ħ/2. So we need to find a normalized eigenvector of P_n corresponding to this eigenvalue.

Wait, but the operator P_n is given by combining P_x, P_y, and P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, P_y component will be zero, so P_n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Wait, but the given P_x, P_y, P_z are each multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write that down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, P_n = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z. Let's compute that.

Wait, no, because P_x is already (ħ/2) times the matrix. So when you write P_n, you have to factor that in.

So, P_n = sinθ * (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1,0]] + cosθ * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

This can be written as (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside.

The identity matrix is [[1,0],[0,1]], but in this case, I have the matrices:

First term: sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] → [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
Second term: cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] → [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Adding these together:

Top left: cosθ
Top right: sinθ
Bottom left: sinθ
Bottom right: -cosθ

So the matrix is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So overall, P_n = (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ].

Now, we need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

So, the equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Let me write the matrix equation:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can multiply both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So, the matrix equation becomes:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

So, two equations:

1) (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
2) sinθ a + (-cosθ - 1) b = 0

Wait, wait, let's re-arrange the equations.

From equation 1: cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b =0.

From equation 2: sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b =0.

Hmm, so we have a system of two equations:

Equation 1: (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b =0

Equation 2: sinθ a + (- cosθ - 1) b =0

We can write this as a matrix:

[ (cosθ -1), sinθ        ] [a]   = 0
[ sinθ       , (-cosθ -1) ] [b]

For non-trivial solution (a and b not both zero), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.

Wait, but since we're looking for eigenvectors, these equations must be dependent. So the determinant should be zero, but perhaps we can find a relation between a and b.

Let me see equation 1: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b =0 → equation1: a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Similarly, from equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b =0 → equation2: a = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ] b

So, from equation 1 and 2, the expressions for a in terms of b must be equal.

So, [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ]

Let me compute the left side:

- sinθ / (cosθ -1) = [ sinθ ] / (1 - cosθ ) → because denominator is negative.

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + cosθ):

[ sinθ (1 + cosθ) ] / [ (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) ] → denominator is 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ.

So it becomes [ sinθ (1 + cosθ) ] / sin²θ = (1 + cosθ)/sinθ.

Similarly, the right side is (cosθ +1)/sinθ.

So, both sides are equal. So the two equations are consistent, and we have a relation between a and b.

So, from equation 1: a = [ (1 + cosθ) / sinθ ] * b.

Wait, because [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] → same as [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] → multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + cosθ):

sinθ (1 + cosθ) / (1 - cos^2θ) = sinθ (1 + cosθ) / sin²θ = (1 + cosθ)/sinθ.

So yes, a = [ (1 + cosθ) / sinθ ] * b.

Let me write a = [ (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ ] b.

So, let's let b = sinθ. Then a = (1 + cosθ).

Wait, or perhaps it's better to set b=1 for simplicity, then a= (1 + cosθ)/sinθ.

But to make it more manageable, perhaps express the eigenvector in terms of θ.

So, the eigenvector can be written as:

a = (1 + cosθ) / sinθ * b.

Let me choose b = sinθ, so a = (1 + cosθ).

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, if a = (1 + cosθ) and b = sinθ, then the vector is (1 + cosθ, sinθ).

Wait, but wait, when I set b= sinθ, that's correct.

But wait, let's see: when θ is 0, direction is along z.

Wait, if n is along z (θ=0), then the operator P_n is P_z. The eigenvalue +ħ/2 corresponds to spin-up in z direction, which is (1, 0)^T.

So, let's plug θ=0 into the expressions.

At θ=0: cosθ=1, sinθ=0.

So, a = (1 +1)/0 * b → undefined. Hmm, that suggests that for θ=0, the approach breaks down because sinθ is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps taking b=1 and a= (1 + cosθ)/sinθ.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the standard spin-1/2 eigenstates.

The operator P_n is a spin-1/2 operator in the direction n. The eigenstates are |+n> and |−n>, which are given by:

|+n> = e^{-i φ/2} ( cos (θ/2), sin (θ/2) )^T
|−n> = e^{i φ/2} ( -sin (θ/2), cos (θ/2) )^T

Wait, wait, but in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so φ=0. Because the direction is in x-z, which is φ=0. So in spherical coordinates, φ is the azimuthal angle, which is 0 in this case.

So, for φ=0, the state |+n> would be ( cosθ/2, sinθ/2 )^T, multiplied by e^{i 0/2}=1.

So the normalized eigenvector would be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The general formula is:

|+n> = ( e^{-iφ/2} cos(θ/2), e^{iφ/2} sin(θ/2) )^T.

But in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, φ=0, so it's ( cosθ/2, sinθ/2 )^T.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the standard spin matrices.

The spin operator along n is given by S_n = n_x S_x + n_y S_y + n_z S_z.

In our case, n_y =0, so S_n = n_x S_x + n_z S_z.

The eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvector for +ħ/2 is |+n> = [ (n_z +1)/2, n_x ]^{1/2} }^T or something like that.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the eigenvector without going through the equations.

So, let's write the matrix P_n:

P_n = (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
              [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

The matrix equation is (P_n - (ħ/2) I ) |v> = 0.

So, (P_n - (ħ/2) I ) is:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ -1, sinθ ],
         [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

So, the matrix is:

[ (cosθ -1) * ħ/2, sinθ * ħ/2 ]
[ sinθ * ħ/2, (-cosθ -1) * ħ/2 ]

But when solving (M - λ I) v=0, the λ is ħ/2, so the matrix becomes:

[ (cosθ -1) * ħ/2, sinθ * ħ/2 ]
[ sinθ * ħ/2, (-cosθ -1) * ħ/2 ]

But when we factor out ħ/2, we get:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ -1, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ].

So, for the system [a'; b'] to be an eigenvector, the equations are:

(cosθ -1) a' + sinθ b' =0

sinθ a' + (-cosθ -1) b' =0

Let me write these as:

(cosθ -1) a' + sinθ b' =0 → equation 1

sinθ a' + ( - cosθ -1 ) b' =0 → equation 2

Let me solve equation 1 for a':

a' = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b'

Which simplifies to:

a' = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b'

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + cosθ):

a' = [ sinθ (1 + cosθ) / ( (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) ) ) ] b'

Denominator is 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ.

So,

a' = [ sinθ (1 + cosθ) ) / sin²θ ] b' → [ (1 + cosθ ) / sinθ ] b'

So, a' = [ (1 + cosθ ) / sinθ ] b'

So, the eigenvector can be written as:

v = [ (1 + cosθ ) / sinθ , 1 ] multiplied by a normalization factor.

Wait, no, because a' is proportional to b'. Let me set b' = sinθ, then a' becomes 1 + cosθ.

Wait, but wait, when θ is 0, sinθ is 0, which would cause a problem. So perhaps it's better to express the eigenvector in terms of θ/2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of spherical coordinates.

Wait, another approach: the eigenvector for spin up along direction n (θ,0) in the x-z plane is given by:

|+n> = cos(θ/2) |+z> + sin(θ/2) |+x>

Wait, no, not exactly. The standard expression is:

|+n> = e^{-i φ/2} [ cos(θ/2), e^{i φ} sin(θ/2) ]^T.

But since φ=0 (as n is in x-z plane), it's [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

Wait, but that's in the spin-up state along n. So the eigenvector should be proportional to [ cosθ/2, sinθ/2 ]^T.

Wait, but wait, earlier when I tried plugging θ=0, I saw that the standard state is (1,0), which fits this because cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0.

Similarly, for θ=180 degrees (π radians), cos(θ/2)=0, sin(theta/2)=1, so the state is (0,1), which would be spin up along negative z.

So, the general form is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but then when I compute the eigenvector from the equations, I got [ (1 + cosθ)/sinθ , 1 ].

Hmm, perhaps these are related?

Let me see: Let me set a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2).

So, the eigenvector is [a; b] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Is this the same as the solution from the equations?

Wait, let me compute (1 + cosθ) / sinθ.

Using the identity:

1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2)
sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So,

(1 + cosθ) / sinθ = [2 cos²(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ] = cot(theta/2 )

So from the equations, a' = (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ * b' → a' = cot(theta/2) * b'.

Which implies that a' / b' = cot(theta/2) → a' = cot(theta/2) * b'.

So if I set b' = sin(theta/2), then a' = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2 ) = cos(theta/2).

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is the same as we thought from the standard spin states.

So, the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), since the state is already normalized.

Wait, but let's check the normalization:

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) = 1. So yes, it's normalized.

So the components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches this.

But wait, the options have some other options too. Let me check all options again.

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ ) → seems unrelated.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)). But since the direction is in x-z, phi is zero, so e^{i phi} is 1. But earlier results don't match this.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D: [ sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, option C is correct.

But wait, the question says it's along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So phi is zero, and the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So among the options, option C is correct.

Wait, but earlier I got the ratio a = (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ * b.

Which, when expressed as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), fits.

So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but then looking at the options again.

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches. So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the direction vector can be expressed as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, and the operator along $\vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
P_n = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z.
\]

Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, we compute:

\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, the operator $P_n$ becomes:

\[
P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we solve the eigenvalue equation:

\[
(P_n - \frac{\hbar}{2} I) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0,
\]

where $I$ is the identity matrix. Subtracting $\frac{\hbar}{2} I$ from $P_n$, we get:

\[
P_n - \frac{\hbar}{2} I = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \quad \sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0.
\]

From the first equation, we solve for $a$ in terms of $b$:

\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b.
\]

Using the trigonometric identities $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$ and $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$, we simplify:

\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b = \frac{\cos(\theta/2)}{\sin(\theta/2)} b = \cot(\theta/2) b.
\]

Choosing $b = \sin(\theta/2)$ for simplicity, we find:

\[
a = \cos(\theta/2).
\]

Thus, the eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**Option C: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.**

The other options do not match the derived eigenvector. For example:

- **Option A** involves $\hbar$, which is not part of the eigenvector components.
- **Option B** introduces a phase factor $e^{i\phi}$, but $\phi = 0$ since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane.
- **Option D** introduces additional normalization factors ($\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$), which are not present in the derived eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the eigenvector of a quantum mechanical operator P along an arbitrary direction n in the x-z plane. The eigenvalue is +ħ/2. They give me the components P_x, P_y, and P_z as 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

Wait, quantum operators... I remember that when dealing with angular momentum or spin, the operator components are defined in terms of their matrices. Since the problem is about a muon, which is a spin-1/2 particle, the spin operator components are represented by these 2x2 matrices multiplied by ħ/2.

The direction n is arbitrary but lies in the x-z plane. So the direction vector can be expressed as (sinθ, 0, cosθ), right? Because in x-z, the y-component is zero. Or wait, maybe it's (cosθ, 0, sinθ)? Wait, no, the standard spherical coordinates have θ from the z-axis, so x is cosθ and z is sinθ. Wait, no, actually, in spherical coordinates, the polar angle θ is from the z-axis. So the position vector is (r sinθ cosφ, r sinθ sinφ, r cosθ). But here, the direction is in the x-z plane, which means φ is zero. So the direction vector would be (sinθ, 0, cosθ), because φ is zero, so the y-component is zero. Wait no, wait: if θ is measured from the z-axis, then the x-component is r sinθ cosφ. But since φ is zero in the x-z plane, cosφ is 1, so the x component is r sinθ. So the direction vector is (sinθ, 0, cosθ), but since it's a unit vector, r=1, so it's (sinθ, 0, cosθ). So the operator P is P = n · (P_x, P_y, P_z) = sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z.

Wait, but the operator's direction is along n. So the operator for the component along n would be P_n = n · P, which is sinθ P_x + cosθ P_z.

So the operator we need to find the eigenvector for is P_n, which has eigenvalue +ħ/2. So we need to find a normalized eigenvector of P_n corresponding to this eigenvalue.

Wait, but the operator P_n is given by combining P_x, P_y, and P_z. Since n is in the x-z plane, P_y component will be zero, so P_n = P_x sinθ + P_z cosθ.

Wait, but the given P_x, P_y, P_z are each multiplied by ħ/2. Let me write that down:

P_x = (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
P_y = (ħ/2) * [[0, -i], [i, 0]]
P_z = (ħ/2) * [[1, 0], [0, -1]]

So, P_n = sinθ * P_x + cosθ * P_z. Let's compute that.

Wait, no, because P_x is already (ħ/2) times the matrix. So when you write P_n, you have to factor that in.

So, P_n = sinθ * (ħ/2) * [[0, 1], [1,0]] + cosθ * (ħ/2) * [[1,0],[0,-1]]

This can be written as (ħ/2) [ sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] + cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] ]

Let me compute the matrix inside.

The identity matrix is [[1,0],[0,1]], but in this case, I have the matrices:

First term: sinθ * [[0,1],[1,0]] → [[0, sinθ], [sinθ, 0]]
Second term: cosθ * [[1,0],[0,-1]] → [[cosθ, 0], [0, -cosθ]]

Adding these together:

Top left: cosθ
Top right: sinθ
Bottom left: sinθ
Bottom right: -cosθ

So the matrix is:

[ [cosθ, sinθ],
  [sinθ, -cosθ] ]

So overall, P_n = (ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ].

Now, we need to find the eigenvectors of this matrix. The eigenvalue is given as +ħ/2.

So, the equation is P_n |ψ> = (ħ/2) |ψ>.

Let me write the matrix equation:

(ħ/2) * [ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = (ħ/2) [a; b]

We can multiply both sides by 2/ħ to simplify:

[ [cosθ, sinθ], [sinθ, -cosθ] ] * [a; b] = [a; b]

So, the matrix equation becomes:

cosθ * a + sinθ * b = a
sinθ * a - cosθ * b = b

So, two equations:

1) (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b = 0
2) sinθ a + (-cosθ - 1) b = 0

Wait, wait, let's re-arrange the equations.

From equation 1: cosθ a + sinθ b = a → (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b =0.

From equation 2: sinθ a - cosθ b = b → sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b =0.

Hmm, so we have a system of two equations:

Equation 1: (cosθ - 1) a + sinθ b =0

Equation 2: sinθ a + (- cosθ - 1) b =0

We can write this as a matrix:

[ (cosθ -1), sinθ        ] [a]   = 0
[ sinθ       , (-cosθ -1) ] [b]

For non-trivial solution (a and b not both zero), the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero.

Wait, but since we're looking for eigenvectors, these equations must be dependent. So the determinant should be zero, but perhaps we can find a relation between a and b.

Let me see equation 1: (cosθ -1) a + sinθ b =0 → equation1: a = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b

Similarly, from equation 2: sinθ a + (-cosθ -1) b =0 → equation2: a = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ] b

So, from equation 1 and 2, the expressions for a in terms of b must be equal.

So, [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] = [ (cosθ +1) / sinθ ]

Let me compute the left side:

- sinθ / (cosθ -1) = [ sinθ ] / (1 - cosθ ) → because denominator is negative.

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + cosθ):

[ sinθ (1 + cosθ) ] / [ (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) ] → denominator is 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ.

So it becomes [ sinθ (1 + cosθ) ] / sin²θ = (1 + cosθ)/sinθ.

Similarly, the right side is (cosθ +1)/sinθ.

So, both sides are equal. So the two equations are consistent, and we have a relation between a and b.

So, from equation 1: a = [ (1 + cosθ) / sinθ ] * b.

Wait, because [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] → same as [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] → multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + cosθ):

sinθ (1 + cosθ) / (1 - cos^2θ) = sinθ (1 + cosθ) / sin²θ = (1 + cosθ)/sinθ.

So yes, a = [ (1 + cosθ) / sinθ ] * b.

Let me write a = [ (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ ] b.

So, let's let b = sinθ. Then a = (1 + cosθ).

Wait, or perhaps it's better to set b=1 for simplicity, then a= (1 + cosθ)/sinθ.

But to make it more manageable, perhaps express the eigenvector in terms of θ.

So, the eigenvector can be written as:

a = (1 + cosθ) / sinθ * b.

Let me choose b = sinθ, so a = (1 + cosθ).

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, if a = (1 + cosθ) and b = sinθ, then the vector is (1 + cosθ, sinθ).

Wait, but wait, when I set b= sinθ, that's correct.

But wait, let's see: when θ is 0, direction is along z.

Wait, if n is along z (θ=0), then the operator P_n is P_z. The eigenvalue +ħ/2 corresponds to spin-up in z direction, which is (1, 0)^T.

So, let's plug θ=0 into the expressions.

At θ=0: cosθ=1, sinθ=0.

So, a = (1 +1)/0 * b → undefined. Hmm, that suggests that for θ=0, the approach breaks down because sinθ is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps taking b=1 and a= (1 + cosθ)/sinθ.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the standard spin-1/2 eigenstates.

The operator P_n is a spin-1/2 operator in the direction n. The eigenstates are |+n> and |−n>, which are given by:

|+n> = e^{-i φ/2} ( cos (θ/2), sin (θ/2) )^T
|−n> = e^{i φ/2} ( -sin (θ/2), cos (θ/2) )^T

Wait, wait, but in our case, the direction is in the x-z plane, so φ=0. Because the direction is in x-z, which is φ=0. So in spherical coordinates, φ is the azimuthal angle, which is 0 in this case.

So, for φ=0, the state |+n> would be ( cosθ/2, sinθ/2 )^T, multiplied by e^{i 0/2}=1.

So the normalized eigenvector would be [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ].

Wait, but wait, let me think again. The general formula is:

|+n> = ( e^{-iφ/2} cos(θ/2), e^{iφ/2} sin(θ/2) )^T.

But in our case, since n is in the x-z plane, φ=0, so it's ( cosθ/2, sinθ/2 )^T.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the standard spin matrices.

The spin operator along n is given by S_n = n_x S_x + n_y S_y + n_z S_z.

In our case, n_y =0, so S_n = n_x S_x + n_z S_z.

The eigenvalues are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvector for +ħ/2 is |+n> = [ (n_z +1)/2, n_x ]^{1/2} }^T or something like that.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the eigenvector without going through the equations.

So, let's write the matrix P_n:

P_n = (ħ/2) [ [ cosθ, sinθ ],
              [ sinθ, -cosθ ] ]

So, the eigenvalue is +ħ/2.

The matrix equation is (P_n - (ħ/2) I ) |v> = 0.

So, (P_n - (ħ/2) I ) is:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ -1, sinθ ],
         [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ]

So, the matrix is:

[ (cosθ -1) * ħ/2, sinθ * ħ/2 ]
[ sinθ * ħ/2, (-cosθ -1) * ħ/2 ]

But when solving (M - λ I) v=0, the λ is ħ/2, so the matrix becomes:

[ (cosθ -1) * ħ/2, sinθ * ħ/2 ]
[ sinθ * ħ/2, (-cosθ -1) * ħ/2 ]

But when we factor out ħ/2, we get:

(ħ/2) [ [ cosθ -1, sinθ ], [ sinθ, -cosθ -1 ] ].

So, for the system [a'; b'] to be an eigenvector, the equations are:

(cosθ -1) a' + sinθ b' =0

sinθ a' + (-cosθ -1) b' =0

Let me write these as:

(cosθ -1) a' + sinθ b' =0 → equation 1

sinθ a' + ( - cosθ -1 ) b' =0 → equation 2

Let me solve equation 1 for a':

a' = [ - sinθ / (cosθ -1) ] b'

Which simplifies to:

a' = [ sinθ / (1 - cosθ) ] b'

Multiply numerator and denominator by (1 + cosθ):

a' = [ sinθ (1 + cosθ) / ( (1 - cosθ)(1 + cosθ) ) ) ] b'

Denominator is 1 - cos²θ = sin²θ.

So,

a' = [ sinθ (1 + cosθ) ) / sin²θ ] b' → [ (1 + cosθ ) / sinθ ] b'

So, a' = [ (1 + cosθ ) / sinθ ] b'

So, the eigenvector can be written as:

v = [ (1 + cosθ ) / sinθ , 1 ] multiplied by a normalization factor.

Wait, no, because a' is proportional to b'. Let me set b' = sinθ, then a' becomes 1 + cosθ.

Wait, but wait, when θ is 0, sinθ is 0, which would cause a problem. So perhaps it's better to express the eigenvector in terms of θ/2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of spherical coordinates.

Wait, another approach: the eigenvector for spin up along direction n (θ,0) in the x-z plane is given by:

|+n> = cos(θ/2) |+z> + sin(θ/2) |+x>

Wait, no, not exactly. The standard expression is:

|+n> = e^{-i φ/2} [ cos(θ/2), e^{i φ} sin(θ/2) ]^T.

But since φ=0 (as n is in x-z plane), it's [ cos(θ/2), sin(θ/2) ]^T.

Wait, but that's in the spin-up state along n. So the eigenvector should be proportional to [ cosθ/2, sinθ/2 ]^T.

Wait, but wait, earlier when I tried plugging θ=0, I saw that the standard state is (1,0), which fits this because cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0.

Similarly, for θ=180 degrees (π radians), cos(θ/2)=0, sin(theta/2)=1, so the state is (0,1), which would be spin up along negative z.

So, the general form is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T.

Wait, but then when I compute the eigenvector from the equations, I got [ (1 + cosθ)/sinθ , 1 ].

Hmm, perhaps these are related?

Let me see: Let me set a = cos(theta/2), b = sin(theta/2).

So, the eigenvector is [a; b] = [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ].

Is this the same as the solution from the equations?

Wait, let me compute (1 + cosθ) / sinθ.

Using the identity:

1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(theta/2)
sinθ = 2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2)

So,

(1 + cosθ) / sinθ = [2 cos²(theta/2)] / [2 sin(theta/2) cos(theta/2) ) ] = [ cos(theta/2) ] / [ sin(theta/2) ] = cot(theta/2 )

So from the equations, a' = (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ * b' → a' = cot(theta/2) * b'.

Which implies that a' / b' = cot(theta/2) → a' = cot(theta/2) * b'.

So if I set b' = sin(theta/2), then a' = cot(theta/2) * sin(theta/2 ) = cos(theta/2).

So the eigenvector is [ cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2) ]^T, which is the same as we thought from the standard spin states.

So, the normalized eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), since the state is already normalized.

Wait, but let's check the normalization:

|a|^2 + |b|^2 = cos²(theta/2) + sin²(theta/2) = 1. So yes, it's normalized.

So the components are (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches this.

But wait, the options have some other options too. Let me check all options again.

Option A: (sqrt(2/3) ħ, sqrt(1/3) ħ ) → seems unrelated.

Option B: (cos(theta), e^{i phi} sin(theta)). But since the direction is in x-z, phi is zero, so e^{i phi} is 1. But earlier results don't match this.

Option C: (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

Option D: [ sqrt(2/3) ħ cos(theta/2), sqrt(1/3) ħ sin(theta/2) ]

Wait, option C is correct.

But wait, the question says it's along an arbitrary direction in the x-z plane. So phi is zero, and the eigenvector is (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)).

So among the options, option C is correct.

Wait, but earlier I got the ratio a = (1 + cosθ)/ sinθ * b.

Which, when expressed as (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), fits.

So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but then looking at the options again.

Option C says (cos(theta/2), sin(theta/2)), which matches. So the correct answer is option C.


To solve the problem, we are tasked with finding the normalized eigenvector of the quantum mechanical operator $\vec{P}$ along an arbitrary direction $\vec{n}$ in the x-z plane, corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$. The operator $\vec{P}$ is defined in terms of its components $P_x$, $P_y$, and $P_z$, which are given as 2x2 matrices multiplied by $\hbar/2$. Since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane, the direction vector can be expressed as $(\sin\theta, 0, \cos\theta)$, and the operator along $\vec{n}$ is given by:

\[
P_n = \sin\theta P_x + \cos\theta P_z.
\]

Substituting the given matrices for $P_x$ and $P_z$, we compute:

\[
P_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \quad P_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Thus, the operator $P_n$ becomes:

\[
P_n = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta \end{bmatrix}.
\]

To find the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $+\hbar/2$, we solve the eigenvalue equation:

\[
(P_n - \frac{\hbar}{2} I) \begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = 0,
\]

where $I$ is the identity matrix. Subtracting $\frac{\hbar}{2} I$ from $P_n$, we get:

\[
P_n - \frac{\hbar}{2} I = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{bmatrix} \cos\theta - 1 & \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & -\cos\theta - 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This leads to the system of equations:

\[
(\cos\theta - 1)a + \sin\theta b = 0, \quad \sin\theta a + (-\cos\theta - 1)b = 0.
\]

From the first equation, we solve for $a$ in terms of $b$:

\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b.
\]

Using the trigonometric identities $\sin\theta = 2\sin(\theta/2)\cos(\theta/2)$ and $1 - \cos\theta = 2\sin^2(\theta/2)$, we simplify:

\[
a = \frac{\sin\theta}{1 - \cos\theta} b = \frac{\cos(\theta/2)}{\sin(\theta/2)} b = \cot(\theta/2) b.
\]

Choosing $b = \sin(\theta/2)$ for simplicity, we find:

\[
a = \cos(\theta/2).
\]

Thus, the eigenvector is:

\[
\begin{bmatrix} a \\ b \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta/2) \\ \sin(\theta/2) \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This eigenvector is already normalized, as $\cos^2(\theta/2) + \sin^2(\theta/2) = 1$. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**Option C: $(\cos(\theta/2), \sin(\theta/2))$.**

The other options do not match the derived eigenvector. For example:

- **Option A** involves $\hbar$, which is not part of the eigenvector components.
- **Option B** introduces a phase factor $e^{i\phi}$, but $\phi = 0$ since $\vec{n}$ lies in the x-z plane.
- **Option D** introduces additional normalization factors ($\sqrt{2/3}$ and $\sqrt{1/3}$), which are not present in the derived eigenvector.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: C**
