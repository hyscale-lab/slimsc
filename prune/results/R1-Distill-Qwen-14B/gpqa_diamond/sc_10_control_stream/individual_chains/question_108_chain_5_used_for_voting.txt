Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the question says that the magnetic field B is parallel to Oz and has a value of 1 Tesla. They also mention small values of m, the orbital magnetic quantum number. And we're comparing the paramagnetic coupling term (which I think is the Hamiltonian due to the magnetic field) with the transition energy ΔE of hydrogen, which has a wavelength λ = 0.4861 micrometers.

Wait, the transition energy ΔE is given by the wavelength. I remember that the energy of a photon is related to wavelength by E = hc/λ. So I can calculate ΔE using that. Let me note down the numbers: h is Planck's constant, about 6.626e-34 J·s. c is speed of light, approx 3e8 m/s. And λ is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 0.4861e-6 meters.

Calculating ΔE: (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (0.4861e-6) = let's compute that. Numerator is 1.9878e-25, denominator 4.861e-7. So 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approximately 4.086e-19 J. Hmm, but wait, I think hydrogen's energy levels are usually given in electron volts. Oh right, 1 eV is about 1.602e-19 J. So 4.086e-19 J is roughly 2.55 eV. Wait, that seems a bit high. Oh wait, no, wait. The hydrogen transition for the Balmer series is about 100 nm to 400 nm, but this wavelength is 0.4861 micrometers, which is 486.1 nm. Oh right, that's the Balmer-alpha line, the H-alpha line. So the energy difference should correspond to that. Let me see, the energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for n=2, E is -13.6/4 = -3.4 eV. For n=3, E is -13.6/9 ≈ -1.51 eV. So the transition from n=3 to n=2 would be ΔE = E_2 - E_3 = (-3.4 + 1.51) eV = (-1.89) eV. Wait, no, wait. The energy of the photon is the difference between the higher and lower energy levels when an electron transitions. So if the electron drops from a higher level to a lower one, the photon emitted has energy E_high - E_low. Wait, but E levels are negative, so higher means less negative. So ΔE would be E_final - E_initial. Suppose the electron transitions from n=3 to n=2, the energy emitted would be E_2 - E_3. Wait, E_3 is less negative than E_2. So E_2 is -3.4 eV, E_3 is -1.51 eV. So E_2 - E_3 = (-3.4) - (-1.51) = -1.89 eV. But the photon energy is the absolute value, so 1.89 eV. Alternatively, maybe I should compute it as E_initial (n=3) is -1.51 eV, E_final (n=2) is -3.4 eV. So the energy difference is E_final - E_initial = (-3.4) - (-1.51) )= -1.89 eV. But the photon's energy is the magnitude, so 1.89 eV. So 1.89 eV is about 3e-19 J (since 1 eV is 1.6e-19 J). Wait, earlier I calculated about 4e-19 J, which is about 2.5 eV. Hmm, that's a bit off. Maybe I should do a precise calculation.

Let me compute hc/λ precisely. Let's see:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value)
c = 299792458 m/s (exact)
λ = 0.4861e-6 m

So hc = 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 ≈ 1.98645e-25 J·m

Then E= hc/lambda = 1.98645e-25 / (0.4861e-6) ≈ 4.086e-19 J.

To convert to eV: 4.086e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. Hmm, but earlier I thought the hydrogen transition was around 1.89 eV. Oh wait, perhaps I got the transition wrong. Let me check: the wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nm, which is the H-alpha line, corresponding to a transition from n=3 to n=2 in Balmer series. Oh wait, actually, wait. The Balmer series is from n >=3 to n=2. The H-alpha line is n=3 to n=2, as I thought. So the energy difference should be E = 13.6 (1/(2^2) - 1/(3^2)) ) eV. Let's compute that. 1/4 is 0.25, 1/9 ≈ 0.1111. So 0.25 - 0.1111 = 0.1389. 13.6 * 0.1389 ≈ 1.896 eV. So about 1.9 eV.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the photon energy is about 2.55 eV. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I mix up the wavelength with something else? Because 486 nm is in visible light, which has lower energy than UV. So maybe the calculation is correct, but I'm missing something in the hydrogen transition.

Wait another thought: the energy levels are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So E_2 = -3.4 eV, E_3 = -1.51 eV. The difference E_3 - E_2 is 1.89 eV. So the photon emitted has energy 1.89 eV. But according to the calculation, the energy is 2.55 eV. So that's a problem. Oh wait, maybe I messed up the value of λ. Because 486 nm is 486e-9 m, which is 0.486e-6 m. So 0.4861e-6 m is correct. Hmm, perhaps I should recalculate.

Wait, let me do the calculation again. hc is 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divided by 486.1e-9 m, which is 0.4861e-6 m. Let me compute 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-18 = approximately 0.4086e-18 J. Which is 4.086e-19 J. To eV: 4.086e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. But the energy difference for the transition is only ~1.89 eV. So why the discrepancy?

Wait a minute, maybe the question isn't referring to the energy difference between the states but something else. Or perhaps I'm miscalculating. Or maybe the question uses a different wavelength? Oh wait, maybe I misread the question. The wavelength is for the transition, so ΔE is hc/λ. So the ΔE is about 2.55 eV. Wait, but the hydrogen line is at 486 nm, so that must match. So perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Maybe the energy levels are calculated differently. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the calculation of E_n? Let me double-check.

E_n = -13.6 eV / n². For n=2, E_2= -3.4 eV. For n=3, E_3 = -1.51 eV. The energy difference is E_3 - E_2 = 1.89 eV. So the photon emitted has energy 1.89 eV. But according to hc/lambda, I get about 2.55 eV. That suggests something's wrong. Oh wait, perhaps I confused the Rydberg constant. Wait, the Rydberg constant R is about 1.097e4 m^-1. The wavelength for Balmer-alpha is given by 1/lambda = R (1/2² - 1/3²) ) = R*(0.25 - 0.1111) = R*0.1389 ≈ 1.097e4 * 0.1389 ≈ 1.53e3 m^-1. So lambda ≈ 1/(1.53e3) ≈ 0.000653 m, which is 653 nm. But wait, the actual H-alpha line is about 656 nm. So 486 nm is the H-beta line. Wait, H-alpha is the transition from n=3 to n=2? No, wait. Let me think: the Balmer series is when the electron transitions to n=2. So H-alpha is the transition from n=4 to n=2. H-beta is from n=5 to n=2? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the Balmer series lines are given by 1/lambda = R (1/2² - 1/n²), where n>2. So for n=3: 1/lambda = R (0.25 - 0.111) = R * 0.1389 ≈ 1.53e3. So lambda ≈ 653 nm. That's the H-alpha line. The H-beta line is n=4 to n=2: 1/lambda = R(0.25 - 0.0625) = R*0.1875 ≈ 2.03e3. So lambda ≈ 492 nm. Oh, so 486 nm isn't exactly matching H-beta. Hmm. Maybe the given wavelength is an approximation, and it's near 492 nm, which would correspond to an energy of about 2.44 eV. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 492 nm is 492e-9 m. So hc/lambda is (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (492e-9) = (1.9878e-25)/(4.92e-7) ≈ 4.04e-19 J. Convert to eV: 4.04e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.52 eV. Hmm, but according to the energy levels, the transition from n=4 to n=2 would have energy difference E_2 - E_4 = (-3.4) - (-0.85) )= -2.55 eV. So the photon has 2.55 eV. Oh, that matches! So earlier, I think I made a mistake in the transition. The given wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers (486.1 nm) is very close to 492 nm, so perhaps the question is considering n=4 to n=2 transition, so ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

But wait, the exact calculation: lambda = 486.1e-9 m. So E= (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9) = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approx 4.085e-19 J. Which is 4.085e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. So yes, matches.

So ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Now, the other part: the paramagnetic coupling term. I think that refers to the energy due to the magnetic field. For an electron in a magnetic field, the energy is given by the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment for an electron is μ = -g * μ_B * m, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio (approximately 2 for electrons), and μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, no, the formula for the magnetic moment is μ = -g * (eħ/(2m_e)) * m. The Bohr magneton μ_B is eħ/(2m_e) ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T. For an electron, g is approximately 2. So the energy due to the magnetic field is H = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, we can write μ as μ_z = g μ_B m. So H = -g μ_B m B.

Wait, but wait: the energy term would be proportional to m, the magnetic quantum number. For small m, the term would be small. But the question is about the magnitude of the paramagnetic term compared to the transition energy.

Wait, but paramagnetic coupling might refer to the splitting of energy levels due to the magnetic field. But in this case, the magnetic field is applied, and the energy shift is given by the Zeeman effect. So the energy shift is ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m * g. But wait, the value of m can be from -l to +l, but the question says m is small. So m is small, so the energy shift is proportional to m.

Wait, but what's the orbital magnetic quantum number m? Wait no, wait: orbital magnetic quantum number is l, or m_l? No, wait, m is the magnetic quantum number, which can take values from -l to +l. But if m is small, like m=0, then the Zeeman term is zero. Hmm. But maybe in this context, it's the spin magnetic quantum number. Wait, no, because paramagnetic coupling usually refers to the spin-orbit coupling, but here we're talking about the effect of an external magnetic field on the electron's spin or orbital motion.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. The paramagnetic coupling term is the interaction energy of the magnetic moment with the external field. The magnetic moment for an electron can be due to its spin or its orbital motion. But given that the field is applied, the energy is μ·B. So if it's spin, the term is proportional to spin magnetic quantum number m_s, which is ±1/2. If it's orbital, m can be up to l, which for hydrogen's ground state is 0, but higher states have l=1, etc. But the question says small m, so perhaps m is of order 1 or less.

Wait, but the paramagnetic term is the energy shift due to the magnetic field. Let's compute this.

For the orbital contribution, the magnetic moment is μ_orbital = (eħ)/(2m_e) * m_l * ħ / (2m_e c) ? Wait, no, perhaps I should recall that the orbital magnetic dipole moment is given by μ_l = (μ_B) * m_l, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, the Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e) ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T.

So the energy shift due to the orbital magnetic moment in a magnetic field B is H_orbital = -μ_l · B = -μ_B m_l B.

Similarly, the spin magnetic moment is μ_s = g_s μ_B (m_s), where g_s is the spin g-factor (~2 for electrons). So H_spin = -μ_s · B = -g_s μ_B m_s B.

Wait, but which one are we considering here? The question says "paramagnetic coupling term". Paramagnetism arises from unpaired electrons, and it's usually the spin contribution that's considered. So perhaps we're considering the spin term here.

So H = -g μ_B m_s B.

But wait, m_s can be ±1/2. So the energy shift would be H ≈ ± g μ_B (1/2) B.

Wait, but let's plug in the numbers. g is about 2. So H ≈ 2 * 9.274e-24 J/T * 0.5 * 1 T.

Compute that: 2 * 9.274e-24 * 0.5 * 1 = 9.274e-24 J.

Convert that to eV: 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is about 5.79e-5 eV.

Wait, but ΔE was 2.55 eV. So the paramagnetic term is way smaller. So the ratio would be H << ΔE.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because if B is 1 T, what is the actual energy shift? Let me recheck the calculation.

μ_B is 9.274e-24 J/T. So μ_B * B = 9.274e-24 J. Then, multiplied by m_s (which is ±1/2). So H = μ_B * m_s * B * g. Wait, no, the correct formula is H = -g μ_B m_s B. Wait, because the energy is H = -μ·B, and μ = g μ_B m_s.

So μ = g μ_B m_s. So H = - g μ_B m_s B.

Wait, but if B is along Oz, and the direction is positive, then m_s = +1/2 would give H = -g μ_B (1/2) B. But the magnitude is g μ_B (1/2) B. Let's compute this magnitude.

g is approximately 2. So, magnitude is 2 * 9.274e-24 J/T * 0.5 T. So 2 * 9.274e-24 * 0.5 = 9.274e-24 J. So that's 5.79e-5 eV as before.

So the paramagnetic term is about 5.8e-5 eV. The transition energy is about 2.55 eV. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

But wait, what if the paramagnetic term is the orbital contribution instead? Let's see. For orbital m_l, in hydrogen, for n=2, l can be 0 or 1. So m_l can be 0, ±1. If m is small, say m=0, then the energy shift is zero. If m=±1, then H_orbital = μ_B * m_l * B = (9.274e-24 J/T) * 1 * 1 T = 9.274e-24 J = 5.79e-5 eV. Same as spin.

So regardless of spin or orbital, the energy shift due to B=1 T is about 5.8e-5 eV, which is way smaller than the transition energy ΔE of 2.55 eV.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy. So the question is to compare ⟨H⟩ (the expectation value of the paramagnetic Hamiltonian) with ΔE.

So ⟨H⟩ is about 5.8e-5 eV, and ΔE is about 2.55 eV. So ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE.

So the correct option is C) ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the two quantities as follows:

### Transition Energy (\( \Delta E \)):
The transition energy is calculated using the wavelength of the emitted photon, given by the relation:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Here:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \).

Substituting these values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 4.086 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{4.086 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the transition energy is approximately \( \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV} \).

---

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term (\( \langle H \rangle \)):
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the magnetic moment of the electron with the external magnetic field \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \). For an electron, the magnetic moment is given by:

\[
\mu = g \mu_B m,
\]

where:
- \( g \) is the gyromagnetic ratio (approximately \( g \approx 2 \) for electrons),
- \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton,
- \( m \) is the magnetic quantum number.

The energy shift due to the magnetic field is:

\[
\langle H \rangle = -\mu \cdot B = -g \mu_B m B.
\]

For small \( m \) (e.g., \( m = \pm 1/2 \) for spin or \( m = 0, \pm 1 \) for orbital), the magnitude of the energy shift is:

\[
|\langle H \rangle| = g \mu_B |m| B.
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( g \approx 2 \),
- \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \),
- \( |m| = 1/2 \) (for spin) or \( |m| = 1 \) (for orbital),
- \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \),

we calculate:

\[
|\langle H \rangle| = 2 \cdot (9.274 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
|\langle H \rangle| \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately \( |\langle H \rangle| \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \).

---

### Comparison:
The transition energy is \( \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV} \), while the paramagnetic coupling term is \( |\langle H \rangle| \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \). Clearly:

\[
|\langle H \rangle| \ll \Delta E.
\]

Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about comparing the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of a hydrogen atom. Hmm, let me try to think this through step by step.

Oh right, that's the Balmer-alpha line, the H-alpha line. So the energy difference should correspond to that. Let me see, the energy levels of hydrogen are given by E_n = -13.6 eV / n². So for n=2, E is -13.6/4 = -3.4 eV. For n=3, E is -13.6/9 ≈ -1.51 eV. So the transition from n=3 to n=2 would be ΔE = E_2 - E_3 = (-3.4 + 1.51) eV = (-1.89) eV. Wait, no, wait. The energy of the photon is the difference between the higher and lower energy levels when an electron transitions.

Then E= hc/lambda = 1.98645e-25 / (0.4861e-6) ≈ 4.086e-19 J.

To convert to eV: 4.086e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 2.55 eV. Hmm, but earlier I thought the hydrogen transition was around 1.89 eV. Oh wait, perhaps I got the transition wrong. Let me check: the wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers is 486.1 nm, which is the H-alpha line, corresponding to a transition from n=3 to n=2 in Balmer series. Oh wait, actually, wait.

Let's compute that. 1/4 is 0.25, 1/9 ≈ 0.1111. So 0.25 - 0.1111 = 0.1389. 13.6 * 0.1389 ≈ 1.896 eV. So about 1.9 eV.

Wait, but according to the calculation, the photon energy is about 2.55 eV. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Did I mix up the wavelength with something else?

Hmm, perhaps I should recalculate.

Let me compute 1.9878e-25 / 486.1e-9 = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = (1.9878 / 4.861) * 1e-18 = approximately 0.4086e-18 J. Which is 4.086e-19 J. To eV: 4.086e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. But the energy difference for the transition is only ~1.89 eV. So why the discrepancy?

E_n = -13.6 eV / n². For n=2, E_2= -3.4 eV. For n=3, E_3 = -1.51 eV. The energy difference is E_3 - E_2 = 1.89 eV. So the photon emitted has energy 1.89 eV. But according to hc/lambda, I get about 2.55 eV. That suggests something's wrong. Oh wait, perhaps I confused the Rydberg constant. Wait, the Rydberg constant R is about 1.097e4 m^-1. The wavelength for Balmer-alpha is given by 1/lambda = R (1/2² - 1/3²) ) = R*(0.25 - 0.1111) = R*0.1389 ≈ 1.097e4 * 0.1389 ≈ 1.53e3 m^-1. So lambda ≈ 1/(1.53e3) ≈ 0.000653 m, which is 653 nm. But wait, the actual H-alpha line is about 656 nm. So 486 nm is the H-beta line. Wait, H-alpha is the transition from n=3 to n=2? No, wait. Let me think: the Balmer series is when the electron transitions to n=2. So H-alpha is the transition from n=4 to n=2. H-beta is from n=5 to n=2? Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, the Balmer series lines are given by 1/lambda = R (1/2² - 1/n²), where n>2. So for n=3: 1/lambda = R (0.25 - 0.111) = R * 0.1389 ≈ 1.53e3. So lambda ≈ 653 nm. That's the H-alpha line. The H-beta line is n=4 to n=2: 1/lambda = R(0.25 - 0.0625) = R*0.1875 ≈ 2.03e3. So lambda ≈ 492 nm. Oh, so 486 nm isn't exactly matching H-beta. Hmm. Maybe the given wavelength is an approximation, and it's near 492 nm, which would correspond to an energy of about 2.44 eV. Let me calculate that.

Wait, 492 nm is 492e-9 m. So hc/lambda is (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (492e-9) = (1.9878e-25)/(4.92e-7) ≈ 4.04e-19 J. Convert to eV: 4.04e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.52 eV. Hmm, but according to the energy levels, the transition from n=4 to n=2 would have energy difference E_2 - E_4 = (-3.4) - (-0.85) )= -2.55 eV. So the photon has 2.55 eV. Oh, that matches! So earlier, I think I made a mistake in the transition. The given wavelength of 0.4861 micrometers (486.1 nm) is very close to 492 nm, so perhaps the question is considering n=4 to n=2 transition, so ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

But wait, the exact calculation: lambda = 486.1e-9 m. So E= (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (486.1e-9) = 1.9878e-25 / 4.861e-7 = approx 4.085e-19 J. Which is 4.085e-19 / 1.602e-19 ≈ 2.55 eV. So yes, matches.

So ΔE is about 2.55 eV.

Now, the other part: the paramagnetic coupling term. I think that refers to the energy due to the magnetic field. For an electron in a magnetic field, the energy is given by the Zeeman effect. The Hamiltonian is H = -μ·B, where μ is the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment for an electron is μ = -g * μ_B * m, where g is the gyromagnetic ratio (approximately 2 for electrons), and μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, no, the formula for the magnetic moment is μ = -g * (eħ/(2m_e)) * m. The Bohr magneton μ_B is eħ/(2m_e) ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T. For an electron, g is approximately 2. So the energy due to the magnetic field is H = -μ·B. Since B is along Oz, we can write μ as μ_z = g μ_B m. So H = -g μ_B m B.

Wait, but wait: the energy term would be proportional to m, the magnetic quantum number. For small m, the term would be small. But the question is about the magnitude of the paramagnetic term compared to the transition energy.

Wait, but paramagnetic coupling might refer to the splitting of energy levels due to the magnetic field. But in this case, the magnetic field is applied, and the energy shift is given by the Zeeman effect. So the energy shift is ΔE_Zeeman = μ_B * B * m * g. But wait, the value of m can be from -l to +l, but the question says m is small. So m is small, so the energy shift is proportional to m.

Wait, but what's the orbital magnetic quantum number m? Wait no, wait: orbital magnetic quantum number is l, or m_l? No, wait, m is the magnetic quantum number, which can take values from -l to +l. But if m is small, like m=0, then the Zeeman term is zero. Hmm. But maybe in this context, it's the spin magnetic quantum number. Wait, no, because paramagnetic coupling usually refers to the spin-orbit coupling, but here we're talking about the effect of an external magnetic field on the electron's spin or orbital motion.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. The paramagnetic coupling term is the interaction energy of the magnetic moment with the external field. The magnetic moment for an electron can be due to its spin or its orbital motion. But given that the field is applied, the energy is μ·B. So if it's spin, the term is proportional to spin magnetic quantum number m_s, which is ±1/2. If it's orbital, m can be up to l, which for hydrogen's ground state is 0, but higher states have l=1, etc. But the question says small m, so perhaps m is of order 1 or less.

Wait, but the paramagnetic term is the energy shift due to the magnetic field. Let's compute this.

For the orbital contribution, the magnetic moment is μ_orbital = (eħ)/(2m_e) * m_l * ħ / (2m_e c) ? Wait, no, perhaps I should recall that the orbital magnetic dipole moment is given by μ_l = (μ_B) * m_l, where μ_B is the Bohr magneton.

Wait, the Bohr magneton is μ_B = (eħ)/(2m_e) ≈ 9.274e-24 J/T.

So the energy shift due to the orbital magnetic moment in a magnetic field B is H_orbital = -μ_l · B = -μ_B m_l B.

Similarly, the spin magnetic moment is μ_s = g_s μ_B (m_s), where g_s is the spin g-factor (~2 for electrons). So H_spin = -μ_s · B = -g_s μ_B m_s B.

Wait, but which one are we considering here? The question says "paramagnetic coupling term". Paramagnetism arises from unpaired electrons, and it's usually the spin contribution that's considered. So perhaps we're considering the spin term here.

So H = -g μ_B m_s B.

But wait, m_s can be ±1/2. So the energy shift would be H ≈ ± g μ_B (1/2) B.

Wait, but let's plug in the numbers. g is about 2. So H ≈ 2 * 9.274e-24 J/T * 0.5 * 1 T.

Compute that: 2 * 9.274e-24 * 0.5 * 1 = 9.274e-24 J.

Convert that to eV: 9.274e-24 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV ≈ 5.79e-5 eV.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is about 5.79e-5 eV.

Wait, but ΔE was 2.55 eV. So the paramagnetic term is way smaller. So the ratio would be H << ΔE.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because if B is 1 T, what is the actual energy shift? Let me recheck the calculation.

μ_B is 9.274e-24 J/T. So μ_B * B = 9.274e-24 J. Then, multiplied by m_s (which is ±1/2). So H = μ_B * m_s * B * g. Wait, no, the correct formula is H = -g μ_B m_s B. Wait, because the energy is H = -μ·B, and μ = g μ_B m_s.

So μ = g μ_B m_s. So H = - g μ_B m_s B.

Wait, but if B is along Oz, and the direction is positive, then m_s = +1/2 would give H = -g μ_B (1/2) B. But the magnitude is g μ_B (1/2) B. Let's compute this magnitude.

g is approximately 2. So, magnitude is 2 * 9.274e-24 J/T * 0.5 T. So 2 * 9.274e-24 * 0.5 = 9.274e-24 J. So that's 5.79e-5 eV as before.

So the paramagnetic term is about 5.8e-5 eV. The transition energy is about 2.55 eV. So the paramagnetic term is much smaller than the transition energy.

But wait, what if the paramagnetic term is the orbital contribution instead? Let's see. For orbital m_l, in hydrogen, for n=2, l can be 0 or 1. So m_l can be 0, ±1. If m is small, say m=0, then the energy shift is zero. If m=±1, then H_orbital = μ_B * m_l * B = (9.274e-24 J/T) * 1 * 1 T = 9.274e-24 J = 5.79e-5 eV. Same as spin.

So regardless of spin or orbital, the energy shift due to B=1 T is about 5.8e-5 eV, which is way smaller than the transition energy ΔE of 2.55 eV.

So the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy. So the question is to compare ⟨H⟩ (the expectation value of the paramagnetic Hamiltonian) with ΔE.

So ⟨H⟩ is about 5.8e-5 eV, and ΔE is about 2.55 eV. So ⟨H⟩ is much less than ΔE.

So the correct option is C) ⟨H⟩ ≪ ΔE.


To compare the paramagnetic coupling term with the transition energy of the hydrogen atom, we analyze the two quantities as follows:

### Transition Energy (\( \Delta E \)):
The transition energy is calculated using the wavelength of the emitted photon, given by the relation:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Here:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 0.4861 \, \mu\text{m} = 0.4861 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \).

Substituting these values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3 \times 10^8)}{0.4861 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 4.086 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts (\( 1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\Delta E \approx \frac{4.086 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the transition energy is approximately \( \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV} \).

### Paramagnetic Coupling Term (\( \langle H \rangle \)):
The paramagnetic coupling term arises from the interaction of the magnetic moment of the electron with the external magnetic field \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \). For an electron, the magnetic moment is given by:

\[
\mu = g \mu_B m,
\]

where:
- \( g \) is the gyromagnetic ratio (approximately \( g \approx 2 \) for electrons),
- \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \) is the Bohr magneton,
- \( m \) is the magnetic quantum number.

The energy shift due to the magnetic field is:

\[
\langle H \rangle = -\mu \cdot B = -g \mu_B m B.
\]

For small \( m \) (e.g., \( m = \pm 1/2 \) for spin or \( m = 0, \pm 1 \) for orbital), the magnitude of the energy shift is:

\[
|\langle H \rangle| = g \mu_B |m| B.
\]

Substituting the values:
- \( g \approx 2 \),
- \( \mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T} \),
- \( |m| = 1/2 \) (for spin) or \( |m| = 1 \) (for orbital),
- \( B = 1 \, \text{T} \),

we calculate:

\[
|\langle H \rangle| = 2 \cdot (9.274 \times 10^{-24}) \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \approx 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J}.
\]

Converting to electron volts:

\[
|\langle H \rangle| \approx \frac{9.274 \times 10^{-24}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 5.79 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is approximately \( |\langle H \rangle| \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \).

---

### Comparison:
The transition energy is \( \Delta E \approx 2.55 \, \text{eV} \), while the paramagnetic coupling term is \( |\langle H \rangle| \approx 5.8 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{eV} \). Clearly:

\[
|\langle H \rangle| \ll \Delta E.
\]

Thus, the paramagnetic coupling term is much smaller than the transition energy.
