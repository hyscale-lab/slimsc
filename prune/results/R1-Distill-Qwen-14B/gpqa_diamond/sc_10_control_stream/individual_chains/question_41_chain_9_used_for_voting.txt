Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the speed of light in a moving medium. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says a light beam is propagating through a glass with index of refraction n. The glass is moving at a constant velocity v in the same direction as the beam and toward the observer. I need to find the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the lab. The options are A to D, and I have to pick the right one.

Wait, wait. So the glass is moving. I remember that the speed of light in a medium depends on the medium's properties, but what about when the medium itself is moving relative to the observer? Oh right, this is probably about the relativistic Doppler effect or maybe just the simple addition of velocities. But wait, the problem says "speed of light in glass relative to the observer". So maybe it's about how the medium's motion affects the observed speed.

Wait, no. The speed of light in a medium at rest is c/n. Because the speed of light in a medium is c divided by the refractive index. So when the medium is moving, how does that affect the observed speed?

I think in the case where the medium is moving, you have to consider the velocity of the medium. So in the lab frame, the glass is moving, so the light's speed would be the speed of the medium plus the light's speed within the medium, but I'm not sure if it's that straightforward.

Wait, but in special relativity, velocities don't just add linearly. Uh-oh, special relativity. So the velocity addition formula applies here. Because the medium is moving, and we're observing the light's speed in the lab frame.

Wait, but the light is within the moving medium. So the speed of light in the medium's frame is c/n. So the lab frame would see a different speed. How do I apply the velocity addition formula here?

The velocity addition formula in relativity is u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/(c²)). But wait, this might not be applicable in this case because the medium is moving, not the light's frame. Alternatively, perhaps we have to think of it differently.

Wait, let me get this straight. In the rest frame of the glass (let's call it S'), the light is moving at speed v_light' = c/n in the same direction as the glass's movement. Then, in the lab frame (S), which is moving at velocity v relative to S' (since the glass is moving at v towards the observer), we can use the velocity addition formula to find the speed of the light in the lab frame.

So, in S', the speed of light is u' = c/n in the same direction as the glass is moving (since the beam is propagating towards the observer, who is in the lab frame where the glass is moving towards them). Wait, no, wait. The glass is moving towards the observer, and the light is moving in the same direction as the glass. So in the glass's frame, the light is moving forward.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify the directions. Let's say the lab frame S is where the glass is moving at velocity v. The glass is moving in the same direction as the light beam, which is also towards the observer. So in the glass's frame S', the light is moving at c/n in the direction of motion, which is the same as the direction the glass is moving in the lab frame.

So in S', the speed of the light is u' = c/n. Then, in S (the lab frame), the speed u would be given by the velocity addition formula.

The formula for adding velocities between frames is u = (u' + v) / (1 + (u' v)/(c²)).

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure about the direction. If the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, then the S' frame (glass's frame) is moving at velocity v relative to S. So in S, the light's speed is u, and in S', it's u'.

So u = [u' + v]/[1 + (u' v)/(c^2)].

But wait, u' is the velocity of the light in the S' frame, which is c/n in the same direction as v. So substituting u' = c/n, we get:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v)/(n c )

So denominator becomes (n c + v ) / (n c )

So u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c ) ]

Wait, let me compute that. Let me compute denominator and numerator.

Numerator is (c + n v)/n.

Denominator is (n c + v)/(n c )

So when you divide them, numerator multiplied by reciprocal of denominator:

[(c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n in the denominator and numerator cancel out.

So it's (c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Wait, but numerator is (c + n v) * c, and denominator is (n c + v). Hmm.

Wait, but the denominator is (n c + v), and the numerator is c (c + n v) = c^2 + c n v.

So u = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them have a c squared. Let me think—did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait. The problem states that c is taken as 1. So c = 1. Let me substitute that in.

So u = [ (1 + n v) * 1 ] / (n *1 + v )

Which simplifies to (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v). That's the same as what I got.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm confused. Because according to the velocity addition formula, the speed shouldn't exceed c, but in this case, if n is greater than 1, and v is positive, then (1 +n v)/(n + v) is less than 1, since denominator is bigger than numerator?

Wait, let me compute for example: n=2, v=0.5. Numerator is 1+2*0.5=2. Denominator is 2+0.5=2.5. So 2/2.5=0.8 <1. That's fine. So the result is less than c.

Alternatively, if the medium is moving in the opposite direction, but in this problem, the medium is moving in the same direction as the light.

So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is inside the glass.

So the speed of light in the glass is c/n, but the medium is moving at v. So the speed of the light relative to the lab is the speed of light in the medium plus the medium's speed? No, that's the Galilean addition, which is only correct at non-relativistic speeds. But since c is involved, we have to use the relativistic addition formula.

Wait, but wait. The speed within the medium is u' = c/n, and the medium is moving at v. So the lab frame would see u = (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² ). Which is what I did earlier.

So that gives (c + n v)/(n + v ), which when c=1 is (1 +n v)/(n + v ), which is option A.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach: in the lab frame, the light is propagating through moving glass. But how does the motion of the glass affect the light's speed? Because the refractive index is part of the medium's property, which is moving. So the observed speed would be the speed of light in the moving medium, which might involve both the medium's velocity and the light's speed in the medium.

Wait, but another way: consider the medium is moving, so the light's speed relative to the lab frame is as per the addition formula. So yes, the same conclusion as before.

So the correct answer is option A.

To determine the speed of light in the glass relative to the observer in the laboratory, we analyze the situation using relativistic velocity addition. The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, and the refractive index of the glass is \( n \). The speed of light in a medium at rest is \( c/n \), where \( c \) is the speed of light in vacuum. Since the glass is moving, the observed speed of light in the laboratory frame must account for the motion of the medium.

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u = \frac{u' + v}{1 + \frac{u' v}{c^2}}
\]

where \( u' = c/n \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory. Substituting \( u' = c/n \) into the formula gives:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c + n v}{n}}{\frac{n c + v}{n c}}
\]

Canceling \( n \) in the numerator and denominator:

\[
u = \frac{c + n v}{n c + v}
\]

Since the problem states \( c = 1 \), substitute \( c = 1 \):

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. The result is consistent with relativistic principles and ensures the observed speed of light does not exceed \( c \).

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure about the direction. If the glass is moving at velocity v in the lab frame, then the S' frame (glass's frame) is moving at velocity v relative to S. So in S, the light's speed is u, and in S', it's u'.

But wait, u' is the velocity of the light in the S' frame, which is c/n in the same direction as v. So substituting u' = c/n, we get:

u = ( (c/n) + v ) / (1 + ( (c/n) * v ) / c² )

Simplify denominator: 1 + (v)/(n c )

So denominator becomes (n c + v ) / (n c )

So u = [ (c + n v ) / n ] / [ (n c + v ) / (n c ) ]

Wait, let me compute that. Let me compute denominator and numerator.

Numerator is (c + n v)/n.

Denominator is (n c + v)/(n c )

So when you divide them, numerator multiplied by reciprocal of denominator:

[(c + n v)/n ] * [ n c / (n c + v) ) ]

The n in the denominator and numerator cancel out.

So it's (c + n v) * c / (n c + v )

Wait, but numerator is (c + n v) * c, and denominator is (n c + v). Hmm.

Wait, but the denominator is (n c + v), and the numerator is c (c + n v) = c^2 + c n v.

So u = [ c (c + n v) ] / (n c + v )

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them have a c squared. Let me think—did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait. The problem states that c is taken as 1. So c = 1. Let me substitute that in.

So u = [ (1 + n v) * 1 ] / (n *1 + v )

Which simplifies to (1 + n v) / (n + v )

Looking at the options, option A is (1 + n v)/(n + v). That's the same as what I got.

Wait, but wait a second. I'm confused. Because according to the velocity addition formula, the speed shouldn't exceed c, but in this case, if n is greater than 1, and v is positive, then (1 +n v)/(n + v) is less than 1, since denominator is bigger than numerator?

Alternatively, if the medium is moving in the opposite direction, but in this problem, the medium is moving in the same direction as the light.

So the answer should be option A.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach: in the lab frame, the glass is moving at velocity v, and the light is inside the glass.

The glass is moving at a constant velocity \( v \) in the same direction as the light beam, and the refractive index of the glass is \( n \). The speed of light in a medium at rest is \( c/n \), where \( c \) is the speed of light in vacuum.

Using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

where \( u' = c/n \) is the speed of light in the glass's rest frame, and \( v \) is the velocity of the glass relative to the laboratory. Substituting \( u' = c/n \) into the formula gives:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c}{n} + v}{1 + \frac{\left(\frac{c}{n}\right) v}{c^2}}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
1 + \frac{v}{n c}
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
u = \frac{\frac{c + n v}{n}}{\frac{n c + v}{n c}}
\]

Canceling \( n \) in the numerator and denominator:

\[
u = \frac{c + n v}{n c + v}
\]

Since the problem states \( c = 1 \), substitute \( c = 1 \):

\[
u = \frac{1 + n v}{n + v}
\]

This matches option A. The result is consistent with relativistic principles and ensures the observed speed of light does not exceed \( c \).
