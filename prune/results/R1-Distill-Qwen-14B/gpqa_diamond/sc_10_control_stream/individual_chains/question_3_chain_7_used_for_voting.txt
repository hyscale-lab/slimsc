Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what it's about.

The question says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition of its spin-up and spin-down states. The state is given as 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. And the task is to find the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx.

Hmm, I remember that the expectation value of an operator gives the average value you'd measure for a large number of identical systems in the same state. So, expectation values are calculated using the formula ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator.

Wait, but σz and σx are Pauli matrices, right? So I think I need to find the expectation values of σz and σx separately and then combine them with the coefficients.

First, let me write down the state. The state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (√3/2) |↓⟩. Let me check if this is normalized. The sum of the squares of the coefficients should be 1.

Calculating: (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 0.25 + 0.75 = 1. Okay, so it's normalized. Good.

Now, the operator is 10σz +5σx. The expectation value of this operator is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. So I can compute each expectation value separately.

Starting with σz. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, the expectation value of σz for the state ψ is straightforward.

The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.5)^2 * (1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1).

Calculating that: (0.25)(1) + (3/4)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Then, 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, onto ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is a bit trickier because it's the Pauli X matrix, which doesn't have |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as eigenstates. Instead, σx has eigenstates that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, but maybe I can compute the expectation value directly using the state ψ.

The Pauli X matrix is given by:

σx = [[0, 1],
       [1, 0]]

So, in matrix form, σx is a 2x2 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by ψ† σx ψ.

Expressed in terms of the state components. Let me write ψ as a column vector. Let me denote |↑⟩ as [1; 0] and |↓⟩ as [0; 1]. So ψ is 0.5 [1; 0] + (sqrt(3)/2) [0; 1] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ is:
[ 0.5
  sqrt(3)/2 ]

Then ψ† is the conjugate transpose, which for real coefficients is just [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ† σx ψ is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) multiplied by σx, which is [[0,1],[1,0]], multiplied by [0.5; sqrt(3)/2}.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute σx multiplied by ψ. That's:

σx * ψ = [ [0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2)], [1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2)] ]

So, first component is (0.5 * 0) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 1) → sqrt(3)/2.

Second component is (0.5 *1) + 0 → 0.5.

So σx ψ = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Now, multiply ψ† with this result.

ψ† * (σx ψ) = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ] * [ sqrt(3)/2 ; 0.5 ]

This is 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5.

Wait, let me compute each term. The first term is 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3))/4.

The second term is (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = (sqrt(3))/4. So adding them together: (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = (2 sqrt(3))/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a minute, this would give ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Hmm, but wait, I thought that the expectation value of σx for a spin in the x-direction would be 1, but maybe that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

The state ψ is a=0.5 |↑⟩ + b= (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is 2*(Re(a*b*)) because σx is represented as a matrix, but maybe another approach is better.

Wait, another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is using the formula: ⟨σx⟩ = |a|^2 * σx_{up} + |b|^2 * σx_{down} + 2 Re(a b^* σx_{up down term}).

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the general formula.

The expectation value is:

⟨σx⟩ = (⟨ψ|) σx (|ψ⟩).

But another way to compute it is using the components.

If ψ is written as a column vector [a; b], then ψ† σx ψ is a*b* + b a*, because σx has 0s on the diagonal and 1s on off-diagonal.

Wait, no. Because σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you multiply ψ† (which is [a*, b*]) with σx, you get [b*, a*]. Then you multiply by ψ, which is [a; b]. So the product is b* a + a* b.

So that's 2 Re(a b* ).

Oh, that's a simpler approach. So let me compute that.

Here, a is 0.5, and b is sqrt(3)/2.

So a b* = (0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2) = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4 ≈ 0.4330.

The real part of a b* (since a and b are real here) is sqrt(3)/4.

So 2 Re(a b* ) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So yes, that confirms the earlier result. So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait, I thought that for a state along x, like (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2), the expectation value of σx would be 1, but that's because in such a case, a = b = 1/sqrt(2), so a b* is (1/sqrt(2)))(1/sqrt(2)) ) = 1/2, and 2 Re(a b* ) is 2*(1/2) )=1.

So in this problem, the coefficients are different. So the expectation value is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait another thing, maybe I should have considered that the state is (0.5)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So, let's compute the expectation value of σx again using this method.

Yes, as I did before, that gives me 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (0.5*sqrt(3)/2)*2 = 0.5*sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So, putting it all together, the expectation value of 10σz + 5σx is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Let me compute each term:

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5 * 1.73205)/2 ≈ (8.66025)/2 ≈ 4.330125.

Adding them together: -5 +4.330125 ≈ -0.669875.

Wait, but wait, this gives approximately -0.6699, which rounds to about -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because I'm a bit confused. Hmm.

Wait, wait: I think I might have made a mistake in how I applied the operator. Let me go back.

The operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

We found ⟨σz⟩ = -0.5.

⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So:

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(0.8660) ≈ 4.330.

Adding: -5 +4.330 = -0.6699, which is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal.

So, the answer would be option C) -0.7.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ⟨σx⟩. Let me think again.

Wait, another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is to write out the matrix form and compute the product.

The state ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

The σx matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So, σx ψ = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, ψ† σx ψ is the dot product of ψ and (σx ψ).

Which is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5).

So 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 is (sqrt(3))/4.

Then sqrt(3)/2 *0.5 is also (sqrt(3))/4.

Adding them gives (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

So that's correct. So 5*(sqrt(3)/2) is approximately 5 * 0.8660 ≈ 4.33.

So then, 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2 )= -5 +4.330 ≈ -0.6699.

So, the expectation value is approximately -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So option C is the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) for \( \sigma_z \), respectively. The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.5)^2 \cdot (+1) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-1).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot (+1) + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

Thus, \( 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5 \).

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix is:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The state \( \psi \) is written as a column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is computed as:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \psi^\dagger \sigma_x \psi.
\]

First, compute \( \sigma_x \psi \):

\[
\sigma_x \psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, compute \( \psi^\dagger (\sigma_x \psi) \):

\[
\psi^\dagger (\sigma_x \psi) = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Thus, \( 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 5 \cdot 0.866 = 4.33 \).

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is approximately \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is:

**C) -0.7**

The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩. So the expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is (0.5)^2 * (1) + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 * (-1).

Calculating that: (0.25)(1) + (3/4)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. So ⟨σz⟩ is -0.5.

Then, 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5.

Now, onto ⟨σx⟩. Hmm, σx is a bit trickier because it's the Pauli X matrix, which doesn't have |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ as eigenstates. Instead, σx has eigenstates that are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, but maybe I can compute the expectation value directly using the state ψ.

σx = [[0, 1],
       [1, 0]]

So, in matrix form, σx is a 2x2 matrix with 0s on the diagonal and 1s off-diagonal.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is given by ψ† σx ψ.

Expressed in terms of the state components. Let me write ψ as a column vector. Let me denote |↑⟩ as [1; 0] and |↓⟩ as [0; 1]. So ψ is 0.5 [1; 0] + (sqrt(3)/2) [0; 1] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ is:
[ 0.5
  sqrt(3)/2 ]

Then ψ† is the conjugate transpose, which for real coefficients is just [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ† σx ψ is (0.5, sqrt(3)/2) multiplied by σx, which is [[0,1],[1,0]], multiplied by [0.5; sqrt(3)/2}.

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute σx multiplied by ψ. That's:

σx * ψ = [ [0*0.5 + 1*(sqrt(3)/2)], [1*0.5 + 0*(sqrt(3)/2)] ]

So, first component is (0.5 * 0) + (sqrt(3)/2 * 1) → sqrt(3)/2.

Second component is (0.5 *1) + 0 → 0.5.

So σx ψ = [sqrt(3)/2; 0.5].

Now, multiply ψ† with this result.

ψ† * (σx ψ) = [0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ] * [ sqrt(3)/2 ; 0.5 ]

This is 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5.

Wait, let me compute each term. The first term is 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (sqrt(3))/4.

The second term is (sqrt(3)/2) * 0.5 = (sqrt(3))/4. So adding them together: (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = (2 sqrt(3))/4 ) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a minute, this would give ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Hmm, but wait, I thought that the expectation value of σx for a spin in the x-direction would be 1, but maybe that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

The state ψ is a=0.5 |↑⟩ + b= (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is 2*(Re(a*b*)) because σx is represented as a matrix, but maybe another approach is better.

Wait, another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is using the formula: ⟨σx⟩ = |a|^2 * σx_{up} + |b|^2 * σx_{down} + 2 Re(a b^* σx_{up down term}).

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the general formula.

The expectation value is:

⟨σx⟩ = (⟨ψ|) σx (|ψ⟩).

But another way to compute it is using the components.

If ψ is written as a column vector [a; b], then ψ† σx ψ is a*b* + b a*, because σx has 0s on the diagonal and 1s on off-diagonal.

Wait, no. Because σx is [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you multiply ψ† (which is [a*, b*]) with σx, you get [b*, a*]. Then you multiply by ψ, which is [a; b]. So the product is b* a + a* b.

So that's 2 Re(a b* ).

Oh, that's a simpler approach. So let me compute that.

Here, a is 0.5, and b is sqrt(3)/2.

So a b* = (0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2) = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/4 ≈ 0.4330.

The real part of a b* (since a and b are real here) is sqrt(3)/4.

So 2 Re(a b* ) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So yes, that confirms the earlier result. So ⟨σx⟩ = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait, I thought that for a state along x, like (|↑⟩ + |↓⟩)/sqrt(2), the expectation value of σx would be 1, but that's because in such a case, a = b = 1/sqrt(2), so a b* is (1/sqrt(2)))(1/sqrt(2)) ) = 1/2, and 2 Re(a b* ) is 2*(1/2) )=1.

So in this problem, the coefficients are different. So the expectation value is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait another thing, maybe I should have considered that the state is (0.5)|↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩. So, let's compute the expectation value of σx again using this method.

Yes, as I did before, that gives me 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (0.5*sqrt(3)/2)*2 = 0.5*sqrt(3) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So, putting it all together, the expectation value of 10σz + 5σx is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2).

Let me compute each term:

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(sqrt(3)/2) is (5 * 1.73205)/2 ≈ (8.66025)/2 ≈ 4.330125.

Adding them together: -5 +4.330125 ≈ -0.669875.

Wait, but wait, this gives approximately -0.6699, which rounds to about -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because I'm a bit confused. Hmm.

Wait, wait: I think I might have made a mistake in how I applied the operator. Let me go back.

The operator is 10σz +5σx. So the expectation value is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

We found ⟨σz⟩ = -0.5.

⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So:

10*(-0.5) = -5.

5*(0.8660) ≈ 4.330.

Adding: -5 +4.330 = -0.6699, which is approximately -0.7 when rounded to one decimal.

So, the answer would be option C) -0.7.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ⟨σx⟩. Let me think again.

Wait, another way to compute ⟨σx⟩ is to write out the matrix form and compute the product.

The state ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

The σx matrix is [[0,1],[1,0]].

So, σx ψ = [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, ψ† σx ψ is the dot product of ψ and (σx ψ).

Which is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5).

So 0.5 * sqrt(3)/2 is (sqrt(3))/4.

Then sqrt(3)/2 *0.5 is also (sqrt(3))/4.

Adding them gives (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2.

So that's correct. So 5*(sqrt(3)/2) is approximately 5 * 0.8660 ≈ 4.33.

So then, 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2 )= -5 +4.330 ≈ -0.6699.

So, the expectation value is approximately -0.67, which rounds to -0.7. So option C is the correct answer.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) correspond to eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) for \( \sigma_z \), respectively. The expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.5)^2 \cdot (+1) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (-1).
\]

Simplify:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 0.25 \cdot (+1) + 0.75 \cdot (-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

Thus, \( 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle = 10 \cdot (-0.5) = -5 \).

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The Pauli \( \sigma_x \) matrix is:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The state \( \psi \) is written as a column vector:

\[
\psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The expectation value \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \) is computed as:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = \psi^\dagger \sigma_x \psi.
\]

First, compute \( \sigma_x \psi \):

\[
\sigma_x \psi = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

Next, compute \( \psi^\dagger (\sigma_x \psi) \):

\[
\psi^\dagger (\sigma_x \psi) = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 & \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \\ 0.5 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Thus, \( 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 5 \cdot 0.866 = 4.33 \).

### Step 3: Combine Results
The total expectation value is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is approximately \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is:

**C) -0.7**

Answer: C
