Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question is about selecting suitable reagents for two reactions. The first reaction is butan-2-one reacting with NaCN and another reagent A to produce 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. The second reaction is 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenetrile reacting with reagent B (and H2O) to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. The options are given for what A and B could be.

Hmm, I remember that NaCN is a nucleophile. So in the first reaction, butan-2-one is reacting with NaCN. Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO, a ketone. So when a ketone reacts with a nucleophile like CN-, it's probably a nucleophilic addition. But wait, ketones usually don't react with CN- directly without some kind of catalyst or under specific conditions. Oh, right! I think that in the presence of a strong acid, the carbonyl group can be protonated, making it more electrophilic, which allows the nucleophilic attack. So maybe reagent A is an acid. But looking at the product, it's 2-hydroxy... so wait, but the product seems to have a hydroxyl and a nitrile group. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, butan-2-one is (CH3)2CO. If it reacts with NaCN and something else, A, to give 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanenitrile. Let me draw that. The product structure would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So the carbonyl oxygen is replaced with -CN and -OH groups? Wait, but that doesn't make sense because adding a nitrile and a hydroxyl... Maybe I'm mixing up the reactions.

Wait, maybe it's a substitution. Oh wait, no, butan-2-one is a ketone, which undergoes nucleophilic addition. So when a ketone reacts with HCN (or CN-), it adds to the carbonyl. But that gives a cyanohydrin. The cyanohydrin of butan-2-one would be (CH3)2C(OH)CN. So that's exactly what the product is. So that's the first reaction. So the reaction is the formation of a cyanohydrin.

So butan-2-one plus NaCN and acid (H3O+?) would form the cyanohydrin. Because HCN is a weak acid, and in the presence of a strong acid, the reaction can proceed. So reagent A is probably H3O+.

So looking at the options, A could be H3O+ if the first reagent is that. Let's see the options.

Option A: A = H3O+, B = HCl
Option B: A = H3O+, B = CH3COOH
Option C: A = NaHSO3, B = HCl
Option D: A = NaHSO3, B = CH3COOH

So for the first reaction, A is H3O+ in options A and B.

That's probably correct because adding acid would protonate the carbonyl, making it more electrophilic, and the CN- would attack.

Now, the second reaction: 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile reacts with B and H2O to form 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanoic acid. So the nitrile group (-CN) is being converted to a carboxylic acid (-COOH). How does that happen?

I remember that nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under certain conditions. The typical reagents are either H2O with acid and heat, or maybe using something like HCl or another strong acid. Alternatively, in the presence of an oxidizing agent.

Wait, but the product here is a carboxylic acid. So the nitrile is being hydrolyzed to -COOH. So the reagents for that reaction would be H2O and an acid, perhaps HCl as a catalyst. Or maybe another acid.

Wait, the reaction is written as 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile + B (H2O) --> ... So B is the reagent, and H2O is part of the reaction. So the conditions are probably acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the nitrile group.

Nitrile hydrolysis to carboxylic acid can be done under strong acidic conditions with heat. The general reaction is RCN + H2O (acid, heat) → RCOOH.

So the reagent B would be an acid. Looking at the options, B in option A is HCl, in option B it's CH3COOH, in C it's HCl, D it's CH3COOH.

So which acid is used for nitrile hydrolysis? I think both HCl and H2SO4 are used for this. Alternatively, sometimes a mixture with H2O and acid is used.

Wait, but the presence of H2O is given in the reaction. So the reagent B would be a strong acid. HCl is a strong acid, and it can act as a catalyst in such hydrolysis reactions.

So for the second reaction, B is HCl. Looking at the options, option A has B as HCl, option C has B as HCl. So options A and C are possibilities.

Wait, but what about reagent A in option C? Because for the first reaction, if A is NaHSO3, that's different. NaHSO3 is sodium bisulfite. Wait, but butan-2-one reacting with NaHSO3... Hmm, I'm not sure. NaHSO3 is often used in the sulfonation of ketones, but I don't think that's the case here. Or perhaps, it's used in the formation of something else.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, when you have a nitrile group and you want to hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid, you can use a strong acid like HCl in H2O, along with heat. Alternatively, you can use a base, but that would give a different product. For example, under basic conditions, nitrile hydrolysis gives a carboxylate, which would then need acid work-up.

Wait, but in the second reaction, the product is a carboxylic acid, so it must have been hydrolyzed under acidic conditions. So the reagent B is an acid.

So for the second reaction, B is HCl. Therefore, looking at options A and C (since B is HCl in those options), the first reaction's reagent A is H3O+ in option A, and NaHSO3 in option C.

Wait, but I thought the first reaction required H3O+ as A. So option A has A=H3O+ and B=HCl, which would make both reactions correct.

Alternatively, option C says A=NaHSO3, which isn't matching what I thought for the first reaction.

So, if option A is the correct one, then first reaction uses H3O+ (so it's an acid), which is correct for the cyanohydrin formation, and the second reaction uses HCl as B, which is correct for the nitrile hydrolysis to acid.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: maybe the first reaction is nucleophilic substitution? No, butan-2-one is a ketone, so it's more likely to undergo addition. So the first step is addition of CN- to the carbonyl, which requires acid catalysis. So yes, H3O+ is needed for that.

So, the correct reagents would be A=H3O+, B=HCl. That's option A.

Wait, but why is the second reaction written with B and H2O? Because reagent B is HCl, and water is the solvent or reactant.

So putting it all together, the correct options are A: H3O+ and HCl.

Looking at the options, option A is A=H3O+, B=HCl. So that should be the right answer.

The first reaction involves the formation of a cyanohydrin from butan-2-one and NaCN. This reaction requires an acidic catalyst to protonate the carbonyl group, making it more electrophilic for nucleophilic attack by CN-. Therefore, the suitable reagent for this step is **H₃O⁺**.

The second reaction involves the hydrolysis of the nitrile group (-CN) in 2-(4-benzylphenyl)-2-hydroxybutanenitrile to form a carboxylic acid (-COOH). Nitrile hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid typically requires a strong acid, such as HCl, in the presence of water. Thus, the suitable reagent for this step is **HCl**.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A**: A = H₃O⁺, B = HCl. This matches both reactions.
- **Option B**: A = H₃O⁺, B = CH₃COOH. While A is correct, B (CH₃COOH) is not suitable for nitrile hydrolysis.
- **Option C**: A = NaHSO₃, B = HCl. NaHSO₃ is not suitable for the first reaction.
- **Option D**: A = NaHSO₃, B = CH₃COOH. Neither reagent is suitable for the first reaction.

The correct answer is **Option A**, as it provides the appropriate reagents for both reactions.
