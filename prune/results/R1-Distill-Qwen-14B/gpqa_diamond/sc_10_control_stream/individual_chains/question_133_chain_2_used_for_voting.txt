Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in this solution. The temperatures given are at 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think temperature will affect the calculations beyond the given Ka values.

The data provided includes the molecular weights (Mw) of the two compounds: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. Also, the Ka values for H3PO4 are given: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. 

Hmm, I remember that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. Each deprotonation corresponds to a step, so H3PO4 → H2PO4^- (with Ka1), H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- (Ka2), and HPO4^2- → PO4^3- (Ka3). 

Wait, but in the solution, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, KH2PO4 is the dihydrogen phosphate salt, which would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4 is disodium hydrogen phosphate, which would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. 

I think the key here is to figure out the reaction between these two salts. Because when you mix a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), they will form a buffer solution. The buffer will resist changes in pH, and we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. Once we have the pH, we can determine the concentration of PO4^3- ions since that's the third deprotonation.

Wait, but wait a second. H3PO4 is a weak acid, so in solution, it will dissociate stepwise. The first dissociation is the most significant, the second much less, and the third even less. So, when we have a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, their concentrations will influence the pH, and from that pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

So, let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the moles of each salt.
2. Determine their concentrations in the solution.
3. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of the buffer.
4. Use the pH to find the concentration of PO4^3- using the third dissociation constant.

Let me start with step 1.

First, moles of KH2PO4:

Moles = mass / molar mass
Mw of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007343 mol.

Since the volume is 0.2 L, the concentration is 0.007343 / 0.2 ≈ 0.036715 M. So [H2PO4^-] is approximately 0.036715 M.

Now, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005616 mol.

The volume is 0.2 L, so concentration is 0.005616 / 0.2 ≈ 0.02808 M. So [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.02808 M.

Wait, but wait. Na2HPO4·2H2O: when it dissociates, each formula unit gives 2 Na+ and one HPO4^2- ion. So the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02808 M. So that makes sense.

Now, the buffer system is H2PO4^- (weak acid) and HPO4^2- (conjugate base). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies here: pH = pKa2 + log([A^-]/[HA])

Wait, wait, no: the second dissociation is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+. So the pKa for this step is pKa2, which is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208. So the equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Let me compute the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-].

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M, [H2PO4^-] is 0.036715 M.

Ratio = 0.02808 / 0.036715 ≈ 0.765.

Taking the log of 0.765. Hmm, log(0.765) ≈ log(0.75) is about -0.125, but more accurately:

We can calculate log(0.765) = ln(0.765)/ln(10) ≈ (-0.269)/2.3026 ≈ -0.117.

So pH = 7.208 + (-0.117) ≈ 7.091.

Wait, but wait again. The pKa2 is 7.208, right? So adding -0.117 gives pH ≈ 7.091.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for the ratio. 0.02808 divided by 0.036715. Let me compute that more accurately.

0.02808 / 0.036715 = (2808 / 36715) ≈ 0.7645.

So ln(0.7645) ≈ -0.2686, so log10 is about -0.117.

So pH is approximately 7.208 - 0.117 = 7.091.

So pH ≈ 7.09.

Now, with this pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3- (which is the third deprotonation step).

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3 is log(1/(1.8e-12)) → wait no, wait pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa3 is -log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74.

Wait, but wait. The pH is 7.09, which is below the pKa3 of 11.74. So the solution is more acidic than the pKa3. That means the dissociation towards PO4^3- is minimal. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be low.

How can we find [PO4^3-]? Well, using the third dissociation. The expression is:

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We have Ka3 = 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M, and [H+] is 1e-7.09 ≈ 8.42e-8.

Wait, let's compute [H+], which is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.09) ≈ 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.09) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.851 ≈ 8.51e-8 M.

Wait, more accurately, 7.09 pH. 10^7 is 1e7, so 10^7.09 is 1.2e7, but wait, wait, no: 10^7.09 is 10^(7) * 10^0.09. 10^0.09 is about 1.229. So 10^7.09 ≈ 1.229e7 → so [H+] is 1/(1.229e7) ≈ 8.14e-8 M.

Hmm, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me compute 10^(-7.09) accurately.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach.

But for the sake of this problem, let's proceed with [H+] = 1e-7.09 ≈ approximately 8.51e-8 M.

So putting the numbers together:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

So that's (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / (8.51e-8)

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 ≈ 5.054e-14.

Denominator: 8.51e-8.

So 5.054e-14 / 8.51e-8 = (5.054 / 8.51) * 1e-6.

Calculating 5.054 / 8.51 ≈ 0.5938.

So 0.5938e-6 = 5.938e-7 M.

Wait, but wait, let me check the numbers again.

Another approach: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 = ?

1.8 * 0.02808 is approximately 0.050544. So 0.050544e-12 → 5.0544e-14.

Divide by 8.51e-8: 5.0544e-14 / 8.51e-8 = (5.0544 / 8.51) * 1e-6 → as before, approximately 0.5938e-6 → 5.938e-7 M. So approximately 5.94e-7 M.

Now, looking at the options:

A) 6.24e-7

B) 5.48e-7

C) 2.81e-7

D) 3.97e-7

Hmm, my calculation gave around 5.94e-7, which isn't exactly any of the options. But perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Let me retrace the steps.

First, the moles of each:

KH2PO4: 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007343 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g / 177.99 → 1/177.99 ≈ 0.005616 mol.

Concentrations in 0.2 L: 0.036715 M H2PO4^- and 0.02808 M HPO4^2-.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) → wait, no, pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that accurately.

6.2e-8 → log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.7924 -8 → -7.2076, so pKa2 is 7.2076.

The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02808 / 0.036715 = let me compute that more accurately.

0.02808 ÷ 0.036715 ≈ 0.765.

So log(0.765) → using a calculator, I can compute this more accurately.

Using a calculator (if I were doing this in real life), log(0.765) is approximately -0.116.

So pH = 7.2076 + (-0.116) ≈ 7.0916.

So [H+] is 10^(-7.0916) ≈ 8.42e-8 M.

Now, the third dissociation: HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-] → [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

So, plugging the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M.

[H+] is 8.42e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / (8.42e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 = 5.0544e-14.

Denominator: 8.42e-8.

So, 5.0544e-14 / 8.42e-8 = (5.0544 / 8.42) * 1e-6.

5.0544 / 8.42 ≈ 0.5999 ≈ 0.6.

So 0.6e-6 → 6.0e-7 M.

Wait, but the options don't have 6.0e-7. The closest option is A) 6.24e-7.

But in my first calculation, I got around 5.94e-7, which is about 5.9e-7, and option B is 5.48e-7.

Hmm. Maybe I should recheck the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the H+ calculation.

Wait, pH is 7.0916 → [H+] is 1e-7.0916.

Let me compute 1e-7.0916.

Since 10^0.0916 is approximately 1.237 (since 10^0.1 ≈ 1.258, 10^0.09 is about 1.23).

So 10^7.0916 = 10^7 * 10^0.0916 ≈ 1e7 * 1.237 → 1.237e7.

So 1/[H+] = 1.237e7 → [H+] is 8.08e-8 M.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, using a calculator:

H+ = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.0916).

Let me compute 10^7.0916.

10^7 is 1e7.

0.0916 is the decimal part.

10^0.0916 ≈ 1.237 (exact calculation: since log(1.237)=0.0916?)

Wait, let me check: log(1.237) → log(1.2) is 0.07918, log(1.23)=0.0899, log(1.237)=?

Using a calculator: 1.237^10 is about 10^(0.0916)=1.237.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 10^0.0916.

Using the formula 10^x ≈ 1 + x * ln(10) + (x^2 * (ln(10))^2)/2 + ... but maybe that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach: 0.0916 * ln(10) ≈ 0.0916 * 2.302585 ≈ 0.21087.

So e^(0.21087) ≈ 1.235.

So 10^(7.0916) = 1.235e7 → [H+] = 1/(1.235e7) ≈ 8.1e-8 M.

Wait, more precisely, 1.235e7 is 12,350,000, so 1/12,350,000 ≈ 8.1e-8 M.

So [H+] is approximately 8.1e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / (8.1e-8) → numerator is 5.0544e-14, denominator 8.1e-8.

5.0544e-14 / 8.1e-8 → (5.0544 / 8.1) * 1e-6.

5.0544 / 8.1 → approximately 0.623.

So 0.623e-6 → 6.23e-7 M.

Ah! So that's about 6.23e-7, which matches option A) 6.24e-7.

Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier in the [H+] calculation, leading me to an incorrect initial approximation. So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait another moment: when I calculated the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-], I took the values as 0.02808 and 0.036715, respectively. But wait, in reality, when you mix KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, perhaps the solution's total volume is 200 cm³, but the contributions from the salts' waters of crystallization might affect the actual volume. But the problem states the volume is 200 cm³, so I think that's the volume we should use regardless of the salts' hydration.

Also, considering that both salts are completely dissociated, their concentrations are as calculated.

Another point to consider is whether the amounts of the salts are correct. Let me recheck the molar masses.

KH2PO4: K=39.10, H2=2*(1.008)=2.016, P=30.97, O4=64.00. So sum: 39.10 + 2.016 +30.97 +64 = 136.086, which rounds to 136.09 g/mol. So correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Na is 22.99 each, so 2*22.99=45.98. HPO4^2-: H=1.008, P=30.97, O4=64. So HPO4^2- is 1.008 +30.97 +64 = 96.0 (approx). Then, the two waters: 2*(18.015)=36.03. So total is 45.98 +96.0 +36.03 ≈ 177.01, which rounds to 177.99? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O. So that's Na2HPO4 plus 2 H2O.

Na2HPO4: Na is 2*(22.99) =45.98, H=1.008, P=30.97, O4=64 → 45.98 +1.008 +30.97 +64=142.0 (approx). Then, 2 H2O: 2*(18.015) =36.03. So total Mw is 142.0 +36.03=178.03 g/mol. But the given Mw is 177.99, which is close enough, so no problem.

So the moles are accurate.

Wait, but another point: when you mix these two salts, the solution may contain H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. The buffer equation should account for both. So the initial approach was correct.

So with the [H+] being 8.1e-8, the [PO4^3-] comes out to approximately 6.23e-7 M, which is very close to option A) 6.24e-7.

But wait, looking back at the options, option D is 3.97e-7. That's much lower. Did I make a mistake in using the correct Ka?

Wait, for the third dissociation: is [PO4^3-] derived from HPO4^2- in solution, considering that [HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M. Yes, because it's the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution.

Another possibility is that I made a mistake in the Henderson equation. Let me double-check.

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Which would be pKa2 = 7.2076.

Ratio is 0.02808 / 0.036715 = 0.765.

log(0.765) ≈ -0.116.

So pH ≈7.2076 -0.116 = 7.0916.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should use the exact value of Ka3 and not an approximation. Let's compute it more accurately.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M.

[H+] is 8.1e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / 8.1e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8 * 0.02808 = 0.050544 → 5.0544e-14.

Denominator: 8.1e-8.

So 5.0544e-14 / 8.1e-8 = (5.0544 / 8.1) * 1e-6 → 0.6238 * 1e-6 → 6.238e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.24e-7, matching option A.

So, the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but the options provided don't include 6.24e-7 as option A. Let me check the options again:

Options:

A) 6.24x10^-7

Yes, that's correct.

But wait, in the initial calculation, I thought I had a different value. Oh, no, the initial calculation gives 6.24e-7, which is option A.

Hmm, but when I first computed, I thought the answer was around 5.9e-7, but after recalculating, it's 6.24e-7. So option A is the correct answer.

But wait, another angle: perhaps the activity coefficients are considered, but the problem doesn't mention that, so we can ignore that.

Another thing: perhaps I should use more precise values for the logarithms and concentrations.

Wait, let's compute the ratio again.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02808 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.036715 M.

Ratio = 0.02808 / 0.036715 = let me compute this precisely.

0.02808 ÷ 0.036715.

Let me write it as 2808 / 36715.

36715 divided by 2808.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute 2808 ÷ 36715.

Well, 36715 × 0.765 = let me compute 36715 * 0.7 = 25700.5; 36715 * 0.06 = 2202.9; 36715 * 0.005=183.575. Sum: 25700.5 +2202.9=27903.4 +183.575=28086.975. So 36715 × 0.765 ≈28086.975. So 2808 is approximately 0.765 times 36715.

Hmm, but wait, 2808 is less than 28086.975. So perhaps the ratio is 2808 /36715 ≈ 0.0765 approximately. Wait, no, 2808 is about 0.0765 times 36715, but that can't be right since 0.0765 *36715 is about 2807. So 2808/36715 = 0.0765.

Wait, wait, wait, no, that's not correct. Because 2808 is the numerator, 36715 is denominator. So 2808 /36715 ≈ 0.0765 → wait, that can't be right because 0.0765 *36715 is 2807. So yes, 2808/36715 is approximately 0.0765.

Wait, but earlier I thought the ratio was 0.765, but that would mean 0.765 times 36715 is 2808, which is not correct. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, 0.0765 *36715 = 2808.

Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier in the ratio calculation. The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02808 / 0.036715 → which is 0.0765 (not 0.765). Oh no! That's a big mistake. So earlier, I miscalculated the ratio as 0.765, but it's actually 0.0765.

Oh no, that changes everything. So I think I messed up the ratio, which threw off the entire calculation.

Wait, that's a big error. Let me recalculate.

So, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M, [H2PO4^-] is 0.036715 M.

Ratio = 0.02808 / 0.036715 → let me compute that.

0.02808 ÷ 0.036715 = approximately 0.02808 / 0.036715 ≈ 0.765?

Wait, no, 0.02808 is 28.08 mM, 0.036715 is 36.715 mM. So 28.08 /36.715 is approximately 0.765. Oh wait, no, that's correct. 0.02808 / 0.036715 = 0.765.

Wait, no, wait: 0.02808 is 2.808e-2, 0.036715 is 3.6715e-2. So 2.808e-2 /3.6715e-2 = 2.808/3.6715 ≈ 0.765.

Oh, so I was correct earlier. The ratio is 0.765, not 0.0765. So the initial calculation was correct, and the ratio is 0.765. So the pH is 7.2076 - 0.116 ≈7.0916.

So then [H+] is 10^-7.0916 ≈8.1e-8.

Wait, but then the [PO4^3-] comes out to 6.23e-7, matching option A.

But wait, earlier I thought the ratio was 0.0765, which would lead to a much lower pH, but that was a mistake. So my initial calculation was correct, and the answer is option A.

But looking back, the options don't have 6.23e-7 as an option? No, option A is 6.24e-7, which matches closely.

Wait, but wait, another possible mistake: I forgot to account for the fact that when you mix the two salts, some of the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- might react with each other? But no, because they're in solution as their respective ions, so the buffer solution is formed, and they don't react further. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch approach holds.

Wait, another thing: perhaps I should consider the third dissociation step more carefully. Because the HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3- and H+.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- is given by Ka3, [H+], and [HPO4^2-].

But perhaps I should consider that the solution may also have a contribution from the autoionization of water, but at pH 7.09, it's negligible compared to the H+ from the acid.

Wait, but no, the H+ from the acid is 8.1e-8, which is higher than 1e-7, so it's the dominant source.

Hmm. So, I think my earlier calculation is correct, and the answer should be option A.

Wait, but why is option B 5.48e-7? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the calculation again.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / 8.1e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 = 5.0544e-14.

Denominator:8.1e-8.

So 5.0544e-14 /8.1e-8 = (5.0544 /8.1) ) * 1e-6.

5.0544 /8.1 → let me compute this accurately.

5.0544 ÷ 8.1 → 8.1 ×0.623 is 5.0543 → so 0.623.

So 0.623e-6 → 6.23e-7, which is option A.

Hmm, yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer is option A, 6.24e-7 M.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles and concentrations of the salts**:  
   - For KH₂PO₄:  
     Moles = $\frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007343 \, \text{mol}$.  
     Concentration = $\frac{0.007343}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.036715 \, \text{M}$.  
     This corresponds to [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.036715 M.  

   - For Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
     Moles = $\frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005616 \, \text{mol}$.  
     Concentration = $\frac{0.005616}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.02808 \, \text{M}$.  
     This corresponds to [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.02808 M.

2. **Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH**:  
   The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (weak acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (conjugate base), with the second dissociation constant of H₃PO₄:  
   $K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}$, so $pK_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208$.  

   The ratio of concentrations is:  
   $\frac{[HPO₄^{2-}]}{[H₂PO₄^-]} = \frac{0.02808}{0.036715} \approx 0.765$.  

   Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
   $\text{pH} = pK_a2 + \log\left(\frac{[HPO₄^{2-}]}{[H₂PO₄^-]}\right)$.  
   $\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log(0.765) \approx 7.208 - 0.117 \approx 7.091$.

3. **Relate pH to [PO₄³⁻] using the third dissociation constant**:  
   The third dissociation of phosphate is:  
   $K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}$, so $pK_a3 = -\log(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \approx 11.74$.  

   The relationship is:  
   $K_a3 = \frac{[PO₄^{3-}][H^+]}{[HPO₄^{2-}]}$.  
   Rearranging:  
   $[PO₄^{3-}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [HPO₄^{2-}]}{[H^+]}$.  

   From the pH, $[H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.091} \approx 8.1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}$.  

   Substituting values:  
   $[PO₄^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02808)}{8.1 \times 10^{-8}}$.  
   Numerator: $(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02808) \approx 5.0544 \times 10^{-14}$.  
   Denominator: $8.1 \times 10^{-8}$.  
   $[PO₄^{3-}] = \frac{5.0544 \times 10^{-14}}{8.1 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}$.

4. **Compare with the options**:  
   The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately $6.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}$, which matches option **A**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says we have a solution with a volume of 200.00 cm³, which is 0.2 liters. In this solution, there are 1.00 grams of KH2PO4 and 1.00 grams of Na2HPO4·2H2O. We need to find the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO4^3-) in this solution. The temperatures given are at 25°C, which is standard, so I don't think temperature will affect the calculations beyond the given Ka values.

The data provided includes the molecular weights (Mw) of the two compounds: KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol, and Na2HPO4·2H2O is 177.99 g/mol. Also, the Ka values for H3PO4 are given: Ka1 is 7.5e-3, Ka2 is 6.2e-8, and Ka3 is 1.8e-12. 

Hmm, I remember that H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, meaning it can donate three protons. Each deprotonation corresponds to a step, so H3PO4 → H2PO4^- (with Ka1), H2PO4^- → HPO4^2- (Ka2), and HPO4^2- → PO4^3- (Ka3). 

Wait, but in the solution, we have KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4·2H2O. So, KH2PO4 is the dihydrogen phosphate salt, which would dissociate into K+ and H2PO4^- ions. Similarly, Na2HPO4 is disodium hydrogen phosphate, which would dissociate into 2 Na+ and HPO4^2- ions. 

I think the key here is to figure out the reaction between these two salts. Because when you mix a weak acid (H2PO4^-) and its conjugate base (HPO4^2-), they will form a buffer solution. The buffer will resist changes in pH, and we can use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH. Once we have the pH, we can determine the concentration of PO4^3- ions since that's the third deprotonation.

Wait, but wait a second. H3PO4 is a weak acid, so in solution, it will dissociate stepwise. The first dissociation is the most significant, the second much less, and the third even less. So, when we have a mixture of H2PO4^- and HPO4^2-, their concentrations will influence the pH, and from that pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3-.

So, let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the moles of each salt.
2. Determine their concentrations in the solution.
3. Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH of the buffer.
4. Use the pH to find the concentration of PO4^3- using the third dissociation constant.

Let me start with step 1.

First, moles of KH2PO4:

Moles = mass / molar mass
Mw of KH2PO4 is 136.09 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007343 mol.

Since the volume is 0.2 L, the concentration is 0.007343 / 0.2 ≈ 0.036715 M. So [H2PO4^-] is approximately 0.036715 M.

Now, moles of Na2HPO4·2H2O. The Mw is 177.99 g/mol. So moles = 1.00 g / 177.99 g/mol ≈ 0.005616 mol.

The volume is 0.2 L, so concentration is 0.005616 / 0.2 ≈ 0.02808 M. So [HPO4^2-] is approximately 0.02808 M.

Wait, but wait. Na2HPO4·2H2O: when it dissociates, each formula unit gives 2 Na+ and one HPO4^2- ion. So the concentration of HPO4^2- is 0.02808 M. So that makes sense.

Now, the buffer system is H2PO4^- (weak acid) and HPO4^2- (conjugate base). The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation applies here: pH = pKa2 + log([A^-]/[HA])

Wait, wait, no: the second dissociation is H2PO4^- ↔ HPO4^2- + H+. So the pKa for this step is pKa2, which is log(6.2e-8) ≈ 7.208. So the equation would be pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Let me compute the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-].

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M, [H2PO4^-] is 0.036715 M.

Ratio = 0.02808 / 0.036715 ≈ 0.765.

Taking the log of 0.765. Hmm, log(0.765) ≈ log(0.75) is about -0.125, but more accurately:

We can calculate log(0.765) = ln(0.765)/ln(10) ≈ (-0.269)/2.3026 ≈ -0.117.

So pH = 7.208 + (-0.117) ≈ 7.091.

Wait, but wait again. The pKa2 is 7.208, right? So adding -0.117 gives pH ≈ 7.091.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for the ratio. 0.02808 divided by 0.036715. Let me compute that more accurately.

0.02808 / 0.036715 = (2808 / 36715) ≈ 0.7645.

So ln(0.7645) ≈ -0.2686, so log10 is about -0.117.

So pH is approximately 7.208 - 0.117 = 7.091.

So pH ≈ 7.09.

Now, with this pH, we can find the concentration of PO4^3- (which is the third deprotonation step).

The third dissociation is HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12, so pKa3 is log(1/(1.8e-12)) → wait no, wait pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa3 is -log(1.8e-12) ≈ 11.74.

Wait, but wait. The pH is 7.09, which is below the pKa3 of 11.74. So the solution is more acidic than the pKa3. That means the dissociation towards PO4^3- is minimal. So the concentration of PO4^3- would be low.

How can we find [PO4^3-]? Well, using the third dissociation. The expression is:

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-]

We can rearrange this to find [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

We have Ka3 = 1.8e-12, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M, and [H+] is 1e-7.09 ≈ 8.42e-8.

Wait, let's compute [H+], which is 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.09) ≈ 10^(-7) * 10^(-0.09) ≈ 1e-7 * 0.851 ≈ 8.51e-8 M.

Wait, more accurately, 7.09 pH. 10^7 is 1e7, so 10^7.09 is 1.2e7, but wait, wait, no: 10^7.09 is 10^(7) * 10^0.09. 10^0.09 is about 1.229. So 10^7.09 ≈ 1.229e7 → so [H+] is 1/(1.229e7) ≈ 8.14e-8 M.

Hmm, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me compute 10^(-7.09) accurately.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach.

But for the sake of this problem, let's proceed with [H+] = 1e-7.09 ≈ approximately 8.51e-8 M.

So putting the numbers together:

[PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

So that's (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / (8.51e-8)

Let me compute numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 ≈ 5.054e-14.

Denominator: 8.51e-8.

So 5.054e-14 / 8.51e-8 = (5.054 / 8.51) * 1e-6.

Calculating 5.054 / 8.51 ≈ 0.5938.

So 0.5938e-6 = 5.938e-7 M.

Wait, but wait, let me check the numbers again.

Another approach: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 = ?

1.8 * 0.02808 is approximately 0.050544. So 0.050544e-12 → 5.0544e-14.

Divide by 8.51e-8: 5.0544e-14 / 8.51e-8 = (5.0544 / 8.51) * 1e-6 → as before, approximately 0.5938e-6 → 5.938e-7 M. So approximately 5.94e-7 M.

Now, looking at the options:

A) 6.24e-7

B) 5.48e-7

C) 2.81e-7

D) 3.97e-7

Hmm, my calculation gave around 5.94e-7, which isn't exactly any of the options. But perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Let me retrace the steps.

First, the moles of each:

KH2PO4: 1.00g / 136.09 g/mol ≈ 0.007343 mol.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: 1.00g / 177.99 → 1/177.99 ≈ 0.005616 mol.

Concentrations in 0.2 L: 0.036715 M H2PO4^- and 0.02808 M HPO4^2-.

Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

pKa2 is log(6.2e-8) → wait, no, pKa2 is -log(6.2e-8). Let me compute that accurately.

6.2e-8 → log(6.2) is about 0.7924, so log(6.2e-8) is 0.7924 -8 → -7.2076, so pKa2 is 7.2076.

The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02808 / 0.036715 = let me compute that more accurately.

0.02808 ÷ 0.036715 ≈ 0.765.

So log(0.765) → using a calculator, I can compute this more accurately.

Using a calculator (if I were doing this in real life), log(0.765) is approximately -0.116.

So pH = 7.2076 + (-0.116) ≈ 7.0916.

So [H+] is 10^(-7.0916) ≈ 8.42e-8 M.

Now, the third dissociation: HPO4^2- ↔ PO4^3- + H+.

Ka3 = [PO4^3-][H+]/[HPO4^2-] → [PO4^3-] = (Ka3 * [HPO4^2-]) / [H+]

So, plugging the numbers:

Ka3 = 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M.

[H+] is 8.42e-8 M.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / (8.42e-8)

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 = 5.0544e-14.

Denominator: 8.42e-8.

So, 5.0544e-14 / 8.42e-8 = (5.0544 / 8.42) * 1e-6.

5.0544 / 8.42 ≈ 0.5999 ≈ 0.6.

So 0.6e-6 → 6.0e-7 M.

Wait, but the options don't have 6.0e-7. The closest option is A) 6.24e-7.

But in my first calculation, I got around 5.94e-7, which is about 5.9e-7, and option B is 5.48e-7.

Hmm. Maybe I should recheck the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the H+ calculation.

Wait, pH is 7.0916 → [H+] is 1e-7.0916.

Let me compute 1e-7.0916.

Since 10^0.0916 is approximately 1.237 (since 10^0.1 ≈ 1.258, 10^0.09 is about 1.23).

So 10^7.0916 = 10^7 * 10^0.0916 ≈ 1e7 * 1.237 → 1.237e7.

So 1/[H+] = 1.237e7 → [H+] is 8.08e-8 M.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, using a calculator:

H+ = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-7.0916).

Let me compute 10^7.0916.

10^7 is 1e7.

0.0916 is the decimal part.

10^0.0916 ≈ 1.237 (exact calculation: since log(1.237)=0.0916?)

Wait, let me check: log(1.237) → log(1.2) is 0.07918, log(1.23)=0.0899, log(1.237)=?

Using a calculator: 1.237^10 is about 10^(0.0916)=1.237.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 10^0.0916.

Using the formula 10^x ≈ 1 + x * ln(10) + (x^2 * (ln(10))^2)/2 + ... but maybe that's overcomplicating.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach: 0.0916 * ln(10) ≈ 0.0916 * 2.302585 ≈ 0.21087.

So e^(0.21087) ≈ 1.235.

So 10^(7.0916) = 1.235e7 → [H+] = 1/(1.235e7) ≈ 8.1e-8 M.

Wait, more precisely, 1.235e7 is 12,350,000, so 1/12,350,000 ≈ 8.1e-8 M.

So [H+] is approximately 8.1e-8 M.

Now, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / (8.1e-8) → numerator is 5.0544e-14, denominator 8.1e-8.

5.0544e-14 / 8.1e-8 → (5.0544 / 8.1) * 1e-6.

5.0544 / 8.1 → approximately 0.623.

So 0.623e-6 → 6.23e-7 M.

Ah! So that's about 6.23e-7, which matches option A) 6.24e-7.

Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier in the [H+] calculation, leading me to an incorrect initial approximation. So the correct answer would be option A.

Wait, but wait another moment: when I calculated the ratio of [HPO4^2-] to [H2PO4^-], I took the values as 0.02808 and 0.036715, respectively. But wait, in reality, when you mix KH2PO4 and Na2HPO4, perhaps the solution's total volume is 200 cm³, but the contributions from the salts' waters of crystallization might affect the actual volume. But the problem states the volume is 200 cm³, so I think that's the volume we should use regardless of the salts' hydration.

Also, considering that both salts are completely dissociated, their concentrations are as calculated.

Another point to consider is whether the amounts of the salts are correct. Let me recheck the molar masses.

KH2PO4: K=39.10, H2=2*(1.008)=2.016, P=30.97, O4=64.00. So sum: 39.10 + 2.016 +30.97 +64 = 136.086, which rounds to 136.09 g/mol. So correct.

Na2HPO4·2H2O: Na is 22.99 each, so 2*22.99=45.98. HPO4^2-: H=1.008, P=30.97, O4=64. So HPO4^2- is 1.008 +30.97 +64 = 96.0 (approx). Then, the two waters: 2*(18.015)=36.03. So total is 45.98 +96.0 +36.03 ≈ 177.01, which rounds to 177.99? Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, the formula is Na2HPO4·2H2O. So that's Na2HPO4 plus 2 H2O.

Na2HPO4: Na is 2*(22.99) =45.98, H=1.008, P=30.97, O4=64 → 45.98 +1.008 +30.97 +64=142.0 (approx). Then, 2 H2O: 2*(18.015) =36.03. So total Mw is 142.0 +36.03=178.03 g/mol. But the given Mw is 177.99, which is close enough, so no problem.

So the moles are accurate.

Wait, but another point: when you mix these two salts, the solution may contain H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- ions. The buffer equation should account for both. So the initial approach was correct.

So with the [H+] being 8.1e-8, the [PO4^3-] comes out to approximately 6.23e-7 M, which is very close to option A) 6.24e-7.

But wait, looking back at the options, option D is 3.97e-7. That's much lower. Did I make a mistake in using the correct Ka?

Wait, for the third dissociation: is [PO4^3-] derived from HPO4^2- in solution, considering that [HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M. Yes, because it's the concentration of HPO4^2- in solution.

Another possibility is that I made a mistake in the Henderson equation. Let me double-check.

pH = pKa2 + log([HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-])

Which would be pKa2 = 7.2076.

Ratio is 0.02808 / 0.036715 = 0.765.

log(0.765) ≈ -0.116.

So pH ≈7.2076 -0.116 = 7.0916.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should use the exact value of Ka3 and not an approximation. Let's compute it more accurately.

Ka3 is 1.8e-12.

[HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M.

[H+] is 8.1e-8 M.

So [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / 8.1e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8 * 0.02808 = 0.050544 → 5.0544e-14.

Denominator: 8.1e-8.

So 5.0544e-14 / 8.1e-8 = (5.0544 / 8.1) * 1e-6 → 0.6238 * 1e-6 → 6.238e-7 M.

Which is approximately 6.24e-7, matching option A.

So, the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but the options provided don't include 6.24e-7 as option A. Let me check the options again:

Options:

A) 6.24x10^-7

Yes, that's correct.

But wait, in the initial calculation, I thought I had a different value. Oh, no, the initial calculation gives 6.24e-7, which is option A.

Hmm, but when I first computed, I thought the answer was around 5.9e-7, but after recalculating, it's 6.24e-7. So option A is the correct answer.

But wait, another angle: perhaps the activity coefficients are considered, but the problem doesn't mention that, so we can ignore that.

Another thing: perhaps I should use more precise values for the logarithms and concentrations.

Wait, let's compute the ratio again.

[HPO4^2-] = 0.02808 M.

[H2PO4^-] = 0.036715 M.

Ratio = 0.02808 / 0.036715 = let me compute this precisely.

0.02808 ÷ 0.036715.

Let me write it as 2808 / 36715.

36715 divided by 2808.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute 2808 ÷ 36715.

Well, 36715 × 0.765 = let me compute 36715 * 0.7 = 25700.5; 36715 * 0.06 = 2202.9; 36715 * 0.005=183.575. Sum: 25700.5 +2202.9=27903.4 +183.575=28086.975. So 36715 × 0.765 ≈28086.975. So 2808 is approximately 0.765 times 36715.

Hmm, but wait, 2808 is less than 28086.975. So perhaps the ratio is 2808 /36715 ≈ 0.0765 approximately. Wait, no, 2808 is about 0.0765 times 36715, but that can't be right since 0.0765 *36715 is about 2807. So 2808/36715 = 0.0765.

Wait, wait, wait, no, that's not correct. Because 2808 is the numerator, 36715 is denominator. So 2808 /36715 ≈ 0.0765 → wait, that can't be right because 0.0765 *36715 is 2807. So yes, 2808/36715 is approximately 0.0765.

Wait, but earlier I thought the ratio was 0.765, but that would mean 0.765 times 36715 is 2808, which is not correct. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, 0.0765 *36715 = 2808.

Hmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier in the ratio calculation. The ratio [HPO4^2-]/[H2PO4^-] is 0.02808 / 0.036715 → which is 0.0765 (not 0.765). Oh no! That's a big mistake. So earlier, I miscalculated the ratio as 0.765, but it's actually 0.0765.

Oh no, that changes everything. So I think I messed up the ratio, which threw off the entire calculation.

Wait, that's a big error. Let me recalculate.

So, [HPO4^2-] is 0.02808 M, [H2PO4^-] is 0.036715 M.

Ratio = 0.02808 / 0.036715 → let me compute that.

0.02808 ÷ 0.036715 = approximately 0.02808 / 0.036715 ≈ 0.765?

Wait, no, 0.02808 is 28.08 mM, 0.036715 is 36.715 mM. So 28.08 /36.715 is approximately 0.765. Oh wait, no, that's correct. 0.02808 / 0.036715 = 0.765.

Wait, no, wait: 0.02808 is 2.808e-2, 0.036715 is 3.6715e-2. So 2.808e-2 /3.6715e-2 = 2.808/3.6715 ≈ 0.765.

Oh, so I was correct earlier. The ratio is 0.765, not 0.0765. So the initial calculation was correct, and the ratio is 0.765. So the pH is 7.2076 - 0.116 ≈7.0916.

So then [H+] is 10^-7.0916 ≈8.1e-8.

Wait, but then the [PO4^3-] comes out to 6.23e-7, matching option A.

But wait, earlier I thought the ratio was 0.0765, which would lead to a much lower pH, but that was a mistake. So my initial calculation was correct, and the answer is option A.

But looking back, the options don't have 6.23e-7 as an option? No, option A is 6.24e-7, which matches closely.

Wait, but wait, another possible mistake: I forgot to account for the fact that when you mix the two salts, some of the H2PO4^- and HPO4^2- might react with each other? But no, because they're in solution as their respective ions, so the buffer solution is formed, and they don't react further. So the Henderson-Hasselbalch approach holds.

Wait, another thing: perhaps I should consider the third dissociation step more carefully. Because the HPO4^2- can dissociate into PO4^3- and H+.

So, the concentration of PO4^3- is given by Ka3, [H+], and [HPO4^2-].

But perhaps I should consider that the solution may also have a contribution from the autoionization of water, but at pH 7.09, it's negligible compared to the H+ from the acid.

Wait, but no, the H+ from the acid is 8.1e-8, which is higher than 1e-7, so it's the dominant source.

Hmm. So, I think my earlier calculation is correct, and the answer should be option A.

Wait, but why is option B 5.48e-7? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the calculation again.

So, [PO4^3-] = (1.8e-12 * 0.02808) / 8.1e-8.

Compute numerator: 1.8e-12 * 0.02808 = 5.0544e-14.

Denominator:8.1e-8.

So 5.0544e-14 /8.1e-8 = (5.0544 /8.1) ) * 1e-6.

5.0544 /8.1 → let me compute this accurately.

5.0544 ÷ 8.1 → 8.1 ×0.623 is 5.0543 → so 0.623.

So 0.623e-6 → 6.23e-7, which is option A.

Hmm, yes, that's correct.

So the correct answer is option A, 6.24e-7 M.


To determine the concentration of orthophosphate ions (PO₄³⁻) in the solution, we analyze the buffer system formed by KH₂PO₄ and Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate moles and concentrations of the salts**:  
   - For KH₂PO₄:  
     Moles = $\frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{136.09 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.007343 \, \text{mol}$.  
     Concentration = $\frac{0.007343}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.036715 \, \text{M}$.  
     This corresponds to [H₂PO₄⁻] = 0.036715 M.  

   - For Na₂HPO₄·2H₂O:  
     Moles = $\frac{1.00 \, \text{g}}{177.99 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.005616 \, \text{mol}$.  
     Concentration = $\frac{0.005616}{0.2 \, \text{L}} \approx 0.02808 \, \text{M}$.  
     This corresponds to [HPO₄²⁻] = 0.02808 M.

2. **Use the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to find the pH**:  
   The buffer system involves H₂PO₄⁻ (weak acid) and HPO₄²⁻ (conjugate base), with the second dissociation constant of H₃PO₄:  
   $K_a2 = 6.2 \times 10^{-8}$, so $pK_a2 = -\log(6.2 \times 10^{-8}) \approx 7.208$.  

   The ratio of concentrations is:  
   $\frac{[HPO₄^{2-}]}{[H₂PO₄^-]} = \frac{0.02808}{0.036715} \approx 0.765$.  

   Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
   $\text{pH} = pK_a2 + \log\left(\frac{[HPO₄^{2-}]}{[H₂PO₄^-]}\right)$.  
   $\text{pH} = 7.208 + \log(0.765) \approx 7.208 - 0.117 \approx 7.091$.

3. **Relate pH to [PO₄³⁻] using the third dissociation constant**:  
   The third dissociation of phosphate is:  
   $K_a3 = 1.8 \times 10^{-12}$, so $pK_a3 = -\log(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \approx 11.74$.  

   The relationship is:  
   $K_a3 = \frac{[PO₄^{3-}][H^+]}{[HPO₄^{2-}]}$.  
   Rearranging:  
   $[PO₄^{3-}] = \frac{K_a3 \cdot [HPO₄^{2-}]}{[H^+]}$.  

   From the pH, $[H^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-7.091} \approx 8.1 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{M}$.  

   Substituting values:  
   $[PO₄^{3-}] = \frac{(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02808)}{8.1 \times 10^{-8}}$.  
   Numerator: $(1.8 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot (0.02808) \approx 5.0544 \times 10^{-14}$.  
   Denominator: $8.1 \times 10^{-8}$.  
   $[PO₄^{3-}] = \frac{5.0544 \times 10^{-14}}{8.1 \times 10^{-8}} \approx 6.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}$.

4. **Compare with the options**:  
   The calculated concentration of PO₄³⁻ is approximately $6.23 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}$, which matches option **A**.
