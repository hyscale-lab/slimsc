Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a spin-half particle is in a linear superposition: 0.5 |↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. These |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of sigma_z, which makes sense because sigma_z has eigenstates for spin-up and spin-down along the z-axis.

The question is asking for the expectation value of the operator 10σz +5σx. Hmm, expectation values. I remember that the expectation value of an operator is the average measurement you'd expect to get for that observable. For a state |ψ⟩, the expectation value ⟨A⟩ is ⟨ψ| A |ψ⟩.

So, to find ⟨10σz +5σx⟩, I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That should make it easier to compute each part separately.

First, let's find ⟨σz⟩. Since the state is a linear combination of σz eigenstates, this part should be straightforward. The state is ψ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩. The eigenvalues for σz are +1 for |↑⟩ and -1 for |↓⟩.

The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is the sum of the probabilities multiplied by their respective eigenvalues. The probability of finding the particle in |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25. Similarly, the probability for |↓⟩ is |sqrt(3)/2|^2. Let me calculate that: (sqrt(3)/2)^2 is (3/4) = 0.75.

So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5. Therefore, 10⟨σz⟩ is 10 * (-0.5) = -5.

Now, the harder part is finding ⟨σx⟩. I'm a bit rusty on how to compute expectation values for σx. I remember that σx is the Pauli X matrix, which is [[0,1],[1,0]]. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, but maybe I can compute the expectation value using the given state.

The expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is ⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩. Let me express ψ as a column vector. |↑⟩ is [1; 0], |↓⟩ is [0;1]. So ψ is [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ is a column vector [0.5; sqrt(3)/2]. Let's compute ψ† σx ψ.

Wait, σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So ψ† is the conjugate transpose, but since all coefficients are real here, it's just the transpose: [0.5, sqrt(3)/2].

So ψ† σx ψ is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2] * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2 ].

Let me compute the matrix multiplication step by step. Let me compute σx multiplied by ψ first.

σx |ψ⟩ = [[0,1],[1,0]] * [0.5; sqrt(3)/2] = [ sqrt(3)/2; 0.5 ].

Then, ψ† times that result: [0.5, sqrt(3)/2 ] * [ sqrt(3)/2; 0.5 ].

Dot product: (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = (sqrt(3)/4) + (sqrt(3)/4) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660...

So ⟨σx⟩ is sqrt(3)/2. So 5⟨σx⟩ is 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5 * 0.8660 ≈ 4.3301.

Wait, but wait. I think I might have made a mistake here. Because the state is given as a linear combination, perhaps I should compute it again using another method to make sure.

Alternative method: The expectation value of σx can be found using the formula (⟨ψ| σx |ψ⟩). Alternatively, σx has expectation value (p - q)/(p + q) where p is the coefficient of |+x⟩ and q is the coefficient of |-x⟩. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach here.

Wait, perhaps there's another way. For any state, the expectation value of σx is given by ( |a|^2 - |b|^2 ) if the state is written as a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, σx is more about the x-component of spin.

Wait, for a spin-1/2 particle, σx is represented by the Pauli X matrix. When the state is written as a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value of σx is (a b* + a* b) because σx is ( |↑⟩⟨↓| + |↓⟩⟨↑| ), and when you apply that to a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, you get a b* + a* b.

Wait, let's think again. Let me write ψ as a column vector: a = 0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2.

So ψ = [a; b] = [0.5; sqrt(3)/2].

Then, ψ† σx ψ = a b* + a* b. Since a and b are real in this case, it's just 2 a b.

So a = 0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2.

So a * b = (0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2) ) = sqrt(3)/4 ≈ 0.4330.

Wait, but wait, ψ† σx ψ = a b + a b = 2ab. Or wait, no, because σx is the matrix [[0,1],[1,0]], so when you compute ψ† σx ψ, it's (a, b) * [[0,1],[1,0]] * [a; b] = (a*0 + b*1) * a + (a*1 + b*0) * b? No, wait, perhaps matrix multiplication is better.

Wait, let's compute it step by step. σx times ψ is [[0,1],[1,0]] [a; b] = [b; a]. Then ψ† (which is [a, b]) multiplied by that gives [a, b] [b; a] = a*b + b*a. Since a and b are real, this is 2ab.

So yes, the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is 2ab.

So a = 0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2.

So 2 * 0.5 * (sqrt(3)/2) = (2 * 0.5) is 1, multiplied by (sqrt(3)/2) is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but that's the same result as before. So I think my initial calculation was correct.

So putting it all together:

The expectation value of 10σz +5σx is 10*(-0.5) +5*(sqrt(3)/2) = -5 + (5 * 0.8660) ≈ -5 + 4.3301 ≈ -0.6699.

Hmm, but wait, let's compute that exactly. Let me compute 5*(sqrt(3)/2). Since sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205, so 1.73205/2 is about 0.866025. Multiply by 5 gives 4.330125.

Then, adding to the 10σz part: -5 +4.330125= approximately -0.669875.

So the expectation value is approximately -0.67, which would round to -0.7 when rounded to one decimal place.

Wait, but the options are A) -1.4, B)1.65, C)-0.7, D)0.85.

So the correct answer is option C, which is -0.7.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, |ψ⟩ = 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2) |↓⟩.

Compute probabilities: |0.5|²=0.25, |sqrt(3)/2|²= (3/4)=0.75. So that's correct.

⟨σz⟩=(0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1)=0.25 -0.75=-0.5. Correct.

⟨σx⟩=2ab= 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2)= (2 * 0.5) * (sqrt(3)/2 )= 1*(sqrt(3)/2) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.8660.

Then, 10*(-0.5)=-5; 5*(sqrt(3)/2)=≈4.3301. Sum is -5 +4.3301= -0.6699≈-0.67, which rounds to -0.7.

So the answer should be option C, -0.7.

I think that's correct. So the correct option is C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given state \( \psi = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_z \) are \( +1 \) for \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( -1 \) for \( |\downarrow\rangle \). The probabilities of measuring \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) are given by the squared magnitudes of the coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), respectively:

\[
P(|\uparrow\rangle) = |0.5|^2 = 0.25, \quad P(|\downarrow\rangle) = \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75.
\]

Thus, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is given by:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2ab,
\]

where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) are the coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), respectively. Substituting these values:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2(0.5)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866).
\]

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is approximately \( -0.7 \).

The correct option is:

**C) -0.7**

So yes, the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is 2ab.

So a = 0.5, b = sqrt(3)/2.

\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( \sigma_z \) are \( +1 \) for \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( -1 \) for \( |\downarrow\rangle \). The probabilities of measuring \( +1 \) and \( -1 \) are given by the squared magnitudes of the coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), respectively:

\[
P(|\uparrow\rangle) = |0.5|^2 = 0.25, \quad P(|\downarrow\rangle) = \left|\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right|^2 = 0.75.
\]

Thus, the expectation value of \( \sigma_z \) is:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is given by:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2ab,
\]

where \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) are the coefficients of \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \), respectively. Substituting these values:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 2(0.5)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The expectation value of \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is:

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866).
\]

\[
\langle 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \rangle = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the expectation value is approximately \( -0.7 \).
