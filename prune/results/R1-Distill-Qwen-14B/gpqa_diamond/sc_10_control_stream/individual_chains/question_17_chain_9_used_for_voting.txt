Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calcium ions and EDTA complexes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the concentration of the Ca-EDTA complex is 0.02 M. They're asking for the concentration of free calcium ions in the solution. Oh right, EDTA forms complexes with metal ions, so the calcium is bound up in the complex, which means the free calcium concentration is going to be really low.

Wait, the formula for the complex dissociation might be helpful. I remember that when a complex ion dissociates, the formation constant (K) is involved. The formation constant is the equilibrium constant for the formation of the complex. So the reaction would be Ca²+ + EDTA^4- ↔ CaEDTA^2-. The K for this reaction is given as 5x10^10, which is a pretty large number, meaning the complex is very stable and doesn't dissociate much.

But wait, I think I should write the expression for K. The formation constant Kf is equal to [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). So the formula is K = [complex]/([M][L]), where M is the metal ion and L is the ligand.

In this case, the concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. Let's denote the concentration of the complex as C, so C = 0.02 M. At equilibrium, the concentration of the complex is approximately 0.02 M since it's a stoichiometric solution, and dissociation is minimal. So [CaEDTA] ≈ 0.02 M.

Let me think about the dissociation. The complex can dissociate into Ca²+ and EDTA. But since K is so large (5e10), the dissociation is minimal, so [Ca²+] will be very small. Let's set up the equation.

K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]). But wait, in the solution, the EDTA is mostly tied up in the complex. Let me assume that the initial concentration of EDTA is the same as the Ca-EDTA complex because it's a stoichiometric solution. So, when you mix Ca²+ and EDTA in a 1:1 ratio, you form the complex CaEDTA²-.

But if the initial concentrations are both 0.02 M, but after forming the complex, most of it is tied up. So, let me think in terms of the dissociation. Let x be the concentration of Ca²+ ions that dissociate. So, [Ca²+] = x, and [EDTA] = x as well? Wait, no, because each complex that dissociates releases one Ca²+ and one EDTA^4-.

Wait, the initial concentration of the complex is 0.02 M. So, the initial [CaEDTA] is 0.02 M, and [Ca²+] and [EDTA] are zero. But as it dissociates, each mole of complex gives one mole of Ca²+ and one mole of EDTA. So, when some x amount dissociates, the concentrations will be:

[CaEDTA] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 (since x is very small)
[Ca²+] = x
[EDTA] = x

So plugging into the K expression:

K = (0.02) / (x * x) = 5e10

So, 0.02/(x²) = 5e10 → x² = 0.02/(5e10) → x² = 2e-13 → x = sqrt(2e-13) ≈ 1.414e-6. Wait, that's about 1.4e-6 M. Hmm, but none of the options are around that. Let me check the options again.

The options are:
A) 2e-2
B)5e-3
C)6.3e-7
D)1e-2

Wait, none of these are 1.4e-6. Did I make a mistake? Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, K is 5e10. So:

x² = 0.02 / 5e10 → 0.02 is 2e-2. So 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13.

Wait, x² = 4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) → 2e-6.5? Wait, wait, 4e-13 is (2e-6.5)^2? Wait, sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5? No, let me compute it correctly.

Square root of 4 is 2, square root of 1e-13 is 1e-6.5? Wait, 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. Wait, 1e-6 squared is 1e-12, so 1e-13 is (1e-6.5)^2. So sqrt(4e-13) is 2e-6.5 M. Wait, but 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7 → 2e-6.5 is 6.32e-7. Oh wait, that's about 6.3e-7 M, which matches option C.

So x is approximately 6.3e-7 M. So the concentration of calcium ions is 6.3e-7 M. So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through it again.

The equation is K = [CaEDTA]/([Ca²+][EDTA]) → 5e10 = (0.02)/x² → x² = 0.02/(5e10) → 0.02 is 2e-2 → 2e-2 /5e10 = (2/5) * 1e-12 = 0.4e-12 → 4e-13 → x^2 =4e-13 → x = sqrt(4e-13) = 2e-6.5 → 2e-6.5 is 2 * 10^(-6.5). Let me compute 10^(-6.5): that's 10^(-6) * 10^(-0.5). 10^(-0.5) is about 0.316. So 1e-6.5 is approximately 3.16e-7. So 2 times that is 6.32e-7, which is approximately 6.3e-7 M. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is option C.

To determine the concentration of free calcium ions in a solution containing 0.02 M Ca-EDTA complex, we use the dissociation equilibrium of the complex:

\[
\text{Ca}^{2+} + \text{EDTA}^{4-} \leftrightarrow \text{CaEDTA}^{2-}
\]

The formation constant is given as \( K = 5 \times 10^{10} \), and the concentration of the complex is \( [\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] = 0.02 \, \text{M} \). Let \( x \) represent the concentration of dissociated \(\text{Ca}^{2+}\) and \(\text{EDTA}^{4-}\) ions. At equilibrium:

\[
[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}] \approx 0.02 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{Ca}^{2+}] = x, \quad [\text{EDTA}^{4-}] = x
\]

The equilibrium expression is:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{CaEDTA}^{2-}]}{[\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{EDTA}^{4-}]}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5 \times 10^{10} = \frac{0.02}{x^2}
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = \frac{0.02}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2 \times 10^{-2}}{5 \times 10^{10}} = \frac{2}{5} \times 10^{-12} = 0.4 \times 10^{-12} = 4 \times 10^{-13}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{4 \times 10^{-13}} = 2 \times 10^{-6.5} \approx 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M}
\]

Thus, the concentration of free calcium ions is approximately \( 6.3 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to option C.
