Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think about what I know. The question gives me two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

Wait, so equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo, right? Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4), where T_s is the star's effective temperature, R_s is its radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance.

But wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo. So the albedo term cancels out when taking the ratio. That's good, so I don't have to worry about that part.

The tricky part is finding the orbital distances of the two planets. Oh, right, the question mentions both the transit and radial velocity methods. The RV method gives the mass of the planet, but also the semi-major axis (which is the distance here since the orbits are circular). The transit method gives the radius of the planet, which we can use to find the distance from the star, but wait no, transit gives the radius of the planet and the star. Oh, but I think the RV method is used here for the Doppler shift, which depends on the mass and the distance.

Wait, the RV method gives the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is K = (v) = (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 year in seconds) ) )^(1/3) Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the RV shift given. Oh, wait the problem says the RV shifts are given in terms of Ångströms. So the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which is related to the velocity of the star caused by the planet's orbit.

The Doppler shift delta lambda over lambda is approximately equal to the velocity v over c. So delta lambda / lambda = v/c. But wait, I think the formula is (delta lambda)/lambda = (v * sin i)/c. Since both planets are in the same system, their inclination i is probably the same. But the problem doesn't specify, so I guess I can assume sin i is the same for both planets, or maybe it cancels out when taking the ratio.

Wait, the problem states that both planets induce a periodic shift in the same forbidden line. The line is at 6300 Å, so lambda is 6300 Å. For Planet1, the shift is up to 0.03 Å, and for Planet2, it's 0.04 Å. So delta_lambda1 = 0.03, delta_lambda2=0.04. So their velocities can be found by v = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c.

Wait, let me recall the Doppler shift formula. The radial velocity (v) is given by v = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c. But wait, delta_lambda is the change in wavelength, so it's the shift. So for each planet, I can find their velocities.

But the RV method also relates to the mass and orbital distance. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (v) ) = ( (2 pi G) / P )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ), but since M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So approximately, K ≈ ( (2 pi G ) / (P) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )^(1/3) ) Hmm, maybe it's easier to equate the velocities from the RV shifts and the RV formula.

Alternatively, since I'm looking for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures, which depends on the inverse square root of the distance (since T scales with (L/(16 pi sigma a^2))^(1/4), and L is proportional to R^2 T^4), maybe I can find the ratio of the distances a1 and a2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula again: T_p = T_s * sqrt( R_s / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 ). Since albedo is same, I can ignore that. So T_p is proportional to sqrt( R_s / a ). So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_s/(a1)) / (R_s/(a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt(a2/a1 ). So I need to find a2/a1.

But to get a, I need to get the distance of each planet from the star. How can I get the distance from the RV data? The RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is related to the mass of the planet and the distance. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e^2)^(1/2) )) ) ) * (1 / ( ( ( (a * (1 + m/M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) ) ) )

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation between the RV semi-amplitude and the orbital distance. The formula I found online (but I'm trying to remember) is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/( (P/(2 pi))^(1/3) )) )

Wait, maybe that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the velocities from the RV shifts, and then relate that to the ratio of the semi-major axes.

Wait, the RV shift delta_lambda is 0.03 for Planet1 and 0.04 for Planet2. So the velocity of the star for Planet1 is v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c, and v2 = (0.04 /6300) * c. Let me compute these velocities.

But since c is the same for both, when taking the ratio v2/v1 it cancels out. So v2 = (0.04/6300) * c, v1 = (0.03/6300) * c. So v2/v1 = (0.04/0.03) = 4/3 ≈ 1.333.

Now, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / a^(1/2), because from the velocity formula, K = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )) ), but since P is the orbital period, which is related to a by Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M_star + M_p) ) ). Since M_p is much less than M_star, P^2 ≈ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ). So P ≈ ( (4 pi^2 a^3)/( G M_star ) )^(1/2 ). Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, the RV amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( 1/ ( (a (1 - e^2) ) ) ) )^(1/2) ) Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of the radial velocity semi-amplitude formula.

The correct formula is K = (v) = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( P^(1/3) ) ) ) ) * (1 / (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) )

But since e is zero (because orbits are circular), so that term is 1. And M_p is much less than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ (2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( P^(1/3) )) )

But P is the orbital period, which is related to a via Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G M_star ). So P = [ (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G M_star) ]^(1/2 )

Plugging that into the K formula:

K = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * [ ( G M_star ) / (4 pi^2 a^3 ) ) ]^(1/6 )

Simplify:

Let me compute the exponents:

(2 pi G )^(1/3) = (2 pi)^(1/3) * G^(1/3)

[ ( G M_star ) / (4 pi^2 a^3 ) ) ]^(1/6 ) = (G M_star)^(1/6) ) / (4 pi^2 )^(1/6) a^(3/6) )

So combining the terms:

K = (2 pi)^(1/3) G^(1/3) * M_p sin i / M_star^(2/3) * (G M_star )^(1/6) ) / (4 pi^2 )^(1/6) a^(1/2 )

Hmm, let's collect like terms.

G terms: G^(1/3) * G^(1/6) = G^(1/2)
M_star terms: M_star^(1/6) / M_star^(2/3) = M_star^( (1/6 -4/6) )= M_star^(-3/6)= M_star^(-1/2)
M_p term: M_p
a term: a^(-1/2)
Constants: (2 pi)^(1/3) / (4 pi^2 )^(1/6 )

Let me compute the constants:

(2 pi)^(1/3) = 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3)
(4 pi^2 )^(1/6 ) = (4)^(1/6) (pi^2 )^(1/6 ) = 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 )

So the constants become (2^(1/3) pi^(1/3)) ) / (2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) ) ) = 1.

So K = M_p * ( G^(1/2) ) * M_star^(-1/2) ) * a^(-1/2 )

Wait, that's K = ( M_p / ( M_star )^(1/2) ) * sqrt( G ) / sqrt(a )

But let me write it as:

K = (M_p sin i) / sqrt( a ) * sqrt( G / M_star )

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently.

Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( P^(1/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )

Given that e = 0, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

Using Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3) / ( G M_star ), so P^(1/3 ) = [ (4 pi^2 a^3 ) / ( G M_star ) ]^(1/6 )

Substituting into K:

K = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( ( G M_star ) / (4 pi^2 a^3 ) )^(1/6 )

Simplify exponents:

(2 pi G )^(1/3) = 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) G^(1/3)

( G M_star )^(1/6 ) = G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6 )

(4 pi^2 )^(1/6 ) = (2^2 pi^2 )^(1/6 )= 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 )

So putting it all together:

K = [2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) G^(1/3)] * [M_p sin i] / [ M_star^(2/3) ] * [ G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) ] / [ 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) a^(1/2 ) ]

Simplify:

2^(1/3) / 2^(1/3) = 1.

pi^(1/3) / pi^(1/3) = 1.

G^(1/3) * G^(1/6 )= G^(1/2 )

M_star^(1/6) / M_star^(2/3) = M_star^( - (2/3 -1/6 )) = M_star^( - 1/2 )

So,

K = ( G^(1/2) M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(1/2 ) a^(1/2 ) )

Which simplifies to:

K = ( M_p sin i ) / sqrt( a ) * sqrt( G / M_star )

Wait, perhaps that's correct. So K is proportional to M_p / sqrt(a). So K1 = ( M1 sin i )/ sqrt( a1 ), and K2 = ( M2 sin i ) / sqrt( a2 )

But the problem gives the Doppler shifts as 0.03 and 0.04 Å for Planet1 and Planet2. So the velocities are v1 = (0.03 /6300 ) * c, v2 = (0.04 /6300 ) * c.

So K1 = v1, K2 = v2.

Therefore, K1 / K2 = v1 / v2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75.

But from the formula, K1/K2 = [ (M1 sin i) / sqrt(a1) ] / [ (M2 sin i) / sqrt(a2) ) ] = ( M1 / M2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because sin i is the same for both planets (same system, same inclination angle i), so sin i cancels.

So,

K1/K2 = ( M1 / M2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

We have K1/K2 = 0.75.

M1 is 7 Earth masses, M2 is 5 Earth masses. So M1/M2 = 7/5 = 1.4.

So,

0.75 = 1.4 * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Divide both sides by 1.4:

sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 0.75 / 1.4 ≈ 0.5357

Square both sides:

a2 / a1 ≈ (0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.287.

So, a2 ≈ 0.287 a1.

Wait, that can't be right because the planet with a higher shift (Planet2) would have a higher velocity, implying a closer orbit (since K is inversely proportional to sqrt(a)). Because a smaller a would lead to a higher K, as K = v = (M_p / sqrt(a)) * ... So if K2 > K1, then a2 < a1.

So yes, a2 is approximately 0.287 a1.

But wait, let me compute 0.5357 squared.

0.5357^2: 0.5 * 0.5 is 0.25, 0.5357 is a bit more. Let's compute it accurately.

0.5357 * 0.5357:

0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25

0.5 * 0.0357 = 0.01785

0.0357 * 0.5 = 0.01785

0.0357 *0.0357 ≈ 0.00127

Add them up:

0.25 + 0.01785 + 0.01785 + 0.00127 ≈ 0.25 + 0.0357 + 0.00127 ≈ 0.28697 ≈ 0.287.

So yes, a2/a1 ≈ 0.287.

But wait, the equilibrium temperature depends on sqrt(R_s/(2a)), right? So T_p is proportional to sqrt( R_s / a )

So T1 ∝ sqrt( (R_s) / a1 ), T2 ∝ sqrt( R_s / a2 )

So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( ( R_s/(a1) ) / ( R_s/(a2) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 /a1 ) = sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

Wait, but wait, I thought the ratio would be sqrt(a2/a1 ), but a2 is 0.287 a1, so a2/a1=0.287. So sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

So T1 is about 0.536 times T2. So the ratio T1/T2 is approximately 0.536.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53.

So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.53, so the answer should be option C.

To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start with the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_p = T_s \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{2a}} \left(1 - \text{albedo}\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo, the albedo term cancels out when taking the ratio. Thus, the equilibrium temperature ratio depends on the orbital distances \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) of the two planets:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

The orbital distances are determined using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to the planet's mass and inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

The problem provides the RV-induced Doppler shifts for both planets. For Planet1, the shift is \(0.03 \, \text{Å}\), and for Planet2, it is \(0.04 \, \text{Å}\). Since the shifts are proportional to the velocities of the star, the ratio of the velocities is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75
\]

Using the proportionality \(K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a}}\), we can write:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_1 / \sqrt{a_1}}{M_2 / \sqrt{a_2}} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Substituting \(M_1 = 7 \, M_\text{Earth}\) and \(M_2 = 5 \, M_\text{Earth}\), we find:

\[
0.75 = \frac{7}{5} \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{0.75}{1.4} \approx 0.5357
\]

Square both sides:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 0.287
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \approx \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately \(0.53\), which corresponds to option C.

Okay, so I've got this question about planets and their equilibrium temperatures. Hmm, let me think about what I know. The question gives me two planets orbiting a star, and I need to find the ratio of their equilibrium temperatures.

Wait, so equilibrium temperature is related to the star's luminosity, the planet's distance from the star, and the planet's albedo, right? Oh right, the formula for equilibrium temperature is something like T_p = T_s * sqrt(R_s/(2a)) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4), where T_s is the star's effective temperature, R_s is its radius, and a is the planet's orbital distance.

But wait, the question says both planets have the same albedo. So the albedo term cancels out when taking the ratio. That's good, so I don't have to worry about that part.

The tricky part is finding the orbital distances of the two planets. Oh, right, the question mentions both the transit and radial velocity methods. The RV method gives the mass of the planet, but also the semi-major axis (which is the distance here since the orbits are circular). The transit method gives the radius of the planet, which we can use to find the distance from the star, but wait no, transit gives the radius of the planet and the star. Oh, but I think the RV method is used here for the Doppler shift, which depends on the mass and the distance.

Wait, the RV method gives the velocity of the star due to the planet's orbit. The formula for the RV semi-amplitude K is K = (v) = (G * (M_planet) * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_planet)^(1/3) * (1 year in seconds) ) )^(1/3) Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the RV shift given. Oh, wait the problem says the RV shifts are given in terms of Ångströms. So the RV method measures the Doppler shift, which is related to the velocity of the star caused by the planet's orbit.

The Doppler shift delta lambda over lambda is approximately equal to the velocity v over c. So delta lambda / lambda = v/c. But wait, I think the formula is (delta lambda)/lambda = (v * sin i)/c. Since both planets are in the same system, their inclination i is probably the same. But the problem doesn't specify, so I guess I can assume sin i is the same for both planets, or maybe it cancels out when taking the ratio.

Wait, the problem states that both planets induce a periodic shift in the same forbidden line. The line is at 6300 Å, so lambda is 6300 Å. For Planet1, the shift is up to 0.03 Å, and for Planet2, it's 0.04 Å. So delta_lambda1 = 0.03, delta_lambda2=0.04. So their velocities can be found by v = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c.

Wait, let me recall the Doppler shift formula. The radial velocity (v) is given by v = (delta_lambda / lambda) * c. But wait, delta_lambda is the change in wavelength, so it's the shift. So for each planet, I can find their velocities.

But the RV method also relates to the mass and orbital distance. The RV semi-amplitude K is given by K = ( (v) ) = ( (2 pi G) / P )^(1/3) * (M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) ) ), but since M_p is much less than M_star, M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So approximately, K ≈ ( (2 pi G ) / (P) )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) )^(1/3) ) Hmm, maybe it's easier to equate the velocities from the RV shifts and the RV formula.

Alternatively, since I'm looking for the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures, which depends on the inverse square root of the distance (since T scales with (L/(16 pi sigma a^2))^(1/4), and L is proportional to R^2 T^4), maybe I can find the ratio of the distances a1 and a2.

Wait, equilibrium temperature formula again: T_p = T_s * sqrt( R_s / (2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^(1/4 ). Since albedo is same, I can ignore that. So T_p is proportional to sqrt( R_s / a ). So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( (R_s/(a1)) / (R_s/(a2)) ) ) = sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = sqrt(a2/a1 ). So I need to find a2/a1.

But to get a, I need to get the distance of each planet from the star. How can I get the distance from the RV data? The RV method gives the velocity semi-amplitude K, which is related to the mass of the planet and the distance. The formula for K is:

K = (v) = ( (G * M_p * sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) )^(1/3) ) * (1 / ( (1 - e^2)^(1/2) )) ) ) * (1 / ( ( ( (a * (1 + m/M_star) ) )^(1/3) ) ) ) )

Wait, perhaps I should use the relation between the RV semi-amplitude and the orbital distance. The formula I found online (but I'm trying to remember) is:

K = ( (27 * pi * G )^(1/3) ) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p)^(2/3) * (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/( (P/(2 pi))^(1/3) )) )

Wait, maybe that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the ratio of the velocities from the RV shifts, and then relate that to the ratio of the semi-major axes.

Wait, the RV shift delta_lambda is 0.03 for Planet1 and 0.04 for Planet2. So the velocity of the star for Planet1 is v1 = (0.03 / 6300) * c, and v2 = (0.04 /6300) * c. Let me compute these velocities.

But since c is the same for both, when taking the ratio v2/v1 it cancels out. So v2 = (0.04/6300) * c, v1 = (0.03/6300) * c. So v2/v1 = (0.04/0.03) = 4/3 ≈ 1.333.

Now, the RV semi-amplitude K is proportional to (M_p sin i) / a^(1/2), because from the velocity formula, K = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star)^(2/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) * (1/(P^(1/3)) )) ), but since P is the orbital period, which is related to a by Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G (M_star + M_p) ) ). Since M_p is much less than M_star, P^2 ≈ (4 pi^2 a^3 )/( G M_star ). So P ≈ ( (4 pi^2 a^3)/( G M_star ) )^(1/2 ). Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, the RV amplitude K is given by K = (v) = ( (G M_p sin i) / ( (M_star + M_p) ) ) )^(1/3) * ( 1/ ( (a (1 - e^2) ) ) ) )^(1/2) ) Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think of the radial velocity semi-amplitude formula.

The correct formula is K = (v) = ( (2 pi G )^(1/3) * M_p sin i ) / ( (M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( P^(1/3) ) ) ) ) * (1 / (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) )

But since e is zero (because orbits are circular), so that term is 1. And M_p is much less than M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star. So K ≈ (2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( P^(1/3) )) )

But P is the orbital period, which is related to a via Kepler's third law: P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G M_star ). So P = [ (4 pi^2 a^3) / (G M_star) ]^(1/2 )

Plugging that into the K formula:

K = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * [ ( G M_star ) / (4 pi^2 a^3 ) ) ]^(1/6 )

Simplify:

Let me compute the exponents:

(2 pi G )^(1/3) = (2 pi)^(1/3) * G^(1/3)

[ ( G M_star ) / (4 pi^2 a^3 ) ) ]^(1/6 ) = (G M_star)^(1/6) ) / (4 pi^2 )^(1/6) a^(3/6) )

So combining the terms:

K = (2 pi)^(1/3) G^(1/3) * M_p sin i / M_star^(2/3) * (G M_star )^(1/6) ) / (4 pi^2 )^(1/6) a^(1/2 )

Hmm, let's collect like terms.

G terms: G^(1/3) * G^(1/6) = G^(1/2)
M_star terms: M_star^(1/6) / M_star^(2/3) = M_star^( (1/6 -4/6) )= M_star^(-3/6)= M_star^(-1/2)
M_p term: M_p
a term: a^(-1/2)
Constants: (2 pi)^(1/3) / (4 pi^2 )^(1/6 )

Let me compute the constants:

(2 pi)^(1/3) = 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3)
(4 pi^2 )^(1/6 ) = (4)^(1/6) (pi^2 )^(1/6 ) = 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 )

So the constants become (2^(1/3) pi^(1/3)) ) / (2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) ) ) = 1.

So K = M_p * ( G^(1/2) ) * M_star^(-1/2) ) * a^(-1/2 )

Wait, that's K = ( M_p / ( M_star )^(1/2) ) * sqrt( G ) / sqrt(a )

But let me write it as:

K = (M_p sin i) / sqrt( a ) * sqrt( G / M_star )

Wait, but that seems a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps I should approach it differently.

Another approach: The RV semi-amplitude K is given by:

K = (v) = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( ( M_star + M_p )^(2/3) ) ) * (1 / ( P^(1/3) (1 - e^2)^(1/2) ) ) )

Given that e = 0, M_p << M_star, so M_star + M_p ≈ M_star.

Using Kepler's third law, P^2 = (4 pi^2 a^3) / ( G M_star ), so P^(1/3 ) = [ (4 pi^2 a^3 ) / ( G M_star ) ]^(1/6 )

Substituting into K:

K = (2 pi G )^(1/3) * ( M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(2/3) ) ) * ( ( G M_star ) / (4 pi^2 a^3 ) )^(1/6 )

Simplify exponents:

(2 pi G )^(1/3) = 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) G^(1/3)

( G M_star )^(1/6 ) = G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6 )

(4 pi^2 )^(1/6 ) = (2^2 pi^2 )^(1/6 )= 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3 )

So putting it all together:

K = [2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) G^(1/3)] * [M_p sin i] / [ M_star^(2/3) ] * [ G^(1/6) M_star^(1/6) ] / [ 2^(1/3) pi^(1/3) a^(1/2 ) ]

Simplify:

2^(1/3) / 2^(1/3) = 1.

pi^(1/3) / pi^(1/3) = 1.

G^(1/3) * G^(1/6 )= G^(1/2 )

M_star^(1/6) / M_star^(2/3) = M_star^( - (2/3 -1/6 )) = M_star^( - 1/2 )

So,

K = ( G^(1/2) M_p sin i ) / ( M_star^(1/2 ) a^(1/2 ) )

Which simplifies to:

K = ( M_p sin i ) / sqrt( a ) * sqrt( G / M_star )

Wait, perhaps that's correct. So K is proportional to M_p / sqrt(a). So K1 = ( M1 sin i )/ sqrt( a1 ), and K2 = ( M2 sin i ) / sqrt( a2 )

But the problem gives the Doppler shifts as 0.03 and 0.04 Å for Planet1 and Planet2. So the velocities are v1 = (0.03 /6300 ) * c, v2 = (0.04 /6300 ) * c.

So K1 = v1, K2 = v2.

Therefore, K1 / K2 = v1 / v2 = 0.03 / 0.04 = 3/4 = 0.75.

But from the formula, K1/K2 = [ (M1 sin i) / sqrt(a1) ] / [ (M2 sin i) / sqrt(a2) ) ] = ( M1 / M2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because sin i is the same for both planets (same system, same inclination angle i), so sin i cancels.

So,

K1/K2 = ( M1 / M2 ) * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

We have K1/K2 = 0.75.

M1 is 7 Earth masses, M2 is 5 Earth masses. So M1/M2 = 7/5 = 1.4.

So,

0.75 = 1.4 * sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Divide both sides by 1.4:

sqrt( a2 / a1 ) = 0.75 / 1.4 ≈ 0.5357

Square both sides:

a2 / a1 ≈ (0.5357)^2 ≈ 0.287.

So, a2 ≈ 0.287 a1.

Wait, that can't be right because the planet with a higher shift (Planet2) would have a higher velocity, implying a closer orbit (since K is inversely proportional to sqrt(a)). Because a smaller a would lead to a higher K, as K = v = (M_p / sqrt(a)) * ... So if K2 > K1, then a2 < a1.

So yes, a2 is approximately 0.287 a1.

But wait, let me compute 0.5357 squared.

0.5357^2: 0.5 * 0.5 is 0.25, 0.5357 is a bit more. Let's compute it accurately.

0.5357 * 0.5357:

0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25

0.5 * 0.0357 = 0.01785

0.0357 * 0.5 = 0.01785

0.0357 *0.0357 ≈ 0.00127

Add them up:

0.25 + 0.01785 + 0.01785 + 0.00127 ≈ 0.25 + 0.0357 + 0.00127 ≈ 0.28697 ≈ 0.287.

So yes, a2/a1 ≈ 0.287.

But wait, the equilibrium temperature depends on sqrt(R_s/(2a)), right? So T_p is proportional to sqrt( R_s / a )

So T1 ∝ sqrt( (R_s) / a1 ), T2 ∝ sqrt( R_s / a2 )

So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt( ( R_s/(a1) ) / ( R_s/(a2) ) ) ) = sqrt( a2 /a1 ) = sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

Wait, but wait, I thought the ratio would be sqrt(a2/a1 ), but a2 is 0.287 a1, so a2/a1=0.287. So sqrt(0.287) ≈ 0.536.

So T1 is about 0.536 times T2. So the ratio T1/T2 is approximately 0.536.

Looking at the options, option C is ~0.53.

So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately 0.53, so the answer should be option C.


To determine the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2, we start with the equilibrium temperature formula:

\[
T_p = T_s \sqrt{\frac{R_s}{2a}} \left(1 - \text{albedo}\right)^{1/4}
\]

Since both planets have the same albedo, the albedo term cancels out when taking the ratio. Thus, the equilibrium temperature ratio depends on the orbital distances \(a_1\) and \(a_2\) of the two planets:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

The orbital distances are determined using the radial velocity (RV) method. The RV semi-amplitude \(K\) is proportional to the planet's mass and inversely proportional to the square root of its orbital distance:

\[
K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a}}
\]

The problem provides the RV-induced Doppler shifts for both planets. For Planet1, the shift is \(0.03 \, \text{Å}\), and for Planet2, it is \(0.04 \, \text{Å}\). Since the shifts are proportional to the velocities of the star, the ratio of the velocities is:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{0.03}{0.04} = 0.75
\]

Using the proportionality \(K \propto \frac{M_p}{\sqrt{a}}\), we can write:

\[
\frac{K_1}{K_2} = \frac{M_1 / \sqrt{a_1}}{M_2 / \sqrt{a_2}} = \frac{M_1}{M_2} \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Substituting \(M_1 = 7 \, M_\text{Earth}\) and \(M_2 = 5 \, M_\text{Earth}\), we find:

\[
0.75 = \frac{7}{5} \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

Simplify:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} = \frac{0.75}{1.4} \approx 0.5357
\]

Square both sides:

\[
\frac{a_2}{a_1} \approx 0.287
\]

The equilibrium temperature ratio is:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \approx \sqrt{0.287} \approx 0.536
\]

Thus, the ratio of the equilibrium temperatures between Planet1 and Planet2 is approximately \(0.53\), which corresponds to option C.
