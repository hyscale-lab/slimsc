Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momentum states, right? The phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And the electrons are 50 MeV. I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) in partial wave analysis is given by a sum over the partial waves. The general formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l [ ... ] where k is the wave number, and the sum is over l from 0 to some maximum. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact form.

Oh right, the scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) [ e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l ] * (e^{iδ_l} - e^{-iδ_l}) / (1), wait no, maybe I'm mixing terms. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: I think the scattering amplitude can be written as f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) [e^{iδ_l} (sin δ_l)] / (1 + ... )? No, perhaps that's not it. Alternatively, the expression for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l times some spherical harmonics or Legendre polynomials. But since the question is about the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ=0.

Wait, when θ=0, the scattering is along the beam direction. The direction is along z-axis, I suppose. So the angular part for each term would involve P_l^0(cosθ), which for θ=0 becomes P_l^0(1) = 1 for all l. So each term then is just (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l.

So the amplitude f(0) would be (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l.

But wait, the imaginary part is what's being asked. Let me think about that. The amplitude f has a real and imaginary part. The imaginary part comes from the imaginary component of each term.

Wait, e^{iδ_l} is cosδ_l + i sinδ_l. So the term (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l would be (2l+1) [ cosδ_l sinδ_l + i sin^2 δ_l ].

So when you sum all these terms, the imaginary part is the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l, multiplied by i.

But the question is about the imaginary part of f(0), which is (1/k) times the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l multiplied by i. But wait, no, because the amplitude is f(0) = (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ].

Wait, more accurately, each term is (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l. So e^{iδ} sin δ = e^{iδ} (e^{iδ} - e^{-iδ}) / (2i) ) = [e^{2iδ} -1 ]/(2i). Hmm, but perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, let me compute the imaginary part of each term. The imaginary part of (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l. Let me factor this out.

e^{iδ} = cos δ + i sin δ. So e^{iδ} * sin δ = sin δ cos δ + i sin² δ.

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l +1) sin² δ_l.

So the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) times the sum of (2l +1) sin² δ_l multiplied by imaginary unit i? No, wait, f is a complex quantity, f = f_real + i f_imag. The imaginary part of f(0) would be the sum of the imaginary parts of each term, divided by k.

Wait, no, because each term is (2l+1) [ cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ ].

So when you add all terms, the imaginary part is (1/k) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Ah, right. Because each term contributes (2l+1) sin² δ_l as the imaginary part, and the sum across l is multiplied by 1/k.

So the imaginary part, Im f(0), is (1/k) * sum_{l}(2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Now, I need to compute this sum for l = 0,1,2,3,4, since those are the phase shifts given. The phase shifts for l beyond 4 are ignored.

So let's compute each term:

For l=0: 2(0)+1=1, sin δ0 = sin 90°=1. So term is 1*1^2=1.

l=1: 2(1)+1=3, sin 67° ≈ sin(67) ≈ 0.9205. So (3) * (0.9205)^2 → 3 * 0.8473 ≈ 2.5419.

l=2: 5 * sin^2(55°). sin(55)≈0.8192. So (0.8192)^2≈0.6710. 5 * 0.6710 ≈ 3.355.

l=3: 7 * sin^2(30°). sin(30)=0.5. Squared is 0.25. 7 * 0.25=1.75.

l=4: 9 * sin^2(13°). sin(13)≈0.22495. Squared is about 0.0506. So 9 * 0.0506≈0.4554.

Now sum all these up:

1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419.

3.5419 +3.355 ≈6.8969.

6.8969 +1.75 ≈8.6469.

8.6469 +0.4554 ≈9.1023.

So the sum is approximately 9.1023.

Now I need to find 1/k multiplied by this sum.

Wait, but what is k? The wave number k is given by the relation k = √(2mE) / ħ. But since E is given in MeV, I need to convert it into appropriate units.

But wait, I think there's a standard formula for k in terms of the electron mass and energy. Let me recall.

Electron rest mass m_e is about 0.511 MeV/c². The kinetic energy here is 50 MeV, but since the electrons are non-relativistic? Wait, 50 MeV is way higher than the rest mass. So relativistic effects are significant. Hmm, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can use the relativistic expression for k.

Wait, the momentum p is related to energy by E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So for E=50 MeV, m c²=0.511 MeV. So E² ≈ (pc)^2, so p ≈ E/c. So p = E/(c) ≈ 50 MeV/(c) → since p=ħk, so k = p/ħ = (50 MeV c^{-1}) / (ħ c) ) * (1/(c)) ) → Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with units.

Wait, let's calculate k in proper units. Let me think in terms of natural units where ħ=c=1.

In natural units, E = 50 MeV. The electron mass is 0.511 MeV. So E² = p² + m² → p = sqrt(E² - m²) ≈ sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2) ≈ 50 MeV. So p ≈ 50 MeV.

But in natural units, k = p/(ħ) → but since ħ is in units of MeV s, but I'm not sure about the exact conversion. Alternatively, perhaps I should convert E to eV, m to kg, and use the appropriate formula.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the relation k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ), but that's the non-relativistic approximation. Since E is much larger than m_e c², maybe relativistic is better, but perhaps the problem expects the non-relativistic approach.

Wait, no. Since the energy is 50 MeV, which is much higher than the rest mass, the non-relativistic approach wouldn't be valid. So perhaps I should use the relativistic formula.

Let me get the exact expression. The relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). So p = sqrt( E² - m² c^4 ) / c.

So k = p / ħ = [ sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c ] / ħ.

But to compute k, we need to express E and m in compatible units. Let me compute this step by step.

E is given as 50 MeV. m is the electron mass, 0.511 MeV/c².

So E = 50 MeV, m c² = 0.511 MeV.

Then p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV / c.

Since 50 is much larger than 0.511, p ≈ 50 MeV / c.

Then k = p / ħ. But how to compute this.

Let me recall that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm (since ħ ≈ 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV s, and c is speed of light in units of fm per second, but perhaps it's easier to use the value of ħ c in units of MeV fm.

Yes, ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, p ≈50 MeV/c → k = p/(ħ c) → because p = (ħ c) k.

Wait, no, because p = ħ k. So k = p / ħ.

But p is in units of MeV/c, ħ is in units of MeV s. So perhaps I should convert p into units of MeV/(c) multiplied by c to get MeV units.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute k in terms of fm^-1.

Let me think: p = ħ k → k = p / ħ.

p is in MeV/c. Let's compute p:

p = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2) ≈ 50 MeV/c.

So p ≈50 MeV/c.

Now, ħ is 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV s → which is 6.582 ×10^-25 × 1e9 eV s → 6.582e-16 eV s. Wait, but we need to express ħ in MeV s.

Since 1 MeV = 1e6 eV, so 6.582e-16 eV s = 6.582e-25 MeV s.

So, ħ = 6.582e-25 MeV s.

But I know that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm. So, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c.

But c in units of fm/s is approximately 3e15 fm/s.

Wait, perhaps an easier approach is to use the known value of ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So, p = 50 MeV/c → so k = p/(ħ c) * (ħ c) ) → wait, that might not make sense. Let me re-approach.

Wait, p = ħ k → k = p / ħ.

p in MeV/c → but ħ has units of MeV s. To get k in 1/fm, perhaps we can write:

p = (50 MeV) / (c) → but since ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm, so 1/(ħ c) is 1/(197.33 MeV fm).

Wait, let's compute k:

k = p / ħ = (50 MeV / c) / ( ħ )

But ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → so ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

Wait, substituting that into k:

k = [50 MeV / c ] / [ (197.33 MeV fm ) / c ] = 50 / 197.33 [ fm^{-1} ]

So k ≈ (50)/(197.33) fm^{-1}.

50 divided by 197.33 is approximately 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, let me compute that accurately.

50 / 197.33 = approximately 0.2531 fm⁻¹.

So now, the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l is approximately 9.1023 as calculated earlier.

So the imaginary part Im f(0) = (1/k) * sum → (1/0.2531 fm⁻¹) * 9.1023.

Wait, (1/k) would be 1 / (0.2531 fm⁻¹) ) → 1/0.2531 ≈ 3.95 fm.

So 3.95 fm * 9.1023 ≈ let's compute that.

3.95 *9 = 35.55; 3.95 *0.1023≈0.404 → total ≈35.95.

Wait, but 3.95 *9.1023:

3.95 *9 =35.55, 3.95 *0.1023≈0.404 → total about 35.954.

Wait, but another way: 3.95 *9.1023 ≈ (4 - 0.05) *9.1023 → 4*9.1023=36.4092 minus 0.05*9.1023=0.4551 → 36.4092-0.4551≈35.954.

So approximately 35.95 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me double-check. If 50 MeV is the kinetic energy, but earlier I used E=50 MeV as the total energy. Wait no, the problem states 50 MeV electrons. Hmm, whether that's kinetic energy or total energy?

Wait, when electrons are said to have 50 MeV, does that refer to kinetic energy (K) or total energy (E)? Because in particle physics, sometimes it's the kinetic energy, sometimes the total. For high energies, E ≈ K + m c^2 ≈ K, but let me think.

Wait, for an electron, if it's 50 MeV, I think it refers to kinetic energy. But in the calculation, I used E=50 MeV as the total energy, which would be K + m c^2. So perhaps I made a mistake there.

Wait, if the problem says 50 MeV electrons, that's their kinetic energy. So E = K + m c^2 = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈50.511 MeV. But since 50 is much bigger than 0.511, E is ~50 MeV. So my earlier calculation would still be approximately correct.

Wait, but perhaps I messed up the units for k. Let me recheck the calculation.

k = p / ħ.

p = sqrt( E² - m² ) / c → E=50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV.

But in energy units, ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm, so:

p = sqrt( (50 MeV)^2 - (0.511 MeV)^2 ) / c → approximately 50 MeV/c.

So k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / [ (197.33 MeV fm ) / c ] → since ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → ħ = 197.33 MeV fm / c.

Wait, so when I write k = p / ħ = [ (50 MeV/c) ] / [ (197.33 MeV fm ) / c ] → the c's cancel out.

So, (50 MeV/c) * (c) / (197.33 MeV fm ) → 50 / 197.33 fm^{-1} → ~0.253 fm^{-1}.

So that part is correct.

Then, Im f(0) = (1/k) * sum → 1/(0.253 fm^{-1}) ) * 9.1023 ≈ (3.95 fm) *9.1023 ≈35.95 fm.

But the options are in the hundreds of fm. Option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger. Hmm, did I miss a factor?

Wait, did I make a mistake in the sum? Let me recalculate the sum.

For each l:

l=0: 2l+1 =1, delta=90. sin^2(90)=1 → 1*1=1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67). Let me compute sin(67 degrees): approx 0.9205. Squared is 0.8473. 3 *0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55). Sin(55)=0.8192. Squared is 0.6710. 5*0.6710≈3.355.

l=3:7 * sin^2(30). 0.5^2=0.25. 7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin^2(13). Sin(13)=0.22495. Squared is 0.0506. 9 *0.0506≈0.4554.

Sum: 1 +2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023. So that's correct.

Hmm, so the sum is correct. Then why is my calculation giving ~35.95 fm, but the options are in the 100s?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait. The formula for the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is Im f(θ=0) = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

But I think I may have missed a factor. Because I think the correct expression is Im f(θ=0) = (1/k) * sum (2 l +1) sin δ_l. Because the term e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l = i sin^2 δ_l, which would mean the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l times (1/k) → which is what I did.

Hmm, then perhaps the k I calculated is wrong.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute k in terms of wavenumber.

The relation is k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ), where E is the kinetic energy.

Wait, but that's the non-relativistic expression. So for non-relativistic, E= (p²)/(2m).

But since E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than m_e c² (0.511 MeV), the non-relativistic approach isn't valid. But perhaps the problem expects me to use it regardless.

Wait, let me compute k using the non-relativistic formula.

E (kinetic) = (p²)/(2m) → p = sqrt(2 m E).

m is the electron mass, 9.109e-31 kg.

E is 50 MeV, which is 50e6 eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So E =50e6 *1.602e-19 J =8.01e-13 J.

m=9.109e-31 kg.

p= sqrt(2 * m * E ) → sqrt( 2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-13 J )

Compute inside the sqrt: 2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 ≈ 2 * 9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 → 2*9.109e-31=1.8218e-30; 1.8218e-30 *8.01e-13=1.46e-42.

So p= sqrt(1.46e-42) ≈ 3.82e-21 kg m/s.

Then, k = p/ħ → ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k = 3.82e-21 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈ 3.62e13 m^{-1}.

But 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so 1 fm^{-1} = 1e15 m^{-1}.

So k in fm^{-1}: 3.62e13 m^{-1} * (1e15 m^{-1}/fm^{-1}) ) → Wait, sorry, no.

Wait, 1 m^{-1} = 1e15 fm^{-1}.

So 3.62e13 m^{-1} =3.62e13 * 1e15 fm^{-1} = 3.62e28 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that can't be right; that's a huge number.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the units. Because 1 m = 1e15 fm → so 1 m^{-1} = 1e-15 fm^{-1}.

Ah, right. So 3.82e-21 kg m/s → p=3.82e-21 m/s kg.

Wait, but k is p/(ħ). So:

p=3.82e-21 kg m/s.

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s = 1.0545718e-34 kg m²/s.

So k = (3.82e-21 kg m/s) / (1.0545718e-34 kg m²/s) ) → 3.82e-21 / 1.0545718e-34 → approximately 3.62e13 m^{-1}.

Convert to fm^{-1}: since 1 m = 1e15 fm, 1 m^{-1} =1e-15 fm^{-1}.

So 3.62e13 m^{-1} =3.62e13 * 1e-15 fm^{-1} =3.62e-2 fm^{-1} → 0.0362 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that's different from the earlier value of 0.253 fm^{-1}.

But which approach is correct? Since the energy is 50 MeV, which is way beyond the non-relativistic domain, the non-relativistic formula is not applicable. So perhaps the relativistic approach is correct.

Wait, but according to the relativistic approach, I calculated k as ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

In the non-relativistic approach using kinetic energy, I get k≈0.036 fm^{-1}, which is much smaller. So which is correct?

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the non-relativistic approach, but that would lead to a much smaller k, which would lead to a much larger Im f(0) since Im f(0) is (1/k) * sum.

Wait, let me compute both possibilities.

First, using the relativistic approach (previous calculation):

k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

Im f(0)= (1/k)* sum → (1/0.253) *9.1023 ≈35.95 fm.

But the options don't have 35.95. The closest is option B, which is 355.351 fm. Hmm, that's about 10 times larger.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the sum of (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l?

Wait, let me recompute:

l=0: 1 *1=1.

l=1:3*(sin67)^2=3*(approx 0.8473)=2.5419.

l=2:5*(sin55)^2=5*(0.6710)=3.355.

l=3:7*(0.25)=1.75.

l=4:9*(0.0506)=0.4554.

Sum: 1+2.5419=3.5419; +3.355=6.8969; +1.75=8.6469; +0.4554=9.1023.

So the sum is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is Im f = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, instead of sin² δ_l.

Wait, that would change things. Let me think again.

Wait, e^{iδ} sin δ = sin δ ( cos δ + i sin δ ) = sin δ cos δ + i sin² δ.

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Yes, so the earlier approach is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me try another approach.

What's the value of ħ c in units of MeV fm? It's about 197.33 MeV fm.

The momentum p is ħ k → so k = p/(ħ).

But p = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) /c → since E is the total energy.

So E=50 MeV → 50 MeV = (pc)² + (0.511 MeV)^2 → so pc ≈50 MeV.

So p = 50 MeV/c.

Then, k = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ c) → since ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

So 50 MeV/c divided by 197.33 MeV fm → (50/197.33) fm^{-1} → ~0.253 fm^{-1}.

So that's correct.

So Im f(0) = (1/0.253) *9.1023 ≈35.95 fm.

But the options don't have that. Wait, what other possibilities are there?

Oh! Wait a second. The problem says "ignore the rest of the phase shifts," which in this case, we have l=0 to 4. So the sum is correct.

Is there any other factor I'm missing? For instance, perhaps the amplitude is f = (1/k) sum ... , but the question asks for the imaginary part, which would be in units of fm.

Wait, but perhaps the actual formula for scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) ]

So when θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0)= (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ]

The imaginary part is (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ].

Wait, no: e^{iδ} sin δ = i sin^2 δ + sin δ cos δ.

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin² δ.

Wait, but then why isn't the result matching any of the options?

Looking again, the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, the only option near 35.95 is none. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should have used E=50 MeV as the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let's try that.

If E is the kinetic energy (K), then the total energy E_total = K + m c² =50 + 0.511 ≈50.511 MeV.

But that won't change the calculation much.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for k is 2mE/(ħ^2), but that's the non-relativistic expression.

Wait, non-relativistic: E = p^2/(2m) → p= sqrt(2mE) → k = p/ħ = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

m is electron mass, which is 9.109e-31 kg.

E=50 MeV =50e6 eV =50e6 *1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.

So 2mE = 2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-13 J = 1.46e-42 kg m²/s².

sqrt(2mE)=sqrt(1.46e-42)=1.208e-21 kg m/s.

k= 1.208e-21 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈1.145e13 m^{-1}.

Convert to fm^{-1}: 1 m^{-1}=1e-15 fm^{-1} → so 1.145e13 m^{-1} =1.145e13 *1e-15 fm^{-1} =1.145e-2 fm^{-1} ≈0.01145 fm^{-1}.

So Im f(0)= (1/k) * sum → 1/(0.01145 fm^{-1}) ) *9.1023 ≈87.3 fm.

But that's not matching any option either. Option C is 177.675 fm, which is about double.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sum. Let me recompute the sum again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term more accurately.

For l=0: 1 * sin^2(90) →1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67). Let me compute sin(67°) accurately.

Using calculator: sin(67°) ≈0.92050485345.

So sin²= (0.9205)^2=0.84731.

3 *0.84731=2.54193.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55°). Sin(55)=0.81915204428.

Squared: 0.67101.

5 *0.67101=3.35505.

l=3:7 * sin²(30)=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin²(13). Sin(13)=0.2249510543.

Squared: 0.224951^2≈0.05061.

9 *0.05061=0.45549.

Now sum: 1 +2.54193=3.54193 +3.35505=6.89698 +1.75=8.64698 +0.45549=9.10247.

So sum ≈9.1025.

So using non-relativistic approach for k=0.01145 fm⁻¹:

Im f(0)= (1/0.01145) *9.1025 ≈87.34 fm.

Hmm, so that's about 87.3 fm. But option A is 87163 fm, which is way larger. No, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the imaginary part is (1/k) times the sum multiplied by something else.

Wait, another thought: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the optical theorem and the total cross-section. But perhaps that's more advanced than needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be Im f(θ=0) = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / k.

But then the sum would be sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, let me compute that:

l=0: 1 * sin(90)=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 *0.81915=4.09575.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

So sum is 1 + 2.7615=3.7615 +4.09575=7.85725 +3.5=11.35725 +2.02455=13.3818.

Then, Im f(0)=(1/k)*13.3818.

If k is 0.253 fm⁻¹: 13.3818 /0.253≈52.89 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, but what if the sum is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, and k is in the denominator. Then, if k is small, the value would be larger.

But none of the options match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/k) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So, using the relativistic k=0.253 fm⁻¹ → Im f(0)=13.3818/0.253 ≈52.89 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, without dividing by k.

But that would make Im f(0) = 13.3818, which is nowhere near the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (something else).

Wait, perhaps I should check what the correct formula is.

After checking, I recall that in partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ,φ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l (cosθ) e^{i (2l) φ}.

Assuming the target is spinless and the scattering is symmetric in φ, the average over φ would give a factor, but for the purpose of this problem, since we're looking along the beam direction (θ=0), and ignoring phase factors, perhaps the imaginary part is as I initially thought.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would give:

sum=13.3818 → k=0.253.

So Im f(0)=13.3818 /0.253 ≈52.89 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l (without square).

Which would give the 52.89 fm, but that's not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/k) multiplied by sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Which would give 35.95 fm, but again not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different definition where the imaginary part is multiplied by 2 or something.

Alternative approach: Look for a possible mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that l starts from 0, so the terms are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but no, the question gives them in degrees.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) times the sum of (2l +1) sin δ_l, which is 13.3818.

Then, 13.3818 /0.253 ≈52.89 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is correct, giving ~35.95 fm, which is close to 35.355, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given for l=0 to l=4, but in the sum, I have to include all l up to the maximum given. Oh, wait, yes, that's what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by an additional factor, like 2 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f = (1/(2k)) sum.

No, I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) / (2k).

But then, 13.3818/(2*0.253)≈26.44 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the imaginary part in terms of the scattering amplitude, but in the given units, it's cross-section or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, and then multiply by something else.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Previous sum was 13.3818.

If I compute (1/k) * sum =13.3818 /0.253 ≈52.89 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the sum is 9.1025 and k is 0.253, giving Im f=35.95 fm. But again, options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the units are in 1/fm instead of fm? No, that wouldn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recompute k using relativistic approach.

E=50 MeV.

p= sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 ) / c.

E=50 MeV, m c^2 =0.511 MeV.

p = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) MeV/c ≈50 MeV/c.

k= p/(ħ c) → since ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So, k= (50 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm ) → 50/(197.33) → 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use 2mE for the non-relativistic approach, but that gives a much smaller k, leading to a larger Im f(0), but the options are even larger than that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the sum again, but I don't see any mistake there.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula is Im f = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would be 13.3818 /0.253 ≈52.89 fm. But none of the options match. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using the scattering amplitude's relation to the cross-section. The cross-section is |f|^2, but that's for the total cross-section.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the imaginary part of the amplitude multiplied by something else, like 4π or so. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic expression for k and get Im f≈35.95 fm, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are in radians instead of degrees. Wait, the question states they're given in degrees. So that's not the issue.

Wait, another thing: The formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Wait, but when θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

The imaginary part is (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So that part is correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. None of my calculations match the options.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option B is 355.351 fm. 355 is about 10 times 35.5. Did I make a mistake in the sum by a factor of 10?

Wait, perhaps the units for k are in inverse meters instead of inverse femtometers. Let me check.

Wait, no. Because when I computed k, I used 1 fm⁻¹ = 1e15 m⁻¹. So if I made a mistake in converting units, perhaps I multiplied by 1e15 instead of 1e-15.

Wait, let me re-calculate k in non-relativistic approach, but correctly convert units.

k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ).

E=50 MeV. Let me convert E to Joules: 50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV =8.01e-13 J.

m=9.109e-31 kg.

2mE=2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-13 J → 2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 → approximately 1.46e-43 kg m²/s².

sqrt(2mE)=sqrt(1.46e-43) ≈1.208e-21 kg m/s.

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k = p/ħ = 1.208e-21 /1.0545718e-34 ≈1.145e13 m^{-1}.

Convert to fm^{-1}: since 1 m =1e15 fm → 1 m^{-1}=1e-15 fm^{-1}.

So 1.145e13 m^{-1} =1.145e13 *1e-15 fm^{-1} =1.145e-2 fm^{-1} → 0.01145 fm^{-1}.

So Im f(0) = (1/0.01145) *9.1025 ≈87.34 fm.

Hmm, again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum again.

Wait, another possibility: The formula for the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) multiplied by some factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the total cross-section, which is σ_total = 4π |f|^2. But that's a real quantity, not the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the sum. Let me compute each term numerically more accurately.

Compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin²(90) =1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin²(67) → sin(67) = 0.92050485345.

Squared: 0.8473105.

3 *0.8473105=2.5419315.

l=2:5 * sin²(55). Sin(55)=0.81915204428.

Squared: 0.6710077.

5 *0.6710077=3.3550385.

l=3:7 * sin²(30)=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin²(13). Sin(13)=0.2249510543.

Squared: 0.0506106.

9 *0.0506106=0.4554954.

Sum: 1 + 2.5419315=3.5419315 +3.3550385=6.89697 +1.75=8.64697 +0.4554954=9.1024654.

So sum is approximately 9.102465.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to include higher phase shifts or consider something else. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options.

Wait, looking at the options again: option B is 355.351 fm.

Wait, 355.351 is approximately 9.102465 *39.03 (since 9.102465 *39≈355).

Wait, 355.351/9.102465≈38.998 ≈39.

So 39 times the sum. But why 39?

Hmm, perhaps I should multiply by 4π or something else. But I don't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ) * ħ c / (2 m E).

Wait, since ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So (9.102465) * (197.33 MeV fm ) / (2 *50 MeV ) → 9.102465 *197.33/(100) → 9.102465 *1.9733≈17.97 fm.

Hmm, that's option C: 177.675 fm, which is about 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I should multiply by another factor.

Wait, 9.102465 * (197.33/(50)) → 9.102465 *3.9466 → ≈35.94 fm.

Which matches my initial calculation. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but the closest is option B: 355.351 fm.

Wait, 355.351 /35.95 ≈9.88. So about 10 times.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me check once more.

Wait, using E=50 MeV as total energy, non-relativistic approach gives k≈0.01145 fm⁻¹.

Im f(0)=9.102465 /0.01145≈87.34 fm.

But option A is 87163.4 fm, which is way larger, but maybe I missed a factor of 1e3 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the unit conversion for k. Let me recompute.

k = p / ħ.

p=50 MeV/c.

Convert p to kg m/s.

1 MeV =1.602e-13 J.

So p=50e6 *1.602e-13 J / c.

c=3e8 m/s.

So p=50e6 *1.602e-13 /3e8 → 50e6 =5e7 → 5e7 *1.602e-13 =8.01e-6 → 8.01e-6 /3e8 → 2.67e-14 kg m/s.

Then, ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k= p/ħ =2.67e-14 /1.0545718e-34 ≈2.53e20 m^{-1}.

Convert to fm^{-1}: 1 m=1e15 fm → 1 m^{-1}=1e-15 fm^{-1}.

So 2.53e20 m^{-1} =2.53e20 *1e-15 fm^{-1}=2.53e5 fm^{-1}.

Im f(0)= sum /k →9.102465 /2.53e5 ≈3.595e-5 fm.

Which is 0.00003595 fm, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating p.

Wait, p= sqrt(2mE) → non-relativistic approach.

E=50 MeV =50e6 eV =50e6 *1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.

m=9.109e-31 kg.

p= sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 ) → sqrt(1.458e-43) → ~1.207e-21 kg m/s.

k= p/ħ =1.207e-21 /1.0545718e-34≈1.144e13 m^{-1}.

Convert to fm^{-1}: 1e13 m^{-1}=1e13 *1e-15 fm^{-1}=1e-2 fm^{-1}.

So k=0.01144 fm^{-1}.

Im f(0)= sum /k →9.102465 /0.01144≈800 fm.

Wait, 9.102465 /0.01144 → let me compute that.

9.102465 /0.01144 → approximately 800. (Because 0.01144 *800=9.152, which is close to 9.102465.)

So that would give Im f(0)=800 fm, but the closest option is A: 87163.4 fm, which is way larger.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. I think I made a mistake somewhere, but I can't see where. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C: 177.675 fm.

But according to my calculations, I'm getting approximately 35.95 fm, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are given for each partial wave, and each contributes (2l+1) sin δ_l to the imaginary part.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula is Im f(0) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / k.

But using the relativistic k=0.253 fm⁻¹.

Sum is 13.3818 → 13.3818 /0.253≈52.89 fm. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer to be option D: 251.271 fm.

Wait, 251.271 is approximately 2π times 40, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is 9.1025 and 9.1025 * (1/0.253) * π → 35.95 *3.14≈112.8, still not matching.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the initial approach, the correct answer should be approximately 35.95 fm, which isn't an option. But perhaps the intended answer is option B, 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger. Maybe I missed a factor of 10 in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me check once more.

Wait, using E=50 MeV as the kinetic energy, non-relativistic approach:

E = (p^2)/(2m) → p= sqrt(2mE).

m=9.109e-31 kg.

E=50e6 eV=50e6 *1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.

p= sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 ) → sqrt(1.458e-43)=1.207e-21 kg m/s.

k=p/ħ=1.207e-21 /1.0545718e-34≈1.144e13 m^{-1}.

Convert to fm^{-1}: 1e13 m^{-1}=1e13 *1e-15 fm^{-1}=1e-2 fm^{-1}.

So k=0.01144 fm^{-1}.

Im f(0)= sum /k=9.102465 /0.01144≈800 fm.

Hmm, but the only option close is A:87163.4 fm, which is way larger. I think I'm missing something, but I can't figure it out. Given that, I'll have to go with the initial calculation and perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but based on the options provided, the closest might be option B: 355.351 fm.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction using the given phase shifts and the energy of the electrons. The scattering amplitude in partial wave analysis is expressed as:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l + 1) e^{i\delta_l} \sin\delta_l,
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number, and the sum is over the partial waves \( l \). For the imaginary part of \( f(0) \), we focus on the contributions from \( \sin^2\delta_l \), as the imaginary part of \( e^{i\delta_l} \sin\delta_l \) is proportional to \( \sin^2\delta_l \). Thus, the imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is given by:

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l + 1) \sin^2\delta_l.
\]

### Step 1: Compute the sum of \( (2l + 1) \sin^2\delta_l \)
The phase shifts provided are \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \) and \( \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). For each \( l \), we calculate \( (2l + 1) \sin^2\delta_l \):

- \( l = 0 \): \( (2(0) + 1) \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)
- \( l = 1 \): \( (2(1) + 1) \sin^2(67^\circ) \approx 3 \cdot (0.9205)^2 \approx 3 \cdot 0.8473 = 2.5419 \)
- \( l = 2 \): \( (2(2) + 1) \sin^2(55^\circ) \approx 5 \cdot (0.8192)^2 \approx 5 \cdot 0.6710 = 3.355 \)
- \( l = 3 \): \( (2(3) + 1) \sin^2(30^\circ) \approx 7 \cdot (0.5)^2 = 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75 \)
- \( l = 4 \): \( (2(4) + 1) \sin^2(13^\circ) \approx 9 \cdot (0.22495)^2 \approx 9 \cdot 0.0506 = 0.4554 \)

Summing these contributions:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) \sin^2\delta_l = 1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1023.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the wave number \( k \)
The wave number \( k \) is related to the momentum \( p \) by \( k = p / \hbar \). For relativistic electrons, the total energy \( E \) is related to the momentum \( p \) by:

\[
E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4.
\]

Given \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), we approximate \( p \approx 50 \, \text{MeV}/c \) since \( E \gg m \). Using \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV} \cdot \text{fm} \), we compute:

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar c} = \frac{50}{197.33} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \text{Im } f(0) \)
Substituting the sum and \( k \) into the formula for \( \text{Im } f(0) \):

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) \sin^2\delta_l = \frac{1}{0.253} \cdot 9.1023 \approx 35.95 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
The calculated value of \( \text{Im } f(0) \approx 35.95 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **B) 355.351 fm**, which is approximately 10 times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy suggests a possible error in the problem setup or interpretation, but based on the given options, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: B**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about elastic scattering of electrons from a nuclear target. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me phase shifts for different angular momentum states, right? The phase shifts are δ₀=90°, δ₁=67°, δ₂=55°, δ₃=30°, and δ₄=13°. And the electrons are 50 MeV. I need to find the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction.

Wait, I remember that the scattering amplitude f(θ) in partial wave analysis is given by a sum over the partial waves. The general formula is something like f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l [ ... ] where k is the wave number, and the sum is over l from 0 to some maximum. But I'm not entirely sure about the exact form.

Oh right, the scattering amplitude in terms of partial waves is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) [ e^{2iδ_l} sin δ_l ] * (e^{iδ_l} - e^{-iδ_l}) / (1), wait no, maybe I'm mixing terms. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: I think the scattering amplitude can be written as f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) [e^{iδ_l} (sin δ_l)] / (1 + ... )? No, perhaps that's not it. Alternatively, the expression for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l times some spherical harmonics or Legendre polynomials. But since the question is about the imaginary part along the incident direction, which is θ=0.

Wait, when θ=0, the scattering is along the beam direction. The direction is along z-axis, I suppose. So the angular part for each term would involve P_l^0(cosθ), which for θ=0 becomes P_l^0(1) = 1 for all l. So each term then is just (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l.

So the amplitude f(0) would be (1/k) Σ (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l.

But wait, the imaginary part is what's being asked. Let me think about that. The amplitude f has a real and imaginary part. The imaginary part comes from the imaginary component of each term.

Wait, e^{iδ_l} is cosδ_l + i sinδ_l. So the term (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sinδ_l would be (2l+1) [ cosδ_l sinδ_l + i sin^2 δ_l ].

So when you sum all these terms, the imaginary part is the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l, multiplied by i.

But the question is about the imaginary part of f(0), which is (1/k) times the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l multiplied by i. But wait, no, because the amplitude is f(0) = (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ].

Wait, more accurately, each term is (2l + 1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l. So e^{iδ} sin δ = e^{iδ} (e^{iδ} - e^{-iδ}) / (2i) ) = [e^{2iδ} -1 ]/(2i). Hmm, but perhaps that's complicating things.

Alternatively, let me compute the imaginary part of each term. The imaginary part of (2l +1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l. Let me factor this out.

e^{iδ} = cos δ + i sin δ. So e^{iδ} * sin δ = sin δ cos δ + i sin² δ.

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l +1) sin² δ_l.

So the imaginary part of f(0) is (1/k) times the sum of (2l +1) sin² δ_l multiplied by imaginary unit i? No, wait, f is a complex quantity, f = f_real + i f_imag. The imaginary part of f(0) would be the sum of the imaginary parts of each term, divided by k.

Wait, no, because each term is (2l+1) [ cos δ sin δ + i sin² δ ].

So when you add all terms, the imaginary part is (1/k) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Ah, right. Because each term contributes (2l+1) sin² δ_l as the imaginary part, and the sum across l is multiplied by 1/k.

So the imaginary part, Im f(0), is (1/k) * sum_{l}(2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Now, I need to compute this sum for l = 0,1,2,3,4, since those are the phase shifts given. The phase shifts for l beyond 4 are ignored.

So let's compute each term:

For l=0: 2(0)+1=1, sin δ0 = sin 90°=1. So term is 1*1^2=1.

l=1: 2(1)+1=3, sin 67° ≈ sin(67) ≈ 0.9205. So (3) * (0.9205)^2 → 3 * 0.8473 ≈ 2.5419.

l=2: 5 * sin^2(55°). sin(55)≈0.8192. So (0.8192)^2≈0.6710. 5 * 0.6710 ≈ 3.355.

l=3: 7 * sin^2(30°). sin(30)=0.5. Squared is 0.25. 7 * 0.25=1.75.

l=4: 9 * sin^2(13°). sin(13)≈0.22495. Squared is about 0.0506. So 9 * 0.0506≈0.4554.

Now sum all these up:

1 + 2.5419 = 3.5419.

3.5419 +3.355 ≈6.8969.

6.8969 +1.75 ≈8.6469.

8.6469 +0.4554 ≈9.1023.

So the sum is approximately 9.1023.

Now I need to find 1/k multiplied by this sum.

Wait, but what is k? The wave number k is given by the relation k = √(2mE) / ħ. But since E is given in MeV, I need to convert it into appropriate units.

But wait, I think there's a standard formula for k in terms of the electron mass and energy. Let me recall.

Electron rest mass m_e is about 0.511 MeV/c². The kinetic energy here is 50 MeV, but since the electrons are non-relativistic? Wait, 50 MeV is way higher than the rest mass. So relativistic effects are significant. Hmm, but for the purpose of this problem, perhaps we can use the relativistic expression for k.

Wait, the momentum p is related to energy by E² = (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2. So for E=50 MeV, m c²=0.511 MeV. So E² ≈ (pc)^2, so p ≈ E/c. So p = E/(c) ≈ 50 MeV/(c) → since p=ħk, so k = p/ħ = (50 MeV c^{-1}) / (ħ c) ) * (1/(c)) ) → Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused with units.

Wait, let's calculate k in proper units. Let me think in terms of natural units where ħ=c=1.

In natural units, E = 50 MeV. The electron mass is 0.511 MeV. So E² = p² + m² → p = sqrt(E² - m²) ≈ sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2) ≈ 50 MeV. So p ≈ 50 MeV.

But in natural units, k = p/(ħ) → but since ħ is in units of MeV s, but I'm not sure about the exact conversion. Alternatively, perhaps I should convert E to eV, m to kg, and use the appropriate formula.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the relation k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ), but that's the non-relativistic approximation. Since E is much larger than m_e c², maybe relativistic is better, but perhaps the problem expects the non-relativistic approach.

Wait, no. Since the energy is 50 MeV, which is much higher than the rest mass, the non-relativistic approach wouldn't be valid. So perhaps I should use the relativistic formula.

Let me get the exact expression. The relativistic energy is E = sqrt( (pc)^2 + (m c²)^2 ). So p = sqrt( E² - m² c^4 ) / c.

So k = p / ħ = [ sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c ] / ħ.

But to compute k, we need to express E and m in compatible units. Let me compute this step by step.

E is given as 50 MeV. m is the electron mass, 0.511 MeV/c².

So E = 50 MeV, m c² = 0.511 MeV.

Then p = sqrt( E² - (m c²)^2 ) / c = sqrt( (50)^2 - (0.511)^2 ) MeV / c.

Since 50 is much larger than 0.511, p ≈ 50 MeV / c.

Then k = p / ħ. But how to compute this.

Let me recall that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm (since ħ ≈ 6.582 ×10^-25 GeV s, and c is speed of light in units of fm per second, but perhaps it's easier to use the value of ħ c in units of MeV fm.

Yes, ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm.

So, p ≈50 MeV/c → k = p/(ħ c) → because p = (ħ c) k.

Wait, no, because p = ħ k. So k = p / ħ.

But p is in units of MeV/c, ħ is in units of MeV s. So perhaps I should convert p into units of MeV/(c) multiplied by c to get MeV units.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute k in terms of fm^-1.

Let me think: p = ħ k → k = p / ħ.

p is in MeV/c. Let's compute p:

p = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2) ≈ 50 MeV/c.

So p ≈50 MeV/c.

Now, ħ is 6.582 × 10^-25 GeV s → which is 6.582 ×10^-25 × 1e9 eV s → 6.582e-16 eV s. Wait, but we need to express ħ in MeV s.

Since 1 MeV = 1e6 eV, so 6.582e-16 eV s = 6.582e-25 MeV s.

So, ħ = 6.582e-25 MeV s.

But I know that ħ c ≈ 197.33 MeV fm. So, ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → ħ = (197.33 MeV fm ) / c.

But c in units of fm/s is approximately 3e15 fm/s.

Wait, perhaps an easier approach is to use the known value of ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm.

So, p = 50 MeV/c → so k = p/(ħ c) * (ħ c) ) → wait, that might not make sense. Let me re-approach.

Wait, p = ħ k → k = p / ħ.

p in MeV/c → but ħ has units of MeV s. To get k in 1/fm, perhaps we can write:

p = (50 MeV) / (c) → but since ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm, so 1/(ħ c) is 1/(197.33 MeV fm).

Wait, let's compute k:

k = p / ħ = (50 MeV / c) / ( ħ )

But ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → so ħ = (197.33 MeV fm) / c.

Wait, substituting that into k:

k = [50 MeV / c ] / [ (197.33 MeV fm ) / c ] = 50 / 197.33 [ fm^{-1} ]

So k ≈ (50)/(197.33) fm^{-1}.

50 divided by 197.33 is approximately 0.253 fm^{-1}.

So k ≈ 0.253 fm^{-1}.

Wait, let me compute that accurately.

50 / 197.33 = approximately 0.2531 fm⁻¹.

So now, the sum of (2l+1) sin² δ_l is approximately 9.1023 as calculated earlier.

So the imaginary part Im f(0) = (1/k) * sum → (1/0.2531 fm⁻¹) * 9.1023.

Wait, (1/k) would be 1 / (0.2531 fm⁻¹) ) → 1/0.2531 ≈ 3.95 fm.

So 3.95 fm * 9.1023 ≈ let's compute that.

3.95 *9 = 35.55; 3.95 *0.1023≈0.404 → total ≈35.95.

Wait, but 3.95 *9.1023:

3.95 *9 =35.55, 3.95 *0.1023≈0.404 → total about 35.954.

Wait, but another way: 3.95 *9.1023 ≈ (4 - 0.05) *9.1023 → 4*9.1023=36.4092 minus 0.05*9.1023=0.4551 → 36.4092-0.4551≈35.954.

So approximately 35.95 fm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let me double-check. If 50 MeV is the kinetic energy, but earlier I used E=50 MeV as the total energy. Wait no, the problem states 50 MeV electrons. Hmm, whether that's kinetic energy or total energy?

Wait, when electrons are said to have 50 MeV, does that refer to kinetic energy (K) or total energy (E)? Because in particle physics, sometimes it's the kinetic energy, sometimes the total. For high energies, E ≈ K + m c^2 ≈ K, but let me think.

Wait, for an electron, if it's 50 MeV, I think it refers to kinetic energy. But in the calculation, I used E=50 MeV as the total energy, which would be K + m c^2. So perhaps I made a mistake there.

Wait, if the problem says 50 MeV electrons, that's their kinetic energy. So E = K + m c^2 = 50 MeV + 0.511 MeV ≈50.511 MeV. But since 50 is much bigger than 0.511, E is ~50 MeV. So my earlier calculation would still be approximately correct.

Wait, but perhaps I messed up the units for k. Let me recheck the calculation.

k = p / ħ.

p = sqrt( E² - m² ) / c → E=50 MeV, m=0.511 MeV.

But in energy units, ħ c is 197.33 MeV fm, so:

p = sqrt( (50 MeV)^2 - (0.511 MeV)^2 ) / c → approximately 50 MeV/c.

So k = p / ħ = (50 MeV/c) / [ (197.33 MeV fm ) / c ] → since ħ c = 197.33 MeV fm → ħ = 197.33 MeV fm / c.

Wait, so when I write k = p / ħ = [ (50 MeV/c) ] / [ (197.33 MeV fm ) / c ] → the c's cancel out.

So, (50 MeV/c) * (c) / (197.33 MeV fm ) → 50 / 197.33 fm^{-1} → ~0.253 fm^{-1}.

So that part is correct.

Then, Im f(0) = (1/k) * sum → 1/(0.253 fm^{-1}) ) * 9.1023 ≈ (3.95 fm) *9.1023 ≈35.95 fm.

But the options are in the hundreds of fm. Option B is 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger. Hmm, did I miss a factor?

Wait, did I make a mistake in the sum? Let me recalculate the sum.

For each l:

l=0: 2l+1 =1, delta=90. sin^2(90)=1 → 1*1=1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67). Let me compute sin(67 degrees): approx 0.9205. Squared is 0.8473. 3 *0.8473≈2.5419.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55). Sin(55)=0.8192. Squared is 0.6710. 5*0.6710≈3.355.

l=3:7 * sin^2(30). 0.5^2=0.25. 7 *0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin^2(13). Sin(13)=0.22495. Squared is 0.0506. 9 *0.0506≈0.4554.

Sum: 1 +2.5419=3.5419 +3.355=6.8969 +1.75=8.6469 +0.4554=9.1023. So that's correct.

Hmm, so the sum is correct. Then why is my calculation giving ~35.95 fm, but the options are in the 100s?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k. Let me recheck.

Wait, wait. The formula for the scattering amplitude's imaginary part is Im f(θ=0) = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

But I think I may have missed a factor. Because I think the correct expression is Im f(θ=0) = (1/k) * sum (2 l +1) sin δ_l. Because the term e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l = i sin^2 δ_l, which would mean the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l times (1/k) → which is what I did.

Hmm, then perhaps the k I calculated is wrong.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute k in terms of wavenumber.

The relation is k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ), where E is the kinetic energy.

Wait, but that's the non-relativistic expression. So for non-relativistic, E= (p²)/(2m).

But since E is 50 MeV, which is much larger than m_e c² (0.511 MeV), the non-relativistic approach isn't valid. But perhaps the problem expects me to use it regardless.

Wait, let me compute k using the non-relativistic formula.

E (kinetic) = (p²)/(2m) → p = sqrt(2 m E).

m is the electron mass, 9.109e-31 kg.

E is 50 MeV, which is 50e6 eV. 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So E =50e6 *1.602e-19 J =8.01e-13 J.

m=9.109e-31 kg.

p= sqrt(2 * m * E ) → sqrt( 2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-13 J )

Compute inside the sqrt: 2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 ≈ 2 * 9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 → 2*9.109e-31=1.8218e-30; 1.8218e-30 *8.01e-13=1.46e-42.

So p= sqrt(1.46e-42) ≈ 3.82e-21 kg m/s.

Then, k = p/ħ → ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k = 3.82e-21 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈ 3.62e13 m^{-1}.

But 1 fm is 1e-15 m, so 1 fm^{-1} = 1e15 m^{-1}.

So k in fm^{-1}: 3.62e13 m^{-1} * (1e15 m^{-1}/fm^{-1}) ) → Wait, sorry, no.

Wait, 1 m^{-1} = 1e15 fm^{-1}.

So 3.62e13 m^{-1} =3.62e13 * 1e15 fm^{-1} = 3.62e28 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that can't be right; that's a huge number.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up the units. Because 1 m = 1e15 fm → so 1 m^{-1} = 1e-15 fm^{-1}.

Ah, right. So 3.82e-21 kg m/s → p=3.82e-21 m/s kg.

Wait, but k is p/(ħ). So:

p=3.82e-21 kg m/s.

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s = 1.0545718e-34 kg m²/s.

So k = (3.82e-21 kg m/s) / (1.0545718e-34 kg m²/s) ) → 3.82e-21 / 1.0545718e-34 → approximately 3.62e13 m^{-1}.

Convert to fm^{-1}: since 1 m = 1e15 fm, 1 m^{-1} =1e-15 fm^{-1}.

So 3.62e13 m^{-1} =3.62e13 * 1e-15 fm^{-1} =3.62e-2 fm^{-1} → 0.0362 fm^{-1}.

Wait, that's different from the earlier value of 0.253 fm^{-1}.

But which approach is correct? Since the energy is 50 MeV, which is way beyond the non-relativistic domain, the non-relativistic formula is not applicable. So perhaps the relativistic approach is correct.

Wait, but according to the relativistic approach, I calculated k as ≈0.253 fm^{-1}.

In the non-relativistic approach using kinetic energy, I get k≈0.036 fm^{-1}, which is much smaller. So which is correct?

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the non-relativistic approach, but that would lead to a much smaller k, which would lead to a much larger Im f(0) since Im f(0) is (1/k) * sum.

Wait, let me compute both possibilities.

First, using the relativistic approach (previous calculation):

k=0.253 fm^{-1}.

Im f(0)= (1/k)* sum → (1/0.253) *9.1023 ≈35.95 fm.

But the options don't have 35.95. The closest is option B, which is 355.351 fm. Hmm, that's about 10 times larger.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the sum of (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l?

Wait, let me recompute:

l=0: 1 *1=1.

l=1:3*(sin67)^2=3*(approx 0.8473)=2.5419.

l=2:5*(sin55)^2=5*(0.6710)=3.355.

l=3:7*(0.25)=1.75.

l=4:9*(0.0506)=0.4554.

Sum: 1+2.5419=3.5419; +3.355=6.8969; +1.75=8.6469; +0.4554=9.1023.

So the sum is correct.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is Im f = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, instead of sin² δ_l.

Wait, that would change things. Let me think again.

Wait, e^{iδ} sin δ = sin δ ( cos δ + i sin δ ) = sin δ cos δ + i sin² δ.

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

Yes, so the earlier approach is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me try another approach.

What's the value of ħ c in units of MeV fm? It's about 197.33 MeV fm.

The momentum p is ħ k → so k = p/(ħ).

But p = sqrt( (E)^2 - (m c^2)^2 ) /c → since E is the total energy.

So E=50 MeV → 50 MeV = (pc)² + (0.511 MeV)^2 → so pc ≈50 MeV.

So p = 50 MeV/c.

Then, k = (50 MeV/c) / (ħ c) → since ħ c =197.33 MeV fm.

So 50 MeV/c divided by 197.33 MeV fm → (50/197.33) fm^{-1} → ~0.253 fm^{-1}.

So that's correct.

So Im f(0) = (1/0.253) *9.1023 ≈35.95 fm.

But the options don't have that. Wait, what other possibilities are there?

Oh! Wait a second. The problem says "ignore the rest of the phase shifts," which in this case, we have l=0 to 4. So the sum is correct.

Is there any other factor I'm missing? For instance, perhaps the amplitude is f = (1/k) sum ... , but the question asks for the imaginary part, which would be in units of fm.

Wait, but perhaps the actual formula for scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ) ]

So when θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0)= (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l ]

The imaginary part is (1/k) sum [ (2l+1) sin² δ_l ].

Wait, no: e^{iδ} sin δ = i sin^2 δ + sin δ cos δ.

So the imaginary part of each term is (2l+1) sin² δ.

Wait, but then why isn't the result matching any of the options?

Looking again, the options are:

A) 87163.4 fm

B) 355.351 fm

C) 177.675 fm

D) 251.271 fm

Hmm, the only option near 35.95 is none. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I should have used E=50 MeV as the kinetic energy, not the total energy. Let's try that.

If E is the kinetic energy (K), then the total energy E_total = K + m c² =50 + 0.511 ≈50.511 MeV.

But that won't change the calculation much.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for k is 2mE/(ħ^2), but that's the non-relativistic expression.

Wait, non-relativistic: E = p^2/(2m) → p= sqrt(2mE) → k = p/ħ = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

m is electron mass, which is 9.109e-31 kg.

E=50 MeV =50e6 eV =50e6 *1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.

So 2mE = 2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-13 J = 1.46e-42 kg m²/s².

sqrt(2mE)=sqrt(1.46e-42)=1.208e-21 kg m/s.

k= 1.208e-21 / 1.0545718e-34 ≈1.145e13 m^{-1}.

Convert to fm^{-1}: 1 m^{-1}=1e-15 fm^{-1} → so 1.145e13 m^{-1} =1.145e13 *1e-15 fm^{-1} =1.145e-2 fm^{-1} ≈0.01145 fm^{-1}.

So Im f(0)= (1/k) * sum → 1/(0.01145 fm^{-1}) ) *9.1023 ≈87.3 fm.

But that's not matching any option either. Option C is 177.675 fm, which is about double.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sum. Let me recompute the sum again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term more accurately.

For l=0: 1 * sin^2(90) →1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin^2(67). Let me compute sin(67°) accurately.

Using calculator: sin(67°) ≈0.92050485345.

So sin²= (0.9205)^2=0.84731.

3 *0.84731=2.54193.

l=2:5 * sin^2(55°). Sin(55)=0.81915204428.

Squared: 0.67101.

5 *0.67101=3.35505.

l=3:7 * sin²(30)=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin²(13). Sin(13)=0.2249510543.

Squared: 0.224951^2≈0.05061.

9 *0.05061=0.45549.

Now sum: 1 +2.54193=3.54193 +3.35505=6.89698 +1.75=8.64698 +0.45549=9.10247.

So sum ≈9.1025.

So using non-relativistic approach for k=0.01145 fm⁻¹:

Im f(0)= (1/0.01145) *9.1025 ≈87.34 fm.

Hmm, so that's about 87.3 fm. But option A is 87163 fm, which is way larger. No, that's not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the imaginary part is (1/k) times the sum multiplied by something else.

Wait, another thought: The imaginary part of the scattering amplitude is related to the optical theorem and the total cross-section. But perhaps that's more advanced than needed.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be Im f(θ=0) = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) / k.

But then the sum would be sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Wait, let me compute that:

l=0: 1 * sin(90)=1.

l=1:3 * sin(67)=3 *0.9205=2.7615.

l=2:5 * sin(55)=5 *0.81915=4.09575.

l=3:7 * sin(30)=7 *0.5=3.5.

l=4:9 * sin(13)=9 *0.22495≈2.02455.

So sum is 1 + 2.7615=3.7615 +4.09575=7.85725 +3.5=11.35725 +2.02455=13.3818.

Then, Im f(0)=(1/k)*13.3818.

If k is 0.253 fm⁻¹: 13.3818 /0.253≈52.89 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, but what if the sum is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, and k is in the denominator. Then, if k is small, the value would be larger.

But none of the options match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (1/k) multiplied by the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

So, using the relativistic k=0.253 fm⁻¹ → Im f(0)=13.3818/0.253 ≈52.89 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is sum (2l+1) sin δ_l, without dividing by k.

But that would make Im f(0) = 13.3818, which is nowhere near the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l ) * (something else).

Wait, perhaps I should check what the correct formula is.

After checking, I recall that in partial wave analysis, the scattering amplitude f is given by:

f(θ,φ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l (cosθ) e^{i (2l) φ}.

Assuming the target is spinless and the scattering is symmetric in φ, the average over φ would give a factor, but for the purpose of this problem, since we're looking along the beam direction (θ=0), and ignoring phase factors, perhaps the imaginary part is as I initially thought.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would give:

sum=13.3818 → k=0.253.

So Im f(0)=13.3818 /0.253 ≈52.89 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin δ_l (without square).

Which would give the 52.89 fm, but that's not in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (1/k) multiplied by sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l.

Which would give 35.95 fm, but again not matching.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different definition where the imaginary part is multiplied by 2 or something.

Alternative approach: Look for a possible mistake in the calculation of the sum.

Wait, perhaps I forgot that l starts from 0, so the terms are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the phase shifts are in radians, but no, the question gives them in degrees.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula for the imaginary part is (1/k) times the sum of (2l +1) sin δ_l, which is 13.3818.

Then, 13.3818 /0.253 ≈52.89 fm.

Still not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is correct, giving ~35.95 fm, which is close to 35.355, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the sum.

Wait, perhaps the phase shifts are given for l=0 to l=4, but in the sum, I have to include all l up to the maximum given. Oh, wait, yes, that's what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps I should multiply by an additional factor, like 2 or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f = (1/(2k)) sum.

No, I don't think so.

Wait, perhaps the formula is Im f = (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) / (2k).

But then, 13.3818/(2*0.253)≈26.44 fm.

Still not matching.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the imaginary part in terms of the scattering amplitude, but in the given units, it's cross-section or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l, and then multiply by something else.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute the sum of (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Previous sum was 13.3818.

If I compute (1/k) * sum =13.3818 /0.253 ≈52.89 fm.

Still not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the sum is 9.1025 and k is 0.253, giving Im f=35.95 fm. But again, options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the units are in 1/fm instead of fm? No, that wouldn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me recompute k using relativistic approach.

E=50 MeV.

p= sqrt( E^2 - (m c^2 )^2 ) / c.

E=50 MeV, m c^2 =0.511 MeV.

p = sqrt(50^2 - 0.511^2 ) MeV/c ≈50 MeV/c.

k= p/(ħ c) → since ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So, k= (50 MeV/c ) / (197.33 MeV fm ) → 50/(197.33) → 0.253 fm⁻¹.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use 2mE for the non-relativistic approach, but that gives a much smaller k, leading to a larger Im f(0), but the options are even larger than that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the sum again, but I don't see any mistake there.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the formula is Im f = (1/k) * sum (2l+1) sin δ_l.

Which would be 13.3818 /0.253 ≈52.89 fm. But none of the options match. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using the scattering amplitude's relation to the cross-section. The cross-section is |f|^2, but that's for the total cross-section.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the imaginary part of the amplitude multiplied by something else, like 4π or so. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the relativistic expression for k and get Im f≈35.95 fm, but that's not an option. So perhaps I'm missing a factor of 10 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the given phase shifts are in radians instead of degrees. Wait, the question states they're given in degrees. So that's not the issue.

Wait, another thing: The formula for the scattering amplitude is f(θ) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l P_l(cosθ).

Wait, but when θ=0, P_l(1)=1, so f(0) = (1/k) Σ (2l+1) e^{iδ_l} sin δ_l.

The imaginary part is (1/k) Σ (2l+1) sin² δ_l.

So that part is correct.

Hmm, I'm stuck. None of my calculations match the options.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option B is 355.351 fm. 355 is about 10 times 35.5. Did I make a mistake in the sum by a factor of 10?

Wait, perhaps the units for k are in inverse meters instead of inverse femtometers. Let me check.

Wait, no. Because when I computed k, I used 1 fm⁻¹ = 1e15 m⁻¹. So if I made a mistake in converting units, perhaps I multiplied by 1e15 instead of 1e-15.

Wait, let me re-calculate k in non-relativistic approach, but correctly convert units.

k = sqrt(2mE)/(ħ).

E=50 MeV. Let me convert E to Joules: 50e6 eV * 1.602e-19 J/eV =8.01e-13 J.

m=9.109e-31 kg.

2mE=2 *9.109e-31 kg *8.01e-13 J → 2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 → approximately 1.46e-43 kg m²/s².

sqrt(2mE)=sqrt(1.46e-43) ≈1.208e-21 kg m/s.

ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k = p/ħ = 1.208e-21 /1.0545718e-34 ≈1.145e13 m^{-1}.

Convert to fm^{-1}: since 1 m =1e15 fm → 1 m^{-1}=1e-15 fm^{-1}.

So 1.145e13 m^{-1} =1.145e13 *1e-15 fm^{-1} =1.145e-2 fm^{-1} → 0.01145 fm^{-1}.

So Im f(0) = (1/0.01145) *9.1025 ≈87.34 fm.

Hmm, again, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the sum again.

Wait, another possibility: The formula for the imaginary part is (sum (2l+1) sin δ_l) multiplied by some factor.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the total cross-section, which is σ_total = 4π |f|^2. But that's a real quantity, not the imaginary part.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the sum. Let me compute each term numerically more accurately.

Compute each term:

l=0: 1 * sin²(90) =1 *1=1.

l=1:3 * sin²(67) → sin(67) = 0.92050485345.

Squared: 0.8473105.

3 *0.8473105=2.5419315.

l=2:5 * sin²(55). Sin(55)=0.81915204428.

Squared: 0.6710077.

5 *0.6710077=3.3550385.

l=3:7 * sin²(30)=7*(0.5)^2=7*0.25=1.75.

l=4:9 * sin²(13). Sin(13)=0.2249510543.

Squared: 0.0506106.

9 *0.0506106=0.4554954.

Sum: 1 + 2.5419315=3.5419315 +3.3550385=6.89697 +1.75=8.64697 +0.4554954=9.1024654.

So sum is approximately 9.102465.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects me to include higher phase shifts or consider something else. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options.

Wait, looking at the options again: option B is 355.351 fm.

Wait, 355.351 is approximately 9.102465 *39.03 (since 9.102465 *39≈355).

Wait, 355.351/9.102465≈38.998 ≈39.

So 39 times the sum. But why 39?

Hmm, perhaps I should multiply by 4π or something else. But I don't see why.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Im f(0) = (sum (2l+1) sin^2 δ_l ) * ħ c / (2 m E).

Wait, since ħ c=197.33 MeV fm.

So (9.102465) * (197.33 MeV fm ) / (2 *50 MeV ) → 9.102465 *197.33/(100) → 9.102465 *1.9733≈17.97 fm.

Hmm, that's option C: 177.675 fm, which is about 10 times larger.

Wait, perhaps I should multiply by another factor.

Wait, 9.102465 * (197.33/(50)) → 9.102465 *3.9466 → ≈35.94 fm.

Which matches my initial calculation. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but the closest is option B: 355.351 fm.

Wait, 355.351 /35.95 ≈9.88. So about 10 times.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me check once more.

Wait, using E=50 MeV as total energy, non-relativistic approach gives k≈0.01145 fm⁻¹.

Im f(0)=9.102465 /0.01145≈87.34 fm.

But option A is 87163.4 fm, which is way larger, but maybe I missed a factor of 1e3 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the unit conversion for k. Let me recompute.

k = p / ħ.

p=50 MeV/c.

Convert p to kg m/s.

1 MeV =1.602e-13 J.

So p=50e6 *1.602e-13 J / c.

c=3e8 m/s.

So p=50e6 *1.602e-13 /3e8 → 50e6 =5e7 → 5e7 *1.602e-13 =8.01e-6 → 8.01e-6 /3e8 → 2.67e-14 kg m/s.

Then, ħ=1.0545718e-34 J s.

So k= p/ħ =2.67e-14 /1.0545718e-34 ≈2.53e20 m^{-1}.

Convert to fm^{-1}: 1 m=1e15 fm → 1 m^{-1}=1e-15 fm^{-1}.

So 2.53e20 m^{-1} =2.53e20 *1e-15 fm^{-1}=2.53e5 fm^{-1}.

Im f(0)= sum /k →9.102465 /2.53e5 ≈3.595e-5 fm.

Which is 0.00003595 fm, which doesn't match any options.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating p.

Wait, p= sqrt(2mE) → non-relativistic approach.

E=50 MeV =50e6 eV =50e6 *1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.

m=9.109e-31 kg.

p= sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 ) → sqrt(1.458e-43) → ~1.207e-21 kg m/s.

k= p/ħ =1.207e-21 /1.0545718e-34≈1.144e13 m^{-1}.

Convert to fm^{-1}: 1e13 m^{-1}=1e13 *1e-15 fm^{-1}=1e-2 fm^{-1}.

So k=0.01144 fm^{-1}.

Im f(0)= sum /k →9.102465 /0.01144≈800 fm.

Wait, 9.102465 /0.01144 → let me compute that.

9.102465 /0.01144 → approximately 800. (Because 0.01144 *800=9.152, which is close to 9.102465.)

So that would give Im f(0)=800 fm, but the closest option is A: 87163.4 fm, which is way larger.

Hmm, I'm really stuck. I think I made a mistake somewhere, but I can't see where. Given the options, perhaps the intended answer is option C: 177.675 fm.

But according to my calculations, I'm getting approximately 35.95 fm, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the phase shifts are given for each partial wave, and each contributes (2l+1) sin δ_l to the imaginary part.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula is Im f(0) = sum (2l+1) sin δ_l / k.

But using the relativistic k=0.253 fm⁻¹.

Sum is 13.3818 → 13.3818 /0.253≈52.89 fm. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer to be option D: 251.271 fm.

Wait, 251.271 is approximately 2π times 40, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is 9.1025 and 9.1025 * (1/0.253) * π → 35.95 *3.14≈112.8, still not matching.

I think I'm stuck. Based on the initial approach, the correct answer should be approximately 35.95 fm, which isn't an option. But perhaps the intended answer is option B, 355.351 fm, which is about 10 times larger. Maybe I missed a factor of 10 in the calculation of k.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of k. Let me check once more.

Wait, using E=50 MeV as the kinetic energy, non-relativistic approach:

E = (p^2)/(2m) → p= sqrt(2mE).

m=9.109e-31 kg.

E=50e6 eV=50e6 *1.602e-19 J=8.01e-13 J.

p= sqrt(2 *9.109e-31 *8.01e-13 ) → sqrt(1.458e-43)=1.207e-21 kg m/s.

k=p/ħ=1.207e-21 /1.0545718e-34≈1.144e13 m^{-1}.

Convert to fm^{-1}: 1e13 m^{-1}=1e13 *1e-15 fm^{-1}=1e-2 fm^{-1}.

So k=0.01144 fm^{-1}.

Im f(0)= sum /k=9.102465 /0.01144≈800 fm.

Hmm, but the only option close is A:87163.4 fm, which is way larger. I think I'm missing something, but I can't figure it out. Given that, I'll have to go with the initial calculation and perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but based on the options provided, the closest might be option B: 355.351 fm.


To solve the problem, we calculate the imaginary part of the scattering amplitude along the incident beam direction using the given phase shifts and the energy of the electrons. The scattering amplitude in partial wave analysis is expressed as:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l + 1) e^{i\delta_l} \sin\delta_l,
\]

where \( k \) is the wave number, and the sum is over the partial waves \( l \). For the imaginary part of \( f(0) \), we focus on the contributions from \( \sin^2\delta_l \), as the imaginary part of \( e^{i\delta_l} \sin\delta_l \) is proportional to \( \sin^2\delta_l \). Thus, the imaginary part of \( f(0) \) is given by:

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^{\infty} (2l + 1) \sin^2\delta_l.
\]

### Step 1: Compute the sum of \( (2l + 1) \sin^2\delta_l \)
The phase shifts provided are \( \delta_0 = 90^\circ, \delta_1 = 67^\circ, \delta_2 = 55^\circ, \delta_3 = 30^\circ, \) and \( \delta_4 = 13^\circ \). For each \( l \), we calculate \( (2l + 1) \sin^2\delta_l \):

- \( l = 0 \): \( (2(0) + 1) \sin^2(90^\circ) = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)
- \( l = 1 \): \( (2(1) + 1) \sin^2(67^\circ) \approx 3 \cdot (0.9205)^2 \approx 3 \cdot 0.8473 = 2.5419 \)
- \( l = 2 \): \( (2(2) + 1) \sin^2(55^\circ) \approx 5 \cdot (0.8192)^2 \approx 5 \cdot 0.6710 = 3.355 \)
- \( l = 3 \): \( (2(3) + 1) \sin^2(30^\circ) \approx 7 \cdot (0.5)^2 = 7 \cdot 0.25 = 1.75 \)
- \( l = 4 \): \( (2(4) + 1) \sin^2(13^\circ) \approx 9 \cdot (0.22495)^2 \approx 9 \cdot 0.0506 = 0.4554 \)

Summing these contributions:

\[
\sum_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) \sin^2\delta_l = 1 + 2.5419 + 3.355 + 1.75 + 0.4554 \approx 9.1023.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the wave number \( k \)
The wave number \( k \) is related to the momentum \( p \) by \( k = p / \hbar \). For relativistic electrons, the total energy \( E \) is related to the momentum \( p \) by:

\[
E^2 = p^2c^2 + m^2c^4.
\]

Given \( E = 50 \, \text{MeV} \) and \( m = 0.511 \, \text{MeV}/c^2 \), we approximate \( p \approx 50 \, \text{MeV}/c \) since \( E \gg m \). Using \( \hbar c \approx 197.33 \, \text{MeV} \cdot \text{fm} \), we compute:

\[
k = \frac{p}{\hbar c} = \frac{50}{197.33} \, \text{fm}^{-1} \approx 0.253 \, \text{fm}^{-1}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \text{Im } f(0) \)
Substituting the sum and \( k \) into the formula for \( \text{Im } f(0) \):

\[
\text{Im } f(0) = \frac{1}{k} \sum_{l=0}^4 (2l + 1) \sin^2\delta_l = \frac{1}{0.253} \cdot 9.1023 \approx 35.95 \, \text{fm}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the options
The calculated value of \( \text{Im } f(0) \approx 35.95 \, \text{fm} \) does not match any of the provided options. However, the closest option is **B) 355.351 fm**, which is approximately 10 times larger than the computed value. This discrepancy suggests a possible error in the problem setup or interpretation, but based on the given options, the most reasonable choice is:

**Answer: B**
