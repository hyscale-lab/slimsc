Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Alright, let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question says: 1-bromobenzene-2-d is treated with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia solvent. How many possible organic products are there in this reaction? The options are A)4, B)1, C)2, D)3.

Hmm, wait, what's 1-bromobenzene-2-d? Oh, wait, maybe it's a typo. I think it should be 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. Because 1-bromobenzene-2-d doesn't make much sense. Oh wait, no, another possibility: maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the "d" stands for something else. Oh, wait, maybe it's 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, which is a benzene ring with bromine at position 1 and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. Yes, that makes sense because the numbering would place Br at position 1, and methyl groups at 2 and 4.

So the structure is like a benzene ring where position 1 has Br, position 2 has a methyl, and position 4 has another methyl. So it's a 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene.

Now, the reaction is with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia. I remember that NaNH2 is a strong base, often used in dehydrohalogenation or elimination reactions. Wait, but in aromatic chemistry, NaNH2 is used for various deprotonations, maybe for elimination or substitution. Oh wait, I think when you have a benzene ring with substituents, especially activating groups, the base can deprotonate certain positions to form a benzyne intermediate.

Wait, another thought: in aromatic systems, especially when you have strong bases like NaNH2, and under conditions where elimination can occur, it's possible to form a benzene ring with a triple bond, like a benzyne. Let me think. So, if the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, and we treat it with NaNH2, which is a strong base, the reaction might proceed via elimination. 

So, the bromide leaves, but to eliminate, we need a beta hydrogen. Wait, but wait, 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene: in that structure, the bromine is at position 1, and methyl groups at 2 and 4. So, the adjacent carbons (ortho positions) to Br are positions 2 and 6. But position 2 already has a methyl group, so perhaps the hydrogen is at position 6?

Wait, but wait: the benzene ring is symmetric. Let me draw it mentally. Positions 1 is Br, 2 is methyl, 4 is methyl. So the structure is such that the ring is symmetric across the 1-4 axis. So, positions 2 and 6 are both adjacent to Br. Position 6 would have a hydrogen (since it's just a ring carbon without substituents unless there's another methyl there, but in the given molecule, it's only 2 and 4). So, the bromide is at position 1, and the methyl groups are at 2 and 4. So, the H at position 6 is a β-hydrogen. 

When NaNH2 is added, it abstracts a β-hydrogen, leading to the elimination of HBr and forming a triple bond between C1 and C2. Wait, but wait, if the H is at C6, elimination would give a triple bond between C1 and C6. Hmm, but that would form a triple bond between positions 1 and 2, but I'm not sure. Wait, maybe I need to think about the structure more clearly. 

Alternatively, perhaps the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 2 (but position 2 has a methyl group, so no H there) or from position 6. If position 6 has an H, then elimination would lead to a triple bond between C1 and C6. Then, the benzene becomes a triple bond between 1 and 6, making a benzyne intermediate.

Wait, but benzyne is a very reactive species. Once formed, it can undergo various reactions, but in this case, since we're just considering the products from the elimination, perhaps the main product is the benzyne. But wait, the question is asking for the number of possible organic products. So, how many products form from this reaction?

Alternatively, maybe the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form an alkyne. Wait, but benzene can't form an alkyne in that way. It would form a triple bond in the ring, making a benzyne. 

Wait, but wait, I think I'm confusing benzynes with other reactions. Let me recall: when a dihalide is treated with a strong base, it can eliminate two equivalents of HX to form a triple bond. But in this case, it's a mono-bromide. So perhaps elimination of HBr would form a double bond. Or wait, no, elimination would form a triple bond if two β-hydrogens are abstracted. Wait, perhaps that's the case. Wait, if only one H is eliminated, you get a double bond. But NaNH2 is a strong base that can deprotonate twice, leading to a triple bond. 

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't go through benzene but undergoes a substitution. Wait, but 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene has electron-donating methyl groups. So the ring is activated, which would make substitution reactions (like SNAr) easier. But NaNH2 is a base, not a nucleophile source. Wait, but in aromatic substitution, NaNH2 is sometimes used for elimination, not substitution. Also, the presence of a strong base might lead to elimination rather than substitution. 

Wait, another approach: when you have a bromobenzene derivative and treat it with a strong base like NaNH2, the reaction can lead to the formation of a benzene ring with a triple bond (benzyne) via elimination of two HBr molecules. But wait, in this case, the starting material is mono-brominated. So how can two HBr molecules be eliminated? That would require two bromine atoms on adjacent carbons. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the reaction. Another possibility is that the bromide leaves, and a deprotonation occurs to form a carbanion intermediate, which could then form a benzene ring with a negative charge, but that's not very stable. Alternatively, the base might abstract a proton adjacent to the Br, leading to the formation of a double bond (alkene) via elimination of HBr.

Wait, but benzyne is usually formed from 1,2-dihaloarenes. For example, 1,2-dibromobenzene treated with NaNH2 would eliminate two HBr to form the triple bond. But in this case, the molecule is mono-brominated. So maybe elimination is not possible, and another reaction occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a dehydrohalogenation to form a styrene-like compound. Wait, but that's an alkene. So, if I lose HBr, I would form a double bond between positions 1 and 2. But wait, the starting molecule has a methyl group at position 2, so if I eliminate a H from position 2, but position 2 already has a methyl, meaning no H to abstract. So, perhaps the H is abstracted from position 6, leading to a double bond between positions 1 and 6.

Wait, but position 6 is adjacent to position 1 (since benzene is a ring). So elimination would form a double bond between 1 and 6, but that's the same as between 1 and 2, because benzene is symmetric. So the product would be 1,2-dimethyl-1,3-diphenylethylene? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the product as a diene or an alkyne. Or perhaps the reaction is a substitution, but in that case, what would the nucleophile be? In NaNH2, the ammonia is a weak nucleophile, but the solvent is condensed ammonia, which is a good base. So maybe it's an elimination reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed because there's no adjacent hydrogen to eliminate. Wait, if the Br is at position 1, and the adjacent positions (2 and 6) have methyl and H respectively, then elimination would require abstracting a β-H from position 6. So, perhaps the product is a benzene ring with a double bond between 1 and 6, and methyl groups at 2 and 4.

Wait, but benzene is a six-membered ring, so if you have a double bond between 1 and 6, that's the same as a double bond between 1 and 2 in a different numbering system. So the resulting structure would have methyl groups at 2 and 4, and a double bond between 1 and 2. But wait, that's not possible because you can't have a double bond adjacent to a methyl group due to steric hindrance, but maybe it's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1,2-dimethyl-1,2-diphenylethylene? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possible elimination products. Since the starting material has Br at position 1 and methyl groups at 2 and 4, when elimination occurs, the Br leaves, and a hydrogen is abstracted from position 6. That would form a double bond between C1 and C6, which is equivalent to a double bond between C1 and C2 (since benzene is symmetric). So the product would be a benzene ring with a double bond between 1 and 2, and methyl groups at 2 and 4.

Wait, but that would make the double bond between 1 and 2, and a methyl at 2. So the structure would have a double bond adjacent to the methyl group, which is possible. So the product would be 1,2-dimethyl-1,2-diphenylethylene? Or maybe it's called 1,2-dimethylbenzene with a double bond. Wait, but benzene is already a ring with all double bonds. Hmm, no, wait, no. The product is a diene? Or is it a substituent with a double bond.

Wait, maybe another approach: when NaNH2 is used with a bromobenzene derivative, it can deprotonate the ring, leading to a carbanion which could eliminate Br-.

Wait, but let me think again about the structure. The starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So the positions are:

1: Br

2: CH3

3: H

4: CH3

5: H

6: H

So, the adjacent carbons to Br (position 1) are 2 and 6. Position 2 has a methyl, so no H to abstract. Position 6 has an H. So when the base (NaNH2) abstracts this H, it would form a carbanion at C6. Then, the Br leaves, leading to a double bond between C1 and C6. Wait, but benzene is a ring with all double bonds, so how does that work?

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of aromatic stability. When Br leaves, a carbanion is formed, which would have negative charge. But since benzene is already aromatic, perhaps the elimination leads to the formation of a new ring structure.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a case of formation of a benzynelike structure, but with only one elimination. Wait, no, benzynes are usually formed by the elimination of two HX molecules from a dihalide.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe another approach: think about the possible products. The question is asking how many possible organic products form. The options are 1, 2, 3, or 4.

If the reaction undergoes elimination, how many different structures could form?

Wait, another thought: maybe the elimination leads to formation of a benzene ring with a double bond, but due to the substitution pattern, there might be more than one possible product.

Wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. When elimination occurs, if the H is abstracted from position 6, then the double bond would be between 1 and 6, which is the same as between 1 and 2 in a different numbering system. So the product would have a double bond between 1 and 2, and methyl groups at 2 and 4. But wait, that would place the double bond between 1 and 2, and a methyl at 2. That's possible, but how many distinct positions can the double bond form?

Wait, another possibility: maybe the base abstracts a hydrogen from position 3 or position 5, but wait, those positions are not adjacent to the Br. So, elimination from those positions would not lead to a product. So the only possible β-H is at position 6.

Wait, but wait, the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene. So the structure is such that positions 2 and 4 are occupied by methyl groups. So, when elimination occurs, the H is taken from position 6, leading to a double bond between 1 and 6. But that's the same as position 1 and 2 if we number the ring differently. So, the product would be 1-methyl-2,4-dimethyl-1,2-diphenylethylene? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the product is 1,3-dimethylbenzene with a double bond. Wait, no, because the starting material has methyl groups at 2 and 4.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the possible products again. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, and we eliminate HBr, what's formed?

Elimination would give a benzene ring with a double bond, but where? Since the Br is at position 1 and the H is at position 6, elimination leads to a double bond between 1 and 6, which is the same as position 1 and 2 if you rotate the ring. So the product would have a double bond between 1 and 2, with methyl groups at 2 and 4. But wait, the double bond between 1 and 2 would mean that positions 1 and 2 are double bonded, so the substituents would be at 2 and 4.

But wait, benzene rings don't form isolated double bonds like that. Oh wait, no, the elimination would form a new ring structure? No, I'm getting confused.

Wait another angle: when benzene has a substituent, elimination can lead to the formation of an alkyne. But for that, you need two adjacent leaving groups. Since this molecule only has one Br, elimination can't form a triple bond. So perhaps elimination forms a double bond, leading to the formation of a monoene, like styrene. But in this case, it's a more substituted ring.

Wait, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed because there are no adjacent H's to the Br. Wait, position 2 has a methyl, so no H there. Position 6 has an H. So, elimination is possible by abstracting that H, leading to a double bond between 1 and 6.

But in terms of the ring, a double bond between 1 and 6 would make the ring have a double bond between those two positions, creating a diene? Or perhaps a mono-ene, but benzene is already a conjugated system.

This is getting a bit unclear. Let me think about the possible products. If the reaction leads to a double bond between 1 and 6, the structure would have methyl groups at 2 and 4. Wait, but that would place the double bond between 1 and 6, and the methyl groups at 2 and 4, which are meta to each other. So, the molecule would be 1-methyl-2,4-dimethyl-1,6-diphenylethylene? Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe it's better to number the ring so that the double bond is between positions 1 and 2, but that would require the H to be abstracted from position 2, which isn't possible because it's a methyl.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible products in terms of the number of isomers. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, elimination would form a double bond. Depending on where the double bond forms, there might be different products.

Wait, but in this case, the only possible H to abstract is at position 6, leading to a double bond between 1 and 6. So, only one product is formed. But wait, perhaps the base can abstract H from position 6 or another position due to some symmetry?

Wait, the starting material has a methyl group at 2 and 4, so the molecule is symmetric across the 1-4 axis. So, eliminating from position 6 or from position 2 (if possible) would lead to the same product. But position 2 has a methyl, so elimination can't occur there.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single diene. Then, only one product is formed, so the answer is option B)1.

But wait, another possibility: maybe the elimination leads to more than one product due to different sites of elimination. But in this case, since only position 6 has a β-H, I'm thinking only one product forms.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed because the conditions are not right for elimination. But I don't think that's the case.

So, putting it all together: the reaction of 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia leads to the elimination of HBr, forming a double bond between positions 1 and 6. Since there's only one possible site for elimination, only one product forms. So the correct answer is option B)1.

The reaction involves 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene treated with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia, a strong base. The starting material has a bromine atom at position 1 and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. The reaction proceeds via elimination, where a β-hydrogen is abstracted from position 6 (adjacent to the bromine at position 1). This leads to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 6. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, this elimination results in a single product with a double bond between positions 1 and 6 and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4.

Since there is only one possible β-hydrogen available for elimination (at position 6), only one product is formed. Therefore, the number of possible organic products is **1**.

Maybe it's better to number the ring so that the double bond is between positions 1 and 2, but that would require the H to be abstracted from position 2, which isn't possible because it's a methyl.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think about the possible products in terms of the number of isomers. If the starting material is 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene, elimination would form a double bond. Depending on where the double bond forms, there might be different products.

Wait, but in this case, the only possible H to abstract is at position 6, leading to a double bond between 1 and 6. So, only one product is formed. But wait, perhaps the base can abstract H from position 6 or another position due to some symmetry?

Wait, the starting material has a methyl group at 2 and 4, so the molecule is symmetric across the 1-4 axis. So, eliminating from position 6 or from position 2 (if possible) would lead to the same product. But position 2 has a methyl, so elimination can't occur there.

Wait, perhaps the product is a single diene. Then, only one product is formed, so the answer is option B)1.

But wait, another possibility: maybe the elimination leads to more than one product due to different sites of elimination. But in this case, since only position 6 has a β-H, I'm thinking only one product forms.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't proceed because the conditions are not right for elimination. But I don't think that's the case.

So, putting it all together: the reaction of 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene with NaNH2 in condensed ammonia leads to the elimination of HBr, forming a double bond between positions 1 and 6. Since there's only one possible site for elimination, only one product forms. So the correct answer is option B)1.


The reaction involves 1-bromo-2,4-dimethylbenzene treated with NaNH₂ in condensed ammonia, a strong base. The starting material has a bromine atom at position 1 and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4. The reaction proceeds via elimination, where a β-hydrogen is abstracted from position 6 (adjacent to the bromine at position 1). This leads to the elimination of HBr and the formation of a double bond between positions 1 and 6. Due to the symmetry of the molecule, this elimination results in a single product with a double bond between positions 1 and 6 and methyl groups at positions 2 and 4.

Since there is only one possible β-hydrogen available for elimination (at position 6), only one product is formed. Therefore, the number of possible organic products is **1**.

Answer: B
