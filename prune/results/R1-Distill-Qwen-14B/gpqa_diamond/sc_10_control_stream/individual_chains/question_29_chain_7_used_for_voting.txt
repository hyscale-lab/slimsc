Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about barley and some gene mutation. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

So, the question says there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. The bad gene is responsible for making this compound, and they found it has five exons and four introns. The plan is to use EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and see if any of them fix the problem.

They sequenced the target gene in all mutants and found changes in the first exon area. We need to pick which mutation would eliminate the compound, probably by disrupting the gene's function.

Looking at the given sequences, the intact gene starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then follows some codons, and ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. The mutations are in the first part of the gene.

Let me look at each mutant.

Mutant 1: The sequence changes from TTC to TAC. Let me write the intact gene and the mutants for comparison.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GTA CT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

Wait, maybe I should look for where the changes are. Each line is longer, but the changes are at specific points.

Wait, maybe I should compare each mutant's sequence to the original.

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

Hmm, so let me align them.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GTA CT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

Wait, I think I need to look for the exact positions where the changes occur.

Looking at the original, the first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGT... Let me write the original and mutant 1:

Original: ATG TTT CT C GCT GGT ACT
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT A CGCT GGT ACT ?

Wait, maybe I need to index the nucleotides. Let me count the letters.

Original starts with ATG, then TTT, then CTC, then GCT, etc.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compare each mutant's sequence to the original. Let's see:

Mutant 1: The first few changes are at position where CTC becomes CTA? Or maybe a different change.

Wait, let me write the original and each mutant's first exon part.

Original first exon:
5' ... TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ... 

Mutant1: 5' ... TTT CT ACG CTG GTA ... 

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for where the nucleotides differ.

Alternatively, maybe I should look for the first differing nucleotides. Let's see:

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

So comparing each position:

Position 1-3: ATG same.

Position 4: TTT in original, TTT in mutant? Wait, wait: let me see the exact letters. Let me write the original and mutant1 sequences:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT A CGCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

Wait, I'm getting confused. Perhaps I should write them as a continuous string.

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

So, let's line them up:

Original: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T A T T G T C G T ... T G A

Mutant1: A T G T T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T A T T G T C G C ... T G A

Comparing each position:

Let's count the letters one by one.

Position 1-3: ATG same.

Position 4: T same.

Position 5: T same.

Position 6: C same.

Position 7: T same.

Position 8: C in original. Mutant1 has A here? Wait, let me index them.

Wait, perhaps numbering helps.

Original: 1 A, 2 T, 3 G, 4 T, 5 T, 6 C, 7 T, 8 C, 9 G, 10 C, 11 T, 12 G, 13 G, 14 T, 15 A, etc.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of codons.

Original first few codons:

1. ATG (start)
2. TTT
3. CTC
4. GCT
5. GGT
6. ACT
7. TCT
8. GTG
9. GAT
10. GAA
11. CAT
12. ATT
13. TAT
14. TGT
15. CGT
... etc.

Mutant1:

1. ATG
2. TTT
3. CTA
4. CGC
5. TGG
6. TAC
7. TCT
8. GTG
9. GAT
10. GAA
11. CAT
12. ATT
13. TAT
14. TGT
15. CGC
... etc.

Wait, did I get that right? Let me check:

Mutant1's sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

Breaking into codons:

ATG (1)
TTT (2)
CT A (3?) Wait, the third codon would be the next three nucleotides after ATG and TTT. Let me write the mutant1 sequence:

Mutant1: ATG TTT C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T A T T G T C G C ...

Wait, perhaps it's better to split into triplets.

ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

So codons 3 and 4 in mutant1: CTA and CGC.

Original codons 3 and 4: CTC and GCT.

So in mutant1, codon3 is CTA instead of CTC (third codon), and codon4 is CGC instead of GCT.

So what does that mean for the amino acids?

Original:

Codon3: CTC is Leucine (Leu).
Codon4: GCT is also Leucine (Leu).

Mutant1:

Codon3: CTA is Leucine (Leu) as well. Because CTA is also Leu. Hmm, so that's same amino acid.

Codon4: CGC is Arginine (Arg). Original was Leu. So now, position4 is changed from Leu to Arg.

Wait, so that's a substitution from Leu to Arg. So a missense mutation. But does it disrupt the protein? Maybe not enough to completely eliminate the compound.

Wait, but maybe it's a nonsense mutation? No, because it's a codon change to a different amino acid.

Looking at Mutant 2:

Mutant2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

So let's break that into codons.

ATG (1)
TTT (2)
CTA (3)
AAG (4)
CTG (5)
GTA (6)
CTC (7)
... etc.

Original had codon4 as GCT (Leu), while mutant2 has AAG (Lys). So another missense mutation. Probably not a stop codon.

Mutant3:

ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Break into codons:

ATG (1)
TTT (2)
TTT (3)
TAC (4)
GCT (5)
GGT (6)
GTC (7)
AC T (8?) Wait, maybe:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTT C TGT GGA TGA A CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

So codon3 is TTA (Leu), codon4 is CGC (Arg), codon5 is TGG (Trp), codon6 is GTC (Val), codon7 is ACC (Thr), and codon8 is TCT.

Wait, in the original, codon3 was CTC (Leu), codon4 was GCT (Leu), codon5 was GGT (Gly), etc. So in mutant3, codon3 is TTA (Leu), same as before. Codon4 is CGC (Arg), codon5 is TGG (Trp instead of Gly), codon6 is GTC (Val instead of GGT, which is Gly? Wait, GGT is Gly, GTC is Val.)

Hmm, multiple amino acid changes. But again, missense. So how does that help?

Mutant4:

ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Breaking into codons:

ATG (1)
TTT (2)
TTT (3)
TAC (4)
GCT (5)
ACT (6)
TCT (7)
GTG (8)
GAT (9)
GAA (10)
... etc.

Wait, let's check:

Original had:

codon3: CTC (Leu)
codon4: GCT (Leu)
codon5: GGT (Gly)
codon6: ACT (Thr)
codon7: TCT (Ser)
codon8: GTG (Val)
...

Mutant4:

codon3: TTA (Leu)
codon4: GCT (Leu) – same as original.
codon5: ACT (Thr) same as original.
codon6: TCT (Ser)
Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me write the mutant4 sequence:

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Split into triplets:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT… TGA.

Wait, perhaps I should write each codon as groups of three.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to look for early stop codons or frame shifts.

Another approach: We need to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That likely means the gene product (protein) is causing the issue. If the gene is knocked out, the compound won't be synthesized.

So, mutations that cause a premature stop codon would result in a truncated protein, possibly nonfunctional. Alternatively, a frameshift would change downstream amino acids, possibly leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Looking for any of the mutants that introduce a stop codon early in the sequence.

Looking at the options:

Original gene ends with TGA as the stop codon. So any mutation that introduces another stop codon earlier would terminate the protein.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: Ends with CGC before the TGA. Its stop codon is intact, but it's at the end. So no new stop.

Mutant2: Same, the TGA is at the end.

Mutant3: Ends with CGT before TGA. No new stop.

Mutant4: Let's see the sequence.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence:

Original: ... TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant4: ... TGT CGC ... TGA? Or perhaps, wait, the sequence for Mutant4 is:

Original: ... TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant4: ... TGT CGC ... TGA.

Wait, is there a TGA in the middle?

Alternatively, perhaps in Mutant4 the sequence is shorter, or somewhere before the original stop, a stop codon appears.

Let me look again.

Mutant4’s sequence:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at this, I can see that perhaps after codon6, is there a TGA?

Wait, let me break into triplets:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TT C TG GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the grouping wrong. Let me write the entire Mutant4 sequence:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT ... TGA.

Hmm, perhaps in the middle, I'm not seeing a new stop codon. Unless I'm missing it.

Wait, perhaps looking at the sequence, is there a TGA anywhere before the end? Let me check.

Looking at the end of the given strand:

Original ends with ...TGT CGT ... TGA.

Mutant4's sequence is ...ATTGTCGT...TGA.

Wait, the part after the change: 

Original: ...GAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant4: ...GAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, perhaps another approach.

Another thing to consider: If a mutation creates a stop codon early, that would truncate the protein. For example, a TGA, TAG, or TAA codon inserted.

Looking at the options:

Mutant1: The changes are in the middle, but no new stop introduced.

Mutant2: Looking at the sequence, any stop codon?

Mutant2's sequence is ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

So, the codons would be:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA.

So, the last codon before TGA is CGC, which is arginine. So no premature stop.

Mutant3's codons: ... CGC TGG TGT CAC TTT ... etc. No new stops.

Mutant4's sequence: Let me think. The original has CTGGTACTTCTGTGG... So let me look at the sequence.

Mutant4's sequence: ...TTT TACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Breaking into triplets after ATG:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

Wait, the codons are TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc.

Wait, no TGA in there except at the end. So no new stop codons. So none of the mutants seem to introduce a stop codon before the original.

Wait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Maybe a frameshift?

But the question says the mutations are in the first exon area, but I don't see any insertions or deletions, only substitutions. Because all the mutant sequences are same length as the original. So no frameshifts, just point mutations.

So, if all the mutations are substitutions, then the only way to disrupt the gene is to change the amino acid in a critical way.

Alternatively, maybe a missense mutation in an important region, but it's hard to tell without knowing the protein structure.

Wait, but looking at the options, which mutations could cause a premature stop? Maybe none do, but perhaps one causes a nonsense mutation.

Wait, perhaps I should see if any of the mutants have a stop codon in the first few codons.

Looking again, perhaps in Mutant4, is there an inserted TGA early?

Wait, the start is same, ATG. Let me look at the first few codons:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

Mutant4:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT ... TGA.

Wait, in Mutant4, after ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TT C, do any of these triplets form a stop?

The triplet after TAC is TT C, which is part of the next codon. So, the codons are TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TT C (Ser?), etc. So no stop codon introduced.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait another thought: What if the mutation creates a stop codon in the same reading frame before the original stop? Let's see.

Mutant4:

The sequence from start:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT ... TGA.

Wait, the ATG is start. Then TTT (Phe), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TT C (Ser?), etc. No TGA, TAG, or TAA in the first part.

What about Mutant3?

Mutant3: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTT C TGT GGA TGA A CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

Wait, looking at the codons:

ATG (1), TTT (2), TTA (3), CGC (4), TGG (5), TGT (6), CAC (7), TTT (8), C TGT (9?), etc.

Wait, codon5 is TGG (Trp), codon6 is TGT (Cys), codon7 is CAC (His), codon8 is TTT (Phe), etc.

No stop codon introduced.

Wait, another approach: perhaps a nonsense mutation occurs in the middle.

Wait, the only way I can see that is if a codon becomes TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Looking for any of the mutants where a codon becomes one of these.

Looking at each codon in the mutants:

Mutant1:

Codon3: CTA (Leu)
Codon4: CGC (Arg)
... no stop.

Mutant2:

Codon3: CTA (Leu)
Codon4: AAG (Lys)
No stop.

Mutant3:

Codon5: TGG (Trp)
Codon6: TGT (Cys)
No stop.

Mutant4:

Codon5: TAC (Tyr)
No.

Wait, unless I'm missing a stop in some other position.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, looking at the entire sequence. Let me look for TGA in the middle.

Wait, after the initial part, the sequence is ... TGT CGT ... TGA.

In Mutant4, the sequence before TGA is ... GTC GT... TGA.

Wait, the original had CGT before TGA, Mutant4 has CGT as well, I think.

Wait, perhaps looking at the entire sequence again.

Wait, the original has at the end: ...CGT ... TGA.

Mutant4's sequence: ...GTCGT ... TGA.

Wait, is that part:

In original: ...GTCGT...TGA → perhaps the last part before TGA is ...CGT.

In Mutant4's case: ...GTC GT ... TGA.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the letters wrong. Let me look at the sequences.

Original ends with ...GTCGT...TGA.

Mutant4 ends with ...GTCGT...TGA.

So they have the same ending.

Wait, but in Mutant4, maybe an earlier part has a stop.

Wait, perhaps looking at the middle:

Mutant4's sequence (partial): ...ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

Hmm, no TGA in the middle.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think. Maybe the correct answer is the one that introduces a stop codon. But I don't see any of the mutants introducing a stop before the original.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutations cause a frameshift leading to a premature stop, but again, the sequences are same length, so no frameshift. So all are point mutations.

So, perhaps another approach: Which mutation would cause a loss of function by disrupting the gene's reading frame? No, because no insertions or deletions—so same reading frame.

In that case, perhaps any mutation that disrupts the start codon or changes the first few amino acids.

Looking at the start codon:

All options have ATG as the start. So no change in start codon.

What about the next codon? Original is TTT (Phe), which is in all mutants.

Mutant1: TTT same.

So, maybe the mutations are in the middle of the gene, but how does that help?

Wait, the question is about eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. So if the gene is non-functional, the compound won't be made.

How can a mutation eliminate the gene function? Either by causing an early stop (nonsense) or by a missense that disrupts the active site.

Another thought: perhaps the mutation creates a splice donor or acceptor site, but that's in introns. The problem states that mutations are in the first exon, so probably not affecting splicing.

Wait, but the gene has five exons and four introns, but the mutation is in the first exon, so the splicing machinery is probably unaffected.

So, perhaps the best bet is a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon, making a truncated protein that can't function.

But none of the mutants seem to have that. So maybe I'm missing it.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence again. Let me write it out:

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Wait, maybe the sequence from position 10 onwards?

Wait, let me count the letters from the start:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT ... TGA.

Wait, "TTCTG" is part of the codon. So the codon after TAC is TTT C (but that's part of the next codon).

Wait, perhaps I'm not seeing it. Let me try to see if any codon in the mutants is a stop.

Wait, the original has TGA as stop, which is in the middle of the sequence? Or at the end?

Wait, the original sequence ends with TGA, which is the stop. So all the mutants have TGA as well.

So, unless a mutation creates another stop before that, the protein will be full length but with some amino acid changes.

Wait, but the question is about getting rid of the anti-nutritional compound. So perhaps the best option is a mutation that disrupts the gene product. If any of the mutants have a mutation that causes a frameshift, but again, since all the mutants have same length, no frameshift.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that introduces a stop codon. But I'm not seeing any in the given options.

Wait, wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence again:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Breaking into triplets:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT ... TGA.

Wait, in the middle, perhaps the sequence is ...TTCTG TGG... So the codon after TAC is TTCTG? No, that's five letters. So the triplets are:

ATG (1)
TTT (2)
TTA (3)
CGC (4)
TAC (5)
TT C (6? No, because it's triplet. So, TAC is codon5, next is TT C which is the start of codon6: TCT.

Wait, codon6 is TCT (Ser), original would have been TCT as well. So, no stop.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that perhaps the correct answer is D) Mutant4 because it's missing part of the gene, but I can't see that.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 causes a frameshift. But the sequences are same length, so no frameshift.

Wait, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 disrupts a critical region, like the start of the gene. But the start codon is intact.

Wait, looking at the sequences again:

Original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

Mutant4 starts with ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT ... TGA.

Wait, the third codon is TTA (Leu) instead of CTC (Leu). So same amino acid.

Wait, the fourth codon is CGC (Arg) instead of GCT (Leu).

Fifth codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of GGT (Gly).

So, in the early part, the amino acids change from Leu, Leu, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val, ... to Leu, Arg, Tyr, Ser, Val,...

No obvious nonsense mutation, but perhaps these changes disrupt the protein's function.

But without knowing the protein structure, it's hard to say which mutation would disrupt it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is the one that introduces a stop codon. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reading frame. If a mutation creates a stop codon in the same reading frame, it could truncate the protein.

Looking again, perhaps in Mutant4, after some point, the codon becomes TGA.

Wait, let me see: from the start:

ATG (1) → start.

Then TTT, TTA, CGC, TAC, TT C, GTG, GAT, GAA, CAT, ATT, TAT, TGT, CGT, ..., TGA.

Wait, where is TGA in the middle? I don't see it. Only at the end.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence after 'TTT' is TAT TGT CGT... TGA.

No TGA in the middle.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the correct mutation is the one where the first exon has a mutation that disrupts the gene product.

Wait, another approach: the gene has five exons. So maybe the mutation is in a region that's critical for the gene's function, such as the start codon or the beginning of the coding region.

Looking at the changes, which mutation would cause the gene product to be nonfunctional.

Mutant1 has a substitution in the third codon (CTC → CTA) and fourth codon (GCT → CGC). Both are Leu to Leu and Leu to Arg. Maybe not a big effect.

Mutant2: third codon CTC → CTA (Leu same), fourth codon GCT → AAG (Leu → Lys). So, substitution in amino acid 4.

Mutant3: third codon CTC → TTA (Leu → Leu), fourth codon GCT → CGC (Leu → Arg), fifth codon GGT → TGG (Gly → Trp). So, multiple changes.

Mutant4: third codon CTC → TTA (Leu → Leu), fourth codon GCT → CGC (Leu → Arg), fifth codon GGT → TAC (Gly → Tyr). So, changes in amino acids 4,5.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 causes the gene to produce a shorter protein, but I don't see a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the mutation creates a stop codon in the middle. Let me look again.

Mutant4's sequence:

5’-ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT ... TGA-3’.

Looking for any triplet that is TGA, TAG, or TAA.

The first triplet after ATG is TTT (Phe), then TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TT C (Ser?), GTG (Val), etc. No TGA.

Wait, perhaps the mutation is in the middle of the gene, and the stop is still at the end. So, perhaps the protein is longer but nonfunctional. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the gene is nonfunctional because the mutation causes a change in the mRNA's secondary structure, but that's too vague.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mutation creates a new splice site, but the mutation is in the first exon, so it's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts a critical region, such as the promoter, but the question says it's in the first exon.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is Mutant1, because in its fourth codon, it changes from GCT (Leu) to CGC (Arg). That could be a critical change.

But without knowing the protein structure, it's hard to tell.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because in the sequence, the part after the mutation may have a frameshift. But earlier I thought the length is same, no frameshift.

Wait, unless I'm miscounting the letters.

Let me count the letters in original and Mutant4.

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Count the letters before the …:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT.

That's 3*15=45 letters before the ... (if including all up to CGT).

Mutant4's sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Same length before the ...? Let's see.

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT.

Wait, maybe not. Let me count letters:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT.

Breaking into letters:

ATG → 3

TTT → 3 (total 6)

TTA → 3 (9)

CGC →3 (12)

TAC →3 (15)

TTCTG →5? Wait, no, each codon is 3 letters. So perhaps the sequence after TAC is TT C, which is part of the next codon.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up. Let me count the letters.

Original's first part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT.

That's:

ATG (3)
TTT (3)
CTC (3)
GCT (3)
GGT (3)
ACT (3)
TCT (3)
GTG (3)
GAT (3)
GAA (3)
CAT (3)
ATT (3)
TAT (3)
TGT (3)
CGT (3)
Total: 3*15=45 letters.

Mutant4's first part: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT.

Wait, each of these is 3 letters except TTCTG, which is five letters. Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps I'm grouping wrong.

Wait, the sequence is: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT.

But that can't be right because after TAC, the next should be TTT, etc. Perhaps the correct grouping is:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC T TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the correct way is:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT.

So, in that case, the sequence is:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT.

Which is 15 codons, same as original. So the length is same.

So, no frameshift. Therefore, all mutations are point mutations.

In that case, the only way to eliminate the compound is to disrupt the gene's function, perhaps by creating a nonfunctional protein.

Which mutation would cause this? Perhaps one that changes a critical region.

Another thought: The first codon after the start is TTT (Phe) in all mutants. So it's same.

The third codon in original is CTC (Leu), in Mutant1 it's CTA (Leu), same amino acid.

So, no change. The fourth codon is changed in Mutant1,2,4.

Mutant4's fourth codon is CGC (Arg), which is a different amino acid.

Hmm. But how would that affect the protein? Without knowing the structure, perhaps the best approach is to look for a mutation that creates a stop codon.

Wait, maybe I'm looking at Mutant3 incorrectly. Let me check again.

Mutant3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Breaking into triplets:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTT C TGT GGA TGA A CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

Wait, the codon after CAC is TTT (Phe), then C TGT (Cys), etc.

Wait, codon after CAC is T T C, which is the start of the next codon. So, TGT is Cys.

Wait, no stop codon.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for the option that introduces a TGA codon early on.

Wait, let me look at Mutant4's sequence again.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Wait, the part after TAC is TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT.

So, perhaps the sequence TTCTG is part of the same codon. Wait, that would be TT C T G? No, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the codon after TAC is TT C, but that's only two letters. No, that's not possible. So the correct grouping is TAC T TCT GTG... So, TAC is codon5, T TCT is part of codon6: TCT.

Wait, codon6 is TCT (Ser).

Hmm. No stop codon.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation is in the splice donor or acceptor site, but since it's in the first exon, that's less likely to affect splicing.

Alternatively, perhaps a nonsense mutation in the first exon, but I don't see any.

Wait, considering that all the options don't introduce a stop, perhaps the answer is a missense mutation that disrupts the active site. Among the options, perhaps Mutant4 changes a Gly to Tyr (codon5), which could be significant.

But without knowing the protein's structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1, which changes codon4 from Leu to Arg. Maybe that's in a critical region.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because in the sequence, the fifth codon changes from Gly to Tyr. Gly is a small, non-reactive amino acid, while Tyr is larger and has a hydroxyl group. Maybe that disrupts the protein's structure.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant D) 4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 creates a stop codon in a different frame. But since all are in the same frame, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the question is about knocking out the gene, which can be done by disrupting the reading frame or creating a stop codon. Since none of the mutations create a stop, perhaps the best option is the one that disrupts the most critical part.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because in the sequence, after the mutation, the codon becomes TAC, which is Tyr, but I don't know.

Wait, another angle: the anti-nutritional compound is synthesized by the gene product. To eliminate it, we need to stop the gene's function. So, any mutation that disrupts the gene's function would be acceptable.

Among the options, perhaps the one with the most disruptive mutation is the correct answer.

Looking at the options:

Mutant1: changes codon3 (Leu → Leu), codon4 (Leu → Arg).

Mutant2: codon3 (Leu → Leu), codon4 (Leu → Lys).

Mutant3: codon3 (Leu → Leu), codon4 (Leu → Arg), codon5 (Gly → Trp), codon6 (Gly → Val).

Mutant4: codon3 (Leu → Leu), codon4 (Leu → Arg), codon5 (Gly → Tyr).

So, Mutant3 has the most amino acid changes in the early part, but I'm not sure if that's the best choice.

Alternatively, perhaps Mutant4 is the best because it changes codon5 from Gly to Tyr. Gly is a very small residue, and changing it to a bulkier Tyr could disrupt the protein structure significantly.

So, perhaps the answer is D) Mutant4.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein's structure.

### Key Observations:
1. **Intact Gene**: The sequence starts with `ATG` (start codon) and ends with `TGA` (stop codon). The first few codons are `ATG`, `TTT`, `CTC`, `GCT`, `GGT`, `ACT`, etc.
2. **Mutant Analysis**:
   - **Mutant 1**: Changes codons 3 (`CTC` → `CTA`, Leu → Leu) and 4 (`GCT` → `CGC`, Leu → Arg). No premature stop codon introduced.
   - **Mutant 2**: Changes codons 3 (`CTC` → `CTA`, Leu → Leu) and 4 (`GCT` → `AAG`, Leu → Lys). No premature stop codon introduced.
   - **Mutant 3**: Changes codons 3 (`CTC` → `TTT`, Leu → Leu), 4 (`GCT` → `CGC`, Leu → Arg), and 5 (`GGT` → `TGG`, Gly → Trp). Multiple amino acid changes, but no premature stop codon.
   - **Mutant 4**: Changes codons 3 (`CTC` → `TTT`, Leu → Leu), 4 (`GCT` → `CGC`, Leu → Arg), and 5 (`GGT` → `TAC`, Gly → Tyr). Significant amino acid changes, but no premature stop codon.

### Critical Analysis:
- None of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon (`TGA`, `TAG`, or `TAA`) before the original stop codon at the end of the sequence.
- All mutations are point substitutions, maintaining the same reading frame and length, so no frameshift occurs.
- The most disruptive mutation appears in **Mutant 4**, where codon 5 changes from `GGT` (Gly) to `TAC` (Tyr). This substitution replaces a small, non-reactive amino acid (Gly) with a bulkier, hydroxyl-containing amino acid (Tyr), which could significantly disrupt the protein's structure or function.

### Conclusion:
While none of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon, **Mutant 4** is the most likely to disrupt the gene's function due to the significant alteration in codon 5, making it the best candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.

**Answer: D**

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about barley and some gene mutation. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let's see.

So, the question says there's a drought-resistant barley cultivar, but it has an anti-nutritional compound. The bad gene is responsible for making this compound, and they found it has five exons and four introns. The plan is to use EMS mutagenesis to create mutants and see if any of them fix the problem.

They sequenced the target gene in all mutants and found changes in the first exon area. We need to pick which mutation would eliminate the compound, probably by disrupting the gene's function.

Looking at the given sequences, the intact gene starts with ATG, which is the start codon. Then follows some codons, and ends with TGA, which is a stop codon. The mutations are in the first part of the gene.

Let me look at each mutant.

Mutant 1: The sequence changes from TTC to TAC. Let me write the intact gene and the mutants for comparison.

Intact: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GTA CT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

Wait, maybe I should look for where the changes are. Each line is longer, but the changes are at specific points.

Wait, maybe I should compare each mutant's sequence to the original.

Intact gene: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Mutant 1:
5’-ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

Hmm, so let me align them.

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT ACG CTG GTA CT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

Wait, I think I need to look for the exact positions where the changes occur.

Looking at the original, the first part is ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGT... Let me write the original and mutant 1:

Original: ATG TTT CT C GCT GGT ACT
Mutant1: ATG TTT CT A CGCT GGT ACT ?

Wait, maybe I need to index the nucleotides. Let me count the letters.

Original starts with ATG, then TTT, then CTC, then GCT, etc.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compare each mutant's sequence to the original. Let's see:

Mutant 1: The first few changes are at position where CTC becomes CTA? Or maybe a different change.

Wait, let me write the original and each mutant's first exon part.

Original first exon:
5' ... TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT ... 

Mutant1: 5' ... TTT CT ACG CTG GTA ... 

Wait, perhaps it's better to look for where the nucleotides differ.

Alternatively, maybe I should look for the first differing nucleotides. Let's see:

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA
Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

So comparing each position:

Position 1-3: ATG same.

Position 4: TTT in original, TTT in mutant? Wait, wait: let me see the exact letters. Let me write the original and mutant1 sequences:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant1: ATG TTT CT A CGCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

Wait, I'm getting confused. Perhaps I should write them as a continuous string.

Original: ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant1: ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA

So, let's line them up:

Original: A T G T T T C T C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T A T T G T C G T ... T G A

Mutant1: A T G T T T C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T A T T G T C G C ... T G A

Comparing each position:

Let's count the letters one by one.

Position 1-3: ATG same.

Position 4: T same.

Position 5: T same.

Position 6: C same.

Position 7: T same.

Position 8: C in original. Mutant1 has A here? Wait, let me index them.

Wait, perhaps numbering helps.

Original: 1 A, 2 T, 3 G, 4 T, 5 T, 6 C, 7 T, 8 C, 9 G, 10 C, 11 T, 12 G, 13 G, 14 T, 15 A, etc.

Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of codons.

Original first few codons:

1. ATG (start)
2. TTT
3. CTC
4. GCT
5. GGT
6. ACT
7. TCT
8. GTG
9. GAT
10. GAA
11. CAT
12. ATT
13. TAT
14. TGT
15. CGT
... etc.

Mutant1:

1. ATG
2. TTT
3. CTA
4. CGC
5. TGG
6. TAC
7. TCT
8. GTG
9. GAT
10. GAA
11. CAT
12. ATT
13. TAT
14. TGT
15. CGC
... etc.

Wait, did I get that right? Let me check:

Mutant1's sequence is ATGTTCTACGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA.

Breaking into codons:

ATG (1)
TTT (2)
CT A (3?) Wait, the third codon would be the next three nucleotides after ATG and TTT. Let me write the mutant1 sequence:

Mutant1: ATG TTT C T A C G C T G G T A C T T C T G T G G A T G A A C A T A T T A T T G T C G C ...

Wait, perhaps it's better to split into triplets.

ATG TTT CTA CGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA

So codons 3 and 4 in mutant1: CTA and CGC.

Original codons 3 and 4: CTC and GCT.

So in mutant1, codon3 is CTA instead of CTC (third codon), and codon4 is CGC instead of GCT.

So what does that mean for the amino acids?

Original:

Codon3: CTC is Leucine (Leu).
Codon4: GCT is also Leucine (Leu).

Mutant1:

Codon3: CTA is Leucine (Leu) as well. Because CTA is also Leu. Hmm, so that's same amino acid.

Codon4: CGC is Arginine (Arg). Original was Leu. So now, position4 is changed from Leu to Arg.

Wait, so that's a substitution from Leu to Arg. So a missense mutation. But does it disrupt the protein? Maybe not enough to completely eliminate the compound.

Wait, but maybe it's a nonsense mutation? No, because it's a codon change to a different amino acid.

Looking at Mutant 2:

Mutant2: ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

So let's break that into codons.

ATG (1)
TTT (2)
CTA (3)
AAG (4)
CTG (5)
GTA (6)
CTC (7)
... etc.

Original had codon4 as GCT (Leu), while mutant2 has AAG (Lys). So another missense mutation. Probably not a stop codon.

Mutant3:

ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Break into codons:

ATG (1)
TTT (2)
TTT (3)
TAC (4)
GCT (5)
GGT (6)
GTC (7)
AC T (8?) Wait, maybe:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTT C TGT GGA TGA A CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

So codon3 is TTA (Leu), codon4 is CGC (Arg), codon5 is TGG (Trp), codon6 is GTC (Val), codon7 is ACC (Thr), and codon8 is TCT.

Wait, in the original, codon3 was CTC (Leu), codon4 was GCT (Leu), codon5 was GGT (Gly), etc. So in mutant3, codon3 is TTA (Leu), same as before. Codon4 is CGC (Arg), codon5 is TGG (Trp instead of Gly), codon6 is GTC (Val instead of GGT, which is Gly? Wait, GGT is Gly, GTC is Val.)

Hmm, multiple amino acid changes. But again, missense. So how does that help?

Mutant4:

ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Breaking into codons:

ATG (1)
TTT (2)
TTT (3)
TAC (4)
GCT (5)
ACT (6)
TCT (7)
GTG (8)
GAT (9)
GAA (10)
... etc.

Wait, let's check:

Original had:

codon3: CTC (Leu)
codon4: GCT (Leu)
codon5: GGT (Gly)
codon6: ACT (Thr)
codon7: TCT (Ser)
codon8: GTG (Val)
...

Mutant4:

codon3: TTA (Leu)
codon4: GCT (Leu) – same as original.
codon5: ACT (Thr) same as original.
codon6: TCT (Ser)
Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me write the mutant4 sequence:

Mutant4: ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Split into triplets:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT… TGA.

Wait, perhaps I should write each codon as groups of three.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to look for early stop codons or frame shifts.

Another approach: We need to eliminate the anti-nutritional compound. That likely means the gene product (protein) is causing the issue. If the gene is knocked out, the compound won't be synthesized.

So, mutations that cause a premature stop codon would result in a truncated protein, possibly nonfunctional. Alternatively, a frameshift would change downstream amino acids, possibly leading to a nonfunctional protein.

Looking for any of the mutants that introduce a stop codon early in the sequence.

Looking at the options:

Original gene ends with TGA as the stop codon. So any mutation that introduces another stop codon earlier would terminate the protein.

Looking at each mutant:

Mutant1: Ends with CGC before the TGA. Its stop codon is intact, but it's at the end. So no new stop.

Mutant2: Same, the TGA is at the end.

Mutant3: Ends with CGT before TGA. No new stop.

Mutant4: Let's see the sequence.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence:

Original: ... TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant4: ... TGT CGC ... TGA? Or perhaps, wait, the sequence for Mutant4 is:

Original: ... TGT CGT ... TGA

Mutant4: ... TGT CGC ... TGA.

Wait, is there a TGA in the middle?

Alternatively, perhaps in Mutant4 the sequence is shorter, or somewhere before the original stop, a stop codon appears.

Let me look again.

Mutant4’s sequence:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Looking at this, I can see that perhaps after codon6, is there a TGA?

Wait, let me break into triplets:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TT C TG GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the grouping wrong. Let me write the entire Mutant4 sequence:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT ... TGA.

Hmm, perhaps in the middle, I'm not seeing a new stop codon. Unless I'm missing it.

Wait, perhaps looking at the sequence, is there a TGA anywhere before the end? Let me check.

Looking at the end of the given strand:

Original ends with ...TGT CGT ... TGA.

Mutant4's sequence is ...ATTGTCGT...TGA.

Wait, the part after the change: 

Original: ...GAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Mutant4: ...GAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused, perhaps another approach.

Another thing to consider: If a mutation creates a stop codon early, that would truncate the protein. For example, a TGA, TAG, or TAA codon inserted.

Looking at the options:

Mutant1: The changes are in the middle, but no new stop introduced.

Mutant2: Looking at the sequence, any stop codon?

Mutant2's sequence is ATGTTCTAAGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGC…TGA-3’.

So, the codons would be:

ATG TTT CTA AGC TGG TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGC ... TGA.

So, the last codon before TGA is CGC, which is arginine. So no premature stop.

Mutant3's codons: ... CGC TGG TGT CAC TTT ... etc. No new stops.

Mutant4's sequence: Let me think. The original has CTGGTACTTCTGTGG... So let me look at the sequence.

Mutant4's sequence: ...TTT TACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA.

Breaking into triplets after ATG:

ATG TTT TAC GCT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

Wait, the codons are TTT (Phe), TAC (Tyr), GCT (Ala), ACT (Thr), TCT (Ser), GTG (Val), GAT (Asp), GAA (Glu), etc.

Wait, no TGA in there except at the end. So no new stop codons. So none of the mutants seem to introduce a stop codon before the original.

Wait, maybe I'm looking in the wrong place. Maybe a frameshift?

But the question says the mutations are in the first exon area, but I don't see any insertions or deletions, only substitutions. Because all the mutant sequences are same length as the original. So no frameshifts, just point mutations.

So, if all the mutations are substitutions, then the only way to disrupt the gene is to change the amino acid in a critical way.

Alternatively, maybe a missense mutation in an important region, but it's hard to tell without knowing the protein structure.

Wait, but looking at the options, which mutations could cause a premature stop? Maybe none do, but perhaps one causes a nonsense mutation.

Wait, perhaps I should see if any of the mutants have a stop codon in the first few codons.

Looking again, perhaps in Mutant4, is there an inserted TGA early?

Wait, the start is same, ATG. Let me look at the first few codons:

Original: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

Mutant4:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT ... TGA.

Wait, in Mutant4, after ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TT C, do any of these triplets form a stop?

The triplet after TAC is TT C, which is part of the next codon. So, the codons are TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TT C (Ser?), etc. So no stop codon introduced.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait another thought: What if the mutation creates a stop codon in the same reading frame before the original stop? Let's see.

Mutant4:

The sequence from start:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT ... TGA.

Wait, the ATG is start. Then TTT (Phe), TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TT C (Ser?), etc. No TGA, TAG, or TAA in the first part.

What about Mutant3?

Mutant3: ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTT C TGT GGA TGA A CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

Wait, looking at the codons:

ATG (1), TTT (2), TTA (3), CGC (4), TGG (5), TGT (6), CAC (7), TTT (8), C TGT (9?), etc.

Wait, codon5 is TGG (Trp), codon6 is TGT (Cys), codon7 is CAC (His), codon8 is TTT (Phe), etc.

No stop codon introduced.

Wait, another approach: perhaps a nonsense mutation occurs in the middle.

Wait, the only way I can see that is if a codon becomes TGA, TAG, or TAA.

Looking for any of the mutants where a codon becomes one of these.

Looking at each codon in the mutants:

Mutant1:

Codon3: CTA (Leu)
Codon4: CGC (Arg)
... no stop.

Mutant2:

Codon3: CTA (Leu)
Codon4: AAG (Lys)
No stop.

Mutant3:

Codon5: TGG (Trp)
Codon6: TGT (Cys)
No stop.

Mutant4:

Codon5: TAC (Tyr)
No.

Wait, unless I'm missing a stop in some other position.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, looking at the entire sequence. Let me look for TGA in the middle.

Wait, after the initial part, the sequence is ... TGT CGT ... TGA.

In Mutant4, the sequence before TGA is ... GTC GT... TGA.

Wait, the original had CGT before TGA, Mutant4 has CGT as well, I think.

Wait, perhaps looking at the entire sequence again.

Wait, the original has at the end: ...CGT ... TGA.

Mutant4's sequence: ...GTCGT ... TGA.

Wait, is that part:

In original: ...GTCGT...TGA → perhaps the last part before TGA is ...CGT.

In Mutant4's case: ...GTC GT ... TGA.

Wait, maybe I'm getting the letters wrong. Let me look at the sequences.

Original ends with ...GTCGT...TGA.

Mutant4 ends with ...GTCGT...TGA.

So they have the same ending.

Wait, but in Mutant4, maybe an earlier part has a stop.

Wait, perhaps looking at the middle:

Mutant4's sequence (partial): ...ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

Hmm, no TGA in the middle.

Wait, perhaps I'm stuck. Let me think. Maybe the correct answer is the one that introduces a stop codon. But I don't see any of the mutants introducing a stop before the original.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutations cause a frameshift leading to a premature stop, but again, the sequences are same length, so no frameshift. So all are point mutations.

So, perhaps another approach: Which mutation would cause a loss of function by disrupting the gene's reading frame? No, because no insertions or deletions—so same reading frame.

In that case, perhaps any mutation that disrupts the start codon or changes the first few amino acids.

Looking at the start codon:

All options have ATG as the start. So no change in start codon.

What about the next codon? Original is TTT (Phe), which is in all mutants.

Mutant1: TTT same.

So, maybe the mutations are in the middle of the gene, but how does that help?

Wait, the question is about eliminating the anti-nutritional compound. So if the gene is non-functional, the compound won't be made.

How can a mutation eliminate the gene function? Either by causing an early stop (nonsense) or by a missense that disrupts the active site.

Another thought: perhaps the mutation creates a splice donor or acceptor site, but that's in introns. The problem states that mutations are in the first exon, so probably not affecting splicing.

Wait, but the gene has five exons and four introns, but the mutation is in the first exon, so the splicing machinery is probably unaffected.

So, perhaps the best bet is a mutation that introduces a premature stop codon, making a truncated protein that can't function.

But none of the mutants seem to have that. So maybe I'm missing it.

Wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence again. Let me write it out:

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Wait, maybe the sequence from position 10 onwards?

Wait, let me count the letters from the start:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT ... TGA.

Wait, "TTCTG" is part of the codon. So the codon after TAC is TTT C (but that's part of the next codon).

Wait, perhaps I'm not seeing it. Let me try to see if any codon in the mutants is a stop.

Wait, the original has TGA as stop, which is in the middle of the sequence? Or at the end?

Wait, the original sequence ends with TGA, which is the stop. So all the mutants have TGA as well.

So, unless a mutation creates another stop before that, the protein will be full length but with some amino acid changes.

Wait, but the question is about getting rid of the anti-nutritional compound. So perhaps the best option is a mutation that disrupts the gene product. If any of the mutants have a mutation that causes a frameshift, but again, since all the mutants have same length, no frameshift.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a mutation that introduces a stop codon. But I'm not seeing any in the given options.

Wait, wait, looking at Mutant4's sequence again:

5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Breaking into triplets:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT ... TGA.

Wait, in the middle, perhaps the sequence is ...TTCTG TGG... So the codon after TAC is TTCTG? No, that's five letters. So the triplets are:

ATG (1)
TTT (2)
TTA (3)
CGC (4)
TAC (5)
TT C (6? No, because it's triplet. So, TAC is codon5, next is TT C which is the start of codon6: TCT.

Wait, codon6 is TCT (Ser), original would have been TCT as well. So, no stop.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that perhaps the correct answer is D) Mutant4 because it's missing part of the gene, but I can't see that.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 causes a frameshift. But the sequences are same length, so no frameshift.

Wait, perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 disrupts a critical region, like the start of the gene. But the start codon is intact.

Wait, looking at the sequences again:

Original starts with ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

Mutant4 starts with ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT ... TGA.

Wait, the third codon is TTA (Leu) instead of CTC (Leu). So same amino acid.

Wait, the fourth codon is CGC (Arg) instead of GCT (Leu).

Fifth codon is TAC (Tyr) instead of GGT (Gly).

So, in the early part, the amino acids change from Leu, Leu, Gly, Thr, Ser, Val, ... to Leu, Arg, Tyr, Ser, Val,...

No obvious nonsense mutation, but perhaps these changes disrupt the protein's function.

But without knowing the protein structure, it's hard to say which mutation would disrupt it.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is the one that introduces a stop codon. But I'm not seeing it.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the reading frame. If a mutation creates a stop codon in the same reading frame, it could truncate the protein.

Looking again, perhaps in Mutant4, after some point, the codon becomes TGA.

Wait, let me see: from the start:

ATG (1) → start.

Then TTT, TTA, CGC, TAC, TT C, GTG, GAT, GAA, CAT, ATT, TAT, TGT, CGT, ..., TGA.

Wait, where is TGA in the middle? I don't see it. Only at the end.

Wait, perhaps in Mutant4, the sequence after 'TTT' is TAT TGT CGT... TGA.

No TGA in the middle.

Hmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the correct mutation is the one where the first exon has a mutation that disrupts the gene product.

Wait, another approach: the gene has five exons. So maybe the mutation is in a region that's critical for the gene's function, such as the start codon or the beginning of the coding region.

Looking at the changes, which mutation would cause the gene product to be nonfunctional.

Mutant1 has a substitution in the third codon (CTC → CTA) and fourth codon (GCT → CGC). Both are Leu to Leu and Leu to Arg. Maybe not a big effect.

Mutant2: third codon CTC → CTA (Leu same), fourth codon GCT → AAG (Leu → Lys). So, substitution in amino acid 4.

Mutant3: third codon CTC → TTA (Leu → Leu), fourth codon GCT → CGC (Leu → Arg), fifth codon GGT → TGG (Gly → Trp). So, multiple changes.

Mutant4: third codon CTC → TTA (Leu → Leu), fourth codon GCT → CGC (Leu → Arg), fifth codon GGT → TAC (Gly → Tyr). So, changes in amino acids 4,5.

Hmm. Perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4, but I'm not sure why.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 causes the gene to produce a shorter protein, but I don't see a stop codon.

Wait, perhaps the mutation creates a stop codon in the middle. Let me look again.

Mutant4's sequence:

5’-ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT ... TGA-3’.

Looking for any triplet that is TGA, TAG, or TAA.

The first triplet after ATG is TTT (Phe), then TTA (Leu), CGC (Arg), TAC (Tyr), TT C (Ser?), GTG (Val), etc. No TGA.

Wait, perhaps the mutation is in the middle of the gene, and the stop is still at the end. So, perhaps the protein is longer but nonfunctional. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps the gene is nonfunctional because the mutation causes a change in the mRNA's secondary structure, but that's too vague.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the mutation creates a new splice site, but the mutation is in the first exon, so it's less likely.

Alternatively, perhaps the mutation disrupts a critical region, such as the promoter, but the question says it's in the first exon.

Wait, maybe the correct answer is Mutant1, because in its fourth codon, it changes from GCT (Leu) to CGC (Arg). That could be a critical change.

But without knowing the protein structure, it's hard to tell.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because in the sequence, the part after the mutation may have a frameshift. But earlier I thought the length is same, no frameshift.

Wait, unless I'm miscounting the letters.

Let me count the letters in original and Mutant4.

Original: 5’-ATGTTTCTCGCTGGTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’

Count the letters before the …:

ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT.

That's 3*15=45 letters before the ... (if including all up to CGT).

Mutant4's sequence: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Same length before the ...? Let's see.

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT.

Wait, maybe not. Let me count letters:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT.

Breaking into letters:

ATG → 3

TTT → 3 (total 6)

TTA → 3 (9)

CGC →3 (12)

TAC →3 (15)

TTCTG →5? Wait, no, each codon is 3 letters. So perhaps the sequence after TAC is TT C, which is part of the next codon.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up. Let me count the letters.

Original's first part: ATG TTT CTC GCT GGT ACT TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT.

That's:

ATG (3)
TTT (3)
CTC (3)
GCT (3)
GGT (3)
ACT (3)
TCT (3)
GTG (3)
GAT (3)
GAA (3)
CAT (3)
ATT (3)
TAT (3)
TGT (3)
CGT (3)
Total: 3*15=45 letters.

Mutant4's first part: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT.

Wait, each of these is 3 letters except TTCTG, which is five letters. Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps I'm grouping wrong.

Wait, the sequence is: ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT.

But that can't be right because after TAC, the next should be TTT, etc. Perhaps the correct grouping is:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC T TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the correct way is:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT.

So, in that case, the sequence is:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TAC TCT GTG GAT GAA CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT.

Which is 15 codons, same as original. So the length is same.

So, no frameshift. Therefore, all mutations are point mutations.

In that case, the only way to eliminate the compound is to disrupt the gene's function, perhaps by creating a nonfunctional protein.

Which mutation would cause this? Perhaps one that changes a critical region.

Another thought: The first codon after the start is TTT (Phe) in all mutants. So it's same.

The third codon in original is CTC (Leu), in Mutant1 it's CTA (Leu), same amino acid.

So, no change. The fourth codon is changed in Mutant1,2,4.

Mutant4's fourth codon is CGC (Arg), which is a different amino acid.

Hmm. But how would that affect the protein? Without knowing the structure, perhaps the best approach is to look for a mutation that creates a stop codon.

Wait, maybe I'm looking at Mutant3 incorrectly. Let me check again.

Mutant3: ATGTTTTACGCTGGTGTCACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Breaking into triplets:

ATG TTT TTA CGC TGG TGT CAC TTT C TGT GGA TGA A CAT ATT TAT TGT CGT ... TGA.

Wait, the codon after CAC is TTT (Phe), then C TGT (Cys), etc.

Wait, codon after CAC is T T C, which is the start of the next codon. So, TGT is Cys.

Wait, no stop codon.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should look for the option that introduces a TGA codon early on.

Wait, let me look at Mutant4's sequence again.

Mutant4: 5’-ATGTTTTACGCTACTTCTGTGGATGAACATATTTATTGTCGT…TGA-3’.

Wait, the part after TAC is TTCTG TGG ATG AAC ATA TTT ATT GTC GT.

So, perhaps the sequence TTCTG is part of the same codon. Wait, that would be TT C T G? No, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the codon after TAC is TT C, but that's only two letters. No, that's not possible. So the correct grouping is TAC T TCT GTG... So, TAC is codon5, T TCT is part of codon6: TCT.

Wait, codon6 is TCT (Ser).

Hmm. No stop codon.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation is in the splice donor or acceptor site, but since it's in the first exon, that's less likely to affect splicing.

Alternatively, perhaps a nonsense mutation in the first exon, but I don't see any.

Wait, considering that all the options don't introduce a stop, perhaps the answer is a missense mutation that disrupts the active site. Among the options, perhaps Mutant4 changes a Gly to Tyr (codon5), which could be significant.

But without knowing the protein's structure, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant1, which changes codon4 from Leu to Arg. Maybe that's in a critical region.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because in the sequence, the fifth codon changes from Gly to Tyr. Gly is a small, non-reactive amino acid, while Tyr is larger and has a hydroxyl group. Maybe that disrupts the protein's structure.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant D) 4.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mutation in Mutant4 creates a stop codon in a different frame. But since all are in the same frame, that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the question is about knocking out the gene, which can be done by disrupting the reading frame or creating a stop codon. Since none of the mutations create a stop, perhaps the best option is the one that disrupts the most critical part.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Mutant4 because in the sequence, after the mutation, the codon becomes TAC, which is Tyr, but I don't know.

Wait, another angle: the anti-nutritional compound is synthesized by the gene product. To eliminate it, we need to stop the gene's function. So, any mutation that disrupts the gene's function would be acceptable.

Among the options, perhaps the one with the most disruptive mutation is the correct answer.

Looking at the options:

Mutant1: changes codon3 (Leu → Leu), codon4 (Leu → Arg).

Mutant2: codon3 (Leu → Leu), codon4 (Leu → Lys).

Mutant3: codon3 (Leu → Leu), codon4 (Leu → Arg), codon5 (Gly → Trp), codon6 (Gly → Val).

Mutant4: codon3 (Leu → Leu), codon4 (Leu → Arg), codon5 (Gly → Tyr).

So, Mutant3 has the most amino acid changes in the early part, but I'm not sure if that's the best choice.

Alternatively, perhaps Mutant4 is the best because it changes codon5 from Gly to Tyr. Gly is a very small residue, and changing it to a bulkier Tyr could disrupt the protein structure significantly.

So, perhaps the answer is D) Mutant4.


To determine which mutation most likely eliminates the anti-nutritional compound, we analyze the mutations in the first exon of the gene. The goal is to identify a mutation that disrupts the gene's function, either by introducing a premature stop codon or significantly altering the protein's structure.

### Key Observations:
1. **Intact Gene**: The sequence starts with `ATG` (start codon) and ends with `TGA` (stop codon). The first few codons are `ATG`, `TTT`, `CTC`, `GCT`, `GGT`, `ACT`, etc.
2. **Mutant Analysis**:
   - **Mutant 1**: Changes codons 3 (`CTC` → `CTA`, Leu → Leu) and 4 (`GCT` → `CGC`, Leu → Arg). No premature stop codon introduced.
   - **Mutant 2**: Changes codons 3 (`CTC` → `CTA`, Leu → Leu) and 4 (`GCT` → `AAG`, Leu → Lys). No premature stop codon introduced.
   - **Mutant 3**: Changes codons 3 (`CTC` → `TTT`, Leu → Leu), 4 (`GCT` → `CGC`, Leu → Arg), and 5 (`GGT` → `TGG`, Gly → Trp). Multiple amino acid changes, but no premature stop codon.
   - **Mutant 4**: Changes codons 3 (`CTC` → `TTT`, Leu → Leu), 4 (`GCT` → `CGC`, Leu → Arg), and 5 (`GGT` → `TAC`, Gly → Tyr). Significant amino acid changes, but no premature stop codon.

### Critical Analysis:
- None of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon (`TGA`, `TAG`, or `TAA`) before the original stop codon at the end of the sequence.
- All mutations are point substitutions, maintaining the same reading frame and length, so no frameshift occurs.
- The most disruptive mutation appears in **Mutant 4**, where codon 5 changes from `GGT` (Gly) to `TAC` (Tyr). This substitution replaces a small, non-reactive amino acid (Gly) with a bulkier, hydroxyl-containing amino acid (Tyr), which could significantly disrupt the protein's structure or function.

### Conclusion:
While none of the mutations introduce a premature stop codon, **Mutant 4** is the most likely to disrupt the gene's function due to the significant alteration in codon 5, making it the best candidate for eliminating the anti-nutritional compound.
