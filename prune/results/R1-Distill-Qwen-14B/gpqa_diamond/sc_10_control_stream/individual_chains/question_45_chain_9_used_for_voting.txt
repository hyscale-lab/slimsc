Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula given is E = (pi² ħ²)/(2mL²), but wait, that's probably the base energy for the first level. Oh right, the energy levels are proportional to n squared, where n is the quantum number. So each particle's energy would be E multiplied by n².

But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2. That means they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, right? So each quantum state can hold only one particle. But wait, spin-1/2 has two possible states, up and down. So for each spatial state (defined by n), there can be two particles with opposite spins.

So the particles are fermions, so their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But since they're in the same spatial state, the spatial part has to combine with the spin part to make the overall wavefunction antisymmetric. Hmm, but wait, in a 1D well, the spatial wavefunction is either symmetric or antisymmetric depending on the permutation of the particles. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Maybe I should focus on the Pauli principle aspect: each unique state (n, spin) can have at most one particle.

So the ground state would have the lowest possible energy with the particles filling up the lowest possible quantum numbers, considering their spin.

Let me think: for four particles, each can have two possible spins (up or down), so each n level can hold up to two particles.

So the ground state would have particles filling the lowest possible n values. Let's list the possible n and their capacities:

n=1: can hold 2 particles (since spin up and down)
n=2: same, 2 particles
n=3: 2 particles
n=4: 2 particles, etc.

But wait, since we have four particles, we need to fill up the lowest n's until all four are placed.

So let's count:

n=1: 2 particles → filled (2 out of 4)
n=2: 2 particles → filled (4 total). So all four are in n=1 and n=2. So the ground state has two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, no, because n=1 can take 2 particles, n=2 can take 2. So for four particles, all four can be in n=1 and n=2, each with two particles.

So the energies would be:

Each particle in n=1 has energy E*(1)^2 = E.
Each particle in n=2 has energy E*(2)^2 =4E.

So the total energy for the ground state is (2 * E) + (2 *4E) = 2E +8E=10E?

Wait, but wait a second. No, wait. The question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. So each of these is the total energy of the system.

Wait, no, no. Wait, no, the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system". So the system's energies are the sum of the individual particles' energies.

So the ground state is when the particles are in the lowest possible energy configuration.

As each n can hold two particles, the four particles would occupy n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So their energies are E, E, 4E,4E. Sum is 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but wait another thing. I might have gotten that wrong. Let me think again. Each particle has its own energy, but the total energy is the sum. So for four particles, two in n=1 (each E) and two in n=2 (each 4E). So total is 2*E + 2*4E = 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but wait, what's the first excited state? The first excited state would be the next possible configuration. Hmm, how to arrange the four particles in the next higher energy configuration?

In the ground state, the particles are in n=1 and n=2. To get the first excited state, we'd promote one of the particles from the highest occupied level to the next available level. Wait, but in the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2. So the next available is n=3.

So in the first excited state, perhaps one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, and another remains in n=2. Wait, but no, because the system's energy is the sum. So let's think about the possible configurations.

Wait, the first excited state would be the system where the particles are in the next possible energy levels. So what's the next possible arrangement.

Wait, another approach: for four particles, the possible fillings are:

Ground state: n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles) → Total energy = 2E + 8E =10E.

First excited state: What's the next possible way to fill the particles? Maybe one particle moves up to n=3.

But wait, the way to find the next higher energy is to fill as low as possible, but with minimal energy increase.

Wait, but since each level can hold two particles, any movement would need to be to the next available level.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state would have particles in n=1, n=1, n=2, n=3. Because two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3.

What would that sum be? 2E +4E + 9E =15E.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Because each particle must have a unique quantum state. Since they're spin-1/2, each spatial state (n) can have up to two particles (spin up and down). So the first two particles are in n=1, next two in n=2. That's the ground state.

For the first excited state, perhaps the next possible arrangement would have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Because we can't have more than two in any n level.

But wait, can we? Because n=2 is already filled with two particles. So to get another particle, it must go to n=3.

So the configuration would be:

n=1: 2 particles → 2 * E = 2E.
n=2: 2 particles → 2 *4E =8E.
Wait, but that's the ground state. Oh, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=2 is promoted to n=3. So we now have:

n=1: 2 particles → 2E.
n=2: 1 particle →4E.
n=3: 1 particle →9E.

Total energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

But wait, that's the first excited state. So the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E.

What about the second excited state? The next higher energy configuration. Let's see. The next arrangement would be having particles in n=1 (2), n=2 (2), and n=3 (0) → no, that's the ground state.

Wait, no, perhaps the second excited state would have particles in n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), and possibly n=4 (0). Wait, but we have four particles.

Wait, no, four particles would be: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So that's four. So the energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E. Wait, but that's the same as the first excited state. Hmm, that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when the third particle is in n=3 and the fourth in n=2. Wait, no, the first excited state should have a higher energy than the ground state, but the second excited state even higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let's think about the possible energy levels for four particles in a 1D box, considering the Pauli exclusion.

Each n can hold 2 particles (due to spin up and down).

So the four particles would fill the lowest two n levels.

Now, to find the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited.

Wait, the ground state is 2 particles in n=1 (2E) and 2 in n=2 (8E) → total 10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the particles from n=2 moves to n=3. So we have 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3.

So the energies would be 2E (n=1) +4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) → total 15E.

Wait, but with four particles, all placed in the lowest possible states, that's the ground state. The first excited state would have the next possible arrangement, which is moving one particle to the next available level.

So the ground state: 10E.

First excited: 15E.

What about the second excited state? That's the next higher energy. So perhaps moving another particle to a higher level, or maybe distributing the particles differently.

Wait, perhaps the next configuration is 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. But wait, n=2 is lower than n=3, so that can't be because you can't have a higher energy without filling the lower states first. So particles can't skip lower states and fill higher ones. So the next step is to have 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → 15E as before.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the possible total energies are the sum of the individual energies. So for four particles, the possible total energies would be the sum of n_i^2 E, where each n_i is a quantum number, each n can be used up to two times (since two particles per n).

So the possible ground state (lowest) is when two n=1 and two n=2: sum is 2*1 + 2*4 = 2 + 8=10 →10E.

The first excited state would be the next possible sum. Let me think, what is the next possible arrangement. Maybe two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Sum is 2*1 +1*4 +1*9= 2+4+9=15 →15E.

Then the next would be when all four are in n=1, but that's not possible since each n can hold two particles. So the next configuration would be two in n=1, two in n=3. That sum is 2*1 + 2*9= 2+18=20 →20E. Wait, but that's higher than 15E.

Wait, but that's not correct because n=2 is lower than n=3. So the system would prefer to fill n=2 before n=3. So the first excited state is 15E. Then the next excited state would be when you have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. Because n=4 is higher than n=3, but 1^2 +2^2 +3^2 +4^2? No, that's not the case because for four particles, the next step after having one in n=3 is perhaps putting another in n=3, but each n can hold two. So the second excited state might be 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3. So sum is 2*1 +2*9=2+18=20E.

Wait, but wait, could the second excited state have a higher energy than that? Let me think. The possible configurations after ground state (10E) are:

1) 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → sum=15E.

2) 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → sum=20E.

Which of these is lower? 15E is lower than 20E, so 15E is the first excited state, and 20E would be the second excited state.

But wait, wait, but in the first case, 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → sum 15E.

In the second case, 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3 → sum 20E.

But how does the system move from 15E to 20E? Because moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 would require more energy. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. That sum would be 2*1 +4 + 16=22E. But that's higher than 20E. So 20E is lower than 22E.

So the possible energies would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 20E (second excited).

Looking at the options:

Option B) 4E,10E,50E → no, 4 is lower than 10.

Option C)4E,10E,15E → sum 10 is ground, 15 first excited. But where's the second excited?

Option A)30E,39E,50E → no, higher than what we have.

Option D)10E,15E,18E → 10E ground,15 first, 18 second. But according to my calculation, the second excited state is 20E, which isn't in any of the options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energies differently. Let me see the possible options again.

The question is asking for the energies of the ground, first excited, and second excited states.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first excited state configuration. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the first excited state isn't 15E but something else.

Alternative approach: the ground state is 2 particles in n=1 (E each) and 2 in n=2 (4E each). So E_ground = 2E + 8E=10E.

Now, the first excited state would be the next possible arrangement, which would have the lowest possible energy higher than 10E.

The next arrangement would have the particles in the lowest possible states with minimal energy increase. So perhaps the lowest possible is to have three particles in n=1 and one in n=2. Wait, no, because each n can hold up to two particles due to spin. So n=1 can't have more than two, so this isn't possible. So that can't be the case.

Wait, another approach: the possible energy levels are E, 4E, 9E, 16E, etc. Each can take two particles. So for four particles, the possible configurations are:

1. n=1 (2), n=2 (2): sum 10E → ground.

2. n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1): sum 2E +4E +9E =15E → first excited.

3. n=1 (2), n=3 (2): sum 2E +18E=20E → second excited.

Wait, but the first excited state would be 15E, second 20E.

But looking at the options, none of them have 10,15,20. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the options are:

A)30E,39E,50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

So none of them have 10,15,20. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh wait, the question says four identical spin-1/2 particles. So each can have spin up or down, but are they fermions? Spin-1/2 implies they are fermions, so Pauli applies.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the well is one-dimensional, so the spatial wavefunction's symmetry is important. For identical spin-1/2 particles, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. The spatial part can be symmetric or antisymmetric, and the spin part must adjust to make the total antisymmetric.

But for two particles, if the spatial part is symmetric, the spin part must be antisymmetric (singlet), and vice versa.

But in a 1D box, the spatial wavefunctions are either even or odd functions when you swap the particles. Hmm, I'm not sure if this affects the Pauli filling in this context. Maybe for a 1D problem, the spin part doesn't affect the spatial filling beyond the maximum two per n. So perhaps each n can hold two particles, regardless of symmetry.

So perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that each n can hold two particles, so the four particles fill n=1 and n=2 as in the ground state.

Thus, the ground state energy is 10E.

The first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, so the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Sum is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state is when another particle is promoted to n=3 or to n=4?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, and none in n=2. Because with four particles, you can have 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3. So the sum would be 2E +2*9E= 2E +18E=20E.

But the question is about the first three states: ground, first excited, and second excited. So the energies would be 10E,15E,20E.

But none of the options have 10,15,20. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option D)10E,15E,18E.

So if the second excited state is 18E, how?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, so the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4. Sum is 2*1 +4 +16= 22E. No, 22 isn't an option.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2. Wait, but each n can take two, so n=3 can take two, but n=2 is already filled with two. So if I promote two particles from n=2 to n=3, but that leaves n=2 with zero. So configuration is 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3: sum 2+18=20E.

Hmm, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ground state. Maybe the ground state isn't 10E.

Alternative approach: each particle's energy is E times n squared.

But the system's energy is the sum of the individual energies.

So for four particles, the ground state is when all are in the lowest possible states.

n=1 can take two particles (since spin-1/2 allows two per n). So two in n=1 (E each) and two in n=2 (4E each). Sum is 2E +8E=10E.

Now, the first excited state: the lowest possible energy higher than 10E.

That would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3. So the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.

Sum: 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Second excited state: what's the next step? It could be either two particles in n=3, which would require promoting two from n=2. So configuration is two in n=1, two in n=3. Sum is 2E +2*9E=2+18=20E.

But again, this isn't in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle moves to n=4. So configuration: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. Sum=2E+4E+16E=22E.

But that's not in the options either.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a scenario where the particles are arranged in n=1, n=2, n=3, and n=4, but that would require four different n's, which would be 1,4,9,16. Sum is 1+4+9+16=30E. But that would be for four particles each in different n's, but each n can take two, so no, that's not the case. Wait, no, because each n can hold two. So for four particles, the first two in n=1, next two in n=2, then you don't need higher n's.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A)30E,39E,50E → 30 is 5*6, but perhaps 5^2 is 25, so 25E is 25, which isn't in A.

B)4E,10E,50E → 4 is n=2, but 10E is the ground state.

C)4E,10E,15E → 4E would be the energy of a single particle in n=2. But the system has four particles, so the ground state can't be 4E. Only if all four are in n=1, but n=1 can hold two, so that's impossible. So option C is not possible.

D)10E,15E,18E → 10 as ground, 15 as first excited, 18 as second. How could 18E be achieved?

18E would be 2E +4E +9E +3E? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the configuration is two in n=1 (E each), one in n=2 (4E), and one in n=4 (16E). Sum is 2+4+16=22E, which isn't 18E.

Wait, another possibility: 2 in n=1 (2E), 1 in n=2 (4E), and 1 in n=3 (9E). Sum is 2+4+9=15E. Then the next would be 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3 → 2+18=20E.

But D's second excited is 18E, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the system allows for higher spin contributions, but I don't think so because spin doesn't contribute to the energy in this case.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the sum of the individual energies but about the energies of the states in terms of E. So each state's energy is n² E.

So the ground state would have the four particles in the lowest possible n's, which is two in n=1 and two in n=2, as before. So the system's total energy is 10E.

The first excited state would have the particles in the next available arrangement: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Sum is 15E.

The second excited state would be two in n=1, two in n=3. Sum is 20E.

But the options don't have 20E.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the energies of the individual particles, not the sum of the system. No, the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E."

So, the system's energy is the sum.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial assumption about the ground state. Maybe the particles are not all in the lowest possible n's due to Pauli's exclusion.

Wait, wait, no. The Pauli exclusion allows two particles per n, so four particles will fill n=1 and n=2, leading to a sum of 10E.

I think the correct sequence is 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 20E (second excited). But since none of the options match, perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, looking at option D: 10E,15E,18E. Where would 18E come from?

18E = 2*9E. So perhaps two particles are in n=3. So the configuration is two in n=1, two in n=3. Sum 2E+18E=20E. No, that's 20E.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=2 and one in n=4.

So configuration: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. Sum is 2E +4E+16E=22E. Not in options.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state isn't 15E. Let me think differently: what if the particles are arranged in n=1, n=1, n=2, n=2 → sum 10E. The first excited state could be n=1, n=1, n=2, n=3 → sum 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would be n=1, n=2, n=2, n=3 → sum 2E+4E+4E +9E=19E. No, but 19 isn't in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4 → sum 1+4+9+16=30E. But that's option A's ground state.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me look for another approach.

Each particle contributes n² E to the total. For four particles, the sum is the sum of four n² terms.

In the ground state, the four n's are as low as possible, so two 1's and two 2's: sum 1+1+4+4=10.

In the first excited state, the next possible arrangement would be two 1's, one 2, and one 3: sum 1+1+4+9=15.

Second excited state would be two 1's, one 2, and one 4: sum 1+1+4+16=22. Or two 1's, two 3's: 1+1+9+9=20.

Wait, but option D's second excited is 18, which is 2*9=18. So perhaps two in n=3, but that would require two particles in n=3, which can be done only if all four are in n=1 and n=3: two in 1, two in 3 → sum 2+18=20E.

Hmm, but 18E isn't appearing. Unless I'm missing something about the spin.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering spin when filling the levels. Wait, no, because the particles are spin-1/2, so each n can hold two particles.

Wait, maybe I should think about the problem in terms of adding the energies as the sum of the four particles' individual energies.

So, ground state: two at n=1 → E each, two at n=2 →4E each. Sum is 2E +8E=10E.

First excited state: two at n=1, one at n=2, one at n=3. Sum is 2E+4E+9E=15E.

Second excited state: two at n=1, two at n=3. Sum 2E+ 2*9E=2E +18E=20E.

But none of the options have 10,15,20.

Wait, but the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the correct option isn't among the choices, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state isn't 15E but 30E. No, that's not possible.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the particles are placed in the lowest energy levels considering multiple quantum numbers. For four particles, perhaps the ground state isn't 10E. Let me imagine that the four particles are in n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4. So each in a different n. Sum would be 1+4+9+16=30E. But that can't be the ground state because you can have two in each lower n. So that's higher energy.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D:10E,15E,18E.

Wait, 18E = 2*9E. So perhaps two particles in n=3, and the other two in n=1. So sum is 2E +18E=20E. But 18E isn't matching any options except option D's second excited state.

Wait, option D's second excited state is 18E, which would imply that the sum is 18E. How?

If the four particles have energies E, E, 9E, 9E. Sum is 2E +18E=20E.

But then why is the option 18E? That would imply that the system's energy is 18E, which isn't the case unless two particles are in n=3 (9E) and the other two are in n=0 or something, which isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm counting something wrong. Another Approach:

Each n can hold two particles. So four particles would occupy n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4 each with one particle. Wait, no, because each n can hold two. So perhaps two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3.

Wait, but that's what I thought before, giving sum 15E. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the sum of each state, not the sum of all particles. No, the question asks for the system's energy.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A)30,39,50 → perhaps sum when all are in high n's.

B)4,10,50 → perhaps no.

C)4,10,15 → seems wrong because 4 is lower than 10, but 4E would be two particles in n=2 (each 4E) → sum 8E, but that's not matching.

D)10,15,18 → possible.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, and two in n=2. But n=2 can hold two, so that would be two in n=2, two in n=3. Sum is 8E + 18E=26E. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=2 and another in n=3, but that's sum 4E +9E=13E. But that's per particle, and the sum would be 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Hmm, I'm not getting any closer. Maybe I should pick the option that has 10,15, and another number. Option D has 10,15,18. So perhaps the second excited state is 18E, which would be two particles in n=3 (9E each) and two in n=0, which isn't possible. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when three particles are in n=2 and one in n=3. But n=2 can only hold two, so that's impossible.

I'm really stuck here. Given the options, I think the correct answer must be option D:10E,15E,18E.

Wait, but I can't see how 18E would be achieved. Unless the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. Sum would be 2E +4E +16E=22E, which isn't an option.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4. So 2E (n=1) +4E (n=2) +16E (n=4) = 22E. Still not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2, but that's three particles, and the fourth would be in n=1. So sum would be E (n=1) +4E (n=2) + 9E (n=3) *2 → total E +4E +18E=23E. Not matching.

I think I'm going in circles. Given the options, the only one that starts with 10E is option D. So I'll go with D:10E,15E,18E.

To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Well**:  
   The energy levels for a particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by:  
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E, \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
   \]  
   Each energy level \( n \) can hold up to two particles due to the spin-1/2 nature of the particles (Pauli exclusion principle).

2. **Ground State Configuration**:  
   In the ground state, the four particles fill the lowest available energy levels. Since each \( n \) can hold two particles, the configuration is:  
   - Two particles in \( n = 1 \) (\( E_1 = E \)), and  
   - Two particles in \( n = 2 \) (\( E_2 = 4E \)).  
   The total energy of the system is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 8E = 10E.
   \]

3. **First Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n = 2 \) to \( n = 3 \). The configuration becomes:  
   - Two particles in \( n = 1 \) (\( E_1 = E \)),  
   - One particle in \( n = 2 \) (\( E_2 = 4E \)), and  
   - One particle in \( n = 3 \) (\( E_3 = 9E \)).  
   The total energy of the system is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
   \]

4. **Second Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n = 2 \) to \( n = 4 \). The configuration becomes:  
   - Two particles in \( n = 1 \) (\( E_1 = E \)),  
   - One particle in \( n = 2 \) (\( E_2 = 4E \)), and  
   - One particle in \( n = 4 \) (\( E_4 = 16E \)).  
   The total energy of the system is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_4 = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.
   \]  
   However, none of the provided options match this result. Reassessing the options, the closest match is **Option D**, which lists the energies as \( 10E, 15E, 18E \). While \( 18E \) does not align with the calculated value of \( 22E \), it is the most reasonable choice among the given options.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (30E, 39E, 50E)**: These values are too high and do not correspond to the calculated energies.  
- **Option B (4E, 10E, 50E)**: The ground state energy of \( 10E \) is correct, but \( 4E \) and \( 50E \) do not match the expected values for the first and second excited states.  
- **Option C (4E, 10E, 15E)**: Similar to Option B, \( 4E \) is incorrect, and \( 15E \) represents the first excited state, not the second.  
- **Option D (10E, 15E, 18E)**: The ground state (\( 10E \)) and first excited state (\( 15E \)) are correct. While \( 18E \) does not match the calculated \( 22E \), it is the closest match among the options.

### Conclusion:
The most reasonable answer, based on the given options, is **Option D**.  

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well. Hmm, I remember that in a 1D infinite well, the energy levels are quantized. The formula given is E = (pi² ħ²)/(2mL²), but wait, that's probably the base energy for the first level. Oh right, the energy levels are proportional to n squared, where n is the quantum number. So each particle's energy would be E multiplied by n².

But wait, the particles are identical and spin-1/2. That means they must obey the Pauli exclusion principle, right? So each quantum state can hold only one particle. But wait, spin-1/2 has two possible states, up and down. So for each spatial state (defined by n), there can be two particles with opposite spins.

So the particles are fermions, so their total wavefunction must be antisymmetric. But since they're in the same spatial state, the spatial part has to combine with the spin part to make the overall wavefunction antisymmetric. Hmm, but wait, in a 1D well, the spatial wavefunction is either symmetric or antisymmetric depending on the permutation of the particles. But I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Maybe I should focus on the Pauli principle aspect: each unique state (n, spin) can have at most one particle.

So the ground state would have the lowest possible energy with the particles filling up the lowest possible quantum numbers, considering their spin.

Let me think: for four particles, each can have two possible spins (up or down), so each n level can hold up to two particles.

So the ground state would have particles filling the lowest possible n values. Let's list the possible n and their capacities:

n=1: can hold 2 particles (since spin up and down)
n=2: same, 2 particles
n=3: 2 particles
n=4: 2 particles, etc.

But wait, since we have four particles, we need to fill up the lowest n's until all four are placed.

So let's count:

n=1: 2 particles → filled (2 out of 4)
n=2: 2 particles → filled (4 total). So all four are in n=1 and n=2. So the ground state has two particles in n=1 and two in n=2.

Wait, no, because n=1 can take 2 particles, n=2 can take 2. So for four particles, all four can be in n=1 and n=2, each with two particles.

So the energies would be:

Each particle in n=1 has energy E*(1)^2 = E.
Each particle in n=2 has energy E*(2)^2 =4E.

So the total energy for the ground state is (2 * E) + (2 *4E) = 2E +8E=10E?

Wait, but wait a second. No, wait. The question is about the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system. So each of these is the total energy of the system.

Wait, no, no. Wait, no, the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system". So the system's energies are the sum of the individual particles' energies.

So the ground state is when the particles are in the lowest possible energy configuration.

As each n can hold two particles, the four particles would occupy n=1 (2 particles) and n=2 (2 particles). So their energies are E, E, 4E,4E. Sum is 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but wait another thing. I might have gotten that wrong. Let me think again. Each particle has its own energy, but the total energy is the sum. So for four particles, two in n=1 (each E) and two in n=2 (each 4E). So total is 2*E + 2*4E = 2E +8E=10E. So the ground state energy is 10E.

Wait, but wait, what's the first excited state? The first excited state would be the next possible configuration. Hmm, how to arrange the four particles in the next higher energy configuration?

In the ground state, the particles are in n=1 and n=2. To get the first excited state, we'd promote one of the particles from the highest occupied level to the next available level. Wait, but in the ground state, the highest occupied level is n=2. So the next available is n=3.

So in the first excited state, perhaps one of the n=2 particles moves to n=3, and another remains in n=2. Wait, but no, because the system's energy is the sum. So let's think about the possible configurations.

Wait, the first excited state would be the system where the particles are in the next possible energy levels. So what's the next possible arrangement.

Wait, another approach: for four particles, the possible fillings are:

Ground state: n=1 (2 particles), n=2 (2 particles) → Total energy = 2E + 8E =10E.

First excited state: What's the next possible way to fill the particles? Maybe one particle moves up to n=3.

But wait, the way to find the next higher energy is to fill as low as possible, but with minimal energy increase.

Wait, but since each level can hold two particles, any movement would need to be to the next available level.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state would have particles in n=1, n=1, n=2, n=3. Because two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3.

What would that sum be? 2E +4E + 9E =15E.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. Because each particle must have a unique quantum state. Since they're spin-1/2, each spatial state (n) can have up to two particles (spin up and down). So the first two particles are in n=1, next two in n=2. That's the ground state.

For the first excited state, perhaps the next possible arrangement would have two particles in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Because we can't have more than two in any n level.

But wait, can we? Because n=2 is already filled with two particles. So to get another particle, it must go to n=3.

So the configuration would be:

n=1: 2 particles → 2 * E = 2E.
n=2: 2 particles → 2 *4E =8E.
Wait, but that's the ground state. Oh, I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state is when one of the particles in n=2 is promoted to n=3. So we now have:

n=1: 2 particles → 2E.
n=2: 1 particle →4E.
n=3: 1 particle →9E.

Total energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E.

But wait, that's the first excited state. So the ground state is 10E, first excited is 15E.

What about the second excited state? The next higher energy configuration. Let's see. The next arrangement would be having particles in n=1 (2), n=2 (2), and n=3 (0) → no, that's the ground state.

Wait, no, perhaps the second excited state would have particles in n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1), and possibly n=4 (0). Wait, but we have four particles.

Wait, no, four particles would be: n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). So that's four. So the energy is 2E +4E +9E =15E. Wait, but that's the same as the first excited state. Hmm, that can't be right.

Alternatively, maybe the first excited state is when the third particle is in n=3 and the fourth in n=2. Wait, no, the first excited state should have a higher energy than the ground state, but the second excited state even higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let's think about the possible energy levels for four particles in a 1D box, considering the Pauli exclusion.

Each n can hold 2 particles (due to spin up and down).

So the four particles would fill the lowest two n levels.

Now, to find the energies of the ground state, first excited, and second excited.

Wait, the ground state is 2 particles in n=1 (2E) and 2 in n=2 (8E) → total 10E.

The first excited state would be when one of the particles from n=2 moves to n=3. So we have 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3.

So the energies would be 2E (n=1) +4E (n=2) +9E (n=3) → total 15E.

Wait, but with four particles, all placed in the lowest possible states, that's the ground state. The first excited state would have the next possible arrangement, which is moving one particle to the next available level.

So the ground state: 10E.

First excited: 15E.

What about the second excited state? That's the next higher energy. So perhaps moving another particle to a higher level, or maybe distributing the particles differently.

Wait, perhaps the next configuration is 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3. But wait, n=2 is lower than n=3, so that can't be because you can't have a higher energy without filling the lower states first. So particles can't skip lower states and fill higher ones. So the next step is to have 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → 15E as before.

Wait, perhaps another approach: the possible total energies are the sum of the individual energies. So for four particles, the possible total energies would be the sum of n_i^2 E, where each n_i is a quantum number, each n can be used up to two times (since two particles per n).

So the possible ground state (lowest) is when two n=1 and two n=2: sum is 2*1 + 2*4 = 2 + 8=10 →10E.

The first excited state would be the next possible sum. Let me think, what is the next possible arrangement. Maybe two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3. Sum is 2*1 +1*4 +1*9= 2+4+9=15 →15E.

Then the next would be when all four are in n=1, but that's not possible since each n can hold two particles. So the next configuration would be two in n=1, two in n=3. That sum is 2*1 + 2*9= 2+18=20 →20E. Wait, but that's higher than 15E.

Wait, but that's not correct because n=2 is lower than n=3. So the system would prefer to fill n=2 before n=3. So the first excited state is 15E. Then the next excited state would be when you have two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. Because n=4 is higher than n=3, but 1^2 +2^2 +3^2 +4^2? No, that's not the case because for four particles, the next step after having one in n=3 is perhaps putting another in n=3, but each n can hold two. So the second excited state might be 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3. So sum is 2*1 +2*9=2+18=20E.

Wait, but wait, could the second excited state have a higher energy than that? Let me think. The possible configurations after ground state (10E) are:

1) 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → sum=15E.

2) 2 in n=1, 0 in n=2, 2 in n=3 → sum=20E.

Which of these is lower? 15E is lower than 20E, so 15E is the first excited state, and 20E would be the second excited state.

But wait, wait, but in the first case, 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=3 → sum 15E.

In the second case, 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3 → sum 20E.

But how does the system move from 15E to 20E? Because moving a particle from n=2 to n=3 would require more energy. Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. That sum would be 2*1 +4 + 16=22E. But that's higher than 20E. So 20E is lower than 22E.

So the possible energies would be 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 20E (second excited).

Looking at the options:

Option B) 4E,10E,50E → no, 4 is lower than 10.

Option C)4E,10E,15E → sum 10 is ground, 15 first excited. But where's the second excited?

Option A)30E,39E,50E → no, higher than what we have.

Option D)10E,15E,18E → 10E ground,15 first, 18 second. But according to my calculation, the second excited state is 20E, which isn't in any of the options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should think about the energies differently. Let me see the possible options again.

The question is asking for the energies of the ground, first excited, and second excited states.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first excited state configuration. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the first excited state isn't 15E but something else.

Alternative approach: the ground state is 2 particles in n=1 (E each) and 2 in n=2 (4E each). So E_ground = 2E + 8E=10E.

Now, the first excited state would be the next possible arrangement, which would have the lowest possible energy higher than 10E.

The next arrangement would have the particles in the lowest possible states with minimal energy increase. So perhaps the lowest possible is to have three particles in n=1 and one in n=2. Wait, no, because each n can hold up to two particles due to spin. So n=1 can't have more than two, so this isn't possible. So that can't be the case.

Wait, another approach: the possible energy levels are E, 4E, 9E, 16E, etc. Each can take two particles. So for four particles, the possible configurations are:

1. n=1 (2), n=2 (2): sum 10E → ground.

2. n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1): sum 2E +4E +9E =15E → first excited.

3. n=1 (2), n=3 (2): sum 2E +18E=20E → second excited.

Wait, but the first excited state would be 15E, second 20E.

But looking at the options, none of them have 10,15,20. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the options are:

A)30E,39E,50E

B)4E,10E,50E

C)4E,10E,15E

D)10E,15E,18E

So none of them have 10,15,20. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh wait, the question says four identical spin-1/2 particles. So each can have spin up or down, but are they fermions? Spin-1/2 implies they are fermions, so Pauli applies.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the well is one-dimensional, so the spatial wavefunction's symmetry is important. For identical spin-1/2 particles, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange. The spatial part can be symmetric or antisymmetric, and the spin part must adjust to make the total antisymmetric.

But for two particles, if the spatial part is symmetric, the spin part must be antisymmetric (singlet), and vice versa.

But in a 1D box, the spatial wavefunctions are either even or odd functions when you swap the particles. Hmm, I'm not sure if this affects the Pauli filling in this context. Maybe for a 1D problem, the spin part doesn't affect the spatial filling beyond the maximum two per n. So perhaps each n can hold two particles, regardless of symmetry.

So perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that each n can hold two particles, so the four particles fill n=1 and n=2 as in the ground state.

Thus, the ground state energy is 10E.

The first excited state is when one particle is promoted to n=3, so the configuration is n=1 (2), n=2 (1), n=3 (1). Sum is 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state is when another particle is promoted to n=3 or to n=4?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, and none in n=2. Because with four particles, you can have 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3. So the sum would be 2E +2*9E= 2E +18E=20E.

But the question is about the first three states: ground, first excited, and second excited. So the energies would be 10E,15E,20E.

But none of the options have 10,15,20. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option D)10E,15E,18E.

So if the second excited state is 18E, how?

Wait, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4, so the configuration is 2 in n=1, 1 in n=2, 1 in n=4. Sum is 2*1 +4 +16= 22E. No, 22 isn't an option.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2. Wait, but each n can take two, so n=3 can take two, but n=2 is already filled with two. So if I promote two particles from n=2 to n=3, but that leaves n=2 with zero. So configuration is 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3: sum 2+18=20E.

Hmm, but none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the ground state. Maybe the ground state isn't 10E.

Alternative approach: each particle's energy is E times n squared.

But the system's energy is the sum of the individual energies.

So for four particles, the ground state is when all are in the lowest possible states.

n=1 can take two particles (since spin-1/2 allows two per n). So two in n=1 (E each) and two in n=2 (4E each). Sum is 2E +8E=10E.

Now, the first excited state: the lowest possible energy higher than 10E.

That would be when one of the particles in n=2 moves to n=3. So the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=3.

Sum: 2E +4E +9E =15E.

Second excited state: what's the next step? It could be either two particles in n=3, which would require promoting two from n=2. So configuration is two in n=1, two in n=3. Sum is 2E +2*9E=2+18=20E.

But again, this isn't in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when one particle moves to n=4. So configuration: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. Sum=2E+4E+16E=22E.

But that's not in the options either.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a scenario where the particles are arranged in n=1, n=2, n=3, and n=4, but that would require four different n's, which would be 1,4,9,16. Sum is 1+4+9+16=30E. But that would be for four particles each in different n's, but each n can take two, so no, that's not the case. Wait, no, because each n can hold two. So for four particles, the first two in n=1, next two in n=2, then you don't need higher n's.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A)30E,39E,50E → 30 is 5*6, but perhaps 5^2 is 25, so 25E is 25, which isn't in A.

B)4E,10E,50E → 4 is n=2, but 10E is the ground state.

C)4E,10E,15E → 4E would be the energy of a single particle in n=2. But the system has four particles, so the ground state can't be 4E. Only if all four are in n=1, but n=1 can hold two, so that's impossible. So option C is not possible.

D)10E,15E,18E → 10 as ground, 15 as first excited, 18 as second. How could 18E be achieved?

18E would be 2E +4E +9E +3E? No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the configuration is two in n=1 (E each), one in n=2 (4E), and one in n=4 (16E). Sum is 2+4+16=22E, which isn't 18E.

Wait, another possibility: 2 in n=1 (2E), 1 in n=2 (4E), and 1 in n=3 (9E). Sum is 2+4+9=15E. Then the next would be 2 in n=1, 2 in n=3 → 2+18=20E.

But D's second excited is 18E, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the system allows for higher spin contributions, but I don't think so because spin doesn't contribute to the energy in this case.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about the sum of the individual energies but about the energies of the states in terms of E. So each state's energy is n² E.

So the ground state would have the four particles in the lowest possible n's, which is two in n=1 and two in n=2, as before. So the system's total energy is 10E.

The first excited state would have the particles in the next available arrangement: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3. Sum is 15E.

The second excited state would be two in n=1, two in n=3. Sum is 20E.

But the options don't have 20E.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the energies of the individual particles, not the sum of the system. No, the question says "energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state of the system in terms of energy E."

So, the system's energy is the sum.

Hmm, perhaps I've made a mistake in the initial assumption about the ground state. Maybe the particles are not all in the lowest possible n's due to Pauli's exclusion.

Wait, wait, no. The Pauli exclusion allows two particles per n, so four particles will fill n=1 and n=2, leading to a sum of 10E.

I think the correct sequence is 10E (ground), 15E (first excited), 20E (second excited). But since none of the options match, perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, looking at option D: 10E,15E,18E. Where would 18E come from?

18E = 2*9E. So perhaps two particles are in n=3. So the configuration is two in n=1, two in n=3. Sum 2E+18E=20E. No, that's 20E.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=2 and one in n=4.

So configuration: two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=4. Sum is 2E +4E+16E=22E. Not in options.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state isn't 15E. Let me think differently: what if the particles are arranged in n=1, n=1, n=2, n=2 → sum 10E. The first excited state could be n=1, n=1, n=2, n=3 → sum 2E +4E +9E=15E.

The second excited state would be n=1, n=2, n=2, n=3 → sum 2E+4E+4E +9E=19E. No, but 19 isn't in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4 → sum 1+4+9+16=30E. But that's option A's ground state.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me look for another approach.

Each particle contributes n² E to the total. For four particles, the sum is the sum of four n² terms.

In the ground state, the four n's are as low as possible, so two 1's and two 2's: sum 1+1+4+4=10.

In the first excited state, the next possible arrangement would be two 1's, one 2, and one 3: sum 1+1+4+9=15.

Second excited state would be two 1's, one 2, and one 4: sum 1+1+4+16=22. Or two 1's, two 3's: 1+1+9+9=20.

Wait, but option D's second excited is 18, which is 2*9=18. So perhaps two in n=3, but that would require two particles in n=3, which can be done only if all four are in n=1 and n=3: two in 1, two in 3 → sum 2+18=20E.

Hmm, but 18E isn't appearing. Unless I'm missing something about the spin.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering spin when filling the levels. Wait, no, because the particles are spin-1/2, so each n can hold two particles.

Wait, maybe I should think about the problem in terms of adding the energies as the sum of the four particles' individual energies.

So, ground state: two at n=1 → E each, two at n=2 →4E each. Sum is 2E +8E=10E.

First excited state: two at n=1, one at n=2, one at n=3. Sum is 2E+4E+9E=15E.

Second excited state: two at n=1, two at n=3. Sum 2E+ 2*9E=2E +18E=20E.

But none of the options have 10,15,20.

Wait, but the options don't have 20E. So perhaps the correct option isn't among the choices, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the first excited state isn't 15E but 30E. No, that's not possible.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the particles are placed in the lowest energy levels considering multiple quantum numbers. For four particles, perhaps the ground state isn't 10E. Let me imagine that the four particles are in n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4. So each in a different n. Sum would be 1+4+9+16=30E. But that can't be the ground state because you can have two in each lower n. So that's higher energy.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option D:10E,15E,18E.

Wait, 18E = 2*9E. So perhaps two particles in n=3, and the other two in n=1. So sum is 2E +18E=20E. But 18E isn't matching any options except option D's second excited state.

Wait, option D's second excited state is 18E, which would imply that the sum is 18E. How?

If the four particles have energies E, E, 9E, 9E. Sum is 2E +18E=20E.

But then why is the option 18E? That would imply that the system's energy is 18E, which isn't the case unless two particles are in n=3 (9E) and the other two are in n=0 or something, which isn't possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm counting something wrong. Another Approach:

Each n can hold two particles. So four particles would occupy n=1, n=2, n=3, n=4 each with one particle. Wait, no, because each n can hold two. So perhaps two in n=1, one in n=2, one in n=3.

Wait, but that's what I thought before, giving sum 15E. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering only the sum of each state, not the sum of all particles. No, the question asks for the system's energy.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

The options are:

A)30,39,50 → perhaps sum when all are in high n's.

B)4,10,50 → perhaps no.

C)4,10,15 → seems wrong because 4 is lower than 10, but 4E would be two particles in n=2 (each 4E) → sum 8E, but that's not matching.

D)10,15,18 → possible.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3, and two in n=2. But n=2 can hold two, so that would be two in n=2, two in n=3. Sum is 8E + 18E=26E. Not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the first excited state is when one particle is in n=2 and another in n=3, but that's sum 4E +9E=13E. But that's per particle, and the sum would be 2E +4E +9E=15E.

Hmm, I'm not getting any closer. Maybe I should pick the option that has 10,15, and another number. Option D has 10,15,18. So perhaps the second excited state is 18E, which would be two particles in n=3 (9E each) and two in n=0, which isn't possible. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the second excited state is when three particles are in n=2 and one in n=3. But n=2 can only hold two, so that's impossible.

I'm really stuck here. Given the options, I think the correct answer must be option D:10E,15E,18E.

Wait, but I can't see how 18E would be achieved. Unless the configuration is two in n=1, one in n=2, and one in n=4. Sum would be 2E +4E +16E=22E, which isn't an option.

Wait, maybe the second excited state is when one particle is in n=4. So 2E (n=1) +4E (n=2) +16E (n=4) = 22E. Still not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the second excited state is when two particles are in n=3 and one in n=2, but that's three particles, and the fourth would be in n=1. So sum would be E (n=1) +4E (n=2) + 9E (n=3) *2 → total E +4E +18E=23E. Not matching.

I think I'm going in circles. Given the options, the only one that starts with 10E is option D. So I'll go with D:10E,15E,18E.


To determine the energies of the ground state, first excited state, and second excited state for four identical spin-1/2 particles in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, we analyze the system as follows:

1. **Energy Levels in a 1D Infinite Well**:  
   The energy levels for a particle in a 1D infinite potential well are given by:  
   \[
   E_n = n^2 E, \quad \text{where } E = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}.
   \]  
   Each energy level \( n \) can hold up to two particles due to the spin-1/2 nature of the particles (Pauli exclusion principle).

2. **Ground State Configuration**:  
   In the ground state, the four particles fill the lowest available energy levels. Since each \( n \) can hold two particles, the configuration is:  
   - Two particles in \( n = 1 \) (\( E_1 = E \)), and  
   - Two particles in \( n = 2 \) (\( E_2 = 4E \)).  
   The total energy of the system is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{ground}} = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2E + 8E = 10E.
   \]

3. **First Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the first excited state, one particle is promoted from \( n = 2 \) to \( n = 3 \). The configuration becomes:  
   - Two particles in \( n = 1 \) (\( E_1 = E \)),  
   - One particle in \( n = 2 \) (\( E_2 = 4E \)), and  
   - One particle in \( n = 3 \) (\( E_3 = 9E \)).  
   The total energy of the system is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{first excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_3 = 2E + 4E + 9E = 15E.
   \]

4. **Second Excited State Configuration**:  
   In the second excited state, another particle is promoted from \( n = 2 \) to \( n = 4 \). The configuration becomes:  
   - Two particles in \( n = 1 \) (\( E_1 = E \)),  
   - One particle in \( n = 2 \) (\( E_2 = 4E \)), and  
   - One particle in \( n = 4 \) (\( E_4 = 16E \)).  
   The total energy of the system is:  
   \[
   E_{\text{second excited}} = 2E_1 + E_2 + E_4 = 2E + 4E + 16E = 22E.
   \]  
   However, none of the provided options match this result. Reassessing the options, the closest match is **Option D**, which lists the energies as \( 10E, 15E, 18E \). While \( 18E \) does not align with the calculated value of \( 22E \), it is the most reasonable choice among the given options.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A (30E, 39E, 50E)**: These values are too high and do not correspond to the calculated energies.  
- **Option B (4E, 10E, 50E)**: The ground state energy of \( 10E \) is correct, but \( 4E \) and \( 50E \) do not match the expected values for the first and second excited states.  
- **Option C (4E, 10E, 15E)**: Similar to Option B, \( 4E \) is incorrect, and \( 15E \) represents the first excited state, not the second.  
- **Option D (10E, 15E, 18E)**: The ground state (\( 10E \)) and first excited state (\( 15E \)) are correct. While \( 18E \) does not match the calculated \( 22E \), it is the closest match among the options.

### Conclusion:
The most reasonable answer, based on the given options, is **Option D**.
