Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem to solve. Hmm, let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the probability of measuring a certain observable and getting a specific outcome. I remember that in quantum mechanics, observables are represented by operators, and the probabilities come from the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of those operators.

So the state of the system at time t is given as a column matrix with elements (-1, 2, 1). Wait, is that a normalized vector? I should check. The state vector in quantum mechanics must be normalized, which means the sum of the squares of its components must be 1. Let's calculate that.

The components are -1, 2, and 1. So the squares are 1, 4, and 1. Adding them gives 6. Oh, that's not 1. So the state is not normalized. I think I need to normalize it before proceeding. So the magnitude is sqrt(6), right? Therefore, the normalized state would have each component divided by sqrt(6). So the state vector becomes (-1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6)).

Next, the observable is given by matrix P. Let me write that down. P is a 3x3 matrix where the first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Wait a minute, that's an interesting structure. I wonder what the eigenvalues of this matrix are. Because the possible outcomes of the measurement are the eigenvalues of P.

I need to find the eigenvalues of P. But how? Let me recall that the eigenvalues are found by solving the characteristic equation det(P - λI) = 0.

So, the matrix P - λI would be:

Row 1: [ -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]

Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2) ]

Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ ]

Hmm, calculating the determinant of this matrix. Let me try expanding it. The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] 
- (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ] 
+ 0 * [ ... ] (since the third term is zero, I can ignore it)

Wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step. Alternatively, maybe I can find the eigenvalues another way because this matrix might have a specific structure. It looks like it's symmetric, so it should have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

Alternatively, maybe I can guess the eigenvalues. Let me see if there's a pattern. If I look at P, it's a symmetric matrix with 0s on the diagonal except for -λ. Wait, no, in this case, the diagonal entries are all -λ in the equation (P - λI). Wait, no, the original P has all diagonal entries as 0, right? Because looking at P:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

So yes, diagonal elements are 0. So when I subtract λI, the diagonals become -λ.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant.

The determinant for a 3x3 matrix is:

a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:

a b c

d e f

g h i

So, using this notation, the elements of (P - λI) are as follows:

a = -λ, b = 1/sqrt(2), c = 0

d = 1/sqrt(2), e = -λ, f = 1/sqrt(2)

g = 0, h = 1/sqrt(2), i = -λ

So, determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] 
- (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ] 
+ 0 * [ ... ]

So let's compute each term:

First term: -λ * [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (-λ)/sqrt(2) ] = - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) ) = (λ * 1/2 )

Third term is zero.

So the determinant equation becomes:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) = 0

Let me expand this:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) =0

Wait, wait. Let's see: -λ*(λ² - 1/2) is -λ^3 + (λ/2), then adding the second term (λ/2), so total is -λ^3 + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ.

So equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0 => λ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0.

So the solutions are λ = 0, and λ² = 1 => λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues are λ = 0, 1, -1.

Wait, so the possible outcomes when measuring the observable P are 0, 1, and -1. The question is asking for the probability of getting 0.

So, to find the probability, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0, and then project the state onto that eigenvector. The square of the absolute value of that projection gives the probability.

So first, let me find the eigenvector for λ=0.

We can write (P - 0*I) |v> = 0, so P |v> = 0.

So, the matrix P is:

0      1/sqrt(2)   0

1/sqrt(2) 0      1/sqrt(2)

0      1/sqrt(2)   0

We can write the equations P|v> = 0 as:

0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/sqrt(2)) v2 =0 → v2=0.

Second equation: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v1 = -v3.

Third equation: 0 v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 → again v2=0.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 must satisfy v2=0 and v1 = -v3.

Let me choose v3 as a parameter. Let v3 = a, then v1 = -a, and v2=0.

So the eigenvector can be written as ( -a, 0, a ) = a ( -1, 0, 1 ).

We can normalize this vector. The length squared is (-1)^2 + 0 + (1)^2 = 2 → length is sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) )^T.

Now, the state of the system is |ψ> = ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6) → ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

The probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |ψ> and the eigenvector |v> for λ=0.

Compute the inner product:

ψ · v = [ (-1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) ] + [ (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 ) ] + [ (1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Compute each term:

First term: (1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) = 1/sqrt(12) = sqrt(3)/(6*2) → wait, sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so 1/(2 sqrt(3)).

Third term: (1)/(sqrt(6) * sqrt(2)) ) = same as the first term, 1/(2 sqrt(3)).

So the inner product is (1/(2 sqrt(3))) + 0 + (1/(2 sqrt(3))) ) = 2/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = 1/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))² = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Wait, let me double-check. The inner product is ψ · v = [ (-1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ] + 0 + [ (1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ].

Compute each part:

(-1/sqrt(6))*(-1/sqrt(2)) = (1) / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) = 1/sqrt(12) = sqrt(12) /12 = (2 sqrt(3))/12 = sqrt(3)/6.

Similarly, (1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) = same as above, sqrt(3)/6.

Adding them gives 2 * sqrt(3)/6 = sqrt(3)/3.

Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because 1/sqrt(12) is 1/(2 sqrt(3)).

Wait, sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so 1/sqrt(12) is 1/(2 sqrt(3)).

So each term is 1/(2 sqrt(3)).

So adding two terms: 2/(2 sqrt(3)) = 1/sqrt(3).

So the inner product is 1/sqrt(3).

The square is (1/sqrt(3))² = 1/3.

Yes, that's correct.

So the probability is 1/3. Looking at the options, option C is 1/3. So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the outcome \( 0 \). The state of the system is given as \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \), but it is not normalized. The normalization factor is calculated as:

\[
\| |\psi\rangle \| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/\sqrt{6} \\ 2/\sqrt{6} \\ 1/\sqrt{6} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & 1/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\ 
1/\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\sqrt{2} \\ 
0 & 1/\sqrt{2} & 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

To find the probability of measuring \( 0 \), we need the eigenvector of \( P \) corresponding to the eigenvalue \( \lambda = 0 \). Solving \( P |v\rangle = 0 \), we find that the eigenvector satisfies \( v_2 = 0 \) and \( v_1 = -v_3 \). Choosing \( v_3 = a \), the eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = a \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Normalizing this vector, we get:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/\sqrt{2} \\ 0 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \( |\psi\rangle \) and \( |v\rangle \):

\[
\langle \psi | v \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\right)\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + \left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{6}}\right)(0) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle \psi | v \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} + 0 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
|\langle \psi | v \rangle|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

Next, the observable is given by matrix P. Let me write that down. P is a 3x3 matrix where the first row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0], the second row is [1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)], and the third row is [0, 1/sqrt(2), 0]. Wait a minute, that's an interesting structure.

So, the matrix P - λI would be:

Row 1: [ -λ, 1/sqrt(2), 0 ]

Row 2: [1/sqrt(2), -λ, 1/sqrt(2) ]

Row 3: [0, 1/sqrt(2), -λ ]

Hmm, calculating the determinant of this matrix. Let me try expanding it. The determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] 
- (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ] 
+ 0 * [ ... ] (since the third term is zero, I can ignore it)

Wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step. Alternatively, maybe I can find the eigenvalues another way because this matrix might have a specific structure. It looks like it's symmetric, so it should have real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors.

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2).

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0.

So yes, diagonal elements are 0. So when I subtract λI, the diagonals become -λ.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute the determinant.

The determinant for a 3x3 matrix is:

a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg)

Where the matrix is:

a b c

d e f

g h i

So, using this notation, the elements of (P - λI) are as follows:

a = -λ, b = 1/sqrt(2), c = 0

d = 1/sqrt(2), e = -λ, f = 1/sqrt(2)

g = 0, h = 1/sqrt(2), i = -λ

So, determinant is:

-λ * [ (-λ)(-λ) - (1/sqrt(2))(1/sqrt(2)) ] 
- (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (1/sqrt(2))*(-λ) - 0 ] 
+ 0 * [ ... ]

So let's compute each term:

First term: -λ * [ λ² - (1/2) ]

Second term: - (1/sqrt(2)) * [ (-λ)/sqrt(2) ] = - (1/sqrt(2)) * (-λ/sqrt(2)) ) = (λ * 1/2 )

Third term is zero.

So the determinant equation becomes:

-λ (λ² - 1/2) + (λ/2) = 0

Let me expand this:

-λ³ + (λ/2) + (λ/2) =0

Wait, wait. Let's see: -λ*(λ² - 1/2) is -λ^3 + (λ/2), then adding the second term (λ/2), so total is -λ^3 + λ/2 + λ/2 = -λ³ + λ.

So equation is -λ^3 + λ = 0 => λ( -λ² + 1 ) = 0.

So the solutions are λ = 0, and λ² = 1 => λ = ±1.

So the eigenvalues are λ = 0, 1, -1.

Wait, so the possible outcomes when measuring the observable P are 0, 1, and -1. The question is asking for the probability of getting 0.

So, to find the probability, I need to find the eigenvector corresponding to λ=0, and then project the state onto that eigenvector. The square of the absolute value of that projection gives the probability.

So first, let me find the eigenvector for λ=0.

We can write (P - 0*I) |v> = 0, so P |v> = 0.

So, the matrix P is:

0      1/sqrt(2)   0

1/sqrt(2) 0      1/sqrt(2)

0      1/sqrt(2)   0

We can write the equations P|v> = 0 as:

0*v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0*v3 = 0 → (1/sqrt(2)) v2 =0 → v2=0.

Second equation: (1/sqrt(2)) v1 + 0 v2 + (1/sqrt(2)) v3 = 0 → v1 + v3 = 0 → v1 = -v3.

Third equation: 0 v1 + (1/sqrt(2)) v2 + 0 v3 = 0 → again v2=0.

So the eigenvector for λ=0 must satisfy v2=0 and v1 = -v3.

Let me choose v3 as a parameter. Let v3 = a, then v1 = -a, and v2=0.

So the eigenvector can be written as ( -a, 0, a ) = a ( -1, 0, 1 ).

We can normalize this vector. The length squared is (-1)^2 + 0 + (1)^2 = 2 → length is sqrt(2). So the normalized eigenvector is ( -1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2) )^T.

Now, the state of the system is |ψ> = ( -1, 2, 1 ) / sqrt(6) → ( -1/sqrt(6), 2/sqrt(6), 1/sqrt(6) )^T.

The probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between |ψ> and the eigenvector |v> for λ=0.

Compute the inner product:

ψ · v = [ (-1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ) ] + [ (2/sqrt(6)) * 0 ) ] + [ (1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ) ]

Compute each term:

First term: (1)/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) = 1/sqrt(12) = sqrt(3)/(6*2) → wait, sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so 1/(2 sqrt(3)).

Third term: (1)/(sqrt(6) * sqrt(2)) ) = same as the first term, 1/(2 sqrt(3)).

So the inner product is (1/(2 sqrt(3))) + 0 + (1/(2 sqrt(3))) ) = 2/(2 sqrt(3)) ) = 1/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared is (1/sqrt(3))² = 1/3.

So the probability is 1/3.

Wait, let me double-check. The inner product is ψ · v = [ (-1/sqrt(6)) * (-1/sqrt(2)) ] + 0 + [ (1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) ].

Compute each part:

(-1/sqrt(6))*(-1/sqrt(2)) = (1) / (sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) = 1/sqrt(12) = sqrt(12) /12 = (2 sqrt(3))/12 = sqrt(3)/6.

Similarly, (1/sqrt(6)) * (1/sqrt(2)) = same as above, sqrt(3)/6.

Adding them gives 2 * sqrt(3)/6 = sqrt(3)/3.

Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, no, that can't be right. Because 1/sqrt(12) is 1/(2 sqrt(3)).

Wait, sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so 1/sqrt(12) is 1/(2 sqrt(3)).

So each term is 1/(2 sqrt(3)).

So adding two terms: 2/(2 sqrt(3)) = 1/sqrt(3).

So the inner product is 1/sqrt(3).

The square is (1/sqrt(3))² = 1/3.

Yes, that's correct.

So the probability is 1/3. Looking at the options, option C is 1/3. So the correct answer should be option C.


To solve the problem, we need to calculate the probability of measuring the observable \( P \) and obtaining the outcome \( 0 \). The state of the system is given as \( |\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \), but it is not normalized. The normalization factor is calculated as:

\[
\| |\psi\rangle \| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state is:

\[
|\psi\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/\sqrt{6} \\ 2/\sqrt{6} \\ 1/\sqrt{6} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The observable \( P \) is represented by the matrix:

\[
P = \begin{pmatrix} 
0 & 1/\sqrt{2} & 0 \\ 
1/\sqrt{2} & 0 & 1/\sqrt{2} \\ 
0 & 1/\sqrt{2} & 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
\]

To find the probability of measuring \( 0 \), we need the eigenvector of \( P \) corresponding to the eigenvalue \( \lambda = 0 \). Solving \( P |v\rangle = 0 \), we find that the eigenvector satisfies \( v_2 = 0 \) and \( v_1 = -v_3 \). Choosing \( v_3 = a \), the eigenvector is:

\[
|v\rangle = a \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Normalizing this vector, we get:

\[
|v\rangle = \begin{pmatrix} -1/\sqrt{2} \\ 0 \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The probability of measuring \( 0 \) is the square of the absolute value of the inner product between \( |\psi\rangle \) and \( |v\rangle \):

\[
\langle \psi | v \rangle = \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\right)\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) + \left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{6}}\right)(0) + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\langle \psi | v \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} + 0 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is:

\[
|\langle \psi | v \rangle|^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Thus, the probability of measuring \( 0 \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).
