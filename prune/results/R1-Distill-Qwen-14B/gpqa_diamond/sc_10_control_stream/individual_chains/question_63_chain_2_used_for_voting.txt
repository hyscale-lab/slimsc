Okay, so I've got this problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum models. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They mention the quantum rotation-vibration model, so I think that refers to the non-rigid rotor model, which accounts for both rotation and vibration. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, what's the fundamental state? Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the next state would be the first excited state. But which transition are we looking at here? Since it's a diatomic, I remember that the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational contributions.

In the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels have rotational parts, but the rigid rotor is usually a simpler case. Wait, but here it's non-rigid, so maybe the bond length isn't fixed. But for the purpose of calculating energy levels, perhaps the rigid rotor approximation is still used. I'm a bit confused, but let's proceed.

The molecule is in its ground state, which is the lowest vibrational and rotational state. To switch to the next lowest energy state, the photon would need to cause a transition. What's the next state? Well, the next in energy could be a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But which one is lower in energy? Because the order of energy levels depends on the specific molecule.

Wait, the quantum rotation-vibration model combines both rotation and vibration. The energy levels are given by some combination of vibrational and rotational quantum numbers. So the fundamental state is probably the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state would be the next higher energy state. Now, considering that in diatomic molecules, vibrational energy levels are generally more spaced out than rotational ones, but it also depends on the values of the constants involved.

Wait, no. Let me think. The spacing between vibrational levels is much larger than rotational because the vibrational energy depends on the square of the angular frequency, which is higher. So, going from v=0 to v=1 would require a photon with energy hν equal to the vibrational energy spacing. But if the question refers to the next state in the energy hierarchy, which could be the first excited rotational state (J=1) or the first excited vibrational state (v=1). So the question is, which transition has a lower photon energy?

Alternatively, perhaps the next state is a combination of both. But the problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. So the next state could be the first vibrational excited state (v=1, J=0) or the first rotational state (J=1, v=0). Which one has a lower energy?

Wait, the energy levels for a diatomic in the rotation-vibration model are given by:

E = E_vibrational + E_rotational

E_vibrational for the harmonic oscillator is (v + ½) hν
E_rotational for rigid rotor is (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

The question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one where the energy is just higher than the fundamental state. So which transition has a lower energy difference: from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1), or to (v=1, J=0)?

Let me compute both energy differences.

First, the energy difference for rotational transition: from J=0 to J=1.

E_rot_diff = E(J=1) - E(J=0) = [ (1*2) * ħ²/(2I) ] - 0 = (2 ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/(I)

The rotational energy is (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I). So from J=0 to J=1, the change is (2ħ²)/(2I) - 0 = ħ²/(I).

Now the vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1: E_vibr_diff = (1 + ½) hν - (0 + ½) hν = hν.

So which is smaller: the rotational energy difference or the vibrational?

Given that the vibrational frequency is given as w = 4e14 rad/s. Let me compute hν: h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. So hν = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = approx 2.65e-19 J.

Now compute the rotational energy difference. I is the moment of inertia, which is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

The masses are Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu. So reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) amu.

Calculating μ: (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22 ≈1.818 amu.

Convert amu to kg: 1 amu ≈ 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ =1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.022e-27 kg.

Wait, double-check the calculation: 20 *2 =40; 40/(22) is about 1.818. Yes.

So I = μ r² = 3.022e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.022e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2088e-46 kg·m².

Now, E_rot_diff = ħ²/(I) = (h/(2π))² / I.

Compute ħ: h/(2π) ≈6.626e-34/(6.283) ≈1.054e-33 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.054e-33)^2 ≈ 1.11e-66 J²·s².

E_rot_diff = 1.11e-66 / 1.2088e-46 ≈ (1.11 / 1.2088) * 1e-20 ≈ 0.918e-20 J, which is about 9.18e-21 J.

Compare to the vibrational energy difference: 2.65e-19 J.

So the rotational transition requires much less energy than the vibrational. That makes sense because rotational transitions usually have lower energy than vibrational for diatomic molecules (since ν is high, leading to large hν).

So the next state with the lowest possible energy is the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1. Therefore, the photon must supply energy equal to the rotational energy difference.

Wait, but wait. The question says, the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is v=0, J=0. The next state could be either v=1, J=0, or v=0, J=1. Which one has lower energy?

E_rot_diff is 9.18e-21 J, and E_vibr_diff is 2.65e-19 J. Since 9e-21 is much less than 2.65e-19, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon needed is for the rotational transition.

Wait, but in a diatomic molecule, the selection rules for rotational transitions usually require a change in J by ±1. So from J=0 to J=1. But the vibrational transition would require a change in v by ±1. But if the photon is absorbed, it can cause a transition either in rotation or vibration, whichever requires less energy.

But why would the question specify that it's the next state with the lowest possible energy? Because the rotational transition is lower in energy, that's the next state.

So the photon's energy must be equal to the rotational energy difference.

Energy of photon E_photon = E_rot_diff = ħ²/(I).

But wait, the question asks about the momentum of the photon. Oh right, because the photon's energy is related to its momentum p by E = pc.

So once we find E_photon, p = E_photon / c.

So E_photon is about 9.18e-21 J. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.18e-21 / 3e8 = approx 3.06e-29 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait, let's compute more accurately.

Wait, let's recheck the calculation of E_rot_diff.

Wait, I = μ r² = 3.022e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.022e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2088e-46 kg·m².

ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recompute.

Wait, no. Let me recalculate ħ²/(I):

ħ² is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approximately (1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

Wait no, J is kg m²/s², so ħ² is (J s)^2? Wait, perhaps I should be more precise.

Wait, ħ has units of J·s. So ħ² is (J² s²).

But I is in kg·m². So ħ²/(I) has units of (J² s²) / (kg m²). Let me see if that makes sense for energy.

Wait, 1 J = 1 kg m²/s². So J² s² = (kg² m^4/s^4) * s^2 )= kg² m^4 / s².

Divided by kg m²: (kg² m^4 / s²) / (kg m²) )= kg m² / s² = J.

So yes, the units work out. So E_rot_diff is in J.

So E_rot_diff = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.2088e-46) = ?

Let me compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx (1.0545718)^2 = 1.112, so 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 1.2088e-46.

So E_rot_diff = (1.112e-68) / (1.2088e-46) = approx 9.20e-23 J.

Wait, wait, that's different from my earlier calculation. Hmm, earlier I thought ħ was 1e-33 J s, then squared was 1e-66, divided by 1e-46 gave 1e-20. But with more accurate numbers, it's 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents earlier. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 1.0545718e-34 squared is 1.112e-68 (since 1e-34 squared is 1e-68).

Denominator I=1.2088e-46.

So 1.112e-68 / 1.2088e-46 = (1.112 / 1.2088) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.92 * 1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J.

So E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

Then the photon's momentum p is E/c. Since E = pc, so p = E/(c).

c is 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (9.2e-23) / (3e8) = 3.066e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but that's 3.066e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3.066e-31 N·s, since 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s.

Wait, that's 3.07e-31 N·s. But looking at the options, the closest is option D: 1.4e-28 Ns. Wait that's three orders of magnitude larger. Did I make a mistake?

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the reduced mass. Let me double-check.

The reduced mass μ for a diatomic molecule is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 *2) / (20 +2) =40/22=20/11≈1.818 amu.

Wait, converting to kg: 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So 1.818 amu is 1.818 *1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.022e-27 kg.

Wait, that part is correct. So I= μ r². r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m.

So I =3.022e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2=4e-20.

So I=3.022e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2088e-46 kg m².

That's correct. So I think the calculation is correct.

Wait, but E_rot_diff is 9.2e-23 J, so p = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options are A to D, and the smallest is D: 1.4e-28, which is about 100 times larger than my calculation.

Hmm... something's wrong here. Maybe I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, which could also be a combination of both rotational and vibrational transitions. Or perhaps the transition is from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0. That would require more energy than the rotational transition, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a vibration-rotation transition, but that would require more energy than rotational, so the photon's energy would be higher than E_rot_diff.

Wait but the question is about the photon's momentum, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another thought: perhaps the energy needed is the sum of the rotational and vibrational transition. No, wait, when the molecule is in the fundamental state, the next state would be either the first rotational level or the first vibrational level, whichever has lower energy.

Since the rotational transition is lower in energy, the photon should have the energy of that rotational transition.

But according to my calculation, the momentum is around 3e-31 Ns, but the options are higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for the rotational energy difference. Let me re-derive that.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ²)/(2I) * J(J+1).

So the transition from J=0 to J=1 is ΔE_rot = E(J=1) - E(J=0) = ( (1)(2) ħ²/(2I) ) - 0 = (2 ħ²)/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I).

Yes, that's correct. So E_rot_diff = ħ²/(I).

Wait, but perhaps I should use the moment of inertia differently. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, the bond length is 2 angstroms, correct. So r=2e-10 m.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) )=40/22 amu, so 1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = let's compute that.

1.818 *1.6605 is approx 2.999, so 3.0e-27 kg.

Ok, so I = μ r² = 3.0e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2e-46 kg m².

So ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So E_rot_diff = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.2e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (1.2e-46) )= approx 9.267e-23 J.

So p = E/c = 9.267e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.09e-31 kg m/s = 3.09e-31 Ns.

Hmm, but none of the options match this. The options go up to 2.3e-27, which is way bigger. Perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents in the calculation. Let's recompute:

(1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 = approx 1.112e-68.

Divide by I = 1.2e-46: 1.112e-68 / 1.2e-46 = (1.112 / 1.2) ) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.9267 * 1e-22 = 9.267e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct. So p = 9.267e-23 / 3e8 = 3.09e-31 Ns.

But the options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28

Hmm, none of these are close to 3e-31. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition, not the rotational. Wait, but the vibrational transition requires higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which could be a combination of both rotational and vibrational. But that would involve a photon with higher energy than either.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy. Let me think: for a rigid rotor, the energy levels are E_J = [ħ^2/(2I)] J(J+1). So the spacing between J and J+1 is [ħ^2/(2I)] ( (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) ) = [ħ^2/(2I)] (2J + 2 ) = [ħ^2 (J+1)] / I.

Wait, wait, for J=0 to J=1, ΔE_rot = E(1) - E(0) = [ (1)(2) ħ²/(2I) ) ] - 0 = (2 ħ²)/(2I) ) = ħ² / I.

Ah, so that part is correct. Then the calculation earlier stands.

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the next vibrational state but the rotational state is considered as well. Or perhaps I'm confusing the selection rules.

Wait, another thought: the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, which includes the vibration as part of the rotational state. So perhaps it's a different approach where the energy levels are treated as a combination of vibration and rotation.

But I'm not too familiar with the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, the rigid rotor model assumes bond length is fixed, but non-rigid allows bond length to vary, similar to the harmonic oscillator. So the energy levels might be a combination of rotation and vibration.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground vibrational state (v=0) to the first excited state (v=1), but with the lowest rotational state (J=0). That would be a pure vibrational transition.

Wait, but as I calculated earlier, the energy difference there is 2.65e-19 J, which is way larger than the rotational. So it would require a much higher energy photon.

But why isn't that the correct approach? The question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state, which would be v=0, J=0.

The next possible state, the lowest in energy, would be J=1, v=0. So the photon should provide energy for that transition.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Another way to approach it: let's compute the energy difference again.

E_rot_diff = ħ^2/(I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.2e-46)

Calculating numerator: 1.0545718e-34 squared.

1.0545718^2 is approximately 1.112.

So 1.112e-68.

Divide by 1.2e-46: 1.112e-68 / 1.2e-46 = (1.112/1.2) * 1e-22.

1.112/1.2 is approximately 0.9267, so 9.267e-23 J.

So E_photon =9.267e-23 J.

Momentum p = E/c =9.267e-23 / 3e8 = 3.089e-31 kg·m/s.

Which is 3.089e-31 N·s.

But this isn't any of the options given. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational energy as the required transition. Let me compute that.

E_vibr = hν = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 N·s. Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28. Close, but not quite.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which is the first vibrational state plus the first rotational state, but that would require more energy. No, the next lowest state is the rotational one.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the transition from the ground state to the first state where both J and v are excited, but that's probably not the case.

Wait another angle: perhaps the question is about the total energy of the molecule changing, but the photon's energy must match the transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition because the rotational transitions may require lower energy, but the photon's momentum is being calculated from the vibrational energy.

Wait, but the options don't match either. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the moment of inertia differently. Wait, the bond length is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So r=2e-10 m.

The reduced mass μ is correct (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) ) = 40/22 = 1.818 amu → 3.0e-27 kg.

So I = μ r² = 3e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2e-46 kg m².

Wait, maybe I should factor in the vibrational angular frequency. But why? Because the photon's energy is tied to the vibrational frequency, but the rotational transition is much lower.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state to the first vibrational state, but that would require a much higher energy photon.

But the options don't have such high values. Wait, option A is 1.9e-28 Ns, which is 1.9e-28 kg m/s.

If I compute p = 1.9e-28 Ns, then E = p c =1.9e-28 *3e8 =5.7e-20 J.

Which is about twice the E_rot_diff I calculated earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the rotational energy.

Wait, another approach: calculate the rotational energy difference in terms of angular frequency. The rotational energy levels are (J(J+1) ħ^2)/(2I).

So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is (2 ħ^2)/(2I) )= ħ^2/(I).

Which is the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the photon to have a momentum corresponding to the vibrational transition. Because the given options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range, which is close to what I get for E_rot_diff if I make a mistake in the exponent.

Let me check: 1e-23 J. So p = 1e-23 /3e8 = 3.3e-32 Ns. That's even smaller.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the reduced mass calculation.

Wait, Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Yes, correct. So in kg, 1.818 *1.6605e-27 = approx 3.022e-27 kg.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute using exact numbers.

Compute μ in kg:

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 amu =20/11 amu.

20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

1.81818 amu * 1.66053906660e-27 kg/amu ≈ 3.022e-27 kg.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy to be the sum of both rotational and vibrational transitions. But that seems unlikely, as the next state would be the lower of the two.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/2 somewhere. Let me think.

Wait, E_rot_diff is ħ^2/(I). Maybe the formula is (h^2)/(8 π² I) * (1/(J)(J+1)).

Wait, no, E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) * J(J+1) → ΔE = (ħ² / (2I)) [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) ] = (ħ²/(2I)) (2J +2) )= (ħ² (J+1) )/(I).

For J=0, ΔE= (ħ^2 (1) ) / I.

Which is the same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation points to p≈3e-31 Ns, but that's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state to the first vibrational state, but using the vibrational energy. Let me compute that.

E_vibr = h ν =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 Ns. Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half.

Wait, why would the photon's energy be half of E_vibr?

Oh! Because in vibrational transitions, the selection rule is Δv = ±1, and the energy change is from v=0 to v=1, which is from (1/2) hν to (3/2) hν. So the photon's energy is hν. So I think the calculation is correct.

So if the photon's energy is hν=2.65e-19 J, then p=8.83e-28 Ns. But the options don't have this exact value. Option A is 1.9e-28, which is roughly half.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using exact numbers.

Let me compute hν:

h=6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value).

ν=4e14 Hz.

hν=6.62607015e-34 *4e14 = 2.65042806e-19 J.

p = 2.65042806e-19 / (3e8) = 8.8347602e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, wait a second. Another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the total momentum imparted when the molecule absorbs a photon, but considering the reduced mass. Wait, but that doesn't change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's momentum in a different way. Photon momentum is p = E/c. So I think that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question refers to the rotational transition. But according to my calculation, that's about 3e-31 Ns, not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational energy but making a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute using exact numbers.

Wait, let me compute the rotational energy difference again.

E_rot_diff = ( (ħ^2) ) / I.

ħ = h/(2π) =6.626e-34 / (2 *3.14159) )=6.626e-34 /6.283≈1.054e-33 J·s.

So ħ^2 ≈ (1.054e-33)^2 =1.111e-66 J²·s².

I=1.2088e-46 kg·m².

So E_rot_diff = 1.111e-66 / 1.2088e-46 = approx 9.203e-21 J.

p= E/c =9.203e-21 /3e8 =3.068e-29 Ns.

Wait, that's 3.068e-29 Ns. Hmm, still doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in using the reduced mass instead of the individual masses. No, because the moment of inertia is given by μ r².

Hmm. This is getting confusing. Let me think of another approach.

Perhaps the question is expecting the photon's energy to be the same as the vibrational transition, but that gives momentum around 8.8e-28 Ns, which isn't any of the options. The closest is option A, 1.9e-28, which is about half.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational energy as the rotational energy. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the reduced mass. Let me recheck the reduced mass formula.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My).

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

So μ = (20 *2)/(22) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.818 amu. Correct.

Wait, but wait, another thought: perhaps the bond length is given as 2 angstroms, but the moment of inertia is μ r². Did I compute that correctly?

Yes, 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters. So r² is 4e-20 m².

So I= μ r² =1.818 amu * 4e-20 m².

Wait, no, mu is in kg. So 1.818 amu is 3.0e-27 kg.

So 3.0e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.2e-46 kg·m². Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 1.9e-28 Ns, but my calculation for the vibrational transition leads to 8.8e-28 Ns, which is about four times larger than option A. So perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the photon's energy is not hν, but hν/2. Why would that be? Because for a diatomic molecule, sometimes the vibrational energy levels are quantized as (v + ½) hν. So the transition from v=0 to v=1 is hν, as I thought.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the change in the rotational state when the molecule absorbs a photon, but the rotational energy is calculated using the moment of inertia, which I may have messed up.

Wait, perhaps the moment of inertia is being calculated using the bond length in a different unit. Let me confirm: 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters. Yes.

Another thought: perhaps the question expects the photon to have energy corresponding to the fundamental vibrational state, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=1, which would involve both a vibrational and rotational change. But that would require a very high energy photon, which probably isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the Raman transition, which involves a change in rotational state without a vibrational change. But that's not what the question is asking.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is transitioning from the ground state to the next higher energy state, which could be a combination of both. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the photon's momentum based on the vibrational frequency, and I'm missing a factor.

Wait, if the photon's momentum is p = hν/c = (6.626e-34 *4e14) /3e8 = (2.65e-19) /3e8 ≈8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 Ns. So that would be the correct answer for the vibrational transition, but none of the options match. The closest option is A: 1.9e-28, which is about 0.214 times that value.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs a photon to go from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, but perhaps it's considering a different model where the energy is half of what I calculated.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. The vibrational energy difference is hν, which is 2.65e-19 J.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's momentum to be based on the rotational energy, but I'm getting 3e-31 Ns, which is way below the given options.

Hmm. I'm not sure. Given the options, and the calculations, perhaps the intended answer is option A, using the vibrational transition.

But according to the calculation, the rotational transition requires less energy, so the correct photon momentum should be about 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects the photon's momentum to be based on the vibrational transition, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement.

The problem states that the molecule is in the 'fundamental state'. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the next state would be the first excited state, which could be either vibrational or rotational, whichever is lower.

Since the rotational transition requires much less energy, the photon should have that energy.

But according to the calculation, the momentum is 3.09e-31 Ns, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of the reduced mass is wrong. Let me recheck.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2 )=40/22= 20/11=1.81818... amu.

Yes, correct.

Wait, wait a second. Another possibility: perhaps I should use the mass in atomic mass units without converting to kg. Oh wait, no. The moment of inertia must be in kg·m², so the reduced mass must be in kg.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the moment of inertia as (Mx + My) r² instead of μ r². Let me compute that.

Mx + My =20 +2=22 amu.

Convert 22 amu to kg: 22 *1.6605e-27=3.6531e-26 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

I = (3.6531e-26 kg ) * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.6531e-26 *4e-20=1.4612e-45 kg·m².

E_rot_diff = ħ² / I = (1.0545718e-34)^2 /1.4612e-45 = (1.112e-68) /1.4612e-45 ≈7.62e-24 J.

p =7.62e-24 /3e8 =2.54e-32 Ns.

Still way off the given options.

So I think I've hit a dead end. The correct calculation for the rotational transition gives a momentum not listed in the options. But perhaps the problem expects the vibrational transition, which gives p=8.83e-28 Ns, but that's not an option either. The closest option is A:1.9e-28, which is about half.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the way the options are presented. Let me recheck my calculation for the vibrational transition.

hν =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 Ns.

Option A:1.9e-28. Hmm, 8.83 /5=1.766, which is close to option A.

Wait, where would a factor of 5 come from? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is 2 angstroms, but the moment of inertia is calculated with r in a different unit. Wait no, I used 2e-10 m.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities, and I'm not getting any of the options. Perhaps the intended answer is option A, considering a miscalculation in the rotational transition, but I can't see where the discrepancy is.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, but that would require an even higher energy.

Wait, another possibility: the problem is using the rigid rotor model, but perhaps the non-rigid model includes a different formula for the energy levels.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational energy as the required photon energy, but I'm not sure.

In conclusion, based on the calculations, the photon's momentum for the rotational transition is around 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. For the vibrational transition, it's about 8.8e-28 Ns, which isn't an option either. Perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not sure why.

To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition a diatomic molecule from its fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next lowest energy state, we analyze the rotational and vibrational energy differences.

### Key Information:
- **Masses**:  
  \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, \, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)  
  Reduced mass:  
  \[
  \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
  \]  
  Converting to kilograms:  
  \[
  \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.022 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
  \]

- **Bond length**:  
  \( r = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)

- **Moment of inertia**:  
  \[
  I = \mu r^2 = (3.022 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2088 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
  \]

- **Vibrational angular frequency**:  
  \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Analysis:
1. **Rotational Energy Transition**:  
   The rotational energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E_J = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1)
   \]  
   The energy difference between \( J=0 \) and \( J=1 \):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E(1) - E(0) = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.2088 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.267 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   The corresponding photon momentum:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.267 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.09 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}
   \]  
   This value is much smaller than any of the given options.

2. **Vibrational Energy Transition**:  
   The vibrational energy difference is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \nu = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 4 \times 10^{14} \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   The corresponding photon momentum:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
   \]  
   This value is also not directly listed among the options.

3. **Comparison of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: \( p = 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)  
     This is approximately half of the calculated vibrational momentum (\( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)).  
   - **Option B**: \( p = 2.3 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{Ns} \)  
     This is much larger than both calculated values.  
   - **Option C**: \( p = 1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{Ns} \)  
     This is also much larger than both calculated values.  
   - **Option D**: \( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)  
     This is smaller than the vibrational momentum but closer to the rotational momentum.  

### Conclusion:
The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition, but the calculated rotational momentum (\( 3.09 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns} \)) does not match any of the options. The vibrational momentum (\( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)) is closest to **Option A** (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)), though it is approximately half the calculated value. Given the discrepancy, **Option A** is the most reasonable choice based on the problem's context.

Answer: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this problem here about a diatomic molecule and quantum models. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think it through.

The question is about a diatomic molecule made of elements X and Y. They mention the quantum rotation-vibration model, so I think that refers to the non-rigid rotor model, which accounts for both rotation and vibration. The molecule is in its fundamental state, and we need to find the momentum of a photon that would cause it to switch to the next lowest energy state.

Wait, what's the fundamental state? Oh right, the fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the next state would be the first excited state. But which transition are we looking at here? Since it's a diatomic, I remember that the energy levels involve both rotational and vibrational contributions.

In the non-rigid rotor model, the energy levels have rotational parts, but the rigid rotor is usually a simpler case. Wait, but here it's non-rigid, so maybe the bond length isn't fixed. But for the purpose of calculating energy levels, perhaps the rigid rotor approximation is still used. I'm a bit confused, but let's proceed.

The molecule is in its ground state, which is the lowest vibrational and rotational state. To switch to the next lowest energy state, the photon would need to cause a transition. What's the next state? Well, the next in energy could be a higher vibrational state or a higher rotational state. But which one is lower in energy? Because the order of energy levels depends on the specific molecule.

Wait, the quantum rotation-vibration model combines both rotation and vibration. The energy levels are given by some combination of vibrational and rotational quantum numbers. So the fundamental state is probably the lowest vibrational state (v=0) and the lowest rotational state (J=0). The next state would be the next higher energy state. Now, considering that in diatomic molecules, vibrational energy levels are generally more spaced out than rotational ones, but it also depends on the values of the constants involved.

Wait, no. Let me think. The spacing between vibrational levels is much larger than rotational because the vibrational energy depends on the square of the angular frequency, which is higher. So, going from v=0 to v=1 would require a photon with energy hν equal to the vibrational energy spacing. But if the question refers to the next state in the energy hierarchy, which could be the first excited rotational state (J=1) or the first excited vibrational state (v=1). So the question is, which transition has a lower photon energy?

Alternatively, perhaps the next state is a combination of both. But the problem states that the molecule is in its fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state. So the next state could be the first vibrational excited state (v=1, J=0) or the first rotational state (J=1, v=0). Which one has a lower energy?

Wait, the energy levels for a diatomic in the rotation-vibration model are given by:

E = E_vibrational + E_rotational

E_vibrational for the harmonic oscillator is (v + ½) hν
E_rotational for rigid rotor is (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I), where I is the moment of inertia.

The question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy. So the next state would be the one where the energy is just higher than the fundamental state. So which transition has a lower energy difference: from (v=0, J=0) to (v=0, J=1), or to (v=1, J=0)?

Let me compute both energy differences.

First, the energy difference for rotational transition: from J=0 to J=1.

E_rot_diff = E(J=1) - E(J=0) = [ (1*2) * ħ²/(2I) ] - 0 = (2 ħ²)/(2I) = ħ²/(I)

The rotational energy is (J(J+1)ħ²)/(2I). So from J=0 to J=1, the change is (2ħ²)/(2I) - 0 = ħ²/(I).

Now the vibrational transition from v=0 to v=1: E_vibr_diff = (1 + ½) hν - (0 + ½) hν = hν.

So which is smaller: the rotational energy difference or the vibrational?

Given that the vibrational frequency is given as w = 4e14 rad/s. Let me compute hν: h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s. So hν = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = approx 2.65e-19 J.

Now compute the rotational energy difference. I is the moment of inertia, which is μ r², where μ is the reduced mass, and r is the bond length.

The bond length r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters.

The masses are Mx =20 amu, My=2 amu. So reduced mass μ = (Mx * My)/(Mx + My) amu.

Calculating μ: (20 *2)/(20+2) =40/22 ≈1.818 amu.

Convert amu to kg: 1 amu ≈ 1.6605e-27 kg. So μ =1.818 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.022e-27 kg.

Wait, double-check the calculation: 20 *2 =40; 40/(22) is about 1.818. Yes.

So I = μ r² = 3.022e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.022e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2088e-46 kg·m².

Now, E_rot_diff = ħ²/(I) = (h/(2π))² / I.

Compute ħ: h/(2π) ≈6.626e-34/(6.283) ≈1.054e-33 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.054e-33)^2 ≈ 1.11e-66 J²·s².

E_rot_diff = 1.11e-66 / 1.2088e-46 ≈ (1.11 / 1.2088) * 1e-20 ≈ 0.918e-20 J, which is about 9.18e-21 J.

Compare to the vibrational energy difference: 2.65e-19 J.

So the rotational transition requires much less energy than the vibrational. That makes sense because rotational transitions usually have lower energy than vibrational for diatomic molecules (since ν is high, leading to large hν).

So the next state with the lowest possible energy is the rotational transition from J=0 to J=1. Therefore, the photon must supply energy equal to the rotational energy difference.

Wait, but wait. The question says, the molecule is in its fundamental state. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, which is v=0, J=0. The next state could be either v=1, J=0, or v=0, J=1. Which one has lower energy?

E_rot_diff is 9.18e-21 J, and E_vibr_diff is 2.65e-19 J. Since 9e-21 is much less than 2.65e-19, the rotational transition requires less energy. So the photon needed is for the rotational transition.

Wait, but in a diatomic molecule, the selection rules for rotational transitions usually require a change in J by ±1. So from J=0 to J=1. But the vibrational transition would require a change in v by ±1. But if the photon is absorbed, it can cause a transition either in rotation or vibration, whichever requires less energy.

But why would the question specify that it's the next state with the lowest possible energy? Because the rotational transition is lower in energy, that's the next state.

So the photon's energy must be equal to the rotational energy difference.

Energy of photon E_photon = E_rot_diff = ħ²/(I).

But wait, the question asks about the momentum of the photon. Oh right, because the photon's energy is related to its momentum p by E = pc.

So once we find E_photon, p = E_photon / c.

So E_photon is about 9.18e-21 J. c is speed of light, 3e8 m/s.

p = 9.18e-21 / 3e8 = approx 3.06e-29 kg·m/s.

Wait, but wait, let's compute more accurately.

Wait, let's recheck the calculation of E_rot_diff.

Wait, I = μ r² = 3.022e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3.022e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2088e-46 kg·m².

ħ is h/(2π) ≈ 1.0545718e-34 J·s.

So ħ² = (1.0545718e-34)^2 ≈ 1.112e-68 J²·s².

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recompute.

Wait, no. Let me recalculate ħ²/(I):

ħ² is (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approximately (1.05457e-34)^2 = (1.05457)^2 * 1e-68 = approx 1.112e-68 J² s².

Wait no, J is kg m²/s², so ħ² is (J s)^2? Wait, perhaps I should be more precise.

Wait, ħ has units of J·s. So ħ² is (J² s²).

But I is in kg·m². So ħ²/(I) has units of (J² s²) / (kg m²). Let me see if that makes sense for energy.

Wait, 1 J = 1 kg m²/s². So J² s² = (kg² m^4/s^4) * s^2 )= kg² m^4 / s².

Divided by kg m²: (kg² m^4 / s²) / (kg m²) )= kg m² / s² = J.

So yes, the units work out. So E_rot_diff is in J.

So E_rot_diff = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.2088e-46) = ?

Let me compute numerator: (1.0545718e-34)^2 = approx (1.0545718)^2 = 1.112, so 1.112e-68.

Denominator: 1.2088e-46.

So E_rot_diff = (1.112e-68) / (1.2088e-46) = approx 9.20e-23 J.

Wait, wait, that's different from my earlier calculation. Hmm, earlier I thought ħ was 1e-33 J s, then squared was 1e-66, divided by 1e-46 gave 1e-20. But with more accurate numbers, it's 9.2e-23 J.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents earlier. Let me recalculate.

Wait, 1.0545718e-34 squared is 1.112e-68 (since 1e-34 squared is 1e-68).

Denominator I=1.2088e-46.

So 1.112e-68 / 1.2088e-46 = (1.112 / 1.2088) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.92 * 1e-22 = 9.2e-23 J.

So E_photon = 9.2e-23 J.

Then the photon's momentum p is E/c. Since E = pc, so p = E/(c).

c is 3e8 m/s.

So p = (9.2e-23 J) / (3e8 m/s) = (9.2e-23) / (3e8) = 3.066e-31 kg·m/s.

Wait, but that's 3.066e-31 kg·m/s, which is 3.066e-31 N·s, since 1 N·s = 1 kg·m/s.

Wait, that's 3.07e-31 N·s. But looking at the options, the closest is option D: 1.4e-28 Ns. Wait that's three orders of magnitude larger. Did I make a mistake?

Hmm, perhaps I messed up the calculation of the reduced mass. Let me double-check.

The reduced mass μ for a diatomic molecule is (Mx * My)/(Mx + My). Mx is 20 amu, My is 2 amu.

So μ = (20 *2) / (20 +2) =40/22=20/11≈1.818 amu.

Wait, converting to kg: 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg. So 1.818 amu is 1.818 *1.6605e-27 ≈ 3.022e-27 kg.

Wait, that part is correct. So I= μ r². r is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 m.

So I =3.022e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2.

(2e-10)^2=4e-20.

So I=3.022e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2088e-46 kg m².

That's correct. So I think the calculation is correct.

Wait, but E_rot_diff is 9.2e-23 J, so p = 9.2e-23 / 3e8 = 3.07e-31 Ns.

But the options are A to D, and the smallest is D: 1.4e-28, which is about 100 times larger than my calculation.

Hmm... something's wrong here. Maybe I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, the question is about the next state with the lowest possible energy, which could also be a combination of both rotational and vibrational transitions. Or perhaps the transition is from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=0. That would require more energy than the rotational transition, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a vibration-rotation transition, but that would require more energy than rotational, so the photon's energy would be higher than E_rot_diff.

Wait but the question is about the photon's momentum, so perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another thought: perhaps the energy needed is the sum of the rotational and vibrational transition. No, wait, when the molecule is in the fundamental state, the next state would be either the first rotational level or the first vibrational level, whichever has lower energy.

Since the rotational transition is lower in energy, the photon should have the energy of that rotational transition.

But according to my calculation, the momentum is around 3e-31 Ns, but the options are higher. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula for the rotational energy difference. Let me re-derive that.

The rotational energy levels are given by E_rot = (ħ²)/(2I) * J(J+1).

So the transition from J=0 to J=1 is ΔE_rot = E(J=1) - E(J=0) = ( (1)(2) ħ²/(2I) ) - 0 = (2 ħ²)/(2I) ) = ħ²/(I).

Yes, that's correct. So E_rot_diff = ħ²/(I).

Wait, but perhaps I should use the moment of inertia differently. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, the bond length is 2 angstroms, correct. So r=2e-10 m.

μ = (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) )=40/22 amu, so 1.818 amu.

Convert to kg: 1.818 * 1.6605e-27 kg = let's compute that.

1.818 *1.6605 is approx 2.999, so 3.0e-27 kg.

Ok, so I = μ r² = 3.0e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2e-46 kg m².

So ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J s.

So E_rot_diff = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.2e-46) = (1.112e-68) / (1.2e-46) )= approx 9.267e-23 J.

So p = E/c = 9.267e-23 J / (3e8 m/s) = 3.09e-31 kg m/s = 3.09e-31 Ns.

Hmm, but none of the options match this. The options go up to 2.3e-27, which is way bigger. Perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents in the calculation. Let's recompute:

(1.0545718e-34)^2 = (1.0545718)^2 * 1e-68 = approx 1.112e-68.

Divide by I = 1.2e-46: 1.112e-68 / 1.2e-46 = (1.112 / 1.2) ) * 1e-22 ≈ 0.9267 * 1e-22 = 9.267e-23 J.

Yes, that's correct. So p = 9.267e-23 / 3e8 = 3.09e-31 Ns.

But the options are:

A) 1.9e-28

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28

Hmm, none of these are close to 3e-31. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the vibrational transition, not the rotational. Wait, but the vibrational transition requires higher energy.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from the fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which could be a combination of both rotational and vibrational. But that would involve a photon with higher energy than either.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the rotational energy. Let me think: for a rigid rotor, the energy levels are E_J = [ħ^2/(2I)] J(J+1). So the spacing between J and J+1 is [ħ^2/(2I)] ( (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) ) = [ħ^2/(2I)] (2J + 2 ) = [ħ^2 (J+1)] / I.

Wait, wait, for J=0 to J=1, ΔE_rot = E(1) - E(0) = [ (1)(2) ħ²/(2I) ) ] - 0 = (2 ħ²)/(2I) ) = ħ² / I.

Ah, so that part is correct. Then the calculation earlier stands.

Hmm, perhaps the question is about the next vibrational state but the rotational state is considered as well. Or perhaps I'm confusing the selection rules.

Wait, another thought: the molecule is modeled using the non-rigid rotor model, which includes the vibration as part of the rotational state. So perhaps it's a different approach where the energy levels are treated as a combination of vibration and rotation.

But I'm not too familiar with the non-rigid rotor model. Wait, the rigid rotor model assumes bond length is fixed, but non-rigid allows bond length to vary, similar to the harmonic oscillator. So the energy levels might be a combination of rotation and vibration.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground vibrational state (v=0) to the first excited state (v=1), but with the lowest rotational state (J=0). That would be a pure vibrational transition.

Wait, but as I calculated earlier, the energy difference there is 2.65e-19 J, which is way larger than the rotational. So it would require a much higher energy photon.

But why isn't that the correct approach? The question says the molecule is in the fundamental state, which I think is the lowest energy state, which would be v=0, J=0.

The next possible state, the lowest in energy, would be J=1, v=0. So the photon should provide energy for that transition.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Another way to approach it: let's compute the energy difference again.

E_rot_diff = ħ^2/(I) = (1.0545718e-34)^2 / (1.2e-46)

Calculating numerator: 1.0545718e-34 squared.

1.0545718^2 is approximately 1.112.

So 1.112e-68.

Divide by 1.2e-46: 1.112e-68 / 1.2e-46 = (1.112/1.2) * 1e-22.

1.112/1.2 is approximately 0.9267, so 9.267e-23 J.

So E_photon =9.267e-23 J.

Momentum p = E/c =9.267e-23 / 3e8 = 3.089e-31 kg·m/s.

Which is 3.089e-31 N·s.

But this isn't any of the options given. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational energy as the required transition. Let me compute that.

E_vibr = hν = 6.626e-34 * 4e14 = 2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c = 2.65e-19 /3e8 = 8.83e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 N·s. Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28. Close, but not quite.

Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the transition from the ground state (v=0, J=0) to the next state, which is the first vibrational state plus the first rotational state, but that would require more energy. No, the next lowest state is the rotational one.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the transition from the ground state to the first state where both J and v are excited, but that's probably not the case.

Wait another angle: perhaps the question is about the total energy of the molecule changing, but the photon's energy must match the transition.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering only the vibrational transition because the rotational transitions may require lower energy, but the photon's momentum is being calculated from the vibrational energy.

Wait, but the options don't match either. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should compute the moment of inertia differently. Wait, the bond length is 2 angstroms, which is 2e-10 meters. So r=2e-10 m.

The reduced mass μ is correct (20 amu * 2 amu)/(22 amu) ) = 40/22 = 1.818 amu → 3.0e-27 kg.

So I = μ r² = 3e-27 kg * (2e-10 m)^2 = 3e-27 *4e-20 = 1.2e-46 kg m².

Wait, maybe I should factor in the vibrational angular frequency. But why? Because the photon's energy is tied to the vibrational frequency, but the rotational transition is much lower.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state to the first vibrational state, but that would require a much higher energy photon.

But the options don't have such high values. Wait, option A is 1.9e-28 Ns, which is 1.9e-28 kg m/s.

If I compute p = 1.9e-28 Ns, then E = p c =1.9e-28 *3e8 =5.7e-20 J.

Which is about twice the E_rot_diff I calculated earlier.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the rotational energy.

Wait, another approach: calculate the rotational energy difference in terms of angular frequency. The rotational energy levels are (J(J+1) ħ^2)/(2I).

So the difference between J=0 and J=1 is (2 ħ^2)/(2I) )= ħ^2/(I).

Which is the same as before.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the photon to have a momentum corresponding to the vibrational transition. Because the given options are in the 1e-27 to 1e-28 range, which is close to what I get for E_rot_diff if I make a mistake in the exponent.

Let me check: 1e-23 J. So p = 1e-23 /3e8 = 3.3e-32 Ns. That's even smaller.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the reduced mass calculation.

Wait, Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.818 amu.

Yes, correct. So in kg, 1.818 *1.6605e-27 = approx 3.022e-27 kg.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute using exact numbers.

Compute μ in kg:

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 + 2) amu = 40/22 amu =20/11 amu.

20/11 ≈1.81818 amu.

1.81818 amu * 1.66053906660e-27 kg/amu ≈ 3.022e-27 kg.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's energy to be the sum of both rotational and vibrational transitions. But that seems unlikely, as the next state would be the lower of the two.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 1/2 somewhere. Let me think.

Wait, E_rot_diff is ħ^2/(I). Maybe the formula is (h^2)/(8 π² I) * (1/(J)(J+1)).

Wait, no, E_rot = (ħ² / (2I)) * J(J+1) → ΔE = (ħ² / (2I)) [ (J+1)(J+2) - J(J+1) ) ] = (ħ²/(2I)) (2J +2) )= (ħ² (J+1) )/(I).

For J=0, ΔE= (ħ^2 (1) ) / I.

Which is the same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck. The calculation points to p≈3e-31 Ns, but that's not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the model.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the transition from the ground state to the first vibrational state, but using the vibrational energy. Let me compute that.

E_vibr = h ν =6.626e-34 *4e14 =2.65e-19 J.

p = E/c =2.65e-19 /3e8 =8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 Ns. Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half.

Wait, why would the photon's energy be half of E_vibr?

Oh! Because in vibrational transitions, the selection rule is Δv = ±1, and the energy change is from v=0 to v=1, which is from (1/2) hν to (3/2) hν. So the photon's energy is hν. So I think the calculation is correct.

So if the photon's energy is hν=2.65e-19 J, then p=8.83e-28 Ns. But the options don't have this exact value. Option A is 1.9e-28, which is roughly half.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using exact numbers.

Let me compute hν:

h=6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value).

ν=4e14 Hz.

hν=6.62607015e-34 *4e14 = 2.65042806e-19 J.

p = 2.65042806e-19 / (3e8) = 8.8347602e-28 kg·m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 Ns.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.9e-28, which is about half. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, wait a second. Another possibility: perhaps the question is asking for the total momentum imparted when the molecule absorbs a photon, but considering the reduced mass. Wait, but that doesn't change the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's momentum in a different way. Photon momentum is p = E/c. So I think that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the question refers to the rotational transition. But according to my calculation, that's about 3e-31 Ns, not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational energy but making a mistake in the calculation. Let me recompute using exact numbers.

Wait, let me compute the rotational energy difference again.

E_rot_diff = ( (ħ^2) ) / I.

ħ = h/(2π) =6.626e-34 / (2 *3.14159) )=6.626e-34 /6.283≈1.054e-33 J·s.

So ħ^2 ≈ (1.054e-33)^2 =1.111e-66 J²·s².

I=1.2088e-46 kg·m².

So E_rot_diff = 1.111e-66 / 1.2088e-46 = approx 9.203e-21 J.

p= E/c =9.203e-21 /3e8 =3.068e-29 Ns.

Wait, that's 3.068e-29 Ns. Hmm, still doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in using the reduced mass instead of the individual masses. No, because the moment of inertia is given by μ r².

Hmm. This is getting confusing. Let me think of another approach.

Perhaps the question is expecting the photon's energy to be the same as the vibrational transition, but that gives momentum around 8.8e-28 Ns, which isn't any of the options. The closest is option A, 1.9e-28, which is about half.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the vibrational energy as the rotational energy. But that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo, and the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the reduced mass. Let me recheck the reduced mass formula.

μ = (Mx * My) / (Mx + My).

Mx=20 amu, My=2 amu.

So μ = (20 *2)/(22) =40/22 =20/11 ≈1.818 amu. Correct.

Wait, but wait, another thought: perhaps the bond length is given as 2 angstroms, but the moment of inertia is μ r². Did I compute that correctly?

Yes, 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters. So r² is 4e-20 m².

So I= μ r² =1.818 amu * 4e-20 m².

Wait, no, mu is in kg. So 1.818 amu is 3.0e-27 kg.

So 3.0e-27 kg *4e-20 m² =1.2e-46 kg·m². Correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A) 1.9e-28 Ns

B) 2.3e-27

C) 1.1e-27

D) 1.4e-28.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option A, 1.9e-28 Ns, but my calculation for the vibrational transition leads to 8.8e-28 Ns, which is about four times larger than option A. So perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the photon's energy is not hν, but hν/2. Why would that be? Because for a diatomic molecule, sometimes the vibrational energy levels are quantized as (v + ½) hν. So the transition from v=0 to v=1 is hν, as I thought.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the change in the rotational state when the molecule absorbs a photon, but the rotational energy is calculated using the moment of inertia, which I may have messed up.

Wait, perhaps the moment of inertia is being calculated using the bond length in a different unit. Let me confirm: 2 angstroms is 2e-10 meters. Yes.

Another thought: perhaps the question expects the photon to have energy corresponding to the fundamental vibrational state, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the transition from v=0, J=0 to v=1, J=1, which would involve both a vibrational and rotational change. But that would require a very high energy photon, which probably isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the Raman transition, which involves a change in rotational state without a vibrational change. But that's not what the question is asking.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is transitioning from the ground state to the next higher energy state, which could be a combination of both. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the problem is considering the photon's momentum based on the vibrational frequency, and I'm missing a factor.

Wait, if the photon's momentum is p = hν/c = (6.626e-34 *4e14) /3e8 = (2.65e-19) /3e8 ≈8.83e-28 kg m/s.

Which is 8.83e-28 Ns. So that would be the correct answer for the vibrational transition, but none of the options match. The closest option is A: 1.9e-28, which is about 0.214 times that value.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the photon's momentum when the molecule absorbs a photon to go from the ground state to the first excited vibrational state, but perhaps it's considering a different model where the energy is half of what I calculated.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. The vibrational energy difference is hν, which is 2.65e-19 J.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the photon's momentum to be based on the rotational energy, but I'm getting 3e-31 Ns, which is way below the given options.

Hmm. I'm not sure. Given the options, and the calculations, perhaps the intended answer is option A, using the vibrational transition.

But according to the calculation, the rotational transition requires less energy, so the correct photon momentum should be about 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps the problem expects the photon's momentum to be based on the vibrational transition, but I'm not sure why.

Alternatively, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement.

The problem states that the molecule is in the 'fundamental state'. The fundamental state is the lowest energy state, so the next state would be the first excited state, which could be either vibrational or rotational, whichever is lower.

Since the rotational transition requires much less energy, the photon should have that energy.

But according to the calculation, the momentum is 3.09e-31 Ns, which isn't any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of the reduced mass is wrong. Let me recheck.

μ = (20 * 2) / (20 +2 )=40/22= 20/11=1.81818... amu.

Yes, correct.

Wait, wait a second. Another possibility: perhaps I should use the mass in atomic mass units without converting to kg. Oh wait, no. The moment of inertia must be in kg·m², so the reduced mass must be in kg.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering the moment of inertia as (Mx + My) r² instead of μ r². Let me compute that.

Mx + My =20 +2=22 amu.

Convert 22 amu to kg: 22 *1.6605e-27=3.6531e-26 kg.

r=2e-10 m.

I = (3.6531e-26 kg ) * (2e-10 m)^2 =3.6531e-26 *4e-20=1.4612e-45 kg·m².

E_rot_diff = ħ² / I = (1.0545718e-34)^2 /1.4612e-45 = (1.112e-68) /1.4612e-45 ≈7.62e-24 J.

p =7.62e-24 /3e8 =2.54e-32 Ns.

Still way off the given options.

So I think I've hit a dead end. The correct calculation for the rotational transition gives a momentum not listed in the options. But perhaps the problem expects the vibrational transition, which gives p=8.83e-28 Ns, but that's not an option either. The closest option is A:1.9e-28, which is about half.

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the way the options are presented. Let me recheck my calculation for the vibrational transition.

hν =6.626e-34 *4e14 = 2.6504e-19 J.

p =2.6504e-19 /3e8 =8.8347e-28 Ns.

Option A:1.9e-28. Hmm, 8.83 /5=1.766, which is close to option A.

Wait, where would a factor of 5 come from? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the bond length is 2 angstroms, but the moment of inertia is calculated with r in a different unit. Wait no, I used 2e-10 m.

Hmm. I think I've exhausted all possibilities, and I'm not getting any of the options. Perhaps the intended answer is option A, considering a miscalculation in the rotational transition, but I can't see where the discrepancy is.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the transition from J=0 to J=2, but that would require an even higher energy.

Wait, another possibility: the problem is using the rigid rotor model, but perhaps the non-rigid model includes a different formula for the energy levels.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the vibrational energy as the required photon energy, but I'm not sure.

In conclusion, based on the calculations, the photon's momentum for the rotational transition is around 3e-31 Ns, which isn't an option. For the vibrational transition, it's about 8.8e-28 Ns, which isn't an option either. Perhaps the intended answer is option A, but I'm not sure why.


To determine the momentum of the photon required to transition a diatomic molecule from its fundamental state (v=0, J=0) to the next lowest energy state, we analyze the rotational and vibrational energy differences.

### Key Information:
- **Masses**:  
  \( M_x = 20 \, \text{amu}, \, M_y = 2 \, \text{amu} \)  
  Reduced mass:  
  \[
  \mu = \frac{M_x \cdot M_y}{M_x + M_y} = \frac{20 \cdot 2}{20 + 2} = \frac{40}{22} \approx 1.818 \, \text{amu}
  \]  
  Converting to kilograms:  
  \[
  \mu \approx 1.818 \cdot 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg} \approx 3.022 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{kg}
  \]

- **Bond length**:  
  \( r = 2 \, \text{angstroms} = 2 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)

- **Moment of inertia**:  
  \[
  I = \mu r^2 = (3.022 \times 10^{-27}) \cdot (2 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 1.2088 \times 10^{-46} \, \text{kg·m}^2
  \]

- **Vibrational angular frequency**:  
  \( \omega = 4 \times 10^{14} \, \text{rad/s} \)

### Analysis:
1. **Rotational Energy Transition**:  
   The rotational energy levels are given by:  
   \[
   E_J = \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1)
   \]  
   The energy difference between \( J=0 \) and \( J=1 \):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = E(1) - E(0) = \frac{\hbar^2}{I}
   \]  
   Substituting \( \hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \):  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{rot}} = \frac{(1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{1.2088 \times 10^{-46}} \approx 9.267 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   The corresponding photon momentum:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{rot}}}{c} = \frac{9.267 \times 10^{-23}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 3.09 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns}
   \]  
   This value is much smaller than any of the given options.

2. **Vibrational Energy Transition**:  
   The vibrational energy difference is:  
   \[
   \Delta E_{\text{vib}} = h \nu = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \cdot 4 \times 10^{14} \approx 2.65 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}
   \]  
   The corresponding photon momentum:  
   \[
   p = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{vib}}}{c} = \frac{2.65 \times 10^{-19}}{3 \times 10^8} \approx 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns}
   \]  
   This value is also not directly listed among the options.

3. **Comparison of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: \( p = 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)  
     This is approximately half of the calculated vibrational momentum (\( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)).  
   - **Option B**: \( p = 2.3 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{Ns} \)  
     This is much larger than both calculated values.  
   - **Option C**: \( p = 1.1 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{Ns} \)  
     This is also much larger than both calculated values.  
   - **Option D**: \( p = 1.4 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)  
     This is smaller than the vibrational momentum but closer to the rotational momentum.  

### Conclusion:
The rotational transition requires significantly less energy than the vibrational transition, but the calculated rotational momentum (\( 3.09 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{Ns} \)) does not match any of the options. The vibrational momentum (\( 8.83 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)) is closest to **Option A** (\( 1.9 \times 10^{-28} \, \text{Ns} \)), though it is approximately half the calculated value. Given the discrepancy, **Option A** is the most reasonable choice based on the problem's context.

Answer: A
