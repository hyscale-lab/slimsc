Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question is about ranking substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer produced when they react with excess bromine. The substances are numbered 1 to 6, each with a benzene ring attached to different groups.

Wait, so each of these compounds undergoes bromination. Since it's an electrophilic substitution, the groups attached to the benzene will direct where the bromine adds. And because it's a monobromination, each will form mainly one product, but the position (ortho, meta, para) depends on the directing group.

I remember that substituents can be activating or deactivating, and also they're either ortho/para directors or meta directors. Let me list each substituent and their directing effects:

1) С6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group. Methyl is an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. So it's an ortho/para director. So when this undergoes bromination, the bromine will add mainly in para and ortho positions. But because methyl is a strong activating group, para might be the major product? Or wait, no, in monosubstitution, the major product depends on the director. For methyl, since it's an activating, o/p director, the product can be more ortho or para. But wait, for bromine, which is a strongly activating electrophile, I think in bromination, the substituent directs where the Br adds.

But wait, benzene's bromination is usually with a catalyst. The substituents on the ring will direct the incoming Br. So for each compound:

1) Compound 1: C6H5-CH3 (methyl benzene or toluene). The methyl group is activating, o/p-directing. So the bromine will add more in ortho and para positions. For toluene, the para isomer is the major product because the methyl group is a strong activating group, and the para position is more accessible. Or wait, sometimes ortho can be more because of steric hindrance in para? Wait, no— for toluene, the major product is para because the ortho would have more steric hindrance from the methyl group, making para the major. So the para isomer is the major product.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's an ester group. The substituent is an ester, which is a meta-directing group since esters are deactivating (electron-withdrawing) but ortho/para directors? Wait, no. Wait, esters are deactivating but ortho/para directing. Because the ester has a carbonyl group which is electron-withdrawing, so it's a deactivating group. So the ring is deactivated, but the substituent is an ortho/para director. So for substitution, the bromine would enter ortho, para positions relative to the ester group. But wait, wait, actually, I'm getting confused. Let me think. Phenyl esters: the substituent is an ester, which is a meta director. Wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Wait, groups with lone pairs, like -OCH3, are ortho/para directors. Groups like -NO2 are meta directors. Ester groups (like -COOR) are deactivating and meta-directing. Wait, no. Wait, I think I might be mixing things up. Let me double-check: activating groups are o/p directors, deactivating can be o/p or meta. For example, nitro groups are deactivating and meta directors. Esters, like -COOR, are deactivating and meta directors. Because the carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing, making the ring less reactive. So, in that case, the ester group directs incoming electrophiles to meta positions. So bromine would add at meta. So the major product would be the meta isomer, not para. But wait, the question is about the para isomer's weight fraction. So if the major product is meta, then the para fraction is low.

Wait, but wait: the problem states that each substance undergoes substitution to form only one monobromo derivative. So perhaps each substituent leads to a single position being favored. So for each substituent, the para substitution's yield depends on how much the substituent directs to para.

Wait, but if the substituent is meta-directing, then the bromine would go to meta positions, which are the 3 and 5 positions relative to the substituent. So the para position (position 4) would not be the site of substitution. So in that case, the para isomer's yield would be zero? But the question says only one monobromo is formed, so perhaps each substituent directs to a single position. But that doesn't make sense for all substituents.

Wait, perhaps for the purpose of this problem, each substituent directs the bromine to either para, ortho, or meta, but in monobromination, maybe it's only one position possible due to steric factors or the substituent's influence.

Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, the substituent directs the bromine to a specific position, so each substituent's para isomer's yield is either high or low.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer in each reaction. So for each substance, when brominated, how much of the product is the para isomer.

So the plan is:

For each substituent, determine whether the para position is a major product. Then, rank them from least para to most para.

Let me go through each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3: methyl group. o/p-directing. So bromine adds to ortho and para. But for toluene, the para is the major product because the ortho position is hindered by the methyl group. So the para isomer is major. So high weight fraction of para.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: ester group. As I discussed earlier, esters are deactivating and meta-directing. So the bromine would add to the meta positions. Thus, para isomer's fraction would be low, perhaps zero. So the para isomer is not formed.

3) C6H5-Cl: chlorine. Chlorine is an ortho/para director but deactivating. So, the substituent directs to ortho and para. So the para isomer would be a major product. But wait, chlorine is a leaving group, but in bromination, it's the ring substituent that directs. So the para isomer would form. So the para fraction is high.

Wait, but wait: wait, the substituent is Cl attached to benzene. So, Cl is an ortho/para director because it's an electron-withdrawing group but has lone pairs. So, the Cl will direct Br to ortho and para. So the major product would be the para isomer because the Cl is a meta director? No, wait, sorry, Cl is an ortho/para director. So, the para isomer would be a major product.

4) C6H5-NO2: nitro group. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So the bromine would add in the meta positions. Para isomer is not formed in this case. So the para fraction is zero.

Wait, but wait: nitro is meta director, so the Br would go to meta positions. So para isomer's fraction is zero.

5) C6H5-C2H5: ethyl group. Similar to methyl, it's an activating, o/p-directing group. So the major product would be para due to less steric hindrance. So high para fraction.

6) C6H5-COOH: carboxylic acid group. The substituent is -COOH, which is deactivating and meta-directing. So the bromine would add in the meta position, so para fraction is zero.

Wait, no: wait, carboxylic acid is a strong deactivating group (due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the -COOH group), and it's a meta director. So, the bromine would add in the meta with respect to the COOH group, meaning the para position isn't the site of substitution. So the para fraction would be low, perhaps zero.

Now, let's list for each substituent whether the para isomer is formed and how much.

1) Para is major: high yield of para.

2) Ester: meta director. So para's fraction is low, perhaps zero.

3) Cl: o/p director, so para is major.

4) NO2: meta, so para fraction low, zero.

5) Ethyl: o/p, para is major.

6) COOH: meta, para fraction low, zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me correct:

Substituent groups:

1) CH3: o/p (activating), so major product is para, so the para fraction is high.

2) COOEt (ester): meta director. So, the major product is meta; para fraction is low.

3) Cl: o/p director. So major product is para; high fraction.

4) NO2: meta. Para fraction is low.

5) C2H5: o/p, major para.

6) COOH: meta, para fraction low.

So now, for each compound, the para fraction:

1) High

2) Low

3) High

4) Low

5) High

6) Low

Wait, but let me check each one again.

1) Toluene (methyl): Bromine adds to para position as major product. So para fraction is >50% (maybe around 60% or higher).

2) Phenyl ester: meta director. So para is not a major product, so the para fraction is low, maybe negligible.

3) Phenyl chloride: o/p director. So the para isomer is major. Maybe similar to toluene, about 60% or higher.

4) Nitrobenzene: meta director. Para fraction is low. So, no significant para product.

5) Ethyl benzene: o/p director, so para is major. So high para fraction.

6) Phenylacetic acid (or benzoic acid derivative): meta director. So para fraction is low.

But wait, wait, what about when the substituent is a strong deactivating group but o/p director, like nitro groups are meta directors. Wait, no: nitro is a meta director. So, substituents like -Cl are o/p directors but deactivating.

Wait, let's think about the substituents again:

- CH3: activating, o/p. Para is major.

- COOEt: deactivating, meta. Para is not formed.

- Cl: deactivating, o/p. Para is major.

- NO2: deactivating, meta. Para not formed.

- C2H5: activating, o/p. Para is major.

- COOH: deactivating, meta. Para not formed.

So, the compounds with substituents that are o/p directors (1,3,5) will have higher para fractions, while those that are meta directors (2,4,6) will have lower para fractions.

Now, among those with o/p directors, which will give higher para yields.

Wait, but the substituent can influence the ratio between ortho and para. For example, a strong activating group like -OCH3 (which is more activating than -CH3) would have more para product because ortho is hindered. Similarly, for groups that are bulky, the para product is more favored.

So, looking at the substituents:

1) CH3: methyl. Not very bulky, but more activating than ethyl? Wait, ethyl is also activating but less than methyl? No, wait, ethyl is larger than methyl. So for ethyl group (5), perhaps the majority is para, but maybe less than methyl because of steric hindrance. Wait, no: I think both methyl and ethyl are not very bulky, but ethyl is larger than methyl. So, for bromination, the para position would be more favored for both, but perhaps methyl leads to a higher para fraction than ethyl? Or maybe the opposite. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the para/ortho ratios. For toluene (methyl), the para isomer is about 60%, and ortho is around 40%. For ethyl benzene, the para product is also major, but perhaps the ortho is a bit more than toluene's because the ethyl group is bulkier. Wait, no, wait: in ethylbenzene, the ethyl group is larger than methyl. So, steric hindrance in the ortho position would be more significant, which would lead to a higher para product. So perhaps ethyl has a higher para fraction than methyl.

Wait, no, I think that the opposite is true. Let me think: when the substituent is a big group, the para product is more favored because the ortho positions are hindered. So, for ethyl group (which is bigger than methyl), the para product would be more than in toluene. So, ethyl benzene's para fraction would be higher than toluene's.

Wait, but wait, I'm not entirely sure. I think I should look this up, but in the absence of that, I'll proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around. Let's think: toluene's major product is para, but ethylbenzene might have a higher ratio of para due to steric hindrance in the ortho.

So, perhaps the order of para fractions is:

5 (ethyl) > 1 (methyl) > 3 (Cl) ?

Wait, but let's think about Cl. The substituent is Cl, which is an o/p director but deactivating. So, the para is the major product. How does the para fraction compare to methyl and ethyl?

I think chlorobenzene's para product is the major, but maybe the para fraction is higher than toluene's because Cl is more electronegative and perhaps directs more strongly to para, or maybe because Cl is a better director.

But I'm not exactly certain. Alternatively, perhaps for Cl, the para is the major, but the ratio might be higher than toluene's.

Wait, perhaps the para fractions are as follows:

Looking at each substituent:

1. CH3: para around 60% (but I'm not sure of the exact percentage).

3. Cl: perhaps higher than CH3, maybe around 70%?

5. C2H5: perhaps highest, like 80%?

2,4,6: para fractions are low, perhaps around 10% or less.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the relative strengths of the substituents as o/p directors.

Alternatively, perhaps the order of para fraction from least to most is:

The para fractions for each group are:

Substance 2, 4, 6: low para (since meta directors).

Substance 1,3,5: higher para.

Now, among substance 1,3,5, which has the highest para fraction?

Assuming that the meta directors (2,4,6) have the lowest para fractions, and the o/p directors (1,3,5) have higher ones.

But the question is to arrange all six in order of increasing weight fraction of para isomer. So from lowest to highest.

So, the order would be: the meta-directing groups (2,4,6) come first, then the o/p directors (1,3,5).

But within the o/p directors, which has the highest para fraction.

Wait, but the substituents in 3 is Cl, which is an o/p director but deactivating. Whereas 1 and 5 are activating.

Wait, perhaps the activating groups make the ring more reactive, so the substituent directs more strongly to para.

But wait, the presence of a substituent doesn't necessarily dictate the percentage of para versus ortho, but in this case, the question says only one monobromo is formed, which suggests that each substituent leads to a single product.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because for o/p directors, there are two possible positions. So perhaps the question is considering the para fraction relative to the possible products.

But the question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps for each substituent, the bromine adds in a single position, either ortho, meta, or para.

So in that case, the para isomer's weight fraction is 100% if the substituent directs only to para.

Wait, but that's not possible because for o/p directors, the substituent would allow substitution in ortho and para positions. So perhaps each substituent directs the bromine to either ortho, meta, or para, but in such a way that only one product is formed.

But that can't be correct because substituents like -Cl are o/p directors, so substitution occurs in either ortho or para, leading to possible multiple products.

Wait, but the question says "only one monobromo derivative is formed." So perhaps each substituent directs bromine to a single position, so that only one product is formed.

If that's the case, then the substituent must be such that substitution occurs in only one position (either ortho, meta, or para). So for each substituent, we need to determine which position is favored.

So, let's reevaluate each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3: methyl group. o/p director. But when only one product is formed, perhaps it's because the substituent directs to para only due to steric hindrance in the ortho position. So, para is the only product.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: ester group. meta director. So, substitution occurs in meta, so meta is the only product.

3) C6H5-Cl: o/p director. But perhaps due to steric hindrance, only para is formed.

4) C6H5-NO2: meta director. So meta is the only product.

5) C6H5-C2H5: ethyl group. o/p director. Due to steric hindrance, only para is formed.

6) C6H5-COOH: meta director. So meta is the only product.

Wait, but this would imply that for substituents that are o/p directors, the para is the only product because the ortho is hindered. So, for 1,3,5, their para fraction is 100% each, and for 2,4,6, para fraction is 0% each.

But the question is asking to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of para. So the order would start with those who have 0% para, followed by those with 100% para.

But wait, that can't be because all of 1,3,5 have 100% para, and 2,4,6 have 0. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the assumption is wrong.

Alternative approach: perhaps each substituent directs to a specific position, so the para fraction is either 0% or 100%.

But the options don't have that. Let's look at the options.

Options are:

A) 4<2<6<3<1<5

B)6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3

D)3<5<1<6<2<4

Wait, perhaps the substituents with meta directors have lower para fractions, and those with o/p directors have higher.

But for 1,3,5, which are o/p directors, their para fractions are higher than the meta directors.

So, the order starts with the meta directors (2,4,6) and then the o/p directors (1,3,5). But how are they ordered among themselves.

So, the order would be something like 2,4,6 (each with low para fractions) followed by 1,3,5 (with higher para fractions).

But the question is about increasing order of para fraction. So the lowest comes first.

So, the meta directors have lower para fractions than the o/p directors.

Now, within the meta directors (2,4,6), which one has the least para fraction.

Wait, but if the substituent is a meta director, the para fraction is zero, right? Because the substitution occurs in meta, so the product is meta, so the para fraction is zero.

So, for 2,4,6, para fraction is zero.

But that can't be the case because the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps the substituent directs substitution to a single position, either ortho, meta, or para.

Wait, perhaps some substituents are so strong that they only allow substitution in one position. For example, a nitro group is a strong meta director, leading to substitution only in meta. Similarly, esters are meta directors, leading to substitution only in meta.

So, for substituents 2,4,6, the para fraction is zero.

For substituents 1,3,5: o/p directors. Now, whether the substitution occurs in ortho or para. But in some cases, such as when the substituent is bulky, the para product is formed because the ortho is hindered.

So, for substituent 1 (CH3), substitution may occur in para.

Substituent 3 (Cl): Cl is a substituent that is small, so substitution can occur in ortho and para, but perhaps in this case, the para is the major product.

Substituent 5 (C2H5): the ethyl group is bulkier, so substitution occurs in para.

So, substituents 1,3,5 all lead to para substitution as the only product. So their para fractions are 100%.

But then, in the question, the order must arrange from lowest to highest para fraction.

But according to this, all meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, and the o/p directors (1,3,5) have 100% para.

So, the order would be: 2,4,6 (0% para), then 1,3,5 (100% para).

But in the options, none of them have that exactly. Let me look:

Option A: 4 < 2 < 6 <3<1<5.

But 4,2,6 are meta directors, so they are 0% para. 3,1,5 have 100% para.

But in the options, the order is 4 < 2 < 6 <3<1<5. That would imply that 4 has the lowest, then 2, then 6, then 3,1,5. But 4,2,6 have same para fraction, 0% each.

Hmm, perhaps the way the substituents affect the rate of the para substitution matters.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are not all equally strong in directing. Some substituents in the o/p directors may have higher or lower para fractions.

Wait, but the problem says each reaction forms only one monobromo derivative. So, perhaps each substituent directs to only one position.

If that's the case, then the substituents 2,4,6 (meta directors) would all have 0% para, and 1,3,5 would have 100% para.

But then, the order would be 2=4=6 < 1=3=5.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect.

Alternative approach: perhaps the substituents can have varying effects on the para fraction, even for o/p directors.

For example:

- Substituents that are strong o/p directors may have higher para fractions.

The substituents 1,3,5 are o/p directors. Now, their para fractions may vary.

Which substituent would have the highest para fraction?

Among o/p directors, perhaps the substituent which is strongly deactivating but o/p directing (like Cl) may have a higher para fraction because it's a better director.

Wait, but activating groups (like CH3, C2H5) are o/p directors, but they activate the ring, making substitution easier. But does that affect the ratio of para to ortho? Or just the overall reaction rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's ability to direct to para can affect the ratio.

Wait, let me think of specific examples:

In toluene (methyl benzene), the major product upon bromination is para (about 60% para, 40% ortho).

In chlorobenzene, the major product is para (about 58% para, 42% ortho).

In ethylbenzene, the major product is para (around 65% para).

So, substituents like -CH3, -Cl, and -C2H5 are o/p directors, and their para fractions are about similar or vary slightly.

So, in this problem, for the substituents 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), and 5 (C2H5), each will have a para fraction of about ~60% or similar.

But when arranging them, perhaps the substituent's directing strength or activating nature affects the para fraction.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the para fraction is determined by the substituent's ability to direct, and substituents that are more deactivating (but o/p directors) have higher para fractions, as they are better directors.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's nature (activating vs deactivating) affects the para fraction. For example, activating groups may have higher para fractions because they activate the ring, making substitution easier in their o/p positions.

But in any case, the question is to arrange from least to most (increasing) the para fraction.

So, the substituents which are meta directors (2,4,6) have lower para fractions, and those that are o/p have higher.

Now, within the o/p directors, which has the least para fraction.

Wait, but perhaps among the o/p directors, the substituent which is less activating (like Cl) would have a lower para fraction.

Wait, no, I think Cl is a deactivating group but still an o/p director, leading to para substitution.

But in any case, perhaps the order is 2,4,6 (lowest) followed by 1,3,5 (higher). But the options do not show this.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 3 <5<1<6<2<4.

Hmm, that's not possible since 3 is an o/p director, higher than 6 (meta).

Wait, perhaps the correct order is meta directors first, then o/p directors.

But in the options, the correct arrangement should have the meta directors in the lower end and the o/p directors higher.

Looking at option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5.

So, 4 is the lowest (NO2), then 2 (ester), then 6 (COOH), then 3 (Cl), 1 (CH3), and 5 (C2H5).

Hmm, but why would 3 (Cl) have a higher para fraction than 1 (CH3)?

Wait, perhaps Cl is a better o/p director, so it leads to a higher para fraction than CH3.

But earlier, I thought that both Cl and CH3 have similar para fractions, around 60% each.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent's ability to activate the ring affects the para fraction. For example, activating groups (like CH3, C2H5) would have higher rates of substitution, but perhaps the para fraction is similar.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is based on the substituent's directing ability, not the fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents which are deactivating but o/p directors (like Cl) have a higher para fraction than activating groups because they are better o/p directors.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged based on their activating/deactivating nature, which affects the para fraction.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let's think differently.

The question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. For each substituent, determine if the para isomer is major or minor.

As per earlier analysis:

Substituent → para fraction.

1) CH3 → major, so high.

2) COOEt → meta, so low (0).

3) Cl → major, high.

4) NO2 → meta, low (0).

5) C2H5 → major, high.

6) COOH → meta, low (0).

So, the order should be: 2,4,6 (low) → 1,3,5 (high). But in the options, the order is more detailed.

Looking at the options, we need to arrange all six in order.

So, the meta directors (2,4,6) have low para fractions, and the o/p directors (1,3,5) have high.

But the options don't have them all grouped together. Let's look at option C: 4<6<2<1<5<3.

Wait, 4,6,2 are meta directors (low), then 1,5,3 are o/p (high).

But why would 1 be before 5 and 3?

Wait, perhaps the substituents within the o/p directors have varying para fractions.

Maybe the order is based on the substituent's effect on the para fraction from least to most.

Wait, perhaps the substituents in the o/p directors have different para fractions.

Which substituent would have the least para fraction?

Wait, if substituent is a strong o/p director, the para fraction is high. But perhaps some substituents have a higher tendency to direct to ortho, thus lower para fraction.

For example, a substituent that is strongly activating and o/p directing may lead to more ortho substitution because the ring is highly activated and the substituent is small, allowing ortho attack.

Wait, methyl group (1) is activating and small, so perhaps para is the major product. But if the substituent is bulky, like ethyl (5), perhaps para is even more favored.

So, substituent 5 (C2H5) would have a higher para fraction than 1 (CH3) because of steric hindrance leading to more para substitution.

So, the order of para fraction among o/p directors is 5 > 1 >3.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. For ethyl group, which is bulkier, the ortho position is more hindered, so substitution occurs more in para. So, ethyl would have a higher para fraction than methyl.

Then, substituent 3 (Cl) is a deactivating group but is small, so perhaps in chlorobenzene, the para product is more than toluene. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps Cl is a better o/p director than methyl. So substituent 3 would have a higher para fraction than 1.

This is getting a bit too confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the relative activating strengths. The order of activating groups is: -OCH3 > -NH2 > -CH3 > -C2H5.

But I'm not sure if that affects the para fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the order of para fractions among o/p directors is 5 (C2H5) >1 (CH3) >3 (Cl).

So, the para fractions would be from low to high as: 2,4,6 (lowest), then 1, then 3, then 5 (highest).

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent with the strongest activating effect would have the highest para fraction because substitution is easier in the para position.

So, among 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), and 5 (C2H5), 1 is activating, 3 is deactivating (but o/p director), and 5 is activating but larger.

So, perhaps substituent 5 (C2H5) has the highest para fraction, then 1 (CH3), then 3 (Cl) has the least among o/p directors.

So, the order would be: 2,4,6 (lowest para), then 3, then 1, then 5.

But this is getting too speculative.

Looking back at the options, option C is 4 <6 <2 <1<5<3.

In this option, the order is:

4 (NO2, meta), 6 (COOH, meta), 2 (COOEt, meta), 1 (CH3, o/p), 5 (C2H5, o/p), 3 (Cl, o/p).

But wait, substituent 3 is an o/p director, why is it last?

Hmm, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) has a higher para fraction than 5.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents 2,4,6 have the lowest, then 1,5,3 have higher.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the order is based on the substituent's ability to activate or deactivate.

But time is limited; perhaps the correct answer is option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is from lowest to highest: 4, 2,6, then 1,3,5.

But the options don't have that exactly. Looking at option C: 4<6<2<1<5<3.

So, in option C, the order is 4 (NO2),6 (COOH),2 (COOEt),1 (CH3),5 (C2H5),3 (Cl).

But why would Cl be the last (highest para fraction)?

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) is an o/p director and has a higher para fraction than the others.

But I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a decision.

Based on substituent directing, the meta directors (2,4,6) have lower para fractions, and o/p directors (1,3,5) have higher.

Within o/p directors, the order may be 5 (C2H5) >1 (CH3) >3 (Cl).

So the order would be 4 (NO2),2 (COOEt),6 (COOH),3 (Cl),1 (CH3),5 (C2H5).

Looking at the options, which option fits this?

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5.

Yes, that matches.

So the order is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Which is option A.

To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in the electrophilic substitution reaction of bromine with the given compounds, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents attached to the benzene ring. Substituents can be either activating or deactivating, and they direct the incoming electrophile (bromine) to ortho, meta, or para positions. The weight fraction of the para-isomer depends on whether the substituent is an ortho/para (o/p) director or a meta director.

### Analysis of Each Compound:
1. **C6H5-CH3 (Methyl group)**:  
   The methyl group is an activating, o/p-directing group. Bromination occurs at the ortho and para positions, but steric hindrance at the ortho position makes the para-isomer the major product.  
   **Para fraction**: High.

2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ester group)**:  
   The ester group is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Bromination occurs predominantly at the meta positions, with no significant para-isomer formation.  
   **Para fraction**: Low (near 0).

3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorine)**:  
   The chlorine atom is a deactivating, o/p-directing group. Bromination occurs at the ortho and para positions, but steric hindrance at the ortho position makes the para-isomer the major product.  
   **Para fraction**: High.

4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitro group)**:  
   The nitro group is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group. Bromination occurs predominantly at the meta positions, with no significant para-isomer formation.  
   **Para fraction**: Low (near 0).

5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethyl group)**:  
   The ethyl group is an activating, o/p-directing group. Bromination occurs at the ortho and para positions, but steric hindrance at the ortho position makes the para-isomer the major product.  
   **Para fraction**: High.

6. **C6H5-COOH (Carboxylic acid group)**:  
   The carboxylic acid group is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Bromination occurs predominantly at the meta positions, with no significant para-isomer formation.  
   **Para fraction**: Low (near 0).

### Ranking the Compounds:
- Compounds with **meta-directing groups** (2, 4, 6) have the lowest para fractions (near 0).  
- Compounds with **o/p-directing groups** (1, 3, 5) have higher para fractions.  
- Among the o/p-directing groups, the **steric hindrance** at the ortho position increases the para fraction. Thus, the order of para fractions is:  
  **5 (C2H5) > 1 (CH3) > 3 (Cl)**.

### Final Order:
From lowest to highest para fraction:  
**4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**

This corresponds to **Option A**.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about electrophilic substitution reactions. Hmm, let me try to figure this out. The question is about ranking substances based on the weight fraction of the para-isomer produced when they react with excess bromine. The substances are numbered 1 to 6, each with a benzene ring attached to different groups.

Wait, so each of these compounds undergoes bromination. Since it's an electrophilic substitution, the groups attached to the benzene will direct where the bromine adds. And because it's a monobromination, each will form mainly one product, but the position (ortho, meta, para) depends on the directing group.

I remember that substituents can be activating or deactivating, and also they're either ortho/para directors or meta directors. Let me list each substituent and their directing effects:

1) С6H5-CH3: That's a methyl group. Methyl is an activating group because it's an electron-donating alkyl group. So it's an ortho/para director. So when this undergoes bromination, the bromine will add mainly in para and ortho positions. But because methyl is a strong activating group, para might be the major product? Or wait, no, in monosubstitution, the major product depends on the director. For methyl, since it's an activating, o/p director, the product can be more ortho or para. But wait, for bromine, which is a strongly activating electrophile, I think in bromination, the substituent directs where the Br adds.

But wait, benzene's bromination is usually with a catalyst. The substituents on the ring will direct the incoming Br. So for each compound:

1) Compound 1: C6H5-CH3 (methyl benzene or toluene). The methyl group is activating, o/p-directing. So the bromine will add more in ortho and para positions. For toluene, the para isomer is the major product because the methyl group is a strong activating group, and the para position is more accessible. Or wait, sometimes ortho can be more because of steric hindrance in para? Wait, no— for toluene, the major product is para because the ortho would have more steric hindrance from the methyl group, making para the major. So the para isomer is the major product.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: That's an ester group. The substituent is an ester, which is a meta-directing group since esters are deactivating (electron-withdrawing) but ortho/para directors? Wait, no. Wait, esters are deactivating but ortho/para directing. Because the ester has a carbonyl group which is electron-withdrawing, so it's a deactivating group. So the ring is deactivated, but the substituent is an ortho/para director. So for substitution, the bromine would enter ortho, para positions relative to the ester group. But wait, wait, actually, I'm getting confused. Let me think. Phenyl esters: the substituent is an ester, which is a meta director. Wait, no. Wait, wait, no. Wait, groups with lone pairs, like -OCH3, are ortho/para directors. Groups like -NO2 are meta directors. Ester groups (like -COOR) are deactivating and meta-directing. Wait, no. Wait, I think I might be mixing things up. Let me double-check: activating groups are o/p directors, deactivating can be o/p or meta. For example, nitro groups are deactivating and meta directors. Esters, like -COOR, are deactivating and meta directors. Because the carbonyl group is electron-withdrawing, making the ring less reactive. So, in that case, the ester group directs incoming electrophiles to meta positions. So bromine would add at meta. So the major product would be the meta isomer, not para. But wait, the question is about the para isomer's weight fraction. So if the major product is meta, then the para fraction is low.

Wait, but wait: the problem states that each substance undergoes substitution to form only one monobromo derivative. So perhaps each substituent leads to a single position being favored. So for each substituent, the para substitution's yield depends on how much the substituent directs to para.

Wait, but if the substituent is meta-directing, then the bromine would go to meta positions, which are the 3 and 5 positions relative to the substituent. So the para position (position 4) would not be the site of substitution. So in that case, the para isomer's yield would be zero? But the question says only one monobromo is formed, so perhaps each substituent directs to a single position. But that doesn't make sense for all substituents.

Wait, perhaps for the purpose of this problem, each substituent directs the bromine to either para, ortho, or meta, but in monobromination, maybe it's only one position possible due to steric factors or the substituent's influence.

Alternatively, perhaps in this problem, the substituent directs the bromine to a specific position, so each substituent's para isomer's yield is either high or low.

Wait, but the question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer in each reaction. So for each substance, when brominated, how much of the product is the para isomer.

So the plan is:

For each substituent, determine whether the para position is a major product. Then, rank them from least para to most para.

Let me go through each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3: methyl group. o/p-directing. So bromine adds to ortho and para. But for toluene, the para is the major product because the ortho position is hindered by the methyl group. So the para isomer is major. So high weight fraction of para.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: ester group. As I discussed earlier, esters are deactivating and meta-directing. So the bromine would add to the meta positions. Thus, para isomer's fraction would be low, perhaps zero. So the para isomer is not formed.

3) C6H5-Cl: chlorine. Chlorine is an ortho/para director but deactivating. So, the substituent directs to ortho and para. So the para isomer would be a major product. But wait, chlorine is a leaving group, but in bromination, it's the ring substituent that directs. So the para isomer would form. So the para fraction is high.

Wait, but wait: wait, the substituent is Cl attached to benzene. So, Cl is an ortho/para director because it's an electron-withdrawing group but has lone pairs. So, the Cl will direct Br to ortho and para. So the major product would be the para isomer because the Cl is a meta director? No, wait, sorry, Cl is an ortho/para director. So, the para isomer would be a major product.

4) C6H5-NO2: nitro group. Nitro is a strong deactivating, meta-directing group. So the bromine would add in the meta positions. Para isomer is not formed in this case. So the para fraction is zero.

Wait, but wait: nitro is meta director, so the Br would go to meta positions. So para isomer's fraction is zero.

5) C6H5-C2H5: ethyl group. Similar to methyl, it's an activating, o/p-directing group. So the major product would be para due to less steric hindrance. So high para fraction.

6) C6H5-COOH: carboxylic acid group. The substituent is -COOH, which is deactivating and meta-directing. So the bromine would add in the meta position, so para fraction is zero.

Wait, no: wait, carboxylic acid is a strong deactivating group (due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the -COOH group), and it's a meta director. So, the bromine would add in the meta with respect to the COOH group, meaning the para position isn't the site of substitution. So the para fraction would be low, perhaps zero.

Now, let's list for each substituent whether the para isomer is formed and how much.

1) Para is major: high yield of para.

2) Ester: meta director. So para's fraction is low, perhaps zero.

3) Cl: o/p director, so para is major.

4) NO2: meta, so para fraction low, zero.

5) Ethyl: o/p, para is major.

6) COOH: meta, para fraction low, zero.

Wait, but wait. Let me correct:

Substituent groups:

1) CH3: o/p (activating), so major product is para, so the para fraction is high.

2) COOEt (ester): meta director. So, the major product is meta; para fraction is low.

3) Cl: o/p director. So major product is para; high fraction.

4) NO2: meta. Para fraction is low.

5) C2H5: o/p, major para.

6) COOH: meta, para fraction low.

So now, for each compound, the para fraction:

1) High

2) Low

3) High

4) Low

5) High

6) Low

Wait, but let me check each one again.

1) Toluene (methyl): Bromine adds to para position as major product. So para fraction is >50% (maybe around 60% or higher).

2) Phenyl ester: meta director. So para is not a major product, so the para fraction is low, maybe negligible.

3) Phenyl chloride: o/p director. So the para isomer is major. Maybe similar to toluene, about 60% or higher.

4) Nitrobenzene: meta director. Para fraction is low. So, no significant para product.

5) Ethyl benzene: o/p director, so para is major. So high para fraction.

6) Phenylacetic acid (or benzoic acid derivative): meta director. So para fraction is low.

But wait, wait, what about when the substituent is a strong deactivating group but o/p director, like nitro groups are meta directors. Wait, no: nitro is a meta director. So, substituents like -Cl are o/p directors but deactivating.

Wait, let's think about the substituents again:

- CH3: activating, o/p. Para is major.

- COOEt: deactivating, meta. Para is not formed.

- Cl: deactivating, o/p. Para is major.

- NO2: deactivating, meta. Para not formed.

- C2H5: activating, o/p. Para is major.

- COOH: deactivating, meta. Para not formed.

So, the compounds with substituents that are o/p directors (1,3,5) will have higher para fractions, while those that are meta directors (2,4,6) will have lower para fractions.

Now, among those with o/p directors, which will give higher para yields.

Wait, but the substituent can influence the ratio between ortho and para. For example, a strong activating group like -OCH3 (which is more activating than -CH3) would have more para product because ortho is hindered. Similarly, for groups that are bulky, the para product is more favored.

So, looking at the substituents:

1) CH3: methyl. Not very bulky, but more activating than ethyl? Wait, ethyl is also activating but less than methyl? No, wait, ethyl is larger than methyl. So for ethyl group (5), perhaps the majority is para, but maybe less than methyl because of steric hindrance. Wait, no: I think both methyl and ethyl are not very bulky, but ethyl is larger than methyl. So, for bromination, the para position would be more favored for both, but perhaps methyl leads to a higher para fraction than ethyl? Or maybe the opposite. Hmm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the para/ortho ratios. For toluene (methyl), the para isomer is about 60%, and ortho is around 40%. For ethyl benzene, the para product is also major, but perhaps the ortho is a bit more than toluene's because the ethyl group is bulkier. Wait, no, wait: in ethylbenzene, the ethyl group is larger than methyl. So, steric hindrance in the ortho position would be more significant, which would lead to a higher para product. So perhaps ethyl has a higher para fraction than methyl.

Wait, no, I think that the opposite is true. Let me think: when the substituent is a big group, the para product is more favored because the ortho positions are hindered. So, for ethyl group (which is bigger than methyl), the para product would be more than in toluene. So, ethyl benzene's para fraction would be higher than toluene's.

Wait, but wait, I'm not entirely sure. I think I should look this up, but in the absence of that, I'll proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps it's the other way around. Let's think: toluene's major product is para, but ethylbenzene might have a higher ratio of para due to steric hindrance in the ortho.

So, perhaps the order of para fractions is:

5 (ethyl) > 1 (methyl) > 3 (Cl) ?

Wait, but let's think about Cl. The substituent is Cl, which is an o/p director but deactivating. So, the para is the major product. How does the para fraction compare to methyl and ethyl?

I think chlorobenzene's para product is the major, but maybe the para fraction is higher than toluene's because Cl is more electronegative and perhaps directs more strongly to para, or maybe because Cl is a better director.

But I'm not exactly certain. Alternatively, perhaps for Cl, the para is the major, but the ratio might be higher than toluene's.

Wait, perhaps the para fractions are as follows:

Looking at each substituent:

1. CH3: para around 60% (but I'm not sure of the exact percentage).

3. Cl: perhaps higher than CH3, maybe around 70%?

5. C2H5: perhaps highest, like 80%?

2,4,6: para fractions are low, perhaps around 10% or less.

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the relative strengths of the substituents as o/p directors.

Alternatively, perhaps the order of para fraction from least to most is:

The para fractions for each group are:

Substance 2, 4, 6: low para (since meta directors).

Substance 1,3,5: higher para.

Now, among substance 1,3,5, which has the highest para fraction?

Assuming that the meta directors (2,4,6) have the lowest para fractions, and the o/p directors (1,3,5) have higher ones.

But the question is to arrange all six in order of increasing weight fraction of para isomer. So from lowest to highest.

So, the order would be: the meta-directing groups (2,4,6) come first, then the o/p directors (1,3,5).

But within the o/p directors, which has the highest para fraction.

Wait, but the substituents in 3 is Cl, which is an o/p director but deactivating. Whereas 1 and 5 are activating.

Wait, perhaps the activating groups make the ring more reactive, so the substituent directs more strongly to para.

But wait, the presence of a substituent doesn't necessarily dictate the percentage of para versus ortho, but in this case, the question says only one monobromo is formed, which suggests that each substituent leads to a single product.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because for o/p directors, there are two possible positions. So perhaps the question is considering the para fraction relative to the possible products.

But the question states that only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps for each substituent, the bromine adds in a single position, either ortho, meta, or para.

So in that case, the para isomer's weight fraction is 100% if the substituent directs only to para.

Wait, but that's not possible because for o/p directors, the substituent would allow substitution in ortho and para positions. So perhaps each substituent directs the bromine to either ortho, meta, or para, but in such a way that only one product is formed.

But that can't be correct because substituents like -Cl are o/p directors, so substitution occurs in either ortho or para, leading to possible multiple products.

Wait, but the question says "only one monobromo derivative is formed." So perhaps each substituent directs bromine to a single position, so that only one product is formed.

If that's the case, then the substituent must be such that substitution occurs in only one position (either ortho, meta, or para). So for each substituent, we need to determine which position is favored.

So, let's reevaluate each substituent:

1) C6H5-CH3: methyl group. o/p director. But when only one product is formed, perhaps it's because the substituent directs to para only due to steric hindrance in the ortho position. So, para is the only product.

2) C6H5-COOC2H5: ester group. meta director. So, substitution occurs in meta, so meta is the only product.

3) C6H5-Cl: o/p director. But perhaps due to steric hindrance, only para is formed.

4) C6H5-NO2: meta director. So meta is the only product.

5) C6H5-C2H5: ethyl group. o/p director. Due to steric hindrance, only para is formed.

6) C6H5-COOH: meta director. So meta is the only product.

Wait, but this would imply that for substituents that are o/p directors, the para is the only product because the ortho is hindered. So, for 1,3,5, their para fraction is 100% each, and for 2,4,6, para fraction is 0% each.

But the question is asking to arrange them in order of increasing weight fraction of para. So the order would start with those who have 0% para, followed by those with 100% para.

But wait, that can't be because all of 1,3,5 have 100% para, and 2,4,6 have 0. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the assumption is wrong.

Alternative approach: perhaps each substituent directs to a specific position, so the para fraction is either 0% or 100%.

But the options don't have that. Let's look at the options.

Options are:

A) 4<2<6<3<1<5

B)6<2<4<5<1<3

C)4<6<2<1<5<3

D)3<5<1<6<2<4

Wait, perhaps the substituents with meta directors have lower para fractions, and those with o/p directors have higher.

But for 1,3,5, which are o/p directors, their para fractions are higher than the meta directors.

So, the order starts with the meta directors (2,4,6) and then the o/p directors (1,3,5). But how are they ordered among themselves.

So, the order would be something like 2,4,6 (each with low para fractions) followed by 1,3,5 (with higher para fractions).

But the question is about increasing order of para fraction. So the lowest comes first.

So, the meta directors have lower para fractions than the o/p directors.

Now, within the meta directors (2,4,6), which one has the least para fraction.

Wait, but if the substituent is a meta director, the para fraction is zero, right? Because the substitution occurs in meta, so the product is meta, so the para fraction is zero.

So, for 2,4,6, para fraction is zero.

But that can't be the case because the question says only one monobromo derivative is formed. So perhaps the substituent directs substitution to a single position, either ortho, meta, or para.

Wait, perhaps some substituents are so strong that they only allow substitution in one position. For example, a nitro group is a strong meta director, leading to substitution only in meta. Similarly, esters are meta directors, leading to substitution only in meta.

So, for substituents 2,4,6, the para fraction is zero.

For substituents 1,3,5: o/p directors. Now, whether the substitution occurs in ortho or para. But in some cases, such as when the substituent is bulky, the para product is formed because the ortho is hindered.

So, for substituent 1 (CH3), substitution may occur in para.

Substituent 3 (Cl): Cl is a substituent that is small, so substitution can occur in ortho and para, but perhaps in this case, the para is the major product.

Substituent 5 (C2H5): the ethyl group is bulkier, so substitution occurs in para.

So, substituents 1,3,5 all lead to para substitution as the only product. So their para fractions are 100%.

But then, in the question, the order must arrange from lowest to highest para fraction.

But according to this, all meta directors (2,4,6) have 0% para, and the o/p directors (1,3,5) have 100% para.

So, the order would be: 2,4,6 (0% para), then 1,3,5 (100% para).

But in the options, none of them have that exactly. Let me look:

Option A: 4 < 2 < 6 <3<1<5.

But 4,2,6 are meta directors, so they are 0% para. 3,1,5 have 100% para.

But in the options, the order is 4 < 2 < 6 <3<1<5. That would imply that 4 has the lowest, then 2, then 6, then 3,1,5. But 4,2,6 have same para fraction, 0% each.

Hmm, perhaps the way the substituents affect the rate of the para substitution matters.

Wait, perhaps the substituents are not all equally strong in directing. Some substituents in the o/p directors may have higher or lower para fractions.

Wait, but the problem says each reaction forms only one monobromo derivative. So, perhaps each substituent directs to only one position.

If that's the case, then the substituents 2,4,6 (meta directors) would all have 0% para, and 1,3,5 would have 100% para.

But then, the order would be 2=4=6 < 1=3=5.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect.

Alternative approach: perhaps the substituents can have varying effects on the para fraction, even for o/p directors.

For example:

- Substituents that are strong o/p directors may have higher para fractions.

The substituents 1,3,5 are o/p directors. Now, their para fractions may vary.

Which substituent would have the highest para fraction?

Among o/p directors, perhaps the substituent which is strongly deactivating but o/p directing (like Cl) may have a higher para fraction because it's a better director.

Wait, but activating groups (like CH3, C2H5) are o/p directors, but they activate the ring, making substitution easier. But does that affect the ratio of para to ortho? Or just the overall reaction rate.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's ability to direct to para can affect the ratio.

Wait, let me think of specific examples:

In toluene (methyl benzene), the major product upon bromination is para (about 60% para, 40% ortho).

In chlorobenzene, the major product is para (about 58% para, 42% ortho).

In ethylbenzene, the major product is para (around 65% para).

So, substituents like -CH3, -Cl, and -C2H5 are o/p directors, and their para fractions are about similar or vary slightly.

So, in this problem, for the substituents 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), and 5 (C2H5), each will have a para fraction of about ~60% or similar.

But when arranging them, perhaps the substituent's directing strength or activating nature affects the para fraction.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the para fraction is determined by the substituent's ability to direct, and substituents that are more deactivating (but o/p directors) have higher para fractions, as they are better directors.

Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent's nature (activating vs deactivating) affects the para fraction. For example, activating groups may have higher para fractions because they activate the ring, making substitution easier in their o/p positions.

But in any case, the question is to arrange from least to most (increasing) the para fraction.

So, the substituents which are meta directors (2,4,6) have lower para fractions, and those that are o/p have higher.

Now, within the o/p directors, which has the least para fraction.

Wait, but perhaps among the o/p directors, the substituent which is less activating (like Cl) would have a lower para fraction.

Wait, no, I think Cl is a deactivating group but still an o/p director, leading to para substitution.

But in any case, perhaps the order is 2,4,6 (lowest) followed by 1,3,5 (higher). But the options do not show this.

Looking at the options:

Option D: 3 <5<1<6<2<4.

Hmm, that's not possible since 3 is an o/p director, higher than 6 (meta).

Wait, perhaps the correct order is meta directors first, then o/p directors.

But in the options, the correct arrangement should have the meta directors in the lower end and the o/p directors higher.

Looking at option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5.

So, 4 is the lowest (NO2), then 2 (ester), then 6 (COOH), then 3 (Cl), 1 (CH3), and 5 (C2H5).

Hmm, but why would 3 (Cl) have a higher para fraction than 1 (CH3)?

Wait, perhaps Cl is a better o/p director, so it leads to a higher para fraction than CH3.

But earlier, I thought that both Cl and CH3 have similar para fractions, around 60% each.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent's ability to activate the ring affects the para fraction. For example, activating groups (like CH3, C2H5) would have higher rates of substitution, but perhaps the para fraction is similar.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is based on the substituent's directing ability, not the fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents which are deactivating but o/p directors (like Cl) have a higher para fraction than activating groups because they are better o/p directors.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged based on their activating/deactivating nature, which affects the para fraction.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Let's think differently.

The question is about the weight fraction of the para isomer. For each substituent, determine if the para isomer is major or minor.

As per earlier analysis:

Substituent → para fraction.

1) CH3 → major, so high.

2) COOEt → meta, so low (0).

3) Cl → major, high.

4) NO2 → meta, low (0).

5) C2H5 → major, high.

6) COOH → meta, low (0).

So, the order should be: 2,4,6 (low) → 1,3,5 (high). But in the options, the order is more detailed.

Looking at the options, we need to arrange all six in order.

So, the meta directors (2,4,6) have low para fractions, and the o/p directors (1,3,5) have high.

But the options don't have them all grouped together. Let's look at option C: 4<6<2<1<5<3.

Wait, 4,6,2 are meta directors (low), then 1,5,3 are o/p (high).

But why would 1 be before 5 and 3?

Wait, perhaps the substituents within the o/p directors have varying para fractions.

Maybe the order is based on the substituent's effect on the para fraction from least to most.

Wait, perhaps the substituents in the o/p directors have different para fractions.

Which substituent would have the least para fraction?

Wait, if substituent is a strong o/p director, the para fraction is high. But perhaps some substituents have a higher tendency to direct to ortho, thus lower para fraction.

For example, a substituent that is strongly activating and o/p directing may lead to more ortho substitution because the ring is highly activated and the substituent is small, allowing ortho attack.

Wait, methyl group (1) is activating and small, so perhaps para is the major product. But if the substituent is bulky, like ethyl (5), perhaps para is even more favored.

So, substituent 5 (C2H5) would have a higher para fraction than 1 (CH3) because of steric hindrance leading to more para substitution.

So, the order of para fraction among o/p directors is 5 > 1 >3.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think. For ethyl group, which is bulkier, the ortho position is more hindered, so substitution occurs more in para. So, ethyl would have a higher para fraction than methyl.

Then, substituent 3 (Cl) is a deactivating group but is small, so perhaps in chlorobenzene, the para product is more than toluene. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps Cl is a better o/p director than methyl. So substituent 3 would have a higher para fraction than 1.

This is getting a bit too confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the relative activating strengths. The order of activating groups is: -OCH3 > -NH2 > -CH3 > -C2H5.

But I'm not sure if that affects the para fraction.

Alternatively, perhaps the order of para fractions among o/p directors is 5 (C2H5) >1 (CH3) >3 (Cl).

So, the para fractions would be from low to high as: 2,4,6 (lowest), then 1, then 3, then 5 (highest).

But I'm not confident.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent with the strongest activating effect would have the highest para fraction because substitution is easier in the para position.

So, among 1 (CH3), 3 (Cl), and 5 (C2H5), 1 is activating, 3 is deactivating (but o/p director), and 5 is activating but larger.

So, perhaps substituent 5 (C2H5) has the highest para fraction, then 1 (CH3), then 3 (Cl) has the least among o/p directors.

So, the order would be: 2,4,6 (lowest para), then 3, then 1, then 5.

But this is getting too speculative.

Looking back at the options, option C is 4 <6 <2 <1<5<3.

In this option, the order is:

4 (NO2, meta), 6 (COOH, meta), 2 (COOEt, meta), 1 (CH3, o/p), 5 (C2H5, o/p), 3 (Cl, o/p).

But wait, substituent 3 is an o/p director, why is it last?

Hmm, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) has a higher para fraction than 5.

But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents 2,4,6 have the lowest, then 1,5,3 have higher.

But the options don't have this.

Wait, perhaps the order is based on the substituent's ability to activate or deactivate.

But time is limited; perhaps the correct answer is option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is from lowest to highest: 4, 2,6, then 1,3,5.

But the options don't have that exactly. Looking at option C: 4<6<2<1<5<3.

So, in option C, the order is 4 (NO2),6 (COOH),2 (COOEt),1 (CH3),5 (C2H5),3 (Cl).

But why would Cl be the last (highest para fraction)?

Alternatively, perhaps substituent 3 (Cl) is an o/p director and has a higher para fraction than the others.

But I'm not certain.

Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a decision.

Based on substituent directing, the meta directors (2,4,6) have lower para fractions, and o/p directors (1,3,5) have higher.

Within o/p directors, the order may be 5 (C2H5) >1 (CH3) >3 (Cl).

So the order would be 4 (NO2),2 (COOEt),6 (COOH),3 (Cl),1 (CH3),5 (C2H5).

Looking at the options, which option fits this?

Option A: 4<2<6<3<1<5.

Yes, that matches.

So the order is 4 <2 <6 <3 <1 <5.

Which is option A.


To determine the order of increasing weight fraction of the para-isomer in the electrophilic substitution reaction of bromine with the given compounds, we analyze the directing effects of the substituents attached to the benzene ring. Substituents can be either activating or deactivating, and they direct the incoming electrophile (bromine) to ortho, meta, or para positions. The weight fraction of the para-isomer depends on whether the substituent is an ortho/para (o/p) director or a meta director.

### Analysis of Each Compound:
1. **C6H5-CH3 (Methyl group)**:  
   The methyl group is an activating, o/p-directing group. Bromination occurs at the ortho and para positions, but steric hindrance at the ortho position makes the para-isomer the major product.  
   **Para fraction**: High.

2. **C6H5-COOC2H5 (Ester group)**:  
   The ester group is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Bromination occurs predominantly at the meta positions, with no significant para-isomer formation.  
   **Para fraction**: Low (near 0).

3. **C6H5-Cl (Chlorine)**:  
   The chlorine atom is a deactivating, o/p-directing group. Bromination occurs at the ortho and para positions, but steric hindrance at the ortho position makes the para-isomer the major product.  
   **Para fraction**: High.

4. **C6H5-NO2 (Nitro group)**:  
   The nitro group is a strongly deactivating, meta-directing group. Bromination occurs predominantly at the meta positions, with no significant para-isomer formation.  
   **Para fraction**: Low (near 0).

5. **C6H5-C2H5 (Ethyl group)**:  
   The ethyl group is an activating, o/p-directing group. Bromination occurs at the ortho and para positions, but steric hindrance at the ortho position makes the para-isomer the major product.  
   **Para fraction**: High.

6. **C6H5-COOH (Carboxylic acid group)**:  
   The carboxylic acid group is a deactivating, meta-directing group. Bromination occurs predominantly at the meta positions, with no significant para-isomer formation.  
   **Para fraction**: Low (near 0).

### Ranking the Compounds:
- Compounds with **meta-directing groups** (2, 4, 6) have the lowest para fractions (near 0).  
- Compounds with **o/p-directing groups** (1, 3, 5) have higher para fractions.  
- Among the o/p-directing groups, the **steric hindrance** at the ortho position increases the para fraction. Thus, the order of para fractions is:  
  **5 (C2H5) > 1 (CH3) > 3 (Cl)**.

### Final Order:
From lowest to highest para fraction:  
**4 < 2 < 6 < 3 < 1 < 5**

This corresponds to **Option A**.
