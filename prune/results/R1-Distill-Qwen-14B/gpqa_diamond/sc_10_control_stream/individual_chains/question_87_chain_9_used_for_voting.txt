Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options.

Hmm, di-substituted benzene ring. So two substituents on the benzene. The total carbons are 8. Benzene is 6 carbons, so substituents must add 2 carbons. Wait, but wait. Wait, di-substituted could mean two groups attached to the ring. Each group can have multiple carbons.

Wait, the compound is a 6-membered aromatic ring, so it's a benzene ring. So the substituents add 2 carbons in total? Or maybe each substituent has one carbon each. Or perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group and the other is a halogen. Because FTIR shows both a carbonyl and a halogen.

Wait, the FTIR has a carbonyl (C=O) stretch and an aromatic-halogen bond (like C-X, X being Cl, Br, etc.). So the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, but wait. The substituents on benzene are usually groups like -COOR, -COOH, -NO2, etc. For halogen, it's -X (like -Cl, -Br).

But the molecule's total carbons are 8. Benzene has 6, so substituents contribute 2. So each substituent must be a single atom, but that's not possible because substituents like -Cl (no carbons) and, say, a carbonyl group as another substituent.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: the compound is a di-substituted benzene, which means two substituents attached to the benzene ring. Each substituent can be a group with multiple atoms, but the total number of carbons in the entire molecule is 8.

Benzene has 6 carbons. So substituents must add 2 more. So each substituent is either a single carbon group or a combination that uses two carbons in total.

Wait, but substituents like -COOH (which is a carboxylic acid group: -COOH has 2 oxygen atoms but only one carbon (the carbonyl is one carbon, the -OH is another? Wait, no. The COOH group is -COOH: the structure is R-COOH. So that's two oxygens, one carbonyl, and one hydroxyl. But the carbon count in substituent is one (the carbonyl carbon). Because the substituent is -COOH, which is one carbon attached to two oxygen atoms.

Wait, so if the substituents are a carbonyl group (like -COOH or -COR where R is something) and a halogen (like -X, which doesn't add any carbons), then the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 1 (from carbonyl) + 0 (from X) =7. But the question says 8 carbons in total. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group that includes an oxygen but has more carbons. Maybe an ester group, like -COOR. Let's see: the ester group is -COOR, where R is an alkyl group.

If R is a methyl group, then the substituent is -COOCH3. That's one substituent with two carbons: the carbonyl carbon and the methyl carbon. So the substituent adds two carbons.

Wait, but then the other substituent is a halogen, which doesn't add any. So then total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (from COOCH3) + 0 (from X) =8. Oh, that adds up.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with two substituents: one is -COOCH3 (ester group, which is a carbonyl group) and the other is a halogen, say -Cl or -Br.

Wait, but wait: the substituents are on the benzene ring. So the two groups are -COOCH3 and -X (like Cl), attached to the benzene ring.

So the molecule is benzene with two substituents: one is a ester group (O-CO-OCH3?), wait, no. Wait, the ester group is -COOR, where R is an alkyl. So for example, if R is methyl, it's -COOCH3.

So the substituents would be -COOCH3 and -X (like Cl). So the molecule would be a di-substituted benzene with groups -COOCH3 and -X.

Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl group, which would be present in the ester (C=O). And aromatic-halogen bond, which would be the X substituent.

So the molecule would have a benzene ring with an ester group and a halogen substituent.

Now, let's think about the NMR. The options are A, B, C, D.

We need to find which NMR corresponds to this structure.

So the molecule has a benzene ring, an ester group, and a halogen.

Wait, but where are the substituents located? Since it's di-substituted, the substituents could be in ortho, meta, or para positions.

If the substituents are para, the peaks for the aromatic protons would be as two doublets, each integrating for 2H, because the two protons on each substituent's adjacent carbon would be equivalent.

Wait, but the substituents are -COOCH3 and -X. Let's say they're in the para position. So the benzene would have two substituents opposite each other.

The aromatic protons would then be two sets of two equivalent protons each. Because in para substitution, the substituent groups are across from each other, so the adjacent protons would be equivalent.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in ortho positions, the aromatic protons would be split differently.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). So this has a singlet for 1H. Maybe an aromatic proton that's deshielded, perhaps a proton adjacent to the carbonyl group. But wait, in para substitution, all aromatic Hs would be in equivalent positions. So maybe if the substituents are meta, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that one is a strong de-shielder, causing the adjacent H to be a singlet. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the NMR signals.

The ester group, -COOCH3, would have a triplet for the CH3 group, but wait, if it's attached to O, it's OCH3. So in the NMR, the OCH3 would be a singlet because all three protons are equivalent and the O is electronegative, causing deshielding. The chemical shift for OCH3 is typically around 3.7-3.9 ppm.

Looking at the options:

Option A has 3.7 ppm (2H, s). Hmm, that's a singlet of 2H, but OCH3 would be 3H. So maybe this is not the ester group.

Option C: 2.3 ppm (3H, s). That's more like a methyl group attached to something de-shielded, like a carbonyl, such as in an acetyl group. Wait, but that's a singlet, so maybe a methyl adjacent to a carbonyl, like in an acetophenone group.

Wait, but earlier I thought the substituent is an ester, but if another substituent is a halogen and the other substituent is a ketone group (like an acetyl group), perhaps. But then the carbonyl would be from the ketone.

Wait, but the question says that the FTIR has a carbonyl group. So it's either from an ester, ketone, or another carbonyl-containing group.

Hmm. Let me think again. The substituents are a carbonyl-containing group (could be ketone, ester, amide, etc.) and a halogen.

If the substituent is a ketone, it would be -CO- attached to another carbon. Wait, no, a ketone substituent on benzene would be a group like -COR, where R is an alkyl. For example, acetophenone is benzene with a -COCH3 group.

So substituents would be -COCH3 (3H singlet) and a halogen.

In that case, the NMR would have a singlet at around 2.3 ppm for the CH3 group attached to the carbonyl.

Looking at the options, option C has 2.3 ppm (3H, s), which fits this scenario. So option C would be NMR for a molecule with a ketone substituent and a halogen.

But wait, the substituents are two in number. So the molecule would have a -COCH3 group and a halogen on the benzene ring.

Wait, but then the total number of carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (from COCH3) + 0 (from X) =8. That matches the question.

So, in the NMR, we should see signals from the aromatic protons, the COCH3 group, and perhaps any other groups.

The aromatic protons would depend on the substitution pattern. If the substituents are para, the aromatic region would have two doublets, each integrating 2H. Because each substituent is opposite each other, the adjacent protons would be equivalent.

So looking at option C: it has 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). That suggests two sets of doublets, each integrating 2H, which fits a para-substituted benzene. The 2.3 ppm singlet is the methyl group attached to the carbonyl.

So in this case, the substituents are a -Cl (or Br) and a -COCH3.

Wait, but what about the halogen's effect on the aromatic protons? The halogen is an electron-withdrawing group, which deshields the adjacent protons, causing upfield or downfield shifts. Depending on where it's substituted, the neighboring protons would be more deshielded and appear downfield.

In para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other. So the aromatic protons would be in two pairs, each adjacent to a substituent.

Wait, but in the case of para substitution with two electron-withdrawing groups, the aromatic protons would be deshielded, appearing downfield. So their chemical shifts would be higher (like around 7.6-7.8 ppm), which matches option C.

So option C shows aromatic protons as two doublets, each 2H, and a singlet at 2.3 ppm, which matches the -COCH3 group.

But wait, the FTIR has a carbonyl group and a halogen. So in option C, the NMR shows a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (singlet at 2.3), which would give a strong carbonyl peak in IR. But what about the halogen?

Wait, in option C, are there any signals that correspond to the halogen's adjacent protons? Or perhaps the halogen is a substituent that doesn't have any protons. For example, Cl or Br doesn't have any protons, so the NMR wouldn't show anything for that substituent. So the NMR would only show the aromatic protons and the COCH3 methyl protons.

So in option C, the aromatic protons are 7.8 (d, 2H) and 7.6 (d, 2H). The coupling suggests that each set is coupled to one another, which is typical in para substitution where the two substituents are opposite, leading to each pair of aromatic protons being adjacent to each substituent.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the substituent positions. Let me think again: in para substitution, each substituent is on opposite carbons. So for benzene, substituents at positions 1 and 4, for example. Then, the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and the protons at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So the aromatic region would show two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That matches option C.

So option C seems to fit this scenario. The substituents are -COCH3 and -X (Cl or Br), in para positions.

Wait, but what about the other options?

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s). That's a very downfield shift, which could be an aldehyde proton. But we don't have a carbonyl group that's an aldehyde. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic proton, perhaps in a strongly deshielded position, like adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. But in our case, the substituents are para, so that's unlikely. Also, the 3.7 (2H, s) would be two protons, which doesn't fit OCH3 (which is 3H). So maybe another group.

Option B: 4.8 (d, 2H), 4.6 (d, 2H), and 1.3 (s, 3H). This looks like a group with two sets of adjacent protons, maybe an ethylene group attached to something, like an ester or something else. The 1.3 s is a methyl group. Maybe a vinyl group or something else. Not sure, but doesn't fit with our scenario of a carbonyl and a halogen.

Option D: 6.9 (s, 1H), 4.8 (d, 2H), 4.6 (d, 2H), 1.3 (s, 2H). The singlet at 6.9 could be an aromatic proton, but the presence of 4.8 and 4.6 doublets suggests some coupling, perhaps in an ethylene group. The 1.3 s is two protons, maybe a CH2 group attached to something.

Hmm, but our scenario requires a carbonyl group (like -COCH3) and a halogen, so none of these other options fit as well as option C.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: the substituent is a nitro group. But nitro groups are strong electron-withdrawing and would cause the aromatic protons to be upfield or downfield, but let's not get into that unless necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -COOR, like an ester. Let's say R is CH2CH3. Wait, but that would add more carbons. Let's see, benzene (6 carbons) plus a substituent of -COOR (where R is ethyl, so two more carbons) and another substituent of X (no carbons). So total carbons: 6 + 3 (COOR has 2 carbons in the R group plus the carbonyl carbon) = 8. Wait, COOR has R as ethyl, then the ester is -COOCH2CH3. That's three carbons in the substituent (the carbonyl C, and the two in the ethyl), so total carbons: 6 + 3 =9. But the question says 8, so that's not possible.

So maybe the substituent is -COOCH3. That's two carbons: the carbonyl and the methyl. So total 6 + 2 =8, which fits. So substituents are -COOCH3 and -X.

So the molecule would have a benzene ring with -COOCH3 and -X (Cl, Br) in para positions.

In that case, the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets (each 2H), the OCH3 as a singlet at ~3.8 ppm, and the aromatic protons would be downfield due to the electron-withdrawing effects.

Wait, but looking at option A: 3.7 ppm (2H, s) is present. But OCH3 should be a singlet of 3H, not 2H. So option A can't be correct.

So the correct NMR should have a singlet for the OCH3 group (3H) around 3.7-3.8 ppm. But none of the options except A have a singlet in that region. Option A's singlet is 2H, which doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the substituent isn't an ester but another carbonyl group, like a ketone. So substituents are -COCH3 and -X. So the structure is something like 4-chloroacetophenone.

In that case, the NMR would show the COCH3 as a singlet at around 2.3 ppm (3H, s), which is option C.

So option C's NMR data would be:

7.8 (2H, d) — aromatic protons ortho to substituents

7.6 (2H, d) — aromatic protons meta to substituents

2.3 (3H, s) — the methyl group attached to the carbonyl.

But then where are the halogen's signals? Halogens don't have protons, so they don't show up in the NMR. So that's fine.

So in this case, the NMR would look like option C. So option C would be the correct choice.

Alternatively, let me think about the possible structure. The substituents are -COCH3 and X (Cl, Br) in para positions. So the benzene would have two substituents across from each other. So the aromatic protons would be in two sets of two equivalent protons each.

In the NMR, the 7.8 (d) and 7.6 (d) would correspond to the two sets of aromatic protons. The 2.3 ppm singlet is the CH3 group.

So yes, option C matches this scenario.

Wait, but another possibility: what if the substituents are in the meta positions? Then the aromatic protons would be a triplet and a doublet or something else. But the options don't show that, so perhaps it's para.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are ortho, leading to more splitting, but the options don't show that either.

So based on this analysis, option C is the correct NMR data.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (benzene) with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (C-X). This suggests the substituents on the benzene ring are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

The total carbon count is 8, with benzene contributing 6 carbons. The remaining 2 carbons must come from the substituents. A plausible structure is benzene with a -COCH3 group (a ketone substituent) and a halogen (-X, such as -Cl or -Br) in the para position. This arrangement satisfies the total carbon count and the FTIR data.

### Analysis of the NMR Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - Peaks: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s).  
   - The singlet at 3.7 ppm corresponds to 2H, which does not match the expected OCH3 group (3H singlet). Additionally, the singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton, which is inconsistent with the ketone or ester substituents.  
   - **Not correct**.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Peaks: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s).  
   - These peaks suggest a structure with a vinyl group and a methyl group, which does not align with the presence of a carbonyl group or a halogen.  
   - **Not correct**.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Peaks: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s).  
   - The two doublets (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm) correspond to aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene, which is consistent with the substituents -COCH3 and -X. The singlet at 2.3 ppm matches the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (COCH3).  
   - **Correct**.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Peaks: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s).  
   - The singlet at 6.9 ppm suggests an isolated aromatic proton, which is inconsistent with the para-substitution pattern. The peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggest a structure with adjacent protons, which does not match the expected substituents.  
   - **Not correct**.

### Conclusion:
The correct NMR data corresponds to **Option C**, which matches the structure of a para-substituted benzene with -COCH3 and -X substituents.

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that I've prepared a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring compound with 8 carbon atoms in total. The FTIR spectrum shows a carbonyl group and an aromatic-halogen bond. I need to pick the correct 1H NMR data from the options.

Hmm, di-substituted benzene ring. So two substituents on the benzene. The total carbons are 8. Benzene is 6 carbons, so substituents must add 2 carbons. Wait, but wait. Wait, di-substituted could mean two groups attached to the ring. Each group can have multiple carbons.

Wait, the compound is a 6-membered aromatic ring, so it's a benzene ring. So the substituents add 2 carbons in total? Or maybe each substituent has one carbon each. Or perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl group and the other is a halogen. Because FTIR shows both a carbonyl and a halogen.

Wait, the FTIR has a carbonyl (C=O) stretch and an aromatic-halogen bond (like C-X, X being Cl, Br, etc.). So the substituents are a carbonyl group and a halogen.

Wait, but wait. The substituents on benzene are usually groups like -COOR, -COOH, -NO2, etc. For halogen, it's -X (like -Cl, -Br).

But the molecule's total carbons are 8. Benzene has 6, so substituents contribute 2. So each substituent must be a single atom, but that's not possible because substituents like -Cl (no carbons) and, say, a carbonyl group as another substituent.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think: the compound is a di-substituted benzene, which means two substituents attached to the benzene ring. Each substituent can be a group with multiple atoms, but the total number of carbons in the entire molecule is 8.

Benzene has 6 carbons. So substituents must add 2 more. So each substituent is either a single carbon group or a combination that uses two carbons in total.

Wait, but substituents like -COOH (which is a carboxylic acid group: -COOH has 2 oxygen atoms but only one carbon (the carbonyl is one carbon, the -OH is another? Wait, no. The COOH group is -COOH: the structure is R-COOH. So that's two oxygens, one carbonyl, and one hydroxyl. But the carbon count in substituent is one (the carbonyl carbon). Because the substituent is -COOH, which is one carbon attached to two oxygen atoms.

Wait, so if the substituents are a carbonyl group (like -COOH or -COR where R is something) and a halogen (like -X, which doesn't add any carbons), then the total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 1 (from carbonyl) + 0 (from X) =7. But the question says 8 carbons in total. So that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps one substituent is a carbonyl-containing group that includes an oxygen but has more carbons. Maybe an ester group, like -COOR. Let's see: the ester group is -COOR, where R is an alkyl group.

If R is a methyl group, then the substituent is -COOCH3. That's one substituent with two carbons: the carbonyl carbon and the methyl carbon. So the substituent adds two carbons.

Wait, but then the other substituent is a halogen, which doesn't add any. So then total carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (from COOCH3) + 0 (from X) =8. Oh, that adds up.

So the structure would be a benzene ring with two substituents: one is -COOCH3 (ester group, which is a carbonyl group) and the other is a halogen, say -Cl or -Br.

Wait, but wait: the substituents are on the benzene ring. So the two groups are -COOCH3 and -X (like Cl), attached to the benzene ring.

So the molecule is benzene with two substituents: one is a ester group (O-CO-OCH3?), wait, no. Wait, the ester group is -COOR, where R is an alkyl. So for example, if R is methyl, it's -COOCH3.

So the substituents would be -COOCH3 and -X (like Cl). So the molecule would be a di-substituted benzene with groups -COOCH3 and -X.

Wait, but the FTIR shows a carbonyl group, which would be present in the ester (C=O). And aromatic-halogen bond, which would be the X substituent.

So the molecule would have a benzene ring with an ester group and a halogen substituent.

Now, let's think about the NMR. The options are A, B, C, D.

We need to find which NMR corresponds to this structure.

So the molecule has a benzene ring, an ester group, and a halogen.

Wait, but where are the substituents located? Since it's di-substituted, the substituents could be in ortho, meta, or para positions.

If the substituents are para, the peaks for the aromatic protons would be as two doublets, each integrating for 2H, because the two protons on each substituent's adjacent carbon would be equivalent.

Wait, but the substituents are -COOCH3 and -X. Let's say they're in the para position. So the benzene would have two substituents opposite each other.

The aromatic protons would then be two sets of two equivalent protons each. Because in para substitution, the substituent groups are across from each other, so the adjacent protons would be equivalent.

Alternatively, if the substituents are in ortho positions, the aromatic protons would be split differently.

Wait, but looking at the options:

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s). So this has a singlet for 1H. Maybe an aromatic proton that's deshielded, perhaps a proton adjacent to the carbonyl group. But wait, in para substitution, all aromatic Hs would be in equivalent positions. So maybe if the substituents are meta, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are such that one is a strong de-shielder, causing the adjacent H to be a singlet. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the NMR signals.

The ester group, -COOCH3, would have a triplet for the CH3 group, but wait, if it's attached to O, it's OCH3. So in the NMR, the OCH3 would be a singlet because all three protons are equivalent and the O is electronegative, causing deshielding. The chemical shift for OCH3 is typically around 3.7-3.9 ppm.

Looking at the options:

Option A has 3.7 ppm (2H, s). Hmm, that's a singlet of 2H, but OCH3 would be 3H. So maybe this is not the ester group.

Option C: 2.3 ppm (3H, s). That's more like a methyl group attached to something de-shielded, like a carbonyl, such as in an acetyl group. Wait, but that's a singlet, so maybe a methyl adjacent to a carbonyl, like in an acetophenone group.

Wait, but earlier I thought the substituent is an ester, but if another substituent is a halogen and the other substituent is a ketone group (like an acetyl group), perhaps. But then the carbonyl would be from the ketone.

Wait, but the question says that the FTIR has a carbonyl group. So it's either from an ester, ketone, or another carbonyl-containing group.

Hmm. Let me think again. The substituents are a carbonyl-containing group (could be ketone, ester, amide, etc.) and a halogen.

If the substituent is a ketone, it would be -CO- attached to another carbon. Wait, no, a ketone substituent on benzene would be a group like -COR, where R is an alkyl. For example, acetophenone is benzene with a -COCH3 group.

So substituents would be -COCH3 (3H singlet) and a halogen.

In that case, the NMR would have a singlet at around 2.3 ppm for the CH3 group attached to the carbonyl.

Looking at the options, option C has 2.3 ppm (3H, s), which fits this scenario. So option C would be NMR for a molecule with a ketone substituent and a halogen.

But wait, the substituents are two in number. So the molecule would have a -COCH3 group and a halogen on the benzene ring.

Wait, but then the total number of carbons would be 6 (benzene) + 2 (from COCH3) + 0 (from X) =8. That matches the question.

So, in the NMR, we should see signals from the aromatic protons, the COCH3 group, and perhaps any other groups.

The aromatic protons would depend on the substitution pattern. If the substituents are para, the aromatic region would have two doublets, each integrating 2H. Because each substituent is opposite each other, the adjacent protons would be equivalent.

So looking at option C: it has 7.8 (2H, d) and 7.6 (2H, d). That suggests two sets of doublets, each integrating 2H, which fits a para-substituted benzene. The 2.3 ppm singlet is the methyl group attached to the carbonyl.

So in this case, the substituents are a -Cl (or Br) and a -COCH3.

Wait, but what about the halogen's effect on the aromatic protons? The halogen is an electron-withdrawing group, which deshields the adjacent protons, causing upfield or downfield shifts. Depending on where it's substituted, the neighboring protons would be more deshielded and appear downfield.

In para substitution, the two substituents are opposite each other. So the aromatic protons would be in two pairs, each adjacent to a substituent.

Wait, but in the case of para substitution with two electron-withdrawing groups, the aromatic protons would be deshielded, appearing downfield. So their chemical shifts would be higher (like around 7.6-7.8 ppm), which matches option C.

So option C shows aromatic protons as two doublets, each 2H, and a singlet at 2.3 ppm, which matches the -COCH3 group.

But wait, the FTIR has a carbonyl group and a halogen. So in option C, the NMR shows a methyl group attached to a carbonyl (singlet at 2.3), which would give a strong carbonyl peak in IR. But what about the halogen?

Wait, in option C, are there any signals that correspond to the halogen's adjacent protons? Or perhaps the halogen is a substituent that doesn't have any protons. For example, Cl or Br doesn't have any protons, so the NMR wouldn't show anything for that substituent. So the NMR would only show the aromatic protons and the COCH3 methyl protons.

So in option C, the aromatic protons are 7.8 (d, 2H) and 7.6 (d, 2H). The coupling suggests that each set is coupled to one another, which is typical in para substitution where the two substituents are opposite, leading to each pair of aromatic protons being adjacent to each substituent.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the substituent positions. Let me think again: in para substitution, each substituent is on opposite carbons. So for benzene, substituents at positions 1 and 4, for example. Then, the protons at positions 2 and 6 would be equivalent, and the protons at 3 and 5 would be equivalent. So the aromatic region would show two doublets, each integrating for 2H. That matches option C.

So option C seems to fit this scenario. The substituents are -COCH3 and -X (Cl or Br), in para positions.

Wait, but what about the other options?

Option A: 9.9 (1H, s). That's a very downfield shift, which could be an aldehyde proton. But we don't have a carbonyl group that's an aldehyde. Alternatively, it could be an aromatic proton, perhaps in a strongly deshielded position, like adjacent to an electron-withdrawing group. But in our case, the substituents are para, so that's unlikely. Also, the 3.7 (2H, s) would be two protons, which doesn't fit OCH3 (which is 3H). So maybe another group.

Option B: 4.8 (d, 2H), 4.6 (d, 2H), and 1.3 (s, 3H). This looks like a group with two sets of adjacent protons, maybe an ethylene group attached to something, like an ester or something else. The 1.3 s is a methyl group. Maybe a vinyl group or something else. Not sure, but doesn't fit with our scenario of a carbonyl and a halogen.

Option D: 6.9 (s, 1H), 4.8 (d, 2H), 4.6 (d, 2H), 1.3 (s, 2H). The singlet at 6.9 could be an aromatic proton, but the presence of 4.8 and 4.6 doublets suggests some coupling, perhaps in an ethylene group. The 1.3 s is two protons, maybe a CH2 group attached to something.

Hmm, but our scenario requires a carbonyl group (like -COCH3) and a halogen, so none of these other options fit as well as option C.

Wait, but wait. Another possibility: the substituent is a nitro group. But nitro groups are strong electron-withdrawing and would cause the aromatic protons to be upfield or downfield, but let's not get into that unless necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -COOR, like an ester. Let's say R is CH2CH3. Wait, but that would add more carbons. Let's see, benzene (6 carbons) plus a substituent of -COOR (where R is ethyl, so two more carbons) and another substituent of X (no carbons). So total carbons: 6 + 3 (COOR has 2 carbons in the R group plus the carbonyl carbon) = 8. Wait, COOR has R as ethyl, then the ester is -COOCH2CH3. That's three carbons in the substituent (the carbonyl C, and the two in the ethyl), so total carbons: 6 + 3 =9. But the question says 8, so that's not possible.

So maybe the substituent is -COOCH3. That's two carbons: the carbonyl and the methyl. So total 6 + 2 =8, which fits. So substituents are -COOCH3 and -X.

So the molecule would have a benzene ring with -COOCH3 and -X (Cl, Br) in para positions.

In that case, the NMR would show the aromatic protons as two doublets (each 2H), the OCH3 as a singlet at ~3.8 ppm, and the aromatic protons would be downfield due to the electron-withdrawing effects.

Wait, but looking at option A: 3.7 ppm (2H, s) is present. But OCH3 should be a singlet of 3H, not 2H. So option A can't be correct.

So the correct NMR should have a singlet for the OCH3 group (3H) around 3.7-3.8 ppm. But none of the options except A have a singlet in that region. Option A's singlet is 2H, which doesn't fit.

Wait, maybe the substituent isn't an ester but another carbonyl group, like a ketone. So substituents are -COCH3 and -X. So the structure is something like 4-chloroacetophenone.

In that case, the NMR would show the COCH3 as a singlet at around 2.3 ppm (3H, s), which is option C.

So option C's NMR data would be:

7.8 (2H, d) — aromatic protons ortho to substituents

7.6 (2H, d) — aromatic protons meta to substituents

2.3 (3H, s) — the methyl group attached to the carbonyl.

But then where are the halogen's signals? Halogens don't have protons, so they don't show up in the NMR. So that's fine.

So in this case, the NMR would look like option C. So option C would be the correct choice.

Alternatively, let me think about the possible structure. The substituents are -COCH3 and X (Cl, Br) in para positions. So the benzene would have two substituents across from each other. So the aromatic protons would be in two sets of two equivalent protons each.

In the NMR, the 7.8 (d) and 7.6 (d) would correspond to the two sets of aromatic protons. The 2.3 ppm singlet is the CH3 group.

So yes, option C matches this scenario.

Wait, but another possibility: what if the substituents are in the meta positions? Then the aromatic protons would be a triplet and a doublet or something else. But the options don't show that, so perhaps it's para.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are ortho, leading to more splitting, but the options don't show that either.

So based on this analysis, option C is the correct NMR data.


The compound is a di-substituted 6-membered aromatic ring (benzene) with a total of 8 carbon atoms. The FTIR spectrum indicates the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an aromatic-halogen bond (C-X). This suggests the substituents on the benzene ring are a carbonyl-containing group and a halogen.

The total carbon count is 8, with benzene contributing 6 carbons. The remaining 2 carbons must come from the substituents. A plausible structure is benzene with a -COCH3 group (a ketone substituent) and a halogen (-X, such as -Cl or -Br) in the para position. This arrangement satisfies the total carbon count and the FTIR data.

### Analysis of the NMR Options:
1. **Option A**:  
   - Peaks: 9.9 (1H, s), 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 3.7 (2H, s).  
   - The singlet at 3.7 ppm corresponds to 2H, which does not match the expected OCH3 group (3H singlet). Additionally, the singlet at 9.9 ppm suggests an aldehyde proton, which is inconsistent with the ketone or ester substituents.  
   - **Not correct**.

2. **Option B**:  
   - Peaks: 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (3H, s).  
   - These peaks suggest a structure with a vinyl group and a methyl group, which does not align with the presence of a carbonyl group or a halogen.  
   - **Not correct**.

3. **Option C**:  
   - Peaks: 7.8 (2H, d), 7.6 (2H, d), 2.3 (3H, s).  
   - The two doublets (7.8 ppm and 7.6 ppm) correspond to aromatic protons in a para-substituted benzene, which is consistent with the substituents -COCH3 and -X. The singlet at 2.3 ppm matches the methyl group attached to the carbonyl (COCH3).  
   - **Correct**.

4. **Option D**:  
   - Peaks: 6.9 (1H, s), 4.8 (2H, d), 4.6 (2H, d), 1.3 (2H, s).  
   - The singlet at 6.9 ppm suggests an isolated aromatic proton, which is inconsistent with the para-substitution pattern. The peaks at 4.8 and 4.6 ppm suggest a structure with adjacent protons, which does not match the expected substituents.  
   - **Not correct**.

### Conclusion:
The correct NMR data corresponds to **Option C**, which matches the structure of a para-substituted benzene with -COCH3 and -X substituents.
