Okay, I need to solve this physics problem about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

So, the problem says that there's an alien astronaut who is 22 years old, and they're traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. Their spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The question is asking how long the journey will take from the astronaut's perspective, and whether they'll survive the trip considering their average lifetime is 150 solar years.

Wait, wait. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. That's from Einstein's theory of relativity. Time dilation means that time moves slower for the moving object (the spaceship) relative to a stationary observer (like someone on Earth). But wait, in this problem, the question is about the astronaut's own experienced time, right? So for them, the time would be shorter compared to what an Earth observer would see.

Wait no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The astronaut is in the spaceship, so from their frame of reference, they're stationary and Earth is moving towards them at a high speed. But I'm a bit confused about which frame's perspective we're considering for the time experienced. Oh, the question says, "from the point of view of the astronaut." So we need to calculate the proper time, which is the time measured by the astronaut.

Proper time is the shortest time interval between two events (like departure and arrival) measured in the rest frame of the traveler. So, the astronaut's own clock will show less time than what an Earth-based observer would measure.

But wait, I think I should first figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, isn't it? I think it's about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. So the distance is approximately 163,000 light-years.

Wait, but if the spaceship is moving at 0.99999987c, then from Earth's perspective, the time taken would be distance divided by speed. So, time in Earth's frame is (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987c). Since light-year divided by c gives years, the calculation would be:

Time_earth = 163,000 ly / (0.99999987 * c) ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ roughly 163,000 * (1 / 0.99999987) ≈ almost 163,000 years.

Wait, that seems way too long. But the astronaut is only 22 years old with a lifetime of 150 years. So 163,000 years would mean they are way beyond their lifespan. But that can't be right because when you're moving at such a high speed, time from the astronaut's perspective is less. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, no, the Earth is in the Large Magellanic Cloud's vicinity? Actually, no, the LMC is a separate galaxy. So the distance is about 163,000 light-years as I thought.

But wait, the problem is from the astronaut's point of view. So for them, the distance is contracted. Length contraction is another aspect of special relativity. The proper length (distance measured in Earth's frame) is L0 = 163,000 ly. The length in the astronaut's frame would be L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let me compute that.

v = 0.99999987c. So v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 0.99999974. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.00000026. The square root of that is sqrt(0.00000026). Let me compute that. Hmm, 0.00000026 is 2.6e-7. The square root of 2.6e-7 is approximately 0.00051e-3, wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4. Because 5e-4 squared is 25e-8, which is 2.5e-7. Close enough. So sqrt is about 0.0005099.

So the length contraction factor is gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Wait, no, wait: length contraction is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), but wait, no, I think I'm getting it mixed up. Wait, the proper length is L0 (Earth's frame), and the moving frame (spaceship) sees the length contracted: L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So L is much shorter than L0 because v is very close to c.

Wait, so let me calculate L = 163,000 ly * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2). So sqrt(1 - v²) is sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) which is sqrt(1 - 0.99999974) = sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 0.0005099.

So L ≈ 163,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ let's compute that. 163,000 is 1.63e5. So 1.63e5 * 5.099e-4 = 1.63e5 * 5.099e-4 = (1.63 * 5.099) * 1e1. Let's compute 1.63 * 5.099. 1.63 *5 is 8.15, 1.63*0.099 ≈ 0.16137. So total approx 8.31137. Then 8.31137 * 1e1 is 83.1137 ≈ 83.11 light-years.

Wait, that's a big difference. So from the astronaut's perspective, the distance to Earth is only about 83 light-years. So the time they experience is the contracted distance divided by their speed. But wait, the astronaut is moving at 0.99999987c relative to Earth, so in their own frame, Earth is approaching them at 0.99999987c.

So the time from the astronaut's perspective is t' = L / v = 83.11 ly / (0.99999987c). Since 1 ly at speed c takes 1 year, so time is roughly 83.11 / 0.99999987 ≈ approx 83.11 * 1.00000013 ≈ 83.11 + 0.000108 ≈ ~83.11 years.

Wait, that's about 83 years. But wait, the astronaut is 22 years old, so 83 years would mean they're 22 + 83 = 105 years old upon arrival. Since their average lifetime is 150 years, that leaves them with a lifespan of another 45 years, so they would live to reach Earth.

Wait, but wait, 83 years is not one of the options. The options are 72, 77, 81, or maybe A says the astronaut will die before reaching.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me check again.

Wait, the distance from the astronaut's perspective is indeed much shorter, so let's recalculate the contraction. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake with the square root. Let me compute sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) more accurately. Let me compute (0.99999987)^2: 0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Let me compute 0.99999987 * 0.99999987:

= (1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00000026 + negligible.

So 1 - (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 0.00000026. The square root of 0.00000026 is sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4, as I did before.

So L = 163,000 * 5.099e-4 ≈ 163,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 83.11 light-years.

So the time experienced by the astronaut is 83.11 / 0.99999987 ≈ 83.11 * (1 + ~0.00000013) ≈ 83.11 + 0.0108 ≈ 83.12 years.

Wait, but the options don't have 83. The closest is option C) 81 and D)77, but 83 isn't there. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: using the time dilation formula. The proper time (τ) is the time experienced by the astronaut. The Earth-based time is t, and the relationship is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but what is t? t is the time in Earth's frame for the trip. So t would be distance divided by speed. So in Earth's frame, the distance is 163,000 ly, speed is 0.99999987c. So t = 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * (1 / 0.99999987) ≈ 163,000 * 1.00000013 = approximately 163,000 + (163,000 * 0.00000013) ≈ 163,000 + 0.021 ≈ 163,000.021 years.

So τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 163,000.021 * sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 163,000.021 * 5.099e-4 ≈ 163,000 * 5.099e-4 ≈ 83.11 years, which is what I got before.

So the astronaut's experienced time is about 83 years. But none of the options match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the sqrt(0.00000026). Let me compute that more accurately.

Let me compute 0.00000026:

That's 2.6e-7.

The square root of 2.6e-7 is sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5. Because sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 3.162e-4.

Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612. So 1.612 * 3.162e-4 ≈ 5.099e-4, as before.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the distance is not 163,000 light-years but something else. Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away, but perhaps the distance isn't that. Alternatively, maybe I should use a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the actual distance but about the time experienced. Wait, but the question says the spacecraft is traveling from the LMC to Earth. So I think the distance is about 163,000 ly.

Wait, but in the problem, the speed is 0.99999987c, which is extremely close to c. So the time experienced by the astronaut would be much less than the time observed from Earth.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the problem is being approached using the Lorentz factor gamma.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). When v is 0.99999987c, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1960. So gamma is approximately 1960.

So from Earth's frame, the time taken is t = distance / speed = 163,000 ly / 0.99999987c ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 163,000.021 years.

The astronaut's proper time is τ = t / gamma. Because τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 1/gamma.

So τ = t / gamma ≈ 163,000.021 / 1960 ≈ let's compute that.

163,000 / 1960 ≈ approx 83.11 years. So again, same result.

But the options don't have 83. So I'm either making a mistake, or perhaps the given options have a typo, but let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) The astronaut will die before reaching Earth.

B) 72 years

C) 81 years

D) 77 years

Wait, 83 is not among them. The closest is option C) 81.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the distance. Wait, perhaps the distance is 70,000 light-years? Wait, no, the LMC is about 163,000 ly away.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the speed is 0.99999987c, which is 0.99999987 times c, so when calculating gamma, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute gamma more precisely.

v = 0.99999987c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² = approximately 0.99999974 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 0.0005099.

So gamma = 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1960.08.

So τ = t / gamma = (163000 / (0.99999987)) / 1960.08.

Wait, 163000 / 0.99999987 is about 163000.021, as before.

So 163000.021 / 1960.08 ≈ let me compute that.

163000 ÷ 1960 = let's see.

1960 * 83 = 163,  1960 *80=156,800. 1960*3=5880. So 80+3=83 → 156,800 +5880=162,680. Hmm, 1960 *83= 162,680. But 162,680 is less than 163,000. 163,000 - 162,680=320.

So 320 / 1960 ≈ 0.163. So 83.163.

Wait, approximately 83.16 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 83 years. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options given, option C is 81, which is the closest. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the distance.

Wait another thing: maybe the distance is not 163,000 light-years. For the sake of the problem, perhaps it's closer. Let me think: maybe the distance from LMC to Earth is considered as 80,000 light-years. Wait, no, in reality it's about 160,000-170,000 ly, but perhaps the problem uses a different figure, like 70,000 ly.

If the distance were, say, 70,000 light-years, then:

t = 70,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 70,000 years.

τ = t / gamma ≈ 70,000 / 1960 ≈ approximately 35.7 years.

But that's not any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the LMC's actual distance but a hypothetical distance that allows the time experienced to be around 70-80 years. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation approach.

Wait, another approach: using the time experienced by the astronaut.

The time experienced would be the proper time, which is calculated as:

τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Given that, perhaps the problem assumes that the distance is D = v * t_earth.

So for the astronaut, the time is D / (v * gamma), since they are moving and D is the contracted length.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute using the formula:

τ = (distance in Earth frame) / (gamma * v).

Yes, because τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (D/(v)) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) / v.

So, τ = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) / v.

Let me plug in the numbers.

v = 0.99999987c.

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 0.0005099 as before.

So, τ = D * 0.0005099 / 0.99999987.

Since D is in light-years, and v is in terms of c, when we divide by v (in ly/year), the units work out.

So τ = D * (0.0005099 / 0.99999987) ≈ D * 0.0005099.

Wait, because 0.99999987 is approximately 1, so 0.0005099 /0.99999987 ≈ 0.0005099.

So τ ≈ D * 0.0005099 years.

Wait, but D is in light-years, so that would be τ ≈ D * 0.0005099 years.

Wait, that can't be right because 1 light-year at 0.99999987c takes about 1 year. So perhaps my formula is wrong.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should express D as the Earth frame distance (163,000 ly) and compute τ = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) / v.

So τ = (163,000 ly) * (0.0005099) / (0.99999987c).

Wait, the units: (ly) * (dimensionless) / (c) → time in years.

Because ly / (c) is (ly) / (ly/year) ) = years.

So τ = 163,000 * 0.0005099 / 0.99999987.

Compute this:

163,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 163,000 * 0.0005 = 81.5, and 163,000 * 0.0000099≈ ~1.6137. So total ≈ 81.5 + 1.6137 ≈ 83.1137.

Then divide by 0.99999987 ≈ 83.1137 / 0.99999987 ≈ 83.1137 * 1.00000013 ≈ 83.1137 + 0.000108 ≈ 83.1138 years.

Again, about 83 years. So the astronaut would experience 83 years. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but in the options, the closest is C) 81. Or maybe I made a mistake in the distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is given as 80,000 light-years, but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, the problem says the LMC, but perhaps the distance is different.

Wait, perhaps I should think of another approach. Let me consider that the average lifetime is 150 solar years. So the astronaut is 22, so they have about 128 years left on Earth's frame. But from their own frame, their lifespan is longer due to time dilation. Wait, no, their own lifespan is 150 years from their perspective. Wait, time dilation works such that moving clocks run slower from the perspective of a stationary observer. So from Earth's frame, the astronaut's lifespan would be shorter. But in this problem, the astronaut's own perspective is what matters. So their own lifespan is 150 years, and the trip takes 83 years from their perspective. So they would survive and reach Earth.

But the question is about how long the trip takes from their perspective, not whether they die. So the options are about the trip duration, not their lifespan.

But the options say, if it's 83 years, and the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake. Or perhaps the distance is different.

Wait, maybe the distance is 80,000 light-years. Let me try that.

τ = 80,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 40.79 years. So that's 40 years, but that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.99999987c, but when I compute gamma, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute gamma accurately.

v = 0.99999987c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² = (0.99999987 * 0.99999987) c².

Calculating 0.99999987 * 0.99999987:

Let me compute it as (1 - 0.00000013) * (1 - 0.00000013) = 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00000026 + 1.69e-13 ≈ 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) is approximately 0.0005099.

Thus, gamma is 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1960.08.

So, for a distance D in Earth's frame, time from Earth is t = D / v.

Proper time τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (D/(v)) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So τ = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) / v.

If D is 163,000 ly:

tau = 163000 * 0.0005099 / 0.99999987.

So 163000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 83.1137.

Divide by 0.99999987: ~83.1137 years.

So again, 83 years.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, because 83 years is longer than the astronaut's remaining lifespan of 128 years (150 -22=128). Wait, no, because 83 is less than 128. So the astronaut would live to reach Earth.

Wait, but the options don't include 83. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.

B) 72 years

C) 81 years

D) 77 years

Wait, 83 is not an option, so perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the closest is C) 81.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is A, but that doesn't make sense because 83 years is less than the astronaut's lifespan.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the distance is much less. Let me think, what if the distance were 77 light-years? Then τ = 77 * 0.0005099 ≈ 0.0393 years, which is about 14 days. That doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach. Maybe using the formula for time experienced in terms of velocity.

Wait, another formula I remember is that the time experienced by the traveler (proper time) is tau = D * sqrt(1 - v^2) / v.

Wait, but D is in the Earth's frame, so D is 163,000 ly, v is 0.99999987c.

So tau = 163000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) / (0.99999987) * (ly/ (c)).

Wait, sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) is 0.0005099.

So tau = 163000 * 0.0005099 / 0.99999987.

Again, 163000 * 0.0005099 = 83.1137.

Divided by 0.99999987 is ~83.1137 → same as before.

Hmm. So perhaps the intended answer is C) 81 years, but it's not matching my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.9999c, making the calculation easier.

Wait, let me try that. Suppose the speed were 0.9999c.

v=0.9999c.

v²/c²=0.99980001.

1 - v²/c²= 0.00019999.

sqrt(0.00019999)= approx 0.014142.

Gamma =1/0.014142≈70.71.

Time from Earth frame: t=163000 /0.9999≈163,000*1.0001=163,163 years.

Proper time tau= t * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) =163163 *0.014142≈ approx 2307 years. No, that can't be. Hmm, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, if speed is 0.9999c, then from Earth's frame, the time is about 163,000/0.9999≈163,016 years. Then tau=163,016 * sqrt(1 - (0.9999)^2) = 163,016 * 0.014142 ≈ 2307 years. That's way longer than the astronaut's lifespan, so they would die.

But the original problem's speed is 0.99999987c, which is much faster, so the time would be much shorter, making the astronaut's experienced time about 83 years.

But again, the options don't have 83.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the Earth as the destination is the same galaxy, but perhaps the distance is only a few thousand light-years. But that doesn't fit the LMC's position.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a simpler calculation without considering length contraction and just using time dilation.

In that case, the time from Earth's perspective is t= D /v.

Proper time tau= t * sqrt(1 -v^2/c^2).

If D is 163,000 ly, v=0.99999987c.

t=163,000 /0.99999987 ≈163,000.021 years.

tau=163,000.021 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) =163,000.021 * 0.0005099≈83.113 years.

Again, same result.

So given that none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is that the astronaut will survive, but the time is approximately 83 years, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct choice is A, but that would imply the time is more than 150-22=128 years, which it's not.

Wait, the astronaut is 22 years old, and their average lifetime is 150 years. So they have 128 years left. If the trip takes 83 years from their perspective, they would live to reach Earth. So option A is incorrect.

Looking back at the options:

A) Astronaut will die before reaching Earth.

But with 83 years, they would live. So A is incorrect.

So the correct answer must be the age they are when they arrive: 22 +83=105, which is within 150. So they survive. But the question is about how long the trip takes, which is 83 years. Since none of the options match, perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the Lorentz factor in a different way. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should compute the gamma and then find tau.

Gamma is approximately 1960.

Time from Earth's perspective is t = 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈163,000 years.

Tau = t / gamma = 163,000 / 1960 ≈83.11 years.

Yes, same result.

Hmm. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is 83 years, but it's not an option. So perhaps the closest is C)81 years.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is given as 80,000 ly. Let's see.

If D=80,000 ly, then tau=80,000 *0.0005099 /0.99999987 ≈40.79 years.

Nope, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the speed is 0.99999987c, but the calculation is done with a rough approximation of v as 0.9999c.

Wait, let me compute with v=0.9999c.

Then 1 - v^2/c^2= 1 - (0.9999)^2 =1-0.99980001=0.00019999.

sqrt(0.00019999)=0.014142.

Gamma=1/0.014142=70.71.

Tau= D * sqrt(1 -v^2/c^2) /v.

For D=163,000 ly:

tau=163000 * 0.014142 /0.9999 ≈163000 *0.014142 ≈2,307 years.

Then divided by 0.9999 is ~2307. So tau= approx 2307 years. Which is way longer than 150 years, so the astronaut would die. So that would choose option A.

But the original problem's speed is 0.99999987c, which is much higher than 0.9999c, leading to a much shorter tau.

But perhaps the problem intended to use a different speed, leading to option A.

But given that, perhaps the intended answer is option A because the time taken is too long, but that's only if the speed were lower.

Wait, but in our problem, the speed is very high, so the time is only 83 years, which is acceptable.

But since the options don't include 83, perhaps the correct answer is C)81 years. Maybe the problem expects a rounded figure.

But I'm stuck. Since I can't see any error in my calculations, I think the correct answer is approximately 83 years, but since that's not an option, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the intended answer is option D)77 years.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation for gamma.

Wait, v=0.99999987c.

Let me compute (1 -v²/c²) accurately.

(0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 0.00000013)^2 =1 - 2*(0.00000013) + (0.00000013)^2 ≈1 - 0.00000026 + negligible.

So 1 - v²/c^2=0.00000026.

sqrt(0.00000026)=sqrt(2.6e-7)=5.099e-4.

So gamma=1/5.099e-4≈1960.08.

So tau= t_earth * sqrt(1 -v^2/c^2) = (163000 / 0.99999987) *5.099e-4.

163000 / 0.99999987=163,000.021.

Multiply by 5.099e-4:

163000.021 * 0.0005099= approx 83.11.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck, but I'll proceed to choose the closest option, which is C)81 years. But I'm not confident.

To determine how long the astronaut's journey will take from their perspective, we analyze the problem using the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and length contraction.

### Key Information:
1. **Distance to Earth**: The Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 163,000 light-years away from Earth.
2. **Spacecraft Speed**: \( v = 0.99999987c \), where \( c \) is the speed of light.
3. **Astronaut's Perspective**: The time experienced by the astronaut is the proper time (\( \tau \)), which is shorter than the time measured in Earth's frame (\( t \)) due to time dilation.

### Time Dilation Formula:
The proper time experienced by the astronaut is given by:
\[
\tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]
where \( t \) is the time measured in Earth's frame.

### Step 1: Calculate Time in Earth's Frame (\( t \))
The time taken for the journey in Earth's frame is:
\[
t = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{163,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c}
\]
Since \( 1 \, \text{ly} / c = 1 \, \text{year} \), this simplifies to:
\[
t \approx 163,000 / 0.99999987 \approx 163,000.021 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Proper Time (\( \tau \))
The time dilation factor is:
\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{1 - (0.99999987)^2} = \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 0.0005099.
\]
Thus, the proper time is:
\[
\tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 163,000.021 \cdot 0.0005099 \approx 83.11 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the Options
The astronaut's lifespan is 150 years, and they are currently 22 years old. From their perspective, the journey takes approximately **83 years**, which is less than their remaining lifespan (150 - 22 = 128 years). Therefore, the astronaut will survive the trip.

The calculated proper time (\( \tau \approx 83 \, \text{years} \)) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **C) 81 years**. Given the approximations and potential rounding in the problem, this is the most reasonable choice.

### Conclusion:
The astronaut will experience approximately 83 years during the journey, but since this value is not listed, the closest option is **C) 81 years**.

Answer: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, I need to solve this physics problem about space travel and time dilation. Hmm, let me think through it step by step.

So, the problem says that there's an alien astronaut who is 22 years old, and they're traveling from the Large Magellanic Cloud to Earth. Their spacecraft is moving at 0.99999987 times the speed of light, which is super fast. The question is asking how long the journey will take from the astronaut's perspective, and whether they'll survive the trip considering their average lifetime is 150 solar years.

Wait, wait. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, time dilation occurs. That's from Einstein's theory of relativity. Time dilation means that time moves slower for the moving object (the spaceship) relative to a stationary observer (like someone on Earth). But wait, in this problem, the question is about the astronaut's own experienced time, right? So for them, the time would be shorter compared to what an Earth observer would see.

Wait no, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. The astronaut is in the spaceship, so from their frame of reference, they're stationary and Earth is moving towards them at a high speed. But I'm a bit confused about which frame's perspective we're considering for the time experienced. Oh, the question says, "from the point of view of the astronaut." So we need to calculate the proper time, which is the time measured by the astronaut.

Proper time is the shortest time interval between two events (like departure and arrival) measured in the rest frame of the traveler. So, the astronaut's own clock will show less time than what an Earth-based observer would measure.

But wait, I think I should first figure out the distance between the Large Magellanic Cloud and Earth. Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, isn't it? I think it's about 163,000 light-years away from Earth. So the distance is approximately 163,000 light-years.

Wait, but if the spaceship is moving at 0.99999987c, then from Earth's perspective, the time taken would be distance divided by speed. So, time in Earth's frame is (163,000 ly) / (0.99999987c). Since light-year divided by c gives years, the calculation would be:

Time_earth = 163,000 ly / (0.99999987 * c) ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ roughly 163,000 * (1 / 0.99999987) ≈ almost 163,000 years.

Wait, that seems way too long. But the astronaut is only 22 years old with a lifetime of 150 years. So 163,000 years would mean they are way beyond their lifespan. But that can't be right because when you're moving at such a high speed, time from the astronaut's perspective is less. So maybe I'm approaching this wrong.

Wait, no, the Earth is in the Large Magellanic Cloud's vicinity? Actually, no, the LMC is a separate galaxy. So the distance is about 163,000 light-years as I thought.

But wait, the problem is from the astronaut's point of view. So for them, the distance is contracted. Length contraction is another aspect of special relativity. The proper length (distance measured in Earth's frame) is L0 = 163,000 ly. The length in the astronaut's frame would be L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let me compute that.

v = 0.99999987c. So v²/c² = (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 0.99999974. So 1 - v²/c² ≈ 0.00000026. The square root of that is sqrt(0.00000026). Let me compute that. Hmm, 0.00000026 is 2.6e-7. The square root of 2.6e-7 is approximately 0.00051e-3, wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, sqrt(0.00000026) = sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4. Because 5e-4 squared is 25e-8, which is 2.5e-7. Close enough. So sqrt is about 0.0005099.

So the length contraction factor is gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Wait, no, wait: length contraction is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), but wait, no, I think I'm getting it mixed up. Wait, the proper length is L0 (Earth's frame), and the moving frame (spaceship) sees the length contracted: L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So L is much shorter than L0 because v is very close to c.

Wait, so let me calculate L = 163,000 ly * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2). So sqrt(1 - v²) is sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) which is sqrt(1 - 0.99999974) = sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 0.0005099.

So L ≈ 163,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ let's compute that. 163,000 is 1.63e5. So 1.63e5 * 5.099e-4 = 1.63e5 * 5.099e-4 = (1.63 * 5.099) * 1e1. Let's compute 1.63 * 5.099. 1.63 *5 is 8.15, 1.63*0.099 ≈ 0.16137. So total approx 8.31137. Then 8.31137 * 1e1 is 83.1137 ≈ 83.11 light-years.

Wait, that's a big difference. So from the astronaut's perspective, the distance to Earth is only about 83 light-years. So the time they experience is the contracted distance divided by their speed. But wait, the astronaut is moving at 0.99999987c relative to Earth, so in their own frame, Earth is approaching them at 0.99999987c.

So the time from the astronaut's perspective is t' = L / v = 83.11 ly / (0.99999987c). Since 1 ly at speed c takes 1 year, so time is roughly 83.11 / 0.99999987 ≈ approx 83.11 * 1.00000013 ≈ 83.11 + 0.000108 ≈ ~83.11 years.

Wait, that's about 83 years. But wait, the astronaut is 22 years old, so 83 years would mean they're 22 + 83 = 105 years old upon arrival. Since their average lifetime is 150 years, that leaves them with a lifespan of another 45 years, so they would live to reach Earth.

Wait, but wait, 83 years is not one of the options. The options are 72, 77, 81, or maybe A says the astronaut will die before reaching.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me check again.

Wait, the distance from the astronaut's perspective is indeed much shorter, so let's recalculate the contraction. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake with the square root. Let me compute sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) more accurately. Let me compute (0.99999987)^2: 0.99999987 * 0.99999987.

Let me compute 0.99999987 * 0.99999987:

= (1 - 0.00000013)^2 = 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00000026 + negligible.

So 1 - (0.99999987)^2 ≈ 0.00000026. The square root of 0.00000026 is sqrt(2.6e-7) ≈ 5.099e-4, as I did before.

So L = 163,000 * 5.099e-4 ≈ 163,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 83.11 light-years.

So the time experienced by the astronaut is 83.11 / 0.99999987 ≈ 83.11 * (1 + ~0.00000013) ≈ 83.11 + 0.0108 ≈ 83.12 years.

Wait, but the options don't have 83. The closest is option C) 81 and D)77, but 83 isn't there. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another approach: using the time dilation formula. The proper time (τ) is the time experienced by the astronaut. The Earth-based time is t, and the relationship is τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Wait, but what is t? t is the time in Earth's frame for the trip. So t would be distance divided by speed. So in Earth's frame, the distance is 163,000 ly, speed is 0.99999987c. So t = 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * (1 / 0.99999987) ≈ 163,000 * 1.00000013 = approximately 163,000 + (163,000 * 0.00000013) ≈ 163,000 + 0.021 ≈ 163,000.021 years.

So τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 163,000.021 * sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 163,000.021 * 5.099e-4 ≈ 163,000 * 5.099e-4 ≈ 83.11 years, which is what I got before.

So the astronaut's experienced time is about 83 years. But none of the options match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the sqrt(0.00000026). Let me compute that more accurately.

Let me compute 0.00000026:

That's 2.6e-7.

The square root of 2.6e-7 is sqrt(2.6) * 1e-3.5. Because sqrt(1e-7) is 1e-3.5, which is 3.162e-4.

Wait, sqrt(2.6) is about 1.612. So 1.612 * 3.162e-4 ≈ 5.099e-4, as before.

So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the distance is not 163,000 light-years but something else. Wait, the Large Magellanic Cloud is about 163,000 light-years away, but perhaps the distance isn't that. Alternatively, maybe I should use a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't about the actual distance but about the time experienced. Wait, but the question says the spacecraft is traveling from the LMC to Earth. So I think the distance is about 163,000 ly.

Wait, but in the problem, the speed is 0.99999987c, which is extremely close to c. So the time experienced by the astronaut would be much less than the time observed from Earth.

Wait, but wait. Maybe the problem is being approached using the Lorentz factor gamma.

Gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²). When v is 0.99999987c, gamma is 1 / sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) = 1 / sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1960. So gamma is approximately 1960.

So from Earth's frame, the time taken is t = distance / speed = 163,000 ly / 0.99999987c ≈ 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 163,000 * 1.00000013 ≈ 163,000.021 years.

The astronaut's proper time is τ = t / gamma. Because τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), and sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is 1/gamma.

So τ = t / gamma ≈ 163,000.021 / 1960 ≈ let's compute that.

163,000 / 1960 ≈ approx 83.11 years. So again, same result.

But the options don't have 83. So I'm either making a mistake, or perhaps the given options have a typo, but let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) The astronaut will die before reaching Earth.

B) 72 years

C) 81 years

D) 77 years

Wait, 83 is not among them. The closest is option C) 81.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the distance. Wait, perhaps the distance is 70,000 light-years? Wait, no, the LMC is about 163,000 ly away.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the speed is 0.99999987c, which is 0.99999987 times c, so when calculating gamma, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute gamma more precisely.

v = 0.99999987c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² = approximately 0.99999974 c².

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(1 - v²/c²) is sqrt(0.00000026) ≈ 0.0005099.

So gamma = 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1960.08.

So τ = t / gamma = (163000 / (0.99999987)) / 1960.08.

Wait, 163000 / 0.99999987 is about 163000.021, as before.

So 163000.021 / 1960.08 ≈ let me compute that.

163000 ÷ 1960 = let's see.

1960 * 83 = 163,  1960 *80=156,800. 1960*3=5880. So 80+3=83 → 156,800 +5880=162,680. Hmm, 1960 *83= 162,680. But 162,680 is less than 163,000. 163,000 - 162,680=320.

So 320 / 1960 ≈ 0.163. So 83.163.

Wait, approximately 83.16 years.

So the astronaut would experience about 83 years. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but among the options given, option C is 81, which is the closest. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the distance.

Wait another thing: maybe the distance is not 163,000 light-years. For the sake of the problem, perhaps it's closer. Let me think: maybe the distance from LMC to Earth is considered as 80,000 light-years. Wait, no, in reality it's about 160,000-170,000 ly, but perhaps the problem uses a different figure, like 70,000 ly.

If the distance were, say, 70,000 light-years, then:

t = 70,000 / 0.99999987 ≈ 70,000 years.

τ = t / gamma ≈ 70,000 / 1960 ≈ approximately 35.7 years.

But that's not any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the LMC's actual distance but a hypothetical distance that allows the time experienced to be around 70-80 years. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation approach.

Wait, another approach: using the time experienced by the astronaut.

The time experienced would be the proper time, which is calculated as:

τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

Given that, perhaps the problem assumes that the distance is D = v * t_earth.

So for the astronaut, the time is D / (v * gamma), since they are moving and D is the contracted length.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute using the formula:

τ = (distance in Earth frame) / (gamma * v).

Yes, because τ = t_earth * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (D/(v)) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) / v.

So, τ = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) / v.

Let me plug in the numbers.

v = 0.99999987c.

sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = 0.0005099 as before.

So, τ = D * 0.0005099 / 0.99999987.

Since D is in light-years, and v is in terms of c, when we divide by v (in ly/year), the units work out.

So τ = D * (0.0005099 / 0.99999987) ≈ D * 0.0005099.

Wait, because 0.99999987 is approximately 1, so 0.0005099 /0.99999987 ≈ 0.0005099.

So τ ≈ D * 0.0005099 years.

Wait, but D is in light-years, so that would be τ ≈ D * 0.0005099 years.

Wait, that can't be right because 1 light-year at 0.99999987c takes about 1 year. So perhaps my formula is wrong.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should express D as the Earth frame distance (163,000 ly) and compute τ = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) / v.

So τ = (163,000 ly) * (0.0005099) / (0.99999987c).

Wait, the units: (ly) * (dimensionless) / (c) → time in years.

Because ly / (c) is (ly) / (ly/year) ) = years.

So τ = 163,000 * 0.0005099 / 0.99999987.

Compute this:

163,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 163,000 * 0.0005 = 81.5, and 163,000 * 0.0000099≈ ~1.6137. So total ≈ 81.5 + 1.6137 ≈ 83.1137.

Then divide by 0.99999987 ≈ 83.1137 / 0.99999987 ≈ 83.1137 * 1.00000013 ≈ 83.1137 + 0.000108 ≈ 83.1138 years.

Again, about 83 years. So the astronaut would experience 83 years. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but in the options, the closest is C) 81. Or maybe I made a mistake in the distance.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is given as 80,000 light-years, but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, the problem says the LMC, but perhaps the distance is different.

Wait, perhaps I should think of another approach. Let me consider that the average lifetime is 150 solar years. So the astronaut is 22, so they have about 128 years left on Earth's frame. But from their own frame, their lifespan is longer due to time dilation. Wait, no, their own lifespan is 150 years from their perspective. Wait, time dilation works such that moving clocks run slower from the perspective of a stationary observer. So from Earth's frame, the astronaut's lifespan would be shorter. But in this problem, the astronaut's own perspective is what matters. So their own lifespan is 150 years, and the trip takes 83 years from their perspective. So they would survive and reach Earth.

But the question is about how long the trip takes from their perspective, not whether they die. So the options are about the trip duration, not their lifespan.

But the options say, if it's 83 years, and the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake. Or perhaps the distance is different.

Wait, maybe the distance is 80,000 light-years. Let me try that.

τ = 80,000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 40.79 years. So that's 40 years, but that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.99999987c, but when I compute gamma, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, let me compute gamma accurately.

v = 0.99999987c.

v² = (0.99999987)^2 c² = (0.99999987 * 0.99999987) c².

Calculating 0.99999987 * 0.99999987:

Let me compute it as (1 - 0.00000013) * (1 - 0.00000013) = 1 - 2*0.00000013 + (0.00000013)^2 ≈ 1 - 0.00000026 + 1.69e-13 ≈ 0.99999974.

So 1 - v²/c² = 1 - 0.99999974 = 0.00000026.

So sqrt(0.00000026) is approximately 0.0005099.

Thus, gamma is 1 / 0.0005099 ≈ 1960.08.

So, for a distance D in Earth's frame, time from Earth is t = D / v.

Proper time τ = t * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) = (D/(v)) * sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So τ = D * sqrt(1 - v²/c²) / v.

If D is 163,000 ly:

tau = 163000 * 0.0005099 / 0.99999987.

So 163000 * 0.0005099 ≈ 83.1137.

Divide by 0.99999987: ~83.1137 years.

So again, 83 years.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps the intended answer is option A, because 83 years is longer than the astronaut's remaining lifespan of 128 years (150 -22=128). Wait, no, because 83 is less than 128. So the astronaut would live to reach Earth.

Wait, but the options don't include 83. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A) The astronaut will die before reaching to the Earth.

B) 72 years

C) 81 years

D) 77 years

Wait, 83 is not an option, so perhaps the correct answer is not present, but the closest is C) 81.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is A, but that doesn't make sense because 83 years is less than the astronaut's lifespan.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the distance is much less. Let me think, what if the distance were 77 light-years? Then τ = 77 * 0.0005099 ≈ 0.0393 years, which is about 14 days. That doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should look for an alternative approach. Maybe using the formula for time experienced in terms of velocity.

Wait, another formula I remember is that the time experienced by the traveler (proper time) is tau = D * sqrt(1 - v^2) / v.

Wait, but D is in the Earth's frame, so D is 163,000 ly, v is 0.99999987c.

So tau = 163000 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) / (0.99999987) * (ly/ (c)).

Wait, sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) is 0.0005099.

So tau = 163000 * 0.0005099 / 0.99999987.

Again, 163000 * 0.0005099 = 83.1137.

Divided by 0.99999987 is ~83.1137 → same as before.

Hmm. So perhaps the intended answer is C) 81 years, but it's not matching my calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the speed is 0.9999c, making the calculation easier.

Wait, let me try that. Suppose the speed were 0.9999c.

v=0.9999c.

v²/c²=0.99980001.

1 - v²/c²= 0.00019999.

sqrt(0.00019999)= approx 0.014142.

Gamma =1/0.014142≈70.71.

Time from Earth frame: t=163000 /0.9999≈163,000*1.0001=163,163 years.

Proper time tau= t * sqrt(1 - v^2/c^2) =163163 *0.014142≈ approx 2307 years. No, that can't be. Hmm, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, if speed is 0.9999c, then from Earth's frame, the time is about 163,000/0.9999≈163,016 years. Then tau=163,016 * sqrt(1 - (0.9999)^2) = 163,016 * 0.014142 ≈ 2307 years. That's way longer than the astronaut's lifespan, so they would die.

But the original problem's speed is 0.99999987c, which is much faster, so the time would be much shorter, making the astronaut's experienced time about 83 years.

But again, the options don't have 83.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the Earth as the destination is the same galaxy, but perhaps the distance is only a few thousand light-years. But that doesn't fit the LMC's position.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a simpler calculation without considering length contraction and just using time dilation.

In that case, the time from Earth's perspective is t= D /v.

Proper time tau= t * sqrt(1 -v^2/c^2).

If D is 163,000 ly, v=0.99999987c.

t=163,000 /0.99999987 ≈163,000.021 years.

tau=163,000.021 * sqrt(1 - (0.99999987)^2) =163,000.021 * 0.0005099≈83.113 years.

Again, same result.

So given that none of the options match, perhaps the intended answer is that the astronaut will survive, but the time is approximately 83 years, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct choice is A, but that would imply the time is more than 150-22=128 years, which it's not.

Wait, the astronaut is 22 years old, and their average lifetime is 150 years. So they have 128 years left. If the trip takes 83 years from their perspective, they would live to reach Earth. So option A is incorrect.

Looking back at the options:

A) Astronaut will die before reaching Earth.

But with 83 years, they would live. So A is incorrect.

So the correct answer must be the age they are when they arrive: 22 +83=105, which is within 150. So they survive. But the question is about how long the trip takes, which is 83 years. Since none of the options match, perhaps there's a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the Lorentz factor in a different way. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should compute the gamma and then find tau.

Gamma is approximately 1960.

Time from Earth's perspective is t = 163,000 / 0.99999987 ≈163,000 years.

Tau = t / gamma = 163,000 / 1960 ≈83.11 years.

Yes, same result.

Hmm. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is 83 years, but it's not an option. So perhaps the closest is C)81 years.

Alternatively, perhaps the distance is given as 80,000 ly. Let's see.

If D=80,000 ly, then tau=80,000 *0.0005099 /0.99999987 ≈40.79 years.

Nope, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the speed is 0.99999987c, but the calculation is done with a rough approximation of v as 0.9999c.

Wait, let me compute with v=0.9999c.

Then 1 - v^2/c^2= 1 - (0.9999)^2 =1-0.99980001=0.00019999.

sqrt(0.00019999)=0.014142.

Gamma=1/0.014142=70.71.

Tau= D * sqrt(1 -v^2/c^2) /v.

For D=163,000 ly:

tau=163000 * 0.014142 /0.9999 ≈163000 *0.014142 ≈2,307 years.

Then divided by 0.9999 is ~2307. So tau= approx 2307 years. Which is way longer than 150 years, so the astronaut would die. So that would choose option A.

But the original problem's speed is 0.99999987c, which is much higher than 0.9999c, leading to a much shorter tau.

But perhaps the problem intended to use a different speed, leading to option A.

But given that, perhaps the intended answer is option A because the time taken is too long, but that's only if the speed were lower.

Wait, but in our problem, the speed is very high, so the time is only 83 years, which is acceptable.

But since the options don't include 83, perhaps the correct answer is C)81 years. Maybe the problem expects a rounded figure.

But I'm stuck. Since I can't see any error in my calculations, I think the correct answer is approximately 83 years, but since that's not an option, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the intended answer is option D)77 years.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation for gamma.

Wait, v=0.99999987c.

Let me compute (1 -v²/c²) accurately.

(0.99999987)^2 = (1 - 0.00000013)^2 =1 - 2*(0.00000013) + (0.00000013)^2 ≈1 - 0.00000026 + negligible.

So 1 - v²/c^2=0.00000026.

sqrt(0.00000026)=sqrt(2.6e-7)=5.099e-4.

So gamma=1/5.099e-4≈1960.08.

So tau= t_earth * sqrt(1 -v^2/c^2) = (163000 / 0.99999987) *5.099e-4.

163000 / 0.99999987=163,000.021.

Multiply by 5.099e-4:

163000.021 * 0.0005099= approx 83.11.

Hmm, I think I'm stuck, but I'll proceed to choose the closest option, which is C)81 years. But I'm not confident.


To determine how long the astronaut's journey will take from their perspective, we analyze the problem using the principles of special relativity, specifically time dilation and length contraction.

### Key Information:
1. **Distance to Earth**: The Large Magellanic Cloud is approximately 163,000 light-years away from Earth.
2. **Spacecraft Speed**: \( v = 0.99999987c \), where \( c \) is the speed of light.
3. **Astronaut's Perspective**: The time experienced by the astronaut is the proper time (\( \tau \)), which is shorter than the time measured in Earth's frame (\( t \)) due to time dilation.

### Time Dilation Formula:
The proper time experienced by the astronaut is given by:
\[
\tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]
where \( t \) is the time measured in Earth's frame.

### Step 1: Calculate Time in Earth's Frame (\( t \))
The time taken for the journey in Earth's frame is:
\[
t = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{163,000 \, \text{ly}}{0.99999987c}
\]
Since \( 1 \, \text{ly} / c = 1 \, \text{year} \), this simplifies to:
\[
t \approx 163,000 / 0.99999987 \approx 163,000.021 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Proper Time (\( \tau \))
The time dilation factor is:
\[
\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \sqrt{1 - (0.99999987)^2} = \sqrt{0.00000026} \approx 0.0005099.
\]
Thus, the proper time is:
\[
\tau = t \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = 163,000.021 \cdot 0.0005099 \approx 83.11 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 3: Analyze the Options
The astronaut's lifespan is 150 years, and they are currently 22 years old. From their perspective, the journey takes approximately **83 years**, which is less than their remaining lifespan (150 - 22 = 128 years). Therefore, the astronaut will survive the trip.

The calculated proper time (\( \tau \approx 83 \, \text{years} \)) does not match any of the provided options exactly. However, the closest option is **C) 81 years**. Given the approximations and potential rounding in the problem, this is the most reasonable choice.

### Conclusion:
The astronaut will experience approximately 83 years during the journey, but since this value is not listed, the closest option is **C) 81 years**.
