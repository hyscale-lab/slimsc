Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I need to figure out the ratio between two energy bands after the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, mainly the proton-proton (pp) chain. There are different branches in this chain. The pp-I branch is the main one, producing helium-4, and then there's the pp-II and pp-III branches, which I think are less dominant. Wait, the question specifically mentions the pp-III branch stopping, so I should focus on that.

The pp-III branch, if I recall correctly, involves heavier nuclei. Like, maybe carbon-12 or something. Oh wait, I think the pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos because it involves higher energy reactions. So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of those high-energy neutrinos would suddenly drop.

Now, the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The ratio is flux(band1)/flux(band2). So I need to figure out how the stopping of the pp-III branch affects these bands.

I remember that the dominant source of solar neutrinos in the higher energy ranges (like above 500 keV) comes from the decay of beryllium-7, which is part of the pp-I branch. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos via the reaction where boron-8 decays into carbon-8, which then emits a neutrino. Those are the high-energy neutrinos, right? So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of those high-energy neutrinos would cease.

But in the question, the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, which is the approximate time it takes for neutrinos to reach Earth. So we're seeing the effects now. So the neutrinos we're detecting now are from before the pp-III stopped.

Wait, no, wait. Neutrinos are produced in the core, which is the center of the Sun. The pp-III branch is part of the main pp chain, so if it stops, then the production of certain neutrinos would stop. But the neutrinos already in the Sun's interior would still be traveling out. But since neutrinos escape almost as soon as they're produced, the stopping of pp-III would affect the current flux.

Wait, neutrinos are produced in the core and take about 8 minutes to reach Earth. So if the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos produced in that time would have already left the Sun towards Earth. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the neutrinos are produced in the core, which is about 1/3 of the Sun's radius from the surface. The Sun's radius is about 700,000 km, and light takes about 8 minutes to travel from the core to Earth.

So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos produced in the last 0.5 minutes (30 seconds) would still be inside the Sun. So the neutrinos that were produced before 8.5 minutes ago have already left. So the flux that we are currently detecting would be from the time before the pp-III stopped, except for the last 0.5 minutes worth of neutrinos, which haven't reached us yet. But since neutrinos are being produced continuously, the sudden stop would cause a decrease in the flux of neutrinos from the pp-III branch.

Wait, but the question says that all other reactions remain as they were. So only the pp-III branch has been stopped. So the production of neutrinos from the pp-III process stops.

So, neutrinos from the pp-III branch would no longer be produced. So what's the main source of neutrinos in each energy band?

I think the dominant solar neutrinos come from the pp-I branch, which produces Be-7, which then decays into 7Li and emits a neutrino. The energy of these neutrinos is around 420 keV. But wait, the bands are above 700 keV. So the other main source is from the pp-III branch.

Wait, the pp-III branch involves the reaction where 3He captures a proton to form 4He, but that's not right. Wait, no, the pp-III is actually the branch where two protons combine with a carbon-12 nucleus, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the neutrino production. The main sources are:

1. The dominant is the pp-I branch, producing Be-7, which decays into 7Li and emits neutrinos (around 420 keV). These are the majority of the solar neutrinos.

2. The pp-II branch produces neutrinos from 13C (lithium burning) and 15O (carbon burning), but these have lower energies.

3. The pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, like from the decay of 17F, which emits a neutrino around 862 keV. These are the high-energy ones, in the ~800 keV range. So the pp-III neutrinos are the ones in higher energy bands.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the high-energy neutrinos (like in the 800-900 keV range) would no longer be produced. Because the question is about the flux ratio between 700-800 and 800-900 keV.

Wait, but wait. If pp-III produces neutrinos in the 800 keV range, stopping it would mean that the 800-900 keV band (band 2) would have a lot less neutrinos. The 700-800 keV band is lower. Are there other sources of neutrinos in that band?

Wait, maybe the Be-7 neutrinos are around 420 keV, so they're below 700 keV. Then, what about the other sources? There's also the decay of 13C, which produces neutrinos around 1.4 MeV, but that's higher. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, 13C neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV (which is 1400 keV), which is higher than both bands. So that's band 2 (800-900) and above. So if the pp-III neutrinos are the ones around 862 keV, which are in band 2.

But the 700-800 keV band (band1) might be from other sources. Wait, the 8B neutrinos are the ones from the pp-III branch, which are high energy. So if pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos would stop, so band2 would have almost no neutrinos. But band1 is lower, so maybe it's from the pp-I branch, but their neutrinos are lower in energy.

Wait, but the Be-7 neutrinos are around 420 keV, so they don't contribute to band1 (700-800). So what's the source for 700-800 keV?

Hmm, maybe I'm forgetting other processes. Oh wait, maybe the 7Be neutrinos have a lower energy, but there are other neutrinos from higher processes. Or maybe the 13C neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV, which is too high. So perhaps the 700-800 keV band is from the 17F decay, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the main neutrino emission energies. Oh, but I can't access the internet, so I have to rely on memory.

The main neutrino sources:

- The dominant ones are the Be-7 neutrinos at ~420 keV.

- The 8B (pp-III) neutrinos are at ~862 keV, which are in the higher energy range.

- The 13C neutrinos are at ~1.41 MeV.

- The 15O neutrinos are at ~6.4 MeV.

So, the 700-800 keV band would be between the Be-7 (420 keV) and 8B (862 keV) neutrinos. So perhaps there are other neutrinos in that range.

Wait, are there any neutrinos from the 7Be decay? No, because 7Be decays into 7Li via capturing a neutrino, but that's the same as the Be-7 neutrino, which is at 420 keV.

Alternatively, maybe the 8B neutrinos are the main source in the higher bands. So, band1 (700-800) would have fewer neutrinos, perhaps none, except from the 8B? But wait, 8B neutrinos are at 862 keV, so they would fall into band2 (800-900 keV). So if the pp-III branch stops, the 8B neutrinos would stop, so band2 would have almost no neutrinos.

But band1 is 700-800 keV; what produces neutrinos there? Maybe the 13N or something else?

Wait, another thought: The pp-III branch produces the 8B neutrinos, which are in band2. So if the pp-III stops, band2 will have a much lower flux. But band1 is 700-800, so perhaps it's from another source.

Wait, are there any other neutrino sources in that range? Maybe the 17F decay? I think 17F decay emits a neutrino around 850 keV or so, which would fall into band2 (800-900). Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 700-800 keV band is from the same sources but at lower energies. Wait, but 7Be is 420, 8B is 862. So, maybe there's a continuum from other processes, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the neutrinos from the 7Be are a continuous spectrum, but I don't think so. I think each decay has a specific energy.

Wait, alternatively, the 8B neutrinos have a higher energy, so their flux is in band2. So if pp-III stops, their production stops, so band2 flux drops. Band1 (700-800) would not be affected, unless there's another source.

Wait, but the question says that all other reactions remain as they were. So if the pp-III branch is stopped, only the neutrinos from that branch are affected.

So, if band2 is dominated by the 8B neutrinos, and band1 is dominated by other sources (maybe the same 8B, but lower energy?), but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, no. The 8B neutrinos are mono-energetic at about 862 keV, so they're all in band2. So if the pp-III stops, the flux in band2 would drop to almost zero, but band1, which is 700-800, would have its original flux unaffected (assuming band1 has no 8B neutrinos). But what is band1's source?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Are there any other neutrinos between 700 and 800 keV? Let me think about other isotopes.

The 13C neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV, which is higher than band2. The 15O neutrinos are way higher, so that's not relevant. The 7Be is 420 keV. So the only neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range would be from other processes. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the neutrinos from the decay of 17F are in that range. I think 17F has a decay that emits a neutrino around 850 keV, which is in band2. So that would fall into band2.

So then, what is contributing to band1 (700-800)? Maybe another process. Alternatively, perhaps I'm incorrect about the energy of the 8B neutrinos.

Wait, I might have been wrong. Let me think again. The 8B neutrinos are from the decay of 8B, which is created in the pp-III branch. The decay emits a neutrino with energy around 862 keV, right? So that's in band2.

But then, what about the 7Be neutrinos? They're at 420 keV, so they're in a lower energy band.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch is stopped, then the 8B neutrinos would stop, so their contribution to band2 would drop, making the flux in band2 much lower. But what about band1? If band1 doesn't have any neutrinos from pp-III, then its flux remains the same.

Wait, but I'm not sure what contributes to band1. If the only neutrinos in band1 are from the main pp-I branch, but those are at 420 keV, which is lower than 700. So maybe there's no neutrino flux in band1 except from pp-III, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the neutrino energies wrong. Let me try to reconstruct:

- 7Be decay: ~420 keV (pp-I).

- 8B decay: ~862 keV (pp-III).

- 13C decay: ~1.4 MeV (pp-II or another branch?).

So, if pp-III stops, the 862 keV neutrinos stop. So band2 (800-900) would have a big drop in flux, but band1 (700-800) would have the same flux as before, because it's not affected by pp-III.

Wait, but if pp-III contributes nothing to band1, then band1's flux is from other sources. But I'm not aware of other sources in that range. So perhaps band1 has a negligible flux, but that can't be right because the question states that the flux is very large.

Hmm, perhaps the pp-III branch produces a continuous spectrum of neutrinos, not just mono-energetic. So some of them fall into band1 and others into band2.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because in reality, neutrinos from a nuclear process can have a range of energies. So perhaps the pp-III branch produces neutrinos with a distribution spanning from lower to higher energies, such that some fall into band1 and others into band2.

In that case, if the pp-III branch stops, both band1 and band2 would lose some of their flux, but I'd have to figure out the ratio.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of band1 to band2. So, if both bands are affected because they both have contributions from the pp-III branch, but perhaps band2 has a higher proportion of pp-III neutrinos.

Alternatively, perhaps each band's flux is dominated by different sources. For example, band1 is from pp-I and pp-III, while band2 is mostly from pp-III.

Wait, but pp-I produces 7Be neutrinos at 420 keV, which is below 700, so they don't contribute to band1. So band1 must be from pp-III, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are all in band2, and the neutrinos in band1 come from another process.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this differently.

If the pp-III branch stopped, the production of high-energy neutrinos (like 862 keV) would stop. So the neutrinos in band2 (800-900) would come from elsewhere, but I think the main source is the pp-III. So without that, band2's flux drops significantly.

Band1 (700-800) would not be affected as much if it's from another source. But if the pp-III neutrinos are the only ones in band2, but also have some in band1, then both would decrease, but perhaps band2 is more affected.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of band1 to band2 after the pp-III stops.

If band1's flux is F1 and band2's is F2, before the stop:

F1 = F_ppIII_band1 + F_other_band1

F2 = F_ppIII_band2 + F_other_band2

But if the pp-III stops, then F_ppIII_band1 and F_ppIII_band2 become zero. So new F1 = F_other_band1, F2 = F_other_band2.

But if F_other_band1 is from another source, like maybe pp-I or pp-II, but those don't produce in that energy range. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 700-800 keV band is from the 13C neutrinos? No, 13C is at ~1.4 MeV, which is higher than band2.

Alternatively, the 17F decay, which I think is part of the pp-III branch, emits neutrino around 850 keV, so that's in band2. So the 700-800 could be from a different isotope. Maybe the 15O neutrinos? No, those are way higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the isotopes. Let me think again.

The pp-III branch: Proton captures on carbon-12. The reaction is C-12 + p → N-13, which then beta decays to C-13 and emits a neutrino. Wait, no, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, in the pp-III branch, the main reaction is 3He + 4He → 7Be, which then captures another proton to form 8B, which decays into 8Li and emits a neutrino at 862 keV. So that's the 8B neutrino, which is in band2.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the 8B neutrino flux (band2) stops. But band1 (700-800) would have to come from another process. But in reality, are there other neutrinos in that range?

I think the 7Be neutrinos are at 420 keV, so they don't contribute. The 8B are at 862. So band1 (700-800) might have a negligible contribution from the 8B neutrinos, but wait, 862 is near 800-900, so maybe the 8B neutrinos are all in band2.

Wait, but 862 is within 800-900, so band2. So if the pp-III stops, the flux in band2 would drop, but flux in band1 would remain the same, because band1 isn't affected by pp-III.

But the question states that the flux is very large and dominated by the Sun. So band1 must have a lot of neutrinos. Wait, but the only other source I can think of is if the pp-III neutrinos have a spectrum that includes some in band1. But earlier I thought they are mono-energetic. Maybe in reality, the neutrinos are emitted with a range of energies, but the peak is around 862 keV.

Wait, if the 8B neutrinos have a spectrum that extends into band1, then stopping the pp-III would reduce both band1 and band2, but perhaps band2 has a higher proportion of pp-III neutrinos.

So, the ratio would change. Let's think about it: if band1 was contributing X% from pp-III and band2 Y%, and both X and Y are significant.

If the pp-III stops, band1's flux would drop to (1 - X), and band2 to (1 - Y), where 1 is the original 100% contribution from other sources. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the majority of the pp-III neutrinos are in band2, so their contribution to band1 is small. So when the pp-III stops, band2's flux drops a lot, but band1's remains almost the same.

So the ratio F1/F2 would be (F1_original) / (F2_original - delta_F2).

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think in terms of the energy distribution of the pp-III neutrinos. If they have a peak at 862 keV and a tail towards lower energies, then perhaps a significant fraction of them are in band2, but some are in band1.

But I'm not sure about the exact distribution. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are all in band2, and band1 is from another source, which I'm missing. But if that's the case, then F1 remains the same, and F2 drops to zero (assuming all pp-III neutrinos are in band2).

In that case, the ratio F1/F2 would be (F1) / (F2). If F2 was previously a significant part of the total, then F1/F2 would be large. But if F2 was the same as F1, then the ratio would be 1.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio after the pp-III stops. So if F1 is from other sources and F2 is now only from whatever was there before, which is perhaps negligible.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III neutrinos are the only source of high-energy neutrinos. So the flux in band2 is almost entirely from pp-III. Band1 is from a different source, but perhaps the pp-III also contributes a small part to band1.

Wait, but if the pp-III neutrinos are all in band2, then F1 would remain the same, and F2 would drop to zero. So (F1)/(F2) would be very large, tending to infinity, but that's not an option. The options are 1, 0.1, 0.01, or 10.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos have some in band1. So let's say both bands are affected. Suppose 50% of pp-III neutrinos are in band1 and 50% in band2. Then, after pp-III stops, F1 would be F1_other, and F2 would be F2_other. But I don't know the F_other.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the only source in band2, and band1 has a small contribution from pp-III as well.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos contribute more to band2 than band1. So, if the pp-III stops, F2 drops more.

So, the original flux in band2 is F_ppIII_band2 + F_other_band2. If F_other_band2 is negligible, then F2_new = F_other_band2 ≈ 0. Similarly, band1's flux is F_ppIII_band1 + F_other_band1. If F_ppIII_band1 is small compared to F_other_band1, then F1 remains almost the same.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the majority of the neutrinos in band2 come from pp-III, but band1 comes from another process. Let me think about the relative fluxes.

In the Sun, the dominant neutrinos are the 7Be (pp-I), but the pp-III branch produces a much smaller flux of higher energy neutrinos. So, the 8B neutrinos are a small fraction of the total solar neutrinos.

But the question is about the ratio between two specific bands, not the total flux.

Wait, perhaps the neutrinos in band1 (700-800) are from the same source as band2, but at lower energies. So if the pp-III stops, both bands would lose their contribution.

But if the pp-III neutrinos are all in band2, then band1 remains unaffected. So F1 remains the same, F2 drops to zero, so ratio is infinity. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps only a small fraction of pp-III neutrinos fall into band1, so their contribution is minimal.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing high-energy neutrinos, around 862 keV. So band2 (800-900) is where these neutrinos fall. The pp-III neutrinos are a small fraction of the total solar neutrino flux.

If the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band2 would decrease significantly because the main source (pp-III) is gone. But band1 (700-800) is below the main pp-III neutrino energy, so it's unaffected. Wait, but 862 is just above 800, so perhaps some of the pp-III neutrinos have lower energies and contribute to band1.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos have a continuous energy distribution, with some falling into band1 and others into band2.

In that case, the higher energy neutrinos (band2) would be more affected than band1. So the ratio of F1 to F2 would depend on how much the pp-III neutrinos contributed to each band.

If the pp-III neutrinos have a peak in band2 and a tail extending into band1, then the majority of their contribution is in band2. So when the pp-III stops, band2's flux would drop more than band1's.

So, suppose the pp-III neutrinos contributed 90% of band2's flux and 10% of band1's flux. After the pp-III stops, band2 flux drops to 10% of its original, and band1 drops to 90%.

Assuming that before stopping, the fluxes were F1 = F_ppIII_1 + F_other_1 and F2 = F_ppIII_2 + F_other_2.

If F_other_1 is zero (no other sources for band1), then after stopping, F1 = F_ppIII_1 and F2 = F_other_2.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the other sources are negligible, or only pp-III contributes to both bands.

I think I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of band1 to band2. The options are 10, 0.01, 1, or 0.1.

If pp-III is the main source of high-energy neutrinos, which fall into band2, then stopping it would reduce F2 a lot. If F1 is from another source unaffected by pp-III, then F1 remains the same, and F2 drops.

So the ratio F1/F2 would increase. For example, if originally F1 was 10 times F2, then after F2 drops to zero, the ratio would be infinity, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps both bands are affected similarly, such that the ratio remains about the same. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the main contributor to both bands, but band2 is more affected. So the ratio F1/F2 would increase if F2 drops more.

Another thought: neutrino flux is proportional to the square of the energy or something else? No, flux is number per cm^2 per second, so it's a count rate. The energy distribution matters for which band they fall into.

I think the key point is that the pp-III neutrinos are in band2, and band1 is either unaffected or has a different source.

If pp-III is the only source for band2, then F2 drops to zero. If F1 comes from another source, then the ratio F1/F2 would be very large, but the options don't have that.

Wait, but the question says "flux between two bands of neutrino energies", so perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the only ones in both bands. So without pp-III, both bands' fluxes drop.

Assuming that the pp-III neutrinos have a spectrum where some are in band1 and some in band2. Let's say that the majority are in band2. So when pp-III stops, the flux in band2 drops more than band1.

Suppose band1's flux is 10% from pp-III and 90% from elsewhere, and band2's flux is 90% from pp-III and 10% elsewhere.

After the pp-III stops, band1's flux would be 90% of original, and band2's would be 10% of original.

So the ratio would be 90% / 10% = 9, which is close to option A (10), but not exactly. But this is a rough estimate.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos contribute more to band2 than band1, leading to a higher ratio.

Wait, but without knowing the exact distribution, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is around 1, meaning that the flux in both bands was mainly from pp-III, so stopping it makes both drop by a similar factor.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: think about the energy of the neutrinos. The 8B neutrinos are at 862 keV, so they're in band2. So band1 (700-800) must come from another source.

Wait, but I don't know another source in that range. So perhaps before the pp-III stopped, band1's flux was negligible? That doesn't make sense because the question states that the flux is very large.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7Be neutrinos have a low-energy tail. But 7Be is at 420 keV, so it's below band1.

So, perhaps the only neutrinos in band2 are from pp-III, and band1 is from another process that's unaffected.

In that case, after pp-III stops, F2 becomes zero, and F1 remains the same. So the ratio is F1 / 0 → infinity. But the options don't have that, so perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the 700-800 keV band is from the same pp-III process, but in a lower energy part of the spectrum. So if the pp-III stops, both bands drop.

But in reality, the 8B neutrinos are mono-energetic. So if the pp-III stops, the 862 keV neutrinos stop. So band2 (800-900) would have almost no neutrinos, as 862 is the main one.

Band1 (700-800) would have no contribution from pp-III, so it remains as it was.

So, if F1 is from another source and F2 was mainly from pp-III, the ratio F1/F2 would be very high. But in the options, the highest is 10 (option A).

Wait, but if F2 was originally 10% from pp-III and 90% from elsewhere, and F1 is entirely from elsewhere, then after pp-III stops, F2 would drop to 90%, and F1 remains the same. So the ratio would be F1/(0.9 F2_original) = (F1_original)/(0.9 F2_original). But without knowing the original ratio, I can't compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps in reality, the pp-III neutrinos are the only ones in band2, and F1 comes from another source. So the ratio would be F1/F2 = (F1)/(F2_ppIII). If F1 is unrelated, perhaps F1 is about equal to F2_ppIII. So the ratio would be 1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that without the pp-III, the high-energy neutrinos (band2) are gone. So the ratio of band1 to band2 would be large.

But the options suggest that the ratio is either 10, 0.01, 1, or 0.1.

Wait, another approach: when the pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos stop. So the 800-900 keV band would have almost no neutrinos. The 700-800 band may have some neutrinos from the same source, but if the pp-III stopped, they would also stop.

But wait, the 8B neutrinos are at 862, which is in band2. So the neutrinos in band1 (700-800) would not be affected by the stopping of pp-III.

Wait, no. Because if pp-III is stopped, the neutrinos from that branch stop. So the 862 keV neutrinos stop, but what about the 700-800? Those would be from other processes.

Wait, but the question says that all other reactions remain as they were. So if the pp-III stops, other processes continue. So the neutrinos from other branches (like pp-I) continue.

Wait, but the neutrinos from pp-I are at 420 keV, so they don't contribute to band1. The question is, what contributes to band1?

Hmm... Perhaps the 700-800 keV band is from the decay of another isotope, like 17F, which is part of the pp-III branch. If that's the case, then when pp-III stops, both bands (700-800 and 800-900) would lose their contributions.

But I think 17F's decay is at around 850 keV, which is in band2.

So, perhaps band1's neutrinos are from another source, like the 13C neutrinos, but those are higher.

Wait, I'm getting really stuck here. Let me try to make an educated guess.

The pp-III branch produces the 862 keV neutrinos (band2), and perhaps a small number of lower-energy neutrinos that fall into band1. So when pp-III stops, both bands' fluxes decrease, but band2's drops more.

Assuming that the majority of the neutrinos in band2 come from pp-III, and only a small fraction in band1, the ratio F1/F2 would be larger than 1.

Looking at the options, option A is 10, which suggests that band1's flux is ten times band2's. That's possible if band1 is from another source and band2 is mainly from pp-III.

Alternatively, perhaps the 700-800 band is from the same source as the 800-900 band, and their ratio is 1. But that's option C.

Hmm. Another thought: since the pp-III neutrinos are mono-energetic at 862 keV, which is in band2, the flux in band2 is dominated by this. The 700-800 band must be from another source, which isn't affected, so the flux there remains the same. So the ratio F1/F2 would be (flux_band1) / (flux_band2 without pp-III).

If band2's flux was dominated by pp-III, then without it, flux_band2 would drop to a small fraction. So F1/F2 would be a large number.

But if the original flux_band2 was much larger than flux_band1, then after pp-III stops, F2 becomes negligible, making the ratio very large. But none of the options are that high except A (10).

Alternatively, perhaps the original ratio was 1, and after pp-III stops, band2 drops to 0.1 times its original, making the ratio 10.

But I'm not sure. Given all this, I think the correct answer is that the ratio is around 10, so option A.

The question involves determining the ratio of neutrino flux between two energy bands, 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2), after the pp-III branch in the Sun's core hypothetically stops. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing high-energy neutrinos, particularly the 862 keV neutrinos from the decay of 8B, which fall into band 2. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Neutrino Sources and Energy Bands**:  
   - The dominant solar neutrinos come from the pp-I branch, producing 420 keV neutrinos from 7Be decay, which are below band 1.  
   - The pp-III branch produces 862 keV neutrinos from 8B decay, which fall into band 2.  
   - Band 1 (700-800 keV) does not have a significant contribution from the pp-III branch, as the 862 keV neutrinos are entirely in band 2.  

2. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:  
   - The pp-III branch is the primary source of neutrinos in band 2. If it stops, the flux in band 2 will drop significantly or potentially to zero, as the 862 keV neutrinos are the main contributors.  
   - Band 1 (700-800 keV) is unaffected by the pp-III branch, as its neutrinos are not produced in this energy range.  

3. **Flux Ratio Analysis**:  
   - Before the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 2 is dominated by the 862 keV neutrinos.  
   - After the pp-III branch stops, band 2's flux decreases significantly, while band 1's flux remains largely unchanged.  
   - The ratio of flux between band 1 and band 2, **flux(band 1)/flux(band 2)**, increases because band 2's flux drops more than band 1's.  

4. **Options and Conclusion**:  
   - The options provided are 10, 0.01, 1, and 0.1.  
   - Given that band 2's flux is heavily dependent on the pp-III branch, and band 1's flux remains largely unaffected, the ratio is expected to increase.  
   - Among the options, 10 (option A) is the most reasonable estimate for the ratio, as it reflects the significant drop in band 2's flux compared to band 1.

ANSWER: A

Okay, so I've got this question about neutrino flux from the Sun, and I need to figure out the ratio between two energy bands after the pp-III branch stops. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my solar neutrino physics, but let me try to think this through.

First, I remember that the Sun's energy production involves several processes, mainly the proton-proton (pp) chain. There are different branches in this chain. The pp-I branch is the main one, producing helium-4, and then there's the pp-II and pp-III branches, which I think are less dominant. Wait, the question specifically mentions the pp-III branch stopping, so I should focus on that.

The pp-III branch, if I recall correctly, involves heavier nuclei. Like, maybe carbon-12 or something. Oh wait, I think the pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos because it involves higher energy reactions. So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of those high-energy neutrinos would suddenly drop.

Now, the question is about the flux of neutrinos in two energy bands: 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2). The ratio is flux(band1)/flux(band2). So I need to figure out how the stopping of the pp-III branch affects these bands.

I remember that the dominant source of solar neutrinos in the higher energy ranges (like above 500 keV) comes from the decay of beryllium-7, which is part of the pp-I branch. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, the pp-III branch produces neutrinos via the reaction where boron-8 decays into carbon-8, which then emits a neutrino. Those are the high-energy neutrinos, right? So if the pp-III branch stops, the production of those high-energy neutrinos would cease.

But in the question, the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, which is the approximate time it takes for neutrinos to reach Earth. So we're seeing the effects now. So the neutrinos we're detecting now are from before the pp-III stopped.

Wait, no, wait. Neutrinos are produced in the core, which is the center of the Sun. The pp-III branch is part of the main pp chain, so if it stops, then the production of certain neutrinos would stop. But the neutrinos already in the Sun's interior would still be traveling out. But since neutrinos escape almost as soon as they're produced, the stopping of pp-III would affect the current flux.

Wait, neutrinos are produced in the core and take about 8 minutes to reach Earth. So if the pp-III branch stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos produced in that time would have already left the Sun towards Earth. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the neutrinos are produced in the core, which is about 1/3 of the Sun's radius from the surface. The Sun's radius is about 700,000 km, and light takes about 8 minutes to travel from the core to Earth.

So if the pp-III stopped 8.5 minutes ago, the neutrinos produced in the last 0.5 minutes (30 seconds) would still be inside the Sun. So the neutrinos that were produced before 8.5 minutes ago have already left. So the flux that we are currently detecting would be from the time before the pp-III stopped, except for the last 0.5 minutes worth of neutrinos, which haven't reached us yet. But since neutrinos are being produced continuously, the sudden stop would cause a decrease in the flux of neutrinos from the pp-III branch.

Wait, but the question says that all other reactions remain as they were. So only the pp-III branch has been stopped. So the production of neutrinos from the pp-III process stops.

So, neutrinos from the pp-III branch would no longer be produced. So what's the main source of neutrinos in each energy band?

I think the dominant solar neutrinos come from the pp-I branch, which produces Be-7, which then decays into 7Li and emits a neutrino. The energy of these neutrinos is around 420 keV. But wait, the bands are above 700 keV. So the other main source is from the pp-III branch.

Wait, the pp-III branch involves the reaction where 3He captures a proton to form 4He, but that's not right. Wait, no, the pp-III is actually the branch where two protons combine with a carbon-12 nucleus, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the neutrino production. The main sources are:

1. The dominant is the pp-I branch, producing Be-7, which decays into 7Li and emits neutrinos (around 420 keV). These are the majority of the solar neutrinos.

2. The pp-II branch produces neutrinos from 13C (lithium burning) and 15O (carbon burning), but these have lower energies.

3. The pp-III branch produces high-energy neutrinos, like from the decay of 17F, which emits a neutrino around 862 keV. These are the high-energy ones, in the ~800 keV range. So the pp-III neutrinos are the ones in higher energy bands.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the high-energy neutrinos (like in the 800-900 keV range) would no longer be produced. Because the question is about the flux ratio between 700-800 and 800-900 keV.

Wait, but wait. If pp-III produces neutrinos in the 800 keV range, stopping it would mean that the 800-900 keV band (band 2) would have a lot less neutrinos. The 700-800 keV band is lower. Are there other sources of neutrinos in that band?

Wait, maybe the Be-7 neutrinos are around 420 keV, so they're below 700 keV. Then, what about the other sources? There's also the decay of 13C, which produces neutrinos around 1.4 MeV, but that's higher. Wait, no, I'm getting a bit mixed up.

Wait, 13C neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV (which is 1400 keV), which is higher than both bands. So that's band 2 (800-900) and above. So if the pp-III neutrinos are the ones around 862 keV, which are in band 2.

But the 700-800 keV band (band1) might be from other sources. Wait, the 8B neutrinos are the ones from the pp-III branch, which are high energy. So if pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos would stop, so band2 would have almost no neutrinos. But band1 is lower, so maybe it's from the pp-I branch, but their neutrinos are lower in energy.

Wait, but the Be-7 neutrinos are around 420 keV, so they don't contribute to band1 (700-800). So what's the source for 700-800 keV?

Hmm, maybe I'm forgetting other processes. Oh wait, maybe the 7Be neutrinos have a lower energy, but there are other neutrinos from higher processes. Or maybe the 13C neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV, which is too high. So perhaps the 700-800 keV band is from the 17F decay, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the main neutrino emission energies. Oh, but I can't access the internet, so I have to rely on memory.

The main neutrino sources:

- The dominant ones are the Be-7 neutrinos at ~420 keV.

- The 8B (pp-III) neutrinos are at ~862 keV, which are in the higher energy range.

- The 13C neutrinos are at ~1.41 MeV.

- The 15O neutrinos are at ~6.4 MeV.

So, the 700-800 keV band would be between the Be-7 (420 keV) and 8B (862 keV) neutrinos. So perhaps there are other neutrinos in that range.

Wait, are there any neutrinos from the 7Be decay? No, because 7Be decays into 7Li via capturing a neutrino, but that's the same as the Be-7 neutrino, which is at 420 keV.

Alternatively, maybe the 8B neutrinos are the main source in the higher bands. So, band1 (700-800) would have fewer neutrinos, perhaps none, except from the 8B? But wait, 8B neutrinos are at 862 keV, so they would fall into band2 (800-900 keV). So if the pp-III branch stops, the 8B neutrinos would stop, so band2 would have almost no neutrinos.

But band1 is 700-800 keV; what produces neutrinos there? Maybe the 13N or something else?

Wait, another thought: The pp-III branch produces the 8B neutrinos, which are in band2. So if the pp-III stops, band2 will have a much lower flux. But band1 is 700-800, so perhaps it's from another source.

Wait, are there any other neutrino sources in that range? Maybe the 17F decay? I think 17F decay emits a neutrino around 850 keV or so, which would fall into band2 (800-900). Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the 700-800 keV band is from the same sources but at lower energies. Wait, but 7Be is 420, 8B is 862. So, maybe there's a continuum from other processes, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the neutrinos from the 7Be are a continuous spectrum, but I don't think so. I think each decay has a specific energy.

Wait, alternatively, the 8B neutrinos have a higher energy, so their flux is in band2. So if pp-III stops, their production stops, so band2 flux drops. Band1 (700-800) would not be affected, unless there's another source.

Wait, but the question says that all other reactions remain as they were. So if the pp-III branch is stopped, only the neutrinos from that branch are affected.

So, if band2 is dominated by the 8B neutrinos, and band1 is dominated by other sources (maybe the same 8B, but lower energy?), but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, no. The 8B neutrinos are mono-energetic at about 862 keV, so they're all in band2. So if the pp-III stops, the flux in band2 would drop to almost zero, but band1, which is 700-800, would have its original flux unaffected (assuming band1 has no 8B neutrinos). But what is band1's source?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Are there any other neutrinos between 700 and 800 keV? Let me think about other isotopes.

The 13C neutrinos are around 1.4 MeV, which is higher than band2. The 15O neutrinos are way higher, so that's not relevant. The 7Be is 420 keV. So the only neutrinos in the 700-800 keV range would be from other processes. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the neutrinos from the decay of 17F are in that range. I think 17F has a decay that emits a neutrino around 850 keV, which is in band2. So that would fall into band2.

So then, what is contributing to band1 (700-800)? Maybe another process. Alternatively, perhaps I'm incorrect about the energy of the 8B neutrinos.

Wait, I might have been wrong. Let me think again. The 8B neutrinos are from the decay of 8B, which is created in the pp-III branch. The decay emits a neutrino with energy around 862 keV, right? So that's in band2.

But then, what about the 7Be neutrinos? They're at 420 keV, so they're in a lower energy band.

Wait, but if the pp-III branch is stopped, then the 8B neutrinos would stop, so their contribution to band2 would drop, making the flux in band2 much lower. But what about band1? If band1 doesn't have any neutrinos from pp-III, then its flux remains the same.

Wait, but I'm not sure what contributes to band1. If the only neutrinos in band1 are from the main pp-I branch, but those are at 420 keV, which is lower than 700. So maybe there's no neutrino flux in band1 except from pp-III, but that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the neutrino energies wrong. Let me try to reconstruct:

- 7Be decay: ~420 keV (pp-I).

- 8B decay: ~862 keV (pp-III).

- 13C decay: ~1.4 MeV (pp-II or another branch?).

So, if pp-III stops, the 862 keV neutrinos stop. So band2 (800-900) would have a big drop in flux, but band1 (700-800) would have the same flux as before, because it's not affected by pp-III.

Wait, but if pp-III contributes nothing to band1, then band1's flux is from other sources. But I'm not aware of other sources in that range. So perhaps band1 has a negligible flux, but that can't be right because the question states that the flux is very large.

Hmm, perhaps the pp-III branch produces a continuous spectrum of neutrinos, not just mono-energetic. So some of them fall into band1 and others into band2.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because in reality, neutrinos from a nuclear process can have a range of energies. So perhaps the pp-III branch produces neutrinos with a distribution spanning from lower to higher energies, such that some fall into band1 and others into band2.

In that case, if the pp-III branch stops, both band1 and band2 would lose some of their flux, but I'd have to figure out the ratio.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of band1 to band2. So, if both bands are affected because they both have contributions from the pp-III branch, but perhaps band2 has a higher proportion of pp-III neutrinos.

Alternatively, perhaps each band's flux is dominated by different sources. For example, band1 is from pp-I and pp-III, while band2 is mostly from pp-III.

Wait, but pp-I produces 7Be neutrinos at 420 keV, which is below 700, so they don't contribute to band1. So band1 must be from pp-III, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are all in band2, and the neutrinos in band1 come from another process.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to approach this differently.

If the pp-III branch stopped, the production of high-energy neutrinos (like 862 keV) would stop. So the neutrinos in band2 (800-900) would come from elsewhere, but I think the main source is the pp-III. So without that, band2's flux drops significantly.

Band1 (700-800) would not be affected as much if it's from another source. But if the pp-III neutrinos are the only ones in band2, but also have some in band1, then both would decrease, but perhaps band2 is more affected.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio of band1 to band2 after the pp-III stops.

If band1's flux is F1 and band2's is F2, before the stop:

F1 = F_ppIII_band1 + F_other_band1

F2 = F_ppIII_band2 + F_other_band2

But if the pp-III stops, then F_ppIII_band1 and F_ppIII_band2 become zero. So new F1 = F_other_band1, F2 = F_other_band2.

But if F_other_band1 is from another source, like maybe pp-I or pp-II, but those don't produce in that energy range. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the 700-800 keV band is from the 13C neutrinos? No, 13C is at ~1.4 MeV, which is higher than band2.

Alternatively, the 17F decay, which I think is part of the pp-III branch, emits neutrino around 850 keV, so that's in band2. So the 700-800 could be from a different isotope. Maybe the 15O neutrinos? No, those are way higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the isotopes. Let me think again.

The pp-III branch: Proton captures on carbon-12. The reaction is C-12 + p → N-13, which then beta decays to C-13 and emits a neutrino. Wait, no, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, in the pp-III branch, the main reaction is 3He + 4He → 7Be, which then captures another proton to form 8B, which decays into 8Li and emits a neutrino at 862 keV. So that's the 8B neutrino, which is in band2.

So, if the pp-III branch stops, the 8B neutrino flux (band2) stops. But band1 (700-800) would have to come from another process. But in reality, are there other neutrinos in that range?

I think the 7Be neutrinos are at 420 keV, so they don't contribute. The 8B are at 862. So band1 (700-800) might have a negligible contribution from the 8B neutrinos, but wait, 862 is near 800-900, so maybe the 8B neutrinos are all in band2.

Wait, but 862 is within 800-900, so band2. So if the pp-III stops, the flux in band2 would drop, but flux in band1 would remain the same, because band1 isn't affected by pp-III.

But the question states that the flux is very large and dominated by the Sun. So band1 must have a lot of neutrinos. Wait, but the only other source I can think of is if the pp-III neutrinos have a spectrum that includes some in band1. But earlier I thought they are mono-energetic. Maybe in reality, the neutrinos are emitted with a range of energies, but the peak is around 862 keV.

Wait, if the 8B neutrinos have a spectrum that extends into band1, then stopping the pp-III would reduce both band1 and band2, but perhaps band2 has a higher proportion of pp-III neutrinos.

So, the ratio would change. Let's think about it: if band1 was contributing X% from pp-III and band2 Y%, and both X and Y are significant.

If the pp-III stops, band1's flux would drop to (1 - X), and band2 to (1 - Y), where 1 is the original 100% contribution from other sources. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the majority of the pp-III neutrinos are in band2, so their contribution to band1 is small. So when the pp-III stops, band2's flux drops a lot, but band1's remains almost the same.

So the ratio F1/F2 would be (F1_original) / (F2_original - delta_F2).

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think in terms of the energy distribution of the pp-III neutrinos. If they have a peak at 862 keV and a tail towards lower energies, then perhaps a significant fraction of them are in band2, but some are in band1.

But I'm not sure about the exact distribution. Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are all in band2, and band1 is from another source, which I'm missing. But if that's the case, then F1 remains the same, and F2 drops to zero (assuming all pp-III neutrinos are in band2).

In that case, the ratio F1/F2 would be (F1) / (F2). If F2 was previously a significant part of the total, then F1/F2 would be large. But if F2 was the same as F1, then the ratio would be 1.

Wait, but the question is about the ratio after the pp-III stops. So if F1 is from other sources and F2 is now only from whatever was there before, which is perhaps negligible.

Alternatively, maybe the pp-III neutrinos are the only source of high-energy neutrinos. So the flux in band2 is almost entirely from pp-III. Band1 is from a different source, but perhaps the pp-III also contributes a small part to band1.

Wait, but if the pp-III neutrinos are all in band2, then F1 would remain the same, and F2 would drop to zero. So (F1)/(F2) would be very large, tending to infinity, but that's not an option. The options are 1, 0.1, 0.01, or 10.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos have some in band1. So let's say both bands are affected. Suppose 50% of pp-III neutrinos are in band1 and 50% in band2. Then, after pp-III stops, F1 would be F1_other, and F2 would be F2_other. But I don't know the F_other.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the only source in band2, and band1 has a small contribution from pp-III as well.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos contribute more to band2 than band1. So, if the pp-III stops, F2 drops more.

So, the original flux in band2 is F_ppIII_band2 + F_other_band2. If F_other_band2 is negligible, then F2_new = F_other_band2 ≈ 0. Similarly, band1's flux is F_ppIII_band1 + F_other_band1. If F_ppIII_band1 is small compared to F_other_band1, then F1 remains almost the same.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the majority of the neutrinos in band2 come from pp-III, but band1 comes from another process. Let me think about the relative fluxes.

In the Sun, the dominant neutrinos are the 7Be (pp-I), but the pp-III branch produces a much smaller flux of higher energy neutrinos. So, the 8B neutrinos are a small fraction of the total solar neutrinos.

But the question is about the ratio between two specific bands, not the total flux.

Wait, perhaps the neutrinos in band1 (700-800) are from the same source as band2, but at lower energies. So if the pp-III stops, both bands would lose their contribution.

But if the pp-III neutrinos are all in band2, then band1 remains unaffected. So F1 remains the same, F2 drops to zero, so ratio is infinity. But that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps only a small fraction of pp-III neutrinos fall into band1, so their contribution is minimal.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to approach it differently. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing high-energy neutrinos, around 862 keV. So band2 (800-900) is where these neutrinos fall. The pp-III neutrinos are a small fraction of the total solar neutrino flux.

If the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band2 would decrease significantly because the main source (pp-III) is gone. But band1 (700-800) is below the main pp-III neutrino energy, so it's unaffected. Wait, but 862 is just above 800, so perhaps some of the pp-III neutrinos have lower energies and contribute to band1.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos have a continuous energy distribution, with some falling into band1 and others into band2.

In that case, the higher energy neutrinos (band2) would be more affected than band1. So the ratio of F1 to F2 would depend on how much the pp-III neutrinos contributed to each band.

If the pp-III neutrinos have a peak in band2 and a tail extending into band1, then the majority of their contribution is in band2. So when the pp-III stops, band2's flux would drop more than band1's.

So, suppose the pp-III neutrinos contributed 90% of band2's flux and 10% of band1's flux. After the pp-III stops, band2 flux drops to 10% of its original, and band1 drops to 90%.

Assuming that before stopping, the fluxes were F1 = F_ppIII_1 + F_other_1 and F2 = F_ppIII_2 + F_other_2.

If F_other_1 is zero (no other sources for band1), then after stopping, F1 = F_ppIII_1 and F2 = F_other_2.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the other sources are negligible, or only pp-III contributes to both bands.

I think I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for another approach.

Wait, the question is about the ratio of band1 to band2. The options are 10, 0.01, 1, or 0.1.

If pp-III is the main source of high-energy neutrinos, which fall into band2, then stopping it would reduce F2 a lot. If F1 is from another source unaffected by pp-III, then F1 remains the same, and F2 drops.

So the ratio F1/F2 would increase. For example, if originally F1 was 10 times F2, then after F2 drops to zero, the ratio would be infinity, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps both bands are affected similarly, such that the ratio remains about the same. But that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the main contributor to both bands, but band2 is more affected. So the ratio F1/F2 would increase if F2 drops more.

Another thought: neutrino flux is proportional to the square of the energy or something else? No, flux is number per cm^2 per second, so it's a count rate. The energy distribution matters for which band they fall into.

I think the key point is that the pp-III neutrinos are in band2, and band1 is either unaffected or has a different source.

If pp-III is the only source for band2, then F2 drops to zero. If F1 comes from another source, then the ratio F1/F2 would be very large, but the options don't have that.

Wait, but the question says "flux between two bands of neutrino energies", so perhaps the pp-III neutrinos are the only ones in both bands. So without pp-III, both bands' fluxes drop.

Assuming that the pp-III neutrinos have a spectrum where some are in band1 and some in band2. Let's say that the majority are in band2. So when pp-III stops, the flux in band2 drops more than band1.

Suppose band1's flux is 10% from pp-III and 90% from elsewhere, and band2's flux is 90% from pp-III and 10% elsewhere.

After the pp-III stops, band1's flux would be 90% of original, and band2's would be 10% of original.

So the ratio would be 90% / 10% = 9, which is close to option A (10), but not exactly. But this is a rough estimate.

Alternatively, perhaps the pp-III neutrinos contribute more to band2 than band1, leading to a higher ratio.

Wait, but without knowing the exact distribution, it's hard to say. Alternatively, perhaps the ratio is around 1, meaning that the flux in both bands was mainly from pp-III, so stopping it makes both drop by a similar factor.

But I'm not confident. Another approach: think about the energy of the neutrinos. The 8B neutrinos are at 862 keV, so they're in band2. So band1 (700-800) must come from another source.

Wait, but I don't know another source in that range. So perhaps before the pp-III stopped, band1's flux was negligible? That doesn't make sense because the question states that the flux is very large.

Alternatively, perhaps the 7Be neutrinos have a low-energy tail. But 7Be is at 420 keV, so it's below band1.

So, perhaps the only neutrinos in band2 are from pp-III, and band1 is from another process that's unaffected.

In that case, after pp-III stops, F2 becomes zero, and F1 remains the same. So the ratio is F1 / 0 → infinity. But the options don't have that, so perhaps I'm wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the 700-800 keV band is from the same pp-III process, but in a lower energy part of the spectrum. So if the pp-III stops, both bands drop.

But in reality, the 8B neutrinos are mono-energetic. So if the pp-III stops, the 862 keV neutrinos stop. So band2 (800-900) would have almost no neutrinos, as 862 is the main one.

Band1 (700-800) would have no contribution from pp-III, so it remains as it was.

So, if F1 is from another source and F2 was mainly from pp-III, the ratio F1/F2 would be very high. But in the options, the highest is 10 (option A).

Wait, but if F2 was originally 10% from pp-III and 90% from elsewhere, and F1 is entirely from elsewhere, then after pp-III stops, F2 would drop to 90%, and F1 remains the same. So the ratio would be F1/(0.9 F2_original) = (F1_original)/(0.9 F2_original). But without knowing the original ratio, I can't compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps in reality, the pp-III neutrinos are the only ones in band2, and F1 comes from another source. So the ratio would be F1/F2 = (F1)/(F2_ppIII). If F1 is unrelated, perhaps F1 is about equal to F2_ppIII. So the ratio would be 1, but I'm not sure.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that without the pp-III, the high-energy neutrinos (band2) are gone. So the ratio of band1 to band2 would be large.

But the options suggest that the ratio is either 10, 0.01, 1, or 0.1.

Wait, another approach: when the pp-III stops, the high-energy neutrinos stop. So the 800-900 keV band would have almost no neutrinos. The 700-800 band may have some neutrinos from the same source, but if the pp-III stopped, they would also stop.

But wait, the 8B neutrinos are at 862, which is in band2. So the neutrinos in band1 (700-800) would not be affected by the stopping of pp-III.

Wait, no. Because if pp-III is stopped, the neutrinos from that branch stop. So the 862 keV neutrinos stop, but what about the 700-800? Those would be from other processes.

Wait, but the question says that all other reactions remain as they were. So if the pp-III stops, other processes continue. So the neutrinos from other branches (like pp-I) continue.

Wait, but the neutrinos from pp-I are at 420 keV, so they don't contribute to band1. The question is, what contributes to band1?

Hmm... Perhaps the 700-800 keV band is from the decay of another isotope, like 17F, which is part of the pp-III branch. If that's the case, then when pp-III stops, both bands (700-800 and 800-900) would lose their contributions.

But I think 17F's decay is at around 850 keV, which is in band2.

So, perhaps band1's neutrinos are from another source, like the 13C neutrinos, but those are higher.

Wait, I'm getting really stuck here. Let me try to make an educated guess.

The pp-III branch produces the 862 keV neutrinos (band2), and perhaps a small number of lower-energy neutrinos that fall into band1. So when pp-III stops, both bands' fluxes decrease, but band2's drops more.

Assuming that the majority of the neutrinos in band2 come from pp-III, and only a small fraction in band1, the ratio F1/F2 would be larger than 1.

Looking at the options, option A is 10, which suggests that band1's flux is ten times band2's. That's possible if band1 is from another source and band2 is mainly from pp-III.

Alternatively, perhaps the 700-800 band is from the same source as the 800-900 band, and their ratio is 1. But that's option C.

Hmm. Another thought: since the pp-III neutrinos are mono-energetic at 862 keV, which is in band2, the flux in band2 is dominated by this. The 700-800 band must be from another source, which isn't affected, so the flux there remains the same. So the ratio F1/F2 would be (flux_band1) / (flux_band2 without pp-III).

If band2's flux was dominated by pp-III, then without it, flux_band2 would drop to a small fraction. So F1/F2 would be a large number.

But if the original flux_band2 was much larger than flux_band1, then after pp-III stops, F2 becomes negligible, making the ratio very large. But none of the options are that high except A (10).

Alternatively, perhaps the original ratio was 1, and after pp-III stops, band2 drops to 0.1 times its original, making the ratio 10.

But I'm not sure. Given all this, I think the correct answer is that the ratio is around 10, so option A.


The question involves determining the ratio of neutrino flux between two energy bands, 700-800 keV (band 1) and 800-900 keV (band 2), after the pp-III branch in the Sun's core hypothetically stops. The pp-III branch is responsible for producing high-energy neutrinos, particularly the 862 keV neutrinos from the decay of 8B, which fall into band 2. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Neutrino Sources and Energy Bands**:  
   - The dominant solar neutrinos come from the pp-I branch, producing 420 keV neutrinos from 7Be decay, which are below band 1.  
   - The pp-III branch produces 862 keV neutrinos from 8B decay, which fall into band 2.  
   - Band 1 (700-800 keV) does not have a significant contribution from the pp-III branch, as the 862 keV neutrinos are entirely in band 2.  

2. **Impact of Stopping the pp-III Branch**:  
   - The pp-III branch is the primary source of neutrinos in band 2. If it stops, the flux in band 2 will drop significantly or potentially to zero, as the 862 keV neutrinos are the main contributors.  
   - Band 1 (700-800 keV) is unaffected by the pp-III branch, as its neutrinos are not produced in this energy range.  

3. **Flux Ratio Analysis**:  
   - Before the pp-III branch stops, the flux in band 2 is dominated by the 862 keV neutrinos.  
   - After the pp-III branch stops, band 2's flux decreases significantly, while band 1's flux remains largely unchanged.  
   - The ratio of flux between band 1 and band 2, **flux(band 1)/flux(band 2)**, increases because band 2's flux drops more than band 1's.  

4. **Options and Conclusion**:  
   - The options provided are 10, 0.01, 1, and 0.1.  
   - Given that band 2's flux is heavily dependent on the pp-III branch, and band 1's flux remains largely unaffected, the ratio is expected to increase.  
   - Among the options, 10 (option A) is the most reasonable estimate for the ratio, as it reflects the significant drop in band 2's flux compared to band 1.
