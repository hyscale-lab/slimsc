Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I need to find the expectation value of an operator for a spin-half particle. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the state is given as a linear combination: 0.5|↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Wait, I remember that these |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of the σz operator. So σz|↑⟩ = +1|↑⟩ and σz|↓⟩ = -1|↓⟩. That makes sense.

The operator we're looking at is 10σz + 5σx. Oh wait, right, the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I need to compute ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩.

I think expectation values are linear, so I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That simplifies things a bit. So first, I'll compute each expectation value separately.

Starting with ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, it's easier. The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is just the probability of being in |↑⟩ times +1 plus the probability of being in |↓⟩ times -1.

Let me calculate the coefficients. The state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩. Let me check the normalization. The sum of the squares should be 1. (0.5)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 0.25 + (3/4) = 0.25 +0.75 = 1. So yeah, it's normalized.

The probability for |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25. For |↓⟩ it's (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5. Got that part.

Now the tricky part is ⟨σx⟩. Oh right, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But wait, how do I compute the expectation value of σx in the given state?

I remember that σx can be represented as [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is the expectation of the operator in the given state.

Alternatively, I can compute it using the state components. Let me write the state |ψ⟩ as a column vector. |↑⟩ is (1, 0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1).

So ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩ → as a vector, that's [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

To find ⟨σx⟩, I can compute ψ† σx ψ. Which is the same as ψ† multiplied by σx multiplied by ψ.

So let's compute σx acting on ψ.

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when I multiply σx by ψ, I swap the components. So σx |ψ⟩ would be [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], so the dot product with σx |ψ⟩ is (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5).

Wait, that's (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 *0.5) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, no, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. Let me write it out more carefully.

The matrix σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx |ψ⟩ is the vector [ (0)(0.5) + (1)(sqrt(3)/2), (1)(0.5) + (0)(sqrt(3)/2) ] → [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Then ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. So ψ† (σx ψ) is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Which is (0.5 * 0.8660) + (0.8660 * 0.5) → 0.4330 + 0.4330 = 0.8660 ≈ sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.866. But wait, wait a minute. Alternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward way using expectation values without matrix multiplication.

Another approach: The expectation value of σx can be found using the state's spin in the x-direction. Alternatively, for a state that's a linear combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, the expectation of σx is 2 times the real part of the coefficient of |↓⟩ multiplied by its conjugate, but wait, maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, let's think in terms of expectation value formula for σx. For a general state a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is 2 Re(a b* ). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

The operator σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, if the state is |ψ⟩=a|↑⟩ +b|↓⟩, then the expectation value is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = a* b + b* a. Because when you compute ψ† σx ψ, you get a* (0 a + 1 b) + b* (1 a + 0 b) → a* b + b* a.

So in this case, a=0.5, b=sqrt(3)/2. So a* is 0.5, and b* is sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σx⟩ = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) ) = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) *2 → Wait, 0.5 times sqrt(3)/2 is sqrt(3)/4, multiplied by 2 gives sqrt(3)/2. So that's the same as before, about 0.866.

So that matches the previous calculation.

So, now, putting it all together. The expectation value of the operator is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

We have 10*(-0.5) = -5, and 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5 * 0.8660 ≈ 4.3301.

So adding them, -5 +4.3301 ≈ -0.6699.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute that accurately. Let's compute 5*(sqrt(3)/2) first.

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205, so 1.73205 /2 is about 0.866025. Multiply by 5: 0.866025 *5 ≈4.330125.

So 10σz gives -5, and 5σx gives +4.330125. So total is -5 +4.330125= -0.669875.

So approximately -0.67. But the options are given to one decimal place. So -0.7? Or wait, let me check the exact calculation.

Wait, sqrt(3) is exactly 1.73205080757. So 1.73205080757 divided by 2 is 0.866025403785. Multiply by 5 gives 4.330127018925.

So 10σz is -5, 5σx is 4.330127018925. Adding together: -5 +4.330127018925 = -0.669872981075.

Rounded to one decimal place. So looking at the first decimal: -0.6 is the integer part, the next is 6. So 0.66987... is approximately 0.67 when rounded to two decimals. But we're only looking for one decimal.

Wait, how does one round to one decimal place? The second decimal is 6. So 0.66987 is approximately 0.7 when rounded to one decimal? Wait no, 0.6 is the first decimal, and the second is 6, which is >=5, so we round up the first decimal. So 0.66987 is approximately 0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. But wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, 0.66987 is 0.6 when considering one decimal. The second decimal is 6, which is more than 5, so the first decimal (6) increments by 1, making it 0.7.

Wait, but wait, the value is -0.66987. So the first decimal is 6, the second is 6. So when rounding to one decimal place, it's -0.7, because you look at the next digit (6) which is >=5, so you round up the 6 to 7. So the expectation value is approximately -0.7.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Did I make any mistakes?

Wait, the state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩.

So yes, σz's expectation is (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) → 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. That's correct.

For σx, the expectation is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) → 2*(0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) → (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2)*2 → sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So 5 * 0.866 =4.33.

10*(-0.5) is -5. So total is -5 +4.33= -0.67.

But wait, this is approximately -0.67, which rounds to -0.7 when considering one decimal place.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again: the exact expectation value is -5 + (5 * sqrt(3)/2) → 5*(sqrt(3)/2 -1).

Let me compute sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660, so 0.8660 -1= -0.13398. Multiply by 5: 5*(-0.13398)= -0.6699. So yes, approximately -0.6699, which is -0.67, which rounds to -0.7.

So the expectation value of 10σz +5σx is approximately -0.7, which is option C.

To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle O \rangle = \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \) with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The probability of the particle being in \( |\uparrow\rangle \) is \( |0.5|^2 = 0.25 \), and the probability of being in \( |\downarrow\rangle \) is \( \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75 \). Thus:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented as:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

For a state \( |\psi\rangle = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is given by:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = a^*b + b^*a.
\]

Here, \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = (0.5)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)(0.5) = 2 \cdot (0.5) \cdot \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we find:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The expectation value of the operator is:

\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

Substituting \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle = -0.5 \) and \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx 0.866 \):

\[
\langle O \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Round to One Decimal Place
Rounding \( -0.67 \) to one decimal place gives \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to **Option C**.

The operator we're looking at is 10σz + 5σx. Oh wait, right, the expectation value of an operator is ⟨ψ|O|ψ⟩, where O is the operator. So I need to compute ⟨ψ| (10σz +5σx) |ψ⟩.

I think expectation values are linear, so I can split this into two parts: 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩. That simplifies things a bit. So first, I'll compute each expectation value separately.

Starting with ⟨σz⟩. Since |↑⟩ and |↓⟩ are eigenstates of σz, it's easier. The expectation value ⟨σz⟩ is just the probability of being in |↑⟩ times +1 plus the probability of being in |↓⟩ times -1.

The probability for |↑⟩ is |0.5|^2 = 0.25. For |↓⟩ it's (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4 = 0.75. So ⟨σz⟩ = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5.

So 10⟨σz⟩ is 10*(-0.5) = -5. Got that part.

Now the tricky part is ⟨σx⟩. Oh right, σx is the Pauli X matrix. Its eigenstates are |+x⟩ and |-x⟩, which are superpositions of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩. But wait, how do I compute the expectation value of σx in the given state?

I remember that σx can be represented as [[0,1],[1,0]]. So the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is the expectation of the operator in the given state.

Alternatively, I can compute it using the state components. Let me write the state |ψ⟩ as a column vector. |↑⟩ is (1, 0) and |↓⟩ is (0,1).

So ψ is 0.5 |↑⟩ + (sqrt(3)/2)|↓⟩ → as a vector, that's [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]^T.

To find ⟨σx⟩, I can compute ψ† σx ψ. Which is the same as ψ† multiplied by σx multiplied by ψ.

So let's compute σx acting on ψ.

σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So when I multiply σx by ψ, I swap the components. So σx |ψ⟩ would be [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5]^T.

Then, ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2], so the dot product with σx |ψ⟩ is (0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*(0.5).

Wait, that's (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2 *0.5) = 2*(sqrt(3)/4) )= sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, no, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. Let me write it out more carefully.

The matrix σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So σx |ψ⟩ is the vector [ (0)(0.5) + (1)(sqrt(3)/2), (1)(0.5) + (0)(sqrt(3)/2) ] → [sqrt(3)/2, 0.5].

Then ψ† is [0.5, sqrt(3)/2]. So ψ† (σx ψ) is 0.5*(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)*0.5.

Which is (0.5 * 0.8660) + (0.8660 * 0.5) → 0.4330 + 0.4330 = 0.8660 ≈ sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.866.

So ⟨σx⟩ is approximately 0.866. But wait, wait a minute. Alternatively, perhaps there's a more straightforward way using expectation values without matrix multiplication.

Another approach: The expectation value of σx can be found using the state's spin in the x-direction. Alternatively, for a state that's a linear combination of |↑⟩ and |↓⟩, the expectation of σx is 2 times the real part of the coefficient of |↓⟩ multiplied by its conjugate, but wait, maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, let's think in terms of expectation value formula for σx. For a general state a|↑⟩ + b|↓⟩, the expectation value ⟨σx⟩ is 2 Re(a b* ). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

The operator σx is [[0,1],[1,0]]. So, if the state is |ψ⟩=a|↑⟩ +b|↓⟩, then the expectation value is ⟨ψ|σx|ψ⟩ = a* b + b* a. Because when you compute ψ† σx ψ, you get a* (0 a + 1 b) + b* (1 a + 0 b) → a* b + b* a.

So in this case, a=0.5, b=sqrt(3)/2. So a* is 0.5, and b* is sqrt(3)/2.

So ⟨σx⟩ = (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) = 2*(0.5)*(sqrt(3)/2) ) = (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2) *2 → Wait, 0.5 times sqrt(3)/2 is sqrt(3)/4, multiplied by 2 gives sqrt(3)/2. So that's the same as before, about 0.866.

So that matches the previous calculation.

So, now, putting it all together. The expectation value of the operator is 10⟨σz⟩ +5⟨σx⟩.

We have 10*(-0.5) = -5, and 5*(sqrt(3)/2) ≈ 5 * 0.8660 ≈ 4.3301.

So adding them, -5 +4.3301 ≈ -0.6699.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute that accurately. Let's compute 5*(sqrt(3)/2) first.

sqrt(3) is approximately 1.73205, so 1.73205 /2 is about 0.866025. Multiply by 5: 0.866025 *5 ≈4.330125.

So 10σz gives -5, and 5σx gives +4.330125. So total is -5 +4.330125= -0.669875.

So approximately -0.67. But the options are given to one decimal place. So -0.7? Or wait, let me check the exact calculation.

Wait, sqrt(3) is exactly 1.73205080757. So 1.73205080757 divided by 2 is 0.866025403785. Multiply by 5 gives 4.330127018925.

So 10σz is -5, 5σx is 4.330127018925. Adding together: -5 +4.330127018925 = -0.669872981075.

Rounded to one decimal place. So looking at the first decimal: -0.6 is the integer part, the next is 6. So 0.66987... is approximately 0.67 when rounded to two decimals. But we're only looking for one decimal.

Wait, how does one round to one decimal place? The second decimal is 6. So 0.66987 is approximately 0.7 when rounded to one decimal? Wait no, 0.6 is the first decimal, and the second is 6, which is >=5, so we round up the first decimal. So 0.66987 is approximately 0.7 when rounded to one decimal place. But wait, wait. No, wait. Wait, 0.66987 is 0.6 when considering one decimal. The second decimal is 6, which is more than 5, so the first decimal (6) increments by 1, making it 0.7.

Wait, but wait, the value is -0.66987. So the first decimal is 6, the second is 6. So when rounding to one decimal place, it's -0.7, because you look at the next digit (6) which is >=5, so you round up the 6 to 7. So the expectation value is approximately -0.7.

Looking at the options, option C is -0.7.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Did I make any mistakes?

Wait, the state is 0.5 |↑⟩ + sqrt(3)/2 |↓⟩.

So yes, σz's expectation is (0.25)(1) + (0.75)(-1) → 0.25 -0.75 = -0.5. That's correct.

For σx, the expectation is (0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) + (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) → 2*(0.5)(sqrt(3)/2) → (0.5 * sqrt(3)/2)*2 → sqrt(3)/2 ≈0.866.

So 5 * 0.866 =4.33.

10*(-0.5) is -5. So total is -5 +4.33= -0.67.

But wait, this is approximately -0.67, which rounds to -0.7 when considering one decimal place.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again: the exact expectation value is -5 + (5 * sqrt(3)/2) → 5*(sqrt(3)/2 -1).

Let me compute sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660, so 0.8660 -1= -0.13398. Multiply by 5: 5*(-0.13398)= -0.6699. So yes, approximately -0.6699, which is -0.67, which rounds to -0.7.

So the expectation value of 10σz +5σx is approximately -0.7, which is option C.


To solve the problem, we calculate the expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) for the given spin-half particle in the state \( |\psi\rangle = 0.5|\uparrow\rangle + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}|\downarrow\rangle \). The expectation value is computed as:

\[
\langle O \rangle = \langle \psi | (10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x) | \psi \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle \)
The eigenstates \( |\uparrow\rangle \) and \( |\downarrow\rangle \) are eigenstates of \( \sigma_z \) with eigenvalues \( +1 \) and \( -1 \), respectively. The probability of the particle being in \( |\uparrow\rangle \) is \( |0.5|^2 = 0.25 \), and the probability of being in \( |\downarrow\rangle \) is \( \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.75 \). Thus:

\[
\langle \sigma_z \rangle = (0.25)(+1) + (0.75)(-1) = 0.25 - 0.75 = -0.5.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \)
The operator \( \sigma_x \) is represented as:

\[
\sigma_x = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

For a state \( |\psi\rangle = a|\uparrow\rangle + b|\downarrow\rangle \), the expectation value of \( \sigma_x \) is given by:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = a^*b + b^*a.
\]

Here, \( a = 0.5 \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Substituting these values:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle = (0.5)\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)(0.5) = 2 \cdot (0.5) \cdot \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt{3} \approx 1.732 \), we find:

\[
\langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx \frac{1.732}{2} \approx 0.866.
\]

### Step 3: Combine Results
The expectation value of the operator is:

\[
\langle O \rangle = 10\langle \sigma_z \rangle + 5\langle \sigma_x \rangle.
\]

Substituting \( \langle \sigma_z \rangle = -0.5 \) and \( \langle \sigma_x \rangle \approx 0.866 \):

\[
\langle O \rangle = 10(-0.5) + 5(0.866) = -5 + 4.33 = -0.67.
\]

### Step 4: Round to One Decimal Place
Rounding \( -0.67 \) to one decimal place gives \( -0.7 \).

### Final Answer
The expectation value of the operator \( 10\sigma_z + 5\sigma_x \) is approximately \( -0.7 \), which corresponds to **Option C**.
