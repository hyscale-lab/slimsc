Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again carefully. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli vector, n is an arbitrary unit vector, and ε is an energy constant.

Wait, Pauli spin matrices. Oh right, σ has three components: σx, σy, σz. Each of them is a 2x2 matrix. So the dot product σ · n would be n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz. Since n is a unit vector, n_x² + n_y² + n_z² = 1.

The Hamiltonian H is then a 2x2 matrix. To find its eigenvalues, I remember that for a 2x2 matrix, the eigenvalues are determined by solving the characteristic equation det(H - λI) = 0. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way without getting into matrix components.

Wait, Pauli matrices have some properties. Each Pauli matrix has eigenvalues ±1. But when you take a linear combination like σ · n, what's the eigenvalue?

Oh, wait, I think σ · n is a spin operator in the direction of n. For a spin-½ particle, the spin component along any direction has eigenvalues ±ħ/2. But wait, does that apply here?

Wait, but the Hamiltonian here is H = ε σ · n. So the structure is similar to the energy proportional to the spin component. So if σ · n has eigenvalues ±1, then H would have eigenvalues ±ε.

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. The Pauli matrices themselves have trace zero and determinant -1. But when you take σ · n, what is its trace and determinant? Let's think: each component of σ is traceless and has determinant -1 when squared, but when you take a linear combination, the trace could be zero as well, because each σ_i is traceless.

Wait, but for any unit vector n, σ · n is a Hermitian matrix because each σ_i is Hermitian. So H is Hermitian, which makes sense for an observable like energy.

The eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix are real, which is correct here.

But how to find the eigenvalues without getting into the matrix components. Oh, perhaps using the fact that any Pauli matrix satisfies σ_i² = I, where I is the identity matrix. So, (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz)^2.

Expanding that: n_x² σx² + n_y² σy² + n_z² σz² + n_x n_y σx σy + n_x n_z σx σz + n_y n_z σy σz.

But σi² is I for each i, so σx² = I, same for y and z. So the first three terms are (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) I, which is just I because n is a unit vector. The other terms are cross terms. But since n is a unit vector, the sum of squares is 1.

Wait, what's the cross term for σi σj? I remember that σi σj = I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σk, where ε is the Levi-Civita symbol. So for i ≠ j, σi σj = i ε_ijk σk.

So, when you square σ · n, you get I times the sum of squares, which is 1, plus the cross terms.

Wait, but when you expand (σ · n)^2:

= sum_{i,j} n_i n_j σ_i σ_j
= sum_{i} n_i^2 σ_i² + sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j σ_i σ_j
= sum n_i^2 I + sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j (i ε_ijk σ_k)
Since n is a unit vector, sum n_i^2 =1. So:

(σ · n)^2 = I + i sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j ε_ijk σ_k.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to compute that. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to note that (σ · n)^2 has eigenvalues (±1)^2 = 1, so the square is I.

Wait, wait, no. Because σ ·n is a 2x2 matrix. Let me compute its square. Let me compute (σ ·n)^2.

We can write (σ ·n)^2 = (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz)^2.

Each Pauli matrix σi squares to I. The cross terms are σi σj where i≠j, which are equal to i ε_ijk σk. But when you square the sum, you get sum_i (n_i σ_i)^2 + sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j σ_i σ_j.

So the first sum is sum n_i^2 I = I (since |n|=1).

The second sum is sum_{i≠j}n_i n_j σ_i σ_j.

But each σ_i σ_j = I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σ_k. So when i≠j, it's i ε_ijk σ_k.

So putting it together:

(σ ·n)^2 = I + sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j (i ε_ijk σ_k).

But what's that sum? Let me see.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that (σ ·n)^2 = I, because for any unit vector n, σ ·n has eigenvalues ±1, so when you square it, all eigenvalues become 1, so the matrix is the identity. But wait, no. Because (σ ·n)^2 would have eigenvalues each (1)^2 and (-1)^2, which is 1 for both. So the matrix is I.

Wait, but let me verify for a specific case. Take n along z-axis, so n=(0,0,1). Then σ ·n is σz. So (σz)^2 = I. So yes, in that case, (σ ·n)^2=I. Similarly, for any other direction, because n is a unit vector, (σ ·n)^2 = I.

Ah, so that's a key insight. Therefore, (σ ·n)^2 = I.

So, if I let H = ε (σ ·n), then H^2 = ε^2 (σ ·n)^2 = ε^2 I.

The eigenvalues of H must satisfy λ^2 = ε^2.

So the eigenvalues of H are λ = ± ε.

So the possible eigenvalues are plus epsilon and minus epsilon.

Looking at the options, option B says +ε, -ε. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait. Are these the correct dimensions? The question says ε has the dimension of energy. So the Hamiltonian, which is an energy operator, would have eigenvalues in energy. So option B is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of ħ somewhere. Let me think again. Wait, the Pauli matrices are dimensionless? No, wait, when you have spin matrices, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ. So the eigenvalues of S·n are ± ħ/2.

But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ ·n. So if ε has units of energy, the eigenvalues are ±ε.

Wait, so in terms of spin, if H were proportional to S·n, then the eigenvalues would involve ħ/2. But in this case, the H is given as ε σ ·n, so perhaps that's different.

Ah, because the spin matrices are (σ/2) multiplied by ħ. Let's see.

The standard spin operator is S = (ħ/2) σ. So σ is 2 S / ħ.

So if H = ε σ ·n, then H = ε (2 S ·n / ħ) = (2 ε / ħ) S ·n.

The eigenvalues of S·n are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues of H would be (2 ε/ ħ) * ( ± ħ/2 ) = ± ε. So that brings us back to eigenvalues ±ε.

So, the eigenvalues are ±ε, so option B is correct.

The Hamiltonian is given as \( H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n} \), where \(\vec{\sigma}\) represents the Pauli spin matrices, \(\vec{n}\) is an arbitrary unit vector, and \(\varepsilon\) is a constant with the dimension of energy. To find the eigenvalues of \(H\), we note the following:

1. The Pauli spin matrices \(\vec{\sigma}\) are traceless and Hermitian, and their eigenvalues are \(\pm 1\).
2. For any unit vector \(\vec{n}\), the operator \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is also Hermitian and has eigenvalues \(\pm 1\). This is because \((\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2 = I\), where \(I\) is the identity matrix, ensuring that the eigenvalues are squared to 1.
3. The Hamiltonian \(H = \varepsilon \vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) is proportional to \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\). Therefore, the eigenvalues of \(H\) are \(\pm \varepsilon\), as the eigenvalues of \(\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n}\) are scaled by \(\varepsilon\).

To confirm, we can compute \((\vec{\sigma} \cdot \vec{n})^2\), which expands to \(I\) due to the properties of the Pauli matrices. Thus, \(H^2 = \varepsilon^2 I\), and the eigenvalues of \(H\) must satisfy \(\lambda^2 = \varepsilon^2\), leading to \(\lambda = \pm \varepsilon\).

Analyzing the options:
- Option A (\(+1, -1\)) is incorrect because the eigenvalues must have the dimension of energy, not be dimensionless.
- Option B (\(+\varepsilon, -\varepsilon\)) is correct, as derived above.
- Option C (\(+\varepsilon \hbar/2, -\varepsilon \hbar/2\)) is incorrect because the Hamiltonian does not include a factor of \(\hbar/2\), unlike the spin operator \(S = (\hbar/2) \vec{\sigma}\).
- Option D (\(+\hbar/2, -\hbar/2\)) is incorrect because it corresponds to the eigenvalues of the spin operator \(S \cdot \vec{n}\), not the given Hamiltonian.

Thus, the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are \(\pm \varepsilon\).

Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here. Hmm, let me read it again carefully. The question is about finding the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian operator. The Hamiltonian is given as H = ε σ · n, where σ is the Pauli vector, n is an arbitrary unit vector, and ε is an energy constant.

The eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix are real, which is correct here.

But how to find the eigenvalues without getting into the matrix components. Oh, perhaps using the fact that any Pauli matrix satisfies σ_i² = I, where I is the identity matrix. So, (σ · n)^2 = (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz)^2.

Expanding that: n_x² σx² + n_y² σy² + n_z² σz² + n_x n_y σx σy + n_x n_z σx σz + n_y n_z σy σz.

But σi² is I for each i, so σx² = I, same for y and z. So the first three terms are (n_x² + n_y² + n_z²) I, which is just I because n is a unit vector. The other terms are cross terms. But since n is a unit vector, the sum of squares is 1.

Wait, what's the cross term for σi σj? I remember that σi σj = I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σk, where ε is the Levi-Civita symbol. So for i ≠ j, σi σj = i ε_ijk σk.

So, when you square σ · n, you get I times the sum of squares, which is 1, plus the cross terms.

Wait, but when you expand (σ · n)^2:

= sum_{i,j} n_i n_j σ_i σ_j
= sum_{i} n_i^2 σ_i² + sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j σ_i σ_j
= sum n_i^2 I + sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j (i ε_ijk σ_k)
Since n is a unit vector, sum n_i^2 =1. So:

(σ · n)^2 = I + i sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j ε_ijk σ_k.

Wait, but I'm not sure how to compute that. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to note that (σ · n)^2 has eigenvalues (±1)^2 = 1, so the square is I.

Wait, wait, no. Because σ ·n is a 2x2 matrix. Let me compute its square. Let me compute (σ ·n)^2.

We can write (σ ·n)^2 = (n_x σx + n_y σy + n_z σz)^2.

Each Pauli matrix σi squares to I. The cross terms are σi σj where i≠j, which are equal to i ε_ijk σk. But when you square the sum, you get sum_i (n_i σ_i)^2 + sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j σ_i σ_j.

So the first sum is sum n_i^2 I = I (since |n|=1).

The second sum is sum_{i≠j}n_i n_j σ_i σ_j.

But each σ_i σ_j = I δ_ij + i ε_ijk σ_k. So when i≠j, it's i ε_ijk σ_k.

So putting it together:

(σ ·n)^2 = I + sum_{i≠j} n_i n_j (i ε_ijk σ_k).

But what's that sum? Let me see.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to note that (σ ·n)^2 = I, because for any unit vector n, σ ·n has eigenvalues ±1, so when you square it, all eigenvalues become 1, so the matrix is the identity. But wait, no. Because (σ ·n)^2 would have eigenvalues each (1)^2 and (-1)^2, which is 1 for both. So the matrix is I.

Wait, but let me verify for a specific case. Take n along z-axis, so n=(0,0,1). Then σ ·n is σz. So (σz)^2 = I. So yes, in that case, (σ ·n)^2=I. Similarly, for any other direction, because n is a unit vector, (σ ·n)^2 = I.

Ah, so that's a key insight. Therefore, (σ ·n)^2 = I.

So, if I let H = ε (σ ·n), then H^2 = ε^2 (σ ·n)^2 = ε^2 I.

The eigenvalues of H must satisfy λ^2 = ε^2.

So the eigenvalues of H are λ = ± ε.

So the possible eigenvalues are plus epsilon and minus epsilon.

Looking at the options, option B says +ε, -ε. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait. Are these the correct dimensions? The question says ε has the dimension of energy. So the Hamiltonian, which is an energy operator, would have eigenvalues in energy. So option B is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor of ħ somewhere. Let me think again. Wait, the Pauli matrices are dimensionless? No, wait, when you have spin matrices, the spin operator S is (ħ/2) σ. So the eigenvalues of S·n are ± ħ/2.

But in this problem, the Hamiltonian is H = ε σ ·n. So if ε has units of energy, the eigenvalues are ±ε.

Wait, so in terms of spin, if H were proportional to S·n, then the eigenvalues would involve ħ/2. But in this case, the H is given as ε σ ·n, so perhaps that's different.

Ah, because the spin matrices are (σ/2) multiplied by ħ. Let's see.

The standard spin operator is S = (ħ/2) σ. So σ is 2 S / ħ.

So if H = ε σ ·n, then H = ε (2 S ·n / ħ) = (2 ε / ħ) S ·n.

The eigenvalues of S·n are ± ħ/2. So the eigenvalues of H would be (2 ε/ ħ) * ( ± ħ/2 ) = ± ε. So that brings us back to eigenvalues ±ε.

So, the eigenvalues are ±ε, so option B is correct.
