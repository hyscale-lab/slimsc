Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a sequence of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I need to figure out what the target structure looks like. The name is a mouthful: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. Then, at the 1-position, there's a substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, that substituent is probably a methyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring, and that methyl has an -OH group and another cyclohexyl group. Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexane ring attached to a CH(OH)CH2- group or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH group, which is then attached to the cyclohexane ring. So the structure would be cyclohexane with a CHO group, and at position 1, a CH2-OH group and a cyclohexyl group attached. Wait, maybe it's a branching point. So the substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane. That would mean the main cyclohexane has a group at position 1 which is a CH(OH) connected to a cyclohexyl group. Hmm, perhaps it's a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) group attached to the main cyclohexane.

Wait, maybe the target molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl (CHO) group and another substituent at the same carbon. So the carbon where the formyl is attached has another branch: a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH). Or maybe it's a CH(OH) connected to a cyclohexyl and another CH2 group? I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but maybe it's better to move on and see how the reagents could lead to such a structure.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (C≡CH) attached. Okay, so ethynylcyclohexane. So the initial structure is a cyclohexane with a triple bond to a CH2 group, maybe? Wait, no, ethynyl would be C≡C- attached to the cyclohexane. So it's cyclohexane-C≡CH.

So the goal is to go from that to a more complex structure. Let's think about the possible reactions. The options give several reagents, so I should think about each step in the options and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at the options:

Option A: NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; Ba(OH)2; H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Option B: NaNH2, ethyl chloride; Li/liq NH3; O3, H2O; NH4OH.

Option C: NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3, (CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Option D: NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq NH3; O3, (CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation, like in elimination reactions or for dehydrohalogenation. Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is a methylating agent. So first step in all options except B and D uses NaNH2 and methyl chloride or ethyl chloride.

Wait, Option B starts with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So that might be an alkylation step, perhaps adding an ethyl group.

Then looking at the second steps: some have hydrogenation (H2/Pd), others have Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base and used for elimination, maybe for deprotonation in alkyne chemistry.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane with a terminal alkyne. So, when you have a terminal alkyne, you can do various things. For example, using NaNH2 and an alkyl halide would likely be an alkylation. So the first reagent, NaNH2, would deprotonate the alkyne, making it a strong base. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the alkyne, adding a methyl group. So in the first step, ethynylcyclohexane would react with NaNH2 and CH3Cl to form, perhaps, (cyclohexyl)ethynyl methyl ether? Or wait, no, alkylation of the terminal alkyne would add a methyl group, giving CH2CH2 cyclohexane with a propynyl group? Wait, no. Let me think: ethynylcyclohexane is (cyclohexyl)C≡CH. If we deprotonate the alkyne (H on the CH) with a strong base like NaNH2, the alkyne becomes a strong base (the acetylide). Then, adding methyl chloride would methylate it, so the alkyne becomes (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Me. So now the substituent is a propynyl group.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (C≡CH), so after alkylation, it becomes C≡CMe. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-C≡CMe.

Wait, but that's just adding a methyl group to the alkyne. So now the alkyne is a prop-1-ynyl group attached to cyclohexane. Next steps would depend on what's done with that.

Looking at the options, after the alkylation, some options hydrogenate with H2 and Pd, which would hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. Wait, no, H2 and Pd would hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds, so the triple bond becomes a single bond. So cyclohexane-C≡CMe would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me? Or wait, no, because the triple bond is between two carbons. Let me think: if it's cyclohexane-C≡C-Me, hydrogenation with H2/Pd would add H across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So the triple bond would become a single bond, and the two carbons would each have two H's. So cyclohexane would be connected to CH2-CH2-Me? Wait, no. Let me imagine: the alkyne is C≡C. If hydrogenated, it becomes CH2-CH2. So the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me. Wait, but that would be a three-carbon chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's more correct to say that the triple bond becomes a single bond with two H's added to each carbon.

But wait, if the starting alkyne is (cyclohexyl)C≡CH, and after alkylation becomes (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe. Then hydrogenating that would yield (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2Me. So now you have a cyclohexane ring connected to a two-carbon chain (CH2CH2Me?), but that would actually be a -CH2-CH2-Me group attached to the cyclohexane. So it becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me.

But wait, in the target molecule, we have a substituent with a cyclohexyl group attached. So perhaps this is the wrong path. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol or something else.

Wait, another possibility: after alkylation, the alkyne becomes (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe. Then, maybe subjected to a hydrogenation step that doesn't go all the way, but is partial. Or perhaps, in a different step, we use a different reagent.

Looking at another option: option D starts with NaNH2 and methanol. That could be a hydroxide source, perhaps for deprotonation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the target molecule's structure implies. It has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl (CHO) group and a substituent which is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) group. So, perhaps the formyl group comes from oxidation, and the substituent comes from some kind of alkylation and then oxidation or hydroxylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is functionalized in a way that introduces the necessary substituents.

Another approach: think about the steps in the options. Let's consider each option.

Option A:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: alkylate the alkyne to make (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe.

2. H2/Pd: hydrogenate the alkyne to (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2Me. So now, a cyclohexane with a -CH2CH2Me substituent.

3. Ba(OH)2: perhaps for oxidation or elimination. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used in elimination reactions, perhaps for epoxidation? Or maybe for forming diols? Hmm, I'm not too sure. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Or perhaps it's used in the oxidation of alcohols?

Wait, another thought: maybe the -CH2CH2Me group is oxidized to a ketone. But how? Ba(OH)2 is more of a base, maybe leading to elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihydroxylation step, but that usually involves OsO4 or other reagents.

Then step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: that's a typical Jones oxidation condition, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids or ketones. Wait, but if after step 3 we have an alcohol, perhaps step 4 would oxidize it.

Wait, let me try to reconstruct. After step 2, we have cyclohexane with a CH2CH2Me group. Then step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Maybe that's a way to form a diol. But wait, I don't see how. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 might be part of an oxidation step, but I'm not very clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is part of a Birch reduction, but that's usually for aromatic rings. Hmm.

Option A's steps don't seem to align with getting a formyl group or a hydroxymethyl group. The target has a formyl group, so perhaps one of the steps is oxidation to a ketone or aldehyde.

Looking at option C's steps:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → same as before, (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, catalytic hydrogenation. Hydrogenating the alkyne (C≡C) to CH2-CH2, so the group becomes a two-carbon chain. So cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: O3, (CH3)2S. Ozone followed by workup with (CH3)2S is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a di-substituted alkene would break it into two carbonyl groups. Wait, but in this case, after step 2, the molecule is (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2Me. That's a single bond between the two CH2 groups. Ozonolysis is for alkenes, not single bonds. So that doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait a second, no. Hydrogenation step 2 would hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, so the molecule becomes (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2Me. So in step 3, we have O3. Ozonolysis is for double bonds, so this suggests that between steps 2 and 3, there's a double bond formed. So perhaps I'm missing a step that introduces a double bond.

Wait, maybe after step 2, the molecule is hydrogenated to (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2Me. Then, perhaps a dehydrogenation step would form a double bond, but that's not present in the option.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reagents. Wait, H2/Pd-calcium carbonate is a catalyst for hydrogenation, so step 2 would reduce the alkyne to an alkane.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a formyl group, which suggests that perhaps a primary alcohol was oxidized. So, maybe one of the steps is oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

Option C's step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S, which is ozonolysis. So if the molecule has a double bond after step 2, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps step 2 isn't reducing the alkyne but is doing something else. Wait, H2/Pd is used for hydrogenation. So, the alkyne becomes an alkane. So, perhaps after step 2, the molecule is (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2Me.

But then step 3 is ozonolysis, which requires a double bond. So unless there's a double bond introduced earlier, this doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the first step creates a ring expansion or some other structure. Alternatively, maybe there's a Grignard reaction involved, but that's not part of the options.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol. Methanol as a methylating agent? Or maybe for deprotonation. NaNH2 is a strong base, could deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. But wait, methanol is a poor methylating agent unless in a specific condition. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydroxide source. Hmm, perhaps the first step forms an epoxide or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main cyclohexane. So the substituent is a CH(OH) connected to a cyclohexyl and also to the main ring.

So, considering the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then subjected to some kind of alkylation or Grignard reaction.

Wait, but the options don't involve ketone formation directly. Let me think about possible reagents. For example, if the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, that would require some kind of oxidation. Or perhaps it's converted into a Grignard reagent.

Wait, another possible pathway: the ethynyl group can be converted into an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a trans double bond, which can then undergo some dihydroxylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. So, for example, using O3 (ozone) would cleave the alkyne into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an alkyne would typically give different products. Ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne (like ethynylcyclohexane) would give a diketone or something similar. Let me think: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Ozonolysis would cleave the triple bond, inserting O groups. Wait, for an alkyne, ozonolysis tends to give two carbonyl groups. So for ethynylcyclohexane, ozonolysis would give a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and formaldehyde. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: perhaps the alkyne is converted into an epoxide, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, considering the target molecule has a hydroxymethyl group attached, perhaps a hydroxylation step is involved. For example, using O3 followed by H2O and Zn/HOAc (which is the standard dihydroxylation for alkenes), but that requires a double bond.

So, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a double bond, then dihydroxylated, and then manipulated further.

Let me think: starting with ethynylcyclohexane.

Step 1: hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would turn the triple bond into a double bond. So, we get cyclohexane-C=C-H. But wait, the starting alkyne is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane-C≡CH. So hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, turning it into a cis or trans double bond. So now we have cyclohexane-CH2CH2? No, wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond to a single bond would require excess H2. Oh wait, no. Hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would go all the way to a single bond. But if you use a poisoned catalyst, perhaps you can stop at the double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the first step in the reagent options is not hydrogenation, but something else.

Wait, let's look at the first steps in each option.

Option B: first step is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So, that would alkylate the alkyne. So starting with ethynylcyclohexane, we add an ethyl group, making cyclohexane-C≡C-Et.

Second step: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base used for elimination reactions, such as dehydrohalogenation to form alkynes or alkenes. Wait, but the alkyne is already present. So perhaps it's a deprotonation step, leading to an alkyne that can undergo elimination.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe after alkylation, the molecule is (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Et. Then, treatment with Li in NH3 could cause elimination, but I'm not sure what that would produce.

Alternatively, perhaps the second step is for forming a Grignard reagent, but that's not likely here.

Option D: first step is NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol could act as a methylating agent, but NaNH2 is a strong base. So perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated, and then treated with methanol. But I'm not sure what that would do. Maybe it would form an ether? Or perhaps form a hydroxide group.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step leads to an epoxide, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, all this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think about each option's steps and see which sequence could build the target molecule.

The target has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a substituent that's a cyclohexyl-hydroxymethyl group. So, perhaps the formyl group comes from oxidizing a primary alcohol. So, maybe one of the steps is an oxidation to an aldehyde.

Looking at the options, some steps involve H2SO4 and HgSO4 (Jones oxidation), which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids and secondary alcohols to ketones. But the target has an aldehyde, which is a primary carbonyl group. So, perhaps a primary alcohol is oxidized to an aldehyde. But wait, Jones oxidation (CrO3 in H2SO4) usually takes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, not aldehydes. To get an aldehyde, you might use a milder oxidizing agent, like pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), which stops at the aldehyde stage.

But looking at the options, the fourth step in option A is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's the Jones reagent, which would oxidize a primary alcohol to a carboxylic acid, not an aldehyde. So perhaps that's not the right option.

Looking at option D's steps: step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent, but I'm not sure how that would help. Wait, no, NH4OH is more of a workup solution, perhaps for acidic workup.

Looking at option C: step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps used in elimination reactions or saponification. But I'm not certain how that would help in forming an aldehyde.

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol, but the steps don't directly show that. Let's think about option B.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Et.

2. Li in liquid NH3 → maybe elimination to form a new alkyne or alkene. Wait, but the alkyne is already present. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but I don't think so. Alternatively, Li in NH3 is a strong base, perhaps used for deprotonation, leading to a Grignard-like reagent, but I'm not sure.

3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis. So if the molecule after step 2 is an alkene, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → perhaps a reductive workup, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about each step for each option and see which makes sense.

Another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main cyclohexane. So perhaps the substituent is formed via a cross-aldol addition or some kind of coupling. Alternatively, perhaps it's formed via a Grignard reaction.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed by alkylating the main ring. For example, perhaps an alkyne is converted into a ketone, and then a Grignard reagent adds to it, forming a new carbon center.

Hmm. Let's consider that the substituent comes from a Grignard addition. Suppose we have a ketone group somewhere, and a Grignard reagent adds to it, forming a new carbon chain. Then, perhaps the Grignard reagent is derived from cyclohexyl magnesium bromide or something similar.

But how would the starting material lead to that? The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane.

Wait, another thought: ethynylcyclohexane can be converted into a diketone via ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of ethynylcyclohexane would yield cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and formaldehyde. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, no. Let me think about ozonolysis of an alkyne. Ozonolysis tends to break triple bonds into carbonyl groups. For a terminal alkyne like ethynylcyclohexane, ozonolysis would give a ketone and a formyl group. So, the product would be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and formaldehyde. But that doesn't directly help in forming the target molecule, which has a more complex substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a trans double bond via hydrogenation, then dihydroxylated, leading to a vicinal diol. Then, that diol could undergo oxidation or other steps.

Wait, let me outline the possible steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkylate to add a substituent → hydrogenate to alkene → dihydroxylation → oxidation to form aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing this in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, then treated with something like O3 for dihydroxylation.

Hmm. Let me try to think of the target molecule again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main ring has a formyl group and a substituent at position 1. The substituent is a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexane ring attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group. So, it's a CH2OH connected to a cyclohexyl group, and that's attached to the main cyclohexane. So, the substituent is a CH2-OH group with a cyclohexyl substituent.

So, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction. For example, a Grignard reagent (like cyclohexyl MgBr) adds to a ketone, forming a secondary alcohol. Then, that alcohol is oxidized to a ketone or something else.

Wait, but how would that lead to a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a nucleophilic addition. For example, a hydroxymethyl group (from formaldehyde) could add to a carbonyl group.

Hmm.

Another angle: the target has a formyl group, so maybe the starting alkyne is oxidized into a formyl group. But earlier steps would need to add the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is introduced via oxidation of an alcohol. So, perhaps one of the steps is oxidation to an aldehyde.

Looking back at the options, option D's last step is NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent. Not sure. Option C's steps end with Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Option B's last step is NH4OH, which could be for workup.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first alkylate the alkyne, then hydrogenate to a single bond, then introduce a double bond, undergo ozonolysis to form a carbonyl group, and then perform some oxidation or reduction steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is: alkylation, hydrogenation to alkene, dihydroxylation, then oxidation.

But I'm not seeing any option that includes dihydroxylation. So perhaps I should focus on the presence of O3 in some options.

Looking at option C: step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. So that's ozonolysis followed by reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide, which would give aldehydes or ketones, not carboxylic acids.

So, after ozonolysis, if the molecule had a double bond, it would break into two carbonyl groups. So, perhaps the molecule before ozonolysis has a double bond.

Wait, let's think about option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylate the alkyne, giving (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate the alkyne to (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2Me.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. Wait, but the molecule is CH2CH2Me, which is a single bond; no double bond to ozonolyse. So that doesn't make sense unless I'm missing a step.

Hmm, perhaps the hydrogenation step isn't complete. Maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis double bond. Wait, but H2/Pd would hydrogenate all the way to a single bond. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation step is not the alkyne, but another part of the molecule. But I'm not seeing how that would work.

Wait, perhaps the first step is wrong. Let me think: starting with ethynylcyclohexane, after alkylation, we have (cyclohexyl)C≡C-R. Then, perhaps the next step is to hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis or trans double bond.

Wait, but how? Because H2/Pd would hydrogenate all the way to a single bond. Unless a different catalyst is used. For example, using Lindlar's catalyst would hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond. But I don't see that in any of the options.

So, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Partial hydrogenation to a cis double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form aldehyde.

But none of the options include a Lindlar's step, so perhaps this isn't the right path.

Another approach: the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane, which is itself attached to another cyclohexane. So, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition to a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone. So, ethynylcyclohexane → oxidation → cyclohexanone. But how?

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. To form cyclohexanone, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via some kind of oxidation. Ozonolysis could do that, but only if the alkyne is terminal.

Wait, ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne (like ethynylcyclohexane) would break the triple bond into two carbonyl groups. So, that would give a formyl group on the cyclohexane and another formyl group from the CH part. So, after ozonolysis and reductive workup, perhaps we get cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. But the target has more substituents, so this might not be the case.

Wait, but the target already has a formyl group. So, perhaps the formyl group comes from ozonolysis of the alkyne, and the substituent comes from another step.

Wait, another thought: perhaps after alkylation, the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which can then undergo a Grignard reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation adds a methyl group, and then the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis double bond, which is then dihydroxylated to form a vicinal diol. Then, that diol could be manipulated further.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps in the options.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps this forms a hydroxide group on the alkyne, turning ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexyl-CH≡C-O- something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Adding it to ethynylcyclohexane would deprotonate the alkyne, making an acetylide. Then, adding methanol would... perhaps quench it, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide would react with methanol to form an ether, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is a hydroxide substitution, but that seems unlikely.

I'm getting a bit stuck here, so maybe I should try to think of each step in the options and see which leads to the target.

Another angle: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is attached to the main cyclohexane. So, perhaps one cyclohexane ring is formed from ethynylcyclohexane via some alkylation and hydrogenation steps, and another cyclohexyl group is introduced via a Grignard reaction or similar.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition to a ketone. So, the main ring might have a ketone group, which reacts with a Grignard reagent (like cyclohexyl MgBr) to form a secondary alcohol. Then, that alcohol is oxidized to a ketone, but I'm not sure how that aligns with the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the target's substituent is a result of a conjugate addition. For example, after forming a carbonyl group from the alkyne, a Grignard adds to it, forming a new carbon chain.

So, let's outline:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkylation → (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe.

2. Hydrogenation → (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2Me.

3. Ozonolysis → if there's a double bond, but in this case, it's a single bond, so that doesn't help.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenated to a double bond, perhaps using a poisoned catalyst to stop at the alkene.

3. Dihydroxylation to form a vicinal diol.

4. Oxidation of one of the diols to a ketone or aldehyde.

But looking at the options, I don't see dihydroxylation steps.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent's hydroxymethyl group comes from an epoxide ring opening. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a hydroxylation of a double bond, but again, not seeing the steps.

Hmm, maybe I should give up and try to eliminate the options one by one.

Option A: Steps 3 and 4 involve Ba(OH)2 and Jones reagent. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; perhaps it's used for elimination. After step 2, the molecule has a CH2CH2Me group. Step 3: Ba(OH)2 might induce elimination, forming a double bond. Then, step 4 is Jones reagent, which would oxidize a primary alcohol to a carboxylic acid. But the target has an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid.

Option B: Step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent but perhaps more used in workup. Not sure.

Option C: Step 3 is ozonolysis, but the molecule after step 2 is CH2CH2Me, which doesn't have a double bond, so ozonolysis can't proceed. So option C is unlikely.

Option D: Step 3 is ozonolysis, which again requires a double bond. So unless step 2 leaves a double bond, this wouldn't work. Step 2 is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond. So ozonolysis step wouldn't make sense.

Wait, so none of the options seem to make sense, but that can't be the case. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reagents. For example, in option D, step 2 is Li in liq. NH3. That's a strong base, used for elimination reactions, such as forming alkynes from alkenes, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about each option's possible steps.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: This could deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then react with methanol. But methanol is a poor methylating agent under basic conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a metal acetylide, which then reacts with methanol to form an ether. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step forms a hydroxide group, but that's unclear.

Step 2: Li in liq. NH3. That's a strong base, perhaps for deprotonation to form a strong base, which could lead to elimination. Maybe the acetylide is treated with a strong base to eliminate and form a new structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a trans double bond via elimination.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would cleave a double bond into carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH. Perhaps a reductive workup, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps the sequence is: alkylation, elimination to form a double bond, ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups, and then some oxidation or reduction.

But without a clear understanding, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for which option includes the necessary steps to get a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl substituent.

Looking back at the target, the formyl group suggests oxidation from a primary alcohol. So, perhaps one of the steps is introducing a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized.

Option C includes ozonolysis, which could break a double bond into carbonyl groups. If after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, then ozonolysis would form carbonyls. For instance, if step 2 leaves a double bond, then ozonolysis would create two carbonyl groups. Then, in step 4, Ba(OH)2 could be used for elimination or oxidation.

Wait, perhaps in option C, after step 2 (hydrogenation), we have a CH2CH2Me group. But that's a single bond, so no. Unless step 2 is not hydrogenation but something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps step 2 in option C is a hydrogenation that stops at the alkene. But H2/Pd usually goes all the way. Unless a different catalyst is used, but the option says H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is a typical catalyst for full hydrogenation.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a partial hydrogenation, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that option D is the correct one, but I'm not fully confident.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps a Grignard reagent adds to a carbonyl group, forming a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone. But again, I'm not seeing the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxymethyl group is formed via hydroboration-oxidation of an alkene, but I don't know.

I'm really stuck here, but I'll try to make an educated guess.

The correct sequence likely involves:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to introduce a substituent.

2. Hydrogenation to a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Oxidation or reduction to form the target.

Looking at the options, option C includes ozonolysis, but I'm not sure if the steps make sense.

Wait, perhaps option D is correct. Let me think:

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps forms an epoxide or a hydroxide.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone.

But I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a guess. Based on the options, the correct answer is likely option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule contains a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent at the 1-position, which is a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Alkylates the alkyne, forming (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, yielding (cyclohexyl)CH₂CH₂Me.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation, but it is unclear how this step contributes to forming the target structure.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Jones oxidation, which typically oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids. However, the target molecule contains an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, making this sequence unlikely.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Alkylates the alkyne, forming (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Et.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for elimination, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. However, the molecule at this stage does not have a double bond, making this step ineffective.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild reducing agent, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Alkylates the alkyne, forming (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, yielding (cyclohexyl)CH₂CH₂Me.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis followed by reductive workup. However, the molecule at this stage does not have a double bond, making this step ineffective.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation, but its exact role in forming the target molecule is unclear.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: A strong base, possibly for deprotonation or forming an ether, but the exact transformation is unclear.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for elimination, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis followed by reductive workup. However, the molecule at this stage does not have a double bond, making this step ineffective.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild reducing agent, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly align with the steps required to synthesize the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is the most plausible choice, as it includes ozonolysis, which could potentially contribute to forming the carbonyl groups in the target molecule.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to think it through step by step. The question is about synthesizing a specific compound from ethynylcyclohexane using a sequence of reagents. The target molecule is 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. Hmm, let me break this down.

First, I need to figure out what the target structure looks like. The name is a mouthful: 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So, the main part is cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, which is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) attached. Then, at the 1-position, there's a substituent which is a cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl group. So, that substituent is probably a methyl group attached to a cyclohexane ring, and that methyl has an -OH group and another cyclohexyl group. Wait, maybe it's a cyclohexane ring attached to a CH(OH)CH2- group or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2-OH group, which is then attached to the cyclohexane ring. So the structure would be cyclohexane with a CHO group, and at position 1, a CH2-OH group and a cyclohexyl group attached. Wait, maybe it's a branching point. So the substituent is a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxy)methyl group attached to the cyclohexane. That would mean the main cyclohexane has a group at position 1 which is a CH(OH) connected to a cyclohexyl group. Hmm, perhaps it's a (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) group attached to the main cyclohexane.

Wait, maybe the target molecule is a cyclohexane ring with a formyl (CHO) group and another substituent at the same carbon. So the carbon where the formyl is attached has another branch: a cyclohexyl group and a hydroxymethyl group (CH2OH). Or maybe it's a CH(OH) connected to a cyclohexyl and another CH2 group? I'm getting a bit stuck on the structure, but maybe it's better to move on and see how the reagents could lead to such a structure.

The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. That's a cyclohexane ring with an ethynyl group (C≡CH) attached. Okay, so ethynylcyclohexane. So the initial structure is a cyclohexane with a triple bond to a CH2 group, maybe? Wait, no, ethynyl would be C≡C- attached to the cyclohexane. So it's cyclohexane-C≡CH.

So the goal is to go from that to a more complex structure. Let's think about the possible reactions. The options give several reagents, so I should think about each step in the options and see which sequence makes sense.

Looking at the options:

Option A: NaNH2, methyl chloride; then H2/Pd; Ba(OH)2; H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O.

Option B: NaNH2, ethyl chloride; Li/liq NH3; O3, H2O; NH4OH.

Option C: NaNH2, methyl chloride; H2/Pd-calcium carbonate; O3, (CH3)2S; Ba(OH)2.

Option D: NaNH2, methanol; Li/liq NH3; O3, (CH3)2S; NH4OH.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base, often used for deprotonation, like in elimination reactions or for dehydrohalogenation. Methyl chloride (CH3Cl) is a methylating agent. So first step in all options except B and D uses NaNH2 and methyl chloride or ethyl chloride.

Wait, Option B starts with NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So that might be an alkylation step, perhaps adding an ethyl group.

Then looking at the second steps: some have hydrogenation (H2/Pd), others have Li in liquid NH3, which is a strong base and used for elimination, maybe for deprotonation in alkyne chemistry.

Wait, ethynylcyclohexane is a cyclohexane with a terminal alkyne. So, when you have a terminal alkyne, you can do various things. For example, using NaNH2 and an alkyl halide would likely be an alkylation. So the first reagent, NaNH2, would deprotonate the alkyne, making it a strong base. Then, methyl chloride (CH3Cl) would alkylate the alkyne, adding a methyl group. So in the first step, ethynylcyclohexane would react with NaNH2 and CH3Cl to form, perhaps, (cyclohexyl)ethynyl methyl ether? Or wait, no, alkylation of the terminal alkyne would add a methyl group, giving CH2CH2 cyclohexane with a propynyl group? Wait, no. Let me think: ethynylcyclohexane is (cyclohexyl)C≡CH. If we deprotonate the alkyne (H on the CH) with a strong base like NaNH2, the alkyne becomes a strong base (the acetylide). Then, adding methyl chloride would methylate it, so the alkyne becomes (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Me. So now the substituent is a propynyl group.

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane (C≡CH), so after alkylation, it becomes C≡CMe. So the structure becomes cyclohexane-C≡CMe.

Wait, but that's just adding a methyl group to the alkyne. So now the alkyne is a prop-1-ynyl group attached to cyclohexane. Next steps would depend on what's done with that.

Looking at the options, after the alkylation, some options hydrogenate with H2 and Pd, which would hydrogenate the alkyne to an alkane. Wait, no, H2 and Pd would hydrogenate triple bonds to single bonds, so the triple bond becomes a single bond. So cyclohexane-C≡CMe would become cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me? Or wait, no, because the triple bond is between two carbons. Let me think: if it's cyclohexane-C≡C-Me, hydrogenation with H2/Pd would add H across the triple bond, turning it into a single bond. So the triple bond would become a single bond, and the two carbons would each have two H's. So cyclohexane would be connected to CH2-CH2-Me? Wait, no. Let me imagine: the alkyne is C≡C. If hydrogenated, it becomes CH2-CH2. So the structure would be cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me. Wait, but that would be a three-carbon chain. Alternatively, perhaps it's more correct to say that the triple bond becomes a single bond with two H's added to each carbon.

But wait, if the starting alkyne is (cyclohexyl)C≡CH, and after alkylation becomes (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe. Then hydrogenating that would yield (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2Me. So now you have a cyclohexane ring connected to a two-carbon chain (CH2CH2Me?), but that would actually be a -CH2-CH2-Me group attached to the cyclohexane. So it becomes cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me.

But wait, in the target molecule, we have a substituent with a cyclohexyl group attached. So perhaps this is the wrong path. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a diol or something else.

Wait, another possibility: after alkylation, the alkyne becomes (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe. Then, maybe subjected to a hydrogenation step that doesn't go all the way, but is partial. Or perhaps, in a different step, we use a different reagent.

Looking at another option: option D starts with NaNH2 and methanol. That could be a hydroxide source, perhaps for deprotonation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think about what the target molecule's structure implies. It has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl (CHO) group and a substituent which is (cyclohexyl)(hydroxymethyl) group. So, perhaps the formyl group comes from oxidation, and the substituent comes from some kind of alkylation and then oxidation or hydroxylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the ethynyl group is functionalized in a way that introduces the necessary substituents.

Another approach: think about the steps in the options. Let's consider each option.

Option A:

1. NaNH2 and methyl chloride: alkylate the alkyne to make (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe.

2. H2/Pd: hydrogenate the alkyne to (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2Me. So now, a cyclohexane with a -CH2CH2Me substituent.

3. Ba(OH)2: perhaps for oxidation or elimination. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, used in elimination reactions, perhaps for epoxidation? Or maybe for forming diols? Hmm, I'm not too sure. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 is used in the Birch reduction, but that's for aromatic rings. Or perhaps it's used in the oxidation of alcohols?

Wait, another thought: maybe the -CH2CH2Me group is oxidized to a ketone. But how? Ba(OH)2 is more of a base, maybe leading to elimination. Alternatively, perhaps it's a dihydroxylation step, but that usually involves OsO4 or other reagents.

Then step 4 is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O: that's a typical Jones oxidation condition, which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids or ketones. Wait, but if after step 3 we have an alcohol, perhaps step 4 would oxidize it.

Wait, let me try to reconstruct. After step 2, we have cyclohexane with a CH2CH2Me group. Then step 3 is Ba(OH)2. Maybe that's a way to form a diol. But wait, I don't see how. Alternatively, Ba(OH)2 might be part of an oxidation step, but I'm not very clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the Ba(OH)2 is part of a Birch reduction, but that's usually for aromatic rings. Hmm.

Option A's steps don't seem to align with getting a formyl group or a hydroxymethyl group. The target has a formyl group, so perhaps one of the steps is oxidation to a ketone or aldehyde.

Looking at option C's steps:

Step 1: NaNH2, methyl chloride → same as before, (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe.

Step 2: H2/Pd-calcium carbonate. So, catalytic hydrogenation. Hydrogenating the alkyne (C≡C) to CH2-CH2, so the group becomes a two-carbon chain. So cyclohexane-CH2-CH2-Me.

Step 3: O3, (CH3)2S. Ozone followed by workup with (CH3)2S is ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of a di-substituted alkene would break it into two carbonyl groups. Wait, but in this case, after step 2, the molecule is (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2Me. That's a single bond between the two CH2 groups. Ozonolysis is for alkenes, not single bonds. So that doesn't make sense. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait a second, no. Hydrogenation step 2 would hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond, so the molecule becomes (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2Me. So in step 3, we have O3. Ozonolysis is for double bonds, so this suggests that between steps 2 and 3, there's a double bond formed. So perhaps I'm missing a step that introduces a double bond.

Wait, maybe after step 2, the molecule is hydrogenated to (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2Me. Then, perhaps a dehydrogenation step would form a double bond, but that's not present in the option.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reagents. Wait, H2/Pd-calcium carbonate is a catalyst for hydrogenation, so step 2 would reduce the alkyne to an alkane.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the target molecule again. It has a formyl group, which suggests that perhaps a primary alcohol was oxidized. So, maybe one of the steps is oxidation of a primary alcohol to an aldehyde.

Option C's step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S, which is ozonolysis. So if the molecule has a double bond after step 2, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

Wait, perhaps step 2 isn't reducing the alkyne but is doing something else. Wait, H2/Pd is used for hydrogenation. So, the alkyne becomes an alkane. So, perhaps after step 2, the molecule is (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2Me.

But then step 3 is ozonolysis, which requires a double bond. So unless there's a double bond introduced earlier, this doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the first step creates a ring expansion or some other structure. Alternatively, maybe there's a Grignard reaction involved, but that's not part of the options.

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2, methanol. Methanol as a methylating agent? Or maybe for deprotonation. NaNH2 is a strong base, could deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, which then reacts with methanol. But wait, methanol is a poor methylating agent unless in a specific condition. Alternatively, maybe it's a hydroxide source. Hmm, perhaps the first step forms an epoxide or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main cyclohexane. So the substituent is a CH(OH) connected to a cyclohexyl and also to the main ring.

So, considering the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which is then subjected to some kind of alkylation or Grignard reaction.

Wait, but the options don't involve ketone formation directly. Let me think about possible reagents. For example, if the alkyne is first converted into a ketone, that would require some kind of oxidation. Or perhaps it's converted into a Grignard reagent.

Wait, another possible pathway: the ethynyl group can be converted into an enol ether or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a trans double bond, which can then undergo some dihydroxylation.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation. So, for example, using O3 (ozone) would cleave the alkyne into carbonyl groups.

Wait, but ozonolysis of an alkyne would typically give different products. Ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne (like ethynylcyclohexane) would give a diketone or something similar. Let me think: ethynylcyclohexane is cyclohexane-C≡CH. Ozonolysis would cleave the triple bond, inserting O groups. Wait, for an alkyne, ozonolysis tends to give two carbonyl groups. So for ethynylcyclohexane, ozonolysis would give a cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and formaldehyde. But I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a carbonyl group via oxidation, but I'm not certain.

Another thought: perhaps the alkyne is converted into an epoxide, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, considering the target molecule has a hydroxymethyl group attached, perhaps a hydroxylation step is involved. For example, using O3 followed by H2O and Zn/HOAc (which is the standard dihydroxylation for alkenes), but that requires a double bond.

So, perhaps the alkyne is first hydrogenated to a double bond, then dihydroxylated, and then manipulated further.

Let me think: starting with ethynylcyclohexane.

Step 1: hydrogenation with H2 and Pd would turn the triple bond into a double bond. So, we get cyclohexane-C=C-H. But wait, the starting alkyne is ethynylcyclohexane, which is cyclohexane-C≡CH. So hydrogenation would add H2 across the triple bond, turning it into a cis or trans double bond. So now we have cyclohexane-CH2CH2? No, wait, hydrogenation of a triple bond to a single bond would require excess H2. Oh wait, no. Hydrogenation of a triple bond with H2 and Pd would go all the way to a single bond. But if you use a poisoned catalyst, perhaps you can stop at the double bond. Alternatively, perhaps the first step in the reagent options is not hydrogenation, but something else.

Wait, let's look at the first steps in each option.

Option B: first step is NaNH2 and ethyl chloride. So, that would alkylate the alkyne. So starting with ethynylcyclohexane, we add an ethyl group, making cyclohexane-C≡C-Et.

Second step: Li in liquid NH3. That's a strong base used for elimination reactions, such as dehydrohalogenation to form alkynes or alkenes. Wait, but the alkyne is already present. So perhaps it's a deprotonation step, leading to an alkyne that can undergo elimination.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe after alkylation, the molecule is (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Et. Then, treatment with Li in NH3 could cause elimination, but I'm not sure what that would produce.

Alternatively, perhaps the second step is for forming a Grignard reagent, but that's not likely here.

Option D: first step is NaNH2 and methanol. Methanol could act as a methylating agent, but NaNH2 is a strong base. So perhaps the alkyne is deprotonated, and then treated with methanol. But I'm not sure what that would do. Maybe it would form an ether? Or perhaps form a hydroxide group.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step leads to an epoxide, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, all this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should think about each option's steps and see which sequence could build the target molecule.

The target has a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group and a substituent that's a cyclohexyl-hydroxymethyl group. So, perhaps the formyl group comes from oxidizing a primary alcohol. So, maybe one of the steps is an oxidation to an aldehyde.

Looking at the options, some steps involve H2SO4 and HgSO4 (Jones oxidation), which oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids and secondary alcohols to ketones. But the target has an aldehyde, which is a primary carbonyl group. So, perhaps a primary alcohol is oxidized to an aldehyde. But wait, Jones oxidation (CrO3 in H2SO4) usually takes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids, not aldehydes. To get an aldehyde, you might use a milder oxidizing agent, like pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC), which stops at the aldehyde stage.

But looking at the options, the fourth step in option A is H2SO4, HgSO4, H2O. That's the Jones reagent, which would oxidize a primary alcohol to a carboxylic acid, not an aldehyde. So perhaps that's not the right option.

Looking at option D's steps: step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent, but I'm not sure how that would help. Wait, no, NH4OH is more of a workup solution, perhaps for acidic workup.

Looking at option C: step 4 is Ba(OH)2. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, perhaps used in elimination reactions or saponification. But I'm not certain how that would help in forming an aldehyde.

Alternatively, maybe the aldehyde is formed via oxidation of a primary alcohol, but the steps don't directly show that. Let's think about option B.

Option B:

1. NaNH2, ethyl chloride → (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Et.

2. Li in liquid NH3 → maybe elimination to form a new alkyne or alkene. Wait, but the alkyne is already present. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Birch reduction, but I don't think so. Alternatively, Li in NH3 is a strong base, perhaps used for deprotonation, leading to a Grignard-like reagent, but I'm not sure.

3. O3/H2O → ozonolysis. So if the molecule after step 2 is an alkene, ozonolysis would cleave it into carbonyl groups.

4. NH4OH → perhaps a reductive workup, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress here. Let me think about each step for each option and see which makes sense.

Another approach: the target molecule has a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH(OH) group, which is attached to the main cyclohexane. So perhaps the substituent is formed via a cross-aldol addition or some kind of coupling. Alternatively, perhaps it's formed via a Grignard reaction.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed by alkylating the main ring. For example, perhaps an alkyne is converted into a ketone, and then a Grignard reagent adds to it, forming a new carbon center.

Hmm. Let's consider that the substituent comes from a Grignard addition. Suppose we have a ketone group somewhere, and a Grignard reagent adds to it, forming a new carbon chain. Then, perhaps the Grignard reagent is derived from cyclohexyl magnesium bromide or something similar.

But how would the starting material lead to that? The starting material is ethynylcyclohexane.

Wait, another thought: ethynylcyclohexane can be converted into a diketone via ozonolysis. Ozonolysis of ethynylcyclohexane would yield cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and formaldehyde. But I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, no. Let me think about ozonolysis of an alkyne. Ozonolysis tends to break triple bonds into carbonyl groups. For a terminal alkyne like ethynylcyclohexane, ozonolysis would give a ketone and a formyl group. So, the product would be cyclohexanecarbaldehyde and formaldehyde. But that doesn't directly help in forming the target molecule, which has a more complex substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a trans double bond via hydrogenation, then dihydroxylated, leading to a vicinal diol. Then, that diol could undergo oxidation or other steps.

Wait, let me outline the possible steps:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkylate to add a substituent → hydrogenate to alkene → dihydroxylation → oxidation to form aldehyde.

But I'm not seeing this in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis or trans double bond, then treated with something like O3 for dihydroxylation.

Hmm. Let me try to think of the target molecule again. It's 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. So the main ring has a formyl group and a substituent at position 1. The substituent is a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. So, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexane ring attached to a CH(OH)CH2 group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a cyclohexyl group attached to a CH2OH group. So, it's a CH2OH connected to a cyclohexyl group, and that's attached to the main cyclohexane. So, the substituent is a CH2-OH group with a cyclohexyl substituent.

So, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard reaction. For example, a Grignard reagent (like cyclohexyl MgBr) adds to a ketone, forming a secondary alcohol. Then, that alcohol is oxidized to a ketone or something else.

Wait, but how would that lead to a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane?

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a nucleophilic addition. For example, a hydroxymethyl group (from formaldehyde) could add to a carbonyl group.

Hmm.

Another angle: the target has a formyl group, so maybe the starting alkyne is oxidized into a formyl group. But earlier steps would need to add the substituent.

Alternatively, perhaps the formyl group is introduced via oxidation of an alcohol. So, perhaps one of the steps is oxidation to an aldehyde.

Looking back at the options, option D's last step is NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent. Not sure. Option C's steps end with Ba(OH)2, which is a strong base. Option B's last step is NH4OH, which could be for workup.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is to first alkylate the alkyne, then hydrogenate to a single bond, then introduce a double bond, undergo ozonolysis to form a carbonyl group, and then perform some oxidation or reduction steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct sequence is: alkylation, hydrogenation to alkene, dihydroxylation, then oxidation.

But I'm not seeing any option that includes dihydroxylation. So perhaps I should focus on the presence of O3 in some options.

Looking at option C: step 3 is O3 and (CH3)2S. So that's ozonolysis followed by reductive workup with dimethyl sulfide, which would give aldehydes or ketones, not carboxylic acids.

So, after ozonolysis, if the molecule had a double bond, it would break into two carbonyl groups. So, perhaps the molecule before ozonolysis has a double bond.

Wait, let's think about option C's steps:

1. NaNH2, methyl chloride → alkylate the alkyne, giving (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe.

2. H2/Pd-calcium carbonate → hydrogenate the alkyne to (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2Me.

3. O3/(CH3)2S → ozonolysis. Wait, but the molecule is CH2CH2Me, which is a single bond; no double bond to ozonolyse. So that doesn't make sense unless I'm missing a step.

Hmm, perhaps the hydrogenation step isn't complete. Maybe the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis double bond. Wait, but H2/Pd would hydrogenate all the way to a single bond. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrogenation step is not the alkyne, but another part of the molecule. But I'm not seeing how that would work.

Wait, perhaps the first step is wrong. Let me think: starting with ethynylcyclohexane, after alkylation, we have (cyclohexyl)C≡C-R. Then, perhaps the next step is to hydrogenate the alkyne to a cis or trans double bond.

Wait, but how? Because H2/Pd would hydrogenate all the way to a single bond. Unless a different catalyst is used. For example, using Lindlar's catalyst would hydrogenate the triple bond to a cis double bond. But I don't see that in any of the options.

So, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to add a methyl group.

2. Partial hydrogenation to a cis double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to break the double bond into carbonyl groups.

4. Workup to form aldehyde.

But none of the options include a Lindlar's step, so perhaps this isn't the right path.

Another approach: the target has a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexane, which is itself attached to another cyclohexane. So, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition to a ketone.

Wait, perhaps the alkyne is first converted into a ketone. So, ethynylcyclohexane → oxidation → cyclohexanone. But how?

Wait, but the starting material is ethynylcyclohexane. To form cyclohexanone, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a ketone via some kind of oxidation. Ozonolysis could do that, but only if the alkyne is terminal.

Wait, ozonolysis of a terminal alkyne (like ethynylcyclohexane) would break the triple bond into two carbonyl groups. So, that would give a formyl group on the cyclohexane and another formyl group from the CH part. So, after ozonolysis and reductive workup, perhaps we get cyclohexanecarbaldehyde. But the target has more substituents, so this might not be the case.

Wait, but the target already has a formyl group. So, perhaps the formyl group comes from ozonolysis of the alkyne, and the substituent comes from another step.

Wait, another thought: perhaps after alkylation, the alkyne is converted into a ketone, which can then undergo a Grignard reaction.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkylation adds a methyl group, and then the alkyne is hydrogenated to a cis double bond, which is then dihydroxylated to form a vicinal diol. Then, that diol could be manipulated further.

But I'm not seeing the exact steps in the options.

Hmm, perhaps the correct option is option D.

Option D:

1. NaNH2, methanol → perhaps this forms a hydroxide group on the alkyne, turning ethynylcyclohexane into cyclohexyl-CH≡C-O- something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, NaNH2 is a strong base. Adding it to ethynylcyclohexane would deprotonate the alkyne, making an acetylide. Then, adding methanol would... perhaps quench it, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the acetylide would react with methanol to form an ether, but that's speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the first step is a hydroxide substitution, but that seems unlikely.

I'm getting a bit stuck here, so maybe I should try to think of each step in the options and see which leads to the target.

Another angle: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group, which is attached to the main cyclohexane. So, perhaps one cyclohexane ring is formed from ethynylcyclohexane via some alkylation and hydrogenation steps, and another cyclohexyl group is introduced via a Grignard reaction or similar.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Grignard addition to a ketone. So, the main ring might have a ketone group, which reacts with a Grignard reagent (like cyclohexyl MgBr) to form a secondary alcohol. Then, that alcohol is oxidized to a ketone, but I'm not sure how that aligns with the target.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a Baeyer-Villiger oxidation, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the target's substituent is a result of a conjugate addition. For example, after forming a carbonyl group from the alkyne, a Grignard adds to it, forming a new carbon chain.

So, let's outline:

1. Ethynylcyclohexane → alkylation → (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe.

2. Hydrogenation → (cyclohexyl)CH2CH2Me.

3. Ozonolysis → if there's a double bond, but in this case, it's a single bond, so that doesn't help.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Alkyne is alkylated to add a methyl group.

2. Hydrogenated to a double bond, perhaps using a poisoned catalyst to stop at the alkene.

3. Dihydroxylation to form a vicinal diol.

4. Oxidation of one of the diols to a ketone or aldehyde.

But looking at the options, I don't see dihydroxylation steps.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent's hydroxymethyl group comes from an epoxide ring opening. But again, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is formed via a hydroxylation of a double bond, but again, not seeing the steps.

Hmm, maybe I should give up and try to eliminate the options one by one.

Option A: Steps 3 and 4 involve Ba(OH)2 and Jones reagent. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; perhaps it's used for elimination. After step 2, the molecule has a CH2CH2Me group. Step 3: Ba(OH)2 might induce elimination, forming a double bond. Then, step 4 is Jones reagent, which would oxidize a primary alcohol to a carboxylic acid. But the target has an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid.

Option B: Step 4 is NH4OH, which is a mild reducing agent but perhaps more used in workup. Not sure.

Option C: Step 3 is ozonolysis, but the molecule after step 2 is CH2CH2Me, which doesn't have a double bond, so ozonolysis can't proceed. So option C is unlikely.

Option D: Step 3 is ozonolysis, which again requires a double bond. So unless step 2 leaves a double bond, this wouldn't work. Step 2 is H2/Pd, which would hydrogenate the alkyne to a single bond. So ozonolysis step wouldn't make sense.

Wait, so none of the options seem to make sense, but that can't be the case. I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the reagents. For example, in option D, step 2 is Li in liq. NH3. That's a strong base, used for elimination reactions, such as forming alkynes from alkenes, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let me think about each option's possible steps.

Option D:

1. NaNH2 and methanol: This could deprotonate the alkyne to form an acetylide, then react with methanol. But methanol is a poor methylating agent under basic conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a metal acetylide, which then reacts with methanol to form an ether. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the first step forms a hydroxide group, but that's unclear.

Step 2: Li in liq. NH3. That's a strong base, perhaps for deprotonation to form a strong base, which could lead to elimination. Maybe the acetylide is treated with a strong base to eliminate and form a new structure.

Alternatively, perhaps the alkyne is converted into a trans double bond via elimination.

Step 3: O3 and (CH3)2S. Ozonolysis would cleave a double bond into carbonyl groups.

Step 4: NH4OH. Perhaps a reductive workup, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps the sequence is: alkylation, elimination to form a double bond, ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups, and then some oxidation or reduction.

But without a clear understanding, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for which option includes the necessary steps to get a formyl group and a hydroxymethyl substituent.

Looking back at the target, the formyl group suggests oxidation from a primary alcohol. So, perhaps one of the steps is introducing a primary alcohol, which is then oxidized.

Option C includes ozonolysis, which could break a double bond into carbonyl groups. If after step 2, the molecule has a double bond, then ozonolysis would form carbonyls. For instance, if step 2 leaves a double bond, then ozonolysis would create two carbonyl groups. Then, in step 4, Ba(OH)2 could be used for elimination or oxidation.

Wait, perhaps in option C, after step 2 (hydrogenation), we have a CH2CH2Me group. But that's a single bond, so no. Unless step 2 is not hydrogenation but something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps step 2 in option C is a hydrogenation that stops at the alkene. But H2/Pd usually goes all the way. Unless a different catalyst is used, but the option says H2/Pd-calcium carbonate, which is a typical catalyst for full hydrogenation.

Alternatively, perhaps step 2 is a partial hydrogenation, but I'm not certain.

Hmm, perhaps I should conclude that option D is the correct one, but I'm not fully confident.

Wait, another thought: the target has a cyclohexyl group attached to a hydroxymethyl group. So perhaps a Grignard reagent adds to a carbonyl group, forming a secondary alcohol, which is then oxidized to a ketone. But again, I'm not seeing the steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydroxymethyl group is formed via hydroboration-oxidation of an alkene, but I don't know.

I'm really stuck here, but I'll try to make an educated guess.

The correct sequence likely involves:

1. Alkylation of the alkyne to introduce a substituent.

2. Hydrogenation to a double bond.

3. Ozonolysis to form carbonyl groups.

4. Oxidation or reduction to form the target.

Looking at the options, option C includes ozonolysis, but I'm not sure if the steps make sense.

Wait, perhaps option D is correct. Let me think:

Option D's steps:

1. NaNH2 and methanol → perhaps forms an epoxide or a hydroxide.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the alkyne is converted into a ketone.

But I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make a guess. Based on the options, the correct answer is likely option C.


The question involves determining the correct sequence of reagents to synthesize 1-(cyclohexyl(hydroxy)methyl)cyclohexanecarbaldehyde from ethynylcyclohexane. The target molecule contains a cyclohexane ring with a formyl group (CHO) and a substituent at the 1-position, which is a hydroxymethyl group attached to a cyclohexyl group. The analysis of the options is as follows:

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Alkylates the alkyne, forming (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe.
2. **H₂/Pd**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, yielding (cyclohexyl)CH₂CH₂Me.
3. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation, but it is unclear how this step contributes to forming the target structure.
4. **H₂SO₄, HgSO₄, H₂O**: Jones oxidation, which typically oxidizes primary alcohols to carboxylic acids. However, the target molecule contains an aldehyde, not a carboxylic acid, making this sequence unlikely.

#### **Option B**:
1. **NaNH₂, ethyl chloride**: Alkylates the alkyne, forming (cyclohexyl)C≡C-Et.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for elimination, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O₃/H₂O**: Ozonolysis, which cleaves double bonds into carbonyl groups. However, the molecule at this stage does not have a double bond, making this step ineffective.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild reducing agent, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.

#### **Option C**:
1. **NaNH₂, methyl chloride**: Alkylates the alkyne, forming (cyclohexyl)C≡CMe.
2. **H₂/Pd-calcium carbonate**: Hydrogenates the alkyne to a single bond, yielding (cyclohexyl)CH₂CH₂Me.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis followed by reductive workup. However, the molecule at this stage does not have a double bond, making this step ineffective.
4. **Ba(OH)₂**: A strong base, possibly for elimination or oxidation, but its exact role in forming the target molecule is unclear.

#### **Option D**:
1. **NaNH₂, methanol**: A strong base, possibly for deprotonation or forming an ether, but the exact transformation is unclear.
2. **Li/liq. NH₃**: A strong base, possibly for elimination, but the exact transformation is unclear.
3. **O₃, (CH₃)₂S**: Ozonolysis followed by reductive workup. However, the molecule at this stage does not have a double bond, making this step ineffective.
4. **NH₄OH**: A mild reducing agent, but its role in forming the target molecule is unclear.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing all options, none of the sequences clearly align with the steps required to synthesize the target molecule. However, based on the reasoning provided, **Option C** is the most plausible choice, as it includes ozonolysis, which could potentially contribute to forming the carbonyl groups in the target molecule.

**Answer: C**
