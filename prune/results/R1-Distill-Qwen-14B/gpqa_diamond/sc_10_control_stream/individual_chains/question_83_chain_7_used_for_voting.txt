Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me about titrating acetic acid. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says: We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I'll try to outline what's happening here. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When we titrate them, the NaOH will neutralize the acetic acid, forming sodium acetate. The pH changes at different points during the titration. At 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized. At equivalence, all of it is neutralized, and the solution will be a sodium acetate solution, which should act as a buffer.

But wait, before that, I should calculate the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we're adding 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³. The initial moles of acetic acid can be found using Molarity = moles / volume (in liters). So moles = Molarity × Volume (L).

Calculating initial moles:
Molarity of acetic acid = 0.05 M. Volume = 20 cm³ = 0.02 L.
Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

After dilution to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the new concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. At 25% titration, how much NaOH has been added? Hmm, 25% of the moles of acetic acid. Wait, because each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid. So the moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001, so 25% is 0.00025 moles of NaOH needed.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about it. The volume of NaOH added would be (moles of NaOH) / (concentration of NaOH). So for 25% titration, moles NaOH = 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles. The concentration is 0.1 M, so volume is 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's necessary for the first part. Maybe I should find the pH at 25% of the equivalence point.

Wait, but first, let's find the equivalence point volume. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid. Initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001. So, moles NaOH needed = 0.001. At 0.1 M, the volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So 10 cm³ of NaOH will reach equivalence.

So when the question says 25% titration, that means 25% of the equivalence volume has been added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at this point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Now, what happens during the titration? The acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts with NaOH (a strong base) to form its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-), and water.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, 0.25 of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles of CH3COOH remaining would be 0.75 × initial moles, and the moles of CH3COO^- formed would be 0.25 × initial moles.

Wait, wait. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001. So 0.25 titrated means 0.00025 moles of acetic acid neutralized. So remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of acetate ion formed are 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the total volume is important for concentrations. The solution's volume is the initial diluted volume plus the volume of NaOH added. Oh wait, but since the NaOH volume is 2.5 cm³, which is much smaller, perhaps we can approximate or see if it's negligible. Alternatively, maybe we should calculate it accurately.

Wait, the initial acetic acid solution after dilution was 40 cm³. Then, adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH solution. So total volume is 42.5 cm³. So 0.0425 L.

So, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = let's calculate that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka = 1.85e-5. So pKa ≈ 4.74 (since 1e-5 is 5, 1.85 is about 4.74 because 10^-4.74 ≈ 1.85e-5).

So pH = 4.74 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's compute that ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. So log(1/3) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.74 - 0.477 ≈ 4.263.

Wait, but the options have 4.26 as one of the first numbers, option A. But I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Wait another thing: When you dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the concentration becomes 0.025 M, as I thought earlier. So the initial solution is 0.025 M CH3COOH.

At 25% titration, 25% of that solution has been neutralized. So, for each 4 moles of CH3COOH, 1 mole is neutralized (since it's 25%). So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (1)/(3), which in the Henderson equation gives log (1/3) = -0.477. So pH = 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263, so about 4.26. So for the first part, it's around 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ion. So the solution will contain only the conjugate base, CH3COO^- . But since it's a weak base, it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

The concentration of acetate ions at equivalence can be calculated. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals moles of CH3COOH initially. So, the moles of acetate ion will be 0.001 moles.

The total volume is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (10 cm³), so 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate: 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of OH^- can be found using the Kb expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-], and the initial concentration is 0.02 M, which is much larger than x (since Kb is very small), we can approximate:

Kb ≈ x^2 / 0.02.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. Then, pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have 9.02 as equivalence point. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001. At equivalence, all of that is converted to acetate, so moles of acetate are 0.001. The volume is 40 cm³ (diluted) plus 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ 4.74. So Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) → let's compute that.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405 * 1e-9 = 5.405e-10. So that part was correct.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

So the expression is Kb = x² / (0.02 - x). Since x is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04) is about 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is -5 + 0.017 → so 4.983. So pOH ≈ 4.98 → pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

But looking at the options, none of the equivalence points are around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the volume.

Wait, wait. Another approach: perhaps I messed up the dilution steps. Let me double-check.

Original volume of acetic acid: 20 cm³ (0.02 L) at 0.05 M → moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then, adding 20 cm³ of water (dilution), so total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the diluted concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

At equivalence point, all 0.001 moles are neutralized. The NaOH needed is 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So total volume after adding NaOH is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³ → 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. So the earlier calculation seems correct, leading to pH ≈9.02. But none of the options have equivalence pH around 9.

Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Options for equivalence point:

A) 4.26; 8.52 → second number is 8.52.

B) 3.17; 6.73 → 6.73.

C)4.73;7.00 → 7.00.

D)4.57;6.92 → 6.92.

Wait, but none of these are around 9. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the equivalence point calculation is wrong because I forgot that when NaOH is added, the solution becomes a buffer, but wait no, the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized, so it's a solution of the conjugate base.

Wait another thought: perhaps the volume used in the calculation for the equivalence point was wrong. Let me see. The initial diluted solution is 40 cm³, and equivalence requires adding 10 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 50 cm³. So [CH3COO^-] is 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Wait, but maybe I should not have added the initial 40 and the 10. Or wait, no, because the solution after adding 10 cm³ of NaOH is 50 cm³ total.

Hmm, but why are the options not matching. Let me think another way.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me recalculate.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa is about 4.74. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10.

Yes, that's correct.

So back to the calculation. [CH3COO^-] =0.02 M.

The reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced. Then,

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

[OH^-] = x.

So,

Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

But none of the options have 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the dilution.

Wait, another approach: Let me calculate the pH at equivalence point using another method. Alternatively, perhaps the solution isn't just the conjugate base but maybe I forgot that some of the acetate comes from the NaOH and the solution's volume is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the equivalence point isn't a strong base solution. Wait, no, NaOH is a strong base, so it's neutralizing the weak acid completely, forming the conjugate base.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles of acetic acid. Let me double-check.

Original volume: 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid.

Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles → correct.

Diluted to 40 cm³ → concentration 0.025 M → correct.

At equivalence point, all 0.001 moles are converted to acetate. Volume is 50 cm³ → 0.05 L.

Concentration = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M → correct.

So the calculation of the pH at equivalence point comes to about 9.02, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution after equivalence is a buffer again, but no, equivalence is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson equation for the 25% titration. Let me check that again.

At 25% titration: 25% of the moles have been neutralized. So moles of CH3COOH = 0.75 * 0.001 = 0.00075 moles. Moles of acetate = 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

So [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.01765 M.

[acetate] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So ratio [A^-]/[HA] = 0.005882 / 0.01765 ≈ 0.3333.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log( (0.3333) ) → pKa is 4.74, log(1/3) is about -0.477. So 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263.

So that part is correct. So the first pH is around 4.26.

Now, looking again at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52 for equivalence. But my calculation gave equivalence point around 9.02, which is not an option.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of Kb again. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for pH at equivalence point differently.

Wait, another approach: Maybe using the hydrolysis reaction and the exact expression.

The acetate ion concentration is 0.02 M.

The reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb is 5.405e-10.

So,

Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) → x² = Kb (0.02 - x).

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, then x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → same as before, about 1.04e-5 M. So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH ≈4.98 → pH≈9.02.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial dilution step. Let me check again. The initial acetic acid is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M, so 0.001 moles. Adding 20 cm³ of water → 40 cm³ total. So 0.025 M. That's correct.

At equivalence, adding 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles of NaOH = 0.1 * 0.01 = 0.001 moles, which neutralizes the 0.001 moles of acetic acid. So the moles of acetate are 0.001.

Total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³. So [acetate] is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

So why the options don't have equivalence pH around 9? Let me look at the options again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the acetate ion concentration. Or maybe I should consider that the solution is not just acetate but some other factor, like activity coefficients? No, that's probably beyond the scope.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is not in calculation but in the initial approach. Another way to approach the equivalence point is using the formula for the pH of a salt solution of a weak acid.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution at equivalence is a solution of sodium acetate, which dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

The sodium ions are spectator ions, so they don't affect pH. The acetate ions hydrolyze in water as I did earlier. So the pH calculation should be correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there any chance that the question is asking for the pH at 25% of the initial volume, not 25% of the equivalence? No, the question says 25% titration, which is 25% of the way to equivalence.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different way to calculate the pH at equivalence, such as using the initial concentration.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate moles more accurately. Let's compute more precisely.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH added is 0.001 moles. So, the acetate ion is 0.001 moles in 50 cm³ → 0.02 M.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10.

So,

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Initial: 0.02 M acetate, 0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium concentrations: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x, [CH3COOH] = x, [OH^-] = x.

So,

Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) → since x is small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 → x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11) → 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → approximately 4.98 (since 1e-5 is pH 5, and 1.04 is slightly higher, so pOH is about 4.98 → pH = 9.02.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations.

Wait, oh! Maybe the question is at 25% of the initial volume, but that's not what the question says. The question says 25% titration, which is 25% of the way to equivalence, not 25% of the initial volume.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation for the equivalence point.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution at equivalence isn't 0.02 M, but perhaps I should calculate the actual volume more accurately.

Wait, no. The initial volume is 40 cm³, and NaOH added is 10 cm³, so total 50 cm³. Moles are 0.001, so 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the way I'm calculating Kb. Let me recompute Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5, so pKa = 4.74.

Kb = Kw / Ka → 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) → 5.405e-10.

That's correct.

So, the pH at equivalence is about 9.02. Wait, but I don't see that in the options. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option D says pH is 4.57 at 25% and 6.92 at equivalence. Hmm. How can that be? 6.92 would imply that at equivalence, it's a weak acid solution. But that's not possible because at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized, so the solution should be basic.

Unless there's a mistake and the solution is not at equivalence, but perhaps I have the wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Henderson equation at equivalence, but that's only when some of the acid remains. At equivalence, the solution is a buffer only if the stoichiometric point is not exact. But in reality, at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized, and the solution is a conjugate base solution.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the solution at equivalence as a solution of sodium acetate, and use the same approach as before.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence using the exact quadratic formula, not the approximation.

So,

x² = Kb * (0.02 - x) → x² + Kb x - 2 Kb * 1e-2 = 0.

Wait, plugging in the numbers:

x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02 - x)

x² +5.405e-10 x - (5.405e-10 * 0.02) =0 → x² +5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ] / 2a.

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant = (5.405e-10)^2 + 4*1*1.081e-11 → approx (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) → 4.324e-11 is much larger, so sqrt ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

x = [ -5.4e-10 ± 6.576e-6 ] / 2 → take positive root: (6.576e-6 -5.4e-10)/2 ≈ 3.288e-6.

So x ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288) is about 0.517 → so 5.483 → pH = 14 -5.483 =8.517.

Wait, that's about 8.52. So that would match option A's second value of 8.52.

But earlier approximation gave 9.02. So why the discrepancy? Because when we don't neglect x compared to 0.02, the x is about 3.288e-6, which is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation is still valid. So why does the quadratic solution give a different result?

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck the quadratic approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic equation. Let me compute more accurately.

The equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x - 1.081e-11 = 0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 + 4*1*1.081e-11 ) ] / 2.

Compute the discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 * 1e-20 = 29.214 * 1e-20 = 2.9214e-19.

4ac =4 *1*(-1.081e-11) → wait, no, c is -1.081e-11, so 4ac is 4*1*(-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11. Hmm, but in the discriminant, it's b² -4ac. Wait, no: the discriminant is b² -4ac, but in this case, since a=1, c= -1.081e-11, so 4ac = 4 *1 * (-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11. But the discriminant is b² -4ac → (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → (2.921e-19) + (4.324e-11) → ≈ 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(4.324e-11) = 6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 → [ (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10) ] / 2 → approximately 6.576e-6 / 2 = 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 M → pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288) is about 0.517 → so pOH is ~5.483 → pH = 14 -5.483 =8.517 → ~8.52.

Wait, that's a very different result than before. So earlier when I used the approximation, I got x=1.04e-5, but with the quadratic, I get x=3.288e-6. That's a big difference. Hmm. Why?

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic approach. Let me double-check. The equation was x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 = 0.

Wait, wait, when I plugged into the quadratic formula, perhaps I missed a negative sign. Wait, in the standard ax² +bx +c=0, the quadratic solution is (-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac))/(2a).

In this case, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 ) ] / 2.

Wait, the term under the square root is (b² -4ac). Since c is negative, -4ac becomes positive.

So,

sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*(1.081e-11) ) → sqrt(2.921e-19 +4.324e-11) → sqrt(4.324e-11 + 2.921e-19) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) → approx 6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (6.576e-6 - 5.405e-10) → approx 6.576e-6.

Divide by 2: 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 → pOH = log(3.288e-6) → wait, no: pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.517, so 5.483 → pH=8.517.

Wait, that's about 8.52. So the pH at equivalence is 8.52, which matches option A's second value of 8.52.

But earlier when I used the approximation, I thought x was 1.04e-5, which would give pH around 9.02. So what's the issue here? Oh, I think I must have mixed up the Kb value earlier.

Wait, when I used the approximation, I used x^2 = Kb * 0.02 → 5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

But with the quadratic, I get x=3.288e-6.

Wait, that can't be right. There must be a mistake in the calculation. Wait, 3.288e-6 squared is about 1.081e-11, which is correct because x^2 is 1.081e-11.

Wait, no: (3.288e-6)^2 = (3.288)^2 x 1e-12 → 10.81 x 1e-12 → 1.081e-11. So yes, correct.

So why the discrepancy? Because when I did the approximation, I assumed x is much smaller than 0.02, but in reality, x is 3.288e-6, which is much smaller than 0.02 (which is 2e-2). So the approximation should hold, and x is 1.04e-5.

Wait, but according to the quadratic solution, x is 3.288e-6. Which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb value. Let me recompute Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa=4.74 → Kb=1e-14/1.85e-5=5.405e-10.

That's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for Kb. Let's see: the correct expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

At equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] =0.02 - x ≈0.02.

But according to the quadratic solution, x is 3.288e-6, which is about 0.000016% of 0.02. So the approximation holds.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated x using the approximation, I got x=1.04e-5. However, according to the quadratic solution, x=3.288e-6. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me compute x^2= Kb * 0.02 → 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 1.04e-5.

Wait, but that contradicts the quadratic approach. I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic setup. Let me re-express the equation.

The correct equation is:

x² = Kb * (0.02 - x)

So,

x² + Kb x - Kb * 0.02 =0 → x² + (5.405e-10)x - (5.405e-10 * 0.02) =0 → x² +5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 ) ] / 2.

The square root term is sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1.081e-11 ) → sqrt(2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 ) → sqrt(4.324e-11 + 2.921e-19) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) → 6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 → approximately (6.576e-6) /2 → 3.288e-6.

But according to the approximation, x is 1.04e-5.

This suggests that the quadratic solution gives a different result, but that can't be right because when x is small, the approximation should hold.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic approach. Let me compute (5.405e-10)^2 → (5.405)^2 is about 29.214 → 29.214e-20 = 2.9214e-19.

Adding 4*1*1.081e-11 → 4.324e-11.

So the sum is (2.9214e-19 +4.324e-11) ≈ 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(4.324e-11) → 6.576e-6.

So x is approximately (6.576e-6)/2 → 3.288e-6.

Wait, but wait, why is this x so much smaller than the approximation? Because if x is 3.288e-6, then (x^2) is (3.288e-6)^2 = 1.081e-11, which matches Kb *0.02 → yes.

Wait, so when I use the approximation, I get x=1.04e-5, but with the exact solution, x is about 3.288e-6, which is about a third of the approximation. So why is this discrepancy?

Ah, I think I see the mistake. Earlier, I thought x²=1.081e-11, so x= sqrt(1.081e-11)≈1.04e-5. But according to the exact solution, x should be 3.288e-6, which is about 3.16 times smaller. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation.

Wait, perhaps I confused between Kb and Ka. Let me make sure: Kb is 5.405e-10.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I set up the Kb expression.

Another approach: perhaps the correct way is to calculate the pH at equivalence using the formula for a weak base. The formula for pH when you have a solution of a weak base is:

pH = ½ (pKb - log C )

Wait, wait, no, that's for a weak acid when you have a solution where concentration is C. Alternatively, for a weak base, the pH can be found using:

pOH = ½ (pKb - log C ), but I'm not sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps for a weak base, the pH can be approximated using:

[OH^-] ≈ sqrt( Kb * C )

But in this case, Kb is 5.405e-10 and C is 0.02 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02 ) → sqrt(1.081e-11) → 1.04e-5 M → pOH≈4.98 → pH≈9.02.

But according to the exact solution, it's 3.288e-6 → pOH=5.483 → pH=8.517.

Wait, this is very confusing. There must be a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the solution at equivalence isn't just the conjugate base. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer solution, but that's only if some of the acid remains. No, at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial moles. Let me recount.

Initial moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

At equivalence, all 0.001 moles are neutralized, so moles of acetate is 0.001.

Volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³ →0.05 L → concentration 0.02 M.

So, Kb=5.405e-10.

So,

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The correct expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

At initial, [CH3COO^-] =0.02 M, [CH3COOH]=0, [OH^-]=0.

At equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] =0.02 - x, [CH3COOH]=x, [OH^-]=x.

So,

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) → x² = Kb*(0.02 -x).

Assuming x is small, 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02 → x≈ sqrt( Kb *0.02 ) → sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02 )=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

But according to the quadratic, x is 3.288e-6.

So, which is correct? There must be a mistake in either the setup or the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact solution without approximation.

Let me compute:

x² = Kb*(0.02 -x) → x² =5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).

Rearranging:

x² +5.405e-10 x - (5.405e-10 *0.02)=0 → x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula, x= [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 ) ] / 2.

Compute the discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.921e-19.

4*1*1.081e-11 =4.324e-11.

Sum: 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈4.324e-11.

sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

So,

x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 → approximately 6.576e-6 /2=3.288e-6.

So x=3.288e-6 M.

Which gives [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.483 → pH=8.517.

Ah, so my earlier approximation was incorrect because I assumed x is negligible compared to 0.02, which it is, but the quadratic approach gives a more accurate value, which is lower than the approximation.

So the correct pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52, which matches option A's second value.

Wait, but earlier when I used the approximation, I thought x=1.04e-5 → pH=9.02, but the exact solution gives x=3.288e-6 → pH=8.52.

So this suggests that the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52, which matches option A.

Now, looking at the options again:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52.

Option D:4.57;6.92.

So, the first part (25% titration) is 4.26, and equivalence is 8.52. So the correct option would be A.

But wait, earlier when I computed the first part, I found pH=4.26, which matches option A.

So the correct answer would be option A.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water) with 0.1 M NaOH. The goal is to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Setup and Dilution**
- **Initial moles of acetic acid**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
  \]
- After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L).  
  \[
  \text{New concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
  \]

---

### **Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.  
- **Moles of acetic acid remaining**:  
  \[
  0.75 \times 0.001 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
  \]
- **Moles of acetate ion formed**:  
  \[
  0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
  \]
- **Total volume after adding NaOH**:  
  \[
  40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
  \]
- **Concentrations**:  
  \[
  [\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
  \]
  where \( K_a = 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \), so \( \text{p}K_a \approx 4.74 \).  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 4.74 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.74 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.26.
  \]

---

### **Step 3: pH at Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 moles of acetate ion.  
- **Total volume**:  
  \[
  40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
  \]
- **Concentration of acetate ion**:  
  \[
  [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:  
  \[
  \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
  \]
  The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10} \).
- Let \( [\text{OH}^-] = x \). Using the expression for \( K_b \):  
  \[
  K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
  \]
  Since \( x \) is small compared to 0.02, approximate \( [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] \approx 0.02 \):  
  \[
  x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.41 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.082 \times 10^{-11}.
  \]
  \[
  x = \sqrt{1.082 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
  \]
  \[
  \text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
  \]
  However, using the quadratic solution for \( x \) gives a slightly lower value:  
  \[
  x \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}, \quad \text{pOH} \approx 5.48, \quad \text{pH} \approx 8.52.
  \]

---

### **Step 4: Final Answer**
- At 25% titration, the pH is approximately **4.26**.  
- At the equivalence point, the pH is approximately **8.52**.  

These values match **Option A**.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me about titrating acetic acid. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem says: We have 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid, and we dilute it with 20.00 cm³ of water. Then, we titrate this diluted solution with 0.1 M NaOH. The question is asking for the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point. The options are A, B, C, D.

First, I'll try to outline what's happening here. Acetic acid is a weak acid, and NaOH is a strong base. When we titrate them, the NaOH will neutralize the acetic acid, forming sodium acetate. The pH changes at different points during the titration. At 25% titration, only a quarter of the acetic acid has been neutralized. At equivalence, all of it is neutralized, and the solution will be a sodium acetate solution, which should act as a buffer.

But wait, before that, I should calculate the initial concentration after dilution. The initial volume is 20 cm³, and we're adding 20 cm³ of water, so the total volume is 40 cm³. The initial moles of acetic acid can be found using Molarity = moles / volume (in liters). So moles = Molarity × Volume (L).

Calculating initial moles:
Molarity of acetic acid = 0.05 M. Volume = 20 cm³ = 0.02 L.
Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles.

After dilution to 40 cm³ (0.04 L), the new concentration is moles / volume = 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. So the diluted solution is 0.025 M acetic acid.

Now, the titration with 0.1 M NaOH. At 25% titration, how much NaOH has been added? Hmm, 25% of the moles of acetic acid. Wait, because each mole of NaOH neutralizes one mole of acetic acid. So the moles of acetic acid initially are 0.001, so 25% is 0.00025 moles of NaOH needed.

Wait, but wait. Let's think about it. The volume of NaOH added would be (moles of NaOH) / (concentration of NaOH). So for 25% titration, moles NaOH = 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles. The concentration is 0.1 M, so volume is 0.00025 / 0.1 = 0.0025 L = 2.5 cm³.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's necessary for the first part. Maybe I should find the pH at 25% of the equivalence point.

Wait, but first, let's find the equivalence point volume. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH = moles of acetic acid. Initial moles of acetic acid is 0.001. So, moles NaOH needed = 0.001. At 0.1 M, the volume is 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So 10 cm³ of NaOH will reach equivalence.

So when the question says 25% titration, that means 25% of the equivalence volume has been added. So 25% of 10 cm³ is 2.5 cm³. So at this point, 2.5 cm³ of NaOH has been added.

Now, what happens during the titration? The acetic acid (CH3COOH) reacts with NaOH (a strong base) to form its conjugate base, acetate ion (CH3COO^-), and water.

The reaction is: CH3COOH + NaOH → CH3COO^- Na+ + H2O.

At 25% titration, 0.25 of the acetic acid has been neutralized. So the moles of CH3COOH remaining would be 0.75 × initial moles, and the moles of CH3COO^- formed would be 0.25 × initial moles.

Wait, wait. The initial moles of acetic acid are 0.001. So 0.25 titrated means 0.00025 moles of acetic acid neutralized. So remaining acetic acid is 0.001 - 0.00025 = 0.00075 moles. And moles of acetate ion formed are 0.00025 moles.

But wait, the total volume is important for concentrations. The solution's volume is the initial diluted volume plus the volume of NaOH added. Oh wait, but since the NaOH volume is 2.5 cm³, which is much smaller, perhaps we can approximate or see if it's negligible. Alternatively, maybe we should calculate it accurately.

Wait, the initial acetic acid solution after dilution was 40 cm³. Then, adding 2.5 cm³ of NaOH solution. So total volume is 42.5 cm³. So 0.0425 L.

So, the concentrations are:

[CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 = let's calculate that. 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.017647 M.

[CH3COO^-] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

Now, since this is a buffer solution (a weak acid and its conjugate base), the pH can be found using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:

pH = pKa + log([A^-]/[HA])

pKa is given by -log(Ka). Ka = 1.85e-5. So pKa ≈ 4.74 (since 1e-5 is 5, 1.85 is about 4.74 because 10^-4.74 ≈ 1.85e-5).

So pH = 4.74 + log(0.005882 / 0.017647). Let's compute that ratio: 0.005882 / 0.017647 ≈ 0.3333. So log(1/3) is about -0.477.

So pH ≈ 4.74 - 0.477 ≈ 4.263.

Wait, but the options have 4.26 as one of the first numbers, option A. But I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

Wait another thing: When you dilute 20 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid with 20 cm³ of water, the concentration becomes 0.025 M, as I thought earlier. So the initial solution is 0.025 M CH3COOH.

At 25% titration, 25% of that solution has been neutralized. So, for each 4 moles of CH3COOH, 1 mole is neutralized (since it's 25%). So the ratio [A^-]/[HA] is (1)/(3), which in the Henderson equation gives log (1/3) = -0.477. So pH = 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263, so about 4.26. So for the first part, it's around 4.26.

Now, what about the equivalence point? At equivalence, all the acetic acid has been neutralized to acetate ion. So the solution will contain only the conjugate base, CH3COO^- . But since it's a weak base, it will hydrolyze in water to produce OH- ions, making the solution basic.

The concentration of acetate ions at equivalence can be calculated. The equivalence point is when moles of NaOH added equals moles of CH3COOH initially. So, the moles of acetate ion will be 0.001 moles.

The total volume is the initial solution (40 cm³) plus the volume of NaOH added (10 cm³), so 50 cm³ or 0.05 L.

So concentration of acetate: 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Now, the acetate ion (CH3COO^-) will react with water:

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb for this reaction is Kw / Ka. Ka is 1.85e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 ≈ 5.405e-10.

The concentration of OH^- can be found using the Kb expression:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the [OH^-], and the initial concentration is 0.02 M, which is much larger than x (since Kb is very small), we can approximate:

Kb ≈ x^2 / 0.02.

So x^2 = Kb * 0.02 = (5.405e-10) * 0.02 = 1.081e-11.

x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ 1.04e-5 M. Then, pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98. So pH = 14 - 4.98 ≈ 9.02.

Wait, but none of the options have 9.02 as equivalence point. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, the initial moles of acetic acid were 0.001. At equivalence, all of that is converted to acetate, so moles of acetate are 0.001. The volume is 40 cm³ (diluted) plus 10 cm³ (NaOH) = 50 cm³. So concentration is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me recalculate Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa ≈ 4.74. So Kb = Kw / Ka = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) → let's compute that.

1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405 * 1e-9 = 5.405e-10. So that part was correct.

So Kb = 5.405e-10.

So the expression is Kb = x² / (0.02 - x). Since x is very small, we can approximate 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

x² = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → log(1.04) is about 0.017, so log(1.04e-5) is -5 + 0.017 → so 4.983. So pOH ≈ 4.98 → pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

But looking at the options, none of the equivalence points are around 9. So perhaps I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the volume.

Wait, wait. Another approach: perhaps I messed up the dilution steps. Let me double-check.

Original volume of acetic acid: 20 cm³ (0.02 L) at 0.05 M → moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles. Then, adding 20 cm³ of water (dilution), so total volume is 40 cm³ (0.04 L). So the diluted concentration is 0.001 / 0.04 = 0.025 M. That's correct.

At equivalence point, all 0.001 moles are neutralized. The NaOH needed is 0.001 moles. Since NaOH is 0.1 M, volume = 0.001 / 0.1 = 0.01 L = 10 cm³. So total volume after adding NaOH is 40 + 10 = 50 cm³ → 0.05 L.

Concentration of acetate is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. So the earlier calculation seems correct, leading to pH ≈9.02. But none of the options have equivalence pH around 9.

Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Options for equivalence point:

A) 4.26; 8.52 → second number is 8.52.

B) 3.17; 6.73 → 6.73.

C)4.73;7.00 → 7.00.

D)4.57;6.92 → 6.92.

Wait, but none of these are around 9. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the equivalence point calculation is wrong because I forgot that when NaOH is added, the solution becomes a buffer, but wait no, the equivalence point is when all the acid is neutralized, so it's a solution of the conjugate base.

Wait another thought: perhaps the volume used in the calculation for the equivalence point was wrong. Let me see. The initial diluted solution is 40 cm³, and equivalence requires adding 10 cm³ of NaOH. So total volume is 50 cm³. So [CH3COO^-] is 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M.

Wait, but maybe I should not have added the initial 40 and the 10. Or wait, no, because the solution after adding 10 cm³ of NaOH is 50 cm³ total.

Hmm, but why are the options not matching. Let me think another way.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Kb. Let me recalculate.

Ka = 1.85e-5 → pKa is about 4.74. So Kb = 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) = (1 / 1.85) * 1e-9 ≈ 0.5405e-9 = 5.405e-10.

Yes, that's correct.

So back to the calculation. [CH3COO^-] =0.02 M.

The reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

The Kb expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

Assuming x is the concentration of OH^- produced. Then,

[CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02.

[OH^-] = x.

So,

Kb ≈ x² / 0.02 → x² = Kb * 0.02 = 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x = sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5 M.

So [OH^-] = 1.04e-5 → pOH = -log(1.04e-5) ≈ 4.98 → pH = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.

But none of the options have 9.02. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the dilution.

Wait, another approach: Let me calculate the pH at equivalence point using another method. Alternatively, perhaps the solution isn't just the conjugate base but maybe I forgot that some of the acetate comes from the NaOH and the solution's volume is correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the equivalence point isn't a strong base solution. Wait, no, NaOH is a strong base, so it's neutralizing the weak acid completely, forming the conjugate base.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles of acetic acid. Let me double-check.

Original volume: 20 cm³ (0.02 L) of 0.05 M acetic acid.

Moles = 0.05 * 0.02 = 0.001 moles → correct.

Diluted to 40 cm³ → concentration 0.025 M → correct.

At equivalence point, all 0.001 moles are converted to acetate. Volume is 50 cm³ → 0.05 L.

Concentration = 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M → correct.

So the calculation of the pH at equivalence point comes to about 9.02, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution after equivalence is a buffer again, but no, equivalence is when all the acetic acid is neutralized. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Henderson equation for the 25% titration. Let me check that again.

At 25% titration: 25% of the moles have been neutralized. So moles of CH3COOH = 0.75 * 0.001 = 0.00075 moles. Moles of acetate = 0.25 * 0.001 = 0.00025 moles.

Total volume is 40 + 2.5 = 42.5 cm³ → 0.0425 L.

So [CH3COOH] = 0.00075 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.01765 M.

[acetate] = 0.00025 / 0.0425 ≈ 0.005882 M.

So ratio [A^-]/[HA] = 0.005882 / 0.01765 ≈ 0.3333.

Henderson equation: pH = pKa + log( (0.3333) ) → pKa is 4.74, log(1/3) is about -0.477. So 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.263.

So that part is correct. So the first pH is around 4.26.

Now, looking again at the options, option A is 4.26 and 8.52 for equivalence. But my calculation gave equivalence point around 9.02, which is not an option.

Wait, maybe I messed up the calculation of Kb again. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for pH at equivalence point differently.

Wait, another approach: Maybe using the hydrolysis reaction and the exact expression.

The acetate ion concentration is 0.02 M.

The reaction is: CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The Kb is 5.405e-10.

So,

Kb = (x)(x) / (0.02 - x) → x² = Kb (0.02 - x).

Assuming x is small compared to 0.02, then x² ≈ Kb * 0.02 → x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → same as before, about 1.04e-5 M. So [OH^-] is 1.04e-5 → pOH ≈4.98 → pH≈9.02.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the initial dilution step. Let me check again. The initial acetic acid is 20 cm³ of 0.05 M, so 0.001 moles. Adding 20 cm³ of water → 40 cm³ total. So 0.025 M. That's correct.

At equivalence, adding 10 cm³ of 0.1 M NaOH. Moles of NaOH = 0.1 * 0.01 = 0.001 moles, which neutralizes the 0.001 moles of acetic acid. So the moles of acetate are 0.001.

Total volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³. So [acetate] is 0.001 / 0.05 = 0.02 M. Correct.

So why the options don't have equivalence pH around 9? Let me look at the options again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the acetate ion concentration. Or maybe I should consider that the solution is not just acetate but some other factor, like activity coefficients? No, that's probably beyond the scope.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is not in calculation but in the initial approach. Another way to approach the equivalence point is using the formula for the pH of a salt solution of a weak acid.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution at equivalence is a solution of sodium acetate, which dissociates into Na+ and CH3COO^-.

The sodium ions are spectator ions, so they don't affect pH. The acetate ions hydrolyze in water as I did earlier. So the pH calculation should be correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there any chance that the question is asking for the pH at 25% of the initial volume, not 25% of the equivalence? No, the question says 25% titration, which is 25% of the way to equivalence.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different way to calculate the pH at equivalence, such as using the initial concentration.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate moles more accurately. Let's compute more precisely.

At equivalence, moles of NaOH added is 0.001 moles. So, the acetate ion is 0.001 moles in 50 cm³ → 0.02 M.

So, Kb = 5.405e-10.

So,

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-

Initial: 0.02 M acetate, 0.

Change: -x, +x, +x.

Equilibrium concentrations: [CH3COO^-] = 0.02 - x, [CH3COOH] = x, [OH^-] = x.

So,

Kb = (x^2) / (0.02 - x) → since x is small, 0.02 - x ≈ 0.02 → x ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02) → sqrt(1.081e-11) → 1.04e-5 M.

pOH = -log(1.04e-5) → approximately 4.98 (since 1e-5 is pH 5, and 1.04 is slightly higher, so pOH is about 4.98 → pH = 9.02.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculations.

Wait, oh! Maybe the question is at 25% of the initial volume, but that's not what the question says. The question says 25% titration, which is 25% of the way to equivalence, not 25% of the initial volume.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the calculation for the equivalence point.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the solution at equivalence isn't 0.02 M, but perhaps I should calculate the actual volume more accurately.

Wait, no. The initial volume is 40 cm³, and NaOH added is 10 cm³, so total 50 cm³. Moles are 0.001, so 0.001 / 0.05 L = 0.02 M. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the way I'm calculating Kb. Let me recompute Kb.

Ka = 1.85e-5, so pKa = 4.74.

Kb = Kw / Ka → 1e-14 / 1.85e-5 = (1e-14) / (1.85e-5) → 5.405e-10.

That's correct.

So, the pH at equivalence is about 9.02. Wait, but I don't see that in the options. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option D says pH is 4.57 at 25% and 6.92 at equivalence. Hmm. How can that be? 6.92 would imply that at equivalence, it's a weak acid solution. But that's not possible because at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized, so the solution should be basic.

Unless there's a mistake and the solution is not at equivalence, but perhaps I have the wrong approach.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Henderson equation at equivalence, but that's only when some of the acid remains. At equivalence, the solution is a buffer only if the stoichiometric point is not exact. But in reality, at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized, and the solution is a conjugate base solution.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the solution at equivalence as a solution of sodium acetate, and use the same approach as before.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH at equivalence using the exact quadratic formula, not the approximation.

So,

x² = Kb * (0.02 - x) → x² + Kb x - 2 Kb * 1e-2 = 0.

Wait, plugging in the numbers:

x² = (5.405e-10)(0.02 - x)

x² +5.405e-10 x - (5.405e-10 * 0.02) =0 → x² +5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11 =0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² +4ac) ] / 2a.

a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

Discriminant = (5.405e-10)^2 + 4*1*1.081e-11 → approx (2.92e-19) + (4.324e-11) → 4.324e-11 is much larger, so sqrt ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) ≈ 6.576e-6.

x = [ -5.4e-10 ± 6.576e-6 ] / 2 → take positive root: (6.576e-6 -5.4e-10)/2 ≈ 3.288e-6.

So x ≈ 3.288e-6 M.

pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288) is about 0.517 → so 5.483 → pH = 14 -5.483 =8.517.

Wait, that's about 8.52. So that would match option A's second value of 8.52.

But earlier approximation gave 9.02. So why the discrepancy? Because when we don't neglect x compared to 0.02, the x is about 3.288e-6, which is much smaller than 0.02, so the approximation is still valid. So why does the quadratic solution give a different result?

Wait, no, wait. Let me recheck the quadratic approach.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic equation. Let me compute more accurately.

The equation is x² + (5.405e-10)x - 1.081e-11 = 0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 + 4*1*1.081e-11 ) ] / 2.

Compute the discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2 = (5.405)^2 * 1e-20 = 29.214 * 1e-20 = 2.9214e-19.

4ac =4 *1*(-1.081e-11) → wait, no, c is -1.081e-11, so 4ac is 4*1*(-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11. Hmm, but in the discriminant, it's b² -4ac. Wait, no: the discriminant is b² -4ac, but in this case, since a=1, c= -1.081e-11, so 4ac = 4 *1 * (-1.081e-11) = -4.324e-11. But the discriminant is b² -4ac → (5.405e-10)^2 -4*(1)*(-1.081e-11) → (2.921e-19) + (4.324e-11) → ≈ 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(4.324e-11) = 6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 → [ (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10) ] / 2 → approximately 6.576e-6 / 2 = 3.288e-6.

So [OH^-] = 3.288e-6 M → pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288) is about 0.517 → so pOH is ~5.483 → pH = 14 -5.483 =8.517 → ~8.52.

Wait, that's a very different result than before. So earlier when I used the approximation, I got x=1.04e-5, but with the quadratic, I get x=3.288e-6. That's a big difference. Hmm. Why?

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic approach. Let me double-check. The equation was x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11 = 0.

Wait, wait, when I plugged into the quadratic formula, perhaps I missed a negative sign. Wait, in the standard ax² +bx +c=0, the quadratic solution is (-b ± sqrt(b²-4ac))/(2a).

In this case, a=1, b=5.405e-10, c= -1.081e-11.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 ) ] / 2.

Wait, the term under the square root is (b² -4ac). Since c is negative, -4ac becomes positive.

So,

sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*(1.081e-11) ) → sqrt(2.921e-19 +4.324e-11) → sqrt(4.324e-11 + 2.921e-19) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) → approx 6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (6.576e-6 - 5.405e-10) → approx 6.576e-6.

Divide by 2: 3.288e-6 M.

So [OH^-] is 3.288e-6 → pOH = log(3.288e-6) → wait, no: pOH = -log(3.288e-6) → log(3.288)=0.517, so 5.483 → pH=8.517.

Wait, that's about 8.52. So the pH at equivalence is 8.52, which matches option A's second value of 8.52.

But earlier when I used the approximation, I thought x was 1.04e-5, which would give pH around 9.02. So what's the issue here? Oh, I think I must have mixed up the Kb value earlier.

Wait, when I used the approximation, I used x^2 = Kb * 0.02 → 5.405e-10 *0.02 =1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11) ≈ 1.04e-5.

But with the quadratic, I get x=3.288e-6.

Wait, that can't be right. There must be a mistake in the calculation. Wait, 3.288e-6 squared is about 1.081e-11, which is correct because x^2 is 1.081e-11.

Wait, no: (3.288e-6)^2 = (3.288)^2 x 1e-12 → 10.81 x 1e-12 → 1.081e-11. So yes, correct.

So why the discrepancy? Because when I did the approximation, I assumed x is much smaller than 0.02, but in reality, x is 3.288e-6, which is much smaller than 0.02 (which is 2e-2). So the approximation should hold, and x is 1.04e-5.

Wait, but according to the quadratic solution, x is 3.288e-6. Which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb value. Let me recompute Kb.

Ka =1.85e-5 → pKa=4.74 → Kb=1e-14/1.85e-5=5.405e-10.

That's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for Kb. Let's see: the correct expression is:

Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-]

At equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] =0.02 - x ≈0.02.

But according to the quadratic solution, x is 3.288e-6, which is about 0.000016% of 0.02. So the approximation holds.

Wait, but earlier when I calculated x using the approximation, I got x=1.04e-5. However, according to the quadratic solution, x=3.288e-6. So which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me compute x^2= Kb * 0.02 → 5.405e-10 * 0.02 = 1.081e-11 → x= sqrt(1.081e-11)= approx 1.04e-5.

Wait, but that contradicts the quadratic approach. I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic setup. Let me re-express the equation.

The correct equation is:

x² = Kb * (0.02 - x)

So,

x² + Kb x - Kb * 0.02 =0 → x² + (5.405e-10)x - (5.405e-10 * 0.02) =0 → x² +5.405e-10 x - 1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula:

x = [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 ) ] / 2.

The square root term is sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1.081e-11 ) → sqrt(2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 ) → sqrt(4.324e-11 + 2.921e-19) ≈ sqrt(4.324e-11) → 6.576e-6.

So,

x = [ -5.405e-10 + 6.576e-6 ] / 2 → approximately (6.576e-6) /2 → 3.288e-6.

But according to the approximation, x is 1.04e-5.

This suggests that the quadratic solution gives a different result, but that can't be right because when x is small, the approximation should hold.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic approach. Let me compute (5.405e-10)^2 → (5.405)^2 is about 29.214 → 29.214e-20 = 2.9214e-19.

Adding 4*1*1.081e-11 → 4.324e-11.

So the sum is (2.9214e-19 +4.324e-11) ≈ 4.324e-11.

So sqrt(4.324e-11) → 6.576e-6.

So x is approximately (6.576e-6)/2 → 3.288e-6.

Wait, but wait, why is this x so much smaller than the approximation? Because if x is 3.288e-6, then (x^2) is (3.288e-6)^2 = 1.081e-11, which matches Kb *0.02 → yes.

Wait, so when I use the approximation, I get x=1.04e-5, but with the exact solution, x is about 3.288e-6, which is about a third of the approximation. So why is this discrepancy?

Ah, I think I see the mistake. Earlier, I thought x²=1.081e-11, so x= sqrt(1.081e-11)≈1.04e-5. But according to the exact solution, x should be 3.288e-6, which is about 3.16 times smaller. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation.

Wait, perhaps I confused between Kb and Ka. Let me make sure: Kb is 5.405e-10.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I set up the Kb expression.

Another approach: perhaps the correct way is to calculate the pH at equivalence using the formula for a weak base. The formula for pH when you have a solution of a weak base is:

pH = ½ (pKb - log C )

Wait, wait, no, that's for a weak acid when you have a solution where concentration is C. Alternatively, for a weak base, the pH can be found using:

pOH = ½ (pKb - log C ), but I'm not sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps for a weak base, the pH can be approximated using:

[OH^-] ≈ sqrt( Kb * C )

But in this case, Kb is 5.405e-10 and C is 0.02 M.

So [OH^-] ≈ sqrt(5.405e-10 * 0.02 ) → sqrt(1.081e-11) → 1.04e-5 M → pOH≈4.98 → pH≈9.02.

But according to the exact solution, it's 3.288e-6 → pOH=5.483 → pH=8.517.

Wait, this is very confusing. There must be a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the solution at equivalence isn't just the conjugate base. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the solution is a buffer solution, but that's only if some of the acid remains. No, at equivalence, all the acid is neutralized.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial moles. Let me recount.

Initial moles of acetic acid: 0.05 M * 0.02 L = 0.001 moles.

At equivalence, all 0.001 moles are neutralized, so moles of acetate is 0.001.

Volume is 40 +10 =50 cm³ →0.05 L → concentration 0.02 M.

So, Kb=5.405e-10.

So,

CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

The correct expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-].

At initial, [CH3COO^-] =0.02 M, [CH3COOH]=0, [OH^-]=0.

At equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] =0.02 - x, [CH3COOH]=x, [OH^-]=x.

So,

Kb = x² / (0.02 - x) → x² = Kb*(0.02 -x).

Assuming x is small, 0.02 -x ≈ 0.02 → x≈ sqrt( Kb *0.02 ) → sqrt(5.405e-10 *0.02 )=sqrt(1.081e-11)=1.04e-5.

But according to the quadratic, x is 3.288e-6.

So, which is correct? There must be a mistake in either the setup or the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should use the exact solution without approximation.

Let me compute:

x² = Kb*(0.02 -x) → x² =5.405e-10*(0.02 -x).

Rearranging:

x² +5.405e-10 x - (5.405e-10 *0.02)=0 → x² +5.405e-10 x -1.081e-11=0.

Using quadratic formula, x= [ -5.405e-10 ± sqrt( (5.405e-10)^2 +4*1*1.081e-11 ) ] / 2.

Compute the discriminant:

(5.405e-10)^2 = 2.921e-19.

4*1*1.081e-11 =4.324e-11.

Sum: 2.921e-19 +4.324e-11 ≈4.324e-11.

sqrt(4.324e-11)=6.576e-6.

So,

x= [ -5.405e-10 +6.576e-6 ] / 2 → (6.576e-6 -5.405e-10)/2 → approximately 6.576e-6 /2=3.288e-6.

So x=3.288e-6 M.

Which gives [OH^-]=3.288e-6 → pOH=5.483 → pH=8.517.

Ah, so my earlier approximation was incorrect because I assumed x is negligible compared to 0.02, which it is, but the quadratic approach gives a more accurate value, which is lower than the approximation.

So the correct pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52, which matches option A's second value.

Wait, but earlier when I used the approximation, I thought x=1.04e-5 → pH=9.02, but the exact solution gives x=3.288e-6 → pH=8.52.

So this suggests that the pH at equivalence is approximately 8.52, which matches option A.

Now, looking at the options again:

Option A: 4.26; 8.52.

Option D:4.57;6.92.

So, the first part (25% titration) is 4.26, and equivalence is 8.52. So the correct option would be A.

But wait, earlier when I computed the first part, I found pH=4.26, which matches option A.

So the correct answer would be option A.


To solve the problem, we analyze the titration of 20.00 cm³ of 0.05 M acetic acid (diluted with 20.00 cm³ of water) with 0.1 M NaOH. The goal is to determine the pH at 25% titration and at the equivalence point.

---

### **Step 1: Initial Setup and Dilution**
- **Initial moles of acetic acid**:  
  \[
  \text{Moles of acetic acid} = 0.05 \, \text{M} \times 0.02 \, \text{L} = 0.001 \, \text{moles}.
  \]
- After dilution with 20.00 cm³ of water, the total volume is 40.00 cm³ (0.04 L).  
  \[
  \text{New concentration of acetic acid} = \frac{0.001 \, \text{moles}}{0.04 \, \text{L}} = 0.025 \, \text{M}.
  \]

---

### **Step 2: pH at 25% Titration**
At 25% titration, 25% of the acetic acid has been neutralized by NaOH.  
- **Moles of acetic acid remaining**:  
  \[
  0.75 \times 0.001 = 0.00075 \, \text{moles}.
  \]
- **Moles of acetate ion formed**:  
  \[
  0.25 \times 0.001 = 0.00025 \, \text{moles}.
  \]
- **Total volume after adding NaOH**:  
  \[
  40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 2.5 \, \text{cm}^3 = 42.50 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.0425 \, \text{L}.
  \]
- **Concentrations**:  
  \[
  [\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = \frac{0.00075}{0.0425} \approx 0.01765 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.00025}{0.0425} \approx 0.00588 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:  
  \[
  \text{pH} = \text{p}K_a + \log \left( \frac{[\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} \right),
  \]
  where \( K_a = 1.85 \times 10^{-5} \), so \( \text{p}K_a \approx 4.74 \).  
  \[
  \text{pH} = 4.74 + \log \left( \frac{0.00588}{0.01765} \right) = 4.74 + \log(0.333) \approx 4.74 - 0.477 = 4.26.
  \]

---

### **Step 3: pH at Equivalence Point**
At the equivalence point, all the acetic acid has been neutralized, forming 0.001 moles of acetate ion.  
- **Total volume**:  
  \[
  40.00 \, \text{cm}^3 + 10.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 50.00 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.05 \, \text{L}.
  \]
- **Concentration of acetate ion**:  
  \[
  [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = \frac{0.001}{0.05} = 0.02 \, \text{M}.
  \]
- The acetate ion hydrolyzes in water:  
  \[
  \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-.
  \]
  The equilibrium constant for this reaction is \( K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.85 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.41 \times 10^{-10} \).
- Let \( [\text{OH}^-] = x \). Using the expression for \( K_b \):  
  \[
  K_b = \frac{x^2}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] - x}.
  \]
  Since \( x \) is small compared to 0.02, approximate \( [\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] \approx 0.02 \):  
  \[
  x^2 = K_b \cdot 0.02 = (5.41 \times 10^{-10}) \cdot 0.02 = 1.082 \times 10^{-11}.
  \]
  \[
  x = \sqrt{1.082 \times 10^{-11}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
  \]
  \[
  \text{pOH} = -\log(1.04 \times 10^{-5}) \approx 4.98, \quad \text{pH} = 14 - 4.98 = 9.02.
  \]
  However, using the quadratic solution for \( x \) gives a slightly lower value:  
  \[
  x \approx 3.288 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}, \quad \text{pOH} \approx 5.48, \quad \text{pH} \approx 8.52.
  \]
