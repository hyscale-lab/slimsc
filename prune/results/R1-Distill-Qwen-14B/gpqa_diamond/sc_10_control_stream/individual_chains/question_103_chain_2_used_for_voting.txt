Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options give different sequences of reactions, and I need to figure out which one is the correct high-yield pathway. Hmm.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule. The structure is a phenyl ring with substituents. Let's see: ethan-1-one means the ketone group (C=O) is attached to a methyl group, but in this case, it's attached to the benzene ring. So, the structure is a benzene ring with a ketone group (which is like a carbonyl attached to a methyl group) at position 1. Additionally, there's a bromine at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5. Wait, numbering the benzene ring: if the ketone is at position 1, then the substituents would be at 3 and 5. So, the ring has three substituents: COCH3 (from ethan-1-one), Br, and NO2.

Now, I need to plan the synthesis steps. Starting from benzene, I have to introduce these substituents in the right order, considering the directing effects of each group.

Let me recall: Benzene can undergo electrophilic substitution. The substituents will direct incoming groups to certain positions based on their nature. Nitro groups are meta directors, bromine (if in the ring) is ortho/para, but if a substituent is a leaving group, like a nitro group, that's different.

Wait, but the target has a nitro group and a bromine. Let me think about the sequence.

I know that nitration is a common reaction. Nitration introduces a nitro group, which is a strong meta-directing group. Then, bromination would happen, but where? If the nitro group is already in the ring, the next substitution would be directed by that.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is to introduce the nitro group first, then bromine, then the ketone.

Wait, but the ketone is a meta director as well? Or is it that the ketone is an electron-withdrawing group, which is a meta director.

Wait, the ketone (like in acetophenone) is a meta director. So, in the target molecule, the ketone is in a position that's influenced by the existing substituents.

Wait, perhaps the strategy is to introduce substituents in a way that each new group goes into the correct position relative to the others.

So, let's think about the target molecule: positions 1 (the ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So, the substituents are in the 1,3,5 positions. Oh wait, that's a symmetric arrangement of three substituents. So, the ring has three substituents at 1,3,5 positions. So, all meta to each other.

Wait, but wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So, numbering from the ketone as position 1, then moving clockwise, position 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, the nitro is at 5 (which is two positions away from 3 if moving clockwise), and Br at 3. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis needs to be done in a way that each substituent is added in the correct position.

Let me think about the possible steps. Since nitro is a meta director, any group added after nitro would go to the meta position relative to it. But wait, benzene is symmetric, so perhaps the order of adding groups is important.

Let me consider the steps in each option.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (so Friedel-Crafts acylation, adding a ketone group). Then bromine with FeBr3, then HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), HNO3 again, then NaNO2/HCl (maybe diazotization), H3PO2.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. Benzene itself is not very reactive, but Friedel-Crafts will introduce the ketone. However, if we start by adding a ketone, which is a meta director, then any subsequent substitution will go meta to that. So, if I add the ketone first, then nitrate, the nitro group would go meta to the ketone, which would be position 3 or 5. Wait, but then after that, adding bromine would have to go to the correct position.

Wait, maybe let's go through the steps of Option A:

i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetophenone. So, benzene becomes Ph-C(O)-CH3. The ketone is at position 1.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. The ketone directs incoming Br to meta, so Br would be at position 3 or 5. Wait, it's meta to the ketone. So, acetophenone's substituent is at position 1, so bromine could go to position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, the ring has ketone (1) and Br (3). The ketone is a meta director, Br is ortho/para. So, the next nitration would be directed by the ketone and Br. Wait, but which group is more activating and thus more directing?

The ketone is a meta director, whereas Br is ortho/para. But the nitro group is a strong meta director. Wait, but in this step, we're adding nitro. So, where would the nitro group go?

Wait, in step iii, the substituents are the ketone (1, meta director) and Br (3, ortho/para). The incoming nitro group is a strong electrophile. The directing effect is influenced by the strongest activating group. But both ketone and Br are deactivating. Wait, no, wait: the ketone is deactivating (electron-withdrawing), and bromine is deactivating (but ortho/para-directing due to being an electron-withdrawing group via resonance, but actually, wait, bromine is an ortho/para director because it's a halogen. It's a weak deactivating group because of its electron-withdrawing inductive effect, but its resonance can donate electrons, making it a weaker deactivator than nitro groups.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the nitration is directed by the ketone. So, the ketone is at position 1, so the nitro would go to position 3 or 5. But position 3 already has Br, so it would go to position 5. So after step iii, the ring has ketone (1), Br (3), and NO2 (5). That's exactly the target molecule. Wait, but then what's the rest of the steps?

Option A continues: iv) Fe/HCl. Hmm, Fe/HCl is a reducing agent. Maybe it's used for something like reduction of nitro groups to NH2? But in this case, we have a nitro group that is in the correct position. So why would we reduce it?

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think again. After step iii, the target is achieved. But why would there be more steps? So the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, perhaps the steps after that are doing something else. So, perhaps option A's steps are incorrect because after step iii, the product is already the target, and then the rest of the steps would mess it up.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Wait, let me check what each reagent does:

i) CH3COCl and AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation: adds a ketone group.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination in the meta position relative to the ketone.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration in the meta position. Wait, but if the ketone is at 1, and Br is at 3, the next nitro group would go to 5 (meta to ketone), which is correct. So after step iii, the molecule is the target. So, why do further steps?

Looking at option A: iv) Fe/HCl → maybe that's a reduction. So, perhaps Fe/HCl is used to reduce something else. Maybe the nitro group is reduced to an amine, but that's not desired.

Hmm, but the target has a nitro group. So perhaps steps iv and beyond in option A are not necessary or even harmful. So maybe option A isn't the correct pathway.

Moving on to Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → introduce Br into benzene. Since benzene is activated, but wait, benzene requires a catalyst for bromination. So initial bromination would give bromobenzene, with Br at position 1.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, the ring has Br (ortho/para director). So the nitro group would go to para or ortho. If nitration occurs in para to Br, that would be position 4. But in the target, the nitro is at 5, which is meta relative to the ketone. Hmm, not sure.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. Benzene is not very reactive, but if we have Br and nitro groups, which are deactivating, the ring is deactivated towards Friedel-Crafts. So, this step might not work because the ring is deactivated. So, Option B might not be feasible because after steps i and ii, the ring is heavily deactivated, making Friedel-Crafts impossible.

So, Option B is likely incorrect.

Option C:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene. Nitro group is strong meta director.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro group to amine? Wait, Fe and HCl is not a common reduction condition. Nitro groups are usually reduced with H2/Pd or Sn/HCl. Wait, but Fe/HCl might not do much.

Alternatively, perhaps step ii is nitration again? No, because it's Fe/HCl. Alternatively, maybe it's a catalyst for something else.

Wait, step iii is CH3COCl/AlCl3. So Friedel-Crafts. But after nitration, the ring is deactivated. So can Friedel-Crafts proceed? Because nitro is a strong deactivating group, making the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So, Friedel-Crafts might not work. So Option C might not be viable.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Benzene gets a nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction of nitro to amine. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, Fe in HCl is maybe for something else. Oh, wait, sometimes Fe/HCl is used for generating Cl- in solution, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a step to form diazonium salt, but that would require a nitrous acid condition, which is NaNO2 and HCl. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about Option D's steps:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine? But nitrobenzene is typically reduced with H2/Pt or Sn/HCl. Fe/HCl might not be the right condition. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and it's H2S or something else.

Wait, perhaps step ii is a substitution. Alternatively, maybe this is a typo and it's a different reagent.

But moving on, step iii is NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. That would require an amine. But if step ii is a reduction of nitro to amine, then step iii would generate a diazonium salt.

Then step iv is H3PO2 → which is a reducing agent, maybe for something else. Alternatively, H3PO2 is used in the Sandmeyer reaction to introduce halogens.

Wait, if we have a diazonium salt (from step iii), then treating with H3PO2 would lead to displacement, perhaps introducing a bromine or iodine. But I'm not very sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in D are:

i) Nitration,

ii) Reduction,

iii) Diazotization,

iv) something,

v) Br2,

vi) acylation.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to outline the steps:

Option D:

i) Nitration → nitro group at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine, giving aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the amine (but aniline is difficult to diazotize; it requires low temperatures, typically 0-5°C, and strong acid).

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps decompose the diazonium salt to form a halogen? Wait, but H3PO2 is a reducing agent. Oh, wait, the Sandmeyer reaction uses CuCN or CuCl to introduce cyanide or chloride. But H3PO2 is used in the Gattermann–Koch reaction to reduce carbonyl groups.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up reactions. Alternatively, perhaps H3PO2 is used in another context.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me think again about the target molecule.

The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, positions 1: ketone, 3: Br, 5: nitro.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the ketone is at position 1, Br at 3 (meta to ketone), and nitro at 5 (meta to Br or something else? Wait, no. If the ketone is at 1, then the nitro is at 5, which is two positions away, which is meta. So, maybe the nitro and Br are both meta to the ketone.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to introduce the nitro group first, then the bromine, and then the ketone. Because if the nitro is a meta director, adding the bromine would be in a position directed by the nitro, but wait, no—because the nitro is a meta director, but adding the bromine after nitration would go to the meta position relative to the nitro. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. First, nitrate benzene → nitro group at position 1.

2. Then, brominate → Br would go to position 3 (meta to nitro).

3. Then, introduce the ketone. But wait, the ring already has nitro and Br. Are they activating or deactivating?

Nitro is a strong deactivating group (meta), bromine is deactivating but ortho/para. So, the ring is deactivating, making Friedel-Crafts difficult. So, perhaps that's a problem.

Unless, we can activate the ring again with some substituent. But I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced via a different route.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ketone is introduced via a methyl group that is then oxidized. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation, but only after activating groups have been introduced. But nitro and Br are deactivating, which would make the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution.

So, maybe the acylation step must come before the nitration and bromination steps.

Wait, let me think of the correct order. Let's say:

1. Acylation of benzene → acetophenone.

2. Nitration → adds nitro group meta to the ketone.

3. Bromination → adds Br meta to the ketone, but considering nitro group's influence.

Wait, but in acetophenone, the ketone directs incoming substituents to the meta positions. So, after ketone is added, nitration would occur at position 3 or 5 (meta to ketone). Let's say position 5.

Then bromination would occur, but where? The ring now has ketone (1) and nitro (5). The nitro group is a strong meta director. So, bromine would likely go to position 3 (meta to nitro), but also considering the ketone's directing.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to imagine.

After step i: acetophenone (1).

Step ii: nitration adds nitro at position 5 (meta to ketone).

Now, the ring has substituents at 1 and 5. Next, bromination.

The ring has two substituents: ketone (1, meta director) and nitro (5, meta director). So where would Br go?

The ketone directs meta, so from position 1, meta would be positions 3 and 5. But 5 is already occupied by nitro. So, Br would go to position 3, which is meta to ketone and para to nitro.

Wait, that would give Br at 3, nitro at 5. So, the ring would have substituents at 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (nitro). That's exactly the target molecule.

So, the steps would be: acylation (Friedel-Crafts), nitration, then bromination.

But looking at the options, let's see which option has this sequence.

Option A: Steps i, ii, iii are acylation, bromination, nitration. So, after step i: ketone. Step ii: Br adds to position 3. Then step iii: nitration. Where would nitration go?

Wait, after acylation and bromination, the ring has ketone (1) and Br (3). Now, nitration would be directed by both. The ketone is a meta director, and Br is ortho/para.

So, the incoming nitro group would be influenced by these. The position available would be position 5 (meta to ketone, para to Br). So, nitration would go to position 5.

So, after these three steps, the target is achieved. But Option A has more steps after that.

Wait, but in Option A, after step iii (nitration), steps iv and beyond are: iv) Fe/HCl; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Hmm, why would they do that? Because the target has all three substituents already after step iii. So, the rest of the steps are unnecessary and might even change the structure. For example, step iv with Fe/HCl might reduce the nitro group, which is not desired. So, perhaps Option A is not correct because the remaining steps would alter the desired product.

Looking back, perhaps the correct sequence is acylation, bromination, nitration. But in the options, only Option A starts with acylation, then bromination, then nitration. So, after step iii, the target is achieved. So, why are there more steps?

Is there a possibility that the target is formed after step iii, but the subsequent steps in Option A are not part of the reaction? Or perhaps some other reasoning.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the nitration in step iii doesn't go into the correct position because the ring is already deactivated. Wait, no, the ring has a ketone and Br, which are deactivating. So, nitration would be difficult in such a case. But if the ring still can undergo nitration, then it would go to position 5.

Alternatively, maybe I'm not considering that each step's directing effects properly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is nitration first, then acylation, but that's difficult because nitro is a meta director, and then acylation would require an activating group, which nitro isn't.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the correct steps are: nitration, then bromination, then acylation.

But that would require the ring to have nitro and Br, then Friedel-Crafts. But Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups, which nitro and Br aren't. So, perhaps that's not feasible.

Wait, perhaps the bromine is added after the acylation. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible intermediates in each option.

Looking again at Option C:

i) Nitration → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction? But nitro to amine would require something like Sn/HCl. Fe/HCl might not do that.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → adding ketone. But nitro is a deactivating group, so Friedel-Crafts may not proceed.

So, probably, Option C isn't the right path because Friedel-Crafts won't work after nitration.

Option D:

i) Nitration → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps a substitution reaction? For example, generating a bromide via diazonium salt decomposition.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

vi) Friedel-Crafts acylation.

vii) Nitration again.

Wait, but this seems complicated. Let's see the steps:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Diazotize → diazonium chloride.

4. Treat with H3PO2 → what happens? Maybe the diazonium salt decomposes to give something else. Alternatively, H3PO2 is a mild reducing agent. Maybe it's used in the Gattermann–Koch reaction, but that's for formylation.

Alternatively, perhaps steps iii and iv are for introducing a bromide. Wait, if you have a diazonium salt and treat with H3PO2, maybe it's a way to substitute the amino group with something else. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are intended to introduce Br. Let's see: If after nitration and reduction, you have aniline, then diazotization gives a diazonium salt. Then, maybe treating with H3PO2 (which is a reducing agent) would decompose the diazonium salt to produce a bromine? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the steps are for introducing a bromine via a substitution.

But this is getting too unclear. I'm probably getting stuck trying to figure out each step in all options, which is time-consuming.

Let me think again about which option correctly adds the substituents in the right order.

The target has nitro, Br, and ketone at positions 1, 3, and 5. So, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Introduce the nitro group first, then the Br, then the ketone. But nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't work.

Alternative approach: Introduce the nitro group and Br first, then find a way to add the ketone. But again, with deactivating groups, Friedel-Crafts is unlikely.

Wait, maybe the ketone is introduced via a different method, such as the oxidation of a methyl group. But how would the methyl group get there?

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced via a Gattermann–Koch reaction, which adds a formyl group. Then, it can be oxidized to a ketone. But that's a more complicated route and I'm not sure if it's part of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires strong activating groups, which are not present here.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to introduce the ketone first, then nitro, then Br. But as I thought earlier, after the ketone, nitro would go to 5, then Br to 3.

But then, why would some options have more steps? Because in the target, the nitro is at 5. So, maybe the correct sequence is acylation, nitration, bromination.

Wait, but in that case, after acylation and nitration, you have nitro at 5. Then bromination would add Br at 3, which is meta to ketone and para to nitro. So, yes, that would give the target.

But then, looking at the options, which option has acylation first, then nitration, then bromination.

Looking again:

Option A: i) acylation; ii) bromination; iii) nitration.

So, after step iii, the target is achieved. But the option has more steps after that. Why?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when you nitrate after bromination, the positions are directed differently.

Wait, let me think again. After acylation, the ring has the ketone at 1. Then, step ii is bromination with FeBr3. So, the ketone directs Br to position 3. Now, the ring has ketone at 1, Br at 3.

Then, step iii is nitration. The ring now has two substituents: ketone (1, meta director) and Br (3, ortho/para director). So, where would nitration occur?

The nitration is directed by both substituents. The ketone wants the nitro to go meta to it, which is positions 3 or 5. But position 3 is already occupied by Br. So, nitro would go to position 5.

So, after these three steps, the target is achieved. So, why does the option have more steps? Because steps iv to vii are additional. So, perhaps that's not the correct sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial steps are wrong because the nitration must occur before bromination. Let me think.

Another angle: perhaps the correct sequence is nitration, then bromination, then acylation. But nitration first: benzene → nitrobenzene. Then bromination: nitro is meta director, so Br would go to position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3. Then, acylation: the ring now has nitro (1) and Br (3). Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups, but nitro and Br are deactivating. So, acylation won't proceed. So, that's a problem.

Hmm. So, perhaps the only viable way is to introduce the ketone first, then nitro, then bromine. But looking at the options, only Option A has that, but the rest of the steps in A may not be necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is Option A. Because after the initial three steps, the target is made, and the additional steps are either unnecessary or perhaps a typo. But I'm not sure why there are more steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order.

Wait, another approach: The correct order of adding substituents would have the acylation last because the ketone is a meta director, and adding it last would allow the nitro and Br to be in the correct positions.

Wait, let's think again about the target: the ketone is at position 1, Br at 3, and nitro at 5. So, perhaps the nitro is added first, then the Br, then the ketone. But how?

Wait, nitro is added first (position 1). Then, the ring has nitro group, which is meta director. So, the next substituent, Br, would go to position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3. Then, the ring has nitro (1) and Br (3). Now, the ketone has to be introduced. But with both nitro and Br on the ring, Friedel-Crafts won't work because they are deactivating. So that's a problem.

So, that approach won't work.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the Br is added after the ketone and nitro. Let me imagine:

1. Acylation: ketone at 1.

2. Nitration: nitro at 5.

3. Bromination: Br at 3.

Which is exactly what I thought earlier. So, the correct steps are acylation, nitration, bromination.

Looking at the options, which option does that?

Option A: i) acylation; ii) bromination; iii) nitration.

Hmm, that's acylation, then bromination, then nitration. So, the nitration comes third. Which would place nitro at position 5.

Wait, but earlier I thought that after acylation and bromination, nitration would come third, placing nitro at 5.

So, in Option A, after step iii, the target is achieved. So, why are there more steps? Because step iv is Fe/HCl, which is maybe a reduction.

But the target requires a nitro group, so any step that reduces it would be bad. So, perhaps Option A is not correct because the steps after iii would alter the nitro group.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the nitration in step iii may not go to position 5.

Wait, perhaps the ring is already deactivating due to the ketone and Br, making nitration difficult. So, perhaps in Option A, the nitration in step iii doesn't occur efficiently, leading to low yield. So, that's not the high-yield option.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let's think about each option again.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Br is ortho/para director. So, nitro could go to position 2 or 4.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. But with Br and nitro groups, which are deactivating, the ring is not reactive enough. So, Friedel-Crafts may not proceed.

So, this option is probably incorrect.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitration. Nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine.

But Fe/HCl isn't a common reducing agent for nitro groups. Typically, nitro is reduced with H2/Pd or Sn/HCl. So, this step might not work.

iii) CH3COCl → Friedel-Crafts. Again, after nitration, the ring is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts unlikely.

So, Option C is incorrect.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl → not sure, maybe reduce to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → some reaction.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

vi) CH3COCl → Friedel-Crafts.

vii) HNO3 → nitrate again.

This seems convoluted, and I'm not sure about the steps. But let's see:

After step i: nitro at 1.

Step ii: reduce nitro to amine → aniline (position 1).

Step iii: diazotization → diazonium salt.

Step iv: H3PO2 → what's that do? Maybe it's used to reduce the diazonium salt. Diazonium salts can be decomposed to give amines, but in the presence of H3PO2, perhaps it's for coupling or substitution.

Wait, another possibility: H3PO2 is a reducing agent that can reduce certain functional groups. But I'm not certain how it would affect the diazonium salt.

Alternatively, perhaps steps iii and iv are for introducing bromine. If the diazonium salt is decomposed with H3PO2, maybe it substitutes the amino group with a bromine. But I'm not familiar with that exact reaction.

Assuming that after step iv, Br is introduced at position 1. Then step v is Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. But if we already have Br at 1, adding more Br would be difficult, but perhaps in another position.

This seems messy, and I'm not confident it leads to the desired product.

Hmm. So, reviewing all the options, the only one that seems to approach the correct order is Option A. However, the additional steps after the target is achieved in step iii are confusing. Perhaps the correct answer is A, assuming that steps iv to vii are either not needed or perhaps a mistake in the option setup.

Wait, perhaps the target isn't achieved in step iii. Let me think again. After step iii in Option A (nitration), the nitro group would be added. But where?

Wait, let's imagine:

Option A steps:

i) Acylation → ketone at 1.

ii) Bromination → Br at 3.

iii) Nitration → where?

The ring now has ketone (1) and Br (3). The nitro group will be directed by both substituents.

The ketone is a meta director, so the nitro could go to 5 (meta to ketone). But Br is an ortho/para director, so from Br at 3, the nitro could go to 2, 4, or 6. But the ring's substitution is getting complex.

Wait, maybe the nitro group would be directed by the Br. So, para to Br is position 6. Ortho to Br is position 2 and 4.

But the ketone is at position 1. So, if nitro is added para to Br (position 6), but that's adjacent to the ketone. But the ketone is a meta director, so the nitro would be more likely to go meta to the ketone, which is position 5.

So, the nitro would end up at position 5.

Thus, after step iii, the product is the target. So, why are there more steps?

Ah, perhaps the problem is that the bromine and nitro groups are added in such a way that after acylation, bromination, and nitration, there's another reaction needed, but I can't see what it would be.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and the correct order is different.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the nitration should occur before bromination. Let's say, in Option A, nitration is the third step, but the ring's substituents are ketone and Br, and the nitro goes to position 5. So, the product is correct. So, the subsequent steps in Option A are perhaps a mistake, but the first three steps are correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is Option A, assuming that the target is achieved at step iii and the remaining steps are extra but not affecting the product.

Alternatively, maybe some of the steps are for purification or work-up, but that's unlikely.

Hmm. Another approach: the correct sequence would be acylation, nitration, bromination. So, looking at the options, which option has that? Option C has acylation as step iii. Option A has acylation as step i, nitration as step iii, bromination as step ii.

Wait, no. Option A's sequence is acylation, bromination, nitration. So, nitro is added third, which as I thought, gives the correct product.

But the subsequent steps in Option A are then doing something else, which is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps after the target is achieved, the product is treated further, but those steps are not relevant to the synthesis of the target. So, perhaps the correct answer is Option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the reaction steps. For example, perhaps the nitration in step iii doesn't add the nitro group because the ring is deactivating, leading to a lower yield.

But the question asks for the high-yield synthesis. So, which option would have the best directing effects and least competition, allowing each substituent to be added in the correct position.

So, the correct order would be acylation, nitration, bromination. But no option seems to follow that exactly. Let me check the options again.

Looking at Option C:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction to amine.

iii) Acylation → but with nitro, which deactivates the ring, so Friedel-Crafts won't work.

So, Option C is incorrect.

Option D:

Steps are nitration, reduction, diazotization, H3PO2, bromination, acylation, nitration. The sequence seems off, but perhaps the first nitration in D is at position 1, then steps after would add substituents elsewhere.

But I'm not confident. I think the correct order is acylation first, then nitration, then bromination, which is Option A's first three steps. So, perhaps the correct answer is Option A, despite the extra steps.

Alternatively, perhaps Option C's steps are acylation after nitration and reduction, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility that the bromine is introduced via a different method, such as a coupling reaction. But that's beyond the scope of the options given.

After all this, I'm going to conclude that the correct answer is Option A, as it introduces the substituents in the correct order to achieve the target.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the substituents in the right order, considering the directing effects of each group. The target molecule has a ketone group at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5. These substituents are arranged in a symmetric pattern, with the ketone and nitro group being meta-directors, and bromine being an ortho/para-director.

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group at position 1.
2. **ii) Br₂/FeBr₃**: Bromination occurs, with the ketone directing bromine to position 3 (meta to the ketone).
3. **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration introduces the nitro group, which is directed to position 5 (meta to the ketone and para to bromine).
   - At this point, the target molecule is achieved after the first three steps. The remaining steps (iv to vii) are unnecessary and could potentially alter the product, but they do not affect the high-yield synthesis of the target.

#### **Option B**:
1. **i) Br₂/FeBr₃**: Bromination introduces a bromine atom at position 1.
2. **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration introduces a nitro group, which would be directed to position 3 or 5 (ortho/para to bromine). However, the ketone group cannot be introduced later due to the deactivating nature of bromine and nitro groups, making Friedel-Crafts acylation infeasible.
   - This option fails because the ketone cannot be introduced after bromine and nitro groups.

#### **Option C**:
1. **i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration introduces a nitro group at position 1.
2. **ii) Fe/HCl**: This step is unclear but may involve reduction. However, reducing the nitro group to an amine is not consistent with the target molecule.
3. **iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts acylation would fail because the nitro group is a strong deactivator, making the ring unreactive toward electrophilic substitution.
   - This option is not viable due to the inability to introduce the ketone group after nitration.

#### **Option D**:
1. **i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration introduces a nitro group at position 1.
2. **ii) Fe/HCl**: This step is unclear but may involve reduction. However, reducing the nitro group to an amine is not consistent with the target molecule.
3. **iii) NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization requires an amine, which is not present in this sequence.
4. **iv) H₃PO₂**: This step is unclear and does not align with the synthesis of the target molecule.
5. **v) Br₂/FeBr₃**: Bromination would occur, but the sequence of steps is convoluted and does not guarantee the correct placement of substituents.
6. **vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts acylation would fail due to the deactivating nature of the existing substituents.
7. **vii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Additional nitration is unnecessary and could alter the product.
   - This option is overly complex and does not lead to the target molecule efficiently.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions is found in **Option A**, where the ketone is introduced first, followed by bromine and nitro groups in the correct positions. While the additional steps in Option A are not necessary, the first three steps achieve the target molecule in a high-yield manner.

**Answer: A**

Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about synthesizing 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene. The options give different sequences of reactions, and I need to figure out which one is the correct high-yield pathway. Hmm.

First, I should probably draw the target molecule. The structure is a phenyl ring with substituents. Let's see: ethan-1-one means the ketone group (C=O) is attached to a methyl group, but in this case, it's attached to the benzene ring. So, the structure is a benzene ring with a ketone group (which is like a carbonyl attached to a methyl group) at position 1. Additionally, there's a bromine at position 3 and a nitro group at position 5. Wait, numbering the benzene ring: if the ketone is at position 1, then the substituents would be at 3 and 5. So, the ring has three substituents: COCH3 (from ethan-1-one), Br, and NO2.

Now, I need to plan the synthesis steps. Starting from benzene, I have to introduce these substituents in the right order, considering the directing effects of each group.

Let me recall: Benzene can undergo electrophilic substitution. The substituents will direct incoming groups to certain positions based on their nature. Nitro groups are meta directors, bromine (if in the ring) is ortho/para, but if a substituent is a leaving group, like a nitro group, that's different.

Wait, but the target has a nitro group and a bromine. Let me think about the sequence.

I know that nitration is a common reaction. Nitration introduces a nitro group, which is a strong meta-directing group. Then, bromination would happen, but where? If the nitro group is already in the ring, the next substitution would be directed by that.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is to introduce the nitro group first, then bromine, then the ketone.

Wait, but the ketone is a meta director as well? Or is it that the ketone is an electron-withdrawing group, which is a meta director.

Wait, the ketone (like in acetophenone) is a meta director. So, in the target molecule, the ketone is in a position that's influenced by the existing substituents.

Wait, perhaps the strategy is to introduce substituents in a way that each new group goes into the correct position relative to the others.

So, let's think about the target molecule: positions 1 (the ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (NO2). So, the substituents are in the 1,3,5 positions. Oh wait, that's a symmetric arrangement of three substituents. So, the ring has three substituents at 1,3,5 positions. So, all meta to each other.

Wait, but wait, benzene is a six-membered ring. So, numbering from the ketone as position 1, then moving clockwise, position 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. So, the nitro is at 5 (which is two positions away from 3 if moving clockwise), and Br at 3. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the synthesis needs to be done in a way that each substituent is added in the correct position.

Let me think about the possible steps. Since nitro is a meta director, any group added after nitro would go to the meta position relative to it. But wait, benzene is symmetric, so perhaps the order of adding groups is important.

Let me consider the steps in each option.

Option A: i) CH3COCl/AlCl3 (so Friedel-Crafts acylation, adding a ketone group). Then bromine with FeBr3, then HNO3/H2SO4 (nitration), Fe/HCl (maybe reduction?), HNO3 again, then NaNO2/HCl (maybe diazotization), H3PO2.

Wait, but Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. Benzene itself is not very reactive, but Friedel-Crafts will introduce the ketone. However, if we start by adding a ketone, which is a meta director, then any subsequent substitution will go meta to that. So, if I add the ketone first, then nitrate, the nitro group would go meta to the ketone, which would be position 3 or 5. Wait, but then after that, adding bromine would have to go to the correct position.

Wait, maybe let's go through the steps of Option A:

i) Benzene + CH3COCl/AlCl3 → acetophenone. So, benzene becomes Ph-C(O)-CH3. The ketone is at position 1.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. The ketone directs incoming Br to meta, so Br would be at position 3 or 5. Wait, it's meta to the ketone. So, acetophenone's substituent is at position 1, so bromine could go to position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, the ring has ketone (1) and Br (3). The ketone is a meta director, Br is ortho/para. So, the next nitration would be directed by the ketone and Br. Wait, but which group is more activating and thus more directing?

The ketone is a meta director, whereas Br is ortho/para. But the nitro group is a strong meta director. Wait, but in this step, we're adding nitro. So, where would the nitro group go?

Wait, in step iii, the substituents are the ketone (1, meta director) and Br (3, ortho/para). The incoming nitro group is a strong electrophile. The directing effect is influenced by the strongest activating group. But both ketone and Br are deactivating. Wait, no, wait: the ketone is deactivating (electron-withdrawing), and bromine is deactivating (but ortho/para-directing due to being an electron-withdrawing group via resonance, but actually, wait, bromine is an ortho/para director because it's a halogen. It's a weak deactivating group because of its electron-withdrawing inductive effect, but its resonance can donate electrons, making it a weaker deactivator than nitro groups.

Wait, perhaps in this case, the nitration is directed by the ketone. So, the ketone is at position 1, so the nitro would go to position 3 or 5. But position 3 already has Br, so it would go to position 5. So after step iii, the ring has ketone (1), Br (3), and NO2 (5). That's exactly the target molecule. Wait, but then what's the rest of the steps?

Option A continues: iv) Fe/HCl. Hmm, Fe/HCl is a reducing agent. Maybe it's used for something like reduction of nitro groups to NH2? But in this case, we have a nitro group that is in the correct position. So why would we reduce it?

Wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me think again. After step iii, the target is achieved. But why would there be more steps? So the target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, perhaps the steps after that are doing something else. So, perhaps option A's steps are incorrect because after step iii, the product is already the target, and then the rest of the steps would mess it up.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps.

Wait, let me check what each reagent does:

i) CH3COCl and AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation: adds a ketone group.

ii) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination in the meta position relative to the ketone.

iii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration in the meta position. Wait, but if the ketone is at 1, and Br is at 3, the next nitro group would go to 5 (meta to ketone), which is correct. So after step iii, the molecule is the target. So, why do further steps?

Looking at option A: iv) Fe/HCl → maybe that's a reduction. So, perhaps Fe/HCl is used to reduce something else. Maybe the nitro group is reduced to an amine, but that's not desired.

Hmm, but the target has a nitro group. So perhaps steps iv and beyond in option A are not necessary or even harmful. So maybe option A isn't the correct pathway.

Moving on to Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → introduce Br into benzene. Since benzene is activated, but wait, benzene requires a catalyst for bromination. So initial bromination would give bromobenzene, with Br at position 1.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Now, the ring has Br (ortho/para director). So the nitro group would go to para or ortho. If nitration occurs in para to Br, that would be position 4. But in the target, the nitro is at 5, which is meta relative to the ketone. Hmm, not sure.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. But wait, Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups. Benzene is not very reactive, but if we have Br and nitro groups, which are deactivating, the ring is deactivated towards Friedel-Crafts. So, this step might not work because the ring is deactivated. So, Option B might not be feasible because after steps i and ii, the ring is heavily deactivated, making Friedel-Crafts impossible.

So, Option B is likely incorrect.

Option C:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitrate benzene. Nitro group is strong meta director.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro group to amine? Wait, Fe and HCl is not a common reduction condition. Nitro groups are usually reduced with H2/Pd or Sn/HCl. Wait, but Fe/HCl might not do much.

Alternatively, perhaps step ii is nitration again? No, because it's Fe/HCl. Alternatively, maybe it's a catalyst for something else.

Wait, step iii is CH3COCl/AlCl3. So Friedel-Crafts. But after nitration, the ring is deactivated. So can Friedel-Crafts proceed? Because nitro is a strong deactivating group, making the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution. So, Friedel-Crafts might not work. So Option C might not be viable.

Option D:

i) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Benzene gets a nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction of nitro to amine. But again, I'm not sure.

Wait, Fe in HCl is maybe for something else. Oh, wait, sometimes Fe/HCl is used for generating Cl- in solution, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a step to form diazonium salt, but that would require a nitrous acid condition, which is NaNO2 and HCl. Hmm.

Wait, let's think about Option D's steps:

i) Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine? But nitrobenzene is typically reduced with H2/Pt or Sn/HCl. Fe/HCl might not be the right condition. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and it's H2S or something else.

Wait, perhaps step ii is a substitution. Alternatively, maybe this is a typo and it's a different reagent.

But moving on, step iii is NaNO2/HCl → diazotization. That would require an amine. But if step ii is a reduction of nitro to amine, then step iii would generate a diazonium salt.

Then step iv is H3PO2 → which is a reducing agent, maybe for something else. Alternatively, H3PO2 is used in the Sandmeyer reaction to introduce halogens.

Wait, if we have a diazonium salt (from step iii), then treating with H3PO2 would lead to displacement, perhaps introducing a bromine or iodine. But I'm not very sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps in D are:

i) Nitration,

ii) Reduction,

iii) Diazotization,

iv) something,

v) Br2,

vi) acylation.

But I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to outline the steps:

Option D:

i) Nitration → nitro group at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine, giving aniline.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization of the amine (but aniline is difficult to diazotize; it requires low temperatures, typically 0-5°C, and strong acid).

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps decompose the diazonium salt to form a halogen? Wait, but H3PO2 is a reducing agent. Oh, wait, the Sandmeyer reaction uses CuCN or CuCl to introduce cyanide or chloride. But H3PO2 is used in the Gattermann–Koch reaction to reduce carbonyl groups.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up reactions. Alternatively, perhaps H3PO2 is used in another context.

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me think again about the target molecule.

The target is 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one. So, positions 1: ketone, 3: Br, 5: nitro.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituents are arranged such that the ketone is at position 1, Br at 3 (meta to ketone), and nitro at 5 (meta to Br or something else? Wait, no. If the ketone is at 1, then the nitro is at 5, which is two positions away, which is meta. So, maybe the nitro and Br are both meta to the ketone.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is to introduce the nitro group first, then the bromine, and then the ketone. Because if the nitro is a meta director, adding the bromine would be in a position directed by the nitro, but wait, no—because the nitro is a meta director, but adding the bromine after nitration would go to the meta position relative to the nitro. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. First, nitrate benzene → nitro group at position 1.

2. Then, brominate → Br would go to position 3 (meta to nitro).

3. Then, introduce the ketone. But wait, the ring already has nitro and Br. Are they activating or deactivating?

Nitro is a strong deactivating group (meta), bromine is deactivating but ortho/para. So, the ring is deactivating, making Friedel-Crafts difficult. So, perhaps that's a problem.

Unless, we can activate the ring again with some substituent. But I don't think so. Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced via a different route.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the ketone is introduced via a methyl group that is then oxidized. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced via Friedel-Crafts acylation, but only after activating groups have been introduced. But nitro and Br are deactivating, which would make the ring less reactive towards electrophilic substitution.

So, maybe the acylation step must come before the nitration and bromination steps.

Wait, let me think of the correct order. Let's say:

1. Acylation of benzene → acetophenone.

2. Nitration → adds nitro group meta to the ketone.

3. Bromination → adds Br meta to the ketone, but considering nitro group's influence.

Wait, but in acetophenone, the ketone directs incoming substituents to the meta positions. So, after ketone is added, nitration would occur at position 3 or 5 (meta to ketone). Let's say position 5.

Then bromination would occur, but where? The ring now has ketone (1) and nitro (5). The nitro group is a strong meta director. So, bromine would likely go to position 3 (meta to nitro), but also considering the ketone's directing.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to imagine.

After step i: acetophenone (1).

Step ii: nitration adds nitro at position 5 (meta to ketone).

Now, the ring has substituents at 1 and 5. Next, bromination.

The ring has two substituents: ketone (1, meta director) and nitro (5, meta director). So where would Br go?

The ketone directs meta, so from position 1, meta would be positions 3 and 5. But 5 is already occupied by nitro. So, Br would go to position 3, which is meta to ketone and para to nitro.

Wait, that would give Br at 3, nitro at 5. So, the ring would have substituents at 1 (ketone), 3 (Br), and 5 (nitro). That's exactly the target molecule.

So, the steps would be: acylation (Friedel-Crafts), nitration, then bromination.

But looking at the options, let's see which option has this sequence.

Option A: Steps i, ii, iii are acylation, bromination, nitration. So, after step i: ketone. Step ii: Br adds to position 3. Then step iii: nitration. Where would nitration go?

Wait, after acylation and bromination, the ring has ketone (1) and Br (3). Now, nitration would be directed by both. The ketone is a meta director, and Br is ortho/para.

So, the incoming nitro group would be influenced by these. The position available would be position 5 (meta to ketone, para to Br). So, nitration would go to position 5.

So, after these three steps, the target is achieved. But Option A has more steps after that.

Wait, but in Option A, after step iii (nitration), steps iv and beyond are: iv) Fe/HCl; v) HNO3/H2SO4; vi) NaNO2/HCl; vii) H3PO2.

Hmm, why would they do that? Because the target has all three substituents already after step iii. So, the rest of the steps are unnecessary and might even change the structure. For example, step iv with Fe/HCl might reduce the nitro group, which is not desired. So, perhaps Option A is not correct because the remaining steps would alter the desired product.

Looking back, perhaps the correct sequence is acylation, bromination, nitration. But in the options, only Option A starts with acylation, then bromination, then nitration. So, after step iii, the target is achieved. So, why are there more steps?

Is there a possibility that the target is formed after step iii, but the subsequent steps in Option A are not part of the reaction? Or perhaps some other reasoning.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the nitration in step iii doesn't go into the correct position because the ring is already deactivated. Wait, no, the ring has a ketone and Br, which are deactivating. So, nitration would be difficult in such a case. But if the ring still can undergo nitration, then it would go to position 5.

Alternatively, maybe I'm not considering that each step's directing effects properly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is nitration first, then acylation, but that's difficult because nitro is a meta director, and then acylation would require an activating group, which nitro isn't.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the correct steps are: nitration, then bromination, then acylation.

But that would require the ring to have nitro and Br, then Friedel-Crafts. But Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups, which nitro and Br aren't. So, perhaps that's not feasible.

Wait, perhaps the bromine is added after the acylation. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: think about the possible intermediates in each option.

Looking again at Option C:

i) Nitration → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction? But nitro to amine would require something like Sn/HCl. Fe/HCl might not do that.

iii) Friedel-Crafts → adding ketone. But nitro is a deactivating group, so Friedel-Crafts may not proceed.

So, probably, Option C isn't the right path because Friedel-Crafts won't work after nitration.

Option D:

i) Nitration → nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → perhaps reduction to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → perhaps a substitution reaction? For example, generating a bromide via diazonium salt decomposition.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

vi) Friedel-Crafts acylation.

vii) Nitration again.

Wait, but this seems complicated. Let's see the steps:

1. Nitrate benzene → nitrobenzene.

2. Reduce nitro to amine → aniline.

3. Diazotize → diazonium chloride.

4. Treat with H3PO2 → what happens? Maybe the diazonium salt decomposes to give something else. Alternatively, H3PO2 is a mild reducing agent. Maybe it's used in the Gattermann–Koch reaction, but that's for formylation.

Alternatively, perhaps steps iii and iv are for introducing a bromide. Wait, if you have a diazonium salt and treat with H3PO2, maybe it's a way to substitute the amino group with something else. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are intended to introduce Br. Let's see: If after nitration and reduction, you have aniline, then diazotization gives a diazonium salt. Then, maybe treating with H3PO2 (which is a reducing agent) would decompose the diazonium salt to produce a bromine? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the steps are for introducing a bromine via a substitution.

But this is getting too unclear. I'm probably getting stuck trying to figure out each step in all options, which is time-consuming.

Let me think again about which option correctly adds the substituents in the right order.

The target has nitro, Br, and ketone at positions 1, 3, and 5. So, perhaps the correct sequence is:

1. Introduce the nitro group first, then the Br, then the ketone. But nitro is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts won't work.

Alternative approach: Introduce the nitro group and Br first, then find a way to add the ketone. But again, with deactivating groups, Friedel-Crafts is unlikely.

Wait, maybe the ketone is introduced via a different method, such as the oxidation of a methyl group. But how would the methyl group get there?

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced via a Gattermann–Koch reaction, which adds a formyl group. Then, it can be oxidized to a ketone. But that's a more complicated route and I'm not sure if it's part of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the ketone is introduced via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution, but that typically requires strong activating groups, which are not present here.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct order is to introduce the ketone first, then nitro, then Br. But as I thought earlier, after the ketone, nitro would go to 5, then Br to 3.

But then, why would some options have more steps? Because in the target, the nitro is at 5. So, maybe the correct sequence is acylation, nitration, bromination.

Wait, but in that case, after acylation and nitration, you have nitro at 5. Then bromination would add Br at 3, which is meta to ketone and para to nitro. So, yes, that would give the target.

But then, looking at the options, which option has acylation first, then nitration, then bromination.

Looking again:

Option A: i) acylation; ii) bromination; iii) nitration.

So, after step iii, the target is achieved. But the option has more steps after that. Why?

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when you nitrate after bromination, the positions are directed differently.

Wait, let me think again. After acylation, the ring has the ketone at 1. Then, step ii is bromination with FeBr3. So, the ketone directs Br to position 3. Now, the ring has ketone at 1, Br at 3.

Then, step iii is nitration. The ring now has two substituents: ketone (1, meta director) and Br (3, ortho/para director). So, where would nitration occur?

The nitration is directed by both substituents. The ketone wants the nitro to go meta to it, which is positions 3 or 5. But position 3 is already occupied by Br. So, nitro would go to position 5.

So, after these three steps, the target is achieved. So, why does the option have more steps? Because steps iv to vii are additional. So, perhaps that's not the correct sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial steps are wrong because the nitration must occur before bromination. Let me think.

Another angle: perhaps the correct sequence is nitration, then bromination, then acylation. But nitration first: benzene → nitrobenzene. Then bromination: nitro is meta director, so Br would go to position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3. Then, acylation: the ring now has nitro (1) and Br (3). Friedel-Crafts requires activating groups, but nitro and Br are deactivating. So, acylation won't proceed. So, that's a problem.

Hmm. So, perhaps the only viable way is to introduce the ketone first, then nitro, then bromine. But looking at the options, only Option A has that, but the rest of the steps in A may not be necessary.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is Option A. Because after the initial three steps, the target is made, and the additional steps are either unnecessary or perhaps a typo. But I'm not sure why there are more steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order.

Wait, another approach: The correct order of adding substituents would have the acylation last because the ketone is a meta director, and adding it last would allow the nitro and Br to be in the correct positions.

Wait, let's think again about the target: the ketone is at position 1, Br at 3, and nitro at 5. So, perhaps the nitro is added first, then the Br, then the ketone. But how?

Wait, nitro is added first (position 1). Then, the ring has nitro group, which is meta director. So, the next substituent, Br, would go to position 3 or 5. Let's say position 3. Then, the ring has nitro (1) and Br (3). Now, the ketone has to be introduced. But with both nitro and Br on the ring, Friedel-Crafts won't work because they are deactivating. So that's a problem.

So, that approach won't work.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the Br is added after the ketone and nitro. Let me imagine:

1. Acylation: ketone at 1.

2. Nitration: nitro at 5.

3. Bromination: Br at 3.

Which is exactly what I thought earlier. So, the correct steps are acylation, nitration, bromination.

Looking at the options, which option does that?

Option A: i) acylation; ii) bromination; iii) nitration.

Hmm, that's acylation, then bromination, then nitration. So, the nitration comes third. Which would place nitro at position 5.

Wait, but earlier I thought that after acylation and bromination, nitration would come third, placing nitro at 5.

So, in Option A, after step iii, the target is achieved. So, why are there more steps? Because step iv is Fe/HCl, which is maybe a reduction.

But the target requires a nitro group, so any step that reduces it would be bad. So, perhaps Option A is not correct because the steps after iii would alter the nitro group.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the nitration in step iii may not go to position 5.

Wait, perhaps the ring is already deactivating due to the ketone and Br, making nitration difficult. So, perhaps in Option A, the nitration in step iii doesn't occur efficiently, leading to low yield. So, that's not the high-yield option.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck. Let's think about each option again.

Option B:

i) Br2/FeBr3 → bromobenzene.

ii) HNO3/H2SO4 → nitration. Br is ortho/para director. So, nitro could go to position 2 or 4.

iii) CH3COCl/AlCl3 → Friedel-Crafts acylation. But with Br and nitro groups, which are deactivating, the ring is not reactive enough. So, Friedel-Crafts may not proceed.

So, this option is probably incorrect.

Option C:

i) HNO3 → nitration. Nitro at position 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduce nitro to amine.

But Fe/HCl isn't a common reducing agent for nitro groups. Typically, nitro is reduced with H2/Pd or Sn/HCl. So, this step might not work.

iii) CH3COCl → Friedel-Crafts. Again, after nitration, the ring is deactivating, so Friedel-Crafts unlikely.

So, Option C is incorrect.

Option D:

i) HNO3 → nitro group.

ii) Fe/HCl → not sure, maybe reduce to amine.

iii) NaNO2/HCl → diazotization.

iv) H3PO2 → some reaction.

v) Br2/FeBr3 → bromination.

vi) CH3COCl → Friedel-Crafts.

vii) HNO3 → nitrate again.

This seems convoluted, and I'm not sure about the steps. But let's see:

After step i: nitro at 1.

Step ii: reduce nitro to amine → aniline (position 1).

Step iii: diazotization → diazonium salt.

Step iv: H3PO2 → what's that do? Maybe it's used to reduce the diazonium salt. Diazonium salts can be decomposed to give amines, but in the presence of H3PO2, perhaps it's for coupling or substitution.

Wait, another possibility: H3PO2 is a reducing agent that can reduce certain functional groups. But I'm not certain how it would affect the diazonium salt.

Alternatively, perhaps steps iii and iv are for introducing bromine. If the diazonium salt is decomposed with H3PO2, maybe it substitutes the amino group with a bromine. But I'm not familiar with that exact reaction.

Assuming that after step iv, Br is introduced at position 1. Then step v is Br2/FeBr3 → bromination. But if we already have Br at 1, adding more Br would be difficult, but perhaps in another position.

This seems messy, and I'm not confident it leads to the desired product.

Hmm. So, reviewing all the options, the only one that seems to approach the correct order is Option A. However, the additional steps after the target is achieved in step iii are confusing. Perhaps the correct answer is A, assuming that steps iv to vii are either not needed or perhaps a mistake in the option setup.

Wait, perhaps the target isn't achieved in step iii. Let me think again. After step iii in Option A (nitration), the nitro group would be added. But where?

Wait, let's imagine:

Option A steps:

i) Acylation → ketone at 1.

ii) Bromination → Br at 3.

iii) Nitration → where?

The ring now has ketone (1) and Br (3). The nitro group will be directed by both substituents.

The ketone is a meta director, so the nitro could go to 5 (meta to ketone). But Br is an ortho/para director, so from Br at 3, the nitro could go to 2, 4, or 6. But the ring's substitution is getting complex.

Wait, maybe the nitro group would be directed by the Br. So, para to Br is position 6. Ortho to Br is position 2 and 4.

But the ketone is at position 1. So, if nitro is added para to Br (position 6), but that's adjacent to the ketone. But the ketone is a meta director, so the nitro would be more likely to go meta to the ketone, which is position 5.

So, the nitro would end up at position 5.

Thus, after step iii, the product is the target. So, why are there more steps?

Ah, perhaps the problem is that the bromine and nitro groups are added in such a way that after acylation, bromination, and nitration, there's another reaction needed, but I can't see what it would be.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong and the correct order is different.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe the nitration should occur before bromination. Let's say, in Option A, nitration is the third step, but the ring's substituents are ketone and Br, and the nitro goes to position 5. So, the product is correct. So, the subsequent steps in Option A are perhaps a mistake, but the first three steps are correct.

So, perhaps the correct answer is Option A, assuming that the target is achieved at step iii and the remaining steps are extra but not affecting the product.

Alternatively, maybe some of the steps are for purification or work-up, but that's unlikely.

Hmm. Another approach: the correct sequence would be acylation, nitration, bromination. So, looking at the options, which option has that? Option C has acylation as step iii. Option A has acylation as step i, nitration as step iii, bromination as step ii.

Wait, no. Option A's sequence is acylation, bromination, nitration. So, nitro is added third, which as I thought, gives the correct product.

But the subsequent steps in Option A are then doing something else, which is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps after the target is achieved, the product is treated further, but those steps are not relevant to the synthesis of the target. So, perhaps the correct answer is Option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the reaction steps. For example, perhaps the nitration in step iii doesn't add the nitro group because the ring is deactivating, leading to a lower yield.

But the question asks for the high-yield synthesis. So, which option would have the best directing effects and least competition, allowing each substituent to be added in the correct position.

So, the correct order would be acylation, nitration, bromination. But no option seems to follow that exactly. Let me check the options again.

Looking at Option C:

i) Nitration → nitro at 1.

ii) Fe/HCl → maybe reduction to amine.

iii) Acylation → but with nitro, which deactivates the ring, so Friedel-Crafts won't work.

So, Option C is incorrect.

Option D:

Steps are nitration, reduction, diazotization, H3PO2, bromination, acylation, nitration. The sequence seems off, but perhaps the first nitration in D is at position 1, then steps after would add substituents elsewhere.

But I'm not confident. I think the correct order is acylation first, then nitration, then bromination, which is Option A's first three steps. So, perhaps the correct answer is Option A, despite the extra steps.

Alternatively, perhaps Option C's steps are acylation after nitration and reduction, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the possibility that the bromine is introduced via a different method, such as a coupling reaction. But that's beyond the scope of the options given.

After all this, I'm going to conclude that the correct answer is Option A, as it introduces the substituents in the correct order to achieve the target.


To synthesize 1-(3-bromo-5-nitrophenyl)ethan-1-one starting from benzene, the correct sequence of reactions must introduce the substituents in the right order, considering the directing effects of each group. The target molecule has a ketone group at position 1, a bromine atom at position 3, and a nitro group at position 5. These substituents are arranged in a symmetric pattern, with the ketone and nitro group being meta-directors, and bromine being an ortho/para-director.

### Analysis of Each Option:

#### **Option A**:
1. **i) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts acylation introduces the ketone group at position 1.
2. **ii) Br₂/FeBr₃**: Bromination occurs, with the ketone directing bromine to position 3 (meta to the ketone).
3. **iii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration introduces the nitro group, which is directed to position 5 (meta to the ketone and para to bromine).
   - At this point, the target molecule is achieved after the first three steps. The remaining steps (iv to vii) are unnecessary and could potentially alter the product, but they do not affect the high-yield synthesis of the target.

#### **Option B**:
1. **i) Br₂/FeBr₃**: Bromination introduces a bromine atom at position 1.
2. **ii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration introduces a nitro group, which would be directed to position 3 or 5 (ortho/para to bromine). However, the ketone group cannot be introduced later due to the deactivating nature of bromine and nitro groups, making Friedel-Crafts acylation infeasible.
   - This option fails because the ketone cannot be introduced after bromine and nitro groups.

#### **Option C**:
1. **i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration introduces a nitro group at position 1.
2. **ii) Fe/HCl**: This step is unclear but may involve reduction. However, reducing the nitro group to an amine is not consistent with the target molecule.
3. **iii) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts acylation would fail because the nitro group is a strong deactivator, making the ring unreactive toward electrophilic substitution.
   - This option is not viable due to the inability to introduce the ketone group after nitration.

#### **Option D**:
1. **i) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Nitration introduces a nitro group at position 1.
2. **ii) Fe/HCl**: This step is unclear but may involve reduction. However, reducing the nitro group to an amine is not consistent with the target molecule.
3. **iii) NaNO₂/HCl**: Diazotization requires an amine, which is not present in this sequence.
4. **iv) H₃PO₂**: This step is unclear and does not align with the synthesis of the target molecule.
5. **v) Br₂/FeBr₃**: Bromination would occur, but the sequence of steps is convoluted and does not guarantee the correct placement of substituents.
6. **vi) CH₃COCl/AlCl₃**: Friedel-Crafts acylation would fail due to the deactivating nature of the existing substituents.
7. **vii) HNO₃/H₂SO₄**: Additional nitration is unnecessary and could alter the product.
   - This option is overly complex and does not lead to the target molecule efficiently.

### Conclusion:
The correct sequence of reactions is found in **Option A**, where the ketone is introduced first, followed by bromine and nitro groups in the correct positions. While the additional steps in Option A are not necessary, the first three steps achieve the target molecule in a high-yield manner.
