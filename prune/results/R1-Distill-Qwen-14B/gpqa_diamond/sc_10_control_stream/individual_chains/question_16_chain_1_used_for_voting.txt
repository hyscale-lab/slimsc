Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it's not superimposable on its mirror image. So, I need to figure out which of these compounds are chiral.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
Wait, this is an alkene with a substituent on each carbon. The configuration is Z, so the higher priority groups are on the same side. But does this make the molecule chiral? Well, for a molecule to be chiral, it needs to have a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon with four different substituents. Let's see: the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but wait no, wait. Wait, but it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but wait, no, it's 2-methyl. Hmm, maybe the structure is Cl attached to the first carbon, and a double bond between C1 and C2, with a methyl on C2. So it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait, no, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, a double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl on C2. So structure: CH2Cl is the first carbon, then double bond to C2 which has a methyl and another CH2 group. Wait, so the structure would be ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but wait, but the molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, which would be Cl on C1, and a methyl on C2, with double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2Cl connected to a double bond CH(CH3)-CH2? Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl attached to a double bond. Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So if it's but-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but that's not a double bond. Wait, no: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl on C1, double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl on C2. So C1 is Cl, double bonded to C2 which has a methyl and another CH2 group. Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons. So C1: Cl attached, double bond to C2, which has a methyl and another CH2 group. So the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait no. Or wait, maybe the structure is Cl on C1, and C2 has a methyl and a CH2 group, but that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possibility of chirality.

Alternatively, let's think about the molecule. If it's but-1-ene with 1-chloro and 2-methyl, then the structure is (Z) configuration. So the substituents on C1 and C2. Wait, but wait, for a molecule to be chiral, it must have a chiral center. Does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's think about each carbon. C1 is Cl, CH2, double bond, and another substituent. Wait, C1 would have Cl, two Hs, and the double bond. So it's CH2Cl, but since it's a double bond, perhaps that's a double bond to a CH group. Wait, but C1 is connected to Cl, two Hs, and a double bond to C2. So C1 has two H's, Cl, and double bond to C2. So no, C1 is not a chiral center because it's double-bonded, so it's not a tetrahedral center. C2 has a double bond, a methyl, and two more substituents? Wait, but if C2 has a double bond, then its substituents are CH(CH3), so maybe it's CH(CH3) connected via double bond. So, I don't think either C1 or C2 are chiral centers. Then, what about the other carbons? C3 and C4? C3 has two CH2 groups perhaps, so probably identical substituents. So no chiral centers. Thus, this compound is not chiral. So it won't exhibit optical activity.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me parse the name. It's a bicyclic compound, maybe. Methanoisobenzofuran suggests a ring structure with a fused ring. The substituent is chloromethylene, which is a CH2Cl group attached as a double bond? Wait, chloromethylene is Cl2C= but wait, no. Wait, chloromethylene would be CH2Cl as a substituent, but wait, no. Wait, methylene is CH2, so chloromethylene is CH2Cl? No, wait, chloromethylene is more like Cl2C=, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent where a CH2Cl is attached as a double bond. Wait, perhaps the structure is part of a ring, like a furan or similar.

Wait, but in any case, the molecule has specific stereochemistry. The (3aR,7aS,E) indicates that the molecule has stereogenic centers and a double bond with E configuration. So, if the molecule has stereogenic centers, it could be chiral. Also, because it's a complex bicyclic structure, perhaps it's not planar, and has multiple stereocenters. So, this molecule probably is chiral and will exhibit optical activity.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would have methyl groups on the 2nd and 3rd carbons. So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, wait: succinic acid is four carbons: O=C-O-CH2-CH2-O-C=O. Wait, no, actually, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would be HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)H-COOH. Wait, but with the R and S configurations. So each of the 2 and 3 carbons have two methyl groups, a hydrogen, and two carboxylic acid groups. Wait, so each of these carbons would have four substituents: the two CH3, two COOH groups? No, wait, the structure would be:

HOOC-CH(CH3)(S)-CH(CH3)(R)-COOH.

Wait, but wait, each of these carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to:

C2: CH(CH3) with substituents: CH3, CH(CH3), COOH, and another COOH? No, let me think again. The structure of succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When you have 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, each of the middle CH2 groups becomes CH(CH3). So C2 is CH(CH3), and C3 is CH(CH3).

Each of these carbons (C2 and C3) has:

- Two CH(CH3) groups (but wait, no, that's not right. Each of the middle carbons is CH(CH3) connected to the two COOH groups.

Wait, no: C2 is connected to C1 (COOH), C3, two CH3 groups? No, wait, the formula is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has:

C2: substituents are CH3, CH(CH3), COOH, and CH(CH3). Wait, let me think about the substituents on C2. So C2 is attached to:

- One COOH group (from C1),
- One CH(CH3) group (the C3),
- Two CH3 groups.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, C2 is CH(CH3), so it's connected to:

- C1 (COOH),
- C3 (CH(CH3)),
- Two methyl groups (CH3).

Wait, no, that's not possible because CH(CH3) would have three substituents: two CH3 and a CH2? Wait, no, let me get the structure right. 

Actually, in the molecule, each of C2 and C3 in 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid would have the following substituents:

C2: connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two methyl groups (CH3). So substituents are CH3, CH3, COOH, and CH(CH3). Wait, that's four substituents: two CH3, a COOH, and a CH(CH3). But wait, CH(CH3) is a carbon itself, so that's a bit confusing.

Wait, no. Let's think about the structure again. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is a carbon connected as follows:

- C2: connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), a methyl group (CH3), and another methyl group (CH3). Wait, so both C2 and C3 have two CH3 groups, a COOH (for C2, it's from C1; for C3, it's from C4), and another CH(CH3). So in that case, each of C2 and C3 has two methyl groups, one COOH group, and a CH(CH3) group. Wait, but that would make four substituents: two CH3, one COOH, and another CH(CH3). So for each, the substituents are CH3, CH3, COOH, and CH(CH3). Wait, but wait, that's four substituents. But wait, if a carbon has two identical substituents (like two CH3), then it cannot be a chiral center because a chiral center needs four different substituents. Oh wait, but wait, if the substituents are CH3 ×2, then two substituents are same. So each of C2 and C3 has two CH3 groups, making their substituents not all different. So, the molecule (2R,3S) would have C2 and C3 as stereogenic centers? Wait, but wait, can a carbon with two identical substituents be a stereogenic center? Because if two substituents are the same, the arrangement might not allow for chirality. So, for example, if a carbon has two CH3 groups, a COOH, and a CH(CH3), then two substituents are same. So the substituents are: CH3, CH3, COOH, and CH(CH3). So the carbon has two identical groups. So, that's two substituents the same. Therefore, such a carbon cannot be a chiral center because it doesn't have four different substituents. Hence, the molecule (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it won't exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has:

- Two methyl groups (CH3),
- One -CH(CH3) group (for C2, it's connected to C3, which is -CH(CH3), and for C3, connected to C2),
- One carboxylic acid group (COOH).

Wait, no, that's not right. Each C is connected to two other carbons (C1 and C3 for C2, and C2 and C4 for C3), each of which has a COOH group. So, for C2, substituents are:

- CH3,
- CH3,
- COOH (from C1),
- CH(CH3) (which is part of C3, but that's a carbon with two CH3 groups and a COOH).

Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong. Another way: for a carbon to be chiral, it must have four distinct groups. Let's look at C2:

The groups attached are:

1. -CH(CH3) (the group from C3),
2. -COOH (from C1),
3. Two CH3 groups.

So, two of the substituents are CH3. So the carbon has two identical groups, so it's not a chiral center. Same for C3. So, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it's not chiral, so no optical activity.

Wait, but the question states that the compound is (2R,3S). If both C2 and C3 are stereocenters, but my analysis says they aren't, then maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the arrangement creates some kind of internal asymmetry, but I don't think so. Because without any chiral centers, the molecule can't be chiral. So, I think this compound is not chiral and won't show optical activity.

Wait, but wait, another thought: maybe the molecule is a meso compound. Meso compounds have stereocenters but are achiral due to a plane of symmetry. For example, tartaric acid is a meso compound when both stereocenters are R and S. So in this case, if the molecule (2R,3S) is a meso form, then it's not chiral. Let me check that.

If the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, and the stereocenters are C2 (R) and C3 (S), would there be a plane of symmetry? Let's imagine the molecule: the two methyl groups on C2 and C3, and the two COOH groups. If the configuration is R on C2 and S on C3, would that create a plane of symmetry? Well, the molecule would have a center of inversion perhaps. Let me think: if you have two stereocenters, and the configurations are opposite, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound. In this case, the two stereocenters are on adjacent carbons, and the substituents are arranged symmetrically. So I think this is a meso compound, making it achiral. So, this compound doesn't exhibit optical activity.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
Same base structure as compound 3, but with both stereocenters as R. So, let's analyze. Again, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, with C2 and C3 as R and R.

Wait, but earlier analysis shows that each of C2 and C3 has two CH3 groups, so their substituents are CH3, CH3, COOH, and CH(CH3). So, again, each would have two identical substituents. So, even if both are R configuration, the substituents are not all different. Thus, each carbon isn't a chiral center. So, this compound also has no chiral centers. Therefore, it's not chiral. So, no optical activity.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let's imagine the molecule. If the substituents on C2 are CH3, CH3, COOH, and CH(CH3), then perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. But in this case, with both stereocenters being R, would that make it a meso compound? Wait, no, because if the configurations are both R, then the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry. Wait, but earlier in compound 3, the configurations were R and S, which made it a meso compound. In this case, both R and R would not have a plane of symmetry, so the molecule would be chiral. Wait, but without chiral centers, can the molecule be chiral? No, wait, no. Because each of the carbons isn't a chiral center. So, even if the configurations are R and R, each carbon isn't a stereocenter because two substituents are same. So, the molecule as a whole isn't chiral. Therefore, no optical activity.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think again: If a carbon has two identical substituents, it can't be a stereocenter. So, if both C2 and C3 are CH(CH3) with two CH3 groups, then each has two identical substituents. So, regardless of the configuration, they can't be stereocenters. Thus, the molecule has no chiral centers. So, compounds 3 and 4 don't exhibit optical activity.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
This is an alcohol with a cyclohexene ring. The substituents would be the OH on C1, and a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: the double bond is between C3 and C4, and the OH is on C1. So the structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and an OH group. The (R) configuration indicates that the OH is in a specific position.

Now, for a cyclohexene ring, is the molecule chiral? Well, the cyclohexene ring could have a stereogenic center at C1. Let me think about the substituents on C1: OH, two CH2 groups (adjacent carbons), and the cyclohexene ring. Wait, no. Wait, the structure of cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have the OH on C1. Each carbon in the ring is connected to two other carbons in the ring. So, C1 is connected to C2 and C6, and also has the OH group and a CH2 group (from the ring). Wait, no, in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons in the ring and two other substituents. So, for C1, the substituents are:

- OH group,
- The ring (so two CH2 groups, but that might not count as substituents in the same way).

Wait, no. Each carbon in the ring has two ring substituents and two other substituents. So on C1, the substituents are OH, two CH2 groups (from the ring), and the double bond? Wait, no, the double bond is on C3 and C4. So, perhaps C1's substituents are OH, two CH2 groups, and another CH group.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me approach this differently. For a molecule to be chiral, it must have at least one chiral center. So, does C1 in this molecule have four different substituents?

C1 is attached to:

- OH,
- The ring (so connected to C2 and C6),
- And the rest: perhaps two CH2 groups or something else.

Wait, in a cyclohexene ring, the double bond is between C3 and C4, so the structure would have C1 with substituents: OH, and three other substituents that are part of the ring. But in a ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent ring carbons, and two other substituents. So, for C1 in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the substituents would be:

- OH,
- CH2- (to C2),
- CH2- (to C6),
- And the other substituent would be a CH group that's part of the ring? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps C1 has the following substituents:

- OH,
- -CH2-CH2- (from C2 and C6),
- and two other substituents that are part of the ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that C1 has four different substituents. Let me imagine the structure. The ring is cyclohexene, so it's a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4. The OH is on C1. So, the substituents around C1 would be:

- OH,
- The ring (so, connected to C2 and C6),
- A hydrogen, perhaps?

Wait, no, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring, each carbon is CH2, except when there are substituents. So, in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, C1 has an OH group, and the other substituents are CH2 groups connected to the ring. So, C1 would have substituents: OH, CH2 (to C2), CH2 (to C6), and a hydrogen. Wait, but that would make four different substituents: OH, CH2CH2..., etc. Wait, no, that's not possible because if C1 is connected to two CH2 groups (to C2 and C6), but those CH2 groups are part of the ring. So, for the substituents, C1 has:

- OH,
- Two CH2 groups (each connected to adjacent ring carbons), and
- A hydrogen.

Wait, but wait, a cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure is:

C1: OH, connected to C2 and C6.
C2: connected to C1 and C3.
C3: double bond to C4.
C4: double bond to C3, connected to C5.
C5: connected to C4 and C6.
C6: connected to C5 and C1.

So, each of the ring carbons (except C3 and C4) is a CH2 group. So, C1 has substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and a single hydrogen. So, the substituents on C1 are OH, two CH2 groups, and H. But wait, CH2 groups are the same as each other? No, because C2 is connected to a CH2 group that's part of the ring, which has the double bond at C3. So, are the substituents on C1 all different?

Wait, C1 is attached to:

- OH,
- CH2-C (which is C2, which is connected to C3, part of the double bond),
- CH2-C (which is C6, connected to C5, which is connected to C4, part of the double bond),
- and a hydrogen.

So, the substituents on C1 are:

1. OH,
2. CH2-C (ring, with C2 adjacent to double bond),
3. CH2-C (ring, with C6 adjacent to double bond),
4. H.

Wait, but are the two CH2 substituents (from C2 and C6) different? Because the rest of the ring is arranged with a double bond, so perhaps the substituents from C2 and C6 are in different environments, making them different. So, if that's the case, then C1 has four different substituents: OH, two different CH2 groups (since they're attached to different parts of the ring), and a hydrogen. Thus, C1 is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is chiral and will exhibit optical activity.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. All are in the s configuration. Let me think about the structure. If the hydroxyl groups are on positions 1, 3, and 5, all in the same (s) configuration, then the molecule's symmetry could determine its chirality.

Wait, cyclohexane has six carbons. Positions 1, 3, and 5 are alternate carbons, so they form an alternating pattern. If all three hydroxyls are on s configuration, then perhaps there's a plane of symmetry.

Wait, for a molecule to be chiral, it needs to lack a plane of symmetry. So, if all three OH groups are in the same configuration, and arranged symmetrically, the molecule might be achiral. But wait, the positions 1,3,5 are all alternate, so they form a trigonal symmetric arrangement. So, if all three OH groups are on the same face (all R or all S), would that make the molecule have a plane of symmetry?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine the structure. If the OH groups are all axial or all equatorial, and arranged in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Wait, but the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyls.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image. Alternatively, maybe it has a center of inversion. Let's think: it's 1,3,5-cyclohexane triol, all S configuration. So, the OH groups are on C1, C3, C5, all in the same direction. Would that create a chiral molecule? Or would the symmetry make it achiral?

Wait, in a cyclohexane ring with three substituents at 1,3,5 positions, all in the same configuration, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if you imagine a plane passing through the center of the ring, perpendicular to the plane of the ring, then perhaps this would be a plane of symmetry. So, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule would be achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are all on the same face, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion. For example, if each substituent is mirrored across the center, making it a meso compound.

Wait, but wait, if all three substituents are in the same configuration, then the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry. Let me think of a similar structure, like 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane. If all three methyl groups are on the same face, then the molecule is chiral because there's no plane of symmetry. Because any plane would have to mirror the positions, but with three substituents, it's impossible to have a plane that would mirror all three. So, perhaps this molecule is chiral.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me think again. The molecule is (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. If all three OH groups are in the same configuration, then perhaps the molecule is chiral. Let me imagine: the ring is flat, with each OH on the same face. Then, looking from the top, the OHs are at 12, 4, and 8 o'clock positions. If all are on the same side, the molecule may not have a plane of symmetry because there's no mirror line that could reflect all three. So, perhaps this molecule is chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is meso due to having a plane of symmetry. Wait, for a molecule to be meso, it must have multiple stereocenters and a plane of symmetry. In this case, with three stereocenters, it's unclear whether a plane of symmetry exists. But I'm starting to think that this molecule is chiral.

Wait, another approach: the number of stereocenters can sometimes indicate chirality. Three stereocenters could mean the molecule is chiral, but if there's a plane of symmetry, it might not be. So, in this case, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral, but if not, it's chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion. For cyclohexane, a center of inversion would be the center of the ring. If each substituent has a mirror image across that center, then the molecule would be achiral. So, in (1s,3s,5s), each substituent would have an opposite configuration across the center. But wait, in this case, all are s configuration, which would mean that if you invert through the center, each substituent's configuration would be opposite. So, for example, C1 (s) would have its mirror image as C4 (but C4 isn't substituted). Similarly for C3 and C5. Wait, this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is achiral because the substituents are arranged symmetrically. For example, 1,3,5-trihydroxy cyclohexane with all substituents on the same face would have a center of inversion, making it a meso compound, hence achiral. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: if the molecule has three stereocenters, all in the same configuration, perhaps it's chiral. For example, if you arrange substituents in a way that there's no plane of symmetry. So, maybe this molecule is chiral. Therefore, it would exhibit optical activity.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the 1st carbon of a butanone. So, the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's not correct. Wait, butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but wait, no. Butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO-CH3? No, butan-1-one is CH3CH2CH2-CO. Wait, but that's not possible because the ketone is at the end. Wait, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2-CO-CH3? Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the numbering. Butan-1-one would be (CH2)3-CO. Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2CH2CH2)CO. No, wait, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2-CO, but that can't be right because the ketone is at the end. Wait, butan-1-one would be (CH3)COCH2CH2CH3? No, no, wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. No, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Butan-1-one is:

O
||
CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

Wait, no, that's pentan-2-one. Wait, no, butan-1-one would have the carbonyl at the end. So structure is:

O
||
CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-

But that doesn't make sense because the carbonyl would have to be between two carbons. So perhaps it's impossible. Alternatively, butan-1-one is (CH2)2CH-CO. Wait, perhaps it's (CH2)3-C=O, but that would be pentan-2-one. Wait, I'm getting stuck; perhaps it's better to think of it as (cyclopentyl) attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH2CH3) ?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The correct structure for 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one is: the carbonyl group is on carbon 1, which is attached to a cyclopentyl group and a methyl group. So, the structure would be:

O
||
C(CH2CH2CH3)(cyclopentyl)

Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. So, the carbonyl is on the first carbon. So, the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3?)

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The carbonyl is on the first carbon, which is attached to a cyclopentyl group and a methyl group. So, the molecule is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH(CH3)CH2CH3)

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The structure is:

cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that would be butan-2-one with substituents.

Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is:

The carbonyl is at position 1, so the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH(CH3)CH2CH3)

Wait, I'm not getting this right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon, and a methyl group on the adjacent carbon. So, the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3)

But perhaps it's better to think about the molecule's structure in terms of chirality. So, the question is whether this molecule has a chiral center.

The carbonyl group is at C1. So, C1 is attached to:

- O (double bond),
- cyclopentyl,
- and two other substituents from the butanone.

Wait, but in 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure is:

Cyclopentyl group attached to C1 (the carbonyl carbon), and on the same carbon (C1), perhaps a methyl group at C3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH(CH3)CH2)

Wait, perhaps the carbonyl is at C1. So, the substituents on C1 are:

- O (double bond),
- cyclopentyl,
- and two other substituents which are CH2 groups leading to the rest of the molecule.

Wait, but let's look for a chiral center. The carbonyl carbon (C1) is double-bonded to O, so it's not a chiral center. The next carbon (C2) would be attached to C1 (carbonyl), C3, and two other substituents. Let me think: perhaps C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH3. So, the substituents on C2 would be:

- C1 (double-bonded O and cyclopentyl),
- C3 (CH(CH3)),
- and two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps C2 is CH2, so it's not a chiral center. C3 has a methyl group, so substituents could be:

- C2,
- C4 (CH3),
- CH(CH3),
- and another substituent.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the key is to determine if any carbon in the molecule is a chiral center. Let me think again. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure would be:

- C1: carbonyl (O double bond),
   attached to cyclopentyl and other substituents.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3)

Wait, but that would be a six-carbon chain, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3)

I'm a bit confused, but perhaps it's better to think about whether any of the carbons (other than the carbonyl) have four different substituents.

Looking at C3: in the butanone part, the structure is CH2-C(O)-R. So, C3 would be attached to:

- C2 (which is CH2),
- C4 (which is CH(CH3)),
- and two other substituents.

Wait, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Because the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are probably not chiral. Alternatively, perhaps C3 has a methyl group and other substituents.

Wait, let me imagine the structure more clearly. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Butan-1-one is:

O
||
CH2CH2CH2CH2-

But that's not possible because the carbonyl has to be between two carbons. Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, butan-1-one is:

O
||
CH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that's a ketone at the end, which is impossible). So perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the correct structure is:

The carbonyl is on C1, so the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3)

Wait, but that seems a bit long. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl group is on C3 of butanone, which is C3 relative to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Cyclopentyl group attached to C1 (carbonyl), and a methyl group on C3. So, the substituents on C3 would be:

- C2: which is CH2,
- C4: which is CH2,
- a methyl group,
- and another CH2.

Wait, that would make C3 have substituents: two CH2 groups, a methyl, and another substituent. So, perhaps it's CH2, CH2, CH3, and another CH2. Which would make two substituents the same, so C3 is not a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, making it not optically active.

Wait, but perhaps the cyclopentyl group is a substituent that's part of a ring, and the molecule has a stereogenic center elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, making it achiral.

Hmm, perhaps I should think again. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So, the carbonyl is at C1, which is attached to a cyclopentyl group and another substituent. The substituent on C1 is a cyclopentyl group and a CH2 group leading to the rest of the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH(CH3)CH2CH2)

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the chain is:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's five carbons, making it pentanone, not butanone. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck, but the key point is to determine if any carbon in the molecule is a chiral center.

Another approach: the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So, the carbonyl is at C1. The substituents on C1 are:

- O (double bond),
- cyclopentyl,
- and two CH2 groups leading to the rest of the chain.

Wait, but if the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's six carbons, which would make it hexanone, not butanone. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But I'm not confident. Perhaps it's better to think that the molecule does not have any chiral centers, so it's not chiral. Alternatively, perhaps there's a chiral center somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps the cyclopentyl group is attached to a carbon that has four different substituents. For example, if the cyclopentyl group is attached to a carbon that's connected to three other different groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Given the confusion, perhaps the answer is that this molecule is not chiral, so it doesn't exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but I'm not confident in this analysis. Let me try to think differently. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let's imagine the carbonyl at C1, which is attached to a cyclopentyl group and a CH2 group. The CH2 group is connected to C2, which is connected to C3 (which has a methyl group), and so on. So, the substituents on C1 are:

- O (double bond),
- cyclopentyl,
- CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but I don't see any chiral centers here. The carbonyl carbon (C1) isn't a chiral center because it's double-bonded. The other carbons don't seem to have four different substituents. For example, C3 has a methyl group, but perhaps the substituents are CH2, CH2, CH3, and another CH2. So, no, no chiral centers. Therefore, this molecule isn't chiral and won't exhibit optical activity.

Now, let me summarize:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers. Not chiral. No optical activity.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Has stereogenic centers. Chiral. Yes.
3. (2R,3S)-...: Meso compound. Not chiral. No.
4. (2R,3R)-...: No chiral centers. No.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Chiral center at C1. Yes.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Chiral. Yes.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No chiral centers. No.

So, the count is:

- Compound 2: Yes (1)
- Compound 5: Yes (2)
- Compound 6: Yes (3)

Wait, but wait, I thought compound 6 might be achiral. Let me recheck. If all three OH groups are on the same face, the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meso compound. But with three stereocenters, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, another approach: the molecule (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. If all OHs are on the same face, then there's no plane of symmetry. Because if you try to draw a plane through the ring, the substituents won't mirror each other. So, the molecule would be chiral, thus exhibit optical activity.

So, for the seven compounds:

1. No
2. Yes
3. No
4. No
5. Yes
6. Yes
7. No

Wait, but earlier I thought compound 6 is chiral, so yes. That makes three yeses: compounds 2,5,6.

Wait, but earlier I thought compound 6 is chiral, yes. So three compounds exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but looking back, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recount:

Compound 2: Yes → 1
Compound 5: Yes → 2
Compound 6: Yes → 3
Total: 3.

But wait, the options don't have option B as 3, but looking back, the options are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, in the initial analysis:

Compound 2: yes.

Compound 5: yes.

Compound 6: yes.

That's three. But another possibility is that compound 7 is chiral, but I'm not sure. Wait, earlier I thought it wasn't. So, perhaps only three are chiral. But let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 6. Let me think again.

Compound 6: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol.

The positions are 1,3,5. If all hydroxyls are s configuration, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me imagine the ring. Each OH is on the same face. The ring is symmetric in a way that each OH is opposite another. Wait, but 1,3,5 are alternate positions, so each is 120 degrees apart. If all are on the same face, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold axis of symmetry but no plane of symmetry. So, perhaps it's chiral.

Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, perhaps it's achiral. But I'm not sure. Another way: if the molecule is a meso compound, it would be achiral. But meso compounds typically have an even number of stereocenters, but this has three, which complicates things. So, perhaps this molecule is indeed chiral, making it three yeses.

But wait, I might have missed another compound. Let me check:

Wait, what about the (3aR,7aS,E) compound? It's a bicyclic structure, and the E configuration suggests a double bond. The presence of stereogenic centers (3aR and 7aS) implies that the molecule is chiral. So that's definitely yes.

So, I think there are three compounds that are chiral: 2, 5, and 6.

Wait, but wait, what about the (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol? That's definitely chiral, yes, so that's yes.

So, three compounds exhibit optical activity. So the answer is option B)3.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 3. So the answer would be B.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is chiral if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or exhibits internal asymmetry, preventing it from being superimposable on its mirror image.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound is an alkene with a double bond between C1 and C2. Neither C1 nor C2 is a chiral center because they are part of the double bond and do not have four different substituents. Additionally, no other carbons in the molecule are chiral centers. Therefore, this compound is not chiral and does not exhibit optical activity.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This is a complex bicyclic compound with specific stereochemistry at the 3aR and 7aS positions. These stereogenic centers make the molecule chiral, and the presence of the double bond with E configuration does not affect chirality. This compound is chiral and exhibits optical activity.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Succinic acid has the structure HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. In the 2,3-dimethyl derivative, both C2 and C3 have two identical methyl groups, making them unable to be chiral centers. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and achiral. This compound does not exhibit optical activity.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Similar to the (2R,3S) isomer, this compound has two identical methyl groups on both C2 and C3, preventing them from being chiral centers. The molecule remains achiral due to its symmetry. This compound does not exhibit optical activity.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   This compound is a cyclohexane ring with an -OH group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. The -OH group on C1 makes it a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: the hydroxyl group, two distinct CH2 groups from the ring, and a hydrogen atom. This compound is chiral and exhibits optical activity.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5 of a cyclohexane ring, all in the s configuration. The alternating positions of the hydroxyl groups create an asymmetrical arrangement, and the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. This makes it chiral and capable of exhibiting optical activity.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   This compound has a cyclopentyl group and a methyl group attached to a ketone at C1. The carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center due to the double bond, and no other carbons in the molecule have four different substituents. This compound is not chiral and does not exhibit optical activity.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**, **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**, and **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**. Thus, **3 compounds** exhibit optical activity.

Answer: B

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this question about optical activity in organic compounds. Hmm, optical activity means the compound can rotate plane-polarized light, right? That usually happens when a molecule has chirality, which is when it's not superimposable on its mirror image. So, I need to figure out which of these compounds are chiral.

Let me go through each compound one by one.

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**
Wait, this is an alkene with a substituent on each carbon. The configuration is Z, so the higher priority groups are on the same side. But does this make the molecule chiral? Well, for a molecule to be chiral, it needs to have a chiral center. A chiral center is a carbon with four different substituents. Let's see: the structure is CH2Cl-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but wait no, wait. Wait, but it's 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene. So the structure is ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2? No, wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but wait, no, it's 2-methyl. Hmm, maybe the structure is Cl attached to the first carbon, and a double bond between C1 and C2, with a methyl on C2. So it's Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait. Wait, but but-1-ene is CH2=CHCH2CH3. So 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3? Wait, no, wait, no, 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl attached to C1, a double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl on C2. So structure: CH2Cl is the first carbon, then double bond to C2 which has a methyl and another CH2 group. Wait, so the structure would be ClCH2-C(CH3)=CH2. Wait, but wait, but the molecule is 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene, which would be Cl on C1, and a methyl on C2, with double bond between C1 and C2. So the structure is Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps it's CH2Cl connected to a double bond CH(CH3)-CH2? Hmm, maybe I should draw it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's Cl attached to a double bond. Wait, but the double bond is between C1 and C2. So if it's but-1-ene, the structure is CH2=CHCH2CH3. 1-chloro would be ClCH2-CH2CH2CH3, but that's not a double bond. Wait, no: 1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene would be Cl on C1, double bond between C1 and C2, and a methyl on C2. So C1 is Cl, double bonded to C2 which has a methyl and another CH2 group. Wait, but but-1-ene is four carbons. So C1: Cl attached, double bond to C2, which has a methyl and another CH2 group. So the structure would be Cl-CH2-C(CH3)=CH2? Wait, no, wait no. Or wait, maybe the structure is Cl on C1, and C2 has a methyl and a CH2 group, but that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is Cl-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3, but with a double bond between C1 and C2. Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think about the possibility of chirality.

Alternatively, let's think about the molecule. If it's but-1-ene with 1-chloro and 2-methyl, then the structure is (Z) configuration. So the substituents on C1 and C2. Wait, but wait, for a molecule to be chiral, it must have a chiral center. Does this molecule have a chiral center? Let's think about each carbon. C1 is Cl, CH2, double bond, and another substituent. Wait, C1 would have Cl, two Hs, and the double bond. So it's CH2Cl, but since it's a double bond, perhaps that's a double bond to a CH group. Wait, but C1 is connected to Cl, two Hs, and a double bond to C2. So C1 has two H's, Cl, and double bond to C2. So no, C1 is not a chiral center because it's double-bonded, so it's not a tetrahedral center. C2 has a double bond, a methyl, and two more substituents? Wait, but if C2 has a double bond, then its substituents are CH(CH3), so maybe it's CH(CH3) connected via double bond. So, I don't think either C1 or C2 are chiral centers. Then, what about the other carbons? C3 and C4? C3 has two CH2 groups perhaps, so probably identical substituents. So no chiral centers. Thus, this compound is not chiral. So it won't exhibit optical activity.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**
Hmm, that's a bit complex. Let me parse the name. It's a bicyclic compound, maybe. Methanoisobenzofuran suggests a ring structure with a fused ring. The substituent is chloromethylene, which is a CH2Cl group attached as a double bond? Wait, chloromethylene is Cl2C= but wait, no. Wait, chloromethylene would be CH2Cl as a substituent, but wait, no. Wait, methylene is CH2, so chloromethylene is CH2Cl? No, wait, chloromethylene is more like Cl2C=, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a substituent where a CH2Cl is attached as a double bond. Wait, perhaps the structure is part of a ring, like a furan or similar.

Wait, but in any case, the molecule has specific stereochemistry. The (3aR,7aS,E) indicates that the molecule has stereogenic centers and a double bond with E configuration. So, if the molecule has stereogenic centers, it could be chiral. Also, because it's a complex bicyclic structure, perhaps it's not planar, and has multiple stereocenters. So, this molecule probably is chiral and will exhibit optical activity.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
Succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would have methyl groups on the 2nd and 3rd carbons. So the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. Wait, no, wait: succinic acid is four carbons: O=C-O-CH2-CH2-O-C=O. Wait, no, actually, succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. So 2,3-dimethyl would be HOOC-C(CH3)H-CH(CH3)H-COOH. Wait, but with the R and S configurations. So each of the 2 and 3 carbons have two methyl groups, a hydrogen, and two carboxylic acid groups. Wait, so each of these carbons would have four substituents: the two CH3, two COOH groups? No, wait, the structure would be:

HOOC-CH(CH3)(S)-CH(CH3)(R)-COOH.

Wait, but wait, each of these carbons (C2 and C3) is connected to:

C2: CH(CH3) with substituents: CH3, CH(CH3), COOH, and another COOH? No, let me think again. The structure of succinic acid is HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. When you have 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid, each of the middle CH2 groups becomes CH(CH3). So C2 is CH(CH3), and C3 is CH(CH3).

Each of these carbons (C2 and C3) has:

- Two CH(CH3) groups (but wait, no, that's not right. Each of the middle carbons is CH(CH3) connected to the two COOH groups.

Wait, no: C2 is connected to C1 (COOH), C3, two CH3 groups? No, wait, the formula is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has:

C2: substituents are CH3, CH(CH3), COOH, and CH(CH3). Wait, let me think about the substituents on C2. So C2 is attached to:

- One COOH group (from C1),
- One CH(CH3) group (the C3),
- Two CH3 groups.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, C2 is CH(CH3), so it's connected to:

- C1 (COOH),
- C3 (CH(CH3)),
- Two methyl groups (CH3).

Wait, no, that's not possible because CH(CH3) would have three substituents: two CH3 and a CH2? Wait, no, let me get the structure right. 

Actually, in the molecule, each of C2 and C3 in 2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid would have the following substituents:

C2: connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), and two methyl groups (CH3). So substituents are CH3, CH3, COOH, and CH(CH3). Wait, that's four substituents: two CH3, a COOH, and a CH(CH3). But wait, CH(CH3) is a carbon itself, so that's a bit confusing.

Wait, no. Let's think about the structure again. The molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) is a carbon connected as follows:

- C2: connected to C1 (COOH), C3 (CH(CH3)), a methyl group (CH3), and another methyl group (CH3). Wait, so both C2 and C3 have two CH3 groups, a COOH (for C2, it's from C1; for C3, it's from C4), and another CH(CH3). So in that case, each of C2 and C3 has two methyl groups, one COOH group, and a CH(CH3) group. Wait, but that would make four substituents: two CH3, one COOH, and another CH(CH3). So for each, the substituents are CH3, CH3, COOH, and CH(CH3). Wait, but wait, that's four substituents. But wait, if a carbon has two identical substituents (like two CH3), then it cannot be a chiral center because a chiral center needs four different substituents. Oh wait, but wait, if the substituents are CH3 ×2, then two substituents are same. So each of C2 and C3 has two CH3 groups, making their substituents not all different. So, the molecule (2R,3S) would have C2 and C3 as stereogenic centers? Wait, but wait, can a carbon with two identical substituents be a stereogenic center? Because if two substituents are the same, the arrangement might not allow for chirality. So, for example, if a carbon has two CH3 groups, a COOH, and a CH(CH3), then two substituents are same. So the substituents are: CH3, CH3, COOH, and CH(CH3). So the carbon has two identical groups. So, that's two substituents the same. Therefore, such a carbon cannot be a chiral center because it doesn't have four different substituents. Hence, the molecule (2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it won't exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH. So each of the middle carbons (C2 and C3) has:

- Two methyl groups (CH3),
- One -CH(CH3) group (for C2, it's connected to C3, which is -CH(CH3), and for C3, connected to C2),
- One carboxylic acid group (COOH).

Wait, no, that's not right. Each C is connected to two other carbons (C1 and C3 for C2, and C2 and C4 for C3), each of which has a COOH group. So, for C2, substituents are:

- CH3,
- CH3,
- COOH (from C1),
- CH(CH3) (which is part of C3, but that's a carbon with two CH3 groups and a COOH).

Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong. Another way: for a carbon to be chiral, it must have four distinct groups. Let's look at C2:

The groups attached are:

1. -CH(CH3) (the group from C3),
2. -COOH (from C1),
3. Two CH3 groups.

So, two of the substituents are CH3. So the carbon has two identical groups, so it's not a chiral center. Same for C3. So, the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Therefore, it's not chiral, so no optical activity.

Wait, but the question states that the compound is (2R,3S). If both C2 and C3 are stereocenters, but my analysis says they aren't, then maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is chiral because the arrangement creates some kind of internal asymmetry, but I don't think so. Because without any chiral centers, the molecule can't be chiral. So, I think this compound is not chiral and won't show optical activity.

Wait, but wait, another thought: maybe the molecule is a meso compound. Meso compounds have stereocenters but are achiral due to a plane of symmetry. For example, tartaric acid is a meso compound when both stereocenters are R and S. So in this case, if the molecule (2R,3S) is a meso form, then it's not chiral. Let me check that.

If the molecule is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, and the stereocenters are C2 (R) and C3 (S), would there be a plane of symmetry? Let's imagine the molecule: the two methyl groups on C2 and C3, and the two COOH groups. If the configuration is R on C2 and S on C3, would that create a plane of symmetry? Well, the molecule would have a center of inversion perhaps. Let me think: if you have two stereocenters, and the configurations are opposite, and the molecule has a plane of symmetry, then it's a meso compound. In this case, the two stereocenters are on adjacent carbons, and the substituents are arranged symmetrically. So I think this is a meso compound, making it achiral. So, this compound doesn't exhibit optical activity.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**
Same base structure as compound 3, but with both stereocenters as R. So, let's analyze. Again, the structure is HOOC-CH(CH3)-CH(CH3)-COOH, with C2 and C3 as R and R.

Wait, but earlier analysis shows that each of C2 and C3 has two CH3 groups, so their substituents are CH3, CH3, COOH, and CH(CH3). So, again, each would have two identical substituents. So, even if both are R configuration, the substituents are not all different. Thus, each carbon isn't a chiral center. So, this compound also has no chiral centers. Therefore, it's not chiral. So, no optical activity.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let's imagine the molecule. If the substituents on C2 are CH3, CH3, COOH, and CH(CH3), then perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. But in this case, with both stereocenters being R, would that make it a meso compound? Wait, no, because if the configurations are both R, then the molecule would lack a plane of symmetry. Wait, but earlier in compound 3, the configurations were R and S, which made it a meso compound. In this case, both R and R would not have a plane of symmetry, so the molecule would be chiral. Wait, but without chiral centers, can the molecule be chiral? No, wait, no. Because each of the carbons isn't a chiral center. So, even if the configurations are R and R, each carbon isn't a stereocenter because two substituents are same. So, the molecule as a whole isn't chiral. Therefore, no optical activity.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think again: If a carbon has two identical substituents, it can't be a stereocenter. So, if both C2 and C3 are CH(CH3) with two CH3 groups, then each has two identical substituents. So, regardless of the configuration, they can't be stereocenters. Thus, the molecule has no chiral centers. So, compounds 3 and 4 don't exhibit optical activity.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**
This is an alcohol with a cyclohexene ring. The substituents would be the OH on C1, and a double bond between C3 and C4? Wait, cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: the double bond is between C3 and C4, and the OH is on C1. So the structure is a six-membered ring with a double bond and an OH group. The (R) configuration indicates that the OH is in a specific position.

Now, for a cyclohexene ring, is the molecule chiral? Well, the cyclohexene ring could have a stereogenic center at C1. Let me think about the substituents on C1: OH, two CH2 groups (adjacent carbons), and the cyclohexene ring. Wait, no. Wait, the structure of cyclohex-3-en-1-ol would have the OH on C1. Each carbon in the ring is connected to two other carbons in the ring. So, C1 is connected to C2 and C6, and also has the OH group and a CH2 group (from the ring). Wait, no, in a cyclohexane ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent carbons in the ring and two other substituents. So, for C1, the substituents are:

- OH group,
- The ring (so two CH2 groups, but that might not count as substituents in the same way).

Wait, no. Each carbon in the ring has two ring substituents and two other substituents. So on C1, the substituents are OH, two CH2 groups (from the ring), and the double bond? Wait, no, the double bond is on C3 and C4. So, perhaps C1's substituents are OH, two CH2 groups, and another CH group.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me approach this differently. For a molecule to be chiral, it must have at least one chiral center. So, does C1 in this molecule have four different substituents?

C1 is attached to:

- OH,
- The ring (so connected to C2 and C6),
- And the rest: perhaps two CH2 groups or something else.

Wait, in a cyclohexene ring, the double bond is between C3 and C4, so the structure would have C1 with substituents: OH, and three other substituents that are part of the ring. But in a ring, each carbon is connected to two adjacent ring carbons, and two other substituents. So, for C1 in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, the substituents would be:

- OH,
- CH2- (to C2),
- CH2- (to C6),
- And the other substituent would be a CH group that's part of the ring? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, perhaps C1 has the following substituents:

- OH,
- -CH2-CH2- (from C2 and C6),
- and two other substituents that are part of the ring, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is such that C1 has four different substituents. Let me imagine the structure. The ring is cyclohexene, so it's a six-membered ring with a double bond between C3 and C4. The OH is on C1. So, the substituents around C1 would be:

- OH,
- The ring (so, connected to C2 and C6),
- A hydrogen, perhaps?

Wait, no, cyclohexane is a six-membered ring, each carbon is CH2, except when there are substituents. So, in cyclohex-3-en-1-ol, C1 has an OH group, and the other substituents are CH2 groups connected to the ring. So, C1 would have substituents: OH, CH2 (to C2), CH2 (to C6), and a hydrogen. Wait, but that would make four different substituents: OH, CH2CH2..., etc. Wait, no, that's not possible because if C1 is connected to two CH2 groups (to C2 and C6), but those CH2 groups are part of the ring. So, for the substituents, C1 has:

- OH,
- Two CH2 groups (each connected to adjacent ring carbons), and
- A hydrogen.

Wait, but wait, a cyclohexene ring has a double bond between C3 and C4. So, the structure is:

C1: OH, connected to C2 and C6.
C2: connected to C1 and C3.
C3: double bond to C4.
C4: double bond to C3, connected to C5.
C5: connected to C4 and C6.
C6: connected to C5 and C1.

So, each of the ring carbons (except C3 and C4) is a CH2 group. So, C1 has substituents: OH, two CH2 groups (from C2 and C6), and a single hydrogen. So, the substituents on C1 are OH, two CH2 groups, and H. But wait, CH2 groups are the same as each other? No, because C2 is connected to a CH2 group that's part of the ring, which has the double bond at C3. So, are the substituents on C1 all different?

Wait, C1 is attached to:

- OH,
- CH2-C (which is C2, which is connected to C3, part of the double bond),
- CH2-C (which is C6, connected to C5, which is connected to C4, part of the double bond),
- and a hydrogen.

So, the substituents on C1 are:

1. OH,
2. CH2-C (ring, with C2 adjacent to double bond),
3. CH2-C (ring, with C6 adjacent to double bond),
4. H.

Wait, but are the two CH2 substituents (from C2 and C6) different? Because the rest of the ring is arranged with a double bond, so perhaps the substituents from C2 and C6 are in different environments, making them different. So, if that's the case, then C1 has four different substituents: OH, two different CH2 groups (since they're attached to different parts of the ring), and a hydrogen. Thus, C1 is a chiral center. Therefore, the molecule (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol is chiral and will exhibit optical activity.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**
This is a cyclohexane ring with hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5. All are in the s configuration. Let me think about the structure. If the hydroxyl groups are on positions 1, 3, and 5, all in the same (s) configuration, then the molecule's symmetry could determine its chirality.

Wait, cyclohexane has six carbons. Positions 1, 3, and 5 are alternate carbons, so they form an alternating pattern. If all three hydroxyls are on s configuration, then perhaps there's a plane of symmetry.

Wait, for a molecule to be chiral, it needs to lack a plane of symmetry. So, if all three OH groups are in the same configuration, and arranged symmetrically, the molecule might be achiral. But wait, the positions 1,3,5 are all alternate, so they form a trigonal symmetric arrangement. So, if all three OH groups are on the same face (all R or all S), would that make the molecule have a plane of symmetry?

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Let me imagine the structure. If the OH groups are all axial or all equatorial, and arranged in a way that the molecule has a plane of symmetry. Wait, but the molecule is a cyclohexane ring with three hydroxyls.

Wait, perhaps the molecule is superimposable on its mirror image. Alternatively, maybe it has a center of inversion. Let's think: it's 1,3,5-cyclohexane triol, all S configuration. So, the OH groups are on C1, C3, C5, all in the same direction. Would that create a chiral molecule? Or would the symmetry make it achiral?

Wait, in a cyclohexane ring with three substituents at 1,3,5 positions, all in the same configuration, the molecule might have a plane of symmetry. For example, if you imagine a plane passing through the center of the ring, perpendicular to the plane of the ring, then perhaps this would be a plane of symmetry. So, if the substituents are arranged symmetrically, the molecule would be achiral.

Alternatively, if the substituents are all on the same face, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion. For example, if each substituent is mirrored across the center, making it a meso compound.

Wait, but wait, if all three substituents are in the same configuration, then the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry. Let me think of a similar structure, like 1,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane. If all three methyl groups are on the same face, then the molecule is chiral because there's no plane of symmetry. Because any plane would have to mirror the positions, but with three substituents, it's impossible to have a plane that would mirror all three. So, perhaps this molecule is chiral.

Wait, but I'm not so sure. Let me think again. The molecule is (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. If all three OH groups are in the same configuration, then perhaps the molecule is chiral. Let me imagine: the ring is flat, with each OH on the same face. Then, looking from the top, the OHs are at 12, 4, and 8 o'clock positions. If all are on the same side, the molecule may not have a plane of symmetry because there's no mirror line that could reflect all three. So, perhaps this molecule is chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is meso due to having a plane of symmetry. Wait, for a molecule to be meso, it must have multiple stereocenters and a plane of symmetry. In this case, with three stereocenters, it's unclear whether a plane of symmetry exists. But I'm starting to think that this molecule is chiral.

Wait, another approach: the number of stereocenters can sometimes indicate chirality. Three stereocenters could mean the molecule is chiral, but if there's a plane of symmetry, it might not be. So, in this case, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, it's achiral, but if not, it's chiral.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a center of inversion. For cyclohexane, a center of inversion would be the center of the ring. If each substituent has a mirror image across that center, then the molecule would be achiral. So, in (1s,3s,5s), each substituent would have an opposite configuration across the center. But wait, in this case, all are s configuration, which would mean that if you invert through the center, each substituent's configuration would be opposite. So, for example, C1 (s) would have its mirror image as C4 (but C4 isn't substituted). Similarly for C3 and C5. Wait, this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is achiral because the substituents are arranged symmetrically. For example, 1,3,5-trihydroxy cyclohexane with all substituents on the same face would have a center of inversion, making it a meso compound, hence achiral. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another thought: if the molecule has three stereocenters, all in the same configuration, perhaps it's chiral. For example, if you arrange substituents in a way that there's no plane of symmetry. So, maybe this molecule is chiral. Therefore, it would exhibit optical activity.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**
The structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the 1st carbon of a butanone. So, the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-CH2-C(O)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that's not correct. Wait, butan-1-one is (CH3)2CO, but wait, no. Butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO-CH3? No, butan-1-one is CH3CH2CH2-CO. Wait, but that's not possible because the ketone is at the end. Wait, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2-CO-CH3? Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the numbering. Butan-1-one would be (CH2)3-CO. Wait, no, butan-1-one is (CH2CH2CH2)CO. No, wait, butan-1-one is CH2CH2CH2-CO, but that can't be right because the ketone is at the end. Wait, butan-1-one would be (CH3)COCH2CH2CH3? No, no, wait, butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. No, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Butan-1-one is:

O
||
CH2-CH2-CH2-CH3

Wait, no, that's pentan-2-one. Wait, no, butan-1-one would have the carbonyl at the end. So structure is:

O
||
CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-

But that doesn't make sense because the carbonyl would have to be between two carbons. So perhaps it's impossible. Alternatively, butan-1-one is (CH2)2CH-CO. Wait, perhaps it's (CH2)3-C=O, but that would be pentan-2-one. Wait, I'm getting stuck; perhaps it's better to think of it as (cyclopentyl) attached to the carbonyl carbon. So the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH2CH3) ?

Wait, no. Let me think again. The correct structure for 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one is: the carbonyl group is on carbon 1, which is attached to a cyclopentyl group and a methyl group. So, the structure would be:

O
||
C(CH2CH2CH3)(cyclopentyl)

Wait, but butan-1-one is (CH2)3-CO. So, the carbonyl is on the first carbon. So, the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3?)

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

The carbonyl is on the first carbon, which is attached to a cyclopentyl group and a methyl group. So, the molecule is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH(CH3)CH2CH3)

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

The structure is:

cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that would be butan-2-one with substituents.

Hmm, perhaps the correct structure is:

The carbonyl is at position 1, so the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH(CH3)CH2CH3)

Wait, I'm not getting this right. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a cyclopentyl group attached to the carbonyl carbon, and a methyl group on the adjacent carbon. So, the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3)

But perhaps it's better to think about the molecule's structure in terms of chirality. So, the question is whether this molecule has a chiral center.

The carbonyl group is at C1. So, C1 is attached to:

- O (double bond),
- cyclopentyl,
- and two other substituents from the butanone.

Wait, but in 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one, the structure is:

Cyclopentyl group attached to C1 (the carbonyl carbon), and on the same carbon (C1), perhaps a methyl group at C3.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH(CH3)CH2)

Wait, perhaps the carbonyl is at C1. So, the substituents on C1 are:

- O (double bond),
- cyclopentyl,
- and two other substituents which are CH2 groups leading to the rest of the molecule.

Wait, but let's look for a chiral center. The carbonyl carbon (C1) is double-bonded to O, so it's not a chiral center. The next carbon (C2) would be attached to C1 (carbonyl), C3, and two other substituents. Let me think: perhaps C2 is CH2, C3 is CH(CH3), and C4 is CH3. So, the substituents on C2 would be:

- C1 (double-bonded O and cyclopentyl),
- C3 (CH(CH3)),
- and two CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps C2 is CH2, so it's not a chiral center. C3 has a methyl group, so substituents could be:

- C2,
- C4 (CH3),
- CH(CH3),
- and another substituent.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck, but perhaps the key is to determine if any carbon in the molecule is a chiral center. Let me think again. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. The structure would be:

- C1: carbonyl (O double bond),
   attached to cyclopentyl and other substituents.

Wait, maybe the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH2CH(CH3)CH2CH3)

Wait, but that would be a six-carbon chain, perhaps. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3)

I'm a bit confused, but perhaps it's better to think about whether any of the carbons (other than the carbonyl) have four different substituents.

Looking at C3: in the butanone part, the structure is CH2-C(O)-R. So, C3 would be attached to:

- C2 (which is CH2),
- C4 (which is CH(CH3)),
- and two other substituents.

Wait, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers. Because the carbons adjacent to the carbonyl are probably not chiral. Alternatively, perhaps C3 has a methyl group and other substituents.

Wait, let me imagine the structure more clearly. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Butan-1-one is:

O
||
CH2CH2CH2CH2-

But that's not possible because the carbonyl has to be between two carbons. Maybe I'm getting the structure wrong. Alternatively, butan-1-one is:

O
||
CH2CH2CH2CH3 (but that's a ketone at the end, which is impossible). So perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, the correct structure is:

The carbonyl is on C1, so the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3)

Wait, but that seems a bit long. Alternatively, perhaps the methyl group is on C3 of butanone, which is C3 relative to the carbonyl.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Cyclopentyl group attached to C1 (carbonyl), and a methyl group on C3. So, the substituents on C3 would be:

- C2: which is CH2,
- C4: which is CH2,
- a methyl group,
- and another CH2.

Wait, that would make C3 have substituents: two CH2 groups, a methyl, and another substituent. So, perhaps it's CH2, CH2, CH3, and another CH2. Which would make two substituents the same, so C3 is not a chiral center.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule doesn't have any chiral centers, making it not optically active.

Wait, but perhaps the cyclopentyl group is a substituent that's part of a ring, and the molecule has a stereogenic center elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule is symmetric, making it achiral.

Hmm, perhaps I should think again. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So, the carbonyl is at C1, which is attached to a cyclopentyl group and another substituent. The substituent on C1 is a cyclopentyl group and a CH2 group leading to the rest of the molecule.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

O
||
C(cyclopentyl)(CH(CH3)CH2CH2)

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the chain is:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's five carbons, making it pentanone, not butanone. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck, but the key point is to determine if any carbon in the molecule is a chiral center.

Another approach: the molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. So, the carbonyl is at C1. The substituents on C1 are:

- O (double bond),
- cyclopentyl,
- and two CH2 groups leading to the rest of the chain.

Wait, but if the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's six carbons, which would make it hexanone, not butanone. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Cyclopentyl-C(=O)-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-CH3.

But I'm not confident. Perhaps it's better to think that the molecule does not have any chiral centers, so it's not chiral. Alternatively, perhaps there's a chiral center somewhere else.

Wait, perhaps the cyclopentyl group is attached to a carbon that has four different substituents. For example, if the cyclopentyl group is attached to a carbon that's connected to three other different groups. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to say. Given the confusion, perhaps the answer is that this molecule is not chiral, so it doesn't exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but I'm not confident in this analysis. Let me try to think differently. The molecule is 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one. Let's imagine the carbonyl at C1, which is attached to a cyclopentyl group and a CH2 group. The CH2 group is connected to C2, which is connected to C3 (which has a methyl group), and so on. So, the substituents on C1 are:

- O (double bond),
- cyclopentyl,
- CH2-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but I don't see any chiral centers here. The carbonyl carbon (C1) isn't a chiral center because it's double-bonded. The other carbons don't seem to have four different substituents. For example, C3 has a methyl group, but perhaps the substituents are CH2, CH2, CH3, and another CH2. So, no, no chiral centers. Therefore, this molecule isn't chiral and won't exhibit optical activity.

Now, let me summarize:

1. (Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene: No chiral centers. Not chiral. No optical activity.
2. (3aR,7aS,E)-...: Has stereogenic centers. Chiral. Yes.
3. (2R,3S)-...: Meso compound. Not chiral. No.
4. (2R,3R)-...: No chiral centers. No.
5. (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol: Chiral center at C1. Yes.
6. (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol: Chiral. Yes.
7. 1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one: No chiral centers. No.

So, the count is:

- Compound 2: Yes (1)
- Compound 5: Yes (2)
- Compound 6: Yes (3)

Wait, but wait, I thought compound 6 might be achiral. Let me recheck. If all three OH groups are on the same face, the molecule might not have a plane of symmetry, making it chiral. Alternatively, perhaps it's a meso compound. But with three stereocenters, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it achiral.

Wait, another approach: the molecule (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol. If all OHs are on the same face, then there's no plane of symmetry. Because if you try to draw a plane through the ring, the substituents won't mirror each other. So, the molecule would be chiral, thus exhibit optical activity.

So, for the seven compounds:

1. No
2. Yes
3. No
4. No
5. Yes
6. Yes
7. No

Wait, but earlier I thought compound 6 is chiral, so yes. That makes three yeses: compounds 2,5,6.

Wait, but earlier I thought compound 6 is chiral, yes. So three compounds exhibit optical activity.

Wait, but looking back, I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recount:

Compound 2: Yes → 1
Compound 5: Yes → 2
Compound 6: Yes → 3
Total: 3.

But wait, the options don't have option B as 3, but looking back, the options are A)5, B)3, C)2, D)4.

Wait, but let me double-check.

Wait, in the initial analysis:

Compound 2: yes.

Compound 5: yes.

Compound 6: yes.

That's three. But another possibility is that compound 7 is chiral, but I'm not sure. Wait, earlier I thought it wasn't. So, perhaps only three are chiral. But let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with compound 6. Let me think again.

Compound 6: (1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol.

The positions are 1,3,5. If all hydroxyls are s configuration, does the molecule have a plane of symmetry? Let me imagine the ring. Each OH is on the same face. The ring is symmetric in a way that each OH is opposite another. Wait, but 1,3,5 are alternate positions, so each is 120 degrees apart. If all are on the same face, perhaps the molecule has a three-fold axis of symmetry but no plane of symmetry. So, perhaps it's chiral.

Alternatively, if the molecule has a plane of symmetry, perhaps it's achiral. But I'm not sure. Another way: if the molecule is a meso compound, it would be achiral. But meso compounds typically have an even number of stereocenters, but this has three, which complicates things. So, perhaps this molecule is indeed chiral, making it three yeses.

But wait, I might have missed another compound. Let me check:

Wait, what about the (3aR,7aS,E) compound? It's a bicyclic structure, and the E configuration suggests a double bond. The presence of stereogenic centers (3aR and 7aS) implies that the molecule is chiral. So that's definitely yes.

So, I think there are three compounds that are chiral: 2, 5, and 6.

Wait, but wait, what about the (R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol? That's definitely chiral, yes, so that's yes.

So, three compounds exhibit optical activity. So the answer is option B)3.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 3. So the answer would be B.


To determine how many of the given compounds exhibit optical activity, we analyze each compound for chirality. A compound is chiral if it has at least one chiral center (a carbon atom bonded to four different groups) or exhibits internal asymmetry, preventing it from being superimposable on its mirror image.

### Analysis of Each Compound:

1. **(Z)-1-chloro-2-methylbut-1-ene**  
   This compound is an alkene with a double bond between C1 and C2. Neither C1 nor C2 is a chiral center because they are part of the double bond and do not have four different substituents. Additionally, no other carbons in the molecule are chiral centers. Therefore, this compound is not chiral and does not exhibit optical activity.

2. **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**  
   This is a complex bicyclic compound with specific stereochemistry at the 3aR and 7aS positions. These stereogenic centers make the molecule chiral, and the presence of the double bond with E configuration does not affect chirality. This compound is chiral and exhibits optical activity.

3. **(2R,3S)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Succinic acid has the structure HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH. In the 2,3-dimethyl derivative, both C2 and C3 have two identical methyl groups, making them unable to be chiral centers. Additionally, the molecule has a plane of symmetry, making it a meso compound and achiral. This compound does not exhibit optical activity.

4. **(2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid**  
   Similar to the (2R,3S) isomer, this compound has two identical methyl groups on both C2 and C3, preventing them from being chiral centers. The molecule remains achiral due to its symmetry. This compound does not exhibit optical activity.

5. **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**  
   This compound is a cyclohexane ring with an -OH group on C1 and a double bond between C3 and C4. The -OH group on C1 makes it a chiral center because it is bonded to four different groups: the hydroxyl group, two distinct CH2 groups from the ring, and a hydrogen atom. This compound is chiral and exhibits optical activity.

6. **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**  
   This compound has hydroxyl groups on C1, C3, and C5 of a cyclohexane ring, all in the s configuration. The alternating positions of the hydroxyl groups create an asymmetrical arrangement, and the molecule lacks a plane of symmetry. This makes it chiral and capable of exhibiting optical activity.

7. **1-cyclopentyl-3-methylbutan-1-one**  
   This compound has a cyclopentyl group and a methyl group attached to a ketone at C1. The carbonyl carbon is not a chiral center due to the double bond, and no other carbons in the molecule have four different substituents. This compound is not chiral and does not exhibit optical activity.

### Conclusion:
The compounds that exhibit optical activity are **(3aR,7aS,E)-8-(chloromethylene)hexahydro-4,7-methanoisobenzofuran-1,3-dione**, **(R)-cyclohex-3-en-1-ol**, and **(1s,3s,5s)-cyclohexane-1,3,5-triol**. Thus, **3 compounds** exhibit optical activity.

Answer: B
