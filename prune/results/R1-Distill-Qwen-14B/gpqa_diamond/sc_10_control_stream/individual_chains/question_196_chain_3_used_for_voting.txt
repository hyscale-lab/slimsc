Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is determined by the amplitude and the spring constant. The formula I recall is something like v_max = (kA/m)^0.5, where k is the spring constant, A is the amplitude, and m is the mass. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so I can't use that directly.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So the problem must involve using relativistic mechanics instead of the classical Newtonian approach. I think the relativistic energy equations will be important here.

The total energy of a harmonic oscillator in relativity should account for both kinetic and potential energy. In the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the total energy is conserved. But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Oh right, the relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total energy at maximum displacement (x = A) would be the potential energy plus the rest mass energy. Wait, the oscillator is at rest at x=A? No, wait, no. At maximum amplitude, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic.

So setting up the energy equation: The total energy E is the sum of rest energy and potential energy at x = A. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA². But wait, wait, in relativity, the potential energy is different. Or does the potential energy still follow the same form as in classical mechanics? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. I think for small oscillations, the potential can still be approximated as (1/2)kx², but this is a relativistic problem, so maybe the approach is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the classical form of potential energy because it's a maximum amplitude scenario, not necessarily considering relativistic potentials. So, E (total) = mc² + (1/2)kA².

But wait, in relativity, the total energy is also expressed in terms of the maximum kinetic energy. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the velocity is maximum, so the total energy would be the relativistic kinetic energy plus rest mass energy. So E = gamma_max mc², where gamma_max is evaluated at v_max.

Wait, let me think again. The total mechanical energy at maximum displacement (x=A) is purely potential, which is (1/2)kA². So E = (1/2)kA². But wait, no, that's the classical approach. In relativity, is the potential energy handled differently? Or is the question assuming that the potential energy is as in classical mechanics, but the kinetic energy uses the relativistic expression?

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's approach this step by step.

In the classical case, the total energy E is (1/2)kA², and this equals the maximum kinetic energy (1/2)mv_max². So solving for v_max gives (kA²/m)^(1/2), which is option C. But since this is a relativistic question, option C can't be the right answer because it's the classical solution.

So in the relativistic case, E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Wait, no. Wait, the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) should be conserved. But in this case, potential is (1/2)kx² and kinetic is relativistic.

Wait, perhaps the energy equation is: At maximum displacement, all energy is potential, which is (1/2)kA². So E = (1/2)kA². But that can't be, because the rest energy is mc². Unless we're considering the total energy as the sum of rest energy plus kinetic and potential. Hmm, that's getting more confusing.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², same as in the classical case. The kinetic energy is relativistic, so (gamma -1)mc². Then the total energy E is (gamma -1)mc² + (1/2)kx². At maximum displacement, x = A, so velocity is zero, so gamma is 1. So E = 0 + (1/2)kA². But wait, that can't be right because E should also include the rest energy.

Wait, perhaps the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and the mechanical energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA². Then, when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So E = gamma mc². So equating these two expressions:

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA²

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)

So gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's write that:

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max^2/c^2)) ) = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)

Let me denote (kA²)/(2mc²) as a term for simplicity. Let's call it B. So B = (kA²)/(2mc²). Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) = 1 + B

We can rearrange this equation to solve for v.

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

1/(1 - (v^2/c^2)) ) = (1 + B)^2

Which leads to:

1 - (v^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + B)^2

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1+B)^2 ]

= [ (1+B)^2 - 1 ] / (1+B)^2

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2B + B²) - 1 = 2B + B²

So,

v²/c² = (2B + B²) / (1 + B)^2

But B is (kA²)/(2mc²), which is small if mc² >> kA², but perhaps not necessarily here.

Let me write it back:

v² = c² * (2B + B²) / (1 + B)^2

But since B is (kA²)/(2mc²), let's substitute back:

v² = c² * [ 2*(kA²)/(2mc²) + (kA²/(2mc²))² ] / [ 1 + (kA²/(2mc²)) ]^2

Let's simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator inside numerator:
2*(kA²)/(2mc²) = (kA²)/(m c²)

The second term is (kA²)^2/(4 m² c^4)

So numerator becomes (kA²/(m c²) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

Denominator is [ (2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c²) ) ]^2

Wait, let me think:

Wait, no. The denominator is (1 + B)^2 where B is (kA^2)/(2 m c^2)

So 1 + B = (2 m c^2 + kA^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Then denominator is [ (2 m c^2 + kA²) / (2 m c²) ) ]^2

So the entire expression becomes:

v² = c² * [ (k A^2/(m c^2) ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m² c^4) ) ]

Wait, let me compute denominator:

Denominator is [ (2 mc² + kA²)/(2 mc²) ) ]² = [ (2 mc² + k A² ) ]² / (4 m² c^4 )

So when we divide by that denominator, it's equivalent to multiplying by [4 m² c^4 ] / (2 mc² + k A² )^2.

So putting it all together:

v² = c² * [ ( (k A²)/(m c²) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] * [4 m² c^4 ) ] / (2 mc² + k A² )^2 )

This is getting a bit messy, but let's compute each term step by step.

Let me factor out (k A^2)/(4 m² c^4) from the numerator inside the first bracket:

Wait, perhaps it's easier to factor in the 4 m² c^4.

Wait, the numerator inside the first bracket is:

(k A^2)/(m c²) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) 

= [ (4 m c² k A^2 ) + k² A^4 ] / (4 m² c^4 )

Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute:

Let me get a common denominator of 4 m² c^4:

First term: (k A²)/(m c² ) = (4 m c² k A^2 ) / (4 m² c^4 )

Second term: (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

So adding them:

[4 m c² k A^2 + k² A^4 ] / (4 m² c^4 )

So the numerator of the entire expression is this.

So putting it all together:

v² = c² * [ (4 m c² k A^2 + k² A^4 ) / (4 m² c^4 ) ] * [4 m² c^4 ] / (2 mc² + k A^2 )^2 )

Simplify:

The 4 m² c^4 in the numerator of the first fraction cancels with the denominator in the second fraction.

So,

v² = c² * (4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 ) / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 

Hmm, can I factor anything out from the numerator?

Factor out k A² from numerator:

= c² * [ k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 

Wait, because 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 = k A² (4 m c² + k A^2 )

So now,

v² = c² * [k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 

Wait, but 4 m c² is 2*(2 m c²), so 4 m c² + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c²) ) + k A^2.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, notice that denominator is (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2.

So let me write it as:

v² = c² * [k A^2 (2*(2 m c²) ) + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check: 4 m c² is 2*(2 m c²). Hmm.

Wait, the numerator is (4 m c² + k A²) = 2*(2 m c²) + k A².

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor the denominator as 2 m c² + k A². Let me see:

Suppose I write the denominator as (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2.

The numerator is k A² (4 m c² + k A^2 ). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps we can express the numerator as 4 m c² + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c²) + k A^2.

But not sure. Alternatively, think about the numerator as (2 m c² + k A^2 ) + 2 m c².

So 4 m c² + k A² = (2 m c² + k A² ) + 2 m c².

Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps to find v in terms of gamma.

Wait, from earlier, I had gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

And gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

So solving for v:

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(gamma^2) )

Substituting gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - [ 1/( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 ) ] )

Let me compute this expression.

Let me write it as:

v = c * sqrt( [ ( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 -1 ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

The numerator is (1 + 2*(k A²)/(2 m c² ) + (k A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )) - 1

Which simplifies to (k A²)/(m c²) + (k A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A²/(m c²) ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Which can be factored as:

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A²/(m c²) ) (1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 )) ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, but this seems complicated. Let me factor out (k A²/(m c² )) from the numerator:

= c * sqrt( [ (k A²/(m c^2 )) * (1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 )) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] )

Hmm. Let me think about simplifying. Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) as x.

So x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Then,

(k A^2/(m c^2 )) = 2 x

(k A^2/(4 m c^2 )) = x/2

So substituting:

v = c * sqrt( [ (2x) (1 + x/2) ] / (1 + x )^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ 2x (1 + x/2) ] / (1 + x )^2 )

Expanding numerator: 2x + x²

Denominator: (1 + x )^2 = 1 + 2x + x²

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2x + x²) / (1 + 2x + x²) )

Factor numerator and denominator:

numerator: x(2 + x )

denominator: (1 + x )^2

Hmm, but not sure. So,

v = c * sqrt( x (2 + x ) / (1 + x )^2 )

= c * sqrt( x (2 + x ) ) / (1 + x )

But x is (k A^2)/(2 m c² ), which is small if k A^2 << 2 m c². But perhaps in general, it's better to express it as:

v = c * sqrt( x (2 + x ) ) / (1 + x )

But perhaps I can factor this differently.

Wait, let's consider that (2 + x) = (1 + x) + 1.

Not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as x = (k A^2)/(2 m c² ), which is similar to the expression in the denominator.

Wait, but this seems to be taking me in circles. Maybe I should go back to the initial equation and see if there's a different approach.

Wait, earlier I had:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which I can write as:

gamma = 1 + x, where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So,

v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2) ) = c * sqrt( (gamma^2 -1)/gamma^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( (gamma^2 -1) ) / gamma

But gamma^2 = 1 + 2x + x², so gamma^2 - 1 = 2x + x².

Thus,

v = c * sqrt( 2x + x² ) / (1 + x )

But sqrt(2x + x² ) = sqrt( x (x + 2) )

Hmm. Not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I should express the entire v in terms of gamma.

Wait, gamma = 1 + x, so x = gamma - 1.

So,

v = c * sqrt( 2(gamma -1 ) + (gamma -1 )^2 ) / gamma

= c * sqrt( 2 gamma -2 + gamma² - 2 gamma +1 ) / gamma 

Wait, let me compute the numerator inside the sqrt:

2(gamma-1) + (gamma-1)^2 = 2 gamma -2 + gamma² - 2 gamma +1

= gamma² -1.

So,

v = c * sqrt( gamma² -1 ) / gamma 

But sqrt( gamma² -1 ) is sqrt( (1/(1 -v²/c²)) -1 )

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute sqrt(gamma^2 -1):

sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ) = sqrt( (1/(1 - v²/c² )) -1 )

= sqrt( (1 - (1 - v^2/c² )) / (1 - v²/c²) ) )

= sqrt( v²/c² / (1 - v²/c² ) )

= v/(c sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) )

Wait, but maybe I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ) = sqrt( (gamma-1)(gamma+1) )

But perhaps another approach: since gamma = 1 + x,

sqrt(gamma² -1 ) = sqrt( (1 + x )^2 - 1 ) = sqrt( 1 + 2x +x² -1 ) = sqrt(2x +x² )

So,

v = c * sqrt(2x +x²) / (1 +x )

Which is where I was before.

Hmm. Perhaps there's a way to factor this expression.

Note that 2x +x² = x(x + 2 )

But denominator is (1 + x)^2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express 2x + x² as x + (x +x ) + x², but not helpful.

Wait, maybe I should just compute 2x + x² = x (2 +x )

Denominator is (1 + x )^2.

So,

sqrt( x (2 +x ) ) / (1 +x )

Hmm, but perhaps we can write this as sqrt( x (2 + x ) ) / (1 +x ) = sqrt( x (2 +x ) ) / (sqrt( (1 +x )^2 ) )

= sqrt( [x (2 +x ) ] / ( (1 +x )^2 ) )

= sqrt( x (2 +x ) ) / (1 +x )

Not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can factor (2 +x ) as (1 +x ) +1.

So,

( x ( (1 +x ) +1 ) ) = x (1 +x ) + x 

So,

sqrt( x(1 +x ) + x ) / (1 +x )

= sqrt( x(1+x) (1 + 1/(1+x) )) / (1 +x )

But that seems more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution. Let me let y = x.

So, I have:

v = c * sqrt( y ( y + 2 ) ) / (1 + y )

But not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look back at the multiple-choice options and see which one fits.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ))^2 )

Wait, the denominator inside is (1 - (k A^2)/(2m) ). Then 1/(1 - ... )^2. Hmm.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, denominator is (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ), and inside the square root, it's 1 + 1/( ... )

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Hmm, 1 - 1/( ... )

I think I should express v in terms of the options.

From earlier, I have:

v^2 = c^2 [ (k A²)/(m c² ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ) ] * [4 m^2 c^4 ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

Wait, no, that's getting messy.

Alternatively, from the expression gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

We have v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 )

Which is v = c * sqrt(1 - [1 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] )

Let me compute 1 - [1 / (1 + x )^2 ] where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which is [ (1 + x )^2 -1 ] / (1 + x )^2

Expanding numerator: 1 + 2x + x² -1 = 2x + x²

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2x + x²) / (1 + x )^2 )

= c * sqrt( x (2 + x ) ) / (1 + x )

Again, same point.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this expression differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the denominator as (1 + x )^2 = (1 + x )(1 +x )

And the numerator is x (x + 2 )

Wait, but I don't see a clear way to factor this.

Wait, perhaps I can factor the numerator as x (x +2 ) = x (x + 1 +1 ) = x ( (x +1 ) +1 )

So,

= x (x +1 ) + x 

Hmm, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can write the fraction as:

x (x + 2 ) / (x +1 )^2 = [ x (x + 2 ) ] / (x² + 2x +1 )

= [ x² + 2x ] / (x² + 2x +1 )

= [ (x² + 2x +1 ) -1 ] / (x² + 2x +1 )

= 1 - 1/(x² + 2x +1 )

Wait, but x^2 + 2x +1 = (x+1)^2.

So,

= 1 - 1/(x+1 )^2

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(x+1 )^2 )

But x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( ( (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) +1 )^2 )

Which can be written as:

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Which is the same as:

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Looking at the options, this matches option D, which is:

D) v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, yes, that's exactly what I have here.

Wait, but wait, looking at option D:

Option D says: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is exactly the expression I arrived at. So the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because I derived v^2 = c^2 * [ (2x + x^2 ) ] / (1 +x )^2, where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

But from the other approach, using gamma, I arrived at option D's expression.

So, yes, option D is the correct answer.

To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and spring constant \( k \), we start by considering the conservation of energy. The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement \( x = A \). At the equilibrium point \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic, and the velocity is maximum.

### Key Equations:
1. **Total Energy at Maximum Displacement**:
   \[
   E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]
   where \( mc^2 \) is the rest energy and \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \) is the potential energy.

2. **Relativistic Kinetic Energy at Maximum Velocity**:
   \[
   E = \gamma mc^2
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( v \) is the maximum velocity.

Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we get:
\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]
Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we find:
\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]
Let \( x = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), so \( \gamma = 1 + x \). Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + x
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + x)^2
\]
Rearranging:
\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2}
\]
\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2}
\]
\[
v^2 = c^2 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2} \right)
\]
Substituting \( x = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we get:
\[
v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{(1-\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}} \)  
  This is incorrect because the denominator inside the square root does not match the derived expression, and the term \( \frac{kA^2}{2m} \) lacks the factor of \( c^2 \).

- **Option B**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{(1-\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}} \)  
  This is incorrect because the denominator inside the square root is not squared, and the structure does not match the derived expression.

- **Option C**: \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \)  
  This is the classical result and does not account for relativistic effects, so it is incorrect.

- **Option D**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{(1+\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}} \)  
  This matches the derived expression exactly and is therefore correct.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **D**.  
Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a relativistic harmonic oscillator. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking for the maximum speed of a mass attached to a spring in a relativistic context. I remember that in classical mechanics, the maximum speed of a harmonic oscillator is determined by the amplitude and the spring constant. The formula I recall is something like v_max = (kA/m)^0.5, where k is the spring constant, A is the amplitude, and m is the mass. But wait, this is a relativistic problem, so I can't use that directly.

Relativistic effects come into play when speeds are a significant fraction of the speed of light. So the problem must involve using relativistic mechanics instead of the classical Newtonian approach. I think the relativistic energy equations will be important here.

The total energy of a harmonic oscillator in relativity should account for both kinetic and potential energy. In the classical case, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², and the total energy is conserved. But in relativity, the kinetic energy isn't just (1/2)mv² anymore. Oh right, the relativistic kinetic energy is (gamma - 1)mc², where gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²).

So the total energy at maximum displacement (x = A) would be the potential energy plus the rest mass energy. Wait, the oscillator is at rest at x=A? No, wait, no. At maximum amplitude, the velocity is zero, so all the energy is potential. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the velocity is maximum, so all energy is kinetic.

So setting up the energy equation: The total energy E is the sum of rest energy and potential energy at x = A. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA². But wait, wait, in relativity, the potential energy is different. Or does the potential energy still follow the same form as in classical mechanics? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. I think for small oscillations, the potential can still be approximated as (1/2)kx², but this is a relativistic problem, so maybe the approach is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the classical form of potential energy because it's a maximum amplitude scenario, not necessarily considering relativistic potentials. So, E (total) = mc² + (1/2)kA².

But wait, in relativity, the total energy is also expressed in terms of the maximum kinetic energy. At the equilibrium point (x=0), the velocity is maximum, so the total energy would be the relativistic kinetic energy plus rest mass energy. So E = gamma_max mc², where gamma_max is evaluated at v_max.

Wait, let me think again. The total mechanical energy at maximum displacement (x=A) is purely potential, which is (1/2)kA². So E = (1/2)kA². But wait, no, that's the classical approach. In relativity, is the potential energy handled differently? Or is the question assuming that the potential energy is as in classical mechanics, but the kinetic energy uses the relativistic expression?

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's approach this step by step.

In the classical case, the total energy E is (1/2)kA², and this equals the maximum kinetic energy (1/2)mv_max². So solving for v_max gives (kA²/m)^(1/2), which is option C. But since this is a relativistic question, option C can't be the right answer because it's the classical solution.

So in the relativistic case, E is the sum of rest energy and kinetic energy. Wait, no. Wait, the total mechanical energy (kinetic + potential) should be conserved. But in this case, potential is (1/2)kx² and kinetic is relativistic.

Wait, perhaps the energy equation is: At maximum displacement, all energy is potential, which is (1/2)kA². So E = (1/2)kA². But that can't be, because the rest energy is mc². Unless we're considering the total energy as the sum of rest energy plus kinetic and potential. Hmm, that's getting more confusing.

Wait, no. Let me think again. In the relativistic harmonic oscillator, the potential energy is (1/2)kx², same as in the classical case. The kinetic energy is relativistic, so (gamma -1)mc². Then the total energy E is (gamma -1)mc² + (1/2)kx². At maximum displacement, x = A, so velocity is zero, so gamma is 1. So E = 0 + (1/2)kA². But wait, that can't be right because E should also include the rest energy.

Wait, perhaps the total energy is the sum of rest mass energy and the mechanical energy. So E = mc² + (1/2)kA². Then, when the oscillator is at x=0, all the energy is kinetic. So E = gamma mc². So equating these two expressions:

gamma mc² = mc² + (1/2)kA²

Divide both sides by mc²:

gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)

So gamma = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)

But gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). So let's write that:

1/sqrt(1 - (v_max^2/c^2)) ) = 1 + (kA²)/(2mc²)

Let me denote (kA²)/(2mc²) as a term for simplicity. Let's call it B. So B = (kA²)/(2mc²). Then,

1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) = 1 + B

We can rearrange this equation to solve for v.

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

1/(1 - (v^2/c^2)) ) = (1 + B)^2

Which leads to:

1 - (v^2/c^2) = 1/(1 + B)^2

So,

v²/c² = 1 - [1/(1+B)^2 ]

= [ (1+B)^2 - 1 ] / (1+B)^2

Expanding numerator: (1 + 2B + B²) - 1 = 2B + B²

So,

v²/c² = (2B + B²) / (1 + B)^2

But B is (kA²)/(2mc²), which is small if mc² >> kA², but perhaps not necessarily here.

Let me write it back:

v² = c² * (2B + B²) / (1 + B)^2

But since B is (kA²)/(2mc²), let's substitute back:

v² = c² * [ 2*(kA²)/(2mc²) + (kA²/(2mc²))² ] / [ 1 + (kA²/(2mc²)) ]^2

Let's simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator inside numerator:
2*(kA²)/(2mc²) = (kA²)/(m c²)

The second term is (kA²)^2/(4 m² c^4)

So numerator becomes (kA²/(m c²) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

Denominator is [ (2 m c² + k A² )/(2 m c²) ) ]^2

Wait, let me think:

Wait, no. The denominator is (1 + B)^2 where B is (kA^2)/(2 m c^2)

So 1 + B = (2 m c^2 + kA^2 )/(2 m c^2 )

Then denominator is [ (2 m c^2 + kA²) / (2 m c²) ) ]^2

So the entire expression becomes:

v² = c² * [ (k A^2/(m c^2) ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] / [ (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 / (4 m² c^4) ) ]

Wait, let me compute denominator:

Denominator is [ (2 mc² + kA²)/(2 mc²) ) ]² = [ (2 mc² + k A² ) ]² / (4 m² c^4 )

So when we divide by that denominator, it's equivalent to multiplying by [4 m² c^4 ] / (2 mc² + k A² )^2.

So putting it all together:

v² = c² * [ ( (k A²)/(m c²) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] * [4 m² c^4 ) ] / (2 mc² + k A² )^2 )

This is getting a bit messy, but let's compute each term step by step.

Let me factor out (k A^2)/(4 m² c^4) from the numerator inside the first bracket:

Wait, perhaps it's easier to factor in the 4 m² c^4.

Wait, the numerator inside the first bracket is:

(k A^2)/(m c²) ) + (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) 

= [ (4 m c² k A^2 ) + k² A^4 ] / (4 m² c^4 )

Wait, that can't be right. Let me compute:

Let me get a common denominator of 4 m² c^4:

First term: (k A²)/(m c² ) = (4 m c² k A^2 ) / (4 m² c^4 )

Second term: (k² A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

So adding them:

[4 m c² k A^2 + k² A^4 ] / (4 m² c^4 )

So the numerator of the entire expression is this.

So putting it all together:

v² = c² * [ (4 m c² k A^2 + k² A^4 ) / (4 m² c^4 ) ] * [4 m² c^4 ] / (2 mc² + k A^2 )^2 )

Simplify:

The 4 m² c^4 in the numerator of the first fraction cancels with the denominator in the second fraction.

So,

v² = c² * (4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 ) / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 

Hmm, can I factor anything out from the numerator?

Factor out k A² from numerator:

= c² * [ k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 

Wait, because 4 m c² k A² + k² A^4 = k A² (4 m c² + k A^2 )

So now,

v² = c² * [k A^2 (4 m c² + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 

Wait, but 4 m c² is 2*(2 m c²), so 4 m c² + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c²) ) + k A^2.

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, notice that denominator is (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2.

So let me write it as:

v² = c² * [k A^2 (2*(2 m c²) ) + k A^2 ) ] / (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2 

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check: 4 m c² is 2*(2 m c²). Hmm.

Wait, the numerator is (4 m c² + k A²) = 2*(2 m c²) + k A².

Wait, perhaps it's better to factor the denominator as 2 m c² + k A². Let me see:

Suppose I write the denominator as (2 m c² + k A^2 )^2.

The numerator is k A² (4 m c² + k A^2 ). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps we can express the numerator as 4 m c² + k A^2 = 2*(2 m c²) + k A^2.

But not sure. Alternatively, think about the numerator as (2 m c² + k A^2 ) + 2 m c².

So 4 m c² + k A² = (2 m c² + k A² ) + 2 m c².

Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps to find v in terms of gamma.

Wait, from earlier, I had gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

And gamma = 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c² )

So solving for v:

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(gamma^2) )

Substituting gamma:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - [ 1/( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 ) ] )

Let me compute this expression.

Let me write it as:

v = c * sqrt( [ ( (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 -1 ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

The numerator is (1 + 2*(k A²)/(2 m c² ) + (k A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )) - 1

Which simplifies to (k A²)/(m c²) + (k A^4)/(4 m² c^4 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A²/(m c²) ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m² c^4) ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Which can be factored as:

v = c * sqrt( [ (k A²/(m c²) ) (1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 )) ) ] / (1 + (k A²)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, but this seems complicated. Let me factor out (k A²/(m c² )) from the numerator:

= c * sqrt( [ (k A²/(m c^2 )) * (1 + (k A^2)/(4 m c^2 )) ] / [ (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] )

Hmm. Let me think about simplifying. Let me denote (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) as x.

So x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Then,

(k A^2/(m c^2 )) = 2 x

(k A^2/(4 m c^2 )) = x/2

So substituting:

v = c * sqrt( [ (2x) (1 + x/2) ] / (1 + x )^2 )

= c * sqrt( [ 2x (1 + x/2) ] / (1 + x )^2 )

Expanding numerator: 2x + x²

Denominator: (1 + x )^2 = 1 + 2x + x²

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2x + x²) / (1 + 2x + x²) )

Factor numerator and denominator:

numerator: x(2 + x )

denominator: (1 + x )^2

Hmm, but not sure. So,

v = c * sqrt( x (2 + x ) / (1 + x )^2 )

= c * sqrt( x (2 + x ) ) / (1 + x )

But x is (k A^2)/(2 m c² ), which is small if k A^2 << 2 m c². But perhaps in general, it's better to express it as:

v = c * sqrt( x (2 + x ) ) / (1 + x )

But perhaps I can factor this differently.

Wait, let's consider that (2 + x) = (1 + x) + 1.

Not sure if that's helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the numerator as x = (k A^2)/(2 m c² ), which is similar to the expression in the denominator.

Wait, but this seems to be taking me in circles. Maybe I should go back to the initial equation and see if there's a different approach.

Wait, earlier I had:

gamma = 1 + (k A²)/(2 m c² )

Which I can write as:

gamma = 1 + x, where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c² )

So,

v = c * sqrt(1 - (1/gamma^2) ) = c * sqrt( (gamma^2 -1)/gamma^2 ) )

= c * sqrt( (gamma^2 -1) ) / gamma

But gamma^2 = 1 + 2x + x², so gamma^2 - 1 = 2x + x².

Thus,

v = c * sqrt( 2x + x² ) / (1 + x )

But sqrt(2x + x² ) = sqrt( x (x + 2) )

Hmm. Not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I should express the entire v in terms of gamma.

Wait, gamma = 1 + x, so x = gamma - 1.

So,

v = c * sqrt( 2(gamma -1 ) + (gamma -1 )^2 ) / gamma

= c * sqrt( 2 gamma -2 + gamma² - 2 gamma +1 ) / gamma 

Wait, let me compute the numerator inside the sqrt:

2(gamma-1) + (gamma-1)^2 = 2 gamma -2 + gamma² - 2 gamma +1

= gamma² -1.

So,

v = c * sqrt( gamma² -1 ) / gamma 

But sqrt( gamma² -1 ) is sqrt( (1/(1 -v²/c²)) -1 )

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute sqrt(gamma^2 -1):

sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ) = sqrt( (1/(1 - v²/c² )) -1 )

= sqrt( (1 - (1 - v^2/c² )) / (1 - v²/c²) ) )

= sqrt( v²/c² / (1 - v²/c² ) )

= v/(c sqrt(1 - v²/c² ) )

Wait, but maybe I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, sqrt(gamma^2 -1 ) = sqrt( (gamma-1)(gamma+1) )

But perhaps another approach: since gamma = 1 + x,

sqrt(gamma² -1 ) = sqrt( (1 + x )^2 - 1 ) = sqrt( 1 + 2x +x² -1 ) = sqrt(2x +x² )

So,

v = c * sqrt(2x +x²) / (1 +x )

Which is where I was before.

Hmm. Perhaps there's a way to factor this expression.

Note that 2x +x² = x(x + 2 )

But denominator is (1 + x)^2. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express 2x + x² as x + (x +x ) + x², but not helpful.

Wait, maybe I should just compute 2x + x² = x (2 +x )

Denominator is (1 + x )^2.

So,

sqrt( x (2 +x ) ) / (1 +x )

Hmm, but perhaps we can write this as sqrt( x (2 + x ) ) / (1 +x ) = sqrt( x (2 +x ) ) / (sqrt( (1 +x )^2 ) )

= sqrt( [x (2 +x ) ] / ( (1 +x )^2 ) )

= sqrt( x (2 +x ) ) / (1 +x )

Not sure if that helps.

Wait, perhaps I can factor (2 +x ) as (1 +x ) +1.

So,

( x ( (1 +x ) +1 ) ) = x (1 +x ) + x 

So,

sqrt( x(1 +x ) + x ) / (1 +x )

= sqrt( x(1+x) (1 + 1/(1+x) )) / (1 +x )

But that seems more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution. Let me let y = x.

So, I have:

v = c * sqrt( y ( y + 2 ) ) / (1 + y )

But not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to look back at the multiple-choice options and see which one fits.

Looking at the options:

Option A: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m ))^2 )

Wait, the denominator inside is (1 - (k A^2)/(2m) ). Then 1/(1 - ... )^2. Hmm.

Option B: v_max = c * sqrt(1 + 1/(1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )

Hmm, denominator is (1 - (k A^2)/(2 m c^2) ), and inside the square root, it's 1 + 1/( ... )

Option D: v_max = c * sqrt(1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c² ))^2 )

Hmm, 1 - 1/( ... )

I think I should express v in terms of the options.

From earlier, I have:

v^2 = c^2 [ (k A²)/(m c² ) + (k^2 A^4)/(4 m^2 c^4 ) ) ] * [4 m^2 c^4 ] / (2 m c^2 + k A^2 )^2

Wait, no, that's getting messy.

Alternatively, from the expression gamma = 1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

We have v = c * sqrt(1 - 1/gamma^2 )

Which is v = c * sqrt(1 - [1 / (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 ] )

Let me compute 1 - [1 / (1 + x )^2 ] where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

Which is [ (1 + x )^2 -1 ] / (1 + x )^2

Expanding numerator: 1 + 2x + x² -1 = 2x + x²

So,

v = c * sqrt( (2x + x²) / (1 + x )^2 )

= c * sqrt( x (2 + x ) ) / (1 + x )

Again, same point.

Hmm, perhaps I can factor this expression differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the denominator as (1 + x )^2 = (1 + x )(1 +x )

And the numerator is x (x + 2 )

Wait, but I don't see a clear way to factor this.

Wait, perhaps I can factor the numerator as x (x +2 ) = x (x + 1 +1 ) = x ( (x +1 ) +1 )

So,

= x (x +1 ) + x 

Hmm, but not sure.

Wait, perhaps I can write the fraction as:

x (x + 2 ) / (x +1 )^2 = [ x (x + 2 ) ] / (x² + 2x +1 )

= [ x² + 2x ] / (x² + 2x +1 )

= [ (x² + 2x +1 ) -1 ] / (x² + 2x +1 )

= 1 - 1/(x² + 2x +1 )

Wait, but x^2 + 2x +1 = (x+1)^2.

So,

= 1 - 1/(x+1 )^2

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/(x+1 )^2 )

But x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

So,

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( ( (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ) ) +1 )^2 )

Which can be written as:

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Which is the same as:

v = c * sqrt( 1 - 1/( (1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )) )^2 )

Looking at the options, this matches option D, which is:

D) v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Wait, yes, that's exactly what I have here.

Wait, but wait, looking at option D:

Option D says: v_max = c sqrt( 1 - 1/(1 + (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 ))^2 )

Which is exactly the expression I arrived at. So the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because I derived v^2 = c^2 * [ (2x + x^2 ) ] / (1 +x )^2, where x = (k A^2)/(2 m c^2 )

But from the other approach, using gamma, I arrived at option D's expression.

So, yes, option D is the correct answer.


To determine the maximum speed \( v_{\text{max}} \) of a relativistic harmonic oscillator with mass \( m \), maximum amplitude \( A \), and spring constant \( k \), we start by considering the conservation of energy. The total energy of the system is the sum of the rest energy and the potential energy at maximum displacement \( x = A \). At the equilibrium point \( x = 0 \), all the energy is kinetic, and the velocity is maximum.

### Key Equations:
1. **Total Energy at Maximum Displacement**:
   \[
   E = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
   \]
   where \( mc^2 \) is the rest energy and \( \frac{1}{2}kA^2 \) is the potential energy.

2. **Relativistic Kinetic Energy at Maximum Velocity**:
   \[
   E = \gamma mc^2
   \]
   where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, and \( v \) is the maximum velocity.

Equating the two expressions for \( E \), we get:
\[
\gamma mc^2 = mc^2 + \frac{1}{2}kA^2
\]
Dividing through by \( mc^2 \), we find:
\[
\gamma = 1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}
\]
Let \( x = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), so \( \gamma = 1 + x \). Substituting \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \), we solve for \( v \):
\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} = 1 + x
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
\frac{1}{1 - v^2/c^2} = (1 + x)^2
\]
Rearranging:
\[
1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2}
\]
\[
\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2}
\]
\[
v^2 = c^2 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{(1 + x)^2} \right)
\]
Substituting \( x = \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2} \), we get:
\[
v = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left(1 + \frac{kA^2}{2mc^2}\right)^2}}
\]

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{(1-\frac{kA^2}{2m})^2}} \)  
  This is incorrect because the denominator inside the square root does not match the derived expression, and the term \( \frac{kA^2}{2m} \) lacks the factor of \( c^2 \).

- **Option B**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{(1-\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})}} \)  
  This is incorrect because the denominator inside the square root is not squared, and the structure does not match the derived expression.

- **Option C**: \( v_{\text{max}} = \sqrt{\frac{kA^2}{m}} \)  
  This is the classical result and does not account for relativistic effects, so it is incorrect.

- **Option D**: \( v_{\text{max}} = c\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{(1+\frac{kA^2}{2mc^2})^2}} \)  
  This matches the derived expression exactly and is therefore correct.

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **D**.  
Answer: D
