Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is often around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but when concentrations vary, I think the total amount of heat depends on the moles involved.

Wait, but the problem is mixing three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So I need to figure out how these acids and base will react when mixed.

First, let's list the acids and base:

HCl is a strong acid, monoprotic. H2SO4 is a strong acid, but it's diprotic. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; it dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH⁻ ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH⁻.

So when these are mixed, the H+ ions from the acids will react with OH⁻ ions from the base. I think the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH⁻ → H2O, and each of these releases heat, typically around 57 kJ per mole of H+ (since each mole of H+ neutralized gives about -57 kJ).

So the key here is to find out the total moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH⁻ from the base, and see which one is in excess. The limiting reagent will determine how much neutralization occurs. The heat released will be based on the moles of H+ or OH⁻ that are completely neutralized.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate moles of H+ from each acid.

For HCl:
Molarity M = 0.2 M, volume V = 500 mL = 0.5 L.
Moles HCl = M × V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol.
Since HCl is monoprotic, moles H+ = 0.1 mol.

For H2SO4:
H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole gives 2 H+ ions. Its molarity is 0.3 M, volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L.
Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol.
So moles H+ from H2SO4 = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Adding these, total H+ from acids:
0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 mol H+.

Now for the base, Ba(OH)2:
Molarity is 0.5 M, volume 200 mL = 0.2 L.
Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol.
Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH⁻. So moles OH⁻ = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

So we have 0.28 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH⁻. Since H+ is in excess, all OH⁻ will react, and some H+ will remain.

The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH⁻ → H2O. Each mole releases about 57 kJ of heat (I think the value might be positive or negative depending on the convention; since it's exothermic, it's negative).

So moles of OH⁻ is 0.2 mol, so moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2 mol.

So the heat released would be 0.2 mol * 57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ. But wait, wait, the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the units.

Wait, 57 kJ is per mole of H+ neutralized. So yes, 0.2 ×57 = 11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ. Oh, but wait, the problem says 'enthalpy of neutralization'. So the sign is important.

Wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is usually negative because it's exothermic. So the value here is -11.4 kJ? But wait, the options have B as -11.42 kcal and D as -16 kJ. Oh, but wait, I might have made a mistake in the calculation units.

Wait, 57 kJ per mole is correct? Or is it per mole of H+? Let me think: For a strong acid and strong base, the enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). So yes, each mole gives off 57 kJ.

Wait, but the problem states the enthalpy of neutralization when these are mixed. So the total heat released is 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change would be negative, so -11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is close but not exactly 11.4. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating moles.

Wait, let me check the moles again.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Since H2SO4 is diprotic, each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol H+. Correct.

Total H+ from acids: 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent.

So moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2. So the heat is 0.2 *57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. But wait, 57 kJ per mole. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options have D as -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps using the initial concentrations and considering the dilution. Wait, no, because the question is about the neutralization reaction, which would depend on moles, regardless of the concentrations. So the dilution doesn't affect the heat released, because the moles reacting are based on the initial concentrations and volumes.

Wait, but perhaps I'm miscalculating the moles. Let me see:

Wait, for H2SO4, it's 300 mL 0.3 M. 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Since each gives 2 H+, 0.18 mol H+. Correct.

Ba(OH)2 is 200 mL 0.5 M. 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So the H+ comes to 0.28 mol, OH- 0.2 mol. So OH- is the limiting.

So 0.2 mol H+ neutralized. So 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ. So the answer would be -11.4 kJ, but the options don't have that.

Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.4 ×4.184 ≈ -47.6 kJ, which doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Oh, wait a minute. Oh! I think I confused the units. Because 57 kJ is per mole, but perhaps the question is in calories or kilocalories. Oh no, wait, 1 kJ is 1000 J, and 1 kcal (Cal) is about 4184 J. So 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal (since 57000 / 4184 ≈ 13.6). So 0.2 mol *57 kJ/mol=11.4 kJ → 11.4 / 4184 ≈ 0.00272 kcal? No, wait, no. Wait, 1 kcal is 4184 J, so 11.4 kJ is 11,400 J. 11,400 /4184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So 11.4 kJ is 2.72 kcal. But the options have option B as -11.42 kcal, which would be about 47.6 kJ.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the enthalpy in kcal. Oh wait, maybe I should compute it using 57 kcal per mole? Because sometimes I've heard the enthalpy of neutralization as approximately 57 kcal per mole. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal. But wait, 57,000 J is 57 kJ, which is 57,000 / 4,184 ≈ 13.6 kcal.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) for a strong acid and strong base is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). So for each mole of H+ neutralized, it's -57 kJ.

So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, so ΔH = 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is a bit higher, but let's think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles. Let me double-check.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol. Correct. Each gives 1 H+ → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol → total 0.28 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 mol OH-.

So the OH- is 0.2, H+ is 0.28. So all OH- is used up, 0.2 H+ neutralized. So 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ.

So the answer is -11.4 kJ. But the options don't have that. Wait, the options are:

A: -2.72 kcal

B: -11.42 kcal

C: -3.80 kcal

D: -16.0 kJ

Hmm, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger than my calculated 11.4 kJ. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I missed another reaction?

Wait, wait a minute. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but when it's in solution, it dissociates completely in two steps. The first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Wait, no, wait. No, actually, the first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid, but in reality, the first dissociation is complete (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-?), but wait no, wait:

Wait, no, H2SO4 is a strong acid, but the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Wait, wait, no. Wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in water, the first proton (H+) is fully dissociated. The second proton is also dissociated because H2SO4 is a strong acid. So in solution, H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid, but in reality, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, no. Wait, no, wait. I think I got that wrong. Let me clarify.

H2SO4 is a strong acid, but the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, that can't be right because that would be 2 H+ per molecule, but in reality, the first dissociation releases 2 H+ (because it's a diprotic acid and fully ionizes). Wait, no, perhaps the first dissociation is H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^-; the second is HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-. But for H2SO4, both dissociations are strong, so it's 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+. So I think my earlier calculation is correct.

Wait, but maybe I should consider that Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but when it reacts with H2SO4, the reaction might produce BaSO4 precipitate, which is a sulfate precipitate. Because Ba^2+ and SO4^2- would form BaSO4, which is insoluble.

Oh right! That's a crucial point. So when Ba(OH)2 is mixed with H2SO4, the SO4^2- from H2SO4 will react with Ba^2+ from Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4 precipitate.

So the Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 will react in a neutralization reaction, but also forming a precipitate. This will affect the amount of OH- available for neutralizing other H+ sources.

Wait, this complicates things. So perhaps the initial approach was incorrect because I didn't account for the neutralization between Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4, which forms a precipitate and uses up some of the OH- and H+.

So I need to approach this more carefully.

Let me outline all the possible reactions.

First, when you mix HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2:

1. H2SO4 (strong acid) will dissociate completely into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

2. Ba(OH)2 (strong base) will dissociate into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-.

3. HCl will dissociate into H+ and Cl^-.

So in solution, we have a lot of H+ from HCl and H2SO4, OH- from Ba(OH)2, as well as SO4^2- and Ba^2+.

Now, Ba^2+ and SO4^2- can form BaSO4, which is a precipitate (insoluble in water). So the reaction between Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 will produce BaSO4 precipitate and water.

So the reaction is: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

But let's write the balanced equation.

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, the equation is correct as is. So each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of water.

So this reaction would consume some of the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, producing BaSO4 precipitate and water, which would also affect the H+ and OH- concentrations.

So to accurately calculate the neutralization, I need to first find out how much of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reacts to form BaSO4, which would then determine the remaining H+ and OH- available for neutralization.

So let's calculate the moles of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 available before any reaction.

Moles H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol.

Moles Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol.

The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is 1:1.

So H2SO4: 0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol.

So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here because 0.09 < 0.1.

So all 0.09 mol H2SO4 will react, and 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 will react.

After this reaction:

Moles H2SO4 remaining: 0.09 - 0.09 = 0.

Moles Ba(OH)2 remaining: 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 mol.

But wait, each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-; so after the reaction, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.01 mol → 0.01 * 2 = 0.02 mol OH-.

Wait, but during the reaction, the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 also produce H2O, which doesn't contribute to OH- (since it's a neutral solution, but maybe the OH- is consumed in the reaction).

Wait, no, because the reaction consumes H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, but H2SO4 provides H+ and SO4^2-, and Ba(OH)2 provides Ba^2+ and OH-.

In the reaction H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O, the H+ from H2SO4 will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2 to form water.

So each mole of H2SO4 reacts with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2, and in the process, 2 H+ (from H2SO4) and 2 OH- (from Ba(OH)2) are consumed, producing 2 H2O.

Wait, no, the balanced equation is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So H2SO4 has 2 H+ per molecule, and Ba(OH)2 has 2 OH- per molecule.

So for each mole of H2SO4 reacting, 2 H+ are consumed, and for each mole of Ba(OH)2, 2 OH- are consumed.

So in this case, 0.09 moles of H2SO4 reacting with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2.

So H+ consumed: 0.09 mol * 2 = 0.18 mol.

OH- consumed: 0.09 mol * 2 = 0.18 mol.

So after this reaction, what remains?

Let's go back to the initial moles of H+ and OH-.

Initial H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol.

Initial H+ from H2SO4: 0.18 mol.

But wait, before any reaction, the total H+ is 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 mol.

But during the reaction, 0.18 mol H+ (from H2SO4) is consumed, along with 0.18 mol OH- (from Ba(OH)2). So after the reaction, the H+ from HCl remains 0.1 mol, and any excess OH- from Ba(OH)2 will remain.

Wait, but the H+ in HCl isn't consumed in the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, because the reaction consumes the H+ from H2SO4 and the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So after the reaction, we have:

H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol.

H+ from H2SO4: 0.18 - 0.18 = 0. So none left.

Ba(OH)2: after reaction, 0.01 mol Ba(OH)2 left. Each gives 2 OH- → 0.02 mol OH-.

So now, the remaining H+ is 0.1 (from HCl), and the remaining OH- is 0.02 (from remaining Ba(OH)2).

So now, the H+ and OH- can react with each other.

H+ (0.1 mol) + OH- (0.02 mol) → H2O (0.02 mol).

So 0.02 mol of H+ and OH- will neutralize each other, producing 0.02 mol of water. The remaining H+ is 0.1 -0.02 = 0.08 mol.

So the total neutralization steps are:

1. H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 react to form BaSO4 precipitate, consuming 0.18 mol H+ and 0.18 mol OH-.

2. The remaining OH- (0.02 mol) reacts with H+ from HCl (0.02 mol).

So the total moles of H+ neutralized are:

0.18 (from H2SO4 reacting with Ba(OH)2) + 0.02 (from HCl reacting with remaining Ba(OH)2) = 0.20 mol H+ neutralized.

Because each mole of H+ neutralized releases 57 kJ, the total heat released is 0.20 ×57 = 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.4 kJ is 11,400 J. Converting to kcal: 11,400 /4184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which would match option A (-2.72 kcal) or maybe I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, no, wait. 57 kJ is per mole of H+ neutralized. So 0.2 mol ×57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. So the answer is -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is around 11.4 kJ, but wait, 1 kcal is 4184 J, so 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (since 11400 /4184 ≈ 2.72). So option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be around 47.6 kJ (11.42 ×4184 ≈ 47,620 J → 47.62 kJ), which is way higher than our 11.4 kJ.

Hmm, so perhaps I messed up the unit conversion somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in kJ, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is about 0.28 ×57=16 kJ. Wait, 0.28 ×57 is 15.96, which rounds to 16.0 kJ. So maybe I missed some part.

Wait, let me think again. Perhaps I should have considered all the H+ and OH- and see which is the limiting reagent without considering the precipitation.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the step where H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 react to form BaSO4 is complicating things, but perhaps that's not the case because the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization, which is about the acid-base reaction, not the precipitation.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization only considers the acid and base reacting, regardless of any precipitate formation. So perhaps the correct way is to ignore the BaSO4 formation and just calculate based on the moles of H+ and OH- regardless of other reactions.

Wait, but when you mix all three solutions, the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2. The presence of SO4^2- and Ba^2+ may form a precipitate, which affects the amount of OH- available, but I think the calculation needs to account for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to ignore the precipitation and just consider the moles of H+ and OH- regardless, but that seems incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the H+ and OH- consumed in the precipitation reaction.

Let me try a different approach. Let's sum all the H+ and OH- and see which is the limiting.

Total H+ = HCl (0.1) + H2SO4 (0.18) = 0.28.

Total OH- = Ba(OH)2 (0.2).

So OH- is limiting. So all OH- (0.2 mol) will react with 0.2 mol H+.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 ×57 = 11.4 kJ.

But wait, this ignores the fact that some of the H+ comes from H2SO4, which may have reacted with Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4. But perhaps the problem assumes that all the H+ and OH- are available for neutralization, regardless of any precipitation.

But in reality, when you mix these solutions, Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 would form BaSO4 which precipitates, which uses up some of the H+ and OH-.

So perhaps the correct approach is to first calculate how much H+ and OH- are actually available after any precipitation.

So let's model that:

1. Calculate moles of H2SO4 (0.09) and Ba(OH)2 (0.1). They react 1:1.

So 0.09 mol H2SO4 reacts with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2.

This reaction consumes 0.09 ×2 = 0.18 mol H+ (from H2SO4) and 0.09 ×2 = 0.18 mol OH- (from Ba(OH)2).

So after this reaction:

H2SO4: 0.09 - 0.09 = 0 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 -0.09 = 0.01 mol → 0.01 ×2 = 0.02 mol OH-.

HCl: 0.1 mol H+.

So the total H+ available now is:

H+ from HCl: 0.1.

H+ from H2SO4: 0 (all used up in the reaction).

So total H+ = 0.1.

Available OH-:

From Ba(OH)2: 0.02 mol.

So now, OH- is 0.02 mol, H+ is 0.1.

So OH- is limiting. So all 0.02 mol OH- will react with 0.02 mol H+.

So total H+ neutralized: 0.18 (from H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reaction) + 0.02 (from OH- and HCl) = 0.20 mol.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.20 ×57 = 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy of neutralization is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is close but not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the H+ and OH- involved in the precipitation reaction. Let me think again.

When H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 react, each provides H+ and OH-.

The reaction is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4↓ + 2 H2O.

Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-.

So when 0.09 mol H2SO4 reacts, it provides 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2 provides 0.09 ×2 = 0.18 mol OH-.

So in this reaction, 0.18 mol H+ and 0.18 mol OH- are consumed, producing 0.18 mol H2O.

So after this, the remaining H+ is from HCl (0.1 mol) and any unreacted H2SO4 or Ba(OH)2.

But H2SO4 is all reacted (0.09 mol → 0.09 mol reacted), so no H+ left from H2SO4.

Ba(OH)2 has 0.01 mol left, which gives 0.02 mol OH-.

So now, we have 0.1 mol H+ and 0.02 mol OH-.

These will react to form 0.02 mol H2O, consuming 0.02 H+ and 0.02 OH-.

So total H+ neutralized:

0.18 (from H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2) + 0.02 (from HCl and Ba(OH)2) = 0.20 mol.

So 0.20 mol ×57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ → -11.4 kJ.

Which is not one of the options exactly, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done using the initial moles without considering the precipitation, leading to 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH- → 0.2 neutralized, 11.4 kJ. So the correct answer would be -11.4 kJ, which is not an option, but option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 47.6 kJ, which is way off.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the initial approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the enthalpy per mole is taken as -56.9 kJ per mole of H+ → so 0.20 ×56.9 = 11.38 kJ → approximately -11.4 kJ.

The options don't have this, but option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 47.6 kJ. That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses the enthalpy per mole of H2O formed, which is around 57 kJ per mole. So 0.2 mol H2O → 11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but looking at the options, option D is the closest in terms of kJ, even though it's 16.0 kJ.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles.

HCl: 500 mL → 0.5 L. 0.5 L ×0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL → 0.3 L. 0.3 L ×0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL → 0.2 L. 0.2 L ×0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

So 0.2 mol OH- neutralizes 0.2 H+, releasing 0.2 ×57 =11.4 kJ.

But if the question expects the answer in kcal, 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal. So that would be option A: -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 47.6 kJ, which would be 0.2 × 57 × 4.184 (unit conversion), which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it in kcal.

Wait, 57 kJ per mole is equal to 57,000 J/mol. Converting to kcal: 57,000 /4184 ≈13.6 kcal.

So per mole of H+, it's about -13.6 kcal.

So 0.2 moles → 0.2 ×13.6 = 2.72 kcal. So the total enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2, leading to 11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer would be option A: -2.72 kcal.

But wait, earlier I considered that some H+ and OH- are consumed in the precipitation reaction, leading to 0.2 mol of H+ neutralized. So the answer would be -2.72 kcal.

But earlier I thought the answer would be -11.4 kJ, which would be -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer would be option A: -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options again:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches the 0.2 mol ×13.6 kcal/mol → 2.72 kcal.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of reaction, which in the case of strong acids and strong bases is per mole of H+ or OH-.

Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous, but I think the correct approach is to calculate the total moles of H+ neutralized, which is 0.2, leading to 0.2 ×57 kJ =11.4 kJ → which is option not present, but in kcal, it's 2.72, which is option A.

So the correct answer would be option A: -2.72 kcal.

To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions available:

1. **Moles of H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is monoprotic, so moles of H⁺ = moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄**:  
   H₂SO₄ is diprotic, so moles of H⁺ = \( 2 \times \text{moles of H₂SO₄} = 2 \times (0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L}) = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

   Total H⁺ from acids = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions per formula unit, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 2 \times \text{moles of Ba(OH)₂} = 2 \times (0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L}) = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

Next, we account for the reaction between H₂SO₄ and Ba(OH)₂, which forms the insoluble precipitate BaSO₄. The reaction is:

\[
\text{H₂SO₄} + \text{Ba(OH)₂} \rightarrow \text{BaSO₄ (s)} + 2 \text{H₂O}.
\]

- **Moles of H₂SO₄ and Ba(OH)₂ reacting**:  
  The reaction is 1:1, so 0.09 mol H₂SO₄ reacts with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)₂. This consumes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ (from H₂SO₄) and \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂).

- **Remaining moles after precipitation**:  
  - H₂SO₄: \( 0.09 - 0.09 = 0 \, \text{mol} \).  
  - Ba(OH)₂: \( 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 \, \text{mol} \), which provides \( 0.01 \times 2 = 0.02 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻.  
  - H⁺ from HCl remains at \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

Now, the remaining H⁺ and OH⁻ neutralize each other:

- Total H⁺ available = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \) (from HCl).  
- Total OH⁻ available = \( 0.02 \, \text{mol} \) (from Ba(OH)₂).  

OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, so all \( 0.02 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ reacts with \( 0.02 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺. The total moles of H⁺ neutralized are:

\[
0.18 \, \text{(from H₂SO₄ and Ba(OH)₂)} + 0.02 \, \text{(from HCl and Ba(OH)₂)} = 0.20 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of H⁺ neutralized. Thus, the total enthalpy change is:

\[
0.20 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

Converting to kilocalories (\( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \)):

\[
-11.4 \, \text{kJ} \times 0.239 = -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

Thus, the enthalpy of neutralization is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which corresponds to **option A**.

ANSWER: A

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit rusty, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says: Calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H2SO4, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)2 are mixed. The options are A to D.

Hmm, right, enthalpy of neutralization usually refers to the heat released when an acid reacts with a base to form water. The standard enthalpy of neutralization is often around -57 kJ/mol for strong acids and bases, but when concentrations vary, I think the total amount of heat depends on the moles involved.

Wait, but the problem is mixing three solutions: HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2. So I need to figure out how these acids and base will react when mixed.

First, let's list the acids and base:

HCl is a strong acid, monoprotic. H2SO4 is a strong acid, but it's diprotic. Ba(OH)2 is a strong base; it dissociates into Ba²+ and 2 OH⁻ ions. So each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives two moles of OH⁻.

So when these are mixed, the H+ ions from the acids will react with OH⁻ ions from the base. I think the neutralization reaction is H+ + OH⁻ → H2O, and each of these releases heat, typically around 57 kJ per mole of H+ (since each mole of H+ neutralized gives about -57 kJ).

So the key here is to find out the total moles of H+ from the acids and the moles of OH⁻ from the base, and see which one is in excess. The limiting reagent will determine how much neutralization occurs. The heat released will be based on the moles of H+ or OH⁻ that are completely neutralized.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate moles of H+ from each acid.

For HCl:
Molarity M = 0.2 M, volume V = 500 mL = 0.5 L.
Moles HCl = M × V = 0.2 * 0.5 = 0.1 mol.
Since HCl is monoprotic, moles H+ = 0.1 mol.

For H2SO4:
H2SO4 is diprotic, so each mole gives 2 H+ ions. Its molarity is 0.3 M, volume is 300 mL = 0.3 L.
Moles H2SO4 = 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol.
So moles H+ from H2SO4 = 0.09 * 2 = 0.18 mol.

Adding these, total H+ from acids:
0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 mol H+.

Now for the base, Ba(OH)2:
Molarity is 0.5 M, volume 200 mL = 0.2 L.
Moles Ba(OH)2 = 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol.
Each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 moles of OH⁻. So moles OH⁻ = 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 mol.

So we have 0.28 mol H+ and 0.2 mol OH⁻. Since H+ is in excess, all OH⁻ will react, and some H+ will remain.

The neutralization reaction is H+ + OH⁻ → H2O. Each mole releases about 57 kJ of heat (I think the value might be positive or negative depending on the convention; since it's exothermic, it's negative).

So moles of OH⁻ is 0.2 mol, so moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2 mol.

So the heat released would be 0.2 mol * 57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ. But wait, wait, the options are in kcal and kJ. Let me check the units.

Wait, 57 kJ is per mole of H+ neutralized. So yes, 0.2 ×57 = 11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, option B is -11.42 kcal, and option D is -16.0 kJ. Oh, but wait, the problem says 'enthalpy of neutralization'. So the sign is important.

Wait, the enthalpy of neutralization is usually negative because it's exothermic. So the value here is -11.4 kJ? But wait, the options have B as -11.42 kcal and D as -16 kJ. Oh, but wait, I might have made a mistake in the calculation units.

Wait, 57 kJ per mole is correct? Or is it per mole of H+? Let me think: For a strong acid and strong base, the enthalpy of neutralization is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). So yes, each mole gives off 57 kJ.

Wait, but the problem states the enthalpy of neutralization when these are mixed. So the total heat released is 0.2 *57 = 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change would be negative, so -11.4 kJ. But looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is close but not exactly 11.4. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating moles.

Wait, let me check the moles again.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol. Correct.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Since H2SO4 is diprotic, each mole gives 2 H+, so 0.18 mol H+. Correct.

Total H+ from acids: 0.28 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH-, so 0.2 mol OH-.

So H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2. So OH- is the limiting reagent.

So moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2. So the heat is 0.2 *57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. But wait, 57 kJ per mole. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

Wait, but the options have D as -16.0 kJ, which is higher. So maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps using the initial concentrations and considering the dilution. Wait, no, because the question is about the neutralization reaction, which would depend on moles, regardless of the concentrations. So the dilution doesn't affect the heat released, because the moles reacting are based on the initial concentrations and volumes.

Wait, but perhaps I'm miscalculating the moles. Let me see:

Wait, for H2SO4, it's 300 mL 0.3 M. 0.3 * 0.3 = 0.09 mol H2SO4. Since each gives 2 H+, 0.18 mol H+. Correct.

Ba(OH)2 is 200 mL 0.5 M. 0.5 * 0.2 = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So the H+ comes to 0.28 mol, OH- 0.2 mol. So OH- is the limiting.

So 0.2 mol H+ neutralized. So 0.2 ×57=11.4 kJ. So the answer would be -11.4 kJ, but the options don't have that.

Wait, the options are:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

Wait, option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about -11.4 ×4.184 ≈ -47.6 kJ, which doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, wait. Oh, wait a minute. Oh! I think I confused the units. Because 57 kJ is per mole, but perhaps the question is in calories or kilocalories. Oh no, wait, 1 kJ is 1000 J, and 1 kcal (Cal) is about 4184 J. So 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal (since 57000 / 4184 ≈ 13.6). So 0.2 mol *57 kJ/mol=11.4 kJ → 11.4 / 4184 ≈ 0.00272 kcal? No, wait, no. Wait, 1 kcal is 4184 J, so 11.4 kJ is 11,400 J. 11,400 /4184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So 11.4 kJ is 2.72 kcal. But the options have option B as -11.42 kcal, which would be about 47.6 kJ.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the enthalpy in kcal. Oh wait, maybe I should compute it using 57 kcal per mole? Because sometimes I've heard the enthalpy of neutralization as approximately 57 kcal per mole. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because 57 kJ is about 13.6 kcal. But wait, 57,000 J is 57 kJ, which is 57,000 / 4,184 ≈ 13.6 kcal.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

The enthalpy of neutralization (ΔH) for a strong acid and strong base is approximately -57 kJ per mole of H+ (or OH-). So for each mole of H+ neutralized, it's -57 kJ.

So in this case, 0.2 moles of H+ are neutralized, so ΔH = 0.2 * (-57 kJ) = -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is a bit higher, but let's think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the moles. Let me double-check.

HCl: 0.2 M * 0.5 L = 0.1 mol. Correct. Each gives 1 H+ → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol. Each gives 2 H+ → 0.18 mol → total 0.28 H+.

Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol. Each gives 2 OH- → 0.2 mol OH-.

So the OH- is 0.2, H+ is 0.28. So all OH- is used up, 0.2 H+ neutralized. So 0.2 *57=11.4 kJ.

So the answer is -11.4 kJ. But the options don't have that. Wait, the options are:

A: -2.72 kcal

B: -11.42 kcal

C: -3.80 kcal

D: -16.0 kJ

Hmm, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is larger than my calculated 11.4 kJ. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I missed another reaction?

Wait, wait a minute. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but when it's in solution, it dissociates completely in two steps. The first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Wait, no, wait. No, actually, the first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid, but in reality, the first dissociation is complete (H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-?), but wait no, wait:

Wait, no, H2SO4 is a strong acid, but the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Wait, wait, no. Wait, H2SO4 is a diprotic acid, but in water, the first proton (H+) is fully dissociated. The second proton is also dissociated because H2SO4 is a strong acid. So in solution, H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, H2SO4 is a strong acid, but in reality, the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, no. Wait, no, wait. I think I got that wrong. Let me clarify.

H2SO4 is a strong acid, but the first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, that can't be right because that would be 2 H+ per molecule, but in reality, the first dissociation releases 2 H+ (because it's a diprotic acid and fully ionizes). Wait, no, perhaps the first dissociation is H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^-; the second is HSO4^- → H+ + SO4^2-. But for H2SO4, both dissociations are strong, so it's 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

So each mole of H2SO4 gives 2 moles of H+. So I think my earlier calculation is correct.

Wait, but maybe I should consider that Ba(OH)2 is a strong base, but when it reacts with H2SO4, the reaction might produce BaSO4 precipitate, which is a sulfate precipitate. Because Ba^2+ and SO4^2- would form BaSO4, which is insoluble.

Oh right! That's a crucial point. So when Ba(OH)2 is mixed with H2SO4, the SO4^2- from H2SO4 will react with Ba^2+ from Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4 precipitate.

So the Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 will react in a neutralization reaction, but also forming a precipitate. This will affect the amount of OH- available for neutralizing other H+ sources.

Wait, this complicates things. So perhaps the initial approach was incorrect because I didn't account for the neutralization between Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4, which forms a precipitate and uses up some of the OH- and H+.

So I need to approach this more carefully.

Let me outline all the possible reactions.

First, when you mix HCl, H2SO4, and Ba(OH)2:

1. H2SO4 (strong acid) will dissociate completely into 2 H+ and SO4^2-.

2. Ba(OH)2 (strong base) will dissociate into Ba^2+ and 2 OH-.

3. HCl will dissociate into H+ and Cl^-.

So in solution, we have a lot of H+ from HCl and H2SO4, OH- from Ba(OH)2, as well as SO4^2- and Ba^2+.

Now, Ba^2+ and SO4^2- can form BaSO4, which is a precipitate (insoluble in water). So the reaction between Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 will produce BaSO4 precipitate and water.

So the reaction is: H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O.

But let's write the balanced equation.

H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

Wait, the equation is correct as is. So each mole of H2SO4 reacts with one mole of Ba(OH)2 to produce one mole of BaSO4 and two moles of water.

So this reaction would consume some of the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, producing BaSO4 precipitate and water, which would also affect the H+ and OH- concentrations.

So to accurately calculate the neutralization, I need to first find out how much of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reacts to form BaSO4, which would then determine the remaining H+ and OH- available for neutralization.

So let's calculate the moles of H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 available before any reaction.

Moles H2SO4: 0.3 M * 0.3 L = 0.09 mol.

Moles Ba(OH)2: 0.5 M * 0.2 L = 0.1 mol.

The reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 is 1:1.

So H2SO4: 0.09 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 mol.

So H2SO4 is the limiting reagent here because 0.09 < 0.1.

So all 0.09 mol H2SO4 will react, and 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2 will react.

After this reaction:

Moles H2SO4 remaining: 0.09 - 0.09 = 0.

Moles Ba(OH)2 remaining: 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 mol.

But wait, each mole of Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-; so after the reaction, the remaining Ba(OH)2 is 0.01 mol → 0.01 * 2 = 0.02 mol OH-.

Wait, but during the reaction, the H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 also produce H2O, which doesn't contribute to OH- (since it's a neutral solution, but maybe the OH- is consumed in the reaction).

Wait, no, because the reaction consumes H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, but H2SO4 provides H+ and SO4^2-, and Ba(OH)2 provides Ba^2+ and OH-.

In the reaction H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 ↓ + 2 H2O, the H+ from H2SO4 will react with OH- from Ba(OH)2 to form water.

So each mole of H2SO4 reacts with 1 mole of Ba(OH)2, and in the process, 2 H+ (from H2SO4) and 2 OH- (from Ba(OH)2) are consumed, producing 2 H2O.

Wait, no, the balanced equation is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4 + 2 H2O.

So H2SO4 has 2 H+ per molecule, and Ba(OH)2 has 2 OH- per molecule.

So for each mole of H2SO4 reacting, 2 H+ are consumed, and for each mole of Ba(OH)2, 2 OH- are consumed.

So in this case, 0.09 moles of H2SO4 reacting with 0.09 moles of Ba(OH)2.

So H+ consumed: 0.09 mol * 2 = 0.18 mol.

OH- consumed: 0.09 mol * 2 = 0.18 mol.

So after this reaction, what remains?

Let's go back to the initial moles of H+ and OH-.

Initial H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol.

Initial H+ from H2SO4: 0.18 mol.

But wait, before any reaction, the total H+ is 0.1 (HCl) + 0.18 (H2SO4) = 0.28 mol.

But during the reaction, 0.18 mol H+ (from H2SO4) is consumed, along with 0.18 mol OH- (from Ba(OH)2). So after the reaction, the H+ from HCl remains 0.1 mol, and any excess OH- from Ba(OH)2 will remain.

Wait, but the H+ in HCl isn't consumed in the reaction between H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2, because the reaction consumes the H+ from H2SO4 and the OH- from Ba(OH)2.

So after the reaction, we have:

H+ from HCl: 0.1 mol.

H+ from H2SO4: 0.18 - 0.18 = 0. So none left.

Ba(OH)2: after reaction, 0.01 mol Ba(OH)2 left. Each gives 2 OH- → 0.02 mol OH-.

So now, the remaining H+ is 0.1 (from HCl), and the remaining OH- is 0.02 (from remaining Ba(OH)2).

So now, the H+ and OH- can react with each other.

H+ (0.1 mol) + OH- (0.02 mol) → H2O (0.02 mol).

So 0.02 mol of H+ and OH- will neutralize each other, producing 0.02 mol of water. The remaining H+ is 0.1 -0.02 = 0.08 mol.

So the total neutralization steps are:

1. H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 react to form BaSO4 precipitate, consuming 0.18 mol H+ and 0.18 mol OH-.

2. The remaining OH- (0.02 mol) reacts with H+ from HCl (0.02 mol).

So the total moles of H+ neutralized are:

0.18 (from H2SO4 reacting with Ba(OH)2) + 0.02 (from HCl reacting with remaining Ba(OH)2) = 0.20 mol H+ neutralized.

Because each mole of H+ neutralized releases 57 kJ, the total heat released is 0.20 ×57 = 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy change is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which doesn't match. Option B is -11.42 kcal. Wait, 11.4 kJ is 11,400 J. Converting to kcal: 11,400 /4184 ≈ 2.72 kcal. So the enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which would match option A (-2.72 kcal) or maybe I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, no, wait. 57 kJ is per mole of H+ neutralized. So 0.2 mol ×57 kJ = 11.4 kJ. So the answer is -11.4 kJ. Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is not matching. Option B is -11.42 kcal, which is around 11.4 kJ, but wait, 1 kcal is 4184 J, so 11.4 kJ is about 2.72 kcal (since 11400 /4184 ≈ 2.72). So option B is -11.42 kcal, which would be around 47.6 kJ (11.42 ×4184 ≈ 47,620 J → 47.62 kJ), which is way higher than our 11.4 kJ.

Hmm, so perhaps I messed up the unit conversion somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer in kJ, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is about 0.28 ×57=16 kJ. Wait, 0.28 ×57 is 15.96, which rounds to 16.0 kJ. So maybe I missed some part.

Wait, let me think again. Perhaps I should have considered all the H+ and OH- and see which is the limiting reagent without considering the precipitation.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was correct, and the step where H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 react to form BaSO4 is complicating things, but perhaps that's not the case because the question is about the enthalpy of neutralization, which is about the acid-base reaction, not the precipitation.

Alternatively, perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization only considers the acid and base reacting, regardless of any precipitate formation. So perhaps the correct way is to ignore the BaSO4 formation and just calculate based on the moles of H+ and OH- regardless of other reactions.

Wait, but when you mix all three solutions, the H+ from HCl and H2SO4 will react with the OH- from Ba(OH)2. The presence of SO4^2- and Ba^2+ may form a precipitate, which affects the amount of OH- available, but I think the calculation needs to account for that.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to ignore the precipitation and just consider the moles of H+ and OH- regardless, but that seems incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the H+ and OH- consumed in the precipitation reaction.

Let me try a different approach. Let's sum all the H+ and OH- and see which is the limiting.

Total H+ = HCl (0.1) + H2SO4 (0.18) = 0.28.

Total OH- = Ba(OH)2 (0.2).

So OH- is limiting. So all OH- (0.2 mol) will react with 0.2 mol H+.

So the enthalpy change is 0.2 ×57 = 11.4 kJ.

But wait, this ignores the fact that some of the H+ comes from H2SO4, which may have reacted with Ba(OH)2 to form BaSO4. But perhaps the problem assumes that all the H+ and OH- are available for neutralization, regardless of any precipitation.

But in reality, when you mix these solutions, Ba(OH)2 and H2SO4 would form BaSO4 which precipitates, which uses up some of the H+ and OH-.

So perhaps the correct approach is to first calculate how much H+ and OH- are actually available after any precipitation.

So let's model that:

1. Calculate moles of H2SO4 (0.09) and Ba(OH)2 (0.1). They react 1:1.

So 0.09 mol H2SO4 reacts with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)2.

This reaction consumes 0.09 ×2 = 0.18 mol H+ (from H2SO4) and 0.09 ×2 = 0.18 mol OH- (from Ba(OH)2).

So after this reaction:

H2SO4: 0.09 - 0.09 = 0 mol.

Ba(OH)2: 0.1 -0.09 = 0.01 mol → 0.01 ×2 = 0.02 mol OH-.

HCl: 0.1 mol H+.

So the total H+ available now is:

H+ from HCl: 0.1.

H+ from H2SO4: 0 (all used up in the reaction).

So total H+ = 0.1.

Available OH-:

From Ba(OH)2: 0.02 mol.

So now, OH- is 0.02 mol, H+ is 0.1.

So OH- is limiting. So all 0.02 mol OH- will react with 0.02 mol H+.

So total H+ neutralized: 0.18 (from H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 reaction) + 0.02 (from OH- and HCl) = 0.20 mol.

So the total enthalpy change is 0.20 ×57 = 11.4 kJ. So the enthalpy of neutralization is -11.4 kJ.

Looking at the options, option D is -16.0 kJ, which is close but not matching.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the H+ and OH- involved in the precipitation reaction. Let me think again.

When H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2 react, each provides H+ and OH-.

The reaction is H2SO4 + Ba(OH)2 → BaSO4↓ + 2 H2O.

Each H2SO4 gives 2 H+, each Ba(OH)2 gives 2 OH-.

So when 0.09 mol H2SO4 reacts, it provides 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2 provides 0.09 ×2 = 0.18 mol OH-.

So in this reaction, 0.18 mol H+ and 0.18 mol OH- are consumed, producing 0.18 mol H2O.

So after this, the remaining H+ is from HCl (0.1 mol) and any unreacted H2SO4 or Ba(OH)2.

But H2SO4 is all reacted (0.09 mol → 0.09 mol reacted), so no H+ left from H2SO4.

Ba(OH)2 has 0.01 mol left, which gives 0.02 mol OH-.

So now, we have 0.1 mol H+ and 0.02 mol OH-.

These will react to form 0.02 mol H2O, consuming 0.02 H+ and 0.02 OH-.

So total H+ neutralized:

0.18 (from H2SO4 and Ba(OH)2) + 0.02 (from HCl and Ba(OH)2) = 0.20 mol.

So 0.20 mol ×57 kJ/mol = 11.4 kJ → -11.4 kJ.

Which is not one of the options exactly, but option D is -16.0 kJ, which is higher. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the calculation is done using the initial moles without considering the precipitation, leading to 0.28 H+ and 0.2 OH- → 0.2 neutralized, 11.4 kJ. So the correct answer would be -11.4 kJ, which is not an option, but option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 47.6 kJ, which is way off.

Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the initial approach.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the enthalpy per mole is taken as -56.9 kJ per mole of H+ → so 0.20 ×56.9 = 11.38 kJ → approximately -11.4 kJ.

The options don't have this, but option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 47.6 kJ. That doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses the enthalpy per mole of H2O formed, which is around 57 kJ per mole. So 0.2 mol H2O → 11.4 kJ.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but looking at the options, option D is the closest in terms of kJ, even though it's 16.0 kJ.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles.

Wait, let me recalculate the moles.

HCl: 500 mL → 0.5 L. 0.5 L ×0.2 M = 0.1 mol HCl → 0.1 mol H+.

H2SO4: 300 mL → 0.3 L. 0.3 L ×0.3 M = 0.09 mol H2SO4 → 0.18 mol H+.

Ba(OH)2: 200 mL → 0.2 L. 0.2 L ×0.5 M = 0.1 mol Ba(OH)2 → 0.2 mol OH-.

So total H+ is 0.28, OH- is 0.2.

So 0.2 mol OH- neutralizes 0.2 H+, releasing 0.2 ×57 =11.4 kJ.

But if the question expects the answer in kcal, 11.4 kJ is approximately 2.72 kcal. So that would be option A: -2.72 kcal.

Wait, but option B is -11.42 kcal, which is about 47.6 kJ, which would be 0.2 × 57 × 4.184 (unit conversion), which doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it in kcal.

Wait, 57 kJ per mole is equal to 57,000 J/mol. Converting to kcal: 57,000 /4184 ≈13.6 kcal.

So per mole of H+, it's about -13.6 kcal.

So 0.2 moles → 0.2 ×13.6 = 2.72 kcal. So the total enthalpy change is -2.72 kcal, which is option A.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the moles of H+ neutralized is 0.2, leading to 11.4 kJ, which is 2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer would be option A: -2.72 kcal.

But wait, earlier I considered that some H+ and OH- are consumed in the precipitation reaction, leading to 0.2 mol of H+ neutralized. So the answer would be -2.72 kcal.

But earlier I thought the answer would be -11.4 kJ, which would be -2.72 kcal.

So the correct answer would be option A: -2.72 kcal.

Looking at the options again:

A) -2.72 kcal

B) -11.42 kcal

C) -3.80 kcal

D) -16.0 kJ

So option A is -2.72 kcal, which matches the 0.2 mol ×13.6 kcal/mol → 2.72 kcal.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the enthalpy of neutralization is per mole of reaction, which in the case of strong acids and strong bases is per mole of H+ or OH-.

Wait, the problem is a bit ambiguous, but I think the correct approach is to calculate the total moles of H+ neutralized, which is 0.2, leading to 0.2 ×57 kJ =11.4 kJ → which is option not present, but in kcal, it's 2.72, which is option A.

So the correct answer would be option A: -2.72 kcal.


To calculate the enthalpy of neutralization when 500 mL 0.2 M HCl, 300 mL 0.3 M H₂SO₄, and 200 mL 0.5 M Ba(OH)₂ are mixed, we first determine the moles of H⁺ and OH⁻ ions available:

1. **Moles of H⁺ from HCl**:  
   HCl is monoprotic, so moles of H⁺ = moles of HCl = \( 0.2 \, \text{M} \times 0.5 \, \text{L} = 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Moles of H⁺ from H₂SO₄**:  
   H₂SO₄ is diprotic, so moles of H⁺ = \( 2 \times \text{moles of H₂SO₄} = 2 \times (0.3 \, \text{M} \times 0.3 \, \text{L}) = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \).

   Total H⁺ from acids = \( 0.1 + 0.18 = 0.28 \, \text{mol} \).

3. **Moles of OH⁻ from Ba(OH)₂**:  
   Ba(OH)₂ dissociates into 2 OH⁻ ions per formula unit, so moles of OH⁻ = \( 2 \times \text{moles of Ba(OH)₂} = 2 \times (0.5 \, \text{M} \times 0.2 \, \text{L}) = 0.2 \, \text{mol} \).

Next, we account for the reaction between H₂SO₄ and Ba(OH)₂, which forms the insoluble precipitate BaSO₄. The reaction is:

\[
\text{H₂SO₄} + \text{Ba(OH)₂} \rightarrow \text{BaSO₄ (s)} + 2 \text{H₂O}.
\]

- **Moles of H₂SO₄ and Ba(OH)₂ reacting**:  
  The reaction is 1:1, so 0.09 mol H₂SO₄ reacts with 0.09 mol Ba(OH)₂. This consumes \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺ (from H₂SO₄) and \( 0.09 \times 2 = 0.18 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ (from Ba(OH)₂).

- **Remaining moles after precipitation**:  
  - H₂SO₄: \( 0.09 - 0.09 = 0 \, \text{mol} \).  
  - Ba(OH)₂: \( 0.1 - 0.09 = 0.01 \, \text{mol} \), which provides \( 0.01 \times 2 = 0.02 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻.  
  - H⁺ from HCl remains at \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \).

Now, the remaining H⁺ and OH⁻ neutralize each other:

- Total H⁺ available = \( 0.1 \, \text{mol} \) (from HCl).  
- Total OH⁻ available = \( 0.02 \, \text{mol} \) (from Ba(OH)₂).  

OH⁻ is the limiting reagent, so all \( 0.02 \, \text{mol} \) of OH⁻ reacts with \( 0.02 \, \text{mol} \) of H⁺. The total moles of H⁺ neutralized are:

\[
0.18 \, \text{(from H₂SO₄ and Ba(OH)₂)} + 0.02 \, \text{(from HCl and Ba(OH)₂)} = 0.20 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The enthalpy of neutralization is approximately \( -57 \, \text{kJ/mol} \) per mole of H⁺ neutralized. Thus, the total enthalpy change is:

\[
0.20 \, \text{mol} \times (-57 \, \text{kJ/mol}) = -11.4 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

Converting to kilocalories (\( 1 \, \text{kJ} = 0.239 \, \text{kcal} \)):

\[
-11.4 \, \text{kJ} \times 0.239 = -2.72 \, \text{kcal}.
\]

Thus, the enthalpy of neutralization is \( -2.72 \, \text{kcal} \), which corresponds to **option A**.
