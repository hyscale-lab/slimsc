Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question says that in a specific region of the sky, the number of stars varies with parallax as 1 over plx to the fifth power. So, the number of stars N is proportional to 1/(plx^5). Hmm, I remember that parallax (plx) is related to distance. Oh right, the formula I think is plx = 1/d, where d is the distance. So if plx is inversely proportional to distance, then distance d is 1/plx.

The question is about how the number of stars changes with distance. They're asking per unit range of distance, which probably means the number density or how many stars appear per unit distance. So I need to find how N depends on distance r.

Let me write down what I know. N ∝ 1/(plx^5), and plx = 1/d. So substituting plx into the equation, N ∝ 1/( (1/d)^5 ) which is the same as N ∝ d^5. Wait, but wait, I think I'm mixing up the variables here. The question is about how N changes with distance. So if N is proportional to d^5, then the number of stars increases with the fifth power of distance. But wait, wait a second—no, I think I'm getting that backwards. Let me think again.

Wait, parallax plx is in arcseconds, and it's inversely proportional to distance in parsecs. So if plx increases, the distance decreases. So the original relation is N ∝ 1/plx^5. Since plx is 1/d, then 1/plx is d. So 1/plx^5 is d^5. So N is proportional to d^5. So as distance increases, the number of stars increases as the fifth power. But the question is about how the number changes with distance, per unit range. Hmm, maybe I need to think about the differential, like dN/dr.

Wait, the problem says "how does the number of stars in that region of the sky change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". So maybe it's about the rate of change of N with respect to r. So dN/dr.

But wait, I'm not sure if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of stars in a shell at radius r, which would be proportional to the surface area times the volume density.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's model this. Let's consider that the number of stars is a function of distance. N is proportional to 1/(plx^5), and plx is 1/r (assuming r is in parsecs, same units as plx). So plx = 1/r, so 1/(plx^5) = r^5. So N ∝ r^5.

Wait, but that can't be right because as r increases, N would increase, but typically, the number of stars you can see might decrease with distance because they're fainter and harder to detect. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh, wait, the problem says "number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So perhaps when plx is smaller (i.e., larger distance), the number of stars increases. So more stars at larger distances. But that seems counterintuitive because at larger distances, stars are dimmer. But perhaps we're considering a specific observation where the count increases with distance. Maybe it's a specific survey that can detect more stars at larger distances, perhaps in a certain band or something. But okay, let's proceed.

If N ∝ r^5, then the number of stars in a region increases rapidly with distance. But the question is looking how it changes per unit distance. So maybe it's about the differential, like the change in N with r, which would be dN/dr proportional to r^4. Because the derivative of r^5 is 5 r^4. So which option is that?

Looking at the options:

A) ~ r^3

B) ~ r^5

C) ~ r^4

D) ~ r^2

Wait, the question says "how does the number of stars [...] change with distance (per unit range of distance, r)". Hmm. The phrasing is a bit ambiguous. If it's asking for the number of stars per unit distance (like the density), then that would be the derivative. So, if N is proportional to r^5, then dN/dr is proportional to r^4, which is option C.

But wait, let me think again. The number of stars observed in a region might depend on the volume you're observing. For example, the number density (stars per unit volume) is n, and the number of stars in a volume would be n * volume. But in this case, the problem says that N varies with parallax as 1/(plx^5). So let's model this.

Parallax plx = 1/d, so d is the distance. So N = k * (plx)^(-5) = k * (1/(d))^(-5) = k * d^5. So N ∝ d^5. Now, the number of stars as a function of distance increases with the fifth power. So for example, if you're looking at a distance r, the number of stars is proportional to r^5. But how does that change per unit distance? Suppose you're looking at a thin shell at distance r with thickness dr. The number of stars in that shell would be the surface area (4πr²) times the volume density. Wait, but in this case, the question says the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5. So perhaps the number of stars in the shell at distance r is proportional to r^5. But wait, that doesn't align with typical stellar density, but maybe it's a hypothetical scenario.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's take the number of stars in a thin shell at distance r. The number of stars N in a shell is proportional to the surface area (4πr²) multiplied by the number of stars per unit volume (density) times the thickness dr. So N_shell = 4π r² * n * dr, where n is the number density. But in this problem, the number of stars (in the shell) varies as 1/(plx^5). Since plx =1/r, so 1/plx^5 = r^5. So N_shell = k * r^5. But N_shell is also 4π r² n dr. So setting them equal: 4π r² n dr = k r^5. So n = (k r^5) / (4π r² dr) ) → n = (k r^3)/(4 π dr). Hmm, but that's per dr. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars N in a region is proportional to the volume, which is (4/3)π r^3, multiplied by the number density. But the problem states N ∝ 1/plx^5. So plugging in plx =1/r, N ∝ r^5. So N = (4/3) π r^3 * n(r). So 4/3 π r^3 n(r) ∝ r^5 → n(r) ∝ r^2. So the number density increases with r squared. Then, the number of stars per unit volume increases as r^2. But the question is about how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range. Wait, perhaps it's the number of stars per unit distance, so that would be the integral of the number density over a small dr. So dN/dr = n(r) = r^2. So the number of stars increases as r squared. But looking back at the options, option D is r squared. Hmm, but earlier reasoning suggested it was r^4 because of the derivative of r^5.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting results here. Let me retrace.

The problem says, "the number of stars varies with parallax as 1/plx^5." So N ∝ 1/(plx)^5. Since plx =1/r → N ∝ r^5.

If N increases as r^5, then for a given change in r (like from r to r+dr), the change in N would be dN/dr = 5 r^4. So per unit distance, the number of stars increases as r^4. So the correct answer would be option C, r^4.

But another approach suggested that the number density (n) is r^2. But the question isn't about number density, it's about the number of stars per unit distance. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let's clarify. The number of stars in a thin shell of radius r and thickness dr would be the surface area (4πr²) times the number density (n) times dr. So N_shell = 4π r² n dr.

But according to the problem, N_shell is proportional to 1/(plx)^5 = r^5. So,

4 π r² n dr = k r^5 → n = (k r^5) / (4 π r² dr) ) → n = (k r^3) / (4 π dr).

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because dr is a differential. Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of stars in a region that's a sphere of radius r is N = (4/3) π r^3 * n(r), and in this case, N ∝ r^5. So,

(4/3 π r^3) * n(r) ∝ r^5 → n(r) ∝ r^2. So the number density increases as r squared. So the number of stars per unit volume is proportional to r².

Then, the number of stars in a shell (per unit distance dr) would be the surface area (4π r²) times the number density (r²) times dr.

So N_shell =4 π r² * n(r) dr =4 π r² * (k r²) dr → N_shell ∝ r^4 dr.

So per unit distance dr, N_shell ∝ r^4. Therefore, the number of stars in each thin shell (per unit distance) increases as r^4. So the correct answer would be option C, ~r^4.

Wait, but earlier I thought the derivative of N being proportional to r^5 would give dN/dr proportional to r^4, which matches this result. So the change in the number of stars with distance per unit range is proportional to r^4, which is option C.

The problem states that the number of stars, \( N \), in a specific region of the sky varies with parallax as \( N \propto 1/\text{plx}^5 \). Since parallax \( \text{plx} \) is inversely proportional to distance \( r \) (\( \text{plx} = 1/r \)), substituting this into the equation gives \( N \propto r^5 \). This means the number of stars increases rapidly with distance.

The question asks how the number of stars changes with distance per unit range of distance (\( r \)). To determine this, we consider the derivative of \( N \) with respect to \( r \), which represents the rate of change of the number of stars with distance. Taking the derivative of \( N \propto r^5 \), we find:

\[
\frac{dN}{dr} \propto r^4.
\]

This indicates that the number of stars per unit distance increases as \( r^4 \). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C) ~ \( r^4 \)**.
