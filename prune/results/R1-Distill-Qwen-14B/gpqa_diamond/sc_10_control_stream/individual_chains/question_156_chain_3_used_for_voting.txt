Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down. The question is about reactions involving alkenes and mCPBA, followed by some chromatography analysis.

First, let me read the problem again carefully. The chemist does two reactions:

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, then aqueous acid.
Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene treated similarly with mCPBA and acid.

Both go to 100% completion. Then the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: a standard (achiral) and a chiral one. The question is about what the chromatograms show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation adds an oxygen across the double bond, forming an epoxide. So each alkene would react to form an epoxide.

Wait, but the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z) isomers. So each will form different epoxides, right? Because the geometry of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide.

Let me think: when mCPBA adds to a double bond, it forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Because mCPBA adds the oxygen from the same face, leading to a cis addition. So for the (E)-oct-4-ene, which has the substituents opposite each other (trans), adding mCPBA would form an epoxide where the oxygen bridges the same positions but in a way that reflects the initial E geometry.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Epoxidation via mCPBA leads to a trans epoxide, or is it cis? Hmm. Let me recall. The epoxidation of a trans-alkene (E) would create a trans-epoxide? Or wait, no. Wait, the epoxide is formed from a cyclic transition state. The mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that the oxygen comes from the same face, leading to a cis addition.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the structure. Take (E)-oct-4-ene: the double bond is between C4 and C5, and the substituents on each are opposite. So the structure is CH2CH2 on each end but in trans. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide where the oxygen is between the same two carbons, but the configuration depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, maybe I should draw it out. Let's imagine 4-octene. For (E), the two CH2CH3 groups are on opposite sides. When mCPBA reacts, it adds across the double bond, adding an oxygen bridge between the two carbons. The addition is syn, meaning the oxygen adds from the same face. So in the case of (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each carbon are opposite, but the epoxide will form a certain configuration.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the product. The epoxide formed from (E)-oct-4-ene would have adjacent substituents on the same side, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide? Or maybe not. I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the more important point is that (E) and (Z) alkenes will form different diastereomers of the epoxide. Because when you epoxidize a Z or E alkene, the resulting epoxide's configuration depends on that.

Wait, but wait: mCPBA adds an epoxide in a way that the configuration of the epoxide is related to the starting alkene. For a trans (E) alkene, the epoxidation leads to a trans epoxide, and for a cis (Z) alkene, the epoxide is cis? Or is it the opposite?

Wait, maybe the correct way is that the epoxidation using mCPBA is a syn addition. So the oxygen adds from the same face. So if the starting alkene is E, with groups opposite, adding the oxygen from the same face will lead to the epoxide where the substituents are on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. Because the original groups were opposite.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of epoxidation would have the same configuration as the starting double bond. So (E)-oct-4-ene would form an epoxide where the substituents are opposite, and (Z) would form where substituents are same side.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of specific examples. Let's say you have 2-pentene. If it's E, then the substituents (CH3 on each end) are opposite. Epoxidation would form a cis or trans epoxide?

Wait, I think when you epoxidize an E-alkene, the resulting epoxide would be trans. Because the syn addition leads the substituents on adjacent carbons to be on opposite sides.

Wait, no. Let me think: the original double bond is E, so substituents on each carbon are opposite. For mCPBA, which adds an oxygen across the double bond in a syn addition, the oxygen bridges the two carbons from the same face. So the substituents on each carbon would end up on the same side of the epoxide.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me visualize it.

Take (E)-2-pentene: CH2CH2 groups on each end but opposite. Adding mCPBA would add an oxygen bridge from the same side. So the two CH2CH3 groups (assuming that's the substituents) that were on opposite sides would now be adjacent in the epoxide. Wait, maybe the substituents on each carbon would end up on the same side, making the epoxide a cis or trans?

Wait, perhaps for (E), the substituents on each carbon are opposite. After syn addition, the two substituents on each carbon (like the CH2CH3 groups) would end up on the same face, leading to the epoxide having substituents across from each other. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe the key point is that the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-dihydroxyepoxide or something else. Wait, no. Wait, after epoxidation comes the acid work-up. Oh wait, the problem says after treating with mCPBA, they're treated with aqueous acid. So that's probably an acid-catalyzed ring opening of the epoxide.

Wait, mCPBA forms the epoxide, then in acidic conditions, the epoxide undergoes ring-opening. So what's the product of that?

Epoxide ring opening under acidic conditions typically proceeds via a protonation of the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group, then the nucleophile (water, in this case) attacks the more substituted carbon (due to carbocation stability). But wait, in the case of symmetric epoxides, like those derived from symmetric alkenes, the ring opening might lead to a single product.

Wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric. So both (E) and (Z) isomers of 4-octene would form symmetric epoxides. Because the molecule is symmetric around the double bond.

Wait, 4-octene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? Wait no. Wait, octene is eight carbons. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3. No, wait, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe a better way: 4-octene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Maybe it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, wait, octene is C8H16. For 4-octene, the double bond is between C4 and C5. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's 4-octene as CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Maybe it's CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3. No, perhaps I should think of it as:

The structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, octene has 8 carbons, double bond at position 4. So structure is: CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, perhaps more accurately written as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with the double bond between C4 and C5.

Wait, maybe it's better to write the structure as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with the double bond between C4 and C5, so the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure isn't crucial here. The key point is that when (E) and (Z) isomers of oct-4-ene undergo epoxidation with mCPBA, they form different epoxide diastereomers. Then, upon acid treatment, the epoxide rings open, leading to diols.

Wait, no, wait. mCPBA forms an epoxide, which in acidic conditions undergoes ring-opening. But the ring-opening product is a diol, right? So each epoxide would form a diol. Since the starting epoxide has a specific stereochemistry, the diol would have certain stereocenters.

But since the alkene is symmetric (oct-4-ene is symmetric), the epoxide would be a meso compound, perhaps. Because for oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end are the same. So for the (E) isomer, the epoxide would be a meso compound. Because the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making any stereocenters into meso forms.

Wait, that's an important point. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would be a meso compound. Because the molecule is symmetric. So the epoxide would have two stereocenters, but they are mirror images, leading to an overall achiral (meso) compound.

Similarly, the (Z)-oct-4-ene would form an epoxide that's also a meso compound? Wait, no. Wait, if the starting alkene is Z, the substituents are on the same side. So the epoxide would have substituents on the same face, leading to a different stereochemistry, but considering the symmetry, perhaps it's still a meso compound.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end (like CH2CH2) are opposite. So when mCPBA adds an epoxide (syn addition), the substituents on each end of the epoxide would end up on the same side. But due to the molecule's symmetry, the two stereocenters would be mirror images, leading to a meso compound.

Similarly, for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are on the same side. Adding the epoxide via syn addition would lead to the substituents on the same face, but again, the molecule remains symmetric, so it's still a meso compound.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if the starting alkene is Z, the epoxide would have the substituents on the same face. But due to the symmetry, would that result in the same meso compound as the E case?

Wait, perhaps not. Because the E and Z alkenes would form different epoxides. Let me think: (E) adds mCPBA to form an epoxide where substituents are opposite, but due to the molecule's symmetry, it's a meso compound. For (Z) case, the substituents are same side, but again, symmetry makes it a meso compound. So both would form the same epoxide.

Wait, that can't be correct. Because (E) and (Z) are different alkenes, they should form different epoxides. But perhaps in this case, when the epoxide is formed, the stereochemistry leads to the same product because of the symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I should imagine the structure. Let's say (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with the double bond between C4 and C5. The (E) isomer has the higher priority groups (maybe CH2CH3) on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen bridges C4 and C5. The addition is syn, so the oxygen comes from the same face.

So for the E isomer, the substituents (like CH2CH3) on each end are on opposite faces. So adding oxygen from the same face would cause the substituents to end up on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. But because the molecule is symmetric, those substituents would be mirror images, leading to a meso epoxide.

Similarly, the (Z) isomer has substituents on the same face. Adding oxygen from the same face would bring the substituents to the same side, but again, due to symmetry, it's a meso compound. Wait, but that would mean that both (E) and (Z) alkenes give the same epoxide. But that can't be right because mCPBA adds in a syn fashion, so the diastereomer depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

Hmm, maybe I'm confusing diastereomers and enantiomers. Let me think again. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would have the oxygens added to the same face, so the substituents (like CH2CH3 on each end) would be on opposite faces. But due to the molecule's symmetry, the result is a meso compound. Similarly, the (Z) isomer would form a different epoxide.

Wait, no, perhaps the (E) and (Z) alkenes form different epoxides. Because the geometry of the starting material affects where the oxygen adds, leading to different stereochemistry in the epoxide. But when the molecule is symmetric, perhaps both epoxides are meso compounds but different from each other.

Wait, maybe for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is a meso compound with the substituents on opposite sides, whereas for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would have substituents on the same sides, but due to symmetry, it's also a meso compound. So both would form the same epoxide, but that can't be right because they started as different alkenes.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should think about what happens after the epoxide is formed. When treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide undergoes ring-opening. The ring-opening of an epoxide under acidic conditions typically leads to the formation of a diol, where the stereochemistry depends on the epoxide's structure.

Wait, but in this case, the epoxide is symmetric. So when it opens, would it form a single diol or multiple diastereomers?

Wait, the epoxide is symmetric, so the ring-opening would produce only one diol product. But wait, the starting epoxide's configuration would influence the diol's configuration.

Wait, but if the epoxide is a meso compound, then the diol would also be a meso compound, leading to an achiral product. So both reactions would produce the same diol, which is achiral. So when the products are combined, there's only one product. But that can't be right because the alkenes were different, and their epoxides would have different configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps each starting alkene forms a different diastereomeric epoxide, which upon ring-opening gives different diastereomeric diols. Let's think about that.

Wait, let me try again. Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → epoxide A.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → epoxide B.

Each epoxide is a meso compound but different from each other. Then, upon acid treatment, each epoxide becomes a diol. But since they're different epoxides, their diols would also be different.

Wait, but wait, if the epoxide is meso, then the diol would also be meso, which is achiral. So each reaction produces an achiral diol. But the diols from (E) and (Z) might be different.

Wait, but considering the symmetry, perhaps the diols from both reactions are the same. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide from (E) and (Z) are different. For example, the (E) epoxide is meso, and the (Z) epoxide is also meso but with a different configuration, so upon ring-opening, they form different diols.

Wait, but if both epoxides are meso, but different, then upon acid treatment, each would form a diol. Let me imagine the structure.

Let's say the epoxide from (E) is such that when it opens, the diol has two adjacent chiral centers, but since it's meso, the molecule is achiral. Similarly, the (Z) epoxide would open to form a diol that's also a meso compound but a different one. So the diols from (E) and (Z) would be different.

Wait, but wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric, so any epoxide derived from it would have the same substituents on each end. Therefore, perhaps the epoxides from (E) and (Z) alkenes are actually the same, which would then give the same diol after acid treatment. But that can't be right because the starting material is different.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try to think about what the products are.

First, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide A → diol A.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide B → diol B.

Assuming the diols from each are different, then combining them would give two diastereomers. But wait, if the diols are each meso compounds, then each would be a single compound, not a mixture.

Wait, but wait, if the diol is a meso compound, it's achiral. So each reaction produces a single achiral diol. Now, when you combine the diols from both reactions, you get a mixture of two different diols.

Wait, but I thought the diols would be the same. Maybe I need to look at the possible structures.

Wait, another approach. Let me consider the product of each reaction.

For (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA, the epoxide formed would have the oxygen added on the same face. So considering the (E) configuration, the substituents on each end are opposite. So the epoxide would have the substituents on the same side, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide.

Wait, but the molecule is symmetric, so the epoxide would have two stereocenters, but they are mirror images, making it a meso compound. So diol A would be a meso diol, which is achiral.

Similarly, for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are same side. So the epoxide would have substituents on the same face, but again, the molecule is symmetric. So the epoxide is a meso compound, leading to diol B, also a meso diol. But are diol A and diol B the same or different?

Wait, maybe I should imagine the structures. Let's say the (E) epoxide has the substituents on opposite sides, leading to a diol where the hydroxyl groups are on opposite sides, but because it's symmetric, it's a meso compound. The (Z) epoxide would have substituents on the same side, leading to the diol where the hydroxyls are on the same side, which is also a meso compound.

Wait, but are these two diols the same or different? Because if they're the same, then combining the products would give a single compound. But I don't think they are the same. Because the starting alkenes were different, the epoxides would be different, leading to different diols.

Wait, but maybe they actually result in the same diol. Because the epoxide from (E) and (Z) are different, but after acid treatment, they form the same diol. No, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol formed from (E)-epoxide and the diol from (Z)-epoxide are the same because the molecule is symmetric and both epoxides give the same diol, which is a meso compound.

Wait, that can't be right because the starting alkenes are different. I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should move forward, assuming that each reaction produces a different diol, which is a meso compound.

But wait, if each reaction produces a single meso diol, then combining the products would give a mixture of two different diols. So when run on a standard HPLC (achiral), each diol would elute as a single peak, leading to two peaks in total. On a chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers, each meso diol would not split, as they're achiral. Wait, no. Wait, a chiral HPLC column can separate enantiomers, but if the molecule is achiral (meso), it would not split. So in the chiral column, the meso diols would each appear as a single peak.

Wait, but if the diols are different, the standard HPLC would show two peaks, each as a single peak. The chiral HPLC would show two peaks as well, since each diol is a single compound (meso, so no enantiomers to separate). So in that case, the standard and chiral HPLC would each show two peaks.

But looking at the options, option C is 2 peaks in both, but option D is 3 in standard and 4 in chiral. Hmm. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe each reaction produces more than one product. Let me think about the ring-opening step. When an epoxide is treated with acid, it typically forms a diol. But if the epoxide is symmetric, perhaps the ring-opening could lead to a single diastereomer or a racemic mixture. Wait, no. If the epoxide is a meso compound, the ring-opening could lead to an achiral diol, or possibly a racemic mixture, but wait, no: in the case of a symmetric epoxide, the ring-opening under acidic conditions would lead to a single diol, not a mixture.

Wait, but in reality, the ring-opening of a symmetric epoxide like that would produce a single diol because the molecule is symmetric, so the two possible attack pathways are the same. So each reaction produces a single diol, each being a meso compound. So when the two diols are combined, you have two different diols, each being meso.

Wait, but if the diols are different, then on the standard HPLC, which is achiral, each would appear as a single peak, leading to two peaks in total. On a chiral HPLC, each diol is a single peak because they are achiral. So that would be two peaks in both columns, which is option C.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. The diols from each reaction would be different. Each is a meso compound, so each would appear as a single peak on both HPLC columns. So in the combined product, you'd have two different compounds, each appearing as a single peak on both columns. So the standard would show two peaks, and the chiral would also show two peaks. So option C would be correct.

But wait, another possibility: when the epoxide is treated with acid, could it form more than one diastereomer? For example, if the epoxide is not symmetric, the ring-opening could form two different diastereomers. But in our case, the epoxide is symmetric, so the ring-opening would form only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial epoxide from (E) and (Z) are diastereomers, leading to two different diols, each of which is a single compound.

Thus, when combined, they give two compounds. So standard HPLC (achiral) would show two peaks. Chiral HPLC would also show two peaks because each diol is a single compound (meso, so no enantiomers), so each is a singlet.

So the answer would be option C: 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 2 peaks in both. That would be the case if each reaction produces a single diol, and there are two different diols. So each HPLC would show two peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, leading to more peaks.

Wait, maybe each reaction produces two diastereomeric diols. Let me think. For example, if the epoxide is not symmetric, the ring-opening could lead to two diastereomers. But in our case, the epoxide is symmetric, so it leads to a single diol.

Wait, but the epoxide is symmetric. So the diol would be a single product, which is a meso compound. So each reaction gives one diol. So when combined, two diols.

Thus, the HPLC would show two peaks in both cases.

So the correct answer would be C: 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

But wait, another possibility: maybe each reaction produces two enantiomers, but since the diol is meso, they're the same. So each reaction gives a single diol, leading to two diols in total.

So in the combined product, there are two diols, each appearing as a single peak on both HPLC columns.

So the answer would be C.

The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are each treated with mCPBA, forming epoxides, followed by aqueous acid to open the epoxide rings, yielding diols. The products from both reactions are combined and analyzed using standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. The goal is to determine the number of peaks observed in each chromatogram.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Epoxidation with mCPBA**:  
   - mCPBA adds an oxygen bridge across the double bond in a syn fashion.  
   - For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on the double bond are opposite, leading to an epoxide where the substituents are on opposite sides. Due to the molecule's symmetry, this results in a meso compound.  
   - For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on the double bond are on the same side, leading to an epoxide where the substituents are on the same side. Again, due to symmetry, this also results in a meso compound.  

2. **Ring-Opening with Acid**:  
   - The epoxides undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening to form diols.  
   - Both epoxides are symmetric, so the resulting diols are also meso compounds.  
   - The diols from (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are structurally different because the starting alkenes have different geometries.  

3. **HPLC Analysis**:  
   - **Standard (achiral) HPLC**:  
     - The standard HPLC column cannot distinguish between enantiomers but can separate diastereomers.  
     - Since the diols from (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are different diastereomers, the standard HPLC will show two distinct peaks.  
   - **Chiral HPLC**:  
     - The chiral HPLC column separates enantiomers.  
     - Since the diols are meso compounds (achiral), they will not split into enantiomers and will each appear as a single peak.  
     - Therefore, the chiral HPLC will also show two distinct peaks.  

### Conclusion:
The combined products of the two reactions yield two different diols, each of which is a meso compound. On the standard HPLC, these diols are separated as two distinct peaks due to their diastereomeric relationship. On the chiral HPLC, the meso nature of the diols prevents their splitting into enantiomers, resulting in two peaks as well.  

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's try to break it down. The question is about reactions involving alkenes and mCPBA, followed by some chromatography analysis.

First, let me read the problem again carefully. The chemist does two reactions:

Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene treated with one equivalent of mCPBA, then aqueous acid.
Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene treated similarly with mCPBA and acid.

Both go to 100% completion. Then the products are combined and run on two HPLC columns: a standard (achiral) and a chiral one. The question is about what the chromatograms show.

Hmm, I remember that mCPBA is meta-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a peracid. It's commonly used in epoxidation reactions. Epoxidation adds an oxygen across the double bond, forming an epoxide. So each alkene would react to form an epoxide.

Wait, but the starting alkenes are (E) and (Z) isomers. So each will form different epoxides, right? Because the geometry of the starting alkene affects the configuration of the epoxide.

Let me think: when mCPBA adds to a double bond, it forms an epoxide with the same stereochemistry as the starting alkene. Because mCPBA adds the oxygen from the same face, leading to a cis addition. So for the (E)-oct-4-ene, which has the substituents opposite each other (trans), adding mCPBA would form an epoxide where the oxygen bridges the same positions but in a way that reflects the initial E geometry.

Wait, no, maybe I'm getting that wrong. Epoxidation via mCPBA leads to a trans epoxide, or is it cis? Hmm. Let me recall. The epoxidation of a trans-alkene (E) would create a trans-epoxide? Or wait, no. Wait, the epoxide is formed from a cyclic transition state. The mCPBA adds across the double bond in a way that the oxygen comes from the same face, leading to a cis addition.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the structure. Take (E)-oct-4-ene: the double bond is between C4 and C5, and the substituents on each are opposite. So the structure is CH2CH2 on each end but in trans. When mCPBA adds, it forms an epoxide where the oxygen is between the same two carbons, but the configuration depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

Wait, maybe I should draw it out. Let's imagine 4-octene. For (E), the two CH2CH3 groups are on opposite sides. When mCPBA reacts, it adds across the double bond, adding an oxygen bridge between the two carbons. The addition is syn, meaning the oxygen adds from the same face. So in the case of (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each carbon are opposite, but the epoxide will form a certain configuration.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think about the product. The epoxide formed from (E)-oct-4-ene would have adjacent substituents on the same side, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide? Or maybe not. I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the more important point is that (E) and (Z) alkenes will form different diastereomers of the epoxide. Because when you epoxidize a Z or E alkene, the resulting epoxide's configuration depends on that.

Wait, but wait: mCPBA adds an epoxide in a way that the configuration of the epoxide is related to the starting alkene. For a trans (E) alkene, the epoxidation leads to a trans epoxide, and for a cis (Z) alkene, the epoxide is cis? Or is it the opposite?

Wait, maybe the correct way is that the epoxidation using mCPBA is a syn addition. So the oxygen adds from the same face. So if the starting alkene is E, with groups opposite, adding the oxygen from the same face will lead to the epoxide where the substituents are on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. Because the original groups were opposite.

Alternatively, perhaps the product of epoxidation would have the same configuration as the starting double bond. So (E)-oct-4-ene would form an epoxide where the substituents are opposite, and (Z) would form where substituents are same side.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of specific examples. Let's say you have 2-pentene. If it's E, then the substituents (CH3 on each end) are opposite. Epoxidation would form a cis or trans epoxide?

Wait, I think when you epoxidize an E-alkene, the resulting epoxide would be trans. Because the syn addition leads the substituents on adjacent carbons to be on opposite sides.

Wait, no. Let me think: the original double bond is E, so substituents on each carbon are opposite. For mCPBA, which adds an oxygen across the double bond in a syn addition, the oxygen bridges the two carbons from the same face. So the substituents on each carbon would end up on the same side of the epoxide.

Wait, perhaps not. Let me visualize it.

Take (E)-2-pentene: CH2CH2 groups on each end but opposite. Adding mCPBA would add an oxygen bridge from the same side. So the two CH2CH3 groups (assuming that's the substituents) that were on opposite sides would now be adjacent in the epoxide. Wait, maybe the substituents on each carbon would end up on the same side, making the epoxide a cis or trans?

Wait, perhaps for (E), the substituents on each carbon are opposite. After syn addition, the two substituents on each carbon (like the CH2CH3 groups) would end up on the same face, leading to the epoxide having substituents across from each other. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, maybe the key point is that the epoxide from (E)-oct-4-ene is a trans-dihydroxyepoxide or something else. Wait, no. Wait, after epoxidation comes the acid work-up. Oh wait, the problem says after treating with mCPBA, they're treated with aqueous acid. So that's probably an acid-catalyzed ring opening of the epoxide.

Wait, mCPBA forms the epoxide, then in acidic conditions, the epoxide undergoes ring-opening. So what's the product of that?

Epoxide ring opening under acidic conditions typically proceeds via a protonation of the epoxide oxygen, making it a better leaving group, then the nucleophile (water, in this case) attacks the more substituted carbon (due to carbocation stability). But wait, in the case of symmetric epoxides, like those derived from symmetric alkenes, the ring opening might lead to a single product.

Wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric. So both (E) and (Z) isomers of 4-octene would form symmetric epoxides. Because the molecule is symmetric around the double bond.

Wait, 4-octene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? Wait no. Wait, octene is eight carbons. Oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3. No, wait, the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3? Hmm, maybe a better way: 4-octene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Maybe it's CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, wait, octene is C8H16. For 4-octene, the double bond is between C4 and C5. So the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, no, that's 4-octene as CH2=CH-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3? No, perhaps I'm getting the structure wrong. Maybe it's CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2-CH2CH2CH3. No, perhaps I should think of it as:

The structure of oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH2-CH2CH3? No, wait, octene has 8 carbons, double bond at position 4. So structure is: CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, perhaps more accurately written as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but with the double bond between C4 and C5.

Wait, maybe it's better to write the structure as CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3. Wait, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with the double bond between C4 and C5, so the structure is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3, but I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure isn't crucial here. The key point is that when (E) and (Z) isomers of oct-4-ene undergo epoxidation with mCPBA, they form different epoxide diastereomers. Then, upon acid treatment, the epoxide rings open, leading to diols.

Wait, no, wait. mCPBA forms an epoxide, which in acidic conditions undergoes ring-opening. But the ring-opening product is a diol, right? So each epoxide would form a diol. Since the starting epoxide has a specific stereochemistry, the diol would have certain stereocenters.

But since the alkene is symmetric (oct-4-ene is symmetric), the epoxide would be a meso compound, perhaps. Because for oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end are the same. So for the (E) isomer, the epoxide would be a meso compound. Because the molecule would have a plane of symmetry, making any stereocenters into meso forms.

Wait, that's an important point. So for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would be a meso compound. Because the molecule is symmetric. So the epoxide would have two stereocenters, but they are mirror images, leading to an overall achiral (meso) compound.

Similarly, the (Z)-oct-4-ene would form an epoxide that's also a meso compound? Wait, no. Wait, if the starting alkene is Z, the substituents are on the same side. So the epoxide would have substituents on the same face, leading to a different stereochemistry, but considering the symmetry, perhaps it's still a meso compound.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on each end (like CH2CH2) are opposite. So when mCPBA adds an epoxide (syn addition), the substituents on each end of the epoxide would end up on the same side. But due to the molecule's symmetry, the two stereocenters would be mirror images, leading to a meso compound.

Similarly, for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are on the same side. Adding the epoxide via syn addition would lead to the substituents on the same face, but again, the molecule remains symmetric, so it's still a meso compound.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because if the starting alkene is Z, the epoxide would have the substituents on the same face. But due to the symmetry, would that result in the same meso compound as the E case?

Wait, perhaps not. Because the E and Z alkenes would form different epoxides. Let me think: (E) adds mCPBA to form an epoxide where substituents are opposite, but due to the molecule's symmetry, it's a meso compound. For (Z) case, the substituents are same side, but again, symmetry makes it a meso compound. So both would form the same epoxide.

Wait, that can't be correct. Because (E) and (Z) are different alkenes, they should form different epoxides. But perhaps in this case, when the epoxide is formed, the stereochemistry leads to the same product because of the symmetry.

Wait, perhaps I should imagine the structure. Let's say (E)-oct-4-ene is CH2CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2CH3 with the double bond between C4 and C5. The (E) isomer has the higher priority groups (maybe CH2CH3) on opposite sides. When mCPBA adds, the oxygen bridges C4 and C5. The addition is syn, so the oxygen comes from the same face.

So for the E isomer, the substituents (like CH2CH3) on each end are on opposite faces. So adding oxygen from the same face would cause the substituents to end up on opposite sides of the epoxide ring. But because the molecule is symmetric, those substituents would be mirror images, leading to a meso epoxide.

Similarly, the (Z) isomer has substituents on the same face. Adding oxygen from the same face would bring the substituents to the same side, but again, due to symmetry, it's a meso compound. Wait, but that would mean that both (E) and (Z) alkenes give the same epoxide. But that can't be right because mCPBA adds in a syn fashion, so the diastereomer depends on the starting alkene's geometry.

Hmm, maybe I'm confusing diastereomers and enantiomers. Let me think again. For (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would have the oxygens added to the same face, so the substituents (like CH2CH3 on each end) would be on opposite faces. But due to the molecule's symmetry, the result is a meso compound. Similarly, the (Z) isomer would form a different epoxide.

Wait, no, perhaps the (E) and (Z) alkenes form different epoxides. Because the geometry of the starting material affects where the oxygen adds, leading to different stereochemistry in the epoxide. But when the molecule is symmetric, perhaps both epoxides are meso compounds but different from each other.

Wait, maybe for (E)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide is a meso compound with the substituents on opposite sides, whereas for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the epoxide would have substituents on the same sides, but due to symmetry, it's also a meso compound. So both would form the same epoxide, but that can't be right because they started as different alkenes.

I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Maybe I should think about what happens after the epoxide is formed. When treated with aqueous acid, the epoxide undergoes ring-opening. The ring-opening of an epoxide under acidic conditions typically leads to the formation of a diol, where the stereochemistry depends on the epoxide's structure.

Wait, but in this case, the epoxide is symmetric. So when it opens, would it form a single diol or multiple diastereomers?

Wait, the epoxide is symmetric, so the ring-opening would produce only one diol product. But wait, the starting epoxide's configuration would influence the diol's configuration.

Wait, but if the epoxide is a meso compound, then the diol would also be a meso compound, leading to an achiral product. So both reactions would produce the same diol, which is achiral. So when the products are combined, there's only one product. But that can't be right because the alkenes were different, and their epoxides would have different configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps each starting alkene forms a different diastereomeric epoxide, which upon ring-opening gives different diastereomeric diols. Let's think about that.

Wait, let me try again. Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → epoxide A.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene + mCPBA → epoxide B.

Each epoxide is a meso compound but different from each other. Then, upon acid treatment, each epoxide becomes a diol. But since they're different epoxides, their diols would also be different.

Wait, but wait, if the epoxide is meso, then the diol would also be meso, which is achiral. So each reaction produces an achiral diol. But the diols from (E) and (Z) might be different.

Wait, but considering the symmetry, perhaps the diols from both reactions are the same. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the epoxide from (E) and (Z) are different. For example, the (E) epoxide is meso, and the (Z) epoxide is also meso but with a different configuration, so upon ring-opening, they form different diols.

Wait, but if both epoxides are meso, but different, then upon acid treatment, each would form a diol. Let me imagine the structure.

Let's say the epoxide from (E) is such that when it opens, the diol has two adjacent chiral centers, but since it's meso, the molecule is achiral. Similarly, the (Z) epoxide would open to form a diol that's also a meso compound but a different one. So the diols from (E) and (Z) would be different.

Wait, but wait, oct-4-ene is symmetric, so any epoxide derived from it would have the same substituents on each end. Therefore, perhaps the epoxides from (E) and (Z) alkenes are actually the same, which would then give the same diol after acid treatment. But that can't be right because the starting material is different.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's try to think about what the products are.

First, Reaction 1: (E)-oct-4-ene → epoxide A → diol A.

Reaction 2: (Z)-oct-4-ene → epoxide B → diol B.

Assuming the diols from each are different, then combining them would give two diastereomers. But wait, if the diols are each meso compounds, then each would be a single compound, not a mixture.

Wait, but wait, if the diol is a meso compound, it's achiral. So each reaction produces a single achiral diol. Now, when you combine the diols from both reactions, you get a mixture of two different diols.

Wait, but I thought the diols would be the same. Maybe I need to look at the possible structures.

Wait, another approach. Let me consider the product of each reaction.

For (E)-oct-4-ene treated with mCPBA, the epoxide formed would have the oxygen added on the same face. So considering the (E) configuration, the substituents on each end are opposite. So the epoxide would have the substituents on the same side, leading to a trans configuration in the epoxide.

Wait, but the molecule is symmetric, so the epoxide would have two stereocenters, but they are mirror images, making it a meso compound. So diol A would be a meso diol, which is achiral.

Similarly, for (Z)-oct-4-ene, the substituents are same side. So the epoxide would have substituents on the same face, but again, the molecule is symmetric. So the epoxide is a meso compound, leading to diol B, also a meso diol. But are diol A and diol B the same or different?

Wait, maybe I should imagine the structures. Let's say the (E) epoxide has the substituents on opposite sides, leading to a diol where the hydroxyl groups are on opposite sides, but because it's symmetric, it's a meso compound. The (Z) epoxide would have substituents on the same side, leading to the diol where the hydroxyls are on the same side, which is also a meso compound.

Wait, but are these two diols the same or different? Because if they're the same, then combining the products would give a single compound. But I don't think they are the same. Because the starting alkenes were different, the epoxides would be different, leading to different diols.

Wait, but maybe they actually result in the same diol. Because the epoxide from (E) and (Z) are different, but after acid treatment, they form the same diol. No, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the diol formed from (E)-epoxide and the diol from (Z)-epoxide are the same because the molecule is symmetric and both epoxides give the same diol, which is a meso compound.

Wait, that can't be right because the starting alkenes are different. I'm getting a bit stuck, so perhaps I should move forward, assuming that each reaction produces a different diol, which is a meso compound.

But wait, if each reaction produces a single meso diol, then combining the products would give a mixture of two different diols. So when run on a standard HPLC (achiral), each diol would elute as a single peak, leading to two peaks in total. On a chiral HPLC, which can separate enantiomers, each meso diol would not split, as they're achiral. Wait, no. Wait, a chiral HPLC column can separate enantiomers, but if the molecule is achiral (meso), it would not split. So in the chiral column, the meso diols would each appear as a single peak.

Wait, but if the diols are different, the standard HPLC would show two peaks, each as a single peak. The chiral HPLC would show two peaks as well, since each diol is a single compound (meso, so no enantiomers to separate). So in that case, the standard and chiral HPLC would each show two peaks.

But looking at the options, option C is 2 peaks in both, but option D is 3 in standard and 4 in chiral. Hmm. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, maybe each reaction produces more than one product. Let me think about the ring-opening step. When an epoxide is treated with acid, it typically forms a diol. But if the epoxide is symmetric, perhaps the ring-opening could lead to a single diastereomer or a racemic mixture. Wait, no. If the epoxide is a meso compound, the ring-opening could lead to an achiral diol, or possibly a racemic mixture, but wait, no: in the case of a symmetric epoxide, the ring-opening under acidic conditions would lead to a single diol, not a mixture.

Wait, but in reality, the ring-opening of a symmetric epoxide like that would produce a single diol because the molecule is symmetric, so the two possible attack pathways are the same. So each reaction produces a single diol, each being a meso compound. So when the two diols are combined, you have two different diols, each being meso.

Wait, but if the diols are different, then on the standard HPLC, which is achiral, each would appear as a single peak, leading to two peaks in total. On a chiral HPLC, each diol is a single peak because they are achiral. So that would be two peaks in both columns, which is option C.

But wait, I'm not sure. Let me think again. The diols from each reaction would be different. Each is a meso compound, so each would appear as a single peak on both HPLC columns. So in the combined product, you'd have two different compounds, each appearing as a single peak on both columns. So the standard would show two peaks, and the chiral would also show two peaks. So option C would be correct.

But wait, another possibility: when the epoxide is treated with acid, could it form more than one diastereomer? For example, if the epoxide is not symmetric, the ring-opening could form two different diastereomers. But in our case, the epoxide is symmetric, so the ring-opening would form only one product.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial epoxide from (E) and (Z) are diastereomers, leading to two different diols, each of which is a single compound.

Thus, when combined, they give two compounds. So standard HPLC (achiral) would show two peaks. Chiral HPLC would also show two peaks because each diol is a single compound (meso, so no enantiomers), so each is a singlet.

So the answer would be option C: 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 2 peaks in both. That would be the case if each reaction produces a single diol, and there are two different diols. So each HPLC would show two peaks.

Alternatively, perhaps each reaction produces two diastereomers, leading to more peaks.

Wait, maybe each reaction produces two diastereomeric diols. Let me think. For example, if the epoxide is not symmetric, the ring-opening could lead to two diastereomers. But in our case, the epoxide is symmetric, so it leads to a single diol.

Wait, but the epoxide is symmetric. So the diol would be a single product, which is a meso compound. So each reaction gives one diol. So when combined, two diols.

Thus, the HPLC would show two peaks in both cases.

So the correct answer would be C: 2 peaks in both standard and chiral HPLC.

But wait, another possibility: maybe each reaction produces two enantiomers, but since the diol is meso, they're the same. So each reaction gives a single diol, leading to two diols in total.

So in the combined product, there are two diols, each appearing as a single peak on both HPLC columns.

So the answer would be C.


The problem involves two reactions where (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are each treated with mCPBA, forming epoxides, followed by aqueous acid to open the epoxide rings, yielding diols. The products from both reactions are combined and analyzed using standard (achiral) and chiral HPLC columns. The goal is to determine the number of peaks observed in each chromatogram.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Epoxidation with mCPBA**:  
   - mCPBA adds an oxygen bridge across the double bond in a syn fashion.  
   - For (E)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on the double bond are opposite, leading to an epoxide where the substituents are on opposite sides. Due to the molecule's symmetry, this results in a meso compound.  
   - For (Z)-oct-4-ene, the substituents on the double bond are on the same side, leading to an epoxide where the substituents are on the same side. Again, due to symmetry, this also results in a meso compound.  

2. **Ring-Opening with Acid**:  
   - The epoxides undergo acid-catalyzed ring-opening to form diols.  
   - Both epoxides are symmetric, so the resulting diols are also meso compounds.  
   - The diols from (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are structurally different because the starting alkenes have different geometries.  

3. **HPLC Analysis**:  
   - **Standard (achiral) HPLC**:  
     - The standard HPLC column cannot distinguish between enantiomers but can separate diastereomers.  
     - Since the diols from (E)-oct-4-ene and (Z)-oct-4-ene are different diastereomers, the standard HPLC will show two distinct peaks.  
   - **Chiral HPLC**:  
     - The chiral HPLC column separates enantiomers.  
     - Since the diols are meso compounds (achiral), they will not split into enantiomers and will each appear as a single peak.  
     - Therefore, the chiral HPLC will also show two distinct peaks.  

### Conclusion:
The combined products of the two reactions yield two different diols, each of which is a meso compound. On the standard HPLC, these diols are separated as two distinct peaks due to their diastereomeric relationship. On the chiral HPLC, the meso nature of the diols prevents their splitting into enantiomers, resulting in two peaks as well.
