Okay, so I've got this question about astronomy, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. It says that large clouds of neutral hydrogen in deep space absorb the light from background quasars at the Lyman alpha wavelength, which is about 1216 Angstroms. The question is asking for the lower limit on the redshift of these objects so that they can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes. The options are A) 3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Hmm, I remember that Lyman alpha emission is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Hydrogen's Lyman series transitions involve electrons moving between energy levels. The Lyman alpha line is the transition from n=2 to n=1, which emits at around 121.6 nm, right? So 1216 Angstroms is 121.6 nm. That's in the far ultraviolet, I think.

But wait, quasars emit in various wavelengths, and when that light passes through neutral hydrogen clouds, the hydrogen absorbs it at the Lyman alpha wavelength. So the quasar's light is being absorbed, creating a absorption line. But since quasars are very far away, the expansion of the universe causes redshift. So the wavelength we observe is longer than the emitted wavelength.

The key here is to find the redshift z such that the observed wavelength is in the optical range because ground-based telescopes can't observe in the ultraviolet due to the atmosphere blocking those wavelengths. So the Lyman alpha absorption line must be shifted into the optical part of the spectrum.

Okay, so the rest wavelength λ0 is 1216 Angstroms. The observed wavelength λ is what we need to find, and it has to be in the optical range. What's the optical range again? I think optical roughly spans from about 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red). So 4000 Angstroms to 7000 Angstroms.

Wait, wait, 1 nanometer is 10 Angstroms. Oh wait no, wait, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms because 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. Wait, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms. So 400 nm is 4000 Angstroms (400 * 10 =4000 A), 700 nm is 7000 A. So the optical range is 4000 A to 7000 A.

So the Lyman alpha line at 1216 A is way in the UV, but when it's redshifted, we can observe it in the optical. So we need the observed wavelength λ = λ0 * (1 + z) to be >= 4000 A (because that's the start of optical). Because if λ is less than 4000, it's still in UV and not observable from the ground.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the quasar's emitted light is at 1216 A, but due to redshift, the observed wavelength is longer. So for the absorption line to be in the optical, the observed wavelength must be >=4000 A.

So let's compute the minimum redshift z where λ >=4000 A.

λ = λ0 * (1 + z)
So 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z)
Divide both sides by 1216: 4000 / 1216 = 1 + z

Calculating that: 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.290 approximately. So 1 + z = 3.290, so z ≈ 2.29.

So the redshift z has to be approximately 2.29. So the lower limit would be just above 2.29. Looking at the options, let's see: options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, so 2.29 is between 2.4 and 1.9. So the lower limit is 2.29. So any z higher than that would make the observed wavelength longer, still in optical. So the lower limit on z is about 2.29. So the options are C is 2.4, which is the next possible higher value. Because the question asks for the lower limit such that the object can be detected. So if z is at least 2.29, then it's in optical. So the minimal z is approximately 2.29, so any z greater than that would be acceptable. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So the minimal possible z is around 2.29, so the lowest possible in the options is C)2.4, which is the smallest option that's above 2.29. Because if z were 2.3, then that's just beyond 2.29. So the options only go up to 2.4 as the next higher option.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So, the lower limit is the minimum z needed so that the absorption line is in optical. So if z is higher than that, it's still detectable. So the minimal z is 2.29, so the lower limit is z >=2.29. So the options give me C as 2.4, which is the smallest option higher than 2.29. So option C is the correct choice.

Wait, but looking at the options again, D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29. So that would put the observed wavelength at λ =1216*(1+1.9)=1216*2.9= 3526.4 A. Oh, wait, that's 3526.4 A, which is 352.6 nm, which is in the UV, specifically around the near-UV, but wait, optical is about 400 nm and above. So 3526.4 A is 352.6 nm, which is below 400 nm, so it's in the UV, which ground telescopes can't see. So option D is too low, so the absorption line would be in UV, undetectable.

So the minimal z must be such that λ >=4000 A (400 nm). So when z is around 2.29, λ=4000 A. So to be detected, z must be at least 2.29. So the options are: the minimal possible z in the options is C)2.4.

Wait, but what's the exact calculation? Let me recompute.

λ0=1216 A.

Optical starts at λ=4000 A.

So 4000 =1216*(1+z)

z= (4000/1216) -1

Let me compute 4000 ÷ 1216.

Well, 1216 *3=3648, 1216*3.2= 3648 + 243.2=3891.2.

Wait 3.2 *1216 = 3891.2. Hmm, 4000-3891.2=108.8. So 108.8 /1216 is approximately 0.09. So 3.2 + 0.09≈3.29.

So z≈3.29-1=2.29.

So the redshift has to be at least approximately 2.29. So looking at the options, the only one that's higher than that is C)2.4 and A)3. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So the minimal z is 2.29, so the next possible option is 2.4, which is option C.

Wait, but why is option A 3? Because 3 would give λ=1216*(4)=4864 A, which is 486.4 nm, which is in the green part of the spectrum, definitely optical. So if z=3, it works. But the question is about the lower limit, so the minimal z. So the minimal z is around 2.29. So the lower limit on z is z >2.29. So the minimal z is approximately 2.29, so the next higher option is 2.4, which is option C.

To determine the lower limit on the redshift \( z \) such that the Lyman alpha absorption line at \( \lambda_0 = 1216 \, \text{Å} \) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to ensure that the observed wavelength \( \lambda \) is within the optical range. Optical wavelengths are approximately \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \) to \( 7000 \, \text{Å} \). The relationship between the observed wavelength and the redshift is given by:

\[
\lambda = \lambda_0 (1 + z)
\]

To find the lower limit on \( z \), we set \( \lambda = 4000 \, \text{Å} \) (the start of the optical range) and solve for \( z \):

\[
4000 = 1216 (1 + z)
\]

Dividing through by \( 1216 \):

\[
1 + z = \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29
\]

Subtracting 1:

\[
z \approx 2.29
\]

Thus, the redshift must be at least \( z \approx 2.29 \) for the Lyman alpha absorption line to be observed in the optical range. Among the given options, the smallest value greater than \( 2.29 \) is \( z = 2.4 \), corresponding to option C. Lower values, such as \( z = 1.9 \), would result in the absorption line remaining in the ultraviolet, which is not detectable by optical ground-based telescopes.

So the Lyman alpha line at 1216 A is way in the UV, but when it's redshifted, we can observe it in the optical. So we need the observed wavelength λ = λ0 * (1 + z) to be >= 4000 A (because that's the start of optical). Because if λ is less than 4000, it's still in UV and not observable from the ground.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If the quasar's emitted light is at 1216 A, but due to redshift, the observed wavelength is longer. So for the absorption line to be in the optical, the observed wavelength must be >=4000 A.

So let's compute the minimum redshift z where λ >=4000 A.

λ = λ0 * (1 + z)
So 4000 = 1216 * (1 + z)
Divide both sides by 1216: 4000 / 1216 = 1 + z

Calculating that: 4000 / 1216 ≈ 3.290 approximately. So 1 + z = 3.290, so z ≈ 2.29.

So the redshift z has to be approximately 2.29. So the lower limit would be just above 2.29. Looking at the options, let's see: options are A)3, B)1.2, C)2.4, D)1.9.

Wait, so 2.29 is between 2.4 and 1.9. So the lower limit is 2.29. So any z higher than that would make the observed wavelength longer, still in optical. So the lower limit on z is about 2.29. So the options are C is 2.4, which is the next possible higher value. Because the question asks for the lower limit such that the object can be detected. So if z is at least 2.29, then it's in optical. So the minimal z is approximately 2.29, so any z greater than that would be acceptable. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So the minimal possible z is around 2.29, so the lowest possible in the options is C)2.4, which is the smallest option that's above 2.29. Because if z were 2.3, then that's just beyond 2.29. So the options only go up to 2.4 as the next higher option.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The question is about the lower limit on the redshift. So, the lower limit is the minimum z needed so that the absorption line is in optical. So if z is higher than that, it's still detectable. So the minimal z is 2.29, so the lower limit is z >=2.29. So the options give me C as 2.4, which is the smallest option higher than 2.29. So option C is the correct choice.

Wait, but looking at the options again, D is 1.9, which is lower than 2.29. So that would put the observed wavelength at λ =1216*(1+1.9)=1216*2.9= 3526.4 A. Oh, wait, that's 3526.4 A, which is 352.6 nm, which is in the UV, specifically around the near-UV, but wait, optical is about 400 nm and above. So 3526.4 A is 352.6 nm, which is below 400 nm, so it's in the UV, which ground telescopes can't see. So option D is too low, so the absorption line would be in UV, undetectable.

So the minimal z must be such that λ >=4000 A (400 nm). So when z is around 2.29, λ=4000 A. So to be detected, z must be at least 2.29. So the options are: the minimal possible z in the options is C)2.4.

Wait, but what's the exact calculation? Let me recompute.

λ0=1216 A.

Optical starts at λ=4000 A.

So 4000 =1216*(1+z)

z= (4000/1216) -1

Let me compute 4000 ÷ 1216.

Well, 1216 *3=3648, 1216*3.2= 3648 + 243.2=3891.2.

Wait 3.2 *1216 = 3891.2. Hmm, 4000-3891.2=108.8. So 108.8 /1216 is approximately 0.09. So 3.2 + 0.09≈3.29.

So z≈3.29-1=2.29.

So the redshift has to be at least approximately 2.29. So looking at the options, the only one that's higher than that is C)2.4 and A)3. So the lower limit is z=2.29. So the minimal z is 2.29, so the next possible option is 2.4, which is option C.

Wait, but why is option A 3? Because 3 would give λ=1216*(4)=4864 A, which is 486.4 nm, which is in the green part of the spectrum, definitely optical. So if z=3, it works. But the question is about the lower limit, so the minimal z. So the minimal z is around 2.29. So the lower limit on z is z >2.29. So the minimal z is approximately 2.29, so the next higher option is 2.4, which is option C.


To determine the lower limit on the redshift \( z \) such that the Lyman alpha absorption line at \( \lambda_0 = 1216 \, \text{Å} \) can be detected with optical ground-based telescopes, we need to ensure that the observed wavelength \( \lambda \) is within the optical range. Optical wavelengths are approximately \( 4000 \, \text{Å} \) to \( 7000 \, \text{Å} \). The relationship between the observed wavelength and the redshift is given by:

\[
\lambda = \lambda_0 (1 + z)
\]

To find the lower limit on \( z \), we set \( \lambda = 4000 \, \text{Å} \) (the start of the optical range) and solve for \( z \):

\[
4000 = 1216 (1 + z)
\]

Dividing through by \( 1216 \):

\[
1 + z = \frac{4000}{1216} \approx 3.29
\]

Subtracting 1:

\[
z \approx 2.29
\]

Thus, the redshift must be at least \( z \approx 2.29 \) for the Lyman alpha absorption line to be observed in the optical range. Among the given options, the smallest value greater than \( 2.29 \) is \( z = 2.4 \), corresponding to option C. Lower values, such as \( z = 1.9 \), would result in the absorption line remaining in the ultraviolet, which is not detectable by optical ground-based telescopes.
