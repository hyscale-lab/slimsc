Okay, so I've got this astronomy problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem is about three exoplanets—Planet1, Planet2, and Planet3. They've been discovered using the TTV method, which I think stands for transit timing variations. But I'm not sure how that method works, but maybe it's not directly relevant here.

The question gives me some ratios. The equilibrium temperature ratio between Planet1 and Planet2 is about 1.4. So, Planet1's temperature is 1.4 times that of Planet2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, equilibrium temperature is usually given as T = T0 * sqrt(R/(2a)) * (1 - albedo)^0.5, where a is the orbital radius. So higher temperature would mean closer to the star, right?

Then, the temperature ratio between Planet2 and Planet3 is 2.3. So Planet2 is 2.3 times hotter than Planet3. So Planet3 is further away than Planet2, because as you go further out, the equilibrium temperature decreases.

Mass ratios are given as Planet1 to Planet2 is 1.15, so Planet1 is 15% more massive than Planet2. Then Planet2 to Planet3 is 1.35, so Planet2 is 35% more massive than Planet3. Wait, so Planet3 is less massive than Planet2, but that might not directly affect the orbital period unless mass affects the star's parameters. Hmm.

The albedo for all three is 0.3, same as Earth. So albedo is the same; that means the (1 - albedo) term is the same for all. So when calculating equilibrium temperature, that factor is the same for all three.

The question is about the orbital period of Planet3 compared to Planet1. How much larger is Planet3's period than Planet1's?

The options are A) ~10.4, B) ~3.2, C) ~4.4, D) ~33.4.

Hmm. So I think I need to find the ratio of orbital periods, P3/P1.

I remember that Kepler's third law says P² ∝ a³/(M), where M is the mass of the star. But wait, Kepler's law in the context of a star and orbiting planets is actually P² = (4π²/G(M)) * a³, assuming that the mass of the planet is negligible compared to the star. So if the star's mass is much larger than the planets, then M is the star's mass. But since we don't have info about the star's mass, perhaps it's being assumed that all three planets orbit the same star, so M is constant. So for each planet, P² is proportional to a³/(M). Since M is same, P² ∝ a³.

Wait, but in the problem, the masses of the planets are given. Does that affect the orbital period? Because Kepler's law for a planet depends on the star's mass, not the planet's. So I think the planet masses are probably irrelevant for the orbital period calculation. So the mass ratios given (like 1.15 between Planet1 and Planet2) probably don't affect the answer, unless the star's mass is varying, which it isn't. So I can ignore the mass ratios for this problem.

So the key factors are the equilibrium temperatures. Let me think about how equilibrium temperature relates to orbital radius and period.

Equilibrium temperature T is given by the formula:

T = T_star * sqrt( R/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5

Wait, more accurately, the formula is T = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * sqrt( (1 - albedo) ) ), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star is the star's radius, a is the planet's orbital radius, and albedo is the planet's albedo.

Since all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), the (1 - albedo) term is the same for all. So I can ignore that factor for the ratios.

Also, since all planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same for all. So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between any two planets depends only on the inverse square root of their orbital radii.

So, for Planet1 and Planet2: T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because T is proportional to sqrt( R/(a) ), so T1 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a1)), T2 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a2)).

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

The problem states that T1/T2 ≈ 1.4. So 1.4 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Squaring both sides: (1.4)^2 = a2 / a1 → 1.96 = a2/a1 → a2 = 1.96 * a1

Wait, wait; no, wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, T is proportional to sqrt(R/(2a)) as I said earlier. So T1 = k * sqrt(1/a1), T2 = k * sqrt(1/a2), where k is a constant including T_star and R_star and (1 - albedo)^0.5.

So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) → a2 = (T1^2 / T2^2) * a1.

Wait, no:

Wait, T1 = k * sqrt(1/(a1))

T2 = k * sqrt(1/(a2))

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So if T1/T2 is 1.4, then 1.4 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Squaring both sides: 1.96 = a2/a1 → a2 = 1.96 * a1

Wait, no, wait. Because T1 is larger than T2, that would mean a2 is larger than a1. Because higher equilibrium temperature implies closer to the star (smaller a). Wait, no, no. Wait, if a planet is closer to the star, a is smaller, and the temperature is higher. So if T1 is higher than T2, then a1 is smaller than a2.

Wait, let's think. Let's say a1 is the semi-major axis (orbital radius) of Planet1. If Planet1 is closer to the star, a1 is smaller, so T1 is higher. So if T1 is 1.4 times T2, then Planet1 is closer than Planet2.

Wait, but according to the calculation, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

If T1 > T2, then a2 > a1. That's correct because a2 is larger.

So a2 = (T1/T2)^2 * a1 → 1.96 * a1.

Similarly, for Planet2 and Planet3, the temperature ratio is T2/T3 = 2.3. So T2 is higher than T3, which means Planet2 is closer than Planet3. So a3 > a2.

So T2/T3 = sqrt( a3 / a2 )

So 2.3 = sqrt( a3 / a2 )

Squaring: 5.29 = a3/a2 → a3 = 5.29 * a2.

So now, let's express a3 in terms of a1.

We have a2 = 1.96 a1.

a3 =5.29 * a2 =5.29 *1.96 a1 = let's calculate that.

5.29 * 1.96 → let's compute 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 *1.96 is approx 0.5684. So total is 9.8 + 0.5684 = 10.3684. So a3 ≈ 10.3684 a1.

Now, the orbital period P is related to a via Kepler's third law, which is P² = (4π²/(G M)) a³, where M is the mass of the star. Assuming all three planets orbit the same star, M is the same for all, so P² ∝ a³. Therefore, P is proportional to a^(3/2).

So the ratio of P3 to P1 is (a3/a1)^(3/2).

We have a3/a1 = 10.3684 → so (10.3684)^(3/2) = ?

Let me compute 10.3684^(1.5).

First, compute the square root of 10.3684. Let's see: sqrt(10) is approx 3.1623, sqrt(10.3684) is a bit higher. Let me calculate 3.22^2=10.3684? Let's see: 3.22 *3.22= 3*3=9, 3*.22=0.66, .22*3=0.66, .22*.22=0.0484. So (3 + 0.22)^2 = 3^2 + 2*3*0.22 + 0.22^2 = 9 + 1.32 + 0.0484=10.3684. Exactly. So sqrt(10.3684) is 3.22.

So 10.3684^(3/2) = (10.3684^1) * (10.3684^0.5) )=10.3684 *3.22 ≈ let's compute that.

10 *3.22=32.2, 0.3684 *3.22≈1.186. So total ≈32.2 +1.186=33.386.

So P3/P1 ≈33.386 → approximately 33.4.

Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4.

Hmm, but wait. Wait, let's make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, let's recalculate the a3 in terms of a1.

First, T1/T2 =1.4 → which gives a2/a1 = (1.4)^2 =1.96 → a2=1.96 a1.

T2/T3=2.3 → a3/a2= (2.3)^2=5.29 → a3=5.29 a2=5.29 *1.96 a1=10.3684 a1.

So yes, a3=10.3684 a1.

So P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2) = [10.3684]^1.5.

Which is sqrt(10.3684) * (10.3684) → 3.22 *10.3684 ≈33.38.

So the factor is approximately 33.4. So the correct answer is D.

To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the relationships between equilibrium temperature, orbital radius, and Kepler's third law. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is given by:

\[
T \propto \sqrt{\frac{R}{a}}
\]

where \( R \) is the star's radius (constant for all planets) and \( a \) is the orbital radius. Since the albedo is the same for all planets, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between any two planets depends only on their orbital radii:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Radii
From the problem, the temperature ratios are:
- \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \)
- \( \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \)

Using the formula above:
1. For \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \):
   \[
   1.4 = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \implies \frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \implies a_2 = 1.96 \, a_1
   \]

2. For \( \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \):
   \[
   2.3 = \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}} \implies \frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \implies a_3 = 5.29 \, a_2
   \]

Substituting \( a_2 = 1.96 \, a_1 \) into \( a_3 = 5.29 \, a_2 \):
\[
a_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 \, a_1 = 10.3684 \, a_1
\]

### Step 2: Orbital Period Ratio
Kepler's third law states:
\[
P^2 \propto a^3
\]

Thus, the ratio of orbital periods is:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} \propto \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{a_3}{a_1} = 10.3684 \):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}
\]

First, calculate \( \sqrt{10.3684} \):
\[
\sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22
\]

Then, calculate \( (10.3684)^{3/2} \):
\[
(10.3684)^{3/2} = 10.3684 \times 3.22 \approx 33.386
\]

### Final Answer
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. Comparing this result with the options:

- **A) ~10.4**: Too small.
- **B) ~3.2**: Too small.
- **C) ~4.4**: Too small.
- **D) ~33.4**: Matches the calculated value.

So I think the planet masses are probably irrelevant for the orbital period calculation. So the mass ratios given (like 1.15 between Planet1 and Planet2) probably don't affect the answer, unless the star's mass is varying, which it isn't. So I can ignore the mass ratios for this problem.

So the key factors are the equilibrium temperatures. Let me think about how equilibrium temperature relates to orbital radius and period.

Equilibrium temperature T is given by the formula:

T = T_star * sqrt( R/(2a) ) * ( (1 - albedo) )^0.5

Wait, more accurately, the formula is T = T_star * sqrt( R_star/(2a) ) * sqrt( (1 - albedo) ) ), where T_star is the star's effective temperature, R_star is the star's radius, a is the planet's orbital radius, and albedo is the planet's albedo.

Since all three planets have the same albedo (0.3), the (1 - albedo) term is the same for all. So I can ignore that factor for the ratios.

Also, since all planets orbit the same star, T_star and R_star are the same for all. So the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between any two planets depends only on the inverse square root of their orbital radii.

So, for Planet1 and Planet2: T1 / T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Because T is proportional to sqrt( R/(a) ), so T1 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a1)), T2 = T_star * sqrt(R/(2a2)).

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

The problem states that T1/T2 ≈ 1.4. So 1.4 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Squaring both sides: (1.4)^2 = a2 / a1 → 1.96 = a2/a1 → a2 = 1.96 * a1

Wait, wait; no, wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, T is proportional to sqrt(R/(2a)) as I said earlier. So T1 = k * sqrt(1/a1), T2 = k * sqrt(1/a2), where k is a constant including T_star and R_star and (1 - albedo)^0.5.

So the ratio T1/T2 = sqrt(a2/a1) → a2 = (T1^2 / T2^2) * a1.

Wait, no:

Wait, T1 = k * sqrt(1/(a1))

T2 = k * sqrt(1/(a2))

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So T1/T2 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

So if T1/T2 is 1.4, then 1.4 = sqrt( a2 / a1 )

Squaring both sides: 1.96 = a2/a1 → a2 = 1.96 * a1

Wait, no, wait. Because T1 is larger than T2, that would mean a2 is larger than a1. Because higher equilibrium temperature implies closer to the star (smaller a). Wait, no, no. Wait, if a planet is closer to the star, a is smaller, and the temperature is higher. So if T1 is higher than T2, then a1 is smaller than a2.

Wait, let's think. Let's say a1 is the semi-major axis (orbital radius) of Planet1. If Planet1 is closer to the star, a1 is smaller, so T1 is higher. So if T1 is 1.4 times T2, then Planet1 is closer than Planet2.

Wait, but according to the calculation, T1/T2 = sqrt( a2/a1 )

If T1 > T2, then a2 > a1. That's correct because a2 is larger.

So a2 = (T1/T2)^2 * a1 → 1.96 * a1.

Similarly, for Planet2 and Planet3, the temperature ratio is T2/T3 = 2.3. So T2 is higher than T3, which means Planet2 is closer than Planet3. So a3 > a2.

So T2/T3 = sqrt( a3 / a2 )

So 2.3 = sqrt( a3 / a2 )

Squaring: 5.29 = a3/a2 → a3 = 5.29 * a2.

So now, let's express a3 in terms of a1.

We have a2 = 1.96 a1.

a3 =5.29 * a2 =5.29 *1.96 a1 = let's calculate that.

5.29 * 1.96 → let's compute 5 * 1.96 is 9.8, 0.29 *1.96 is approx 0.5684. So total is 9.8 + 0.5684 = 10.3684. So a3 ≈ 10.3684 a1.

Now, the orbital period P is related to a via Kepler's third law, which is P² = (4π²/(G M)) a³, where M is the mass of the star. Assuming all three planets orbit the same star, M is the same for all, so P² ∝ a³. Therefore, P is proportional to a^(3/2).

So the ratio of P3 to P1 is (a3/a1)^(3/2).

We have a3/a1 = 10.3684 → so (10.3684)^(3/2) = ?

Let me compute 10.3684^(1.5).

First, compute the square root of 10.3684. Let's see: sqrt(10) is approx 3.1623, sqrt(10.3684) is a bit higher. Let me calculate 3.22^2=10.3684? Let's see: 3.22 *3.22= 3*3=9, 3*.22=0.66, .22*3=0.66, .22*.22=0.0484. So (3 + 0.22)^2 = 3^2 + 2*3*0.22 + 0.22^2 = 9 + 1.32 + 0.0484=10.3684. Exactly. So sqrt(10.3684) is 3.22.

So 10.3684^(3/2) = (10.3684^1) * (10.3684^0.5) )=10.3684 *3.22 ≈ let's compute that.

10 *3.22=32.2, 0.3684 *3.22≈1.186. So total ≈32.2 +1.186=33.386.

So P3/P1 ≈33.386 → approximately 33.4.

Looking at the options, option D is ~33.4.

Hmm, but wait. Wait, let's make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, let's recalculate the a3 in terms of a1.

First, T1/T2 =1.4 → which gives a2/a1 = (1.4)^2 =1.96 → a2=1.96 a1.

T2/T3=2.3 → a3/a2= (2.3)^2=5.29 → a3=5.29 a2=5.29 *1.96 a1=10.3684 a1.

So yes, a3=10.3684 a1.

So P3/P1 = (a3/a1)^(3/2) = (10.3684)^(3/2) = [10.3684]^1.5.

Which is sqrt(10.3684) * (10.3684) → 3.22 *10.3684 ≈33.38.

So the factor is approximately 33.4. So the correct answer is D.


To determine the factor by which the orbital period of Planet3 is larger than that of Planet1, we use the relationships between equilibrium temperature, orbital radius, and Kepler's third law. The equilibrium temperature \( T \) of a planet is given by:

\[
T \propto \sqrt{\frac{R}{a}}
\]

where \( R \) is the star's radius (constant for all planets) and \( a \) is the orbital radius. Since the albedo is the same for all planets, the ratio of equilibrium temperatures between any two planets depends only on their orbital radii:

\[
\frac{T_1}{T_2} = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}}
\]

### Step 1: Relating Orbital Radii
From the problem, the temperature ratios are:
- \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \)
- \( \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \)

Using the formula above:
1. For \( \frac{T_1}{T_2} = 1.4 \):
   \[
   1.4 = \sqrt{\frac{a_2}{a_1}} \implies \frac{a_2}{a_1} = (1.4)^2 = 1.96 \implies a_2 = 1.96 \, a_1
   \]

2. For \( \frac{T_2}{T_3} = 2.3 \):
   \[
   2.3 = \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}} \implies \frac{a_3}{a_2} = (2.3)^2 = 5.29 \implies a_3 = 5.29 \, a_2
   \]

Substituting \( a_2 = 1.96 \, a_1 \) into \( a_3 = 5.29 \, a_2 \):
\[
a_3 = 5.29 \times 1.96 \, a_1 = 10.3684 \, a_1
\]

### Step 2: Orbital Period Ratio
Kepler's third law states:
\[
P^2 \propto a^3
\]

Thus, the ratio of orbital periods is:
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} \propto \left(\frac{a_3}{a_1}\right)^{3/2}
\]

Substituting \( \frac{a_3}{a_1} = 10.3684 \):
\[
\frac{P_3}{P_1} = (10.3684)^{3/2}
\]

First, calculate \( \sqrt{10.3684} \):
\[
\sqrt{10.3684} \approx 3.22
\]

Then, calculate \( (10.3684)^{3/2} \):
\[
(10.3684)^{3/2} = 10.3684 \times 3.22 \approx 33.386
\]

### Final Answer
The orbital period of Planet3 is approximately 33.4 times larger than that of Planet1. Comparing this result with the options:

- **A) ~10.4**: Too small.
- **B) ~3.2**: Too small.
- **C) ~4.4**: Too small.
- **D) ~33.4**: Matches the calculated value.
