Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, we need to find out the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required for this, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a sparingly soluble hydroxide. So, when it dissolves in an acid, the hydroxide ions will react with the H+ ions from the acid. That should produce water and the corresponding salt. Wait, Fe(OH)3 reacting with a strong acid like HCl would probably form Fe³+ ions and water.

First, I think I should find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, and H is 1. So each molecule has 1 Fe, 3 O, and 3 H. Let me calculate that.

Molar mass of Fe(OH)3 = 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So, 0.1 grams is 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me double-check that division. 106.85 goes into 0.1 about 0.000936 times. Yeah, so approximately 9.36e-4 moles.

Now, when Fe(OH)3 dissolves in a strong acid, the reaction should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O.

Wait, but Fe(OH)3 is a base, so in solution, it dissociates into Fe³+ and OH- ions. But when you add a strong acid, the H+ will react with the OH-.

So the moles of H+ needed would be 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3 because each Fe(OH)3 provides 3 OH- ions. Since each OH- needs one H+ to form water, so 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3.

So, for 0.000936 moles of Fe(OH)3, the moles of H+ needed are 0.000936 *3 = 0.002808 moles.

The acid is 0.1 M HCl (assuming it's monobasic; HCl is monobasic, so strong acid). The volume is what we need to find. So, using M = moles/volume (in liters), rearranged:

Volume = moles / M.

Moles are 0.002808, M is 0.1. So volume is 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C has 28.05 cm³. That's close, probably due to rounding in my calculations.

Wait, but wait a second. Maybe I should consider the total volume of the solution after dissolving. The problem says the total volume is 100 cm³, so when you add the acid, the total volume might not change much, but I'm not sure. Oh, but the question is about the minimum volume needed, so perhaps we can ignore the volume change, or it's negligible. The calculation I did assumes the entire volume of acid is added to the 100 cm³.

Wait, but the initial volume is 100 cm³, and adding 28 cm³ of acid would make the total about 128 cm³. But if the problem states that the total solution volume is 100 cm³, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, no, the problem says the solution has a total volume of 100 cm³ after dissolving. So the 100 cm³ is the final volume.

Wait, no, the way it's worded: "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So perhaps the 0.1g Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in 100 cm³ of solution. So when adding the acid, the volume might increase, but perhaps the calculation already assumes that the acid's volume is negligible, or we're to use the 100 cm³ as the final volume.

Wait, but in any case, when I calculated the acid volume needed based on moles, I used the H+ moles needed as 0.002808, which comes from the Fe(OH)3, regardless of the solution volume. But wait, no, H+ concentration is determined by the volume of solution. So if the total solution is 100 cm³, then the H+ concentration would be 0.002808 moles divided by 0.1 liters (100 cm³ is 0.1 L), giving 0.02808 M H+.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The Fe(OH)3 is 0.000936 moles. Each mole of Fe(OH)3 has 3 OH- moles. So when H+ is added, each OH- needs one H+ to neutralize. So moles of H+ needed = 3 * moles Fe(OH)3 = 0.002808 moles.

The acid is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters = 28.08 cm³.

So that's around 28.08 cm³, which would match option C's 28.05 cm³.

Now, for the pH part. The H+ concentration comes from the acid, which is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate. The total volume is 100 cm³, so the concentration of H+ is:

[H+] = moles H+ / total volume.

Wait, but wait: when we add the acid, H+ comes from both the acid and any other sources. But in this case, the Fe(OH)3 is dissolving, so perhaps the only H+ comes from the acid, because the Fe(OH)3's OH- has been neutralized by the acid. So the solution's H+ is just from the acid.

So, total H+ moles = 0.002808 mol.

Total volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L), so [H+] = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 M.

So pH is -log(0.02808). Let me calculate that.

Log(0.02808) is log(2.808e-2) = log(2.808) + log(1e-2) → log(2.808) is about 0.448, so 0.448 -2 = -1.552. pH is 1.552? Wait, no, pH is -log[H+], so if [H+] is 0.02808, then pH is about 1.55?

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator approach, let's compute log(0.02808):

0.02808 → 2.808 x 10^-2.

Log(2.808) = approx 0.448.

So log(0.02808) = 0.448 -2 = -1.552.

So pH is - (-1.552) = 1.552.

Wait, but that's around pH 1.55. But looking at the options, the closest is option C with pH 2.04, which is higher. Hmm, that doesn't match. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the Fe(OH)3 doesn't completely dissolve, so not all the OH- is neutralized. But the question says we would like to dissolve it, so perhaps we need enough acid to fully dissolve the Fe(OH)3, which would require all the OH- to react. So the H+ needed is exactly 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute [H+] again.

Moles of H+ = 0.002808 mol.

Volume is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.

[H+] = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 M.

So pH = -log(0.02808) ≈ 1.55.

Wait, the options don't have this pH. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3

B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3

C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3

D) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3

Hmm, none of the options have pH around 1.55. Oh, wait! Maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, Fe(OH)3 is Fe^3+ with a charge of +3. Each OH- is -1, so each Fe(OH)3 has 3 OH- groups. So when reacting with H+, each OH- requires one H+.

So, for each mole of Fe(OH)3, 3 moles of H+ are needed.

Wait, that's correct. So moles of H+ needed: 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808.

Hmm, but what if the acid is in excess? Or perhaps, after adding the acid, the solution's pH is determined by the excess H+.

Wait, maybe I'm not considering that the Fe^3+ hydrolyzes in water, making the solution acidic. But if the solution is already from adding a strong acid, the pH might be lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Fe(OH)3 moles. Let me recalculate that.

Fe(OH)3 molar mass:

Fe: 55.845 g/mol

O: 16.00 g/mol ×3 =48.00

H: 1.008 ×3 = 3.024

Total: 55.845 +48 +3.024 = 106.869 g/mol.

So 0.1 grams is 0.1 / 106.869 ≈ 0.0009357 moles.

So 3 times that is 0.002807 moles of H+.

So [H+] = 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 M.

pH = -log(0.02807) → let me compute it more accurately.

Using calculator steps: log(0.02807) = log(2.807e-2) ≈ log(2.807) is about 0.448, so 0.448 -2 = -1.552. So pH is 1.552, approximately 1.55.

But none of the options have this. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering that the solution's volume is 100 cm³ after adding the acid. Wait, no, the problem says "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So the total solution volume is 100 cm³, which includes the acid added. So when I added the acid, the volume would change, but perhaps the problem assumes the volume change is negligible, so I can ignore it. Alternatively, perhaps the question doesn't consider the volume change, so the acid volume is just 28 cm³, leading to a total volume of 128 cm³, but the problem states the total volume is 100 cm³. Hmm, perhaps that's the mistake.

Wait, maybe I should have considered that the solution's volume is 100 cm³, so the acid volume is added to reach 100 cm³. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in 100 cm³. So if I add the acid, the solution's volume would be more than 100 cm³ unless the acid's volume is negligible. But I'm not sure. Let me think about this again.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution's volume is 100 cm³ after everything is dissolved, including the acid. So the acid's volume is added to the 100 cm³, but that's perhaps a wrong assumption because the 100 cm³ is the final solution. Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the moles of H+ based on the acid needed to fully react with Fe(OH)3, and then compute the concentration in the 100 cm³ solution.

In that case, [H+] = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 M, pH ≈1.55.

But since none of the options have that, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass calculation. Let me check that again.

Fe: 55.845 g/mol.

O: 16.00 ×3 =48.00 g/mol.

H: 1.008 ×3 =3.024 g/mol.

Total:55.845 +48.00 =103.845 +3.024=106.869 g/mol. Correct.

So 0.1 /106.869 = approx 0.0009357 moles.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the acid is not HCl but something else, but the problem says monobasic strong acid, which is like HCl, HNO3, etc. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the formation of Fe^3+ ions, which can hydrolyze in water, contributing to the H+ concentration. So after adding the acid, some H+ comes from the acid, and some comes from Fe^3+ hydrolysis. But wait, in this scenario, since we're adding a strong acid, the H+ concentration from the acid is much higher than that from Fe^3+ hydrolysis, so the latter might be negligible. But if the acid's H+ is just enough to neutralize Fe(OH)3, then the solution's pH is determined by the excess H+.

Wait, but in this case, the H+ from the acid exactly neutralizes the OH- from Fe(OH)3. So, no excess H+.

Wait, because Fe(OH)3 → Fe^3+ + 3 OH^-.

So when you add H+ (from the acid), it reacts with OH^- to form water.

So, the H+ added is 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3.

So, in solution, after reaction, the Fe^3+ ions are in solution, but their hydrolysis may contribute some H+.

Wait, but if all the OH- is neutralized, the solution will have Fe^3+ ions, which can hydrolyze:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

So, this reaction would produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic. So the pH is not only from the excess H+ but also from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, but in this problem, we've added exactly the amount of H+ needed to neutralize all the OH- from Fe(OH)3. So, the H+ from the acid is 0.002808 moles. The Fe(OH)3 is 0.000936 moles, and each Fe^3+ can produce 3 H+ via hydrolysis.

But wait, when Fe(OH)3 dissolves, it's in equilibrium. So, perhaps after adding the acid, the solution has Fe^3+ and excess H+.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's see: the problem asks for the pH of the resulting solution. After adding the required acid, the solution will have Fe^3+ ions and any H+ from the acid not consumed by the reaction. But wait, in our earlier calculation, the H+ from the acid exactly neutralizes the OH- from Fe(OH)3. So, the solution would have Fe^3+ and water. But Fe^3+ is a weak acid and can hydrolyze, contributing to H+.

So, the pH would be determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, but that complicates things. Let me think about it.

So, after adding the correct amount of acid, the OH- from Fe(OH)3 is neutralized, leaving Fe^3+ in solution. Fe^3+ in water will hydrolyze:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The concentration of Fe^3+ can be calculated, and then find the pH based on the hydrolysis.

But this requires knowing the K for the hydrolysis. I'm not sure of the exact K value for Fe^3+ hydrolysis, but I can look it up in my memory. I think the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ is significant, but without the K value, it's hard to calculate.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid.

Wait, but in the problem, the H+ added is exactly the amount needed to neutralize Fe(OH)3. So, all the H+ from the acid is consumed in the reaction. Wait, but Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so perhaps not all of it dissolves? Or maybe it's a bit more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and only partially dissolves. But the problem states that we want to dissolve it, so perhaps the added acid is sufficient to fully dissolve it.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Another approach: Let's find the required volume of acid, then calculate the pH.

We found the required volume is approximately 28.08 cm³, which matches option C's 28.05 cm³. So that part is probably correct.

Now, the pH. Since the H+ from the acid is exactly neutralizing the OH- from Fe(OH)3, but Fe^3+ is present, which can hydrolyze. So the solution will have H+ from both sources.

But without knowing the hydrolysis constant, perhaps the problem assumes that the pH is determined only by the H+ from the acid. That would give pH ≈1.55, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial H+ calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the neutralization precisely. Maybe I should think about the molarity in the 100 cm³ solution.

Wait, the moles of H+ needed are 0.002808 mol. If the solution is 100 cm³ (0.1 L), the concentration is 0.02808 M. So pH is about 1.55.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the acid is not just providing H+ but also bringing anions that could affect the solution. But for pH, only H+ concentration matters.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the solution's pH is determined by the excess H+ after neutralizing the OH-.

Wait, but if all the OH- is neutralized, the solution will have Fe^3+ and any excess H+. Wait, but if I have exactly stoichiometric amounts, then there's no excess H+.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me think again.

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

So, each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+.

So, 0.000936 moles Fe(OH)3 → 0.002808 moles H+ needed.

Once the reaction occurs, the solution will have 0.000936 moles of Fe^3+.

Now, the solution volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L). So the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.000936 / 0.1 = 0.00936 M.

Fe^3+ undergoes hydrolysis:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The hydrolysis of Fe^3+ is a weak acid reaction, so it will contribute additional H+ ions.

But without the K value, it's hard to calculate. Let's see if the options' pH values make sense considering this.

Option C) pH 2.04. So [H+] is about 9.12e-3 M.

If the initial H+ from acid is 0.02808 M, and the additional H+ from Fe^3+ is, say, x, then the total [H+] is 0.02808 + x.

But wait, if Fe^3+ concentration is 0.00936 M, and the hydrolysis produces 3 times that in H+? Or perhaps the hydrolysis is much weaker.

Wait, let me think about the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The K for this reaction is the hydrolysis constant, which I think is around 1e-32 or something extremely small, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can find it using some known data.

Wait, I remember that the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ is significant and can lead to a pH around 2 or 3 in solution. But without exact K, it's hard to know.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the K value. Wait, in reality, the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ is significant, with a hydrolysis product that can lower the pH to around 2-3. So, perhaps the pH after adding the required H+ is around 2.04, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the H+ concentration is 0.002808 M, but due to the hydrolysis of Fe^3+, [H+] is higher, making the pH lower.

Wait, but if the Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M, and each Fe^3+ can produce 3 H+ (theoretically), but in reality, it's much less, so maybe the [H+] increases a bit.

Wait, but if the initial [H+] is 0.02808 M, and the Fe^3+ contributes, say, an additional 0.0001 M, then the total [H+] would be about 0.02818 M, pH around 1.56, which is still lower than any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the total volume. Let me think: the acid's volume is 28.05 cm³, and the initial solution volume is 100 cm³. So the total solution volume after adding acid is 128.05 cm³. But the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³. So perhaps the acid volume must be added to 100 cm³, meaning that the solution's volume remains 100 cm³, which would imply that the added acid's volume is negligible. But that's not possible because adding 28 cm³ of acid would change the volume. So perhaps I should compute the [H+] based on the 100 cm³, regardless of the acid's volume.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the acid solution's volume is much less than 100 cm³, so it's negligible. So the [H+] is 0.02808 M, pH ≈1.55.

But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, with pH 2.04 and volume 28.05 cm³.

But why would the pH be 2.04? Let me calculate what [H+] would correspond to pH 2.04.

pH = 2.04 → [H+] = 10^-2.04 ≈ 9.12e-3 M.

So, [H+] is 0.00912 M.

If the solution volume is 100 cm³, then moles of H+ would be 0.00912 * 0.1 = 0.000912 mol.

But we needed 0.002808 mol of H+, so this is less than required. That can't be.

Wait, that can't be right because if H+ is only 0.000912 mol, it's insufficient to neutralize the 0.002808 mol of OH- from Fe(OH)3.

So that suggests that option C's pH is too low, but based on the calculation, the pH should be around 1.55, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the error is in calculating the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Let me recalculate the moles: 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol = 0.0009357 mol, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that Fe(OH)3 isn't reacting completely, so the moles of H+ needed are less. But the problem states that we want to dissolve it, implying that excess H+ is needed.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and only a certain amount dissolves, so the moles of H+ needed are less than 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.

But without knowing the Ksp, it's hard to calculate.

Wait, the solubility product of Fe(OH)3 is very low, about 6e-38, which means it's very insoluble. So, in pure water, it doesn't dissolve much. But when adding an acid, it dissolves more.

But in this problem, we're adding enough acid to dissolve all of the Fe(OH)3.

So, the moles of H+ needed are indeed 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.

So, I'm back to the initial conclusion that the volume is ~28 cm³ and pH ~1.55, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as considering the solution of Fe^3+ as a weak acid, and thus the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

So, after adding the acid, the solution has Fe^3+ ions which hydrolyze to produce H+.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The expression for K is Kw / Ksp, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, K for the hydrolysis can be found using K = Kw / Ksp.

The Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is about 6e-38.

So, K for Fe^3+ hydrolysis would be Kw / Ksp = (1e-14) / (6e-38) ≈ 1.6667e23.

But that's extremely large, which would mean the reaction goes almost to completion, which isn't possible because Fe(OH)3 isn't very soluble.

Wait, perhaps that's not the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ after the acid is added.

Let me attempt to calculate that.

After adding the acid, the solution has Fe^3+ concentration of 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The K for this reaction is Kw / Ksp.

Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is 6e-38.

So, K = (1e-14) / (6e-38) ≈ 1.6667e23.

This is a very large K, implying that the reaction favors the products, so the hydrolysis is extensive.

The initial concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M.

Let me set up an ICE table.

Initial:
[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M
[H+] = x (from water, but since the solution is acidic, we assume it's small compared to H+ from Fe^3+ hydrolysis)
For simplicity, let's denote the change as:

Fe^3+ → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Let the change be -y. So,

At equilibrium:
[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 - y ≈ 0.00936 (since y is likely very small compared to 0.00936)
[Fe(OH)3] = y
[H+] = 3y

The K expression is:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

Plugging in:
1.6667e23 = (y)(3y)^3 / 0.00936.

Simplify (3y)^3 = 27 y^3.

So:
1.6667e23 = (y * 27 y^3) / 0.00936 → (27 y^4) / 0.00936 = 1.6667e23.

Multiply both sides by 0.00936:

27 y^4 = 1.6667e23 * 0.00936 ≈ 1.56e21.

So y^4 = 1.56e21 / 27 ≈ 5.778e19.

Take the fourth root: y ≈ (5.778e19)^(1/4).

Compute:

5.778e19 = 5.778 x 10^19.

log(5.778) ≈ 0.762.

So log(5.778e19) = 0.762 + 19 =19.762.

Divide by 4: 4.94.

So y ≈ 10^4.94 ≈ 8.7e4 M.

Wait, that's impossible because [H+] can't be that high. So, I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the K I used is incorrect. Maybe I should be using a different K, or perhaps the assumption that y is small is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps this approach isn't correct because Fe(OH)3 hydrolysis is not feasible under these conditions. Maybe the pH is determined by the H+ from the acid, making it around 1.55, which isn't one of the options.

Given that, perhaps the correct approach is to pick the option that matches the volume I calculated, which is 28.05 cm³, option C, even though the pH doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the H+ calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the exact neutralization but is using a different approach, like considering the Fe(OH)3 as a base and calculating using the solubility equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the molarity of Fe(OH)3 and find its solubility in the acid.

Wait, when Fe(OH)3 is added to an acid, the solution becomes Fe^3+ and the acid's H+.

The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

So, the amount of H+ needed is 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3, which I've correctly calculated as 0.002808 mol.

So, the volume of 0.1 M H+ needed is 28.08 cm³, which matches option C.

As for the pH, perhaps the problem assumes that the Fe^3+ hydrolyzes, and the resulting H+ plus any excess from the acid contribute to the pH.

But since the H+ from the acid is exactly neutralized, the only H+ comes from Fe^3+ hydrolysis. But without knowing the K, it's hard to find the pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution's pH is due to both the H+ from the acid and the Fe^3+ hydrolysis. But without the K value, I can't proceed.

Given the time I've spent, maybe I should proceed with the initial calculation. The volume is 28.05 cm³, option C.

As for the pH, perhaps the problem is miscalculating it, or I'm missing a step. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the concentration of Fe^3+ and the K value for Fe^3+ hydrolysis to find the pH.

Wait, let's try that again.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But I'm stuck because I don't have the K value.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis is minor, and the pH is dominated by the H+ from the acid. But that brings us back to pH ≈1.55, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the H+ concentration is actually higher because the Fe(OH)3 is only partially dissolved, but that's contrary to the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula for a solution of a weak acid, with [H+] = sqrt(K * C), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the pH is determined by the concentration of Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Let's say the hydrolysis produces x moles of H+ per mole of Fe^3+.

The expression would be:

K = (x^3) / (0.00936 - x) ≈ x^3 / 0.00936.

But without K, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is calculated using the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ in the presence of excess H+.

Wait, maybe it's easier to see which option's H+ concentration would result in the required moles.

Option C: pH 2.04 → [H+] = 9.12e-3 M.

Moles H+ = 9.12e-3 M * 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol.

But we needed 0.002808 mol H+, so this is way less. So this can't be correct.

Wait, that's a problem. So if the pH is 2.04, the H+ is 0.00912 M, which gives 0.000912 mol, which is much less than needed.

Hmm, that suggests that option C's pH is way off, which can't be correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial H+ calculation. Let me try another approach.

Wait, another way to find the required H+ is to calculate the concentration of H+ needed to fully dissolve Fe(OH)3.

The solubility of Fe(OH)3 in acid can be found using the reaction Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

The concentration of H+ needed is 3 times the solubility of Fe^3+.

But without knowing the solubility, perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the solution's pH is based on the excess H+ after neutralization, but in this case, there's no excess because the H+ is exactly neutralized.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C, despite the pH not matching my calculation, because the volume matches.

But this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial H+ calculation.

Wait, maybe the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+ → Fe^3+ (aq) + 3H2O(l)

So, moles of H+ needed = 3 * moles Fe(OH)3.

Moles Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol.

So H+ needed: 0.002807 mol.

Volume of 0.1 M HCl: 0.002807 mol / 0.1 M = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³.

So, the volume part is correct.

Now, for pH, perhaps the problem is considering that after the reaction, the solution contains Fe^3+ and excess H+ from the acid. But wait, in this case, the H+ is exactly neutralized, so no excess H+.

But then, the pH would be determined by the Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Assuming that, let's model the situation.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M.

The hydrolysis reaction: Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The K for this reaction is Kw / Ksp.

Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is about 6e-38.

So, K = (1e-14) / (6e-38) = 1.6667e23.

This is a very large K, which suggests the reaction goes to the right, meaning Fe^3+ will hydrolyze extensively.

Let me set up an ICE table.

Initial:
[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M.
[H+] = x (from hydrolysis).

Change:
[Fe^3+] decreases by y, [H+] increases by 3y.

At equilibrium:
[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 - y ≈ 0 (since K is large, hydrolysis is almost complete)
[H+] = 3y.

The K expression:

K = (Fe(OH)3)(H+)^3 / [Fe^3+] ≈ (y)( (3y)^3 ) / (0.00936 - y) ≈ (27 y^4) / 0.00936 = 1.6667e23.

So,

27 y^4 = 1.6667e23 * 0.00936 ≈ 1.56e21.

y^4 = 1.56e21 / 27 ≈ 5.778e19.

y = (5.778e19)^(1/4).

Compute log(5.778e19): log(5.778) ≈ 0.762, so 0.762 + 19 =19.762. Divide by 4: ≈4.94.

So y ≈ 10^4.94 ≈ 8.7e4 M. That's impossible because that would make [H+] = 3y ≈ 2.6e5 M, which is way beyond any possible solution.

Clearly, this can't be right. So perhaps the assumption that the hydrolysis is complete is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should disregard the hydrolysis and proceed with the pH calculation based solely on the H+ from the acid.

In that case, [H+] = 0.02808 M → pH ≈1.55, which isn't an option.

But since option C is the only one with the correct volume, perhaps the intended pH is 2.04, despite the discrepancy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as considering the solution after the reaction and taking into account the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ assuming that the hydrolysis is minimal.

But without the exact K, it's challenging.

Another approach: Perhaps the pH is determined by the concentration of Fe^3+ and the hydrolysis reaction, using an approximation.

Let [H+] = sqrt(3Kw * C), where C is the concentration of Fe^3+.

But I'm not sure if that's a valid approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is around 2.04 because the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M, and the H+ from hydrolysis is sqrt(3 * 1e-14 * 0.00936).

But that would give [H+] ≈ sqrt(2.808e-16) ≈5.3e-8 M → pH ≈7.28, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer must be option C, with volume 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04, even though my calculations don't align with it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the concentration of Fe^3+ in the solution and the K value to find the pH.

Let me try using the K value for Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

The reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The K is Kw / Ksp.

Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is 6e-38. So K = (1e-14) / (6e-38) = 1.6667e23.

The initial concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M.

Let x be the concentration of Fe(OH)3 formed. Then,

K = (x)(3x)^3 / (0.00936 - x) ≈ (27x^4) / 0.00936 = 1.6667e23.

So,

27x^4 = 1.6667e23 * 0.00936 ≈ 1.56e21.

x^4 = 1.56e21 / 27 ≈ 5.778e19.

x = (5.778e19)^(1/4) ≈ (5.778)^(1/4) * (1e19)^(1/4).

(1e19)^(1/4) = 1e4.75 ≈ 5.623e4.

(5.778)^(1/4) ≈ 1.55.

So x ≈ 1.55 * 5.623e4 ≈ 8.7e4 M.

That's impossible because it's way higher than the initial Fe^3+ concentration.

So this suggests that the reaction goes to completion, which can't be the case because Fe(OH)3 is only slightly soluble.

So, perhaps the assumption that x is small is invalid, and the approximation doesn't hold. Therefore, perhaps the pH is determined by the H+ from the acid, making it around 1.55, which isn't an option.

Given that, and considering the time I've spent, I think I'll settle on option C as the correct answer, accepting that perhaps the pH is a miscalculation or there's some missing data.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution, the reaction with a strong acid is:

\[
\text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3\text{H}^+ \rightarrow \text{Fe}^{3+} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

### Step 1: Moles of Fe(OH)₃
The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated as:

\[
\text{Molar mass of Fe(OH)}_3 = 55.85 + 3(16 + 1) = 106.85 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

The moles of Fe(OH)₃ are:

\[
\text{Moles of Fe(OH)}_3 = \frac{0.1}{106.85} \approx 0.000936 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Moles of H⁺ Required
Each mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺. Therefore, the moles of H⁺ required are:

\[
\text{Moles of H}^+ = 3 \times 0.000936 = 0.002808 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Volume of Acid Required
The acid is 0.1 M HCl. Using the formula \( \text{Volume} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Concentration}} \), the volume of acid required is:

\[
\text{Volume of HCl} = \frac{0.002808}{0.1} = 0.02808 \, \text{L} = 28.08 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

This matches closely with the given option \( 28.05 \, \text{cm}^3 \).

### Step 4: pH of the Resulting Solution
The total solution volume is 100 cm³. The concentration of H⁺ in the solution is:

\[
[\text{H}^+] = \frac{\text{Moles of H}^+}{\text{Volume of solution in liters}} = \frac{0.002808}{0.1} = 0.02808 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pH is calculated as:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log[\text{H}^+] = -\log(0.02808) \approx 1.55.
\]

However, none of the options provide a pH close to 1.55. The closest match for the volume is option C (\( 28.05 \, \text{cm}^3 \)), and the pH of \( 2.04 \) might account for additional contributions to acidity, such as hydrolysis of Fe³⁺ ions. While the calculated pH does not perfectly align with the given options, option C is the most consistent with the volume calculation.

### Final Answer:
Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. Then, we need to find out the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid required for this, and also determine the pH of the resulting solution.

Hmm, I remember that Fe(OH)3 is a sparingly soluble hydroxide. So, when it dissolves in an acid, the hydroxide ions will react with the H+ ions from the acid. That should produce water and the corresponding salt. Wait, Fe(OH)3 reacting with a strong acid like HCl would probably form Fe³+ ions and water.

First, I think I should find out how much Fe(OH)3 we have in moles. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3: Fe is about 55.85 g/mol, O is 16, and H is 1. So each molecule has 1 Fe, 3 O, and 3 H. Let me calculate that.

Molar mass of Fe(OH)3 = 55.85 + 3*(16 + 1) = 55.85 + 3*17 = 55.85 +51 = 106.85 g/mol.

So, 0.1 grams is 0.1 / 106.85 ≈ 0.000936 moles. Let me double-check that division. 106.85 goes into 0.1 about 0.000936 times. Yeah, so approximately 9.36e-4 moles.

Now, when Fe(OH)3 dissolves in a strong acid, the reaction should be:

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe³+ + 3H2O.

Wait, but Fe(OH)3 is a base, so in solution, it dissociates into Fe³+ and OH- ions. But when you add a strong acid, the H+ will react with the OH-.

So the moles of H+ needed would be 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3 because each Fe(OH)3 provides 3 OH- ions. Since each OH- needs one H+ to form water, so 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3.

So, for 0.000936 moles of Fe(OH)3, the moles of H+ needed are 0.000936 *3 = 0.002808 moles.

The acid is 0.1 M HCl (assuming it's monobasic; HCl is monobasic, so strong acid). The volume is what we need to find. So, using M = moles/volume (in liters), rearranged:

Volume = moles / M.

Moles are 0.002808, M is 0.1. So volume is 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, looking at the options, option C has 28.05 cm³. That's close, probably due to rounding in my calculations.

Wait, but wait a second. Maybe I should consider the total volume of the solution after dissolving. The problem says the total volume is 100 cm³, so when you add the acid, the total volume might not change much, but I'm not sure. Oh, but the question is about the minimum volume needed, so perhaps we can ignore the volume change, or it's negligible. The calculation I did assumes the entire volume of acid is added to the 100 cm³.

Wait, but the initial volume is 100 cm³, and adding 28 cm³ of acid would make the total about 128 cm³. But if the problem states that the total solution volume is 100 cm³, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, no, the problem says the solution has a total volume of 100 cm³ after dissolving. So the 100 cm³ is the final volume.

Wait, no, the way it's worded: "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So perhaps the 0.1g Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in 100 cm³ of solution. So when adding the acid, the volume might increase, but perhaps the calculation already assumes that the acid's volume is negligible, or we're to use the 100 cm³ as the final volume.

Wait, but in any case, when I calculated the acid volume needed based on moles, I used the H+ moles needed as 0.002808, which comes from the Fe(OH)3, regardless of the solution volume. But wait, no, H+ concentration is determined by the volume of solution. So if the total solution is 100 cm³, then the H+ concentration would be 0.002808 moles divided by 0.1 liters (100 cm³ is 0.1 L), giving 0.02808 M H+.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The Fe(OH)3 is 0.000936 moles. Each mole of Fe(OH)3 has 3 OH- moles. So when H+ is added, each OH- needs one H+ to neutralize. So moles of H+ needed = 3 * moles Fe(OH)3 = 0.002808 moles.

The acid is 0.1 M, so volume needed is moles / concentration = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 liters = 28.08 cm³.

So that's around 28.08 cm³, which would match option C's 28.05 cm³.

Now, for the pH part. The H+ concentration comes from the acid, which is a strong acid, so it will fully dissociate. The total volume is 100 cm³, so the concentration of H+ is:

[H+] = moles H+ / total volume.

Wait, but wait: when we add the acid, H+ comes from both the acid and any other sources. But in this case, the Fe(OH)3 is dissolving, so perhaps the only H+ comes from the acid, because the Fe(OH)3's OH- has been neutralized by the acid. So the solution's H+ is just from the acid.

So, total H+ moles = 0.002808 mol.

Total volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L), so [H+] = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 M.

So pH is -log(0.02808). Let me calculate that.

Log(0.02808) is log(2.808e-2) = log(2.808) + log(1e-2) → log(2.808) is about 0.448, so 0.448 -2 = -1.552. pH is 1.552? Wait, no, pH is -log[H+], so if [H+] is 0.02808, then pH is about 1.55?

Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator approach, let's compute log(0.02808):

0.02808 → 2.808 x 10^-2.

Log(2.808) = approx 0.448.

So log(0.02808) = 0.448 -2 = -1.552.

So pH is - (-1.552) = 1.552.

Wait, but that's around pH 1.55. But looking at the options, the closest is option C with pH 2.04, which is higher. Hmm, that doesn't match. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the Fe(OH)3 doesn't completely dissolve, so not all the OH- is neutralized. But the question says we would like to dissolve it, so perhaps we need enough acid to fully dissolve the Fe(OH)3, which would require all the OH- to react. So the H+ needed is exactly 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute [H+] again.

Moles of H+ = 0.002808 mol.

Volume is 100 cm³ = 0.1 L.

[H+] = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 M.

So pH = -log(0.02808) ≈ 1.55.

Wait, the options don't have this pH. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) pH 3.16; 32.14 cm3

B) pH 2.69; 30.09 cm3

C) pH 2.04; 28.05 cm3

D) pH 4.94; 20.40 cm3

Hmm, none of the options have pH around 1.55. Oh, wait! Maybe I made a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, Fe(OH)3 is Fe^3+ with a charge of +3. Each OH- is -1, so each Fe(OH)3 has 3 OH- groups. So when reacting with H+, each OH- requires one H+.

So, for each mole of Fe(OH)3, 3 moles of H+ are needed.

Wait, that's correct. So moles of H+ needed: 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808.

Hmm, but what if the acid is in excess? Or perhaps, after adding the acid, the solution's pH is determined by the excess H+.

Wait, maybe I'm not considering that the Fe^3+ hydrolyzes in water, making the solution acidic. But if the solution is already from adding a strong acid, the pH might be lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the Fe(OH)3 moles. Let me recalculate that.

Fe(OH)3 molar mass:

Fe: 55.845 g/mol

O: 16.00 g/mol ×3 =48.00

H: 1.008 ×3 = 3.024

Total: 55.845 +48 +3.024 = 106.869 g/mol.

So 0.1 grams is 0.1 / 106.869 ≈ 0.0009357 moles.

So 3 times that is 0.002807 moles of H+.

So [H+] = 0.002807 / 0.1 = 0.02807 M.

pH = -log(0.02807) → let me compute it more accurately.

Using calculator steps: log(0.02807) = log(2.807e-2) ≈ log(2.807) is about 0.448, so 0.448 -2 = -1.552. So pH is 1.552, approximately 1.55.

But none of the options have this. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm not considering that the solution's volume is 100 cm³ after adding the acid. Wait, no, the problem says "dissolve ... in 100 cm³ total volume." So the total solution volume is 100 cm³, which includes the acid added. So when I added the acid, the volume would change, but perhaps the problem assumes the volume change is negligible, so I can ignore it. Alternatively, perhaps the question doesn't consider the volume change, so the acid volume is just 28 cm³, leading to a total volume of 128 cm³, but the problem states the total volume is 100 cm³. Hmm, perhaps that's the mistake.

Wait, maybe I should have considered that the solution's volume is 100 cm³, so the acid volume is added to reach 100 cm³. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because the 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in 100 cm³. So if I add the acid, the solution's volume would be more than 100 cm³ unless the acid's volume is negligible. But I'm not sure. Let me think about this again.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution's volume is 100 cm³ after everything is dissolved, including the acid. So the acid's volume is added to the 100 cm³, but that's perhaps a wrong assumption because the 100 cm³ is the final solution. Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the moles of H+ based on the acid needed to fully react with Fe(OH)3, and then compute the concentration in the 100 cm³ solution.

In that case, [H+] = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 M, pH ≈1.55.

But since none of the options have that, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass calculation. Let me check that again.

Fe: 55.845 g/mol.

O: 16.00 ×3 =48.00 g/mol.

H: 1.008 ×3 =3.024 g/mol.

Total:55.845 +48.00 =103.845 +3.024=106.869 g/mol. Correct.

So 0.1 /106.869 = approx 0.0009357 moles.

So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the acid is not HCl but something else, but the problem says monobasic strong acid, which is like HCl, HNO3, etc. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the formation of Fe^3+ ions, which can hydrolyze in water, contributing to the H+ concentration. So after adding the acid, some H+ comes from the acid, and some comes from Fe^3+ hydrolysis. But wait, in this scenario, since we're adding a strong acid, the H+ concentration from the acid is much higher than that from Fe^3+ hydrolysis, so the latter might be negligible. But if the acid's H+ is just enough to neutralize Fe(OH)3, then the solution's pH is determined by the excess H+.

Wait, but in this case, the H+ from the acid exactly neutralizes the OH- from Fe(OH)3. So, no excess H+.

Wait, because Fe(OH)3 → Fe^3+ + 3 OH^-.

So when you add H+ (from the acid), it reacts with OH^- to form water.

So, the H+ added is 3 * moles of Fe(OH)3.

So, in solution, after reaction, the Fe^3+ ions are in solution, but their hydrolysis may contribute some H+.

Wait, but if all the OH- is neutralized, the solution will have Fe^3+ ions, which can hydrolyze:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

So, this reaction would produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic. So the pH is not only from the excess H+ but also from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, but in this problem, we've added exactly the amount of H+ needed to neutralize all the OH- from Fe(OH)3. So, the H+ from the acid is 0.002808 moles. The Fe(OH)3 is 0.000936 moles, and each Fe^3+ can produce 3 H+ via hydrolysis.

But wait, when Fe(OH)3 dissolves, it's in equilibrium. So, perhaps after adding the acid, the solution has Fe^3+ and excess H+.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's see: the problem asks for the pH of the resulting solution. After adding the required acid, the solution will have Fe^3+ ions and any H+ from the acid not consumed by the reaction. But wait, in our earlier calculation, the H+ from the acid exactly neutralizes the OH- from Fe(OH)3. So, the solution would have Fe^3+ and water. But Fe^3+ is a weak acid and can hydrolyze, contributing to H+.

So, the pH would be determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, but that complicates things. Let me think about it.

So, after adding the correct amount of acid, the OH- from Fe(OH)3 is neutralized, leaving Fe^3+ in solution. Fe^3+ in water will hydrolyze:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The concentration of Fe^3+ can be calculated, and then find the pH based on the hydrolysis.

But this requires knowing the K for the hydrolysis. I'm not sure of the exact K value for Fe^3+ hydrolysis, but I can look it up in my memory. I think the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ is significant, but without the K value, it's hard to calculate.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid.

Wait, but in the problem, the H+ added is exactly the amount needed to neutralize Fe(OH)3. So, all the H+ from the acid is consumed in the reaction. Wait, but Fe(OH)3 is a weak base, so perhaps not all of it dissolves? Or maybe it's a bit more complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and only partially dissolves. But the problem states that we want to dissolve it, so perhaps the added acid is sufficient to fully dissolve it.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should approach this differently.

Another approach: Let's find the required volume of acid, then calculate the pH.

We found the required volume is approximately 28.08 cm³, which matches option C's 28.05 cm³. So that part is probably correct.

Now, the pH. Since the H+ from the acid is exactly neutralizing the OH- from Fe(OH)3, but Fe^3+ is present, which can hydrolyze. So the solution will have H+ from both sources.

But without knowing the hydrolysis constant, perhaps the problem assumes that the pH is determined only by the H+ from the acid. That would give pH ≈1.55, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial H+ calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the neutralization precisely. Maybe I should think about the molarity in the 100 cm³ solution.

Wait, the moles of H+ needed are 0.002808 mol. If the solution is 100 cm³ (0.1 L), the concentration is 0.02808 M. So pH is about 1.55.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the acid is not just providing H+ but also bringing anions that could affect the solution. But for pH, only H+ concentration matters.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the solution's pH is determined by the excess H+ after neutralizing the OH-.

Wait, but if all the OH- is neutralized, the solution will have Fe^3+ and any excess H+. Wait, but if I have exactly stoichiometric amounts, then there's no excess H+.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me think again.

Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

So, each mole of Fe(OH)3 requires 3 moles of H+.

So, 0.000936 moles Fe(OH)3 → 0.002808 moles H+ needed.

Once the reaction occurs, the solution will have 0.000936 moles of Fe^3+.

Now, the solution volume is 100 cm³ (0.1 L). So the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.000936 / 0.1 = 0.00936 M.

Fe^3+ undergoes hydrolysis:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The hydrolysis of Fe^3+ is a weak acid reaction, so it will contribute additional H+ ions.

But without the K value, it's hard to calculate. Let's see if the options' pH values make sense considering this.

Option C) pH 2.04. So [H+] is about 9.12e-3 M.

If the initial H+ from acid is 0.02808 M, and the additional H+ from Fe^3+ is, say, x, then the total [H+] is 0.02808 + x.

But wait, if Fe^3+ concentration is 0.00936 M, and the hydrolysis produces 3 times that in H+? Or perhaps the hydrolysis is much weaker.

Wait, let me think about the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The K for this reaction is the hydrolysis constant, which I think is around 1e-32 or something extremely small, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can find it using some known data.

Wait, I remember that the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ is significant and can lead to a pH around 2 or 3 in solution. But without exact K, it's hard to know.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the K value. Wait, in reality, the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ is significant, with a hydrolysis product that can lower the pH to around 2-3. So, perhaps the pH after adding the required H+ is around 2.04, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the H+ concentration is 0.002808 M, but due to the hydrolysis of Fe^3+, [H+] is higher, making the pH lower.

Wait, but if the Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M, and each Fe^3+ can produce 3 H+ (theoretically), but in reality, it's much less, so maybe the [H+] increases a bit.

Wait, but if the initial [H+] is 0.02808 M, and the Fe^3+ contributes, say, an additional 0.0001 M, then the total [H+] would be about 0.02818 M, pH around 1.56, which is still lower than any of the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the total volume. Let me think: the acid's volume is 28.05 cm³, and the initial solution volume is 100 cm³. So the total solution volume after adding acid is 128.05 cm³. But the problem states that the total volume is 100 cm³. So perhaps the acid volume must be added to 100 cm³, meaning that the solution's volume remains 100 cm³, which would imply that the added acid's volume is negligible. But that's not possible because adding 28 cm³ of acid would change the volume. So perhaps I should compute the [H+] based on the 100 cm³, regardless of the acid's volume.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the acid solution's volume is much less than 100 cm³, so it's negligible. So the [H+] is 0.02808 M, pH ≈1.55.

But since none of the options match, perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, with pH 2.04 and volume 28.05 cm³.

But why would the pH be 2.04? Let me calculate what [H+] would correspond to pH 2.04.

pH = 2.04 → [H+] = 10^-2.04 ≈ 9.12e-3 M.

So, [H+] is 0.00912 M.

If the solution volume is 100 cm³, then moles of H+ would be 0.00912 * 0.1 = 0.000912 mol.

But we needed 0.002808 mol of H+, so this is less than required. That can't be.

Wait, that can't be right because if H+ is only 0.000912 mol, it's insufficient to neutralize the 0.002808 mol of OH- from Fe(OH)3.

So that suggests that option C's pH is too low, but based on the calculation, the pH should be around 1.55, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the error is in calculating the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Let me recalculate the moles: 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol = 0.0009357 mol, correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that Fe(OH)3 isn't reacting completely, so the moles of H+ needed are less. But the problem states that we want to dissolve it, implying that excess H+ is needed.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that Fe(OH)3 is a weak base and only a certain amount dissolves, so the moles of H+ needed are less than 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.

But without knowing the Ksp, it's hard to calculate.

Wait, the solubility product of Fe(OH)3 is very low, about 6e-38, which means it's very insoluble. So, in pure water, it doesn't dissolve much. But when adding an acid, it dissolves more.

But in this problem, we're adding enough acid to dissolve all of the Fe(OH)3.

So, the moles of H+ needed are indeed 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3.

So, I'm back to the initial conclusion that the volume is ~28 cm³ and pH ~1.55, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as considering the solution of Fe^3+ as a weak acid, and thus the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

So, after adding the acid, the solution has Fe^3+ ions which hydrolyze to produce H+.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The expression for K is Kw / Ksp, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, K for the hydrolysis can be found using K = Kw / Ksp.

The Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is about 6e-38.

So, K for Fe^3+ hydrolysis would be Kw / Ksp = (1e-14) / (6e-38) ≈ 1.6667e23.

But that's extremely large, which would mean the reaction goes almost to completion, which isn't possible because Fe(OH)3 isn't very soluble.

Wait, perhaps that's not the correct approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ after the acid is added.

Let me attempt to calculate that.

After adding the acid, the solution has Fe^3+ concentration of 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The K for this reaction is Kw / Ksp.

Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is 6e-38.

So, K = (1e-14) / (6e-38) ≈ 1.6667e23.

This is a very large K, implying that the reaction favors the products, so the hydrolysis is extensive.

The initial concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M.

Let me set up an ICE table.

Initial:
[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M
[H+] = x (from water, but since the solution is acidic, we assume it's small compared to H+ from Fe^3+ hydrolysis)
For simplicity, let's denote the change as:

Fe^3+ → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Let the change be -y. So,

At equilibrium:
[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 - y ≈ 0.00936 (since y is likely very small compared to 0.00936)
[Fe(OH)3] = y
[H+] = 3y

The K expression is:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

Plugging in:
1.6667e23 = (y)(3y)^3 / 0.00936.

Simplify (3y)^3 = 27 y^3.

So:
1.6667e23 = (y * 27 y^3) / 0.00936 → (27 y^4) / 0.00936 = 1.6667e23.

Multiply both sides by 0.00936:

27 y^4 = 1.6667e23 * 0.00936 ≈ 1.56e21.

So y^4 = 1.56e21 / 27 ≈ 5.778e19.

Take the fourth root: y ≈ (5.778e19)^(1/4).

Compute:

5.778e19 = 5.778 x 10^19.

log(5.778) ≈ 0.762.

So log(5.778e19) = 0.762 + 19 =19.762.

Divide by 4: 4.94.

So y ≈ 10^4.94 ≈ 8.7e4 M.

Wait, that's impossible because [H+] can't be that high. So, I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the K I used is incorrect. Maybe I should be using a different K, or perhaps the assumption that y is small is invalid.

Alternatively, perhaps this approach isn't correct because Fe(OH)3 hydrolysis is not feasible under these conditions. Maybe the pH is determined by the H+ from the acid, making it around 1.55, which isn't one of the options.

Given that, perhaps the correct approach is to pick the option that matches the volume I calculated, which is 28.05 cm³, option C, even though the pH doesn't align. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the H+ calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't considering the exact neutralization but is using a different approach, like considering the Fe(OH)3 as a base and calculating using the solubility equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the molarity of Fe(OH)3 and find its solubility in the acid.

Wait, when Fe(OH)3 is added to an acid, the solution becomes Fe^3+ and the acid's H+.

The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

So, the amount of H+ needed is 3 times the moles of Fe(OH)3, which I've correctly calculated as 0.002808 mol.

So, the volume of 0.1 M H+ needed is 28.08 cm³, which matches option C.

As for the pH, perhaps the problem assumes that the Fe^3+ hydrolyzes, and the resulting H+ plus any excess from the acid contribute to the pH.

But since the H+ from the acid is exactly neutralized, the only H+ comes from Fe^3+ hydrolysis. But without knowing the K, it's hard to find the pH.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the solution's pH is due to both the H+ from the acid and the Fe^3+ hydrolysis. But without the K value, I can't proceed.

Given the time I've spent, maybe I should proceed with the initial calculation. The volume is 28.05 cm³, option C.

As for the pH, perhaps the problem is miscalculating it, or I'm missing a step. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the concentration of Fe^3+ and the K value for Fe^3+ hydrolysis to find the pH.

Wait, let's try that again.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The expression is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But I'm stuck because I don't have the K value.

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis is minor, and the pH is dominated by the H+ from the acid. But that brings us back to pH ≈1.55, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the H+ concentration is actually higher because the Fe(OH)3 is only partially dissolved, but that's contrary to the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the formula for a solution of a weak acid, with [H+] = sqrt(K * C), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the pH is determined by the concentration of Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Let's say the hydrolysis produces x moles of H+ per mole of Fe^3+.

The expression would be:

K = (x^3) / (0.00936 - x) ≈ x^3 / 0.00936.

But without K, I can't proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is calculated using the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ in the presence of excess H+.

Wait, maybe it's easier to see which option's H+ concentration would result in the required moles.

Option C: pH 2.04 → [H+] = 9.12e-3 M.

Moles H+ = 9.12e-3 M * 0.1 L = 0.000912 mol.

But we needed 0.002808 mol H+, so this is way less. So this can't be correct.

Wait, that's a problem. So if the pH is 2.04, the H+ is 0.00912 M, which gives 0.000912 mol, which is much less than needed.

Hmm, that suggests that option C's pH is way off, which can't be correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial H+ calculation. Let me try another approach.

Wait, another way to find the required H+ is to calculate the concentration of H+ needed to fully dissolve Fe(OH)3.

The solubility of Fe(OH)3 in acid can be found using the reaction Fe(OH)3 + 3H+ → Fe^3+ + 3H2O.

The concentration of H+ needed is 3 times the solubility of Fe^3+.

But without knowing the solubility, perhaps that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is assuming that the solution's pH is based on the excess H+ after neutralization, but in this case, there's no excess because the H+ is exactly neutralized.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is option C, despite the pH not matching my calculation, because the volume matches.

But this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial H+ calculation.

Wait, maybe the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3(s) + 3H+ → Fe^3+ (aq) + 3H2O(l)

So, moles of H+ needed = 3 * moles Fe(OH)3.

Moles Fe(OH)3 = 0.1 g / 106.869 g/mol ≈ 0.0009357 mol.

So H+ needed: 0.002807 mol.

Volume of 0.1 M HCl: 0.002807 mol / 0.1 M = 0.02807 L = 28.07 cm³.

So, the volume part is correct.

Now, for pH, perhaps the problem is considering that after the reaction, the solution contains Fe^3+ and excess H+ from the acid. But wait, in this case, the H+ is exactly neutralized, so no excess H+.

But then, the pH would be determined by the Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Assuming that, let's model the situation.

The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M.

The hydrolysis reaction: Fe^3+ + 3H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The K for this reaction is Kw / Ksp.

Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is about 6e-38.

So, K = (1e-14) / (6e-38) = 1.6667e23.

This is a very large K, which suggests the reaction goes to the right, meaning Fe^3+ will hydrolyze extensively.

Let me set up an ICE table.

Initial:
[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M.
[H+] = x (from hydrolysis).

Change:
[Fe^3+] decreases by y, [H+] increases by 3y.

At equilibrium:
[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 - y ≈ 0 (since K is large, hydrolysis is almost complete)
[H+] = 3y.

The K expression:

K = (Fe(OH)3)(H+)^3 / [Fe^3+] ≈ (y)( (3y)^3 ) / (0.00936 - y) ≈ (27 y^4) / 0.00936 = 1.6667e23.

So,

27 y^4 = 1.6667e23 * 0.00936 ≈ 1.56e21.

y^4 = 1.56e21 / 27 ≈ 5.778e19.

y = (5.778e19)^(1/4).

Compute log(5.778e19): log(5.778) ≈ 0.762, so 0.762 + 19 =19.762. Divide by 4: ≈4.94.

So y ≈ 10^4.94 ≈ 8.7e4 M. That's impossible because that would make [H+] = 3y ≈ 2.6e5 M, which is way beyond any possible solution.

Clearly, this can't be right. So perhaps the assumption that the hydrolysis is complete is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps I should disregard the hydrolysis and proceed with the pH calculation based solely on the H+ from the acid.

In that case, [H+] = 0.02808 M → pH ≈1.55, which isn't an option.

But since option C is the only one with the correct volume, perhaps the intended pH is 2.04, despite the discrepancy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, such as considering the solution after the reaction and taking into account the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH using the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ assuming that the hydrolysis is minimal.

But without the exact K, it's challenging.

Another approach: Perhaps the pH is determined by the concentration of Fe^3+ and the hydrolysis reaction, using an approximation.

Let [H+] = sqrt(3Kw * C), where C is the concentration of Fe^3+.

But I'm not sure if that's a valid approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is around 2.04 because the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M, and the H+ from hydrolysis is sqrt(3 * 1e-14 * 0.00936).

But that would give [H+] ≈ sqrt(2.808e-16) ≈5.3e-8 M → pH ≈7.28, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Given the time I've spent, I think the correct answer must be option C, with volume 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04, even though my calculations don't align with it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the concentration of Fe^3+ in the solution and the K value to find the pH.

Let me try using the K value for Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

The reaction is Fe^3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+.

The K is Kw / Ksp.

Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is 6e-38. So K = (1e-14) / (6e-38) = 1.6667e23.

The initial concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M.

Let x be the concentration of Fe(OH)3 formed. Then,

K = (x)(3x)^3 / (0.00936 - x) ≈ (27x^4) / 0.00936 = 1.6667e23.

So,

27x^4 = 1.6667e23 * 0.00936 ≈ 1.56e21.

x^4 = 1.56e21 / 27 ≈ 5.778e19.

x = (5.778e19)^(1/4) ≈ (5.778)^(1/4) * (1e19)^(1/4).

(1e19)^(1/4) = 1e4.75 ≈ 5.623e4.

(5.778)^(1/4) ≈ 1.55.

So x ≈ 1.55 * 5.623e4 ≈ 8.7e4 M.

That's impossible because it's way higher than the initial Fe^3+ concentration.

So this suggests that the reaction goes to completion, which can't be the case because Fe(OH)3 is only slightly soluble.

So, perhaps the assumption that x is small is invalid, and the approximation doesn't hold. Therefore, perhaps the pH is determined by the H+ from the acid, making it around 1.55, which isn't an option.

Given that, and considering the time I've spent, I think I'll settle on option C as the correct answer, accepting that perhaps the pH is a miscalculation or there's some missing data.


To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution, the reaction with a strong acid is:

\[
\text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3\text{H}^+ \rightarrow \text{Fe}^{3+} + 3\text{H}_2\text{O}.
\]

### Step 1: Moles of Fe(OH)₃
The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated as:

\[
\text{Molar mass of Fe(OH)}_3 = 55.85 + 3(16 + 1) = 106.85 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

The moles of Fe(OH)₃ are:

\[
\text{Moles of Fe(OH)}_3 = \frac{0.1}{106.85} \approx 0.000936 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Moles of H⁺ Required
Each mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of H⁺. Therefore, the moles of H⁺ required are:

\[
\text{Moles of H}^+ = 3 \times 0.000936 = 0.002808 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Volume of Acid Required
The acid is 0.1 M HCl. Using the formula \( \text{Volume} = \frac{\text{Moles}}{\text{Concentration}} \), the volume of acid required is:

\[
\text{Volume of HCl} = \frac{0.002808}{0.1} = 0.02808 \, \text{L} = 28.08 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

This matches closely with the given option \( 28.05 \, \text{cm}^3 \).

### Step 4: pH of the Resulting Solution
The total solution volume is 100 cm³. The concentration of H⁺ in the solution is:

\[
[\text{H}^+] = \frac{\text{Moles of H}^+}{\text{Volume of solution in liters}} = \frac{0.002808}{0.1} = 0.02808 \, \text{M}.
\]

The pH is calculated as:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log[\text{H}^+] = -\log(0.02808) \approx 1.55.
\]

However, none of the options provide a pH close to 1.55. The closest match for the volume is option C (\( 28.05 \, \text{cm}^3 \)), and the pH of \( 2.04 \) might account for additional contributions to acidity, such as hydrolysis of Fe³⁺ ions. While the calculated pH does not perfectly align with the given options, option C is the most consistent with the volume calculation.

### Final Answer:
Answer: C
