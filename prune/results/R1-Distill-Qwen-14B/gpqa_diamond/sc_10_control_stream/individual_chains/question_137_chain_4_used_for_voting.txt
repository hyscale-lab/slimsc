Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to work through it. The question is asking how many revolutions a proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. Let's see what I remember about cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons.

I know that cyclotrons are particle accelerators that use a magnetic field and an electric field to accelerate charged particles. The key point is that the magnetic field keeps the particles moving in a circular path, and the electric field accelerates them each time they pass through the gap between the dees (those D-shaped electrodes).

Wait, but this is a synchrocyclotron. Oh right, synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron where the magnetic field isn't constant. Instead, it increases with time. That probably affects how the particles are accelerated because as the magnetic field increases, the cyclotron frequency changes. But I'm not entirely sure how that plays into the calculations here.

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T ≈ 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? Or two acceleration cycles? Hmm, maybe that's a typo, but I'll proceed as given. The voltage applied is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α) t + Φ0]. The data given is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV.

Wait, the question is about the number of revolutions. So I need to figure out how many times the proton circles around the synchrocyclotron as it's being accelerated.

I remember that in cyclotrons, each time a particle passes through the electric field, it gets a little kick of energy. The number of revolutions relates to how many times it goes around the circle while being accelerated.

But since this is a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage isn't fixed. Because the magnetic field is changing, the cyclotron frequency ν is also changing. Oh wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases linearly with time, right? Or is there a different relation?

Wait, maybe I should think about the basic equations. The force on the proton is provided by the magnetic field. The equation governing the motion in a synchrocyclotron is a bit different from a regular cyclotron because the field isn't constant.

In a regular cyclotron, the frequency is fixed, so the time for each revolution is fixed. But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases, so the cyclotron frequency ν = (qB)/(2πm) also changes. So the frequency of the applied voltage must be adjusted to match the changing frequency of the particle's motion.

The voltage is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2π ν(α) t + Φ0]. So the angular frequency of the voltage is 2π ν(α), where ν(α) is a function that changes over time. Hmm, but I might need to find how ν relates to the magnetic field B, which in turn affects the motion of the proton.

Wait, the key here is to find the time it takes for the proton to reach 950 MeV, and then see how many times it revolves during that time.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions can be found by relating the total energy gained to the energy per revolution, and then integrating over time. But I'm not entirely sure how that would work.

Let me think about the energy. The kinetic energy gained by the proton is due to the work done by the electric field. Each time the proton passes through the electric field, it gains some energy. The voltage U is the potential difference across the gap, and the energy gained per passage is e U, where e is the proton charge. But wait, the voltage is alternating, so it's not straightforward. Actually, the proton is accelerated when the voltage is in the correct phase. So each time the voltage is at its peak, the proton gets a kick.

Wait, but since the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos( ... ), the maximum energy transfer per passage is e U0. But because the frequency of the voltage is matched to the particle's frequency, each time the particle enters the gap, the electric field is at its maximum, so it gets the maximum possible energy boost each time.

So each revolution the proton makes, it gains approximately e U0 of energy. Wait, but is that accurate? Let me check.

In a cyclotron, the time for each revolution is T = (2π m)/(q B). The electric field alternates at a frequency ν, which should be the same as the cyclotron frequency. So each half-cycle (since the electric field changes direction), the proton is accelerated once. So each full cycle (two half-cycles) would give the proton a boost of e U0, perhaps.

Wait, no, actually, each time the proton passes through the gap, it's accelerated once. So each revolution corresponds to one acceleration, and the energy gained per revolution is e U0.

Wait, but the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos( ... ), so the maximum voltage is U0. The energy per passage is e U0, assuming that the proton is accelerated each time the voltage is at its peak. So each time it goes through the gap, it gains e U0.

But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is increasing, which means the cyclotron frequency ν is increasing as well. So the frequency of the applied voltage must be adjusted to match the changing ν of the particle.

But how does that affect the number of revolutions? Hmm.

Let me outline the approach:

1. The proton starts from rest (T ≈ 0), so initial energy is negligible.
2. The proton is accelerated by the voltage in the synchrocyclotron. Each time it goes through the gap, it gains energy e U0.
3. The number of revolutions N is the number of times it circles the synchrocyclotron, which corresponds to how many times it's accelerated.
4. The total energy gained is e U0 * N, so N = (Total energy) / (e U0).

Wait, but wait. The total kinetic energy is 950 MeV. So if each revolution gives e U0 of energy, then N = 950 MeV / (e U0).

But we have to make sure about the units.

Let me get the values:

e (proton charge) is 1.602e-19 coulombs.

U0 is 190 kV, which is 190,000 volts.

So each revolution gives energy e * U0 = (1.602e-19 C) * (190e3 V) = 1.602e-19 * 190e3 = approximately 3.0438e-14 J.

Wait, but energy in eV is e * V, so 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So e U0 in eV is (1 eV) * U0 in volts? Wait, no. Because 1 eV = e * 1 volt. So e * U0 (in volts) gives e * U0 (in eV) as just U0 eV.

Wait, that's correct. So e * U0 is 190,000 eV, which is 190 keV. So each revolution gives 190 keV of energy.

The total energy is 950 MeV. So N = 950 MeV / 190 keV.

Wait, let me convert units: 950 MeV is 950,000 keV.

So N = 950,000 keV / 190 keV per revolution = 950,000 / 190 = let me calculate that.

950,000 divided by 190.

Hmm, 190 * 5000 = 950,000, right?

Because 190 * 5 = 950, so 190 * 5000 = 950,000.

So N would be 5000 revolutions.

Wait, but the options are A) 1864, B)5300, C)3536, D)2500.

Wait, 5000 isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption that each revolution gives 190 keV is incorrect.

Wait, maybe in a synchrocyclotron, the energy per revolution isn't fixed because the magnetic field is increasing, so the radius is increasing as the proton gains energy. But the energy per revolution might not be constant. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't considering the energy per revolution but the time taken.

Wait, another approach: the kinetic energy of the proton is given by T = (γ - 1) m c^2. For non-relativistic speeds, T ≈ (1/2) m v^2, but when the energy is around 950 MeV, that's way beyond non-relativistic. So the particle is ultra-relativistic.

Wait, the rest mass energy of a proton is about 938 MeV. So 950 MeV is just slightly above that, so maybe the velocity is near the speed of light.

Wait, but the initial kinetic energy is zero, so the initial velocity is zero. As it's accelerated, it gains energy.

In a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases with time. The reason for that is to keep the particle's orbit synchronized with the accelerating electric field. Because as the particle gains energy, its velocity increases, and if the magnetic field remains constant, the time for each revolution (and thus the cyclotron frequency) would change. Hence, the magnetic field is adjusted to keep the cyclotron frequency matching the frequency of the accelerating voltage.

But how does this affect the number of revolutions?

Wait, perhaps the time it takes to reach the desired energy is important. Let's think about the rate of energy gain.

The power (energy per unit time) gained by the proton is related to the electric field. But since the voltage is at a fixed amplitude, the average power might be constant, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since the proton is moving relativistically, its energy increases and the time dilation might come into play, but perhaps that's complicating things beyond the scope of this problem.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is more straightforward. Let me think again.

The energy per revolution isn't fixed because the magnetic field is changing, so the radius of the proton's orbit is increasing. Because the magnetic field B is increasing, the radius r = (γ m v )/(q B) increases as B increases. Wait, but how does this affect the energy per revolution?

Wait, the energy gained per revolution in a synchrocyclotron is actually different from a cyclotron because the magnetic field is varying.

Wait, maybe each revolution doesn't give the same energy boost. So my initial approach, assuming a fixed energy per revolution, isn't correct.

Hmm, perhaps I need to find the time taken to reach the desired energy and then find how many revolutions occur in that time.

Wait, how do I find the time? The problem is a bit tricky because the acceleration and the magnetic field are time-dependent.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the kinetic energy in a synchrocyclotron.

I remember that the kinetic energy T of a proton in a synchrocyclotron can be expressed as T = (e U0) * (t) / (2π), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the energy gain per cycle is e U0, and the number of cycles (revolutions) N is T/(e U0). But in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency ν depends on time because B is changing.

Wait, the frequency of the applied voltage must match the cyclotron frequency of the proton at each moment. So the angular frequency of the voltage is 2π ν(t), where ν(t) = (q B(t))/(2π m). So the voltage's frequency is the same as the proton's cyclotron frequency.

But since B is increasing, the frequency ν(t) is also increasing.

But how does this relate to the number of revolutions?

Alternatively, maybe we can model the acceleration as linear in time, since in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field B is usually increased linearly with time to keep the cyclotron frequency matched with the driving frequency.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Maybe the relation between the magnetic field and time is B(t) = B0 + kt, where k is some constant. If that's the case, then the cyclotron frequency ν(t) = (e B(t))/(2π m). So ν(t) is proportional to B(t).

But perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Wait, maybe I can use the formula for the number of revolutions in a synchrocyclotron. I think I remember that the number of revolutions N is given by N = (sqrt(T^2 + (e U0)^2) - e U0 )/(e U0) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for a simpler way.

Let me think about the energy. The total energy is 950 MeV, and the maximum energy per revolution is 190 keV. So 950 MeV is 950,000 keV. Dividing that by 190 keV per revolution gives approximately 5000 revolutions. But 5000 isn't an option. The closest option is B)5300, but that's higher. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy per revolution isn't exactly 190 keV. Maybe each revolution gives less energy because of the increasing magnetic field. So the energy per revolution decreases as the proton's energy increases.

Wait, that makes sense. Because as the magnetic field increases, the radius of the proton's orbit increases, and perhaps the time it spends in the electric field increases or decreases, which affects the energy gain per revolution.

Hmm, if each revolution gives less energy than the previous, then the number of revolutions would be more than 5000. But the options don't have 5000. The highest option is B)5300.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect because in a synchrocyclotron, the number of revolutions isn't simply the total energy divided by energy per revolution.

Alternatively, I might need to consider the relationship between the magnetic field, the accelerating voltage, and the number of revolutions.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the number of revolutions in a synchrocyclotron is N = (T * m) / (e * U0 * (something)). But I'm not remembering the exact formula.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the equation governing the motion of the proton in a synchrocyclotron. The equation of motion is derived from the Lorentz force. The radial equation for the motion is:

m (r'' ) = (e v / B) (something). Hmm, not exactly recalling.

Alternatively, the equation is m γ r d^2 θ/dt^2 = e E, where E is the electric field, γ is the Lorentz factor. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to find the time of acceleration and then compute the number of revolutions based on the frequency during that time.

Wait, but without knowing how B(t) changes, it's difficult to find the time.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy gained. The kinetic energy T of the proton is given by the integral of the power over time. The power is P = e * U(t) * f(t), where f(t) is the frequency at which the proton passes through the gap.

Wait, but this might be getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions can be found using the relation N = (T)/(e U0) * (something), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: in a regular cyclotron, the number of revolutions N can be found from N = (T)/(e U0) * (something related to the cyclotron frequency). But in a synchrocyclotron, since the frequency is changing, this complicates things.

Alternatively, since the problem gives the voltage as U(t) = U0 cos[2π ν(α) t + Φ0], maybe ν(α) is a function that changes with the phase α, which is related to the number of revolutions.

Wait, perhaps α is the phase, which would be 2π N, where N is the number of revolutions. So then, 2π ν(t) t + Φ0 = α.

But I'm not sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclotron frequency ν(t) is equal to the frequency of the voltage, so 2π ν(t) = 2π ν(α) => ν(t) = ν(α). So α would be related to the phase shift, which could be linked to the time.

But I'm getting stuck here.

Let me try a different approach. Let's calculate the energy per revolution in a synchrocyclotron.

In a regular cyclotron, the energy per revolution is e U0, because the voltage is applied once per revolution, and the proton gains e U0 each time. So the number of revolutions N = T/(e U0).

But in a synchrocyclotron, because B is increasing, the time per revolution is changing. So each revolution takes longer as the proton gains energy. And because the voltage is applied at a frequency that matches the cyclotron frequency, which is changing, the number of revolutions doesn't increase as simply as in a regular cyclotron.

Wait, perhaps the number of revolutions is actually higher because each revolution takes longer. So the same total time would allow for more revolutions than in a regular cyclotron.

Wait, but in this problem, the total energy is fixed. So perhaps the number of revolutions is similar to the regular cyclotron case, but adjusted for the varying B.

Alternatively, perhaps in a synchrocyclotron, the number of revolutions N is given by N = (T)/(e U0) * (some factor based on the magnetic field profile).

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find the time it takes to reach 950 MeV, and then use the time to find the number of revolutions.

How?

The energy gained is e U0 multiplied by the number of times the voltage is applied in phase. Since the frequency is changing, the number of applications might be a bit tricky, but perhaps the energy can be considered as T ≈ e U0 N, so N ≈ T/(e U0) = 950 MeV / 190 keV = 5000 as before. But since this isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the options are A)1864, B)5300, C)3536, D)2500.

Wait, perhaps the actual energy per revolution isn't 190 keV, but less because the time per revolution is increasing. Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to consider the relativistic relation between energy and velocity.

Wait, but the initial assumption might be that the energy per revolution is e U0, but perhaps the correct formula for T is T = N e U0, where N is the number of revolutions. Then, N = T/(e U0) = 950e6 eV / (190e3 eV) ) = 950e6 / 190e3 = 950000 / 190000 = 5.

Wait, no, that can't be right. 950e6 eV is 950,000,000 eV, and 190e3 is 190,000 eV. So 950,000,000 / 190,000 is approximately 5000.

Wait, but the options don't have 5000, but option B is 5300. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 950,000,000 eV divided by 190,000 eV per revolution:

950,000,000 / 190,000 = 9500000 / 19000 = 500000 / 1900 ≈ 263.16 revolutions. No, that's not right.

Wait, wait, no, 950,000,000 eV is 950 MeV, and 190,000 eV is 0.19 MeV. So 950 MeV / 0.19 MeV per revolution = 950 / 0.19 = approximately 5000.

Yes, that's 5000 revolutions. But the options don't have 5000. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the number of revolutions isn't N = T/(e U0), but something else.

Another thought: in a synchrocyclotron, the number of revolutions is linked to the time taken to reach the desired energy.

Each revolution gives a certain amount of energy, but because the magnetic field is increasing, the acceleration voltage's frequency must change. So perhaps the time per revolution isn't constant, which complicates the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is found using the equation derived from the motion in a synchrocyclotron.

I think the formula for the number of revolutions N in a synchrocyclotron is given by N = ( (sqrt( (e U0)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) ) - m c^2 ) / (e U0) )

Wait, but that looks like the formula for the number of revolutions in a cyclotron when considering relativistic effects. Let me verify.

In a cyclotron, the maximum energy is achieved when N e U0 = (gamma -1) m c^2. So N = ( (gamma -1) m c^2 ) / (e U0). But in the relativistic case, gamma is sqrt(1 + (p c)^2/(m^2 c^4)), but perhaps that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is N = ( (e U0) ) / (2 pi m c^2) ) * sqrt( (T + m c^2)/(T) ) ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the kinetic energy T = (gamma -1) m c^2. The momentum p = gamma m v. But in a synchrocyclotron, the radius r is given by r = (p c)/(e B), where B is the magnetic field.

Since the magnetic field is increasing, B(t) = B0 + kt, perhaps, but I'm not sure. Maybe if B increases linearly, then r increases as well.

But how does this tie into the number of revolutions?

Hmm, perhaps I should use the relation between the number of revolutions and the integral over time.

Wait, the number of revolutions N is the integral over time of the cyclotron frequency ν(t). Since each revolution corresponds to a frequency of 1 revolution per second, the total number is the integral of ν(t) dt from 0 to t_total.

So N = ∫ ν(t) dt.

But what is ν(t) in a synchrocyclotron?

In a synchrocyclotron, the cyclotron frequency is ν(t) = (e B(t))/(2 pi m). And the applied voltage has a frequency that matches this ν(t). So the number of revolutions is the integral of ν(t) dt from 0 to t_total.

But to find t_total, I need to find the time it takes for the proton to reach 950 MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the energy in terms of the integral of ν(t) dt.

Wait, the kinetic energy T is (gamma -1) m c^2. The work done by the electric field is e U0 multiplied by the number of times the field is applied in phase, which is N. But since the voltage is applied at varying frequency, the number N isn't simply T/(e U0).

I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should look for a formula that relates the number of revolutions in a synchrocyclotron to the energy and voltage.

Wait, I found a resource that says the number of revolutions N in a synchrocyclotron is given by:

N = (T) / (e U0) * (something)

But I'm not finding the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is N = (gamma) * (e U0) / (m c^2), but I'm uncertain.

Wait, perhaps it's time to make an educated guess. Earlier, I thought N was 5000, but the options don't have that. The closest option is B)5300. So perhaps the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion. Let me recheck.

e U0 is 190,000 eV, which is 190 keV. The proton's energy is 950 MeV, which is 950,000 keV.

So dividing 950,000 keV by 190 keV gives 5000. So N=5000.

But the options don't have 5000. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of half-revolutions or something else.

Wait, perhaps each revolution corresponds to two applications of the voltage. Because in a cyclotron, the electric field alternates direction every half-cycle, so the proton is accelerated once per full cycle. So each revolution may correspond to one acceleration. But if the voltage is applied twice per revolution, then N would be half of 5000, which is 2500. Hmm, option D is 2500.

But that would imply that each revolution corresponds to two applications, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps each time the proton passes through the gap, it gets a little energy, so each passage (every half-revolution?) gives some energy. So perhaps the number of passages is 5000, which would correspond to 2500 revolutions.

But I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to model the problem as follows:

In a regular cyclotron, the number of revolutions is N = T/(e U0). But in a synchrocyclotron, because the magnetic field is increasing, the frequency ν(t) increases, so the number of revolutions is higher. Therefore, the correct number of revolutions is more than 5000. The only option higher than 5000 is B)5300.

So perhaps the answer is B)5300.

But why would it be higher than 5000? Because in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases, allowing more revolutions as the proton gains energy, perhaps? Or maybe because the time per revolution increases, leading to more revolutions over the same time period. Wait, no, higher magnetic field would make the cyclotron frequency higher, leading to more revolutions per second, but perhaps the total time taken to reach the desired energy is less, leading to more revolutions.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused.

Another approach: perhaps the formula for the number of revolutions is N = (gamma) / (something). Alternatively, perhaps considering the relation between the energy and the magnetic field.

But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the following relation:

In a synchrocyclotron, the kinetic energy T is given by T = e U0 N, where N is the number of revolutions. Thus, N = T/(e U0) = (950e6 eV)/(190e3 eV) ) = 5000 revolutions.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Maybe because the magnetic field is changing, the effective energy per revolution is less than 190 keV, so the actual number of revolutions is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that each revolution gives 190 keV is incorrect because as the magnetic field increases, the time spent in the gap increases, leading to more energy per revolution.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I'm really stuck here.

Given the options and my initial calculation leading to 5000, which isn't present, perhaps the intended answer is 5000. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the voltage is applied twice per revolution. So each revolution gives two energy boosts. Then, the number of revolutions would be 5000 / 2 = 2500. Which is option D.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is C)3536. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. Two accelerations? So perhaps, each revolution gives two accelerations. So the number of accelerations is 2N. So the total energy would be 2N * e U0.

So N = T/(2 e U0) ) = 950e6 eV / (2 * 190e3 eV) ) = 950e6 / 380e3 = 2500. So 2500 revolutions.

Which would correspond to option D.

Ah! That makes sense. Because if each revolution includes two acceleration events (since the voltage alternates), then the number of accelerations is 2N, where N is the number of revolutions. So the total energy is 2N * e U0.

So N = T/(2 e U0) = 950e6 / (2 * 190e3) = 950e6/(380e3) = 950000 / 380000 ≈ 2.5. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, 950e6 eV is 950,000,000 eV.

Divide by 2 * 190e3 eV = 380,000 eV.

So 950,000,000 / 380,000 = approximately 2500.

So N = 2500.

Which is option D.

So the correct answer should be D)2500.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the energy gain and the relationship between the applied voltage and the proton's motion. The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy and is accelerated to a kinetic energy of \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} \). The voltage applied is \( U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi \nu(\alpha) t + \Phi_0] \), where \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \) and \( \Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Gain per Revolution**:  
   In a synchrocyclotron, the proton gains energy as it passes through the electric field. Each revolution corresponds to one acceleration event, and the energy gained per revolution is approximately \( e U_0 \), where \( e \) is the proton charge and \( U_0 \) is the amplitude of the applied voltage. For this problem, \( e U_0 = 190 \, \text{keV} \).

2. **Total Energy and Number of Revolutions**:  
   The total kinetic energy of the proton is \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} = 950,000 \, \text{keV} \). The number of revolutions \( N \) is given by the total energy divided by the energy gained per revolution:
   \[
   N = \frac{T_1}{e U_0} = \frac{950,000 \, \text{keV}}{190 \, \text{keV}} = 5000.
   \]

3. **Adjustment for Alternating Voltage**:  
   The problem specifies that the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach the final energy. This implies that each revolution includes two acceleration events. Therefore, the total number of revolutions is halved:
   \[
   N = \frac{5000}{2} = 2500.
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:  
   Among the given options, the closest match to the calculated number of revolutions is \( 2500 \), which corresponds to option D.

### Conclusion:
The proton makes \( 2500 \) revolutions in the synchrocyclotron. 

Answer: D

Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a synchrocyclotron, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to work through it. The question is asking how many revolutions a proton makes in the synchrocyclotron. Let's see what I remember about cyclotrons and synchrocyclotrons.

I know that cyclotrons are particle accelerators that use a magnetic field and an electric field to accelerate charged particles. The key point is that the magnetic field keeps the particles moving in a circular path, and the electric field accelerates them each time they pass through the gap between the dees (those D-shaped electrodes).

Wait, but this is a synchrocyclotron. Oh right, synchrocyclotrons are a type of cyclotron where the magnetic field isn't constant. Instead, it increases with time. That probably affects how the particles are accelerated because as the magnetic field increases, the cyclotron frequency changes. But I'm not entirely sure how that plays into the calculations here.

The problem says a proton is injected at t=0 with negligible kinetic energy, so T ≈ 0. It undergoes two accelerations to reach a kinetic energy T1 of 950 MeV. Wait, two accelerations? Or two acceleration cycles? Hmm, maybe that's a typo, but I'll proceed as given. The voltage applied is U(t) = U0 cos[2πν(α) t + Φ0]. The data given is Φ0 = π/4 and U0 = 190 kV.

Wait, the question is about the number of revolutions. So I need to figure out how many times the proton circles around the synchrocyclotron as it's being accelerated.

I remember that in cyclotrons, each time a particle passes through the electric field, it gets a little kick of energy. The number of revolutions relates to how many times it goes around the circle while being accelerated.

But since this is a synchrocyclotron, the frequency of the applied voltage isn't fixed. Because the magnetic field is changing, the cyclotron frequency ν is also changing. Oh wait, but in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases linearly with time, right? Or is there a different relation?

Wait, maybe I should think about the basic equations. The force on the proton is provided by the magnetic field. The equation governing the motion in a synchrocyclotron is a bit different from a regular cyclotron because the field isn't constant.

In a regular cyclotron, the frequency is fixed, so the time for each revolution is fixed. But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases, so the cyclotron frequency ν = (qB)/(2πm) also changes. So the frequency of the applied voltage must be adjusted to match the changing frequency of the particle's motion.

The voltage is given by U(t) = U0 cos[2π ν(α) t + Φ0]. So the angular frequency of the voltage is 2π ν(α), where ν(α) is a function that changes over time. Hmm, but I might need to find how ν relates to the magnetic field B, which in turn affects the motion of the proton.

Wait, the key here is to find the time it takes for the proton to reach 950 MeV, and then see how many times it revolves during that time.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions can be found by relating the total energy gained to the energy per revolution, and then integrating over time. But I'm not entirely sure how that would work.

Let me think about the energy. The kinetic energy gained by the proton is due to the work done by the electric field. Each time the proton passes through the electric field, it gains some energy. The voltage U is the potential difference across the gap, and the energy gained per passage is e U, where e is the proton charge. But wait, the voltage is alternating, so it's not straightforward. Actually, the proton is accelerated when the voltage is in the correct phase. So each time the voltage is at its peak, the proton gets a kick.

Wait, but since the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos( ... ), the maximum energy transfer per passage is e U0. But because the frequency of the voltage is matched to the particle's frequency, each time the particle enters the gap, the electric field is at its maximum, so it gets the maximum possible energy boost each time.

So each revolution the proton makes, it gains approximately e U0 of energy. Wait, but is that accurate? Let me check.

In a cyclotron, the time for each revolution is T = (2π m)/(q B). The electric field alternates at a frequency ν, which should be the same as the cyclotron frequency. So each half-cycle (since the electric field changes direction), the proton is accelerated once. So each full cycle (two half-cycles) would give the proton a boost of e U0, perhaps.

Wait, no, actually, each time the proton passes through the gap, it's accelerated once. So each revolution corresponds to one acceleration, and the energy gained per revolution is e U0.

Wait, but the voltage is U(t) = U0 cos( ... ), so the maximum voltage is U0. The energy per passage is e U0, assuming that the proton is accelerated each time the voltage is at its peak. So each time it goes through the gap, it gains e U0.

But in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field is increasing, which means the cyclotron frequency ν is increasing as well. So the frequency of the applied voltage must be adjusted to match the changing ν of the particle.

But how does that affect the number of revolutions? Hmm.

Let me outline the approach:

1. The proton starts from rest (T ≈ 0), so initial energy is negligible.
2. The proton is accelerated by the voltage in the synchrocyclotron. Each time it goes through the gap, it gains energy e U0.
3. The number of revolutions N is the number of times it circles the synchrocyclotron, which corresponds to how many times it's accelerated.
4. The total energy gained is e U0 * N, so N = (Total energy) / (e U0).

Wait, but wait. The total kinetic energy is 950 MeV. So if each revolution gives e U0 of energy, then N = 950 MeV / (e U0).

But we have to make sure about the units.

Let me get the values:

e (proton charge) is 1.602e-19 coulombs.

U0 is 190 kV, which is 190,000 volts.

So each revolution gives energy e * U0 = (1.602e-19 C) * (190e3 V) = 1.602e-19 * 190e3 = approximately 3.0438e-14 J.

Wait, but energy in eV is e * V, so 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So e U0 in eV is (1 eV) * U0 in volts? Wait, no. Because 1 eV = e * 1 volt. So e * U0 (in volts) gives e * U0 (in eV) as just U0 eV.

Wait, that's correct. So e * U0 is 190,000 eV, which is 190 keV. So each revolution gives 190 keV of energy.

The total energy is 950 MeV. So N = 950 MeV / 190 keV.

Wait, let me convert units: 950 MeV is 950,000 keV.

So N = 950,000 keV / 190 keV per revolution = 950,000 / 190 = let me calculate that.

950,000 divided by 190.

Hmm, 190 * 5000 = 950,000, right?

Because 190 * 5 = 950, so 190 * 5000 = 950,000.

So N would be 5000 revolutions.

Wait, but the options are A) 1864, B)5300, C)3536, D)2500.

Wait, 5000 isn't an option. So I must have made a mistake in my approach.

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption that each revolution gives 190 keV is incorrect.

Wait, maybe in a synchrocyclotron, the energy per revolution isn't fixed because the magnetic field is increasing, so the radius is increasing as the proton gains energy. But the energy per revolution might not be constant. Hmm, that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't considering the energy per revolution but the time taken.

Wait, another approach: the kinetic energy of the proton is given by T = (γ - 1) m c^2. For non-relativistic speeds, T ≈ (1/2) m v^2, but when the energy is around 950 MeV, that's way beyond non-relativistic. So the particle is ultra-relativistic.

Wait, the rest mass energy of a proton is about 938 MeV. So 950 MeV is just slightly above that, so maybe the velocity is near the speed of light.

Wait, but the initial kinetic energy is zero, so the initial velocity is zero. As it's accelerated, it gains energy.

In a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases with time. The reason for that is to keep the particle's orbit synchronized with the accelerating electric field. Because as the particle gains energy, its velocity increases, and if the magnetic field remains constant, the time for each revolution (and thus the cyclotron frequency) would change. Hence, the magnetic field is adjusted to keep the cyclotron frequency matching the frequency of the accelerating voltage.

But how does this affect the number of revolutions?

Wait, perhaps the time it takes to reach the desired energy is important. Let's think about the rate of energy gain.

The power (energy per unit time) gained by the proton is related to the electric field. But since the voltage is at a fixed amplitude, the average power might be constant, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, since the proton is moving relativistically, its energy increases and the time dilation might come into play, but perhaps that's complicating things beyond the scope of this problem.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is more straightforward. Let me think again.

The energy per revolution isn't fixed because the magnetic field is changing, so the radius of the proton's orbit is increasing. Because the magnetic field B is increasing, the radius r = (γ m v )/(q B) increases as B increases. Wait, but how does this affect the energy per revolution?

Wait, the energy gained per revolution in a synchrocyclotron is actually different from a cyclotron because the magnetic field is varying.

Wait, maybe each revolution doesn't give the same energy boost. So my initial approach, assuming a fixed energy per revolution, isn't correct.

Hmm, perhaps I need to find the time taken to reach the desired energy and then find how many revolutions occur in that time.

Wait, how do I find the time? The problem is a bit tricky because the acceleration and the magnetic field are time-dependent.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the kinetic energy in a synchrocyclotron.

I remember that the kinetic energy T of a proton in a synchrocyclotron can be expressed as T = (e U0) * (t) / (2π), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: the energy gain per cycle is e U0, and the number of cycles (revolutions) N is T/(e U0). But in a synchrocyclotron, the frequency ν depends on time because B is changing.

Wait, the frequency of the applied voltage must match the cyclotron frequency of the proton at each moment. So the angular frequency of the voltage is 2π ν(t), where ν(t) = (q B(t))/(2π m). So the voltage's frequency is the same as the proton's cyclotron frequency.

But since B is increasing, the frequency ν(t) is also increasing.

But how does this relate to the number of revolutions?

Alternatively, maybe we can model the acceleration as linear in time, since in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field B is usually increased linearly with time to keep the cyclotron frequency matched with the driving frequency.

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Maybe the relation between the magnetic field and time is B(t) = B0 + kt, where k is some constant. If that's the case, then the cyclotron frequency ν(t) = (e B(t))/(2π m). So ν(t) is proportional to B(t).

But perhaps this is getting too complicated.

Wait, maybe I can use the formula for the number of revolutions in a synchrocyclotron. I think I remember that the number of revolutions N is given by N = (sqrt(T^2 + (e U0)^2) - e U0 )/(e U0) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, so perhaps I should look for a simpler way.

Let me think about the energy. The total energy is 950 MeV, and the maximum energy per revolution is 190 keV. So 950 MeV is 950,000 keV. Dividing that by 190 keV per revolution gives approximately 5000 revolutions. But 5000 isn't an option. The closest option is B)5300, but that's higher. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy per revolution isn't exactly 190 keV. Maybe each revolution gives less energy because of the increasing magnetic field. So the energy per revolution decreases as the proton's energy increases.

Wait, that makes sense. Because as the magnetic field increases, the radius of the proton's orbit increases, and perhaps the time it spends in the electric field increases or decreases, which affects the energy gain per revolution.

Hmm, if each revolution gives less energy than the previous, then the number of revolutions would be more than 5000. But the options don't have 5000. The highest option is B)5300.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect because in a synchrocyclotron, the number of revolutions isn't simply the total energy divided by energy per revolution.

Alternatively, I might need to consider the relationship between the magnetic field, the accelerating voltage, and the number of revolutions.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for the number of revolutions in a synchrocyclotron is N = (T * m) / (e * U0 * (something)). But I'm not remembering the exact formula.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the equation governing the motion of the proton in a synchrocyclotron. The equation of motion is derived from the Lorentz force. The radial equation for the motion is:

m (r'' ) = (e v / B) (something). Hmm, not exactly recalling.

Alternatively, the equation is m γ r d^2 θ/dt^2 = e E, where E is the electric field, γ is the Lorentz factor. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to find the time of acceleration and then compute the number of revolutions based on the frequency during that time.

Wait, but without knowing how B(t) changes, it's difficult to find the time.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the energy gained. The kinetic energy T of the proton is given by the integral of the power over time. The power is P = e * U(t) * f(t), where f(t) is the frequency at which the proton passes through the gap.

Wait, but this might be getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions can be found using the relation N = (T)/(e U0) * (something), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: in a regular cyclotron, the number of revolutions N can be found from N = (T)/(e U0) * (something related to the cyclotron frequency). But in a synchrocyclotron, since the frequency is changing, this complicates things.

Alternatively, since the problem gives the voltage as U(t) = U0 cos[2π ν(α) t + Φ0], maybe ν(α) is a function that changes with the phase α, which is related to the number of revolutions.

Wait, perhaps α is the phase, which would be 2π N, where N is the number of revolutions. So then, 2π ν(t) t + Φ0 = α.

But I'm not sure about this.

Alternatively, perhaps the cyclotron frequency ν(t) is equal to the frequency of the voltage, so 2π ν(t) = 2π ν(α) => ν(t) = ν(α). So α would be related to the phase shift, which could be linked to the time.

But I'm getting stuck here.

Let me try a different approach. Let's calculate the energy per revolution in a synchrocyclotron.

In a regular cyclotron, the energy per revolution is e U0, because the voltage is applied once per revolution, and the proton gains e U0 each time. So the number of revolutions N = T/(e U0).

But in a synchrocyclotron, because B is increasing, the time per revolution is changing. So each revolution takes longer as the proton gains energy. And because the voltage is applied at a frequency that matches the cyclotron frequency, which is changing, the number of revolutions doesn't increase as simply as in a regular cyclotron.

Wait, perhaps the number of revolutions is actually higher because each revolution takes longer. So the same total time would allow for more revolutions than in a regular cyclotron.

Wait, but in this problem, the total energy is fixed. So perhaps the number of revolutions is similar to the regular cyclotron case, but adjusted for the varying B.

Alternatively, perhaps in a synchrocyclotron, the number of revolutions N is given by N = (T)/(e U0) * (some factor based on the magnetic field profile).

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I can find the time it takes to reach 950 MeV, and then use the time to find the number of revolutions.

How?

The energy gained is e U0 multiplied by the number of times the voltage is applied in phase. Since the frequency is changing, the number of applications might be a bit tricky, but perhaps the energy can be considered as T ≈ e U0 N, so N ≈ T/(e U0) = 950 MeV / 190 keV = 5000 as before. But since this isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the options are A)1864, B)5300, C)3536, D)2500.

Wait, perhaps the actual energy per revolution isn't 190 keV, but less because the time per revolution is increasing. Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to consider the relativistic relation between energy and velocity.

Wait, but the initial assumption might be that the energy per revolution is e U0, but perhaps the correct formula for T is T = N e U0, where N is the number of revolutions. Then, N = T/(e U0) = 950e6 eV / (190e3 eV) ) = 950e6 / 190e3 = 950000 / 190000 = 5.

Wait, no, that can't be right. 950e6 eV is 950,000,000 eV, and 190e3 is 190,000 eV. So 950,000,000 / 190,000 is approximately 5000.

Wait, but the options don't have 5000, but option B is 5300. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, 950,000,000 eV divided by 190,000 eV per revolution:

950,000,000 / 190,000 = 9500000 / 19000 = 500000 / 1900 ≈ 263.16 revolutions. No, that's not right.

Wait, wait, no, 950,000,000 eV is 950 MeV, and 190,000 eV is 0.19 MeV. So 950 MeV / 0.19 MeV per revolution = 950 / 0.19 = approximately 5000.

Yes, that's 5000 revolutions. But the options don't have 5000. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe the number of revolutions isn't N = T/(e U0), but something else.

Another thought: in a synchrocyclotron, the number of revolutions is linked to the time taken to reach the desired energy.

Each revolution gives a certain amount of energy, but because the magnetic field is increasing, the acceleration voltage's frequency must change. So perhaps the time per revolution isn't constant, which complicates the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of revolutions is found using the equation derived from the motion in a synchrocyclotron.

I think the formula for the number of revolutions N in a synchrocyclotron is given by N = ( (sqrt( (e U0)^2 + (m c^2)^2 ) ) - m c^2 ) / (e U0) )

Wait, but that looks like the formula for the number of revolutions in a cyclotron when considering relativistic effects. Let me verify.

In a cyclotron, the maximum energy is achieved when N e U0 = (gamma -1) m c^2. So N = ( (gamma -1) m c^2 ) / (e U0). But in the relativistic case, gamma is sqrt(1 + (p c)^2/(m^2 c^4)), but perhaps that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is N = ( (e U0) ) / (2 pi m c^2) ) * sqrt( (T + m c^2)/(T) ) ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the kinetic energy T = (gamma -1) m c^2. The momentum p = gamma m v. But in a synchrocyclotron, the radius r is given by r = (p c)/(e B), where B is the magnetic field.

Since the magnetic field is increasing, B(t) = B0 + kt, perhaps, but I'm not sure. Maybe if B increases linearly, then r increases as well.

But how does this tie into the number of revolutions?

Hmm, perhaps I should use the relation between the number of revolutions and the integral over time.

Wait, the number of revolutions N is the integral over time of the cyclotron frequency ν(t). Since each revolution corresponds to a frequency of 1 revolution per second, the total number is the integral of ν(t) dt from 0 to t_total.

So N = ∫ ν(t) dt.

But what is ν(t) in a synchrocyclotron?

In a synchrocyclotron, the cyclotron frequency is ν(t) = (e B(t))/(2 pi m). And the applied voltage has a frequency that matches this ν(t). So the number of revolutions is the integral of ν(t) dt from 0 to t_total.

But to find t_total, I need to find the time it takes for the proton to reach 950 MeV.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express the energy in terms of the integral of ν(t) dt.

Wait, the kinetic energy T is (gamma -1) m c^2. The work done by the electric field is e U0 multiplied by the number of times the field is applied in phase, which is N. But since the voltage is applied at varying frequency, the number N isn't simply T/(e U0).

I'm getting stuck again. Maybe I should look for a formula that relates the number of revolutions in a synchrocyclotron to the energy and voltage.

Wait, I found a resource that says the number of revolutions N in a synchrocyclotron is given by:

N = (T) / (e U0) * (something)

But I'm not finding the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is N = (gamma) * (e U0) / (m c^2), but I'm uncertain.

Wait, perhaps it's time to make an educated guess. Earlier, I thought N was 5000, but the options don't have that. The closest option is B)5300. So perhaps the correct answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversion. Let me recheck.

e U0 is 190,000 eV, which is 190 keV. The proton's energy is 950 MeV, which is 950,000 keV.

So dividing 950,000 keV by 190 keV gives 5000. So N=5000.

But the options don't have 5000. So perhaps the question is asking for the number of half-revolutions or something else.

Wait, perhaps each revolution corresponds to two applications of the voltage. Because in a cyclotron, the electric field alternates direction every half-cycle, so the proton is accelerated once per full cycle. So each revolution may correspond to one acceleration. But if the voltage is applied twice per revolution, then N would be half of 5000, which is 2500. Hmm, option D is 2500.

But that would imply that each revolution corresponds to two applications, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps each time the proton passes through the gap, it gets a little energy, so each passage (every half-revolution?) gives some energy. So perhaps the number of passages is 5000, which would correspond to 2500 revolutions.

But I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to model the problem as follows:

In a regular cyclotron, the number of revolutions is N = T/(e U0). But in a synchrocyclotron, because the magnetic field is increasing, the frequency ν(t) increases, so the number of revolutions is higher. Therefore, the correct number of revolutions is more than 5000. The only option higher than 5000 is B)5300.

So perhaps the answer is B)5300.

But why would it be higher than 5000? Because in a synchrocyclotron, the magnetic field increases, allowing more revolutions as the proton gains energy, perhaps? Or maybe because the time per revolution increases, leading to more revolutions over the same time period. Wait, no, higher magnetic field would make the cyclotron frequency higher, leading to more revolutions per second, but perhaps the total time taken to reach the desired energy is less, leading to more revolutions.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused.

Another approach: perhaps the formula for the number of revolutions is N = (gamma) / (something). Alternatively, perhaps considering the relation between the energy and the magnetic field.

But I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the following relation:

In a synchrocyclotron, the kinetic energy T is given by T = e U0 N, where N is the number of revolutions. Thus, N = T/(e U0) = (950e6 eV)/(190e3 eV) ) = 5000 revolutions.

But since this isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Maybe because the magnetic field is changing, the effective energy per revolution is less than 190 keV, so the actual number of revolutions is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that each revolution gives 190 keV is incorrect because as the magnetic field increases, the time spent in the gap increases, leading to more energy per revolution.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I'm really stuck here.

Given the options and my initial calculation leading to 5000, which isn't present, perhaps the intended answer is 5000. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the voltage is applied twice per revolution. So each revolution gives two energy boosts. Then, the number of revolutions would be 5000 / 2 = 2500. Which is option D.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is C)3536. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The problem says the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach T1=950 MeV. Two accelerations? So perhaps, each revolution gives two accelerations. So the number of accelerations is 2N. So the total energy would be 2N * e U0.

So N = T/(2 e U0) ) = 950e6 eV / (2 * 190e3 eV) ) = 950e6 / 380e3 = 2500. So 2500 revolutions.

Which would correspond to option D.

Ah! That makes sense. Because if each revolution includes two acceleration events (since the voltage alternates), then the number of accelerations is 2N, where N is the number of revolutions. So the total energy is 2N * e U0.

So N = T/(2 e U0) = 950e6 / (2 * 190e3) = 950e6/(380e3) = 950000 / 380000 ≈ 2.5. Wait, no, wait.

Wait, 950e6 eV is 950,000,000 eV.

Divide by 2 * 190e3 eV = 380,000 eV.

So 950,000,000 / 380,000 = approximately 2500.

So N = 2500.

Which is option D.

So the correct answer should be D)2500.


To determine the number of revolutions a proton makes in a synchrocyclotron, we analyze the energy gain and the relationship between the applied voltage and the proton's motion. The proton starts with negligible kinetic energy and is accelerated to a kinetic energy of \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} \). The voltage applied is \( U(t) = U_0 \cos[2\pi \nu(\alpha) t + \Phi_0] \), where \( U_0 = 190 \, \text{kV} \) and \( \Phi_0 = \frac{\pi}{4} \).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Energy Gain per Revolution**:  
   In a synchrocyclotron, the proton gains energy as it passes through the electric field. Each revolution corresponds to one acceleration event, and the energy gained per revolution is approximately \( e U_0 \), where \( e \) is the proton charge and \( U_0 \) is the amplitude of the applied voltage. For this problem, \( e U_0 = 190 \, \text{keV} \).

2. **Total Energy and Number of Revolutions**:  
   The total kinetic energy of the proton is \( T_1 = 950 \, \text{MeV} = 950,000 \, \text{keV} \). The number of revolutions \( N \) is given by the total energy divided by the energy gained per revolution:
   \[
   N = \frac{T_1}{e U_0} = \frac{950,000 \, \text{keV}}{190 \, \text{keV}} = 5000.
   \]

3. **Adjustment for Alternating Voltage**:  
   The problem specifies that the proton undergoes two accelerations to reach the final energy. This implies that each revolution includes two acceleration events. Therefore, the total number of revolutions is halved:
   \[
   N = \frac{5000}{2} = 2500.
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:  
   Among the given options, the closest match to the calculated number of revolutions is \( 2500 \), which corresponds to option D.

### Conclusion:
The proton makes \( 2500 \) revolutions in the synchrocyclotron. 

Answer: D
