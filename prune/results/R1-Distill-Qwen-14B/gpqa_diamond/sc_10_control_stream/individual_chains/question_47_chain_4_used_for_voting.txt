Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. The compound is C9H11NO2. The data given includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different compounds, so I need to match the spectral data with one of them.

First, I'll look at the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation, which can be rings and double bonds. So probably a benzene ring (which is 4 degrees) and a double bond (maybe a carbonyl group) makes sense.

Looking at the IR data: there are strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are likely N-H stretches. If it's a primary amine, the N-H would be around 3300-3500, maybe two bands for the two protons. Wait, but the options might have different functional groups. Another big peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong band, probably a carbonyl group. Could be an ester, amide, ketone, etc. But since the options include things like benzamide, formamide, propionate, and benzoate, ester or amide would fit.

Now, the 1H NMR:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H: This looks like a methyl group attached to an oxygen, maybe like an ethyl group. Because ethyl groups have triplet for the CH2CH3, but wait, in this case, the triplet is at 1.20, and coupled to two neighboring H's. So this would be the CH2 group in an ethyl group, where the CH3 is attached to CH2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in ethyl groups, the CH2CH3 would have the triplet on the CH2? No, wait, the triplet is for the CH2 next to a CH3. So if the triplet is at 1.20, that's the CH2CH3. So the ethyl group is part of the structure.

Then, 4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet suggests possibly an NH group, but wait, the integration is 2H. If it's NH2, that would be a broad peak, but maybe it's an OCH2 group? Or perhaps something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide NH, but with 2H. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group adjacent to something deshielded.

Next, 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H. Quartet would mean coupling with a group that has 3 neighboring H's. Wait, but 2H quartet could be a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. For example, in an ethyl group, the CH2 near the O would be a quartet. Like in an ethyl ester: OCH2CH3. The CH2 next to O would show as quartet because it's next to the CH3, which has 3 H's. So 4.5 ppm quartet, 2H: that looks like an OCH2.

Then, aromatic protons: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because the two doublets each have 2H, so two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. That's typical for a para-substituted aromatic ring, because the two protons ortho to the substituent would be one doublet, and the other two would be another. Wait, no, actually, in para substitution, the two protons on each adjacent carbon would each couple with each other. So for example, if there's a substituent at position 4, then the protons at 2 and 6 would be one doublet, and 3 and 5 would be another. Or something like that, but the key point is each doublet has two H's, so it's probably a para substitution.

Putting this together: The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene ring, so the substituent is at the para position. Now, the substituent could be an amide group, an ester, an ether, etc., depending on the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with ethoxy group at the meta position. Wait, but the substituent is at position 3, which is meta, so the aromatic protons would not be a para arrangement. So probably not this one.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the phenyl group is substituted with an ethoxy at position 4. Then the formamide group (CONH2) would be attached to the N. Wait, but formamide is HCONH2. Wait, but the structure would have the phenyl group attached to the N of the formamide. So the benzene ring is 4-ethoxy, and the formamide is attached to the N. So the structure is O=C(NHPh)NH2? Wait, no, formamide is RCONH2. So in this case, R is 4-ethoxyphenyl, so the structure would be Ph-O-CH2-CH2-NH-C(=O)-H? Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, the formamide is R-NH-C(=O)-H, but more likely, it's N-attached. Wait, maybe it's O=C(NH-Ph-OEt). Hmm, perhaps I should think about the NMR for this.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure is PhNH2 attached to a propionyl group. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-? No, wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the propionate would be CH2CH2COO-. But if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, perhaps it's O=C(O-)CH2CH2NHPh. Wait, but the amino is at position 4. So the structure would be an amino group attached to the benzene ring, and then a propionate group. But I'm not sure how the substituents would affect the NMR.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is benzoate ester, with aminophenyl group. Benzoate ester would be O=C-OCH2CH3, and the amino group is at position 4. So the structure is Ph-NH2 attached to the benzoate ester. Wait, no, the benzoate ester is O=C-OEt, and the amino group is on the benzene ring at the para position. So the benzene would have substituents at positions 4 (NH2) and 1 (OEt), but wait, that would be meta. Wait, no, if the ester is on the benzene ring, and the amino group is para to it. So the substituents are on positions 1 and 4 of the benzene ring. So the benzene has OEt and NH2 at the para positions. So the structure would be ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is OEt attached to the carbonyl, which is attached to the benzene ring that has an amino group at the para position.

Now, considering the NMR data. Let's go option by option.

Looking at the 1H NMR.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OEt
|
Ph-NH2

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the benzoate ester is OEt-O-CO-Ph, with the Ph having NH2 at the para position. So the structure is OEt-O-CO-Ph-NH2, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the ester is OEt attached to the carbonyl, which is attached to the benzene ring. The benzene ring has an amino group at the para position relative to the ester group.

So the structure is:

Ph-O-CO-OEt, but wait, no. The ester is O-CO-OEt, but attached to the benzene. Wait, no, the benzoate ester is OEt-O-CO-Ph. So the ester is OEt-O-CO-Ph, and the Ph has an NH2 group in the para position to the ester.

So the substituents on the benzene are O-CO-OEt and NH2 at para positions.

Now, back to the NMR.

The ethyl group: the OCH2CH3 would split into quartet and triplet. The ethyl ester group usually shows the CH2 next to O as quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm, and the CH3 as triplet around 1.2-1.4 ppm. In the given NMR, the triplet is at 1.20 ppm (3H), and quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H). So in the structure, the ethyl group is split into CH2CH3, where the CH2 is attached to O. So that fits with the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) and triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H). So that's the ethyl group from the ester.

Now, the aromatic protons: the para substitution would lead to two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that matches the NMR given.

What about the other signals? The 4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Hmm. If the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, then the NH2 group would be on the benzene. But the NH2 protons are usually broad, but in this case, the broad singlet is 2H. Wait, NH2 is normally two protons, but their signals are usually broad and might split into a singlet if they're not near any other protons. Wait, but in aniline derivatives, the NH2 protons are typically broad, but in D, the amine is attached to the benzene ring, so it's a para-aminobenzoate.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet integrating for 2H. So that could be the NH2 protons. Because in aniline, the NH2 is usually around 5-6 ppm, but if it's de-shielded, maybe it's at 4.0. Alternatively, maybe it's another group.

Wait, but another possibility: the 4.0 ppm could be an OCH2 group, but that would more likely be a quartet. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide NH, but since the structure is an ester, not an amide, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is the NH group in a different part.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm isn't the NH2 group. Let me think. Maybe the structure is different. Let's consider option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure: O
         ||
H-N-C-O-Ph-OEt

Wait, the formamide would be HCONH-Ph-OEt. So the N is connected to the formamide carbonyl and the phenyl group. The ethoxy is at the para position of the phenyl.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be at 7 and 8 ppm, similar to the given data. The ethoxy group would show up as the triplet and quartet as well.

But what about the other signals? The 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (2H). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the NH is present. Formamide usually has NH protons. But in this case, formamide is HCONHR, where R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the NH would be a singlet, perhaps around 8-9 ppm if it's exchanging, but broad. Alternatively, maybe it's split into a different peak.

Wait, in the given NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet (2H). So perhaps this is from something else.

Alternatively, looking at the IR data: strong band at 1720 cm-1. Which could be ester or amide carbonyl.

If it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1720, which fits. If it's an amide, the carbonyl would be around 1650-1700, perhaps. But the given IR has 1720, so ester is more likely.

So, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is an ester. So the carbonyl is around 1720, which matches the IR.

In that structure, the NH2 is on the benzene ring. The NH2 protons would typically appear as a broad signal. So in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H) could be the NH2 group. But wait, aniline protons are usually around 5-6 ppm. If it's an amino group in a more deshielded environment, perhaps it's shifted downfield. Alternatively, maybe it's not the NH2. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group that's part of another substituent. Wait, but in option D, the substituents are OEt and NH2 on the benzene. So the OCH2CH3 is from the ethyl ester, which we've accounted for in the 1.20 ppm triplet and 4.5 ppm quartet.

So the 4.0 ppm (2H, broad) is left. Maybe it's an NH group. Wait, the amino group is NH2, which would be two protons. So in that case, maybe it's those protons. But why are they at 4.0? Maybe the amine is in a different environment, perhaps hindered, or de-shielded.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is from an NH adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps an amide. But in option D, it's a benzoate ester, not an amide.

Wait, another option to think about: option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

In that case, the structure would be HCONH-Ph-OEt, with the ethoxy at para. The formamide would have NH protons. So the NH would be a singlet, perhaps around 8-9 ppm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the NH could be split, but that's less likely. 

In the NMR, the 4.0 ppm (2H, broad) would have to account for something else. Maybe an oxygenated CH2 group? But in the structure, the ethoxy is at the para position, so the OCH2CH3 would be the triplet and quartet we saw. So perhaps the 4.0 is another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH group of the formamide, but that seems a bit high. Formamide NH's are usually around 8 ppm, but can vary.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the functional groups. The IR shows a strong peak at 1720, which suggests an ester carbonyl. So the compound is likely an ester. So options D and C (propionate) could be esters, perhaps. Wait, option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate would be CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3? Or PhNH2 attached to a propionyl group. Wait, no, it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, which would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the phenyl with amino group.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720, which is typical for esters. So if option C is a propionate (ester), then the carbonyl would be around 1720. So that would fit.

Wait, but the NMR for option C would have a different structure. Let's think: 4-aminophenyl propionate is PhNH2 attached to a propionate ester. So the structure would be PhNH2-COO-R, where R is CH2CH2CH3. So the propionyl group would be CH2CH2COO-R.

In that case, the propionate group would contribute a triplet for the CH2 next to the ester oxygen. So the ester would be OCO-CH2CH2CH3. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, which would be from the OCH2 group (if it's an ester like OCO-CH2CH2CH3), but that would have a triplet for the CH2 near the ester O. Wait, no, for a propionate ester, the structure would be O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, the ester is O-CO-O-R. So R is CH2CH2CH3. So the OCH2CH2CH3 would have a triplet for the CH2 next to O (if the R is CH2CH2CH3), but wait, the structure OCH2CH2CH3 would have the CH2 next to O as a quartet, but that's not matching the given NMR.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. For an ethyl ester (OCH2CH3), the CH2 next to O is a quartet (coupled with the CH3), and the CH3 is a triplet. So in the NMR, 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) would be the OCH2, and 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) the CH3.

In option C, the ester would be a propyl group: OCH2CH2CH3. So the OCH2 would be a quartet (since it's next to a CH2 with 2 H's?), wait no, wait OCH2CH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as a quartet because it's next to CH2CH3. Wait, no, actually, in OCH2CH2CH3, the OCH2 is adjacent to a CH2 with two H's, which would cause a triplet. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Let's think about the splitting.

In ethyl ester (OCH2CH3): the CH2 is next to a CH3 with 3 H's, so the CH2 is a quartet. The CH3 is a triplet because it's next to the CH2, which has 2 H's.

In propyl ester (OCH2CH2CH3): the CH2 next to O is attached to another CH2, which is attached to CH3. So the OCH2 would be a quartet (coupled with the adjacent CH2), and the middle CH2 would be a triplet (coupled with both OCH2 and CH3). The CH3 would be a triplet as well, but that's in a different part.

Wait, but in the given NMR, we have a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) and triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H). That fits the ethyl group, which suggests that the ester is ethyl, not propyl. So options with ethyl ester would fit.

So looking back, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which would have OCH2CH3 as the ester group, matching the NMR.

So then, the 4.0 ppm (2H, broad) must be something else. If the structure is D, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the substituents on benzene are OEt (ester) and NH2 (para). So the NH2 protons would typically be a broad peak. Let's think about their chemical shift.

In aniline derivatives, the NH2 protons are usually around 5-6 ppm. But in some cases, they can be shifted downfield or upfield. If the amino group is para to an electron-withdrawing group like ester, it might be more deshielded, causing the NH2 protons to appear downfield. So perhaps around 4.0 ppm? That's possible, but it's a bit lower than usual.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from another group. Let me think about the other options again.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the structure is O
                                      |
H-N-C=O attached to the phenyl group with OEt at para.

So the NMR would have: the ethoxy group as triplet and quartet (like in option D). The formamide NH would be a singlet, perhaps around 8-9 ppm, but it's a broad peak. But in the given NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet, which would not fit that. So perhaps that's not the case.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide has a CONH2 group attached to the benzene. So the structure would be Ph-OCH2CH3 (meta) and CONH2. The NH2 would be around 8 ppm, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad, which doesn't match.

So putting it all together, the best fit seems to be option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The IR matches the ester carbonyl, the ethyl group matches the NMR triplet and quartet, the aromatic protons are para-substituted, and the 4.0 ppm might be the NH2 group, perhaps shifted downfield due to the electron-withdrawing ester group.

Wait, but another thought: in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is on the benzene ring, but the ester is also on the ring. So the structure would be O=C-OEt attached to the benzene, which has an NH2 group at the para position.

So the aromatic protons would be at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm as doublets, which matches the NMR. The ethyl ester gives the triplet and quartet. Then the NH2 would give a broad peak. But why is that at 4.0 ppm? Wait, maybe it's not the NH2 but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group from another substituent. But in this structure, the substituents are OEt and NH2, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: the 4.0 ppm is the NH in an amide. But in option D, it's an ester, not an amide. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again about the options.

Wait, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-O-Et
|
Ph-NH2

Wait, no, the structure is benzoate ester, so it's Ph-C(=O)-O-Et, and the Ph has an NH2 group at the para position. So the structure is:

Ph-O-C(=O)-O-Et with NH2 at the para position of the benzene.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The structure is OEt-O-C(=O)-Ph, with the Ph group having an NH2 at the para position.

So the substituents on the benzene are at positions 1 (ester) and 4 (NH2). So the ring has O-CO-OEt and NH2 at opposite positions.

Now, the NH2 group would be adjacent to the carbonyl group, which is electron-withdrawing. The NH2 is a strong activating group, while the ester is deactivating. So the ring would have an NH2 and an ester group in para positions.

The 1H NMR shows a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). If it's the NH2, that's possible if the protons are split or shifted. Alternatively, maybe it's not NH2 but another group. Wait, but the molecular formula has one N. So the N in option D is in the NH2 group and the ester group.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count for option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: benzoate means C7H5O2 (benzoic acid is C7H6O2, but as the ester, it's C7H5O2). The ethyl ester adds C2H5, so total is C9H10O2. But wait, the formula is C9H11NO2.

Wait, so that doesn't fit. Wait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2. When esterified with ethanol, it becomes C9H10O2. But the formula given is C9H11NO2. So we have one more N and one more H.

Ah, that's a problem. So option D has a molecular formula of C9H10O2, but the question is C9H11NO2. So that can't be right. Did I count wrong?

Wait, let me calculate. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Ester with ethanol (C2H5OH) would replace the -OH with O-C2H5. So the ester would be C7H5O2 + C2H5O. So molecular formula becomes C9H10O2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2, which has one more N and one more H.

Hmm, so option D doesn't fit the molecular formula. So that rules out D.

Wait, what about option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Formamide is HCONH2. If it's substituted with 4-ethoxyphenyl, the structure is HCONH-Ph-OEt. So the molecular formula would be:

Ph: C6H5
OEt: C2H5O
Formamide: HCONH- (so adds C=O, NH, and H)

So the formula is C6H5-CO-NH-C2H5O.

Wait, let's compute:

Ph (C6H5) + OEt (C2H5O) + formamide (HCONH-):

C: 6 + 2 + 1 (from CO) =9
H: 5 (from Ph) +5 (from OEt) + (HCONH: 2 H from NH and 1 from CO? Wait, perhaps I should count each part.

Ph is C6H5.

OEt is OCH2CH3: adding 2 C and 7 H (O is not counted as C).

Formamide is HCONH-: HCONH- has formula C=O-NH-, which is C1H1N1O1.

So combining:

C6 (Ph) + 2 (OEt) +1 (formamide) =9 C.

H: 5 (Ph) + 7 (OEt) + 2 (HCONH, the H from CO and NH?) Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, the molecular formula of N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be:

Ph-OEt: C6H5-OCH2CH3 → C8H9O2.

Formamide part: HCONH-Ph-OEt.

So HCONH- is C=O-NH-, so adding that gives C9H10N O2?

Wait, let me think: HCONH-Ph-OEt.

Ph-OEt is C6H5-O-C2H5 → molecular formula C8H11O2.

Adding HCONH: which is C1H2NO.

So total: C8+1=9, H:11+2=13? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should just compute the molecular formula.

Each group:

Ph-OEt: C6H5-OCH2CH3 → C8H9O2.

Formamide part: HCONH- → HCONH-R. So HCONH-R would be (HCO) (NH-R). So molecular formula would be:

Ph-OEt: C8H9O2.

HCONH- adds CO, NH, and H.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count all atoms:

Ph-OEt: C6H5-O-C2H5 → C6 + C2 = C8; H:5 (Ph) +5 (OEt) =10, plus O2.

Formamide: HCONH- → HCONH is C1H3N1O1.

So when combined as HCONH-Ph-OEt:

C: 6 (Ph) + 2 (OEt) +1 (CO) =9 C.

H: 5 (Ph) +5 (OEt) +3 (HCONH) =13 H.

O: 2 (Ph-O) +1 (CO) +1 (OEt) =4 O? No, wait, the O in the formamide is part of the CO, and the O in the ester is from the OEt. So perhaps O count is:

Formamide CO: 1 O.

Ph-OEt: 2 O (the O in Ph-O and the O in OEt? No, the OEt is OCH2CH3, which is one O. So total O: 2 (Ph-O and OEt) +1 (CO) =3 O.

Wait, but the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2.

Wait, our count for option B's formula would be C9H13N O3? That seems off. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, let me compute the molecular formula for each option:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Benzamide is PhCONH2. So 3-ethoxy would be OCH2CH3 attached at position 3.

Molecular formula: Ph (C6H5) + CONH2 (C1H2N O) + OCH2CH3 (C2H5O).

So C:6 +1 +2=9.

H:5 (Ph) +2 (CONH2) +5 (OCH2CH3) + any H from substituents.

Wait, the OCH2CH3 adds 5 H (CH2CH3 has 3 H in CH3 and 2 in CH2?), but wait, OCH2CH3 has 5 H? No, OCH2CH3 is CH2CH3O- attached to the ring. So the CH2 has 2 H, CH3 has 3 H. So OCH2CH3 has 5 H.

So total H: 5 (Ph) +2 (CONH2) +5 (OCH2CH3) + any other H? Benzamide is PhCONH2, which has H on the NH2. So that's 2 H.

So total H:5 (Ph) +5 (OCH2CH3) + 2 (CONH2) =12 H. Plus any from the substituents? No. So C9H12NO2.

But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So option A would have C9H12NO2, which is one H more than needed. So option A is not the correct formula.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Formamide is HCONH-R. R is 4-ethoxyphenyl.

So molecular formula:

Ph-OEt is C8H9O2.

HCONH adds C=O and NH.

So C: 8 (Ph-OEt) +1 (HCO) +1 (NH) → wait, HCONH is C1H2NO.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think:

Ph-OEt: C6H5-OCH2CH3 → C8H9O2.

HCONH-Ph-OEt: C1H3NO attached to C8H9O2.

So total C:8+1=9.

H:9 (from Ph-OEt) +3 (from HCONH) =12 H.

O:2 (from Ph-OEt) +1 (from HCONH) =3 O.

Wait, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. So option B would be C9H12NO3, which doesn't match. So that's not correct.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me check option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Propionate is CH2CH2COO-.

So the structure is PhNH2-COO-CH2CH2CH3.

Molecular formula: Ph is C6H5, NH2 adds 1N and 2H. COO- adds 2O and 2C (from COO-), and CH2CH2CH3 adds 3C and 7H.

So total:

C:6 (Ph) +1 (NH2) +2 (COO) +3 (CH2CH2CH3) =12 C? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the structure is PhNH2-COO-(CH2)2CH3.

Wait, the propionate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, the correct formula for propionate is C3H5O2^-.

Wait, let me compute:

PhNH2: C6H5NH2 → C6H7N.

Propionate: C3H5O2^-.

So combining, the formula is C6 + C3 = C9, H:7 +5=12, N:1, O:2.

But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So option C would be C9H12N O2, which has one more H than needed. So that's not matching.

Wait, but maybe I'm not counting correctly. Let me think again.

PhNH2-COO-R where R is CH2CH2CH3.

So PhNH2 is C6H5NH2 → C6H7N.

COO-R: R is CH2CH2CH3 → C3H7.

So COO-R is C3H7O2.

So overall, C6 + C3 = C9, H:7 (PhNH2) +7 (COO-R) =14 H. Plus any from the COO? Wait, no, the COO is part of the propionate. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the molecular formula for each option.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Benzoate is C7H5O2^- (from benzoic acid, C7H6O2, losing one H to form the ester).

Ester with ethyl: so the ester would be C7H5O2 + C2H5O → C9H10O2.

But the formula is C9H11NO2. So that's one more N and one more H than option D. So option D's formula is C9H10O2, but given is C9H11NO2. So that doesn't match.

Hmm, none of the options seem to match the molecular formula. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, let me compute the molecular formula for each option again.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Structure: Ph-OCH2CH3 (at position 3) and CONH2.

Ph is C6H5. OCH2CH3 is C2H5O. CONH2 is C1H2NO2.

Wait, so C:6 +2 +1 =9.

H:5 (Ph) +5 (OCH2CH3) +2 (CONH2) =12.

O: 1 (OCH2CH3) +2 (CONH2) =3.

N:1.

So formula: C9H12NO3.

But given formula is C9H11NO2. So no match.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure: HCONH-Ph-OEt.

Ph-OEt is C8H9O2.

HCONH adds C1H3N O.

So C:8 +1=9.

H:9 +3=12.

O:2 +1=3.

N:1.

So formula: C9H12NO3. Again, doesn't match.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Structure: PhNH2-COO-CH2CH2CH3.

PhNH2 is C6H7N.

Propionate is C3H5O2.

So total C:6 +3=9.

H:7 +5=12.

O:2.

N:1.

So formula: C9H12NO2. But given is C9H11NO2. So one H less.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: Ph-O-CO-OEt with NH2 at para.

Ph-O-CO-OEt: Ph is C6H5, O-CO-OEt is C3H5O3.

So C:6 +3=9.

H:5 (Ph) +5 (OEt) =10.

O:3.

N:1.

So formula: C9H10NO3. Which again doesn't match.

Wait, none of the options match the given molecular formula. Did I make a mistake in counting?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The given formula is C9H11NO2.

So we're looking for a structure with 9 C, 11 H, 1 N, 2 O.

Looking at each option:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide → C9H12NO3. No.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide → C9H12NO3. No.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate → C9H12NO2. Close, but has 12 H.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate → C9H10NO3. No.

Wait, then maybe I'm miscalculating option C.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Structure: PhNH2 attached to a propionyl group (CH2CH2COO-).

So the formula would be:

PhNH2: C6H7N.

Propionyl: C3H5O2.

So combining: C6 + C3 = C9.

H:7 (PhNH2) +5 (propionyl) =12 H.

O:2.

N:1.

Formula: C9H12NO2.

But the given is C9H11NO2. So one H less.

Hmm. So none of the options match the molecular formula. But that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, maybe the molecular formula for option D is correct. Let me recount.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: O
          ||
O-C-O-Et
|
Ph-NH2

So benzoate ester: the formula would be C7H5O2 (from benzoate) + C2H5O (ethyl) → C9H10O3? Because benzoate is C7H5O2, ethyl is C2H5O. So C7 + C2= C9, H:5 +5=10, O:2 +1=3.

Wait, perhaps that's where I went wrong. So the formula is C9H10O3. But the given is C9H11NO2. No, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula for option D is C9H10O2? How?

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. When esterified with ethanol (C2H5OH), the formula becomes C7H5O2 (benzoate) + C2H5O → C9H10O3. No, that's correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I need to think differently. Since none of the options seem to match the molecular formula, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the structures.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct option is B, and I'm miscalculating the molecular formula.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure: HCONH-Ph-OEt.

Ph-OEt is C8H9O2.

HCONH- adds C1H3NO.

So total C:8+1=9.

H:9 +3=12.

O:2 +1=3.

N:1.

So formula: C9H12NO3. Hmm.

But the given formula is C9H11NO2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options again. Let me list the options and their possible molecular formulas.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide → C9H12NO3.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide → C9H12NO3.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate → C9H12NO2.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate → C9H10NO3.

None match C9H11NO2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the options.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure is PhNH2-COO-CH2CH2CH3.

So, C6 (Ph) + 1 (NH2) +3 (propionate) =10 C? No, wait, Ph is C6, COO adds 2 C, and CH2CH2CH3 adds 3 C? No, COO is part of the propionate, which is CH2CH2COO-. So the propionate is C3H5O2.

So the formula would be C6 (Ph) + C3 (propionate) + N=1.

So C:9.

H: Let's think: PhNH2 is C6H5NH2 → 5 H (Ph) + 2 H (NH2) =7 H.

Propionate: COO-CH2CH2CH3 → which has 7 H (CH2CH2CH3: 2 + 2 +3=7 H).

Plus any H from COO? No, COO is O's.

So total H:7 (PhNH2) +7 (propionate) =14 H. But wait, the propionate is attached as COOCH2CH2CH3, which is CH2CH2CH3 (7 H) plus the COO which doesn't add any H beyond the CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Maybe the correct approach is to realize that only option B fits the NMR data despite the molecular formula discrepancy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the molecular formula calculations. Let me check option D again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Benzoate ester: C7H5O2 (from benzoic acid) + C2H5O (ethyl) → C9H10O3.

But given formula is C9H11NO2. So not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the NMR and IR data, regardless of the formula, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about the options and their structures.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

The structure is O
          ||
H-N-C-O-Ph-OEt.

So the formamide is attached to the phenyl group via the N. The phenyl group has an ethoxy at para.

In this case, the NMR would have the ethoxy group as triplet and quartet (as in the given data), and the formamide NH would be a broad singlet, perhaps around 8-9 ppm. But the given NMR has a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the NH is at 4.0 ppm. But formamide NH is typically around 8 ppm. So perhaps that's not it.

The other signals in the NMR are 1.20 (t), 4.5 (q), which fit the ethoxy group. The aromatic protons as para doublets fit.

The 4.0 ppm (2H, broad) would have to come from something else. But in this structure, the only other protons are from the ethoxy and the aromatic. So maybe the 4.0 ppm is not present, but the given NMR shows it. So perhaps option B isn't correct.

Wait, maybe the 4.0 ppm is from the NH group. But in formamide, the NH is a singlet, perhaps around 8 ppm. Alternatively, if the NH is part of an amide, it could be broader.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should proceed with the best fit based on the NMR and IR.

The IR suggests an ester, so options with ester groups are D and possibly B (but B is formamide, which is an amide). So D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is an ester.

The NMR shows ethoxy quartet and triplet, aromatic protons as para, and a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm which might be NH2.

But the molecular formula doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm miscounting the molecular formula for option D.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Benzoate ester: benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Ester with ethanol is C7H5O2 (since ester replaces -OH with OEt, which is C2H5O).

So molecular formula is C7H5O2 (benzoate) + C2H5O (ethyl) → C9H10O3.

But the given formula is C9H11NO2.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the structure is ethyl 4-aminophenylacetate. No, that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that option D is the correct answer despite the molecular formula discrepancy, but that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B. Let's think about the NMR for option B.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

The structure is O
          ||
H-N-C-O-Ph-OEt.

The ethoxy group is at para on the phenyl. The formamide is attached via N.

In the NMR, the ethoxy would show up as triplet (CH3) at 1.20 ppm and quartet (CH2) at 4.5 ppm. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, integrating to 2H each, at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. So that fits.

The formamide's NH would be a singlet, perhaps around 8-9 ppm, but the given NMR has a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, which doesn't fit.

Wait, but maybe in this structure, there's another group. No, formamide would just have the NH.

So perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from another group. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from the NH group of the formamide, but that's usually upfield. Alternatively, perhaps it's from an OCH2 group, but there's no such group in option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm is from the NH2 group in option D, despite the formula mismatch.

But I'm stuck. I think the best fit based on NMR and IR is option D, but the molecular formula doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the molecular formula calculation.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2.

The molecular formula of each option:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide → C9H12NO3.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide → C9H12NO3.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate → C9H12NO2.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate → C9H10NO3.

None match C9H11NO2. So perhaps the correct option is not among them, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molecular formula. Let me recount option D.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The structure is Ph-O-CO-OEt with NH2 at para.

Ph is C6H5, O-CO-OEt is C3H5O3.

So total C:6 +3=9.

H:5 (Ph) +5 (OEt) =10.

O:3.

N:1.

So formula: C9H10NO3. Not matching.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should proceed with the best fit for the spectral data.

The given NMR fits well with option D, except for the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B, and I'm miscalculating the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given molecular formula is C9H11NO2, which has 9 C, 11 H, 1 N, 2 O.

Looking at option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Propionate is CH2CH2COO-.

So the structure is PhNH2-COO-CH2CH2CH3.

PhNH2 is C6H7N.

Propionate: C3H5O2.

So total C:6+3=9.

H:7 (PhNH2) +5 (propionate) =12 H.

O:2.

N:1.

So formula C9H12NO2. But given is C9H11NO2. So that's one H more. So not matching.

But wait, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the propionate ester is attached differently. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is PhNHCO-OCH2CH2CH3. No, that's not option C.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to go with the best fit based on the spectral data, even if the formula doesn't match perfectly.

Based on the NMR, the ethyl group fits option D, the aromatic protons are para, the IR fits ester. So I'll choose option D.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The compound to identify is **C₉H₁₁NO₂**, with the following spectral data:

### IR Data:

### ¹H NMR Data:
- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: Triplet for a CH₃ group, likely part of an ethyl group.
- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: Broad singlet, possibly an NH₂ group or another deshielded group.
- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: Quartet for a CH₂ group, likely part of an ethyl group attached to an electronegative atom (e.g., oxygen).
- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicative of a **para-substituted benzene ring**.

### Molecular Formula Analysis:
The molecular formula **C₉H₁₁NO₂** corresponds to **5 degrees of unsaturation**, suggesting a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond or ring.

### Option Analysis:
1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  
   - Structure: Benzamide (CONH₂) with an ethoxy group at the meta position.  
   - **IR**: The carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ fits an amide.  
   - **¹H NMR**: The ethoxy group would produce signals similar to the given data, but the aromatic protons would not appear as two doublets (meta substitution).  
   - **Conclusion**: Does not match the NMR data.

2. **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  
   - Structure: Formamide (HCONH) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group.  
   - **IR**: The carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ fits an amide.  
   - **¹H NMR**: The ethoxy group would produce the triplet and quartet observed, and the aromatic protons would appear as two doublets (para substitution). However, the formamide NH would typically appear as a singlet around 8-9 ppm, not at 4.0 ppm.  
   - **Conclusion**: Does not fully match the NMR data.

3. **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**  
   - Structure: Aminophenyl group (NH₂) attached to a propionate ester (CH₂CH₂COO⁻).  
   - **IR**: The carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ fits an ester.  
   - **¹H NMR**: The ethoxy group signals do not match the given data, as the ester would likely involve a propyl group (CH₂CH₂CH₃), not an ethyl group.  
   - **Conclusion**: Does not match the NMR data.

4. **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**  
   - Structure: Benzoate ester (O=C-OEt) with an amino group (NH₂) at the para position.  
   - **IR**: The carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ fits an ester.  
   - **¹H NMR**:  
     - The ethoxy group produces the triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH₃) and quartet at 4.5 ppm (CH₂), consistent with the data.  
     - The aromatic protons appear as two doublets (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm), consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.  
     - The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) could correspond to the NH₂ group, which may be shifted downfield due to the electron-withdrawing ester group.  
   - **Conclusion**: Matches the IR and NMR data.

### Molecular Formula Verification:
- **Option D**: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate has the molecular formula **C₉H₁₀NO₃**, which does not match the given formula **C₉H₁₁NO₂**. Despite this discrepancy, the spectral data strongly support this option.

### Final Answer:
Based on the spectral data, **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** is the best match, even though the molecular formula does not perfectly align.

**Answer: D**

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I have this organic chemistry problem here, and I'm supposed to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking. The compound is C9H11NO2. The data given includes IR and 1H NMR spectra. The options are four different compounds, so I need to match the spectral data with one of them.

First, I'll look at the molecular formula. C9H11NO2. Let me calculate the degree of unsaturation to get an idea of the structure. Degree of unsaturation is (2C +2 - H - X + N)/2. So plugging in: (2*9 +2 -11 -0 +1)/2 = (20-11+1)/2 = 10/2 = 5. So five degrees of unsaturation, which can be rings and double bonds. So probably a benzene ring (which is 4 degrees) and a double bond (maybe a carbonyl group) makes sense.

Looking at the IR data: there are strong bands at 3420 and 3325 cm-1. Those are likely N-H stretches. If it's a primary amine, the N-H would be around 3300-3500, maybe two bands for the two protons. Wait, but the options might have different functional groups. Another big peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong band, probably a carbonyl group. Could be an ester, amide, ketone, etc. But since the options include things like benzamide, formamide, propionate, and benzoate, ester or amide would fit.

Now, the 1H NMR:

- 1.20 ppm, triplet (t), 3H: This looks like a methyl group attached to an oxygen, maybe like an ethyl group. Because ethyl groups have triplet for the CH2CH3, but wait, in this case, the triplet is at 1.20, and coupled to two neighboring H's. So this would be the CH2 group in an ethyl group, where the CH3 is attached to CH2. Wait, no, wait. Wait, in ethyl groups, the CH2CH3 would have the triplet on the CH2? No, wait, the triplet is for the CH2 next to a CH3. So if the triplet is at 1.20, that's the CH2CH3. So the ethyl group is part of the structure.

Then, 4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Broad singlet suggests possibly an NH group, but wait, the integration is 2H. If it's NH2, that would be a broad peak, but maybe it's an OCH2 group? Or perhaps something else. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide NH, but with 2H. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a CH2 group adjacent to something deshielded.

Next, 4.5 ppm, quartet (q), 2H. Quartet would mean coupling with a group that has 3 neighboring H's. Wait, but 2H quartet could be a CH2 adjacent to another CH2. For example, in an ethyl group, the CH2 near the O would be a quartet. Like in an ethyl ester: OCH2CH3. The CH2 next to O would show as quartet because it's next to the CH3, which has 3 H's. So 4.5 ppm quartet, 2H: that looks like an OCH2.

Then, aromatic protons: 7.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 8.0 ppm (d, 2H). This suggests a para-substituted benzene ring. Because the two doublets each have 2H, so two sets of doublets, each integrating to 2H. That's typical for a para-substituted aromatic ring, because the two protons ortho to the substituent would be one doublet, and the other two would be another. Wait, no, actually, in para substitution, the two protons on each adjacent carbon would each couple with each other. So for example, if there's a substituent at position 4, then the protons at 2 and 6 would be one doublet, and 3 and 5 would be another. Or something like that, but the key point is each doublet has two H's, so it's probably a para substitution.

Putting this together: The aromatic region suggests a para-substituted benzene ring, so the substituent is at the para position. Now, the substituent could be an amide group, an ester, an ether, etc., depending on the options.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Structure would be benzamide with ethoxy group at the meta position. Wait, but the substituent is at position 3, which is meta, so the aromatic protons would not be a para arrangement. So probably not this one.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the phenyl group is substituted with an ethoxy at position 4. Then the formamide group (CONH2) would be attached to the N. Wait, but formamide is HCONH2. Wait, but the structure would have the phenyl group attached to the N of the formamide. So the benzene ring is 4-ethoxy, and the formamide is attached to the N. So the structure is O=C(NHPh)NH2? Wait, no, formamide is RCONH2. So in this case, R is 4-ethoxyphenyl, so the structure would be Ph-O-CH2-CH2-NH-C(=O)-H? Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, the formamide is R-NH-C(=O)-H, but more likely, it's N-attached. Wait, maybe it's O=C(NH-Ph-OEt). Hmm, perhaps I should think about the NMR for this.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate. So the structure is PhNH2 attached to a propionyl group. Wait, propionate is CH2CH2COO-? No, wait, propionic acid is CH2CH2COOH. So the propionate would be CH2CH2COO-. But if it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, perhaps it's O=C(O-)CH2CH2NHPh. Wait, but the amino is at position 4. So the structure would be an amino group attached to the benzene ring, and then a propionate group. But I'm not sure how the substituents would affect the NMR.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is benzoate ester, with aminophenyl group. Benzoate ester would be O=C-OCH2CH3, and the amino group is at position 4. So the structure is Ph-NH2 attached to the benzoate ester. Wait, no, the benzoate ester is O=C-OEt, and the amino group is on the benzene ring at the para position. So the benzene would have substituents at positions 4 (NH2) and 1 (OEt), but wait, that would be meta. Wait, no, if the ester is on the benzene ring, and the amino group is para to it. So the substituents are on positions 1 and 4 of the benzene ring. So the benzene has OEt and NH2 at the para positions. So the structure would be ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is OEt attached to the carbonyl, which is attached to the benzene ring that has an amino group at the para position.

Now, considering the NMR data. Let's go option by option.

Looking at the 1H NMR.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The structure would be:

O
||
O-C-OEt
|
Ph-NH2

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, the benzoate ester is OEt-O-CO-Ph, with the Ph having NH2 at the para position. So the structure is OEt-O-CO-Ph-NH2, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the ester is OEt attached to the carbonyl, which is attached to the benzene ring. The benzene ring has an amino group at the para position relative to the ester group.

So the structure is:

Ph-O-CO-OEt, but wait, no. The ester is O-CO-OEt, but attached to the benzene. Wait, no, the benzoate ester is OEt-O-CO-Ph. So the ester is OEt-O-CO-Ph, and the Ph has an NH2 group in the para position to the ester.

So the substituents on the benzene are O-CO-OEt and NH2 at para positions.

Now, back to the NMR.

The ethyl group: the OCH2CH3 would split into quartet and triplet. The ethyl ester group usually shows the CH2 next to O as quartet around 4.1-4.3 ppm, and the CH3 as triplet around 1.2-1.4 ppm. In the given NMR, the triplet is at 1.20 ppm (3H), and quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H). So in the structure, the ethyl group is split into CH2CH3, where the CH2 is attached to O. So that fits with the quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) and triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H). So that's the ethyl group from the ester.

Now, the aromatic protons: the para substitution would lead to two doublets, each integrating to 2H. So that matches the NMR given.

What about the other signals? The 4.0 ppm, broad singlet, 2H. Hmm. If the structure is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, then the NH2 group would be on the benzene. But the NH2 protons are usually broad, but in this case, the broad singlet is 2H. Wait, NH2 is normally two protons, but their signals are usually broad and might split into a singlet if they're not near any other protons. Wait, but in aniline derivatives, the NH2 protons are typically broad, but in D, the amine is attached to the benzene ring, so it's a para-aminobenzoate.

Wait, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet integrating for 2H. So that could be the NH2 protons. Because in aniline, the NH2 is usually around 5-6 ppm, but if it's de-shielded, maybe it's at 4.0. Alternatively, maybe it's another group.

Wait, but another possibility: the 4.0 ppm could be an OCH2 group, but that would more likely be a quartet. Alternatively, maybe it's an amide NH, but since the structure is an ester, not an amide, that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is the NH group in a different part.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm isn't the NH2 group. Let me think. Maybe the structure is different. Let's consider option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure: O
         ||
H-N-C-O-Ph-OEt

Wait, the formamide would be HCONH-Ph-OEt. So the N is connected to the formamide carbonyl and the phenyl group. The ethoxy is at the para position of the phenyl.

In that case, the aromatic protons would be at 7 and 8 ppm, similar to the given data. The ethoxy group would show up as the triplet and quartet as well.

But what about the other signals? The 4.0 ppm, broad singlet (2H). Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the NH is present. Formamide usually has NH protons. But in this case, formamide is HCONHR, where R is 4-ethoxyphenyl. So the NH would be a singlet, perhaps around 8-9 ppm if it's exchanging, but broad. Alternatively, maybe it's split into a different peak.

Wait, in the given NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet (2H). So perhaps this is from something else.

Alternatively, looking at the IR data: strong band at 1720 cm-1. Which could be ester or amide carbonyl.

If it's an ester, the carbonyl is around 1720, which fits. If it's an amide, the carbonyl would be around 1650-1700, perhaps. But the given IR has 1720, so ester is more likely.

So, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is an ester. So the carbonyl is around 1720, which matches the IR.

In that structure, the NH2 is on the benzene ring. The NH2 protons would typically appear as a broad signal. So in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm (broad singlet, 2H) could be the NH2 group. But wait, aniline protons are usually around 5-6 ppm. If it's an amino group in a more deshielded environment, perhaps it's shifted downfield. Alternatively, maybe it's not the NH2. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group that's part of another substituent. Wait, but in option D, the substituents are OEt and NH2 on the benzene. So the OCH2CH3 is from the ethyl ester, which we've accounted for in the 1.20 ppm triplet and 4.5 ppm quartet.

So the 4.0 ppm (2H, broad) is left. Maybe it's an NH group. Wait, the amino group is NH2, which would be two protons. So in that case, maybe it's those protons. But why are they at 4.0? Maybe the amine is in a different environment, perhaps hindered, or de-shielded.

Alternatively, maybe the 4.0 ppm is from an NH adjacent to an oxygen, perhaps an amide. But in option D, it's a benzoate ester, not an amide.

Wait, another option to think about: option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

In that case, the structure would be HCONH-Ph-OEt, with the ethoxy at para. The formamide would have NH protons. So the NH would be a singlet, perhaps around 8-9 ppm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the NH could be split, but that's less likely. 

In the NMR, the 4.0 ppm (2H, broad) would have to account for something else. Maybe an oxygenated CH2 group? But in the structure, the ethoxy is at the para position, so the OCH2CH3 would be the triplet and quartet we saw. So perhaps the 4.0 is another group.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is the NH group of the formamide, but that seems a bit high. Formamide NH's are usually around 8 ppm, but can vary.

Wait, another approach: let's think about the functional groups. The IR shows a strong peak at 1720, which suggests an ester carbonyl. So the compound is likely an ester. So options D and C (propionate) could be esters, perhaps. Wait, option C is 4-aminophenyl propionate. Propionate would be CH2CH2COO-. So the structure would be PhNH2COOCH2CH2CH3? Or PhNH2 attached to a propionyl group. Wait, no, it's 4-aminophenyl propionate, which would be CH2CH2COO- attached to the phenyl with amino group.

Wait, but the IR shows a carbonyl at 1720, which is typical for esters. So if option C is a propionate (ester), then the carbonyl would be around 1720. So that would fit.

Wait, but the NMR for option C would have a different structure. Let's think: 4-aminophenyl propionate is PhNH2 attached to a propionate ester. So the structure would be PhNH2-COO-R, where R is CH2CH2CH3. So the propionyl group would be CH2CH2COO-R.

In that case, the propionate group would contribute a triplet for the CH2 next to the ester oxygen. So the ester would be OCO-CH2CH2CH3. But in the NMR, the quartet is at 4.5 ppm, which would be from the OCH2 group (if it's an ester like OCO-CH2CH2CH3), but that would have a triplet for the CH2 near the ester O. Wait, no, for a propionate ester, the structure would be O-CO-O-CH2CH2CH3. Wait, no, the ester is O-CO-O-R. So R is CH2CH2CH3. So the OCH2CH2CH3 would have a triplet for the CH2 next to O (if the R is CH2CH2CH3), but wait, the structure OCH2CH2CH3 would have the CH2 next to O as a quartet, but that's not matching the given NMR.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. For an ethyl ester (OCH2CH3), the CH2 next to O is a quartet (coupled with the CH3), and the CH3 is a triplet. So in the NMR, 4.5 ppm (q, 2H) would be the OCH2, and 1.20 ppm (t, 3H) the CH3.

In option C, the ester would be a propyl group: OCH2CH2CH3. So the OCH2 would be a quartet (since it's next to a CH2 with 2 H's?), wait no, wait OCH2CH2CH3 would have the OCH2 as a quartet because it's next to CH2CH3. Wait, no, actually, in OCH2CH2CH3, the OCH2 is adjacent to a CH2 with two H's, which would cause a triplet. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Let's think about the splitting.

In ethyl ester (OCH2CH3): the CH2 is next to a CH3 with 3 H's, so the CH2 is a quartet. The CH3 is a triplet because it's next to the CH2, which has 2 H's.

In propyl ester (OCH2CH2CH3): the CH2 next to O is attached to another CH2, which is attached to CH3. So the OCH2 would be a quartet (coupled with the adjacent CH2), and the middle CH2 would be a triplet (coupled with both OCH2 and CH3). The CH3 would be a triplet as well, but that's in a different part.

Wait, but in the given NMR, we have a quartet at 4.5 ppm (2H) and triplet at 1.20 ppm (3H). That fits the ethyl group, which suggests that the ester is ethyl, not propyl. So options with ethyl ester would fit.

So looking back, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which would have OCH2CH3 as the ester group, matching the NMR.

So then, the 4.0 ppm (2H, broad) must be something else. If the structure is D, ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the substituents on benzene are OEt (ester) and NH2 (para). So the NH2 protons would typically be a broad peak. Let's think about their chemical shift.

In aniline derivatives, the NH2 protons are usually around 5-6 ppm. But in some cases, they can be shifted downfield or upfield. If the amino group is para to an electron-withdrawing group like ester, it might be more deshielded, causing the NH2 protons to appear downfield. So perhaps around 4.0 ppm? That's possible, but it's a bit lower than usual.

Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from another group. Let me think about the other options again.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide. So the structure is O
                                      |
H-N-C=O attached to the phenyl group with OEt at para.

So the NMR would have: the ethoxy group as triplet and quartet (like in option D). The formamide NH would be a singlet, perhaps around 8-9 ppm, but it's a broad peak. But in the given NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad singlet, which would not fit that. So perhaps that's not the case.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide. Benzamide has a CONH2 group attached to the benzene. So the structure would be Ph-OCH2CH3 (meta) and CONH2. The NH2 would be around 8 ppm, but in the NMR, the 4.0 ppm is a broad, which doesn't match.

So putting it all together, the best fit seems to be option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. The IR matches the ester carbonyl, the ethyl group matches the NMR triplet and quartet, the aromatic protons are para-substituted, and the 4.0 ppm might be the NH2 group, perhaps shifted downfield due to the electron-withdrawing ester group.

Wait, but another thought: in ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, the amino group is on the benzene ring, but the ester is also on the ring. So the structure would be O=C-OEt attached to the benzene, which has an NH2 group at the para position.

So the aromatic protons would be at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm as doublets, which matches the NMR. The ethyl ester gives the triplet and quartet. Then the NH2 would give a broad peak. But why is that at 4.0 ppm? Wait, maybe it's not the NH2 but something else. Alternatively, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is an OCH2 group from another substituent. But in this structure, the substituents are OEt and NH2, so that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: the 4.0 ppm is the NH in an amide. But in option D, it's an ester, not an amide. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again about the options.

Wait, option D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate. So the structure is:

O
||
O-C-O-Et
|
Ph-NH2

Wait, no, the structure is benzoate ester, so it's Ph-C(=O)-O-Et, and the Ph has an NH2 group at the para position. So the structure is:

Ph-O-C(=O)-O-Et with NH2 at the para position of the benzene.

Wait, no, that's not correct. The structure is OEt-O-C(=O)-Ph, with the Ph group having an NH2 at the para position.

So the substituents on the benzene are at positions 1 (ester) and 4 (NH2). So the ring has O-CO-OEt and NH2 at opposite positions.

Now, the NH2 group would be adjacent to the carbonyl group, which is electron-withdrawing. The NH2 is a strong activating group, while the ester is deactivating. So the ring would have an NH2 and an ester group in para positions.

The 1H NMR shows a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H). If it's the NH2, that's possible if the protons are split or shifted. Alternatively, maybe it's not NH2 but another group. Wait, but the molecular formula has one N. So the N in option D is in the NH2 group and the ester group.

Wait, the molecular formula is C9H11NO2. Let's count for option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: benzoate means C7H5O2 (benzoic acid is C7H6O2, but as the ester, it's C7H5O2). The ethyl ester adds C2H5, so total is C9H10O2. But wait, the formula is C9H11NO2.

Wait, so that doesn't fit. Wait, benzoic acid is C7H6O2. When esterified with ethanol, it becomes C9H10O2. But the formula given is C9H11NO2. So we have one more N and one more H.

Ah, that's a problem. So option D has a molecular formula of C9H10O2, but the question is C9H11NO2. So that can't be right. Did I count wrong?

Wait, let me calculate. Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Ester with ethanol (C2H5OH) would replace the -OH with O-C2H5. So the ester would be C7H5O2 + C2H5O. So molecular formula becomes C9H10O2. But the given formula is C9H11NO2, which has one more N and one more H.

Hmm, so option D doesn't fit the molecular formula. So that rules out D.

Wait, what about option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Formamide is HCONH2. If it's substituted with 4-ethoxyphenyl, the structure is HCONH-Ph-OEt. So the molecular formula would be:

Ph: C6H5
OEt: C2H5O
Formamide: HCONH- (so adds C=O, NH, and H)

So the formula is C6H5-CO-NH-C2H5O.

Wait, let's compute:

Ph (C6H5) + OEt (C2H5O) + formamide (HCONH-):

C: 6 + 2 + 1 (from CO) =9
H: 5 (from Ph) +5 (from OEt) + (HCONH: 2 H from NH and 1 from CO? Wait, perhaps I should count each part.

Ph is C6H5.

OEt is OCH2CH3: adding 2 C and 7 H (O is not counted as C).

Formamide is HCONH-: HCONH- has formula C=O-NH-, which is C1H1N1O1.

So combining:

C6 (Ph) + 2 (OEt) +1 (formamide) =9 C.

H: 5 (Ph) + 7 (OEt) + 2 (HCONH, the H from CO and NH?) Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Alternatively, the molecular formula of N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide would be:

Ph-OEt: C6H5-OCH2CH3 → C8H9O2.

Formamide part: HCONH-Ph-OEt.

So HCONH- is C=O-NH-, so adding that gives C9H10N O2?

Wait, let me think: HCONH-Ph-OEt.

Ph-OEt is C6H5-O-C2H5 → molecular formula C8H11O2.

Adding HCONH: which is C1H2NO.

So total: C8+1=9, H:11+2=13? Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I should just compute the molecular formula.

Each group:

Ph-OEt: C6H5-OCH2CH3 → C8H9O2.

Formamide part: HCONH- → HCONH-R. So HCONH-R would be (HCO) (NH-R). So molecular formula would be:

Ph-OEt: C8H9O2.

HCONH- adds CO, NH, and H.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to count all atoms:

Ph-OEt: C6H5-O-C2H5 → C6 + C2 = C8; H:5 (Ph) +5 (OEt) =10, plus O2.

Formamide: HCONH- → HCONH is C1H3N1O1.

So when combined as HCONH-Ph-OEt:

C: 6 (Ph) + 2 (OEt) +1 (CO) =9 C.

H: 5 (Ph) +5 (OEt) +3 (HCONH) =13 H.

O: 2 (Ph-O) +1 (CO) +1 (OEt) =4 O? No, wait, the O in the formamide is part of the CO, and the O in the ester is from the OEt. So perhaps O count is:

Formamide CO: 1 O.

Ph-OEt: 2 O (the O in Ph-O and the O in OEt? No, the OEt is OCH2CH3, which is one O. So total O: 2 (Ph-O and OEt) +1 (CO) =3 O.

Wait, but the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2.

Wait, our count for option B's formula would be C9H13N O3? That seems off. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Alternatively, let me compute the molecular formula for each option:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Benzamide is PhCONH2. So 3-ethoxy would be OCH2CH3 attached at position 3.

Molecular formula: Ph (C6H5) + CONH2 (C1H2N O) + OCH2CH3 (C2H5O).

So C:6 +1 +2=9.

H:5 (Ph) +2 (CONH2) +5 (OCH2CH3) + any H from substituents.

Wait, the OCH2CH3 adds 5 H (CH2CH3 has 3 H in CH3 and 2 in CH2?), but wait, OCH2CH3 has 5 H? No, OCH2CH3 is CH2CH3O- attached to the ring. So the CH2 has 2 H, CH3 has 3 H. So OCH2CH3 has 5 H.

So total H: 5 (Ph) +2 (CONH2) +5 (OCH2CH3) + any other H? Benzamide is PhCONH2, which has H on the NH2. So that's 2 H.

So total H:5 (Ph) +5 (OCH2CH3) + 2 (CONH2) =12 H. Plus any from the substituents? No. So C9H12NO2.

But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So option A would have C9H12NO2, which is one H more than needed. So option A is not the correct formula.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Formamide is HCONH-R. R is 4-ethoxyphenyl.

So molecular formula:

Ph-OEt is C8H9O2.

HCONH adds C=O and NH.

So C: 8 (Ph-OEt) +1 (HCO) +1 (NH) → wait, HCONH is C1H2NO.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think:

Ph-OEt: C6H5-OCH2CH3 → C8H9O2.

HCONH-Ph-OEt: C1H3NO attached to C8H9O2.

So total C:8+1=9.

H:9 (from Ph-OEt) +3 (from HCONH) =12 H.

O:2 (from Ph-OEt) +1 (from HCONH) =3 O.

Wait, but the given formula is C9H11NO2. So option B would be C9H12NO3, which doesn't match. So that's not correct.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me check option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Propionate is CH2CH2COO-.

So the structure is PhNH2-COO-CH2CH2CH3.

Molecular formula: Ph is C6H5, NH2 adds 1N and 2H. COO- adds 2O and 2C (from COO-), and CH2CH2CH3 adds 3C and 7H.

So total:

C:6 (Ph) +1 (NH2) +2 (COO) +3 (CH2CH2CH3) =12 C? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, the structure is PhNH2-COO-(CH2)2CH3.

Wait, the propionate is CH2CH2COO-. Wait, the correct formula for propionate is C3H5O2^-.

Wait, let me compute:

PhNH2: C6H5NH2 → C6H7N.

Propionate: C3H5O2^-.

So combining, the formula is C6 + C3 = C9, H:7 +5=12, N:1, O:2.

But the given formula is C9H11NO2. So option C would be C9H12N O2, which has one more H than needed. So that's not matching.

Wait, but maybe I'm not counting correctly. Let me think again.

PhNH2-COO-R where R is CH2CH2CH3.

So PhNH2 is C6H5NH2 → C6H7N.

COO-R: R is CH2CH2CH3 → C3H7.

So COO-R is C3H7O2.

So overall, C6 + C3 = C9, H:7 (PhNH2) +7 (COO-R) =14 H. Plus any from the COO? Wait, no, the COO is part of the propionate. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the molecular formula for each option.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Benzoate is C7H5O2^- (from benzoic acid, C7H6O2, losing one H to form the ester).

Ester with ethyl: so the ester would be C7H5O2 + C2H5O → C9H10O2.

But the formula is C9H11NO2. So that's one more N and one more H than option D. So option D's formula is C9H10O2, but given is C9H11NO2. So that doesn't match.

Hmm, none of the options seem to match the molecular formula. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, let me compute the molecular formula for each option again.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide.

Structure: Ph-OCH2CH3 (at position 3) and CONH2.

Ph is C6H5. OCH2CH3 is C2H5O. CONH2 is C1H2NO2.

Wait, so C:6 +2 +1 =9.

H:5 (Ph) +5 (OCH2CH3) +2 (CONH2) =12.

O: 1 (OCH2CH3) +2 (CONH2) =3.

N:1.

So formula: C9H12NO3.

But given formula is C9H11NO2. So no match.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure: HCONH-Ph-OEt.

Ph-OEt is C8H9O2.

HCONH adds C1H3N O.

So C:8 +1=9.

H:9 +3=12.

O:2 +1=3.

N:1.

So formula: C9H12NO3. Again, doesn't match.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Structure: PhNH2-COO-CH2CH2CH3.

PhNH2 is C6H7N.

Propionate is C3H5O2.

So total C:6 +3=9.

H:7 +5=12.

O:2.

N:1.

So formula: C9H12NO2. But given is C9H11NO2. So one H less.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: Ph-O-CO-OEt with NH2 at para.

Ph-O-CO-OEt: Ph is C6H5, O-CO-OEt is C3H5O3.

So C:6 +3=9.

H:5 (Ph) +5 (OEt) =10.

O:3.

N:1.

So formula: C9H10NO3. Which again doesn't match.

Wait, none of the options match the given molecular formula. Did I make a mistake in counting?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The given formula is C9H11NO2.

So we're looking for a structure with 9 C, 11 H, 1 N, 2 O.

Looking at each option:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide → C9H12NO3. No.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide → C9H12NO3. No.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate → C9H12NO2. Close, but has 12 H.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate → C9H10NO3. No.

Wait, then maybe I'm miscalculating option C.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Structure: PhNH2 attached to a propionyl group (CH2CH2COO-).

So the formula would be:

PhNH2: C6H7N.

Propionyl: C3H5O2.

So combining: C6 + C3 = C9.

H:7 (PhNH2) +5 (propionyl) =12 H.

O:2.

N:1.

Formula: C9H12NO2.

But the given is C9H11NO2. So one H less.

Hmm. So none of the options match the molecular formula. But that can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting.

Wait, maybe the molecular formula for option D is correct. Let me recount.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Structure: O
          ||
O-C-O-Et
|
Ph-NH2

So benzoate ester: the formula would be C7H5O2 (from benzoate) + C2H5O (ethyl) → C9H10O3? Because benzoate is C7H5O2, ethyl is C2H5O. So C7 + C2= C9, H:5 +5=10, O:2 +1=3.

Wait, perhaps that's where I went wrong. So the formula is C9H10O3. But the given is C9H11NO2. No, that's not matching.

Wait, perhaps the molecular formula for option D is C9H10O2? How?

Benzoic acid is C7H6O2. When esterified with ethanol (C2H5OH), the formula becomes C7H5O2 (benzoate) + C2H5O → C9H10O3. No, that's correct.

Hmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I need to think differently. Since none of the options seem to match the molecular formula, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the structures.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the correct option is B, and I'm miscalculating the molecular formula.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

Structure: HCONH-Ph-OEt.

Ph-OEt is C8H9O2.

HCONH- adds C1H3NO.

So total C:8+1=9.

H:9 +3=12.

O:2 +1=3.

N:1.

So formula: C9H12NO3. Hmm.

But the given formula is C9H11NO2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the options again. Let me list the options and their possible molecular formulas.

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide → C9H12NO3.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide → C9H12NO3.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate → C9H12NO2.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate → C9H10NO3.

None match C9H11NO2. So perhaps I made a mistake in the options.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Propionate is CH2CH2COO-. So the structure is PhNH2-COO-CH2CH2CH3.

So, C6 (Ph) + 1 (NH2) +3 (propionate) =10 C? No, wait, Ph is C6, COO adds 2 C, and CH2CH2CH3 adds 3 C? No, COO is part of the propionate, which is CH2CH2COO-. So the propionate is C3H5O2.

So the formula would be C6 (Ph) + C3 (propionate) + N=1.

So C:9.

H: Let's think: PhNH2 is C6H5NH2 → 5 H (Ph) + 2 H (NH2) =7 H.

Propionate: COO-CH2CH2CH3 → which has 7 H (CH2CH2CH3: 2 + 2 +3=7 H).

Plus any H from COO? No, COO is O's.

So total H:7 (PhNH2) +7 (propionate) =14 H. But wait, the propionate is attached as COOCH2CH2CH3, which is CH2CH2CH3 (7 H) plus the COO which doesn't add any H beyond the CH2 groups.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Maybe the correct approach is to realize that only option B fits the NMR data despite the molecular formula discrepancy.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the molecular formula calculations. Let me check option D again.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Benzoate ester: C7H5O2 (from benzoic acid) + C2H5O (ethyl) → C9H10O3.

But given formula is C9H11NO2. So not matching.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the NMR and IR data, regardless of the formula, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should think again about the options and their structures.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

The structure is O
          ||
H-N-C-O-Ph-OEt.

So the formamide is attached to the phenyl group via the N. The phenyl group has an ethoxy at para.

In this case, the NMR would have the ethoxy group as triplet and quartet (as in the given data), and the formamide NH would be a broad singlet, perhaps around 8-9 ppm. But the given NMR has a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, which doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the NH is at 4.0 ppm. But formamide NH is typically around 8 ppm. So perhaps that's not it.

The other signals in the NMR are 1.20 (t), 4.5 (q), which fit the ethoxy group. The aromatic protons as para doublets fit.

The 4.0 ppm (2H, broad) would have to come from something else. But in this structure, the only other protons are from the ethoxy and the aromatic. So maybe the 4.0 ppm is not present, but the given NMR shows it. So perhaps option B isn't correct.

Wait, maybe the 4.0 ppm is from the NH group. But in formamide, the NH is a singlet, perhaps around 8 ppm. Alternatively, if the NH is part of an amide, it could be broader.

Hmm. I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should proceed with the best fit based on the NMR and IR.

The IR suggests an ester, so options with ester groups are D and possibly B (but B is formamide, which is an amide). So D is ethyl 4-aminobenzoate, which is an ester.

The NMR shows ethoxy quartet and triplet, aromatic protons as para, and a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm which might be NH2.

But the molecular formula doesn't match. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm miscounting the molecular formula for option D.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

Benzoate ester: benzoic acid is C7H6O2. Ester with ethanol is C7H5O2 (since ester replaces -OH with OEt, which is C2H5O).

So molecular formula is C7H5O2 (benzoate) + C2H5O (ethyl) → C9H10O3.

But the given formula is C9H11NO2.

Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the structure is ethyl 4-aminophenylacetate. No, that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that option D is the correct answer despite the molecular formula discrepancy, but that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the correct option is B. Let's think about the NMR for option B.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide.

The structure is O
          ||
H-N-C-O-Ph-OEt.

The ethoxy group is at para on the phenyl. The formamide is attached via N.

In the NMR, the ethoxy would show up as triplet (CH3) at 1.20 ppm and quartet (CH2) at 4.5 ppm. The aromatic protons would be two doublets, integrating to 2H each, at 7.0 and 8.0 ppm. So that fits.

The formamide's NH would be a singlet, perhaps around 8-9 ppm, but the given NMR has a broad singlet at 4.0 ppm, which doesn't fit.

Wait, but maybe in this structure, there's another group. No, formamide would just have the NH.

So perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from another group. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is different.

Wait, perhaps the 4.0 ppm is from the NH group of the formamide, but that's usually upfield. Alternatively, perhaps it's from an OCH2 group, but there's no such group in option B.

Alternatively, perhaps the broad singlet at 4.0 ppm is from the NH2 group in option D, despite the formula mismatch.

But I'm stuck. I think the best fit based on NMR and IR is option D, but the molecular formula doesn't match. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the molecular formula calculation.

Wait, another approach: the molecular formula given is C9H11NO2.

The molecular formula of each option:

Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide → C9H12NO3.

Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide → C9H12NO3.

Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate → C9H12NO2.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate → C9H10NO3.

None match C9H11NO2. So perhaps the correct option is not among them, but that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molecular formula. Let me recount option D.

Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate.

The structure is Ph-O-CO-OEt with NH2 at para.

Ph is C6H5, O-CO-OEt is C3H5O3.

So total C:6 +3=9.

H:5 (Ph) +5 (OEt) =10.

O:3.

N:1.

So formula: C9H10NO3. Not matching.

Hmm. I'm really stuck here. Maybe I should proceed with the best fit for the spectral data.

The given NMR fits well with option D, except for the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is option B, and I'm miscalculating the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the given molecular formula is C9H11NO2, which has 9 C, 11 H, 1 N, 2 O.

Looking at option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate.

Propionate is CH2CH2COO-.

So the structure is PhNH2-COO-CH2CH2CH3.

PhNH2 is C6H7N.

Propionate: C3H5O2.

So total C:6+3=9.

H:7 (PhNH2) +5 (propionate) =12 H.

O:2.

N:1.

So formula C9H12NO2. But given is C9H11NO2. So that's one H more. So not matching.

But wait, perhaps the structure is different. Maybe the propionate ester is attached differently. Alternatively, perhaps the structure is PhNHCO-OCH2CH2CH3. No, that's not option C.

Hmm. I'm not making progress. I think I'll have to go with the best fit based on the spectral data, even if the formula doesn't match perfectly.

Based on the NMR, the ethyl group fits option D, the aromatic protons are para, the IR fits ester. So I'll choose option D.


The compound to identify is **C₉H₁₁NO₂**, with the following spectral data:

### IR Data:
- Medium to strong intensity bands at **3420 cm⁻¹** and **3325 cm⁻¹**: Likely N-H stretches.
- Strong band at **1720 cm⁻¹**: Indicates a carbonyl group, likely an ester or amide.

### ¹H NMR Data:
- **1.20 ppm (t, 3H)**: Triplet for a CH₃ group, likely part of an ethyl group.
- **4.0 ppm (bs, 2H)**: Broad singlet, possibly an NH₂ group or another deshielded group.
- **4.5 ppm (q, 2H)**: Quartet for a CH₂ group, likely part of an ethyl group attached to an electronegative atom (e.g., oxygen).
- **7.0 ppm (d, 2H)** and **8.0 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, indicative of a **para-substituted benzene ring**.

### Molecular Formula Analysis:
The molecular formula **C₉H₁₁NO₂** corresponds to **5 degrees of unsaturation**, suggesting a benzene ring (4 degrees) and one additional double bond or ring.

### Option Analysis:
1. **Option A: 3-ethoxybenzamide**  
   - Structure: Benzamide (CONH₂) with an ethoxy group at the meta position.  
   - **IR**: The carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ fits an amide.  
   - **¹H NMR**: The ethoxy group would produce signals similar to the given data, but the aromatic protons would not appear as two doublets (meta substitution).  
   - **Conclusion**: Does not match the NMR data.

2. **Option B: N-(4-ethoxyphenyl)formamide**  
   - Structure: Formamide (HCONH) attached to a 4-ethoxyphenyl group.  
   - **IR**: The carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ fits an amide.  
   - **¹H NMR**: The ethoxy group would produce the triplet and quartet observed, and the aromatic protons would appear as two doublets (para substitution). However, the formamide NH would typically appear as a singlet around 8-9 ppm, not at 4.0 ppm.  
   - **Conclusion**: Does not fully match the NMR data.

3. **Option C: 4-aminophenyl propionate**  
   - Structure: Aminophenyl group (NH₂) attached to a propionate ester (CH₂CH₂COO⁻).  
   - **IR**: The carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ fits an ester.  
   - **¹H NMR**: The ethoxy group signals do not match the given data, as the ester would likely involve a propyl group (CH₂CH₂CH₃), not an ethyl group.  
   - **Conclusion**: Does not match the NMR data.

4. **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate**  
   - Structure: Benzoate ester (O=C-OEt) with an amino group (NH₂) at the para position.  
   - **IR**: The carbonyl stretch at 1720 cm⁻¹ fits an ester.  
   - **¹H NMR**:  
     - The ethoxy group produces the triplet at 1.20 ppm (CH₃) and quartet at 4.5 ppm (CH₂), consistent with the data.  
     - The aromatic protons appear as two doublets (7.0 ppm and 8.0 ppm), consistent with a para-substituted benzene ring.  
     - The broad singlet at 4.0 ppm (2H) could correspond to the NH₂ group, which may be shifted downfield due to the electron-withdrawing ester group.  
   - **Conclusion**: Matches the IR and NMR data.

### Molecular Formula Verification:
- **Option D**: Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate has the molecular formula **C₉H₁₀NO₃**, which does not match the given formula **C₉H₁₁NO₂**. Despite this discrepancy, the spectral data strongly support this option.

### Final Answer:
Based on the spectral data, **Option D: ethyl 4-aminobenzoate** is the best match, even though the molecular formula does not perfectly align.

**Answer: D**
