Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that the system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, is that a 3-dimensional vector? Because the matrix for operator P is 3x3. So the state is a column vector with three elements: -1, 2, 1. But wait, quantum states are usually represented as vectors with unit norm. So I should check if this vector is normalized. Let me compute the magnitude squared: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so it's not normalized. So the state vector isn't a unit vector. That might complicate things, but maybe I can normalize it later or see if it's required.

The operators P and Q are given as matrices. For P, the matrix is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

And for Q, the matrix is diagonal:
Row 1: 1, 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, -1

The question is about measuring P and then Q. We need the probability of getting 0 when measuring P and -1 when measuring Q.

Wait, no, the question says someone measures Q just after measuring P. So the order is P first, then Q. We're to find the probability of getting P=0 and Q=-1.

Wait, no, wait. The wording is a bit unclear. It says, "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So, the measurements are done in the order P first, then Q. So the probability is the same as: first, measure P and get 0, then measure Q and get -1.

But in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So after measuring P=0, the state would be the projection onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, measuring Q on this new state would give -1 with some probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the state after P is measured is the eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to approach this by considering the possible outcomes step by step.

First, find the possible eigenvalues of P and their corresponding eigenvectors. Then, compute the probability of getting 0 when measuring P. Then, for the state that results after this measurement, compute the probability of getting Q=-1.

But wait, perhaps I should first compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

Alternatively, since Q is diagonal, its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. So measuring Q gives 1, 0, or -1.

But let me approach this step by step.

First, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P.

Operator P matrix:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, okay, so I can write P as a matrix:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of (P - λ I) = 0.

So, the characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

Let's write the matrix P - λ I:

Row 1: [ -λ, 1/√2 , 0 ]

Row 2: [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]

Row 3: [0, 1/√2, -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix must be zero.

Calculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be tedious, but perhaps there's symmetry here that can be exploited.

Alternatively, maybe P has some known structure. Let's see.

Perhaps P is a symmetric matrix, which it is (since P is a Hermitian operator, which is necessary for observables). So yes, P is Hermitian.

But maybe it's easier to look for eigenvectors and eigenvalues by inspection.

Looking for eigenvectors:

Let's assume a vector v = [a, b, c]^T.

We have P v = λ v.

So, according to the first row:

0*a + (1/√2) b + 0*c = λ a → (1/√2) b = λ a → b = λ a * sqrt(2)

Second row: (1/√2) a + 0*b + (1/√2) c = λ b → (a + c)/sqrt(2) = λ b.

Third row: 0*a + (1/√2) b + 0*c = λ c → (1/√2) b = λ c → b = λ c * sqrt(2).

Hmm, from first and third equations: b = λ a sqrt(2) = λ c sqrt(2). So, if λ is not zero, then a = c.

From the second equation: (a + c)/sqrt(2) = λ b. Since a = c, this becomes 2a/sqrt(2) = λ b. Simplify 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2), so sqrt(2) a = lambda b.

But from the first equation, b = lambda a sqrt(2), so substitute this into the second equation:

sqrt(2) a = lambda * [lambda a sqrt(2) ]

So sqrt(2) a = lambda^2 a sqrt(2) )

Assuming a ≠ 0 (since if a=0, then from b= lambda a sqrt(2), b=0, and from third equation, c=0, so the trivial solution), so we can divide both sides by a sqrt(2):

1 = lambda^2 → lambda = ±1.

Wait, so the eigenvalues are 1 and -1? But wait, since the trace of P is 0 (trace is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0), the sum of eigenvalues is zero. So if eigenvalues are 1 and -1, then we must have another eigenvalue, perhaps 0. Or maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let's check the trace. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. For P, the diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

If I get eigenvalues as 1, -1, and 0, because 1 + (-1) +0=0, that would make sense. So that's likely.

So let's consider lambda =1, lambda=-1, and lambda=0.

Wait, let's go back. When I assumed a ≠0, but perhaps there's another case when a=0. Let me try that.

Case 1: a=0.

From first equation, b = lambda * 0 * sqrt(2) → b=0.

Third equation: (1/√2) b = lambda c → 0 = lambda c.

So either lambda=0 or c=0.

If lambda=0, then from the second equation: (0 + c)/sqrt(2) = 0 * b → c/sqrt(2)=0 → c=0. So the vector is [0,0,0], which is trivial. So non-trivial solution must have lambda=0 and c can be non-zero? Wait, no: if lambda=0, then from third equation, (1/√2) b=0 → b=0, and from first equation, b=0. So c can be anything, but from the second equation, (a + c)/sqrt(2) = 0 → a + c =0. But a is zero, so c=0. So no non-trivial solution here.

So, perhaps lambda=0 is an eigenvalue. Let's see.

Assume lambda=0.

Then, from the first equation: (1/√2) b = 0 → b=0.

Third equation: (1/√2) b = 0 → b=0.

Second equation: (a + c)/sqrt(2) =0 → a = -c.

So, the eigenvector must satisfy a = -c, and b=0.

Thus, any vector of the form (a, 0, -a) would be an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

So, for example, [1, 0, -1]^T is an eigenvector for lambda=0.

So, that's the eigenvector for lambda=0.

Now, back to the case where lambda^2 =1 → lambda=1 or lambda=-1.

Case 2: lambda=1.

From first equation: b = 1 * a * sqrt(2) → b = a√2.

From third equation: b = 1 * c * sqrt(2) → c = b/(sqrt(2)) = (a√2)/sqrt(2) )= a.

So, c = a.

From the second equation: (a + c)/sqrt(2) = 1 * b → (a + a)/sqrt(2) = b → (2a)/sqrt(2) = b → sqrt(2) a = b.

But from first equation, b= a√2 → which is the same as sqrt(2) a. So that's consistent.

So the eigenvector for lambda=1 is proportional to [a, a√2, a]^T. Choosing a=1, we get v = [1, sqrt(2), 1]^T.

Wait, but let's check if this is correct.

Wait, [1, sqrt(2), 1]^T.

Multiply by P:

P * v = ?

Row 1: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) + 0*1 = (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) )= 1.

Row 2: (1/sqrt(2)) *1 + 0 * sqrt(2) + (1/sqrt(2)) *1 = (1/sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2)) )= 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

Row 3: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) + 0 *1 = (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2)) =1.

So P*v would be [1, sqrt(2), 1]^T, which is v multiplied by 1. So yes, P*v =1 *v. So that's correct.

Similarly, for lambda=-1:

From first equation: b = (-1) *a * sqrt(2) → b = -a√2.

From third equation: b = (-1) * c * sqrt(2) → c = b/( - sqrt(2)) )= (-a√2 ) / ( -sqrt(2) )) = a.

So, c= a.

From second equation: (a + c)/sqrt(2) = (-1) * b.

Substituting c = a and b = -a√2:

(a +a)/sqrt(2) = (-1)(-a√2 )

→ 2a / sqrt(2) = a√2.

Simplify 2a/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) a → which is correct.

So the eigenvector for lambda=-1 is [a, -a√2, a]^T. Taking a=1, it's [1, -sqrt(2), 1]^T.

Now, the eigenvalues for P are 1, -1, and 0.

So, when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.

So, the state |ψ> is given as [-1, 2, 1]^T. But it's not a unit vector. Let's compute its norm: sqrt( (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1,2,1]^T.

Wait, but the question is about the probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1.

So the process is:

1. Measure P. Get outcome 0. The state collapses to the eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0, normalized.

Wait, but the eigenstates are orthogonal, so the projection would be onto the eigenspace.

Wait, P has an eigenspace for lambda=0. Because for a 3x3 matrix, the dimension of each eigenspace is at least 1. But in our case, earlier, the eigenvalue 0's eigenvector is any vector of the form [a, 0, -a]^T. So the eigenspace is two-dimensional? Wait, no, no, wait: the eigenspace for lambda=0 is the set of all vectors orthogonal to the other eigenvectors. Wait, perhaps it's a one-dimensional eigenspace, but maybe not. Wait, no, because when lambda=0, the system of equations allowed a = -c and b=0. So any vector of the form (a, 0, -a) is in the eigenspace. So this is a two-dimensional eigenspace? No, no, wait, because we have two parameters: a is a scalar, so the vectors are multiples of (1, 0, -1). So it's a one-dimensional eigenspace.

Wait, no. The eigenspace for lambda=0 is the set of all vectors orthogonal to the other eigenvectors. Let me think again.

Wait, in the case where the matrix P has eigenvalues 1, -1, and 0, each with multiplicity 1, then each eigenspace is one-dimensional. So for lambda=0, the eigenspace is the set of vectors [a, 0, a*(-1)]^T, which is one-dimensional, spanned by [1,0,-1]^T.

So, yes, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, and the projection onto it is along that vector.

So, when the initial state is |ψ> = [-1,2,1]^T (divided by sqrt(6) to normalize), the probability of measuring P=0 is the square of the component of |ψ> in the direction of the eigenvector for 0.

The eigenvector for 0 is v0 = [1, 0, -1]^T, which we can normalize to (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

So, the projection of |ψ> onto v0 is ( |ψ> • v0 ) / (v0 • v0) ) * v0.

Wait, but in terms of probability, the probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of |ψ> and the unit eigenvector.

Wait, let me compute the inner product between |ψ> and v0.

|ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1,2,1].

v0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1].

Inner product: (1/sqrt(6))(-1) * (1/sqrt(2)) (1) ) + (1/sqrt(6))(2) * (1/sqrt(2))(0) ) + (1/sqrt(6))(1) * (1/sqrt(2))(-1) )

Which is ( -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) + 0 + ( -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) )

Which is ( -2 )/(sqrt(12)) ) → sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so -2/(2 sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared of this inner product is (1/ sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Now, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to the eigenvector v0 normalized. So the new state is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

Now, we need to measure Q. The operator Q has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The matrix for Q is diagonal, so its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

The operator Q is:

[[1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, -1]]

So, the eigenvalues are 1 (for e1 = [1,0,0]^T), 0 (for e2 = [0,1,0]^T), and -1 (for e3 = [0,0,1]^T).

So, the state after P=0 is |φ> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

Now, when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1, with probabilities determined by the projections onto each eigenvector.

But let's compute the inner products.

The state |φ> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the projection onto e1 (Q=1) is the first component, which is (1/sqrt(2)) *1 *1 + 0 +0 = 1/sqrt(2). The probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

Projection onto e3 (Q=-1) is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) → the probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

Wait, wait, no. The state |φ> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]. So the first component is 1/sqrt(2), so the probability of Q=1 is (1/sqrt(2))² = 1/2.

Similarly, the third component is -1/sqrt(2), so the probability of Q=-1 is ( (-1/sqrt(2)) )² =1/2.

Wait, but wait a second. Because in the state |φ>, the components are in the basis of Q's eigenvectors. Because Q is diagonal, so the standard basis vectors are its eigenvectors.

So, the state |φ> is expressed as a linear combination of e1, e2, e3.

In this case, |φ> has components:

e1: 1/sqrt(2),

e2: 0,

e3: (-1)/sqrt(2).

So the probability of Q=1 is (1/sqrt(2))^2 =1/2,

Q=0: 0,

Q=-1: (1/sqrt(2))^2 =1/2.

So when we measure Q, the probabilities are 1/2 for Q=1 and Q=-1, and 0 for Q=0.

But wait, the question asks for the probability of getting P=0 followed by Q=-1.

So the combined probability is the product of the probabilities of each step, given the previous step.

Wait no, because each measurement affects the state. But in this case, after measuring P=0, the state is |phi>, and the probability of getting Q=-1 is 1/2.

So the overall probability is the probability of P=0 (which is 1/3) multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 given that P=0 (which is 1/2), so 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Wait, but that would give an answer of 1/6. Let me check the possible options.

Looking at the options, D is 1/6.

But wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Because when you measure P, the state collapses to the eigenspace of P. Then, when measuring Q, if the state is in the |phi> state, which is (1/sqrt(2))(e1 -e3), then the possible outcomes for Q are 1 and -1, each with probability 1/2.

So the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2, but only if we first measured P=0, which happens with probability 1/3.

So overall, the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

So the correct answer is D) 1/6.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the eigenvectors of P. Let me double-check.

Wait, I found that for lambda=0, the eigenvector is [1,0,-1]^T. Is that correct?

Let me check P multiplied by this vector.

P * [1,0,-1]^T would be:

Row 1: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) =0.

Row 2: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0 *0 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) )= (1/sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2))=0.

Row3: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) =0.

So P * [1,0,-1] = [0,0,0]. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, because if [1,0,-1] is an eigenvector with lambda=0, then P * v =0 *v =0. Oh yes, it's correct.

Wait, but in that case, the projection of |ψ> onto v0 is the inner product of |ψ> and v0, divided by the norm of v0.

Wait, |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1,2,1].

v0 is [1,0,-1], which has norm sqrt(1+0+1) = sqrt(2).

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(6)) * ( (-1)(1) + 2*0 +1*(-1) ) = ( -1 -1 ) / sqrt(6) )= (-2)/sqrt(6).

The absolute value squared would be (4)/(6) )= 2/3.

Wait, wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, because earlier I thought the inner product was -1/sqrt(3), but that's not correct. Let me recompute.

The inner product of |ψ> and v0 is [ -1, 2, 1 ] · [1,0,-1] divided by sqrt(6) * sqrt(2).

Because |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1,2,1], and v0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [1,0,-1].

So the inner product is ( (1/sqrt(6))*(1/sqrt(2)) ) * ( (-1)(1) + 2*0 +1*(-1) ) ) = (1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2))) * (-2) )= (-2)/(sqrt(12)) )= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

So the absolute square is (1/3).

So the probability of P=0 is 1/3, which is correct.

So after measuring P=0, the state is v0 normalized. So it's (1/sqrt(2)) [1,0,-1].

Now, measuring Q on this state. The state is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the components are:

e1: 1/sqrt(2),

e2: 0,

e3: -1/sqrt(2).

So the probabilities for Q are:

Q=1: (1/sqrt(2))^2 =1/2,

Q=0: 0,

Q=-1: ( (-1/sqrt(2))^2 )=1/2.

So the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.

So the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.

So the correct answer is D) 1/6.

The problem involves a quantum system with a given state vector and two observables, \( P \) and \( Q \), represented by their respective matrices. The goal is to determine the probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) followed by \( Q = -1 \).

### Step 1: Normalize the state vector
The given state vector is \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Its norm is calculated as:

\[
\| | \psi \rangle \| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state vector is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The matrix for \( P \) is:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found to be \( 1, -1, 0 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is:

\[
v_0 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This eigenvector spans the eigenspace for \( P = 0 \).

### Step 3: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the projection of \( | \psi \rangle \) onto \( v_0 \). The normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\hat{v}_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The inner product of \( | \psi \rangle \) and \( \hat{v}_0 \) is:

\[
\langle \psi | \hat{v}_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this inner product:

\[
P(P = 0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 4: State after measuring \( P = 0 \)
After measuring \( P = 0 \), the system collapses to the eigenstate \( \hat{v}_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \).

### Step 5: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \)
The matrix for \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding eigenvectors \( e_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), \( e_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), and \( e_3 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

The state after measuring \( P = 0 \) is \( | \phi \rangle = \hat{v}_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the projection of \( | \phi \rangle \) onto \( e_3 \):

\[
P(Q = -1) = \left| \langle e_3 | \phi \rangle \right|^2 = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 6: Combined probability
The combined probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and then \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P = 0 \text{ and } Q = -1) = P(P = 0) \cdot P(Q = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
**Answer: D**

Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states that the system's state at time t is given by the column matrix (-1, 2, 1). Hmm, wait, is that a 3-dimensional vector? Because the matrix for operator P is 3x3. So the state is a column vector with three elements: -1, 2, 1. But wait, quantum states are usually represented as vectors with unit norm. So I should check if this vector is normalized. Let me compute the magnitude squared: (-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 = 1 +4 +1 =6. Oh, so it's not normalized. So the state vector isn't a unit vector. That might complicate things, but maybe I can normalize it later or see if it's required.

The operators P and Q are given as matrices. For P, the matrix is:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0
Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)
Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

And for Q, the matrix is diagonal:
Row 1: 1, 0, 0
Row 2: 0, 0, 0
Row 3: 0, 0, -1

The question is about measuring P and then Q. We need the probability of getting 0 when measuring P and -1 when measuring Q.

Wait, no, the question says someone measures Q just after measuring P. So the order is P first, then Q. We're to find the probability of getting P=0 and Q=-1.

Wait, no, wait. The wording is a bit unclear. It says, "the probability of getting 0 for P and -1 for Q in the respective measurements." So, the measurements are done in the order P first, then Q. So the probability is the same as: first, measure P and get 0, then measure Q and get -1.

But in quantum mechanics, when you measure an observable, the state collapses into an eigenstate of that observable. So after measuring P=0, the state would be the projection onto the eigenspace of P corresponding to eigenvalue 0. Then, measuring Q on this new state would give -1 with some probability.

Alternatively, perhaps the state after P is measured is the eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to approach this by considering the possible outcomes step by step.

First, find the possible eigenvalues of P and their corresponding eigenvectors. Then, compute the probability of getting 0 when measuring P. Then, for the state that results after this measurement, compute the probability of getting Q=-1.

But wait, perhaps I should first compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of P.

Alternatively, since Q is diagonal, its eigenvalues are 1, 0, -1. So measuring Q gives 1, 0, or -1.

But let me approach this step by step.

First, let's find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of operator P.

Operator P matrix:

Row 1: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Row 2: 1/sqrt(2), 0, 1/sqrt(2)

Row 3: 0, 1/sqrt(2), 0

Hmm, okay, so I can write P as a matrix:

P = [
[0, 1/√2, 0],
[1/√2, 0, 1/√2],
[0, 1/√2, 0]
]

To find the eigenvalues, I need to compute the determinant of (P - λ I) = 0.

So, the characteristic equation is det(P - λ I) = 0.

Let's write the matrix P - λ I:

Row 1: [ -λ, 1/√2 , 0 ]

Row 2: [1/√2, -λ, 1/√2 ]

Row 3: [0, 1/√2, -λ ]

The determinant of this matrix must be zero.

Calculating the determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be tedious, but perhaps there's symmetry here that can be exploited.

Alternatively, maybe P has some known structure. Let's see.

Perhaps P is a symmetric matrix, which it is (since P is a Hermitian operator, which is necessary for observables). So yes, P is Hermitian.

But maybe it's easier to look for eigenvectors and eigenvalues by inspection.

Looking for eigenvectors:

Let's assume a vector v = [a, b, c]^T.

We have P v = λ v.

So, according to the first row:

0*a + (1/√2) b + 0*c = λ a → (1/√2) b = λ a → b = λ a * sqrt(2)

Second row: (1/√2) a + 0*b + (1/√2) c = λ b → (a + c)/sqrt(2) = λ b.

Third row: 0*a + (1/√2) b + 0*c = λ c → (1/√2) b = λ c → b = λ c * sqrt(2).

Hmm, from first and third equations: b = λ a sqrt(2) = λ c sqrt(2). So, if λ is not zero, then a = c.

From the second equation: (a + c)/sqrt(2) = λ b. Since a = c, this becomes 2a/sqrt(2) = λ b. Simplify 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2), so sqrt(2) a = lambda b.

But from the first equation, b = lambda a sqrt(2), so substitute this into the second equation:

sqrt(2) a = lambda * [lambda a sqrt(2) ]

So sqrt(2) a = lambda^2 a sqrt(2) )

Assuming a ≠ 0 (since if a=0, then from b= lambda a sqrt(2), b=0, and from third equation, c=0, so the trivial solution), so we can divide both sides by a sqrt(2):

1 = lambda^2 → lambda = ±1.

Wait, so the eigenvalues are 1 and -1? But wait, since the trace of P is 0 (trace is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0), the sum of eigenvalues is zero. So if eigenvalues are 1 and -1, then we must have another eigenvalue, perhaps 0. Or maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let's check the trace. The trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. For P, the diagonal elements are 0, 0, 0. So the sum of eigenvalues is zero.

If I get eigenvalues as 1, -1, and 0, because 1 + (-1) +0=0, that would make sense. So that's likely.

So let's consider lambda =1, lambda=-1, and lambda=0.

Wait, let's go back. When I assumed a ≠0, but perhaps there's another case when a=0. Let me try that.

Case 1: a=0.

From first equation, b = lambda * 0 * sqrt(2) → b=0.

Third equation: (1/√2) b = lambda c → 0 = lambda c.

So either lambda=0 or c=0.

If lambda=0, then from the second equation: (0 + c)/sqrt(2) = 0 * b → c/sqrt(2)=0 → c=0. So the vector is [0,0,0], which is trivial. So non-trivial solution must have lambda=0 and c can be non-zero? Wait, no: if lambda=0, then from third equation, (1/√2) b=0 → b=0, and from first equation, b=0. So c can be anything, but from the second equation, (a + c)/sqrt(2) = 0 → a + c =0. But a is zero, so c=0. So no non-trivial solution here.

So, perhaps lambda=0 is an eigenvalue. Let's see.

Assume lambda=0.

Then, from the first equation: (1/√2) b = 0 → b=0.

Third equation: (1/√2) b = 0 → b=0.

Second equation: (a + c)/sqrt(2) =0 → a = -c.

So, the eigenvector must satisfy a = -c, and b=0.

Thus, any vector of the form (a, 0, -a) would be an eigenvector with eigenvalue 0.

So, for example, [1, 0, -1]^T is an eigenvector for lambda=0.

So, that's the eigenvector for lambda=0.

Now, back to the case where lambda^2 =1 → lambda=1 or lambda=-1.

Case 2: lambda=1.

From first equation: b = 1 * a * sqrt(2) → b = a√2.

From third equation: b = 1 * c * sqrt(2) → c = b/(sqrt(2)) = (a√2)/sqrt(2) )= a.

So, c = a.

From the second equation: (a + c)/sqrt(2) = 1 * b → (a + a)/sqrt(2) = b → (2a)/sqrt(2) = b → sqrt(2) a = b.

But from first equation, b= a√2 → which is the same as sqrt(2) a. So that's consistent.

So the eigenvector for lambda=1 is proportional to [a, a√2, a]^T. Choosing a=1, we get v = [1, sqrt(2), 1]^T.

Wait, but let's check if this is correct.

Wait, [1, sqrt(2), 1]^T.

Multiply by P:

P * v = ?

Row 1: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) + 0*1 = (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) )= 1.

Row 2: (1/sqrt(2)) *1 + 0 * sqrt(2) + (1/sqrt(2)) *1 = (1/sqrt(2) + 1/sqrt(2)) )= 2/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2).

Row 3: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2) + 0 *1 = (1/sqrt(2)) * sqrt(2)) =1.

So P*v would be [1, sqrt(2), 1]^T, which is v multiplied by 1. So yes, P*v =1 *v. So that's correct.

Similarly, for lambda=-1:

From first equation: b = (-1) *a * sqrt(2) → b = -a√2.

From third equation: b = (-1) * c * sqrt(2) → c = b/( - sqrt(2)) )= (-a√2 ) / ( -sqrt(2) )) = a.

So, c= a.

From second equation: (a + c)/sqrt(2) = (-1) * b.

Substituting c = a and b = -a√2:

(a +a)/sqrt(2) = (-1)(-a√2 )

→ 2a / sqrt(2) = a√2.

Simplify 2a/sqrt(2) = sqrt(2) a → which is correct.

So the eigenvector for lambda=-1 is [a, -a√2, a]^T. Taking a=1, it's [1, -sqrt(2), 1]^T.

Now, the eigenvalues for P are 1, -1, and 0.

So, when we measure P, the possible outcomes are 0, 1, -1.

So, the state |ψ> is given as [-1, 2, 1]^T. But it's not a unit vector. Let's compute its norm: sqrt( (-1)^2 +2^2 +1^2 )= sqrt(1+4+1)=sqrt(6). So the normalized state is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1,2,1]^T.

Wait, but the question is about the probability of measuring P=0 and then Q=-1.

So the process is:

1. Measure P. Get outcome 0. The state collapses to the eigenstate of P with eigenvalue 0, normalized.

Wait, but the eigenstates are orthogonal, so the projection would be onto the eigenspace.

Wait, P has an eigenspace for lambda=0. Because for a 3x3 matrix, the dimension of each eigenspace is at least 1. But in our case, earlier, the eigenvalue 0's eigenvector is any vector of the form [a, 0, -a]^T. So the eigenspace is two-dimensional? Wait, no, no, wait: the eigenspace for lambda=0 is the set of all vectors orthogonal to the other eigenvectors. Wait, perhaps it's a one-dimensional eigenspace, but maybe not. Wait, no, because when lambda=0, the system of equations allowed a = -c and b=0. So any vector of the form (a, 0, -a) is in the eigenspace. So this is a two-dimensional eigenspace? No, no, wait, because we have two parameters: a is a scalar, so the vectors are multiples of (1, 0, -1). So it's a one-dimensional eigenspace.

Wait, no. The eigenspace for lambda=0 is the set of all vectors orthogonal to the other eigenvectors. Let me think again.

Wait, in the case where the matrix P has eigenvalues 1, -1, and 0, each with multiplicity 1, then each eigenspace is one-dimensional. So for lambda=0, the eigenspace is the set of vectors [a, 0, a*(-1)]^T, which is one-dimensional, spanned by [1,0,-1]^T.

So, yes, the eigenspace is one-dimensional, and the projection onto it is along that vector.

So, when the initial state is |ψ> = [-1,2,1]^T (divided by sqrt(6) to normalize), the probability of measuring P=0 is the square of the component of |ψ> in the direction of the eigenvector for 0.

The eigenvector for 0 is v0 = [1, 0, -1]^T, which we can normalize to (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

So, the projection of |ψ> onto v0 is ( |ψ> • v0 ) / (v0 • v0) ) * v0.

Wait, but in terms of probability, the probability is the square of the absolute value of the inner product of |ψ> and the unit eigenvector.

Wait, let me compute the inner product between |ψ> and v0.

|ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1,2,1].

v0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1].

Inner product: (1/sqrt(6))(-1) * (1/sqrt(2)) (1) ) + (1/sqrt(6))(2) * (1/sqrt(2))(0) ) + (1/sqrt(6))(1) * (1/sqrt(2))(-1) )

Which is ( -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) ) + 0 + ( -1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2)) )

Which is ( -2 )/(sqrt(12)) ) → sqrt(12) is 2*sqrt(3), so -2/(2 sqrt(3)) )= -1/sqrt(3).

The absolute value squared of this inner product is (1/ sqrt(3))^2 = 1/3.

So the probability of measuring P=0 is 1/3.

Now, after measuring P=0, the state collapses to the eigenvector v0 normalized. So the new state is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

Now, we need to measure Q. The operator Q has eigenvalues 1, 0, -1.

The matrix for Q is diagonal, so its eigenvectors are the standard basis vectors.

The operator Q is:

[[1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, -1]]

So, the eigenvalues are 1 (for e1 = [1,0,0]^T), 0 (for e2 = [0,1,0]^T), and -1 (for e3 = [0,0,1]^T).

So, the state after P=0 is |φ> = (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

Now, when we measure Q, the possible outcomes are 1, 0, -1, with probabilities determined by the projections onto each eigenvector.

But let's compute the inner products.

The state |φ> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the projection onto e1 (Q=1) is the first component, which is (1/sqrt(2)) *1 *1 + 0 +0 = 1/sqrt(2). The probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

Projection onto e3 (Q=-1) is (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) → the probability is (1/sqrt(2))^2 = 1/2.

Wait, wait, no. The state |φ> is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]. So the first component is 1/sqrt(2), so the probability of Q=1 is (1/sqrt(2))² = 1/2.

Similarly, the third component is -1/sqrt(2), so the probability of Q=-1 is ( (-1/sqrt(2)) )² =1/2.

Wait, but wait a second. Because in the state |φ>, the components are in the basis of Q's eigenvectors. Because Q is diagonal, so the standard basis vectors are its eigenvectors.

So, the state |φ> is expressed as a linear combination of e1, e2, e3.

In this case, |φ> has components:

e1: 1/sqrt(2),

e2: 0,

e3: (-1)/sqrt(2).

So the probability of Q=1 is (1/sqrt(2))^2 =1/2,

Q=0: 0,

Q=-1: (1/sqrt(2))^2 =1/2.

So when we measure Q, the probabilities are 1/2 for Q=1 and Q=-1, and 0 for Q=0.

But wait, the question asks for the probability of getting P=0 followed by Q=-1.

So the combined probability is the product of the probabilities of each step, given the previous step.

Wait no, because each measurement affects the state. But in this case, after measuring P=0, the state is |phi>, and the probability of getting Q=-1 is 1/2.

So the overall probability is the probability of P=0 (which is 1/3) multiplied by the probability of Q=-1 given that P=0 (which is 1/2), so 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Wait, but that would give an answer of 1/6. Let me check the possible options.

Looking at the options, D is 1/6.

But wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Because when you measure P, the state collapses to the eigenspace of P. Then, when measuring Q, if the state is in the |phi> state, which is (1/sqrt(2))(e1 -e3), then the possible outcomes for Q are 1 and -1, each with probability 1/2.

So the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2, but only if we first measured P=0, which happens with probability 1/3.

So overall, the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) = 1/6.

So the correct answer is D) 1/6.

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the eigenvectors of P. Let me double-check.

Wait, I found that for lambda=0, the eigenvector is [1,0,-1]^T. Is that correct?

Let me check P multiplied by this vector.

P * [1,0,-1]^T would be:

Row 1: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) =0.

Row 2: (1/sqrt(2))*1 + 0 *0 + (1/sqrt(2))*(-1) )= (1/sqrt(2) -1/sqrt(2))=0.

Row3: 0*1 + (1/sqrt(2))*0 + 0*(-1) =0.

So P * [1,0,-1] = [0,0,0]. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, because if [1,0,-1] is an eigenvector with lambda=0, then P * v =0 *v =0. Oh yes, it's correct.

Wait, but in that case, the projection of |ψ> onto v0 is the inner product of |ψ> and v0, divided by the norm of v0.

Wait, |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1,2,1].

v0 is [1,0,-1], which has norm sqrt(1+0+1) = sqrt(2).

So the inner product is (1/sqrt(6)) * ( (-1)(1) + 2*0 +1*(-1) ) = ( -1 -1 ) / sqrt(6) )= (-2)/sqrt(6).

The absolute value squared would be (4)/(6) )= 2/3.

Wait, wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, because earlier I thought the inner product was -1/sqrt(3), but that's not correct. Let me recompute.

The inner product of |ψ> and v0 is [ -1, 2, 1 ] · [1,0,-1] divided by sqrt(6) * sqrt(2).

Because |ψ> is (1/sqrt(6)) [-1,2,1], and v0 is (1/sqrt(2)) [1,0,-1].

So the inner product is ( (1/sqrt(6))*(1/sqrt(2)) ) * ( (-1)(1) + 2*0 +1*(-1) ) ) = (1/(sqrt(6)*sqrt(2))) * (-2) )= (-2)/(sqrt(12)) )= (-2)/(2*sqrt(3)) )= (-1)/sqrt(3).

So the absolute square is (1/3).

So the probability of P=0 is 1/3, which is correct.

So after measuring P=0, the state is v0 normalized. So it's (1/sqrt(2)) [1,0,-1].

Now, measuring Q on this state. The state is (1/sqrt(2)) [1, 0, -1]^T.

So the components are:

e1: 1/sqrt(2),

e2: 0,

e3: -1/sqrt(2).

So the probabilities for Q are:

Q=1: (1/sqrt(2))^2 =1/2,

Q=0: 0,

Q=-1: ( (-1/sqrt(2))^2 )=1/2.

So the probability of Q=-1 is 1/2.

So the combined probability is (1/3) * (1/2) )= 1/6.

So the correct answer is D) 1/6.


The problem involves a quantum system with a given state vector and two observables, \( P \) and \( Q \), represented by their respective matrices. The goal is to determine the probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) followed by \( Q = -1 \).

### Step 1: Normalize the state vector
The given state vector is \( | \psi \rangle = \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \). Its norm is calculated as:

\[
\| | \psi \rangle \| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 2^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{6}.
\]

Thus, the normalized state vector is:

\[
| \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

### Step 2: Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of \( P \)
The matrix for \( P \) is:

\[
P = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\
0 & \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} & 0
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( P \) are found to be \( 1, -1, 0 \). The eigenvector corresponding to \( \lambda = 0 \) is:

\[
v_0 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

This eigenvector spans the eigenspace for \( P = 0 \).

### Step 3: Probability of measuring \( P = 0 \)
The probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) is the square of the projection of \( | \psi \rangle \) onto \( v_0 \). The normalized eigenvector is:

\[
\hat{v}_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix}.
\]

The inner product of \( | \psi \rangle \) and \( \hat{v}_0 \) is:

\[
\langle \psi | \hat{v}_0 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} \begin{bmatrix} -1 & 2 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{12}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

The probability is the square of the absolute value of this inner product:

\[
P(P = 0) = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{3}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

### Step 4: State after measuring \( P = 0 \)
After measuring \( P = 0 \), the system collapses to the eigenstate \( \hat{v}_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \).

### Step 5: Probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \)
The matrix for \( Q \) is diagonal:

\[
Q = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & -1
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( Q \) are \( 1, 0, -1 \), with corresponding eigenvectors \( e_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), \( e_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \), and \( e_3 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} \).

The state after measuring \( P = 0 \) is \( | \phi \rangle = \hat{v}_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} \). The probability of measuring \( Q = -1 \) is the square of the projection of \( | \phi \rangle \) onto \( e_3 \):

\[
P(Q = -1) = \left| \langle e_3 | \phi \rangle \right|^2 = \left| \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \right|^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 6: Combined probability
The combined probability of measuring \( P = 0 \) and then \( Q = -1 \) is:

\[
P(P = 0 \text{ and } Q = -1) = P(P = 0) \cdot P(Q = -1) = \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{6}.
\]

### Final Answer:
**Answer: D**
