Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem in front of me. The question is about the density matrix of a qubit and its geometrical position in the qubit space. Hmm, I remember that density matrices are used to describe the state of a quantum system, especially when it's mixed. 

The given density matrix is ρ = (1/2)(|0⟩⟨0| + |1⟩⟨1|). Let me write that out in matrix form to visualize it better. The standard basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩ are represented as column vectors [1; 0] and [0; 1], respectively. So, |0⟩⟨0| is a matrix with 1 in the (1,1) position and zeros elsewhere, and similarly for |1⟩⟨1|, it's 1 in (2,2). 

Adding these two matrices and multiplying by 1/2, each diagonal element becomes 1/2. The off-diagonal elements are zero because |0⟩⟨1| would have a 1 in the (1,2) position and vice versa, but when you add |0⟩⟨0| and |1⟩⟨1|, the off-diagonals cancel out. So the matrix ρ is diagonal with both diagonal elements as 1/2.

Now, I need to find the geometrical position of this density matrix in the qubit space. Wait, what's the geometrical representation of qubit states? Oh right, qubits can be represented as points on the Bloch sphere. The Bloch sphere is a way to visualize a single qubit state. 

But wait, the density matrix isn't a pure state; it's a mixed state because it's a statistical mixture of |0⟩ and |1⟩. A pure state would have a density matrix ρ where the square of the eigenvalues adds up to 1. Here, the eigenvalues are 1/2 and 1/2, which sum to 1, but each squared is 1/4, adding to 1/2. So it's a mixed state.

The Bloch sphere is for pure states, right? But how do mixed states fit into this geometry? Oh, I think mixed states are represented as points inside the Bloch sphere. The further the point from the center, the more mixed the state is, or wait, no—wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, no, the radius of the Bloch sphere corresponds to the purity of the state. A pure state is on the surface (radius 1), and mixed states are inside with a smaller radius.

But wait, the question is about the geometrical position of the density matrix in qubit space. I think each density matrix can be associated with a point in the Bloch sphere. The general form for a single-qubit density matrix is:

ρ = (I + r·σ)/2,

where σ are the Pauli matrices, and r is a vector (r_x, r_y, r_z). So, let me expand that.

The Pauli matrices are σ_x = [[0,1],[1,0]], σ_y = [[0,-i],[i,0]], σ_z = [[1,0],[0,-1]]. So, the expression becomes:

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

Given that, I can compare this with the given ρ matrix.

The given ρ is [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]]. Let me compute this using the general form.

I is the identity matrix, which is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So,

(I)/2 is [[1/2, 0],[0,1/2]].

Then, adding the terms with r_x, r_y, r_z:

r_x σ_x /2 = [ [0, r_x/2], [r_x/2, 0] ]

r_y σ_y /2 = [ [0, -i r_y/2], [i r_y/2, 0] ]

r_z σ_z /2 = [ [r_z/2, 0], [0, -r_z/2] ]

So when we add all these together:

ρ = (I + ... ) /2 = I/2 + (r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

So the overall matrix is:

[ [ 1/2 + r_z/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ],
  [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , 1/2 - r_z/2 ] ]

But our given ρ is diagonal with both diagonal elements 1/2. So that means the off-diagonal elements must be zero, and the diagonal elements must match. Let's set the off-diagonal elements to zero.

(r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 → r_x - i r_y = 0 → r_x = i r_y.

But wait, r_x and r_y are real numbers, right? Because r is a real vector. So the only way this can be zero is if both r_x and r_y are zero. Because if r_x is real and r_y is real, then i r_y is purely imaginary. The only way r_x equals i r_y is if both are zero. Because otherwise, r_x is real and i r_y is imaginary, which can't be equal unless both are zero.

So r_x = 0 and r_y = 0. 

Now, looking at the diagonal elements: 1/2 + r_z/2 = 1/2 (from the top-left element of ρ). So:

1/2 + r_z/2 = 1/2 → r_z/2 = 0 → r_z = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So all components of r are zero. So r = (0, 0, 0). That makes sense because the density matrix is a completely mixed state. It's equally likely to be in |0⟩ or |1⟩, which corresponds to the completely mixed state. On the Bloch sphere, the completely mixed state is at the center, which is the origin (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.

The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this is:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is a diagonal matrix with equal probabilities for the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), indicating a mixed state. The density matrix can be represented in the Bloch sphere formalism as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a real vector. Expanding this, the general form of \(\rho\) is:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{r_z}{2} & \frac{r_x - i r_y}{2} \\
\frac{r_x + i r_y}{2} & \frac{1}{2} - \frac{r_z}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), the off-diagonal elements must be zero, which implies \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\). The diagonal elements give:

\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{r_z}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad r_z = 0.
\]

Thus, the vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is \((0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the completely mixed state, which lies at the origin of the Bloch sphere. This matches option C.

ρ = (I + r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

Given that, I can compare this with the given ρ matrix.

The given ρ is [[1/2, 0],[0, 1/2]]. Let me compute this using the general form.

I is the identity matrix, which is [[1,0],[0,1]]. So,

(I)/2 is [[1/2, 0],[0,1/2]].

Then, adding the terms with r_x, r_y, r_z:

r_x σ_x /2 = [ [0, r_x/2], [r_x/2, 0] ]

r_y σ_y /2 = [ [0, -i r_y/2], [i r_y/2, 0] ]

r_z σ_z /2 = [ [r_z/2, 0], [0, -r_z/2] ]

So when we add all these together:

ρ = (I + ... ) /2 = I/2 + (r_x σ_x + r_y σ_y + r_z σ_z)/2.

So the overall matrix is:

[ [ 1/2 + r_z/2 , (r_x - i r_y)/2 ],
  [ (r_x + i r_y)/2 , 1/2 - r_z/2 ] ]

But our given ρ is diagonal with both diagonal elements 1/2. So that means the off-diagonal elements must be zero, and the diagonal elements must match. Let's set the off-diagonal elements to zero.

(r_x - i r_y)/2 = 0 → r_x - i r_y = 0 → r_x = i r_y.

But wait, r_x and r_y are real numbers, right? Because r is a real vector. So the only way this can be zero is if both r_x and r_y are zero. Because if r_x is real and r_y is real, then i r_y is purely imaginary. The only way r_x equals i r_y is if both are zero. Because otherwise, r_x is real and i r_y is imaginary, which can't be equal unless both are zero.

So r_x = 0 and r_y = 0. 

Now, looking at the diagonal elements: 1/2 + r_z/2 = 1/2 (from the top-left element of ρ). So:

1/2 + r_z/2 = 1/2 → r_z/2 = 0 → r_z = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So all components of r are zero. So r = (0, 0, 0). That makes sense because the density matrix is a completely mixed state. It's equally likely to be in |0⟩ or |1⟩, which corresponds to the completely mixed state. On the Bloch sphere, the completely mixed state is at the center, which is the origin (0,0,0).

Looking at the options, option C is (0,0,0). So the correct answer should be C.


The given density matrix is 

\[
\rho = \frac{1}{2} \left( \left|0\right\rangle \left\langle 0\right| + \left|1\right\rangle \left\langle 1\right| \right).
\]

In matrix form, this is:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\
0 & \frac{1}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

This is a diagonal matrix with equal probabilities for the states \(|0\rangle\) and \(|1\rangle\), indicating a mixed state. The density matrix can be represented in the Bloch sphere formalism as:

\[
\rho = \frac{I + \mathbf{r} \cdot \boldsymbol{\sigma}}{2},
\]

where \(I\) is the identity matrix, \(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\) are the Pauli matrices, and \(\mathbf{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)\) is a real vector. Expanding this, the general form of \(\rho\) is:

\[
\rho = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{r_z}{2} & \frac{r_x - i r_y}{2} \\
\frac{r_x + i r_y}{2} & \frac{1}{2} - \frac{r_z}{2}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Comparing this with the given \(\rho\), the off-diagonal elements must be zero, which implies \(r_x = 0\) and \(r_y = 0\). The diagonal elements give:

\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{r_z}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad r_z = 0.
\]

Thus, the vector \(\mathbf{r}\) is \((0, 0, 0)\), corresponding to the completely mixed state, which lies at the origin of the Bloch sphere. This matches option C.
