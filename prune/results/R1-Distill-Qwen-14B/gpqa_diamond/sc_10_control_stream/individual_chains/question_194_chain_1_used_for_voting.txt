Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. And the options are A to D.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? So each state contributes a term to Z based on its energy.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 =8 possible states. I think I need to list all those states and calculate E for each, then sum the exponentials.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Because that's time-consuming, especially in an exam setting. Let me think about the symmetry or possible groupings.

The energy expression is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's see: each term S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1, because each S is ±1.

So S_i S_j = 1 if S_i and S_j are the same, and -1 if different. So each product is either 1 or -1.

So the sum inside the brackets is the sum of three terms: each being ±1. So the total sum can range from -3 to +3, in increments of 2? Well, let's see: the possible sums are when all three are +1 (sum=3), two +1 and one -1 (sum=1), one +1 and two -1 (sum=-1), and all three -1 (sum=-3). So the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Each S_i S_j can be +1 or -1, so the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can have different possible values.

I think the sum can take on the values 3, 1, -1, -3. Because, for example, if all three pairs are +1, sum is 3. If two are +1 and one is -1, sum is 1. If one is +1 and two are -1, sum is -1. If all three are -1, sum is -3.

So E is equal to -J multiplied by this sum. So E can be: -J*3, -J*1, -J*(-1)=J, and -J*(-3)=3J.

Wait, that's the E for each possible state. So the energies are E = -3J, -J, J, 3J.

Wait, but I need to count how many states correspond to each energy.

So for each possible sum of the three terms, how many states give that sum?

Let's consider the sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

If S is 3: that means all three terms are +1. So S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Which implies that S1=S2, S2=S3, so all three spins are the same. So all three are +1 or all three are -1.

So there are two states where all three are same: (+1,+1,+1) and (-1,-1,-1). So for S=3, two states.

When sum S=1: which comes from two +1s and one -1. Let's see, each of the three terms can be -1. So how many ways can two of them be +1 and one be -1?

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the possible ways the sum can be 1. For S=1, each term can be +1 or -1, and the total is 1. So the number of +1 terms minus the number of -1 terms must equal 1. Because S has three terms.

So, suppose there are two +1's and one -1. Because 2*(+1) + 1*(-1) = 2-1=1.

So how many states have two +1's and one -1 in the product terms?

Each product term is S_i S_j, which is 1 if S_i = S_j, else -1.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about each state (each set of S1, S2, S3) and compute the sum.

Wait, maybe I can find the number of states that give each sum S.

Let me think: for S=3, as above, two states.

For S=1: how many states?

Alternatively, perhaps think about each state's energy.

Each spin configuration (S1, S2, S3) will have a certain sum S, leading to E = -J S.

Wait, no: E is -J times the sum. So E = -J * (sum of S_i S_j). So the sum is S, so E = -J S.

Wait, but when S=3, E = -3J. When S=1, E=-J. When S=-1, E=J. When S=-3, E=3J.

Wait, that's correct.

So now, for each possible energy, how many states have that E?

So for E = -3J (sum S=3), as earlier, two states.

For E = -J (sum S=1), how many states?

When sum S=1, the number of product terms that are +1 is two, and one is -1.

But each product term S_i S_j being +1 implies S_i = S_j.

So let's think: when S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 =1, that could be due to two of the products being +1 and one being -1.

Which two products are +1? Let's consider the three possible combinations:

Case 1: S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1.

If S1S2=1, S1=S2. S1S3=1: S1=S3. So S1=S2=S3. Then S2S3=1, but our case here is S2S3=-1. Contradiction. So this case is impossible.

Case 2: S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1.

S1=S2, but S1 != S3 (since S1S3=-1). And S2=S3 (because S2S3=1). So S2=S3, but S1=S2 and S1 != S3. Contradiction. So this is impossible.

Case 3: S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1.

So S1 != S2, S1=S3, and S2=S3. So S1=S3, but S2 = S3, which implies S1=S2, but then that would imply S1S2=1, which contradicts S1S2=-1. Hmm, that doesn't work either.

Wait, so maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps I should think about the number of spin configurations leading to each sum.

Wait, another approach: for each of the 8 possible spin states, compute the sum S and count how many states have each S.

Since there are 8 states, maybe listing them would be manageable.

Let me list all possible (S1, S2, S3) and compute S for each.

Each S can be +1 or -1.

1. (1,1,1)
Compute S = (1*1) + (1*1) + (1*1) = 1 +1 +1 =3.

2. (1,1,-1)
S = (1*1) + (1*(-1)) + (1*(-1)) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

3. (1,-1,1)
S = (1*(-1)) + (1*1) + (-1*1) = (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.

4. (1,-1,-1)
S = (1*(-1)) + (1*(-1)) + (-1*(-1)) = (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.

5. (-1,1,1)
S = (-1*1) + (-1*1) + (1*1) = (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.

6. (-1,1,-1)
S = (-1*1) + (-1*(-1)) + (1*(-1)) = (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.

7. (-1,-1,1)
S = (-1*(-1)) + (-1*1) + (-1*1) =1 -1 -1 = -1.

8. (-1,-1,-1)
S = (-1*(-1)) + (-1*(-1)) + (-1*(-1)) =1 +1 +1 =3.

Wait, that's interesting. So looking at all 8 states:

States 1 and 8 have S=3.

States 2,3,4,5,6,7 have S=-1.

Wait, that can't be right because I thought earlier that when S=3, E=-3J, and when S=-3, E=3J. But according to the calculation, I have states with S=3 and S=-1 only?

Wait, wait no, I must have made a mistake. Let me recompute S for each state.

Wait, let me re-calculate each S:

1. (1,1,1):
S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum 3.

2. (1,1,-1):
S1S2=1, S1S3= (1*(-1))= -1, S2S3= (1*(-1))= -1. Sum 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

3. (1,-1,1):
S1S2= (1*(-1))= -1, S1S3= (1*1)=1, S2S3= (-1*1)= -1. Sum: -1 +1 + (-1) = -1.

4. (1,-1,-1):
S1S2= -1, S1S3= (1*(-1))= -1, S2S3= (-1*(-1))=1. Sum: -1 + (-1) +1 = -1.

5. (-1,1,1):
S1S2= (-1)(1)= -1, S1S3= (-1)(1)= -1, S2S3= (1*1)=1. Sum: -1 + (-1) +1 = -1.

6. (-1,1,-1):
S1S2= (-1)(1)= -1, S1S3= (-1)(-1)=1, S2S3= (1)(-1)= -1. Sum: -1 +1 + (-1) )= -1.

7. (-1,-1,1):
S1S2= (-1)(-1)=1, S1S3= (-1)(1)= -1, S2S3= (-1)(1)= -1. Sum:1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

8. (-1,-1,-1):
All terms are 1. Sum 3.

So from the 8 states:

Two states have sum S=3 (states 1 and 8).

Six states have sum S=-1 (states 2,3,4,5,6,7).

Wait, so where are the other possibilities? I thought earlier that S could be 1 or -3 as well.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the sum for some states. Let me check one more time.

Wait for state (1,1,-1):

S1S2=1*1=1, S1S3=1*(-1)=-1, S2S3=1*(-1)=-1.

Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1. Correct.

State (-1,-1,1):

S1S2= (-1)(-1)=1, S1S3= (-1)(1)= -1, S2S3= (-1)(1)= -1.

Sum:1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. Correct.

Wait a second, so according to this, in all three of the product terms, except for the all +1 and all -1 cases, the sum is -1. Hmmm. That's strange. So for the 8 states, sum S can be 3 or -1 only.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the sum could be 3, 1, -1, -3. But according to this, that's not the case. So perhaps my initial approach was wrong.

So what's the mistake here?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the sum of S_i with the sum of S_i S_j. The sum S_i S_j has different possibilities.

Wait, perhaps the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3, but according to the explicit calculation, the sum is either 3 or -1 for all 8 states.

So that's confusing. Because I thought that the sum could have other values.

Alternatively, perhaps my mistake was in the initial assumption that each product term can be either +1 or -1, leading to different sums. But according to the explicit calculation, for three spins, the sum can only be 3 or -1.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think about another scenario. For example, consider S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1. Sum S is 1*(1) +1*(-1) +1*(-1) = 1-1-1=-1. That's correct.

Another state: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1. Sum terms: (1*-1) + (1*1) + (-1*1) )= (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.

Wait, another state: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Sum terms: (1*-1) + (1*-1) + (-1*-1) )= (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.

So all the states except the two all-same cases give sum S=-1.

So that means the possible sum S is either 3 (for two states) or -1 (for six states). So E = -J * S. So for S=3, E = -3J. For S=-1, E = J.

Wait, wait no: E = -J * (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So when S=3, E = -3J. When S=-1, E = -J*(-1) = J.

So the energies are either -3J or J.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-β E).

Each state contributes exp(-β E) to Z.

So for the two states where E = -3J, each contributes exp(3J β).

For the six states where E = J, each contributes exp(-J β).

So Z = 2 * exp(3J β) + 6 * exp(-J β).

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A is 2 e^(-3J β) +6 e^(J β). So that's 2 exp(-3J β) plus 6 exp(J β).

But our calculation gives Z=2 exp(3J β) +6 exp(-J β), which is not any of the options exactly.

Wait, let me look again. The options are:

Option A) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)

B) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)

C) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)

D) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)

Hmm, our calculation gives 2 exp(3J β) + 6 exp(-J β), which is option B.

Wait, so option B is Z=2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ). Which matches.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the energy is E = -J [S1S2 + ... ].

So for the two states with sum S=3, E = -J*(3) = -3J.

So exp(-β E) = exp(3J β), which is correct.

The other six states have sum S=-1, so E = -J*(-1) = J. So exp(-β E) = exp( -J β), which is correct.

So Z=2 e^{3J β} +6 e^{- J β}, which is option B.

Wait, but the options are given as:

A) 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ)

B) 2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ)

Yes, this matches. So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check: when S=-1, E is J, so the exponential term is exp(-β * E) = exp(-β J).

So the partition function is sum over all states of exp(-β E) = sum exp( -β E ).

Which for the two states with E=-3J: exp(3 J β), each.

Six states with E=J: exp(-J β), each.

So Z=2 e^{3J β} +6 e^{-J β}, which is option B.

To solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \right).
\]

### Step 1: Possible Energy Values
Each term \( S_iS_j \) can be either \( +1 \) (if \( S_i = S_j \)) or \( -1 \) (if \( S_i \neq S_j \)). The sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \) can therefore range from \( -3 \) to \( +3 \), in increments of \( 2 \). This gives possible sums \( S = 3, 1, -1, -3 \). Substituting into the energy expression, the corresponding energies are:

\[
E = -J \cdot S,
\]
so the possible energies are \( E = -3J, -J, J, 3J \).

### Step 2: Counting States for Each Energy
We enumerate all \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible spin configurations and compute the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \) for each:

1. \( (1,1,1) \): \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \), so \( S = 3 \).
2. \( (1,1,-1) \): \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \), so \( S = -1 \).
3. \( (1,-1,1) \): \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = -1 \), so \( S = -1 \).
4. \( (1,-1,-1) \): \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = 1 \), so \( S = -1 \).
5. \( (-1,1,1) \): \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = 1 \), so \( S = -1 \).
6. \( (-1,1,-1) \): \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = -1 \), so \( S = -1 \).
7. \( (-1,-1,1) \): \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \), so \( S = -1 \).
8. \( (-1,-1,-1) \): \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \), so \( S = 3 \).

From this, there are **2 states** with \( S = 3 \) (energies \( E = -3J \)) and **6 states** with \( S = -1 \) (energies \( E = J \)).

### Step 3: Partition Function
The partition function is given by:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E}.
\]

For the 2 states with \( E = -3J \), each contributes \( e^{3J\beta} \). For the 6 states with \( E = J \), each contributes \( e^{-J\beta} \). Thus:

\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 4: Matching with Options
Comparing with the given options:

- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect).
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct).
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**

Okay, so I've got this problem about the partition function for a system of three spins. Hmm, each spin can be either +1 or -1. The energy is given by E = -J [S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3]. I need to find the partition function Z. And the options are A to D.

Wait, partition function Z is the sum over all possible states of exp(-βE), right? So each state contributes a term to Z based on its energy.

Each spin can be +1 or -1, so for three spins, there are 2^3 =8 possible states. I think I need to list all those states and calculate E for each, then sum the exponentials.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way than enumerating all 8 states. Because that's time-consuming, especially in an exam setting. Let me think about the symmetry or possible groupings.

The energy expression is E = -J (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). Let's see: each term S_i S_j can be either +1 or -1, because each S is ±1.

So S_i S_j = 1 if S_i and S_j are the same, and -1 if different. So each product is either 1 or -1.

So the sum inside the brackets is the sum of three terms: each being ±1. So the total sum can range from -3 to +3, in increments of 2? Well, let's see: the possible sums are when all three are +1 (sum=3), two +1 and one -1 (sum=1), one +1 and two -1 (sum=-1), and all three -1 (sum=-3). So the sum can be 3, 1, -1, -3.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Each S_i S_j can be +1 or -1, so the sum S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 can have different possible values.

I think the sum can take on the values 3, 1, -1, -3. Because, for example, if all three pairs are +1, sum is 3. If two are +1 and one is -1, sum is 1. If one is +1 and two are -1, sum is -1. If all three are -1, sum is -3.

So E is equal to -J multiplied by this sum. So E can be: -J*3, -J*1, -J*(-1)=J, and -J*(-3)=3J.

Wait, that's the E for each possible state. So the energies are E = -3J, -J, J, 3J.

Wait, but I need to count how many states correspond to each energy.

So for each possible sum of the three terms, how many states give that sum?

Let's consider the sum S = S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3.

If S is 3: that means all three terms are +1. So S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Which implies that S1=S2, S2=S3, so all three spins are the same. So all three are +1 or all three are -1.

So there are two states where all three are same: (+1,+1,+1) and (-1,-1,-1). So for S=3, two states.

When sum S=1: which comes from two +1s and one -1. Let's see, each of the three terms can be -1. So how many ways can two of them be +1 and one be -1?

Wait, maybe it's easier to think about the possible ways the sum can be 1. For S=1, each term can be +1 or -1, and the total is 1. So the number of +1 terms minus the number of -1 terms must equal 1. Because S has three terms.

So, suppose there are two +1's and one -1. Because 2*(+1) + 1*(-1) = 2-1=1.

So how many states have two +1's and one -1 in the product terms?

Each product term is S_i S_j, which is 1 if S_i = S_j, else -1.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to think about each state (each set of S1, S2, S3) and compute the sum.

Wait, maybe I can find the number of states that give each sum S.

Let me think: for S=3, as above, two states.

For S=1: how many states?

Alternatively, perhaps think about each state's energy.

Each spin configuration (S1, S2, S3) will have a certain sum S, leading to E = -J S.

Wait, no: E is -J times the sum. So E = -J * (sum of S_i S_j). So the sum is S, so E = -J S.

Wait, but when S=3, E = -3J. When S=1, E=-J. When S=-1, E=J. When S=-3, E=3J.

Wait, that's correct.

So now, for each possible energy, how many states have that E?

So for E = -3J (sum S=3), as earlier, two states.

For E = -J (sum S=1), how many states?

When sum S=1, the number of product terms that are +1 is two, and one is -1.

But each product term S_i S_j being +1 implies S_i = S_j.

So let's think: when S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3 =1, that could be due to two of the products being +1 and one being -1.

Which two products are +1? Let's consider the three possible combinations:

Case 1: S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=-1.

If S1S2=1, S1=S2. S1S3=1: S1=S3. So S1=S2=S3. Then S2S3=1, but our case here is S2S3=-1. Contradiction. So this case is impossible.

Case 2: S1S2=1, S1S3=-1, S2S3=1.

S1=S2, but S1 != S3 (since S1S3=-1). And S2=S3 (because S2S3=1). So S2=S3, but S1=S2 and S1 != S3. Contradiction. So this is impossible.

Case 3: S1S2=-1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1.

So S1 != S2, S1=S3, and S2=S3. So S1=S3, but S2 = S3, which implies S1=S2, but then that would imply S1S2=1, which contradicts S1S2=-1. Hmm, that doesn't work either.

Wait, so maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps I should think about the number of spin configurations leading to each sum.

Wait, another approach: for each of the 8 possible spin states, compute the sum S and count how many states have each S.

Since there are 8 states, maybe listing them would be manageable.

Let me list all possible (S1, S2, S3) and compute S for each.

Each S can be +1 or -1.

1. (1,1,1)
Compute S = (1*1) + (1*1) + (1*1) = 1 +1 +1 =3.

2. (1,1,-1)
S = (1*1) + (1*(-1)) + (1*(-1)) = 1 -1 -1 = -1.

3. (1,-1,1)
S = (1*(-1)) + (1*1) + (-1*1) = (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.

4. (1,-1,-1)
S = (1*(-1)) + (1*(-1)) + (-1*(-1)) = (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.

5. (-1,1,1)
S = (-1*1) + (-1*1) + (1*1) = (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.

6. (-1,1,-1)
S = (-1*1) + (-1*(-1)) + (1*(-1)) = (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.

7. (-1,-1,1)
S = (-1*(-1)) + (-1*1) + (-1*1) =1 -1 -1 = -1.

8. (-1,-1,-1)
S = (-1*(-1)) + (-1*(-1)) + (-1*(-1)) =1 +1 +1 =3.

Wait, that's interesting. So looking at all 8 states:

States 1 and 8 have S=3.

States 2,3,4,5,6,7 have S=-1.

Wait, that can't be right because I thought earlier that when S=3, E=-3J, and when S=-3, E=3J. But according to the calculation, I have states with S=3 and S=-1 only?

Wait, wait no, I must have made a mistake. Let me recompute S for each state.

Wait, let me re-calculate each S:

1. (1,1,1):
S1S2=1, S1S3=1, S2S3=1. Sum 3.

2. (1,1,-1):
S1S2=1, S1S3= (1*(-1))= -1, S2S3= (1*(-1))= -1. Sum 1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

3. (1,-1,1):
S1S2= (1*(-1))= -1, S1S3= (1*1)=1, S2S3= (-1*1)= -1. Sum: -1 +1 + (-1) = -1.

4. (1,-1,-1):
S1S2= -1, S1S3= (1*(-1))= -1, S2S3= (-1*(-1))=1. Sum: -1 + (-1) +1 = -1.

5. (-1,1,1):
S1S2= (-1)(1)= -1, S1S3= (-1)(1)= -1, S2S3= (1*1)=1. Sum: -1 + (-1) +1 = -1.

6. (-1,1,-1):
S1S2= (-1)(1)= -1, S1S3= (-1)(-1)=1, S2S3= (1)(-1)= -1. Sum: -1 +1 + (-1) )= -1.

7. (-1,-1,1):
S1S2= (-1)(-1)=1, S1S3= (-1)(1)= -1, S2S3= (-1)(1)= -1. Sum:1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1.

8. (-1,-1,-1):
All terms are 1. Sum 3.

So from the 8 states:

Two states have sum S=3 (states 1 and 8).

Six states have sum S=-1 (states 2,3,4,5,6,7).

Wait, so where are the other possibilities? I thought earlier that S could be 1 or -3 as well.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the sum for some states. Let me check one more time.

Wait for state (1,1,-1):

S1S2=1*1=1, S1S3=1*(-1)=-1, S2S3=1*(-1)=-1.

Sum: 1 -1 -1 = -1. Correct.

State (-1,-1,1):

S1S2= (-1)(-1)=1, S1S3= (-1)(1)= -1, S2S3= (-1)(1)= -1.

Sum:1 + (-1) + (-1) = -1. Correct.

Wait a second, so according to this, in all three of the product terms, except for the all +1 and all -1 cases, the sum is -1. Hmmm. That's strange. So for the 8 states, sum S can be 3 or -1 only.

Wait, but I thought earlier that the sum could be 3, 1, -1, -3. But according to this, that's not the case. So perhaps my initial approach was wrong.

So what's the mistake here?

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the sum of S_i with the sum of S_i S_j. The sum S_i S_j has different possibilities.

Wait, perhaps the sum can be 3, 1, -1, or -3, but according to the explicit calculation, the sum is either 3 or -1 for all 8 states.

So that's confusing. Because I thought that the sum could have other values.

Alternatively, perhaps my mistake was in the initial assumption that each product term can be either +1 or -1, leading to different sums. But according to the explicit calculation, for three spins, the sum can only be 3 or -1.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me think about another scenario. For example, consider S1=1, S2=1, S3=-1. Sum S is 1*(1) +1*(-1) +1*(-1) = 1-1-1=-1. That's correct.

Another state: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=1. Sum terms: (1*-1) + (1*1) + (-1*1) )= (-1) +1 + (-1) = -1.

Wait, another state: S1=1, S2=-1, S3=-1. Sum terms: (1*-1) + (1*-1) + (-1*-1) )= (-1) + (-1) +1 = -1.

So all the states except the two all-same cases give sum S=-1.

So that means the possible sum S is either 3 (for two states) or -1 (for six states). So E = -J * S. So for S=3, E = -3J. For S=-1, E = J.

Wait, wait no: E = -J * (S1S2 + S1S3 + S2S3). So when S=3, E = -3J. When S=-1, E = -J*(-1) = J.

So the energies are either -3J or J.

So the partition function Z is the sum over all states of exp(-β E).

Each state contributes exp(-β E) to Z.

So for the two states where E = -3J, each contributes exp(3J β).

For the six states where E = J, each contributes exp(-J β).

So Z = 2 * exp(3J β) + 6 * exp(-J β).

Wait, looking at the options:

Option A is 2 e^(-3J β) +6 e^(J β). So that's 2 exp(-3J β) plus 6 exp(J β).

But our calculation gives Z=2 exp(3J β) +6 exp(-J β), which is not any of the options exactly.

Wait, let me look again. The options are:

Option A) Z= 2 e^(-3Jβ)+6e^(Jβ)

B) Z= 2 e^(3Jβ)+6e^(-Jβ)

C) Z= 2e^(2Jβ)+6e^(-2Jβ)

D) Z= 6e^(2Jβ)+2e^(-2Jβ)

Hmm, our calculation gives 2 exp(3J β) + 6 exp(-J β), which is option B.

Wait, so option B is Z=2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ). Which matches.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the energy is E = -J [S1S2 + ... ].

So for the two states with sum S=3, E = -J*(3) = -3J.

So exp(-β E) = exp(3J β), which is correct.

The other six states have sum S=-1, so E = -J*(-1) = J. So exp(-β E) = exp( -J β), which is correct.

So Z=2 e^{3J β} +6 e^{- J β}, which is option B.

Wait, but the options are given as:

A) 2 e^(-3Jβ) +6 e^(Jβ)

B) 2 e^(3Jβ) +6 e^(-Jβ)

Yes, this matches. So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but wait a moment. Let me double-check: when S=-1, E is J, so the exponential term is exp(-β * E) = exp(-β J).

So the partition function is sum over all states of exp(-β E) = sum exp( -β E ).

Which for the two states with E=-3J: exp(3 J β), each.

Six states with E=J: exp(-J β), each.

So Z=2 e^{3J β} +6 e^{-J β}, which is option B.


To solve the problem, we calculate the partition function \( Z \) for a system of three spins \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \), where each spin can take values \( +1 \) or \( -1 \). The energy of the system is given by:

\[
E = -J \left( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \right).
\]

### Step 1: Possible Energy Values
Each term \( S_iS_j \) can be either \( +1 \) (if \( S_i = S_j \)) or \( -1 \) (if \( S_i \neq S_j \)). The sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \) can therefore range from \( -3 \) to \( +3 \), in increments of \( 2 \). This gives possible sums \( S = 3, 1, -1, -3 \). Substituting into the energy expression, the corresponding energies are:

\[
E = -J \cdot S,
\]
so the possible energies are \( E = -3J, -J, J, 3J \).

### Step 2: Counting States for Each Energy
We enumerate all \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible spin configurations and compute the sum \( S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 \) for each:

1. \( (1,1,1) \): \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \), so \( S = 3 \).
2. \( (1,1,-1) \): \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \), so \( S = -1 \).
3. \( (1,-1,1) \): \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = -1 \), so \( S = -1 \).
4. \( (1,-1,-1) \): \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = 1 \), so \( S = -1 \).
5. \( (-1,1,1) \): \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = 1 \), so \( S = -1 \).
6. \( (-1,1,-1) \): \( S_1S_2 = -1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = -1 \), so \( S = -1 \).
7. \( (-1,-1,1) \): \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = -1, S_2S_3 = -1 \), so \( S = -1 \).
8. \( (-1,-1,-1) \): \( S_1S_2 = 1, S_1S_3 = 1, S_2S_3 = 1 \), so \( S = 3 \).

From this, there are **2 states** with \( S = 3 \) (energies \( E = -3J \)) and **6 states** with \( S = -1 \) (energies \( E = J \)).

### Step 3: Partition Function
The partition function is given by:

\[
Z = \sum_{\text{all states}} e^{-\beta E}.
\]

For the 2 states with \( E = -3J \), each contributes \( e^{3J\beta} \). For the 6 states with \( E = J \), each contributes \( e^{-J\beta} \). Thus:

\[
Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta}.
\]

### Step 4: Matching with Options
Comparing with the given options:

- **Option A**: \( Z = 2e^{-3J\beta} + 6e^{J\beta} \) (incorrect).
- **Option B**: \( Z = 2e^{3J\beta} + 6e^{-J\beta} \) (correct).
- **Option C**: \( Z = 2e^{2J\beta} + 6e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect).
- **Option D**: \( Z = 6e^{2J\beta} + 2e^{-2J\beta} \) (incorrect).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
