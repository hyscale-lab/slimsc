Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about a particle in a three-dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator potential. The potential is given by V(r) = ½ m ω² r², which I remember is the form of a harmonic oscillator. The force here obeys Hooke's law, so it's like a 3D version of the simple harmonic oscillator.

The question is asking two things: what's the energy of the third excited state, and how many linearly independent eigenfunctions correspond to that energy eigenvalue. The options are A, B, C, D, each giving an energy and a number.

Hmm, okay. I think I should recall the energy levels for a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator. In the 3D case, the energy levels depend on the quantum numbers nx, ny, nz, but since it's isotropic, the energy depends only on the sum of these. Or wait, I think the energy is given by E = (n_x + n_y + n_z + 3/2) ħω, where n_x, n_y, n_z are non-negative integers (0,1,2,...). But wait, sometimes people use a different notation where the total quantum number is n = n_x + n_y + n_z, and the energy is E = (n + 3/2) ħω. So each state is labeled by n, which is the sum of the individual quantum numbers.

So the energy levels are quantized in terms of n. The ground state is n=0, which would be E = (0 + 3/2) ħω = 3/2 ħω. The first excited state would be n=1, giving E=(1 + 3/2) ħω = 5/2 ħω. Second excited would be n=2, E=(2 + 3/2) ħω = 7/2 ħω. Third excited would be n=3, E=(3 + 3/2) ħω = 9/2 ħω.

Wait, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The ground state is the lowest energy, which is n=0. The first excited state is the next energy level, so that would be the first level above the ground state. So the levels go in order: n=0 (ground), n=1 (first excited), n=2 (second excited), n=3 (third excited). So yes, the third excited state is n=3, so the energy is (3 + 3/2) ħω = (9/2) ħω. So that's the first part of the question.

Now, the second part: how many linearly independent eigenfunctions are possible for the same energy eigenvalue. So that's the degeneracy, the number of states with the same energy. For a 3D isotropic oscillator, the degeneracy (the number of eigenfunctions with the same n) is given by (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The number of states for a given n is equal to the number of ways you can write n as the sum of three non-negative integers, i.e., the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = n.

Ah, I remember that the formula for the number of states is (n + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) ), which is (n + 2 choose 2). So that's (n+2)(n+1)/2. So for n=3, that would be (3+2)(3+1)/2 = (5)(4)/2 = 10. So the degeneracy is 10.

So the energy is (9/2) ħω, and the number of eigenfunctions is 10. Looking at the options, option A is (9/2) ħω, 10. So that's the correct option.

Wait, just making sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. The number of states is the number of ways to have n_x + n_y + n_z = n, where each n_i is a non-negative integer. For n=3, the possible combinations are:

(3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3),
(2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2),
(1,1,1).

Counting them: 3 (from the first set) + 6 (from the second set, because each of the 3! permutations of 2,1,0 gives 6 states) + 1 (from the last) = 10. Yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be option A.

The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, where the potential is given by \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are quantized and depend on the total quantum number \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \), where \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are non-negative integers. The energy of a state is given by:

\[
E = \left(n + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega
\]

The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), the second excited state to \( n = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( n = 3 \). For \( n = 3 \), the energy is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega
\]

The second part of the question asks for the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue. The degeneracy for a given \( n \) in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is determined by the number of ways to write \( n \) as the sum of three non-negative integers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \). This is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(n + 2)(n + 1)}{2}
\]

For \( n = 3 \), the degeneracy is:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(3 + 2)(3 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10
\]

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), and the degeneracy is 10. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), 10**

For a 3D isotropic oscillator, the degeneracy (the number of eigenfunctions with the same n) is given by (n + 1)(n + 2)/2. Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The number of states for a given n is equal to the number of ways you can write n as the sum of three non-negative integers, i.e., the number of non-negative integer solutions to n_x + n_y + n_z = n.

Ah, I remember that the formula for the number of states is (n + 3 -1 choose 3 -1) ), which is (n + 2 choose 2). So that's (n+2)(n+1)/2. So for n=3, that would be (3+2)(3+1)/2 = (5)(4)/2 = 10. So the degeneracy is 10.

So the energy is (9/2) ħω, and the number of eigenfunctions is 10. Looking at the options, option A is (9/2) ħω, 10. So that's the correct option.

Wait, just making sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. The number of states is the number of ways to have n_x + n_y + n_z = n, where each n_i is a non-negative integer. For n=3, the possible combinations are:

(3,0,0), (0,3,0), (0,0,3),
(2,1,0), (2,0,1), (1,2,0), (0,2,1), (1,0,2), (0,1,2),
(1,1,1).

Counting them: 3 (from the first set) + 6 (from the second set, because each of the 3! permutations of 2,1,0 gives 6 states) + 1 (from the last) = 10. Yes, that's correct.

So the answer should be option A.


The problem involves a quantum mechanical system of a particle in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator potential, where the potential is given by \( V(r) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega^2 r^2 \). The energy levels for such a system are quantized and depend on the total quantum number \( n = n_x + n_y + n_z \), where \( n_x, n_y, n_z \) are non-negative integers. The energy of a state is given by:

The ground state corresponds to \( n = 0 \), the first excited state to \( n = 1 \), the second excited state to \( n = 2 \), and the third excited state to \( n = 3 \). For \( n = 3 \), the energy is:

\[
E = \left(3 + \frac{3}{2}\right) \hbar \omega = \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega
\]

The second part of the question asks for the number of linearly independent eigenfunctions (degeneracy) corresponding to the same energy eigenvalue. The degeneracy for a given \( n \) in a 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator is determined by the number of ways to write \( n \) as the sum of three non-negative integers \( n_x, n_y, n_z \). This is given by the formula:

\[

For \( n = 3 \), the degeneracy is:

\[
\text{Degeneracy} = \frac{(3 + 2)(3 + 1)}{2} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} = 10

Thus, the energy of the third excited state is \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), and the degeneracy is 10. Comparing with the options, the correct answer is:

**A) \( \frac{9}{2} \hbar \omega \), 10**
