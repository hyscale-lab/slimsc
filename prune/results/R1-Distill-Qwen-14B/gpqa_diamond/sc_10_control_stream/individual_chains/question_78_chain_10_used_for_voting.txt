Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a certain point and time, given a moving charge. The setup involves a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t), and we're observing the field at a point r. The vector d is from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. 

I remember that potentials are related to the fields, but wait, the potentials are usually based on the retarded time. Oh right, because the electromagnetic fields are retarded—they depend on the position of the charge at an earlier time. So the fields at time t are due to the charge's position and velocity at time tr, where tr is earlier than t.

The scalar potential V is given by Coulomb's law but with a time delay. So V should be something like q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point r. But wait, in terms of d, because d is the vector from the charge's position (at tr) to r, then the distance would be |d|, right? So V would be q/(4πε₀ |d|). But wait, the options have some terms involving d and v. Hmm.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. The scalar potential without considering motion is just Coulomb's potential. But when the charge is moving, the potentials might involve the velocity. Or maybe not for the scalar? I think scalar potential for a moving charge is still mainly due to its position, but the vector potential involves its velocity.

Let me think about the expressions. The scalar potential V is generally (q/(4πε₀)) multiplied by 1/r, where r is the distance from the charge to the point of interest. But since the charge was at a different position at time tr, the distance is |d|, so V would be q/(4πε₀ |d|). But looking at the options, most seem to have terms like (d c - d·v) or (d c + d·v) in the denominator. That must come from considering the retarded time effects, perhaps.

Wait, another approach: the potentials are calculated using the retarded time. The scalar potential V(r, t) for a moving charge is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r - (v t_r))], but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's considering the motion in a different way.

Alternatively, I remember that when a charge is moving, the potentials can be written in terms of the charge's position and velocity. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/|r - r'(t_r)|], and the vector potential A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * [ (r - r')/(|r - r'|)^2 ] evaluated at t_r. Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about this.

Wait, the options are suggesting forms with d and v. Let me think about d: d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the point r. So d = r - r'(t_r), where r' is the charge's position at time tr. Therefore, |d| is the distance between the charge and the observation point at that past time.

Now, looking at the options, option C and D have denominators like (d c - d·v) or (d c + d·v). That seems like it's accounting for the motion—maybe using some kind of Lorentz contraction or relativistic effect. Because when the charge is moving, the potential expressions might involve terms that account for its velocity.

Wait, I think the scalar potential V is indeed q/(4πε₀ |d|). But none of the options present it that way. Let me look again. Option A has V as q/(4πε₀ r), but r is the current position, not the retarded position. Hmm, but d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, so |d| is the distance at that past time. So option C and D have V as (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c ± d·v)). Hmm, I'm not sure why there's a c and a dot product term.

Wait, I think the denominator might be using the concept of (c t_r - d·v), which comes from the relativistic expressions. Let me think: when considering retarded time, the time tr is related to the current time t and the motion of the charge. The formula for tr is approximately (r - (v t))/c, but I'm not sure about the exact form.

Alternatively, the term (d c - d·v) might be appearing in the denominator because it's part of the expression that comes from the relativistic consideration. So V could be q c / [4πε₀ (d c - d·v)], but I'm not exactly sure why.

Wait, another thought. The vector potential A is usually given by (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v / |d|²) * (d × something?), no, wait. Wait, the vector potential A is often (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v × something) but I'm getting confused. Let me think: the standard expression for A is A = (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v(t_r) / |d|²) * (d) ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, no, the vector potential is A = (μ₀ q/(4π)) * [v(t_r) / |d|²] * something. Alternatively, perhaps A is (μ₀ q v(t_r)) / (4π |d|) multiplied by some unit vector. Hmm, I'm a bit shaky on this.

Looking at the options, option C and D have their A as (μ₀ q c v) / (4π (d c ± d·v)). So the denominator is similar to what's in V's denominator. Now, option C says V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), and A is (μ₀ qc v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Wait, but then the units might not match. Let's think: V has units of volts, which is [charge]/[permittivity][length]. A has units of tesla-meter or something like that, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the relation between V and A. In Maxwell's equations, the potentials are related to the fields via E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t and B = ∇×A. But that's more about the fields, not the potentials themselves.

Alternatively, when the charge is moving, the potentials can be expressed in terms of the velocity. The scalar potential is mainly due to the charge's position, and the vector potential is due to its motion. So V would depend on the charge's position (hence, d) and A would involve the velocity (v).

Looking at the options, the only one where V is expressed with something involving d and v is option C and D. Options A and B have V as the static Coulomb potential, which may not account for the motion's effect. But wait, when the charge is moving, does the scalar potential V change? I thought the scalar potential for a moving charge still looks like Coulomb's law, but evaluated at the retarded time. So V would be q/(4πε₀ |d|), but perhaps adjusted for motion in a way that affects the denominator.

Wait, but the options C and D have (d c - d·v) in the denominator. Let me think about that. The denominator would have units of length, since V is 1/length. So (d c) is (m/s * m/s * s) ?? Wait, no. Wait, d is a vector with units of meters. c is m/s. So d c would have units of m²/s. Wait, but that doesn't make sense for a denominator expecting a length. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the denominator should be (d c - (v · d)) which would have units of (m * m/s - (m/s * m)) ) → m²/s. Hmm, but then the denominator is m²/s. Then, when multiplied by c, perhaps? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's (d c - v·d), which would have units of (m * m/s) → m²/s, but that's not matching for a length.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Let me think again: the vector d is from the charge's position at tr to r. So d = r - r'(tr). So the length |d| is the distance between the charge and the observation point at the retarded time.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is |d|^2 - (d · v) + something. Or perhaps it's (d c - v·d) in terms of units, but I'm not getting it. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c t_r - (r·v)/c + ... ) but I'm not remembering the exact expression.

Another approach: The Lorentz invariant expression for the potentials. The scalar potential V and vector potential A must satisfy the Lorenz condition, but I'm not sure how that affects the form.

Wait, I remember that in the case of a charge moving with velocity v, the potentials can be written as:

V(r, t) = [q/(4πε₀)] * [γ] / |r - r'(t_r)| 

But I'm not sure about the gamma factor. Alternatively, perhaps it's expressed in terms of the charge's velocity.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the potentials as derived from the Liénard equations. The potentials for a moving charge are given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ γ (1 + (v · r')/c²) ] / |r - r'|

Wait, I'm not remembering this correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the potentials are given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ (1 - (v²/c²) ) ] / |r - r'(t_r) - (v t_r)|

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator in V is (d c - (d · v)), where d is r - r'(t_r). So if d is the vector from the charge to the observer at time tr, then the denominator would be d c minus the projection of v onto d multiplied by time?

Wait, perhaps the term (d c - (d · v)) represents (distance * c - (velocity component * distance)). Hmm, not quite sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall the general expressions. The scalar potential for a charge in motion is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/|r - r'(t_r)|

Similarly, the vector potential is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π)) * (v(t_r) ) / |r - r'(t_r)|² * (r - r'(t_r))

Wait, but in terms of d, which is r - r'(t_r), then A would be (μ₀ q v(t_r)) / (4π d²) * d. So A would be (μ₀ q v)/(4π d²) * d. But in the options, the denominator has (d c ± d·v), which doesn't directly match this. So perhaps the options have a different approach.

Wait, but option C says V = q c / (4πε₀ (d c - d · v)), and A = (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)). If I compute the units, let's see:

V has units [Charge]/([ε₀][Length]). ε₀ has units [C²·s²/(N·m²)].

Option C's denominator: [d c - d·v] → [m][m/s] (since d is meters, c is m/s, v is m/s). So [d c] is m²/s, [d·v] is m*(m/s) = m²/s. So denominator is m²/s. So V would be [C * c ] / ( ε₀ * (m²/s) ) )

Wait, c is m/s, so [C * (m/s)] / [ (C² s²/(N m²)) * (m²/s) ) ]

This is getting complicated, but perhaps the units would work out. Maybe I should think about the expressions.

Wait, another approach: The potentials are affected by the motion of the charge, so when the charge is moving, the potentials are not just the static potentials but have additional terms. The vector potential is directly proportional to the charge's velocity.

Looking at the options:

Option B: V is Coulomb's law, A is (v/c²) V. Since A has units of (velocity * V) / c² → (m/s * volts ) / (m²/s²) → (m·V·s²/m²) → (V·s²/m), which doesn't seem to match the units of A, which should be T·m (tesla-meter) or (V·s)/(m²) perhaps? I'm not sure. Alternatively, let me compute the units.

Option B: V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀ r). So r is in meters. So V has units [C]/[ε₀][m]. ε₀ has units [C² s²/(N m²)] → [C² s²/(kg m^3)]. So V's unit is [C * kg m^3 ] / [C² s² * m] → [kg m²]/[C s²] → which is volts, correct.

A in option B is (v/c²) V. v is m/s, c² is m²/s². So (m/s) / (m²/s²) ) = s/m. Multiply by V (which is [kg m²/(C s²)]). So (s/m) * [kg m²/(C s²)] ) = kg m/(C s^2 * m) ) → kg/(C s^2) → which is not the same as A's unit (tesla·m). Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working.

Let me think about the general expressions. The scalar potential for a point charge in motion is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [γ (1 + (v·r')/c²)] / |r - r'(t_r)|

Wait, but I'm not confident about the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the retarded time. The retarded time tr is given by t_r = (r - (v t)) / (c^2) ), but not exactly sure.

Wait, more accurately, the retarded time is approximately t_r = (r' - (v (t - t_r)) ) / c. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) (1/(r - (v t_r)) ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think about the potentials in the Lorenz gauge. In that case, the potentials satisfy certain wave equations. But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, another thought: The vector potential A is often proportional to v, so looking at the options, option C and D have A proportional to v. That makes sense. So A should be something like (μ₀ q v)/(4π something), where the denominator depends on d and v.

Looking at the options, option C's A is (μ₀ q c v) / (4π (d c - d · v)). Since the denominator is (d c - d · v), which is (d c - (v · d)), perhaps this expression is correct if c is involved. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, I'm trying to remember the exact expression for the potentials. For a charge moving with velocity v, the vector potential at a point r is given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π ε₀ c²) * (1/( |d| - (v·d)/c² )) ) or something along those lines.

Wait, perhaps the denominator for A is (|d| (1 - (v²/c²)) ) or something similar, but I'm not recalling precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expressions are:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( |d| - (v · d)/c² ) ]

A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π ε₀ c²) * [ 1/( |d| - (v · d)/c² ) ]

But looking at the options, option C has V as (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)) and A as (μ₀ qc v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Wait, but in these expressions, the denominator is (d c - (d · v)). So perhaps |d c - (d · v)| is the same as |d| (c² - v²) or something. Hmm, I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (d · v)) which can be written as d (c) - (v · d) = d (c - (v · d)/d ), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (d · v)) = d (c) - (d · v) = d · (c - v). But this doesn't seem to lead me anywhere.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Let me think about each option:

Option A: V is static Coulomb, A is v squared over c squared times V. This would give A as (v^2/c^2) (q/(4πε₀ r)), which seems dimensionally okay because v^2/c^2 is dimensionless, but why would A depend on v squared? I think A should be linear in v, so option A is probably incorrect.

Option B: V is static Coulomb, A is v/(c squared) times V. So A = (v/c²) V. Since V is q/(4πε₀ r), then A would be (v q)/(4πε₀ c² r). But the units might not match. Because A is a vector with units of (V·s/m) or something, but I'm not sure. This seems possible, but I'm not sure if it's correct.

Option C: V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), and A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)). So the denominator is (d c - d·v). Let's compute the units. 

For V: [q] = Coulombs (C). [4πε₀] has units [C² s²/(N m²)]. So 1/(d c - d·v) has units 1/(m·m/s) )= 1/(m²/s) ) = s/m².

So V = (C * m/s) / [ (C² s²/(N m²)) * (m²/s) ) ] → Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, considering that (d c) has units m * m/s = m²/s, and (d·v) is m*(m/s) = m²/s. So denominator is m²/s. So V is (C * (m/s)) / ( (C² s²/(N m²)) * (m²/s) ) ) → Let's compute this step by step.

Denominator in V: [4πε₀ (d c - d·v)] → (C² s²/(N m²)) * (m²/s) ) → (C² s² * m²) / (N m² s) ) → (C² s) / N.

So V = [ q ] / [ denominator ] → (C) / [ (C² s)/N ] ) → (N)/(C s). Since N = kg m/s², and C is Ampere·seconds, so this becomes (kg m/s²) / (A s² * s) ) → kg m / (A s^3). Wait, volts are kg m²/(A s³), so this doesn't match. So maybe option C's units aren't correct for V.

Option D: V is similar to C but with a plus sign in the denominator. So same denominator units as C, so same problem with units. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the vector potential. The vector potential A must be in units of (V·s) or (T·m²) or something. Let me think.

Option C's A: numerator is μ₀ q c v. μ₀ has units H/m (henrys per meter), which is kg·m/(s²·A²). So:

μ₀ q c v → [kg·m/(s² A²)] * [A s] * [m/s] * [m/s] → Let me compute:

μ₀: kg·m/(s²·A²)
q: A·s
c: m/s
v: m/s

So all together: (kg·m/(s² A²)) * (A s) ) * (m/s) * (m/s) → (kg·m * A s * m * m) ) / (s² A² s^2) )

Wait, simplifying the denominator: s² (from μ₀) * s (from c) * s (from v) ) → s^4.

Numerator: kg·m (from μ₀) * A s (from q) * m (c) * m (v) ) → kg·m^3 · A s.

So overall: (kg·m^3 A s) / (s^4) ) → kg m^3 A / s^3.

Wait, the denominator in A is (d c - d ·v), which has units m²/s. So the entire A is [numerator]/[denominator] → [ kg m^3 A / s^3 ] / [ m²/s ] → kg m A / (s^2).

Hmm, what's the unit for A (vector potential)? It's V·s/m or Tesla·m².

Wait, 1 Tesla is kg/(s²·A), so Tesla·m² is kg·m²/(s²·A).

So if A has units kg m A / s^2, then [kg m A / s^2] → kg m^2/(s^2 A) ) if A is in denominator. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the units don't match, meaning option C and D are incorrect. But I'm getting stuck on units, which isn't helping.

Let me think again conceptually. The scalar potential V is due to the charge's existence, and the vector potential A is due to its motion. So when the charge is moving, the vector potential should be proportional to its velocity.

Looking at the options, only options C and D have A proportional to v, which makes sense. So perhaps the correct answer is among C or D.

Now, the denominator in V for option C is (d c - d·v). Let's think about that. If d is the displacement vector from the charge to the observer at time tr, then d c is the distance multiplied by the speed of light. And (d · v) is the projection of v onto d multiplied by the distance. So the denominator would be d(c) minus (v · d). Hmm, perhaps this is the relativistic term that comes into play when considering the motion.

Wait, another angle: the term (d c - d·v) could be rewritten as d (c - (v · d)/d ). Hmm, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's (d c - (d · v)) = d (c) - (d · v), which is a scalar. Let me think about the units again. d is in meters, c is m/s, v·d is (m/s)*m = m²/s. So d c is m²/s, same as d·v. So their difference is m²/s, which is the same as the denominator in option C. So the denominator has units of m²/s.

So V is [q/(4πε₀)] * (c) / (m²/s) ) → [C/(C² s²/(N m²)) ] * (m²/s) ) → (N m²)/(C s^2) ) * (m²/s) ) → Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting this right.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator (d c - d · v) is actually (c |d| - d · v), which could be written as |d| (c - (v · d)/|d| ), which is |d| (c - v_parallel ), where v_parallel is the component of v along d.

So if the charge is moving away or towards the observer, this term would affect the potential.

But I'm not sure if this line of reasoning is getting me closer to the answer.

Let me think about the vector potential in option C: A = (μ₀ q c v ) / (4π (d c - d · v)).

So, the denominator is (d c - d·v) as before. The numerator includes c and v. So A is proportional to v.

In the standard expression, the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * [something involving r and v].

Hmm. Let me try to recall the general form. The vector potential due to a moving charge is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v(t_r) ) / (|r - r'(t_r)|²) * (r - r'(t_r))

So in terms of d, which is r - r'(t_r), this becomes (μ₀ q v)/(4π d²) * d.

So A = (μ₀ q v d )/(4π d²) ) = (μ₀ q v )/(4π d).

Wait, that can't be right because the units don't match. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a term.

Wait, another approach: The vector potential is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π) * [v(t_r)/ (|d|² - (d · v(t_r))/c² ) ]

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (μ₀ q v(t_r) )/(4π (|d|² (1 - (v²/c²))) )

Wait, but this is getting complicated, and I'm not confident about the exact form.

Given I'm stuck, perhaps I should think about special cases. For instance, when the charge is stationary, v=0. Then, the potentials should reduce to their static forms.

In that case, for V, any terms involving v would vanish. So for option C and D, when v=0, the denominator for V becomes (d c) → so V = qc/(4πε₀ d c) = q/(4πε₀ d), which is correct. So for the scalar potential, when the charge is stationary, it's Coulomb's law. So that's good.

For the vector potential A, when v=0, the numerator becomes zero, so A is zero. That also makes sense because a stationary charge doesn't produce a vector potential. So option C and D seem to handle this correctly.

Now, what about when the charge is moving at speed v much less than c? Let's say v << c, so terms with v/c can be considered small.

For option C, denominator is (d c - d·v). Since v<<c, d c dominates, so denominator ≈ d c. So V ≈ (qc)/(4πε₀ d c) ) = q/(4πε₀ d ), which is correct.

A in option C would be (μ₀ q c v )/(4π d c ) → (μ₀ q v)/(4π d ). Which is μ₀ q v/(4π d ), which matches the non-relativistic expression for A.

Wait, wait, in the non-relativistic case, the vector potential is (μ₀ q v)/(4π d ). So option C's expression when v<<c gives the correct A. So that's promising.

So putting this together, when the charge is moving slowly, option C's expressions reduce to the correct static and non-relativistic forms. That makes me think option C is the correct answer.

But wait, looking back at the options, option C's V denominator is (d c - d·v), and option D's denominator is (d c +d·v). So which one is correct?

Hmm, in the case when the charge is moving directly towards the observer (i.e., d and v are in the same direction), then d·v = |d||v|. So the denominator becomes d c - |d| v = |d| (c - v). Since v is in the same direction as d, and assuming the charge is moving towards us, v would be positive, so denominator is |d| (c - v). Since c is much larger than v, this is positive, so the denominator is positive.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the sign. Let me think about the direction. If the charge is moving towards the observer, then v is in the same direction as d. So d·v = |d| |v| cos(0) = |d| v. So the denominator becomes d c - |d| v = |d| (c - v). So that's positive, as c>v.

If the charge is moving away, then v is opposite to d. So d·v = - |d| v, so denominator is d c - (- |d| v ) = |d| (c + v). Which is even larger. So the denominator is |d| times (c plus or minus v), depending on the direction.

Wait, but in the denominator of V, the term is (d c - d · v). So for a charge moving towards us, the denominator is |d| (c - v), which is smaller than |d| c, making V larger. That seems correct because a moving charge towards us would have a stronger potential, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct denominator is (d c + d · v) for certain cases, but I can't recall.

Wait, another way to think: when the charge is moving away from the observer, the denominator in V would be (d c + d·v) = |d| (c + v). But since v is in the opposite direction of d, d·v is negative, so in that case, the denominator is (d c - (d · v)) = d c - ( - |d| v ) ) = d c + |d| v.

Which increases the denominator, reducing V. That makes sense because if the charge is moving away, the effective distance is increasing, which would decrease the potential.

Wait, but in reality, the potential V would be [q/(4πε₀)] / |d|, which depends only on the distance. So why does the denominator involve (d c - d·v)?

Ah, perhaps it's because the moving charge affects the time it takes for the field to reach the observer, leading to a correction in the denominator.

But I'm still not entirely sure. However, given that in the non-relativistic limit, option C gives the correct result and the denominator structure makes sense, I'm leaning towards option C being correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving charge \( q \), we analyze the given options based on the physical principles and limiting cases.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The scalar potential for a static charge is given by Coulomb's law:  
     \[
     V_{\text{static}} = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 |\vec{d}|},
     \]
     where \( \vec{d} \) is the displacement vector from the charge's position at the retarded time \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \).  
   - For a moving charge, relativistic corrections must be included. The denominator in \( V \) should account for the motion of the charge, leading to a term like \( (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}) \), where \( c \) is the speed of light and \( \vec{v} \) is the velocity of the charge at \( t_r \).  
   - In the non-relativistic limit (\( v \ll c \)), the denominator reduces to \( d c \), and \( V \) recovers the static Coulomb form:  
     \[
     V \approx \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 d}.
     \]
   - Option C correctly incorporates this structure for \( V \), while Option D has an incorrect sign in the denominator.

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is proportional to the charge's velocity \( \vec{v} \) and is generally expressed as:  
     \[
     \vec{A} = \frac{\mu_0 q \vec{v}}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{\vec{d}}{|\vec{d}|^2}.
     \]
   - For a moving charge, relativistic corrections modify the denominator, leading to a term like \( (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}) \).  
   - In the non-relativistic limit (\( v \ll c \)), the denominator reduces to \( d c \), and \( \vec{A} \) simplifies to:  
     \[
     \vec{A} \approx \frac{\mu_0 q \vec{v}}{4\pi d}.
     \]
   - Option C correctly captures this behavior, while Option D again has an incorrect sign in the denominator.

3. **Elimination of Options:**
   - **Option A:** The vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}^2 \), which is inconsistent with the linear dependence on \( \vec{v} \) in the standard expressions.  
   - **Option B:** While \( V \) is correct for a static charge, the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}/c^2 \), which does not match the expected form for a moving charge.  
   - **Option D:** The denominator in both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) includes a \( + \) sign, which is incorrect based on the relativistic corrections required for the potentials.

### Conclusion:
Option C is the only choice that correctly incorporates the relativistic corrections in both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \), matches the expected forms in the static and non-relativistic limits, and ensures consistency with the physical principles.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic potentials. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question is about finding the scalar potential V and vector potential A at a certain point and time, given a moving charge. The setup involves a point charge q moving with some trajectory s(t), and we're observing the field at a point r. The vector d is from where the field was generated (at time tr) to the observation point r. 

I remember that potentials are related to the fields, but wait, the potentials are usually based on the retarded time. Oh right, because the electromagnetic fields are retarded—they depend on the position of the charge at an earlier time. So the fields at time t are due to the charge's position and velocity at time tr, where tr is earlier than t.

The scalar potential V is given by Coulomb's law but with a time delay. So V should be something like q/(4πε₀ r'), where r' is the distance between the charge's position at tr and the observation point r. But wait, in terms of d, because d is the vector from the charge's position (at tr) to r, then the distance would be |d|, right? So V would be q/(4πε₀ |d|). But wait, the options have some terms involving d and v. Hmm.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. The scalar potential without considering motion is just Coulomb's potential. But when the charge is moving, the potentials might involve the velocity. Or maybe not for the scalar? I think scalar potential for a moving charge is still mainly due to its position, but the vector potential involves its velocity.

Let me think about the expressions. The scalar potential V is generally (q/(4πε₀)) multiplied by 1/r, where r is the distance from the charge to the point of interest. But since the charge was at a different position at time tr, the distance is |d|, so V would be q/(4πε₀ |d|). But looking at the options, most seem to have terms like (d c - d·v) or (d c + d·v) in the denominator. That must come from considering the retarded time effects, perhaps.

Wait, another approach: the potentials are calculated using the retarded time. The scalar potential V(r, t) for a moving charge is given by (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/(r - (v t_r))], but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's considering the motion in a different way.

Alternatively, I remember that when a charge is moving, the potentials can be written in terms of the charge's position and velocity. The scalar potential V is (q/(4πε₀)) * [1/|r - r'(t_r)|], and the vector potential A is (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * [ (r - r')/(|r - r'|)^2 ] evaluated at t_r. Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about this.

Wait, the options are suggesting forms with d and v. Let me think about d: d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to the point r. So d = r - r'(t_r), where r' is the charge's position at time tr. Therefore, |d| is the distance between the charge and the observation point at that past time.

Now, looking at the options, option C and D have denominators like (d c - d·v) or (d c + d·v). That seems like it's accounting for the motion—maybe using some kind of Lorentz contraction or relativistic effect. Because when the charge is moving, the potential expressions might involve terms that account for its velocity.

Wait, I think the scalar potential V is indeed q/(4πε₀ |d|). But none of the options present it that way. Let me look again. Option A has V as q/(4πε₀ r), but r is the current position, not the retarded position. Hmm, but d is the vector from the charge's position at tr to r, so |d| is the distance at that past time. So option C and D have V as (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c ± d·v)). Hmm, I'm not sure why there's a c and a dot product term.

Wait, I think the denominator might be using the concept of (c t_r - d·v), which comes from the relativistic expressions. Let me think: when considering retarded time, the time tr is related to the current time t and the motion of the charge. The formula for tr is approximately (r - (v t))/c, but I'm not sure about the exact form.

Alternatively, the term (d c - d·v) might be appearing in the denominator because it's part of the expression that comes from the relativistic consideration. So V could be q c / [4πε₀ (d c - d·v)], but I'm not exactly sure why.

Wait, another thought. The vector potential A is usually given by (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v / |d|²) * (d × something?), no, wait. Wait, the vector potential A is often (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v × something) but I'm getting confused. Let me think: the standard expression for A is A = (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v(t_r) / |d|²) * (d) ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, no, the vector potential is A = (μ₀ q/(4π)) * [v(t_r) / |d|²] * something. Alternatively, perhaps A is (μ₀ q v(t_r)) / (4π |d|) multiplied by some unit vector. Hmm, I'm a bit shaky on this.

Looking at the options, option C and D have their A as (μ₀ q c v) / (4π (d c ± d·v)). So the denominator is similar to what's in V's denominator. Now, option C says V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), and A is (μ₀ qc v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Wait, but then the units might not match. Let's think: V has units of volts, which is [charge]/[permittivity][length]. A has units of tesla-meter or something like that, but I'm not sure.

Wait, let's think about the relation between V and A. In Maxwell's equations, the potentials are related to the fields via E = -∇V - ∂A/∂t and B = ∇×A. But that's more about the fields, not the potentials themselves.

Alternatively, when the charge is moving, the potentials can be expressed in terms of the velocity. The scalar potential is mainly due to the charge's position, and the vector potential is due to its motion. So V would depend on the charge's position (hence, d) and A would involve the velocity (v).

Looking at the options, the only one where V is expressed with something involving d and v is option C and D. Options A and B have V as the static Coulomb potential, which may not account for the motion's effect. But wait, when the charge is moving, does the scalar potential V change? I thought the scalar potential for a moving charge still looks like Coulomb's law, but evaluated at the retarded time. So V would be q/(4πε₀ |d|), but perhaps adjusted for motion in a way that affects the denominator.

Wait, but the options C and D have (d c - d·v) in the denominator. Let me think about that. The denominator would have units of length, since V is 1/length. So (d c) is (m/s * m/s * s) ?? Wait, no. Wait, d is a vector with units of meters. c is m/s. So d c would have units of m²/s. Wait, but that doesn't make sense for a denominator expecting a length. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the denominator should be (d c - (v · d)) which would have units of (m * m/s - (m/s * m)) ) → m²/s. Hmm, but then the denominator is m²/s. Then, when multiplied by c, perhaps? Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's (d c - v·d), which would have units of (m * m/s) → m²/s, but that's not matching for a length.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Let me think again: the vector d is from the charge's position at tr to r. So d = r - r'(tr). So the length |d| is the distance between the charge and the observation point at the retarded time.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is |d|^2 - (d · v) + something. Or perhaps it's (d c - v·d) in terms of units, but I'm not getting it. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (c t_r - (r·v)/c + ... ) but I'm not remembering the exact expression.

Another approach: The Lorentz invariant expression for the potentials. The scalar potential V and vector potential A must satisfy the Lorenz condition, but I'm not sure how that affects the form.

Wait, I remember that in the case of a charge moving with velocity v, the potentials can be written as:

V(r, t) = [q/(4πε₀)] * [γ] / |r - r'(t_r)| 

But I'm not sure about the gamma factor. Alternatively, perhaps it's expressed in terms of the charge's velocity.

Wait, maybe it's better to think about the potentials as derived from the Liénard equations. The potentials for a moving charge are given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ γ (1 + (v · r')/c²) ] / |r - r'|

Wait, I'm not remembering this correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the potentials are given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ (1 - (v²/c²) ) ] / |r - r'(t_r) - (v t_r)|

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator in V is (d c - (d · v)), where d is r - r'(t_r). So if d is the vector from the charge to the observer at time tr, then the denominator would be d c minus the projection of v onto d multiplied by time?

Wait, perhaps the term (d c - (d · v)) represents (distance * c - (velocity component * distance)). Hmm, not quite sure.

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall the general expressions. The scalar potential for a charge in motion is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * 1/|r - r'(t_r)|

Similarly, the vector potential is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q/(4π)) * (v(t_r) ) / |r - r'(t_r)|² * (r - r'(t_r))

Wait, but in terms of d, which is r - r'(t_r), then A would be (μ₀ q v(t_r)) / (4π d²) * d. So A would be (μ₀ q v)/(4π d²) * d. But in the options, the denominator has (d c ± d·v), which doesn't directly match this. So perhaps the options have a different approach.

Wait, but option C says V = q c / (4πε₀ (d c - d · v)), and A = (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)). If I compute the units, let's see:

V has units [Charge]/([ε₀][Length]). ε₀ has units [C²·s²/(N·m²)].

Option C's denominator: [d c - d·v] → [m][m/s] (since d is meters, c is m/s, v is m/s). So [d c] is m²/s, [d·v] is m*(m/s) = m²/s. So denominator is m²/s. So V would be [C * c ] / ( ε₀ * (m²/s) ) )

Wait, c is m/s, so [C * (m/s)] / [ (C² s²/(N m²)) * (m²/s) ) ]

This is getting complicated, but perhaps the units would work out. Maybe I should think about the expressions.

Wait, another approach: The potentials are affected by the motion of the charge, so when the charge is moving, the potentials are not just the static potentials but have additional terms. The vector potential is directly proportional to the charge's velocity.

Looking at the options:

Option B: V is Coulomb's law, A is (v/c²) V. Since A has units of (velocity * V) / c² → (m/s * volts ) / (m²/s²) → (m·V·s²/m²) → (V·s²/m), which doesn't seem to match the units of A, which should be T·m (tesla-meter) or (V·s)/(m²) perhaps? I'm not sure. Alternatively, let me compute the units.

Option B: V(r,t) = q/(4πε₀ r). So r is in meters. So V has units [C]/[ε₀][m]. ε₀ has units [C² s²/(N m²)] → [C² s²/(kg m^3)]. So V's unit is [C * kg m^3 ] / [C² s² * m] → [kg m²]/[C s²] → which is volts, correct.

A in option B is (v/c²) V. v is m/s, c² is m²/s². So (m/s) / (m²/s²) ) = s/m. Multiply by V (which is [kg m²/(C s²)]). So (s/m) * [kg m²/(C s²)] ) = kg m/(C s^2 * m) ) → kg/(C s^2) → which is not the same as A's unit (tesla·m). Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't working.

Let me think about the general expressions. The scalar potential for a point charge in motion is given by:

V(r, t) = (q/(4πε₀)) * [γ (1 + (v·r')/c²)] / |r - r'(t_r)|

Wait, but I'm not confident about the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the retarded time. The retarded time tr is given by t_r = (r - (v t)) / (c^2) ), but not exactly sure.

Wait, more accurately, the retarded time is approximately t_r = (r' - (v (t - t_r)) ) / c. But this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the scalar potential V is given by (q/(4πε₀)) (1/(r - (v t_r)) ), but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe I should think about the potentials in the Lorenz gauge. In that case, the potentials satisfy certain wave equations. But I'm not sure if that's helpful here.

Wait, another thought: The vector potential A is often proportional to v, so looking at the options, option C and D have A proportional to v. That makes sense. So A should be something like (μ₀ q v)/(4π something), where the denominator depends on d and v.

Looking at the options, option C's A is (μ₀ q c v) / (4π (d c - d · v)). Since the denominator is (d c - d · v), which is (d c - (v · d)), perhaps this expression is correct if c is involved. But I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, I'm trying to remember the exact expression for the potentials. For a charge moving with velocity v, the vector potential at a point r is given by A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π ε₀ c²) * (1/( |d| - (v·d)/c² )) ) or something along those lines.

Wait, perhaps the denominator for A is (|d| (1 - (v²/c²)) ) or something similar, but I'm not recalling precisely.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct expressions are:

V = (q/(4πε₀)) * [ 1/( |d| - (v · d)/c² ) ]

A = (μ₀ q v)/(4π ε₀ c²) * [ 1/( |d| - (v · d)/c² ) ]

But looking at the options, option C has V as (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)) and A as (μ₀ qc v)/(4π (d c - d·v)).

Wait, but in these expressions, the denominator is (d c - (d · v)). So perhaps |d c - (d · v)| is the same as |d| (c² - v²) or something. Hmm, I'm not quite getting it.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (d · v)) which can be written as d (c) - (v · d) = d (c - (v · d)/d ), but that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is (d c - (d · v)) = d (c) - (d · v) = d · (c - v). But this doesn't seem to lead me anywhere.

Hmm, I'm not making much progress. Let me think about each option:

Option A: V is static Coulomb, A is v squared over c squared times V. This would give A as (v^2/c^2) (q/(4πε₀ r)), which seems dimensionally okay because v^2/c^2 is dimensionless, but why would A depend on v squared? I think A should be linear in v, so option A is probably incorrect.

Option B: V is static Coulomb, A is v/(c squared) times V. So A = (v/c²) V. Since V is q/(4πε₀ r), then A would be (v q)/(4πε₀ c² r). But the units might not match. Because A is a vector with units of (V·s/m) or something, but I'm not sure. This seems possible, but I'm not sure if it's correct.

Option C: V is (qc)/(4πε₀ (d c - d·v)), and A is (μ₀ q c v)/(4π (d c - d·v)). So the denominator is (d c - d·v). Let's compute the units. 

For V: [q] = Coulombs (C). [4πε₀] has units [C² s²/(N m²)]. So 1/(d c - d·v) has units 1/(m·m/s) )= 1/(m²/s) ) = s/m².

So V = (C * m/s) / [ (C² s²/(N m²)) * (m²/s) ) ] → Hmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, considering that (d c) has units m * m/s = m²/s, and (d·v) is m*(m/s) = m²/s. So denominator is m²/s. So V is (C * (m/s)) / ( (C² s²/(N m²)) * (m²/s) ) ) → Let's compute this step by step.

Denominator in V: [4πε₀ (d c - d·v)] → (C² s²/(N m²)) * (m²/s) ) → (C² s² * m²) / (N m² s) ) → (C² s) / N.

So V = [ q ] / [ denominator ] → (C) / [ (C² s)/N ] ) → (N)/(C s). Since N = kg m/s², and C is Ampere·seconds, so this becomes (kg m/s²) / (A s² * s) ) → kg m / (A s^3). Wait, volts are kg m²/(A s³), so this doesn't match. So maybe option C's units aren't correct for V.

Option D: V is similar to C but with a plus sign in the denominator. So same denominator units as C, so same problem with units. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the vector potential. The vector potential A must be in units of (V·s) or (T·m²) or something. Let me think.

Option C's A: numerator is μ₀ q c v. μ₀ has units H/m (henrys per meter), which is kg·m/(s²·A²). So:

μ₀ q c v → [kg·m/(s² A²)] * [A s] * [m/s] * [m/s] → Let me compute:

μ₀: kg·m/(s²·A²)
q: A·s
c: m/s
v: m/s

So all together: (kg·m/(s² A²)) * (A s) ) * (m/s) * (m/s) → (kg·m * A s * m * m) ) / (s² A² s^2) )

Wait, simplifying the denominator: s² (from μ₀) * s (from c) * s (from v) ) → s^4.

Numerator: kg·m (from μ₀) * A s (from q) * m (c) * m (v) ) → kg·m^3 · A s.

So overall: (kg·m^3 A s) / (s^4) ) → kg m^3 A / s^3.

Wait, the denominator in A is (d c - d ·v), which has units m²/s. So the entire A is [numerator]/[denominator] → [ kg m^3 A / s^3 ] / [ m²/s ] → kg m A / (s^2).

Hmm, what's the unit for A (vector potential)? It's V·s/m or Tesla·m².

Wait, 1 Tesla is kg/(s²·A), so Tesla·m² is kg·m²/(s²·A).

So if A has units kg m A / s^2, then [kg m A / s^2] → kg m^2/(s^2 A) ) if A is in denominator. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the units don't match, meaning option C and D are incorrect. But I'm getting stuck on units, which isn't helping.

Let me think again conceptually. The scalar potential V is due to the charge's existence, and the vector potential A is due to its motion. So when the charge is moving, the vector potential should be proportional to its velocity.

Looking at the options, only options C and D have A proportional to v, which makes sense. So perhaps the correct answer is among C or D.

Now, the denominator in V for option C is (d c - d·v). Let's think about that. If d is the displacement vector from the charge to the observer at time tr, then d c is the distance multiplied by the speed of light. And (d · v) is the projection of v onto d multiplied by the distance. So the denominator would be d(c) minus (v · d). Hmm, perhaps this is the relativistic term that comes into play when considering the motion.

Wait, another angle: the term (d c - d·v) could be rewritten as d (c - (v · d)/d ). Hmm, but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps it's (d c - (d · v)) = d (c) - (d · v), which is a scalar. Let me think about the units again. d is in meters, c is m/s, v·d is (m/s)*m = m²/s. So d c is m²/s, same as d·v. So their difference is m²/s, which is the same as the denominator in option C. So the denominator has units of m²/s.

So V is [q/(4πε₀)] * (c) / (m²/s) ) → [C/(C² s²/(N m²)) ] * (m²/s) ) → (N m²)/(C s^2) ) * (m²/s) ) → Hmm, perhaps I'm not getting this right.

Alternatively, perhaps the denominator (d c - d · v) is actually (c |d| - d · v), which could be written as |d| (c - (v · d)/|d| ), which is |d| (c - v_parallel ), where v_parallel is the component of v along d.

So if the charge is moving away or towards the observer, this term would affect the potential.

But I'm not sure if this line of reasoning is getting me closer to the answer.

Let me think about the vector potential in option C: A = (μ₀ q c v ) / (4π (d c - d · v)).

So, the denominator is (d c - d·v) as before. The numerator includes c and v. So A is proportional to v.

In the standard expression, the vector potential A is given by (μ₀ q v)/(4π) * [something involving r and v].

Hmm. Let me try to recall the general form. The vector potential due to a moving charge is:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π) * (v(t_r) ) / (|r - r'(t_r)|²) * (r - r'(t_r))

So in terms of d, which is r - r'(t_r), this becomes (μ₀ q v)/(4π d²) * d.

So A = (μ₀ q v d )/(4π d²) ) = (μ₀ q v )/(4π d).

Wait, that can't be right because the units don't match. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a term.

Wait, another approach: The vector potential is given by:

A(r, t) = (μ₀ q)/(4π) * [v(t_r)/ (|d|² - (d · v(t_r))/c² ) ]

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's (μ₀ q v(t_r) )/(4π (|d|² (1 - (v²/c²))) )

Wait, but this is getting complicated, and I'm not confident about the exact form.

Given I'm stuck, perhaps I should think about special cases. For instance, when the charge is stationary, v=0. Then, the potentials should reduce to their static forms.

In that case, for V, any terms involving v would vanish. So for option C and D, when v=0, the denominator for V becomes (d c) → so V = qc/(4πε₀ d c) = q/(4πε₀ d), which is correct. So for the scalar potential, when the charge is stationary, it's Coulomb's law. So that's good.

For the vector potential A, when v=0, the numerator becomes zero, so A is zero. That also makes sense because a stationary charge doesn't produce a vector potential. So option C and D seem to handle this correctly.

Now, what about when the charge is moving at speed v much less than c? Let's say v << c, so terms with v/c can be considered small.

For option C, denominator is (d c - d·v). Since v<<c, d c dominates, so denominator ≈ d c. So V ≈ (qc)/(4πε₀ d c) ) = q/(4πε₀ d ), which is correct.

A in option C would be (μ₀ q c v )/(4π d c ) → (μ₀ q v)/(4π d ). Which is μ₀ q v/(4π d ), which matches the non-relativistic expression for A.

Wait, wait, in the non-relativistic case, the vector potential is (μ₀ q v)/(4π d ). So option C's expression when v<<c gives the correct A. So that's promising.

So putting this together, when the charge is moving slowly, option C's expressions reduce to the correct static and non-relativistic forms. That makes me think option C is the correct answer.

But wait, looking back at the options, option C's V denominator is (d c - d·v), and option D's denominator is (d c +d·v). So which one is correct?

Hmm, in the case when the charge is moving directly towards the observer (i.e., d and v are in the same direction), then d·v = |d||v|. So the denominator becomes d c - |d| v = |d| (c - v). Since v is in the same direction as d, and assuming the charge is moving towards us, v would be positive, so denominator is |d| (c - v). Since c is much larger than v, this is positive, so the denominator is positive.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the sign. Let me think about the direction. If the charge is moving towards the observer, then v is in the same direction as d. So d·v = |d| |v| cos(0) = |d| v. So the denominator becomes d c - |d| v = |d| (c - v). So that's positive, as c>v.

If the charge is moving away, then v is opposite to d. So d·v = - |d| v, so denominator is d c - (- |d| v ) = |d| (c + v). Which is even larger. So the denominator is |d| times (c plus or minus v), depending on the direction.

Wait, but in the denominator of V, the term is (d c - d · v). So for a charge moving towards us, the denominator is |d| (c - v), which is smaller than |d| c, making V larger. That seems correct because a moving charge towards us would have a stronger potential, but I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct denominator is (d c + d · v) for certain cases, but I can't recall.

Wait, another way to think: when the charge is moving away from the observer, the denominator in V would be (d c + d·v) = |d| (c + v). But since v is in the opposite direction of d, d·v is negative, so in that case, the denominator is (d c - (d · v)) = d c - ( - |d| v ) ) = d c + |d| v.

Which increases the denominator, reducing V. That makes sense because if the charge is moving away, the effective distance is increasing, which would decrease the potential.

Wait, but in reality, the potential V would be [q/(4πε₀)] / |d|, which depends only on the distance. So why does the denominator involve (d c - d·v)?

Ah, perhaps it's because the moving charge affects the time it takes for the field to reach the observer, leading to a correction in the denominator.

But I'm still not entirely sure. However, given that in the non-relativistic limit, option C gives the correct result and the denominator structure makes sense, I'm leaning towards option C being correct.


To determine the scalar potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \) and vector potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \) for a moving charge \( q \), we analyze the given options based on the physical principles and limiting cases.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Scalar Potential \( V(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The scalar potential for a static charge is given by Coulomb's law:  
     \[
     V_{\text{static}} = \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 |\vec{d}|},
     \]
     where \( \vec{d} \) is the displacement vector from the charge's position at the retarded time \( t_r \) to the observation point \( \vec{r} \).  
   - For a moving charge, relativistic corrections must be included. The denominator in \( V \) should account for the motion of the charge, leading to a term like \( (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}) \), where \( c \) is the speed of light and \( \vec{v} \) is the velocity of the charge at \( t_r \).  
   - In the non-relativistic limit (\( v \ll c \)), the denominator reduces to \( d c \), and \( V \) recovers the static Coulomb form:  
     \[
     V \approx \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 d}.
     \]
   - Option C correctly incorporates this structure for \( V \), while Option D has an incorrect sign in the denominator.

2. **Vector Potential \( \vec{A}(\vec{r}, t) \):**
   - The vector potential is proportional to the charge's velocity \( \vec{v} \) and is generally expressed as:  
     \[
     \vec{A} = \frac{\mu_0 q \vec{v}}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{\vec{d}}{|\vec{d}|^2}.
     \]
   - For a moving charge, relativistic corrections modify the denominator, leading to a term like \( (d c - \vec{d} \cdot \vec{v}) \).  
   - In the non-relativistic limit (\( v \ll c \)), the denominator reduces to \( d c \), and \( \vec{A} \) simplifies to:  
     \[
     \vec{A} \approx \frac{\mu_0 q \vec{v}}{4\pi d}.
     \]
   - Option C correctly captures this behavior, while Option D again has an incorrect sign in the denominator.

3. **Elimination of Options:**
   - **Option A:** The vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}^2 \), which is inconsistent with the linear dependence on \( \vec{v} \) in the standard expressions.  
   - **Option B:** While \( V \) is correct for a static charge, the vector potential \( \vec{A} \) is proportional to \( \vec{v}/c^2 \), which does not match the expected form for a moving charge.  
   - **Option D:** The denominator in both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \) includes a \( + \) sign, which is incorrect based on the relativistic corrections required for the potentials.

### Conclusion:
Option C is the only choice that correctly incorporates the relativistic corrections in both \( V \) and \( \vec{A} \), matches the expected forms in the static and non-relativistic limits, and ensures consistency with the physical principles.

**Answer: C**
