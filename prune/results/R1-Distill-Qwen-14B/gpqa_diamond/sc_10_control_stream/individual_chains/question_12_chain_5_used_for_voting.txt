Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: Find the KE of the product particles in the decay Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Pi(+) is stationary. The rest masses are given as 139.6 MeV for Pi(+) and 105.7 MeV for mu(+). The options are A to D, each giving two KE values.

Hmm, right. So Pi meson is at rest and decays into a muon and a neutrino. I remember that in particle physics, neutrinos are neutral and have very little mass, often considered massless in these kinds of problems. But wait, wait, sometimes they might have a negligible mass, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. I'll have to think about that.

So, the decay is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. Since Pi is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the total momentum must also be zero, so the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That means they have the same magnitude of momentum but opposite directions.

But wait, neutrino's mass is negligible, so its energy would be approximately its momentum (since for massless particles, E = pc). The muon has mass, so its energy would be sqrt(p²c⁴ + m²c^4), but since we're using MeV and c=1 in these units, the energy would be sqrt(p² + m_mu²).

Wait, but I'm getting into some confusion here. Let's think about conservation of energy and momentum. The Pi+ is at rest, so its total energy is its rest energy, which is m_pi c². But since c is 1 in these units, it's 139.6 MeV.

The total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The energy of the muon is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero (or negligible). 

But wait, the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so in the rest frame of the pion, the muon must have some kinetic energy. Let me think about the conservation equations.

Energy conservation: m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu.

Momentum conservation: The pion is at rest, so the total momentum is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu.

Since neutrino's energy is E_nu = p_nu c (as it's massless), and the muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). 

Wait, but since c=1 in the units used, it simplifies. So E_mu = sqrt(p_mu^2 + m_mu^2), and E_nu = p_nu. But since p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude), because they are opposite, so p_mu = p_nu = p.

Wait, no, because the neutrino's momentum is opposite. So if the muon has momentum p in some direction, the neutrino has p in the opposite direction. So their magnitudes are the same.

So, the energy equation becomes:

m_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2)

E_nu = p (since E = pc for massless particles).

So, plugging into the energy equation:

139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p.

Hmm, that's an equation in one variable, p. Let me write that down clearly.

139.6 = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p.

I can rearrange this equation to solve for p.

Let me let x = p for simplicity.

So,

139.6 = sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x.

I can rearrange:

sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x.

Now, square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 x + x^2.

So,

x² + 105.7² = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

Subtract x² from both sides:

105.7² = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x.

Let me compute 105.7 squared and 139.6 squared.

105.7^2: Let's see, 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and 2 * 100 *5.7 = 1140. So 105.7^2 = (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

139.6^2: Let's calculate 140^2 is 19600. So 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 * 139.6 x.

Let me rearrange:

2 * 139.6 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 minus 11172.49.

19488.16 - 11172.49: Let's compute.

19488.16 - 11172.49 = ?

19488.16
-11172.49
= 8315.67.

So,

2 *139.6 x = 8315.67

Multiply 2 *139.6 = 279.2.

So,

279.2 x = 8315.67.

Solve for x:

x = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that.

8315.67 ÷ 279.2 → Let's see.

279.2 × 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67.

So 30 would be 8376, which is 8376 -8315.67=60.33 more. So approximate 29.9.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Compute 279.2 × 29.8:

279.2 ×30 would be 8376, but subtract 279.2 ×0.2 → 55.84. So 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16.

Wait, but 8320.16 is larger than 8315.67. Hmm.

Wait, 279.2 ×29.8 = ?

Wait, 29.8 = 30 - 0.2.

So 279.2 *30 = 8376.

279.2 *0.2=55.84.

So 279.2 *29.8 = 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16.

But our target is 8315.67, which is 8315.67 -8320.16 = -4.49 less than 8320.16. So 29.8 gives a product 4.49 higher than needed.

So perhaps x is approximately 29.8 minus (4.49 /279.2) → 4.49 / ~279 ≈ 0.016.

So x ≈29.8 - 0.016 ≈29.784.

Wait, that's approx 29.78.

But wait, wait, perhaps I should compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 ×29.78.

Wait, 279.2 ×29 = 279.2 *30=8376, minus 279.2 =8376-279.2=8096.8.

Wait, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, 29 ×279.2 = ?

Wait, 27 ×279.2 is 279.2 ×20=5584, 279.2 ×7=1954.4 → sum is 5584+1954.4=7538.4.

Plus 279.2 ×0.78: Wait, perhaps I should do this another way.

Alternatively, perhaps approximate the division.

279.2 × x =8315.67.

x=8315.67 /279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 ÷279.2.

Dividing both numerator and denominator by 1000: 8.31567 ÷0.2792.

What's 0.2792 ×29.78 ≈8.31567?

Wait, 0.2792 ×30 = 8.376.

But 8.376 is larger than 8.31567.

So x is about 29.78, as before.

So p = x ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but let me get more accurate.

Wait, 0.2792 × 29.78 = ?

Wait, 0.2792 ×30 is 8.376.

But 0.2792 * (30 -0.22) = 8.376 - (0.2792 *0.22)= 8.376 -0.061424=8.314576.

Which is about 8.314576, which is less than 8.31567 by 0.001094.

So to get the 0.001094, how much more do I need to add?

Each 0.001 in x contributes 0.2792 *0.001 =0.0002792.

We need to cover 0.001094, so 0.001094 /0.0002792 ≈ 3.91.

So x ≈29.78 + 0.00391 ≈29.7839.

So p ≈29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but let me compute 279.2 ×29.7839.

279.2 *29 = 279.2 *30 =8376 minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8.

Then 279.2 *0.7839.

0.7839 is 0.7 +0.08+0.0039.

0.7*279.2=195.44.

0.08*279.2=22.336.

0.0039*279.2≈1.08888.

Adding them: 195.44 +22.336=217.776 +1.08888≈218.86488.

So 29.7839 → 29 *279.2=8096.8, plus 0.7839 *279.2≈218.86488. So total is 8096.8 +218.86488=8315.66488 MeV.

Which is very close to 8315.67, so x is approximately 29.784 MeV/c.

So p ≈29.784 MeV/c.

Now, knowing that p is approximately 29.784 MeV/c, let's compute the energies.

E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.784^2:

Let me compute 30^2=900. 29.784 is 0.216 less than 30.

So (30 -0.216)^2 =30² - 2*30*0.216 +0.216²=900 -12.96 +0.046656≈887.086656.

So p^2≈887.086656.

m_mu^2=105.7^2=11172.49.

So E_mu^2 = 887.086656 +11172.49 = 12059.576656.

So E_mu = sqrt(12059.576656) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, because 109.8^2 = (109.8)^2 = (100 + 9.8)^2 = 10^4 + 2*100*9.8 +9.8^2 =10000 + 1960 +96.04= 119,960? Wait, wait, no, that would be 10000 + 1960=11960, plus 96.04=12056.04.

Hmm, E_mu^2 is 12059.576, which is a bit higher than 12056.04. So E_mu is a bit higher than 109.8.

So sqrt(12059.576):

109.8^2=12056.04.

12059.576 -12056.04=3.536.

So delta x for sqrt is approximately 3.536/(2*109.8) )=3.536/(219.6)≈0.0161.

So E_mu≈109.8 +0.0161≈109.816 MeV.

So E_mu≈109.816 MeV.

E_nu = p =29.784 MeV.

Now, the energies of the muon and the neutrino are about 109.816 MeV and 29.784 MeV, respectively.

The rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu = 109.816 -105.7 =4.116 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is all kinetic, since its rest mass is zero. So KE_nu =29.784 MeV.

Now, looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Wait, let me see the options.

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

So the KE of the muon is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino is about 29.8 MeV. That seems to match.

So the options are:

A) 2.84, 26.8 → seems too low.

B) 7.2, 32.8 → maybe not.

C) 3.52, 20.8 → no.

D) 4.12,29.8 → yes.

So the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but let me double-check in case I made any mistakes.

Wait, another way to approach this is to consider that in the rest frame of the pion, the muon and neutrino share the energy. Since pion mass is 139.6, and muon's rest mass is 105.7, the available energy is 139.6 -105.7 =33.9 MeV. But that's not all, because when the muon is moving, it has kinetic energy.

Wait, no. Because the available energy is the pion's rest energy, so the sum of the muon and neutrino's rest masses plus their kinetic energies must equal the pion's rest energy. But in this case, the neutrino's rest mass is zero. So the muon's rest energy plus its kinetic energy plus the neutrino's energy (which is all kinetic) equals 139.6 MeV.

Wait, but how does that compare with what I did earlier? Let me think. The muon's energy is 105.7 + KE_mu, and the neutrino's energy is KE_nu. So:

105.7 + KE_mu + KE_nu = 139.6 → KE_mu + KE_nu = 33.9 MeV.

But from earlier calculations, KE_mu is about 4.12 MeV, KE_nu about 29.784 MeV, which adds up to about 33.9 MeV. So that checks out.

So the numbers are correct.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary positively charged pion, **π⁺**, into a positively charged muon, **μ⁺**, and a neutrino, **ν**. The rest masses are given as follows:  
- Rest mass of **π⁺**: \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \)  
- Rest mass of **μ⁺**: \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)  

### Key Equations and Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved. Since the pion is stationary, its total energy is its rest energy:  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
   \]  

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   The pion is stationary, so the total momentum before the decay is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum:  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]  

3. **Energy of the Muon**:  
   The muon's energy is given by:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2}.
   \]  

4. **Energy of the Neutrino**:  
   The neutrino is massless, so its energy is equal to its momentum:  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]  

### Solving for Momentum and Energies
Using the conservation equations, we substitute \( p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p \) into the energy conservation equation:  
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p.
\]  
Rearranging and solving for \( p \):  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - p.
\]  
Squaring both sides:  
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]  
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p + p^2.
\]  
Canceling \( p^2 \) and solving for \( p \):  
\[
279.2p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]  
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV/c}.
\]  

Now, calculate the energies:  
- **Energy of the muon**:  
  \[
  E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.784^2 + 105.7^2}.
  \]  
  Compute \( 29.784^2 \approx 887.09 \) and \( 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \):  
  \[
  E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.09 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.58} \approx 109.816 \, \text{MeV}.
  \]  
  The kinetic energy of the muon is:  
  \[
  KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.816 - 105.7 = 4.116 \, \text{MeV}.
  \]  

- **Energy of the neutrino**:  
  \[
  E_{\nu} = p = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
  \]  
  Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its energy:  
  \[
  KE_{\nu} = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
  \]  

### Matching with Options
The kinetic energies are approximately:  
- \( KE_{\mu} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \)  
- \( KE_{\nu} \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \)  

This matches **Option D**.  

ANSWER: D

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: Find the KE of the product particles in the decay Pi(+) = mu(+) + nu. Pi(+) is stationary. The rest masses are given as 139.6 MeV for Pi(+) and 105.7 MeV for mu(+). The options are A to D, each giving two KE values.

Hmm, right. So Pi meson is at rest and decays into a muon and a neutrino. I remember that in particle physics, neutrinos are neutral and have very little mass, often considered massless in these kinds of problems. But wait, wait, sometimes they might have a negligible mass, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. I'll have to think about that.

So, the decay is Pi+ → mu+ + nu. Since Pi is at rest, the total momentum before decay is zero. After decay, the total momentum must also be zero, so the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta. That means they have the same magnitude of momentum but opposite directions.

But wait, neutrino's mass is negligible, so its energy would be approximately its momentum (since for massless particles, E = pc). The muon has mass, so its energy would be sqrt(p²c⁴ + m²c^4), but since we're using MeV and c=1 in these units, the energy would be sqrt(p² + m_mu²).

Wait, but I'm getting into some confusion here. Let's think about conservation of energy and momentum. The Pi+ is at rest, so its total energy is its rest energy, which is m_pi c². But since c is 1 in these units, it's 139.6 MeV.

The total energy after decay is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino. The energy of the muon is its rest mass plus its kinetic energy. The neutrino's energy is just its kinetic energy since its rest mass is zero (or negligible). 

But wait, the muon's rest mass is 105.7 MeV, so in the rest frame of the pion, the muon must have some kinetic energy. Let me think about the conservation equations.

Energy conservation: m_pi c² = E_mu + E_nu.

Momentum conservation: The pion is at rest, so the total momentum is zero. Therefore, the momenta of the muon and neutrino must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. So p_mu = -p_nu.

Since neutrino's energy is E_nu = p_nu c (as it's massless), and the muon's energy is E_mu = sqrt( (p_mu c)^2 + (m_mu c²)^2 ). 

Wait, but since c=1 in the units used, it simplifies. So E_mu = sqrt(p_mu^2 + m_mu^2), and E_nu = p_nu. But since p_mu = p_nu (in magnitude), because they are opposite, so p_mu = p_nu = p.

Wait, no, because the neutrino's momentum is opposite. So if the muon has momentum p in some direction, the neutrino has p in the opposite direction. So their magnitudes are the same.

So, the energy equation becomes:

m_pi = E_mu + E_nu.

E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2)

E_nu = p (since E = pc for massless particles).

So, plugging into the energy equation:

139.6 = sqrt(p^2 + (105.7)^2) + p.

Hmm, that's an equation in one variable, p. Let me write that down clearly.

139.6 = sqrt(p² + (105.7)^2) + p.

I can rearrange this equation to solve for p.

Let me let x = p for simplicity.

So,

139.6 = sqrt(x² + 105.7²) + x.

I can rearrange:

sqrt(x² + 105.7²) = 139.6 - x.

Now, square both sides:

x² + (105.7)^2 = (139.6 - x)^2.

Expanding the right side:

(139.6)^2 - 2 * 139.6 x + x^2.

So,

x² + 105.7² = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x + x².

Subtract x² from both sides:

105.7² = (139.6)^2 - 2*139.6 x.

Let me compute 105.7 squared and 139.6 squared.

105.7^2: Let's see, 100^2 is 10000, 5.7^2 is 32.49, and 2 * 100 *5.7 = 1140. So 105.7^2 = (100+5.7)^2 = 10000 + 1140 + 32.49 = 11172.49 MeV².

139.6^2: Let's calculate 140^2 is 19600. So 139.6 is 0.4 less than 140. So (140 - 0.4)^2 = 140² - 2*140*0.4 + 0.4² = 19600 - 112 + 0.16 = 19488.16 MeV².

So,

11172.49 = 19488.16 - 2 * 139.6 x.

Let me rearrange:

2 * 139.6 x = 19488.16 - 11172.49.

Compute 19488.16 minus 11172.49.

19488.16 - 11172.49: Let's compute.

19488.16 - 11172.49 = ?

19488.16
-11172.49
= 8315.67.

So,

2 *139.6 x = 8315.67

Multiply 2 *139.6 = 279.2.

So,

279.2 x = 8315.67.

Solve for x:

x = 8315.67 / 279.2.

Let me compute that.

8315.67 ÷ 279.2 → Let's see.

279.2 × 30 = 8376, which is a bit more than 8315.67.

So 30 would be 8376, which is 8376 -8315.67=60.33 more. So approximate 29.9.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Compute 279.2 × 29.8:

279.2 ×30 would be 8376, but subtract 279.2 ×0.2 → 55.84. So 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16.

Wait, but 8320.16 is larger than 8315.67. Hmm.

Wait, 279.2 ×29.8 = ?

Wait, 29.8 = 30 - 0.2.

So 279.2 *30 = 8376.

279.2 *0.2=55.84.

So 279.2 *29.8 = 8376 -55.84 = 8320.16.

But our target is 8315.67, which is 8315.67 -8320.16 = -4.49 less than 8320.16. So 29.8 gives a product 4.49 higher than needed.

So perhaps x is approximately 29.8 minus (4.49 /279.2) → 4.49 / ~279 ≈ 0.016.

So x ≈29.8 - 0.016 ≈29.784.

Wait, that's approx 29.78.

But wait, wait, perhaps I should compute 8315.67 ÷ 279.2.

Let me compute 279.2 ×29.78.

Wait, 279.2 ×29 = 279.2 *30=8376, minus 279.2 =8376-279.2=8096.8.

Wait, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, 29 ×279.2 = ?

Wait, 27 ×279.2 is 279.2 ×20=5584, 279.2 ×7=1954.4 → sum is 5584+1954.4=7538.4.

Plus 279.2 ×0.78: Wait, perhaps I should do this another way.

Alternatively, perhaps approximate the division.

279.2 × x =8315.67.

x=8315.67 /279.2.

Let me compute 8315.67 ÷279.2.

Dividing both numerator and denominator by 1000: 8.31567 ÷0.2792.

What's 0.2792 ×29.78 ≈8.31567?

Wait, 0.2792 ×30 = 8.376.

But 8.376 is larger than 8.31567.

So x is about 29.78, as before.

So p = x ≈29.78 MeV/c.

Wait, but let me get more accurate.

Wait, 0.2792 × 29.78 = ?

Wait, 0.2792 ×30 is 8.376.

But 0.2792 * (30 -0.22) = 8.376 - (0.2792 *0.22)= 8.376 -0.061424=8.314576.

Which is about 8.314576, which is less than 8.31567 by 0.001094.

So to get the 0.001094, how much more do I need to add?

Each 0.001 in x contributes 0.2792 *0.001 =0.0002792.

We need to cover 0.001094, so 0.001094 /0.0002792 ≈ 3.91.

So x ≈29.78 + 0.00391 ≈29.7839.

So p ≈29.784 MeV/c.

Wait, but let me compute 279.2 ×29.7839.

279.2 *29 = 279.2 *30 =8376 minus 279.2 → 8376-279.2=8096.8.

Then 279.2 *0.7839.

0.7839 is 0.7 +0.08+0.0039.

0.7*279.2=195.44.

0.08*279.2=22.336.

0.0039*279.2≈1.08888.

Adding them: 195.44 +22.336=217.776 +1.08888≈218.86488.

So 29.7839 → 29 *279.2=8096.8, plus 0.7839 *279.2≈218.86488. So total is 8096.8 +218.86488=8315.66488 MeV.

Which is very close to 8315.67, so x is approximately 29.784 MeV/c.

So p ≈29.784 MeV/c.

Now, knowing that p is approximately 29.784 MeV/c, let's compute the energies.

E_mu = sqrt(p^2 + m_mu^2) = sqrt( (29.784)^2 + (105.7)^2 )

Compute 29.784^2:

Let me compute 30^2=900. 29.784 is 0.216 less than 30.

So (30 -0.216)^2 =30² - 2*30*0.216 +0.216²=900 -12.96 +0.046656≈887.086656.

So p^2≈887.086656.

m_mu^2=105.7^2=11172.49.

So E_mu^2 = 887.086656 +11172.49 = 12059.576656.

So E_mu = sqrt(12059.576656) ≈ 109.81 MeV.

Wait, because 109.8^2 = (109.8)^2 = (100 + 9.8)^2 = 10^4 + 2*100*9.8 +9.8^2 =10000 + 1960 +96.04= 119,960? Wait, wait, no, that would be 10000 + 1960=11960, plus 96.04=12056.04.

Hmm, E_mu^2 is 12059.576, which is a bit higher than 12056.04. So E_mu is a bit higher than 109.8.

So sqrt(12059.576):

109.8^2=12056.04.

12059.576 -12056.04=3.536.

So delta x for sqrt is approximately 3.536/(2*109.8) )=3.536/(219.6)≈0.0161.

So E_mu≈109.8 +0.0161≈109.816 MeV.

So E_mu≈109.816 MeV.

E_nu = p =29.784 MeV.

Now, the energies of the muon and the neutrino are about 109.816 MeV and 29.784 MeV, respectively.

The rest mass of the muon is 105.7 MeV, so the kinetic energy of the muon is E_mu - m_mu = 109.816 -105.7 =4.116 MeV.

The neutrino's energy is all kinetic, since its rest mass is zero. So KE_nu =29.784 MeV.

Now, looking at the options:

Option D: 4.12 MeV, 29.8 MeV.

Wait, let me see the options.

Option D is 4.12 MeV and 29.8 MeV.

So the KE of the muon is about 4.12 MeV, and the neutrino is about 29.8 MeV. That seems to match.

So the options are:

A) 2.84, 26.8 → seems too low.

B) 7.2, 32.8 → maybe not.

C) 3.52, 20.8 → no.

D) 4.12,29.8 → yes.

So the correct answer should be option D.

Wait, but let me double-check in case I made any mistakes.

Wait, another way to approach this is to consider that in the rest frame of the pion, the muon and neutrino share the energy. Since pion mass is 139.6, and muon's rest mass is 105.7, the available energy is 139.6 -105.7 =33.9 MeV. But that's not all, because when the muon is moving, it has kinetic energy.

Wait, no. Because the available energy is the pion's rest energy, so the sum of the muon and neutrino's rest masses plus their kinetic energies must equal the pion's rest energy. But in this case, the neutrino's rest mass is zero. So the muon's rest energy plus its kinetic energy plus the neutrino's energy (which is all kinetic) equals 139.6 MeV.

Wait, but how does that compare with what I did earlier? Let me think. The muon's energy is 105.7 + KE_mu, and the neutrino's energy is KE_nu. So:

105.7 + KE_mu + KE_nu = 139.6 → KE_mu + KE_nu = 33.9 MeV.

But from earlier calculations, KE_mu is about 4.12 MeV, KE_nu about 29.784 MeV, which adds up to about 33.9 MeV. So that checks out.

So the numbers are correct.


To solve the problem, we analyze the decay of a stationary positively charged pion, **π⁺**, into a positively charged muon, **μ⁺**, and a neutrino, **ν**. The rest masses are given as follows:  
- Rest mass of **π⁺**: \( m_{\pi} = 139.6 \, \text{MeV} \)  
- Rest mass of **μ⁺**: \( m_{\mu} = 105.7 \, \text{MeV} \)  

### Key Equations and Conservation Laws
1. **Energy Conservation**:  
   The total energy before and after the decay must be conserved. Since the pion is stationary, its total energy is its rest energy:  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = m_{\pi} c^2 = 139.6 \, \text{MeV}.
   \]  
   After the decay, the total energy is the sum of the energies of the muon and the neutrino:  
   \[
   E_{\pi} = E_{\mu} + E_{\nu}.
   \]  

2. **Momentum Conservation**:  
   The pion is stationary, so the total momentum before the decay is zero. After the decay, the muon and neutrino must have equal and opposite momenta to conserve momentum:  
   \[
   p_{\mu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]  

3. **Energy of the Muon**:  
   The muon's energy is given by:  
   \[
   E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p_{\mu}^2 + m_{\mu}^2}.
   \]  

4. **Energy of the Neutrino**:  
   The neutrino is massless, so its energy is equal to its momentum:  
   \[
   E_{\nu} = p_{\nu}.
   \]  

### Solving for Momentum and Energies
Using the conservation equations, we substitute \( p_{\mu} = p_{\nu} = p \) into the energy conservation equation:  
\[
139.6 = \sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} + p.
\]  
Rearranging and solving for \( p \):  
\[
\sqrt{p^2 + 105.7^2} = 139.6 - p.
\]  
Squaring both sides:  
\[
p^2 + 105.7^2 = (139.6 - p)^2.
\]  
Expanding and simplifying:  
\[
p^2 + 11172.49 = 19488.16 - 279.2p + p^2.
\]  
Canceling \( p^2 \) and solving for \( p \):  
\[
279.2p = 19488.16 - 11172.49 = 8315.67.
\]  
\[
p = \frac{8315.67}{279.2} \approx 29.784 \, \text{MeV/c}.
\]  

Now, calculate the energies:  
- **Energy of the muon**:  
  \[
  E_{\mu} = \sqrt{p^2 + m_{\mu}^2} = \sqrt{29.784^2 + 105.7^2}.
  \]  
  Compute \( 29.784^2 \approx 887.09 \) and \( 105.7^2 = 11172.49 \):  
  \[
  E_{\mu} = \sqrt{887.09 + 11172.49} = \sqrt{12059.58} \approx 109.816 \, \text{MeV}.
  \]  
  The kinetic energy of the muon is:  
  \[
  KE_{\mu} = E_{\mu} - m_{\mu} = 109.816 - 105.7 = 4.116 \, \text{MeV}.
  \]  

- **Energy of the neutrino**:  
  \[
  E_{\nu} = p = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
  \]  
  Since the neutrino is massless, its kinetic energy is equal to its energy:  
  \[
  KE_{\nu} = 29.784 \, \text{MeV}.
  \]  

### Matching with Options
The kinetic energies are approximately:  
- \( KE_{\mu} \approx 4.12 \, \text{MeV} \)  
- \( KE_{\nu} \approx 29.8 \, \text{MeV} \)  

This matches **Option D**.
