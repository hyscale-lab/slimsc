Okay, I've got this question about a metric and finding the area of a pseudosphere with radius 2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So the metric given is ds² = [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Wait, that looks a bit like something from differential geometry. I remember that metrics describe the geometry of a space, and when you have a metric like this, you can compute things like area, length, curvature, etc.

The question is about the area of a pseudosphere of radius r=2. Wait, pseudosphere... Oh right, a pseudosphere is a surface of constant negative curvature, kind of like a saddle shape. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the terminology here. I think a pseudosphere is a specific type of surface with a certain metric, but I'm not sure how that ties into the given metric.

Let me parse the given metric more carefully. The metric is written in terms of x and y, so it's probably in 2D. The denominator is (4 - x² - y²), and the numerator is 32. So the coefficient in front of (dx² + dy²) is 32/(4 - (x² + y²)). 

Wait a second, when I see a metric like this, I think it's conformal to the Euclidean metric because it's just a scalar multiple of dx² + dy². So any area calculation would involve the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. Oh right, the area element in 2D for a metric ds² = g(x,y) (dx² + dy²) is sqrt(g) dx dy. Wait, no, let me think. The metric is ds² = g_{ij} dx^i dx^j. In 2D, the determinant would just be g_{11}g_{22} - g_{12}^2. But in this case, the off-diagonal terms (g_{12} and g_{21}) are zero because the metric is diagonal. So the determinant is just g_{11} * g_{22}. But since both are equal to 32/(4 - x² - y²), the determinant is [32/(4 - x² - y²)]². So sqrt(det g) would be 32/(4 - x² - y²). 

So the area element dA is [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy. Wait, so to find the total area, I would integrate this over the region where the metric is defined, right? But wait, where is the metric defined? The denominator is 4 - x² - y². So that would be non-zero only when x² + y² <4. Otherwise, the metric blows up. So the domain of this metric is the disk where x² + y² <4. So the radius is 2, since 4 is 2 squared. Oh, so the domain is a disk of radius 2 in the x-y plane. But wait, the question is about a pseudosphere of radius 2. Hmm, perhaps this metric is actually representing a pseudosphere, but I'm a bit unsure.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me remember: a pseudosphere has a metric that can be written in terms of its coordinates. I think the Poincaré disk model uses a metric similar to this, but let's think. The Poincaré disk model has metric ds² = 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²), where r is the radial coordinate in the disk. But in our case, the metric is [32/(4 - x² - y²)] (dx² + dy²). Let me rewrite 4 - x² - y² as 4(1 - (x² + y²)/4) = 4(1 - (r²)/4), where r is the radial coordinate. So substituting, the metric becomes [32/(4(1 - r²/4)))] (dr² + r² dθ²). Simplify that: 32/(4) is 8, so 8/(1 - r²/4) (dr² + r² dθ²). 

Wait, but the Poincaré disk metric is usually written as ds² = (4/(1 - r²)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²). Hmm, but our current expression is 8/(1 - (r/2)^2) (dr² + r² dθ²). Let me see: 4/(1 - r²)^2 is similar but not the same. Alternatively, perhaps it's a scaled version.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The area of a pseudosphere is something I should remember. Wait, pseudospheres have infinite area, right? Because they're like cones with negative curvature; their total area is infinite. But wait, I thought they might have some finite area, but maybe not.

Wait, let me think more carefully. The metric given here: in Poincaré disk coordinates, the metric is usually ds² = 4/(1 - r²)^2 (dr² + r² dθ²). The area of the hyperbolic plane is infinite, but when you have a pseudosphere (which is a finite area?), no, I'm getting confused. Wait, a pseudosphere is a surface of revolution of a tractrix. Its surface area is finite. Oh wait, but maybe that's a different concept. Wait, in hyperbolic geometry, the disk model has an infinite area because the surface extends infinitely, but a pseudosphere as a surface in Euclidean space is a finite area.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The pseudosphere, also known as the tractricoid, has finite area. So if the question is about the area in the Euclidean sense, it's finite. But the metric given might be representing something else.

Wait, but the metric here is in 2D, and the question is about the area of the pseudosphere of radius 2. So perhaps the metric provided is that of a pseudosphere, and calculating the area under this metric would give the answer.

Wait, earlier I thought that the area element is 32/(4 - x² - y²) dx dy. So the area would be the integral over the disk x² + y² <4 of [32/(4 - (x² + y²))] dx dy. Let me set up that integral. Let's switch to polar coordinates because the problem is symmetric in x and y. So x² + y² = r², and dx dy becomes r dr dθ.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

The θ integral is straightforward: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

So the area A = 2π * ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute this integral. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then, du/dr = -2r → (-du/2) = r dr.

When r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So substituting:

∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr = 32 ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Which becomes 32 * ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ ( - du/2 ) / u ].

Because r dr = -du/2, and 4 -r² = u.

So ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr = (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du evaluated from 4 to 0.

But when we switch the limits, the integral becomes from 0 to4.

Wait, let me compute:

∫ (from r=0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr = ∫ (u=4 to 0) [ (-1/2) * (1/u) du ].

Which is the same as (1/2) ∫ (u=0 to4) (1/u) du.

So that becomes (1/2) [ ln(u) ] from 0 to4.

But wait, ln(0) is negative infinity. Oh, so this integral diverges. That means the area is infinite. So the area is 2π * [something that's infinite]. So the area is infinite, which would mean the correct answer is D) +infty.

But wait, why would the area be infinite? Because the metric is singular at r=2 (since denominator becomes zero), the area near r=2 might blow up. So integrating all the way to r=2 makes the area infinite.

So the pseudosphere in this metric has an infinite area. So the correct option is D) +infty.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which is conformal to the Euclidean metric. The area element in such a metric is proportional to the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is the product of the diagonal components, which are both \(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\). Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate this area element over the domain where the metric is defined. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) ensures that the metric is valid for \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), i.e., within a disk of radius 2. Converting to polar coordinates (\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\), so the area simplifies to:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), which gives \(du = -2r \, dr\) or \(r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du\). The limits of integration change as follows: when \(r = 0\), \(u = 4\); and when \(r = 2\), \(u = 0\). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-1/2}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u|\), so:

\[
16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \left[\ln(u)\right]_0^4 = 16 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right].
\]

Since \(\ln(0) \to -\infty\), the integral diverges. This means the total area is infinite. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from θ=0 to 2π) ∫ (r=0 to 2) [32/(4 - r²)] * r dr dθ.

The θ integral is straightforward: ∫0 to 2π dθ = 2π.

So the area A = 2π * ∫0^2 [32 r / (4 - r²)] dr.

Let me compute this integral. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 4 - r². Then, du/dr = -2r → (-du/2) = r dr.

When r=0, u=4; when r=2, u=0.

So substituting:

∫ [32 r/(4 - r²)] dr = 32 ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr.

Which becomes 32 * ∫ (from u=4 to u=0) [ ( - du/2 ) / u ].

Because r dr = -du/2, and 4 -r² = u.

So ∫ [r/(4 - r²)] dr = (-1/2) ∫ (1/u) du evaluated from 4 to 0.

But when we switch the limits, the integral becomes from 0 to4.

Wait, let me compute:

∫ (from r=0 to 2) [ r/(4 - r²) ] dr = ∫ (u=4 to 0) [ (-1/2) * (1/u) du ].

Which is the same as (1/2) ∫ (u=0 to4) (1/u) du.

So that becomes (1/2) [ ln(u) ] from 0 to4.

The given metric is 

\[
ds^2 = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \left(dx^2 + dy^2\right),
\]

which is conformal to the Euclidean metric. The area element in such a metric is proportional to the square root of the determinant of the metric tensor. Since the metric is diagonal, the determinant is the product of the diagonal components, which are both \(\frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2}\). Thus, the area element becomes:

\[
dA = \frac{32}{4 - x^2 - y^2} \, dx \, dy.
\]

To compute the total area, we integrate this area element over the domain where the metric is defined. The denominator \(4 - x^2 - y^2\) ensures that the metric is valid for \(x^2 + y^2 < 4\), i.e., within a disk of radius 2. Converting to polar coordinates (\(x^2 + y^2 = r^2\), \(dx \, dy = r \, dr \, d\theta\)), the area becomes:

\[
A = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^2 \frac{32}{4 - r^2} r \, dr \, d\theta.
\]

The angular integral \(\int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi\), so the area simplifies to:

\[
A = 2\pi \int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr.
\]

To evaluate the radial integral, use the substitution \(u = 4 - r^2\), which gives \(du = -2r \, dr\) or \(r \, dr = -\frac{1}{2} du\). The limits of integration change as follows: when \(r = 0\), \(u = 4\); and when \(r = 2\), \(u = 0\). Substituting, the integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^2 \frac{32r}{4 - r^2} \, dr = 32 \int_4^0 \frac{-1/2}{u} \, du = 16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du.
\]

The integral \(\int \frac{1}{u} \, du = \ln|u|\), so:

\[
16 \int_0^4 \frac{1}{u} \, du = 16 \left[\ln(u)\right]_0^4 = 16 \left[\ln(4) - \ln(0)\right].
\]

Since \(\ln(0) \to -\infty\), the integral diverges. This means the total area is infinite. Therefore, the area of the pseudosphere described by the given metric is infinite.
