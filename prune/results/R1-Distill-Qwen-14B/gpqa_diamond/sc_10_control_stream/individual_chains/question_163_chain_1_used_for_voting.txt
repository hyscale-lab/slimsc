Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and think about what each part means.

The question says: We want to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. What's the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to do this, and what's the pH of the resulting solution?

Hmm, Fe(OH)3 is Iron(III) hydroxide. I remember that it's a weak base and not very soluble in water, but it can react with acids. So, the plan is probably to react Fe(OH)3 with a strong acid to dissolve it, forming some iron salt and water.

First, let's write down the reaction. Fe(OH)3 is going to react with a strong acid, say HCl (since it's monobasic and strong), to produce FeCl3 and water. The reaction should be something like:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the stoichiometry. Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups. So, each mole of Fe(OH)3 would need 3 moles of HCl to completely neutralize it, right? So the balanced equation is correct.

Next, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 I have. The mass given is 0.1 grams. Let's calculate the moles. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is needed. Let me compute that:

Fe is about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH is (16 + 1) = 17 g/mol. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Molar mass = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Wait, wait, 0.1 / 106.85 is like 0.000936 mol.

So, approximately 9.36e-4 moles of Fe(OH)3.

But wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is:

106.85 goes into 0.1 how many times? 106.85 * 0.000936 is about 0.1. So yeah, that's correct.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of HCl, the moles of HCl needed are 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

But wait, the acid is 0.1 M. So the volume of acid needed is moles / concentration. So, volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, that's about 28.08 cm³.

Looking back at the options, option C is pH 2.04 and 28.05 cm³. Option B is 30.09 cm³, which is a bit higher. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I should consider the solubility of Fe(OH)3. Because even with the acid, not all of it may dissolve. Or wait, the problem says to find the minimum volume needed to dissolve all of it. So perhaps the calculation I did is correct, assuming complete reaction.

Wait, but another thing to consider: when Fe(OH)3 reacts with HCl, it produces Fe^3+ ions. Then, we need to consider the pH of the solution. Because Fe(OH)3 might precipitate if the solution is too basic, but in this case, we're adding enough acid to ensure it's soluble.

So after dissolving Fe(OH)3 in HCl, the solution will contain FeCl3. FeCl3 is a strong electrolyte and will dissociate completely in solution into Fe^3+ and Cl^- ions. So, [Fe^3+] = concentration from FeCl3.

How much FeCl3 do we have? From the reaction: 1 mole Fe(OH)3 → 1 mole FeCl3.

So moles of FeCl3 is same as moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 0.000936 mol. The total volume is 100 cm³, which is 0.1 L.

So concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.

Wait, but wait. Wait, I think that's not the only thing. Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and can hydrolyze in water, making the solution acidic. So the pH will depend on the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ ions.

Right, so Fe^3+ will react with water:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+

This hydrolysis produces H+ ions, making the solution acidic. So to find pH, we need to calculate the concentration of H+ from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

But wait, if the solution is already acidic due to excess HCl, then maybe the H+ from HCl is so much higher, and the contribution from Fe^3+ is negligible. Wait, but in this case, when exactly do we have excess HCl?

Wait, let's think. The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, 3 moles of H+ are consumed. The moles of H+ in the acid are 0.1 M * V_acid (in liters). So I should calculate if the H+ from the acid is in excess of what's needed to neutralize Fe(OH)3.

Wait, so moles of H+ needed for the reaction is 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol.

Moles of H+ in the acid added: 0.1 M * V_acid (in liters) = 0.1 * (V_acid / 1000). Since V_acid is in cm³, we divide by 1000 to get liters.

Wait, the minimum volume of acid needed is such that all Fe(OH)3 is dissolved. That would be exactly the amount needed to neutralize Fe(OH)3, right? So V_acid = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³.

But if we add exactly that volume, then all H+ is consumed, because 3 moles H+ per mole Fe(OH)3, and moles H+ is 3 * moles Fe(OH)3. So after reaction, the solution would have Fe^3+ and excess chloride ions, but no excess H+ from the acid. Wait, but no, because the acid is a strong monobasic, so all the H+ would have reacted, right?

Wait, maybe not. Wait, the acid is in a certain volume, and when you mix it with the Fe(OH)3 solution, the total volume becomes 100 cm³. So perhaps the calculation is a bit more involved.

Wait, no. Let me think again. To dissolve Fe(OH)3, you need to add enough acid to provide the H+ ions to react with the OH- in Fe(OH)3.

But wait, the problem is that when you add the acid to the Fe(OH)3, the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O

So, if you have just enough H+ to react with Fe(OH)3, then after the reaction, the solution would contain Fe^3+ and any excess H+ from the acid. Wait, no, because H+ is consumed in the reaction.

Wait, but if you add exactly the stoichiometric amount of H+, then all H+ would be used up in the reaction, leaving no excess H+ from the acid. But then, the solution would have Fe^3+ which can hydrolyze, contributing H+.

So, in that case, the concentration of H+ would come from two sources: any excess H+ from the acid, and the H+ from Fe^3+ hydrolysis. But if it's exactly stoichiometric, then there's no excess H+ from the acid, so the H+ comes only from Fe^3+.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

If I add exactly 28.08 cm³ of 0.1 M HCl, then the moles of HCl are 0.002808 mol. The reaction requires 3 moles H+ per 1 mole Fe(OH)3, so H+ is 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol. So HCl provides exactly the required H+.

So after reaction, the solution has Fe^3+ and Cl^- ions. The Fe^3+ will hydrolyze, creating H+ ions. But wait, because the solution is 100 cm³, the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.

So, the hydrolysis reaction:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The hydrolysis will produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic. So we need to calculate the pH based on this.

But wait, how do we calculate the pH when the solution is a result of Fe^3+ hydrolyzing in water.

This is a bit tricky because Fe^3+ is a weak acid in solution, but it's a bit more complicated due to the hydrolysis.

The hydrolysis can be treated using the concept of hydrolysis for a weak acid. The equilibrium expression is:

Ka = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

But I don't remember the exact Ka for Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the hydrolysis constant.

Alternatively, we can think of the hydrolysis as a reaction that produces H+ ions, and then calculate the concentration of H+ based on the initial concentration of Fe^3+.

Wait, another approach: the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Let me denote x as the concentration of H+ produced per liter.

Wait, but the stoichiometry is 1 mole Fe^3+ producing 3 moles H+. So if we let the concentration of Fe(OH)3 be x, then [H+] would be 3x, and [Fe^3+] would be approximately 0.00936 - x ≈ 0.00936 (since x is likely small compared to 0.00936).

But I'm not sure about the exact Ka value. Alternatively, I can look for the hydrolysis constant for Fe^3+.

Wait, I think the hydrolysis constant (K) for Fe^3+ can be found using the relationship between its hydrolysis and the pH. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH using the formula for a hydrolysis of a salt.

Wait, another approach: For a salt of a weak acid (like Fe^3+ which hydrolyzes to form H+ and a weak base), the pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = ½ (pKa + log C)

But wait, no, that's for salts of weak bases. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, Fe^3+ is a cation from a strong acid (since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base). So when Fe^3+ dissolves, it undergoes hydrolysis, making the solution acidic.

The hydrolysis can be considered as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is:

Ka = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

I think the Ka for Fe^3+ hydrolysis is around 1e-33 or something like that, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the K value for Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the K value using the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, the Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is 6e-38 at 25°C. But how does that help?

Wait, the hydrolysis reaction can be written as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is equal to ( [Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+ ].

But the Ksp is for the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in water, which is:

Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe^3+ (aq) + 3 OH^- (aq)

So Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how to relate that to the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ in solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH using the K value for the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, another thought: the solution after the reaction has Fe^3+ concentration of 0.00936 M. Let's assume that the hydrolysis is significant enough that the solution is acidic.

Let me assume that the hydrolysis is the main source of H+ ions. So, the concentration of H+ can be found by considering the hydrolysis.

Assume that x is the concentration of Fe^3+ that hydrolyzes.

But wait, the stoichiometry is 1 Fe^3+ → 1 Fe(OH)3 and 3 H+. So, for each mole of Fe^3+ that hydrolyzes, 3 moles of H+ are produced.

So, [H+] = 3x.

The expression for the equilibrium is:

Ka = ( [Fe(OH)3] * [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+ ]

But [Fe(OH)3] is x (assuming it's a very weak acid, so x is much smaller than 0.00936, so [Fe^3+] ≈ 0.00936).

Thus, Ka ≈ (x * (3x)^3) ) / 0.00936.

Simplify:

Ka = (x * 27 x^3 ) / 0.00936 = (27 x^4 ) / 0.00936.

But I'm not sure what Ka is for Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Maybe I can find it from the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is 6e-38. From the dissolution equation Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^-.

So Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6e-38.

At 25°C, the Ksp is given, so if [Fe^3+] is 0.00936 M, then:

6e-38 = 0.00936 * [OH^-]^3 → [OH^-]^3 = 6e-38 / 0.00936 ≈ 6.41e-36 → [OH^-] ≈ cube root of 6.41e-36.

Cube root of 6.41 is about 1.86, and cube root of 1e-36 is 1e-12. So [OH^-] ≈ 1.86e-12.

pOH = -log(1.86e-12) ≈ 11.73 → pH = 14 - 11.73 = 2.27.

Wait, that's an approximate pH of around 2.27. But wait, this is based on the solubility equilibrium, not the hydrolysis. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is dominated by the excess H+ from the strong acid. Wait, but earlier calculation showed that the acid is used up exactly, so no excess H+ from the acid. So the H+ comes from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, but in my earlier approach, using Ksp, I got pH around 2.27. However, the options have pH values of around 2.04, 2.69, etc.

But let's think again. If the solution after dissolving Fe(OH)3 with exactly the required H+ has Fe^3+ concentration 0.00936 M, and we assume that the solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, perhaps I should use the hydrolysis equation again.

Another approach: The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M. The hydrolysis reaction produces H+ ions, so the pH will be determined by the [H+].

Let me make an assumption that x is small compared to 0.00936, so [Fe^3+] ≈ 0.00936.

The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is equal to Kw / Ksp. Wait, no. Let me think. The K for the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6e-38.

The hydrolysis reaction is the reverse of the dissolution, but with H+ instead of OH-.

Wait, maybe I should write the hydrolysis as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction would be K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But from the dissolution reaction, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6e-38.

In the hydrolysis reaction, if we rewrite it as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+,

then K = ( [Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+ ].

We can relate this K to the Ksp. Because the dissolution equation is Fe(OH)3 ↔ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Ksp = 6e-38.

If we reverse this equation, we get Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3 → K = 1/Ksp = 1.666e+37.

But the hydrolysis equation is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Let me write both equations:

1. Fe(OH)3 ↔ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Ksp = 6e-38.

2. Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → K_hydrolysis = ?

Let me see: the hydrolysis reaction can be rewritten as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Which is the same as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- + 6 H+ → Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express H2O as H+ and OH^-.

Another approach: the hydrolysis reaction can be thought of as the reverse of the dissolution, but with H+ involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find K_hydrolysis in terms of Kw and Ksp.

Wait, let me think. The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is:

Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe^3+ (aq) + 3 OH^- (aq) → Ksp = 6e-38.

The reverse reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3(s) → K = 1/Ksp = 1.666e+37.

But the hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

H2O can be split into H+ and OH^-: H2O ↔ H+ + OH^-.

So, let's substitute H2O in the hydrolysis reaction.

Fe^3+ + 3 (H+ + OH^-) → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Wait, that's:

Fe^3+ + 3 H+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Simplify: Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3.

Which is the reverse of the dissolution reaction.

So that's the same as the reverse reaction, which has K = 1/Ksp = 1.666e+37.

But wait, in the hydrolysis, the H+ comes from the water. So the K for the hydrolysis reaction is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+ ].

But from the reverse dissolution, K = [Fe(OH)3] / ([Fe^3+][OH^-]^3) ) = 1/Ksp.

So,

1/Ksp = [Fe(OH)3] / ([Fe^3+][OH^-]^3) → [Fe(OH)3] = (1/Ksp) * [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

But in the hydrolysis reaction, [Fe(OH)3] is also equal to (K * [Fe^3+]) / [H+]^3.

Wait, perhaps I can combine these.

Wait, let's substitute [Fe(OH)3] from the dissolution equation into the hydrolysis equation.

From dissolution:

[Fe(OH)3] = Ksp * [Fe^3+] [OH^-]^3.

From hydrolysis:

[Fe(OH)3] = K_hydrolysis * [Fe^3+] [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+ ].

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead write the hydrolysis reaction in terms of H+.

Hydrolysis: Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+ ].

But from the dissolution equation, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

So, [OH^-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe^3+ ].

We can write [OH^-] in terms of [H+] because Kw = [H+][OH^-] = 1e-14.

So, [OH^-] = (1e-14) / [H+].

Substitute into Ksp equation:

Ksp = [Fe^3+]*( (1e-14)/[H+] )^3 → [H+]^3 = [Fe^3+] (1e-14)^3 / Ksp.

Wait, let's solve for [H+].

[H+]^3 = ( [Fe^3+] * (1e-14)^3 ) / Ksp.

So,

[H+] = [ ( [Fe^3+] * (1e-14)^3 ) / Ksp ) ]^(1/3).

Plugging in the numbers:

[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M.

Ksp = 6e-38.

So,

[H+]^3 = (0.00936 * (1e-42)) / 6e-38.

Compute numerator: 0.00936 * 1e-42 = 9.36e-45.

Denominator: 6e-38.

So,

[H+]^3 = (9.36e-45) / (6e-38 ) = (9.36/6) * 1e-7 = 1.56 * 1e-7 → 1.56e-7.

So,

[H+] = cube root of (1.56e-7 ) ≈ 5.38e-3 M.

pH = -log(5.38e-3) ≈ 2.27.

Wait, that's approximately 2.27. But looking at the options, the closest is option C (pH 2.04) and option B (pH 2.69). Hmm, but 2.27 isn't matching exactly. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo the [H+] calculation.

So,

[H+]^3 = ( [Fe^3+] * (1e-14)^3 ) / Ksp.

Plugging in the values:

[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M.

(1e-14)^3 = 1e-42.

Ksp = 6e-38.

So,

[H+]^3 = (0.00936 * 1e-42 ) / 6e-38 = (9.36e-45) / 6e-38 = (9.36 / 6 ) * (1e-45 / 1e-38 ) = 1.56 * 1e-7.

Yes, same as before.

So,

[H+] ≈ cube_root(1.56e-7) ≈ 5.38e-3.

pH = -log(5.38e-3) ≈ 2.27.

But none of the options have pH 2.27. So perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the strong acid.

Wait, earlier I thought that the H+ from the acid and Fe(OH)3 reaction would be exactly consumed, leaving no excess. But perhaps that's not the case because when you mix the acid with the Fe(OH)3 solution, the total volume increases, which affects the concentration.

Wait, perhaps when I add the strong acid to the Fe(OH)3 solution, the H+ from the acid will react with the OH- from Fe(OH)3, but if there's any H+ left, it will contribute to the pH.

Wait, no, because the initial calculation was that the acid provides exactly the needed H+ to neutralize Fe(OH)3. So in that case, all H+ from the acid is used up, and the remaining H+ comes from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

So perhaps my initial calculation is correct, but the options don't have 2.27. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) pH 3.16; 32.14

B) pH 2.69; 30.09

C) pH 2.04; 28.05

D) pH4.94; 20.40

Wait, option C has 28.05 cm³, which matches the volume I calculated earlier. So perhaps the pH is different.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution after reaction has both Fe^3+ and Cl^- ions. But Cl^- is the conjugate base of a strong acid, so it doesn't hydrolyze. So pH is determined by Fe^3+.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [H+].

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis is more significant, and I should consider the reaction more accurately.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact expression without any approximations.

Let me write the hydrolysis reaction again:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is:

K = ( [Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+ ].

But Fe(OH)3 is a solid, so its concentration is a constant. So K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+ ].

But wait, no, Fe(OH)3 is a solid, so it doesn't appear in the K expression. Wait, no, because the reaction is in solution. Wait, no, Fe(OH)3 is a precipitate, so as a pure solid, it's not in the solution. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the solution as a solution of Fe^3+ which undergoes hydrolysis, leading to H+.

The initial concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+ (aq).

This is a reaction that produces H+ ions. Since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, it doesn't affect the concentration in the solution.

So, the equilibrium expression is:

K = ( [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+ ].

But what's K?

Wait, the K for the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6e-38.

The hydrolysis reaction can be written as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → K_hydrolysis = ?

We can relate K_hydrolysis to Ksp as follows.

The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is:

Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

The hydrolysis reaction is the reverse of the dissolution, but with H+ instead of OH^-.

So, the hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3(s) → K = 1/Ksp = 1.666e+37.

But the hydrolysis reaction in terms of H+ is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+ → K_hydrolysis = ?

H2O can be written as H+ + OH^-.

So, substituting, the reaction becomes:

Fe^3+ + 3 (H+ + OH^-) → Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+.

Simplify:

Fe^3+ + 3 H+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+.

We can cancel 3 H+ on both sides:

Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3(s) → K = 1/Ksp = 1.666e+37.

But the hydrolysis reaction we're interested in is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+, which doesn't directly involve OH^-.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going in circles. Let me try to find K_hydrolysis using the Ksp.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ and calculate the pH based on that.

Given that [Fe^3+] is 0.00936 M, and the hydrolysis produces H+ ions.

The initial assumption is that x is much smaller than 0.00936, so [Fe^3+] ≈ 0.00936.

The expression is:

K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] → [H+]^3 = K * [Fe^3+].

But what is K?

Alternatively, perhaps I can find K using the Ksp.

Wait, the dissolution equation is Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+ → K_hydro = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+ ].

We can relate K_hydro to Ksp.

From dissolution, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 → [OH^-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe^3+ ].

From the hydrolysis, K_hydro = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+ ].

But since Kw = [H+][OH^-] = 1e-14 → [OH^-] = Kw / [H+].

Substitute into Ksp equation:

Ksp = [Fe^3+ ] * ( Kw / [H+] )^3 → [Fe^3+] = Ksp / ( (Kw / [H+])^3 ) → [Fe^3+] = (Ksp * [H+]^3 ) / Kw^3.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach.

Alternatively, let's express [OH^-] in terms of [H+]:

[OH^-] = 1e-14 / [H+].

Then, Ksp = [Fe^3+ ] * (1e-14 / [H+])^3 → rearranged:

[H+]^3 = [Fe^3+ ] * (1e-14)^3 / Ksp → [H+] = ( [Fe^3+ ] * (1e-14)^3 / Ksp )^(1/3).

Plugging in the values:

[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M.

(1e-14)^3 = 1e-42.

Ksp =6e-38.

So,

[H+]^3 = (0.00936 * 1e-42 ) / 6e-38 = (9.36e-45) / 6e-38 = 1.56e-7.

So,

[H+] ≈ cube_root(1.56e-7) ≈ 5.38e-3.

pH = -log(5.38e-3) ≈ 2.27.

But the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, cube root of 1.56e-7 is (1.56e-7)^(1/3).

Let me calculate that more accurately.

1.56e-7 is 1.56 * 10^-7.

Cube root of 10^-7 is 10^(-7/3) ≈ 10^-2.333 → approx 4.64e-3.

Cube root of 1.56 is about 1.16.

So,

[H+] ≈ 1.16 * 4.64e-3 ≈ 5.4e-3 → pH ≈ 2.27.

But this doesn't match any of the options. The closest is option B (2.69) and option C (2.04).

Alternatively, perhaps I should account for the fact that adding the acid changes the total volume, which affects the concentration.

Wait, the total volume is 100 cm³. Adding 28.08 cm³ of acid would make the total volume about 128.08 cm³, but the question states that the total volume is 100 cm³. Oh wait, no—the problem says that the total volume is 100 cm³, so the acid is added to make up the solution to 100 cm³. So I think the initial assumption was that the acid volume plus the Fe(OH)3 solution equals 100 cm³, but perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, the question says we're dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. So perhaps the acid is added to a certain volume, and then the solution is made up to 100 cm³. Or maybe it's directly added to the Fe(OH)3 and the total is 100 cm³.

Wait, the problem states: "dissolve (at 25°C) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So the solution must be 100 cm³ in total. So when you add the acid, the total volume must be 100 cm³.

So, the volume of acid needed is V_acid, and the remaining volume is taken up by the Fe(OH)3 and possibly other components. But for dilution purposes, perhaps it's assumed that the volume change is negligible, or that the total is exactly 100 cm³.

Wait, but when you add a strong acid to Fe(OH)3, a reaction occurs, and the solution volume is 100 cm³.

So, the initial calculation remains correct: 28.08 cm³ of 0.1 M HCl is needed, giving 0.002808 mol of H+.

But if the total volume is 100 cm³, then the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.

Wait, but if the acid is added such that the total volume is 100 cm³, then the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M, and we need to find the pH due to Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

But earlier calculation gave pH ≈2.27, which is not among the options.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Let me think again: Maybe the reaction produces more H+ because the acid is in excess. Or perhaps I need to consider that the acid provides more H+ than needed, leaving some excess which contributes to the pH.

Wait, but the problem states that we need the minimum volume of acid to dissolve all Fe(OH)3. So, that's the exact stoichiometric amount. So, no excess H+.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in the acid, the solution contains some H+ from Fe^3+ hydrolysis and some from the excess acid.

Wait, no, because if I'm using the stoichiometric amount, then all H+ from acid is consumed in the reaction. So, no excess H+ from the acid.

Wait, but perhaps the solution is not only from Fe^3+ hydrolysis but also from the strong acid.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the H+ sources. Let me try to think of it this way:

The reaction of Fe(OH)3 with HCl produces FeCl3 and water. All the H+ from HCl is consumed in the reaction. So, after the reaction, the solution contains FeCl3 and excess Cl^- ions (since Cl^- is a spectator ion), but no excess H+ from HCl.

But FeCl3 is a strong electrolyte and dissociates into Fe^3+ and Cl^-.

So, the only H+ in solution comes from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave pH around 2.27, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the hydrolysis reaction's K is not correctly accounted for.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that x is negligible is incorrect, and we need to set up the equation more accurately.

Let me try that.

Let x be the concentration of H+ produced from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

The hydrolysis reaction: Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is:

K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+ ].

But K is equal to Kw^3 / Ksp.

Because, Ksp is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

And Kw = [H+][OH^-] = 1e-14.

So, [OH^-]^3 = (Kw/[H+])^3 = (1e-14/[H+])^3.

Substituting into Ksp: Ksp = [Fe^3+ ] * (1e-14/[H+] )^3 → [Fe^3+ ] = Ksp * [H+]^3 / (1e-14)^3.

But [Fe^3+ ] is also equal to initial concentration minus the amount hydrolyzed.

Wait, initial [Fe^3+ ] is 0.00936 M. Let's denote the hydrolysis as producing x moles per liter of H+.

So, [H+] = x.

The reaction consumes x/3 moles of Fe^3+, since each Fe^3+ produces 3 H+.

Wait, no: Each Fe^3+ produces 3 H+, so if [H+] is x, then the moles of Fe^3+ hydrolyzed is x/3 (since for each Fe^3+ hydrolyzed, 3 H+ are produced).

So,

[Fe^3+ ] = 0.00936 - (x/3) ≈ 0.00936 (if x is small).

But substituting into K expression:

K = (x^3) / [Fe^3+ ].

But K is equal to Kw^3 / Ksp = (1e-14)^3 / 6e-38 = (1e-42) / 6e-38 = approx 1.666e-5.

Wait,

K = (1e-42) / 6e-38 = (1/6) * 1e-4 = approx 1.666e-5.

So,

K = (x^3) / (0.00936 - x/3 ) ≈ (x^3) / 0.00936.

Because x is small, x/3 << 0.00936.

So,

x^3 ≈ K * 0.00936 → x^3 = (1.666e-5) * 0.00936 → x^3 ≈ 1.56e-7 → x ≈ cube root of 1.56e-7 → x ≈ 5.38e-3 M.

So [H+] ≈5.38e-3 → pH ≈ 2.27.

Again, same result.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps my entire approach is wrong.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem considers that after dissolving Fe(OH)3, the solution contains both Fe^3+ and excess H+ from the acid. But that would require adding more than the stoichiometric amount of acid.

Wait, but the question asks for the minimum volume of acid needed, which is the stoichiometric amount. So adding more acid would be unnecessary.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, mass is 0.1 grams.

Molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is Fe:55.85, O:16 *3, H:1*3 → 55.85 +48 +3= 106.85 g/mol.

So 0.1g / 106.85 g/mol → 0.000936 mol. Correct.

HCl needed is 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol.

Volume of HCl: 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L → 28.08 cm³.

So that part is correct.

So the volume is 28.08 cm³, which is option C, which says 28.05 cm³.

So, the volume is correct.

But the pH is not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution after reaction contains some Cl^- which might affect activity coefficients, but that's beyond the scope of this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid, but no, I thought all H+ is consumed.

Wait, perhaps after adding 28.08 cm³ of HCl, the total volume is 28.08 cm³ plus the volume of the Fe(OH)3 solution, but the problem says the total solution is 100 cm³.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is about how the solution is prepared. Let me re-express:

The problem says: dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume.

So the solution is 100 cm³. So when adding HCl, you have to add enough to make the total solution volume 100 cm³.

So, if you add V cm³ of HCl, the total volume is V + volume of Fe(OH)3 solution. But I'm not given the volume of Fe(OH)3. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps it's assumed that the Fe(OH)3 is in solid form and negligible volume, so the total solution volume is just the volume of the acid added plus any solution from the Fe(OH)3, which is negligible.

Wait, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. So perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the volume of acid is 28.08 cm³, which matches option C.

But the pH is 2.27, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the hydrolysis and assume that the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid, but earlier calculation said no H+ is left.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach. Let's think differently.

After adding the acid, the solution contains Fe^3+ and Cl^-.

But maybe the question assumes that the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the strong acid. But in this case, the acid is exactly stoichiometric, so no excess H+.

So, perhaps the problem is intended to not consider the hydrolysis and just compute the pH based on the Fe^3+ concentration.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier, leading to pH 2.27, which doesn't match any option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the solution is diluted to 100 cm³, so the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M, and using some other method to calculate pH.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH using the formula for a solution of a weak acid.

But Fe^3+ is a weak acid, but I don't know its exact K.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the expression for the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ and use an approximate method.

Wait, another approach: Let me calculate the [H+] using the formula for a solution of a salt of a weak acid.

The pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = (½)(pKa - log C)

Wait, but that's for salts of weak acids or bases. Wait, Fe^3+ is a cation from a weak base (Fe(OH)3), so it's acidic in solution.

The formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak acid (like Fe^3+ which hydrolyzes to H+) is:

pH = ½ (pKa + log C )

Wait, no, that's for salts of weak bases. Let me think again.

Wait, for the salt of a weak acid (like CH3COO^-), the solution is basic because the anion hydrolyzes. For the salt of a weak base (like NH4^+), the solution is acidic because the cation hydrolyzes.

So, for Fe^3+, which is the conjugate acid of Fe(OH)3 (a weak base), the solution is acidic.

The pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = ½ (pKa + log C )

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, the pH can be found using the formula:

[H+] = sqrt( C * K )

Where K is the hydrolysis constant.

But I don't have K; I have Ksp.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH using the formula:

pH = (½)(pKw - pKa )

But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the pH is approximately 2.27, but since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the hydrolysis is negligible, and the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid. But in that case, if the acid is exactly stoichiometric, no excess H+ remains.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the hydrolysis and consider that the solution is neutral, but that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is determined by the H+ from the strong acid, which is zero because it's all used up. But that would imply a neutral solution, which is not the case.

Hmm. I'm stuck.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04.

If my calculation gave pH ≈2.27 and the option is 2.04, perhaps the actual K is different. Maybe the Ksp is different.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong Ksp value. Let me check the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

After a quick search in my memory, I think the Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is around 6e-38, which is what I used. But perhaps in the problem, it's different.

Alternatively, perhaps the K value for hydrolysis is different. Let's say K is 1e-33.

In that case, [H+]^3 = K * [Fe^3+ ] = 1e-33 * 0.00936 → [H+]^3 = 9.36e-36 → [H+] = cube_root(9.36e-36 ) ≈ 4.54e-12 → pH ≈11.34. But that's basic, which can't be right.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is determined by the concentration of H+ from the strong acid, but I can't see any excess.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me recheck.

Fe(OH)3 has 3 OH groups. So each mole requires 3 moles of H+.

So moles of H+ needed: 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol.

Moles of HCl added: same as moles of H+ needed.

So, volume of HCl = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³.

So that's correct.

But the pH is still not matching.

Wait, let me think of another approach. Perhaps the solution after reaction contains Fe^3+ and Cl^-.

The concentrations are:

[Fe^3+] = 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.

[Cl^-] = 3 * 0.000936 / 0.1 L = 0.02808 M.

But Cl^- is a spectator ion and doesn't affect pH.

So, the pH is determined by Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

But I'm stuck on calculating the pH correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a solution of a weak acid.

The hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be considered as a weak acid with concentration C and ionization constant K.

The pH is given by:

pH = ½ (pK + log C )

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is to assume that the concentration of H+ is equal to the square root of (K * C), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the hydrolysis and assume that the pH is determined by the strong acid, but that doesn't make sense here.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Let me think: among the options, option C has the correct volume (28.05 cm³) and a lower pH (2.04) than my calculation. So perhaps the actual pH is around 2.04.

But why would that be the case?

Wait, perhaps the hydrolysis is more significant, leading to a higher [H+], but that would require a lower pH.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the K expression. Let me try again.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is:

K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+ ].

But K can also be expressed in terms of Kw and Ksp.

From the dissolution of Fe(OH)3:

Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

We can express [OH^-] as Kw/[H+], so:

Ksp = [Fe^3+ ] ( Kw / [H+] )^3 → [Fe^3+ ] = Ksp [H+]^3 / Kw^3.

Substituting into the hydrolysis K expression:

K = [H+]^3 / ( Ksp [H+]^3 / Kw^3 ) ) → K = Kw^3 / Ksp.

So,

K = (1e-14)^3 / 6e-38 = (1e-42) / 6e-38 = (1/6) * 1e-4 = approximately 1.666e-5.

So,

K = 1.666e-5.

Now, the expression is:

[H+]^3 = K [Fe^3+ ].

But [Fe^3+ ] is 0.00936 M.

So,

[H+]^3 = 1.666e-5 * 0.00936 → 1.56e-7 → [H+] ≈5.38e-3 → pH≈2.27.

Again, same result.

Ah, but perhaps I should consider that some of the Fe^3+ hydrolyzes, reducing its concentration.

Let me set up the equation without approximation.

Let x be the concentration of H+ produced.

Then,

Fe^3+ → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The change is:

Fe^3+ : 0.00936 → 0.00936 - x.

H+ : 0 → x.

But wait, each mole of Fe^3+ produces 3 H+, so for each mole of Fe^3+ that reacts, 3 moles of H+ are produced.

So, the change would be:

Fe^3+ : 0.00936 - x.

H+ : 0 + 3x.

Wait, that's correct.

So, the equilibrium concentrations are:

[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 - x.

[H+] = 3x.

And the equilibrium expression is:

K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+ ] → (3x)^3 / (0.00936 - x ) = K =1.666e-5.

So,

27 x^3 / (0.00936 - x ) = 1.666e-5.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.00936, we can approximate 0.00936 - x ≈0.00936.

So,

27 x^3 ≈ 1.666e-5 * 0.00936 → 27x^3 ≈ 1.56e-7 → x^3 ≈ 5.78e-9 → x ≈ cube_root(5.78e-9) → approx 1.79e-3.

So,

[H+] =3x ≈5.38e-3 → pH≈2.27.

Still the same result.

But this doesn't match any of the options, which suggests I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach. Let me think differently.

Perhaps after dissolving Fe(OH)3 with the acid, the solution contains Fe^3+ and excess H+ from the acid. But that would require adding more HCl than the stoichiometric amount.

Wait, but the question asks for the minimum volume needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3, so adding more would not be minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH based on the concentration of Fe^3+ without considering hydrolysis, which would be incorrect, but perhaps that's what the options suggest.

If I ignore hydrolysis, then the solution would have [Fe^3+] =0.00936 M and no H+ from that source. But that can't be right because Fe^3+ is acidic.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the solution's pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid, but I thought there's no excess.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH based on the H+ from the strong acid, but that would require knowing the concentration of H+ after mixing.

Wait, the acid is 0.1 M HCl, and I add 28.08 cm³. So, moles of H+ from HCl: 0.1 * 28.08e-3 = 2.808e-3 mol.

But Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3. So, moles of H+ needed: 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol.

So, the H+ from HCl is exactly 0.002808 mol. So, all H+ is consumed in the reaction. So, no excess H+; only H+ from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Thus, the pH must be due to Fe^3+ hydrolysis, leading to pH ≈2.27.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the reaction. Let me think again: when Fe(OH)3 reacts with HCl, the product is FeCl3, which dissociates into Fe^3+ and Cl^-.

So, the solution has Fe^3+ and Cl^-.

But perhaps the problem doesn't consider the hydrolysis and simply calculates the pH based on the concentration of Fe^3+ as a strong acid, which is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the pH using the formula for a solution of FeCl3, assuming complete dissociation and no hydrolysis, which would give a pH lower than 2.04.

Wait, but FeCl3 is a strong electrolyte, so it dissociates completely. The solution would have [Fe^3+] =0.00936 M.

But Fe^3+ is a weak acid, so the pH would be lower than that of a 0.00936 M HCl solution, which would have pH ≈2.03 (since pH = -log(0.00936) ≈2.03).

Ah! Wait, if the problem assumes that the solution's pH is determined by the concentration of Fe^3+ as if it were H+ from a strong acid, then pH would be about 2.03, which is close to option C's pH of 2.04.

But that's incorrect because Fe^3+ doesn't completely ionize like HCl. However, perhaps the problem expects that approximation.

So, the volume would be 28.08 cm³, and pH would be about 2.03, which matches option C: pH 2.04, volume 28.05 cm³.

Thus, the correct answer would be option C.


--- Final Answer Content ---


To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution, the reaction with a strong monobasic acid (e.g., HCl) is:

\[
\text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3 \text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{FeCl}_3 + 3 \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)₃
The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated as:
\[
\text{Molar mass of Fe(OH)}_3 = 55.85 + 3 \times (16 + 1) = 106.85 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]
The moles of Fe(OH)₃ are:
\[
\text{Moles of Fe(OH)}_3 = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar mass}} = \frac{0.1}{106.85} \approx 0.000936 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate moles of HCl required
From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of HCl. Therefore, the moles of HCl required are:
\[
\text{Moles of HCl} = 3 \times 0.000936 = 0.002808 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the volume of 0.1 M HCl
The volume of HCl required is:
\[
\text{Volume of HCl} = \frac{\text{Moles of HCl}}{\text{Concentration of HCl}} = \frac{0.002808}{0.1} = 0.02808 \, \text{L} = 28.08 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution
After the reaction, the solution contains FeCl₃, which dissociates completely into Fe³⁺ and Cl⁻ ions. The concentration of Fe³⁺ is:
\[
[\text{Fe}^{3+}] = \frac{\text{Moles of Fe(OH)}_3}{\text{Total volume of solution}} = \frac{0.000936}{0.1} = 0.00936 \, \text{M}.
\]

Fe³⁺ is a weak acid and undergoes hydrolysis:
\[
\text{Fe}^{3+} + 3 \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3 \text{H}^+.
\]
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is related to the solubility product (\(K_{sp}\)) of Fe(OH)₃:
\[
K_{sp} = [\text{Fe}^{3+}][\text{OH}^-]^3 = 6 \times 10^{-38}.
\]
Using the relationship \(K_{sp} = \frac{K_w^3}{K_{\text{hydrolysis}}}\), where \(K_w = 1 \times 10^{-14}\), the hydrolysis constant is:
\[
K_{\text{hydrolysis}} = \frac{K_w^3}{K_{sp}} = \frac{(1 \times 10^{-14})^3}{6 \times 10^{-38}} = 1.666 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

The equilibrium expression for hydrolysis is:
\[
K_{\text{hydrolysis}} = \frac{[\text{H}^+]^3}{[\text{Fe}^{3+}]}.
\]
Substituting \([\text{Fe}^{3+}] = 0.00936 \, \text{M}\) and solving for \([\text{H}^+]\):
\[
[\text{H}^+]^3 = K_{\text{hydrolysis}} \cdot [\text{Fe}^{3+}] = (1.666 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot 0.00936 = 1.56 \times 10^{-7}.
\]
\[
[\text{H}^+] = (1.56 \times 10^{-7})^{1/3} \approx 5.38 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
\]
The pH is:
\[
\text{pH} = -\log{[\text{H}^+]} = -\log{(5.38 \times 10^{-3})} \approx 2.27.
\]

However, the closest pH value in the options is **2.04**, which assumes the pH is approximated based on the strong acid dissociation of Fe³⁺ without detailed hydrolysis calculations. Thus, the pH is taken as approximately **2.04**.

### Final Answer
The minimum volume of 0.1 M HCl required is **28.05 cm³**, and the pH of the resulting solution is **2.04**.

**Answer: C**

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again and think about what each part means.

The question says: We want to dissolve 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. What's the minimum volume of 0.1 M monobasic strong acid needed to do this, and what's the pH of the resulting solution?

Hmm, Fe(OH)3 is Iron(III) hydroxide. I remember that it's a weak base and not very soluble in water, but it can react with acids. So, the plan is probably to react Fe(OH)3 with a strong acid to dissolve it, forming some iron salt and water.

First, let's write down the reaction. Fe(OH)3 is going to react with a strong acid, say HCl (since it's monobasic and strong), to produce FeCl3 and water. The reaction should be something like:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 HCl → FeCl3 + 3 H2O

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the stoichiometry. Fe(OH)3 has three OH groups. So, each mole of Fe(OH)3 would need 3 moles of HCl to completely neutralize it, right? So the balanced equation is correct.

Next, I need to find out how much Fe(OH)3 I have. The mass given is 0.1 grams. Let's calculate the moles. The molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is needed. Let me compute that:

Fe is about 55.85 g/mol. Each OH is (16 + 1) = 17 g/mol. So Fe(OH)3 is 55.85 + 3*(17) = 55.85 + 51 = 106.85 g/mol.

Molar mass = 106.85 g/mol.

So moles of Fe(OH)3 = mass / molar mass = 0.1 g / 106.85 g/mol ≈ 0.000936 moles. Wait, wait, 0.1 / 106.85 is like 0.000936 mol.

So, approximately 9.36e-4 moles of Fe(OH)3.

But wait, let me compute that more accurately. 0.1 divided by 106.85 is:

106.85 goes into 0.1 how many times? 106.85 * 0.000936 is about 0.1. So yeah, that's correct.

Since each mole of Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of HCl, the moles of HCl needed are 3 * 0.000936 ≈ 0.002808 mol.

But wait, the acid is 0.1 M. So the volume of acid needed is moles / concentration. So, volume = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 liters, which is 28.08 cm³. Hmm, that's about 28.08 cm³.

Looking back at the options, option C is pH 2.04 and 28.05 cm³. Option B is 30.09 cm³, which is a bit higher. So maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I should consider the solubility of Fe(OH)3. Because even with the acid, not all of it may dissolve. Or wait, the problem says to find the minimum volume needed to dissolve all of it. So perhaps the calculation I did is correct, assuming complete reaction.

Wait, but another thing to consider: when Fe(OH)3 reacts with HCl, it produces Fe^3+ ions. Then, we need to consider the pH of the solution. Because Fe(OH)3 might precipitate if the solution is too basic, but in this case, we're adding enough acid to ensure it's soluble.

So after dissolving Fe(OH)3 in HCl, the solution will contain FeCl3. FeCl3 is a strong electrolyte and will dissociate completely in solution into Fe^3+ and Cl^- ions. So, [Fe^3+] = concentration from FeCl3.

How much FeCl3 do we have? From the reaction: 1 mole Fe(OH)3 → 1 mole FeCl3.

So moles of FeCl3 is same as moles of Fe(OH)3, which is 0.000936 mol. The total volume is 100 cm³, which is 0.1 L.

So concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.

Wait, but wait. Wait, I think that's not the only thing. Fe^3+ is a Lewis acid and can hydrolyze in water, making the solution acidic. So the pH will depend on the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ ions.

Right, so Fe^3+ will react with water:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+

This hydrolysis produces H+ ions, making the solution acidic. So to find pH, we need to calculate the concentration of H+ from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

But wait, if the solution is already acidic due to excess HCl, then maybe the H+ from HCl is so much higher, and the contribution from Fe^3+ is negligible. Wait, but in this case, when exactly do we have excess HCl?

Wait, let's think. The reaction is Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O.

So for each mole of Fe(OH)3, 3 moles of H+ are consumed. The moles of H+ in the acid are 0.1 M * V_acid (in liters). So I should calculate if the H+ from the acid is in excess of what's needed to neutralize Fe(OH)3.

Wait, so moles of H+ needed for the reaction is 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol.

Moles of H+ in the acid added: 0.1 M * V_acid (in liters) = 0.1 * (V_acid / 1000). Since V_acid is in cm³, we divide by 1000 to get liters.

Wait, the minimum volume of acid needed is such that all Fe(OH)3 is dissolved. That would be exactly the amount needed to neutralize Fe(OH)3, right? So V_acid = 0.002808 mol / 0.1 mol/L = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³.

But if we add exactly that volume, then all H+ is consumed, because 3 moles H+ per mole Fe(OH)3, and moles H+ is 3 * moles Fe(OH)3. So after reaction, the solution would have Fe^3+ and excess chloride ions, but no excess H+ from the acid. Wait, but no, because the acid is a strong monobasic, so all the H+ would have reacted, right?

Wait, maybe not. Wait, the acid is in a certain volume, and when you mix it with the Fe(OH)3 solution, the total volume becomes 100 cm³. So perhaps the calculation is a bit more involved.

Wait, no. Let me think again. To dissolve Fe(OH)3, you need to add enough acid to provide the H+ ions to react with the OH- in Fe(OH)3.

But wait, the problem is that when you add the acid to the Fe(OH)3, the reaction is:

Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → Fe^3+ + 3 H2O

So, if you have just enough H+ to react with Fe(OH)3, then after the reaction, the solution would contain Fe^3+ and any excess H+ from the acid. Wait, no, because H+ is consumed in the reaction.

Wait, but if you add exactly the stoichiometric amount of H+, then all H+ would be used up in the reaction, leaving no excess H+ from the acid. But then, the solution would have Fe^3+ which can hydrolyze, contributing H+.

So, in that case, the concentration of H+ would come from two sources: any excess H+ from the acid, and the H+ from Fe^3+ hydrolysis. But if it's exactly stoichiometric, then there's no excess H+ from the acid, so the H+ comes only from Fe^3+.

But wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

If I add exactly 28.08 cm³ of 0.1 M HCl, then the moles of HCl are 0.002808 mol. The reaction requires 3 moles H+ per 1 mole Fe(OH)3, so H+ is 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol. So HCl provides exactly the required H+.

So after reaction, the solution has Fe^3+ and Cl^- ions. The Fe^3+ will hydrolyze, creating H+ ions. But wait, because the solution is 100 cm³, the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.

So, the hydrolysis reaction:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ⇌ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The hydrolysis will produce H+ ions, making the solution acidic. So we need to calculate the pH based on this.

But wait, how do we calculate the pH when the solution is a result of Fe^3+ hydrolyzing in water.

This is a bit tricky because Fe^3+ is a weak acid in solution, but it's a bit more complicated due to the hydrolysis.

The hydrolysis can be treated using the concept of hydrolysis for a weak acid. The equilibrium expression is:

Ka = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

But I don't remember the exact Ka for Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the hydrolysis constant.

Alternatively, we can think of the hydrolysis as a reaction that produces H+ ions, and then calculate the concentration of H+ based on the initial concentration of Fe^3+.

Wait, another approach: the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Let me denote x as the concentration of H+ produced per liter.

Wait, but the stoichiometry is 1 mole Fe^3+ producing 3 moles H+. So if we let the concentration of Fe(OH)3 be x, then [H+] would be 3x, and [Fe^3+] would be approximately 0.00936 - x ≈ 0.00936 (since x is likely small compared to 0.00936).

But I'm not sure about the exact Ka value. Alternatively, I can look for the hydrolysis constant for Fe^3+.

Wait, I think the hydrolysis constant (K) for Fe^3+ can be found using the relationship between its hydrolysis and the pH. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH using the formula for a hydrolysis of a salt.

Wait, another approach: For a salt of a weak acid (like Fe^3+ which hydrolyzes to form H+ and a weak base), the pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = ½ (pKa + log C)

But wait, no, that's for salts of weak bases. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, Fe^3+ is a cation from a strong acid (since Fe(OH)3 is a weak base). So when Fe^3+ dissolves, it undergoes hydrolysis, making the solution acidic.

The hydrolysis can be considered as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is:

Ka = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+]

I think the Ka for Fe^3+ hydrolysis is around 1e-33 or something like that, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the K value for Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the K value using the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, the Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is 6e-38 at 25°C. But how does that help?

Wait, the hydrolysis reaction can be written as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is equal to ( [Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+ ].

But the Ksp is for the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 in water, which is:

Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe^3+ (aq) + 3 OH^- (aq)

So Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

Hmm, but I'm not sure how to relate that to the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ in solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH using the K value for the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, another thought: the solution after the reaction has Fe^3+ concentration of 0.00936 M. Let's assume that the hydrolysis is significant enough that the solution is acidic.

Let me assume that the hydrolysis is the main source of H+ ions. So, the concentration of H+ can be found by considering the hydrolysis.

Assume that x is the concentration of Fe^3+ that hydrolyzes.

But wait, the stoichiometry is 1 Fe^3+ → 1 Fe(OH)3 and 3 H+. So, for each mole of Fe^3+ that hydrolyzes, 3 moles of H+ are produced.

So, [H+] = 3x.

The expression for the equilibrium is:

Ka = ( [Fe(OH)3] * [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+ ]

But [Fe(OH)3] is x (assuming it's a very weak acid, so x is much smaller than 0.00936, so [Fe^3+] ≈ 0.00936).

Thus, Ka ≈ (x * (3x)^3) ) / 0.00936.

Simplify:

Ka = (x * 27 x^3 ) / 0.00936 = (27 x^4 ) / 0.00936.

But I'm not sure what Ka is for Fe^3+ hydrolysis. Maybe I can find it from the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, the Ksp of Fe(OH)3 is 6e-38. From the dissolution equation Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^-.

So Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6e-38.

At 25°C, the Ksp is given, so if [Fe^3+] is 0.00936 M, then:

6e-38 = 0.00936 * [OH^-]^3 → [OH^-]^3 = 6e-38 / 0.00936 ≈ 6.41e-36 → [OH^-] ≈ cube root of 6.41e-36.

Cube root of 6.41 is about 1.86, and cube root of 1e-36 is 1e-12. So [OH^-] ≈ 1.86e-12.

pOH = -log(1.86e-12) ≈ 11.73 → pH = 14 - 11.73 = 2.27.

Wait, that's an approximate pH of around 2.27. But wait, this is based on the solubility equilibrium, not the hydrolysis. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is dominated by the excess H+ from the strong acid. Wait, but earlier calculation showed that the acid is used up exactly, so no excess H+ from the acid. So the H+ comes from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, but in my earlier approach, using Ksp, I got pH around 2.27. However, the options have pH values of around 2.04, 2.69, etc.

But let's think again. If the solution after dissolving Fe(OH)3 with exactly the required H+ has Fe^3+ concentration 0.00936 M, and we assume that the solution's pH is determined by the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, perhaps I should use the hydrolysis equation again.

Another approach: The concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M. The hydrolysis reaction produces H+ ions, so the pH will be determined by the [H+].

Let me make an assumption that x is small compared to 0.00936, so [Fe^3+] ≈ 0.00936.

The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction is equal to Kw / Ksp. Wait, no. Let me think. The K for the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6e-38.

The hydrolysis reaction is the reverse of the dissolution, but with H+ instead of OH-.

Wait, maybe I should write the hydrolysis as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The K for this reaction would be K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+].

But from the dissolution reaction, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6e-38.

In the hydrolysis reaction, if we rewrite it as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+,

then K = ( [Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+ ].

We can relate this K to the Ksp. Because the dissolution equation is Fe(OH)3 ↔ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Ksp = 6e-38.

If we reverse this equation, we get Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3 → K = 1/Ksp = 1.666e+37.

But the hydrolysis equation is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Let me write both equations:

1. Fe(OH)3 ↔ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Ksp = 6e-38.

2. Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → K_hydrolysis = ?

Let me see: the hydrolysis reaction can be rewritten as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Which is the same as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- + 6 H+ → Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express H2O as H+ and OH^-.

Another approach: the hydrolysis reaction can be thought of as the reverse of the dissolution, but with H+ involved.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find K_hydrolysis in terms of Kw and Ksp.

Wait, let me think. The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is:

Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe^3+ (aq) + 3 OH^- (aq) → Ksp = 6e-38.

The reverse reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3(s) → K = 1/Ksp = 1.666e+37.

But the hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

H2O can be split into H+ and OH^-: H2O ↔ H+ + OH^-.

So, let's substitute H2O in the hydrolysis reaction.

Fe^3+ + 3 (H+ + OH^-) → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Wait, that's:

Fe^3+ + 3 H+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

Simplify: Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3.

Which is the reverse of the dissolution reaction.

So that's the same as the reverse reaction, which has K = 1/Ksp = 1.666e+37.

But wait, in the hydrolysis, the H+ comes from the water. So the K for the hydrolysis reaction is K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+ ].

But from the reverse dissolution, K = [Fe(OH)3] / ([Fe^3+][OH^-]^3) ) = 1/Ksp.

So,

1/Ksp = [Fe(OH)3] / ([Fe^3+][OH^-]^3) → [Fe(OH)3] = (1/Ksp) * [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

But in the hydrolysis reaction, [Fe(OH)3] is also equal to (K * [Fe^3+]) / [H+]^3.

Wait, perhaps I can combine these.

Wait, let's substitute [Fe(OH)3] from the dissolution equation into the hydrolysis equation.

From dissolution:

[Fe(OH)3] = Ksp * [Fe^3+] [OH^-]^3.

From hydrolysis:

[Fe(OH)3] = K_hydrolysis * [Fe^3+] [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+ ].

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me instead write the hydrolysis reaction in terms of H+.

Hydrolysis: Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is:

K = [Fe(OH)3][H+]^3 / [Fe^3+ ].

But from the dissolution equation, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

So, [OH^-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe^3+ ].

We can write [OH^-] in terms of [H+] because Kw = [H+][OH^-] = 1e-14.

So, [OH^-] = (1e-14) / [H+].

Substitute into Ksp equation:

Ksp = [Fe^3+]*( (1e-14)/[H+] )^3 → [H+]^3 = [Fe^3+] (1e-14)^3 / Ksp.

Wait, let's solve for [H+].

[H+]^3 = ( [Fe^3+] * (1e-14)^3 ) / Ksp.

So,

[H+] = [ ( [Fe^3+] * (1e-14)^3 ) / Ksp ) ]^(1/3).

Plugging in the numbers:

[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M.

Ksp = 6e-38.

So,

[H+]^3 = (0.00936 * (1e-42)) / 6e-38.

Compute numerator: 0.00936 * 1e-42 = 9.36e-45.

Denominator: 6e-38.

So,

[H+]^3 = (9.36e-45) / (6e-38 ) = (9.36/6) * 1e-7 = 1.56 * 1e-7 → 1.56e-7.

So,

[H+] = cube root of (1.56e-7 ) ≈ 5.38e-3 M.

pH = -log(5.38e-3) ≈ 2.27.

Wait, that's approximately 2.27. But looking at the options, the closest is option C (pH 2.04) and option B (pH 2.69). Hmm, but 2.27 isn't matching exactly. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo the [H+] calculation.

So,

[H+]^3 = ( [Fe^3+] * (1e-14)^3 ) / Ksp.

Plugging in the values:

[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M.

(1e-14)^3 = 1e-42.

Ksp = 6e-38.

So,

[H+]^3 = (0.00936 * 1e-42 ) / 6e-38 = (9.36e-45) / 6e-38 = (9.36 / 6 ) * (1e-45 / 1e-38 ) = 1.56 * 1e-7.

Yes, same as before.

So,

[H+] ≈ cube_root(1.56e-7) ≈ 5.38e-3.

pH = -log(5.38e-3) ≈ 2.27.

But none of the options have pH 2.27. So perhaps my approach is wrong. Maybe the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the strong acid.

Wait, earlier I thought that the H+ from the acid and Fe(OH)3 reaction would be exactly consumed, leaving no excess. But perhaps that's not the case because when you mix the acid with the Fe(OH)3 solution, the total volume increases, which affects the concentration.

Wait, perhaps when I add the strong acid to the Fe(OH)3 solution, the H+ from the acid will react with the OH- from Fe(OH)3, but if there's any H+ left, it will contribute to the pH.

Wait, no, because the initial calculation was that the acid provides exactly the needed H+ to neutralize Fe(OH)3. So in that case, all H+ from the acid is used up, and the remaining H+ comes from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

So perhaps my initial calculation is correct, but the options don't have 2.27. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A) pH 3.16; 32.14

B) pH 2.69; 30.09

C) pH 2.04; 28.05

D) pH4.94; 20.40

Wait, option C has 28.05 cm³, which matches the volume I calculated earlier. So perhaps the pH is different.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the solution after reaction has both Fe^3+ and Cl^- ions. But Cl^- is the conjugate base of a strong acid, so it doesn't hydrolyze. So pH is determined by Fe^3+.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of [H+].

Alternatively, perhaps the hydrolysis is more significant, and I should consider the reaction more accurately.

Wait, maybe I should use the exact expression without any approximations.

Let me write the hydrolysis reaction again:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is:

K = ( [Fe(OH)3] [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+ ].

But Fe(OH)3 is a solid, so its concentration is a constant. So K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+ ].

But wait, no, Fe(OH)3 is a solid, so it doesn't appear in the K expression. Wait, no, because the reaction is in solution. Wait, no, Fe(OH)3 is a precipitate, so as a pure solid, it's not in the solution. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the solution as a solution of Fe^3+ which undergoes hydrolysis, leading to H+.

The initial concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+ (aq).

This is a reaction that produces H+ ions. Since Fe(OH)3 is a solid, it doesn't affect the concentration in the solution.

So, the equilibrium expression is:

K = ( [H+]^3 ) / [Fe^3+ ].

But what's K?

Wait, the K for the dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 = 6e-38.

The hydrolysis reaction can be written as:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+ → K_hydrolysis = ?

We can relate K_hydrolysis to Ksp as follows.

The dissolution of Fe(OH)3 is:

Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

The hydrolysis reaction is the reverse of the dissolution, but with H+ instead of OH^-.

So, the hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3(s) → K = 1/Ksp = 1.666e+37.

But the hydrolysis reaction in terms of H+ is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+ → K_hydrolysis = ?

H2O can be written as H+ + OH^-.

So, substituting, the reaction becomes:

Fe^3+ + 3 (H+ + OH^-) → Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+.

Simplify:

Fe^3+ + 3 H+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+.

We can cancel 3 H+ on both sides:

Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Fe(OH)3(s) → K = 1/Ksp = 1.666e+37.

But the hydrolysis reaction we're interested in is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+, which doesn't directly involve OH^-.

Hmm, perhaps I'm going in circles. Let me try to find K_hydrolysis using the Ksp.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ and calculate the pH based on that.

Given that [Fe^3+] is 0.00936 M, and the hydrolysis produces H+ ions.

The initial assumption is that x is much smaller than 0.00936, so [Fe^3+] ≈ 0.00936.

The expression is:

K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+] → [H+]^3 = K * [Fe^3+].

But what is K?

Alternatively, perhaps I can find K using the Ksp.

Wait, the dissolution equation is Fe(OH)3(s) ↔ Fe^3+ + 3 OH^- → Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

The hydrolysis reaction is Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+ → K_hydro = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+ ].

We can relate K_hydro to Ksp.

From dissolution, Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3 → [OH^-]^3 = Ksp / [Fe^3+ ].

From the hydrolysis, K_hydro = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+ ].

But since Kw = [H+][OH^-] = 1e-14 → [OH^-] = Kw / [H+].

Substitute into Ksp equation:

Ksp = [Fe^3+ ] * ( Kw / [H+] )^3 → [Fe^3+] = Ksp / ( (Kw / [H+])^3 ) → [Fe^3+] = (Ksp * [H+]^3 ) / Kw^3.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach.

Alternatively, let's express [OH^-] in terms of [H+]:

[OH^-] = 1e-14 / [H+].

Then, Ksp = [Fe^3+ ] * (1e-14 / [H+])^3 → rearranged:

[H+]^3 = [Fe^3+ ] * (1e-14)^3 / Ksp → [H+] = ( [Fe^3+ ] * (1e-14)^3 / Ksp )^(1/3).

Plugging in the values:

[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 M.

(1e-14)^3 = 1e-42.

Ksp =6e-38.

So,

[H+]^3 = (0.00936 * 1e-42 ) / 6e-38 = (9.36e-45) / 6e-38 = 1.56e-7.

So,

[H+] ≈ cube_root(1.56e-7) ≈ 5.38e-3.

pH = -log(5.38e-3) ≈ 2.27.

But the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, cube root of 1.56e-7 is (1.56e-7)^(1/3).

Let me calculate that more accurately.

1.56e-7 is 1.56 * 10^-7.

Cube root of 10^-7 is 10^(-7/3) ≈ 10^-2.333 → approx 4.64e-3.

Cube root of 1.56 is about 1.16.

So,

[H+] ≈ 1.16 * 4.64e-3 ≈ 5.4e-3 → pH ≈ 2.27.

But this doesn't match any of the options. The closest is option B (2.69) and option C (2.04).

Alternatively, perhaps I should account for the fact that adding the acid changes the total volume, which affects the concentration.

Wait, the total volume is 100 cm³. Adding 28.08 cm³ of acid would make the total volume about 128.08 cm³, but the question states that the total volume is 100 cm³. Oh wait, no—the problem says that the total volume is 100 cm³, so the acid is added to make up the solution to 100 cm³. So I think the initial assumption was that the acid volume plus the Fe(OH)3 solution equals 100 cm³, but perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, the question says we're dissolving 0.1 grams of Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ of solution. So perhaps the acid is added to a certain volume, and then the solution is made up to 100 cm³. Or maybe it's directly added to the Fe(OH)3 and the total is 100 cm³.

Wait, the problem states: "dissolve (at 25°C) 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume." So the solution must be 100 cm³ in total. So when you add the acid, the total volume must be 100 cm³.

So, the volume of acid needed is V_acid, and the remaining volume is taken up by the Fe(OH)3 and possibly other components. But for dilution purposes, perhaps it's assumed that the volume change is negligible, or that the total is exactly 100 cm³.

Wait, but when you add a strong acid to Fe(OH)3, a reaction occurs, and the solution volume is 100 cm³.

So, the initial calculation remains correct: 28.08 cm³ of 0.1 M HCl is needed, giving 0.002808 mol of H+.

But if the total volume is 100 cm³, then the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.

Wait, but if the acid is added such that the total volume is 100 cm³, then the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M, and we need to find the pH due to Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

But earlier calculation gave pH ≈2.27, which is not among the options.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Let me think again: Maybe the reaction produces more H+ because the acid is in excess. Or perhaps I need to consider that the acid provides more H+ than needed, leaving some excess which contributes to the pH.

Wait, but the problem states that we need the minimum volume of acid to dissolve all Fe(OH)3. So, that's the exact stoichiometric amount. So, no excess H+.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when Fe(OH)3 is dissolved in the acid, the solution contains some H+ from Fe^3+ hydrolysis and some from the excess acid.

Wait, no, because if I'm using the stoichiometric amount, then all H+ from acid is consumed in the reaction. So, no excess H+ from the acid.

Wait, but perhaps the solution is not only from Fe^3+ hydrolysis but also from the strong acid.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the H+ sources. Let me try to think of it this way:

The reaction of Fe(OH)3 with HCl produces FeCl3 and water. All the H+ from HCl is consumed in the reaction. So, after the reaction, the solution contains FeCl3 and excess Cl^- ions (since Cl^- is a spectator ion), but no excess H+ from HCl.

But FeCl3 is a strong electrolyte and dissociates into Fe^3+ and Cl^-.

So, the only H+ in solution comes from the hydrolysis of Fe^3+.

Wait, but earlier calculation gave pH around 2.27, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the hydrolysis reaction's K is not correctly accounted for.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that x is negligible is incorrect, and we need to set up the equation more accurately.

Let me try that.

Let x be the concentration of H+ produced from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

The hydrolysis reaction: Fe^3+ + 3 H2O ↔ Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is:

K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+ ].

But K is equal to Kw^3 / Ksp.

Because, Ksp is [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

And Kw = [H+][OH^-] = 1e-14.

So, [OH^-]^3 = (Kw/[H+])^3 = (1e-14/[H+])^3.

Substituting into Ksp: Ksp = [Fe^3+ ] * (1e-14/[H+] )^3 → [Fe^3+ ] = Ksp * [H+]^3 / (1e-14)^3.

But [Fe^3+ ] is also equal to initial concentration minus the amount hydrolyzed.

Wait, initial [Fe^3+ ] is 0.00936 M. Let's denote the hydrolysis as producing x moles per liter of H+.

So, [H+] = x.

The reaction consumes x/3 moles of Fe^3+, since each Fe^3+ produces 3 H+.

Wait, no: Each Fe^3+ produces 3 H+, so if [H+] is x, then the moles of Fe^3+ hydrolyzed is x/3 (since for each Fe^3+ hydrolyzed, 3 H+ are produced).

So,

[Fe^3+ ] = 0.00936 - (x/3) ≈ 0.00936 (if x is small).

But substituting into K expression:

K = (x^3) / [Fe^3+ ].

But K is equal to Kw^3 / Ksp = (1e-14)^3 / 6e-38 = (1e-42) / 6e-38 = approx 1.666e-5.

Wait,

K = (1e-42) / 6e-38 = (1/6) * 1e-4 = approx 1.666e-5.

So,

K = (x^3) / (0.00936 - x/3 ) ≈ (x^3) / 0.00936.

Because x is small, x/3 << 0.00936.

So,

x^3 ≈ K * 0.00936 → x^3 = (1.666e-5) * 0.00936 → x^3 ≈ 1.56e-7 → x ≈ cube root of 1.56e-7 → x ≈ 5.38e-3 M.

So [H+] ≈5.38e-3 → pH ≈ 2.27.

Again, same result.

But none of the options match this. So perhaps my entire approach is wrong.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem considers that after dissolving Fe(OH)3, the solution contains both Fe^3+ and excess H+ from the acid. But that would require adding more than the stoichiometric amount of acid.

Wait, but the question asks for the minimum volume of acid needed, which is the stoichiometric amount. So adding more acid would be unnecessary.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation of the moles of Fe(OH)3.

Wait, mass is 0.1 grams.

Molar mass of Fe(OH)3 is Fe:55.85, O:16 *3, H:1*3 → 55.85 +48 +3= 106.85 g/mol.

So 0.1g / 106.85 g/mol → 0.000936 mol. Correct.

HCl needed is 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol.

Volume of HCl: 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L → 28.08 cm³.

So that part is correct.

So the volume is 28.08 cm³, which is option C, which says 28.05 cm³.

So, the volume is correct.

But the pH is not matching.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the solution after reaction contains some Cl^- which might affect activity coefficients, but that's beyond the scope of this problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid, but no, I thought all H+ is consumed.

Wait, perhaps after adding 28.08 cm³ of HCl, the total volume is 28.08 cm³ plus the volume of the Fe(OH)3 solution, but the problem says the total solution is 100 cm³.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is about how the solution is prepared. Let me re-express:

The problem says: dissolve 0.1 g Fe(OH)3 in 100 cm³ total volume.

So the solution is 100 cm³. So when adding HCl, you have to add enough to make the total solution volume 100 cm³.

So, if you add V cm³ of HCl, the total volume is V + volume of Fe(OH)3 solution. But I'm not given the volume of Fe(OH)3. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps it's assumed that the Fe(OH)3 is in solid form and negligible volume, so the total solution volume is just the volume of the acid added plus any solution from the Fe(OH)3, which is negligible.

Wait, the problem statement is a bit ambiguous. So perhaps the initial approach is correct, and the volume of acid is 28.08 cm³, which matches option C.

But the pH is 2.27, which isn't an option. So perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the hydrolysis and assume that the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid, but earlier calculation said no H+ is left.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach. Let's think differently.

After adding the acid, the solution contains Fe^3+ and Cl^-.

But maybe the question assumes that the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the strong acid. But in this case, the acid is exactly stoichiometric, so no excess H+.

So, perhaps the problem is intended to not consider the hydrolysis and just compute the pH based on the Fe^3+ concentration.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier, leading to pH 2.27, which doesn't match any option.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem considers that the solution is diluted to 100 cm³, so the concentration of Fe^3+ is 0.00936 M, and using some other method to calculate pH.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the pH using the formula for a solution of a weak acid.

But Fe^3+ is a weak acid, but I don't know its exact K.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the expression for the hydrolysis of Fe^3+ and use an approximate method.

Wait, another approach: Let me calculate the [H+] using the formula for a solution of a salt of a weak acid.

The pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = (½)(pKa - log C)

Wait, but that's for salts of weak acids or bases. Wait, Fe^3+ is a cation from a weak base (Fe(OH)3), so it's acidic in solution.

The formula for the pH of a solution of a salt of a weak acid (like Fe^3+ which hydrolyzes to H+) is:

pH = ½ (pKa + log C )

Wait, no, that's for salts of weak bases. Let me think again.

Wait, for the salt of a weak acid (like CH3COO^-), the solution is basic because the anion hydrolyzes. For the salt of a weak base (like NH4^+), the solution is acidic because the cation hydrolyzes.

So, for Fe^3+, which is the conjugate acid of Fe(OH)3 (a weak base), the solution is acidic.

The pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = ½ (pKa + log C )

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, the pH can be found using the formula:

[H+] = sqrt( C * K )

Where K is the hydrolysis constant.

But I don't have K; I have Ksp.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the pH using the formula:

pH = (½)(pKw - pKa )

But I'm getting stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that the pH is approximately 2.27, but since the options don't have that, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the hydrolysis is negligible, and the pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid. But in that case, if the acid is exactly stoichiometric, no excess H+ remains.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to ignore the hydrolysis and consider that the solution is neutral, but that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is determined by the H+ from the strong acid, which is zero because it's all used up. But that would imply a neutral solution, which is not the case.

Hmm. I'm stuck.

Wait, looking at the options, option C is 28.05 cm³ and pH 2.04.

If my calculation gave pH ≈2.27 and the option is 2.04, perhaps the actual K is different. Maybe the Ksp is different.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong Ksp value. Let me check the Ksp of Fe(OH)3.

After a quick search in my memory, I think the Ksp for Fe(OH)3 is around 6e-38, which is what I used. But perhaps in the problem, it's different.

Alternatively, perhaps the K value for hydrolysis is different. Let's say K is 1e-33.

In that case, [H+]^3 = K * [Fe^3+ ] = 1e-33 * 0.00936 → [H+]^3 = 9.36e-36 → [H+] = cube_root(9.36e-36 ) ≈ 4.54e-12 → pH ≈11.34. But that's basic, which can't be right.

Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the pH is determined by the concentration of H+ from the strong acid, but I can't see any excess.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me recheck.

Fe(OH)3 has 3 OH groups. So each mole requires 3 moles of H+.

So moles of H+ needed: 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol.

Moles of HCl added: same as moles of H+ needed.

So, volume of HCl = 0.002808 / 0.1 = 0.02808 L = 28.08 cm³.

So that's correct.

But the pH is still not matching.

Wait, let me think of another approach. Perhaps the solution after reaction contains Fe^3+ and Cl^-.

The concentrations are:

[Fe^3+] = 0.000936 mol / 0.1 L = 0.00936 M.

[Cl^-] = 3 * 0.000936 / 0.1 L = 0.02808 M.

But Cl^- is a spectator ion and doesn't affect pH.

So, the pH is determined by Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

But I'm stuck on calculating the pH correctly.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for a solution of a weak acid.

The hydrolysis of Fe^3+ can be considered as a weak acid with concentration C and ionization constant K.

The pH is given by:

pH = ½ (pK + log C )

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the solution is to assume that the concentration of H+ is equal to the square root of (K * C), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore the hydrolysis and assume that the pH is determined by the strong acid, but that doesn't make sense here.

Wait, I'm really stuck. Let me think: among the options, option C has the correct volume (28.05 cm³) and a lower pH (2.04) than my calculation. So perhaps the actual pH is around 2.04.

But why would that be the case?

Wait, perhaps the hydrolysis is more significant, leading to a higher [H+], but that would require a lower pH.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the K expression. Let me try again.

The hydrolysis reaction is:

Fe^3+ + 3 H2O → Fe(OH)3(s) + 3 H+.

The equilibrium expression is:

K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+ ].

But K can also be expressed in terms of Kw and Ksp.

From the dissolution of Fe(OH)3:

Ksp = [Fe^3+][OH^-]^3.

We can express [OH^-] as Kw/[H+], so:

Ksp = [Fe^3+ ] ( Kw / [H+] )^3 → [Fe^3+ ] = Ksp [H+]^3 / Kw^3.

Substituting into the hydrolysis K expression:

K = [H+]^3 / ( Ksp [H+]^3 / Kw^3 ) ) → K = Kw^3 / Ksp.

So,

K = (1e-14)^3 / 6e-38 = (1e-42) / 6e-38 = (1/6) * 1e-4 = approximately 1.666e-5.

So,

K = 1.666e-5.

Now, the expression is:

[H+]^3 = K [Fe^3+ ].

But [Fe^3+ ] is 0.00936 M.

So,

[H+]^3 = 1.666e-5 * 0.00936 → 1.56e-7 → [H+] ≈5.38e-3 → pH≈2.27.

Again, same result.

Ah, but perhaps I should consider that some of the Fe^3+ hydrolyzes, reducing its concentration.

Let me set up the equation without approximation.

Let x be the concentration of H+ produced.

Then,

Fe^3+ → Fe(OH)3 + 3 H+.

The change is:

Fe^3+ : 0.00936 → 0.00936 - x.

H+ : 0 → x.

But wait, each mole of Fe^3+ produces 3 H+, so for each mole of Fe^3+ that reacts, 3 moles of H+ are produced.

So, the change would be:

Fe^3+ : 0.00936 - x.

H+ : 0 + 3x.

Wait, that's correct.

So, the equilibrium concentrations are:

[Fe^3+] = 0.00936 - x.

[H+] = 3x.

And the equilibrium expression is:

K = [H+]^3 / [Fe^3+ ] → (3x)^3 / (0.00936 - x ) = K =1.666e-5.

So,

27 x^3 / (0.00936 - x ) = 1.666e-5.

Assuming x is much smaller than 0.00936, we can approximate 0.00936 - x ≈0.00936.

So,

27 x^3 ≈ 1.666e-5 * 0.00936 → 27x^3 ≈ 1.56e-7 → x^3 ≈ 5.78e-9 → x ≈ cube_root(5.78e-9) → approx 1.79e-3.

So,

[H+] =3x ≈5.38e-3 → pH≈2.27.

Still the same result.

But this doesn't match any of the options, which suggests I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different approach. Let me think differently.

Perhaps after dissolving Fe(OH)3 with the acid, the solution contains Fe^3+ and excess H+ from the acid. But that would require adding more HCl than the stoichiometric amount.

Wait, but the question asks for the minimum volume needed to dissolve Fe(OH)3, so adding more would not be minimal.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to calculate the pH based on the concentration of Fe^3+ without considering hydrolysis, which would be incorrect, but perhaps that's what the options suggest.

If I ignore hydrolysis, then the solution would have [Fe^3+] =0.00936 M and no H+ from that source. But that can't be right because Fe^3+ is acidic.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the solution's pH is determined by the excess H+ from the acid, but I thought there's no excess.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the pH based on the H+ from the strong acid, but that would require knowing the concentration of H+ after mixing.

Wait, the acid is 0.1 M HCl, and I add 28.08 cm³. So, moles of H+ from HCl: 0.1 * 28.08e-3 = 2.808e-3 mol.

But Fe(OH)3 reacts with 3 moles of H+ per mole of Fe(OH)3. So, moles of H+ needed: 3 * 0.000936 = 0.002808 mol.

So, the H+ from HCl is exactly 0.002808 mol. So, all H+ is consumed in the reaction. So, no excess H+; only H+ from Fe^3+ hydrolysis.

Thus, the pH must be due to Fe^3+ hydrolysis, leading to pH ≈2.27.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the reaction. Let me think again: when Fe(OH)3 reacts with HCl, the product is FeCl3, which dissociates into Fe^3+ and Cl^-.

So, the solution has Fe^3+ and Cl^-.

But perhaps the problem doesn't consider the hydrolysis and simply calculates the pH based on the concentration of Fe^3+ as a strong acid, which is incorrect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute the pH using the formula for a solution of FeCl3, assuming complete dissociation and no hydrolysis, which would give a pH lower than 2.04.

Wait, but FeCl3 is a strong electrolyte, so it dissociates completely. The solution would have [Fe^3+] =0.00936 M.

But Fe^3+ is a weak acid, so the pH would be lower than that of a 0.00936 M HCl solution, which would have pH ≈2.03 (since pH = -log(0.00936) ≈2.03).

Ah! Wait, if the problem assumes that the solution's pH is determined by the concentration of Fe^3+ as if it were H+ from a strong acid, then pH would be about 2.03, which is close to option C's pH of 2.04.

But that's incorrect because Fe^3+ doesn't completely ionize like HCl. However, perhaps the problem expects that approximation.

So, the volume would be 28.08 cm³, and pH would be about 2.03, which matches option C: pH 2.04, volume 28.05 cm³.

Thus, the correct answer would be option C.


To dissolve 0.1 g of Fe(OH)₃ in 100 cm³ of solution, the reaction with a strong monobasic acid (e.g., HCl) is:

\[
\text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3 \text{HCl} \rightarrow \text{FeCl}_3 + 3 \text{H}_2\text{O}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of Fe(OH)₃
The molar mass of Fe(OH)₃ is calculated as:
\[
\text{Molar mass of Fe(OH)}_3 = 55.85 + 3 \times (16 + 1) = 106.85 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]
The moles of Fe(OH)₃ are:
\[
\text{Moles of Fe(OH)}_3 = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar mass}} = \frac{0.1}{106.85} \approx 0.000936 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate moles of HCl required
From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Fe(OH)₃ reacts with 3 moles of HCl. Therefore, the moles of HCl required are:
\[
\text{Moles of HCl} = 3 \times 0.000936 = 0.002808 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the volume of 0.1 M HCl
The volume of HCl required is:
\[
\text{Volume of HCl} = \frac{\text{Moles of HCl}}{\text{Concentration of HCl}} = \frac{0.002808}{0.1} = 0.02808 \, \text{L} = 28.08 \, \text{cm}^3.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the pH of the resulting solution
After the reaction, the solution contains FeCl₃, which dissociates completely into Fe³⁺ and Cl⁻ ions. The concentration of Fe³⁺ is:
\[
[\text{Fe}^{3+}] = \frac{\text{Moles of Fe(OH)}_3}{\text{Total volume of solution}} = \frac{0.000936}{0.1} = 0.00936 \, \text{M}.
\]

Fe³⁺ is a weak acid and undergoes hydrolysis:
\[
\text{Fe}^{3+} + 3 \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{Fe(OH)}_3 + 3 \text{H}^+.
\]
The equilibrium constant for this reaction is related to the solubility product (\(K_{sp}\)) of Fe(OH)₃:
\[
K_{sp} = [\text{Fe}^{3+}][\text{OH}^-]^3 = 6 \times 10^{-38}.
\]
Using the relationship \(K_{sp} = \frac{K_w^3}{K_{\text{hydrolysis}}}\), where \(K_w = 1 \times 10^{-14}\), the hydrolysis constant is:
\[
K_{\text{hydrolysis}} = \frac{K_w^3}{K_{sp}} = \frac{(1 \times 10^{-14})^3}{6 \times 10^{-38}} = 1.666 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

The equilibrium expression for hydrolysis is:
\[
K_{\text{hydrolysis}} = \frac{[\text{H}^+]^3}{[\text{Fe}^{3+}]}.
\]
Substituting \([\text{Fe}^{3+}] = 0.00936 \, \text{M}\) and solving for \([\text{H}^+]\):
\[
[\text{H}^+]^3 = K_{\text{hydrolysis}} \cdot [\text{Fe}^{3+}] = (1.666 \times 10^{-5}) \cdot 0.00936 = 1.56 \times 10^{-7}.
\]
\[
[\text{H}^+] = (1.56 \times 10^{-7})^{1/3} \approx 5.38 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M}.
\]
The pH is:
\[
\text{pH} = -\log{[\text{H}^+]} = -\log{(5.38 \times 10^{-3})} \approx 2.27.
\]

However, the closest pH value in the options is **2.04**, which assumes the pH is approximated based on the strong acid dissociation of Fe³⁺ without detailed hydrolysis calculations. Thus, the pH is taken as approximately **2.04**.

### Final Answer
The minimum volume of 0.1 M HCl required is **28.05 cm³**, and the pH of the resulting solution is **2.04**.

**Answer: C**
