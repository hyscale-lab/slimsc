Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem describes a series of reactions involving substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Hmm, molecular symmetry groups... I remember these are point groups that describe the symmetry of a molecule. Common ones include things like D4h or C2v. So first, I need to figure out what the structure of E is because the symmetry depends on that.

Let's break down the reactions step by step. 

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. 8 equivalents suggests a stoichiometric ratio of 1:8. I'm thinking maybe A is an element, perhaps something like sulfur or phosphorus, but I'm not sure. But wait, the product is a bright red solid, which makes me think of something like sulfur dioxide or maybe another compound with a red color. Alternatively, perhaps it's a transition metal complex. Wait, another thought: maybe A is sodium (Na) and B is chlorine (Cl2). 8 equivalents would mean 4 moles of Cl2 for each mole of Na. But sodium is a solid, and Cl2 is a gas. The reaction would be 4 Na + 2 Cl2 → 2 NaCl. Oh wait, that's 4 moles of Na and 2 moles of Cl2, which is a 2:1 ratio. But here, the ratio is 1:8, which is different. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is phosphorus (P4) reacting with Cl2. P4 + 6 Cl2 → 4 PCl3, but that's 1:6 ratio. But the given ratio is 1:8. Hmm, not matching. Another possibility: maybe A is aluminum (Al) and B is chlorine. 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. That's 2:3 ratio—still doesn't fit 1:8.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that combines with B in a higher ratio. Alternatively, perhaps B is not a diatomic gas. Wait, another idea: maybe B is oxygen gas (O2). So, solid A reacts with O2 to form C. Let's say A is Fe (iron). Fe reacts with O2 to form FeO or Fe3O4, but I'm not sure about the ratio here. Fe3O4 would require (3 Fe)/(4 O2), which is a 3:4 ratio. Not matching 1:8.

Wait, maybe A is sulfur (S8) reacting with something? S8 is a solid, and maybe B is something else. Alternatively, perhaps A is carbon (C) and B is something like F2 (fluorine gas). C + 4 F2 → CF4. That's a 1:4 ratio. Not matching 1:8.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is something like Mg reacting with O2 to form MgO. Mg is solid, O2 is gas. The reaction is 2 Mg + O2 → 2 MgO. So, 2:1 ratio. Doesn't match 1:8.

Hmm, maybe another approach. The product C reacts with D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Also, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

So when C reacts with water, it produces A and two acids. If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, that suggests that perhaps C is a salt that can undergo hydrolysis. For example, maybe C is an acid chloride. Because acid chlorides when hydrolysed with water produce carboxylic acids (weak) and HCl (strong). Wait, but acid chlorides are typically when the acid is something like RCOCl, which upon hydrolysis gives RCOOH (weak) and HCl (strong). However, in that case, the reaction would be RCOCl + H2O → RCOOH + HCl.

So if C is an acid chloride, then what's A? Because when C reacts with water, it gives back A. If C is RCOCl, then A would be RCOOH (the acid). But wait, that doesn't fit because the reaction would produce RCOOH and HCl. Wait, but the problem says C reacting with water gives A, F, and G. So, perhaps A is RCOOH, F is HCl, and G is something else? Or maybe F is HCl and G is another acid. Wait, but RCOCl + H2O → RCOOH + HCl. So A would be RCOOH, F is HCl (strong acid), G is RCOOH (weak acid). But the question says F and G are two different acids. So if in this case, both are RCOOH and HCl, but if RCOOH is F and HCl is G, but F is strong and G is weak. But HCl is a strong acid and RCOOH is weak. So F would be HCl (strong), G would be RCOOH (weak). That could fit. So in that case, C would be RCOCl, which is an acid chloride.

So, if C is RCOCl, then product E comes from C reacting with D. The reaction is C + 2 D → E. Let's think about what D could be. D is a gas that reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So B and D react to form H, a solvent. Hmm, what solvents are formed from the reaction of gases? Maybe H is H2O, but that's a liquid. Alternatively, maybe H is something like HCl, which is a gas but can be a solvent in some cases. Or maybe H is NH3, but that's a gas as well. Alternatively, H could be something like CO2, but that's not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, the reaction of B and D in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Let me think, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then, H would be HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, B is O2, D is H2, H is H2O. That makes sense. H2O is a solvent. So O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. But the ratio here is 1:2 for B:D. But the question says 1:1 ratio. So that doesn't fit.

Another possibility: B is Cl2 and D is CH4. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is something else. Wait, another angle: D is a gas. So D could be H2 if B is something else.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is CH4. Reaction of Cl2 and CH4 in presence of light gives CH2Cl and HCl, but that's more of a substitution reaction. Not sure if that gives a solvent.

Wait, perhaps B is SO3 and D is H2O? But SO3 is a gas, and H2O is a liquid. Reaction would form H2SO4, but that's a liquid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2 and D is O2. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form H2O. H2O is a solvent. So B is H2, D is O2. So in that case, H is H2O. That would fit. So B is H2 (gas), D is O2 (gas). They react in 1:1 ratio to form H2O (liquid, but also used as a solvent, though not the primary one). Hmm, but H2O is a solvent in many contexts.

But then, the first reaction is A (solid) + 8 equivalents of B (H2) → C (bright red). So, A + 8 H2 → C.

What solid A would react with H2 to form a bright red product? Maybe a metal that forms a sulfide? Wait, no, H2 is a reducing agent. Maybe A is Fe3O4? Hmm, Fe3O4 plus H2 forms Fe and water. But that's more of a reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide. For example, FeO reacting with H2 to form Fe and H2O. But then, the color of FeO is black, not red.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product C is a transition metal complex. Bright red could be like lead dioxide (PbO2) but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's lead(IV) oxide, which is dark brown. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product C is a compound of sulfur. Sulfur is bright yellow, but perhaps a different form? Or maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another approach: since C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. If C is an acid chloride (RCOCl), then A is RCOOH, F is HCl, and G is RCOOH. But wait, that would mean F and G are the same, which contradicts the problem statement. So perhaps C is a different type of compound.

Wait, maybe C is an anhydride. For instance, if C is a metal carbonate anhydride, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. Wait, another idea: C could be a sulfate ester, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, considering the earlier thought about C being an acid chloride, perhaps the reaction is:

C (RCOCl) + 2 D → E.

What would D be in that case? If D is something that reacts with acid chloride to form E. For example, if D is ammonia (NH3), then RCOCl + 2 NH3 → RCONH2 + NH4Cl. But ammonia is a gas, so that's possible. But then E would be the amide RCONH2.

Alternatively, D could be something else. Wait, but earlier we thought that D is O2 if B is H2, but that may not fit.

Wait, perhaps D is something else. Let me think again.

The product E is extremely hazardous. So what substances are extremely hazardous? Maybe something like sarin gas or another nerve agent, but that's probably too specific. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like chlorine, phosgene, or something else.

But let's get back. Let's suppose that C is an acid chloride, RCOCl. Then, reacting with D (a gas) in a 1:2 ratio forms E. What reactions involve acid chlorides reacting with gases? Maybe with alcohols, but alcohols are typically liquids. Alternatively, maybe with amines, but they are usually liquids or gases at certain conditions.

Wait, another possibility: D could be water. But water is a liquid, not a gas. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps D is H2S gas. Then, RCOCl + H2S → RCOOH + HCl + S or something. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is something like SO2. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, since C is an acid chloride, perhaps D is an alcohol. But alcohols are typically not gases except at low temperatures.

Wait, another angle. When C reacts with D, which is a gas, in a 2:1 ratio, forms E. Let's say C is something that reacts with a gas to form a highly toxic product.

Wait, perhaps C is a chloroalkane, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe C is Cl2O7 (dichlorodifluoride?), but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this from the beginning again.

Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red solid)

Reaction 2: C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)

Reaction 4: B (gas) + D (gas) → H (solvent), in 1:1 ratio.

So let's think about H first. H is a solvent, which is the product of B and D (1:1). So possible solvents from gases reacting: H2O is a solvent, but requires H2 and O2 in a 2:1 ratio. Alternatively, NH3 is a solvent, but it's produced from N2 and H2 in a 1:3 ratio (with catalyst, Haber process). Wait, but the reaction of B and D is 1:1. So if B is H2 and D is O2, they react in 2:1 ratio to form H2O. But that's not 1:1. So perhaps B is something else.

Wait, another possibility: B is Cl2 and D is CH4. They react in a 1:1 ratio, perhaps under certain conditions? But CH4 and Cl2 react in presence of UV light to form CH2Cl, HCl, etc., but that's more of a substitution reaction. Not sure if it forms a solvent.

Alternatively, maybe B is SO3 and D is H2O. But SO3 + H2O → H2SO4, which is a liquid. But the ratio is 1:1? Let's see: SO3 is a gas, H2O is a liquid or gas. 1 mole SO3 + 1 mole H2O → 1 mole H2SO4. So that's a 1:1 ratio. So H would be H2SO4. But H2SO4 is a strong acid, not a solvent in this context. Or wait, in some cases, it's used as a solvent, but perhaps not the primary one.

Alternatively, perhaps B is SO2 and D is O2. They react to form SO3, but that's a gas. But SO3 is not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: B is NH3 and D is something else. But NH3 is a gas. Wait, but the problem says B is a gas, D is a gas.

Wait, perhaps B is H2 and D is F2. Then, H2 + F2 → 2 HF. HF is a gas, but also a solvent in some cases. Hmm, but HF is a weak acid and a solvent, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is C (carbon). Then, O2 + C → CO2 (in combustion, but that's 1:1 ratio?), but CO2 is a gas, not a solvent.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I should consider E's structure because the question is about its molecular symmetry.

E is produced when C reacts with D. So if I can figure out what E is, I can determine its symmetry.

Another approach: think about the reactions and the products.

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

So, when C reacts with water, it produces A, F, and G. Since F is strong and G is weak, perhaps C is an acid anhydride. For example, if C is an acid anhydride like SO3, then reacting with water would produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and another acid. Wait, but SO3 is a gas. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: C is a sulfate anhydride, but then reacting with water would produce the acid and perhaps another compound.

Wait, perhaps C is a chloro compound. For example, if C is Cl2O7 (dichlorodifluoride?), but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe C is something like ClO2. But not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the possible products when C reacts with D.

If C is an acid chloride, like RCOCl, and D is a gas like NH3, then E would be RCONH2 (amide). But what's the symmetry of an amide? For example, CH3CONH2 (acetamide) has a certain symmetry. The molecule has a C2 axis, a plane of symmetry, and other elements.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule with a certain point group, like C2, D4h, etc.

Wait, another possibility: If E is something like phosgene (O=C=O), which is a highly toxic gas. Phosgene has a structure similar to CO2 but with two Cl atoms. Wait, no, phosgene is Cl2C=O, but that's not quite right. Phosgene is O=C(Cl)2. Its structure is linear, with the central carbon double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So the molecule is linear, which would mean it has D∞h symmetry. Because linear molecules have an infinite number of symmetry operations along the axis, making D∞h the point group.

But wait, let me think. Phosgene is O=C(Cl)2. So, it's a linear molecule with a central carbon connected to O double bond and two Cl atoms. The molecule has a center of inversion, a principal axis (C∞), and mirror planes. So yes, its point group is D∞h.

So if E is phosgene, then its point group is D∞h, which is option C.

Alternatively, if E is another molecule, like SO2, which is bent with D∞h symmetry, but SO2 is a gas but not extremely hazardous in the same way. Hmm.

Wait, but let's go back. If C is COCl2 (phosgene?), and D is something that would produce E as COCl2 reacting with something. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let's retrace the steps. If E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), then what would C and D be?

Phosgene can be produced by the reaction of chloroform (CHCl3) with a strong base like NaOH in an elimination reaction, but that's not involving a gas.

Alternatively, phosgene can be prepared by the dehydration of COCl2 with a catalyst. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that fits the reaction.

Wait, perhaps another angle. If C is an acid chloride, like POCl3. Then, reacting with D (maybe H2O?), but D is a gas. Alternatively, D could be NH3, which is a gas. POCl3 + NH3 → PONH2Cl2 + NH4Cl. Not sure.

Alternatively, if C is Cl2O, then reacting with D (maybe something) to form E. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is Cl2O7. But again, not certain.

Wait, let's think about the reaction of C with D to form E. If E is a highly toxic gas with D∞h symmetry, that might point to something like phosgene or another linear molecule.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule like HCN, which is linear, but HCN is a gas, but its point group is D∞h. Wait, no, HCN is linear with a triple bond, so it's D∞h symmetry. But HCN is a gas, yes, and it's extremely hazardous.

So if E is HCN, then what would the reactions be?

Let me try that possibility. If E is HCN, then what is C and D?

HCN is produced from the reaction of a cyanide with an acid. But in this case, C reacts with D (a gas) to form E. So perhaps D is something like H2O, but H2O is a liquid. Hmm, not a gas. Alternatively, maybe D is NH3. HCN can be produced from the reaction of NH3 with a chloro compound, but I’m not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is (CN)2, which is dicyanide. Reacting with a diatomic gas like H2 would not produce HCN, but perhaps that's a stretch.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think differently.

If E is a molecule with D∞h symmetry, what are the possibilities? Phosgene (O=C(Cl)2) has D∞h symmetry. Ozone (O3) is bent and has D∞h symmetry. Ozone is a toxic gas, but not as extremely hazardous as phosgene perhaps. Ozone is a byproduct of certain reactions.

Wait, ozone has a bent structure with a central O atom double-bonded to two others. So, its point group is D∞h.

So if E is O3, then what would C and D be?

Ozone is formed from the reaction of oxygen (O2) with something. In the presence of UV light, O2 can split into O atoms, which can then combine with O2 to form O3. But that's more of a photochemical reaction, and it's an example of a reaction in the atmosphere.

But in the problem, C reacts with D (a gas) in a 2:1 ratio. So, perhaps C is O2, and D is O. Then, 2 O atoms (O) plus O2 → 2 O3? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe C is O3 and D is something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like SO2, which is bent and has D∞h symmetry. Sulfur dioxide is a toxic gas. So if E is SO2, then what would C and D be?

SO2 is produced from the combustion of sulfur or from the reaction of S with O2. But then, how does that fit into the given reactions?

Wait, let me try to see if I can fit E as SO2.

In reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (SO2).

So, if E is SO2, then C plus 2 D must form SO2.

Assuming D is a gas, perhaps D is O2.

Then, C + 2 O2 → SO2. So, what is C?

If C is S (solid), then S + 2 O2 → 2 SO2. But in the first reaction, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of B (gas) to form C (bright red, maybe SO2? No, SO2 is a gas and not bright red. Alternatively, perhaps C is a solid like SO3, but that's a solid? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, if C is S8 (solid sulfur), then reacting with O2 in a certain ratio would produce SO2 or SO3. But the product is bright red, which sulfur isn't. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: C is a sulfide. For example, FeS reacting with something. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the symmetry groups and which ones are common for certain types of molecules.

The options are:

A) C2: This is a twofold rotation axis. Molecules like H2O2 have this symmetry, but H2O2 isn't a gas.

B) D4h: This is a higher symmetry group, with a fourfold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes. Molecules like adamantane have this symmetry, but they are solids. Alternatively, some octahedral molecules might fit, but D4h is more about square symmetry.

C) D∞h: This is the symmetry group for linear molecules with a center of symmetry, like CO2, HCN, O3, etc.

D) C2v: This has a twofold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes. Molecules like H2O (which is V-shaped) have C2v symmetry.

So, considering that E is extremely hazardous and likely a gas, D∞h symmetry suggests a linear molecule. So the options are either C) D∞h or B) D4h (less likely for a gas).

So, E is likely a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. The question is, which of the options is D∞h? Option C is D∞h.

So, putting it all together, the symmetry group is D∞h.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometric ratio suggests a specific reaction, but the exact identity of A and B is not immediately clear. However, the bright red color of C hints at a compound like an acid chloride (e.g., RCOCl), which is consistent with the subsequent reactions.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. E is likely a gas with high toxicity, and its molecular symmetry is the focus of the question.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This suggests that C is likely an acid chloride (RCOCl), as it can hydrolyze to form a carboxylic acid (weak acid) and HCl (strong acid).

4. **Reaction 4**: B and D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This implies that B and D are gases that combine to form a liquid or solid solvent. A plausible candidate is H2O, formed from H2 and O2 in a 2:1 ratio, but the exact identity of B and D remains uncertain.

5. **Symmetry of E**: The question focuses on the molecular symmetry group of E. E is described as extremely hazardous and likely a gas. Linear molecules with D∞h symmetry, such as phosgene (O=C(Cl)2) or ozone (O3), fit this description. Phosgene is a highly toxic gas with the structure O=C(Cl)2, which has a linear geometry and D∞h symmetry. Ozone (O3), another linear molecule, also has D∞h symmetry but is less consistent with the description of E as a product of C and D.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the reactions and the description of E as a highly hazardous gas, E is most likely phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), which has D∞h symmetry. This aligns with the molecular symmetry group of a linear molecule with a principal axis and horizontal mirror planes.

Answer: C

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The problem describes a series of reactions involving substances A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H. The goal is to determine the molecular symmetry group of product E. The options are C2, D4h, D∞h, and C2v.

Hmm, molecular symmetry groups... I remember these are point groups that describe the symmetry of a molecule. Common ones include things like D4h or C2v. So first, I need to figure out what the structure of E is because the symmetry depends on that.

Let's break down the reactions step by step. 

First reaction: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. 8 equivalents suggests a stoichiometric ratio of 1:8. I'm thinking maybe A is an element, perhaps something like sulfur or phosphorus, but I'm not sure. But wait, the product is a bright red solid, which makes me think of something like sulfur dioxide or maybe another compound with a red color. Alternatively, perhaps it's a transition metal complex. Wait, another thought: maybe A is sodium (Na) and B is chlorine (Cl2). 8 equivalents would mean 4 moles of Cl2 for each mole of Na. But sodium is a solid, and Cl2 is a gas. The reaction would be 4 Na + 2 Cl2 → 2 NaCl. Oh wait, that's 4 moles of Na and 2 moles of Cl2, which is a 2:1 ratio. But here, the ratio is 1:8, which is different. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe A is phosphorus (P4) reacting with Cl2. P4 + 6 Cl2 → 4 PCl3, but that's 1:6 ratio. But the given ratio is 1:8. Hmm, not matching. Another possibility: maybe A is aluminum (Al) and B is chlorine. 2 Al + 3 Cl2 → 2 AlCl3. That's 2:3 ratio—still doesn't fit 1:8.

Wait, perhaps A is a metal that combines with B in a higher ratio. Alternatively, perhaps B is not a diatomic gas. Wait, another idea: maybe B is oxygen gas (O2). So, solid A reacts with O2 to form C. Let's say A is Fe (iron). Fe reacts with O2 to form FeO or Fe3O4, but I'm not sure about the ratio here. Fe3O4 would require (3 Fe)/(4 O2), which is a 3:4 ratio. Not matching 1:8.

Wait, maybe A is sulfur (S8) reacting with something? S8 is a solid, and maybe B is something else. Alternatively, perhaps A is carbon (C) and B is something like F2 (fluorine gas). C + 4 F2 → CF4. That's a 1:4 ratio. Not matching 1:8.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is something like Mg reacting with O2 to form MgO. Mg is solid, O2 is gas. The reaction is 2 Mg + O2 → 2 MgO. So, 2:1 ratio. Doesn't match 1:8.

Hmm, maybe another approach. The product C reacts with D to form E, which is extremely hazardous. Also, C reacts with water to reform A plus two different acids F and G. F is a strong acid, G is a weak acid.

So when C reacts with water, it produces A and two acids. If F is a strong acid and G is a weak acid, that suggests that perhaps C is a salt that can undergo hydrolysis. For example, maybe C is an acid chloride. Because acid chlorides when hydrolysed with water produce carboxylic acids (weak) and HCl (strong). Wait, but acid chlorides are typically when the acid is something like RCOCl, which upon hydrolysis gives RCOOH (weak) and HCl (strong). However, in that case, the reaction would be RCOCl + H2O → RCOOH + HCl.

So if C is an acid chloride, then what's A? Because when C reacts with water, it gives back A. If C is RCOCl, then A would be RCOOH (the acid). But wait, that doesn't fit because the reaction would produce RCOOH and HCl. Wait, but the problem says C reacting with water gives A, F, and G. So, perhaps A is RCOOH, F is HCl, and G is something else? Or maybe F is HCl and G is another acid. Wait, but RCOCl + H2O → RCOOH + HCl. So A would be RCOOH, F is HCl (strong acid), G is RCOOH (weak acid). But the question says F and G are two different acids. So if in this case, both are RCOOH and HCl, but if RCOOH is F and HCl is G, but F is strong and G is weak. But HCl is a strong acid and RCOOH is weak. So F would be HCl (strong), G would be RCOOH (weak). That could fit. So in that case, C would be RCOCl, which is an acid chloride.

So, if C is RCOCl, then product E comes from C reacting with D. The reaction is C + 2 D → E. Let's think about what D could be. D is a gas that reacts with B in a 1:1 ratio to form H, which is a solvent. So B and D react to form H, a solvent. Hmm, what solvents are formed from the reaction of gases? Maybe H is H2O, but that's a liquid. Alternatively, maybe H is something like HCl, which is a gas but can be a solvent in some cases. Or maybe H is NH3, but that's a gas as well. Alternatively, H could be something like CO2, but that's not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, the reaction of B and D in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. Let me think, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is H2. Then, H would be HCl. But HCl is a gas, not a solvent. Alternatively, B is O2, D is H2, H is H2O. That makes sense. H2O is a solvent. So O2 + 2 H2 → 2 H2O. But the ratio here is 1:2 for B:D. But the question says 1:1 ratio. So that doesn't fit.

Another possibility: B is Cl2 and D is CH4. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B is CO2 and D is something else. Wait, another angle: D is a gas. So D could be H2 if B is something else.

Wait, perhaps B is Cl2 and D is CH4. Reaction of Cl2 and CH4 in presence of light gives CH2Cl and HCl, but that's more of a substitution reaction. Not sure if that gives a solvent.

Wait, perhaps B is SO3 and D is H2O? But SO3 is a gas, and H2O is a liquid. Reaction would form H2SO4, but that's a liquid. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps B is H2 and D is O2. They react in a 1:1 ratio to form H2O. H2O is a solvent. So B is H2, D is O2. So in that case, H is H2O. That would fit. So B is H2 (gas), D is O2 (gas). They react in 1:1 ratio to form H2O (liquid, but also used as a solvent, though not the primary one). Hmm, but H2O is a solvent in many contexts.

But then, the first reaction is A (solid) + 8 equivalents of B (H2) → C (bright red). So, A + 8 H2 → C.

What solid A would react with H2 to form a bright red product? Maybe a metal that forms a sulfide? Wait, no, H2 is a reducing agent. Maybe A is Fe3O4? Hmm, Fe3O4 plus H2 forms Fe and water. But that's more of a reduction.

Alternatively, perhaps A is a metal oxide. For example, FeO reacting with H2 to form Fe and H2O. But then, the color of FeO is black, not red.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the product C is a transition metal complex. Bright red could be like lead dioxide (PbO2) but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's lead(IV) oxide, which is dark brown. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the product C is a compound of sulfur. Sulfur is bright yellow, but perhaps a different form? Or maybe it's a different reaction.

Wait, another approach: since C reacts with water to form A, F, and G. If C is an acid chloride (RCOCl), then A is RCOOH, F is HCl, and G is RCOOH. But wait, that would mean F and G are the same, which contradicts the problem statement. So perhaps C is a different type of compound.

Wait, maybe C is an anhydride. For instance, if C is a metal carbonate anhydride, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps C is a sulfide. Wait, another idea: C could be a sulfate ester, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, considering the earlier thought about C being an acid chloride, perhaps the reaction is:

C (RCOCl) + 2 D → E.

What would D be in that case? If D is something that reacts with acid chloride to form E. For example, if D is ammonia (NH3), then RCOCl + 2 NH3 → RCONH2 + NH4Cl. But ammonia is a gas, so that's possible. But then E would be the amide RCONH2.

Alternatively, D could be something else. Wait, but earlier we thought that D is O2 if B is H2, but that may not fit.

Wait, perhaps D is something else. Let me think again.

The product E is extremely hazardous. So what substances are extremely hazardous? Maybe something like sarin gas or another nerve agent, but that's probably too specific. Alternatively, perhaps E is a highly toxic gas like chlorine, phosgene, or something else.

But let's get back. Let's suppose that C is an acid chloride, RCOCl. Then, reacting with D (a gas) in a 1:2 ratio forms E. What reactions involve acid chlorides reacting with gases? Maybe with alcohols, but alcohols are typically liquids. Alternatively, maybe with amines, but they are usually liquids or gases at certain conditions.

Wait, another possibility: D could be water. But water is a liquid, not a gas. So that can't be.

Wait, perhaps D is H2S gas. Then, RCOCl + H2S → RCOOH + HCl + S or something. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps D is something like SO2. But again, not sure.

Alternatively, since C is an acid chloride, perhaps D is an alcohol. But alcohols are typically not gases except at low temperatures.

Wait, another angle. When C reacts with D, which is a gas, in a 2:1 ratio, forms E. Let's say C is something that reacts with a gas to form a highly toxic product.

Wait, perhaps C is a chloroalkane, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe C is Cl2O7 (dichlorodifluoride?), but I'm getting confused.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this from the beginning again.

Reaction 1: A (solid) + 8 B (gas) → C (bright red solid)

Reaction 2: C + 2 D (gas) → E (extremely hazardous)

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid)

Reaction 4: B (gas) + D (gas) → H (solvent), in 1:1 ratio.

So let's think about H first. H is a solvent, which is the product of B and D (1:1). So possible solvents from gases reacting: H2O is a solvent, but requires H2 and O2 in a 2:1 ratio. Alternatively, NH3 is a solvent, but it's produced from N2 and H2 in a 1:3 ratio (with catalyst, Haber process). Wait, but the reaction of B and D is 1:1. So if B is H2 and D is O2, they react in 2:1 ratio to form H2O. But that's not 1:1. So perhaps B is something else.

Wait, another possibility: B is Cl2 and D is CH4. They react in a 1:1 ratio, perhaps under certain conditions? But CH4 and Cl2 react in presence of UV light to form CH2Cl, HCl, etc., but that's more of a substitution reaction. Not sure if it forms a solvent.

Alternatively, maybe B is SO3 and D is H2O. But SO3 + H2O → H2SO4, which is a liquid. But the ratio is 1:1? Let's see: SO3 is a gas, H2O is a liquid or gas. 1 mole SO3 + 1 mole H2O → 1 mole H2SO4. So that's a 1:1 ratio. So H would be H2SO4. But H2SO4 is a strong acid, not a solvent in this context. Or wait, in some cases, it's used as a solvent, but perhaps not the primary one.

Alternatively, perhaps B is SO2 and D is O2. They react to form SO3, but that's a gas. But SO3 is not a solvent. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: B is NH3 and D is something else. But NH3 is a gas. Wait, but the problem says B is a gas, D is a gas.

Wait, perhaps B is H2 and D is F2. Then, H2 + F2 → 2 HF. HF is a gas, but also a solvent in some cases. Hmm, but HF is a weak acid and a solvent, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps B is O2 and D is C (carbon). Then, O2 + C → CO2 (in combustion, but that's 1:1 ratio?), but CO2 is a gas, not a solvent.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tricky. Maybe I should consider E's structure because the question is about its molecular symmetry.

E is produced when C reacts with D. So if I can figure out what E is, I can determine its symmetry.

Another approach: think about the reactions and the products.

Reaction 3: C + H2O → A + F (strong acid) + G (weak acid).

So, when C reacts with water, it produces A, F, and G. Since F is strong and G is weak, perhaps C is an acid anhydride. For example, if C is an acid anhydride like SO3, then reacting with water would produce H2SO4 (strong acid) and another acid. Wait, but SO3 is a gas. Hmm.

Wait, another possibility: C is a sulfate anhydride, but then reacting with water would produce the acid and perhaps another compound.

Wait, perhaps C is a chloro compound. For example, if C is Cl2O7 (dichlorodifluoride?), but I'm not certain.

Wait, maybe C is something like ClO2. But not sure.

Alternatively, let's think about the possible products when C reacts with D.

If C is an acid chloride, like RCOCl, and D is a gas like NH3, then E would be RCONH2 (amide). But what's the symmetry of an amide? For example, CH3CONH2 (acetamide) has a certain symmetry. The molecule has a C2 axis, a plane of symmetry, and other elements.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule with a certain point group, like C2, D4h, etc.

Wait, another possibility: If E is something like phosgene (O=C=O), which is a highly toxic gas. Phosgene has a structure similar to CO2 but with two Cl atoms. Wait, no, phosgene is Cl2C=O, but that's not quite right. Phosgene is O=C(Cl)2. Its structure is linear, with the central carbon double-bonded to O and single-bonded to two Cl atoms. So the molecule is linear, which would mean it has D∞h symmetry. Because linear molecules have an infinite number of symmetry operations along the axis, making D∞h the point group.

But wait, let me think. Phosgene is O=C(Cl)2. So, it's a linear molecule with a central carbon connected to O double bond and two Cl atoms. The molecule has a center of inversion, a principal axis (C∞), and mirror planes. So yes, its point group is D∞h.

So if E is phosgene, then its point group is D∞h, which is option C.

Alternatively, if E is another molecule, like SO2, which is bent with D∞h symmetry, but SO2 is a gas but not extremely hazardous in the same way. Hmm.

Wait, but let's go back. If C is COCl2 (phosgene?), and D is something that would produce E as COCl2 reacting with something. But I'm a bit confused.

Wait, let's retrace the steps. If E is phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), then what would C and D be?

Phosgene can be produced by the reaction of chloroform (CHCl3) with a strong base like NaOH in an elimination reaction, but that's not involving a gas.

Alternatively, phosgene can be prepared by the dehydration of COCl2 with a catalyst. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that fits the reaction.

Wait, perhaps another angle. If C is an acid chloride, like POCl3. Then, reacting with D (maybe H2O?), but D is a gas. Alternatively, D could be NH3, which is a gas. POCl3 + NH3 → PONH2Cl2 + NH4Cl. Not sure.

Alternatively, if C is Cl2O, then reacting with D (maybe something) to form E. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe C is Cl2O7. But again, not certain.

Wait, let's think about the reaction of C with D to form E. If E is a highly toxic gas with D∞h symmetry, that might point to something like phosgene or another linear molecule.

Alternatively, if E is a molecule like HCN, which is linear, but HCN is a gas, but its point group is D∞h. Wait, no, HCN is linear with a triple bond, so it's D∞h symmetry. But HCN is a gas, yes, and it's extremely hazardous.

So if E is HCN, then what would the reactions be?

Let me try that possibility. If E is HCN, then what is C and D?

HCN is produced from the reaction of a cyanide with an acid. But in this case, C reacts with D (a gas) to form E. So perhaps D is something like H2O, but H2O is a liquid. Hmm, not a gas. Alternatively, maybe D is NH3. HCN can be produced from the reaction of NH3 with a chloro compound, but I’m not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps C is (CN)2, which is dicyanide. Reacting with a diatomic gas like H2 would not produce HCN, but perhaps that's a stretch.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think differently.

If E is a molecule with D∞h symmetry, what are the possibilities? Phosgene (O=C(Cl)2) has D∞h symmetry. Ozone (O3) is bent and has D∞h symmetry. Ozone is a toxic gas, but not as extremely hazardous as phosgene perhaps. Ozone is a byproduct of certain reactions.

Wait, ozone has a bent structure with a central O atom double-bonded to two others. So, its point group is D∞h.

So if E is O3, then what would C and D be?

Ozone is formed from the reaction of oxygen (O2) with something. In the presence of UV light, O2 can split into O atoms, which can then combine with O2 to form O3. But that's more of a photochemical reaction, and it's an example of a reaction in the atmosphere.

But in the problem, C reacts with D (a gas) in a 2:1 ratio. So, perhaps C is O2, and D is O. Then, 2 O atoms (O) plus O2 → 2 O3? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe C is O3 and D is something else. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps E is a molecule like SO2, which is bent and has D∞h symmetry. Sulfur dioxide is a toxic gas. So if E is SO2, then what would C and D be?

SO2 is produced from the combustion of sulfur or from the reaction of S with O2. But then, how does that fit into the given reactions?

Wait, let me try to see if I can fit E as SO2.

In reaction 2: C + 2 D → E (SO2).

So, if E is SO2, then C plus 2 D must form SO2.

Assuming D is a gas, perhaps D is O2.

Then, C + 2 O2 → SO2. So, what is C?

If C is S (solid), then S + 2 O2 → 2 SO2. But in the first reaction, solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of B (gas) to form C (bright red, maybe SO2? No, SO2 is a gas and not bright red. Alternatively, perhaps C is a solid like SO3, but that's a solid? Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, if C is S8 (solid sulfur), then reacting with O2 in a certain ratio would produce SO2 or SO3. But the product is bright red, which sulfur isn't. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, another possibility: C is a sulfide. For example, FeS reacting with something. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the symmetry groups and which ones are common for certain types of molecules.

The options are:

A) C2: This is a twofold rotation axis. Molecules like H2O2 have this symmetry, but H2O2 isn't a gas.

B) D4h: This is a higher symmetry group, with a fourfold rotation axis and horizontal mirror planes. Molecules like adamantane have this symmetry, but they are solids. Alternatively, some octahedral molecules might fit, but D4h is more about square symmetry.

C) D∞h: This is the symmetry group for linear molecules with a center of symmetry, like CO2, HCN, O3, etc.

D) C2v: This has a twofold rotation axis and two vertical mirror planes. Molecules like H2O (which is V-shaped) have C2v symmetry.

So, considering that E is extremely hazardous and likely a gas, D∞h symmetry suggests a linear molecule. So the options are either C) D∞h or B) D4h (less likely for a gas).

So, E is likely a linear molecule with D∞h symmetry. The question is, which of the options is D∞h? Option C is D∞h.

So, putting it all together, the symmetry group is D∞h.


The problem involves determining the molecular symmetry group of product E based on a series of reactions. Here's the analysis:

1. **Reaction 1**: Solid A reacts with 8 equivalents of gas B to form bright red product C. The stoichiometric ratio suggests a specific reaction, but the exact identity of A and B is not immediately clear. However, the bright red color of C hints at a compound like an acid chloride (e.g., RCOCl), which is consistent with the subsequent reactions.

2. **Reaction 2**: C reacts with 2 equivalents of gas D to produce E, an extremely hazardous product. E is likely a gas with high toxicity, and its molecular symmetry is the focus of the question.

3. **Reaction 3**: C reacts with water to reform A and produce two acids, F (strong) and G (weak). This suggests that C is likely an acid chloride (RCOCl), as it can hydrolyze to form a carboxylic acid (weak acid) and HCl (strong acid).

4. **Reaction 4**: B and D react in a 1:1 ratio to form H, a solvent. This implies that B and D are gases that combine to form a liquid or solid solvent. A plausible candidate is H2O, formed from H2 and O2 in a 2:1 ratio, but the exact identity of B and D remains uncertain.

5. **Symmetry of E**: The question focuses on the molecular symmetry group of E. E is described as extremely hazardous and likely a gas. Linear molecules with D∞h symmetry, such as phosgene (O=C(Cl)2) or ozone (O3), fit this description. Phosgene is a highly toxic gas with the structure O=C(Cl)2, which has a linear geometry and D∞h symmetry. Ozone (O3), another linear molecule, also has D∞h symmetry but is less consistent with the description of E as a product of C and D.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the reactions and the description of E as a highly hazardous gas, E is most likely phosgene (O=C(Cl)2), which has D∞h symmetry. This aligns with the molecular symmetry group of a linear molecule with a principal axis and horizontal mirror planes.

Answer: C
