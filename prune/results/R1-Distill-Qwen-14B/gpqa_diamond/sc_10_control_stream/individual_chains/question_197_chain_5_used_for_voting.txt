Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. 

The question is about a compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of certain functional groups. Oh right, they're used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, another possibility: maybe they're used in the dehydrohalogenation or some kind of elimination? Hmm. Alternatively, I think they're used in the hydrolysis of esters or maybe in the formation of alkenes via dehydrohalogenation. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Or maybe it's for converting alkenes to diols? No, I don't think that's right. Oh wait, another reaction: when you treat a nitrile with HI and red phosphorus, it's a hydrolysis reaction that converts the nitrile into a carboxylic acid. The HI and red phosphorus provide the acidic conditions and H+ ions.

But wait, alternatively, I think that when HI is used with red phosphorus, it's in the presence of an alkyl halide. Oh wait, no, maybe that's in the formation of alkenes through elimination. Or wait, another reaction: when you have a nitrile and treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes hydrolysis to form an amine. Or is it a different reaction?

Wait, maybe I should start by figuring out what compound X is, based on the spectral data provided. Because once I know what X is, I can figure out what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

So, the IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1. That's a broad peak, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But given the presence of a peak at 1720 cm-1, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. But 1720 is more typical for esters or ketones. Wait, carboxylic acids usually have a lower wavenumber, around 1700, but it can vary. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might indicate aromatic ring vibrations, like C=C stretching. So, the compound X might have an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5. That's a strong indication of an -OH proton, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, in a carboxylic acid, the OH is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But if it's an -OH from an alcohol, it could be around there too, but more often, alcohols are lower, but depends on the solvent and exchange. Alternatively, this could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. Wait, but the integration is 1H. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid -OH.

Wait, but in the IR data, the strong peak at 1720 cm-1: if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, maybe even outside the given range, but the IR data includes 3400-2500, which could encompass the O-H stretch for a carboxylic acid (which is usually a broad peak around 2500-3300). So possible.

Next, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): these are typical of an aromatic ring with substituents. The two doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene. For example, in para-substituted benzene rings, the two protons ortho to the substituent are equivalent and split into doublets. So perhaps a para-substituted phenyl group with two substituents.

Wait, but the integration is 2H each. So, the NMR shows a doublet at 8.0 ppm (2H) and another doublet at 7.2 ppm (2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. For a para-disubstituted benzene, such as p-xylene, the protons would be two doublets each integrating to 2H. So, if the substituent is in the para position, the neighboring protons are equivalent.

Wait, but in this case, the substituent could be an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. For example, maybe a benzoic acid or benzene ring with a carbonyl group attached.

Then, the other peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). 

Let me look at these. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) is probably a CH2CH3 group, a methyl group attached to a CH2. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) is probably another CH(CH3) group, maybe part of an isobutyl or sec-butyl group. The multiplets at 2.9 and 1.7 ppm (1H and 2H) could be part of a chain attached to the benzene.

Putting this all together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group and an alkyl chain. The substituent might be a ketone or an ester, but given the IR, let's think about what's more likely.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be a ketone. But if it were a ketone, the NMR wouldn't have a proton at 10.5 ppm. Because a ketone doesn't have an -OH. So that 10.5 ppm is more likely an -OH group, perhaps from a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but then the IR at 1720 could be a carboxylic acid. Wait no, because a carboxylic acid's C=O is around 1700 cm-1, but it can be higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, which has a higher C=O stretch, around 1720-1740.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a phenyl ester, like a benzyl ester.

But wait, the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are typically downfield. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would be broad around 10-12 ppm. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is a phenyl acetate or something like that. Let's see. Phenyl acetate would have a benzene ring, an ester group (OAc), and an OAc would have a carbonyl around 1720 cm-1. The OAc group would also have a methyl group (from the acetate) in the NMR. But in the NMR given, I don't see a peak around 2 ppm for an acetate methyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a propionoate ester or something similar.

Wait, let's try to sketch the structure.

The aromatic region: 8.0 d (2H), 7.2 d (2H). So, the substituent is in the para position, and the two H's adjacent are each a doublet. So, the substituent is probably at the para position, with an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl.

So, the substituent is something like -COOR, where R is an alkyl group.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde. Hmm, but then why isn't the aldehyde showing a triplet or something else? Or wait, maybe the aldehyde is part of a longer chain attached to the ring.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. But the 10.5 ppm is a single proton, which could be an aldehyde. But then, the rest of the NMR doesn't quite fit, because the other peaks are more in the aliphatic region.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a phenyl ketone with an alkyl chain.

Wait, let's think about the aliphatic protons.

Looking at the NMR:

At 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): possibly a CH adjacent to some substituents.

At 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): maybe a CH2 group next to a CH that is connected to something else.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps in a branched chain. For example, a CH(CH3)- group.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a methyl group at the end of a chain, as in CH2CH2CH3.

Putting it all together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's an alkyl group ending in a carbonyl.

Wait, but if the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, that could be a ketone (C=O) or an ester. Let's think.

If it's a ketone, then the structure might be something like diphenyl ketone, but the NMR doesn't support that. Alternatively, a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group and a longer chain.

Wait, looking at the substituents on the benzene, perhaps the substituent is a group like (CH2)2CHCH2COOH. No, that might not fit.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. So, a CH2CH2CH3, where the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, which is adjacent to a CH.

So perhaps the structure is:

Ph-O-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something? No, that seems unclear.

Wait, let's think of the substituent on the benzene as a chain that includes a carbonyl group. For example, a benzene ring with a substituent like -(CH2)3COOH. Or maybe -(CH2)2COOH. Let's see.

But wait, the NMR shows 1H at 10.5 ppm, which could be the -COOH proton. That would fit if the substituent is a carboxylic acid.

So, perhaps the structure is 4-(something)benzoic acid.

Wait, but then the IR would have a peak around 1720 cm-1, which would fit a carboxylic acid (but typically around 1700). Also, the IR shows a peak at 1610 and 1450, which are indicative of aromatic C=C stretching.

So, the structure could be a substituted benzoic acid. The substituent would be an alkyl group attached to the benzene ring's para position.

Looking at the NMR:

The 1H at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet is the -COOH proton. The aromatic protons are two doublets (each 2H), which suggests a para-substituted benzene, with substituent in the 4 position. Then, the aliphatic protons:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to another CH2 group.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group next to that CH.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, which would make that CH a CH(CH3).

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a methyl group at the end of a chain, so CH2CH2CH3.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-COOH, but with a substituent in the para position. Wait, but wait, the substituent is more than just a methyl. Let's think of the chain.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a propyl group with a branching.

Wait, another approach: the substituent on the benzene is a group like (CH2)2CHCH2COOH.

Wait, but that would make the structure longer. Alternatively, perhaps it's a (CH2)2CH2 group attached to the benzene, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene, but with a branching. Let me think about the NMR.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. So, perhaps the structure is a CH(CH3) group, which is part of a larger chain.

So, putting it all together, the substituent on the benzene is a chain that starts with CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-..., but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH group, but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is 4-(3-pentyl)benzoic acid or something like that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, and the rest is a carbonyl group.

Wait, let me think about the options.

Looking at the options provided:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

Hmm, that would be a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group at position 2. But the NMR doesn't seem to fit that, because the aliphatic region would have a different arrangement.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position. Let's think about that structure.

Benzoic acid has a COOH group on the benzene. The substituent in the para position is a sec-butyl group. So, the structure would be:

Ph(COOH) with a substituent in the para position: -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

Wait, no, wait. The substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, the structure would be:

The benzene ring has the COOH group at position 1, and the sec-butyl group at position 4.

So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, wait, the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-, no, wait.

Wait, no: the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me draw it.

A butyl group can be straight chain (n-butyl), iso-butyl, or sec-butyl. The sec-butyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH3)–.

Wait, no. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)–, but wait, that can't be right because that would be a 3-pentyl group or something. Hmm. Let me think again.

Wait, the butyl group can be:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3-

- iso-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)- (but wait, that's actually a tert-butyl in a way, but iso is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, the correct structure is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-. No, wait, the iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify:

n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3-

iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)2-

Wait, no, iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-.

Wait, actually, no: iso-butyl is (CH2CH(CH3)CH2)-, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's better to think in terms of substituent groups.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that's a 3-pentyl group. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a tert-butyl group, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think in terms of the NMR.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, the structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. So, the substituent is attached to the benzene as -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-? Hmm, not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)-.

Wait, but looking at the NMR:

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, which suggests a CH2CH2CH3. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, which would be part of a branching.

So, perhaps the substituent is something like -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, that would be a tert-pentyl group or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-COOH with a substituent in the para position of -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

Wait, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3—no, that's too long.

Wait, let's think again. The substituent is attached to the benzene in the para position. It's a chain that includes a carbonyl group (the IR at 1720) and an -OH group (the 10.5 ppm peak). So, perhaps the substituent is a propionoic acid group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propanoyl group (like -COCH2CH2CH3), but that might not fit the NMR.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR multiplets.

At 2.9 ppm, a multiplet integrating to 1H. That's likely a CH group that's next to other CH2 groups.

At 1.7 ppm, a multiplet integrating to 2H. So, a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 or CH.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, so that would be a CH(CH3) group.

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH3 at the end of a chain, like CH2CH2CH3.

Putting this all together, perhaps the substituent is a chain like CH2CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that would make the substituent longer.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching, like CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group attached to the benzene. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, but with a branch. For example, a sec-butyl group: CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but the substituent is attached to the benzene ring. So, the structure would be:

Ph-(COOH) with a substituent like -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that seems too long.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)2 group.

Another thought: the substituent on the benzene is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)-, but then the chain might not be long enough.

Wait, the NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is a methyl group attached to a CH2. So, the chain is -(CH2)CH(CH3)-, but then how does that connect?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. So, that's a pentyl group with a branch. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CHCH2 group, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, maybe it's better to look at the options and see which structure fits the data.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

So, the structure would be:

Ph(COOH) with a substituent in para position as -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no. Let me think about the sec-butyl group. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no. The correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think. The name is important here.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group. The IUPAC name for a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. Or wait, no. Wait, the structure is: 

The butyl group is four carbons. The substituent is attached to the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, the substituent is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-COOH with a substituent at the para position as -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

But this is getting a bit complicated.

Let me think about the NMR of option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

- The benzoic acid would have an -OH proton in the NMR, which would be broad around 10-12 ppm, matching the 10.5 ppm peak.

- The aromatic protons would be para to the substituent and to the COOH group. So, in the NMR, the aromatic protons would split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That matches the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm peaks.

Now, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no. The correct structure of a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that can't be right. Let me get this straight.

The structure of a sec-butyl group is:

The main chain is four carbons, with the substituent attached to the second carbon.

So, the group is: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, that's a four-carbon chain, with the substituent on the second carbon.

So, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene.

So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

So, the substituent would have the following protons in the NMR:

- The CH2 attached to the benzene: this would be a triplet, perhaps integrating to 2H, but in the options, I don't see a peak at that region.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data:

The aliphatic region has peaks at 2.9 (1H, m), 1.7 (2H, m), 1.4 (3H, d), and 0.9 (3H, t).

So, let's map this substituent.

The substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3?

Wait, no, perhaps it's -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain, with a branch on the second carbon. The substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no. The substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the substituent as:

-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, that would be a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain, which is a butyl group. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

So, the substituent would have the following protons:

- The CH2 adjacent to the benzene: this is a CH2 group attached to the benzene and to a CH(CH3) group. This CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH(CH3) group.

- The CH(CH3) group: it has two CH2 groups attached to it. One is the CH2 from the benzene, and the other is a CH2CH3.

So, the protons on the CH2 adjacent to the benzene would be a quartet (from the adjacent CH(CH3)), integrating to 2H. But the NMR data doesn't show a quartet in that region.

Wait, but in the given NMR, the aliphatic region shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), a doublet at 1.4 (3H), and multiplets at 1.7 and 2.9 ppm.

So, perhaps the substituent's structure leads to these peaks.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is likely the terminal methyl of a propyl chain, such as CH2CH2CH3.

The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, like CH(CH3).

The multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to a CH.

The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) could be a CH group adjacent to another CH2.

So, putting it all together, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, that's a pentyl group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a butyl group with branching.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. No, that would be a tert-butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. But that would be a pentyl group.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to map the NMR to the substituent.

The substituent's protons would be:

1. The CH2 group attached to the benzene: this would be next to a CH(CH3) group, so it would be a quartet (if adjacent to a CH with two protons). But the NMR doesn't show a quartet here; instead, it shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is the terminal CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

So, the structure would be:

Ph-COOH with a substituent in the para position: -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, but that's a pentyl group, which is longer than butyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

So, the substituent's structure would be:

Ph-COOH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that would make the substituent a pentyl group, but that's longer than what's indicated by the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, like -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

But I'm not making progress. Let's think about the options again.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group: the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, no, that's three carbons. No, a butyl group is four carbons. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that would be a pentyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR again.

The substituent's NMR:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): this is a CH3 at the end of a chain, so it's a CH2CH2CH3 group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH, which is part of a branching, so CH(CH3).

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): likely a CH2 group adjacent to a CH.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH group adjacent to other CH2 groups.

So, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the middle carbon.

The structure would be: -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, that's a pentyl group with a branch on the second carbon. No, wait, the substituent is:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, it's a butyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon, making it a sec-butyl group.

Wait, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group (CH2CH(CH3)CH2-), then the attached protons would be as follows:

The CH2 adjacent to the benzene would be a quartet (from the adjacent CH(CH3)), but the NMR doesn't show that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a triplet or a multiplet.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the reaction now. The question is about what happens when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

If X is a nitrile, then with HI and red phosphorus, it would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if X is an ester, perhaps it would undergo some reaction.

But looking back, the IR data shows a carbonyl peak at 1720 cm-1, which is more like an ester or a ketone. The presence of the broad peak in IR (3400-2500) suggests -OH or -NH groups. But looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet, which is likely an -OH.

So, if the compound X is a benzoic acid derivative, perhaps with an ester or a nitrile group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 could be a nitrile (C≡N) stretch, but nitriles usually absorb around 2200-2260 cm-1, which isn't the case here. So, that's not it.

So, back to the NMR.

If the compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then the substituent is a sec-butyl group in the para position.

The NMR of the substituent would have:

- The CH2 group attached to the benzene: this would be a quartet (split by the adjacent CH(CH3)), integrating to 2H.

But in the given NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H. So, perhaps that corresponds to the CH2 group adjacent to the CH(CH3).

The CH(CH3) group would have a singlet for the CH3, but in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which would fit a methyl group attached to a CH.

The 2.9 ppm (1H) would be the CH group itself.

The 0.9 ppm (3H) would be the terminal CH3 of the chain.

So, the substituent is:

Ph-COOH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's a pentyl group, which I'm not sure about. Alternatively, perhaps it's a branching at the second carbon.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. That would be a tert-butyl group, but I don't think that's the case.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider each option and see which fits the spectral data.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The structure would have a benzene ring with a COOH group at one position and a sec-butyl group in the para position.

The substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no. The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, that can't be right because that's a four-carbon chain, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

In any case, the key point is that when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it forms a product. So, what happens in that reaction?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. But wait, if X is a nitrile, then the reaction would produce a carboxylic acid. But looking at the options, option C is a carboxylic acid.

But wait, if X is a nitrile, then after reaction, it becomes a carboxylic acid. So, perhaps X is a nitrile, and after reaction, it becomes the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the question states that X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, so the reaction is hydrolysis.

So, if X is a nitrile, then product would be a carboxylic acid.

But looking at the options, option C is a carboxylic acid. So, if X is a nitrile with a substituent, then after reaction, it becomes a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in the given NMR data, the compound X has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which could be the -OH of a carboxylic acid. So, if X is already a carboxylic acid, then what's the reaction?

Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester.

Wait, another possibility: X is an ester, and when treated with red phosphorus and HI, it hydrolyzes to a carboxylic acid.

But the problem is that the reaction's conditions (red phosphorus and HI) are more commonly associated with nitrile hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, and the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the spectral data for X suggests that it is already a carboxylic acid because of the -OH peak. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The reaction: X reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. For example, when a nitrile is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes hydrolysis to form an amine. The reaction is as follows:

R–C≡N + HI (excess) → R–CH2–NH2 + I–.

Wait, but that's in the presence of red phosphorus. Alternatively, in another condition, HI and red phosphorus can convert nitriles to carboxylic acids via a different mechanism.

Wait, another reaction: nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using H2O and catalysts, but with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a different pathway.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester. Esters can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under acidic or basic conditions. But red phosphorus and HI might not be typical for ester hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, and the reaction converts it into an amine or a carboxylic acid.

But if X is a nitrile, its IR would show a peak around 2200 cm-1, which isn't present here. So, X isn't a nitrile.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. The reaction is X + red phosphorus + HI → product.

Red phosphorus and HI are also used in the dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides to alkenes. Wait, but that's not applicable here.

Another reaction: when alkenes are treated with HI and red phosphorus, they form diols. But that's for the hydroboration-oxidation, but perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alkyne from an alkene via hydration. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an alkyne. But I'm not certain.

Another possibility: the reaction is the dehydrohalogenation of an alkyl halide to form an alkene. But that typically uses a strong base like KOtBu, not HI and red phosphorus.

Wait, maybe it's the elimination of HX from a dihalide. But again, not sure.

Wait, maybe I should consider that red phosphorus and HI are used in the preparation of Markownikoff's addition to alkenes, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a carbonyl group from a nitrile. Wait, but that's more about oxidation.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the conversion of a nitrile to an amine via Staudinger reaction, but that involves triphenylphosphine and an azide, not exactly this scenario.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about each part again.

The problem states that X has the given spectral data. So, based on the NMR and IR, X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent that includes a branching in the chain.

The substituent's NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H), and multiplets at 1.7 and 2.9 ppm.

So, the substituent is a chain that is likely -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, but that's a pentyl group, but the substituent in the options is a butyl group.

Wait, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but that's four carbons, which would be a butyl group. But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure.

Assuming that X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, that doesn't make sense because benzoic acid doesn't react with red phosphorus and HI. Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, and the reaction produces a carboxylic acid.

But the NMR of X doesn't indicate a nitrile. So, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound X is a phenyl ester. For example, something like phenyl acetate. Then, when treated with HI and red phosphorus, it would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

So, if X is phenyl propionate, after hydrolysis, it would form propanoic acid.

But looking at the options, option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So, if X is the corresponding ester, then the product would be that acid.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile attached to a benzene ring. For example, benzene with a nitrile substituent and an ethyl group. Then, the reaction would produce a carboxylic acid.

But the NMR doesn't fit a nitrile.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck again. Let me try to think of the reaction.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. The reaction is:

R–C≡N + H2O (with HI and P) → R–COOH.

So, if X is R–C≡N, then the product is R–COOH.

But the NMR of X doesn't show a nitrile peak (which would be around 2200 cm-1 in IR), so that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps X is a nitrile, but the IR data doesn't show the nitrile peak? Unlikely, because the nitrile peak is strong.

So, maybe the reaction is something else. Another possibility is that X is an alkyne, and the reaction is hydration to form a ketone.

But the IR data would show a peak around 3300 cm-1 for sp-hybridized carbons, which isn't present here.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

So, if X is an ester, RCOOR', then with HI and red phosphorus, it would hydrolyze to RCOOH.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if X is the corresponding ester, RCOOR', then the product would be RCOOH.

But the given NMR data for X includes a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is an -OH. So, if X is an ester, it wouldn't have an -OH. Therefore, X must be the acid.

Wait, that's confusing. So, perhaps X is already the acid, and the reaction does something else.

Wait, another reaction: when a carboxylic acid is treated with HI, perhaps it could undergo some kind of substitution or addition. But I'm not familiar with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the preparation of an acyl chloride from a carboxylic acid using PCl5 or something, but that's not red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, perhaps the reaction involves the elimination of HX from a compound. For example, if X is a chloro compound, but I don't see evidence of that in the spectral data.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl phosphorus compound, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing the key point. Let me summarize:

- X's IR shows a strong carbonyl (1720 cm-1) and a broad peak in 3400-2500 (probably -OH).
- NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm (likely -OH).
- The aromatic protons are para-substituted.
- The aliphatic protons suggest a chain with a methyl branch and a terminal methyl group.

So, X is likely a substituted benzoic acid with a specific alkyl chain substituent.

When X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a reaction. But what reaction?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the preparation of an acylium ion or some kind of substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not directly on the benzoic acid part, but on another functional group.

Wait, perhaps X has an ester group. For example, it's a phenyl ester. Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid.

But then, the NMR would have an ester's OAc peak, which I don't see here. The NMR doesn't show a peak around 2 ppm for an acetate methyl.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile and the reaction produces a carboxylic acid. But as before, the IR doesn't support that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the benzene ring. For example, if X has a leaving group attached, like a nitro group, but that's not indicated by the spectral data.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let's think of the options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

The reaction is X + red phosphorus + HI → product.

If X is a nitrile, then the product would be a carboxylic acid. But looking at the options, option C is a carboxylic acid.

So, perhaps X is a nitrile with the structure of option C, but without the COOH group. For example, X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile.

Then, upon hydrolysis with red phosphorus and HI, it would become 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

But wait, the NMR data given is for X, which would have the nitrile group. The given NMR doesn't show a nitrile peak (which would be around 2200 cm-1), so that's not possible.

So, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction produces a carboxylic acid.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester, then upon hydrolysis, it becomes 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

But looking at the NMR data, X would have an ester group. So, in the NMR, there would be a peak for the ester's OAc group, typically around 2 ppm for the methyl. But in the given data, the aliphatic protons are at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm. I don't see a peak around 2 ppm, so that might not fit.

Hmm, but perhaps the ester is not an acetate. Maybe it's a longer chain ester. For example, the ester would have a CH2 group next to the carbonyl.

But without the OAc peak, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not hydrolysis but something else.

Wait, another reaction: when a nitrile is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it's converted into an amine. For example, RCN + HI → RCH2NH2 + I–.

But then the product would be an amine, which isn't among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an imine or something else, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should look at the options and see which one makes sense as a product of the reaction.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene (cumene).

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

So, if the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, then the product would be option C if X was the corresponding nitrile.

But the NMR of X would include a nitrile peak, which isn't present. So, perhaps this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of HBr from a dihalide to form an alkene. But I don't see how that would apply here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. But how would that apply to a benzoic acid?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that's not likely with red phosphorus and HI.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently.

The IR of X has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. The broad peak in IR (3400-2500) is likely an -OH. So, X is a carboxylic acid.

But if X is a carboxylic acid, what reaction would it undergo with red phosphorus and HI?

I think carboxylic acids don't typically react with red phosphorus and HI. So, perhaps X is not a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

But then X's NMR would include an ester's CH3COO peak, which I don't see here.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, but then its IR would have a peak around 2200 cm-1, which isn't present.

Wait, another thought: the IR has a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are indicative of aromatic C=C stretching. The 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl, likely an ester or ketone.

But if X is a ketone, then the 10.5 ppm peak wouldn't be there. So, perhaps X is a ketone with an -OH group elsewhere. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an amide. The IR would show a peak around 1650 cm-1 for the amide C=O, but the given data has 1720, which is more likely an ester or ketone.

Wait, perhaps X is a phenol ester. For example, phenyl acetate. Then, the reaction would hydrolyze it to benzoic acid. But again, the NMR doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile with an aromatic ring and an ethyl group. But as before, the IR doesn't show the nitrile peak.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, but only under certain conditions. If X is a nitrile, the product would be a carboxylic acid. Looking at the options, option C is a carboxylic acid. So, perhaps the reaction converts X (a nitrile) into option C.

But then X's NMR would have to include a nitrile proton, which is usually around 2 ppm as a triplet. But the given NMR doesn't show that.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X is a propargyl alcohol derivative, but that's not fitting the data.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a chloro compound that undergoes substitution with HI. But I don't see evidence of that in the spectral data.

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, and the reaction is a different one. For example, the formation of an alkyne from an alkyl halide. But I don't see how that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydration of an alkyne to a ketone, but again, the data doesn't support that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to an alkyne to form a dihalide, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a vinyl chloride, and the reaction converts it into something else, but that doesn't fit the spectral data.

I think I'm stuck on the reaction part. Let me try to think about the options again.

If X is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then what reaction would it undergo with red phosphorus and HI?

I don't know any standard reaction where a carboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI to form another compound. Maybe it's a substitution, but I can't think of any.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the preparation of a mixed anhydride, but that's not relevant here.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the reaction doesn't involve X's functional group but perhaps a side chain.

Wait, looking at the NMR of X, the aliphatic region suggests a chain with branching and a terminal methyl group. So, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a butyl group with a branch.

Assuming that, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the substituent undergoes some reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a bromoalkane, and the reaction is elimination to form an alkene.

But the given data doesn't show any peaks indicative of a bromo group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a chloroalkane, but again, no evidence in the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group, and the reaction is hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. But then X would be an ester, and the product would be a carboxylic acid.

But the given NMR for X doesn't support that.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Let me try to conclude.

Given the spectral data, X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent that includes a butyl group with a branch (sec-butyl). So, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). 

The reaction with red phosphorus and HI: I'm not sure what reaction would occur here. But perhaps the substituent is a nitrile group, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to a carboxylic acid. However, that would require X to be a nitrile, which doesn't fit the spectral data.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the main structure but adds something else, but I can't think of what that would be.

Wait, perhaps X is a nitrile with a phenyl group and a substituent. The reaction would convert the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, making the product a substituted benzoic acid. So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

But the NMR given doesn't support X being a nitrile, as it lacks the nitrile peak.

In conclusion, after considering all possibilities, I think the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


--- Final Answer Content ---


The problem involves identifying the final product when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the spectral data provided for X:

### IR Data:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates a broad peak, likely due to an -OH group.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, suggesting the presence of a carboxylic acid or an ester.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, indicating a substituted benzene ring.

### ¹H NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, consistent with an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**, **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**, **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**, and **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Aliphatic protons consistent with a chain containing a methyl group (CH₃), a methylene group (CH₂), and a terminal methyl group (CH₃).

### Structural Interpretation:
The NMR and IR data suggest that X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent containing a branched alkyl chain. The substituent is identified as a **sec-butyl group** based on the aliphatic NMR signals:
- The **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** corresponds to a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a CH.
- The **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)** and **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** correspond to a CH and adjacent CH₂ groups.
- The **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** corresponds to a terminal methyl group (CH₃) at the end of the chain.

Thus, X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. However, since X is already a carboxylic acid (as indicated by the spectral data), it is unlikely to undergo further reaction under these conditions. Therefore, the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Does not match the para-substitution pattern or the aliphatic NMR data.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Does not contain a carboxylic acid group, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Matches the spectral data and is consistent with the reaction conditions.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Does not contain a carboxylic acid group, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**. 

ANSWER: C

--- Full Content ---
Okay, so I've got this organic chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's take it step by step. 

The question is about a compound X reacting with red phosphorus and HI. I remember that red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of certain functional groups. Oh right, they're used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, another possibility: maybe they're used in the dehydrohalogenation or some kind of elimination? Hmm. Alternatively, I think they're used in the hydrolysis of esters or maybe in the formation of alkenes via dehydrohalogenation. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think. Red phosphorus and HI are often used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. Or maybe it's for converting alkenes to diols? No, I don't think that's right. Oh wait, another reaction: when you treat a nitrile with HI and red phosphorus, it's a hydrolysis reaction that converts the nitrile into a carboxylic acid. The HI and red phosphorus provide the acidic conditions and H+ ions.

But wait, alternatively, I think that when HI is used with red phosphorus, it's in the presence of an alkyl halide. Oh wait, no, maybe that's in the formation of alkenes through elimination. Or wait, another reaction: when you have a nitrile and treat it with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes hydrolysis to form an amine. Or is it a different reaction?

Wait, maybe I should start by figuring out what compound X is, based on the spectral data provided. Because once I know what X is, I can figure out what happens when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

So, the IR data: 3400–2500 cm-1. That's a broad peak, which usually indicates O-H or N-H stretching. But given the presence of a peak at 1720 cm-1, that's a strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, which could be an ester, ketone, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid. But 1720 is more typical for esters or ketones. Wait, carboxylic acids usually have a lower wavenumber, around 1700, but it can vary. The 1610 and 1450 cm-1 might indicate aromatic ring vibrations, like C=C stretching. So, the compound X might have an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.

Looking at the NMR data:

1H NMR:
- 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H): A broad singlet around 10.5. That's a strong indication of an -OH proton, maybe from an alcohol or a carboxylic acid. But wait, in a carboxylic acid, the OH is usually a broad peak around 10-12 ppm. But if it's an -OH from an alcohol, it could be around there too, but more often, alcohols are lower, but depends on the solvent and exchange. Alternatively, this could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are usually around 9-10 ppm as a singlet. Wait, but the integration is 1H. So maybe it's a carboxylic acid -OH.

Wait, but in the IR data, the strong peak at 1720 cm-1: if it's a carboxylic acid, the O-H would be very broad, maybe even outside the given range, but the IR data includes 3400-2500, which could encompass the O-H stretch for a carboxylic acid (which is usually a broad peak around 2500-3300). So possible.

Next, 8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H): these are typical of an aromatic ring with substituents. The two doublets suggest a para-substituted benzene. For example, in para-substituted benzene rings, the two protons ortho to the substituent are equivalent and split into doublets. So perhaps a para-substituted phenyl group with two substituents.

Wait, but the integration is 2H each. So, the NMR shows a doublet at 8.0 ppm (2H) and another doublet at 7.2 ppm (2H). That suggests a para-substituted benzene with two substituents in the para positions. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. For a para-disubstituted benzene, such as p-xylene, the protons would be two doublets each integrating to 2H. So, if the substituent is in the para position, the neighboring protons are equivalent.

Wait, but in this case, the substituent could be an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl. For example, maybe a benzoic acid or benzene ring with a carbonyl group attached.

Then, the other peaks: 2.9 ppm (m, 1H), 1.7 ppm (m, 2H), 1.4 ppm (d, 3H), 0.9 ppm (t, 3H). 

Let me look at these. The triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) is probably a CH2CH3 group, a methyl group attached to a CH2. The doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H) is probably another CH(CH3) group, maybe part of an isobutyl or sec-butyl group. The multiplets at 2.9 and 1.7 ppm (1H and 2H) could be part of a chain attached to the benzene.

Putting this all together, perhaps the structure is something like a benzene ring with a substituent that includes a carbonyl group and an alkyl chain. The substituent might be a ketone or an ester, but given the IR, let's think about what's more likely.

Wait, the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which could be a ketone. But if it were a ketone, the NMR wouldn't have a proton at 10.5 ppm. Because a ketone doesn't have an -OH. So that 10.5 ppm is more likely an -OH group, perhaps from a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but then the IR at 1720 could be a carboxylic acid. Wait no, because a carboxylic acid's C=O is around 1700 cm-1, but it can be higher. Alternatively, maybe it's an ester, which has a higher C=O stretch, around 1720-1740.

Alternatively, maybe the compound is a phenyl ester, like a benzyl ester.

But wait, the NMR shows a peak at 10.5 ppm (bs, 1H), which could be an aldehyde proton, but aldehydes are typically downfield. But if it's a carboxylic acid, the -OH would be broad around 10-12 ppm. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: maybe the compound is a phenyl acetate or something like that. Let's see. Phenyl acetate would have a benzene ring, an ester group (OAc), and an OAc would have a carbonyl around 1720 cm-1. The OAc group would also have a methyl group (from the acetate) in the NMR. But in the NMR given, I don't see a peak around 2 ppm for an acetate methyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a propionoate ester or something similar.

Wait, let's try to sketch the structure.

The aromatic region: 8.0 d (2H), 7.2 d (2H). So, the substituent is in the para position, and the two H's adjacent are each a doublet. So, the substituent is probably at the para position, with an electron-withdrawing group, like a carbonyl.

So, the substituent is something like -COOR, where R is an alkyl group.

Wait, but looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm could be an aldehyde. Hmm, but then why isn't the aldehyde showing a triplet or something else? Or wait, maybe the aldehyde is part of a longer chain attached to the ring.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the compound is a benzaldehyde derivative with some substituents. But the 10.5 ppm is a single proton, which could be an aldehyde. But then, the rest of the NMR doesn't quite fit, because the other peaks are more in the aliphatic region.

Alternatively, perhaps the compound is a phenyl ketone with an alkyl chain.

Wait, let's think about the aliphatic protons.

Looking at the NMR:

At 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): possibly a CH adjacent to some substituents.

At 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): maybe a CH2 group next to a CH that is connected to something else.

1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a methyl group attached to a CH, perhaps in a branched chain. For example, a CH(CH3)- group.

0.9 ppm (t, 3H): a methyl group at the end of a chain, as in CH2CH2CH3.

Putting it all together, perhaps the structure is a benzene ring with a substituent that's an alkyl group ending in a carbonyl.

Wait, but if the IR has a peak at 1720 cm-1, that could be a ketone (C=O) or an ester. Let's think.

If it's a ketone, then the structure might be something like diphenyl ketone, but the NMR doesn't support that. Alternatively, a benzene ring attached to a carbonyl group and a longer chain.

Wait, looking at the substituents on the benzene, perhaps the substituent is a group like (CH2)2CHCH2COOH. No, that might not fit.

Wait, another approach: the presence of a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H) suggests a CH2CH2CH3 group. So, a CH2CH2CH3, where the CH2 is adjacent to another CH2, which is adjacent to a CH.

So perhaps the structure is:

Ph-O-CO-CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-something? No, that seems unclear.

Wait, let's think of the substituent on the benzene as a chain that includes a carbonyl group. For example, a benzene ring with a substituent like -(CH2)3COOH. Or maybe -(CH2)2COOH. Let's see.

But wait, the NMR shows 1H at 10.5 ppm, which could be the -COOH proton. That would fit if the substituent is a carboxylic acid.

So, perhaps the structure is 4-(something)benzoic acid.

Wait, but then the IR would have a peak around 1720 cm-1, which would fit a carboxylic acid (but typically around 1700). Also, the IR shows a peak at 1610 and 1450, which are indicative of aromatic C=C stretching.

So, the structure could be a substituted benzoic acid. The substituent would be an alkyl group attached to the benzene ring's para position.

Looking at the NMR:

The 1H at 10.5 ppm as a broad singlet is the -COOH proton. The aromatic protons are two doublets (each 2H), which suggests a para-substituted benzene, with substituent in the 4 position. Then, the aliphatic protons:

The 2.9 ppm (m, 1H) could be a CH adjacent to another CH2 group.

The 1.7 ppm (m, 2H) could be a CH2 group next to that CH.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, which would make that CH a CH(CH3).

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a methyl group at the end of a chain, so CH2CH2CH3.

Putting this together, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-COOH, but with a substituent in the para position. Wait, but wait, the substituent is more than just a methyl. Let's think of the chain.

Alternatively, the substituent could be a propyl group with a branching.

Wait, another approach: the substituent on the benzene is a group like (CH2)2CHCH2COOH.

Wait, but that would make the structure longer. Alternatively, perhaps it's a (CH2)2CH2 group attached to the benzene, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group attached to the benzene, but with a branching. Let me think about the NMR.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) suggests a methyl group attached to a CH. So, perhaps the structure is a CH(CH3) group, which is part of a larger chain.

So, putting it all together, the substituent on the benzene is a chain that starts with CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2-..., but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CH group, but I'm not getting it.

Alternatively, maybe the structure is 4-(3-pentyl)benzoic acid or something like that. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a sec-butyl group attached to the benzene ring, and the rest is a carbonyl group.

Wait, let me think about the options.

Looking at the options provided:

Option A: 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

Hmm, that would be a propanoic acid with a 4-ethylphenyl group at position 2. But the NMR doesn't seem to fit that, because the aliphatic region would have a different arrangement.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group at the para position. Let's think about that structure.

Benzoic acid has a COOH group on the benzene. The substituent in the para position is a sec-butyl group. So, the structure would be:

Ph(COOH) with a substituent in the para position: -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

Wait, no, wait. The substituent is a sec-butyl group. So, the structure would be:

The benzene ring has the COOH group at position 1, and the sec-butyl group at position 4.

So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2? No, wait, the sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-, no, wait.

Wait, no: the structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3). No, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me draw it.

A butyl group can be straight chain (n-butyl), iso-butyl, or sec-butyl. The sec-butyl group is CH2CH2CH(CH3)–.

Wait, no. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)–, but wait, that can't be right because that would be a 3-pentyl group or something. Hmm. Let me think again.

Wait, the butyl group can be:

- n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3-

- iso-butyl: CH2CH(CH2CH3)- (but wait, that's actually a tert-butyl in a way, but iso is -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, the correct structure is CH2CH2CH(CH3)-. No, wait, the iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify:

n-butyl: CH2CH2CH2CH3-

iso-butyl: CH(CH2CH3)2-

Wait, no, iso-butyl is (CH3)2CHCH2-.

Wait, actually, no: iso-butyl is (CH2CH(CH3)CH2)-, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe it's better to think in terms of substituent groups.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which would be -CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Wait, no, that's a 3-pentyl group. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's a tert-butyl group, but that's not the case here.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. Let me think in terms of the NMR.

If the substituent is a sec-butyl group, the structure would be CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. So, the substituent is attached to the benzene as -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-? Hmm, not exactly.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)-.

Wait, but looking at the NMR:

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a terminal methyl group, which suggests a CH2CH2CH3. The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, which would be part of a branching.

So, perhaps the substituent is something like -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, that would be a tert-pentyl group or something else. Alternatively, maybe it's -CH(CH2CH2CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-COOH with a substituent in the para position of -(CH2)CH(CH3)2.

Wait, but that doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3—no, that's too long.

Wait, let's think again. The substituent is attached to the benzene in the para position. It's a chain that includes a carbonyl group (the IR at 1720) and an -OH group (the 10.5 ppm peak). So, perhaps the substituent is a propionoic acid group.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a propanoyl group (like -COCH2CH2CH3), but that might not fit the NMR.

Wait, another approach: looking at the NMR multiplets.

At 2.9 ppm, a multiplet integrating to 1H. That's likely a CH group that's next to other CH2 groups.

At 1.7 ppm, a multiplet integrating to 2H. So, a CH2 group adjacent to another CH2 or CH.

The 1.4 ppm (d, 3H) is a CH3 attached to a CH, so that would be a CH(CH3) group.

The 0.9 ppm (t, 3H) is a CH3 at the end of a chain, like CH2CH2CH3.

Putting this all together, perhaps the substituent is a chain like CH2CH(CH3)-CH2-CH2CH3.

Wait, but that would make the substituent longer.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a branching, like CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, maybe it's a -CH(CH3)CH2CH2- group attached to the benzene. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is a -CH2CH(CH3)CH2- group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a butyl group, but with a branch. For example, a sec-butyl group: CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, but the substituent is attached to the benzene ring. So, the structure would be:

Ph-(COOH) with a substituent like -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that seems too long.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is a -(CH2)CH(CH3)2 group.

Another thought: the substituent on the benzene is a propyl group with a methyl branch. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)-, but then the chain might not be long enough.

Wait, the NMR has a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is a methyl group attached to a CH2. So, the chain is -(CH2)CH(CH3)-, but then how does that connect?

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. So, that's a pentyl group with a branch. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a (CH2)2CHCH2 group, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Wait, maybe it's better to look at the options and see which structure fits the data.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, benzoic acid with a sec-butyl group in the para position.

So, the structure would be:

Ph(COOH) with a substituent in para position as -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no. Let me think about the sec-butyl group. The structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, no. The correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-. Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think. The name is important here.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group. The IUPAC name for a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. Or wait, no. Wait, the structure is: 

The butyl group is four carbons. The substituent is attached to the second carbon. So, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, the substituent is CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the structure is:

Ph-COOH with a substituent at the para position as -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

But this is getting a bit complicated.

Let me think about the NMR of option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

- The benzoic acid would have an -OH proton in the NMR, which would be broad around 10-12 ppm, matching the 10.5 ppm peak.

- The aromatic protons would be para to the substituent and to the COOH group. So, in the NMR, the aromatic protons would split into two doublets, each integrating to 2H. That matches the 8.0 and 7.2 ppm peaks.

Now, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no. The correct structure of a sec-butyl group is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-. No, that can't be right. Let me get this straight.

The structure of a sec-butyl group is:

The main chain is four carbons, with the substituent attached to the second carbon.

So, the group is: CH2-CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, that's a four-carbon chain, with the substituent on the second carbon.

So, the structure is CH2CH(CH2CH3)- attached to the benzene.

So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

So, the substituent would have the following protons in the NMR:

- The CH2 attached to the benzene: this would be a triplet, perhaps integrating to 2H, but in the options, I don't see a peak at that region.

Wait, but looking at the NMR data:

The aliphatic region has peaks at 2.9 (1H, m), 1.7 (2H, m), 1.4 (3H, d), and 0.9 (3H, t).

So, let's map this substituent.

The substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3?

Wait, no, perhaps it's -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, perhaps it's better to imagine the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain, with a branch on the second carbon. The substituent would be -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no. The substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH2CH3)-.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the substituent as:

-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, that would be a propyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but that's a four-carbon chain, which is a butyl group. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group.

So, the substituent would have the following protons:

- The CH2 adjacent to the benzene: this is a CH2 group attached to the benzene and to a CH(CH3) group. This CH2 would be split by the adjacent CH(CH3) group.

- The CH(CH3) group: it has two CH2 groups attached to it. One is the CH2 from the benzene, and the other is a CH2CH3.

So, the protons on the CH2 adjacent to the benzene would be a quartet (from the adjacent CH(CH3)), integrating to 2H. But the NMR data doesn't show a quartet in that region.

Wait, but in the given NMR, the aliphatic region shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), a doublet at 1.4 (3H), and multiplets at 1.7 and 2.9 ppm.

So, perhaps the substituent's structure leads to these peaks.

The 0.9 ppm triplet (3H) is likely the terminal methyl of a propyl chain, such as CH2CH2CH3.

The 1.4 ppm doublet (3H) is a methyl group attached to a CH, like CH(CH3).

The multiplet at 1.7 ppm (2H) could be a CH2 group adjacent to a CH.

The 2.9 ppm multiplet (1H) could be a CH group adjacent to another CH2.

So, putting it all together, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, that's a pentyl group, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a butyl group with branching.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. No, that would be a tert-butyl group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. But that would be a pentyl group.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to map the NMR to the substituent.

The substituent's protons would be:

1. The CH2 group attached to the benzene: this would be next to a CH(CH3) group, so it would be a quartet (if adjacent to a CH with two protons). But the NMR doesn't show a quartet here; instead, it shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm, which is the terminal CH3.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

So, the structure would be:

Ph-COOH with a substituent in the para position: -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, but that's a pentyl group, which is longer than butyl. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

So, the substituent's structure would be:

Ph-COOH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, that would make the substituent a pentyl group, but that's longer than what's indicated by the NMR.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch, like -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

But I'm not making progress. Let's think about the options again.

Option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, the correct structure of a sec-butyl group is CH2CH(CH2CH3)-. Hmm, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe it's CH2CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, perhaps I should draw it.

The substituent is a sec-butyl group: the structure is CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-.

Wait, no, that's three carbons. No, a butyl group is four carbons. So, the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3? No, that would be a pentyl group.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the NMR again.

The substituent's NMR:

- 0.9 ppm (t, 3H): this is a CH3 at the end of a chain, so it's a CH2CH2CH3 group.

- 1.4 ppm (d, 3H): a CH3 attached to a CH, which is part of a branching, so CH(CH3).

- 1.7 ppm (m, 2H): likely a CH2 group adjacent to a CH.

- 2.9 ppm (m, 1H): a CH group adjacent to other CH2 groups.

So, perhaps the substituent is a propyl group with a methyl branch on the middle carbon.

The structure would be: -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3.

Wait, that's a pentyl group with a branch on the second carbon. No, wait, the substituent is:

CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

So, it's a butyl group with a methyl branch on the second carbon, making it a sec-butyl group.

Wait, if the substituent is a sec-butyl group (CH2CH(CH3)CH2-), then the attached protons would be as follows:

The CH2 adjacent to the benzene would be a quartet (from the adjacent CH(CH3)), but the NMR doesn't show that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a triplet or a multiplet.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the reaction now. The question is about what happens when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

If X is a nitrile, then with HI and red phosphorus, it would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid. Alternatively, if X is an ester, perhaps it would undergo some reaction.

But looking back, the IR data shows a carbonyl peak at 1720 cm-1, which is more like an ester or a ketone. The presence of the broad peak in IR (3400-2500) suggests -OH or -NH groups. But looking at the NMR, the 10.5 ppm peak is a singlet, which is likely an -OH.

So, if the compound X is a benzoic acid derivative, perhaps with an ester or a nitrile group, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: the IR peak at 1720 cm-1 could be a nitrile (C≡N) stretch, but nitriles usually absorb around 2200-2260 cm-1, which isn't the case here. So, that's not it.

So, back to the NMR.

If the compound is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C), then the substituent is a sec-butyl group in the para position.

The NMR of the substituent would have:

- The CH2 group attached to the benzene: this would be a quartet (split by the adjacent CH(CH3)), integrating to 2H.

But in the given NMR, the 1.7 ppm is a multiplet of 2H. So, perhaps that corresponds to the CH2 group adjacent to the CH(CH3).

The CH(CH3) group would have a singlet for the CH3, but in the NMR, the 1.4 ppm is a doublet (3H), which would fit a methyl group attached to a CH.

The 2.9 ppm (1H) would be the CH group itself.

The 0.9 ppm (3H) would be the terminal CH3 of the chain.

So, the substituent is:

Ph-COOH-CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2-CH3.

Wait, but that's a pentyl group, which I'm not sure about. Alternatively, perhaps it's a branching at the second carbon.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)2. That would be a tert-butyl group, but I don't think that's the case.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider each option and see which fits the spectral data.

Option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

The structure would have a benzene ring with a COOH group at one position and a sec-butyl group in the para position.

The substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no. The substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, no, that can't be right because that's a four-carbon chain, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe the substituent is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

In any case, the key point is that when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it forms a product. So, what happens in that reaction?

Wait, red phosphorus and HI are typically used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. But wait, if X is a nitrile, then the reaction would produce a carboxylic acid. But looking at the options, option C is a carboxylic acid.

But wait, if X is a nitrile, then after reaction, it becomes a carboxylic acid. So, perhaps X is a nitrile, and after reaction, it becomes the carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the question states that X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, so the reaction is hydrolysis.

So, if X is a nitrile, then product would be a carboxylic acid.

But looking at the options, option C is a carboxylic acid. So, if X is a nitrile with a substituent, then after reaction, it becomes a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but in the given NMR data, the compound X has a peak at 10.5 ppm, which could be the -OH of a carboxylic acid. So, if X is already a carboxylic acid, then what's the reaction?

Hmm, that's confusing. Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester.

Wait, another possibility: X is an ester, and when treated with red phosphorus and HI, it hydrolyzes to a carboxylic acid.

But the problem is that the reaction's conditions (red phosphorus and HI) are more commonly associated with nitrile hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, and the reaction converts it into a carboxylic acid.

Wait, but the spectral data for X suggests that it is already a carboxylic acid because of the -OH peak. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again.

The reaction: X reacts with red phosphorus and HI.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to produce amines. For example, when a nitrile is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it undergoes hydrolysis to form an amine. The reaction is as follows:

R–C≡N + HI (excess) → R–CH2–NH2 + I–.

Wait, but that's in the presence of red phosphorus. Alternatively, in another condition, HI and red phosphorus can convert nitriles to carboxylic acids via a different mechanism.

Wait, another reaction: nitriles can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids using H2O and catalysts, but with HI and red phosphorus, perhaps it's a different pathway.

Wait, maybe the reaction is the hydrolysis of an ester. Esters can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids under acidic or basic conditions. But red phosphorus and HI might not be typical for ester hydrolysis.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, and the reaction converts it into an amine or a carboxylic acid.

But if X is a nitrile, its IR would show a peak around 2200 cm-1, which isn't present here. So, X isn't a nitrile.

Hmm, perhaps another approach. The reaction is X + red phosphorus + HI → product.

Red phosphorus and HI are also used in the dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides to alkenes. Wait, but that's not applicable here.

Another reaction: when alkenes are treated with HI and red phosphorus, they form diols. But that's for the hydroboration-oxidation, but perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alkyne from an alkene via hydration. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the hydrolysis of an alkyne. But I'm not certain.

Another possibility: the reaction is the dehydrohalogenation of an alkyl halide to form an alkene. But that typically uses a strong base like KOtBu, not HI and red phosphorus.

Wait, maybe it's the elimination of HX from a dihalide. But again, not sure.

Wait, maybe I should consider that red phosphorus and HI are used in the preparation of Markownikoff's addition to alkenes, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a carbonyl group from a nitrile. Wait, but that's more about oxidation.

Wait, another possibility: the reaction is the conversion of a nitrile to an amine via Staudinger reaction, but that involves triphenylphosphine and an azide, not exactly this scenario.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to think about each part again.

The problem states that X has the given spectral data. So, based on the NMR and IR, X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent that includes a branching in the chain.

The substituent's NMR shows a triplet at 0.9 ppm (3H), a doublet at 1.4 ppm (3H), and multiplets at 1.7 and 2.9 ppm.

So, the substituent is a chain that is likely -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2CH3. Wait, but that's a pentyl group, but the substituent in the options is a butyl group.

Wait, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, the substituent is a sec-butyl group, which is -(CH2)CH(CH3)CH2-.

Wait, but that's four carbons, which would be a butyl group. But I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact structure.

Assuming that X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, what would happen when it reacts with red phosphorus and HI?

Wait, that doesn't make sense because benzoic acid doesn't react with red phosphorus and HI. Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, and the reaction produces a carboxylic acid.

But the NMR of X doesn't indicate a nitrile. So, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the initial compound X is a phenyl ester. For example, something like phenyl acetate. Then, when treated with HI and red phosphorus, it would hydrolyze to a carboxylic acid.

So, if X is phenyl propionate, after hydrolysis, it would form propanoic acid.

But looking at the options, option A is 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid. So, if X is the corresponding ester, then the product would be that acid.

But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile attached to a benzene ring. For example, benzene with a nitrile substituent and an ethyl group. Then, the reaction would produce a carboxylic acid.

But the NMR doesn't fit a nitrile.

Hmm, perhaps I'm stuck again. Let me try to think of the reaction.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles. The reaction is:

R–C≡N + H2O (with HI and P) → R–COOH.

So, if X is R–C≡N, then the product is R–COOH.

But the NMR of X doesn't show a nitrile peak (which would be around 2200 cm-1 in IR), so that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps X is a nitrile, but the IR data doesn't show the nitrile peak? Unlikely, because the nitrile peak is strong.

So, maybe the reaction is something else. Another possibility is that X is an alkyne, and the reaction is hydration to form a ketone.

But the IR data would show a peak around 3300 cm-1 for sp-hybridized carbons, which isn't present here.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

So, if X is an ester, RCOOR', then with HI and red phosphorus, it would hydrolyze to RCOOH.

Looking at the options, option C is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid. So, if X is the corresponding ester, RCOOR', then the product would be RCOOH.

But the given NMR data for X includes a peak at 10.5 ppm, which is an -OH. So, if X is an ester, it wouldn't have an -OH. Therefore, X must be the acid.

Wait, that's confusing. So, perhaps X is already the acid, and the reaction does something else.

Wait, another reaction: when a carboxylic acid is treated with HI, perhaps it could undergo some kind of substitution or addition. But I'm not familiar with that.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the preparation of an acyl chloride from a carboxylic acid using PCl5 or something, but that's not red phosphorus and HI.

Wait, perhaps the reaction involves the elimination of HX from a compound. For example, if X is a chloro compound, but I don't see evidence of that in the spectral data.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an acyl phosphorus compound, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing the key point. Let me summarize:

- X's IR shows a strong carbonyl (1720 cm-1) and a broad peak in 3400-2500 (probably -OH).
- NMR shows a singlet at 10.5 ppm (likely -OH).
- The aromatic protons are para-substituted.
- The aliphatic protons suggest a chain with a methyl branch and a terminal methyl group.

So, X is likely a substituted benzoic acid with a specific alkyl chain substituent.

When X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, it undergoes a reaction. But what reaction?

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the reaction is the preparation of an acylium ion or some kind of substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not directly on the benzoic acid part, but on another functional group.

Wait, perhaps X has an ester group. For example, it's a phenyl ester. Then, the reaction with HI and red phosphorus would hydrolyze it to a carboxylic acid.

But then, the NMR would have an ester's OAc peak, which I don't see here. The NMR doesn't show a peak around 2 ppm for an acetate methyl.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile and the reaction produces a carboxylic acid. But as before, the IR doesn't support that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is a substitution on the benzene ring. For example, if X has a leaving group attached, like a nitro group, but that's not indicated by the spectral data.

Hmm, I'm not making progress. Let's think of the options again.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene

The reaction is X + red phosphorus + HI → product.

If X is a nitrile, then the product would be a carboxylic acid. But looking at the options, option C is a carboxylic acid.

So, perhaps X is a nitrile with the structure of option C, but without the COOH group. For example, X would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile.

Then, upon hydrolysis with red phosphorus and HI, it would become 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, which is option C.

But wait, the NMR data given is for X, which would have the nitrile group. The given NMR doesn't show a nitrile peak (which would be around 2200 cm-1), so that's not possible.

So, that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction produces a carboxylic acid.

If X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoate ester, then upon hydrolysis, it becomes 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

But looking at the NMR data, X would have an ester group. So, in the NMR, there would be a peak for the ester's OAc group, typically around 2 ppm for the methyl. But in the given data, the aliphatic protons are at 2.9, 1.7, 1.4, and 0.9 ppm. I don't see a peak around 2 ppm, so that might not fit.

Hmm, but perhaps the ester is not an acetate. Maybe it's a longer chain ester. For example, the ester would have a CH2 group next to the carbonyl.

But without the OAc peak, it's hard to say.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is not hydrolysis but something else.

Wait, another reaction: when a nitrile is treated with HI and red phosphorus, it's converted into an amine. For example, RCN + HI → RCH2NH2 + I–.

But then the product would be an amine, which isn't among the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an imine or something else, but I'm not sure.

Hmm, perhaps I should look at the options and see which one makes sense as a product of the reaction.

The options are:

A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid.

B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene (cumene).

C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.

D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene.

So, if the reaction is the hydrolysis of a nitrile to a carboxylic acid, then the product would be option C if X was the corresponding nitrile.

But the NMR of X would include a nitrile peak, which isn't present. So, perhaps this isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the elimination of HBr from a dihalide to form an alkene. But I don't see how that would apply here.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the formation of an alkene via dehydrohalogenation. But how would that apply to a benzoic acid?

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the formation of a Grignard reagent, but that's not likely with red phosphorus and HI.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently.

The IR of X has a peak at 1720 cm-1, which is a strong carbonyl. The broad peak in IR (3400-2500) is likely an -OH. So, X is a carboxylic acid.

But if X is a carboxylic acid, what reaction would it undergo with red phosphorus and HI?

I think carboxylic acids don't typically react with red phosphorus and HI. So, perhaps X is not a carboxylic acid.

Wait, perhaps X is an ester, and the reaction is hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid.

But then X's NMR would include an ester's CH3COO peak, which I don't see here.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile, but then its IR would have a peak around 2200 cm-1, which isn't present.

Wait, another thought: the IR has a peak at 1610 and 1450 cm-1, which are indicative of aromatic C=C stretching. The 1720 cm-1 is a carbonyl, likely an ester or ketone.

But if X is a ketone, then the 10.5 ppm peak wouldn't be there. So, perhaps X is a ketone with an -OH group elsewhere. But that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps X is an amide. The IR would show a peak around 1650 cm-1 for the amide C=O, but the given data has 1720, which is more likely an ester or ketone.

Wait, perhaps X is a phenol ester. For example, phenyl acetate. Then, the reaction would hydrolyze it to benzoic acid. But again, the NMR doesn't fit.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a nitrile with an aromatic ring and an ethyl group. But as before, the IR doesn't show the nitrile peak.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the reaction again.

Red phosphorus and HI are used in the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids, but only under certain conditions. If X is a nitrile, the product would be a carboxylic acid. Looking at the options, option C is a carboxylic acid. So, perhaps the reaction converts X (a nitrile) into option C.

But then X's NMR would have to include a nitrile proton, which is usually around 2 ppm as a triplet. But the given NMR doesn't show that.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps X is a propargyl alcohol derivative, but that's not fitting the data.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a chloro compound that undergoes substitution with HI. But I don't see evidence of that in the spectral data.

Hmm, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect, and the reaction is a different one. For example, the formation of an alkyne from an alkyl halide. But I don't see how that applies here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the hydration of an alkyne to a ketone, but again, the data doesn't support that.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is the addition of HI to an alkyne to form a dihalide, but that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a vinyl chloride, and the reaction converts it into something else, but that doesn't fit the spectral data.

I think I'm stuck on the reaction part. Let me try to think about the options again.

If X is option C, 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid, then what reaction would it undergo with red phosphorus and HI?

I don't know any standard reaction where a carboxylic acid reacts with red phosphorus and HI to form another compound. Maybe it's a substitution, but I can't think of any.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is the preparation of a mixed anhydride, but that's not relevant here.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the reaction doesn't involve X's functional group but perhaps a side chain.

Wait, looking at the NMR of X, the aliphatic region suggests a chain with branching and a terminal methyl group. So, perhaps the substituent on the benzene is a butyl group with a branch.

Assuming that, when X reacts with red phosphorus and HI, perhaps the substituent undergoes some reaction.

Wait, another possibility: the substituent is a bromoalkane, and the reaction is elimination to form an alkene.

But the given data doesn't show any peaks indicative of a bromo group.

Alternatively, perhaps the substituent is a chloroalkane, but again, no evidence in the NMR.

Wait, perhaps the substituent is an ester group, and the reaction is hydrolysis to a carboxylic acid. But then X would be an ester, and the product would be a carboxylic acid.

But the given NMR for X doesn't support that.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Let me try to conclude.

Given the spectral data, X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent that includes a butyl group with a branch (sec-butyl). So, X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C). 

The reaction with red phosphorus and HI: I'm not sure what reaction would occur here. But perhaps the substituent is a nitrile group, and the reaction hydrolyzes it to a carboxylic acid. However, that would require X to be a nitrile, which doesn't fit the spectral data.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction doesn't change the main structure but adds something else, but I can't think of what that would be.

Wait, perhaps X is a nitrile with a phenyl group and a substituent. The reaction would convert the nitrile to a carboxylic acid, making the product a substituted benzoic acid. So, if X is 4-(sec-butyl)benzonitrile, the product would be 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid (option C).

But the NMR given doesn't support X being a nitrile, as it lacks the nitrile peak.

In conclusion, after considering all possibilities, I think the correct answer is option C: 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid.


The problem involves identifying the final product when compound X reacts with red phosphorus and HI. The analysis begins by interpreting the spectral data provided for X:

### IR Data:
- **3400–2500 cm⁻¹**: Indicates a broad peak, likely due to an -OH group.
- **1720 cm⁻¹**: Strong carbonyl (C=O) stretch, suggesting the presence of a carboxylic acid or an ester.
- **1610 cm⁻¹ and 1450 cm⁻¹**: Aromatic C=C stretching, indicating a substituted benzene ring.

### ¹H NMR Data:
- **10.5 ppm (bs, 1H)**: A broad singlet, consistent with an -OH proton from a carboxylic acid.
- **8.0 ppm (d, 2H) and 7.2 ppm (d, 2H)**: Two doublets integrating to 2H each, characteristic of a para-substituted benzene ring.
- **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)**, **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)**, **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)**, and **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)**: Aliphatic protons consistent with a chain containing a methyl group (CH₃), a methylene group (CH₂), and a terminal methyl group (CH₃).

### Structural Interpretation:
The NMR and IR data suggest that X is a para-substituted benzoic acid with a substituent containing a branched alkyl chain. The substituent is identified as a **sec-butyl group** based on the aliphatic NMR signals:
- The **1.4 ppm (d, 3H)** corresponds to a methyl group (CH₃) attached to a CH.
- The **2.9 ppm (m, 1H)** and **1.7 ppm (m, 2H)** correspond to a CH and adjacent CH₂ groups.
- The **0.9 ppm (t, 3H)** corresponds to a terminal methyl group (CH₃) at the end of the chain.

Thus, X is identified as **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Reaction with Red Phosphorus and HI:
Red phosphorus and HI are typically used for the hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids. However, since X is already a carboxylic acid (as indicated by the spectral data), it is unlikely to undergo further reaction under these conditions. Therefore, the product remains **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A) 2-(4-ethylphenyl)propanoic acid**: Does not match the para-substitution pattern or the aliphatic NMR data.
- **B) 1-isobutyl-4-methylbenzene**: Does not contain a carboxylic acid group, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.
- **C) 4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**: Matches the spectral data and is consistent with the reaction conditions.
- **D) 1-(sec-butyl)-4-methylbenzene**: Does not contain a carboxylic acid group, inconsistent with the IR and NMR data.

### Conclusion:
The final product is **4-(sec-butyl)benzoic acid**.
