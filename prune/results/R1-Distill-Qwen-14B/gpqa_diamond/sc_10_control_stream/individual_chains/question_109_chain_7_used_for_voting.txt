Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles emitted, and I need to figure out which partial wave is not permitted. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. I need to find which partial wave isn't allowed, considering angular momentum and parity conservation.

Wait, let me understand the given condition. The equation T = S + L +1 mod 2. Since the final T is 0, that means 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. Which simplifies to S + L = 1 mod 2. So S and L must have opposite parity. Either S is even and L is odd, or vice versa.

Now, the initial state is 1S0. The notation is (2S+1)L J. So for 1S0, S is 0 because 2S+1=1 implies S=0. The orbital angular momentum L is denoted by S0, so L is 0? Wait, no, wait, 1S0: the 'S' stands for L=0 because S is the orbital part? Wait, no, the spectroscopic notation is (2S+1)L J. So 1S0 means S=0 (since 2*0+1=1), L is 0 (because it's S), and J=0.

So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

When they emit a particle X, the final state is NN, and X. Let's think about angular momentum and parity conservation.

The initial state is NN (bound in 1S0) plus emitting X. Wait, no, the initial state is NN which is in 1S0, and they emit X, so the final state would be NN (now in some state) plus X. So the total angular momentum and parity of the initial and final must be the same.

Wait, but wait, the initial state is just the two nucleons in 1S0; but when they emit a particle, the system becomes the two nucleons in a new state plus the emitted X. So the total angular momentum should be the same before and after.

But maybe I should think in terms of the decay process:

NN (1S0) → NN (new state) + X.

In this case, the total angular momentum J_initial is 0, because the initial state is 1S0 (J=0). So the final state's total angular momentum must also be 0.

Wait, but the problem is about the partial wave emitted. The options are about the angular momentum state of the emitted X. So each option gives the emitted X as, for example, 7D1, which would be a state with L=2 (since D is L=2), and spin... Not sure yet.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the process as the NN system emitting a particle X in a certain partial wave.

Wait, the system is emitting a particle, so the NN system will go from 1S0 to a new state with certain quantum numbers, and X is emitted with its own quantum numbers.

But perhaps another approach is to consider the parity.

The initial state parity is the parity of 1S0. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^{L+1} for a two-body system. Wait, wait, no: for a two-body system (like two nucleons), the parity is (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of the relative motion. So for 1S0, L=0, so parity is (-1)^0=1.

When the system emits a particle, the parity of the final state (NN plus X) should equal the initial parity (since parity is conserved in strong interactions, although maybe not in weak, but the problem probably assumes parity is conserved). So the parity of the final state must be the same as the initial, which is 1.

The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of the emitted particle X. Because parity is multiplicative. So:

Parity_final = Parity_NN * Parity_X.

Parity_initial = 1.

So:

Parity_NN * Parity_X = 1.

We know that the parity of X is given as -1. So:

Parity_NN * (-1) = 1 → Parity_NN = -1.

So the NN state after emission must have parity -1.

The parity of the NN state is given by (-1)^{L'}, where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state. So:

(-1)^{L'} = -1 → L' must be odd.

So L' is odd.

Now, from the condition given earlier: T(NN) = 0, which equals S + L +1 mod 2. Wait, the equation is T = S + L +1 mod 2.

Wait, wait, the equation given in the problem is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 (mod 2). So 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2.

Which implies that S and L have opposite parities. So if L is odd, S must be even. Because L is odd → L' = odd. So S must be even.

Wait, the spin S of the NN system. S can be 0 or 1 for two nucleons, since each nucleon is a spin-1/2 particle. So possible S for NN is 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). So S can be 0 or 1.

So if S must be even, then S=0, because 0 is even. So S=0.

Thus, the final NN state has S=0 and L' is odd.

Now, what about the angular momentum? The initial state has J=0 (since it's 1S0). The final state must have J=0 as well because angular momentum is conserved.

The final angular momentum J' is the vector sum of the angular momentum of the NN state (which is J_NN = sqrt( (L' + S)^2 - ... )? Wait, no, the total angular momentum J' of the NN system would be L' combined with S.

Wait, the final NN state has orbital angular momentum L' and spin S. So the total J' for NN is the vector sum of L' and S. But since we know L' and S, they can combine in different ways.

Wait, but the total angular momentum J' of the NN system must be such that when combined with the angular momentum of the emitted particle X, the total J is 0.

Wait, maybe I should model this as:

The initial state has J_initial = 0.

The final state consists of the NN system and the X particle. So the total angular momentum J_final is the sum of J_NN and J_X.

But since J_initial = 0, J_final must also be 0. So the vector sum of J_NN and J_X must be zero. Therefore, J_NN and J_X must be equal and opposite, so their magnitudes must be the same, and their spins aligned in opposite directions.

But for this to happen, the magnitudes J_NN and J_X must be the same, and their spins must be such that they can combine to zero. So that implies that J_NN = J_X.

But since J is a vector, the only way J_NN + J_X = 0 is if J_NN = J_X and their directions are opposite. But this is possible only if J_NN = J_X and their spins are such that they can cancel each other. So their magnitudes must be the same.

So J_NN must equal J_X.

But let me think about this in terms of quantum numbers. The total J must be 0, so the possible combinations of J_NN and J_X are such that their vector sum is zero. So J_NN and J_X must have the same magnitude and opposite directions, but in quantum mechanics, the possible values are determined by the possible quantum numbers.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the orbital angular momentum of X, which is given in each option as the lowercase letter. For example, option A is 7D1, which I think refers to the angular momentum l=2 (since D is l=2). But wait, wait, the emission of a particle is via a partial wave, which is described by the orbital angular momentum l of the emitted particle. So the emitted particle's state would have an angular momentum l, and its spin would combine with that.

Wait, but the problem gives the emitted X's state as, for example, 7D1. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused about how the notation works. Let me think: in the options, the emitted X is given with a term symbol like 7D1. Term symbols are (2s+1) L J. So for example, 7D1 would be s=3 (since 2s+1=7 → s=3?), L=D which is l=2, and J=1. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because for a boson, s is integer, but for a fermion, s is half-integer. Wait, but X is a particle emitted by two nucleons, which are fermions. So X could be a meson, which is a boson.

Wait, but the problem states that the emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The intrinsic parity is the parity of the particle itself. For example, pions (which are pseudoscalar mesons) have intrinsic parity -1. So X is likely a pseudoscalar meson, which would have spin 0 and parity -1. But wait, the term symbols in the options have letters like D1, P0, etc. So maybe the emitted particle has orbital angular momentum l, and its spin s, and the term symbol is (2s+1) L J, where J is the total angular momentum (vector sum of l and s).

Wait, but if X is a pseudoscalar meson, then it would have spin 0, so s=0. So l would determine J. But in the options, the emitted X has states like D1, which would imply that l=2 (D) and J=1. How does that happen if s=0? Because if s=0, then J must equal l. So for D1, l=2 and J=1 would not be possible if s=0. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe X is a vector meson, like a rho meson, which has spin 1 and J^PC = 1^--. So in that case, s=1 and l=1 (P wave), so J could be 0, 1, or 2. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is a photon, but that's not a particle emitted in strong interactions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the spin of X is s, and the orbital angular momentum is l, so the total angular momentum J is l + s, etc. But this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by considering each option and applying the conditions step by step.

Let me list the options:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p
B) 1S0 → 3S1 + p
C) 1S0 → 3D3 + f
D) 1S0 → 3P0 + s

Wait, the letters after (like p, f, s) likely denote the type of particle emitted. Like p is a proton, f could be a photon, s maybe sigma? Or perhaps they denote the orbital angular momentum. Wait, no, the notation is that the emitted particle's state is given as in the term symbol, followed by the particle. Like in option A, the X is in 7D1 state and is a proton (p). But wait, protons are spin-1/2 particles, so their term symbols would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the lowercase letters indicate the orbital angular momentum of X. For example, p could mean l=1 (P), f is l=3 (F), s is l=0 (S). Wait, but in option A, the emitted state is 7D1, so D is l=2, so the orbital angular momentum of X is l=2. Then what is the particle p in that context? Maybe it's not relevant for the angular momentum part, just the type of particle.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each option's X's orbital angular momentum (denoted by the letter). For example:

Option A: X is in 7D1. D is l=2.
Option B: X is in 3S1. S is l=0.
Option C: X is in 3D3. D is l=2.
Option D: X is in 3P0. P is l=1.

So the emitted X has orbital angular momentum l equal to 2, 0, 2, 1 for options A, B, C, D respectively.

Now, when the NN system emits X, the orbital angular momentum of X is l. This would contribute to the angular momentum of the system.

The initial state has angular momentum J_initial = 0. The final state has the NN system with angular momentum J_NN and X with orbital angular momentum l. So the total angular momentum must sum to zero.

But wait, that's not entirely correct. The total angular momentum is the sum of the NN system's angular momentum (which includes their orbital and spin parts) and the X's angular momentum. But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the orbital angular momentum of X is L_X, and that the orbital angular momentum of the NN system in the final state is L', and their spins and other parts.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is the same as the orbital angular momentum transferred from the NN system. So the orbital angular momentum L' of the NN system plus the orbital angular momentum l of X must sum to zero, but that's not possible because orbital angular momentum is a vector and can't just cancel out unless they are in opposite directions, but I think that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe the orbital angular momentum of the X is the same as the orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission. Because when the NN system emits X, the process would involve the NN system having orbital angular momentum L', and X having orbital angular momentum l, such that L' + l = L_initial. But the initial orbital angular momentum is L_initial=0 (since the initial state is 1S0, L=0). So L' + l must be zero? That can't be right because L' and l are non-negative integers. Wait, maybe I should think about it as the orbital angular momentum being emitted, so the total orbital angular momentum after emission is L' (of NN) plus l (of X).

Wait, but for the initial state, the orbital angular momentum is zero. So the total after emission must also be zero. So L' + l = 0. But since L' and l are non-negative integers, this implies L'=0 and l=0. But that can't be right because in some options, l is non-zero.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The initial state has orbital angular momentum L_initial =0. The final state consists of the NN system (with orbital angular momentum L') and the X particle (with orbital angular momentum l). The total orbital angular momentum must be zero. So L' + l =0? No, that's not correct because angular momentum is a vector. The sum of vectors can be zero even if they have non-zero magnitudes and opposite directions. But in terms of quantum numbers, the possible values are determined by the addition of angular momentum. So the possible total orbital angular momentum L_total = |L' - l| up to L' + l, in integer steps. But the initial state has L_total=0, so the final state must also have L_total=0.

Wait, but in reality, the orbital angular momentum of X must be in the same direction as that of the NN system, but that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, perhaps this is getting too complicated, and I should instead focus on the isospin, spin, and parity conditions.

Wait, I think I'm confusing orbital angular momentum with total angular momentum. Let me try a different approach.

Each option gives the emitted X's state. Let's consider each option one by one and check whether it satisfies the conditions.

First, the final NN state must have T=0, S=0 (since T = S + L +1 mod 2 → 0 = 0 + L' +1 mod 2 → L' must be 1 mod 2 (odd), as we determined earlier.

So for each option, let's find the orbital angular momentum l of X, and then determine what that implies about the NN's orbital angular momentum L'.

Wait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X, l, is the same as the orbital angular momentum of the NN system in the final state, L'. Because when the NN system emits X, the orbital angular momentum is transferred. So L' = l.

Wait, but that may not be correct. Because when the system emits a particle, the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle could be related to the orbital angular momentum of the parent system.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is L' emitted, so that the NN system's orbital angular momentum after emission is L' = L_initial - l. But since L_initial is 0, L' = -l. But angular momentum is a vector, so the magnitude is |L'| = l. So L' = l. Because L' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system, which must be a non-negative integer, and l is also a non-negative integer, so L' = l.

Wait, that makes sense: L' = l, because the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, and the emitted X has orbital angular momentum l, so the NN system must have L' = l. Because the initial state has L=0, so after emission, the NN's orbital angular momentum plus X's must equal zero? No, wait, the total orbital angular momentum must be zero, so L' (NN) + l (X) = 0. But that would require L' = -l, which is not possible because L' and l are non-negative. So perhaps the correct approach is that the orbital angular momentum carried away by X is l, so the NN system's orbital angular momentum L' must be l. Because the initial state has L=0, so if the NN system after emission has L' = l, and X has l, then the sum would be 2l, which can't be zero unless l=0. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the process as the NN system emitting a particle in a certain orbital angular momentum state, which would change the NN's orbital angular momentum.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to consider the orbital angular momentum L' of the NN system after emission as being the same as the orbital angular momentum l of the emitted X. Because when the two nucleons emit a particle, their orbital angular momentum is reduced by that of the emitted particle. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is l, and the NN system's orbital angular momentum becomes L' = L_initial - l. But since L_initial is 0, this would require L' = -l, which is impossible, so the only possibility is l=0 and L'=0. But that's only option B and D (l=0 and l=1?), wait no, option B has l=0 (S state), option D has l=1 (P state).

Wait, this seems confusing. Let me approach it from another angle.

The initial state has J_initial = 0. The final state must have total J_final =0. The final state is the NN system with J_NN and the emitted X with J_X. So J_NN + J_X = 0. So J_NN must equal J_X in magnitude and opposite in direction. But since J is a quantum number, the only possibility is that J_NN = J_X.

But J_NN is determined by the NN system's L' and S. Since we've established that S=0 (because T=0 and L' is odd), the total J_NN would be L' (since S=0, so J = L' because spin is zero). So J_NN = L'.

Similarly, J_X is determined by the X's orbital angular momentum l and its spin s. So J_X can be l ± s, etc. But for the sake of this problem, perhaps we can assume that the X is a spin-0 particle, which would make J_X = l.

Wait, but if X is spin-0, then J_X = l. So in that case, J_NN = l.

But earlier, we found that L' = l. And J_NN = L' because S=0.

So J_NN = L' = l.

And J_X = l, because X has spin 0 and orbital angular momentum l.

Thus, to have J_NN + J_X = 0, we must have J_NN = J_X. But since they are vectors, their directions must be opposite. So their magnitudes must be equal, but their directions opposite. But for quantum numbers, the only possible way is if J_NN = J_X, which would require that their magnitudes are the same. So l must be equal to L'.

But wait, we have J_NN = L' and J_X = l. So to have their vector sum zero, we need J_NN = J_X in magnitude and opposite in direction. But in quantum mechanics, the only way this can happen is if J_NN = J_X. Because if their magnitudes are the same and opposite, their sum would be zero. But in terms of quantum numbers, their magnitudes must be the same. So J_NN must equal J_X, which are l for both.

Wait, but if J_NN = l and J_X = l, then their sum can only be zero if l=0. Because for l=0, both J are zero, and their sum is zero. For l>0, their sum can't be zero because each J would have a direction, and it's impossible for two non-zero vectors to cancel each other unless they have specific orientations, but that's not guaranteed. So the only possibility is l=0, which implies J_X=0 and J_NN=0.

Wait, but that would mean in the final state, the NN system has L'=0 and S=0, so J_NN=0. And X has l=0 and spin 0, so J_X=0. Thus, their sum is zero, which satisfies J_initial=0.

But this would imply that the only allowed orbital angular momentum for X is l=0, i.e., S wave emission. But looking at the options, option B and D have l=0 and l=1 respectively.

Wait, but earlier I thought that L' must be odd because the parity of the final NN state is -1 (so (-1)^L' = -1 → L' is odd). So L' must be 1,3,5, etc.

So if L' is odd, and L'=l (assuming that), then l must be odd. So X must be emitted in an odd orbital angular momentum state, like P (l=1), F (l=3), D (l=2? No, wait D is l=2 which is even. So only l=1,3,5 etc. are allowed. So in the options, which X's l are odd?

Looking at the options:

A) 7D1 → D is l=2 (even)
B) 3S1 → S is l=0 (even)
C) 3D3 → D is l=2 (even)
D) 3P0 → P is l=1 (odd)

So only option D has l=1, which is odd. So according to this, only option D would allow L'=1, which is odd. But wait, earlier I thought that X's l must be even? No, no, because L' must be odd (from T = S + L +1 mod 2 → 0=0 + L' +1 mod 2 → L' is 1 mod 2), so L' is odd. So l must be equal to L', which is odd, so l must be odd.

So in the options, only option D has l=1 (odd). So the other options (A, B, C) have even l. Thus, those would not be allowed because L' must be odd.

Wait, but earlier I thought that J_NN must equal J_X. If J_NN is L' (since S=0), and J_X is l (since X is spin 0), then J_NN must equal J_X. So L' must equal l. And since L' is odd (1,3,5,...), l must be odd.

So options A, B, C have even l, which would make L' even, which would violate the condition that L' is odd. So those options are not allowed, and only option D is allowed.

But wait, the question is asking which partial wave is NOT permitted. If only option D is allowed, then the others (A, B, C) are not allowed. But looking back at the options, the question says which is not permitted. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me double-check.

The final NN state must have L' = l emitted by X. But earlier, I thought that L' must be odd. So if X is emitted with l even, then L' is even, which would make the final parity positive, which is wrong because the final parity must be -1.

Wait, let's think about parity again. The initial parity is 1. The final parity is (parity of NN) * (parity of X) = 1. The parity of X is given as -1. So parity of NN must be -1. NN's parity is (-1)^L', so L' must be odd.

Thus, X must have l = L' = odd. So l must be odd.

So only options with l odd are permitted. The options are:

A) l=2 → not allowed
B) l=0 → not allowed
C) l=2 → not allowed
D) l=1 → allowed.

So options A, B, C are not allowed, but wait, the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer would be the one that doesn't have l odd.

Wait, but the options are given, and the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So perhaps the correct answer is any option that doesn't meet l being odd.

Looking at the options, options A, B, C have even l. So the partial waves that are not permitted are options A, B, and C. But wait, the question gives four options, and only one is the correct answer.

Wait, but the question is asking which is not permitted, so perhaps the correct answer is option B or D, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the process is NN (1S0) → NN' + X.

The angular momentum conservation:

Initial J is 0 → Final J is 0.

So the vector sum of the NN' and X's angular momenta must be zero.

Assuming X is spin-0 (which it would be if it's a pseudoscalar meson), then J_X = l.

NN' must have J_NN' = L' (since S=0).

So J_NN' + J_X =0 → L' + l =0.

But since L' and l are magnitudes, the only possibility is L' = l =0.

But earlier, we found that L' must be odd (from T=0 condition), so L' can't be zero. Thus, this would imply that X can't be spin-0. So perhaps X has spin 1, making J_X = l + s, where s is spin.

Wait, if X has spin 1, then J_X could be |l-1|, l, or l+1. So for a given l, J_X can be l-1, l, or l+1.

But this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the angular momentum of X is l, and the spin of X is s. Then the total J_X is determined by l and s. But without knowing s, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a vector meson (spin-1), so s=1. Then J_X can be l-1, l, l+1.

But this is getting too involved. Maybe I should go back to the parity condition.

The parity of the final NN state is (-1)^L' = -1 → L' is odd.

Thus, L' must be 1,3,5, etc.

In the options, the emitted X's l is:

A) l=2 → L' would be 2, which is even → not allowed.
B) l=0 → L'=0 → even → not allowed.
C) l=2 → L'=2 → even → not allowed.
D) l=1 → L'=1 → odd → allowed.

So options A, B, C have L'=2, 0, 2, which are even. Only option D has L'=1, which is allowed.

Thus, the partial waves not permitted are options A, B, C. But the question says which is not permitted, so the answer would be any of those. But wait, the options are given, and the question is which is not permitted.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that L' = l. Maybe the orbital angular momentum of X is not equal to L' of the NN system. Let me think again.

When the NN system emits X, the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN system becomes L'. The initial state has L=0, so the total orbital angular momentum after emission is L' + l. But since the initial state has L=0, the total after must also be zero in terms of parity. Wait, no, parity is determined by (-1)^L', which is why L' must be odd.

But for angular momentum, the total after must be zero. So L' + l must equal zero? No, that's not possible because L' and l are magnitudes.

Wait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum is a vector, and the vector sum would be zero. So the emitted X has orbital angular momentum l in a direction opposite to the NN's L' so that L' - l =0. Thus, L' = l.

But then, as before, L' must be l, and L' must be odd. So l must be odd.

Thus, the only permitted option is D, which has l=1. So the other options (A, B, C) are not permitted.

But the question is which one is not permitted, so perhaps the answer is option B.

Wait, no, the question gives four options and we have to choose which is not permitted. So the answer would be any option where l is even.

Looking at the options, only option D has l=1 (odd), so the other options (A, B, C) have even l and thus are not allowed.

But the question is to choose which partial wave is not permitted. So the correct answer would be any of A, B, C, but according to the options, the only allowed is D.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 7D1 → l=2 (even)
B) 3S1 → l=0 (even)
C) 3D3 → l=2 (even)
D) 3P0 → l=1 (odd)

Thus, the one not permitted would be any of A, B, C. But the question asks which is not permitted, so perhaps the correct answer is option B, because in option B, the emitted X is in 3S1. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, perhaps I should also check the spin and isospin conditions.

We know that the final NN state has T=0 and S=0.

The spin of the NN system is S=0, so their combined spin is zero.

The isospin T=0. The possible isospin values for two nucleons (each with isospin 1/2) can be T=0 or T=1.

In the initial state, the two nucleons are in a 1S0 state, which is a singlet state (S=0), and I think the isospin is also zero because the combination is T=0. So the initial state has T=0.

When they emit a particle X, the isospin must be conserved. So the final state (NN' + X) must have the same isospin as the initial. But the initial is T=0, so the final must also have T=0.

But I'm not sure how that affects the partial wave.

Alternatively, perhaps the isospin condition is already satisfied by the given T=0, so it doesn't affect the angular momentum consideration.

Thus, the main condition is that l must be odd, so only option D is allowed. So the others (A, B, C) are not allowed. Therefore, the answer would be any of A, B, C. But the options are given, and the question asks which is not permitted. So the correct answer is, for example, option B.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recap.

The problem's main conditions:

1. The final NN state has T=0, which implies S=0 (from T = S + L +1 mod 2; since T=0 and S=0, L must be 1 mod 2 → odd).

2. The parity of the NN state after emission is (-1)^L' = -1 → L' is odd.

3. Angular momentum must be conserved, so the total J after must be zero.

Assuming X has spin zero (so J_X = l), and the NN system's J_NN = L' (since S=0).

Thus, L' must equal l, and L' must be odd. So l must be odd.

Only option D has l=1 (odd), so the others are not allowed. Therefore, the answer is option B.

Wait, no. Option B has l=0. So it's not allowed. So the answer is option B.

Wait, but the question states that the emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So for each option, we must also ensure that the parity condition is met.

The parity of the final state is (Parity_NN) * (Parity_X) = (-1)^L' * (-1) = (-1)^(L' +1).

Since the initial parity is 1, the final must be 1, so:

(-1)^(L' +1) = 1 → (-1)^(L' +1) = 1 → L' +1 must be even → L' must be odd, which is consistent with our earlier conclusion.

So, as long as L' is odd, the parity condition is satisfied.

Thus, the only allowed option is D, so the others are not permitted. So the answer is one of A, B, C. The options are given, and the question asks which is not permitted.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is option B) 1S0 → 3S1 + p. Because in this option, the emitted X has l=0 (S wave), which is even, making L'=0, which is even, violating the condition that L' must be odd.

Wait, no, wait. If option B has X emitted in l=0, then L' would be 0, which is even, but we need L' to be odd. So option B is not allowed.

So the answer is option B.

To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the conditions provided in the problem:

1. **Initial State and Conservation Laws**:  
   The initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in the 1S0 state. This state has total spin \( S = 0 \), orbital angular momentum \( L = 0 \), and total angular momentum \( J = 0 \). The intrinsic parity of the initial state is \( (-1)^L = 1 \). When the NN system emits a particle \( X \) with intrinsic parity \( -1 \), the total parity of the system must be conserved. Thus, the parity of the final state is given by:  
   \[
   \text{Parity}_{\text{final}} = \text{Parity}_{\text{NN}} \cdot \text{Parity}_X
   \]  
   Substituting \(\text{Parity}_X = -1\) and \(\text{Parity}_{\text{final}} = 1\), we find:  
   \[
   \text{Parity}_{\text{NN}} = -1
   \]  
   The parity of the final NN state is \((-1)^{L'}\), where \( L' \) is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state. Thus:  
   \[
   (-1)^{L'} = -1 \implies L' \text{ is odd}.
   \]

2. **Isospin and Angular Momentum Conservation**:  
   The problem states that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy:  
   \[
   T(\text{NN}) = S(\text{NN}) + L(\text{NN}) + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]  
   Given \( T(\text{NN}) = 0 \), this simplifies to:  
   \[
   S(\text{NN}) + L(\text{NN}) = 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]  
   Since \( S(\text{NN}) = 0 \) (from the singlet state), \( L(\text{NN}) \) must be odd to satisfy the condition.

3. **Analysis of Each Option**:  
   The emitted particle \( X \) has an orbital angular momentum \( l \), which corresponds to the angular momentum state of \( X \). The final NN state inherits an orbital angular momentum \( L' = l \) (from angular momentum conservation). Since \( L' \) must be odd, \( l \) must also be odd.  

   - **Option A: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)**  
     Here, \( X \) is emitted in the \( D1 \) state, which corresponds to \( l = 2 \) (even). This violates the condition that \( l \) must be odd.  
     **Not permitted.**

   - **Option B: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)**  
     Here, \( X \) is emitted in the \( S1 \) state, which corresponds to \( l = 0 \) (even). This also violates the condition that \( l \) must be odd.  
     **Not permitted.**

   - **Option C: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)**  
     Here, \( X \) is emitted in the \( D3 \) state, which corresponds to \( l = 2 \) (even). This violates the condition that \( l \) must be odd.  
     **Not permitted.**

   - **Option D: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)**  
     Here, \( X \) is emitted in the \( P0 \) state, which corresponds to \( l = 1 \) (odd). This satisfies the condition that \( l \) must be odd.  
     **Permitted.**

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The partial waves that are not permitted are those where \( l \) is even. Among the options, only Option D satisfies the condition, while Options A, B, and C do not. Since the question asks for the partial wave that is **not permitted**, the correct answer is **Option B**.

Answer: B

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about nucleons and particles emitted, and I need to figure out which partial wave is not permitted. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

The question says we have a bound system of two nucleons in a 1S0 state. They emit a particle X with intrinsic parity -1. Pauli statistics require that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) + 1 mod 2. So the final NN state has T(NN) = 0. I need to find which partial wave isn't allowed, considering angular momentum and parity conservation.

Wait, let me understand the given condition. The equation T = S + L +1 mod 2. Since the final T is 0, that means 0 = S + L +1 mod 2. Which simplifies to S + L = 1 mod 2. So S and L must have opposite parity. Either S is even and L is odd, or vice versa.

Now, the initial state is 1S0. The notation is (2S+1)L J. So for 1S0, S is 0 because 2S+1=1 implies S=0. The orbital angular momentum L is denoted by S0, so L is 0? Wait, no, wait, 1S0: the 'S' stands for L=0 because S is the orbital part? Wait, no, the spectroscopic notation is (2S+1)L J. So 1S0 means S=0 (since 2*0+1=1), L is 0 (because it's S), and J=0.

So the initial state has S=0, L=0, J=0.

When they emit a particle X, the final state is NN, and X. Let's think about angular momentum and parity conservation.

The initial state is NN (bound in 1S0) plus emitting X. Wait, no, the initial state is NN which is in 1S0, and they emit X, so the final state would be NN (now in some state) plus X. So the total angular momentum and parity of the initial and final must be the same.

Wait, but wait, the initial state is just the two nucleons in 1S0; but when they emit a particle, the system becomes the two nucleons in a new state plus the emitted X. So the total angular momentum should be the same before and after.

But maybe I should think in terms of the decay process:

NN (1S0) → NN (new state) + X.

In this case, the total angular momentum J_initial is 0, because the initial state is 1S0 (J=0). So the final state's total angular momentum must also be 0.

Wait, but the problem is about the partial wave emitted. The options are about the angular momentum state of the emitted X. So each option gives the emitted X as, for example, 7D1, which would be a state with L=2 (since D is L=2), and spin... Not sure yet.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the process as the NN system emitting a particle X in a certain partial wave.

Wait, the system is emitting a particle, so the NN system will go from 1S0 to a new state with certain quantum numbers, and X is emitted with its own quantum numbers.

But perhaps another approach is to consider the parity.

The initial state parity is the parity of 1S0. The parity of a state is given by (-1)^{L+1} for a two-body system. Wait, wait, no: for a two-body system (like two nucleons), the parity is (-1)^L, where L is the orbital angular momentum of the relative motion. So for 1S0, L=0, so parity is (-1)^0=1.

When the system emits a particle, the parity of the final state (NN plus X) should equal the initial parity (since parity is conserved in strong interactions, although maybe not in weak, but the problem probably assumes parity is conserved). So the parity of the final state must be the same as the initial, which is 1.

The parity of the final state is the product of the parity of the NN state and the parity of the emitted particle X. Because parity is multiplicative. So:

Parity_final = Parity_NN * Parity_X.

Parity_initial = 1.

So:

Parity_NN * Parity_X = 1.

We know that the parity of X is given as -1. So:

Parity_NN * (-1) = 1 → Parity_NN = -1.

So the NN state after emission must have parity -1.

The parity of the NN state is given by (-1)^{L'}, where L' is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state. So:

(-1)^{L'} = -1 → L' must be odd.

So L' is odd.

Now, from the condition given earlier: T(NN) = 0, which equals S + L +1 mod 2. Wait, the equation is T = S + L +1 mod 2.

Wait, wait, the equation given in the problem is T(NN) = S(NN) + L(NN) +1 (mod 2). So 0 = S + L +1 mod 2 → S + L = 1 mod 2.

Which implies that S and L have opposite parities. So if L is odd, S must be even. Because L is odd → L' = odd. So S must be even.

Wait, the spin S of the NN system. S can be 0 or 1 for two nucleons, since each nucleon is a spin-1/2 particle. So possible S for NN is 0 (singlet) or 1 (triplet). So S can be 0 or 1.

So if S must be even, then S=0, because 0 is even. So S=0.

Thus, the final NN state has S=0 and L' is odd.

Now, what about the angular momentum? The initial state has J=0 (since it's 1S0). The final state must have J=0 as well because angular momentum is conserved.

The final angular momentum J' is the vector sum of the angular momentum of the NN state (which is J_NN = sqrt( (L' + S)^2 - ... )? Wait, no, the total angular momentum J' of the NN system would be L' combined with S.

Wait, the final NN state has orbital angular momentum L' and spin S. So the total J' for NN is the vector sum of L' and S. But since we know L' and S, they can combine in different ways.

Wait, but the total angular momentum J' of the NN system must be such that when combined with the angular momentum of the emitted particle X, the total J is 0.

Wait, maybe I should model this as:

The initial state has J_initial = 0.

The final state consists of the NN system and the X particle. So the total angular momentum J_final is the sum of J_NN and J_X.

But since J_initial = 0, J_final must also be 0. So the vector sum of J_NN and J_X must be zero. Therefore, J_NN and J_X must be equal and opposite, so their magnitudes must be the same, and their spins aligned in opposite directions.

But for this to happen, the magnitudes J_NN and J_X must be the same, and their spins must be such that they can combine to zero. So that implies that J_NN = J_X.

But since J is a vector, the only way J_NN + J_X = 0 is if J_NN = J_X and their directions are opposite. But this is possible only if J_NN = J_X and their spins are such that they can cancel each other. So their magnitudes must be the same.

So J_NN must equal J_X.

But let me think about this in terms of quantum numbers. The total J must be 0, so the possible combinations of J_NN and J_X are such that their vector sum is zero. So J_NN and J_X must have the same magnitude and opposite directions, but in quantum mechanics, the possible values are determined by the possible quantum numbers.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think about the orbital angular momentum of X, which is given in each option as the lowercase letter. For example, option A is 7D1, which I think refers to the angular momentum l=2 (since D is l=2). But wait, wait, the emission of a particle is via a partial wave, which is described by the orbital angular momentum l of the emitted particle. So the emitted particle's state would have an angular momentum l, and its spin would combine with that.

Wait, but the problem gives the emitted X's state as, for example, 7D1. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused about how the notation works. Let me think: in the options, the emitted X is given with a term symbol like 7D1. Term symbols are (2s+1) L J. So for example, 7D1 would be s=3 (since 2s+1=7 → s=3?), L=D which is l=2, and J=1. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because for a boson, s is integer, but for a fermion, s is half-integer. Wait, but X is a particle emitted by two nucleons, which are fermions. So X could be a meson, which is a boson.

Wait, but the problem states that the emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. The intrinsic parity is the parity of the particle itself. For example, pions (which are pseudoscalar mesons) have intrinsic parity -1. So X is likely a pseudoscalar meson, which would have spin 0 and parity -1. But wait, the term symbols in the options have letters like D1, P0, etc. So maybe the emitted particle has orbital angular momentum l, and its spin s, and the term symbol is (2s+1) L J, where J is the total angular momentum (vector sum of l and s).

Wait, but if X is a pseudoscalar meson, then it would have spin 0, so s=0. So l would determine J. But in the options, the emitted X has states like D1, which would imply that l=2 (D) and J=1. How does that happen if s=0? Because if s=0, then J must equal l. So for D1, l=2 and J=1 would not be possible if s=0. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, maybe X is a vector meson, like a rho meson, which has spin 1 and J^PC = 1^--. So in that case, s=1 and l=1 (P wave), so J could be 0, 1, or 2. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps X is a photon, but that's not a particle emitted in strong interactions. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the spin of X is s, and the orbital angular momentum is l, so the total angular momentum J is l + s, etc. But this is getting a bit complicated.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by considering each option and applying the conditions step by step.

Let me list the options:

A) 1S0 → 7D1 + p
B) 1S0 → 3S1 + p
C) 1S0 → 3D3 + f
D) 1S0 → 3P0 + s

Wait, the letters after (like p, f, s) likely denote the type of particle emitted. Like p is a proton, f could be a photon, s maybe sigma? Or perhaps they denote the orbital angular momentum. Wait, no, the notation is that the emitted particle's state is given as in the term symbol, followed by the particle. Like in option A, the X is in 7D1 state and is a proton (p). But wait, protons are spin-1/2 particles, so their term symbols would be different.

Alternatively, perhaps the lowercase letters indicate the orbital angular momentum of X. For example, p could mean l=1 (P), f is l=3 (F), s is l=0 (S). Wait, but in option A, the emitted state is 7D1, so D is l=2, so the orbital angular momentum of X is l=2. Then what is the particle p in that context? Maybe it's not relevant for the angular momentum part, just the type of particle.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about each option's X's orbital angular momentum (denoted by the letter). For example:

Option A: X is in 7D1. D is l=2.
Option B: X is in 3S1. S is l=0.
Option C: X is in 3D3. D is l=2.
Option D: X is in 3P0. P is l=1.

So the emitted X has orbital angular momentum l equal to 2, 0, 2, 1 for options A, B, C, D respectively.

Now, when the NN system emits X, the orbital angular momentum of X is l. This would contribute to the angular momentum of the system.

The initial state has angular momentum J_initial = 0. The final state has the NN system with angular momentum J_NN and X with orbital angular momentum l. So the total angular momentum must sum to zero.

But wait, that's not entirely correct. The total angular momentum is the sum of the NN system's angular momentum (which includes their orbital and spin parts) and the X's angular momentum. But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the orbital angular momentum of X is L_X, and that the orbital angular momentum of the NN system in the final state is L', and their spins and other parts.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is the same as the orbital angular momentum transferred from the NN system. So the orbital angular momentum L' of the NN system plus the orbital angular momentum l of X must sum to zero, but that's not possible because orbital angular momentum is a vector and can't just cancel out unless they are in opposite directions, but I think that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe the orbital angular momentum of the X is the same as the orbital angular momentum of the NN system after emission. Because when the NN system emits X, the process would involve the NN system having orbital angular momentum L', and X having orbital angular momentum l, such that L' + l = L_initial. But the initial orbital angular momentum is L_initial=0 (since the initial state is 1S0, L=0). So L' + l must be zero? That can't be right because L' and l are non-negative integers. Wait, maybe I should think about it as the orbital angular momentum being emitted, so the total orbital angular momentum after emission is L' (of NN) plus l (of X).

Wait, but for the initial state, the orbital angular momentum is zero. So the total after emission must also be zero. So L' + l = 0. But since L' and l are non-negative integers, this implies L'=0 and l=0. But that can't be right because in some options, l is non-zero.

Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. The initial state has orbital angular momentum L_initial =0. The final state consists of the NN system (with orbital angular momentum L') and the X particle (with orbital angular momentum l). The total orbital angular momentum must be zero. So L' + l =0? No, that's not correct because angular momentum is a vector. The sum of vectors can be zero even if they have non-zero magnitudes and opposite directions. But in terms of quantum numbers, the possible values are determined by the addition of angular momentum. So the possible total orbital angular momentum L_total = |L' - l| up to L' + l, in integer steps. But the initial state has L_total=0, so the final state must also have L_total=0.

Wait, but in reality, the orbital angular momentum of X must be in the same direction as that of the NN system, but that's not necessarily the case. Alternatively, perhaps this is getting too complicated, and I should instead focus on the isospin, spin, and parity conditions.

Wait, I think I'm confusing orbital angular momentum with total angular momentum. Let me try a different approach.

Each option gives the emitted X's state. Let's consider each option one by one and check whether it satisfies the conditions.

First, the final NN state must have T=0, S=0 (since T = S + L +1 mod 2 → 0 = 0 + L' +1 mod 2 → L' must be 1 mod 2 (odd), as we determined earlier.

So for each option, let's find the orbital angular momentum l of X, and then determine what that implies about the NN's orbital angular momentum L'.

Wait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X, l, is the same as the orbital angular momentum of the NN system in the final state, L'. Because when the NN system emits X, the orbital angular momentum is transferred. So L' = l.

Wait, but that may not be correct. Because when the system emits a particle, the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle could be related to the orbital angular momentum of the parent system.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of X is L' emitted, so that the NN system's orbital angular momentum after emission is L' = L_initial - l. But since L_initial is 0, L' = -l. But angular momentum is a vector, so the magnitude is |L'| = l. So L' = l. Because L' is the orbital angular momentum of the NN system, which must be a non-negative integer, and l is also a non-negative integer, so L' = l.

Wait, that makes sense: L' = l, because the initial orbital angular momentum is zero, and the emitted X has orbital angular momentum l, so the NN system must have L' = l. Because the initial state has L=0, so after emission, the NN's orbital angular momentum plus X's must equal zero? No, wait, the total orbital angular momentum must be zero, so L' (NN) + l (X) = 0. But that would require L' = -l, which is not possible because L' and l are non-negative. So perhaps the correct approach is that the orbital angular momentum carried away by X is l, so the NN system's orbital angular momentum L' must be l. Because the initial state has L=0, so if the NN system after emission has L' = l, and X has l, then the sum would be 2l, which can't be zero unless l=0. So that can't be.

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the process as the NN system emitting a particle in a certain orbital angular momentum state, which would change the NN's orbital angular momentum.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to consider the orbital angular momentum L' of the NN system after emission as being the same as the orbital angular momentum l of the emitted X. Because when the two nucleons emit a particle, their orbital angular momentum is reduced by that of the emitted particle. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the orbital angular momentum of the emitted particle is l, and the NN system's orbital angular momentum becomes L' = L_initial - l. But since L_initial is 0, this would require L' = -l, which is impossible, so the only possibility is l=0 and L'=0. But that's only option B and D (l=0 and l=1?), wait no, option B has l=0 (S state), option D has l=1 (P state).

Wait, this seems confusing. Let me approach it from another angle.

The initial state has J_initial = 0. The final state must have total J_final =0. The final state is the NN system with J_NN and the emitted X with J_X. So J_NN + J_X = 0. So J_NN must equal J_X in magnitude and opposite in direction. But since J is a quantum number, the only possibility is that J_NN = J_X.

But J_NN is determined by the NN system's L' and S. Since we've established that S=0 (because T=0 and L' is odd), the total J_NN would be L' (since S=0, so J = L' because spin is zero). So J_NN = L'.

Similarly, J_X is determined by the X's orbital angular momentum l and its spin s. So J_X can be l ± s, etc. But for the sake of this problem, perhaps we can assume that the X is a spin-0 particle, which would make J_X = l.

Wait, but if X is spin-0, then J_X = l. So in that case, J_NN = l.

But earlier, we found that L' = l. And J_NN = L' because S=0.

So J_NN = L' = l.

And J_X = l, because X has spin 0 and orbital angular momentum l.

Thus, to have J_NN + J_X = 0, we must have J_NN = J_X. But since they are vectors, their directions must be opposite. So their magnitudes must be equal, but their directions opposite. But for quantum numbers, the only possible way is if J_NN = J_X, which would require that their magnitudes are the same. So l must be equal to L'.

But wait, we have J_NN = L' and J_X = l. So to have their vector sum zero, we need J_NN = J_X in magnitude and opposite in direction. But in quantum mechanics, the only way this can happen is if J_NN = J_X. Because if their magnitudes are the same and opposite, their sum would be zero. But in terms of quantum numbers, their magnitudes must be the same. So J_NN must equal J_X, which are l for both.

Wait, but if J_NN = l and J_X = l, then their sum can only be zero if l=0. Because for l=0, both J are zero, and their sum is zero. For l>0, their sum can't be zero because each J would have a direction, and it's impossible for two non-zero vectors to cancel each other unless they have specific orientations, but that's not guaranteed. So the only possibility is l=0, which implies J_X=0 and J_NN=0.

Wait, but that would mean in the final state, the NN system has L'=0 and S=0, so J_NN=0. And X has l=0 and spin 0, so J_X=0. Thus, their sum is zero, which satisfies J_initial=0.

But this would imply that the only allowed orbital angular momentum for X is l=0, i.e., S wave emission. But looking at the options, option B and D have l=0 and l=1 respectively.

Wait, but earlier I thought that L' must be odd because the parity of the final NN state is -1 (so (-1)^L' = -1 → L' is odd). So L' must be 1,3,5, etc.

So if L' is odd, and L'=l (assuming that), then l must be odd. So X must be emitted in an odd orbital angular momentum state, like P (l=1), F (l=3), D (l=2? No, wait D is l=2 which is even. So only l=1,3,5 etc. are allowed. So in the options, which X's l are odd?

Looking at the options:

A) 7D1 → D is l=2 (even)
B) 3S1 → S is l=0 (even)
C) 3D3 → D is l=2 (even)
D) 3P0 → P is l=1 (odd)

So only option D has l=1, which is odd. So according to this, only option D would allow L'=1, which is odd. But wait, earlier I thought that X's l must be even? No, no, because L' must be odd (from T = S + L +1 mod 2 → 0=0 + L' +1 mod 2 → L' is 1 mod 2), so L' is odd. So l must be equal to L', which is odd, so l must be odd.

So in the options, only option D has l=1 (odd). So the other options (A, B, C) have even l. Thus, those would not be allowed because L' must be odd.

Wait, but earlier I thought that J_NN must equal J_X. If J_NN is L' (since S=0), and J_X is l (since X is spin 0), then J_NN must equal J_X. So L' must equal l. And since L' is odd (1,3,5,...), l must be odd.

So options A, B, C have even l, which would make L' even, which would violate the condition that L' is odd. So those options are not allowed, and only option D is allowed.

But wait, the question is asking which partial wave is NOT permitted. If only option D is allowed, then the others (A, B, C) are not allowed. But looking back at the options, the question says which is not permitted. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, let me double-check.

The final NN state must have L' = l emitted by X. But earlier, I thought that L' must be odd. So if X is emitted with l even, then L' is even, which would make the final parity positive, which is wrong because the final parity must be -1.

Wait, let's think about parity again. The initial parity is 1. The final parity is (parity of NN) * (parity of X) = 1. The parity of X is given as -1. So parity of NN must be -1. NN's parity is (-1)^L', so L' must be odd.

Thus, X must have l = L' = odd. So l must be odd.

So only options with l odd are permitted. The options are:

A) l=2 → not allowed
B) l=0 → not allowed
C) l=2 → not allowed
D) l=1 → allowed.

So options A, B, C are not allowed, but wait, the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So the answer would be the one that doesn't have l odd.

Wait, but the options are given, and the question is which partial wave is not permitted. So perhaps the correct answer is any option that doesn't meet l being odd.

Looking at the options, options A, B, C have even l. So the partial waves that are not permitted are options A, B, and C. But wait, the question gives four options, and only one is the correct answer.

Wait, but the question is asking which is not permitted, so perhaps the correct answer is option B or D, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the process is NN (1S0) → NN' + X.

The angular momentum conservation:

Initial J is 0 → Final J is 0.

So the vector sum of the NN' and X's angular momenta must be zero.

Assuming X is spin-0 (which it would be if it's a pseudoscalar meson), then J_X = l.

NN' must have J_NN' = L' (since S=0).

So J_NN' + J_X =0 → L' + l =0.

But since L' and l are magnitudes, the only possibility is L' = l =0.

But earlier, we found that L' must be odd (from T=0 condition), so L' can't be zero. Thus, this would imply that X can't be spin-0. So perhaps X has spin 1, making J_X = l + s, where s is spin.

Wait, if X has spin 1, then J_X could be |l-1|, l, or l+1. So for a given l, J_X can be l-1, l, or l+1.

But this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the angular momentum of X is l, and the spin of X is s. Then the total J_X is determined by l and s. But without knowing s, it's hard to proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps X is a vector meson (spin-1), so s=1. Then J_X can be l-1, l, l+1.

But this is getting too involved. Maybe I should go back to the parity condition.

The parity of the final NN state is (-1)^L' = -1 → L' is odd.

Thus, L' must be 1,3,5, etc.

In the options, the emitted X's l is:

A) l=2 → L' would be 2, which is even → not allowed.
B) l=0 → L'=0 → even → not allowed.
C) l=2 → L'=2 → even → not allowed.
D) l=1 → L'=1 → odd → allowed.

So options A, B, C have L'=2, 0, 2, which are even. Only option D has L'=1, which is allowed.

Thus, the partial waves not permitted are options A, B, C. But the question says which is not permitted, so the answer would be any of those. But wait, the options are given, and the question is which is not permitted.

Wait, but perhaps I'm making a mistake in assuming that L' = l. Maybe the orbital angular momentum of X is not equal to L' of the NN system. Let me think again.

When the NN system emits X, the orbital angular momentum of X is l, and the orbital angular momentum of the NN system becomes L'. The initial state has L=0, so the total orbital angular momentum after emission is L' + l. But since the initial state has L=0, the total after must also be zero in terms of parity. Wait, no, parity is determined by (-1)^L', which is why L' must be odd.

But for angular momentum, the total after must be zero. So L' + l must equal zero? No, that's not possible because L' and l are magnitudes.

Wait, perhaps the orbital angular momentum is a vector, and the vector sum would be zero. So the emitted X has orbital angular momentum l in a direction opposite to the NN's L' so that L' - l =0. Thus, L' = l.

But then, as before, L' must be l, and L' must be odd. So l must be odd.

Thus, the only permitted option is D, which has l=1. So the other options (A, B, C) are not permitted.

But the question is which one is not permitted, so perhaps the answer is option B.

Wait, no, the question gives four options and we have to choose which is not permitted. So the answer would be any option where l is even.

Looking at the options, only option D has l=1 (odd), so the other options (A, B, C) have even l and thus are not allowed.

But the question is to choose which partial wave is not permitted. So the correct answer would be any of A, B, C, but according to the options, the only allowed is D.

Wait, but the options are:

A) 7D1 → l=2 (even)
B) 3S1 → l=0 (even)
C) 3D3 → l=2 (even)
D) 3P0 → l=1 (odd)

Thus, the one not permitted would be any of A, B, C. But the question asks which is not permitted, so perhaps the correct answer is option B, because in option B, the emitted X is in 3S1. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, perhaps I should also check the spin and isospin conditions.

We know that the final NN state has T=0 and S=0.

The spin of the NN system is S=0, so their combined spin is zero.

The isospin T=0. The possible isospin values for two nucleons (each with isospin 1/2) can be T=0 or T=1.

In the initial state, the two nucleons are in a 1S0 state, which is a singlet state (S=0), and I think the isospin is also zero because the combination is T=0. So the initial state has T=0.

When they emit a particle X, the isospin must be conserved. So the final state (NN' + X) must have the same isospin as the initial. But the initial is T=0, so the final must also have T=0.

But I'm not sure how that affects the partial wave.

Alternatively, perhaps the isospin condition is already satisfied by the given T=0, so it doesn't affect the angular momentum consideration.

Thus, the main condition is that l must be odd, so only option D is allowed. So the others (A, B, C) are not allowed. Therefore, the answer would be any of A, B, C. But the options are given, and the question asks which is not permitted. So the correct answer is, for example, option B.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recap.

The problem's main conditions:

1. The final NN state has T=0, which implies S=0 (from T = S + L +1 mod 2; since T=0 and S=0, L must be 1 mod 2 → odd).

2. The parity of the NN state after emission is (-1)^L' = -1 → L' is odd.

3. Angular momentum must be conserved, so the total J after must be zero.

Assuming X has spin zero (so J_X = l), and the NN system's J_NN = L' (since S=0).

Thus, L' must equal l, and L' must be odd. So l must be odd.

Only option D has l=1 (odd), so the others are not allowed. Therefore, the answer is option B.

Wait, no. Option B has l=0. So it's not allowed. So the answer is option B.

Wait, but the question states that the emitted particle X has intrinsic parity -1. So for each option, we must also ensure that the parity condition is met.

The parity of the final state is (Parity_NN) * (Parity_X) = (-1)^L' * (-1) = (-1)^(L' +1).

Since the initial parity is 1, the final must be 1, so:

(-1)^(L' +1) = 1 → (-1)^(L' +1) = 1 → L' +1 must be even → L' must be odd, which is consistent with our earlier conclusion.

So, as long as L' is odd, the parity condition is satisfied.

Thus, the only allowed option is D, so the others are not permitted. So the answer is one of A, B, C. The options are given, and the question asks which is not permitted.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is option B) 1S0 → 3S1 + p. Because in this option, the emitted X has l=0 (S wave), which is even, making L'=0, which is even, violating the condition that L' must be odd.

Wait, no, wait. If option B has X emitted in l=0, then L' would be 0, which is even, but we need L' to be odd. So option B is not allowed.

So the answer is option B.


To determine which partial wave is not permitted, we analyze the conditions provided in the problem:

1. **Initial State and Conservation Laws**:  
   The initial state is a bound system of two nucleons (NN) in the 1S0 state. This state has total spin \( S = 0 \), orbital angular momentum \( L = 0 \), and total angular momentum \( J = 0 \). The intrinsic parity of the initial state is \( (-1)^L = 1 \). When the NN system emits a particle \( X \) with intrinsic parity \( -1 \), the total parity of the system must be conserved. Thus, the parity of the final state is given by:  
   \[
   \text{Parity}_{\text{final}} = \text{Parity}_{\text{NN}} \cdot \text{Parity}_X
   \]  
   Substituting \(\text{Parity}_X = -1\) and \(\text{Parity}_{\text{final}} = 1\), we find:  
   \[
   \text{Parity}_{\text{NN}} = -1
   \]  
   The parity of the final NN state is \((-1)^{L'}\), where \( L' \) is the orbital angular momentum of the final NN state. Thus:  
   \[
   (-1)^{L'} = -1 \implies L' \text{ is odd}.
   \]

2. **Isospin and Angular Momentum Conservation**:  
   The problem states that the isospin, angular momentum, and spin quantum numbers of the final NN state satisfy:  
   \[
   T(\text{NN}) = S(\text{NN}) + L(\text{NN}) + 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]  
   Given \( T(\text{NN}) = 0 \), this simplifies to:  
   \[
   S(\text{NN}) + L(\text{NN}) = 1 \, (\text{mod } 2).
   \]  
   Since \( S(\text{NN}) = 0 \) (from the singlet state), \( L(\text{NN}) \) must be odd to satisfy the condition.

3. **Analysis of Each Option**:  
   The emitted particle \( X \) has an orbital angular momentum \( l \), which corresponds to the angular momentum state of \( X \). The final NN state inherits an orbital angular momentum \( L' = l \) (from angular momentum conservation). Since \( L' \) must be odd, \( l \) must also be odd.  

   - **Option A: \( 1S0 \to 7D1 + p \)**  
     Here, \( X \) is emitted in the \( D1 \) state, which corresponds to \( l = 2 \) (even). This violates the condition that \( l \) must be odd.  
     **Not permitted.**

   - **Option B: \( 1S0 \to 3S1 + p \)**  
     Here, \( X \) is emitted in the \( S1 \) state, which corresponds to \( l = 0 \) (even). This also violates the condition that \( l \) must be odd.  
     **Not permitted.**

   - **Option C: \( 1S0 \to 3D3 + f \)**  
     Here, \( X \) is emitted in the \( D3 \) state, which corresponds to \( l = 2 \) (even). This violates the condition that \( l \) must be odd.  
     **Not permitted.**

   - **Option D: \( 1S0 \to 3P0 + s \)**  
     Here, \( X \) is emitted in the \( P0 \) state, which corresponds to \( l = 1 \) (odd). This satisfies the condition that \( l \) must be odd.  
     **Permitted.**

4. **Conclusion**:  
   The partial waves that are not permitted are those where \( l \) is even. Among the options, only Option D satisfies the condition, while Options A, B, and C do not. Since the question asks for the partial wave that is **not permitted**, the correct answer is **Option B**.
